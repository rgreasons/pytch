Taken as a whole, it's folksy post-rock, but broken down into parts, there are elements of Pharaoh Sanders' meditative jazz; blossoming, Eno-like song structures; George Harrison's Eastern flirtations; the monastic drones of mid-70s German music; and the hippyish optimism of a group like the Incredible String Band. (There's probably more, too, but I'll leave room for the geeks and trainspotters.) Lynch's talent as a writer-- and as a listener before that-- is to hear how all these sounds essentially exist on the same spectrum: They're earthy, unhurried, and occupied by a hypnotic kind of beauty.</p>
<p>Lynch is a 26-year-old PhD student in ethnomusicology, which I weigh more as a biographical curiosity than some kind of key as to why he's able to make good music. He's not particularly phenomenal or technically capable as an instrumentalist (or if he is, he's not rubbing our noses in it), but he handles everything-- whether it's piano, drums, saxophone, or synthesizer-- without a twitch or fumble. And despite the variety of the instruments, everything on the album sounds like it's riding backseat. If anything sticks out, it's his voice-- it's a little nasal and attention-getting, though I can't imagine him letting someone else sing, either.</p>
<p>Lynch's music is essentially <i>nice</i>, which Pitchforker Joe Colly hinted at when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14366-mare/"">reviewing last year's <i>Mare</i></a>: ""For how druggy and narcotized it sounds, it doesn't come across as sad or tuned-out."" I'd argue that it is tuned-out, but I agree that it's not sad: <i>Terra</i> doesn't ever feel like it's staring down the void or opening a space for the listener's loneliness (whether it's the warm or the cold kind
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
). Most of the album stays just above resting pulse-- at its most agitated, it's a hootenanny in slow motion. Lynch gets a lot of ""front""/""back porch"" in his reviews, which I generally agree with, but would choose to add: warm weather, fading daylight, bird twitter, and your relaxant of choice.</p>
<p>It's hard to know what to make of Lynch, Matt Mondanile from Ducktails, and other shorts-and-sandal bros that have gotten popular in the indiesphere during the last few years. <i>Terra</i> is almost relentlessly benign. It's not music of struggle, or even music of depth. That's one thing that definitely makes it feel different from its antecedents: unlike, say, Pharaoh Sanders or the Incredible String Band or even <i>Sung Tongs</i>-era Animal Collective, Lynch never stretches for transcendence or intensity. It's the musical equivalent of ""beer in the fridge if you want it, dude."" That's not criticism, just a mild skepticism. <i>Terra</i>'s reclamation of a low-stakes domestic space is ultimately more comforting than it is naive-- a counterweight to the impulse to make something glossy, agitated, and, well, young. It makes me think of what one of my favorite composers, David Behrman, said <a href=""http://www.furious.com/perfect/behrman.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">when asked about the therapeutic qualities of his music</a>: ""The world is filled with busy, noisy music-- and noise in general-- and I'd rather contribute to the quieter end of the spectrum."" <i>Terra</i> doesn't just contribute to the quieter end of the spectrum, it reminds me of the boundaries of that spectrum, and all the sounds murmuring inside them.</p></div>"|15307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15307-terra/|7.7|Mike Powell

Their first album together was simply recorded under the last names of the four musicians involved-- Charles Hayward of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat/"">This Heat</a>, Alexis Taylor of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>, John Coxon of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3919-spring-heel-jack/"">Spring Heel Jack</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/280-derek-bailey/"">Derek Bailey</a> associate Pat Thomas. That record was recorded in one day, with no prior practice, and released on the <a href=""http://treader.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Treader</a> label in 2009. The four lengthy improvisations were loose, fun, and occasionally whimsical. No one was surprised they returned to their day jobs once it was complete. Instead, they've done some fine-tuning to their methodology, adopted the About Group moniker, and signed to indie behemoths Domino. <i>Start and Complete</i> was also recorded in one day, at Studio 2 at Abbey Road, but this time Taylor handed out demos for certain tracks so his fellow musicians had a vague idea what to expect.</p>
<p>The result is that the rough edges have been shaved down and tamed. Many of the free-floating ideas have been constrained and refined into discipline, all topped off by Taylor's earnest vocalizing, which mines similar territory to his former collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"">Robert Wyatt</a>. In truth, Taylor has a more limited range than Wyatt. But he knows how to find that same buckle in his voice, where it feels like he might slip out of tune at any minute but the weight of emotion he's conveying more than makes up for it. The singer talked about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4958-tim-buckley/"">Tim Buckley</a>'s marrying of folk aesthetics with astral-jazz projections in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41962-hot-chips-alexis-taylor-talks-new-project/"">recent interview</a>, but that's only one of many touchstones to surface on <i>Start and Complete</i>. Krautrock, Hammond organ-propelled soul, country-ish guitar plucking, and buckets of primal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>-eque electronics also play a large role in shaping the About Group sound.</p>
<p>There are 14 tracks on this record, but a handful of them are barely more than a minute or two long. The most impressive feat, considering the limitation they were working under, is how complete the longer songs sound. ""Don't Worry"" is a jaunty pop number that bears a verse-chorus-verse structure and a squelchy wah-wah guitar solo at its center; the following ""With Each New Day"" is a tender ballad punctured by gloops of analog synth that reflect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"">Stevie Wonder</a>'s 70s peak on <i>Innervisions</i>. A cursory listen to either track would not reveal their improvised roots to the uninitiated. But sometimes the seams do show. ""A Perspective"" never finds direction beyond its basic piano and organ arrangement, with Hayward's late-entry drums sounding like he's lost for something to do before the track sags to a close. Sometimes fragments of ideas are cut frustratingly short-- ""There's a Way to End This Run of Doubt"" sounds like it's about to flourish into a wonderful soft-pop track before being abruptly cut after just 45 seconds.</p>
<p>But these are minor quibbles-- the bulk of <i>Start and Complete</i> feeds off a rich seam of melancholia that the four players intuitively tap into. The twin highlights are ""Lay Me Down"" and the cover of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Harvey+Averne"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harvey Averne</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>'s ""You're No Good"". The former is a tale of troubled love that bridges the sad and the frivolous sides of the band, with its dolorous keyboard textures and yearning vocal stylings set to playful bleeps and bloops. With ""You're No Good"" they return to the territory mapped out on that first record and bolt it to some of the ideas from this one, allowing their blue-eyed soul crooning to filter into choppy grooves and organ soloing that sounds like <a href=""http://www.brianauger.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brian Auger</a> jamming with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Jaki Liebezeit</a>. Occasionally the mid-tempo range that exerts a lockhold on the band can feel a little same-y, and it's surprisingly trad at times considering the experimental background of the players involved. But <i>Start and Complete</i> ultimately achieves what it sets out to do, which is to place a song-oriented frame around another off-the-cuff session by these four disparate talents, who will no doubt spin off in a completely different direction should About Group reconvene.</p></div>"|15335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15335-start-and-complete/|7.2|Nick Neyland

It was a profile-raising breakthrough release for both the band and the <a href=""http://www.labrador.se/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Labrador</a> label. But the band didn't exactly sound joyful about the whole situation: The record sounded reluctant and distantly depressed, and <a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/02/interview-johan-duncanson-of-the-radio-dept/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">various</a> <a href=""http://www.rawkblog.net/2011/02/interview-the-radio-dept/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> revealed their own distaste for the Internet and self-publicity in general.</p>
<p>Sweden's Acid House Kings are another band on Labrador with an uneasy relationship to ambition, but they sound happier about what they're doing. The band, which features Labrador head Johan Angergård as a member, is back with its first LP in six years, <i>Music Sounds Better With You</i>. Like the Radio Dept. last year, AHK have returned after a layoff with their strongest-sounding record and a newfound vitality. The band's previous releases were low-key and shy-sounding-- when vocalist Julia Lannerheim first appeared on 1997's <i>Advantage Acid House Kings</i>, she sounded reserved and afraid to speak up. There's no stage fright here: the production is bright, the arrangements propulsive and peppy, and Lannerheim and co-vocalist Niklas Angergård sound confident in their newly strong voices.</p>
<p>Considering how long the band's been doing this (20 years and counting), such an outgoing attitude is a little surprising. ""Maturity"" in popular music is sometimes associated with mellowing and settling down. Very little on this record scans a ""old,"" but the concept of growing up-- and how those shifts affect the way you live and love-- is a recurring theme. Lannerheim bemoans the 9-to-5 grind and wonders whether it's making her insane in ""(I'm In) A Chorus Line"", while on ""I Just Called to Say Jag Ålskar Dig""-- ""I love you"" in Swedish, of course-- Niklas sends a dispatch to his dearest from a business trip, wondering ""is it really me in the conference room?"" On the charmingly upbeat highlight ""Are We Lovers or Are We Friends?"", he caps a slow dance by admitting that ""I know I've held my hopes so high/ I almost forget that we're gonna die.""</p>
<p>So one way to settle into adulthood is to fall in love-- with love itself, and with your record collection, too. <i>Music Sounds Better With You</i> is a mash note to a wide range of indie-pop-- alternately buzzy, peppy, shy, melodramatic, and grandly sweeping. Each approach is rendered with heart and never feels rote. That album title, it turns out, isn't a reference to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCoSF-voHY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the beloved Stardust song</a>; it's about the joy that comes from creating music with others. Acid House Kings might be addressing the sentiment to each other and they might be addressing it to us, but either way, it rings true.</p></div>"|15351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15351-music-sounds-better-with-you/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

Add to that résumé a stint earlier this year as the honorary activities director and keynote speaker for a weekend-long, garage rock ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39655-black-lips-and-vivian-girls-to-head-out-on-garage-rock-tropical-cruise/"" target=""_blank"">Bruise Cruise</a>"" to the Bahamas. In a <i>Washington City Paper</i> <a href=""http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/40532/bruise-cruise/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">essay about the cruise</a>-- titled ""A Supposedly Punk Thing I'll Never Do Again""-- Svenonius also acted as a sort of self-aware narrative interlocutor, peeking over the fourth wall to ask, ""How's the story going? What's it going to say?""</p>
<p>On Chain and the Gang's debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13022-down-with-liberty-up-with-chains/"" target=""_blank""><i>Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!</i></a>, Svenonius played a similar split role, as both performer and critical interrogator of what he might call the entertainment-industrial complex. Songs like ""Interview With the Chain Gang"" and ""Trash Talk"" spoofed music criticism, while other numbers toyed with broader issues of rock'n'roll and late-stage capitalism.</p>
<p>So a follow-up titled <i>Music's Not For Everyone</i> suggests a few possible theses: Do Chain and the Gang long for a bygone era of elitism and cultural gatekeeping? Is it an ironic pronouncement on par with their debut's condemnation of liberty? The band plays it typically close to the vest on the title track. Over a distant, dubby low hum and tambourine, Calvin Johnson intones the titular motto, while Svenonius delivers an archly anti-populist spoken-word sermon: ""Everyone likes to switch on the radio/ But they don't get it... I know you wanna share, but don't."" Other guests include guitarist/organist Brian Weber (Dub Narcotic Sound System), and Tara Jane O'Neil.</p>
<p>The best songs here are also often the funniest. ""Not Good Enough (Dub)"" is a sing-songy admonition against positive thinking set to tipsy, descending piano chords. ""For Practical Purposes (I Love You)"" is a vaudevillian back-and-forth between two reluctant lovers, with splashes of surf guitar and an alluring female vocal. The self-aware ""It's a Hard, Hard Job (Keeping Everybody High)"" is a faux spiritual, with Svenonius cast as a slave to showbiz, while ""(I've Got) Privilege"" explains, over rubber-banding bass, organ flares, and sultry background vocals, why he's onstage and you're not.</p>
<p>Svenonius is still playing his dual role here, singing pop songs while subtly critiquing their conventions, but increasingly with Chain and the Gang he's laying off the ideology to make room for the grooves. <i>Music</i> may lack the crazy ambition of his previous acts or some of the unexpected goofiness of the Gang's debut, but it's still a modest pleasure and a fine addition to Svenonius' catalog.</p></div>"|15347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15347-musics-not-for-everyone/|6.6|Eric Grandy

Hooks everywhere. Hooks in droves. Looking back, though, it's not so much the hooks themselves that powered their mid-2000s breakthrough, <i>Skeleton</i>, but the propulsive, nearly punkish speed at which the Danish crew blew through them. A song like ""The Wonder""-- with its slightly sour, constantly shifting melody and singer Christian Hjelm's vocal-- was seemingly in danger of losing its center, held together by sheer forward motion. Their latest, the self-titled <i>Figurines</i>, could benefit from some of that old pep; the spiny hooks are still there, but you'll have to sort through an overly fussy batch of arrangements to get to them.</p>
<p>2007's <i>When the Deer Wore Blue</i> found Figurines tempering their furious rhythms and tarting up their creaky tunes with somewhat symphonic psych-pop flourishes, to its detriment. The songs were adequate, but the adornments and sluggish pacing weighed them down. <i>Figurines</i> marks a partial return to the get-up-and-go of <i>Skeleton</i>, although the tempos have slowed some and the tunes are decidedly less direct. They've still got a distinctive sense of melody, all these odd angles and unlikely harmonies. And the band-- now a three-piece after a couple lineup shakeups-- are inventive arrangers, coloring in their knotty late-90s American indie rock-indebted sound with hints of country-rock, ornate British psych, and lots more. But post-<i>Skeleton</i>, they've grown overzealous in the studio, their zig-zag vocals and too-busy-by-half adornment dampening the impact of the songs.</p>
<p>Take ""Free Today"", the album's highlight; its lilting melody and Hjelm's clear-as-day vocal seem practically radio-ready until he spikes the stellar chorus with a completely superfluous ""ay-yai-yai."" Or the jaunty ""Every Week"", all dressed up in strings, bells, and swirling harmonies forced to duke it out for space with the already busy melody. Figurines' records are full of these unusual turns, but there's far too many this time around, and the constant detours leave the record feeling jerky, its melodies muddled. Vocal lines bend so often many lose their shape, and excessive instrumental textures distract as often as they dazzle; these songs just attempt to do way too much in their three minute spans, and it's enough to leave one longing for the clean lines and fiery feel of <i>Skeleton</i>. And the lyrics don't help matters; Hjelm's have never been a focal point, but <i>Figurines</i>' mark-missing stabs at cleverness like ""I love her like a lover should love her,"" often placed in the songs' pole positions, tend to stick in your craw.</p>
<p>So <i>Figurines</i> is a record of good ideas running counter to themselves; not a disappointment, exactly, just a bit of a jumble. It shoots for melodic knottiness but catches itself in its own tangles. It's never boring, and there's certainly plenty to wrap your ear around. But these sweet songs just feel like they would've been better served by either pulling back or revving up, not the slathering on that takes place here. Hooks, Figurines got; if only they could've let them be.</p></div>"|15358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15358-figurines/|6.3|Paul Thompson

It was pretty and melancholy, not so unlike a lot of their other music, really, but as its title suggests, it had the feel of a goodbye. It seemed so final. But no, the Austin quartet is not done. <i>Take Care, Take Care, Take Care</i> finds the band returning with a renewed focus on its most basic sound: multiple guitars with drums and a bit of bass. The piano that helped lend ""So Long, Lonesome"" its sense of cold finality is gone, and the band sounds confident getting back to the setup on which they built their reputation.</p>
<p>The band famously doesn't consider itself post-rock, but if we're being honest, today they may be the last true exponent of turn-of-the-century post-rock-- unlike Mogwai, they never wandered away from drifting instrumentals constructed around loud-soft dynamics and the contrast between soft guitar tones and pounding drums. Most of their other contemporaries from the period are gone or found dub or electronics or something else. But Explosions in the Sky are sticking to their guns-- <i>Take Care</i> is less ragged than <i>Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die</i>, but it's otherwise a very similar album.</p>
<p>So whether or not you dive into <i>Take Care </i>will largely depend on your appetite for loud/soft instrumental post-rock. If your appetite for it is boundless, you will be very pleased by this album, and probably also its elaborate artwork, which can be folded several ways to make the interior or exterior of a building. At its best, <i>Take Care</i> is ruled by drummer Chris Hrasky. The guitars tend to hang on particular figures or throw up an e-bowed haze, and Hrasky is the one who can cut through that. On ""Trembling Hands"" his drum kit is the lead instrument as he unleashes Keith Moon-worthy torrents of snare, tom, and cymbal, throwing himself at the guitars as though they were a wall to break through.</p>
<p>One could argue that the music here is predictable and even a bit old-hat. We've lived with this sound for well over a decade now, and we have classics to compare it to, including Explosions in the Sky's own work. And that argument holds some water. But the simple fact is that Explosions in the Sky are very good at this particular thing, and it seems as though no matter how many crescendos and diminuendos they play, there remains a certain amount of cathartic power to their music. The emotion in it is ambiguous, and you can read whatever you want into it-- the soundtrack to your rainy day might be the soundtrack to someone else's overwhelming joy, and that too is important to its appeal.</p></div>"|15327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15327-take-care-take-care-take-care/|7.2|Joe Tangari

But it did have memorable lines about Jigga's newfound love for chancletas, and, more significantly, announced the arrival of Max B, an ex-con rapper with the gift for a gripping melody. Max went on to much under-the-radar creative success. His widely credited ghostwriting for Jim Jones produced some of the latter's biggest hits, and helped Jones' second LP land on the Billboard top 10. He was the musical mastermind behind underground Harlem super-group Byrdgang. And Max's succession of solo mixtapes, from <i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Max-B-Million-Dollar-Baby-Radio-mixtape.1998.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Million Dollar Baby Radio</a></i> to <i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Max-B-Coke-Wave-mixtape.33214.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coke Wave</a></i> to <i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Max-B-Quarantine-mixtape.35205.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quarantine</a></i>, established the rapper as a major talent. His style was gritty and unrefined, yet retained immediate pop instincts. <i>Vigilante Season</i> doesn't move too far afield from his mixtape work, despite being his first official solo LP. This is a mixed blessing. For his fanbase, it includes better sound quality, no DJ drops, and several missing pieces from a career that was cut too short. But while it has some great moments, it doesn't stand above some of his better tapes, and may be an uneven entry point for those not steeped in the Biggaveli mythos.</p>
<p>But flawed as <i>Vigilante Season</i> is, investing time in Max's world can be rewarding. Like the biggest rappers of the past few years-- think Gucci, Drake, even Soulja Boy-- Max fills a space that, a decade ago, would have been occupied by producers. He is as much songwriter as rapper, and musically, Max is an old soul. This is most evident on one of the album's best moments, the sublime ""Where Do I Go (BBQ Music)"", which features dual choruses, one of which interpolates Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal's 1985 R&amp;B classic ""<span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDVzaTMF-ps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saturday Love</a></span>"". His ear for memorable hooks, sung in a grungy slur, gives his music a hazy, intoxicated quality. Max's lyrics don't have the opulent imagery of Gucci or the poetic minimalism of a rapper like the Jacka. But like both artists, his raps sound cool, with an effortless detachment that disguises musical precision.</p>
<p>His lyrics provide a rough, if familiar, street-rap character sketch, with all the rags-to-riches tales and illegal business that image implies. One of Max's particular innovations was to give late-00s New York a more universal appeal, taking an every-thug street-prophet template and coloring it with the melodicism of classic West Coast or Midwest (think Bone Thugs-N-Harmony) gangster rap. Some of this material would be tedious in most rappers' hands. It is pro-forma street music, and brutality and misogyny are a part of its fabric. His work is engaging not in spite of this-- your mileage may vary for obvious reasons-- but because he manages to suffuse this ugliness with an undercurrent of nuanced emotion. There is no redemption in his words themselves, and little sense of the pain underlying it all. Instead, the record's druggy, mournful tone and melancholy songcraft provide a contrasting canvas for Max's cool remove. In this contradiction, his detachment provides balance, raising the emotional stakes. Max is an actor in a drama larger than himself, an unreliable narrator in a chaotic world. In the tension between song and rapper lies the music's power and truth.</p>
<p>The production throughout-- the bulk courtesy of Harlem producer Dame Grease-- sounds dirty and dilapidated, yet remains open to smooth pop songcraft. His beats are tense and compressed, but tackle a range of moods, from the ambiguous nausea of ""White Lines"" to the wistfulness of ""You Won't Go"". Compared with the freewheeling, capricious atmosphere of the now-classic <i>Coke Wave</i> mixtape, Max's lyrics are shot through with bitterness. His frequent target is Jim Jones, who managed to swindle Max out of his publishing in exchange for bail money. This tone, though understandable, makes <i>Vigilante Season</i> a limited introduction to Max's work, but it does add a further dimension to one of this era's most underrated rap artists.</p></div>"|15339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15339-vigilante-season/|7.7|David Drake

His self-titled debut is the sound of someone mining every nook and cranny of his influences for a few really specific sounds: the weird warmth of Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder's chintzy propulsion, Detroit techno's stalwart intensity, and the goofball sprawl of soundtrack-era Tangerine Dream.</p>
<p>""Invisible College"", the boldest and longest track, begins with urgent acoustic guitar, then slowly piles on hand-claps, dance percussion, and whining synthesizers before shifting into a melodramatic breakdown thanks to very Doors-like organs. Then, the feverish guitar floats back into the mix, the laid-back L.A. vibes subside, and the track nervously starts all over again, rebuilding itself and shuffling along for another five minutes.</p>
<p>Most of the album reflects this wandering approach to composition. The obliquely catchy ""The Curse"" and ""Hex"" are followed by ""Grinding of the Brakes"", an atmospheric groove that could've come from the soundtrack to Michael Mann's <i>Thief</i>. That song's moody rhythmic energy is derailed for the slow-growing hum of ""Solar Flares Burn For You"", which is subsequently pushed to the side for ""Lucifer Morning Star"", a pulsing track with a woozy vocoded refrain similar to ""The Curse"" and ""Hex"". The most focused songs end the album: ""My Etheric Body"" is based around breakdance rhythms, and ""Beachy Head"" hypnotically builds, giving its undivided attention to moving forward like a proper dance single.</p>
<p>The songs here are either epic, cosmic disco work-outs like ""Invisible College"" (""Grinding of the Brakes"", ""Beachy Head"") or Balearic pop with vocals (""The Curse"", ""Hex"", ""Lucifer Morning Star"", and ""My Etheric Body""). The one song that doesn't fit into either category, ""Solar Flares Burn For You"", is placed right in the middle of the album. Proper sequencing would stick the singing tracks on one side of this slow-growing ambient track, and the space funk on the other. Instead, the songs are all shuffled around, giving the album an unpredictable, searching energy. The kinder word for what's going on here is probably ""improvising,"" but ""jamming,"" though totally uncool, is just a lot more appropriate: Improv connotes constant thinking and rearranging while jamming suggests an intuitive, lost-in-the-music attempt at transcendence.</p></div>"|15355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15355-gatto-fritto/|7.4|Brandon Soderberg

During the past six years, the Portland, Ore., psychedelic voyagers have released a handful of small-issue recordings on cassette and CD-R for labels like Not Not Fun, Digitalis, and their own Solar Commune. As their media of choice might suggest, those records were often rough and tumble, the sort of spontaneous, slipshod excellence that comes from putting a microphone into a room of players with good chemistry and letting the tape roll. The same even applies for one of their proper 2009 full-lengths, <i>Palace of the Night Skies</i>, for Three Lobed: Though its guitar jams were interesting and immersive, suggesting the careful build and balance that the best of this stuff demands, it was cheaply and quickly made. The three pieces weren't cohesive, either, dropping you into one jam and out of the other, without much regard for the whole trip.</p>
<p><i>Beyond the 4th Door</i>, though, adds not only a pristine and considered quality to Eternal Tapestry's sound but also a cohesion that's not been there before. This expanded, five-piece lineup-- delivered here properly for the first time-- contributes to that sense. No longer just drums and guitar, the addition of saxophone, bassist, and synthesizer expand both the band's sonic palette and, it seems, its compositional mission. Culled from two hours of improvisation,<i> Beyond the 4th Door</i> moves in well-designed waves, never exhausting all its intrigue and energy at any given time. Closer ""Time Winds Through a Glass, Clearly"" is the perfect summary of all of that. The track first takes shape only with circular swaths of sound, big clouds of tone wrapping around a rhythmic plod. Without notice, though, it sublimates into a righteous three-minute jam, an unexpected coda full of classic rock gusto. Things rise, fall, drift, and rise or fall again, finally making for an Eternal Tapestry album that feels like, well, exactly that.</p>
<p>Don't let the name Eternal Tapestry fool you. This isn't wallpaper music, idle sound meant as background hum. Rather, these five pieces are finite and deliberate, each a smartly designed unit of something more. Opener ""Ancient Echoes"", for instance, is a welcome invocation. It begins just with guitar twinkle, a dozen tiny notes shining in quick succession. The bass joins with a thick tone, playing one melody over and over again. The drums come finally, holding steady beneath it all. A synthesizer offers slow, steady hums, and vocals distorted into textural washes snake through the layers like smoke. In its final minute, it finally builds past a drift, threatening an eruption that never comes. Rather, Eternal Tapestry segue into ""Cosmic Manhunt"", a five-minute interlude of sorts that's slightly more aggressive, with guitars finally growling.</p>
<p>It's also a prelude, or a functional transition, into ""Galactic Derelict"", the album's essential seven minutes. A blues-rock recast, its dual guitars stretch menacingly above drums that bob like buoys in a steady tide. This sounds like the version of Earth that never happened, before Dylan Carlson traded high volume for high precision. The guitars cycle perfectly between proper rock lines and squalls of distortion, so that ascendant riffs bend and blur into something bigger, something more like pure momentum. Ryan Carlile's saxophone lines rip through the background, his miasmatic streams serving as an accelerant for the band's most vital moment. They finally lock into proper rock'n'roll form, with both guitarists soloing like this is their moment in the spotlight. Almost without trying, the track becomes a perfect psychedelic blister-- headstrong and hot, five dudes marching headlong in one righteous moment. Long live major-label debuts, then: This is the sound of Eternal Tapestry finally turning its instincts into conquests.</p></div>"|15352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15352-beyond-the-4th-door/|7.3|Grayson Currin

The distinction is slight, but telling. Because ""wits"" usually refers  to an overall sense of sanity while ""wit"" is more commonly associated  with one's cleverness or humor. And this record does not mark the end of  McCombs' good judgment. Quite the contrary. However, it is not funny or  quick or especially nimble-minded. Over the course of his previous four  albums, McCombs fashioned himself an enigmatic vagabond in the classic  Dylan mold, yet it wasn't until 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13180-catacombs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Catacombs</i></a> that his enigma started  to feel more like a complement than a crutch. While he may have let his  wit get the better of him before through knowingly obtuse lyrics and  showy arrangements, <i>WIT'S END</i> fittingly leaves those days behind.  This is a gorgeous album of despair, the most believable evidence yet  that McCombs is living up to his own legend.</p>
<p><i>Catacombs</i> had  McCombs stripping away the instrumentation he had built up around his  songs, ending with a bare naturalism that suited him well. And <i>WIT'S END</i> goes even further, its empty spaces and deliberate tempos matching  the album's immense loneliness. To get an idea of how desolate, exactly,  consider that opening track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12094-county-line/"" target=""_blank"">""County Line""</a>-- an inching ballad about  severe unrequited love with its own <a href=""http://www.vmagazine.com/2011/03/cass-mccombs-county-line/#more-20735"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">frighteningly real, syringe-filled  junkie video</a>-- is the jauntiest thing here. <i>Catacombs</i> highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11381-you-saved-my-life/"" target=""_blank"">""You  Saved My Life""</a> saw McCombs voicing startling sincere and direct  affection; if someone played it at a wedding, grandparents might not  blink. The direness of <i>WIT'S END</i> suggests the California-born  singer may need some more saving; if someone played these songs at a  funeral, sons and daughters would bow their heads solemnly.</p>
<p>So  yeah, this record is a downer. But there's rare beauty in such darkness,  too-- just look at forebears like Leonard Cohen, Elliott Smith, and  Nick Drake. Or even Edgar Allan Poe. Because, along with its mopiness,  <i>WIT'S END</i> is creepy as hell. Its gothic eeriness embodies not Poe's famous tales as much as his more ethereal and  lovelorn poems. In the author's 1827 verse <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/178358"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Spirits of the Dead""</a>, he  characterizes the titular ghosts as comforting-- ""a mystery of  mysteries!"" And that same infatuation with wispy denouements is all over  <i>WIT'S END</i>, but much like Poe's spirits, McCombs' songs bring life to their withering characters over and over again.</p>
<p>Take  the seven-and-a-half-minute elegy ""Memory's Stain"", in which a shared  thrift-store sweater leads to ruminations on the unwashable blots that  reside in our subconscious only to pop up without warning. ""Boozing is  the highest aim when spittle won't get out Memory's stain,"" he sings,  before a breathy bass clarinet takes over for the back half, its unique  low tones planting many new memories of its own. And closer ""A Knock  Upon the Door"" tells what could be a centuries-old tale of the  tumultuous relationship between a minstrel and his creative muse. The  song's repetitive verse-upon-verse structure stretches out to nearly ten  minutes, but more oddball sounds-- the baroque, recorder-like  chalumeau, a metallic dink in place of a snare drum, and the ominous  door tap itself-- keep things intriguingly askew. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12168-the-lonely-doll/"" target=""_blank"">""The Lonely Doll""</a>,  meanwhile, holds its story of a drunken louse and weeping woman aloft  over a pillow-y Hammond B3 and brushed drums, the woozy lilt a  convincing callback to Leonard Cohen's 1967 debut LP.</p>
<p><a href=""http://stereogum.com/646281/progress-report-cass-mccombs/franchises/progress-report/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In a  handwritten note to Stereogum</a>, McCombs recently wrote, ""I know people  get lonely because I do, so that's what I end up writing songs about,  how you get lonely sometimes and come up with these big ideas that give  you meaning for a second but then leave you like everything else leaves  you."" The statement is economical and accurate, if overly modest.  Because while there are lots of musicians trading in loneliness out  there, most of them often veer into a self-pity that can leave listeners  even more far gone. But the intangibility of <i>WIT'S END</i> makes it a more  realistic and reliable companion, its elusive secrets offering a queer  comfort. At the start of his first album, <i>A</i>, Cass McCombs posed the  question, ""Is it dying that terrifies you, or just being dead?"" On <i>WIT'S  END</i>, he's come up with an answer; on ""Buried Alive"" he sings, ""If I'm  alive or dead I don't really care, as long as my Soul's intact."" He's  got soul to spare.</p></div>"|15343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15343-wits-end/|8.4|Ryan Dombal

The list of veterans with two-decade careers who aren't reiterating old formulas is even shorter. The <i>Revenue Retrievin'</i> series doesn't just cement E-40's legacy, it extends it. With four full-length LPs released in just under 12 months, the records are less a set of distinct statements than a data dump. It's several hundred megabytes of diverse and wide-ranging music whose sense of purpose is proportionate to its overwhelming size. The two most recent additions to E-40's creative renaissance, <i>Overtime Shift</i> and <i>Graveyard Shift</i>, are only vaguely conceptual. Instead, the idea seems to be for E-40 to create a panoramic view of street rap from as many narrative angles as possible.</p>
<p>The entire project suggests a profound level of confidence from E-40. Although there are tracks that seem like potential minor hits or have unique pop sensibilities, the trend-chasing days of 40's career appear to be over. Even T-Pain feature ""Serious"" seems more like a sincere attempt to highlight the singer's strengths, rather than a too-late bone thrown to a chart-rap audience. These are exceptionally balanced records, moving swiftly through a huge variety of production tics and songwriting styles. The meat comes courtesy of producer 40's son Droop-E, who has transformed the sound of hyphy's brief geographically-linked moment into E-40's personal house production style. But just when it seems like post-hyphy minimal bangers start to dominate, the acoustic bass-driven ""43"" switches gears into noir-ish atmosphere. Or ""My Money Straight"" arrives, a revival of the classic Bay area mob music sound with an invigorating verse from RBL Posse member Black C.</p>
<p>Most of the guests here come from the Bay area; rapper Beeda Weeda has a particularly impressive moment on ""In the Morning"", and rising star DB Tha General stands out on the striking ""Streets Don't Love Nobody"". When it comes to guests from outside the Bay, Bun B and Slim Thug's generically titled ""That Candy Paint"" is redeemed by euphoric production. ""Lookin Back"", which features Devin the Dude, is a nostalgic look at both rappers' transformations from struggling artists to successful career rappers. ""Fried"" features Tech N9ne, one of rap's more under-recognized grassroots success stories. For the most part, the guests seem chosen for their musical chemistry rather than any illusions about getting national club or pop radio play.</p>
<p>But E-40 remains the star, and no matter how consistent the songwriting is, it's his rapping that makes this record work. He sketches memorable characters, like ""My Lil Grimey Nigga"", the stick-up kid who was dropped on his head as a child, or the old ex-con who surprises two young hard-heads on ""Streets Don't Love Nobody"" (""Never know who heavy-duty in the streets pushing weight."") Many of the tracks here are archetypal street rap; ""I Love My Momma"" might seem like a hip-hop cliché at first glance. But E-40's lyrics are full of lived-in lyrical details and humorous asides that give his tracks a human touch, like his mother's ""famous banana-nut bread and 7-Up cake.""

The list of veterans with two-decade careers who aren't reiterating old formulas is even shorter. The <i>Revenue Retrievin'</i> series doesn't just cement E-40's legacy, it extends it. With four full-length LPs released in just under 12 months, the records are less a set of distinct statements than a data dump. It's several hundred megabytes of diverse and wide-ranging music whose sense of purpose is proportionate to its overwhelming size. The two most recent additions to E-40's creative renaissance, <i>Overtime Shift</i> and <i>Graveyard Shift</i>, are only vaguely conceptual. Instead, the idea seems to be for E-40 to create a panoramic view of street rap from as many narrative angles as possible.</p>
<p>The entire project suggests a profound level of confidence from E-40. Although there are tracks that seem like potential minor hits or have unique pop sensibilities, the trend-chasing days of 40's career appear to be over. Even T-Pain feature ""Serious"" seems more like a sincere attempt to highlight the singer's strengths, rather than a too-late bone thrown to a chart-rap audience. These are exceptionally balanced records, moving swiftly through a huge variety of production tics and songwriting styles. The meat comes courtesy of producer 40's son Droop-E, who has transformed the sound of hyphy's brief geographically-linked moment into E-40's personal house production style. But just when it seems like post-hyphy minimal bangers start to dominate, the acoustic bass-driven ""43"" switches gears into noir-ish atmosphere. Or ""My Money Straight"" arrives, a revival of the classic Bay area mob music sound with an invigorating verse from RBL Posse member Black C.</p>
<p>Most of the guests here come from the Bay area; rapper Beeda Weeda has a particularly impressive moment on ""In the Morning"", and rising star DB Tha General stands out on the striking ""Streets Don't Love Nobody"". When it comes to guests from outside the Bay, Bun B and Slim Thug's generically titled ""That Candy Paint"" is redeemed by euphoric production. ""Lookin Back"", which features Devin the Dude, is a nostalgic look at both rappers' transformations from struggling artists to successful career rappers. ""Fried"" features Tech N9ne, one of rap's more under-recognized grassroots success stories. For the most part, the guests seem chosen for their musical chemistry rather than any illusions about getting national club or pop radio play.</p>
<p>But E-40 remains the star, and no matter how consistent the songwriting is, it's his rapping that makes this record work. He sketches memorable characters, like ""My Lil Grimey Nigga"", the stick-up kid who was dropped on his head as a child, or the old ex-con who surprises two young hard-heads on ""Streets Don't Love Nobody"" (""Never know who heavy-duty in the streets pushing weight."") Many of the tracks here are archetypal street rap; ""I Love My Momma"" might seem like a hip-hop cliché at first glance. But E-40's lyrics are full of lived-in lyrical details and humorous asides that give his tracks a human touch, like his mother's ""famous banana-nut bread and 7-Up cake."" On the flip, ""Trapped"" is one of the most devastating tracks, a song that seems especially potent considering the state of America's <a href=""http://colorlines.com/archives/2011/03/prison_system_holds_more_black_men_than_slavery_did.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prison industrial complex</a>: ""I feel bad because all I've got is advice/ And I ain't got nothing to show for it, I'm in here for life.""

And they've been tirelessly productive, too, writing more solid songs in the past three years than many bands have in an entire decade.</p>
<p>One of my personal favorites is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhU65PAUdNo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What's His Shadow Still Doing Here""</a>, from the 2009 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13507-grey-eyed-girls/"" target=""_blank""><i>Grey-Eyed Girls</i></a>. The song is a relatively laconic take on 1950s guitar pop-- but by no means a straight-line take. A stuttering backbeat stays just a little out of step with overlapping guitars, as frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29099-tim-cohen/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Cohen</a> turns a tried-and-true lover's protest-- get over that other guy!-- into a slightly freaked-out observation: ""If he disappeared into the clear/ Then tell me dear/ What's his shadow still doing here?""</p>
<p>On their latest EP, <i>Secret Walls</i>, the Fresh &amp; Onlys further mine that sock-hopping sound, albeit with fewer alterations and a looser, more jammy approach. The production is cavernous, there are quite a few languid guitar solos, two cuts run over the four-minute mark (practically an eternity for these guys), and the closest thing to a bashed-out rave-up is the stormy closer, ""Poison Wine"", which sounds more like something you'd mope to than mosh out about. In a career that's been marked by slight left turns, the band has pulled its first true 180. It's a jarring change-up, and although they pull it off with remarkable ease, it might not appeal to those taken in by what Pitchfork's Marc Masters referred to as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7893-the-top-50-albums-of-2010/3/"" target=""_blank"">""non-stop hit parade""</a> of last year's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14736-play-it-strange/"" target=""_blank""><i>Play It Strange</i></a>.</p>
<p>As a career document, <i>Secret Walls</i> makes more sense when taking stock of Tim Cohen's solo outings. Last year's on-the-sly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14536-laugh-tracks/"" target=""_blank""><i>Laugh Tracks</i></a> and this year's more expansive LP/EP set <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15142-magic-trick-bad-blood-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Magic Trick </i>/ <i>Bad Blood</i></a> contained a fair amount of ramshackle charm, but they also served as a window to the starker side of his songwriting. There's a similar pallor hanging over <i>Secret Walls</i>; the answer to the question asked in the expansive, hollow ""Do You Believe in Destiny?"" involves heading to an island ""where life will be so lonely,"" while ""Wash Over Us"" ends a relationship in the stroke of a single couplet: ""I wouldn't want to feel that we are something we are not/ We're puppets and our bodies are painted on.""</p>
<p>The latter song is the strongest on <i>Secret Walls</i>, as its last two-thirds gently unspool into softly played keyboard, strung-out guitar lines, and the sound of Cohen's voice crooning and wailing in the distance. It's a neat trick, and it's one they've played before in briefer fashion on ""Arm's Advice"", the closer to the band's 2008 self-titled debut LP. The F&amp;O's aren't even close to repeating themselves at this point-- hell, based on this release, they could change it up again entirely next time (and knowing these guys, that could be as soon as tomorrow). I wouldn't mind another 180 myself, but if they stay on this bummed-out course, I won't be mad.</p></div>"|15341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15341-secret-walls-ep/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

One of those tapings made its way to every corner of the nerdisphere within the 24 hours that followed, while the other more or less disappeared into the void that is the Internet. Though their run through <i>GB City</i> jam ""Get Found"" was perfectly pugnacious, the <i>other</i> stint was backing exactly the kind of guys you want to back if web exposure's what you want right now: Odd Future bash bros and Fat Possum labelmates MellowHype.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a relatively staid, unorthodox showing on Bass Drum's part. While Hodgy Beats and Left Brain shared all sorts of voodoo, Colin (first names only) kept time and John kept his eyes glued to his guitar, hair completely obscuring his face, never to be flipped or tossed. That spooky riff he burrowed into was just right, though. While the attention was clearly drawn to their one-time, insanely magnetic bandmates, Bass Drum of Death find themselves blending into an increasingly crowded field of neo-classicist rock bands specializing in fuzzy assault. Their own label even released a few of their more immediate forebears.</p>
<p>One is Wavves' Nathan Williams, whose initial mixture of blown-out grunge nods and 1960s doo-wop melodies became the first in a slew of young, beach-obsessed artists hiding similar vocal hooks and rhythms in swamps of pedal-driven effects. But Bass Drum of Death's smashmouth approach also saddles them with easy comparisons to an even larger group of garage-rock kin. While they do dabble with the same arsenal of ooooohs and aaaaahs, ooooweeooooh's and shooby doo's that Williams has, this Oxford, Mississippi, duo sounds far more effective when whipping up an evil frenzy much like those of Ty Segall. These guys don't showcase a similarly thorough ear for songwriting, but as far as rock'n'roll feats of strength go, <i>GB City</i>, their debut, registers quickly.</p>
<p>Its first half in particular is exactly what you want to throw yourself into at a show. ""Nerve Jamming"" opens shop with a set of puckered power chord shifts every bit as stomach-churning as those in the titular track that follows. The aforementioned ""Get Found"" has snarl to spare here, while ""Velvet Itch"" features a devil-horned, almost industrial rumble to it in which John's vocal performance catches fire. ""I talk to Elvis, I talk to Elvis in my sleep,"" he scowls. ""He said I'm cracked out/ Oh yeah, I'm cracked out/ But at leeeeeast, I got no-where to be."" While <i>GB City</i>'s B-Side feels flimsy and empty by comparison, it also features the album's biggest hook (that of ""Young Pros"") and a song that feels like it could be this band's calling card: ""Spare Room"". It ganks that diamond-coated Phil Spector drumbeat we all know and slows it down to a hopeless crawl. They start tying it up in ropes of guitar and then-- low-end arrives in the form of a nasty, ridiculously feral five-note bass run that cracks the song open. What's inside is nothing but squall and darkness, not unlike everything their name suggests but only occasionally delivers.</p></div>"|15350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15350-gb-city/|6.2|David Bevan

Stuffed to the seams with wiry guitars, trembling keyboards, crashing beats, and Tim Gick's mad-man warble, it has the creepy tension of a post-punk haunted house where the Cramps, the Scientists, or Pere Ubu might leap out from the shadows at any moment. The band deftly balances precision and abandon-- every moment sounds lunatic and unhinged, yet no track collapses into complete anarchy.</p>
<p>That abandon has subsided a bit on <i>Mass Dream</i>, which doubles the length of its predecessor despite having only one more track. That's by design-- Gick <a href=""http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-04/entertainment/18374586_1_debut-album-band-album-deal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> that his intent was to ""space things out more, let the songs breathe."" And while I miss <i>Cold Fish</i>'s farther-flung moments, the band has countered that loss with songs that are deeper and more open. Now, along with all the post-punk echoes rattling around, unexpected reference points pop up. At times I hear the enervated drama of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's Ian McCulloch, or the stridency of Ian Svenonius during his Nation of Ulysses days. And TV Ghost prove as adept at <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/forcefieldpr/wired-trap-by-tv-ghost"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stark dread</a> as they are at fevered bedlam, mirroring the the spooky air of Women's <i>Public Strain.</i></p>
<p>Much of that air comes from Gick, whose vocal cracks and squalls guide each track toward a particular emotion, boldly coloring the sonic elements swirling around him. The resulting hues are often bleak-- as he <a href=""http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-04/entertainment/18374586_1_debut-album-band-album-deal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">puts it</a>, ""I look at the world around me, take what I don't like about it, and use that in my songs."" But that desolation produces not resignation or depression, but a kind of desperate, coursing energy. Much like a scary movie, TV Ghost's stressed-out tales don't get you down, they get your heart beating. And even if the pulse of <i>Mass Dream </i>is not as consistently maxed-out as that of <i>Cold Fish</i>, it's no less excited.</p>
<p>The example I keep coming back to is a cut buried deep into the LP, ""The Degradation of Film"". It opens with ominous chords that conjure a creaky organ echoing through an abandoned castle. Those chords threaten droney hypnosis, but the band pushes back against somnambulism, their guitars tracing dementia while Gick does his best Vincent-Price-on-helium shiver. Still, the chords persist, tugging at the band like quicksand. It's a tricky balance, one that TV Ghost could've easily steamrolled with speed and volume. But <i>Mass Dream </i>isn't that simple. Its power may sometimes be primal, but its effect is pretty complex.</p></div>"|15348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15348-mass-dream/|7.6|Marc Masters

After all, Autechre made their name by separating those dabbling in electronic music from the truly hardcore. Compared to the rest of Warp's early post-rave/home-listening acts, they were challenging from the start, and their releases only grew more complex and less user-friendly as the years went on. This box set collects 47 tracks from 11 years of Sean Booth and Rob Brown's hyper-productive output. If one EP of Autechre's dense sound art seems forbidding, try about a dozen of them.</p>
<p>And yet. Autechre's late-career complexity is in no way overstated. Albums like 2001's <i>Confield</i> sometimes threaten to abandon form and structure entirely for the pure delight of manipulating digital noise into an endless array of different shapes. Other records are so madly patterned, like multiple electro tracks layered into a writhing whole, that following the duo's logic can be nearly impossible. But perhaps nodding to their roots in club sounds, or having fun with the very idea of this sort of band releasing ""singles,"" Autechre's EPs have offered some of their most accessible music, even if you have to stretch the definition of ""accessible"" to the breaking point. Dizzying as it may be as a whole, this box is in a weird way one of the better introductions to the duo's work.</p>
<p>The earliest EPs here, 1991's <i>Cavity Job</i> and 1994's <i>Basscadet</i>, aren't far off from labelmate Aphex Twin's first forays into tweaked acid. ""Cavity Job"" opens with a blast of dental drill noise as abrasive as Whitehouse, but quickly launches into a frantic rave tune that would have fit just fine at the era's more hardcore clubs. The four ""Basscadet"" mixes are where things start to get hairy-- moving from jittery techno to haunted ambient-- but the duo's pulsing funk has yet to be shattered the way it soon would be. The average set of human feet may object to the logic of these beats, but they sure are head-nodders. And as far afield from the genre as they would eventually get, Autechre's love for early hip-hop's trunk-rattling low-end and turntable gymnastics are all over these EPs. ""Goz Quarter"" from 1997's <i>Envane</i> EP plays like a playful scratch record made from scraps of digital noise. They're reminders of a time when the borders of hip-hop and what was known (for better or worse) as IDM weren't so ruthlessly policed.</p>
<p>So there's plenty of pleasure here, but plenty of difficulty as well. As the years went on, Autechre became masters of bright melodies that they then drowned in distortion-- their own abstract variation on ""noise pop."" 1999's <i>EP7</i> might be their most beautiful release, but it's also one of their most disorienting, built from what seems like several hundred gigs worth of glittering little chunks of sound.  From then on, Autechre's music would be about things endlessly falling apart and rebuilding themselves and falling apart again in spectacular fashion. On ""Gantz Graf"", one of their most convoluted beat-and-riff creations becomes subjected to so much abuse that it collapses into screaming noise, as if the track itself is pleading for relief. There's a lot more to <i>listen</i> to in Autechre's later music, and a lot less to hang onto. The music constantly mutates, so it's hard to get bored, but if your attention drifts, it becomes ever harder to figure out how you got from one minute to the next. It's no wonder they were embraced as much by the free improv community around the turn of the millennium. It's music that invites a listener to boggle at its moment-to-moment inventiveness or tune it out entirely.</p>
<p>What's really surprising, listening back to these EPs after so many changes in techno style, is how fresh they still sound. Autechre were often praised for the ""alien"" quality of their music, the way they processed and distorted their synth sounds and programmed beats until they became unfamiliar, and in retrospect it was the best thing they could have done to ensure their music didn't date itself. Only the <i>Cavity Job</i> sounds truly bound to the era of its release. And even the elements that became IDM clichés, like all those thin, tiny beats bouncing madly around the mix, are underused enough now that younger listeners might just hear them as new. So many of the duo's peers have disappeared from the 21st century musical conversation, but Autechre persist. That's partly because they're workhorses who never stopped putting out records, but mostly, it's because even their most fearsome records have a striking beauty and weird compulsive listenability that few of their contemporaries could match.</p></div>"|15330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15330-eps-1991-2002/|8.0|Jess Harvell

In the month-plus since that tragedy, musicians worldwide <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42131-win-daft-punks-ferrari/"">have</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42070-vampire-weekend-les-savy-fav-members-male-bonding-ra-ra-riot-join-japan-relief-effort/"">been</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42018-bradford-cox-tunde-adebimpe-fennesz-tim-hecker-oneohtrix-grouper-on-japan-compilation/"">trying</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41930-sonic-youth-yo-la-tengo-lou-reed-rza-why-lindstrm-more-raise-money-for-japan-relief/"">to</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41993-morning-benders-jonsi-basement-jaxx-cold-cave-atp-primal-scream-more-raise-money-for-japan/"">help</a>. Along with benefit concerts, charity auctions, and other fundraisers, the music world's Japanese relief efforts have also included a few compilation albums, including the classical-oriented <i>Classics for Japan - Music for Healing</i> and hit-parading <i>Songs for Japan</i>.</p>
<p><i>Benefit for the Recovery in Japan</i> is a different kind of benefit compilation. Clocking in at nearly five hours, this sprawling 64-track set sees no contradiction between disaster relief and musical adventurousness. Credit Antiopic label co-heads David Daniell and James Elliott, experimental electronic musicians who picked the album's tracks with help from Regina Greene (whose Front Porch Productions books shows for many of these artists), fellow electronic experimentalist Greg Davis, and Thrill Jockey founder Bettina Richards. Their choices span ambient drone, fleet-fingered folk, and leftfield rock, with an artist lineup that should have many a music nerd drooling on their tattered back issues of <i>The</i> <i>Wire</i>.</p>
<p>Every cent of the $15 you spend on <i>Benefit</i> will go to Civic Force, a Japanese nonprofit emergency responder, so the cause is clearly worthy. At less than a quarter per track, this mp3-only album offers pretty good value for the money, too, and if you're skeptical you can <a href=""http://www.fina-music.com/catalog/index.html?id=105344"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stream</a> the whole thing. As for musical enjoyment, I definitely don't recommend trying to digest it all in one sitting, and the collection sometimes lapses toward seemingly aimless minimalist exercises more likely to please formally educated musicians than typical music listeners. But if you're looking for a thoughtfully conceived survey of the avant-garde underground, please, look no further.</p>
<p>A somber electroacoustic instrumental from Austrian composer/producer Christian Fennesz opens the compilation, which gives you a pretty good indication of what's to follow. These are thickly textured tracks, sometimes orchestral in scale, which often achieve their emotional effects more through their incredibly detailed sonic palettes than through anything you can transcribe in a songbook. It's a lot to take in, but give it time and the best part about this release is how it allows you to stumble into so many different, miniature sonic worlds, one after the other: the hypnotically layered vocals and bass-heavy pulse of School of Seven Bells, the barely there piano and whispery singing of Grouper, the heavily fucked-with 1980s soft-rock vibes of Matthewdavid, the squalling lushness of Lawrence English, the icier hum of Ben Frost, the articulately jagged punk of the Ex, and the shaggy improv of Jackie-O Motherfucker. <i>Benefit</i> is an appropriately cosmopolitan affair.</p>
<p>The names perhaps most familiar from the indie rock festival circuit are not necessarily the ones responsible for <i>Benefit</i>'s most rewarding tracks. An arty contribution from TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, working with Stars Like Fleas' Ryan Sawyer under the cheeky moniker Stabbing Eastwood, is probably best left for completists (and fans of hilarious growling). Deerhunter/Atlas Sound man Bradford Cox, collaborating with White Rainbow's Adam Forkner as Bradley &amp; Geofrey, gives Das Racist fodder for some future update of their reggae-voice satire ""Fake Patois""; you get the sense Cox has a hard drive full of casual little experiments like this he could post on his blog. Then again, there's an appealing frailty to the Arthur Russell-ish chamber-pop of ""In the Hollows"", by Dirty Projectors bassist Nat Baldwin. Akron/Family's ""Deep Kazoo"" does, indeed, get in deep with kazoo; Bear in Heaven's tenderly plainspoken ""The Days We Have"" is a glistening electro-folk pleasure that could warrant a Cornelius remix.</p>
<p>But <i>Benefit</i> isn't really about cherry-picking hits. There are other compilations for that. It's best if you let this one wash over you, accepting the breadth and depth of its varied sonic experiences with, yeah, an open mind and open ears. Plenty of listeners could get their first exposure to luminaries like Rhys Chatham (who closes the set's first half on an ambient, meditative note), Sam Prekop (though the Sea and Cake frontman's blips and bloops here are certainly no <i>Oui</i>), or the Boredoms (leader Shinji Masuko's airy, ethereal ""Botsuon""). Or they could be introduced to much-loved younger talents, from the densely intricate guitar playing of James Blackshaw to the hauntingly immersive sound fields of Tim Hecker to the spaced-out electronic innovations of Oneohtrix Point Never. Look, I'm dubious about benefit compilations in general, and the wanky wind-chimes avant-garde scene in particular. But if good things can ever come out of horrible events, what Antiopic has accomplished here is surely worth getting behind.</p></div>"|15329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15329-benefit-for-the-recovery-in-japan/|7.7|Marc Hogan

Childs, whose psychedelic outfit, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, called it quits five years ago, has continued to churn out similarly charming, distinctly unpredictable pop songs under his own name since. He's your wild card. Blake, whose vocal harmonies and melodic skillset you may have heard by way of his work in Teenage Fanclub, has been equally active over the years, though rarely on his own. He's a glue guy. Together they form what can (in certain circles) be loosely termed as a supergroup. But Jonny, their first full-length as a duo, doesn't approach that construct with much of a straight face. Although they've played and recorded together in the past, here they sound as though they're still finding out how to best combine their quirks.</p>
<p>Take for instance pub-rocking opener ""Wich is Wich"", a sub-two-minute boogie that functions more as curio than attention-grabbing salvo. While the groove is sturdy, its relatively short length doesn't allow it to leave much of a dent at all. It feels instead like a song that never quite became a song. While you'll find equally, confusingly short scraps on the tail end of Jonny (see: the country shuffle of ""I'll Make Her My Best Friend""), there's enough great songwriting at play here to make that kind of wham-bam-on-to-the-next approach all the more frustrating. On tape they can be just as good as they are on paper. The burble and harmonies of ""Candyfloss"" is proof of that.   Merge, their label home, has hailed their union as ""the advent of an irresistibly infectious new strain of psychedelic pop."" But Jonny retains the feel of old, familiar parts being slapped together to form something old and familiar. There's a good reason why these two have followings on their own.</p>
<p>Euros Childs' stamp on these songs is particularly strong, his Welsh-accented vocal tics and corkscrewing organ flourishes much more obtrusive in the mix than Blake's far more palatable contributions. In fact, the latter's long-developed ear for vocal harmonies is responsible for not only smoothing a lot of Jonny's edges, but also corralling his bandmate for some genuinely beautiful vocal performances. It's not difficult to discern who penned what throughout, but like the aforementioned ""Candyfloss"" (also, ""English Lady"" and ""Circling the Sun"" and ""The Goodnight"" and ""Never Alone"" and so on), Blake's gilded harmony arrangements lend a much-needed constant to an affair that sheds its skin from track to track. Aside from two very melodically inclined minds joining forces, what spurs Jonny to succeed in its own strange way is the audible heart and enthusiasm with which they try everything here. Sandwiched between what sound to be two more experiments in need of more time, ""Cave Dance"" is an experiment that drones on for 11 minutes. Eleven. From red-blooded rock circus to synth dream to Fleetwood Mac-indebted krautrock coda, it goes on and on and on. They're having so much fun.</p></div>"|15344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15344-jonny/|6.2|David Bevan

Girls Against Boys, Morphine, Urge Overkill-- these bands had little in common musically, but they all worked some variation on that particular vocal style. For whatever reason, it's gone almost extinct in indie rock over the past 10 years or so, but Young Widows frontman Evan Patterson is the rare guy who still sings that way. And for those of us who spent way too much time in our younger years devouring issues of <i>Alternative Press</i> and <i>Magnet</i>, that sort of voice is enough to bring back some powerful memories, regardless of what Patterson might actually be saying.</p>
<p>Ever since Young Widows rose from the ashes of the Louisville post-hardcore band Breather Resist in about 2006, most of their best moments have come from that sort of memory-shock: <i>Oh yeah,</i> this <i>is how bands used to get shit done</i>. Their rhythm section churns and sputters like pigfuck never went away. Patterson's guitar tone has a clangor that we don't hear too often anymore. The particular sort of tense groove that the band specializes in-- it's a relic of a bygone era. But after three albums of this stuff, Young Widows haven't really made much of an impression on their own. They sound dangerous, but it's danger by association.</p>
<p>The band's debut album, 2006's <i>Settle Down City</i>, remains their greatest moment-- a bracing blast of spilt-beer stink and ashtray grime. <i>In and Out of Youth and Lightness</i> finds the band switching up their style, stretching out into longer songs and going more for atmosphere than for brooding rock fury. At times, Patterson seems to strive for a certain Nick Cave depravity in his vocals and in his lyrics, and he never gets there. Some of his lyrics just sound silly: ""Shakin' that fire in your fist. Shakin'! <i>Shakin'</i>!"" The band used to keep a tight balance between tension and release, but moments of release rarely come on this album, and so the tension they work so hard to build never registers the same way. The album stretches nine songs over 48 minutes, and few of these songs needed to be as long as they are.</p>
<p>Still, these guys are all great musicians with serious chemistry and a strongly defined idea of what they want to be doing, so they can still conjure some serious intensity even when they're reaching for something that doesn't quite work for them. When Patterson stops singing and the band disappears into a gnarled, ugly groove, they become a potent force. And when they keep things hard and short, as on album standout ""Future Heart"", they still make a bluntly effective unit. Now that indie rock has moved on from these sorts of forbidding sounds, there's a hole out there that needs filling. And when the band really locks in, they fill it. Even if their whole style is essentially a throwback, there's plenty of room out there for throwback done right. But on too much of <i>Youth and Lightness</i>, they're not the machine they could be.</p></div>"|15342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15342-in-and-out-of-youth-and-lightness/|5.7|Tom Breihan

That might scan as a bogus bullet point, but given the subject matter of his outfit's fifth full-length, frontman and chief songwriter Adam Remnant seems to have a very strong attachment to the history around him. <i>Canary</i> is a 1930s museum piece and concept album centered around one Appalachian family trying to shoulder its way through the Great Depression. It's built on traditional American musics like gospel and bluegrass and blues-based rock, but it finds its spiritual roots in protest. And while its sonics and song structures are about as fresh as its subject matter, its attention to detail and local focus make for a singular achievement. That and they find the strength to see each moment quake.</p>
<p>Because despite the yellowed nature of Remnant's lyrical work (the word ""kin"" makes an appearance as does the Devil and the phrase ""give a lick""), throaty, contemporary folk-rock signifiers abound. In fact, his rolling vocal styling bridges the gap, fittingly, between Dr. Dog's Scott McMicken and Conor Oberst. While opener ""Curse of Canaanville"" saunters in at a pace in line with the former's band, it eventually erupts into a steam-powered surge not unlike one of Jeff Mangum's breaks. Elsewhere, ""Cold Front Blues"" cribs some melody from Oberst's early wailer ""Something Vague"", going a bit further to take on the torque of his wild-eyed delivery. ""Oh but Vera don't get sad/ I know things these days are bad,"" Remnant croons. ""They may take our land, our home/ All kinds of worse-case scenarios!""</p>
<p>But it's not always such a downer. Though <i>Canary</i> clearly suggests that yesteryear's nightmares aren't that different from today's, it also speaks with a great deal of hope. The titles of ""New Growth"" and slightly psychedelic ""At Least We Have Each Other"" alone communicate that. That said, one needn't have studied Greil Marcus and the Band or spent serious time at the Smithsonian to really chew on the images and roots at work here. All in all, this is pastiche that plays to very clear strengths. Whether it's fingerpicking and fiddles (""Mountain Child"") or piano-fueled strummers like the gorgeous ""Ruthie"", these arrangements and melodies prove Remnant's close attention to detail provides a great deal of support. While few really stand out on their own, together they lean on one another to impressive effect. As a result, it has the feeling of an album that really holds together. Now that's an anachronism.</p></div>"|15345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15345-canary/|7.3|David Bevan

On the new, <a href=""http://returnof4eva.com/music.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">free-for-download</a> mixtape <i>Return of 4Eva</i>, he invests the cars-and-girls talk he's already been doing with a sort of conscious-rap sensibility; toward the back end of the tape, he leaves behind boasting to talk about poverty and racism and materialism, sometimes coming up with a truly evocative line. But he's also lost some of the snarl that made his delivery so great on tracks like last year's Curren$y/Wiz Khalifa collab ""Glass House"". He can get a bit clumsy when he tries to transform himself into some kind of loverman. And even in his strongest moments, he still sounds a whole lot like T.I. without much of T.I.'s effortless, charismatic confidence. He could still become an excellent rapper, but it hasn't happened yet.</p>
<p>As a producer, though, he's good enough that he could be half a Ying Yang Twin and his music would still be well worth the hard-drive real estate. On last year's free online album <i>K.R.I.T Wuz Here</i>, he marked his place in a lineage of organic, soul-sampling Southern rap producers that includes giants like Pimp C and Organized Noize, making hard-thudding personalized version of the tracks he must've heard growing up. On <i>Return of 4Eva</i> (still free, still online), he progresses even further, turning his sound into a sleepier, woozier flutter-- a comfortable bed for his voice to sink into. Refracted versions of guitar and organ sounds wind their way through oceans of bass, all building into a perfectly evocative, nostalgic sound. Every once in a while, he'll come with something harder, like the skeletal keyboard bloops of ""My Sub"" or the horn-and-organ thunder of ""Sookie Now"". But for the most part, he focuses on turning classic Southern rap sounds into comfort-food background music-- the sort of thing that sounds absolutely gorgeous in a car on a warm spring afternoon, when you're driving slow with the windows open. There's a reason that <i>Return of 4Eva</i> dropped just as the weather was getting warmer.</p>
<p>In a sense, Big K.R.I.T. is like a hip-hop version of a group of rock revivalists. The same way that, say, Band of Horses turns dusty Neil Young guitar epics into something simple and comforting, K.R.I.T. trades on our collective memory of mid-90s Southern rap and turns that into brilliant invitations to nostalgia. At the end of ""Sookie Now"", we hear a sample of Don Draper philosophizing in ""Mad Men"": ""There is the rare occasion when the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash-- if they have a sentimental bond with the product."" K.R.I.T. included that sample to draw attention to his younger rap peers; he's the type of old soul who still complains about ""ringtone rappers"" sometimes. But it could just as well describe the Pavlovian attachment some of us have to a beautifully looped-up soul sample. And <i>Return of 4Eva</i> is absolutely packed with cascading looped-up falsetto harmonies. Sometimes, it feels like a set of variations on the beat for OutKast &amp; UGK's ""Int'l Players Anthem (I Choose You)"". And since ""Int'l Players Anthem"" is one of the greatest rap songs of the past 10 years, that's no complaint.</p>
<p><i>Return of 4Eva</i> doesn't have too many guests, but most of the people who do show up are Southern rappers who peaked maybe seven years ago: Chamillionaire, David Banner, even Ludacris on a remix of last year's ""Country Shit"". All those guys sound reinvigorated; K.R.I.T.'s amber-hued production gives them a context that just works for them. And one of the real revelations here is K.R.I.T.'s own singing voice. Taking on a few hooks himself, he's got a thoughtful, bluesy coo that seems custom-built for his tracks. It's fun to imagine what might happen if K.R.I.T. teamed up with an honest-to-god great rapper for a full-length. He and Yelawolf have been teasing a mixtape together for a while, and that could be incredible. But for now, <i>Return of 4Eva</i>, all glowing warmth and lazy-afternoon drift, stands as one of the finest rap releases of 2011.</p></div>"|15312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15312-return-of-4eva/|8.2|Tom Breihan

Minimal electronic music, mind you, is not rock when it comes to larger-than-life presences: Most of these guys look like bike messengers with better connections at the Apple store. But Pantha, who to that point had released two albums of bell-laden, dreamlike productions, seemed more like a techno vampire (I'll admit that his spooky/scary haircut had something to do with this). To date his peers have treated his work like you'd treat a historical structure: hands-off. Remixes and collaborations have been thin on the ground; for the most part, we aren't used to hearing Pantha's singular style deconstructed.</p>
<p>This is partially because Pantha is so completely out of step with electronic music trends. His work for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/labels/2147-dial/"">Dial</a> label could loosely be considered ""minimal,"" a style whose prominence was already fading in 2007 when Pantha broke through with his much-loved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10273-this-bliss/""><i>This Bliss</i></a>. We heard what happens when foreign bodies are introduced to Pantha's music on last year's Panda Bear collaboration, ""Stick to My Side"": The normally serene Noah Lennox sounded like a bull in a china shop amidst Pantha's compulsively orchestrated beauty.</p>
<p><i>XI versions of Black Noise</i> collects the various remixes that trickled out last year and adds several more for good measure. ""Stick to My Side"" features prominently, as no fewer than five artists take a swing at a track that dripped with potential but ultimately fell flat. If there's a lesson in <i>XI versions</i>, it's just how deft a touch it takes to grapple with Pantha's idiosyncrasies. Pantha has talented friends though, and the vast stylistic range of the remixers here helps compensate for the fact that they hardly cast a wide net for their source material.</p>
<p>It's encouraging when the big names come out throwing punches. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a> takes ""Stick to My Side"" and surrounds Lennox's voice with the type of psychedelic curlicues he uses himself. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a> take on the shifting, sighing ""Welt Am Draht"" and suffuse it with sour, humid vocals. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5347-efdemin/"">Efdemin</a> adds a backbone to ""Stick"", suppressing Lennox's vocals until they just barely peek through his smokey tech-house. Walls strip ""Stick"" of much of its beatific pulse and turn it into a hazy church song (or, roughly: a Panda Bear track). Others are less successful. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=moritz+von+oswald&amp;search_type=standard"">Moritz von Oswald</a> and Lawrence (one of Pantha's few distinct contemporaries) take on ""Welt"" and ""Stick"", respectively, but both offer more linear, soft-focus house variations that feel a bit mushy.</p>
<p>As such, <i>XI versions</i> works best as a companion for smitten <i>Black Noise</i> fans, and it offers a couple of nice moments that Four Tet and Animal Collective completists might want to keep in their back pockets. <i>XI versions</i> doesn't work as a full-length, but it still comes off as a curious win for Pantha (who, remember, didn't actually contribute any new music here), showing both how potently his work can be refashioned and how difficult it is to do so. Those whose interest was piqued by <i>Black Noise</i> are encouraged to seek out <i>This Bliss</i> or the rewarding works by Lawrence and von Oswald (as Maurizio). No one here fully owned Pantha's intricate castles of sound, but it's refreshing to hear them try.</p></div>"|15333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15333-xi-versions-of-black-noise/|6.5|Andrew Gaerig

Wrens and robins chirp. Standing against a graffiti-emblazoned gray brick wall, the scruffily bearded Dangerfield strums an acoustic guitar casually, almost haphazardly. Stewart, wearing a pair of white-rimmed shades you might see on one of Biff's <a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=biff+3d+back+to+future&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=941&amp;bih=621"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">henchmen</a> in <i>Back to the Future</i>, runs his drumstick along the bars of an iron gate-- gently, almost tenderly. Dangerfield's formidable falsetto soars through the space's cavernous reverb, dexterously communicating heartache. If you're in the right mood, it can be powerful stuff: an affecting mix of traditional earnestness and experimental impulses.</p>
<p>This uneasy balance between balladeer sentimentality and avant-garde adventurousness runs through the Guillemots' discography. On 2006 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9252-through-the-windowpane/""><i>Through the Windowpane</i></a>, which earned the four-piece a Mercury Music Prize nomination, these competing urges resolved themselves gloriously in songs like fragile opener <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=guillemots+%22little+bear%22&amp;aq=f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Little Bear""</a>, romantic ode <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22made+up+love+song%22+guilemots&amp;aq=f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Made-Up Lovesong #43""</a>, and northern soul shimmy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/6508-the-top-100-tracks-of-2006/8/"">""Trains to Brazil""</a>. But 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11408-red/"">Red</a></i> meandered through ambitious yet unremarkable Britpop. And Dangerfield's 2009 solo nod, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14028-fly-yellow-moon/""><i>Fly Yellow Moon</i></a>, suggested the band's schmaltzy side had conquered all. Never mind that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yATtdheYPzg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billy Joel cover</a>: <i>Walk the River</i> shows Guillemots still have a few eccentricities up their sleeves, though they remain a long way from their mid-2000s peak.</p>
<p>Guillemots' third album is mournful, lushly arranged, and conflicted as ever about whether it wants to be singer-songwriter comfort food or forward-thinking pop. The song from the video, ""I Don't Feel Amazing Now"", feels overdone, muddling its unspectacular, melancholy lyrics with the full studio gamut of strings and choral backing vocals. But first single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgUXb2RWsOs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Basket""</a> is a lot more effective, simultaneously a cryptic love song (""You knock me over/ Come on and do it again"") and a propulsive, kaleidoscopic assault on a culture where there's ""a masterpiece that no one bothered painting/ Everybody's too busy with those baskets of theirs."" Think of a grown-up Supergrass (there's theremin). The ominously ornamented title track is a sample-ready testament of survival, while the electronic sunshine of ""I Must Be a Lover"" offers a needed break from all the gloom.</p>
<p>For a band that once stood out for its <i>too-much-ness</i>, <i>Walk the River</i> now gives us too much of the wrong things: too many midtempo songs, too many minor-key acoustic strums, too many codas that outstay their welcome without really connecting. But Stewart's bustling drum work, MC Lord Magrão's rippling guitar, and Aristazabal Hawkes' sensuous bass-- even Dangerfield's supple voice, which might suit the band's namesake seabird-- ensure there's something interesting happening beneath even the most mawkish sentiment or the baggiest quasi-epic. Just not always something particularly new or vital, the way <i>Through the Windowpane</i> and its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3690-from-the-cliffs/"">predecessor EP</a> felt. That woodland video comes closest so far, so maybe the fresh air will do them some good.</p></div>"|15282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15282-walk-the-river/|5.9|Marc Hogan

Sprengelmeyer sings her self-doubt at the start of the second verse of ""The Heron and the Fox"", the quietly reflective, sadly nostalgic centerpiece of her stellar debut, <i>The Golden Record</i>. An Iowa native now living in Montreal and recording there with members of Arcade Fire, the National, and A Silver Mt. Zion, Sprengelmeyer sounds both worn from experience and inspired by something she can't yet imagine, the peripatetic sort who's old enough to be wise but young enough to be adventurous. That's the great thread that runs through this album, a perfectly mixed bag of graceful folk, coiled pop, and expansive art rock. Lyrically, Sprengelmeyer seems to yearn for the past; stylistically, though, she presses for a bold polyglot future of twisted contexts. Here, she gets both.</p>
<p>It'd be easy to separate <i>The Golden Record</i>'s 10 songs into a few orders: There are the mostly still drifters, like the gently swollen ""Black Cloud"" and the reverb-washed break-up of ""People is Place"". There are songs that rock and lurch, like the violin-trilling stomp ""Boatman"" and the snarling-and-smiling ""Cannons"". There are those experiments, like ""Guyegaros"", that fit neither. Segregating the songs, though, means selling Sprengelmeyer short as some manic amateur unable to unify or control her ideas. But most every move she makes as Little Scream is a good one: ""Cannons"" is as incisive and propulsive as the best of St. Vincent, an oft-occurring but fairly inadequate comparison. She sculpts guitar noise and synthesizer squiggles into a perfectly odd pop song that's as aggressive as it is endearing. The same goes for ""Red Hunting Jacket"", a somehow cheerful cavalcade of handclaps and guitar abrasion punctuated by a vamp of boogie-woogie piano and spiraling flute lines. The song itself is an excavation of forgotten memories from a relationship built on the run-- ""What can we communicate that won't just turn to dust?"" Sprengelmeyer sings, her band twisting deliriously beneath. A kick drum thunders through a scrim of noise and samples at the start of ""Your Radio"". It's the resolute beginning to a charged electric track that eventually rises to arena sizes, with tiered harmonies and a band whose trust in repetition pays off in a coda that suggests the Dead C scoring a battlefield scene. She brings the same sort of control to ""People Is Place"", one of those gentle tracks that builds over its four minutes to a gorgeous instrumental groan, glowing long tones breaking against a piano like waves against a shoreline. Each look is as convincing as the next.</p>
<p><i>The Golden Record</i> is a wide-open exploration of Sprengelmeyer's sensibilities, the introduction on which she's able to explore both her most spare and extravagantly orchestrated impulses. It's easy to imagine a scenario where, after a year or two of touring these songs, watching audiences respond, and feeling herself grow tired of certain tracks and maybe not others, Sprengelmeyer circumscribes herself as a writer, favoring a handful of styles versus the horde she delivers here. That's not necessarily a bad thing, either, as every approach sounds assured and evolved. There's no stylistic filler, no dilettante drivel badly in need of an editor. An album of Sprengelmeyer's quiet songs would be as welcome as a full-length of her quakes. For the time being, though, <i>The Golden Record</i> is the document of a real-life wanderer who sings about drift and regret, dreams and reality, in songs that know enough not to sit still. <i>The Golden Record</i> is an infinitely approachable and enjoyable welcome by an artist who sounds like she's here now, for the duration.</p></div>"|15338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15338-the-golden-record/|8.1|Grayson Currin

<p>On Shannon and the Clams' debut, 2009's <i>I Wanna Go Home</i>, Shaw and co-songwriter and guitarist Cody Blanchard added a rockabilly punch to the loosey-goosey garage-punk of the Growlers and early Black Lips records. Though the album was an all-around solid exhibit of Shaw's charms as a frontwoman and her chemistry with Blanchard, <i>Sleep Talk</i> is a refinement, a streamlining, an improvement in every way.</p>
<p>That spike in quality begins with the band's heightened versatility. While<i> I Wanna Go Home</i> split the difference between rumbling, rousing rock tunes and sultry slow jams, <i>Sleep Talk</i> is impressively diverse. Shaw wails and shouts her way through the dark proto-punk of ""Toxic Revenge"", conjuring the leather jackets of <a href=""http://maxskansascity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Max's Kansas City</a>, punctuated with a cacophony of saxophones. Album highlight ""Tired of Being Bad"" combines Shaw's captivating, emotive vocals with Apollo Theater soul, an unexpected but welcome match.</p>
<p>In addition to Shaw's ability as a singer and her infectious vocal tics-- she whoops and yelps all over ""Old Man Winter"", and her raspy growl on ""Done With You"" could strip the bark off of trees-- <i>Sleep Talk</i> benefits from some unique songwriting. ""The Woodsman"" serves as a striking R&amp;B murder ballad, while the production on the record-- which could accurately be described as ""dusky""-- will likely be mistaken as ""lo-fi"" when it's simply vintage, a common misconception for modern music recorded without the assistance of computers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on <i>Sleep Talk</i>, Blanchard exists as Shaw's equal counterpart. His guitar licks sound untrained but impressive, understated and effective but eager to cede the spotlight to the band's frontwoman. As a backing vocalist, Blanchard is arguably even better, adding a classic R&amp;B vibe to both ""Tired of Being Bad"" and the album's title track while bolstering ""Oh Louie"" with a cascading 1950s rock'n'roll baritone.</p>
<p>""Half Rat"" tests the band's use of dynamics by switching from diaphanous to rough-hewn and back, providing a stirring crescendo and fierce climax for the album-- replete with drum rolls, a galloping chorus, and everything coming apart at the seams by the song's finish. It's a kind of overview of <i>Sleep Talk</i>'s strengths, showing how productively Shannon and the Clams can combine grit and prettiness, how effortlessly they mix the salt with the sugar.</p></div>"|15336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15336-sleep-talk/|7.7|Martin Douglas

Their last proper album, 2005's <i>Human After All</i>, was poorly sequenced and way too long, full of tracks that were just blandly, grindingly repetitive. It was almost anti-pop but not in a truly out-there way. Good for DJs, in other words, and bad for those of us playing along at home.</p>
<p>Given their lack of interest in making pop records now, it's been unsurprising that much of Daft Punk's activity over the last half-decade has been about crafting raw material for remixing (including masterfully remixing themselves on 2007's live-album-meets-DJ-mix set <i>Alive</i>) and the cinema (including their foray into art-house territory in <i>Electroma</i> from 2006). Here then is an album that combines the two. When it was announced that DP would be recording the score for the <i>TRON</i> reboot, it seemed like the natural next step in the duo's 21st-century trajectory. A slick pop science fiction film, with a Disney-sized budget lavished on its special effects, would surely provide their lushest visual accompaniment yet. And while the symphonic elements of the <i>TRON: Legacy</i> soundtrack made it very different from <i>Human After All</i>, as a home-listening prospect it played out in much the same way. Not so much fun to listen to minus the film's visual razzle-dazzle, and primed for creative remixers to turn the results into something closer to pop.</p>
<p><i>TRON: Legacy Reconfigured</i> succeeds as much as most remix projects do, which is to say about 50% of the time, and without Daft Punk's name attached to the project it's doubtful it would have attracted much attention. The list of remixers sure doesn't inspire much confidence, at least if you're not afflicted by a serious case of 1990s nostalgia.  From Paul Oakenfold to Photek to Moby to the Crystal Method, it's full of names whose best work (using the phrase very loosely in some cases) is a decade or more behind them. If Daft Punk shaped a lot of the past 10 years, whether via indie kids glomming onto <i>Discovery</i> or brutalist dance-rock producers picking up from <i>Human After All</i>, much of <i>Legacy Reconfigured</i> seems sonically stuck in the late-90s era of super-clubs and ""all-star"" remixes on CD single.</p>
<p>The best tracks here are hugely unsubtle pop-dance tunes with big acid-meets-electro riffs-- in other words not too dissimilar from from what DP were peddling circa <i>Homework</i>. That's not a negative, of course. The Crystal Method's redo of ""The Grid"" is cheesily anthemic and unabashedly <i>big</i> in a way that's sadly rare these days, and Oakenfold's ""C.L.U."" has a sturm-und-drang epicness that the original soundtrack approached rarely. Much of <i>Legacy Reconfigured</i> is what many of us were actually hoping for from the actual <i>Legacy</i> score, and from Daft Punk in general: grandiose electronic pop full of bombastic hooks, without the genteel orchestral touches that felt like a lame cop to Hollywood tradition.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>Legacy Reconfigured</i> can't keep that intensity up across a whole disc. Plenty of these remixes are just inert filler. Oddly, many of the weakest remixes are by younger producers, like Teddybears' ""Adagio For Tron"", which could be any squelchy and interchangeable French dance single of the past five years. Who knows, maybe the new jacks were cowed by working with material from a group they consider a formative influence rather than just peers. In any event, taken as a whole, what we're left with is a solidly middle-of-the-road project building off a solidly middle-of-the-road movie score. The best you can say is that <i>Legacy Reconfigured</i> is less disappointing than <i>Legacy</i> itself. No one expects much from Paul Oakenfold these days, so it's a pleasant surprise here. But it's hard not to expect more from Daft Punk, even with how often they've missed in the last decade.</p></div>"|15317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15317-tron-legacy-reconfigured/|5.0|Jess Harvell

For O'Death, at least, it's the New York bit that tends to trip people up: It's easy to feel distrustful of (real or imagined) hipster mobs, and to feel proprietary about music as raw and unpretentious as the classic country and folk O'Death mine. And while these days every band that enlists a fiddler gets subjected to an Americana litmus test-- Are they southern? Are they poor? Are they really wearing overalls? Are the overalls real?-- the thing about folk music is that it's impossible to render inauthentic: Inclusiveness is its crux. Most bygone genres are too inextricably tied to their respective times and places to ever really be ""revived,"" so what gets trotted out, instead, is an approximation of a feeling-- and hey, that's just art.</p>
<p>For O'Death, the feeling in question is urgency: They've always been revved-up and eager, but <i>Outside</i>, the band's third full-length, is also earnest and persuasive, a collection of intensely personal, intricately assembled folk songs. The best of these tracks plead for your attention: Opener ""Bugs"" is soft and heartbreaking (""I know that days don't come back, please believe in me,"" Greg Jamie sings, his voice high and plaintive), unfurling like a lost Elliott Smith track. It's a sentiment that's revived on the heavy, rhythmic ""Pushing Out"", which contains a line (""This year could last forever, this year could never start"") instantly familiar to anyone who's ever had a long, cold, ennui-laden New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Most of O'Death's prior releases were about a kind of lunatic energy; <i>Outside</i> is more studied, and its references are broader (besides the Americana they typically pull in, there's plenty of world music at work here, from Balkan folk to Klezmer). The band's 2009 tour was interrupted when drummer David Rogers-Berry was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer. After a course of chemotherapy and a shoulder replacement, O'Death returned to play a triumphant set at the Newport Folk Festival the following summer, and that sense of redemption (and optimism) ultimately keeps <i>Outside</i> from ever feeling defeated. Songs that begin forebodingly resolve themselves (""Back of the Garden"", ""Ghost Head""); the sun rises again; the world is still big and full of sound.</p>
<p>Ultimately, O'Death's instrumentation (banjo, fiddle, ukulele) and name (it's taken from an ancient Appalachian dirge that's been reinterpreted by everyone from Ralph Stanley to Sam Amidon) can feel like something of an albatross. Sure, the band is rooted in American folk, but they're also adventurous listeners and composers, and <i>Outside</i> is unclassifiable in the same way records by northern contemporaries Beirut and Man Man are unclassifiable-- folk music, it turns out, is a broad and fluid thing.</p></div>"|15315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15315-outside/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

The producer, whose real name is Matthew McQueen, runs the sound-collage cassette imprint Leaving Records, and as a musician, makes tracks with little regard for traditional structure and composition. His texture-heavy style takes the already blunted traits of West Coast instrumental hip-hop (blown-out beats, woozy atmospherics) and jumbles them up even further to build something uniquely psychedelic.</p>
<p>McQueen's debut full-length, released on pal Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder imprint, throws a bunch of ideas on the table at once-- you've often got tape hiss, field recordings, warped bass, and scratchy ambience all rubbing elbows in the same song. It's a heady, no-holds-barred approach to production that's sometimes very appealing. On a track such as ""Like You Mean It"", which is grimy and dubstep-leaning but fleshed out with strings and vocal samples, there's this cool kaleidoscopic quality, like spinning the radio dial between three or four vaguely similar stations at the same time.</p>
<p>The flipside is that with so much swirling around, <i>Outmind</i> can feel disjointed and even kind of exhausting. I don't think it's an error in execution-- it seems McQueen wants to keep edges frayed to reinforce the record's hallucinatory vibe. Take ""Cucumber-Lime"", all gurgling and ambient-- there's an undercurrent of melody that wants to match up with the rolling beat but is always about a half step behind. It doesn't congeal into something more substantial-- and maybe that's McQueen's point, to keep things loose and process-driven-- but to these ears, the song sounds half-formed.</p>
<p>It can be hard to shake this unfinished quality, especially on quieter interstitial pieces like the weirdly minor Flying Lotus collaboration ""Group Tea"". What ultimately makes up for these shortcomings, though, is that when these songs are working, they really don't sound like much else. The warbling psych-pop-meets-crunching post-dub of ""Being Without You""? That thing could warrant its own subgenre. His ambition and willingness to try just about anything in the quest for new, weird sound combinations here is commendable. So even when McQueen stumbles, it's exciting to hear him lay it all out there.</p></div>"|15334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15334-outmind/|7.0|Joe Colly

Acting as a sort of house band for the Underwater Peoples label (they formed when Real Estate needed an opening act at a party), the four-piece has played the background while its brother and sister acts-- Real Estate, Andrew Cedermark, Beach Fossils, Julian Lynch-- found their niche and made their names. Now with their self-titled debut, Family Portrait look ready to finally come into their own, distilling the essence of UP's familiar fuss-free garage jangle while carefully crafting their own unique voice.</p>
<p>Though the album doesn't start out that way. Opening mid-tempo tracks ""Glide Part I"" and ""Wait"" are worrisome red herrings that find Family Portrait rehashing the same weary sounds they have (quite charmingly) half-assed on one-off singles and EP splits in the past. But what follows is anything but bland: While it's easy to describe their sound and play connect-the-dots with similar bands, it has a strange magic, an unmistakable allure you can't quite put your finger on, that makes music this simple so very satisfying.</p>
<p>Credit co-producer Julian Lynch, who injects his own personality into a few of these tracks, showcasing reverb-rippled guitars and the watery textures that have peppered his own recordings. (Lynch's most recent full-length, <i>Mare</i>, feels like a relevant touchstone here.) In particular, the gorgeous ""Instrumental"" gets a necessary boost from Lynch's explorations. But he also knows when to leave the group alone. There's a reason for Family Portrait's reputation as a really <i>fun </i>band-- when they're rolling, like on ""Other Side"" or ""Killer Statements"", it's best to just hit record and try to capture some of their intense, one-take energy.</p>
<p>Family Portrait's other secret weapon is frontman Evan Brody. He's not a great singer by any stretch, and his voice is often drowned out in the mix (a symptom of the record's organic production). But Brody knows how to drag out a vocal hook (see the mirrorball-speckled prom waltz ""Come Back to Me""), and his enthusiasm is contagious on the sun-burnt paisley-pomp of ""Interlude - Never Should've Been There"". He's clearly a guy who, even when his group is playing second-fiddle, couldn't be happier doing anything other than singing in a band. And now with this solid debut, it's safe to say he's got himself a really good one.</p></div>"|15301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15301-family-portrait/|7.3|Zach Kelly

The group began in 2006 as glitchy electronic smirkers, proffering a garishly irreverent take on chinstroking IDM. Yet for their third full-length effort, <i>The English Riviera</i>, they've fully transitioned into a sleek, urbane pop-rock outfit, taking polished cues from the well-heeled likes of Steely Dan and Phoenix.</p>
<p>The subtraction and addition of band members during that time surely played a role, yet Metronomy have largely always been the baby of singer and multi-instrumentalist Joseph Mount. And while the music Mount and his comrades are making might sound a lot different from what they were turning out at the group's inception, the two sounds do have a philosophical kinship. There's a significant amount of deliberation apparent in both sonic approaches; as loopy as ""early"" Metronomy may have been, when you're making electronic music mostly without words that isn't meant for the dancefloor, craft is necessarily going to be a major selling point. Likewise, finely calibrated pop-rock invites an appreciation of its studio-sculpted contours.</p>
<p>As you'd imagine given that description, <i>The English Riviera</i> is an extremely listenable album, starting with ""We Broke Free"", an exquisite, low-slung slice of 70s studio rock redolent of Boz Scaggs and the Dan. That seductively contented vibe pervades much of the record, including ""She Wants"", ""Loving Arm"", and the waltzing ""Trouble"". While still vigorously scrubbed, songs like ""Everything Goes My Way"", ""The Look"", and ""The Bay"" reflect dance and indie sensibilities, aligning those efforts more closely with the likes of Phoenix, Hot Chip, Junior Boys, and Stars. But where Steely Dan's lounge-lizard odes were laced with irony and venom, and where the springy pop of Phoenix is animated by giddy energy, Mount's immaculate compositions remain mostly inert. Almost all of the songs on <i>The English Riviera</i> sound great, yet few of them really emotionally or physically involve the listener, and there's little to take away besides an appreciation of that effortlessly attractive sheen. Metronomy deserve a ton of credit for so quickly and satisfyingly mastering a sound that's so disparate from the band's origins. However, the group hasn't quite figured out how to animate its precise creations with personality or passion, suggesting they'd be best served by not immediately leaping to another sonic identity with their next release.</p></div>"|15337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15337-the-english-riviera/|6.4|Joshua Love

Garbus is blessed with an extraordinary voice, and she wields it with great confidence, always coming off in total control of her phrasing while seeming totally uninhibited in her expression. There's an authoritative quality to her voice-- she often sings with a commanding, full-bodied boldness, but even at her softest, Garbus sounds assertive and forthright.</p>
<p><i>w h o k i l l</i>, Garbus' second album as tUnE-yArDs, delivers on the promise of her 2009 debut, <i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i>. Unlike that album, which she recorded almost entirely on her own using a digital voice recorder and the sound editing program Audacity, <i>w h o k i l l</i> was mostly made in traditional studios in collaboration with bassist Nate Brenner, engineer Eli Crews, and a handful of other musicians. The music benefits from the increased professionalism, but Garbus has not abandoned her lo-fi aesthetic. As on <i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i>, Garbus layers sound to create a patchwork of contrasting textures. This time around, the greater clarity allows for more exaggerated dynamics. This is most apparent in ""Gangsta"", a carefully arranged track that evokes danger and fear with bluntly abbreviated blasts of horn noise and sounds that cut in and out erratically like a set of headphones with a busted wire or a cell phone that can't hold its signal. On the opposite end of the spectrum, she creates an almost unsettling intimacy on ""Wooly Wolly Gong"" by mixing the ambient hum of room sound with closely mic'd arpeggiated chords and vocals.</p>
<p>Brenner's presence on bass is the biggest difference between <i>w h o k i l l</i> and <i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i>. His style is loose and jazzy, with fluid, melodic lines that add dimension to Garbus' compositions. She sounded so isolated on <i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i>, but suddenly her music is like a conversation, with Brenner's parts bouncing off her voice and rhythms like thoughtful banter. He brings a janky funk to ""Es-so"", a zippy groove to ""Bizness"", and a delicate weight to the airy ""Doorstep"". On ""Powa"", his lead lines slink around Garbus' slo-mo rock riff as if in a subliminal duet with her expressive vocal performance. That song builds steadily over the course of five minutes until it reaches a stunning climax in which Brenner's bass bounces gently as Garbus hits a glorious high note like a feral Mariah Carey.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>w h o k i l l</i>, Garbus confronts thorny issues of race, gender, body image, and privilege in ways that are pointed but nuanced. She mostly sticks to personal narratives, suggesting big ideas and complex tensions in her subtext while emphasizing the urgency of small moments and concrete details. She's most direct in the opening cut ""My Country"", in which she wrestles with guilt over her own privilege, but she's more thought-provoking when in murkier, more ambiguous territory, like when she sings about a sexual fantasy involving the brutal cop who arrested her brother in ""Riotriot"" or when she wonders aloud why she does not have more black male friends at the end of ""Killa"". Garbus is particularly fascinated by violence; most of the tracks on <i>w h o k i l l</i> deal with power struggles that arise from inequity and lead to further cruelty and injustice. Her lighter moments are still quite complicated-- she playfully wrestles with negative body image in ""Es-so"", while that same lingering disgust and self-doubt brings a moving subtext to ""Powa"", an ode to a lover who can get her to momentarily let go of stress and insecurities.</p>
<p>Back in 1983 Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon <a href=""http://www.fodderstompf.com/ARCHIVES/REVIEWS/gordonritz.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote an essay for <i>Art Forum</i></a> that suggested that when we go to rock performances, we pay to see other people believe in themselves. A lot of what makes <i>w h o k i l l </i>and tUnE-yArDs' excellent live performances so compelling is the degree to which Garbus commits to her ideas and displays a total conviction in her personal, idiosyncratic, high-stakes music. This, in and of itself, is very inspiring and empowering. This unguarded, individualistic expression encourages strong identification in listeners, so don't be surprised if this record earns Garbus a very earnest and intense cult following.</p></div>"|15321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15321-w-h-o-k-i-l-l/|8.8|Matthew Perpetua

If you've been following along with the twists and turns of noisy ambient music these last few years, this collection of elements may sound familiar, possibly bordering on cliché. But it's all in how you fit the pieces together. Despite sharing characteristics with a lot of other current music, Harris' has a distinctive sound that she pretty much owns. These short LPs, released at the same time and that share an overall aesthetic, sound beamed in from another realm, and they also sound like they could have come from no one else.</p>
<p>Part of the distinctiveness can be traced to Harris' voice, which floats above the music and can sound delicate and shrouded and mist and can also evince an approachable earthiness. Particularly on <i>Alien Observer</i>, she layers her voice in a way that occasionally brings to mind Julianna Barwick, but Harris sounds comparatively distant and less immersive. Her voice haunts these songs instead of leading them; it's a presence and not a personality, and the voice and instruments are in balance, serving each other without any one element becoming more prominent.</p>
<p>The other aspect that sets Grouper apart is an approach to sound that feels somehow both cruder and more sophisticated than the majority of the lo-fi crop. It's crude in the sense that it seems to hearken back to the dark, home-recorded songs of an earlier era. David Pearce's music as Flying Saucer Attack, recorded mostly during the 1990s, was often referred to as ""rural psychedelia,"" and that description would fit this pair of records. This music feels both spacey and expansive and also oddly intimate and grounded, the work of someone who has mastered her tools and knows how to get the most out of them. The sophistication comes from the care in presentation. This music doesn't sound like it was built from mistakes or thrown together, it seems precisely ordered and arranged even while it's often muffled and warbly and distorted. Every sound exists for a reason.</p>
<p><i>Alien Observer</i> is the more accessible of the two discs, and also has a slightly better arc.  The opening ""Moon Is Sharp"" begins one of those impossibly beautiful vocal drones that just tears out your insides, as Harris begins in shapeless ethereality and gradually finds her way to an unadorned but breathtaking melody. The title track does away with the drone and puts Harris' vocal over a quivering keyboard line. On ""Vapor Trails"" and ""She Loves Me That Way"" the record turns a few shades darker, but a twinkling music box melody that opens ""Mary, on the Wall (Second Heart Tone)"" feels like awakening from an uneasy sleep, groggy and halfway hallucinating as you re-enter the world. The closing ""Come Softly (For Daniel D)"" feels like a proper conclusion, as Harris' naked voice over a skeletal keyboard figure gradually disappear over the horizon.</p>
<p><i>Dream Loss</i> is heavier on the distortion and EQ, and with an atmosphere that alternates between the hissy, open drift of the stratosphere with the thick, all-encompassing immersion of the ocean floor. The tracks here feel less like songs and more like moods, studies, and shapes. ""I Saw a Ray"" flirts with noise music, with a bit of industrial grind added to the held tones, while ""Soul Eraser"" seems to crumble into dust and regenerate itself simultaneously.</p>
<p>Harris has indicated that the two records, dating from different periods (the tracks on <i>Dream Loss</i> are older), have threads connecting them. They certainly feel like companions. <i>Dream Loss</i> is only slightly less engrossing than its counterpart, and the differences are minor. But placed on a continuum, these records highlight how 2008's luminous <i>Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill</i>, her last full-length album, was an unusual entry in the Grouper catalog. That record was built almost exclusively with acoustic guitar and voice, and the songs had an ancient air to them, like they'd been carved into petrified wood with a hammer and chisel.

If you've been following along with the twists and turns of noisy ambient music these last few years, this collection of elements may sound familiar, possibly bordering on cliché. But it's all in how you fit the pieces together. Despite sharing characteristics with a lot of other current music, Harris' has a distinctive sound that she pretty much owns. These short LPs, released at the same time and that share an overall aesthetic, sound beamed in from another realm, and they also sound like they could have come from no one else.</p>
<p>Part of the distinctiveness can be traced to Harris' voice, which floats above the music and can sound delicate and shrouded and mist and can also evince an approachable earthiness. Particularly on <i>Alien Observer</i>, she layers her voice in a way that occasionally brings to mind Julianna Barwick, but Harris sounds comparatively distant and less immersive. Her voice haunts these songs instead of leading them; it's a presence and not a personality, and the voice and instruments are in balance, serving each other without any one element becoming more prominent.</p>
<p>The other aspect that sets Grouper apart is an approach to sound that feels somehow both cruder and more sophisticated than the majority of the lo-fi crop. It's crude in the sense that it seems to hearken back to the dark, home-recorded songs of an earlier era. David Pearce's music as Flying Saucer Attack, recorded mostly during the 1990s, was often referred to as ""rural psychedelia,"" and that description would fit this pair of records. This music feels both spacey and expansive and also oddly intimate and grounded, the work of someone who has mastered her tools and knows how to get the most out of them. The sophistication comes from the care in presentation. This music doesn't sound like it was built from mistakes or thrown together, it seems precisely ordered and arranged even while it's often muffled and warbly and distorted. Every sound exists for a reason.</p>
<p><i>Alien Observer</i> is the more accessible of the two discs, and also has a slightly better arc.  The opening ""Moon Is Sharp"" begins one of those impossibly beautiful vocal drones that just tears out your insides, as Harris begins in shapeless ethereality and gradually finds her way to an unadorned but breathtaking melody. The title track does away with the drone and puts Harris' vocal over a quivering keyboard line. On ""Vapor Trails"" and ""She Loves Me That Way"" the record turns a few shades darker, but a twinkling music box melody that opens ""Mary, on the Wall (Second Heart Tone)"" feels like awakening from an uneasy sleep, groggy and halfway hallucinating as you re-enter the world. The closing ""Come Softly (For Daniel D)"" feels like a proper conclusion, as Harris' naked voice over a skeletal keyboard figure gradually disappear over the horizon.</p>
<p><i>Dream Loss</i> is heavier on the distortion and EQ, and with an atmosphere that alternates between the hissy, open drift of the stratosphere with the thick, all-encompassing immersion of the ocean floor. The tracks here feel less like songs and more like moods, studies, and shapes. ""I Saw a Ray"" flirts with noise music, with a bit of industrial grind added to the held tones, while ""Soul Eraser"" seems to crumble into dust and regenerate itself simultaneously.</p>
<p>Harris has indicated that the two records, dating from different periods (the tracks on <i>Dream Loss</i> are older), have threads connecting them. They certainly feel like companions. <i>Dream Loss</i> is only slightly less engrossing than its counterpart, and the differences are minor. But placed on a continuum, these records highlight how 2008's luminous <i>Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill</i>, her last full-length album, was an unusual entry in the Grouper catalog. That record was built almost exclusively with acoustic guitar and voice, and the songs had an ancient air to them, like they'd been carved into petrified wood with a hammer and chisel. These records are closer to the narcotic drift of earlier records like 2007's <i>Cover the Windows and the Walls</i>. But it all feels like Grouper, and whether she's working in realm of rough-hewn folk or amniotic drift, this is music that takes you places.</p></div>"|15332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15332-a-i-a-alien-observer-a-i-a-dream-loss/|7.7|Mark Richardson

The soupy low-end and skittering hi-hats of a 2006 Hyperdub side made the ideal soundtrack for a sense of encroaching doom-- whether it was Burial's affecting desolation or a bracing dose of Kode9 &amp; the Spaceape. The teamup of Hyperdub's flagship producer with the earthen-voiced poet resulted in an underappreciated full-length, <i>Memories of the Future</i>, which shot chest-collapsing bass and gutter synthesizers  through firebrand reggae. Their next prominent collaboration was a cover of the Specials' ""Ghost Town"" that appeared on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13614-5-five-years-of-hyperdub/"" target=""_blank""><i>5: Five Years of Hyperdub</i></a> and made the already grave original sound like a Less Than Jake song by  comparison. If there are standard-bearers for dubstep's more  evocatively disquieting tendencies, it's these two.</p>
<p>Given how many trends have shifted in the past five years, it's not worth debating how <i>Black Sun</i> fits in the current post-Blake, post-Rusko, post-Magnetic Man landscape. Instead, the album has the tricky but crucial task of keeping an archetypal strain of bass music part of an increasingly busy conversation. It does that to an extent, but a few key  changes to the partnership's approach prove how much the formula can stretch. The duo's tension-driven personality has been preserved, but the tweaks are  noticeable-- instead of sinking into a single-minded atmosphere  of futurist foreboding, the music is more sprightly and intricate, adding subtle stylistic retorts to the production's more  aggressive traits.</p>
<p>An easy case study would be to compare the 2009 version of the album's  titular single with the ""Partial Eclipse Version"" that appears  here. The original track was a bit of a left turn  at the time-- woozy 8-bit drones and a  funky-inflected rhythm. Revamped here, its frantic rush is dialed  down just enough to amplify the old-school Detroit feel that was overpowered in the original mix-- less a panic attack than a nervous glance over  the shoulder. The deceptively simple beats for ""Love Is the Drug"" and  ""Otherman"" set  dissonant, uneasy chords against sturdy, upbeat funky house rhythms, forcing otherwise unpredictable melodies into an offhand catchiness. And with its sizzling  analog synthesizer decay, ""Kryon"", the  beautiful album-closing collaboration with Flying Lotus, feels less like a gratuitous  guest spot and more like a culmination of <i>Black Sun</i>'s equilibrium  between pressured propulsion and elegiac calm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Spaceape still resonates, thanks to a voice suited for slow-burn  tension and corrosive damnation. This time around it's less smothered in filters and reverb, giving him a little more clarity. Whether he's abstracting a harrowing  physical breakdown (""Black Smoke"") or sprinting through war-zone  resilience (""Bullet Against Bone""), the Spaceape finds a way to make even the most  severe lyrics hit as slickly and nimbly as the snare rolls he  weaves through. Tension and anxiety don't always have to be cavernous  and austere, and <i>Black Sun </i>reveals a way for dubstep's vanguard to express their more ominous impulses in a  way you can still dance to, no matter how the steps change.</p></div>"|15310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15310-black-sun/|7.7|Nate Patrin

The Seattle band managed to sell 10,000 copies by word of mouth alone, which is impressive for any unsigned act, especially in this economic and business climate. They're touring relentlessly and have landed some enviable opening gigs for Vampire Weekend and, ahem, Dave Matthews. The result is a deal with Sub Pop and, inevitably, a re-release of their debut.</p>
<p>That would be a remarkable story if the album were innovative or intriguing, if it offered some new take on Pacific Northwest folk-rock, if it had personality beyond its success. Instead, <i>The Head and the Heart</i> is a lackluster mélange of vaguely old-time instrumentation, wan gospel harmonies, and heart-always-on-sleeve songwriting. Jon Russell and Josiah Johnson trade off lead vocals, each trying to out-earnest the other, while Charity Thielen's violin traces placid swirls around the melodies. But it's Kenny Hensley's piano that distinguishes the band and broadens their palette, for better or worse. He injects some much-needed pomp into ""Ghosts"" and ""Heaven Go Easy on Me"", goosing these songs out of their tasteful torpor. On the other hand, he constantly falls back on the tactic of repeating chords to convey general drama, which recalls Coldplay more than Tin Pan Alley.</p>
<p>The band's name is intended to emphasize both emotion and intellect, yet so many of these songs fall flat in both aspects. They're capable lyricists, although prone to lapses in judgement. ""I wish I was a slave to some age-old trade,"" Russell sings on ""Down in the Valley"", ""like riding 'round on railcars and working long days."" Neither of those examples truly qualifies as an ""age-old trade,"" and the implication of indie slumming may have some listeners clicking Move to Trash before the first <i>Elizabethtown </i>chorus. The song is a travelogue that goes nowhere at all.</p>
<p>Such nods to history and to hard labor are meant to give this album the sheen of authenticity, but it doesn't take long to see through to the calculation beneath. Musically, the band's old-time approximations resemble the Avett Brothers, but, without that group's effortless harmonizing, easy melodicism, and demonstrative vocals, the Head and the Heart sound anonymous, their drama wholly predictable. Conceptually, they're close to Mumford &amp; Sons: opportunistic in their borrowings, yet entirely unimaginative in the execution. Theirs is a thoroughly timid, tentative take on Americana: roots music without the roots.</p></div>"|15314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15314-the-head-and-the-heart/|3.8|Stephen M. Deusner

Excluding the man's sartorial fixations, the name seems like an ill fit. Throughout his decade-long career, he's been seemingly averse to the process of tightening and self-editing, instead choosing to stuff every idea that pops into his head into misshapen, often uninteristing bursts of sound. As a result, his discography is less impressive for its breadth (at least 10 full-lengths and countless more EPs in 10 years) than it is for its lack of a single coherent, enjoyably listenable statement. At this point, it's understandable if folks interested in the sort of experimental-leaning music that Darlington trades in have simply left him be, assuming he would never make an album worth listening to more than once.</p>
<p>It's a pleasant surprise, then, that Darlington's made his first truly decent-sounding album with <i>Bespoke</i>. Thematically, the record takes a few cues from cosmopolitan house and stuttering techno figures, but anyone walking in from off the street (or a club floor) expecting a dance-leaning record might as well turn back around; this <i>is</i> a Daedelus record, which means ""form"" and ""unification"" are dirty words around these parts. The whole thing is an enjoyable mess, and when this record is really cooking, listening to it has the pleasurable effect of someone messing with a radio dial.</p>
<p>Save for beat-scene wunderkind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28739-baths/"" target=""_blank"">Baths</a>' misguidedly low-key and maudlin take on ""French Cuffs"", the guests that have been rounded up add personality to the schizo-phonic stew. Bilal, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5113-the-bird-and-the-bee/"" target=""_blank"">the Bird and the Bee</a>'s Inara George, and multi-instrumentalist Amir Yaghmai (monikered here as Young Dad) deliver heartily-- in the case of the first two, their voices slightly outshine the material they're layered over. It's fast-rapping abstractionist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/512-busdriver/"" target=""_blank"">Busdriver</a>, however, who really steals the show with a disarmingly crooned delivery on ""What Can You Do?"".  The last time Bus and Dae teamed up was for 2003's <i>The Weather</i>, a sporadically interesting mess of broken beats and over-syllabication; comparatively, Busdriver sounds smooth and free here, riding alongside the track's cab-seat-techno melodic stabs and jazzy flourishes.</p>
<p>As if Darlington simply couldn't help himself, there are moments of overindulgence on <i>Bespoke</i> that veer close to self-sabotage; the jarring drum breaks on ""One and Lonely"" severely disrupt the song's monastic solitude. The insanely repetitive, previously mentioned game show horns on ""Sew, Darn, Mend"", on the other hand, sound like the result of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Your_Luck"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Press Your Luck""</a> contestant futilely shouting ""No Whammy!"" after the cameras stop rolling. Overall, though, <i>Bespoke</i> is a rare success for Darlington, and it couldn't have come at a better time. For the last year and change, the increased recognition of folks within L.A.'s beat scene has come with co-signs thrown in his direction: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> released Darlington's last effort, last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14127-righteous-fists-of-harmony/"" target=""_blank""><i>Righteous Fists of Harmony</i></a> EP, on his <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> imprint, and Darlington's mentor-like position in Baths' career breakthrough established his position as a tastemaking listener. Now, he finally has some good music of his own attached to his name. It may or may not be enough to catch up to the rapidly accelerating talents of his younger peers-- but it's certainly a start.</p></div>"|15331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15331-bespoke/|6.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

Not long after Nirvana dissolved in April 1994, following Kurt Cobain's suicide, Grohl was offered the opportunity to back Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. For him, a Petty fan, that was a dream job. Though he would drum with them during a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZRn2iXLdg0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Saturday Night Live"" performance</a> later that year, Grohl ultimately declined, to start over from scratch and do what he's still doing today: <i>front</i> a band.</p>
<p>At the time, that decision was probably daunting. Grohl had already spent some time in a Seattle studio recording a humble demo tape that would become Foo Fighters' debut, one for whose release rights major labels were already grappling. But the sizable shadow cast by Cobain and the weight of his legacy and death was immense. This week, coupled with <i>Wasting Light</i>, their seventh full-length, Foo Fighters have been screening their new, somewhat revisionist, sometimes 3-D retrospective documentary, <i>Back and Forth</i>. There's some great footage early on during what was Grohl's very first tour (opening for Mike Watt) with his brand new band. There, despite having never heard any of the yet-to-be-released Foo Fighters songs, young Nirvana fans were showing up early and in numbers. ""Marigold!"" they'd scream out between songs, in hopes of hearing the one Grohl-penned Nirvana tune there was. He never played it.</p>
<p>The idea of Grohl opening for anyone now seems just as ridiculous as him having to field requests for anything but one of the two dozen modern rock hits he's released since. But in <i>Wasting Light</i>, Grohl is attempting to come full circle. The plan was to go back to basics, in a few ways: 1) record the album to tape in Grohl's San Fernando Valley garage, 2) hire famed <i>Nevermind</i> producer Butch Vig to man the boards, 3) bring former Germs, Nirvana, and Foo Fighters guitarist Pat Smear back into the mix, 4) have founding Nirvana member and bassist Krist Novoselic down from Seattle to guest on some of the recordings. As Grohl says during <i>Back and Forth</i>, before recording began in earnest, ""I love that we're going to make an album at home. It's going to sound like it was recorded in a house. I know it will.""</p>
<p>It doesn't. In fact, said garage was built with the arena in mind, and as a result <i>Wasting Light</i> sounds just as mammoth and capable of knocking out teeth as anything Foo Fighters have recorded since the late 90s. That's more a product of force than hooks. As evidenced by the opening roar of ""Bridge Burning"" and ""Rope"" or metallic uppercuts of ""White Limo"", the new, three-guitar attack in place provides a wallop that wasn't there before. Vig is renowned for sugaring up recordings, but here, the aim seems solely about knocking down walls. Front to back, <i>Wasting Light</i> meets that cause with lean, workmanlike aplomb. Grohl's screams haven't registered this dangerously, gleefully shredded in years-- if he was hoping to exorcise some demons, it sounds as though he made that happen.</p>
<p>But Foo Fighters' long-standing foundation has been built on fist-pumpers. While <i>Wasting Light</i> features a host of worthy set-openers, few prove to be as sticky or memorable as any number of their previous singles. There just isn't a melody or hook to really amplify. Those songs here that hold tightly to Grohl's long perfected, quiet-LOUD formula and crescendos-- see: alt-rock lullabies ""Arlandria"" and ""These Days"", or the pop-punk door-to-ass closer ""Walk""-- come closest to matching the energy of his best work. In theory, as a form of therapy, it still works. Former Hüsker Dü frontman and fellow 80s punker Bob Mould guests semi-audibly on the Zeppelin-like crunch of ""Dear Rosemary"" and then of course, there's Novoselic's turn on ""I Should Have Known"", where the latter's bass sounds as round and bowling ball-heavy as it did on Nirvana's ""Sliver"".</p>
<p>There's a scene not long into <i>Back and Forth</i>, when Grohl remembers, ""People really resented me for starting this band, for making music they thought 'sounded just like Nirvana.' What? You mean loud rock guitars? Melodies? Cymbals crashing? Big-ass drums? Well, that's what I do."" It's true. He always did. It's just that, this time out, it's his melodies that are missed most.</p></div>"|15328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15328-wasting-light/|6.4|David Bevan

The shift in strategy is minor, but those rhyming images speak to the 25 years separating these two albums: 1986 could be eons ago, or it could be yesterday. Those were the days of miracles and wonder, as Paul Simon entered his forties with humor and curiosity intact. These days, however, haven't been too kind: Even as his influence has grown, his output has suffered. After opening the millennium with the dull-by-obligation <i>You're the One</i>, he hired Brian Eno for 2006's <i>Surprise</i>, whose true surprise was that one of the most careful and rigid pop songwriters of the last 50 years could be just as rambling and self-indulgent as any other aging Baby Boomer.</p>
<p>To his considerable credit, however, Simon has never succumbed to a record with Rick Rubin or a Great American Songbook album, perhaps because his standards aren't pre-rock pop tunes. While there was a period when his South African and Brazilian excursions in the late 1980s were derided as exploitative, both <i>Graceland </i>and <i>The Rhythm of the Saints</i> have proved enormously influential to a new generation of indie-pop songwriters from the Shins' James Mercer to Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig. Simon, who turns 70 this year, is still forging his own path even this deep into his career and remains devoted to and fascinated by old R&amp;B, gospel, and world music. <i>So Beautiful or So What </i>blends them all into a pop sound that's simultaneously laidback and spry, almost self-consciously alluding to his past triumphs.</p>
<p>Replacing Brian Eno, long-time cohort Phil Ramone co-produces, and the pairing is comfortable, if not complacent. They've corralled a small band to suggest a live-in-the-room intimacy and spontaneity, and ""Rewrite"" and ""Love Is an Eternal Sacred Light"" crackle with energy. Some of the ambient elements from <i>Surprise</i> remain, but they're couched in the earthy rhythms of the percussion and the spidery guitars. His voice still strong, Simon shows off his own fretwork more prominently, especially on the short, sweet instrumental ""Amulet"". Only the sampled sermon on ""Getting Ready for Christmas Day"" sounds out of place; contemporary listeners may be more likely to connect it to Moby's pre-millennial techno-folk than to its true source material, a 1941 sermon by Reverend J.M. Gates.</p>
<p>Even as his band gets smaller, Simon's ideas grow larger. He's addressing enormous spiritual matters, specifically the nature of God. In ""Love and Hard Times"", He and Jesus show up for a surprise inspection of Earth, and it's a bit too precious until Simon interrupts and turns it into a sweet love song about love songs. God Himself narrates ""Love Is an Eternal Sacred Light"", bemoaning that humanity doesn't get his jokes, and Simon sounds more at home in His head than in those of the various New Yorkers who narrate ""Getting Ready for Christmas Day"" and ""Rewrite"".</p>
<p><i>So Beautiful or So What</i> can be stodgy in its emotions and a bit too devoted to its motifs, but there's something humanizing about the album's shortcomings. It is, thank God, no attempt to get his affairs in order, an approach that turns so many older artists' albums into solemn, end-of-life affairs. Simon's not worrying over redemption on these spiritual inquests; he's much more concerned about what he'll do in heaven once he gets there. Turns out, he'll be listening to his favorite American tunes. In ""The Afterlife"", ""Be-Bop-a-Lula"" and ""Ooo Poo Pah Doo"" form a celestial language, which may be the album's most satisfying revelation.</p>
<p>Those reference points-- Gene Vincent and Jessie Hill, not to mention Ramone, <i>Graceland</i>, and King's assassination on the title track-- all well predate Y2K, which is not unexpected for an artist who spent half of the previous century making music. Simon's too preoccupied with the 20th century to settle into the 21st, but here's the thing: It suits him. After foundering when he tried to sound new and modern, Simon comes across as much more at ease and compelling in this familiar setting. He's like a novelist revisiting the particulars of his youth; like Norman Mailer and Philip Roth, he wants to take in his times, and like John Updike, Simon cherishes small epiphanies, which resound like bombs in the marketplace. So perhaps the epiphany of <i>So Beautiful or So What </i>is that Paul Simon turns out to be a character in a Paul Simon song: An aging songwriter still struggling to connect, still figuring it all out, and still cranking the Dixie Hummingbirds.</p></div>"|15326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15326-so-beautiful-or-so-what/|6.7|Stephen M.

Just most of us. Whatever the medium, but especially in music, the most outlandish stuff tends to come first. But this natural swing toward calm and control can be hell on musicians who made their names playing startling, violent, or unhinged music. That sort of ragged intensity is tough to maintain over the long haul; many bands don't even want to, whatever their fans might say.</p>
<p>Despite a 30-year career and a deep discography, Meat Puppets are always going to be defined in the minds of many listeners by their first three albums, which caromed from thrashing hardcore to psychedelically tweaked country-punk to beautiful rustic psychedelia. With records that singular, it's unsurprising that people might want more like them, even if Meat Puppets stopped sounding like that unstable-but-melodic band long before they first broke up. Three albums into their career reboot and it's pretty clear that the Puppets have no desire to return to that sun-zonked creative zone, or even to the more traditional (if still wild) boogie rock they made in their second phase. Like all the music the Puppets have made in the last 10 years, <i>Lollipop</i> lacks even the occasional kick of their 1990s major label albums. At this point you can take these newest Puppets albums for what they are, or ignore them.</p>
<p>The band had already pointed to the more laid-back direction their career might take as early as album number three, <i>Up on the Sun</i>, a collection of super-loose melodic jams that was both amazingly skillful (check out that guitar) and woozily unconventional (check out those song structures). That looseness and wooziness is nowhere to be heard on <i>Lollipop</i>. As with its two 21st-century predecessors, the album's full of highly polished <i>songs</i>, the sort of gentle country rock and folk-y ballads that aging alt-rockers have always turned to. Tempos stay steady and mellow. Curt Kirkwood is still a fleet and inventive guitarist, but he's far less likely to spiral off into reverb-soaked insanity, though there are hints of the old madness in the solos he briefly unleashes on ""Baby Don't"" and ""Hour of the Idiot"". And for a band that made a virtue of vocals that croaked and cracked and refused to stay in tune, the singing here is once again smoother than anyone could have expected back in 1984.</p>
<p><i>Lollipop</i> is a bit of a step up from 2009's <i>Sewn Together</i>. The ballads are less maudlin, for one thing; ""Town"" is as achingly sad and good as this sort of thing gets. And for a band that once blasted its hooks to bits, the Puppets have embraced the stick-in-your-head tunefulness that always lurked under the skronk and blare. But the problem remains the same: Where their records once strained and burst from too much wildness, now they threaten to get so competent they'll go flat. There are plenty of great tunes here, just not much character. <i>Lollipop</i>'s as catchy as your average power-pop record, but still hardly as essential as the band's peaks.</p></div>"|15323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15323-lollipop/|6.5|Jess Harvell

And much of the time, Sonny Smith seems to be making more music and having more fun than anyone else. About a year ago, his band Sonny and the Sunsets released the sweet, inventive album <i>Tomorrow Is Alright</i>, and Smith then followed it up with his ""100 Records"" art installation, in which he wrote and recorded an absurd <i>200 songs</i> for 100 fictional bands. While he was at it, he issued an EP for one of those fake bands, Earth Girl Helen Brown. And now, after that furious burst of activity, we get the Sunsets' sophomore album. That's Lil-Wayne-in-2006 levels of productivity.<br/><br/>But Smith never sounds like someone rushing to crank out literally hundreds of songs. His songs have an enormously appealing loose, homespun quality-- muffled, refracted, self-aware takes on the starry-eyed, innocent sounds you hear coming from oldies radio. Smith's voice is warm and laconic; you can practically hear a goofy stoner grin on his face a lot of the time. He allows himself a few guitar solos, but unless the song is an instrumental, he likes to keep them to three seconds or less. A lot of the fun in his records is hearing him interact with his backing vocals-- wordless ooh-ahh harmonies on some songs, equally flat female interjections on others. The whole thing sounds like something they could've bashed out in a long afternoon, killing time waiting for a midnight screening of <i>Rock 'n' Roll High School</i>.<br/><br/>This, then, is simple, low-stakes music, but it's simple and low-stakes music done extremely well, with clever touches that don't always reveal themselves on first listen. Plenty of tiny instrumental flourishes show just how deeply Smith and his band have studied their oldies-radio fare: The lightly tribal floor-tom rumbles on ""She Plays Yoyo With My Mind""

, the nifty little surf-guitar riffage on ""Home and Exile

"", the heartbroken jangle on ""Pretend You Love Me"". And Smith has a lyrical mischievousness about him, too. One line on ""Don't Act Dumb"" sums up four decades of lovesick garage-rock frustration in a few words: ""I'm in love, love with you baby/ I am dumb and so are you."" And ""Teenage Thugs"" has to be one of the first punk songs in history that doesn't identify with juvenile corner toughs but with the grown adult weenies who are afraid of them.<br/><br/>Many of Smith's defining qualities-- his self-deprecating lyrics, his easy way with melody, his ability to make bashed-out and idiosyncratic music out of ancient forms of pop-- unites him with another wave of Bay Area bands. In Smith, I hear a lot of the Bay Area pop-punk of the early 90s-- bands like the Mr. T Experience, Samiam, even very early Green Day. And like MTX frontman Dr. Frank, he knows how to convey confused-teenager feelings in smart, adult ways. With <i>Hit After Hit</i>, he's made 11 more charming and knowingly primitive bursts of sunny fuzz. He's got plenty more left in him. And as much fun as it could be to watch him grow as an artist, part of me hopes he stays his lane and keeps making these sugary jangles forever.</p></div>"|15324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15324-hit-after-hit/|7.7|Tom Breihan

Take for instance Jamaica, a retro-obsessed Parisian duo with a thing for unabashed pop anthems, who recently broadened their commercial appeal Stateside by having their single featured in a car ad. So yes, it's safe to say that Jamaica have a great deal in common with Phoenix, and their debut <i>No Problem</i> does its best to try and capture the star-making magic that those other French pop luminaries uncovered with their last LP, <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</i>. The differences between the two records, however, is more important: <i>No Problem</i> is a debut in the most uninformed sense of the word, showcasing mostly bland, same-sounding songs in serious need of some personality or spark.</p>
<p>The duo (Antoine Hilaire and Florent Lyonnet) enlisted Justice's Xavier de Rosnay and Daft Punk's sound engineer Peter Franco to handle production duties, and on the single ""I Think I Like U 2"", it seems like the big-name help came in handy. It's a song that's a little cheesy and way too excited, but in the way that really sharp, fun pop music can be without feeling too patronizing or dopey. As familiar sounding as it is (even the lyrics-- ""She was never pretty, she was only young""-- feel like stolen goods), it works, plain and simple. If we give Jamaica the benefit of the doubt, everything else on <i>No Problem</i> is then, in some way, cut from the cloth of ""I Think I Like U 2"", and it's a sensible, if not unambitious, plan of attack. But not a single one of the resulting songs captures the same kind of ebullience and fluidity, instead opting for choppier structures that, in most cases, seem bent on keeping people <i>off</i> the discotheque floor.</p>
<p>You can hear bits of de Rosnay and Franco here and there-- those mile-long, metallic KISS riffs that Justice are so fond of appear on ""Secrets"", especially-- but the songwriting here is so pat, and the songs themselves are often indistinguishable from one another. Most of the production tricks even feel wafer-thin and can't save material this bone-dry. The swaggering cock-rock tribute (""By the Numbers""), the half-hearted Elton John Xerox (""She's Gonna""), the numerous blown-off choruses, all these problems can't overshadow the simple fact that as these songs become so increasingly repetitive, their derivative qualities are mere footnotes.</p></div>"|15316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15316-no-problem/|5.2|Zach Kelly

Well, kinda. Sorta. Not exactly. For one thing, genres like dubstep and funky have been moving away from the club fringe and toward the center of the pop conversation for a while now. (In the UK itself, they've been at the center for some time already.) Dubstep sonics, however toned-down or disguised, can be heard in all sorts of chart music these days. And now we have a full slate of <i>singers</i> with (sometimes very loose) connections to bass culture, several of whom have released albums in 2011 aimed as much as folks who need songs as folks who obsessively collect dubplates.</p>
<p>Thing is, and not a little ironically, the singer whose songs have the strongest <i>sonic</i> connection to UK bass is also the most pop, Katy B, where the hard-hitting drums and wobbler bass effects are sweetened by her I-wanna-be-a-star delivery. Meanwhile, dubstep fans, juiced on the weird rhythmic experiments of his early singles, have been scratching their heads trying to figure out why James Blake's album so firmly lashed itself to the mast of indie-crooner culture. And in the middle, we have Jamie Woon.</p>
<p>Almost the exact middle, actually. Young and school-trained London singer Woon's debut album, <i>Mirrorwriting</i>, sits between Katy B and James B, pop theatricality and singer-songwriter calm, club culture and bedroom indie, old-school soul and modern electronic R&amp;B, extroverted and introverted. And tying it all together is the language of UK bass. His first major single, 2010's justly lauded ""Night Air"", announced him as one of a number of young English artists for whom garage, and everything that came after, was just another bit of pop language to use. And from the slow-motion jungle syncopations and muted bass blare of ""Street"" to the stuttering retro-rave breakbeats that drive ""Spirits"", the computer-assisted Woon makes sorta-pop from the last 20 years of UK dance the way current U.S. guitar kids draw from surf-rock and girl-groups.</p>
<p>But if that's <i>all</i> Woon was doing, he'd be just another indie one-man-band with a full software suite, making specialist music with materials from stuff with more pop-appeal. A couple things about <i>Mirrorwriting</i> make you wonder though if Woon really is destined for crossover success. One is his voice, which is the instrument that turns many of these songs from sorta-pop to real-deal pop. Much has been made that Woon went to the same school that gave us Amy Winehouse. His delivery is low-key for most of <i>Mirrorwriting</i>, far from her roadhouse belting, but the guy's clearly got chops, and an elastic way with a number of styles.</p>
<p>And unlike a lot of guys making a murky late-night brand of indie-soul right now, Woon's pleasingly warm and smooth tone, mixed mostly up-front with little obscuring reverb or distortion, gives you the feeling that he could have a straight R&amp;B career if he wanted. His restraint and lack of melisma trickery seems more like a choice to fit the slow drift of the music, not a limitation, and his use of HTDW/Blake style heavily processed vocals is careful, like Burial samples deployed as background harmonies. Woon wants these songs to appeal to folks for whom digitally tweaked singing is an occasional fun special effect, rather than the whole draw. And while the album's mostly full of left-field R&amp;B, there are also hints of Hall and Oates, 80s Brit synth-pop, house, and more. There's also an occasional and unfortunate tendency toward limp VH1-ready MOR ballads, which it must be said comprises the album's weakest stuff, though thankfully Woon doesn't indulge this side as much as a truly crossover-minded hack might.</p>
<p>Woon's attempted to bridge so many opposed vibes here that you'd want to praise his ambition, even if he couldn't pull it off. The fact that <i>Mirrorwriting</i> really <i>does</i> manage to blur so many different musical worlds into something so smoothly unified is Woon's real achievement. But because of that very in-betweenness, <i>Mirrorwriting</i> is still likely to rankle genre partisans of all stripes. Too slick and synth-heavy and modern for fans of Winehouse-style retro-soul. Too subtle for true dubstep fans wanting more club thunder. Not subtle enough for those heart-on-sleeve beat weirdos who've made James Blake a cause celeb. So it'll be interesting to see if it really is the wide mass of pop and indie listeners that winds up embracing Woon's everything-at-once approach. Whoever his audience turns out to be, Woon's managed one assured and beguiling hybrid of UK bass pressure and slick blue-eyed soul.</p></div>"|15309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15309-mirrorwriting/|8.0|Jess Harvell

That question was tossed around quite a bit back in 2008, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5753-crystal-stilts/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Stilts</a> emerged as one of the more interesting acts in the lo-fi Brooklyn jangle-pop pile. On the band's debut LP, 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12381-alight-of-night/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alight of Night</i></a> (as well as the preceding Woodsist-co-released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11469-crystal-stilts/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled EP</a>), frontman Brad Hargett often sang in a tone-wary, bass-heavy voice, his vocals cloaked in enough echo to nearly smother his dark incantations. However, you didn't really need to know what he was saying (or, for that matter, what key it was supposed to be sung in) to dive deep into the lonely, dark, and difficult-to-inhabit world of <i>Alight of Night</i>. The band's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/33848-cmj-thursday-jessica-suarez/"" target=""_blank"">somewhat standoffish early live shows</a> further suggested the presence of a complicated aura. Even as the clouds began to break with 2009's excellent single ""Love Is a Wave"", there was still a fair bit of vague menace hanging over what the Stilts were doing.</p>
<p>The murkiness continues to recede on the band's sophomore effort, <i>In Love With Oblivion</i>, but the menace mostly persists-- only, here it feels less introverted and more vivacious, largely due to Hargett's improvements as a lyricist. Save for the macho bellowing that stains ""Blood Barons"", he's a smarter, more descriptive presence here, whether he's bemoaning losing a winter's love to the ""Silver Sun"" or surrealistically describing a disappearing act on ""Through the Floor"". He can be funny, too-- like on ""Invisible City"", when he sings about crawling into a sarcophagus with a girl before repeating, like a too-clever suspect in the interrogation room, ""We know what happened at death/ But I don't have to say why."" This is all, of course, only when you can understand him-- reverb still abounds, and whether this is a feeling triggered by lack of comprehension or listener fatigue in 2011, it comes off as a hampering effect.</p>
<p>The cavernous echo that places distance between Hargett and everything else seems especially out of place when taking into consideration how damn good the rest of the band sounds. Joining up with David Feck, frontman of indie pop vets <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/804-comet-gain/"" target=""_blank"">Comet Gain</a>, for last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14772-cinema-red-and-blue/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled LP</a> as supergroup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29126-cinema-red-and-blue/"" target=""_blank"">Cinema Red and Blue</a>, clearly served them well, as the singular chugging force that ran throughout <i>Alight of Night</i> is replaced here by tight intra-band cohesion and playfulness. You can practically hear the tightly coiled guitar line and insistent rhythm in ""Invisible City""  snap against each other, while all the elements contained in ""Half a Moon"" sway in unison without congealing into a grossly blaring whole. Also, for a band that might never escape the ""lo-fi"" tag, this is a surprisingly ornate and atmospheric record. The jarring effect of the lovely, reedy woodwind melody that emerges from within ""Flying into the Sun"" is offset by barely there harpsichord dithering that creates an enticing depth of sound, while the elegiac horn that briefly moans in the middle of the unfortunately titled ""Alien Rivers"" adds an affecting touch to the otherwise turgid, seven-minute-plus dud. Songs open with creaking bug noises, car crashes, shivering tonal squelches-- they're thinking not just about the song but also how to sing it, in a sense, and the commitment shows.</p>
<p>What about that voice? Well, as a vocalist, Hargett's definitely made some positive strides. And yet, you wish he'd work up the confidence here to embrace his surprisingly affecting upper register, which was showcased best on the EP's highlight ""Converging in the Quiet"". When that song made it over to <i>Alight of Night</i>, it was under a different title (""Departure""), and Hargett had dipped into a flatlined, momentum-killing vocal black hole. The fact that this is a pick-and-choose kind of band after only a handful of releases is telling, though: Like their contemporaries and the bands of the past that they lovingly borrow from, Crystal Stilts are a band meant more to be cultishly admired than embraced as ""big ticket"" or any of that nonsense. If, like me, you're one of the admirers, then there's plenty to like here. If not, well, give it a shot anyway-- who knows, you might find something you like.</p></div>"|15304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15304-in-love-with-oblivion/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Brandt Brauer Frick is probably the best known in dance circles, performing thumping, techno-inspired grooves with lineup of harp, strings, mallets, and other acoustic instruments (as well as the requisite laptop and 808 handclap). But there are also Nicolas Jaar, Wareika, dOP, and Kadebostan, among others; Elektro Guzzi, signed to Stefan Goldmann's Macro imprint, splits the difference between minimal techno and math rock with just drums, electric guitar, and effects. Hauschka's <i>Salon des Amateurs</i> is the latest addition to the canon. It has been made primarily with prepared piano, with understated contributions from múm drummer Samuli Kosminen and Calexico's John Convertino and Joe Burns.</p>
<p>It might seem like a bold move coming from Hauschka (Volker Bertelmann), a musician who's best known for intimate, classically inspired recordings for chamber ensemble or prepared piano-- hushed, pretty, and sometimes bordering on precious. The point hasn't been lost on Hauschka himself, who spells out his status as an interloper in the self-effacing title. (It also refers to a club in the artist's native Düsseldorf where he presents an annual piano festival.) But he needn't have: <i>Salon des Amateurs</i> is an inspired reverse engineering of house and techno's fundamentals, replacing the music's familiar circuitry with steel wire and felt pads.</p>
<p>By design, it's not <i>really</i> house music: There's no rhythmic quantization or bottom-heavy kick drum to appease club DJs. Compositionally, too, these songs are more ambitious than most club tracks, given to the kinds of harmonic changes that don't lend themselves to DJ tools. But it's not <i>not</i> house music, either. Despite varied rhythms and tempos across the album, steady 4/4 grooves are the norm. All the songs share dance music's fondness for
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ring pedal tones and a
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
long, arcing shape, even if the mood and the style range from minor-key funk to steppy tango to all-out pastoral bliss. This is the kind of music you could imagine being played by DJs like Dixon, Âme, or Optimo-- DJs who know how to recognize dance music's essential thread, no matter how wooly the garment.</p>
<p>There are two main instruments here, Hauschka's piano and his computer. (Occasional percussion, horns, accordion, and bass synthesizer add color.) The piano he prepares, in the tradition of John Cage, with any number of small objects-- paper clips, clothespins, a packet of Tic-Tacs-- inserted between strings or laid across them in way that provokes strange, tinny timbres and harmonics. (You can watch him prepare his piano in a fascinating <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2010/11/11/131245315/hauschka-gets-the-most-out-of-88-keys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">series of videos</a> on NPR.org.) Thus the piano, or a few notes of it, anyway, can come to imitate growling synthesizer bass, congas, and spluttering ride cymbals.</p>
<p>The computer is used as a multitrack recorder, allowing him to build each song in a succession of parallel lines. There is very little evidence of digital post-processing; it sounds, for the most part, like he has played each part in full in real time, rather than cutting and pasting phrases and fragments into a post-hoc collage. (For anyone interested in a really close examination of his method, you can download all 20 multi-track parts to ""Ping"" from <a href=""http://www.junodownload.com/remix_hauschka/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Juno</a>.) It sounds, for lack of a better word, organic. I don't mean that in a loaded way; some great electronic dance music is radically inorganic, fit together out of tiny snippets of isolated sound in such a way that emphasizes disjuncture. But this album, in contrast, feels natural, artless. There are no evident seams.</p>
<p>The preparations give Hauschka an enormous range of timbres to work with, lending the music a wonderful sense of depth and texture, and tugging it closer to sounds normally thought possible only from electronic instruments. He also makes a good case for the piano as a percussive instrument, layering parts in short, repetitive bursts, indebted both to electronic music's syncopations and to the ""pulse"" minimalism of the 1960s and 70s. The influence of Steve Reich's <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i> and Terry Riley's <i>In C</i> is all over <i>Salon des Amateurs</i>, particularly in Hauschka's method of daubing on tone color, even if his sense of structure owes more to popular music.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the album succeeds not in imitation, but interpretation, borrowing house music's rudiments and riffing on them until it takes the music somewhere else. Piano house is in vogue right now, but the vast majority of it sticks to a single sampled chord. This is something else. It isn't so much that it's a facsimile of house, with downbeats here and staggered chords there, but a way of assuming its voice, of learning its vocabulary and grammar, stumblingly, and embellishing along the way with ideas borrowed from jazz and pop and classical music. It's gleefully polyglot, confident even in its own clumsiness-- awed by the scope of its subject and humbled by its own limitations, but still bright-eyed and unstoppable. If you've ever, while learning a language, passed through a phase where every new discovery felt like a giddy eureka moment, you'll know what I'm talking about. Curious, constantly in motion, full of puzzle-like counterpoints and arresting chord changes, it's a joy to listen to, and one of the brightest, most invigorating records I've heard all year.</p></div>"|15306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15306-salon-des-amateurs/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

In 2007, he released <i>Dreamland</i>, a debut composed of (dreamy!) instrumental pop meant to accompany a film he had yet to shoot. One year later, he released the doo-wop tinted <i>A Place Where We Could Go</i>, his first full-length for K Records and the first to feature his own vocals. That album's first words? ""Night, night."" Since then, he's dressed up his louche stripe of indie-pop in a variety of sonic getups, stripping down to sleek'n'minimal synth essentials for 2009's <i>Slow Dance</i>, donning a ragged alt-rock cape for the guitar crunch of 2010's <i>Splash</i>, and now a chilly combination of the two for <i>Dream Diary</i>, his latest. What glues them all together is his unwavering fascination with the dream state, both as a lyrical pipeline and method of delivery. Because as he presents himself here, now more than ever, Jeremy Jay sounds as though he works in silk pajamas.</p>
<p>That's not a comment on Jay's work ethic or his sartorial charms but rather the smooth and easy sensibility with which he lays everything down to tape. His longest full-length by a curious distance, <i>Dream Diary</i> maintains a nocturnal feel throughout. Additionally, it appears to be the purest distillation of that which Jay set out to do on Day One: Offer up images of last night at their most skeletal and straightforward. This calls for bare-bones chordcraft and sonics, a pursuit Jay does well to provide. As ""Caught in a Whirl"" threads slinky bass to eerie synths to ultra clean guitar, Jay croons, ""You met me at the store with your rainbow hair/ And we drove, windows down, past the sullen fog/ Breathing in the ocean air that night/ We walked down the steps, yeah, we didn't look back."" Just as he does moments later in the post-punk play-by-play of ""By the Rivers Edge"" and the spy guitar-bolstered snap of ""Secret Sounds"", Jay is nar

rating. Word for word, much of <i>Dream Diary</i>'s lyric sheet plays exactly like its title would have you
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
believe: as though it were lifted from a book he keeps next to his bed and fills with traces of whatever he can remember seeing in his sleep.</p>
<p>That doesn't make for a particularly inviting listen, but it does tend to be far more compelling than it sounds on paper. What's smart about Jay's approach this time out has everything to do with his ear/eye for the screen-- no matter how mundane the detail or direction, his take on soliloquizing calls for special attention. In fact, as long as the hook's in place, as it is on haunting high point ""It's Just a Walk in the Park"", it's not uncommon to find yourself waiting for whatever the script holds just around the corner. Jay has a way with those, and sonically, <i>Dream Diary</i> communicates that really well. Though overlong by about a third, the Bishop Allen-by-way-of-Modest Mouse bends of ""In the Times"", and the Belle and Sebastian-like breeze of ""Shayla"" boast some of Jay's finest lures yet.

Those multiple versions of <i>Guitar Trio</i>, a piece written in 1977 for any number of guitars, were recorded in 2007, during a Chatham legacy tour. Essentially, Chatham roamed from city to city with a minimal core band and recruited rock musicians-- members of Sonic Youth, Tortoise, Godspeed You! Black Emperor-- to play along. During the Cleveland performance, as nerd lore has it, a drunk fan shouted, ""<i>Guitar Trio</i> is my life."" The slogan stuck, and it's a telling one: Chatham has worked outside of <i>Guitar Trio</i>'s one-chord confines, sure, releasing a trumpet and electronics album in 1997 for Ninja Tune imprint Ntone and reissuing a three-decade-old, beautifully strange 1971 composition called <i>Two Gongs</i> in 2006. Thing is, <i>Guitar Trio</i> is the bellwether of his reputation, the thing that, if you know Chatham, you certainly know. Chatham's latest, the trumpet-led <i>Outdoor Spell</i>, finally looks to shatter that typecast.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Only the last of four pieces here, ""The Magician"", features any electric guitar, and even it's played by the Frenchman Jean-Marc Montera. More importantly, though, the improvisation swaps Chatham's generally strict performance rules for 12 minutes of free jazz, with melodies and rhythms arriving only to blur into continuous slipstreams of texture and tension. Drummer Kevin Shea works in fits and starts, building a beat, it seems, just to beat the band toward a new direction.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is Chatham, fending off fealty to <i>Guitar Trio</i> with, well, a very different kind of guitar trio. That's not to say Chatham is ignoring his history: Rather, the opening title track-- and, really, the only essential piece here-- reaches into Chatham's past, beyond <i>Guitar Trio</i> and to the time he spent studying with Yoshi Wada, a drone pioneer who built seemingly eternal pieces with massive horns and electronics. ""Outdoor Spell"" loops Chatham's voice into a monochromatic blur, a sound that suggests the space is already full.

Steadily, though, Chatham adds various trumpet lines, recorded to suggest that they're surrounding his hum on all sides. The music begins to stretch not just horizontally, then, but also vertically. So much of Chatham's career has depended on lots of people-- 400 guitars, multiple bass players, a drummer who could shatter the sky-- to achieve that effect. But this is Chatham alone, and he brings the same power-in-sound enthusiasm that's often made his most famous work so revelatory. At this point in his career, it's a brilliant look.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, it's unlikely that any of these pieces become anyone's life, or that, 30 years from now, Chatham will structure a tour based around recreating them. The 18-minute ""Crossing the Sword Bridge of the Abyss"", for instance, is an unfocused trip for solo trumpet and electronics. Voyaging through patches of Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, and early tape music, its transitions are as weak are its tones are motley. A mix of squawks and squeals, hums and howls, the piece shows Chatham's ability to make a lot of sounds without putting them together in a compelling fashion. His career has been largely defined, though, by very finite sounds arranged in shocking arrays. Here, above the cajón's rollick on ""Corn Maiden's Rite"", he successfully returns to that approach.</p>
<p class=""p1"">During the past two decades, one of America's most interesting experimental record labels, Table of the Elements, released the bulk of Chatham's discography, from the beautiful <i>A Crimson Grail</i> to the declarative <i>Guitar Trio Is My Life!</i> After reshaping the scope of American minimalism and adding new approaches to both modern electronics and finger-style guitar scenes, though, Table of the Elements seems to have entered a spell of deserved and deep quiescence. Chatham's decision to release <i>Outdoor Spell</i> via New York's nascent Northern-Spy Records feels like an endorsement from the trusted guard, a sort of torch being passed to a young label that, like Table of the Elements, is working to combine veteran names with fresh perspectives. <i>Outdoor Spell</i> is, after all, an urgent, interesting proclamation for the 58-year-old Chatham, one that gives the avant-garde legend some welcome, if sometimes uncertain, breathing room.</p></div>"|15325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15325-outdoor-spell/|6.8|Grayson Currin

He's penetrating, he's ironic, he's intimate, he's elusive, he's distant and calcified, he's vulnerable and warm-- it's all there, album to album, song to song, and sometimes line to line. His voice is low and his songs are slow, so it's easy to mistake him for being sad. As a lyricist, he writes meticulously about distance: the distance between people and other people, and between people and themselves. He's a cartographer of broken roads. But more than sadness, his writing represents a stoic quest for understanding in the face of knowing that these gaps usually can't be filled. ""There's no truth in you, there's no truth in me,"" he sang on 2003's <i>Supper. ""</i>The truth is between.""</p>
<p><i>Apocalypse</i> is his first studio album since 2009's <i>Sometimes I Wish We Were an Eagle</i>. The contrast between the two is stark. <i>Eagle</i> was a bath of strings, open-air ambience, French horns, and soft, measured drums. It was delicate and planned, it called out <i>warm</i>. Lyrically, the songs were direct and steady admissions of the kinds of sentiments that rise to light after funerals and breakups-- an exercise in what we normally call ""vulnerable.""</p>
<p><i>Apocalypse</i>, ostensibly recorded live in the studio with a small band, is idiosyncratic and reluctant. Its narrators chew grass in silence and give you a too-long stare. They have meltdowns in foreign hotel rooms. And they come to us in a sound that is spare and liberated from <i>Eagle</i>'s insistence on being gorgeous every single second. It's occasionally distorted, even <i>ugly</i>, a word I wouldn't use to describe almost anything Callahan's done since he recorded as Smog.</p>
<p>One of his most remarkable tricks-- and one he returns to all over <i>Apocalypse</i>-- is the ability to sound both controlled and casual at the same time. The songs here are filled with silly, borderline bad ideas that an artist with less confidence might've scrubbed after taking a long walk and a good rest. ""Baby's Breath"" speeds up and slows down in a way that sounds unrehearsed, devolving into distorted guitar toward the end. The sloppy backing track on ""America!"" quotes what sounds like Civil War songs and 50s jungle-rock. (It also casts Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson as part of an imagined U.S. military force and ends on an acidic joke about American imperialism: ""Well everyone's allowed a past they don't care to mention."") A few songs feature, prominently, the flute.</p>
<p>But the feeling of spontaneity is also in Callahan's voice and delivery, which brings out the emotional dimension of the lines in ways the lyric sheet can't. On ""One Fine Morning""-- one of two songs to use the album's title-- he sings, ""It's all coming back to me now: my apocalypse, my apocalypse."" The lyric is literally a realization, but it's the way he sings it that brings the feeling across: Curious and questioning, like he actually figured it out while tape was rolling. On ""Universal Applicant"", he describes a moment where he shoots a flare gun into the air, and punctuates it with a sound: <i>fffff, pouh</i>-- the flare burning and going off. The music falls silent for a few seconds. It's an aside that anchors the song. Ironically, it's not in the lyric sheet.</p>
<p>All these apparent accidents and asides produce a strange effect: It's like Callahan is alive in the music while it's being documented. It's vital that way, but permeable, like a friend who can tell the same story over and over again with subtle variations and capture their audience each time.</p>
<p>For me, Callahan's albums always return to questions of truth in song. For some people, the acoustic guitar-- when compared to the synthesizer-- is truth. For some, it's a line as unambiguous as ""Most of my fantasies are of making someone else come,"" from 1997's <i>Red Apple Falls</i>. For others, it might be a line like ""You always wanted to be the fire part of fire,"" from 2005's <i>Woke on a Whaleheart</i>-- a crowning example of Callahan at his most profoundly anti-poetic. He sets up alone and sings a lot of lines about feelings that start with the word ""I"" and doesn't use Auto-Tune, and so it's tempting to think of him as being a truth-teller. But it's more interesting-- and more flattering to him, I think-- to acknowledge the way in which he tries to climb to truth from so many different angles, where he finds footing and where he loses it, and the things he sees along the way.</p>
<p>One of <i>Apocalypse</i>'s prettiest and most agreeable songs is called ""Riding For the Feeling"". It's a slow waltz. Callahan strums an acoustic guitar and sings close to the mic. The drums are brushed and patient. The sound alone tells us it's honest. And yet the scenario presented in the song is so strange: Callahan singing about moving, leaving, disappearing. Callahan singing about being in a hotel room with the television on mute, listening to demo tapes: ""My my my apocalypse,"" he calls it-- the other song where the album's title comes in. ""I realize I had said very little about waves or wheels/ Or riding for the feeling/ Riding for the feeling/ Is the fastest way to reach the shore.""</p>
<p>The richness, as I hear it, is that the line describes how elusive-- and maybe even impossible-- honesty is. I don't have a clear idea of what ""riding for the feeling is,"" but I wonder if that's the point: it's a journey toward something vague and variable. It's about the distance between how simple things feel when you experience them and how cluttered and gummed-up they come out sounding in song or verse. It's about the distance between something like <i>Eagle</i>'s ""Jim Cain"" and ""America!"": The healthy-looking guy standing in a field telling you in past tense about his heartbreak and the one barking at you live and uncut from an Australian hotel room. One sounds too close to their feelings to make sense of them, the other sounds too far away to embody them. Which is more honest?</p>
<p>When his first records as Smog started coming out, it would've been easy to situate Callahan in an axis of singer-songwriters who sounded both rooted in American folk traditions but also radically disjointed from them: Dave Berman (of Silver Jews), Cat Power, and Will Oldham (then playing as Palace). Berman has retired, Cat Power has slowed down, and Oldham, like Callahan, has become the kind of musician who only makes sense within the context of himself. Callahan has nothing to add to the general conversation about music in 2011 but is making the best albums of his career. And despite the superficial changes he makes to his sound or focus, everything he's done ends on similar gestures: a stare, a nod, and the quiet question of whether trying to get to the heart of something is the same thing as actually getting to it.</p></div>"|15285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15285-apocalypse/|8.0|Mike Powell

But Atmopshere's Slug established a particular knack for it when he broke outside the Twin Cities about a decade back-- every heartfelt line about lonely people or fractured relations was offset by an offhand remark that took some the sting out of his lamentations. Atmosphere got tagged as ""emo rap"" because there wasn't an easier go-to term for a barfly raconteur with female troubles, but while Slug's lyrics spoke to the same sour impulses that drove teenage misery, they did so through the experiences of someone who discovers to that misery when you grow up.</p>
<p>The catch is that growing up also means growing out of a few things, and <i>The Family Sign </i>catches Slug at a point where he seems to be tilting more towards plainspoken sincerity. The hard-drinking, love-stressed, party-fatigued persona that made him a breakout cult figure 10 years ago might sound somewhere between disingenuous and ridiculous coming from a 38-year-old today. But in stripping some of the more larger-than-life traits of misspent youth away from his approach, he's also lost some of the outsized arrogance and aw-shucks smartassedness that gave his more po-faced moments a three-dimensional context or sharp emotional counterpoint. While <i>The Family Sign </i>has a specific titular focus on loved (and formerly loved) ones and the way people define themselves through them, the real conceptual leap on this album is how patriarch maturity means less jokiness, more earnestness, and a traveled perspective that doesn't leave much room for not giving a fuck.</p>
<p>What room is left winds up parceled out over a couple of highlights. As blunt as the premise is, the negligent alky father meets stoner pickpockets of ""Bad Bad Daddy"" has a certain caustic bite to it. And the road-ravaged, detail-rich narrative of ""Millennium Dodo"" evokes the same harebrained excitement-slash-disorientation that made the best moments of 2003's fantastic <i>Seven's Travels </i>stand out. Pointing out his car's mirror-ball décor as an homage to <i>Escape From New York </i>or noting the resemblance between a Best Western clerk and ""WKRP in Cincinnati""<i> </i>nebbish Les Nessman is the sort of pop-culture debris that's evocative enough to transcend reference-dropping and hint at the metaphorical reserves in Slug's brain. But the track also starts out with a couplet-- ""I only <i>act</i> like an asshole/ Why don't ch'y'all stand back, let the man grow""-- that explains the rest of the album's almost total lack of sardonic edge.</p>
<p>Heartfelt moments haven't necessarily been beyond Slug's grasp-- <i>When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold </i>highlight ""Wild Wild Horses"" and ""Lifter Puller"" off <i>Seven's Travels </i>are genuinely moving in a way that few indie-rap love songs are. But here love songs are deployed a bit blank-facedly, strings of clichés, shrugging platitudes and half-thoughts drawn together into a husk of what used to be a compellingly contradictory personality. The idea of a banal yet subtly tense reunion with a long-forgotten ex in ""Your Name Here"" is undercut by the fact that there's not enough interesting personal details to make Slug's rejected reconnection come across like anything more than a petty dismissal. And while ""The Last to Say"" is 100% worth hearing if it convinces just one woman to leave the abusive asshole that blackens her eyes, it's weird that it sounds less emotionally invested than the sharp-spitting breakup kissoff ""Just for Show"".</p>
<p>As Slug's performative role dials down the emotional resonance, the beats have followed suit into a low-intensity churn, one that undercuts what could've been a set of adventurous live-band hip-hop with a uniform lethargy that tops out at mid-tempo. While the instrumentation of <i>When Life Gives You Lemons </i>signaled a wealth of potential new directions for Atmosphere's production, <i>The Family Sign </i>runs almost entirely on gloomy ballads heavy on maudlin piano chords and keening guitar riffs. That latter instrument's maybe the most interesting sonic component of Ant's post-sampling compositional phase, and Nate Collis cranks out Black Keys-ian twang (""Bad Bad Daddy""), psychedelic noir (""My Key""), and eerie slide (""The Last to Say"") with versatile ease. And if Erick Anderson's keyboards tend to provide more texture than melody, at least he's as handy with Jackie Mittoo reggae riffs (""Just for Show"") as he is with new wave glow (""I Don't Need Brighter Days""). But there's little to cut through the fog-- with the exception of the joy-buzzer jolt of ""She's Enough"" and the flailing attempt at Nilsson-style AM pop on ""Ain't Nobody"", this is music that conflates maturity with exhaustion.</p></div>"|15297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15297-the-family-sign/|5.8|Nate Patrin

You can see it in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beZ5F_GO-Mg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this clip</a> of ""Beg Waves"", a song that originally surfaced on the Baltimore group's second record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11928-ice-cream-spiritual/"">Ice Cream Spiritual</a></i>. Siegel stands rooted at the edge of the stage, right in the audience's faces, with her tiny frame spread as wide as it could possibly go. She'll often compound the feeling by dressing in a football shirt and daubing smudges of makeup on her cheeks. That posture works as a kind of harbinger of her subsequent response to the music, which involves a full-blooded commitment to the cause, complete with facial spasms, the spouting of a strange un-language in place of lyrics, numerous tussles with the crowd, and an unyielding physical reaction to the sound.</p>
<p>In some respects Siegel's visceral scuffling against the band's noise lies in marked contrast to the nature of Ponytail's music-- the word ""joyous"" is often invoked to describe their work, and with good reason. But that dichotomy is where Ponytail find their meaning, with guitarists Dustin Wong and Ken Seeno interlacing ray-of-light guitar lines that provide the inexorable uplift, while Siegel thrashes around like she's trying to escape from her own skin and bones. That vigor and commitment to the cause, particularly Siegel's uninhibited shredding of her self on a regular basis, must be immensely taxing. So it's perhaps unsurprising that this third Ponytail record, which bears a title that perfectly reflects their single-minded vision, comes at a time when they are on hiatus, pursuing other projects, taking a breather from such an all-consuming interest.</p>
<p>The opening ""Easy Peasy"" works in much the same way ""Beg Waves"" did on <i>Ice Cream Spiritual</i>, as a slow-build entry point into the record. It begins with a minute or two of anticipation, where the members gradually layer on each element that makes the overall sound function, almost as though they're putting an arm around your shoulder and gently ushering you into their world. But once those components are all put together-- the abstract noise, the vocal yelps, the giddily plaited guitar lines, the galloping drum patterns-- the song only devolves further into maniacal glee, where the tempo constantly stop-starts, never reaches an even meter, and ultimately races breathlessly to the finish line with a great lurch of pace at the end.</p>
<p>That Beefheart-like tendency to avoid consistent rhythm and keep the audience guessing is partly what makes this music feel so alive. Couple that with the natural exuberance that bleeds out of the playing, and it's hard not to get lost in the infectious indulgence of Ponytail's music. That said, there are a few changes this time out. ""Flabbermouse"" is less dense than most of their material, with the crosscut guitar playing kept on an even keel throughout and matched with acres of space; and Siegel's parts are more refined than before, often only amounting to a few snatched words or disappearing altogether on ""Beyondersville/Flight of Fancy"". The latter falls in line with the bare-bones experimentation of Wong's excellent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14802-infinite-love/"">Infinite Love</a></i> album from last year, where guitar patterns are splayed out and looped over a rhythm track that never settles into a solid groove.</p>
<p>There's been a subtle evolution of Ponytail's approach over their three-album career, and tracks like ""Beyondersville/Flight of Fancy"" and the vast metallic sheets of noise that open ""Music Tunes"" at the close of this album keep that forward-thinking pattern firmly in place. But there's also plenty of material here to satisfy fans of their older sound. ""Honey Touches"" has been a staple of their live set for a while and is ostensibly the straightest track here, with Hyman guiding the band through a series of steady rhythm patterns and Siegel hinting at what's to come with her opening word: ""en-er-gy."" It's also one of the few Ponytail tracks where you can discern some of her lyrics. ""I know it's not that fun"" is the mantra that closes the song, which taps into that lopsided Ponytail ideology, where control and abandon make perfect bedfellows, and the most ""fun"" song on the record comes to a close with the singer claiming it's the exact opposite.</p>
<p>There are further deviations from the <i>Ice Cream Spiritual</i> aesthetic as the record progresses-- ""Tush"" takes a few unintelligible words from Siegel and loops them over a series of bathetic riffs; ""AwayWay"" returns to the wide open spaces of ""Flabbermouse"" before delving into that furiously exhilarating noise they are so adept at plundering. But it's in the closing ""Music Tunes"" that the record peaks. Here, that knotty riffing that Wong and Seeno can pile up so well is set to a long build up that, some four minutes in, takes an abrupt turn into great expanses of robo-noise, which ping back and forth and suck in another burst of that ""en-er-gy"" to close the record on a barely contained high. At the time of writing this review there's a message on the <a href=""http://www.nowwearefree.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We Are Free</a> website, which is layered over a picture of grunge titans Soundgarden, that reads: ""Ponytail has not broken up"". It's a welcome reminder of this band's current status, because one hopes that <i>Do Whatever You Want All the Time</i> isn't an end, but another new beginning.</p></div>"|15283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15283-do-whatever-you-want-all-the-time/|8.2|Nick Neyland

It's a delectable PR morsel, used as a metaphorical device for the people who created it: A community of workers rolling up their sleeves to humbly pull long hours manufacturing food is a quirky image of increasingly archaic American industriousness, a pat likeness for a band like Low Anthem working within time-honored and respected folk tropes. The physical labor used to be the only tedious thing in the scenario; here, the product is drudgingly tiresome, too.</p>
<p><i>Smart Flesh </i>begins with a cover of George Carter standard ""Ghost Woman Blues""-- a pretty display of their harmonic compatibility that establishes the LP's thematic thread of being supernaturally inhabited. The cavernous, almost living sound of <i>Smart Flesh </i>gives it distinction from their previous album, the word-of-mouth success <i>Oh My God, Charlie Darwin!</i>, and adds tactile weight to clarinet moans and harmonies that might otherwise waft away. But they're more or less haunted by those who still walk the earth: At times recalling Bob Dylan's astringent rambles, Tom Waits' picaresques, Leonard Cohen's mordant balladry, the Band's idealized Americana, or even Cat Stevens, the Low Anthem's sensibilities scan as tasteful and easily identifiable.</p>
<p>But what do they bring other than hearts in the right place? For the most part, it's a sort of presumably arch intellect and ripe lyrical bent that's nowhere near as clever as it thinks. Is their entry in the ""love is the drug"" metaphorical game any less played out because they use the word ""apothecary"" instead of ""pharmacy?"" Singer Ben Knox Miller remembers where he was when the world stopped turning on ""Boeing 737"", but what of the forced reference to Philippe Petit of <i>Man on Wire </i>fame? Is it just another attempt by Low Anthem to siphon charm from a pat acknowledgement of liberal arts culture?</p>
<p>Such aspirations could've been forgiven had they found more vibrant compositions. The Low Anthem are mostly hands-off in the museum of American folk tradition, mistaking dragging tempos for gravitas, blank arrangements for hymnal transcendence, and Mel Bay melodies for, well... they're pretty much employed as expected. At least ""Boeing 737"" tries to kick up dust, but the thickness of the reverb makes them sound like they're merely running in place-- it's sort of a weird collaboration between Pig-Pen and the Arcade Fire.</p>
<p>With minimal effort, you can find plenty of other acts putting their own idiosyncratic spin on the early 20th century canon, many of whom simply have better songs. But the Low Anthem will be fine: Sadly, this sort of thing always finds an audience that <i>rewards </i>it for its deference. (And, at the very least, the Low Anthem lack the pandering, salt-of-the-earth vibe of Mumford &amp; Sons and the po-faced seriousness of the Avett Brothers.) But as long as the Low Anthem discount the idea that this music was once meant to stir the blood, rile the soul, and actually be exciting, it's always going to be historically inaccurate in a way no amount of sepia-toned ambience can overcome.</p></div>"|15319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15319-smart-flesh/|4.8|Ian Cohen

In the corner of higher aspirations, you have Columbia-signed fresh-facers Foster the People, whose labelmate status with MGMT gives off a bit of a ""the calls are coming from inside the house"" feeling. Portland synth-poppers Starfucker, on the other hand, have been doing the spacey headband thing for almost as long as MGMT have (or, more accurately, were)-- and, yet, it proves difficult to resist comparison. Their 2008 self-titled debut had the same shoddy, in-development synthy sound that many of us heard from those Wesleyan boys when their <i>Time to Pretend</i> EP was circulating around 2005; on Starfucker's sophomore effort, <i>Reptilians</i>, there are a few moments (the drum sounds on opening track ""Born"", the mortality-questioning nature of ""Death as a Fetish"") where that influence is extended to MGMT's forebears, the Flaming Lips.</p>
<p>To dismiss <i>Reptilians</i>-- and Starfucker's general style, by extension-- as the result of well-executed pastiche would be ignoring that, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good album. The sonic fidelity here is about a million times better than that of their debut-- an improvement no doubt abetted by the band's jump to recovering-but-still-fighting indie Polyvinyl. What you're getting here: a fair amount of intricate synth work paired with catchy alt-indie melodies that would fit in perfectly as transitional music to almost any show on the CW. At times, the former can overshadow the latter-- minus some blaring MIDI'd-to-death horns, the twinkling tunnel of ""Bury Us Alive"" is the kind of rabbit hole that bands like Bear in Heaven should think about heading down more often. They clearly demonstrate the capability to make ""hits,"" too; the anthemic ascent of ""Julius"" and ""Mystery Cloud"" seem like the kind of stuff that, for better and for worse, would get stuck near the top of the Hype Machine or elbo.ws charts for a while. There's something innately appealing to the best of this band's melodies-- whatever it is almost completely lacks originality, granted, but it's hard not to see the small promises hidden within this record's modest highlights.</p>
<p>Whatever goodwill that gets built up in the record's enjoyably familiar first half is slowly chipped away at during its back end. As a whole, <i>Reptilians</i> is 41 minutes long-- not exactly as bad as listening to <i>2112</i> three times in a row or anything, but the running time on this thing nonetheless feels like a slog. A glut of midtempo dithering mostly takes up the second half, and while some of the songs situated there are decent on their own, together they congeal into an asymmetrical mess, exposing <i>Reptilians</i>' front-loaded wiring.</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing: This band's name sucks-- and I say this in an era of truly terrible, roll-your-eyes-until-you-die monikers. With a band name like Police Academy 6 or Nid and Sancy, though, you get the idea that they're in on the joke too, an enjoyably stupid public self-prank that makes for good conversation at the least. Naming your band Starfucker, on the other hand, seems like an action on the level of cursing around your friends for the first time in grade school-- it's blunt, and it might get a laugh or two, but it's strictly juvenile. It's almost as if they picked the name to <i>dare</i> people to listen to their record. Seeing as how they're still a ways away from being anything more than a blog concern, I'm not too sure the gambit is working.</p></div>"|15322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15322-reptilians/|6.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

They left renowned indie label Touch and Go to join Interscope. Their major-label debut boasted a cameo from David Bowie. Singer Tunde Adebimpe starred opposite Anne Hathaway <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zqkSMOTq50"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a Jonathan Demme-directed drama</a>. Guitarist/producer Dave Sitek <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11522-anywhere-i-lay-my-head/"" target=""_blank"">made a record with Scarlett Johansson</a> and is now <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-perry-farrell-opens-up-about-new-dave-sitek-produced-janes-addiction-lp-20110112"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">possibly joining Jane's Addiction</a>. Of course, one listen to any TV on the Radio album quickly dispels any notion of calculated opportunism. Even as their art-rock soul has blossomed out of their home-recording roots into something bigger and bolder, their music is still fraught with a simmering unease; even the dancefloor-ready maneuvers of 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12246-dear-science/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dear Science</i></a> exuded a jittery, restless energy that was as tense as it was celebratory.</p>
<p>However, as <i>Nine Types of Light</i> suggests, perhaps they just needed to get out of Brooklyn. The new album marks two significant changes in TVOTR's methodology: It was made in the wake of a one-year hiatus following six years of non-stop recording and touring; and it was recorded in Los Angeles, where Sitek has been steadily building his celebrity clientele list over the past few years. Both factors seem to have influenced the sound and feel of the album: <i>Nine Types of Light</i> is unquestionably TV on the Radio's most patient, positive recording to date, taking its cues as much from <i>Dear Science</i>'s serene ballads (""Family Tree"", ""Love Dog"") as its brassy workouts. Each of the band's albums has opted for a tone-setting opening salvo, and mission statements don't come more concise and clear-headed than Tunde Adebimpe's ecstatic, falsettoed hook on <i>Nine Types</i>' first song, ""Second Song"": ""Every lover on a mission/ Shift your known position/ Into the light.""</p>
<p>Love songs are, of course, nothing new for TV on the Radio, but they're usually cast against the grim backdrop of life during wartime: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8197-desperate-youth-blood-thirsty-babes/"" target=""_blank""><i>Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes</i></a>' doo-wop serenade ""Ambulance"" spoke of emotional commitment using the language of hospital care; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9177-return-to-cookie-mountain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Return to Cookie Mountain</i></a>'s ""Province"" effectively equated a declaration of love with an act of radicalism. On <i>Nine Types of Light</i>, however, there seems to be a more concerted effort on the band's part to not let external pressures sully their inner spirit: Set to steady shuffle beats, ""Will Do"" and ""You"" are impassioned, open-hearted addresses delivered free of any political context, while Kyp Malone's ""Keep Your Heart"" feels like a riposte to <i>Cookie Mountain</i>'s defeatist ""I was a lover before this war"" refrain, promising instead to ""keep your heart, if the world all falls apart."" Malone's stutter-funk standout ""No Future Shock"" takes this don't-let-the-bastards-get-you-down sentiment to more delightfully absurd extremes, channeling pervasive anxieties over everything from global economic collapse to invasive airport security into a new dance move (""Do the no future! Do the no future!"").</p>
<p>Coming four songs in, ""No Future Shock"" at first feels like an anomaly on an album that frontloads its more elegiac material; the notion that <i>Nine Types</i> is a more subdued, comedown counterpoint to Dear Science is further posited by Adebimpe's six-minute, mid-album centerpiece, ""Killer Crane"", a pretty, proggy pastorale that gently ebbs and flows with flourishes of strings, piano, banjo, and mellotron. But the album's second half is more in step with <i>Dear Science</i>'s manic swagger; though mid-tempo exercises ""New Cannonball Blues"" and ""Forgotten"" never catch fire to the same degree (even with the late-song intrusion of the horn section), ""Repetition"" is an exhilarating display of Adibempe and Malone's motor-mouthed repartee set to a krautrock thrust. And as weird as it was to see Liars' Angus Andrew faithfully singing INXS' ""Guns in the Sky"" <a href=""http://vimeo.com/10245433"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a promo vid for Beck's Record Club</a> last year, <i>Nine Types</i>' massive, arena-rattling closer, ""Caffeinated Consciousness"" proves that song must hold a special place in the hearts of Brooklyn's post-punk class of 2002.</p>
<p>In the past, TV on the Radio have tried to undercut their more rockist ambitions with dissonant textures and queasy atmospherics, or lace their prettiest ballads with subversively ominous lyrics. But <i>Nine Types of Light</i> shows how TV on the Radio's transmissions can be just as effective and affecting when delivered free of static and noise.</p></div>"|15311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15311-nine-types-of-light/|7.7|Stuart Berman

The space between slaps is long, allowing the sound to reverberate around the church he's sitting in. I wondered if the trailer's spartan approach might signal a return to the band's earliest days, when 39 seconds of slow, cavernously reverberating percussion might have constituted the intro of a song. That was not the case-- <i>C'mon</i> doesn't retreat from the more fleshed-out, strident sounds Low have spent the last decade cultivating-- but it was telling in other ways.</p>
<p>The sound is still lush on the band's ninth album, but not in the same way as their two Dave Fridmann-produced LPs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9991-drums-and-guns/"" target=""_blank""><i>Drums and Guns</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4902-the-great-destroyer/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Great Destroyer</i></a>. They recorded this album themselves with co-producer Matt Beckley in that old church, using the room's natural reverb to open up their sound. 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4891-trust/"" target=""_blank""><i>Trust</i></a>, recorded in the same room, is a good reference point for the sonic character of <i>C'mon</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, though the low end on this album is much airier</span>. You'd expect Mimi Parker's drums to benefit from that approach, and they do, but Sparhawk's guitar also gets a lift-- the tone of his strumming on ""Nightingale"" is especially striking in its icy beauty.</p>
<p>That guitar gets a couple of impressive workouts here, reflecting Sparhawk's work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5700-retribution-gospel-choir/"" target=""_blank"">Retribution Gospel Choir</a> and on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9299-solo-guitar/"" target=""_blank""><i>Solo Guitar</i></a> album. He hits upon this rough, dramatic sound on a few tracks, making for bracingly ragged lead lines. On ""Witches"", a drifting, clanging guitar line ties together the decidedly scattershot lyrics. On the groaning, eight-minute ""Nothing But Heart"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"" target=""_blank"">Nels Cline</a> appears on steel guitar, but the song really takes off in its final third, when Parker's towering vocal appears from nowhere.</p>
<p>Parker takes the lead on one of the album's best songs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42006-new-low-especially-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Especially Me""</a>, riding a bobbing 6/8 rhythm with a haunting, multi-tracked performance. The very basic instrumental arrangement is almost like a sped-up version of the band's stripped-down earlier work, at least until a rush of strings carries the song to its closing verse. Sparhawk and Parker showcase their distinctive harmonies on twinkling album opener ""Try to Sleep""-- if all this is beginning to sound like a tour of the various twists and turns in Low's direction over the years, there's a good reason for that. Having covered a good deal of ground since breaking out of their original slowcore mold, on <i>C'mon</i>, Low seem undecided on a direction forward.</p>
<p>As such, <i>C'mon</i> feels more like a collection drawn from throughout the last decade than a completely cohesive album. This could be viewed as the band sorting through the progress it's made in search of the next turn-- there are even a few songs that come close to revisiting the glacial sparseness of their earliest music. This is all to say that, if you already like Low, <i>C'mon</i> will not disappoint you, and though it's not their best album, it's a fairly accessible distillation of where they've been.</p></div>"|15253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15253-cmon/|7.2|Joe Tangari

They were impromptu sessions in a glorified broom closet, but produced the first known recordings of some of his signature tunes, including ""Don't Think Twice It's Alright"" and ""Blowin' in the Wind"". At nearly 50 tracks, the hefty set provides a good context for <i>In Concert: Brandeis University 1963</i>, which was recorded during the same period. By showing his songs in their earliest, roughest, unfinished forms, <i>Witmark</i> allows us some insight into Dylan's creative process, while <i>Brandeis</i> offers a glimpse at his performative process. Together, the two sets trace a careful trajectory from song kernel to setlist, from private development to public presentation, which makes them an intriguing and useful primary source that reveals new facets of this thoroughly studied artist.</p>
<p>The Brandeis show was recorded in May 1963, which is auspicious: Just two weeks later, Dylan would release his second album, <i>The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</i>, which would make him folk's first rock star, rocketing him out of college gymnasiums and into concert halls. At this point, he was still in his very early twenties and had released only one previous record, a self-titled LP that was a notoriously poor seller. At the Brandeis Folk Festival, he was billed under Pete Seeger and Jean Ritchie, among several other, more established acts.</p>
<p>As scholar Michael Gray writes in the new liner notes (which weren't included in the bonus version), this was a fairly typical Dylan show for the time. It's likely he gave many similar performances in 1962 and early 1963, and all that distinguishes this one from any other is that it survives. Only recently discovered in the archives of the late critic Ralph J. Gleason, co-founder of <i>Rolling Stone</i>, the tapes provide a valuable snapshot of pre-fame Dylan, who gives a rambling performance that balances gravity with levity. ""Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues"" and ""Talkin' World War III Blues"" scoff at anti-communist scaremongering and war-profiteering justifications, and Dylan's barbed satire provokes some laughs from his audience. He addresses the same subjects on the dead-serious ""Masters of War"" and ""Bob Dylan's Dream"", on which his earnest strumming and mournful harmonica evoke a sense of solitude, as if sanity in the face of such madness has isolated him from humanity.</p>
<p>The setlist is, however, lackluster, showcasing what would become deep-album cuts to the neglect of his better material. By the time he winds up his lengthy intro to ""Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues"", his talking blues delivery has grown tiresome even. Of course, Dylan was likely tailoring his setlist to his audience and perhaps to the festival itself. Regardless, at seven songs (six-and-a-half if you discount the excerpt of ""Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance""), <i>Brandeis</i> is necessarily slight. It needs context. In that regard, it might have been interesting to hear this set as one of the many live performances from that same folk festival, if only for the opportunity to contrast Dylan with his contemporaries and to determine his place within the folk scene. Otherwise, it's difficult-- if not impossible-- to determine from these recordings what exactly distinguished this ambitious young artist from everyone else with a guitar and harmonica. Ultimately, <i>Brandeis</i> was more valuable and revealing as a bonus disc than as a standalone album.</p></div>"|15300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15300-in-concert-brandeis-university-1963/|6.3|Stephen M.

In the best-case scenario-- say, Mission of Burma or Wire-- we may marvel that artists in their fifties muster the same intensity as their twentysomething selves. But for the recently reunited Feelies, such considerations don't apply. The Feelies' 1980 debut, <i>Crazy Rhythms</i>, is undoubtedly their most revered record, but it's also the outlier in their discography, a singular and still exhilarating blur of minimalist guitar jabbing and percussive propulsion that the band would never try to recapture again. When <i>Crazy Rhythms</i>' follow-up, <i>The Good Earth</i>, appeared six long years later, the Feelies were a very different band both in terms of personnel and purpose. By then, they'd swapped out their rhythm section and tempered their debut's hypno-rock clatter into a more relaxed, jangly groove that they would ride out for two more albums before disbanding in 1991.</p>
<p>It's this second-wave iteration of the Feelies that resurfaced in 2008. And though the band acknowledged <i>Crazy Rhythms</i>' 30th anniversary by reissuing the album and performing it in its entirety at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival, the experience has had little rub-off effect on <i>Here Before</i>. Rather than try to reconnect with their formative inspirations, the Feelies sound remarkably comfortable in the middle-aged skin on <i>Here Before</i>, which exudes the casual grace of old friends who greatly enjoy playing together and have long stopped caring about proving themselves to anyone. Here, the Feelies simply dig up <i>The Good Earth</i>'s pastoral, post-Velvets power-pop-- a sound that ruled college radio airwaves in the mid-80s but which boasts few notable contemporary adherents-- and blissfully strum away as if they were performing in hammocks. And there's good reason to believe that, if we were to pay them a visit in another 20 years, they'd still be doing the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Despite the myriad, knowing references to ""start[ing] again"" and ""do[ing] it some more,"" there's little sense of a band striving to make the most of a new opportunity to be heard, or trying to prove their relevance to a younger generation. The nerviest track here, ""Time Is Right"", seems to mock this very idea, with Glenn Mercer sardonically declaring, ""Gotta do something/ Get in with the crowd."" But even if the Feelies aren't exactly challenging themselves on <i>Here Before</i>, they still prove themselves masters of arrangement, strategically positioning key elements to give these seemingly simple songs a greater dynamic impact. Examples include the glorious guitar solo that pushes the accelerator on ""Should Be Gone"", the stop/start snare-drum triggers on ""Later On"", or the strange, swirling static in ""When You Know"" that marks a rare moment of discord in these otherwise serene surroundings. Perhaps the most sublime turn on the entire album comes deep into the deceptively downcast title track, which blossoms suddenly into a swooning chorus at the 2:40 mark and venerates the moment by featuring it only once. And in that instance you realize why the Feelies are still necessary in totally wired 2011: to reassert the virtue of patience.</p></div>"|15313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15313-here-before/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Quintron and wife/collaborator/puppeteer Miss Pussycat recorded these tracks during a three-month residency at the New Orleans Museum of Art, where he built a makeshift studio and hung a few 19th century portraits for inspiration. Each morning he would clock in and spend the day laying down heavy beats, short jams, snippets of melody, and random sonic sketches, all in full view of every museumgoer who wandered over to his corner of the gallery. The creative process became the end product, which makes the resulting album a curious chronicle of its creation as well as a musical statement.</p>
<p>That environment proves particularly inspiring for the duo, whose oddball grooves and puppet-show vocals come across as Deep South outsider art among the Gauguins and Pissarros, and their comic-book imagery-- full of anthropomorphic petting zoos, glam-rock bands, and shampoo lather-- acts as a pop contrast to the fine art on the walls. These songs are all commotion: eccentric grooves that never bend or move as expected, as if Quintron has tapped an infinite variety of raunchy organ riffs and Drum Buddy beats. If in the past his songs have been austere in their jubilant energy, employing only the instruments he could play at one time, he takes advantage of the museum environs and paints with a wider palette of sounds, from birdcalls to timpani to what sounds like a xylophone made of frogs.</p>
<p>Opener ""Ring the Alarm"", fiercely jittery rather than outright aggressive, features a solo that could have been played on every keyboard-based instrument all at once, and ""Spirit Hair"", with Pussycat on vocals, hinges on a dexterous whistle sample courtesy of Grace Wilson, the museum's Manager of Communications and Marketing. Occasionally, the living exhibition becomes interactive, with Quintron playing the crowd for handclaps, clatter, and backing vocals. ""So what so what so what!"" they chant on ""Kicked Out of Zolar X"", and it's not hard-- but it <i>is</i> extremely entertaining-- to imagine the long-dead portrait subjects chanting along from inside their frames.</p>
<p><i>Sucre du Sauvage</i> begins loud and dense, with organ licks that sound like several planes landing on the same strip, but as it progresses, Quintron pares the music to its most basic elements, creating an increasingly deeper sense of space with each song. During the final weeks on display, he set up a tent in the sculpture garden and lived on the grounds, making extensive field recordings of bird screeches, traffic, trains, wind, and thunder, among other clatter. On the album's second half, these sounds coalesce into strange assemblages, and at first the effect is like seeing a Robert Ryman after spending an hour in front of a Miró: The seeming absence of stimuli makes it sound dull by comparison, but eventually subtle shapes begin to form. Wind noise becomes a phalanx of drummers, quack sounds suggest a band of ducks, and the grounds come across as a naturally musical environment.</p>
<p>While such transformations are pleasant, if not exactly commanding, they do manage to slyly deconstruct the ""real"" songs into the most basic building blocks, which are very specific to this setting. In that sense <i>Sucre du Sauvage</i> plays like a companion to Quintron's 2010 7"" single ""Tire Shop"", which featured vocals by local personality King Lee and sound effects recorded at the St. Claude Tire Shop, which was one of the few businesses to remain open during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Both that single and the new album sound like loving odes to the city itself, as Quintron turns all of New Orleans into a musical instrument.</p></div>"|15296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15296-sucre-du-sauvage/|6.9|Stephen M.

It's a strategy he learned, at least in part, from sonic forebears like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson</a>, along with the avant-techno types he reveres. Like those disparate influences, Lennox has used potentially off-putting compositional and textural ideas to craft some of the most inviting music of his era. In turn, he's inspired more of his own followers in the last four years than anyone might have guessed. Lennox has found himself the unwitting king of the chillwave nation, hero to a whole generation of underground kids drawn to his mix of heavy reverb, sun-woozy synths, droning kraut-surf-ambient-pop songs, high childlike voice, and psychedelic-cum-nostalgic sleeve art.</p>
<p><i>Tomboy</i>, Lennox's fourth solo album as Panda Bear, was mixed with Pete ""Sonic Boom"" Kember of Spectrum/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a>. And again, in a way there's little here that's any further out-there than the blissful psychedelia and dream-pop Spacemen 3 and their peers were playing in the late 1980s, a lineage that stretches right back to stuff we now consider classic rock. With its angelic choirboy harmonies over an unchanging synth buzz, even ""Drone"", the album's roughest song, is a dead-ringer for the way Spacemen 3 songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6M8Kdtm5Vs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ecstasy Symphony""</a> merged the pop high of Beach Boys with the woozy downer feel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>.</p>
<p>But despite <i>Tomboy</i><span>'s </span>shorter songs and more conventional structures-- especially compared to the loose percussive jams of Lennox's 2007 solo breakthrough <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10025-person-pitch/"" target=""_blank"">Person Pitch</a>--</i> he's still committed to pushing his music to strange places. And few of his chilled-to-the-point-of-entropy acolytes can match Lennox for warped hooks. Forget comparing his gorgeous voice to their mumbling. Unlike many chillwave and dream-pop artists (and Spacemen 3), Lennox is blessed with the ability to actually <i>sing</i>, and he knows enough about crafting harmonies to do more than vaguely nod in the direction of 60s pop. So <i>Tomboy</i> is a pretty singular mix of the eerie and the inviting.</p>
<p>Despite the murk and terror and noise of Animal Collective's earliest music, there's never been anything particularly ugly about Lennox's mature solo work, starting with 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6141-young-prayer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Young Prayer</i></a>. But even then, he wasn't comfortable playing the laid-back hippie stereotype that's been laid on A.C. by detractors in recent years. <i>Young Prayer</i> might still be the most emotionally wrenching album in the Collective's catalog, an album written by a young man wrestling with some heavy shit. Lennox's father was dying of brain cancer while <i>Young Prayer</i> was being written. <a href=""http://www2.citypaper.com/music/story.asp?id=11022"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""[My father] got to read the lyrics, which was the most important thing to me,"" he told me in 2005</a>; <i>Young Prayer</i> was a last attempt at confirming the good his father had done for him.</p>
<p>Musically, the album was the <i>least</i> bleak, least difficult thing an Animal Collective member had recorded to that point. But the unembellished recording-- you could almost hear the empty rooms in which it was recorded-- only heightened the fragility of the songs. ""I didn't want to spend a lot of time producing it or thinking about how I wanted to get it to sound,"" Lennox said in that same interview. ""I just wanted to get it out quickly."" <i>Tomboy</i> is a much more considered record, with thickly layered psych-style production. There's also another heavy dose of dub, the most studio-bound and  effects-driven music of the last 50 years, with the kind of extreme echo  that plays like an overt tribute to the very different Jamaican  psychedelia of King Tubby and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"" target=""_blank"">Lee Perry</a>.</p>
<p>But <i>Tomboy</i>'s also something of a return to the simplicity, if not the emotionally blasted vibe, of <i>Young Prayer</i> after the ornate structures and epic lengths of <i>Person Pitch</i>. Instead of a <i>Young Prayer</i> we now have a ""Surfer's Hymn"". Instead of a naked guitar and a lot of blank space in the recording we get a wall-of-sound rush and percussion that's like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a> by way of IDM. But the spare droning quality and devotional feeling of the music remains. There was plenty of church music in the Beach Boys and Arthur Russell, too, and <i>Tomboy</i> has a similar quality of embracing both summer fun and hushed spirituality.</p>
<p>The trouble with recording a ramshackle epic like <i>Person Pitch</i> is that you set up a portion of your audience to expect the next album to be at least as grand in both scope and design. There are certainly no obvious peaks on <i>Tomboy</i> like ""Bros"" or ""Good Girl/Carrots"", where the 12-minute lengths announced them as attention-demanding stand-outs. So <i>Tomboy</i>'s smoothness will likely be mildly divisive among Lennox's fans. Many might have hoped that Lennox would have recorded something less  accessible to separate him from the beach-obsessed glut of bedroom pop. But the scaling back on <i>Tomboy</i> in no way represents a scaling back of ambition on Lennox's part. In a way, what he's pulled off here is even more difficult. He's condensed the sprawl and stylistic shifts of <i>Person Pitch</i> into seemingly tidy songs. The fact that he's able to make music that's both otherworldly and familiar-on-first-listen is something that all of his followers would like to achieve, and very few have the chops or inventiveness to pull off.</p></div>"|15299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15299-tomboy/|8.5|Jess Harvell

That record honored some obvious predecessors-- C86, Slumberland, and K Records to name a few-- but just as importantly, it realized that those scenes had a thing for collector's items and myth-making. Starting off with a 22-minute-long LP that was originally limited to 500 copies, Vivian Girls seemed like the kind of band that would nail it the first time, flame out, and then disappear forever. Except they didn't. <i>Everything Goes Wrong</i> wasn't a huge drop-off, but the reception to it was muted, suggesting that they may have started to outstay their welcome. Lo-fi was quickly becoming cliché (again) and with their seemingly endless array of guest spots, side projects, and offshoots, Vivian Girls were adding to the glut of bands doing something very similar.</p>
<p>I'd say they're acknowledging this situation on <i>Share the Joy</i> by trading brevity for novelty: Opener ""The Other Girls"" clocks in at six and a half minutes, over two of which are filled up with guitar soloing. It's certainly an audacious move for a band that had previously constructed a song with just one word (""No"") and drew battle lines about whether technical competency-- let alone proficiency-- mattered in indie rock. But is it a good song? Not really. It never really builds toward much of anything, and Cassie Ramone isn't even noodling-- her fretboard runs are flat and stiff as dry spaghetti. But it's a fitting introduction to <i>Share the Joy</i>, an album that's more admirable for its willingness to stretch than its execution.</p>
<p>It's a record saddled with contradictions-- though it's their most uneven in terms of songwriting, the diversity oddly gives it more potential replay value than their prior records. Recorded at the home studio of Woods' Jarvis Taveniere, <i>Share the Joy</i> borrows that band's ambling tempos, rustic instrumentation, and frazzled guitar lines. But the breathing room often puts Vivian Girls in an unflattering mid-fi space, one neither slick enough to polish their imperfect pitch or buzzy enough to hide it.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Vivian Girls make discussions about songwriting and instrumental ability beside the point. Placing the chippy sock-hop sing-along ""Dance (If You Wanna)"" back-to-back with the brooding and sinister ""Lake House"" makes a good case for the band's range, while ""Trying to Pretend"" melds the Woodsist psychedelia and galloping punk attempted on <i>Share the Joy</i>'s epics in half the time. And whether or not ""Take It as It Comes"" is the best song here, it's certainly a high point that sheds light on how they probably don't take themselves as seriously as their deadpan pose might indicate. Taking the piss out of the tattered girl-group pop mode they helped re-popularize, they pull out all the stops-- they fawn over a boy named Johnny, throw in ridiculous intra-band commentary (""Cassie-- you're always right""), and offer clichéd hooks so time-honored, they make Best Coast look obtuse by comparison. I don't know if they've got beef with ex-drummer Ali Koehler's gig with Best Coast, but ""Take It as It Comes"" could be seen as a winking parody by upping their boy-needy desperation to hyperbolic absurdity.</p>
<p>So <i>Share the Joy</i> is an uneven third LP, and uneven third LPs usually come from bands at the crossroads. I'm not sure that much is at stake here: Vivian Girls have managed to infiltrate a hive of likeminded and supportive artistic peers, which gives them some momentum and also what looks to an outsider like an understandable whiff of back-patting scenestership. But whether it's old band members like Koehler and Frankie Rose and the Outs or more stylized successors like Dum Dum Girls, there are an increasing number of bands beating Vivian Girls at their own game. It's easy to see <i>Share the Joy</i>'s place in the Vivian Girls discography, but their place in indie rock as a whole is becoming less clear.</p></div>"|15233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15233-share-the-joy/|5.9|Ian Cohen

Their skyscraping, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Costey"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rich Costey</a>-produced debut from 2008 was proof enough of that, and now their second album, <i>EUPHORIC /// HEARTBREAK \\\, </i>removes all doubts as to whether they'd ever look back. The title alone promises a thrill ride spanning the poles of human emotion, rendered in all caps as if to say, ""your feelings must be <i>this</i> tall to ride."" Problem is, that sort of heavy-handedness is indicative of their operation in all other aspects, and with every second attempting to be the most cathartic, <i>EUPHORIC </i>simply numbs you with 50 minutes of novocaine for the soul.</p>
<p>Glasvegas started out applying principles of Spector's Wall of Sound, but on <i>EUPHORIC</i>, they mostly do away with the pop and fill the void with bombast. The resulting sound forfeits empathy and intimacy and makes the listener feel like just another chump in the cheap seats. If you've got a taste for messianic flag-waving, <i>EUPHORIC </i>can pack an intermittent, fleeting buzz, but they're ultimately harshed by Glasvegas' soggy musicianship: Frothy with echo, guitars well and crest, synthesizers ooze gelatin, and the rhythm section doesn't make any sudden movements. And it's all captured with monolithic monotony by Flood who, fresh off his vibrant production of Pains of Being Pure at Heart's <i>Belong</i>, wasn't challenged to deliver anything but the banal reverb-crank bands lean on to conjure the sound of ambition where none really exists.</p>
<p>In the past, <i>Glasvegas </i>benefited from the ""write what you know"" topicality on career highlights ""Daddy's Gone"", ""Stabbed"", and ""Flowers and Football Tops"", but here James Allan tries to feel everyone's pain and delivers the sort of pat universality you'd expect from songs with names like ""You"", ""Change"", and ""Shine Like Stars"". Camped out in a Santa Monica beach house and inspired by a viewing of <i>Thelma &amp; Louise </i>(dead serious), Allan penned the vaguely lesbian soap opera ""Whatever Hurts You Through the Night"" but even without that origin story, it's easy enough to chuckle at the lyrics that read like cheesecake video narration (""I see you in the night walking past my house/ I wonder if you feel the same as I do"").</p>
<p>Homosexuality is also a theme on ""I Feel Wrong"" and ""Stronger Than Dirt"", so credit Allan for at least being conceptually risky in a milieu often attributed to laddish behavior. But despite good intentions, the wincing lyrics border on pandering and even exploitative, revealing little in the way of insight or palpable compassion. And that's where <i>EUPHORIC </i>falls flat as a whole: Everything is supposedly belted out on the behalf of <i>you</i>, the listener, but whether suicidal or irrepressibly hopeful, gay or straight, imagined or real, you're simply a 2-D pawn in Glasvegas' game of high-stakes emoting.</p></div>"|15308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15308-euphoric-heartbreak/|4.1|Ian Cohen

When he left the group in 2007, he had held his own in a group full of top-shelf rock songwriters, displaying a flair for quiet drama and telling details. Out of the gate he started strong on <i>Decoration Day </i>in 2003 and owned <i>The Dirty South</i> the next year; ""Outfit"" may be his most quoted song, but ""Danko/Manuel"", ostensibly about the tragic Band members, was a better mission statement about saving a bit of yourself away from the gigs. <i>A Blessing and a Curse</i> sounded like rut in 2006, not just for Isbell but for the Truckers as a unit. The band immediately rebounded with one of the best albums of their formidable catalog, while Isbell, going solo, apparently took <i>Blessing</i> as a template, releasing solo albums with only a handful of memorable songs mixed in among rote southern rock.</p>
<p>Granted, that's pretty much what he was doing in the Truckers, but without company from Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley, Isbell must now carry an entire album by himself. Three albums in, it might seem unfair to still compare his solo output to his Truckers material, but Isbell simply hasn't yet given us a reason to forget those years or to rethink that particular context. <i>Here We Rest</i> doesn't change that midline trajectory; as with <i>Sirens of the Ditch</i> in 2007 and the self-titled follow-up in 2009, his third album has some great songs that capture the spirit and pace of life in the New New South, that evoke real characters in real predicaments, that lodge into your brain alongside his best material. Unfortunately, it has many other songs that don't.</p>
<p>First, the good: Opener ""Alabama Pines"" is a soft-spoken lament about a man so lonely he says he doesn't even need a name, and Isbell makes the chorus-- which ushers the character back home through the Yellowhammer State wilderness-- sound quietly moving, as if such memories are all the man has anymore. Similarly, ""Codeine"" puts us immediately in a character's point of view, one so well drawn he feels comfortable, if not familiar. The song's a stand-out not just for the humor and peculiarity of the details, but for the way Isbell puts listeners right in the moment. Opening with a complaint about a bad cover band bumbling through ""Castles Made of Sand"", Isbell evokes an entire world through one sad man's eyes, with a sing-song chorus whose catchiness only underscores its tragedy.</p>
<p>The 400 Unit prove to be an agile backing band, able to move resourcefully from the loping melody of ""Codeine"" to the upbeat throwback country of ""Never Could Believe"" and the gentle reminiscence of ""We've Met"". Trying out various styles but never fully embracing them, they sound more slick than soulful, although that may be the fault of their too-crisp production, which rarely sounds live. At times, however, Isbell struggles to keep up. His voice possesses a distinctive rasp that easily evokes his character's dead-end struggles, whether it's their devotion to a drug-addicted woman or their allegiance to a disappearing way of life. The downside is that his vocal range is limited. He can't pull off the sentimental ""Daisy Mae"" at all, and struggles with tricky rhythms of ""Never Could Believe"" and the generic country-soul of ""Heart on a String"". Although he's now logged as much time as a solo artist as he did with his former band, Isbell sounds he's still finding his voice.</p></div>"|15287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15287-here-we-rest/|6.0|Stephen M.

Their music is busy but not aggressively so; it feels orchestral, but aside from the occasional horn chart the band sticks with pop/rock standard-bearers. <i>Giving &amp; Receiving</i> is the band's third full-length for K Records, on which they continue to innocuously fidget with their miniatures. LAKE's music is aimless, but pleasantly so. For all of the time spent on the arrangements, there doesn't appear to be a guiding principle; not to perfect cuddly songcraft, not to scheme the least threatening electric guitar sound ever recorded, not to be Sufjan Stevens.</p>
<p>Flaws and inconsistencies are what drew me to LAKE's previous record, <i>Let's Build a Roof</i>, which, despite being a twee-inflected album about domesticity that featured an entire song about camping in the yard, had a subtle but distinct soul influence. <i>Giving &amp; Receiving</i> is a quieter record than the already quiet <i>Roof</i>, and the push-and-pull between its big-but-small arrangements is less apparent. When the band jumps into an almost prog-y groove on ""Mother Nature's Promise"" it feels like those mid-1970s Beach Boys genre experiments, like a band ably and enjoyably co-opting a sound that they'll never return to. In other words: no pressure. LAKE's best music has a pace that is enormously comforting.</p>
<p>You might be waiting for a hammer to drop, to which I'd say... which one? Some options: quaint, cute, precocious, Trader Joe's. LAKE's peculiarities are almost all internal, so it's possible that if their specific purview doesn't grab your ear, nothing will. They will sound like unremarkable, overtly precious indie pop in the vein of<i> plenty</i> of other bands. The opening chords for one of the album's best songs (""Pilgrim's Day"") recall the Dave Matthews Band's ""Crash"", which alone might be enough to brand LAKE ""offensively inoffensive.""</p>
<p>I'm resisting the urge to say ""I wish they'd built off of <i>Let's Build a Roof</i>,"" because I haven't the slightest idea what I would have wanted them to build. I still appreciate how their minutely  focused songs have ornate houses, and how tiny those homes are; I just don't find them quite as charming.</p></div>"|15302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15302-giving-receiving/|6.3|Andrew Gaerig

East Coast rap battles are irrelevant. Beef is null. Competition is nada. Instead, we are enduring the age of languor, and nowhere is this more apparent than on <i>Rolling Papers</i>, the major label debut of Wiz Khalifa, a long-developing star forged in the Snoop Dogg fire. But whereas Snoop took a decade to mellow into rap's avuncular marketing boss-- 1994's grim, ruthless <i>Murder Is the Case</i> remains an oft-overlooked marker in his career, to say nothing of a stint on No Limit-- for Wiz the journey to calm was never far.</p>
<p>Wiz has managed an unusual trajectory, rising from a modest army brat to a squelched major label deal at Warner Bros. and back to the independent route. He was prolific-- perhaps too prolific, releasing nine mixtapes and two officially sanctioned albums before this major-label lunge. By 2010's <i>Kush &amp; Orange Juice</i>, an exceptionally laidback and tasteful mixtape that made him a star, Wiz solidified his identity: affable smoker, limited rapper, inspirational survivor, melodic genius. And all before the age of 23.</p>
<p>Now signed to Atlantic Records, home to compromised contemporaries Lupe Fiasco and B.o.B, Wiz runs the risk of having his loose, gliding style trampled by this new partner's A&amp;R department. That's not quite the case-- <i>Rolling Papers</i> is a singular document with just a handful of exceptions. The album's lead single, the Super Bowl-adopted anthem ""Black and Yellow"", is a driving song, but Wiz seems dazed in the delivery. He has never been a complicated writer, but on a song meant to whip up some frenzy, he is shockingly relaxed. ""<span>Stay high like how I</span>'<span>m supposed to do/ That crowd underneath them clouds can</span>'<span>t get close to you/ And my car look unapproachable/ Super clean but it</span>'<span>s super mean.</span>""</p>
<p><span>These are an abysmal few bars from the song, but they (or any of his lyrics, really) do little to explain Wiz</span>'<span>s appeal. He does atmosphere, and the team of producers here</span>-- <span>a varied bunch that includes Norwegian mercenaries StarGate, Wiz</span>'<span>s in-house crew I.D. Labs, and the Floridian pop-rap savant Jim Jonsin</span>-- <span>has given this album surprising cohesion. It cascades, never rushing into anything. Opener </span>""<span>When I</span>'<span>m Gone</span>""<span> ambles along, a somber piano line playing out softly for nearly a minute before introducing the propulsive guts of the song. Only when Wiz attempts to burst forward, as on disjointed closer </span>""<span>Cameras</span>"",<span> is he susceptible to his own limitations. Ambitions low, tone lower.</span></p>
<p>There's an urge to throw weed metaphors around a Wiz Khalifa review-- it is his love, his leisure, his reason for living. Taking his time is only a product of this blunted life. Which is a boon on ""The Race"", the best song here, a luxurious, decadent ode to success that couldn't sound more like a vacation. But weed is also his curse. Consider the Sublime-like ""Fly Solo"", also produced by I.D. Labs, which is pure dorm-room junk. Or ""No Sleep"", a shameless bid for Benny Blanco-produced house-rap glory. No one could be less suited to this sort of thing than Wiz. Still, if you seek texture and assurance, there are few recent songs as masterfully casual as ""Hopes and Dreams"" and ""Rooftops"", the latter of which features his friend and sonic compatriot Curren$y (one of just three guest spots on this album). The rippling opening notes of ""Hopes and Dreams""-- a far-off guitar strum, a stuttering drum machine, Wiz's dank voice-- are all vibe, all presence, all persistence. Call it mood music for the mindless.</p></div>"|15294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15294-rolling-papers/|7.2|Sean Fennessey

Their theatrical sense was there from the beginning-- we saw band members Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo sitting on motorcycles on the cover of 2003's full-length debut, <i>Chain Gang of Love</i>, and a movie poster tableau for of 2005's dusky <i>Pretty in Black</i>-- but by their 2009 album, <i>In and Out of Control</i>, they had toned down the visuals and made their most aimless record to date.</p>
<p>In concept alone, then, the duo's fifth LP, <i>Raven in the Grave</i>, is a corrective step. The untangled pop of<i> In and Out of Contro</i>l has been reconfigured and dipped in black eyeliner as the Raveonettes veer toward 1980s goth. It's a canny move, since dark sounds and moods have been creeping back into indie after a long stretch of beach-obsessed escapism.</p>
<p>The thing is, darkness isn't the best look for the Raveonettes. The album title suggests a tongue-in-cheek approach, but this might be the band's most joyless release yet. It's not like they're missing the mark on their source material, either. The cloudy, <i>Disintegration</i>-like synths of ""War in Heaven"" and the metallic beat of ""Apparitions"" both suggest their comfort with this material. But there's none of the spiky propulsion that has marked their best music. In the case of one-two fizzle ""Summer Moon"" and ""Let Me on Out"", they seem to have completely forgotten to write melodies. And though lyrics have frequently been placeholders for these guys, the adapted angst on display here is an ill fit. There's a ""War in Heaven"", you see, because ""I hate it/ When they forget/ To let people in."" The problem in ""Evil Seeds"", on the other hand, is that rain causes the protagonist to ""betray the ones I've come to love the most."" These wasted words seem too shoddy even for the back of someone's spiral notebook.</p>
<p>There are spots where light shines in. Three songs, in fact, are among the strongest the Raveonettes have recorded, which makes the album seem like even more of a missed opportunity. Opener ""Recharge &amp; Revolt"" is their most majestic shoegaze moment yet, while ""Ignite"" is a particularly sweet slice of 1990s alt rock, with a thrilling build and sweetly sung yet morbid chorus that suggests the band hasn't completely lost their sense of humor. Then there's ""Forget That You're Young"", which is hands-down the best song on the album and a true career high. It's always hard to tell with this pair, but the latter song comes over as honest and genuine, a potential new way forward for a band that could use one.</p></div>"|15295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15295-raven-in-the-grave/|5.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

Lil B's buzzword doesn't really have a clear definition, but it has, nevertheless, spawned a distinctive aesthetic. A search through music given <a href=""http://bandcamp.com/tag/based"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the ""based"" tag</a> on <i>BandCamp</i> reveals a whole bunch of rambling rappers aping B's free-associative flow and just as many oddball producers putting out home-recorded, sorta stoned-sounding beats that maybe-- just maybe-- Lil B will one day rap over. ""Based"" has evolved from a style of rapping (and a wonky world philosophy) to a know-it-when-you-hear-it sound. New Jersey producer Clams Casino is one of the sonic architects behind ""based music."" His beat for Lil B's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfrZekogXNQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm God""</a>, featuring a stretched-out sample of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpkKPimVjm8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Imogen Heap's ""Just For Now""</a>, is the ""based music"" blueprint.</p>
<p>""I'm God"" isn't included on <i>Instrumental Mixtape</i>; the beats here are even more diffuse, and it wouldn't really fit. It speaks to Clams' rarefied vision that he refuses to find room for an in-demand instrumental on a free download but includes an untitled final track, a bizarre, minute-long footwork-like manipulation of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yVEGAuj8RM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Teddy's Jam""</a> from 1980s new jack swing group Guy. This collection of instrumentals doesn't simply survey Clams' production; it turns his rap beats into moody compositions and flips the basic beat-tape concept into an album-like collection of electronic music.</p>
<p>Clams Casino productions generally bring together conventional hip-hop drums, a sensitive ear for off-to-the-side melodies, and an overdose of oddly moving atmosphere. ""Motivation"" begins with a buzz of in-the-red static and a moaning vocal sample, and then suddenly the beat drops and the vocal sample begins eerily humming along. Later on, blasts of bass rumble through, and animal noises arrive instead of a breakdown. When the beat drops the next time around, it's accompanied by some rainy, <i>Blade Runner</i>-style keyboards. The bird squawks and the keyboard melody are wrapped up in the beat, and it repeats, riding-out for a bit, before abruptly ending with a patch of industrial drone.</p>
<p>But it's Clams' attention to hip-hop structure that makes these beats so emotionally devastating. The desperate melodrama comes through in the hesitant build-up and explosive arrival of the drums. And the lingering sense of sadness is communicated when those drums sneak away and all that's left is a layer of whimpering electronic haze. For all of their experimental tendencies, these songs are essentially, sample-based loops. ""Illest Alive"" is an artful slicing and dicing of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOkUD4ZcEXc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bjork's ""Bachelorette""</a> and as revealed in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42015-rising-clams-casino/"">an interview</a> with Pitchfork last week, ""Realist Alive"" is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW9Fzwuf43c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adele's ""Hometown Glory""</a> slowed, slurred, and made well, glorious. Even those few productions that ape established hip-hop styles, like the Bay Area wobblers ""Brainwash by London"" and ""She's Hot"" maintain this tension between dogged structure and brash experimentation.</p>
<p><i>Instrumental Mixtape</i> makes it clear that Clams Casino is part of an expanding group of up-and-coming innovative rap producers like Araabmuzik, the Block Beattaz, DJ Burn One, Droop-E, and Lex Luger. But his beats, when heard without vocals, become even more interesting and arguably better. Full of subtle production flourishes (pulsing percussion on ""All I Need"", a sliver of flute on ""Numb"", muffled gun-shot sound effects on ""Cold War"") and possessing a true artist's comfort with indulgence (nearly every track is caked with effects), his music can be heard alongside a genre-spanning scene of musicians like How to Dress Well, Tim Hecker, Burial, Toro Y Moi, and James Blake, all of whom mine the oddly melancholic effect of digital glitch.</p></div>"|15292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15292-instrumental-mixtape/|8.2|Brandon Soderberg

This year, Snoop will make a few stops on Charlie Sheen's continuous-trainwreck Violent Torpedo of Truth tour, performing a song that he and Sheen have apparently recorded together. That duality is pretty much circa-2011 Snoop in a nutshell. He's a rap legend, and he's also an unapologetically inane public figure, someone who's more famous for being famous than he is for rapping. He seems to enjoy both roles in equal measure. And so late-period Snoop albums become weird, uncentered artifacts, with no real idea or consistent personality pulling them all together. You get sweeping attempts at crossover hits, nasty street-rap throwbacks, and bizarre cross-genre collaborations that any self-aware A&amp;R never would've allowed. And even though Snoop is nowhere near the commercial force he once was, he can still round up a fuckton of famous people whenever he decides to record an album. Not too many artists would bury their Kanye West collaborations on track 18 of their albums, but that's what Snoop does on <i>Doggumentary</i>, his latest reminder to the world that he's still an active musician.</p>
<p>More than many of Snoop's recent efforts, <i>Doggumentary</i> has something of a sonic identity. Snoop mines slick, slapbass-heavy 1980s R&amp;B and computer-funk on the album, working with producers like Fredwreck, Jake One, and Battlecat to conjure the smooth soul of the early Reagan era. Another rap veteran recently did great things with that same loose aesthetic playground: Big Boi on last year's excellent <i>Sir Lucious Left Foot</i>. But where Big Boi and his collaborators attacked that stuff with a giddy sense of experimental joy, Snoop just lets it sit there, as if his older-than-time persona will be enough to sell whatever he wants. And so vast stretches of the way-too-long <i>Doggumentary</i> drift by, making no impression whatsoever.</p>
<p>Snoop is still a perfectly capable rapper, but he doesn't let off a single memorable line on the whole album. Instead, his greatest strengths now are his delivery-- he can stick right to whatever beat the world throws at him-- and his wizened, familiar voice. Since neither of these things has changed in the past decade, every new Snoop verse feels like a verse we've heard before, with the possible exception of the parts of the gently moralistic ""Peer Pressure"" where Snoop tells kids to project inner strength and resist alcohol and drugs-- messages that directly contradict almost every other song on his album.</p>
<p>With Snoop more often than not acting as a big blank at the center of his own album, many of the best moments on <i>Doggumentary</i> belong to his collaborators: E-40 letting loose tumbling flows over chaotic Rick Rock production on ""My Fucn House"", R. Kelly bringing regal grace to an eerie Lex Luger beat on ""Platinum"", Devin the Dude's loping everydude warmth on the otherwise shameful ""I Don't Need No Bitch"". As for Snoop himself, the best parts come in the moments where he stops rapping altogether and sings instead, or where he raps so easily that he might as well be singing. It's surprising that he doesn't do that more often here, since the mostly-sung ""Sensual Seduction"" was his last serious solo hit. And here we get ""Boom"", with Snoop skipping lazily over a sample of Yazoo's deathless electro classic ""Situation"", and ""Wet""-- a song inexplicably written for Prince William's bachelor party-- where Snoop intones freaky come-ons through heavy Auto-Tune over the Cataracts' spaced-out synth squirts.</p>
<p>And then there's ""Superman"", the acoustic-ramble Willie Nelson duet that absolutely shouldn't work but somehow does. Snoop and Willie are both braided, weed-addicted elder-statesman outlaw figures, so it makes sense that they'd get along. But this song, like the supremely silly 2008 Everlast collab ""My Medicine"", shows that Snoop's gravelly drawl is pretty well-suited for country music. If he ever decides to push himself again, that's one direction available to him. But let's be serious: Snoop Dogg is not pushing himself anytime soon.</p></div>"|15303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15303-doggumentary/|5.5|Tom Breihan

Leading the way this year is Yuck, with their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled LP</a>; now emerging from the DIY scene that spawned the like-minded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28096-male-bonding/"" target=""_blank"">Male Bonding</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28100-pens/"" target=""_blank"">Pens</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28204-spectrals/"" target=""_blank"">Spectrals</a>, London-via-Manchester quartet Mazes make a commendable entry into that realm with their FatCat debut, <i>A Thousand Heys.</i></p>
<p>Lacking the comprehensive guitar sprawl of Yuck or the arty abrasiveness of Male Bonding, Mazes instead embody the shambling approach to verse-chorus songwriting found in Pavement acolytes BOAT. It's the sort of stuff dubbed ""slacker"" because it gives the impression that its consciously chosen smart-dumb persona could be overcome with effort. From the lyrical standpoint of <i>A Thousand Heys</i>, the outside world is indeed a terrordome of obligations, demands, and entanglements that are best left to others to sort out. A sampling of singer Jack Cooper's aspirations: ""I wanna sit at home without a job,"" ""I never want anyone to have my name,"" or most pointedly, ""I never want to get out of bed, no way."" But it's all delivered in a tart, smart-alecky voice that lets you know it's inertia rather than crippling depression that gets him to this point.</p>
<p>Despite the brisk tempos and the frazzled guitar tone, it's all too approachable to classify as punk rather than power pop. The hook of ""Surf &amp; Turf / Maths Tag"" has exquisite classic rock architecture, belying Cooper's tendency to treat life as a spectator sport: ""I've lived a thousand days/ A thousand heys were thrown my way/ I get off trains and wave like Beatles at JFK."" Call a song titled ""Go Betweens"" too on-the-nose if you must, but the exuberant chorus blasts off in such a way that the namedrop is earned.</p>
<p>But as <i>A Thousand Heys </i>progresses, as the hooks soften around the edges, its derivativeness comes to the forefront. ""Boxing Clever"" is little more than adroit Pavement karaoke, while ""Wait Anyway"" and ""Cenetaph"" make an ill-advised dip into bite-sized Crazy Horse guitar jams. Even stranger is how ""Vampire Jive"" and ""Eva"" blur by in a minute and a half combined; all of a sudden the album's center has disappeared, and <i>Heys </i>is damn near over.</p>
<p>Though it boasts a couple of heaters, <i>A Thousand Heys </i>butts up against the same problem faced by so many others working in this timeless but relatively basic template-- there are undoubtedly listeners who won't ever get enough of this stuff, but how can you distinguish yourself while still maintaining the spirit of your predecessors? Had the precocious spark of the first half been duplicated in the second, there'd be more than enough big choruses to make it a moot point-- a single ""hey!"" can have more impact than a thousand lesser ones.</p></div>"|15228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15228-a-thousand-heys/|6.2|Ian Cohen

It's a scarcity thing: Instead of flooding the market with music, he keeps fans wanting, and he and the labels he works with know how to capitalize on that desire. A limited, vinyl-only collaboration with Thom Yorke and Four Tet, on the latter's Text Records, was released with only a week's advance notice and sold out in no time. With the exception of the limited, vinyl-only pressing, Hyperdub followed a similar strategy for this release, Burial's first new solo material since 2007, and label boss Kode9 helped build the anticipation by premiering tracks on Benji B's BBC radio show.</p>
<p>Not many electronic producers can command that type of hype. Fortunately, Burial hasn't disappointed us. Anyone who feared that he might have moved on to a new sound-- perhaps, like James Blake, embracing pop songwriting-- can breathe a sigh of relief: This is the same melancholic Burial we've known and loved from the beginning. But listeners who wondered if the formula might be wearing thin, diluting itself amidst all the rainy pitter-patter and tear-stained chords, can also breathe easy. While sticking to the emotional terrain he's known for, Burial also subtly pushes his sound in new directions.</p>
<p>""Street Halo"" is the closest Burial has come yet to the straighter cadence of house and techno, with shuffling hi-hats and a crunchy handclap/fingersnap sound accentuating the 4/4 pulse; the middling tempo backs off dubstep's quick snap and eases into a relaxed, rolling house groove. The backbeat bassline even recalls, however unconsciously, Ricardo Villalobos' ""Dexter"", which isn't necessarily as absurd as it sounds: Both artists have a thing for accidental syncopations and splintering percussion. As always, Burial's beats are oblique, with a hazy percussive clatter lurking behind crisp, timekeeping accents. And again, he has made mournful, a cappella vocals the melodic focus of the track, and everything is suffused in a suggestive layer of static and grit. But he's a masterful arranger, frequently switching up elements-- focusing one minute on a blunt, rave-inspired bassline, and the next on supersaturated vocal harmonies that sound like overdriven Cocteau Twins. The track follows a counterintuitive logic, abandoning the predictable structure of breakdowns and buildups in favor of twists and turns you don't see coming, including a fake fade-out at the end.</p>
<p>The second track, ""NYC"", is even better. It's got all the yearning you could want from Burial, thanks to its keening vocal lead and stately synthesizer pads. Taking his virtual razor to a long strip of female vocals, he seems to have cut and pitch-shifted it in such a way that it hangs in the balance between meaning and pure sound, with slippery nonsense syllables giving way to clearer phrases (""...when I'm around"") loaded with ambiguous emotion. Rhythmically, Burial takes up the staggered cadences of UK garage, long a favorite of his, but he slows the tempo to around 115 bpm. It's a brilliant move, giving garage's whipcrack syncopations an additional spring in their step; when combined with those floating keyboards and vocals, the groove feels almost deliriously buoyant. (As a visual analogy, I'm reminded of the underwater acrobatics in the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6eewqgGs_Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video for Portishead's ""Only You""</a>, which turns out to make a superb visual accompaniment to Burial's screwed kinetics.) It's strange to think that so few producers have explored grooves like this at similar tempos; in Burial's hands, it's a perfect merger of the pensive and the sensual.</p>
<p>""Stolen Dog"" is also based upon a mid-tempo house groove, but the rhythm is less urgent than on the other two tracks, its elements restricted to a thumping kick drum, faint hi-hat tick, and faint, syncopated rimshots signaling the distant ghost of 2-step garage. There's a sing-song feel to the lilting synthesizer melody and the layered vocals over the top; it feels almost like a lullaby, with soothing chord changes doing their best to keep the darkness at bay, as dissonant bursts and ghostly clatter loom in the background. It might be the least essential of the three tracks here, but it's every bit as carefully thought out. Somehow, despite a sound bank that has long since become familiar, Burial keeps finding new ideas to animate his worn, mournful samples.</p></div>"|15293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15293-street-halo/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

In most cases, that sort of statement would come off as defensive, but with Based God, it's actually something of an invitation. As a cult of personality artist with a seemingly endless capacity for productivity, Lil B's career is singular but very difficult to categorize or navigate. For newcomers, there is no single document that serves as a proper introduction-- not even the supposedly comprehensive <i>Free Music: The Complete MySpace Collection</i> will do, because it consists of <i>676 tracks</i> and none of them is ""Wonton Soup"".</p>
<p>His self-awareness aside, I can't say whether <i>Illusions of Grandeur</i>-- Lil B's most cohesive and coherent collection of songs in a long time--<i> </i>is an acknowledgement of the weirdly ephemeral nature of his musical output. In places it appears to be an olive branch to the Okayplayer faction of rap fans who view him as a scourge upon the supposed purity of the genre. That's what I got out of the pre-leak version of ""Based 4 Ya Face"", which boasted a Public Enemy-sampling 9th Wonder beat and verses from ""real hip-hop"" torchbearers Jean Grae and Phonte (a solo version is included here). 9th Wonder fits surprisingly well; there is a nice synthesis between B's slack cadence and 9th's unobtrusive soul simmer. In addition, <i>Illusions </i>is B at his most grounded topically and lyrically. For the most part, he's back in his Berkeley homebase, remembering zoned-out hours spent in coffee shops, surveying the endless and depressing cycle of violence, speaking directly to his fans and detractors, and carrying an attitude that appears at odds with his flippant, uncensored approach to music-making: he <i>really cares</i>.</p>
<p>Of course, Lil B's buffet-style consumption experience and stream-of-consciousness flow are still in place. Listening to him at times is like panning for gold-- you get some real nuggets, but you have to work for each one. For those who want to put in the effort, though-- and there a lot of people who do-- B seems to shapeshift into whatever form the listener chooses. The title track and ""Cocaine Killer"" can be viewed as some incredibly ill-formed storytelling if taken as linear narrative, or as the stray thoughts indigenous to the harried nickel-and-dime hustler. There are pop-culture non sequiturs that make the Kool Keith comparisons apt, and there are startlingly cogent revelations.</p>
<p><i>Illusions of Grandeur</i>, therefore, is as erratic as we've come to expect; despite the record being relatively ""cohesive"" and ""coherent"" for Lil B, it's also a conservative addition to his catalog. While <i>Illusions</i> will certainly earn B some brownie points from those who like their hip-hop lyrical, this approach doesn't get to the core of why Lil B has resonated with so many people. Then again, Based God's probably got something already cooked up that'll please his core fanbase.</p></div>"|15291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15291-illusions-of-grandeur/|6.0|Ian Cohen

The Chems are known for welding techno beats to a distinctly rock aesthetic, and for much of the past 10 years they have functioned exactly like a rock band: standard album-tour-relax schedule, few collaborations, monster festival-headliner gigs. (And they can refer to themselves as ""superstar DJs"" all they like, but their last widely available DJ mix came out in 1998.) For fans of the Brothers, <i>Hanna </i>represents the shockingly rare opportunity to hear a work by the duo whose intentions fall outside their longtime M.O. of making techno for rock fans.</p>
<p>I haven't seen <i>Hanna</i>; it appears to be a thriller set in Eastern Europe with a young female protagonist-- gifted in the art of action-- who eludes a ruthless intelligence operative. Digitized techno mysticism has been a go-to soundtrack of choice for this genre ever since <i>The Bourne Identity</i> rubber-stamped <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTIkDmNVJeA&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moby's ""Extreme Ways""</a> as the perfect mix of heady paranoia, Euro style, and kicking things. The Chems-- with their widescreen sound, relentless bravado, and sturdy belief in entertainment-as-art-- are well suited for this kind of work.</p>
<p><i>Hanna</i> sounds a lot like a standard Chemical Brothers album--
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
saturated, acidic keyboards; thundering drums; styles and signifiers used to bludgeon-- but with a bit more room to breathe. The band isn't deft enough to avoid the mewling vocals and tinkly music-box of the repeated ""Hanna's Theme"" (pathos: noted) but it's also not deft enough to apply any subtlety or grace to the Eastern scales and pulsing 2-4 beat of ""Escape 700"", which is kind of the point. This is a band accustomed to soundtracking a light show that would put most stadium rock bands to shame; the chances of them easing off the gas or thinking too hard about the marriage of music and cinema were slim.</p>
<p>The soundtrack offers some of the hard-charging thrills the Chems avoided on <i>Further</i>, and it does so in an environment in which the onus of excitement isn't placed solely on the duo. This results in some terribly limp interstitial ""atmospheres""-- the Chems have never had the stomach for this kind of track; they sometimes seem bored (I am)-- but they add welcome contrast to their car-chase songs. <i>Hanna</i> aims for mystery and portent, a slight but welcome tonal shift from the band's urban, galactic edginess. The louche grooves of ""Car Chase (Arp Worship)"" are a bad fit for the steadily gaining tension they refer to, but its beefy synthesizer roundhouse is the album's most head-nodding moment. They can't help but pepper ""The Devil Is in the Beats"" with the type of goofily serious vocal nonsense (""Rock the beat!"") they've always traded in.</p>
<p><i>Hanna </i>mostly wins in the sea of Hollywood action soundtracks, but it's marginal as a Chemical Brothers album (I prefer it to their dry, overstuffed mid-decade works). The Chems have rarely acknowledged anything outside their own blinding neon aesthetic, which is to say that not only would the Chems never know they were in a creative rut, they would be unlikely to believe in ruts. <i>Hanna</i> doesn't represent anything more than a slight change-up from a group used to throwing fastballs.</p></div>"|15289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15289-hanna-ost/|6.2|Andrew Gaerig

Though often addressed to a love interest either real or imagined, <i>Idle Labor </i>is above all a lonely album that rarely betrays its origin as a solo project. Sonically it recalls Wild Nothing it the way it mines a large swath of 1980s synth pop, but its clear emotional tenor gives it a distinguishing perspective and personality.</p>
<p><i>Idle Labor</i> exists in a time frame best described by the title of its ebullient centerpiece-- ""After the Moment"". These are sketches of romantic problems and solutions with the wounds still fresh and the thoughts uncensored. Taken as a whole, it could be read as a narrative following Vallesteros from heartbreak to infatuation and back, a few months' worth of romantic uncertainty boiled down to a taut and hooky album.</p>
<p>In a maundering yearn somewhere between Jens Lekman and Ian Curtis, Vallesteros introduces himself as a lovelorn melodramatist over sunstroked, near-Balearic pop. But as the narrative begins to hint at physical contact, the music works in lockstep, and Vallestreros builds tracks more as a dance producer than a singer-songwriter. And that's where he hits his stride-- while his vocals remain a central fixture, the post-punk mordancy is softened by locomotive arrangements that stack synth pads, ringing guitar, and primitive drum programming.</p>
<p>""Party Talk"" starts a mid-album mini-suite with Vallesteros as a nebbishy Woody Allen character trying to decode a mutual romantic connection from casual conversation. But he leaps forward during the upbeat ""From the Morning Heat"", and by the fantastic morning-after celebration ""After the Moment"", something has apparently clicked; Vallesteros repeats the chorus as if he knows it's the best he's written.</p>
<p>The emotional high is predictably short-lived, and even within its brief half-hour runtime, more than a few of the melodies take detours and left turns. ""The Fog Rose High"" has the feel of a gothier Beach Fossils, while the anodyne dream-pop scruff of ""You Should Close the Door"" could have been a Radio Dept. B-side. But as with so many bedroom auteurs' debuts, it's tough to separate the creation from the creator, and <i>Idle Labor</i> shows the promise of a precocious songwriter who isn't claiming to have anything totally figured out just yet.</p></div>"|15280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15280-idle-labor/|7.7|Ian Cohen

Dismemberment Plan bassist Eric Axelson and former Promise Ring drummer Dan Didier are among the most muscular and interesting players to emerge from mid-to-late-90s indie rock, and expectations were high for Maritime's 2004 debut, <i>Glass Floor</i>, to capitalize on the well-documented energy of both bands. For many who harbored such expectation-- myself, admittedly, included-- <i>Glass Floor</i> was a baffling disappointment, a seemingly flat and lifeless album from musicians who had proven themselves capable of so much more.</p>
<p>Three consistent and thoroughly enjoyable albums later, it seems clear that <i>Glass Floor</i> was not a misstep, but rather the first step toward something different; simply put, Maritime do not create rhythm section music. While both the Dismemberment Plan and the Promise Ring often thrived on fast-paced collisions between complex and memorable individual parts, Maritime take a more holistic approach, often anchored by former Promise Ring vocalist Davey von Bohlen's ever-evolving melodic focus. Von Bohlen, whose minimal yelps were central to the Promise Ring's appeal, has grown into a mature and expressive singer; he not only sounds fully in control of his own voice, but he also seems more willing than ever before to let loose with a little bit of flair and panache.</p>
<p>The second Maritime album since Axelson's departure and the addition of bassist Justin Klug, <i>Human Hearts</i> comes off as the most studio-centric batch of Maritime songs yet, a well-constructed but less immediate foray in texture and layering. Opener ""It's Casual"" crams the emotional meat and bones of its chorus into a single vocal harmony, a well-timed and well-executed gesture made all the more powerful by the space that surrounds it. ""Black Bones"" is evocative in its tone and setting, pulling back to emphasize von Bohlen's vocals whenever the song threatens to buckle under the weight of its own atmosphere.</p>
<p>Still, Maritime are at their most undeniable when they really lay into it. ""Annihilation Eyes"" may be the best song they've ever recorded, making full use of guitarist Dan Hinz's spiky guitar lines to spruce up a solid midtempo rocker. Hinz continues to be Maritime's secret weapon, his angular, high-on-the-neck playing adding post-punk bite to songs that occasionally lean a little bit too heavily on mood and ambiance. Von Bohlen's increasingly self-possessed vocal style flatters his writing immensely here, as lines that previously might have seemed offputtingly precious now register as winks and not whimpers.</p>
<p>That Maritime have released their third straight solid record is encouraging, but no longer particularly surprising. Yes, a high-profile indie rock pedigree can be an albatross; but it's also a pretty good indicator that a band will have the experience and foresight to weather unreasonable expectations and fight the good fight. Maritime's musical development has become a compelling narrative of its own, each subsequent record in many ways both improving upon and elucidating the last.</p></div>"|15298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15298-human-hearts/|7.2|Matt LeMay

The film is set in the year 2027, and at one point a deejay overheard on a car radio introduces ""a blast from the past all the way back to 2003,"" before spinning the Kills' country-blues serenade ""Wait"". Even if 2003 was only eight years ago, for the Kills, it might as well be 24, given how far Alison Mosshart and Jamie Hince have been able to push the limited parameters of their guitar/drum-machine set-up and develop an identity increasingly distinct from their formative junior-Royal-Trux roots.</p>
<p>But even as the Kills have gone from covering Captain Beefheart on their debut 2002 EP, <i>Black Rooster</i>, to teaming up with Spank Rock producer XXXChange for 2008's electro-fied <i>Midnight Boom</i>, Mosshart and Hince have always conveyed a sense of anxiety and nervous energy through their music. And the duo's lusty performances eagerly play up the ambiguity of their platonic partnership. It's a quality that defines them as much as Mosshart's feverish moan, Hince's hand-slashing guitar riffs, and the synthetic beats-- <a href=""http://www.google.ca/search?q=%E2%80%9CThe+Kills+%2B+sexual+tension.%E2%80%9D&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=MFU&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22the+kills%22+%22sexual+tension%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=f67e76f730404817"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">just Google ""the Kills + sexual tension.""</a> And even though the will-they/won't-they question has been <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-kills-guitarist-jamie-hince-is-engaged-to-kate-moss-20110203"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">definitively tilted toward the latter</a>, that doesn't mean the Kills can't continue to summon that frisson through roleplay. But on <i>Blood Pressures</i>, there's a creeping sense that their individual preoccupations outside the band-- Mosshart as Jack White's feisty foil in the Dead Weather; Hince as the paparazzi-hounded fiancé of the world's most famous <a href=""http://www.popeater.com/2011/02/03/kate-moss-jamie-hince-engaged/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">supermodel</a>-- has diffused some of that intensity, as the duo attempts to evolve its dynamic.</p>
<p>Sonically, <i>Blood Pressures</i> retreats from <i>Midnight Boom</i>'s dancefloor directives and energized, in-the-pocket pop. The new album feels at once a return to the Kills' beatbox-blues origins as well an attempt to broaden their palette with more sensitive, intimate turns. Notwithstanding the motorik garage-rock of ""Heart Is a Beating Drum"" and brash, big-beat stomp ""Nail in My Coffin"", this album will present Hince and Mosshart with fewer opportunities to stare each other down suggestively on stage in predatory, fuck-or-fight fashion. Whether it's the swampy reggae groove of ""Satellite"", the clock-punching blues-rock prowl ""Damned if She Do"", or the mid-album tandem of Hince's Lennon-esque reverie ""Wild Charms"" and Mosshart's slow-simmering answer track ""DNA"", there's an overarching sense of restraint and resignation that's disappointing in light of how fearless and adrenalized the band sounded on <i>Midnight Boom</i>.</p>
<p>On that album's standout moments (the desperation of ""Last Day of Magic"", the spiky outbursts of ""Tape Song""), you could hear Mosshart really pushing herself to project a more passionate persona from behind the Kills' ultra-cool, cigarette-smoky pose. By contrast, <i>Blood Pressures</i>' would-be emotional centerpiece The Last Goodbye"" is a maudlin piano ballad <span>that</span> feels oddly disaffected, with Mosshart singing in an overly poised, uncharacteristically lower register as if trying to channel some aging-diva caricature. A far better barometer of the Kills' maturation is the more understated but infinitely more affecting ""Baby Says"", a melancholic Mosshart/Hince duet set to a steady backbeat, ideal for filling in the awkward silences on a couples-retreat road trip gone bad. In other words, it's precisely the sort of interstate love song that the golden-oldies DJs of 2027 will be all over.</p></div>"|15288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15288-blood-pressures/|6.4|Stuart Berman

From 2004 to 2006, Clipse were down and out, forgotten by their label even though they'd made a hit album, written off by an industry that preferred its crack-sales talk bigger and dumber. And the group responded by making their best music ever, exceeding even their great debut, <i>Lord Willin'</i>, with the two <i>Got It 4 Cheap </i>mixtapes and <i>Hell Hath No Fury. </i>On these records, Pusha and older brother Malice projected raw, unbridled animosity rendered in dense, twisty language that showed them to be two of the best writers of their rap generation. But after those displays of hunger, ferocity, and intelligence, they went on autopilot, cranking out a few mixtapes and another album that sounded utterly tapped-out and devoid of inspiration.</p>
<p>A year ago, the group's critical and commercial future looked dim, and Malice embarked on an unexpected religious journey that led him to write a Bible-informed memoir. And all of a sudden, Pusha seems to be closer to stardom than he ever came in the Clipse. Kanye West snapped him up as a solo artist and made him the linchpin of Kanye's G.O.O.D. Music roster. Pusha got to step onstage at the VMAs in a ""Miami Vice""-looking dinner jacket and deliver a shattering closing verse on ""Runaway"", and Kanye made room for Pusha verses in a ton of his G.O.O.D. Friday mp3s. Now Pusha has a label boss who appears to have full faith in him, and that label boss happens to be the most visionary producer in rap today. If ever there was a time for Pusha to make good on all his underdog promise, this is it. Instead, he's given us a mixtape so flat and lazy that I almost don't know why it exists at all.</p>
<p><i>Fear of God</i> is less than 40 minutes long, and too much of that running time is given over to pointless freestyles over well-circulated tracks, or to tracks so flimsy that they barely exist. This is when Pusha should be establishing himself as a major artist, not freestyling over Soulja Boy's ""Speakers Going Hammer"". On opening song ""My God"", Pusha snarls, ""Bear witness as I unveil this instant classic,"" but nothing about the tape suggests that he's interested in making any sort of classic. Pusha has some serious gifts in his favor: a great snarling delivery, a vivid eye for detail, a writer's gift for getting well-trod ideas across in ways nobody could've expected. But too often on <i>Fear of God</i>, he's just filling space with flat, workmanlike rhyme patterns and out-of-gas punchlines: ""Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault."" ""Touch It"", in which Pusha and Kanye beg for head, is the weakest Kanye West track in years, complete with a beat that must've been sitting around Kanye's hard drive forever. And on ""Open Your Eyes"", producer Nottz turns ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" into pitched-up chipmunk soul, which nobody ever needed to hear. On too much of <i>Fear of God</i>, nobody even seems to be trying.</p>
<p>But when the mixtape does crackle to life, we see a whole other side of the solo rapper Pusha could be. ""Raid"" has an absolutely vicious piano-driven Neptunes beat and an on-fire cameo from 50 Cent, and Pusha raises his game accordingly, giving his most energetic performance of the mixtape. And on ""I Still Wanna"", he shares a churning, operatic Rick Ross-type beat with Ross himself, and everyone comes out sounding bloodthirsty. If Pusha had made a whole mixtape of songs like these, it would've been incredible.</p>
<p>Otherwise, though, it's just a confusing affair. On his G.O.O.D. Friday tracks and his <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> verses, Pusha sounded like Kanye had lit a fire up under him; that fire seems nothing but a barely-glowing ember through most of <i>Fear of God</i>. And considering the amount of faith Kanye seems to have in Pusha, I can't understand why he'd do so little to prove Kanye right. At the beginning of his freestyle over Jay-Z's ""Can I Live"", Pusha says that he's recording at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi. If that's true-- and it might be-- it makes no sense. Pusha shouldn't have to leave his basement to record a ""Can I Live"" freestyle. And unless that freestyle turns out to be as sharp as what he was doing on <i>We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 2</i>, he shouldn't even be letting us hear it. Right now, I'm just hoping Pusha makes an album strong enough that we can all pretend <i>Fear of God</i> never happened.</p></div>"|15277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15277-fear-of-god/|5.6|Tom Breihan

Her third album reflects these developments in its more robust, full-band sound as well as in the writing credits she shares with her husband and father. Musically, Diane sounds more settled on these songs, with the road-tested band bolstering her distinctive vocals and helping to mold her songwriting into slightly more dynamic shapes.</p>
<p>In other words, those pesky comparisons to old friend Joanna Newsom no longer apply. Diane trades fraught freak folk for dusty country-rock that recalls the rough-and-tumble outlaw hits of Jessi Colter and Rita Coolidge, if they were backed by the Flying Burrito Brothers. Like those two singers, there's something both slick and scuffed up about Diane's vocals; rather than otherworldly, she sounds deeply rooted in our own world, with a soulful delivery that illuminates the galloping ""White Horse"" and opener ""To Begin"". ""Heartless Highway"" (with its subtle reference to 1970s underground Nashville documentary <i>Heartworn Highways</i>) is a lonely tour song written in Germany, and while there are literally hundreds of songs about this subject, Diane imbues it with a tough-minded homesickness, as if she's working through the heartache to get to the next show.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Diane can be just as startling as ever, employing a stream-of-conscious style that bends toward unexpected details or strange turns of phrase. ""Amidst the gold, there is dust in every heart,"" she sings on ""Of Many Colors"", which is, oddly enough, an ode to her new husband. Her songwriting hasn't lost any of its barbs, so that when she makes a fanfare of the words ""There is good, there is still good"" on closer ""Rising Greatness"", it resonates all the more forcefully.</p>
<p>Whether navigating the rocky rapids of ""White Horse"" or decorating ""The Wind"" with pedal steel teardrops and mandolin trills, Wild Divine craft agile arrangements that echo British folk music and American roots. If they lapse into gentle lite-folk anonymity at times, it's because they're more interested in supporting Diane's vocals than in living up to their name. That's a wise strategy, as Diane's appeal is based squarely on her husk-dry voice delivering those thorny lyrics, but this self-titled album gives the impression that they're constantly aware of holding back. Such restraint is ultimately unwarranted: Diane is a strong enough presence as a singer and as a songwriter that she can more than hold her own.</p></div>"|15276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15276-alela-diane-wild-divine/|7.5|Stephen M.

Still, sometimes it's necessary, especially when an artist's background carries certain expectations. J.Rocc has spent decades in the turntablist vanguard as part of the Beat Junkies, has an enviable position as Madlib's go-to DJ, and for years has been a regular contributor to Stones Throw and Now-Again. But if you come to his new release, <i>Some Cold Rock Stuf</i>, expecting familiar beat-tape material, virtuosity, or amped-up reworkings of 1970s funk breaks, prepare to be disoriented by a series of warnings: ""The secret is not apparent to the casual listener,"" ""I like the quiet moment, and this song is that. If you're not in that sort of a mood then you can always take it off,"" ""If you do not want to hear, other people want to hear.""</p>
<p><i>Some Cold Rock Stuf </i>bumps heavy here and there, and old heads will smile in recognition at the leadoff track (""Rocchead's Delight""), which updates that old De La Soul interstitial, ""Cool Breeze on the Rocks"". But the slippery thing about this album is that it seems calculated to make your head swim instead of nod. <i>Some Cold Rock Stuf</i> wades through hazy psychedelic ground that resembles introspective, mid-90s trip-hop more than the futurism of contemporary underground West Coast beat-music. If the trippier moments approach the acid-fried fringes of the Gaslamp Killer, they lack his fine-tuned ear for exciting abrasion; if the mud-fidelity loops and international dalliances are simpatico with Madlib, it lacks his idea-shuffling brevity.</p>
<p>That personality deficit would be easier to overlook without some odd sequencing at work. The first track's hyperactive sample montage sinks right into the quicksand of ""Don't Sell Your Dream (Tonight)"", a woozy amalgamation of parched guitars, wind noises, and codeine drum breaks that threatens to lull the listener into a daze. It's an early transition that's almost as bewildering as the album's wound-down conclusion, ""The Truth"", an Ambien lurch laced with a weepy, disembodied string loop and ultra-minimalist snares and kickdrums. But the slow start and slower finish belie a somewhat livelier middle section. The Bollywood-tinged ""Party"", the carnival atmosphere of fuzz/funk/Tropicália splice-job ""Play This (Also)"", and the vintage b-boy Latin breakbeat of ""Too Many Clowns"" feel like they were airlifted in from a completely different album to jolt this one out of its stupor. If this record's trying to impart some sort of consistent personality, it's a hard one to grasp.</p>
<p>But hard to grasp isn't necessarily the same as hard to like. And while the uptempo cuts are the most immediate pleasures, even the foggier bits have a way of insinuating themselves into your head. When the bleary-eyed stuff expands into something with a bit more kick, it's easier to appreciate what J.Rocc was shooting for-- slow-building meditations. ""Chasing the Sun"" starts off as another spaced-out, chant-driven ether frolic-- and then it ratchets up the jitteriness and intensity of the break and integrates a stirring piano loop. And while the re-stitched, sax-driven jazz of ""Malcolm Was Here (Part 1+2)"" sinks you into a hypnotic swing-beat groove at first, there's a bracing hairpin turn toward tense John Carpenter g-funk in its leftfield second half.</p>
<p><i>Some Cold Rock Stuf </i>makes more sense as a collection of scattered concept pieces than a unified statement. Prospective buyers who want a potential escape hatch from the feature presentation are treated to a special gimmick thrown in with a physical purchase-- a ""mystery disc,"" one of three randomly-selected EPs containing a handful of unlabeled, untitled bonus cuts. And while that's a fun idea for an extra, it's not like the first disc isn't enigmatic enough.</p></div>"|15269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15269-some-cold-rock-stuf/|6.8|Nate Patrin

""We deserve each other."" Moore might've been kidding, but he was onto something. If ""jam band"" means what Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_band"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a>-- ""extended musical improvisation over rhythmic grooves and chord patterns""-- then it's not a stretch to say Sonic Youth belong to a lineage of underground jam bands. Start with the guitar forays of Velvet Underground and Television, move through the krautrock of Can and Faust, then dive into droners Spacemen 3 and Acid Mothers Temple and feedback hounds Bardo Pond and Dead Meadow. All are more inclined toward punk edge and avant-garde dissonance than Phish, of course. But it's undeniable that they all like to jam.</p>
<p>If you buy this idea even a little, you'll probably dig Chris Forsyth's <i>Paranoid Cat. </i>It begins with a title track that's essentially 21 minutes of jamming, albeit a thoughtful, well-planned kind. Forsyth has always put care into even the most chaotic music by his other band, the unclassifiable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28296-peeesseye/"">Peeesseye</a>, and he maintains that approach here. Interlocking his roaming guitar with the pedal steel of Marc Orleans and piano of Hans Chew, Forsyth unfurls the winding three-part opener in ways that evoke all the acts mentioned above. But there's also a folk twang that brings to mind early-1970s Neil Young, and a symphonic repetition that recalls Glenn Branca's <i>Lesson No. 1.</i> Imagine Branca's ensemble covering ""Down by the River"", and you have some idea of this track's particular magic.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Paranoid Cat </i>maintains that vibe pretty well. ""New Pharmacist Boogie"" is garage rock with the drums erased, evoking a beat-less take on jammy Velvet Underground tracks like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdBwxDBXQSk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Booker T.""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg44BKJhqk0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Melody Laughter""</a>. Closer ""Anniversary Day"" starts out like Galaxie 500 covering ""Heroin"", then floats into more Young-style pastoral drift. But don't let all these comparisons mislead you-- <i>Paranoid Cat </i>is by no means derivative. It's more like historical musical commentary, an amalgam of time-tested sounds that adds new insights to what it echoes. Besides, even if <i>Paranoid Cat </i>belongs to some underground jam-band canon, it's rather unparalleled today. Jim O'Rourke's longer-form pieces swim in the same water; some of what MV &amp; EE do when chasing Neil Young comes close; and Bardo Pond are still valiantly taking hits off of this kind of loose expansion. But as tempting as it is to keep searching for influences in <i>Paranoid Cat</i>'s stretched-out essays, zoning out to its thoughtful strains is even more fun.</p></div>"|15278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15278-paranoid-cat/|7.1|Marc Masters

The Lips often veer to the darker side of psych, especially recently (see their 2009 dread-filled opus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13522-embryonic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Embryonic</i></a>)<i>, </i>while Palomo deals in a day-glo take on 1980's pop. So when Wayne Coyne revealed that they were banging out a fast collaboration-- as he <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/wayne-coyne-flaming-lips-plans-2011"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">put it</a>, ""that shit should be ready to go pretty quickly""-- the first question that came to mind was whether the result would lean more toward sun or shadows.</p>
<p>That's settled immediately by the opener on this four-track, 22-minute EP, the ominously titled ""Is David Bowie Dying?"" It's not completely clear what the lyrics have to do with Bowie's potential demise, but the music feels like an elegy, a kind of spaced-out funeral march. With its slow, crunchy beat, cutting sonic debris, and Coyne's weary intonations, it would fit well among <i>Embryonic</i>'s doomy mantras. ""Take your legs and run/ To the death rays of the sun,"" he sings with resignation, followed by a stoic chant of ""goodbye, goodbye."" It's pretty morose, but hypnotic and fully-realized-- impressively so considering how quickly it was made.</p>
<p>The rest of the record shares those dark qualities-- much of it is stark, cavernous, and full of murky low end. But the other three tracks are less polished, more loose and experimental. Which is not to suggest they're somehow unfinished. Their sounds are more suited to an amorphous form, making it tough to tell exactly what Palomo contributed. Even on ""Alan's Theremin""-- an eight-minute soundscape that ranks with the weirdest stuff by either act-- there's no telling what came from that instrument (or even if he actually used one). But Palomo's anonymity reflects an internal coherence. This isn't a case of musicians who just met randomly throwing sounds at each other. As unpredictable as the music can be, very little comes off as gratuitous or out of place.</p>
<p>Still, if you're looking for something as song-like as ""Is David Bowie Dying?"", stick around for the closer. As with the first cut, its title-- ""Do You Want New Wave or Do You Want the Truth Part 2""-- makes a specific reference, in this case to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVTWhgXce0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Minutemen song</a>. But again, how the music relates to that title isn't overt. The track sounds more like a krautrock jam, with a muffled bass groove that could've been ripped from a Can outtake. In keeping with the record's vibe, it blows apart near the end, with individual sounds dying off into the ether. It's a dark way to end, but it suggests open space rather than closed perfection. Turns out this collaboration is as much about implication as explication-- as much about what these artists could do as what they actually did.</p></div>"|15286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15286-the-flaming-lips-with-neon-indian/|7.4|Marc Masters

These are the first brash, goofily antagonistic words shouted on the Death Set's sophomore record, <i>Michel Poiccard</i>. It's a sort of perfect mantra for the Baltimore-by-way-of-Australia band, which makes an enthusiastic racket mixing ADD punk, leftover electroclash, and <i>Licensed to Ill</i>-era Beastie Boys. Sadly, the shouting voice belongs to founding member Beau Velasco, who died in 2009 of a drug overdose, only a year after the release of the band's debut, <i>Worldwide</i>. Even when not stated explicitly, most of <i>Michel Poiccard</i> feels like a love letter to Velasco from remaining founder Johnny Siera; there's a sadness and longing tucked into even songs that aren't ostensibly about Velasco.</p>
<p>The most prudent elegy for Velasco would be continuing to smash shit up. And on tracks where they do-- the sweat-drenched ""Chew It Like a Gun Gum"" and ""A Problem Is a Problem It Don't Matter Where You From""-- his spirit feels appropriately channeled. Credit producer and Baltimore club fixture XXXChange for giving these tracks bulkier production as well as livelier drums (a marked improvement over <i>Worldwide</i>'s dinky beat programming).</p>
<p>But elsewhere the Death Set ignore their wilder instincts in favor of a more emotionally hefty, ruminative feel, which makes sense considering the circumstances. ""I Miss You Beau Velasco"" is an ethereal goth-pop track that's as dour and weirdly uplifting as an early Smashing Pumpkins tune, while ""Can You See Straight?"" retains a hard-charging velocity and still taps into something unexpectedly somber.</p>
<p>It's a shame Siera couldn't rein in the focus a little more, as the material in between these exciting (and sometimes touching) songs requires considerable patience. The in-jokes and throw-away interludes you can easily brush off; the life-affirming schmaltz (""It's Another Day""), dunderheaded pop punk (""Michel Pioccard Prefers the Old (She Yearns For the Devil)""), and phoned-in guest spots from Diplo and Spank Rock, however, are harder to ignore. For a band as unhinged and forcefully wacky as the Death Set, powering on in the face of tragedy can't be easy. When they do, the results can be great fun or surprisingly thoughtful. But do some quick math-- 17 tracks in 35 minutes with only a few keepers-- and <i>Michel Poiccard</i> comes up too short.</p></div>"|15268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15268-michel-poiccard/|6.1|Zach Kelly

Matching the spastic rush of math rock with the heft of 1970s arena-fillers and a bit of Tennessee-born Southern boogie, the Bangs' shapeshifting whiplash-prog certainly gets the blood going. And this surging LP is their most spirited, sense-assaulting work to date.</p>
<p>Every sound on <i>Flux Outside</i>-- and there are many, coming in from  all angles-- gleams, buffed to an electroid sheen. Frontman Ryan  Schafer, who produced the Bangs' previous LPs, turns over the production duties to ex-Sparklehorse member Scott Minor,  with indie superproducer Dave Fridmann handling the mixing. Minor and  Fridmann help deepen the band's drums and tease out some alluringly glitzy new  textures without altering the dynamic scramble that powered 2009's fine <i>Let It Beep</i>.  For all the instrumental bombardment, the Bangs manage to maintain  order, never veering too far off course even when they're taking sharp  curves at 100 MPH. The record's got a constant forward motion, and its  50 minutes seem to zip by in double-time.</p>
<p>The Bangs' greatest strength isn't so much the almost mechanistic  turn-on-a-dime cohesion of their future rock, but how they manage to  wrangle their pristine assault into appealing shapes. Highlight ""Silver Steps"" zig-zags its way into a rousing straightahead  chorus, and while ""Bull Elk"" comes on like a tornado, Schafer shouts out  its hook from the eye of the storm. For all its alien  textures, <i>Flux Outside</i> is a generous, sweaty, markedly human  record, powered as much by groovy southern-rock melodies as the steely  synth shrapnel that seems to jut out from everywhere. It's a rare thing  indeed to hear a musical unit nail that midpoint between those  frequently oppositional tendencies time and again. Still, there are  times when the fast-moving currents in the Royal Bangs sound cause them  to barrel through their hooks, lessening their impact and causing the  distinctions between one ripcord track to the next to blur a bit. But  the Bangs seem to place every drum stutter, keyboard whirr, and Schafer  howl on equal footing, a nice testament to the tightness and democracy  of their musical unit, so pushing the songwriting further to the  forefront could come at the risk of toppling the delicate balance the  not-so-delicate <i>Flux Outside</i> achieves. May they never learn to sit still.</p></div>"|15290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15290-flux-outside/|6.9|Paul Thompson

That was the question at hand for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14223-where-did-the-night-fall""><i>Where Did the Night Fall</i></a>, last year's fourth LP from Lavelle's still-going, mostly forgotten <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4423-unkle"">UNKLE</a> project. The record, which saw Lavelle swapping beats for psych-rock textures and a correspondingly fitting list of guests (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4775-the-black-angels"">the Black Angels</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/226-autolux"">Autolux</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27842-sleepy-sun"">Sleepy Sun</a>), had its share of mostly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11821-natural-selection-ft-the-black-angels"">highlights</a>. Not that anyone heard them; after all, this is a project that hit the ground limping with 1998's debut, <i>Psyence Fiction</i>-- a record remembered mostly for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cud_k9f6tqk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">violent Jonathan Glazer-directed video</a> for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke"">Thom Yorke</a>-guesting cut ""Rabbit in Your Headlights"". The resulting decade and change hasn't been especially kind to UNKLE, so the relative vitality of <i>Where Did the Night Fall</i> was a nice treat and a surprising turn in Lavelle's inexplicably lasting career.</p>
<p>Of course, <i>Where Did the Night Fall is</i> an UNKLE album, so it ultimately falls prone to bloat and murky atmospherics. Ideally, rounding up the LP's highlights would have made for a very good EP-- a ""shorter is better"" argument that's given weight on UNKLE's latest release, <i>Only the Lonely</i>. It could be assumed that this particular EP rounds up leftovers from the last album (both <i>do</i> share the same metallic-looking, female-fetishizing type of
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
cover art), but it's easier to think of it as a companion piece. Partially because the EP and LP are seeing release as part of a special edition set; also, you don't dare get <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave"">Nick Cave</a> to sing on a track and call it a ""leftover."" Cave opens the EP with the spectacularly sleazy ""Money and Run"", which finds him howling Big Beat truisms over bashed-out drums and scum-filtered guitar. Cave is the biggest name on this bill, and he's certainly treated as such by being given the best song, but the other guests are given suitable backing material as well: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1254-the-duke-spirit"">the Duke Spirit</a>'s Liela Moss shakes off the JAMC-worshipping demons of her main act and gets gothy on ""The Dog Is Black"", while vocalist Gavin Clark gives ""Wash the Love Away"" a lost-in-a-K-hole anthemic feel.</p>
<p>So <i>Only the Lonely</i>, like its companion, is a success of sorts; that said, Lavelle is still the one running the show, and his history of unwitting self-sabotage (see: Mike D's embarrassing verse on <i>Psyence Fiction</i>'s ""The Knock (Drums of Death Pt. 2)"") continues here. The main issue is that the production applied to these tracks sounds absolutely torpid-- like a suffocating, slimy fog that dilutes the songs' more visceral elements or, in the case of ""The Dog Is Black"", makes the music sound muddled, dated. What could be a collection of bombastic, electro-tinged psych songs still somehow feels stranded in the 1990s-- and, yet, for the first time in, well, forever, the future is looking brighter for UNKLE. Keep your fingers crossed that Lavelle doesn't blow it-- but if he does, at least try to act surprised.</p></div>"|15275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15275-only-the-lonely-ep/|6.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Amid all the praise for the spiraling guitars and heady lyrical mythologies, the band quietly dissolved, as if it had already said everything it needed to say. Frontman Josh T. Pearson disappeared for several years, then emerged in Germany playing intimate, barely scripted shows that blended American Primitive guitar playing (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"" target=""_parent"">John Fahey</a>) with quasi-Biblical lyrics (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19544-wovenhand/"" target=""_blank"">Wovenhand</a>). His music had grown quieter and more ruminative, eventually winning such fans as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Three</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">Natasha Khan</a>, who corralled him to play and sing on Bat for Lashes' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9855-fur-gold/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fur and Gold</i></a>.</p>
<p>Like a slasher villain knocking off teens on the anniversary of his death, Pearson is releasing his solo debut almost 10 years after Lift to Experience's sole album release. Somewhat self-aggrandizingly titled <i>Last of the Country Gentlemen</i>, it was recorded in just two nights in Berlin, with Pearson doing live takes to the capture the wooly extemporaneity of his live shows. In fact, the album's most intriguing quality may be the strong impression that tracks like ""Country Dumb"" and ""Sorry With a Song"" are never the same from one performance to the next. These recordings capture fleeting moments in the lives of the songs, no more definitive than any other versions, and that gives the album a weird, stars-barely-aligned precariousness.</p>
<p>That unrehearsed quality relies more on Pearson's guitar playing than on his singing or songwriting. A dexterous picker, he accompanies himself loosely, unleashing a flurry of notes on opener ""Thou Art Loosed"" or roughly alluding to a melody on ""Woman, When I've Raised Hell"". There's an intriguing friction between his playing and his singing, as the tempos and dynamics change abruptly to generate an undercurrent of uneasiness. On the other hand, Pearson sounds like he's just making it all up as he goes along-- as if he has no other mission beyond the present moment. So he rambles and drones, drawing songs out beyond the 10-minute mark for no discernible reason and indulging humorless lyrical conceits. With its antiquated postcard title and hangdog self-seriousness, ""Honeymoon's Great! Wish You Were Her"" staggers around for 13 minutes, while ""Sweetheart I Ain't Your Christ"" collapses under the weight of its stilted language: ""I ain't your savior or your Christ or your goddamn sacrifice,"" he sings. ""And when I said I'd give my life, I weren't talking suicide."" Pearson keeps going and going, treating your attention like a given instead a gift.</p>
<p>And that's the crucial flaw on this high-minded album. With that peekaboo album cover, Old West font, marathon song lengths, studiously old-time lyrics, gravely whispered expletives, and oppressive gravity, Pearson projects a threadbare sense of the ""old weird America"" too strongly, too persuasively. Lift to Experience at least had the loud guitars and thundering rhythm section to prop up its top-heavy concepts, but armed with only an acoustic guitar and occasional strings, Pearson places his pretensions right in the foreground. He's performing a persona rather than embodying it naturally, but no matter how many ""goddamn""s he drawls or how many ""thou""s and ""ain't""s he drops, there's nothing truly transgressive or illuminating or innovative about <i>Last of the Country Gentlemen.</i> At heart, it's just a dawdling folk record that's far too enamored with its own put-ons and far too disregarding of its listener.</p></div>"|15222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15222-last-of-the-country-gentlemen/|4.0|Stephen M.

New Order, the Cure, Depeche Mode, and Siouxsie and the Banshees made broadly appealing pop music but also made sense to outcast kids in the U.S. because they clearly came from somewhere else. Drop any of them into your average American town and they would be mocked; the straight world would make fun of their haircuts and clothing and make-up. That was part of what drew people to them. They were theatrical and sensitive. They were singing about feelings. They were androgynous. Those drawn to this music at the time articulated a cluster of associations and feelings around these qualities that endures two decades later.</p>
<p>Cold Cave's 2009 full-length debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13383-love-comes-close/"" target=""_blank""><i>Love Comes Close</i></a>, tapped into the emotional space of 80s new wave. It wasn't just that the group sounded like bands from that decade, though that was certainly part of it. But like Peter Murphy, Ian Curtis, or Robert Smith, Cold Cave leader Wesley Eisold has a voice that's both strong and vulnerable, a low croon with a deeply embedded ache. And when used with basslines and spiky guitars that sound lifted from some lost band on Factory, his voice perfectly conveyed the drama of being a teenage outsider.</p>
<p>That feeling continues on <i>Cherish the Light Years</i>, but here everything has been blown up to a degree that borders on absurdity. From opening cut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12093-the-great-pan-is-dead/"" target=""_blank"">""The Great Pan Is Dead""</a>, <i>Cherish</i> feels like a John Hughes film projected in an IMAX theater-- guitars wail, synths scream, and the whole thing is loud, loud, loud. And Eisold responds in kind, his voice rippling with a new desperation-- he'll come running as stars explode, hearts break, and we all yearn for salvation. It's a bracing and brilliant album opener, stating in no uncertain terms, ""This is now a different band."" Just a few short years ago, Cold Cave were a home-recording project beholden to the sound of early industrial and minimal synth. The throbbing murk in that music made you think something was wrong with your stereo-- many tracks barely qualified as noise, forget about songs. But on <i>Cherish</i>, Cold Cave sound like they're storming the gates of the mainstream, ready to appeal to anyone with an ear for big, bold, goth-pop.</p>
<p>And they succeed. All nine tracks are well crafted and memorable, with sections that poke out on first listen and worm their way into your consciousness with further plays. ""Underworld USA"" begins with a dark synth thump and a lonely guitar but quickly explodes into a raging anthem for the disaffected. Eisold wants to dream and cry and let the night pass him by-- he sings of the meek inheriting the earth and rhymes ""missionary"" with ""cemetery."" And then ""Confetti"" is subtler, opening with a delicate synth line and a gorgeous reverb-laden guitar that sounds lifted from a 4AD record circa 1986. ""I feel so good on the outside,"" Eisold sings-- when you're feeling miserable, you'll take what you can get. These songs are tuneful and empathetic studded with sharp observations; it's the kind of music that makes you wish your life would fall apart a little bit, just so that you could wallow in it.</p>
<p>But the songs never stay in one place. The contrast between ""Alchemy Around You"", which adds a trumpet and thickens the production further, and the following ""Burning Sage"", a bleak and bass-heavy tune with synth from noise-master and CC member Dominick Fernow that hearkens back to the band's industrial origins, brings to mind the eclectic experimentation of <i>Kiss Me</i>-era Cure. These guys are ready to fold anything into their aesthetic. It all gets a little claustrophobic at points, and when that happens the vocals of Caralee McElroy, who contributed to <i>Love Comes Close</i>, are missed. But if <i>Cherish </i>finds Cold Cave going for it and trying their hand at new wave pop anthems, they're still sweating the details. These songs and arrangements are like catnip for those who crave the bleak romantic end of new wave.</p>
<p>There is one issue that keeps <i>Cherish</i> from being an unqualified home run: The mix and mastering job are brickwalled to the extreme, squashing all the production detail and rendering this 40-minute LP tiring to listen to as a whole. It was a strange choice to make this record so incredibly loud and compressed; this music wants to bring you closer, but the monolithic sonics have a way of keeping you at arm's length. Not to mention that this kind of ultra-loud mastering brings to mind albums that touch on some of the same sounds and feelings but in a heavy-handed way-- Bloc Party's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12130-intimacy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Intimacy</i></a> or the Killers' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12505-day-age/"" target=""_blank""><i>Day &amp; Age</i></a>, say. Considering how much care went into the songwriting and overall conception, we have to assume that Cold Cave have their reasons for wanting the album to sound like this. But to my ears, this music deserved better. Even so, taken as a whole, <i>Cherish</i> has the feel of a breakthrough, and Wes Eisold comes across as an artist with a vision that will resonate with a larger audience.</p></div>"|15284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15284-cherish-the-light-years/|7.7|Mark Richardson

""I don't really have a place where I can say I was born and raised,"" he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41738-rising-dirty-beaches/"" target=""_blank"">told us</a> last month. ""For me, home is a collage of all these fractured landscapes that I try to piece together."" This sense of displacement, combined with an ear for cinematic sounds-- particularly the eerie, stylized noir of David Lynch, Jim Jarmusch, Quentin Tarantino, and Wong Kar Wai-- fuels his work, which squeezes the sounds of early rock'n'roll and 1950s music through a lo-fi, distortion-drenched filter.</p>
<p>This set of influences, which extends to the minimal thrust of Suicide and the Cramps' manic rockabilly, feels unique, simply because it's been largely untouched by indie music during the past decade or so. Sure, there's been some casual dalliance between garage-pop and doo-wop, but we haven't really seen a lo-fi artist reach past the 60s to fully drape himself in such a dusty, road-weary atmosphere. Of course, mining a cool set of inspirations doesn't itself make for a good record. What Hungtai excels at, in addition to building evocative mood and atmosphere, is a sort of conceptual, film-like storytelling shot through the lens of these bygone eras of music.</p>
<p>Talking about <i>Badlands</i> in <a href=""http://vimeo.com/21160535"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this clip</a>, Hungtai said the album's songs explore ""repeating themes, reoccurring characters being in exile or just away from home."" So on each of the these tracks, which alternate between rumbling motorcycle punk and more plaintive ballads, you get this sense of man-on-the-road drama, a drifter going from town to town, dive bar to dive bar. The songs work in part because Hungtai has great command of his voice, moving easily from a hushed sing-speak to a throatier purr. A good example is the throbbing <i>Lolita</i> anthem <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12078-sweet-17/"" target=""_blank"">""Sweet 17""</a>, where he shrieks and coos over a blown-out drumbeat and scraping reverb, making the track feel equally threatening and sexy.</p>
<p>Because the record relies quite a bit on aesthetic, it could start to feel same-y without tonal shifts, which is why Hungtai is wise to include the slower numbers. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12142-true-blue/"" target=""_blank"">""True Blue""</a> and ""Lord Knows Best"", a pair toward the end of the album, offer a druggy, somber counterpoint to the punchier stuff earlier on. Something like Everly Brothers-style solemn crooning recorded in a closet, both have this great death-prom vibe-- romantic and even pretty but with a healthy dose of evil. Two instrumental pieces that close out the record don't hold up quite as well, but ultimately what you get here is a refreshing take on the well-worn tropes of lo-fi-- raunchy, old-fashioned, and pompadoured, there's nothing else that sounds like this right now.</p></div>"|15281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15281-badlands/|8.2|Joe Colly

Belle and Sebastian went 1970s AM gold, Los Campesinos! developed a gothically morbid streak. Throughout Architecture in Helsinki's career, they've tried to grow into an adult voice, with some pubescent cracks and hiccups along the way. Their first two albums had the feel of clever kids run riot in the band room after school, fooling around on French horn and whatever else was around. Their third saw them streamlining things, dropping a couple of members and replacing much of the studiously charted acoustic ruckus with synthetic instrumentation. <i>Moment Bends</i> finds them even further along that path, moving from the gleefully transparent clutter of their early albums to a more highly polished pop sound.</p>
<p><i>Moment Bends</i> is also oddly indebted to the sonic palette of the lite-FM 80s. Synths are dialed into glassy pads, ersatz pan flutes, and gentle fluttering arpeggios. Several songs feel like echoes of specific new wave/age hits, even, although everything is absorbed thoroughly enough as to not be intentional ""spot-the-reference"" nods so much as a fully digested overall sound.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it works. ""Escapee"" is an energetic cut, with swinging synths standing in for ska horns. ""Yr Go To"" bops along with a supremely catchy, sing-song cadence. ""Everything's Blue"" begins as a bass-and-drums disco strut with layered vocals (falsetto, female, and bass) and vamping guitar, then flowers into a chorus with twinkling synths and a briefly materializing gospel choir. ""Sleeptalkin'"" similarly alternates between easy, free-falling guitar strum and glossy chorus.</p>
<p>Other times, it's hard to tell if the band takes it too far. ""W.O.W"", which here stands not for online orc conquests but for ""walking on water,"" has Sutherland yearning for a metaphysical love to be made corporeal over softly lapping synths that might be a little too close to Enya waters for some fans.</p>
<p>Then there's the story told by frontman Cameron Bird's literal voice, which expanded from whimpering and whispering on the band's first two albums to include a playful, at times libidinous, almost fully grown growl on <i>Places Like This</i>. There's little of that roar on this album, but an even more notable retreat is Bird's increasing reliance on heavily filtered and processed vocal effects.</p>
<p>This is most pronounced on lead single ""Contact High"". Bird's breathy falsetto verses sound normal enough, but they turn into that odd, otherly voice of the Auto-Tuned on the chorus, singing, ""I've got nothing to hide,"" with what might be the slightest smirk, sometimes tripled by an octave-lowered bass voice, sounding in the main like nothing so much as Owl City. And yet, it's a terrific pop song, and the chorus, for all its strange sheen, is an undeniable pleasure.</p>
<p>It's a shame the rest of <i>Moment Bends</i> isn't consistently so successful. Much of it just sounds listless compared to the excitement of the band's previous albums, and the last third of the album begins to seriously drag. <i>Places Like This</i> proved that Architecture in Helsinki could grow out of their early sound without growing tame, that they could change their voice but keep their charm; <i>Moment Bends</i> too often finds them losing one, the other, or both.</p></div>"|15271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15271-moment-bends/|6.5|Eric Grandy

That's because both of Mike Watt's overarching ideas lend themselves to short, pithy songs rather than bloated suites or pompous narratives. Watt's guides are the small, detailed characters in the work of 15th century painter <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hieronymus Bosch</a>, and the minimal punk of his own pioneering band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">the Minutemen</a>. Basing each of the album's 30 songs on a Bosch character (and giving them names like ""Jug-Footed-Man"" and ""Confused-Parts-Man""), Watt wrote everything in Minutemen <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen_(band)#Economical_practices"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""econo""</a> mode, using late bandmate <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Boon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">D. Boon's</a> guitar. The goal, he <a href=""http://www.hootpage.com/hoot_wattbio.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a>, was to make ""one big work out of a bunch of little ones.""</p>
<p>Judged on that scale, <i>Hyphenated-Man </i>is a full-on success. The way Watt and his band the Missingmen blast through each taut musical nugget evokes early Minutemen albums such as <i>The Punch Line </i>and <i>What Makes a Man Start Fires? </i>As on those classics, each track fires by so quickly, you might not absorb one before you can catch up to the next. Nearly every song uses sharp turns, gruff energy, and snapping beats, making them all echo each other like rhyming lines in a poem. And like Bosch's characters, Watt's 30 ""men"" feel like brothers, united by an artistic cause.</p>
<p>What gives those brothers personality-- and keeps <i>Hyphenated-Man </i>from being just a Minutemen nostalgia trip-- is the way Watt injects himself into every moment. His hard-working, art-punk-in-a-flannel-shirt persona courses through each syllable of his Dada-ish lyrics, and his voice stretches to match the music's spilling energy. ""Panderin' to work the shill/ Procurin' ink for the quill,"" he wryly sings about ""Bird-in-the-Helmet-Man"". Later he grunts through a dizzying portrait of the hard-luck ""Belly-Stabbed-Man"": ""A belly with ears stuck to some legs/ No arms or chest-- not even a head/ Stabbed with truth, fuckin' gets bled!""</p>
<p>Much of <i>Hyphenated-Man </i>has that kind of blunt, unblinking tone. It sounds like Watt is using Bosch's figures to confront some hard truths, but he does so in a spry, often joyous way. That's especially impressive given how sentimental this album<i> </i>could've been. After Boon's passing in 1985, Watt didn't listen to the Minutemen much until the <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Jam_Econo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We Jam Econo</a> </i>documentary was made in 2005. But rather than getting him down, revisiting his past has given Watt an electric charge. While his solo work has often been inspired, on <i>Hyphenated-Man</i> he sounds thoroughly possessed. At age 53, after three-plus decades building a singular DIY career, Mike Watt might have just made his best post-Minutemen work.</p></div>"|15273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15273-hyphenated-man/|7.9|Marc Masters

They sang about being proud white trash, getting drunk in the early afternoon, trying to avoid DUIs, and coming home at night soused and hungry enough to eat an entire chicken. They convinced you they were bad, wild girls, but they also lovingly covered the Carter Family and wrote a sad, beautiful song threatening any man who'd be mean to their mamas. Some of it was lightweight fare, and often hokey, but Those Darlins' debut was also a hell of a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It's understandable that the Darlins would want to expand beyond this classic country sensibility, and maybe scale back the yuks a bit too. Their debut was a musically slapdash affair, so it also makes sense that they'd want to grow their sound into something more resonant and nuanced. There's no reason to believe Those Darlins aren't capable of accomplishing this, but unfortunately their sophomore effort, <i>Screws Get Loose</i>, is a quintessential growing-pains document.</p>
<p><i>Screws Get Loose</i> actually picks up right where the debut left off; the opening title cut is bratty and clever, and the succeeding first single is even better: ""Be Your Bro"" is a fun but unmistakably pointed tune about the headache of wanting to be friends with a boy without things getting sexual. For the third song, ""Let U Down"", drummer Linwood Regensburg takes his first lead vocal, and while he's hardly the sole culprit for what follows, his showcase augurs a bad turn for the album.</p>
<p>From here on out, <i>Screws Get Loose</i> starts sounding like the work of a retro-pop outfit, treading the same ground covered by the Raveonettes, the Donnas, and recent revivalist indie heroes Dum Dum Girls and Vivian Girls. Yet where, say, Dum Dum Girls' gauzy sound cultivates mystery, memory, and obscure longing, Those Darlins get bogged down by their increased attention to musical texture on ""Mystic Mind"", ""Tina Said"", and ""Bumd"". It doesn't help that these songs lack any compelling lyrics either. On the positive side of the ledger, ""Boy"" captures a wonderfully light, pure pop feel, while ""$"" and ""Fatty Needs a Fix"" recreate some of the wit of the debut, albeit with less enjoyable hooks. I won't say Those Darlins necessarily ought to return to their roots; they might be entirely capable of doing something great with  whatever direction they choose to take. Still, that doesn't change the  fact that twangy wisecracks suit them damn well.</p></div>"|15267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15267-screws-get-loose/|6.1|Joshua Love

Yet the band has been forthcoming in their love of crossover alternative rock, and on their second LP, <i>Belong</i>, Pains link up with Flood and Alan Moulder, the superproducers who manned the boards for a number of 90s titans-- Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails, U2, Depeche Mode, and PJ Harvey just to name a few. Coming after a scrappy, low-profile debut, this is the sort of power move that used to have cred-conscious listeners crying ""sell-out!"" (remember that word?), but fortunately, <i>Belong </i>is a bigger, bolder, and brighter follow-up that adds new dimensions to the Pains' sound while nearly equaling the songwriting of their debut.</p>
<p>The first three tracks on <i>Belong--</i> the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12106-belong/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, ""Heaven's Gonna Happen Now"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12041-heart-in-your-heartbreak/"" target=""_blank"">""Heart in Your Heartbreak""</a>--<i> </i>make up the strongest run the Pains have put together. That's in large part because, while they feature the seamless verse-chorus-bridge transitions the debut had in spades, they sound like actual 90s alt-rock radio hits. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12644-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">The Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> </i>wasn't as lo-fi as it was often made out to be, but it didn't allow for the thrilling deluges of fuzz or the punchy clarity on this opening trio of tracks. Later, Pains nudge themselves slightly out of their comfort zone, replicating the motorbike roar of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">JAMC</a> on ""Girl of 1,000 Dreams"" or the bliss of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a> on ""Strange"".</p>
<p>Even with their shiny makeover, the most noticeable alteration is that Kip Berman is no longer just a lead singer-- he's a frontman as well. While maintaining his soft, lisping lilt, he's now much higher in the mix, giving the singalong hooks of ""Heart in Your Heartbreak"" and ""Too Tough"" an underlined emphasis. His lyrics are also more inclusive; he's dropping the puns and arch prose of its predecessor for magnanimous songs about <i>you</i>, <i>we</i>, and <i>us</i>. But this newfound stress on speaking directly to the listener doesn't come without its awkward growth spurts: It's worth questioning whether striving for the perfect chorus at times comes at the cost of fully thought-out verses. The group's momentum also gets occasionally jarred by a stray lyric that can be overreaching or undercooked.</p>
<p>And yet, even the dodgiest lyrics on <i>Belong </i>don't really come off as pandering to me so much as a reminder of the margin for error inherent in a move this brave and necessary. Having dabbled in brighter production and a Saint Etienne remix on their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13486-higher-than-the-stars-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Higher Than the Stars </i>EP</a>, it was evident that the Pains were trying to figure an exit strategy from a narrow, reverent sound they utterly nailed the first time around. And considering the game plans of recent New York bands that faced the same struggle-- either buy time by repeating themselves (like the Strokes or Interpol) or screw the pooch with a charmless, big-budget disaster (like the Strokes or Interpol)-- it's no small achievement that <i>Belong </i>transcends its time-coded sound as expertly as their self-titled did.</p></div>"|15270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15270-belong/|8.2|Ian Cohen

His first three albums combined tape-distressed versions of British folk with warbly ambient interludes, and he gradually added vocals that hinted at proper songs. During this stretch, he seemed like someone who wanted to completely master one idiom before he could muster the courage to move on to another. But on his 2009 album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13125-ambivalence-avenue/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ambivalence Avenue"">Ambivalence Avenue</a>,</i> Wilkinson moved outside of his comfort zone. His ear for mood and texture was still there, but suddenly his vocals were up front and he was tossing in hip-hop breaks and dense samples to craft a weirdly bent style of electro-pop. It was an exhilarating record. You could feel an artist stepping outside of himself and venturing boldly into new territory, and the sense of adventure was contagious.</p>
<p><i>Mind Bokeh</i> is no less daring than <i>Ambivalence Avenue</i>, and it covers just as much ground, but here you can feel Wilkinson bumping up against his limitations. His talent for production is fully intact, but some odd choices sabotage the record. Instrumental sections like the title cut and the closing ""St. Christopher"" show a sound technician firmly in command of his material, folding twinkly keyboards, crackly loops, and gently insistent beats into tracks that are evocative and detailed enough to reveal more with repeated listens. Wilkinson's terrific understanding of sound is undiminished, and he still moves easily between genres and gets most of the key details right. But the further he explores recognizable song forms, the more often the album stumbles.</p>
<p>In the case of ""Take Off Your Shirt"", that stumble becomes a full-on face plant. Wilkinson's exploratory spirit is a wonderful thing, but glammy power pop in the vein of Phoenix is something he should absolutely, positively leave to someone else. With its blocky guitar riff and canned beat, ""Shirt"" is stiff and downright unlikable. Fortunately, it doesn't get any worse, but there are still too many ho-hum moments that feel weirdly off. The six-minute ""Pretentious"" brings the flow of the album to a halt only two tracks in, with a woozy synth-driven lope that's a bit too close to anonymous chillwave and is not redeemed by the tacked-on vocals. Along the same lines but better is ""Light Seep"". Here, the repurposed AM radio pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> would seem to be an influence, as Wilkinson mixes a funky wah-wah guitar with percussion that sounds like a Wurlitzer preset. To my ears, it sounds like a so-so take on something Keyboard Money Mark was doing in the late 90s, but ""Seep"" is at least listenable and a good example of Wilkinson's eclecticism working for him.</p>
<p>On the plus side, ""Wake Up!"" is very much a continuation of the best of <i>Ambivalence Avenue</i>, with its surging <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Dilla</a>-fied samples grafted to a vocal performance that finds Wilkinson filled with yearning, sounding almost desperate. And ""K Is for Kelson"" is a convincing slice of bouncy indie pop that sounds like it's being sung by a robot on holiday in the tropics. These songs are short and sweet, making their point and getting out, which works to their advantage. But on the lengthier tracks, <i>Mind Bokeh</i> seems to hover in an unsteady place between pop song form and soundscapes, and the flaws-- repetitive melodies that don't quite gel, the voice just a bit too high in the mix-- become more evident. There is enjoyable music here, and I've no doubt that the Bibio project has plenty of life on it. But now that Wilkinson has spent a few years trying new things, a little focus might do him some good.</p></div>"|15279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15279-mind-bokeh/|6.9|Mark Richardson

In truth, the group's lead singer and mastermind, Mica Levi, studied violin from a young age (her mother is a cellist) and received a classical indoctrination at music school. As you spend more time with <i>Jewellery</i>, you begin to realize that even its roughest-hewn, seemingly random elements carry such a concentrated punch that they could only be the product of an artist who was extremely focused and in control of her materials.</p>
<p>Given her history, it makes perfect sense that Levi would gravitate toward a project like <i>Chopped &amp; Screwed</i>, a one-off collaboration (performed in May 2010 at Kings Place in London) between the Shapes and the London Sinfonietta, an orchestral ensemble made up of strings and woodwinds. It also makes sense, knowing the breadth of Levi's sonic interests and her hunger for experimentation, that sooner or later she'd bite off a bit more than she could readily chew. And so it is with <i>Chopped &amp; Screwed</i>, which is conceptually fascinating and occasionally hits on something really compelling and fresh, but is also only sporadically engaging. Of course, even when things feel aimless, it's still intriguing to hear Levi and the other musicans working through their ideas.</p>
<p>As its title suggets, <i>Chopped &amp; Screwed</i> draws inspiration from the Houston-born hip-hop practice of manipulating beats and slowing down tempos to mimic (and cultivate) a drugged, disoriented sensation in the listener. Don't expect to hear molasses-thick male voices drawling about candy paint over slow beat claps here, however. The Shapes' and Sinfonietta's kinship with the likes of DJ Screw is all about aiming for that same feel of dislocation. The way they go about attempting to achieve it is certainly creative-- basically, the ensemble saws or trills away on their instruments while the Shapes pluck and hammer at homemade stringed or percussive contraptions (the rotating doohickey Levi <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KKaU6Fl_k#t=03m44s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plays</a> is particularly nifty), alternating between frantic and syrupy-slow tempos seemingly at a whim. Above the maelstrom, Levi slowly and lowly intones lyrics that are frequently incomprehensible.</p>
<p>More important are her melodies, which make ""Everything"" and ""Low Dogg"" the album's standouts, as Levi's arty appetites contend with the razor-sharp pop sense she displayed throughout <i>Jewellery</i> and that I hope she always retains. The likes of ""Unlucky"", ""Fall"", and ""Not So Sure"" aren't as immediately riveting but do the best job of replicating screw's woozy allure. That said, there's an awful lot of connective tissue here-- fairly lengthy passages (especially for such a short album) bridging the more immediate moments. If the performance had been longer, such sequences would be acceptable interludes. As it is, it feels like dead patches make up almost half of <i>Chopped &amp; Screwed</i>. Shelve it next to the Knife's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13974-tomorrow-in-a-year/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tomorrow, in a Year</i></a> as an effort that hearteningly shows an inspired artist staking out bold terrain, but one that only fitfully delivers the impact of the artist's previous, pop-focused work.</p></div>"|15274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15274-chopped-screwed/|6.3|Joshua Love

A group with a couple of great songs and a few unremarkable ones might've gotten more of a pass for hiding the mediocrities on B-sides back when ""sides"" were the only game in town, but the nature of an album still has a certain weight to the idea of consistent front-to-back listening that doesn't forgive hitches so easily. Still, even though Holy Ghost! have followed up a string of singles and an EP (2010's <i>Static on the Wire</i>) with an album where the big stumbling blocks are redundancy and an overextension of a few good ideas, it's surprisingly easy to toss those concerns aside and just go for the choice stuff piecemeal-style.</p>
<p>Holy Ghost! <i>do</i> have a good amount of choice stuff, actually, at least if you've warmed to the idea of a band that does for 1980s electro-pop and some of the era's more forward-thinking AOR what the Juan MacLean did for deep house. But it depends on how much you take in at once. That's another paradox of a singles band-- put a bit of chronological distance between a few soundalike tracks, and the water-treading doesn't seem so bad. On an album, it's easy to notice that, say, the lyrical conceit of ""Hold On""'s hook is recycled for the bridge on ""Say My Name"" (""Hold on, hold on, hold on/ Even though you know you shouldn't""). But with a few years separating those tracks' original releases, the original impressions hinged more on a stylistic progression from the former's chirpy yet suave electro-pop to the latter's frosty, anxious, and immaculately mannered minimal new wave. That's why it's a bit harder to parse the tracks that make their debut on the album.</p>
<p>A few of these stand out immediately. There's ""Jam for Jerry"", a subtly guilt-stricken yet touching tribute to drummer Jerry Fuchs, and ""Some Children"", which not only drops a youth chorus on your head but throws in an honest-to-god Michael McDonald appearance on the chorus to boot. Both sound like textbook Factory-replica synthpop with faint underpinnings of Fourth and Broadway-eclectic dance music and R&amp;B. Think Chromeo with a straighter face. But these songs have enough staying power in their catchiness to feel distinct so long as you keep them isolated from each other. And the songs on <i>Holy Ghost!</i> you might've heard already still hold up, whether after 3 1/2 years (the aforementioned ""Hold On"") or just under one, like the yearning electro-funk of <i>Static on the Wire</i>'s title track, reintroduced here.</p>
<p>Other tracks aren't so lucky when strung in succession, and the familiar, unchallenging pleasures of each individual song-- the semi-industrial churn of ""Do It Again"", the piano-flecked Jellybean Benitez pop-lock of ""Wait and See"", the aloof disco of ""Slow Motion""-- are quickly canceled out by the next, losing detail and impact in the cumulative procession. That'll come with time, and there's plenty of momentum to grasp hold of when the music's actually playing. But the ""I need to hear this again right away"" jolt might not grab on for good.</p>
<p>While Holy Ghost! don't have the compositional knack of Hot Chip or Cut Copy, Alex Frankel's cool, reserved, yet subtly emotional vocals and the duo's solid knack for no-bullshit dance grooves are served well by a consistent mood of tense detachment-- the sort of mildly intriguing disconnect that comes with the combination of upbeat synthpop and downbeat lyrical ennui. It's not always the most distinct lyrical ennui, granted, with words that don't get any less vague than the titles and sentiments that often need to be heard between the lines. Just meet it all halfway, and it'll be fine. As slippery and elusive as this album's thrills can be, they'll eventually fall into place, one track at a time.</p></div>"|15227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15227-holy-ghost/|7.1|Nate Patrin

On their 2009 debut, <i>How to Make Ambient Sadcake</i>, principal songwriters Heidi Alexander and Grace Cooper embraced boyfriends covered in blood and commanded cheating lovers to keep their mistresses out of sight. They played songs titled ""Marry Me"" and ""Kiss Your Feet"". They delivered these songs with major-key stroll and minor-key tempest, side-stepping the garage-rock of their San Francisco peers (which include the Fresh &amp; Onlys, a band for which Cooper and Alexander sang backup) for a sound that splits the difference between rockabilly and first-wave country &amp; western. The 1950s jaunt of <i>Ambient Sadcake</i> and the ethereal, lovelorn bent of last year's <i>Duck Duck Goose</i> EP provided a rich, promising template upon which to build.</p>
<p>Their second LP, <i>Mrs. Jones' Cookies</i>, starts out with a high-pitched call and an antiquated chord, and the lyrics on opener ""In the Garden"" find the singer holding a locket tightly against her chest. Eerie and stormy, the song conveys the sort of darkness emphasized in <i>Ambient Sadcake</i> standouts ""The Revisionists"" and ""Stranger's Shadow"". But as with their debut, the album has levity to balance things out. Using bright, sprightly chords, ""Summer of Love"" accentuates the twang in Alexander and Cooper's voices, while ""Lightfoot"" goes for an almost-dainty folk vibrato reminiscent of Anne Briggs. Early album standout ""My Heart Does Swell"" provides a little country shuffle to go with the heartsick vocals and a toy piano solo(!). And then ""Miracle Me"" splinters into the realm of unfiltered sadness, a glacial country ballad highlighted by forlorn vocals and a stately flute solo. Up until this point, the Sandwitches has only hinted that they had the skill to craft such effortlessly beautiful songs.</p>
<p>But this is not to say that they've neglected their ability to write turbulent, overcast rock, either. ""Black Rider"" shows a nuanced sense of dynamics, calmly ambling about and then building toward a proper climax with rising levels of aggression. A similar method yields even better results on ""Over the Moon"", where a descending, countrified guitar line eventually gives way to climactic, violent catharsis, all cracking voices and combatively played instruments.</p>
<p>The album's few low points come when those builds don't quite reach fruition. ""Heaviest Head in the West"" starts out as a slow-burning rockabilly tune, complete with the band's two singers caterwauling desperately while striking their guitars, which is brought down to a simmer. But an inexplicable tempo change eventually peters out with no forward moment, which is disappointing, considering how promisingly it starts out.</p>
<p>""Joe Says"" serves as the album's highlight, providing an appropriately dramatic background for Cooper and Alexander's most yearning vocals. The theme of commitment pops up repeatedly during the tune, painting the image of a young woman pacing around her empty kitchen, trying to figure out the whereabouts of her man who ""says impossibly good things.""</p>
<p>By the end of ""Joe Says"", Alexander and Cooper are singing the beautifully sad refrain, ""He's coming back to me,"" and it sounds more like the protagonist trying to convince herself. It's the kind of arresting song that would have been perfect as the closer for <i>Mrs. Jones' Cookies</i>. But even with the minor sequencing miscue, the record goes a long way in capturing the promise of a band who gets a lot of mileage out of archaic musical and lyrical themes, a band that makes the primordial seem fresh.</p></div>"|15258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15258-mrs-jones-cookies/|7.5|Martin Douglas

The music they make together, however, sounds instead like radio hits from some 1960s vision of the future: love songs from a world that will never exist. That sense of unrealizable possibilities reinforced the sense of loss on their debut, and made songs like ""The High Road"" and ""The Ghost Inside"" sound bruised and battered, but not bitter or jaded. These four new songs are outtakes and B-sides from their initial sessions, which along with that similar album cover suggests they intended <i>Meyrin Fields</i> as an epilogue to <i>Broken Bells</i>.</p>
<p>Yet, the EP has its own distinctive flavor, notably different from that of the LP. Burton's production is somehow both heavier and lighter: There's more going on in these songs, but the elements, such as the Jack Nitzsche-style guitar on ""Heartless Empire"" or the constant blips and beeps on ""Windows"", evoke spaceship mechanization and anti-gravity weightlessness. Gears grind and sirens wail on the title track, while a high, inhuman voice ghosts Mercer's vocals to reinforce the catchiness of the melody, like a gremlin in the works. If <i>Broken Bells</i> was indeed a break-up album-- and especially if it turns out to be about the break-up of the Shins-- <i>Meyrin Fields</i> continues that theme and plays it out a bit more, suggesting new stages of grief and acrimony. <i>Meyrin Fields</i> never sounds as eulogistic as <i>Broken Bells</i> did. It's less about loss than about the undiscovered country that comes after.</p>
<p>That's a lot for four songs to convey, but it comes through clearly on the EP's first half. The title track and ""Windows"" are both tense and ominous, with similar stabs of melody and a distressed urgency to the production. Burton treats the songs as short films to soundtrack, and every element goes toward reinforcing Mercer's dark drama. In fact, perhaps the main spark in this collaboration is how it gets both artists outside their comfort zones: Burton's beatmaking priorities draw Mercer out of his indie-pop realm and reveal the breadth of his songwriting, while Mercer's eloquent concision keeps Burton sharper and more focused. Both men show us something new, even as they struggle to break free of the gravitational pull of their other projects.</p>
<p>On the second half, however, that tension releases, and <i>Meyrin Fields</i> powers down with the loping reggae approximation of ""An Easy Life"" and the buoyant drift of ""Heartless Empire"". The arrangements are less insistent and sinister, but the melodies remain slightly chilly. ""An Easy Life"" was originally released as an iTunes exclusive to the album, and it sounds similarly tacked-on here. ""Heartless Empire"" does it one better, but throws everything-- grinding guitars, a whistled solo-- at a song that simply isn't very memorable. Still, this EP sounds like more than the sum of its parts. Maybe it's the realization that Gnarls Barkley will never top ""Crazy"" or that the Shins may never re-form, but there's an intriguing sense of desperation on these songs, as though both Mercer and Burton are realizing that this band could indeed be their lives.</p></div>"|15262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15262-meyrin-fields-ep/|6.7|Stephen M.

But more importantly it would be the return of the only band that really sounds like Soundgarden. While Bush, Godsmack, and Creed spawned from the most easily cloned DNA of Soundgarden's peers, few bands attempted to possess either the chops of their SST days or the dexterous, expansive pop-metal that would come later.</p>
<p>And yet, instead of reissuing any of their mammoth LPs for a much-needed rediscovery, A&amp;M chooses to strip mine the Soundgarden vaults for barely new compilations. Even more so than the poorly curated and bafflingly packaged hodgepodge of career retrospective <i>Telephantasm</i>, <i>Live on I-5</i> comes off like an experiment to figure out the minimum amount of effort required to separate a Soundgarden fan from $9.99. Rather than capturing the band at the peak of its powers, <i>I-5 </i>documents the <i>Down on the Upside </i>tour that found Soundgarden worn out by that album's grueling recording sessions, punishing substance abuse, and most importantly, each other.</p>
<p>That the title references a stretch of highway along the Pacific instead of a single venue is in itself telling: though <i>I-5 </i>ends up a pretty faithful recreation of Soundgarden's setlist at the time, it's pieced together from a handful of West Coast dates, and you can tell by how the crowd noise pipes in at random intervals and volumes like a hovering apparition. As such, there's really no ebb and flow, no tension, no sense that this needed to be Soundgarden's first live document. At the very least, Kim Thayil, Ben Shepherd, and Matt Cameron are highly skilled musicians doing efficient yeoman's work here-- there's an anachronistic pleasure in hearing Thayil's serpentine soloing wailing through the very unhip wah-wah pedal, and how they manage to pummel through the closing ""Jesus Christ Pose"" is nothing short of miraculous considering the torpor that precedes it. They give a very professional performance, nothing less, nothing more.</p>
<p>So what we're basically left with is a live album whose perverse main draw is the chance to hear a good portion of Soundgarden's most iconic tracks given the Lizard King treatment by someone whose vocal cords were clearly on the business end of way too many bottles of vodka. Let's not mince words-- Chris Cornell sounds terrible here, and he's pretty much all you can hear when he takes the mic. Granted, hearing him go all Tarzan on record provided some of Soundgarden's most visceral thrills, and oddly enough, he has no problem hitting the climactic high notes of ""Spoonman"" and ""Rusty Cage"". But nearly everything else just finds his vocals tattered and flailing in and out of tune like a flag in a torrential downpour, making you wonder just how bad things really got if these were truly the top-shelf recordings. Even the choice of covers here lack inspiration-- ""Search and Destroy"" and the even more ubiquitous ""Helter Skelter"" are given Blueshammer makeovers, no different from any number of bands doing the same thing at a sports bar near you.</p>
<p>Look, that rating up there is a reflection of the presentation, not of the underlying material: God knows any record with ""Rusty Cage"" on it deserves better. The problem is that this was, at best, a 1997 cash-grab that probably would've worked in that economic climate, and now you just get to debate whether it's a cynical move on Soundgarden's part or, more likely, something they had absolutely nothing to do with at all. If you want to get excited about their upcoming album, see them live now. Or listen to <i>Louder Than Love</i>, <i>Badmotorfinger</i>,<i> </i>or<i> Superunknown--</i> they hold up just fine.</p></div>"|15272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15272-live-on-i-5/|2.6|Ian Cohen

His latest LP as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4945-rafter/"">Rafter</a>, <i>Quiet Storm</i>, finds him once again staking out new territory. Released abruptly in late January, the digital-only release is said to draw inspiration from ""black metal demo tapes"" Rafter and his touring companions listened to while out on the road supporting last year's attempt at poly-glam Of Montreal-pastiche, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14151-animal-feelings/"" target=""_blank""><i>Animal Feelings</i></a>.</p>
<p><i>Quiet Storm</i> doesn't really sound like black metal at all, nor does it sound like, in Rafter's words, ""Darkthrone meets the Kinks meets Lee Perry."" But the record is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2756-the-microphones/"" target=""_blank"">Microphones</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2919-mount-eerie/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Eerie</a> godhead Phil Elverum's recent dalliances with the dark arts, namely, Mount Eerie's 2008 EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11545-black-wooden-ceiling-opening-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black Wooden Ceiling Opening</i></a>. Both that record and <i>Quiet Storm</i> apply a similar amp-blown aesthetic to the songs. But while Elverum's affection for lo-fi and disquieting distortion is nothing new, Rafter's music has never sounded this harsh and abrasive-- almost every drum hit on this record crackles and blasts through everything else surrounding it. The technique adds a crunchy texture to the material, foregrounding Rafter's debt to the spikier end of 1990s indie rock. Elsewhere, the new dressings add an ominous, discordant feel to the record's more dirge-like moments (see album closer ""Born Again"" and the clattering din of ""Coldness of Space"").</p>
<p>Rafter has experimented with recording fidelity in the past (see: 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11123-sex-death-cassette/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sex Death Cassette</i></a>), and<i> Quiet Storm</i> is arguably his most successful venture in this arena so far. Ironically, though, the sound of the record ultimately holds it back. There's simply too <i>much</i> noise here, and it's often  poorly placed. The more melodic material falls flat in this setting, and tedium truly sets in during the album's mid-section, where melody is set aside almost entirely in favor of twitching electronics and toppled percussion. At its best, though, the scattered, ramshackle nature of <i>Quiet Storm</i> manages to transcend these difficult passages. And for those who'd rather hear Rafter in a different sonic guise, chances are you won't have to wait long for him to change it up again.</p></div>"|15256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15256-quiet-storm/|6.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Their final record together, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11510-exitingarm/"">ExitingARM</a></i>, felt like an overt push toward accessibility, mainly due to its adherence to finely honed song structures that were executed with zipped-up brevity. Subtle called it quits in 2009 shortly after <i>ExitingARM</i> failed to reach beyond their immediate fanbase, but one of its founder members, Jordan Dalrymple, has continued to develop various threads from that record with this first album under his Antonionian guise. It's short, with a combined runtime of just over 30 minutes, and works around the same catholic mash-up of pop, rock, funk, R&amp;B, and hip-hop influences that his prior band thrived upon.</p>
<p>The slightly clumsy moniker Dalrymple has chosen to adopt is a nod to the work of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_Antonioni"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>, the Italian filmmaker who was prone to dabble in abstraction, despondency, and societal and personal dysfunction. If Dalrymple shares one aspect with his almost-namesake, it's in his partiality for the metaphysical, which is strung out across the opaque lyrics that are voiced throughout most of these recordings. This is an album that's all about feeling, of conjuring up a particular mood, where the words are an additional splash of color for the listener to decipher. Those song-based tracks are spliced up by two scene-setting pieces-- the opening ""The Desert"", which sets a baleful tone via compacted beats and great washes of treated harmonies; and ""The Desert Pt. 2"", the penultimate track that's about as close as Dalrymple gets to straight-out rock, with its fuzzy guitar and manically chanted vocal incantations.</p>
<p>The wide stylistic gap between those two songs indicates the general direction of <i>Antonionian</i>, which ultimately fragments into different junctures with every new turn it takes. The vocal tone, pushed high into a falsetto range for the most part, works as an anchor of sorts, giving the album its only common motif, although it's difficult to feel grounded in an Antonionian ""sound"" at any particular moment. A case in point: ""My Mind's I"" is a jittery pop track that matches an aching lyric from Dalrymple with furious acoustic strumming and a sea of choral voices. This is followed by ""Vanquished"", a downcast ballad full of melodramatic cries, which in turn gives way to ""The Ride"", a light mid-range number that marries the soft-focus pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a> with the quirky impulses of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1869-bruce-haack/"">Bruce Haack</a>.</p>
<p>It might sound like a messy conglomeration of styles-- and it certainly takes more than a few listens to becomes fully acquainted with the Antonionian world-- but Dalrymple is a meticulous arranger who just about knows how to slot all the pieces together. Occasionally he'll plunge too close to outright homage; ""Into the Night"" is one-part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2408-ladytron/"">Ladytron</a> synth snarl and one-part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>-circa-<i>Parade</i> airiness, while the following ""Fate's Not Particular"" is a disappointingly played-straight diversion into shrill indie rock. That taste for diversity is partly what made Subtle tick, but what's lacking here is the overriding edge that made that project work. In short, Doesone could conjure up whole worlds of possibility through a series of carefully obfuscated lyrics, but Dalrymple can't quite pull off the same trick despite adhering to similar methodology. There's a sense that he's meandering with no particular destination in mind here, which is fine if that's his only intent, but his prior work suggested he's capable of so much more.</p></div>"|15242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15242-antonionian/|6.8|Nick Neyland

It's a title that evokes images of dusty shoeboxes in the attic, overflowing with weather-beaten photos from broken 35mm cameras. As artists embrace obsolete technology as tools for creation, <i>Faded Days</i> at first glance seems to be heading down that path: a celebration of the past, a lament for when times were simpler.</p>
<p>""I've seen better days,"" sings Cameron Allen in a dejected tenor on album opener ""Oskar"", minutes before wistfully urging the grass in his lawn to grow; what starts out as a young man peeking over his shoulder at the days gone by ends with him pleading for the sands of time to hurry along. It quickly becomes clear that <i>Faded Days</i>-- written and recorded by Allen in what sounds like a bedroom setting-- is actually a collection of songs meant to put more distance between its creator and his past, a final look into the haze of yesteryear. On the very next song, Allen pledges to ""change myself, rearrange shelves,"" turning the humdrum chore of reconfiguring his living space into a significant act of revision.</p>
<p>The main theme of <i>Faded Days</i> turns out to be how the past eventually blanches and evaporates under the dark, looming shadow of the horizon. The lyrics that aren't concerned with the past are cautiously optimistic for what the future holds. Musically, Allen uses his effects-laden drone-pop to render his past even blurrier. At times, his propensity for loop-based, floating stateliness is eerily reminiscent of fellow Georgian Bradford Cox, making instrumentals like ""Collision"" and bouncy, ambient-leaning garage-rock tracks ""Nowhere (Beth)"" and the aforementioned ""Rearrange Shelves"" sound like skeletal Atlas Sound demos.</p>
<p>At times the similarities between the two projects veer toward suspicion, like the vocal melodies on ""Children"" or the chord changes on ""Oskar"". Many of the tracks bear interesting production flourishes that provide depth to the minimalism of the songs (<i>Faded Days</i> is thoroughly a ""headphones album""), showing that Allen has an incredibly adroit ear for production. But that unfortunately doesn't save ""Spider Crawls"" or ""Children"" from plodding along and sounding a little too sparse. The album loses momentum toward the end, with Allen dragging his pedals through psychedelic soundscapes and dragging the album right behind him.</p>
<p>On album highlight ""Window Seal"", Allen siphons his instruments into a gorgeous, dreamlike state, its glacial measure augmented by a simple piano progression, celestial, chiming guitar, and distorted synthesizer. An egg shaker keeps time as Allen draws anguished melancholy from his sleepy, boyish vocals that unconvincingly project a very specific kind of emotional distance-- the kind that comes from someone so broken that he's too numb to control the tone of his voice.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Faded Days</i> is the product of a young songwriter and sound architect that proves he holds a wellspring-- almost an entire world-- of ideas, but isn't quite sure how to fully flesh them out yet. Cameron Allen has very good reason to look straight ahead to the future, because <i>Faded Days</i> sends him off on the right path.</p></div>"|15205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15205-faded-days/|6.7|Martin Douglas

It's their 20<span style=""font-size: xx-small;""><span>th</span></span> anniversary, and they're marking the occasion with a blowout, yearlong victory lap: a massive curated festival, a career-spanning documentary directed by Cameron Crowe, and loving reissues of their second and third albums, <i>Vs. </i>and <i>Vitalogy</i>. It's an unusually protracted foray into the limelight for what was once a chronically spotlight-averse band, but they seem to be wearing the moment lightly, savoring it for its valedictory worth and gladly soaking up the adulation. In the years that spanned the original release of these two albums, they spent most of their effort scrambling to escape stardom, and <i>Vs. </i>and <i>Vitalogy</i> bear their struggle's deepest marks.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This willful abdication of fame has become their most well-known, oft-told story, and seeing these records given lavish repackaging only highlights that it feels like ancient history now. Consider: The opening salvo in Pearl Jam's war against commercialism was their decision, for 1993's <i>Vs.</i>, not to make a video for MTV, a situation with no present-day analogue. Their protracted feud against Ticketmaster seems similarly remote now that Pearl Jam seemingly never stop touring: whether you live in Albany, West Palm Beach, Ljubljana, or Katowice, Pearl Jam probably just stopped by or will be there shortly, treating their entire discography like an all-you-can-eat buffet. These days, few bands are more comfortable in their own skin than Pearl Jam, and the monolithic mass culture bearing down on them in 1993 has vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>But even if the media context has long crumbled, the sound of a young band absolutely freaking the fuck out is still loud and clear on <i>Vs.</i> and <i>Vitalogy</i>, and it makes them Pearl Jam's most resonant and affecting records. Their huge-selling debut, <i>Ten</i>, hit with an impact that could not be repeated, and they would go on to make some very good music later in their career. But as a band, this remains their most vital and endearing period-- the last time the entire world cared deeply about what Pearl Jam would do next.</p>
<p>Their music, as always, remains the least complex part of this equation. Pearl Jam's retooled take on classic rock was often lumpy and flat-footed, and they sounded hopelessly unfashionable next to their punk-influenced contemporaries. But focusing on these flaws, as most rock critics did and still do, misses out on the music's signature virtue, which is communication. It is this burning and self-evident need for human connection, more than anything else, that has always elevated and redeemed their most dubious efforts, and it was a quality personified by Eddie Vedder, an empathetic lead singer who transmitted a vivid emotional intensity. At its most winning, Pearl Jam's music exudes his best personality traits: warm, earnest, generous, passionate, and, yeah, harmlessly dopey sometimes.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, <i>Vs</i>.'s cringe-inducing gun-control song ""Glorified G"". ""Kindred to being an American,"" Vedder pronounces in a hokey fake-jingo accent, over a corn-pone Skynyrd guitar lick: it's the sort of wince-inducing mess we get when he attempts to be caustic. <i>Vs.</i> is filled with this sort of clumsily wielded, early-90s political indignation, and it can make for precarious listening. Nevertheless, Vedder's anguished<i> </i>tenor anchors us through some rough waters-- including ""Dissident"", which, for some reason, focuses on the Lifetime movie-worthy story of a lonely spinster giving shelter to and falling for a charismatic young revolutionary, only to surrender him to the authorities. It is a profoundly ludicrous song. But the way Vedder hollers ""she gave him away,"" you'll catch yourself momentarily shaking your head in disgust at the woman's cowardice. Hell, even ""Glorified G"" boasts a killer bridge.</p>
<p>In retrospect, however, <i>Vs.</i> appears as the moment where it became crystal-clear that Pearl Jam's ballads were ultimately stronger than their rockers. For all their clenched fury, songs like ""Go"", ""Animal"", and ""Blood"" mostly just thrashed awkwardly in place. ""Daughter"", by contrast, is plaintive and lovely, and ""Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town"" has survived nearly two decades of dorm-room slaughtering intact, an effortless and sunlit acoustic ballad that Rod Stewart could have written for <i>Every Picture Tells a Story</i>.</p>
<p>By the time of 1994's <i>Vitalogy</i>, Pearl Jam had spent a lot of energy on extra-musical fights. Recorded during breaks on their strenuous <i>Vs.</i> tour and subject to the communication breakdown of the entire band, Vedder took his strongest hand yet in the album's direction, pushing further from arena rock pyrotechnics. Somewhere in there, the original drummer-- good-natured hesher Dave Abbruzzese-- was fired due to ""personality conflicts."" (Read: he enjoyed being famous.)</p>
<p>The resulting album is still a defiantly weird beast, though not really in the way Vedder intended it to be. Under his direction, <i>Vitalogy</i> became their ""experimental"" album-- which, in Pearl Jam lingo, translates to ""the one with all the most transparently awful ideas."" On ""Spin the Black Circle"", we are treated to the spectacle of an empathetic, intuitive surfer straining to be a splenetic NYC punk rocker, while the band behind him falls over itself trying to keep pace with a simple hardcore riff. The polyrhythmic chanting of ""Aya Davanita"" sounds like corporate-retreat weekend warriors seeking their inner third eye in a drum circle. The accordion-and-tuba spoken-word of ""Bugs"" is an avert-your eyes, car-crash attempt at Captain Beefheart surrealism. And ""Hey, Foxymophandelmama, That's Me"" is an eight-minute sound collage featuring snippets of dialog from mental patients.</p>
<p>Here's the funny thing, though, about all of <i>Vitalogy</i>'s ill-advised wandering-- it paid off elsewhere. Through all these misadventures, you can hear what was once the most rigid rhythmic backbone in rock began to stretch and pull like taffy, so that when Pearl Jam relax into a Stooges/MC5 proto-punk groove on ""Last Exit"", they sound rough, loose and limber like never before. In the snarling, adenoidal ""Satan's Bed"", Vedder actually manages one or two acerbically funny lines. It all came together on ""Corduroy"", which moves fluidly from quiet brooding to seething explosions to, in the chorus, a simple, humane plea, set to Vedder's single greatest melody.</p>
<p>""Corduroy""'s famous plea, of course, was from Vedder to his own too-adoring fans. ""I don't wanna be held in your debt,"" he sang shakily to millions-- and, entranced, they screamed it back at him. The poignancy of <i>Vitalogy</i>, and the source of its actual weirdness, is how it veers from Vedder's impulse to hide from everyone and his instinctual desire to reach out. Nothing captures these warring impulses better than ""Nothingman"" and ""Better Man"", two folk-rock pillars of their catalog that are as open-hearted and yearning as anything they ever wrote. Even when he was trying his hardest to scowl at the world, Vedder couldn't help feeling, all over the place, for everyone. Misanthropy was always unbecoming on him. Most of his best, most beloved, and resonant songs are about other people's problems: ""Nothingman"", ""Better Man"", ""Daughter"", ""Elderly Woman"". In concert, the kiss-off of ""Corduroy"" has become Pearl Jam's most joyful, communal moment.</p>
<p>Live, Pearl Jam have always been a legendarily intense experience, and they've made an alarmingly consistent<i> </i>practice of making at least momentary believers out of anyone who sees them. The <i>Vitalogy</i> and <i>Vs.</i> reissues come bundled with a recording of the band at their early peak, at a 1994 show at Boston's Orpheum. It's a rousing set, and it opens compellingly, on <i>Ten</i>'s slow-burn ""Oceans"". But years of live-Pearl-Jam-recording fatigue has dulled the impact of another official release-- this is a band that once decided to officially release <i>every single show</i> of a world tour, after all-- and <i>Live at the Orpheum Theatre</i> contains no real revelations. As they have done for years, they cover Neil Young's ""Fuckin' Up"" (the version on <i>Live on Two Legs</i> hits harder.) They play ""Even Flow""; they don't play ""Jeremy"". The only real surprises are when Vedder drastically changes the words to ""Immortality"", and when he brings out Mudhoney's Mark Arm for a vicious rip through the Dead Boys' ""Sonic Reducer"". (Unable to bring himself to utter the dreaded g-word, he introduces Arm as ""one of the forefathers of... uh... all the great music that everyone listens to."") It's a fine set, but it's hardly necessary.</p>
<p>In the ensuing decade-plus after <i>Vs.</i> and <i>Vitalogy</i>, Pearl Jam have gone from utter exile to a comfortable perch on the fringes. That's where they sit now, finding refuge in their live shows, which have developed a traveling-cult aura that clearly recalls the Grateful Dead's. For the members of Pearl Jam, however, the live shows don't just bring together their faithful; they rewrite the band's own troubled history. In 2011, it doesn't matter what song they drag out in concert: ""Lukin"", the one-minute punk brain-fart from <i>No Code</i>? The poignant but relatively rare B-side single ""I Got Id""? The ukulele song from <i>Binaural</i>? No worries: The crowd knows every word and will go absolutely apeshit for it. They can thrash joyfully through ""Spin the Black Circle"" as if Jeff Ament and Mike McCready didn't grit their way through the recording session. Hell, they can even <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYu9F2J9TbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">play ""Bugs"" live</a> now if they want. These days, they have the aura of happy, weathered warriors, proud to have just made it out together. The live show remains the most optimal set of conditions to give yourself over to their ham-fisted grandeur; go see them, if you have a chance. They'll be by soon.</p></div>"|15263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15263-vs-legacy-edition-vitalogy-legacy-edition-live-at-the-orpheum-theatre-boston/|7.6|Jayson Greene

""Daughter"", by contrast, is plaintive and lovely, and ""Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town"" has survived nearly two decades of dorm-room slaughtering intact, an effortless and sunlit acoustic ballad that Rod Stewart could have written for <i>Every Picture Tells a Story</i>.</p>
<p>By the time of 1994's <i>Vitalogy</i>, Pearl Jam had spent a lot of energy on extra-musical fights. Recorded during breaks on their strenuous <i>Vs.</i> tour and subject to the communication breakdown of the entire band, Vedder took his strongest hand yet in the album's direction, pushing further from arena rock pyrotechnics. Somewhere in there, the original drummer-- good-natured hesher Dave Abbruzzese-- was fired due to ""personality conflicts."" (Read: he enjoyed being famous.)</p>
<p>The resulting album is still a defiantly weird beast, though not really in the way Vedder intended it to be. Under his direction, <i>Vitalogy</i> became their ""experimental"" album-- which, in Pearl Jam lingo, translates to ""the one with all the most transparently awful ideas."" On ""Spin the Black Circle"", we are treated to the spectacle of an empathetic, intuitive surfer straining to be a splenetic NYC punk rocker, while the band behind him falls over itself trying to keep pace with a simple hardcore riff. The polyrhythmic chanting of ""Aya Davanita"" sounds like corporate-retreat weekend warriors seeking their inner third eye in a drum circle. The accordion-and-tuba spoken-word of ""Bugs"" is an avert-your eyes, car-crash attempt at Captain Beefheart surrealism. And ""Hey, Foxymophandelmama, That's Me"" is an eight-minute sound collage featuring snippets of dialog from mental patients.</p>
<p>Here's the funny thing, though, about all of <i>Vitalogy</i>'s ill-advised wandering-- it paid off elsewhere. Through all these misadventures, you can hear what was once the most rigid rhythmic backbone in rock began to stretch and pull like taffy, so that when Pearl Jam relax into a Stooges/MC5 proto-punk groove on ""Last Exit"", they sound rough, loose and limber like never before. In the snarling, adenoidal ""Satan's Bed"", Vedder actually manages one or two acerbically funny lines. It all came together on ""Corduroy"", which moves fluidly from quiet brooding to seething explosions to, in the chorus, a simple, humane plea, set to Vedder's single greatest melody.</p>
<p>""Corduroy""'s famous plea, of course, was from Vedder to his own too-adoring fans. ""I don't wanna be held in your debt,"" he sang shakily to millions-- and, entranced, they screamed it back at him. The poignancy of <i>Vitalogy</i>, and the source of its actual weirdness, is how it veers from Vedder's impulse to hide from everyone and his instinctual desire to reach out. Nothing captures these warring impulses better than ""Nothingman"" and ""Better Man"", two folk-rock pillars of their catalog that are as open-hearted and yearning as anything they ever wrote. Even when he was trying his hardest to scowl at the world, Vedder couldn't help feeling, all over the place, for everyone. Misanthropy was always unbecoming on him. Most of his best, most beloved, and resonant songs are about other people's problems: ""Nothingman"", ""Better Man"", ""Daughter"", ""Elderly Woman"". In concert, the kiss-off of ""Corduroy"" has become Pearl Jam's most joyful, communal moment.</p>
<p>Live, Pearl Jam have always been a legendarily intense experience, and they've made an alarmingly consistent<i> </i>practice of making at least momentary believers out of anyone who sees them. The <i>Vitalogy</i> and <i>Vs.</i> reissues come bundled with a recording of the band at their early peak, at a 1994 show at Boston's Orpheum. It's a rousing set, and it opens compellingly, on <i>Ten</i>'s slow-burn ""Oceans"". But years of live-Pearl-Jam-recording fatigue has dulled the impact of another official release-- this is a band that once decided to officially release <i>every single show</i> of a world tour, after all-- and <i>Live at the Orpheum Theatre</i> contains no real revelations. As they have done for years, they cover Neil Young's ""Fuckin' Up"" (the version on <i>Live on Two Legs</i> hits harder.) They play ""Even Flow""; they don't play ""Jeremy"". The only real surprises are when Vedder drastically changes the words to ""Immortality"", and when he brings out Mudhoney's Mark Arm for a vicious rip through the Dead Boys' ""Sonic Reducer"". (Unable to bring himself to utter the dreaded g-word, he introduces Arm as ""one of the forefathers of... uh... all the great music that everyone listens to."") It's a fine set, but it's hardly necessary.</p>
<p>In the ensuing decade-plus after <i>Vs.</i> and <i>Vitalogy</i>, Pearl Jam have gone from utter exile to a comfortable perch on the fringes. That's where they sit now, finding refuge in their live shows, which have developed a traveling-cult aura that clearly recalls the Grateful Dead's. For the members of Pearl Jam, however, the live shows don't just bring together their faithful; they rewrite the band's own troubled history. In 2011, it doesn't matter what song they drag out in concert: ""Lukin"", the one-minute punk brain-fart from <i>No Code</i>? The poignant but relatively rare B-side single ""I Got Id""? The ukulele song from <i>Binaural</i>? No worries: The crowd knows every word and will go absolutely apeshit for it. They can thrash joyfully through ""Spin the Black Circle"" as if Jeff Ament and Mike McCready didn't grit their way through the recording session. Hell, they can even <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYu9F2J9TbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">play ""Bugs"" live</a> now if they want. These days, they have the aura of happy, weathered warriors, proud to have just made it out together. The live show remains the most optimal set of conditions to give yourself over to their ham-fisted grandeur; go see them, if you have a chance. They'll be by soon.</p></div>"|15263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15263-vs-legacy-edition-vitalogy-legacy-edition-live-at-the-orpheum-theatre-boston/|8.3|Jayson Greene

It's their 20<span style=""font-size: xx-small;""><span>th</span></span> anniversary, and they're marking the occasion with a blowout, yearlong victory lap: a massive curated festival, a career-spanning documentary directed by Cameron Crowe, and loving reissues of their second and third albums, <i>Vs. </i>and <i>Vitalogy</i>. It's an unusually protracted foray into the limelight for what was once a chronically spotlight-averse band, but they seem to be wearing the moment lightly, savoring it for its valedictory worth and gladly soaking up the adulation. In the years that spanned the original release of these two albums, they spent most of their effort scrambling to escape stardom, and <i>Vs. </i>and <i>Vitalogy</i> bear their struggle's deepest marks.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This willful abdication of fame has become their most well-known, oft-told story, and seeing these records given lavish repackaging only highlights that it feels like ancient history now. Consider: The opening salvo in Pearl Jam's war against commercialism was their decision, for 1993's <i>Vs.</i>, not to make a video for MTV, a situation with no present-day analogue. Their protracted feud against Ticketmaster seems similarly remote now that Pearl Jam seemingly never stop touring: whether you live in Albany, West Palm Beach, Ljubljana, or Katowice, Pearl Jam probably just stopped by or will be there shortly, treating their entire discography like an all-you-can-eat buffet. These days, few bands are more comfortable in their own skin than Pearl Jam, and the monolithic mass culture bearing down on them in 1993 has vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>But even if the media context has long crumbled, the sound of a young band absolutely freaking the fuck out is still loud and clear on <i>Vs.</i> and <i>Vitalogy</i>, and it makes them Pearl Jam's most resonant and affecting records. Their huge-selling debut, <i>Ten</i>, hit with an impact that could not be repeated, and they would go on to make some very good music later in their career. But as a band, this remains their most vital and endearing period-- the last time the entire world cared deeply about what Pearl Jam would do next.</p>
<p>Their music, as always, remains the least complex part of this equation. Pearl Jam's retooled take on classic rock was often lumpy and flat-footed, and they sounded hopelessly unfashionable next to their punk-influenced contemporaries. But focusing on these flaws, as most rock critics did and still do, misses out on the music's signature virtue, which is communication. It is this burning and self-evident need for human connection, more than anything else, that has always elevated and redeemed their most dubious efforts, and it was a quality personified by Eddie Vedder, an empathetic lead singer who transmitted a vivid emotional intensity. At its most winning, Pearl Jam's music exudes his best personality traits: warm, earnest, generous, passionate, and, yeah, harmlessly dopey sometimes.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, <i>Vs</i>.'s cringe-inducing gun-control song ""Glorified G"". ""Kindred to being an American,"" Vedder pronounces in a hokey fake-jingo accent, over a corn-pone Skynyrd guitar lick: it's the sort of wince-inducing mess we get when he attempts to be caustic. <i>Vs.</i> is filled with this sort of clumsily wielded, early-90s political indignation, and it can make for precarious listening. Nevertheless, Vedder's anguished<i> </i>tenor anchors us through some rough waters-- including ""Dissident"", which, for some reason, focuses on the Lifetime movie-worthy story of a lonely spinster giving shelter to and falling for a charismatic young revolutionary, only to surrender him to the authorities. It is a profoundly ludicrous song. But the way Vedder hollers ""she gave him away,"" you'll catch yourself momentarily shaking your head in disgust at the woman's cowardice. Hell, even ""Glorified G"" boasts a killer bridge.</p>
<p>In retrospect, however, <i>Vs.</i> appears as the moment where it became crystal-clear that Pearl Jam's ballads were ultimately stronger than their rockers. For all their clenched fury, songs like ""Go"", ""Animal"", and ""Blood"" mostly just thrashed awkwardly in place.

He started the year facing trial for parole violation-- the same charge that's kept him in prison for a pretty good chunk of the past two years. After his lawyer filed a plea of mental incompetency, he had to spend some time in a psychiatric institution. When he got out, he pretty much confirmed his own insanity by getting a giant tattoo on his face: an ice cream cone with lightning bolts shooting out of it. <i>The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted</i>, the commercial album he released late last year, shot for crossover status and failed to get there. This year's <i>Gucci 2 Time</i> mixtape was a muddled mess. And Waka Flocka Flame, Gucci's protégé and an infinitely shittier rapper, has been outshining his onetime mentor for at least the past six months-- scoring huge radio hits, changing the face of rap, and completely dominating <i>Brick Squad Mafia</i>, the new mixtape from Gucci's 1017 Brick Squad crew. Gucci, who was rap's most exciting figure a year and a half ago, is on a profound losing streak, and it's easy to hear <i>The Return of Mr. Zone 6</i>, his new street album, as an attempt to reverse that slide.</p>
<p>It's also Gucci's attempt to update his style in a changing rap landscape. When Gucci was peaking, he was working regularly with producers like Zaytoven and DJ Speedy, whose twinkly, playful beats made an ideal backdrop for his slurry, melodic choruses and joyous bursts of wordplay. But thanks to Waka Flocka's rise, the dark, synthetic heaviness of crunk is now back in vogue, and Gucci's adjusted his sound to match. Gucci's main collaborator on <i>The Return of Mr. Zone 6</i> is Drumma Boy, the Memphis producer who's worked extensively with Gucci's onetime foe Young Jeezy and who also helmed Waka's anthem ""No Hands"". Drumma favors gothy string-churns and overdriven snares, and his beats have a grim majesty. But they aren't really suited to a rapper as gleefully drunk on language as Gucci. And so Gucci tends to slow his delivery here, putting more threat in his voice and easing up on the dizzy fun.</p>
<p>But this is still Gucci Mane, and he still comes up with some seriously sticky hooks and great turns of phrase: ""I'm a dinosaur, you a herbivore/ I use words and verbs you ain't heard before,"" ""Get ya head bust wide for ya old-man pride."" (His explanation for the ice-cream face tat is a bit unsatisfying, though: ""Ice cream on my face and chain cuz that's the life that I <i>live</i>, shawty."") Even though it's not really where he lives, Gucci can do this kind of crawling menace as well as almost anyone. With his delivery slowed down, he's still got one of the greatest voices of any rapper working: a marble-mouthed mutter that sticks to beats like peanut butter. And there are plenty of other nice moments on <i>The Return</i>: Master P coming back from faded-mogul oblivion to grunt like it's 1997 again, Birdman turning in one of his hardest verses ever, Wale continuing on in his evolution toward brutally emphatic strip-club rapper.</p>
<p>But there are also a few completely awful ideas. Gucci doesn't need to devote an entire track to <i>relationships</i> and <i>feelings</i>, the way he does on ""Better Baby""; he's at his best when he's making fun of that stuff. And he damn sure doesn't need to spend a whole song singing through Auto-Tune, which he does on ""My Year""; rappers try to sing all the time, but never quite this tunelessly. These groaners mean that Gucci's still nowhere near recapturing the momentum he had a couple of years ago. And while a few moments of that old brilliant lunacy would've gone a long way toward saving the day, he instead focuses on cranking out one solid banger after the next. The resulting album is perfectly effective, but it's almost never inspired.</p></div>"|15261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15261-the-return-of-mr-zone-6/|6.6|Tom Breihan

The band played amped-up roots rock-- twangy Creedence Clearwater Revival riffs delivered at speedy, Wipers-worthy tempos. No samplers and no drum machines, just four scowling dudes and some tube amps. Co-frontmen Rick Froberg and Sohrab Habibion did time playing raw and heavy post-hardcore-- in Hot Snakes and Edsel, respectively-- but Obits jettisoned the atonal bashing in favor of space and subtlety.</p>
<p><i>Moody, Standard and Poor</i>, the band's second full-length, is in many ways a repeat performance. Guitar duties break down along familiar lines: Rick Froberg hammers out the power chords while Sohrab Habibion plucks the echo-laden leads. Drummer Scott Gursky pounds out four-on-the-floor rhythms with mechanical precision. Obits even hired the same producers, Eli Janney and Geoff Sanoff. Two years on the road has put some wear-and-tear on the quartet's psyche, though. <i>I Blame You</i> tempered stormy feelings with the occasional glimmer of major-key hope-- the ringing open-chord chorus of ""Lilies in the Street"" or the Phil Spector stomp of ""Back and Forth"". This time around the quartet is a shade grumpier. Songs are, by turns, bitter, weary, and defeated. ""Self medication don't seem to improve my station,"" sings Froberg on ""New August"". ""I'm so tired, tired of my dreams."" Habibion, who sings two songs on the record, is similarly down in the dumps. ""You're hanging on to scraps, I'm taking what is mine,"" he yells on ""Standards"". ""I just see a ghost when I look into your eyes.""</p>
<p>Nothing can crush a rock song like good vibes, though. So it doesn't hurt that on <i>Moody, Standard and Poor</i>, life-affirming thoughts are few and far between. Album opener ""You Gotta Lose"" rides in on a propulsive ping-ponging garage-rock riff. The three-chord refrain that closes ""No Fly List"" gets Froberg whelping at
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
his sandpapery best. But the second half of the record sags. Two instrumentals-- ""Spot the Pikey"" and stormy closer ""I Blame Myself""-- feel tossed off and inessential next to gnarled rockers like ""Killer"". And even with Janney and Sanoff behind the boards, the record sounds murky and loose. <i>I Blame You </i>spoofed pro-studio production-- adding a jokey disclaimer that read, ""Xtra compressed for maximum listener fatigue."" <i>Moody, Standard and Poor</i> could stand some additional punch in the rhythm section, though.</p>
<p>Obits are only on their second record, but a generation has gone by since Froberg and Habibion first plugged into a Marshall stack. Three out of four band members are old enough to have seen Nation of Ulysses play live. While Obits may have ditched the buzz and scrape of their roots, that music's sweaty abandon, or the pursuit thereof, is still deeply embedded in Obits' sound. And that never goes out of fashion.</p></div>"|15257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15257-moody-standard-and-poor/|6.8|Aaron Leitko

One of my favorite portraits of the present-- and one that I think has become more and more common since the late 20th century-- is one that combines a technocratic near-future with a raw, distant past. Paul Simon sang about it in 1986: ""These are the days of lasers in the jungle, lasers in the jungle somewhere""-- the idea being that both the lasers and the jungle seemed slightly out of reach but still evoked the current moment. In indie music, it's become a familiar trope: Animal Collective-- who are sometimes described as ""tribal"" despite playing shows where three guys stand at podiums of decks and wires and flashing lights-- are a good example. It's a particular kind of nostalgia-- not just for James Murphy's unremembered 80s, but a kind of pre-verbal, collectively remembered moment that we can't access without electronics.</p>
<p>Chancha Via Circuito is a young Argentinian producer named Pedro Canale who makes music generally referred to as ""digital cumbia""-- a modern interpretation of a sound originally forged in Colombia when African slaves lived there during Spanish occupation. <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/zzkrecords/sets/chancha-via-circuito-rio-arriba-2010-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rio Arriba</i></a> is a dreamy, neo-primitive mix of chopped-up pan flutes, folk guitar, Coke-bottle percussion, and booming, electronically treated drums-- an almost shamanistic sound that carries its own landscape: underbrush, riverbanks, campfires. The melodies are simple and repetitive; the rhythms-- or the standard cumbia rhythm, at least-- have an uncanny quality of sounding like their upbeats are snapping back against their downbeats, firmly in step but rebelling against the next bar. They're hypnotic but jerky, a kind of rhythmic paradox.</p>
<p>As I understand it, Cumbia in Buenos Aires has long been treated as bottom-rung culture for people who are poor, old, or both-- a reputation complicated by the way in which the city, according to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1233-dj-rupture/"" target=""_blank"">DJ/rupture</a>, <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2008/07/30/fader-55-cumbia-feature/%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""look[s] wistfully towards Europe.""</a> (The local brand of cumbia is actually called ""cumbia villera""-- shantytown cumbia.) But, Canale-- along with several other young producers and DJs on <a href=""http://zzkrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ZZK Records</a> and throughout Buenos Aires-- have been revisiting and revising it over the past several years. Some of the modern permutations-- like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW-Ycjk5Y1M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pibes Chorros</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUytKF-Fi7w&amp;feature=list_related&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=MLGxdCwVVULXfXpcom9XQWuB93V64ixYxE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Damas Gratis</a>-- feel populist and celebratory, filled with aggressively synthesized accordions and saxophones. In live videos, kids bounce up and down with homemade flags while dudes in sunglasses mash keytars next to lines of barely clothed girls. It's a party.</p>
<p>Others-- like Chancha Via Circuito-- are more downtempo and atmospheric. Like Burial's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/"" target=""_blank""><i>Untrue</i></a>, <i>Rio Arriba</i> is <i>informed</i> by dance music more than it actually <i>functions as</i> dance music. One of the interesting things about CVC and some of the other people surrounding ZZK is that they've managed to make a mutated form of cumbia that actually appeals to upscale locals, too. <a href=""http://www.zzkclub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zizek</a>-- the club that ZZK Records grew out of-- is in Palermo Soho, a part of Buenos Aires known for its dressed-down fine dining and locally owned boutiques-- basically, one of those DIY microcapitalist fantasias. And what's interesting, I think, is that in both cases-- the Zizek world and the Damas Gratis/Pibes Chorros one-- the unglamorous sound of cumbia is being reclaimed by a younger, more local audience as something to celebrate.</p>
<p>Canale lives on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, and ""chancha via circuito"" roughly means ""pig on the circuit"" (or loop)-- a reference to the train he takes out from the center city every night, and an image that only reinforces the impression that <i>Rio Arriba</i> is, like an old <i>Sexy Sounds of the Jungle</i>-type exotica record, meant to be a journey. The album is dressed with samples that sound like hooting owls or jangling change-- small, ambient ornaments that give the music a sense of mystery.</p>
<p>And actually, it's when <i>Rio Arriba</i> hints more strongly at the dancefloor-- on a couple of the guest-vocal tracks toward the end-- that I fall out of its spell. Most of the time, it's is incredibly repetitive, but the repetition shows patience and restraint. And it's that patience and restraint that always  makes me feel like I've never gotten enough from the album, but it's  also what makes me able to listen to it over and over again, absorbing  its mood a little more each time. Because it never bangs my door down,  I'm happy leaving my door open.</p></div>"|15255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15255-rio-arriba/|7.9|Mike Powell

Pull up the New Orleans indie-pop duo's Wikipedia biography, and the mention of movies, television shows, and advertisements that the band has leant its music to nearly outweighs the descriptions of the 60s-fetishism that defined their debut, <i>Con Law</i>. And in all fairness, there's little question that any ad agency with a modicum of sense would be wise to snatch up a good percentage of songs from their strong, second full-length offering, <i>Actor-Caster</i>, though<i> </i>many of its sharp, sprightly songs deserve to be enjoyed in places other than in front of the TV.</p>
<p>Ted Joyner and Grant Widmer court their catchy tunes in uncomplicated ways, creating minor, genre-spanning songs that oddly locate the same sort of similar kind of grinning, crowd-pleasing affability. The dusty guitar boogie of ""Ten-Twenty-Ten"", which could pass for an early Phoenix track, is a great guidepost, showcasing the band's proclivity for lively rhythmics and frill-less, friendly hooks.</p>
<p>The variances strewn across <i>Actor-Caster</i> are subtle but welcome, highlighting, if nothing else, that this is a band that can do more than just tastefully ape the sounds of the 60s. From the <i>Graceland</i>-indebted bop of ""I Promise"" to the jerky, life-affirming thump of highlight ""You Say It Too"", Genrationals trade in a number of types of hooks. Even when they step outside their contort zone a little, like on the twinkling, MGMT-esque love song ""Yours Forever"", they do so with poise and clarity. Aside from the solid ""Dirty Mister Dirty"", which faithfully tips its hat to ELO with a woozy gruffness, the saccharine ""Goose &amp; Gander""-- which sounds like music made for tandem bike rides-- marks <i>Actor-Caster</i>'s steady decline. Acting as one last giddy hurrah, the second half of <i>Actor-Caster </i>quickly<i> </i>resigns itself to bland balladry, completely pale when compared to the livelier first act.</p></div>"|15260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15260-actor-caster/|6.6|Zach Kelly

Then, as soon as the creepy R&amp;B tracks from <a href=""http://the-weeknd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this free mixtape</a> began to circulate, the hype engine revved up. There was the <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/WelcomeOVO/status/49664358992715777"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drake cosign</a>, the album art that looked like Spiritualized crossed with Tumblr art-porn, the missing vowel, the stylish samples, and the project's creators hiding in the shadows. You can't buy buzz like this, and the Weeknd's quick rise to Internet fame, both in indie circles and in parts of the mainstream, raised fascinating questions about the blurrier-than-ever lines between those two audiences and the underground's newfound embrace of R&amp;B. (see also: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a>, Tri Angle Records, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a>.)</p>
<p>These are very interesting topics that have already spawned <a href=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/03/the_weeknd_frank_ocean.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some</a> <a href=""http://www.thirteen.org/riffcity/love-and-other-drugs-the-weeknds-altered-state-rb/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">good</a> <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/24/weeknd-rb-indie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thinkpieces</a> around the web, but set all that aside for a moment and you're still left with an album, same as always. And this album happens to be very good. The work of Toronto singer Abel Tesfaye and producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo (Drake producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, is not, as has been reported, involved in the project), <i>House of Balloons</i> is a remarkably confident, often troubling debut that excels at both forward-thinking genre-smearing and good old-fashioned songcraft. Take for starters the track ""What You Need"": with Burial-style vocal samples, techno scrape, and a sticky pop chorus, it's far from your average R&amp;B number.</p>
<p>Of course, the Weeknd are not without forebears-- producers from Rodney Jerkins to Static Major and recently The-Dream have been pushing the sonic boundaries of R&amp;B for some time now. Where the Weeknd differ, though, is that their source material pulls from the leftfield (the title track re-purposes Siouxsie and the Banshee's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeBMHnJqAvM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Happy House""</a>, two songs here ride mutated Beach House samples), and their approach is more about building vibe and atmosphere. They're great at rich, woozy compositions that send Tesfaye's aching falsetto through the mix. An example is ""The Morning"", which feels at first like a spacey synth instrumental before a stuttering digital drumbeat announces this massive, swaying chorus that enters your brain and refuses to leave.</p>
<p>The group's penchant for druggy atmospherics is mirrored in their lyrical content, which is overtly sexual, narcotics-focused, and occasionally downright frightening. Debauchery is obviously nothing new in R&amp;B, but this takes it a step further-- the drugs are harder, the come-ons feel predatory and lecherous, and the general feeling is self-hating rather than celebratory. On opener ""High for This"", Tesfaye handholds a partner through some strange sex act, singing, ""Trust me, girl, you wanna be high for this."" ""Glass Table Girls"" is pretty clearly about doing coke. Because we don't know these guys, it's hard to say whether these are real-life tales or imaginative storytelling-- you want to think the latter, but ultimately the anonymity makes it seem more disturbing.</p>
<p>What makes this whole thing work in an album context is that all the thematic and sonic pieces fit together-- these weird, morning-after tales of lust, hurt, and over-indulgence (""Bring the drugs, baby, I can bring my pain,"" goes one refrain) are matched by this incredibly lush, downcast music. It's hard to think of a record since probably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx's debut</a> (definitely a touchstone here) that so fully embodies such a specific nocturnal quality. And even though the image of nightlife painted by the Weeknd isn't a place you'd ever want to live, it's one that's frankly very hard to stop listening to.</p></div>"|15264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/|8.5|Joe Colly

She dropped a fantastic Benga-backed debut single, ""Katy on a Mission"", that vocally wrung out both elation and longing over his abrasive, buzzing stutter-step. And she kept that streak going with a couple of guest spots on Magnetic Man's self-titled record: The eerie come-on ""Crossover"" and the ecstatic jungle throwback ""Perfect Stranger"" were album highlights that proved her voice could breach the barrier of heavy-duty bass and plant its feet firmly atop it. Two UK top 5 hits later-- ""Katy on a Mission"" and the Ms. Dynamite collaboration ""Lights On""-- and members of the English music press started to peg her as the next singer to bring crossover legitimacy to bass music.</p>
<p>Turns out that'd be selling her a bit short. After pairing up with Rinse FM's tastemaker station head Geeneus and co-producer Zinc, Katy B has used <i>On a Mission</i> as a chance to posit herself as a genre-spanning pop singer who isn't tied down to a single thing, no matter how well it suits her. It's a move that makes a lot of sense, since versatility is the key to a good dance album-- let the voice establish itself, and the niche will either find itself or get broadened in the process. ""Katy on a Mission"", ""Lights On"", and ""Perfect Stranger"" reappear here in radio-edit lengths, and these three tracks help define her as someone who can play off dubstep and funky basslines with a tone that drips with cool defiance, stings with melancholy, and still grabs at you when it's being reduced to a skeletal echo. But there's enough stylistic extension here that Katy finds a way to transcend enough signifiers to call herself pop above anything else.</p>
<p>The big standout here is ""Broken Record"", a four-on-the-floor thump with electro underpinnings and a breakdown that perks up longtime dance fans with a judiciously dropped ""Amen"" break. It's one of those club-tested/radio-ready tracks that sounds good anywhere, not out of focus-grouped button-pushing but the way Katy sells it: coyly yearning and melodically sweet on the verse, intense and swooping on the chorus, wracked with ambiguity throughout. And then she finds another gear when the song finally shifts into the titular hook near the end-- the way she rolls her delivery of the line ""like-a-bro-ken rec-<i>ooooord</i>"" is the stuff that song-length buildups were made for. And there's more of that going around on the other new tracks, laid out in a number of different modes-- the trapped yet defiant punchback of opener ""Power on Me"", the sour resentment of ""Why You Always Here"", the slyly perilous seduction that drives ""Witches Brew"". It's a repertoire that gives her the appeal of a 1990s rave diva with contemporary pop-R&amp;B refinement, minus the Auto-Tune.</p>
<p>That alone would make her another noticeably talented if semi-anonymous vocalist. But she also provides a breather from pop's current fascination with vacant navel-gazing. It's not just the nods to decades-old house and jungle that provide a perspective on dance-music culture that predates the tyranny of the David Guetta era-- though Geeneus and Zinc get all the credit in the world for following up Katy's early breakthroughs with a first-rate collection of beats that reunite the disparate splinters of bass music culture past and present. What puts <i>On a Mission </i>over the top is Katy's way of expressing herself with emotions that extend past ""wooo, <i>druuunk</i>"" into more nuanced and detailed relationships with booming systems and the people who flock to them. As danceable as these tracks can be, the undercurrents of nuanced frustration and uncertainty in Katy's tone-- especially in the surrender of ""Power on Me"" and the torn-up estrangement of ""Go Away""-- amplify the tricky dynamics of relationships and hook-ups to rarefied levels, creating a tension to the music that makes epics out of dissatisfaction. And when she withdraws just a bit for one of the more introspective cuts, a haunting mid-tempo meditation on love and identity called ""Disappear"", her caught-up bewilderment says softly and resonantly what lesser singers couldn't accomplish with overblown histrionics. A genre-bound narrative might still see Katy B slotted into a narrow role that can't quite contain her, but her voice is doing its best to prove otherwise.</p></div>"|15254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15254-on-a-mission/|8.1|Nate Patrin

To figure out the number of times these devices have been used over the course of the past three years, all you need is a calculator with a properly functioning multiplication key. But by the time Hunx frontman Seth Bogart alternates between speaking and singing in the first verse, all worries that the band might lean too heavily on dull, tasteful homage are thrown out of the window. The fourth wall is brought down and the band is all smiles and gleefully reveling in sock-hop pastiche.</p>
<p>But don't get ""pastiche"" confused with ""smug ironic distance."" The 10 songs on <i>Too Young to Be in Love</i> are exuberant snapshots of rock music's earliest years, bursting with teenage romance and allusions to oral sex, but they are also very faithful ones. Backup singers are deployed (in addition to playing their respective instruments, drummer Erin Emslie, guitarist Michelle Santamaria, guitarist/organist Amy Blaustein, and bassist Shannon Shaw all contribute vocals) and the most recognizable chord progressions are used. And while the sense of enjoyment feels sincere, the band alternates between conveying uncomplicated emotion and offering up conscious subversion. Bogart is gay, which inevitably upends some of the archetypes from the 1950s and 60s. So the call-and-response of ""The Curse of Being Young"" and the bouncy ""Tonite Tonite"" sound like a local contemporary theater rewriting <i>Grease</i>, where Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson are best friends who have a crush on the same boy.</p>
<p>The vintage greaser girl-group vibe comes courtesy of producer Ivan Julian (Richard Hell and the Voidoids), working in a studio that was once graced with the presence of Bogart favorite Ronnie Spector. The record's dry, modest production highlights the vocal performances. Bogart is not exactly what you would call a classically trained singer. His distinctively nasal tone is punctuated with a lisp, so if you're the type of person who winces and grits your teeth when confronted with the voice of, say, Cassie Ramone or John Darnielle, Bogart's singing will likely try your patience. The background vocals are useful for taking the focus off of him (most notably on ""He's Coming Back""), and they are equally untrained, but not nearly as potentially divisive. On the other hand, Shaw operates as the band's charismatic secret weapon, stealing the scene on a handful of songs here. The freewheeling ""Bad Boy"" is improved by her rockabilly-leaning rasp, emotion pours out of her leads in ""The Curse of Being Young"", and during the end coda of ""If You're Not Here"", Shaw is given a vocal solo, where she wrings a great deal of emotion out of a few simple words. She creates the album's most arresting moment in the process.</p>
<p>After the 20-some-odd minutes of sounding like they're having a blast, the band slows down the tempo and changes the time signature on closer ""Blow Me Away"". With its lyrics of sadness, regret, and crying mothers, the song at first sounds like yet another one of the band's odes to young love. But it's actually about the suicide of Bogart's father during the songwriter's teenage years, giving a bolstered level of affect when he sings, ""I want you to blow your troubles down the drain/ And then you'll never, ever have to be in pain."" It's one of those rare moments on the record where Bogart shows a sense of genuine vulnerability. It also marks a potential new direction for Bogart, who after a smattering of singles and a comp (2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14015-gay-singles/"" target=""_blank""><i>Gay Singles</i></a>) finds cohesion and stability.</p></div>"|15239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15239-too-young-to-be-in-love/|7.2|Martin Douglas

Cooper hails from Orkney, a remote, sparsely populated archipelago just off the northern coast of Scotland with a strong tradition of Norse-originated folklore. <i>Nightingale</i>, an album of British folk-inflected tales, reflects a very specific, very regional flair for the curious. To wit: Cooper, along with former Verve and the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen guitarist Simon Tong, chose to record the album live, in the belly of an old warship-turned-cruise liner-turned-one-time pirate radio hub moored along the banks of the Thames in London. On its cover sits a relatively famous photo of Janet Hodgson being hurled across her bedroom, supposedly by a poltergeist. It's an art decision Cooper claims had an impact on the music found within, musing that he and his band are ""trying to create a soundtrack to an imaginary horror film about the supernatural."" So as you can see, long before we even hear a note, there's a lot going on.</p>
<p>But it doesn't add up to a very compelling listen.  Background check aside, there isn't much air to breathe for any or one of Cooper's many ideas in a given song, leaving the record as a whole even less of a chance to cohere. Opener ""So Tired in the Morning"" is a deceptively titled standout, its pile-driving guitar hook and crispy, cannonball drums delivered on rails at a feverish clip that's pure red herring. Because with the exception of the lean, Franz Ferdinand-like jitter of ""This Night"", it's a song whose sharp focus can't be found anywhere else here. Take ""Map of an Englishman"" as a fine example. Organ-grinding synths open for a jouncy chorus that tumbles in and out of dizzying, carnival-inspired whir. While the arrangement is surefire, the hodgepodge nature of it all amounts to sonic bouillabaisse: Warped-in chunks of the 1960s bump up next to one another everywhere, be it in the form of Super Furries psychedelia, Beck-like swirl, pastoral folk plucks, or the cinematic sweep of Ennio Morricone.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Nightingale</i> is as fit for the screen as Cooper had intended. ""Emmeline"" is hugely evocative, welding more crusty organ to phasered strum and a snare rim gallop that's not too, too far out of Monument Valley. ""I'm Not Really Here"" sounds like it was writen with old Bond films in mind, and ""Wealldie"" is a series of stiched-together, haunted-house experiments that put that old boat's drippy ambiance to clever use. While the latter eventually blooms into a resplendent, memorable coda, the hairbrained route it takes to get there is indicative of <i>Nightingale</i>'s most crippling problem. When Cooper is direct, his songs are all the more vibrant for it. When he buries his hooks or melodies, the results meander too much to warrant revisting. Some efforts find a way to fuse both approaches well. ""East and West"" is a beautiful, fingerpicked folk tune that doesn't cave under its zany synth flourishes, and, like its namesake, the titular track simply sings. There are martial drums and carousel keys and wild-eyed guitars and even faint rumbles from deep inside that boat. But ""Nightingale"" is not as self-consciously and aggressively manic as most of the album its named after. That's why it works.</p></div>"|15266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15266-nightingale/|5.9|David Bevan

That's not to mock Ebert as much as it is to point out that he's a successful songwriter who still seems to have very little sense of the kind of songs he writes. His debut with the Magnetic Zeros, 2009's <i>Up From Below</i>, hopscotched between downtrodden drifters, psychedelic pop, sturdy rock anthems, and the June-and-Johnny stunner ""Home"". Though enjoyable enough at times, it begged for focus. What's more, Ebert's still the frontman of Ima Robot, the dance-punk band that failed to cash in on the Franz Ferdinand moment early last decade. And now there's <i>Alexander</i>, written, played, and recorded by Ebert at home during tour breaks with the Magnetic Zeros. Equal parts charming and trying, unequal parts soul and rock and folk, it's an album that's as easy to love as it is to hate. In fact, I can't keep myself from doing both at once.</p>
<p><i>Alexander</i> employs the same eclectic, inclusive, and ultimately undecided aesthetic as Ebert's more famous main gig. There's a little reggae here, a little communal Afropop there, all covered in a homespun lo-fi haze. The album ends with a long, sad-eyed ballad that mirrors ""A Change is Gonna Come"" and a cheery little number that pays Serge Gainsbourg his due, if not his royalties. It begins, though, with a bustling burst of folk-pop called ""Let's Win!"". All frantic strums, wonky bridges, and staggered harmonies, it's like listening to Stephen Stills in a yellow submarine. That arms-outstretched approach has its moments, for sure: ""Truth"" is an unlikely hit waiting in the wings, with Ebert whistling around a staggering beat and chalky rhyming that suggest Jason Mraz dazed on Dilaudid. It's sort of perfect.</p>
<p>Thing is, most every brilliant turn <i>Alexander</i> makes comes mitigated by some glaring misstep, and vice versa. ""A Million Years"", for instance, is the type of effortless, tender pop tune that your parents still hum from their childhood memories. It's a portrait of a once-lost soul who has finally found the woman that not only makes him believe in love but also, toward track's end, makes him howl like a <i>Lion King</i> extra. It's ebullient, effective, and unforgettable, but it's certainly editable, as Ebert tacks on a minute-long coda of grunts and harmonies that mostly feel like his request to join Akron/Family. But the Dylan vocal affectations and bland gospel references of ""Bad Bad Love"" swivel over an interesting mix of Pops Staples guitars and tessellating one-man harmonies. And though the fuzzy R&amp;B traipse ""Remember Our Heart"" is a bit textbook, Ebert sings it like he feels it, howling about romantic disappointment with the spirit of a better soul singer. But Ebert can only save himself for so long, with some tangent or extraneous touch always curbing his best efforts.</p>
<p>Still, there's something to be said for a songwriter as restless as Ebert. Sure, <i>Alexander</i> is an unsteady and uncertain release, but it's also a trial run by someone who has already made it. Musically, Ebert's a devil to tag, in large part because he seems to enjoy music-- hearing it, absorbing it, and, yes, sometimes imitating it-- so much. Mostly for that reason, he's yet to make a singularly compelling album, one long statement that should forever stand as his.</p></div>"|15252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15252-alexander/|5.9|Grayson Currin

After all, from the outside, he's been releasing albums for one of the most respected large independent labels in the world, 4AD, since 2002<i>. The New Yorker</i> has <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crmu_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">called him</a> one of the greatest living lyricists, and <i>Spin</i> slapped his praises on its cover just last week. He's recently wowed the late-night circuit, sold out three consecutive nights at the Bowery Ballroom, and released his latest album, the masterstroke <i>All Eternals Deck</i>, on Merge Records, the independent label located within walking distance of his North Carolina home that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41559-arcade-fire-win-the-album-of-the-year-grammy/"" target=""_blank"">landed a major Grammy</a> last month. That's not bad for a writer who used to howl and strum into the microphone of his Panasonic boombox and opine that a real songwriter wasn't a career-oriented songwriter.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But in 2002-- when Darnielle made the leap to 4AD and, more saliently, into a proper studio with an ensemble of backing musicians-- his zealous fans started talking about his music as though it were foreign policy. Some loved the new adventurousness and accessibility, apparent from the great bloom of Mountain Goats fans during the last decade. But there are those who insist that the only real Mountain Goats is the atavistic Mountain Goats, the static-y, crackly, mildly manic stuff that Darnielle made mostly alone for more than a decade. To wit, <a href=""http://www.mountain-goats.com/forums/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Mountain Goats forums</a>, which Darnielle hosts on his own website, are a minefield of hot-blooded criticism about the band's rock music, lobbed not by online trolls but by those who might spend hundreds to track down Darnielle's earliest, most primitive releases. After the band released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41270-new-mountain-goats-damn-these-vampires/"" target=""_blank"">""Damn These Vampires""</a>, the positive jam that opens <i>All Eternals Deck</i>, Mountain Goats drummer Jon Wurster told me the vile was so rich he simply stopped reading the boards.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This matters now because, despite the fan fusillade, Darnielle has pressed on with his rock band, crafting and sharpening his skills and charisma as a frontman. Paradoxically passionate but controlled, uncompromising but instantly likable, <i>All Eternals Deck</i> is a certain career highlight for Darnielle. And, like many of the most memorable Mountain Goats songs, it's also about survival, or battling back from very dark places to ""follow the light."" Indeed, most every song here holds some key to the future, some talisman meant for perseverance. During ""Damn These Vampires"" and ""Beautiful Gas Mask"", it's didactic, warm advice. Occasionally, however, it's a reflection on the past, when some rocky relationship made more sense, when the world seemed framed by more favorable horizons. The poignant ""Age of Kings"", for instance, reminisces about a wasted love that once suggested a divine blessing. But just as the strings turn anxious, Darnielle remembers the time he might have fixed it all; his regret feels less like self-pity, though, and more like a future lesson.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>All Eternals Deck</i> is officially the third album for the rock band the Mountain Goats, or the trio of Darnielle, longtime bassist Peter Hughes, and Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster. On 2009's <i>The Life of the World to Come</i>, though, Wurster and Hughes felt more like plainspoken accompaniment, simply keeping time and stretching the sound around Darnielle when not sitting out nearly half a dozen tunes. After four years of live practice, they now sound like a properly developed unit that's comfortable with its ideas and approaches. There are no ham-fisted reggae rubs or overreaching rock moments; instead, the band simply plays with nuance and purpose, elaborating the lyrics by first understanding them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Darnielle replaces his rhythm section twice here, and the success of both songs suggests that the evolution of the Mountain Goats doesn't stop with a rock trio. ""Outer Scorpion Squadron"" should forever quell the gripe that Darnielle can't sing. Above an economical string section, Darnielle speaks of survival with grace and delicacy. The record's one great experiment, mid-album curveball ""High Hawk Season"", swaps the rhythm section for a harmonizing trio known as the North Mountain Singers. Though Darnielle plays acoustic guitar, they treat the song like an a cappella ensemble would, adding bass and texture against his lead line. A call to power, it's one of Darnielle's pinnacles as both a bandleader and songwriter, and a revelatory break from his past. ""Who's going to stand his ground, and who's going to blink?"" he sings, as though winking to his detractors.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Three songs on <i>All Eternals Deck</i> lift directly from the lives of veteran American actors-- Charles Bronson, Judy Garland, and her daughter, Liza Minnelli. In each instance, we see a star in peril, whether it's Garland during the overdose in London that killed her or tough-guy Bronson trying to hold it together for one more feature. In both cases, Darnielle invokes their birthplace, their cradle of innocence, again using the past as a catalyst for perseverance. On ""Sourdoire Valley Song"", Darnielle smartly cuts the other way by referencing the Olduvai Gorge, the Tanzanian ravine sometimes referenced as the birthplace of mankind. An old man struggles and dies, and the world turns. Our struggles, the implication goes, are forever and for everyone-- stars, successful songwriters, ancient hominids thought to be extinct. Even if it means you ""crawl 'til dawn on hands and knees,"" though, you keep going if you can. Lucky for us, the rock band the Mountain Goats have done just that.</p></div>"|15259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15259-all-eternals-deck/|8.1|Grayson Currin

To cement his workaholic stature, Wincek released the latter song and ""Glass Bubbles"" ahead of this record, and both of those tracks are complemented by beautifully packaged mixtapes that feature further unreleased material.</p>
<p>It's clear that a great amount of care and attention to detail has been spread all over this record; it's there in the diligent curation of those singers and in the themed cover art by <a href=""http://draplin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aaron Draplin</a>. It's also there in the music itself-- Wincek and fellow guitarist Andrew Fitzpatrick have an intuitive knack for delicately stacking up spidery riffs so they work perfectly in tandem, while drummer Ben Derickson and bassist Matthew Skemp demonstrate a mastery of subtly infectious and understated grooves. Some of the touchstones for this music are clear from the outset; the opening ""Holography"" is driven by the kind of ever-cycling drumbeat Klaus Dinger made his trademark in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a>, and the compressed guitar squall is reminiscent of the tones <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3391-archer-prewitt/"">Archer Prewitt</a> lays over the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"">Sea and Cake</a>'s best tracks. But the breezy vocal humming and frantic soloing toward the end of the song pitch it in a realm where those influences are infused with an unlikely prog and pop crossover, ultimately positioning it in a space unique to All Tiny Creatures.</p>
<p>From that point on, this is music that sucks you in, that creates a realm full of niggling little harmonies and treated sounds so densely layered that they reveal more only with repeat plays. Vernon's vocal isn't even the most alluring part of ""An Iris""-- the song finds its weight through a lightness of touch in the guitar melodies and a puzzling loop that sounds like the noise a person emits when someone treads on their toe. That song sets the emotional tone for the record, with most of <i>Harbors</i> bearing a bittersweet ambiance that its vocalists tap into. In some cases, such as Ryan Olcott's hoarse tones on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12137-glass-bubbles/"">Playlisted</a> ""Glass Bubbles"", it's those vocals that temper the bouncing guitar lines from shifting the track too far toward ebullience. In others, that crestfallen feeling can be more overtly felt in the instrumentation, such as the chiming guitars on ""Breathing Set"", or the muted electronic passages of ""Valves or Hatches"" and the Eno-esque ""Triangle Frog"".</p>
<p>It's striking how <i>Harbors</i> manages to form a central aesthetic that's identifiable as All Tiny Creatures but can also fold in a wide array of influences. The whimsical backing vocals on ""Cargo Maps"" are reminiscent of the kind of experimentation Brian Wilson was mapping out for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">the Beach Boys</a> on tracks like ""Roll Plymouth Rock"", and the stop-start segment of ""Aviation Class"" manages to bridge Wincek's fascination with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/labels/136-warp/"">Warp</a>-style electronic artists and his leanings toward more traditional forms of shiny guitar pop. The focus starts to slip a little toward the end, with another diversion into ambient drift on ""Reservoirs"" and more ""ahh-ahh"" vocal passages in ""Tine Feature"". But the rippling guitar and choir-like singing of the closing ""Plankton March"" ties the loose ends together and again showcases this group's gift for sifting bundles of sincerity into song via the disparate elements at their disposal. That sense of focus on making emotionally redolent material, and keeping the overall thrust of the project in view despite having many hands on the tiller, are ultimately what makes <i>Harbors</i> solidify into a satisfyingly cohesive whole.</p></div>"|15203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15203-harbors/|7.8|Nick Neyland

More than two decades away from anything is a long time, but in popular music, 20 years is practically a geologic epoch-- everything changes, from the sounds on the records to the social conditions under which they're made. Back in their 1970s heyday, Poly-Rythmo were a nearly unmatched force, playing easily in any style on the stage and developing a sound all their own in the studio. Founded in 1966 as the Sunny Blacks Band (sometimes written Sunny Black's Band) by singer/guitarist Mélomé Clément, the group took the name Poly-Rythmo in 1969 in reference to the fact that they played all rhythms, and over the next 16 years, they recorded over 50 albums and hundreds of 45s for pretty much every label that ever operated in Benin.</p>
<p>The band was hobbled by the 1982 deaths of guitarist Papillon and drummer Yehouessi Léopold, and eventually petered out as the 80s wore on. A flash forward to the last few years finds the band finally being discovered by listeners outside of West Africa, the archival efforts of the Analog Africa, Soundway, and Popular African Music labels bringing the band's achievements into the light. And as with several of the their counterparts, the renewed interest brought the band back together. Or a new version of the band, at least. The 10-piece group that cut <i>Cotonou Club</i> contains five original Poly-Rythmo members-- Clément, singer Vincent Ahéhéhinnou, guitarist Maximus Ajanohun, saxophonist Pierre Loko, and bassist Gustave Bentho-- joined by six other musicians, some of whom have a bit of history with the group.</p>
<p>Does the new Poly-Rythmo measure up to the old? In a few very important respects, it does. It's never going to be the 70s again, of course, and there is a certain spirit of invention and restless creativity on the best of the classic Poly-Rythmo records that a project like this has little hope of recapturing. But it's more than a simple nostalgia trip. For one thing, it doesn't entirely give in to the appetite for funk that caused European and American audiences to get interested in the first place. Sure, most of the music leans that way, but Poly-Rythmo were always an eclectic band, and they haven't forgotten that here, mixing in a bit of highlife and rumba and taking a few surprising side trips into jazz. The result is something that feels a little like one of their old LPs with more studio polish-- producer Elodie Maillot took care to record the band on analog equipment to get some semblance of the natural warmth of their old albums, but the sound is left unadorned, just the band playing.</p>
<p>Amongst the new songs, they revisit a few past glories of Beninois music, including their biggest hit, ""Gbeti Madjro"". On it, they've recruited Benin's biggest pop star, Angelique Kidjo, to share the lead with Ahéhéhinnou while the band holds down the classic breakneck Poly-Rythmo groove, derived from a blend of funk and vodoun ceremonial rhythms. The band spins through tough Latin funk on ""Koumi Dede"", setting merengue piano against stabbing guitar and making room for a startling jazz solo by keyboardist Moïse Loko. Gnonnas Pedro's classic ""Von Vo Nono"" (featured on Analog Africa's <i>Legends of Benin</i> compilation) gets a slowed-down heavy funk treatment, the twin guitars of Ajanohun and Fifi LePrince put air in the highlife lilt of ""Ma Vie"", and there's even an unexpected collaboration with Franz Ferdinand's Nick McCarthy and Paul Thomson on ""Lion Is Burning"", a thumping Afrobeat rave-up that's been slotted as a bonus track.</p>
<p>I don't expect Orchestre Poly-Rythmo to return to their old prolific ways, but it's good to hear from them again. A common theme with these West African bands that have returned in the last decade-- think Bembeya Jazz and Orchestra Baobab-- is that they were dominant in their best years, but the stories ended unsatisfactorily. Coming back now and releasing albums that are close to the level of their classic material, not to mention playing around the world to big crowds, provides a sort of closure. It ends a long song on a high note, and if we're lucky, maybe even begins a new verse. Twenty-odd years ago, when Poly-Rythmo last made a studio album, they were at their lowest ebb. <i>Cotonou Club</i> finds them at another high.</p></div>"|15232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15232-cotonou-club/|7.7|Joe Tangari

For instance, if you have a small puddle on your kitchen counter and put the edge of a paper towel in it while holding the towel vertically, water will spread up the towel. In the most basic sense, capillary action is liquid moving in an unexpected direction. This is what makes it an effective name for Jonathan Pfeffer's band-- unexpected directions are at the root of Pfeffer's songwriting, which is partly predicated on defying the momentum of uninterrupted 4/4 rhythms. We used to call what he does math rock, but that's not quite adequate to cover all the weird jazz elements the latest lineup of the band brings in, or the way he and the band tease listeners with bits of surprisingly poppy melody before yanking out the rug.</p>
<p>The opening couplet of the second verse on the album, ""It's agreed that this is a suicide mission/ But we're past the point of no return now,"" feels almost like a private joke between band and listener-- by the time we hit it, we've already swerved through a couple of time signatures, a few start-stops, and a breakneck prog-funk groove, and it's clear that this is not a relaxing album. That won't be a surprise to people familiar with the band, but the way they go about it will. Whereas 2008's <i>So Embarrassing</i> often reverted to brutal, punk-inspired noise rock as a sort of punctuation mark, those outbursts are largely curtailed here, in favor of sophisticated vocal harmony and passages that borrow from free jazz. Pfeffer also leaves his electric guitar in the case, sticking to a nylon-stringed acoustic, while the band is built around upright bass, drums, trumpet, and accordion.</p>
<p>Thing is, I didn't even notice the lack of electric guitar until the third time I listened to the album. The band wrings remarkable volume and aggression out of its setup, due partly to the fact that Dan Sutherland's drums are recorded with a heavy emphasis on the low end. They snap like you're in the room with them, which makes songs like album highlight ""Feeding Frenzy"" sound explosive. On that song, the drums are augmented by a battery of other percussion, including gongs, woodblocks, and handbells. In fact, there's not a single non-percussion instrument on the song other than voices, but again, it doesn't call attention to its novelty.</p>
<p>Not everything works as well. Sometimes a weird rhythm just sounds weird-- ""Sweepstakes"" has what sounds like a pre-composed vocal melody that doesn't really agree with the lyrics, and it makes for an awkward vocal. A band that pushes itself out of usual rock comfort zones as unflinchingly as Capillary Action is almost inevitably going to have moments that don't work as well as others, though. It's being willing to take those risks and succeeding most of the time that makes them a good band, and <i>Capsized</i> a good album.</p></div>"|15249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15249-capsized/|7.1|Joe Tangari

Leading lights <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"" target=""_blank"">Low</a> have carved out an enduring legacy, but their former peers, including the desolate sounds of former Sub Pop act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"" target=""_blank"">Codeine</a>, Jeff Martin's brittle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2074-idaho/"" target=""_blank"">Idaho</a>, and hushed Trance Syndicate signings <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/321-bedhead/"" target=""_blank"">Bedhead</a>, are rarely cited as touchstones by contemporary artists. The slowcore approach ostensibly took impossibly sad material, both musically and lyrically, and pushed it into a hemmed-in framework, where feelings of agitation and despair were expressed in the same forlorn way as a resigned late-night drinker slumped over his umpteenth whiskey at the bar. Occasional traces of this sound do surface-- Mogwai are clearly fans of the wrenching emotional heave at the center of Codeine's music-- but it's rare to find a band so clearly indebted to the style as Texas three-piece True Widow.</p>
<p>But there's a lot more to this band than a generous nod toward their slowcore antecedents. For one thing, True Widow's guitars are much louder and grittier, with a vast bone-crunching slab of murky distortion laid thick over the snail-paced grooves they settle into. They've even taken a stab at coining their own genre, ""stonegaze,"" to describe this sound, although it's perhaps unwise to assume this is anything other than an inter-band joke. Some of the titles (""Blooden Horse"", ""Skull Eyes"", ""Doomseer"") suggest material that is far darker than the wares actually on offer here, but it's clear that True Widow get their kicks from throwing a spanner in the works on occasion. It's there in the mysterious, over-long, but strangely fitting title of the record, and in the mix-up of Josh Homme-style churning riffage circa the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> album and the floaty, angelic vocals of bassist Nikki Estill on the opening ""Jackyl"".</p>
<p>That song is a fine demonstration of this band's complete mastery of control-- the seething guitar sound of Dan ""D.H."" Phillips makes it feel like they might spin off into recklessness at any moment, but they never do. Instead, True Widow slump into ennui and remain locked down there for the duration. The majority of the vocals are sung by Phillips, who enters the fray with ""Blooden Horse"", which compliments Estill's cooing with pangs of foreboding and cold-sweat rumination. The lyrics are wrung out with the same shaved-down discipline as the music, where nothing ever topples over into over-wrought emoting. Despite this rigid adherence to restraint, much of this material proves to be emotionally affecting-- Phillips' work peaks on ""NH"", which plays out like a slo-mo dip into the bleak blues of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"" target=""_blank"">Mudhoney</a>'s ""If I Think"" and Codeine's ""D"", with great lashes of poignancy added via Estill's heavily reverbed backing vocals.</p>
<p>The sludge-like pace rarely abates, but there are variations in mood, principally in the lengthy ""Boaz"", which Phillips floods with light through a soaring vocal line that pulls the song out of its squalid origins. The only true misstep is ""Night Witches"", the sole concession to a quickening of pace that ends up feeling forced, especially as we are immediately dipped back into the mire with the wonderfully doomy ""Wither"". The torporific riffing of the closing ""Doomseer"" is where True Widow sign off, and they use its nine-minute runtime to subtly evolve their sound, with odd whistling noises at the midway point and a surprise lurch into a different time signature. There's even a subordinate push out of their lockhold groove when Phillips hits a guitar solo two-thirds of the way in, causing the song to peter out into ambient noise. But ""Doomseer"" ultimately embodies everything this band does so well, where those basic slowcore tenets-- raw emotion tightly mastered and boxed into a corner where it's antithetically filtered into barely restrained stoicism-- are given another welcome gasp of air.</p></div>"|15202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15202-as-high-as-the-highest-heavens-and-from-the-center-to-the-circumference-of-the-earth/|7.4|Nick Neyland

In the popular imagination, that might be the case for Peter Bjorn and John-- three affable Swedish popsters doomed to be forever remembered for one damnably catchy whistle. But such a reading would be to forget that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51V1VMkuyx0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Young Folks""</a>, with all its whistling and bongos and Victoria Bergsman verses, came surrounded by an album of other outstanding pop songs. ""Young Folks"" was the tip, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9518-writers-block/"" target=""_blank""><i>Writer's Block</i></a> was an iceberg-- a much bigger, more difficult obstacle for follow-ups to navigate around.</p>
<p>Their next proper album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12874-living-thing/"" target=""_blank""><i>Living Thing</i></a> (which came following a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11337-the-last-tycoon/"" target=""_blank"">solo album</a> from singer/guitarist Peter Morén and the instrumental effort <i>Seaside Rock</i>), attempted to skirt such expectations by dramatically shifting the band's sound and mood-- from the cheerful nostalgia and romantic struggles of <i>Writer's Block</i> to a darker, more embittered outlook; from spring thawing guitars and drums to a more intentionally spare and sharply frozen sound.</p>
<p><i>Gimme Some</i> has been spun as a return to the band's sunnier, more winning sound, but it too often fails to reproduce <i>Writer's Block</i><span>'s </span>unexpected spark. The band seems to acknowledge as much on lead single ""Second Chance"". Over claps and cowbell, Peter Morén coos in his slightly mushy, softly accented voice, ""You can't can't count on the second try/ The second try is such a comedown."" It may be an apt sentiment, but the song feels intent on proving the point
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
via its own limpness. By far the most galling thing here, though, is is the cruise-ship conga-line leading ""Dig a Little Deeper"", with its sing-song ""oh-oh!""s and the dull semantic argument of its chorus: ""All art has been contemporary.""</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the album is merely listless. Opener ""Tomorrow Has to Wait"" is a sort of PB&amp;J-by-numbers lope better hidden in the back half of an album. ""Eyes"" has a pleasant, clappy shuffle, and a catchy, Spanish-inflected guitar line, trilling and pinched, that dissolves into a fuzzy solo for the song's final minute. These guys are capable musicians and studio heads, and mechanically speaking, these are fine pop songs-- well crafted, ably produced, everything in its right place-- but they don't particularly move you.</p>
<p>The album's better bits pop up on its second half, after some listeners' interest will have waned. ""Breaker Breaker"" briefly re-invigorates things with upbeat, ramshackle drums, a churning rhythm guitar, and a quick, rising melody on the chorus. ""(Don't Let Them) Cool Off"" begins as garage-rock pastiche but opens up into more delicate guitar picking without losing its momentum. ""Down Like Me"" is a fine, downbeat ballad, Morén's voice up in the mix so that you can just hear every gulp and breath before he launches into his self-pitying refrain. And <i>Gimme Some</i>'s best song, far and away, is ""Lies"", a high-reaching and high-scoring number that more than anything here recalls what made PB&amp;J so endearing in the first place. It's just nothing to whistle home about.</p></div>"|15251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15251-gimme-some/|6.2|Eric Grandy

There's an uncomfortable inevitability about her sudden stardom, as though superproducer Dr. Luke and the people at Universal Music Group decreed that she would be huge whether we wanted her or not. So far she's done okay-- her single ""Price Tag"" is performing well at pop radio and digital retail-- but it's hard to say whether she's going to have much traction in the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Mainly, Jessie J seems to be surplus to demand. The contemporary pop landscape is already crowded with well-defined female pop stars-- postmodern disco artiste Lady Gaga, fierce soul goddess Beyoncé, slovenly party girl Ke$ha, cheesecake goofball Katy Perry, cyborg sexpot Britney Spears, troubled ice queen Rihanna, and perennial underdog Robyn. Jessie J is much more of a cipher; she is set apart mainly by the fact that she is British, though her accent only occasionally comes through in her performances. She comes across like a severely dumbed-down Lily Allen at best, and at worst she seems like someone you would want to root against in a televised singing competition. Her approach to song selection on her debut album reinforces the singing-competition vibe-- the music is scattered, covering all the bases in an over-eager attempt to prove vocal chops. It's very ironic, then, that she titled the record <i>Who You Are</i>, because she does pretty much everything but assert a coherent identity over the course of 13 tracks.</p>
<p>Jessie J, otherwise known as Jessica Cornish, already had a successful career as a songwriter going before becoming a pop star in her own right. Most notably, she co-wrote Miley Cyrus' hit ""Party in the U.S.A."" with Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly. Clearly she has some chemistry with these two, as the most tolerable cuts on <i>Who You Are</i> happen to be collaborations with them. Very faint praise, though: ""Price Tag"" sounds like Nelly Furtado fronting Sugar Ray, and ""Abracadabra"" could pass for a reasonably decent Natasha Bedingfield deep cut. Cornish co-wrote the rest of the tracks with various writers, and the results are competent but generic.</p>
<p>In some cases, it is all too obvious that the writers are trying to write a ""type"" of song. ""Casualty of Love"", for example, sounds like Alicia Keys' wonderful ""If I Ain't Got You"" stripped of melodic complexity, ambiance, soul, and sentimental resonance. The single ""Do It Like a Dude"" is dancehall pastiche that isn't too far off from Robyn's ""Dancehall Queen"", but trades that singer's warmth and humanity for spiteful hectoring. The acoustic ballad ""Big White Room"" aims for beautiful simplicity, but its delicacy is drowned out by a clumsy and overwrought vocal performance.</p>
<p>Jessie J's persona seems most defined when she is being totally obnoxious. Though she mostly sticks to the predictable un-nuanced phrasing of many young singers desperate to prove that they possess a ""good voice,"" she sometimes employs a snarky singsong that is very shrill, but at least somewhat distinct. She goes over the top with this affectation on the bratty rocker ""Who's Laughing Now"", a song that could very well be the nadir of modern pop's fixation with attacking ""haters."" The track has her lashing out against acquaintances who she claims bullied her and dissed her early music, but now show an interest in her since she has attained some degree of success. While it is fair to distrust people who transparently want a piece of you, the details in the lyrics seem a bit too minor to merit her intense vitriol. The song is a humorless expression of galling entitlement; the sound of a person who will conflate any form of criticism or disapproval with an attempt to crush her soul. ""Who's Laughing Now"" seems to be pitched as a motivational song, but it's so narcissistic and myopic that it's hard to imagine anyone connecting with the singer's petty grudges and desperate need for constant affirmation.</p>
<p>Cornish is an alum of London's prestigious BRIT School, the arts academy that has launched the careers of several notable young British singers including Amy Winehouse, Adele, Katy B, Jamie Woon, and Kate Nash. Weirdly, of this crop of singers, only Cornish very obviously seems like a person who went to a school for pop stars, with all the tackiness that would imply. She shares their polish and poise, but none of her peers' individual style. Whereas Adele and Winehouse also have powerhouse voices, they fit into clear aesthetic niches and invest their songs with depth and humanity. Jessie J doesn't have even a fraction of their restraint; her idea of showcasing her gift is to shoot for a blaring melisma on ""Mamma Knows Best"" that makes Christina Aguilera seem as subtle as Joni Mitchell by comparison.</p>
<p>On the same weekend Jessie J was getting her first big push in America as the musical guest on ""Saturday Night Live"", the music video for Rebecca Black's ""Friday"" was just beginning to spread around the Internet as a viral sensation. ""Friday"" took off because people were calling it the worst song ever and mocking its dopey lyrics and awkward approximation of standard modern pop tropes. The biggest difference between Black's song and the contents of <i>Who You Are</i> is that while Jessie J gets the expected formula of pop ""right,"" the hapless Black gets it ""wrong."" But in that ""wrongness"" lies a humanity that J cannot approach. Even through bad vocal processing, Black sounds like a specific person. Also, the lyrics of ""Friday"" may be undeniably clunky, but there is a magic to them that makes the song funny and immensely quotable, like a lot of great pop songs throughout history. Jessie J's lyrics are no less banal and artless, but they lack charm entirely. When she's not going off on bitter rants against those who doubt her, she mainly sings forgettable boilerplate or spouts vapid utopian nonsense, as on the utterly nauseating ""Rainbow"". Black gets attacked for representing the worst of modern pop, but she's a gawky 13-year-old amateur backed up by a Z-grade production company. If you need to rail against dumb, soulless music, Jessie J is a far better target.</p></div>"|15246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15246-who-you-are/|2.0|Matthew Perpetua

He's the type of name that can pack houses and play festivals overseas but can probably <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/derrick-carter-house-music/Content?oid=3432287"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">walk around his native Chicago without being noticed</a>. Carter hails from a generation of electronic artists who have enjoyed this peculiar fame dichotomy, and like many of those producers, he has built his reputation on DJ sets and remixes more than his original productions. This makes him a natural choice for Fabric's bi-monthly mix series, a legacy artist who still has pull.</p>
<p>Carter absolutely deserves his reputation behind the decks; he favors aerobic, loud tracks that lean heavily on jackin' house (more specifically the type of fleshed-out, studio-produced house music that Chicago was churning out in the 1990s after the style gained its footing) but has also been willing to step outside that style to incorporate modern artists (e.g. Hercules and Love Affair) into his mixes. It's tough to say what went wrong on <i>Fabric 56</i>; Carter's first commercial mix since 2005 trades heavily in classic Chicago sounds, but it's devoid of the humor and pacing that have marked Carter's best work.</p>
<p>Carter has never been shy about leaning on tracks with major funk and disco influences, and <i>Fabric 56</i> sounds particularly indebted to funk and R&amp;B from the 1970s. Tracks like Roger Sanchez's ""My Organ"" contribute to a steady, dense mix that sometimes feels like the classic rock version of house music: age-old rhythms punctuated by horns, hammond organs, and a noticeable sense of The Way Music Should Be. These moments are charmless at best and more often suffocating; this mix replaces house's self-referential up-with-people/up-with-dancing ethos with a self-congratulating largesse. If you like your dance music funny, dubby, or sexually suggestive (instead of aggressive), look elsewhere.</p>
<p>That <i>Fabric 56</i> doesn't represent my personal house music utopia is hardly Carter's fault; that the mix barrels along without thought given to the dynamics of volume and tempo certainly is. Carter's choices undoubtedly play better in large rooms on world-class soundsystems, but the constant, hard-charging attitude makes <i>Fabric 56 </i>a poor choice for home listening. Loathe to disrupt his selections, Carter lets the tracks here play for five and six minutes at a time, but they lack a narrative, sonic or otherwise. Carter is normally known for  the rampant sexual energy of his sets, but <i>Fabric 56</i> isn't particularly erotic or sultry. The mix actually <i>closes</i> with a spiraling, up-tempo jazz freakout; this is Carter's idea of a comedown.</p>
<p>Carter has never been house music's most subtle DJ, but his aggressive tone and execution backfire here. Though his legacy is already secure, <i>Fabric 56</i> was an opportunity to document Carter's style for a new audience; his history-indebted tracklist suggests this might have even been his intent. Carter told the <i>Chicago Reader</i> that DJing is ""work"" for him at this point; let's consider <i>Fabric 56</i> just a bad day at the office.</p></div>"|15241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15241-fabric-56/|5.1|Andrew Gaerig

So when psychedelic pop twosome Moon Duo-- which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/"" target=""_blank"">Wooden Shjips</a>' Erik ""Ripley"" Johnson on guitar and fellow San Franciscan Sanae Yamada on keyboards-- decided to head to the German capital to craft their second proper full-length, <i>Mazes</i>, one could reasonably expect the results to be a bit tortured or mysterious. Where their noticeably toothy debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14117-escape/"" target=""_blank""><i>Escape</i></a>, often threatened to slip backwards into the scuzz-laden heavy-psych of a Wooden Shjips record, <i>Mazes </i>is an exercise in accessibility and concision, using familiar, melodic pop templates to support their drone and krautrock tendencies.</p>
<p><i>Mazes</i> operates very simply, with Yamada setting up the repetitive, unexpectedly hooky keyboard patterns (usually using a variation of organ sounds) and Johnson, displaying some of his best guitar work to date, dropping monstrous, zoned-out sounds over her backdrops. While there are plenty of gnarly effects pedals being stomped all over <i>Mazes</i>, Johnson for the most part refrains from using his guitar to blanket these songs in trance-inducing washes of noise. Moon Duo are still able to achieve awing levels of depth here, but it's made more impressive considering how easy these songs are to follow. Where some of their output (and the same can be said about Wooden Shjips) is about getting lost in the fog, the band helpfully lays a trail of breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>This is also a much more consciously rhythm-focused album that its predecessor, and when songs fall flat (""Scars"") it's usually because Moon Duo haven't taken the time to make sure the groove is properly locked in place. The one you'll hold on to tightest is ""When You Cut"", a deranged sock-hop that rains a torrential boogie on <i>Mazes</i> with such force that it threatens to wash everything else out. Yamada and Johnson work with such precision and symbiotic rigor, going ape over the handclap-filled drum programming, it's a mystery as to why Johnson keeps singing, ""I feel the walls closing in on me."" Instead, it feels as if the doors have been flung wide open.</p></div>"|15245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15245-mazes/|7.5|Zach Kelly

In fact, any tidbit would be more helpful than the scraps of info we have. Initially scheduled for a release last fall, the UK synth-pop producer's proper debut for Atlantic was postponed, replaced with an effervescent, new-wavey single, ""Never Know"", as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/762-primary-1/1287-never-know/"" target=""_blank"">a corresponding candy-painted clip</a>, with a tentative LP release date for ""February 2011."" That deadline came and went. Then, in the beginning March, the record was unceremoniously dumped onto the Internet as a UK-only digital release, announced a mere 10 days prior and billed as Primary 1's ""posthumously released debut album."" An attached statement noted that Flory was already working on new music under a different guise. That particular item was framed a bit like a promise, but it felt more like an apology.</p>
<p>So, what happened? It's possible that Flory encountered the same obstacles that would trip up anyone making the transition from bedroom beat fiddler (see: 2009's pleasantly loping, intermittently charming mini-LP <i>Mess Detective</i>) to major label Pop Artist. That theory doesn't scan too well, though, when you consider Flory's innate pop sense, as evinced by ""Never Know"" and the brazen, dizzying melodic spirals of ""Princess"". It's hard (although not entirely impossible) to imagine any label willing to stifle such a playfully accessible voice. Maybe he cracked under self-applied pressure; he told Tom Breihan in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38001-rising-primary-1/"" target=""_blank"">Rising interview</a> last year that the idea of creating something more tangibly coherent than his bedroom-pop collection <i>Mess Detective</i> was proving ""really, really difficult.""</p>
<p>Regardless of the hows and whys, <i>Other People</i> often feels as unexpectedly rush-jobbed as its release date. Front-to-back, the record feels disjointed and scattershot, as the ""hits""-- namely, ""Princess"" and ""Never Know"", as well as Flory's exquisite Bowie-esque collaboration with the Cardigans' Nina Persson, ""The Blues""-- are placed throughout the LP and tempered mostly with overcast mood pieces that verge on MOR-pop purgatory. These slower cuts sometimes work-- closing track ""Get Rope"", for example-- but otherwise they interrupt any chance at an even flow. The dirge-like ""Magic"" is anything but, and even a track like ""Swimming Pools"", which worked on <i>Mess Detectives</i> and fit more to that release's bedroom aesthetic, sounds quite out of place here.</p>
<p>We may never know what the problem was with <i>Other People</i>, but it's far from a disaster. As the title of the album's opening track suggests, it's an ""A-OK"" effort, and pop aesthetes will find a fair share to salvage before the whole thing disappears in a sinkhole of 1s and 0s. As ""final"" releases go, though, the whole thing is less of a disappearing act and more of a slow, hope-nobody-notices retreat. Whatever he does next-- if we do, in fact, hear from him again-- well, let's just hope he's got his nerve back by then.</p></div>"|15244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15244-other-people/|6.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

For all their reported bombast, pomp, and tendency to overshoot and double-slaughter any semblances of good taste, everything you've heard about them is still true.  They're one of the few phenomena who deliver on the hype, regardless of how you approach them.  Hate or love proggy album suites?  Doesn't matter, Queen will make you feel good about your choice.  Can't stand operatic drama, or can't get enough unitard-clad frontmen?  Love to hate prime 1970s hard rock with arena sheen?  Welcome to the greatest/most horrible band of the 20th century.  They did and wanted it all.  Yet, so much of Queen's music is still under-recognized even by people who know and love the hits.</p>
<p>Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara on the British colony of Zanzibar, East Africa), guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bassist John Deacon comprised one of the most successful, effective, and productive bands of the rock era-- indeed, by some estimates, the most successful rock band of all time (having spent more time atop the UK album charts than any other act).  And how did they do this?  With: a gay male lead singer who specialized in operatic vocals and classically classed piano playing; an insanely talented lead guitarist who may actually have been more valuable as a songwriter or quasi-orchestral arranger of his instrument; a drummer who not only possessed the highest vocal register in the band (and this is Queen we're talking
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
about), but also arguably the greatest songwriting range; a non-singing bassist who managed to pen one of the greatest karaoke anthems of all time, ""Another One Bites the Dust"".  Like the Beatles, Queen capitalized on major group synergy, and as a result, forged a career that was as varied and resourceful as any act in rock.</p>
<p>Queen formed in late 1970, when Mercury (late of art school) joined up with May and Taylor (late of the Cream-ish band Smile).  Deacon joined the following year, and the newly dubbed Queen played shows, rehearsed, and recorded their self-titled debut.  Though they had to wait a couple of years for a release, <i>Queen</i> is quite clearly the work of an assured group of young men.  May's album opener ""Keep Yourself Alive"" was an early anthem and showcase for his multi-tracked guitar.  It didn't really have the operatic flair of the band's later hits, but it was catchy, well-produced, and just ridiculously easy to fist-pump along to in concert.  Mercury-penned songs like ""Great King Rat"" and ""My Fairy King"" offered ample evidence where Queen's more precocious interests lie, though even then, the songs rocked way harder than their titles let on.  Indeed, a song like ""Son and Daughter"" is like the lovechild of Black Sabbath and Ziggy Stardust, taking the most potent attributes of both, and refusing to tone down anything in favor of a harmonious mix.  And they were just getting started.</p>
<p><i>Queen II</i>--<i> </i>the first of two albums they released in 1974-- was the mini-breakthrough.  Part of this was due to diving with abandon into recording experimentation, particularly the elaborate vocal and guitar overdubs that would soon become the band's trademarks.  May wrote most of the music for the album's ""Side White"": the stately (if modest by Queen standards) guitar prelude ""Procession"" leads directly into the still-statelier would-be rock anthem ""Father to Son"".  Sounding like a hippie-era group sing-along crammed face-first into murky, early-70s proto-metal, it's another good example of Queen's penchant for at least attempting to unite disparate musical worlds-- even if the end result was more than a bit bloated.</p>
<p>However, Mercury's ""Side Black"" was the masterstroke, and the first real evidence of the double-decker Fabergé egg that would become Queen's career on record.  ""Ogre Battle"" (a live holdover from the time of the first record) begins with a long, ominous fade into screeching vocal harmonies and flailing, backwards drums and guitars.  The song busts and tumbles its way into the ""The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke"",  a dry run for the kind of music-hall rock they'd perfect with the next album's ""Killer Queen"",  and which should probably win a few awards as the world's most apt Queen song title.  ""Nevermore"" is a piano and vocal ballad that nicely introduces the album's central epic (and direct ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" precursor) ""The March of the Black Queen"".  And the people noticed: The album produced a UK hit with a remake of the up-tempo gallop ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" from the debut.  Dizzying, overstuffed, and unflinching, <i>Queen II</i> is a die-hard fan favorite, and arguably the band's most underrated record.</p>
<p><i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> (also 1974) not only improves on every aspect of their sound suggested by the first two records, but delivers some of the finest music of their career.  First off, the band had mastered the recording studio.  Tracks like the hit ""Killer Queen"", ""In the Lap of the Gods"", and the hyper-vaudeville ""Bring Back That Leroy Brown"" simply could not have appeared on previous records due to the complexity of the arrangements, and the amazing job by the band and producer Roy Thomas Baker in getting umpteen dozens of overdubs and edits to sound like cohesive recordings.  And they rocked! ""Stone Cold Crazy"" predates speed-metal (and was eventually covered by Metallica), ""Brighton Rock"" was May's theretofore best guitar showcase, and for heaven's sake, ""In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited"" ends the album with an explosion.  Even Taylor's ""Tenement Funster"" (sample lyric: ""My new purple shoes been amazing the people next door"") and Deacon's bouncy ""Misfire"" bring good things to the table.  This is the band at the height of its powers.</p>
<p>After ""Killer Queen"" and <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i>, there was no looking back.  1975's <i>A Night at the Opera</i> was reportedly the most expensive album ever produced at the time, and even if the only thing you knew about it was that it contained ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", you'd have a pretty good idea of the kind of record to expect.  Yet the fun hardly stopped there: ""Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)"" was a heavy, hilarious kiss-off from Mercury to their former manager; ""Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon"" and ""Seaside Rendezvous"" were further entries into the band's vaudeville-rock canon; ""You're My Best Friend"" was Deacon's first big hit for Queen, while Taylor's ""I'm in Love With My Car"" was another good, slyly funny rocker.  And if you're still in need of fireworks, May's ""The Prophet's Song"" features an amazing solo-through-delay vocal performance from Mercury that eventually transforms into a call-response choir, and further still into one of May's best guitar solos.  No punches pulled, no expense spared: <i>A Night at the Opera</i> was Queen at the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, 1976's <i>A Day at the Races</i> feels a bit retread.  Even down to its Marx Brothers-derived title, the album doesn't retain the same quantum-leap progression from its predecessor as the ones had before.  Indeed ""The Millionaire Waltz"" borrows liberally from ""Bohemian Rhapsody""; classical piano playing, massive vocal overdubs, and a big rock breakdown-- but without much of the surprise or humor.  Rather, the best tracks here are the ones where Queen is willing to go outside of their already established template: ""You Take My Breath Away"" is one of Mercury's best ballads, sung without a trace of irony or camp, and a good example of the band's perhaps underrated abilities as songwriters.  ""Somebody to Love"" was the record's biggest hit, and positions Mercury as the gospel church soloist amidst walls of choral backdrop (i.e. him, May, and Taylor).  Taylor's ""Drowse"" is a hazily burnt (dare I say ""chill""?) piece of psychedelia that sounds unlike anything else in Queen's catalog-- and is yet another reminder of the power in the band's democratic songwriting ethos.</p>
<p>As much as any band, Queen commands the best audio quality money can buy, and these remasters sound great.  There are lots of new bonus tracks, live versions, and B-sides-- none of which are required listening but-- particularly in the cases of the <i>a cappella</i> vocal tracks for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Bring Back That Leroy Brown""-- are good fun for fans.  Furthermore, the <i>Deep Cuts: 1973-1976</i> disc is an admirable attempt to introduce some of Queen's non-hit album tracks to folks otherwise familiar only with the band's UK #1s (all 18 of them)-- though it contains nothing previously unreleased.  Still, bang for the buck has always been one of Queen's strong points: Jump in, be prepared for anything, and most of all, check your modesty at the door.</p></div>"|15221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15221-reissues/|6.7|Dominique Leone

For all their reported bombast, pomp, and tendency to overshoot and double-slaughter any semblances of good taste, everything you've heard about them is still true.  They're one of the few phenomena who deliver on the hype, regardless of how you approach them.  Hate or love proggy album suites?  Doesn't matter, Queen will make you feel good about your choice.  Can't stand operatic drama, or can't get enough unitard-clad frontmen?  Love to hate prime 1970s hard rock with arena sheen?  Welcome to the greatest/most horrible band of the 20th century.  They did and wanted it all.  Yet, so much of Queen's music is still under-recognized even by people who know and love the hits.</p>
<p>Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara on the British colony of Zanzibar, East Africa), guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bassist John Deacon comprised one of the most successful, effective, and productive bands of the rock era-- indeed, by some estimates, the most successful rock band of all time (having spent more time atop the UK album charts than any other act).  And how did they do this?  With: a gay male lead singer who specialized in operatic vocals and classically classed piano playing; an insanely talented lead guitarist who may actually have been more valuable as a songwriter or quasi-orchestral arranger of his instrument; a drummer who not only possessed the highest vocal register in the band (and this is Queen we're talking
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
about), but also arguably the greatest songwriting range; a non-singing bassist who managed to pen one of the greatest karaoke anthems of all time, ""Another One Bites the Dust"".  Like the Beatles, Queen capitalized on major group synergy, and as a result, forged a career that was as varied and resourceful as any act in rock.</p>
<p>Queen formed in late 1970, when Mercury (late of art school) joined up with May and Taylor (late of the Cream-ish band Smile).  Deacon joined the following year, and the newly dubbed Queen played shows, rehearsed, and recorded their self-titled debut.  Though they had to wait a couple of years for a release, <i>Queen</i> is quite clearly the work of an assured group of young men.  May's album opener ""Keep Yourself Alive"" was an early anthem and showcase for his multi-tracked guitar.  It didn't really have the operatic flair of the band's later hits, but it was catchy, well-produced, and just ridiculously easy to fist-pump along to in concert.  Mercury-penned songs like ""Great King Rat"" and ""My Fairy King"" offered ample evidence where Queen's more precocious interests lie, though even then, the songs rocked way harder than their titles let on.  Indeed, a song like ""Son and Daughter"" is like the lovechild of Black Sabbath and Ziggy Stardust, taking the most potent attributes of both, and refusing to tone down anything in favor of a harmonious mix.  And they were just getting started.</p>
<p><i>Queen II</i>--<i> </i>the first of two albums they released in 1974-- was the mini-breakthrough.  Part of this was due to diving with abandon into recording experimentation, particularly the elaborate vocal and guitar overdubs that would soon become the band's trademarks.  May wrote most of the music for the album's ""Side White"": the stately (if modest by Queen standards) guitar prelude ""Procession"" leads directly into the still-statelier would-be rock anthem ""Father to Son"".  Sounding like a hippie-era group sing-along crammed face-first into murky, early-70s proto-metal, it's another good example of Queen's penchant for at least attempting to unite disparate musical worlds-- even if the end result was more than a bit bloated.</p>
<p>However, Mercury's ""Side Black"" was the masterstroke, and the first real evidence of the double-decker Fabergé egg that would become Queen's career on record.  ""Ogre Battle"" (a live holdover from the time of the first record) begins with a long, ominous fade into screeching vocal harmonies and flailing, backwards drums and guitars.  The song busts and tumbles its way into the ""The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke"",  a dry run for the kind of music-hall rock they'd perfect with the next album's ""Killer Queen"",  and which should probably win a few awards as the world's most apt Queen song title.  ""Nevermore"" is a piano and vocal ballad that nicely introduces the album's central epic (and direct ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" precursor) ""The March of the Black Queen"".  And the people noticed: The album produced a UK hit with a remake of the up-tempo gallop ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" from the debut.  Dizzying, overstuffed, and unflinching, <i>Queen II</i> is a die-hard fan favorite, and arguably the band's most underrated record.</p>
<p><i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> (also 1974) not only improves on every aspect of their sound suggested by the first two records, but delivers some of the finest music of their career.  First off, the band had mastered the recording studio.  Tracks like the hit ""Killer Queen"", ""In the Lap of the Gods"", and the hyper-vaudeville ""Bring Back That Leroy Brown"" simply could not have appeared on previous records due to the complexity of the arrangements, and the amazing job by the band and producer Roy Thomas Baker in getting umpteen dozens of overdubs and edits to sound like cohesive recordings.  And they rocked! ""Stone Cold Crazy"" predates speed-metal (and was eventually covered by Metallica), ""Brighton Rock"" was May's theretofore best guitar showcase, and for heaven's sake, ""In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited"" ends the album with an explosion.  Even Taylor's ""Tenement Funster"" (sample lyric: ""My new purple shoes been amazing the people next door"") and Deacon's bouncy ""Misfire"" bring good things to the table.  This is the band at the height of its powers.</p>
<p>After ""Killer Queen"" and <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i>, there was no looking back.  1975's <i>A Night at the Opera</i> was reportedly the most expensive album ever produced at the time, and even if the only thing you knew about it was that it contained ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", you'd have a pretty good idea of the kind of record to expect.  Yet the fun hardly stopped there: ""Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)"" was a heavy, hilarious kiss-off from Mercury to their former manager; ""Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon"" and ""Seaside Rendezvous"" were further entries into the band's vaudeville-rock canon; ""You're My Best Friend"" was Deacon's first big hit for Queen, while Taylor's ""I'm in Love With My Car"" was another good, slyly funny rocker.  And if you're still in need of fireworks, May's ""The Prophet's Song"" features an amazing solo-through-delay vocal performance from Mercury that eventually transforms into a call-response choir, and further still into one of May's best guitar solos.  No punches pulled, no expense spared: <i>A Night at the Opera</i> was Queen at the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, 1976's <i>A Day at the Races</i> feels a bit retread.  Even down to its Marx Brothers-derived title, the album doesn't retain the same quantum-leap progression from its predecessor as the ones had before.  Indeed ""The Millionaire Waltz"" borrows liberally from ""Bohemian Rhapsody""; classical piano playing, massive vocal overdubs, and a big rock breakdown-- but without much of the surprise or humor.  Rather, the best tracks here are the ones where Queen is willing to go outside of their already established template: ""You Take My Breath Away"" is one of Mercury's best ballads, sung without a trace of irony or camp, and a good example of the band's perhaps underrated abilities as songwriters.  ""Somebody to Love"" was the record's biggest hit, and positions Mercury as the gospel church soloist amidst walls of choral backdrop (i.e. him, May, and Taylor).  Taylor's ""Drowse"" is a hazily burnt (dare I say ""chill""?) piece of psychedelia that sounds unlike anything else in Queen's catalog-- and is yet another reminder of the power in the band's democratic songwriting ethos.</p>
<p>As much as any band, Queen commands the best audio quality money can buy, and these remasters sound great.

Like the Beatles, Queen capitalized on major group synergy, and as a result, forged a career that was as varied and resourceful as any act in rock.</p>
<p>Queen formed in late 1970, when Mercury (late of art school) joined up with May and Taylor (late of the Cream-ish band Smile).  Deacon joined the following year, and the newly dubbed Queen played shows, rehearsed, and recorded their self-titled debut.  Though they had to wait a couple of years for a release, <i>Queen</i> is quite clearly the work of an assured group of young men.  May's album opener ""Keep Yourself Alive"" was an early anthem and showcase for his multi-tracked guitar.  It didn't really have the operatic flair of the band's later hits, but it was catchy, well-produced, and just ridiculously easy to fist-pump along to in concert.  Mercury-penned songs like ""Great King Rat"" and ""My Fairy King"" offered ample evidence where Queen's more precocious interests lie, though even then, the songs rocked way harder than their titles let on.  Indeed, a song like ""Son and Daughter"" is like the lovechild of Black Sabbath and Ziggy Stardust, taking the most potent attributes of both, and refusing to tone down anything in favor of a harmonious mix.  And they were just getting started.</p>
<p><i>Queen II</i>--<i> </i>the first of two albums they released in 1974-- was the mini-breakthrough.  Part of this was due to diving with abandon into recording experimentation, particularly the elaborate vocal and guitar overdubs that would soon become the band's trademarks.  May wrote most of the music for the album's ""Side White"": the stately (if modest by Queen standards) guitar prelude ""Procession"" leads directly into the still-statelier would-be rock anthem ""Father to Son"".  Sounding like a hippie-era group sing-along crammed face-first into murky, early-70s proto-metal, it's another good example of Queen's penchant for at least attempting to unite disparate musical worlds-- even if the end result was more than a bit bloated.</p>
<p>However, Mercury's ""Side Black"" was the masterstroke, and the first real evidence of the double-decker Fabergé egg that would become Queen's career on record.  ""Ogre Battle"" (a live holdover from the time of the first record) begins with a long, ominous fade into screeching vocal harmonies and flailing, backwards drums and guitars.  The song busts and tumbles its way into the ""The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke"",  a dry run for the kind of music-hall rock they'd perfect with the next album's ""Killer Queen"",  and which should probably win a few awards as the world's most apt Queen song title.  ""Nevermore"" is a piano and vocal ballad that nicely introduces the album's central epic (and direct ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" precursor) ""The March of the Black Queen"".  And the people noticed: The album produced a UK hit with a remake of the up-tempo gallop ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" from the debut.  Dizzying, overstuffed, and unflinching, <i>Queen II</i> is a die-hard fan favorite, and arguably the band's most underrated record.</p>
<p><i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> (also 1974) not only improves on every aspect of their sound suggested by the first two records, but delivers some of the finest music of their career.  First off, the band had mastered the recording studio.  Tracks like the hit ""Killer Queen"", ""In the Lap of the Gods"", and the hyper-vaudeville ""Bring Back That Leroy Brown"" simply could not have appeared on previous records due to the complexity of the arrangements, and the amazing job by the band and producer Roy Thomas Baker in getting umpteen dozens of overdubs and edits to sound like cohesive recordings.  And they rocked! ""Stone Cold Crazy"" predates speed-metal (and was eventually covered by Metallica), ""Brighton Rock"" was May's theretofore best guitar showcase, and for heaven's sake, ""In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited"" ends the album with an explosion.  Even Taylor's ""Tenement Funster"" (sample lyric: ""My new purple shoes been amazing the people next door"") and Deacon's bouncy ""Misfire"" bring good things to the table.  This is the band at the height of its powers.</p>
<p>After ""Killer Queen"" and <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i>, there was no looking back.  1975's <i>A Night at the Opera</i> was reportedly the most expensive album ever produced at the time, and even if the only thing you knew about it was that it contained ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", you'd have a pretty good idea of the kind of record to expect.  Yet the fun hardly stopped there: ""Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)"" was a heavy, hilarious kiss-off from Mercury to their former manager; ""Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon"" and ""Seaside Rendezvous"" were further entries into the band's vaudeville-rock canon; ""You're My Best Friend"" was Deacon's first big hit for Queen, while Taylor's ""I'm in Love With My Car"" was another good, slyly funny rocker.  And if you're still in need of fireworks, May's ""The Prophet's Song"" features an amazing solo-through-delay vocal performance from Mercury that eventually transforms into a call-response choir, and further still into one of May's best guitar solos.  No punches pulled, no expense spared: <i>A Night at the Opera</i> was Queen at the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, 1976's <i>A Day at the Races</i> feels a bit retread.  Even down to its Marx Brothers-derived title, the album doesn't retain the same quantum-leap progression from its predecessor as the ones had before.  Indeed ""The Millionaire Waltz"" borrows liberally from ""Bohemian Rhapsody""; classical piano playing, massive vocal overdubs, and a big rock breakdown-- but without much of the surprise or humor.  Rather, the best tracks here are the ones where Queen is willing to go outside of their already established template: ""You Take My Breath Away"" is one of Mercury's best ballads, sung without a trace of irony or camp, and a good example of the band's perhaps underrated abilities as songwriters.  ""Somebody to Love"" was the record's biggest hit, and positions Mercury as the gospel church soloist amidst walls of choral backdrop (i.e. him, May, and Taylor).  Taylor's ""Drowse"" is a hazily burnt (dare I say ""chill""?) piece of psychedelia that sounds unlike anything else in Queen's catalog-- and is yet another reminder of the power in the band's democratic songwriting ethos.</p>
<p>As much as any band, Queen commands the best audio quality money can buy, and these remasters sound great.  There are lots of new bonus tracks, live versions, and B-sides-- none of which are required listening but-- particularly in the cases of the <i>a cappella</i> vocal tracks for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Bring Back That Leroy Brown""-- are good fun for fans.  Furthermore, the <i>Deep Cuts: 1973-1976</i> disc is an admirable attempt to introduce some of Queen's non-hit album tracks to folks otherwise familiar only with the band's UK #1s (all 18 of them)-- though it contains nothing previously unreleased.  Still, bang for the buck has always been one of Queen's strong points: Jump in, be prepared for anything, and most of all, check your modesty at the door.</p></div>"|15221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15221-reissues/|7.0|Dominique Leone

The first is that Allien's recent, modest productions provide ample fodder for dance-oriented producers to work with, the originals aiming at a different effect. The less charitable interpretation notes that a far-flung, diverse cast of remixers had no trouble improving upon Allien's recent output. Wherever you come down, there's no denying that Allien-- still a prominent Berlin artist after all these years-- has really cool friends. The cast includes dedicated techno recluses (Kassem Mosse), sound architects (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>), genre veterans (Aux 88), and young upstarts (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"">Nicolas Jaar</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29324-we-love/"">We Love</a>).</p>
<p><i>Dust Remixes</i> feels a bit like an olive branch to electronic heads, as most of the material here appropriates Allien's originals in the service of Berlin-style club music, even if releasing them as an album-- rather than as a series of 12""s-- throws that utility into question. Most noticably, many of these remixes cultivate an air of suspense and momentum that Allien's increasingly relaxed productions lack. Where a track like ""My Tree"" moved in and out of focus on <i>Dust</i>, here it sustains its circular drum pattern and builds into a thwumping bass sequence. There are some truly inspired moments: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=john+roberts&amp;search_type=standard"">John Roberts</a> unbuttons his collar on ""Should We Go Home"", unleashing a spacey, jazzy synth line. Heretofore disappointing BPitch artists We Love turn ""Sun the Rain"" into gauzy, rocking electro. These treatments make Allien's originals seem quiet and reserved in comparison, even if they didn't need much help seeming that way.</p>
<p>Arguably the two largest names here, Jaar and Hecker, make a different kind of sense, as both have participated in the techno deconstructions to which Allien seems increasingly drawn. Jaar's track, more a cover version than a remix and one unable to imbue any tunefulness into <i>Dust</i>'s worst track, is one of his least inspired productions. Hecker sounds like Hecker, natch. Mosse's remix of ""Our Utopie""-- which sees him just taking the best, clubbiest section of the song and playing it for a long time-- is as lazy as it is funny.</p>
<p>I enjoyed <i>Dust</i> because it was a considered, veteran move that felt comfortable in its own skin (sometimes overly so), but I can't get away from the feeling that Allien is getting outhustled more often than not. <i>Remixes</i> ultimately isn't a great listen-- <i>Dust</i> hardly merited this sort of concentrated rethinking-- but its highs are significantly higher than those of <i>Dust</i>, and it confirms both how closely Allien remains tied to her techno roots as well as how curiously off-center her work has been.</p></div>"|15234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15234-dust-remixes/|6.3|Andrew Gaerig

Lustman is a stylistic nomad, but he rarely settles on just one scene or sound. While genre wonks will have no trouble cherrypicking the elements of Lustman's sound-- drum &amp; bass, dubstep, deep house, UK garage-- it's difficult to determine what basket any individual moment falls into. <i>You Stand Uncertain</i> is that rare album whose influences seem obvious and simultaneously difficult to pin down on any one given track.</p>
<p>The effect is sometimes schizophrenic: the best track on <i>Uncertain</i> is the last one, ""Waited Patiently"". It features an otherworldly low-end, jazzy piano chords, ratcheted, clacking snares, sampled soul vocals, and Lily McKenzie's decidedly more modern R&amp;B croon. In other words, it's genre signifier on top of genre signifier. All of this speaks to an urge to definitively label something that is neither necessary nor particularly healthy. But I would like to convey that <i>Uncertain</i> is both familiar and frustrating, possibly because Lustman's imagination sometimes outstrips his range, possibly because he so ably incorporates these sounds but owns them only infrequently.</p>
<p>Lustman's drums remain at the core of his sound; they are usually quick, often syncopated. They patter shallowly, never reaching down to punch you in the ribs. When this is paired with a female voice-- a frequent counterpoint for Lustman-- it effects a harsh, sour R&amp;B sound that can be both exciting and off-putting. I love the pacing of ""Brazil"", and I can lose myself in its patient urban blues, but the coiled, digitized diva blurts that punctuate the track snap me back to reality.</p>
<p>He seems in better control of these elements on <i>Uncertain</i> than he did on 2009's <i>Love Is a Liability</i>, pairing his percussion with richer keyboards amidst grander track design. (That the art of both albums features noir-y female snaps, with <i>Uncertain</i>'s color standing in contrast to <i>Love</i>'s black and white, is likely a happy coincidence.) <i>Uncertain</i> is idiosyncratic-- the geeky sci-fi splash of ""The Pacifist"", the wa-wa jazz of ""Eight Eighteen Ten""-- in ways that <i>Love</i> never was. Lustman is still searching for a unique personality, but he seems more assured and focused here than on previous releases.</p>
<p><i>You Stand Uncertain</i> is just too perfect a title for this album. It feels fresh and invigorated when it's spinning, reassuringly foreboding like a cinematic thriller playing to script. Afterwards I remember very little. There isn't a single track here that could feature in a mix or a DJ set. Lustman's clacking, clacking, clacking snares are the closest thing he has to a calling card. The album as a whole isn't quite able to leverage that into a recognizable aesthetic, but it comes tantalizingly close.</p></div>"|15243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15243-you-stand-uncertain/|6.9|Andrew Gaerig

Unfortunately, very few artists were able to actually get it together enough to make that concept a reality, and most of it just sounded kind of watery and half-assed. Hard Mix, aka the South Carolina-based Noah Smith, released the appropriately titled single ""Memories"" in July, as chillwave was gasping its last breath. But instead of emulating what came before, he made good on the genre's promise, finding a direction in a fuzzy, kind-hearted pulse and confident, direct drums.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Default</i>s, the debut LP from Smith, was recently released for free online to little fanfare. Which is too bad, because it's a smart, modest record that reveals itself only on repeated listens. ""Memories"" is still the centerpiece, and its vocal hiccups repeat themselves throughout the record. At points, though, this becomes repetitive. ""I'm Gone"" immediately follows ""Memories"" and they may as well be one extended track. In more experienced hands, this could be a good thing: repetition and multiple movements with slight variations are the building blocks of great dance music, but the details are lost here. ""Memories"" worked so well on its own, there's no need to expand on its basic premise.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the decision to give <i>Defaults</i> away for free online both helps and hurts the record. It's clearly a work that Smith labored over, but also one that doesn't show his full potential. It's immediately marginalized by its sanctioned accessibility, and could very well go unnoticed. However, Hard Mix is still a new artist with a ways to go before he's able to transition from the world of flash-in-the-pan blog hype to something more. By continuing to do what the rest of the scene around him failed to do, he has a chance to transcend being pigeonholed and shift into a whole new space where being innovative doesn't necessarily mean pushing boundaries. If the bright moments on <i>Defaults</i> say anything, it's that Hard Mix has it in him to make a dance record worth reminiscing about.</p></div>"|15250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15250-defaults/|7.2|Sam Hockley-Smith

Just what happened between <i>Little Eyes</i> and 1984's <i>Imperfiction</i> is a bit unclear; lots of wandering, some painting, and little in the way of music-making. Still, the gravity of those years echoes in Askew's throat as he sings his way through the brittle, haunted <i>Imperfiction</i>, the rare lost album that genuinely feels adrift.</p>
<p>Highpoint ""At Home in the Factory"" begins with ""international insanity"" and ends with Askew trailing off in a string of la-la-las. In between, Askew makes his case for the healing power of song, a recurring theme throughout <i>Imperfiction</i>; later, Askew reminds a companion that, if nothing else, ""the music and we are real,"" and it's <i>Imperfiction</i>'s most strikingly delivered line, almost as though Askew needed the reassurance himself. Though his melodies are clear and strong-- if a tad similar on the longer ballads--  the shakiness in Askew's voice turns these ponderances into bracing little koans. There's an exposed-nerve quality to the way Askew sings these <i>Imperfiction</i> songs that calls to mind Daniel Johnston, although in 1984 it's unlikely the two had heard each other's work. Many of Askew's tunes, like Johnson's, concern themselves with navigating the day at hand: writing songs, drinking tea, meeting dudes. There's a grasping at normalcy, a sense of a routine being rebuilt; there's something in his past forever weighing on his present, and it colors even his most assured-sounding material.</p>
<p>Askew laid down <i>Imperfiction</i> on a two-track recorder armed with just a harpsichord, harmonica, a tiple-- his favored instrument, a sort of short-necked 10-string acoustic guitar-- and his voice. The pairing of all that frail instrumental treble, Askew's prickly, just-behind-the-beat singing, and his weirdly regal tumble-out melodies gives <i>Imperfiction</i> a richness that does well by its underlying fragility. ""Tom"" is little more than the story of Askew meeting a beautiful dude and sparking a doob, yet the loping, grand melody and the way Askew vehemently exhales every word suggests that this Tom guy was really songworthy. For all of <i>Ask the Unicorn</i>'s hippy dippy forthrightness, there's an inscrutability to the record's psychonautics all but absent on the almost startlingly literal <i>Imperfiction</i>. Askew listens to blues records, watches the rain fall on broken glass, reminisces, drinks a lot; these moments of everyday intimacy give <i>Imperfiction</i> the feel of a rambling barroom catchup with a long-lost friend. Askew starts <i>Imperfiction</i> singing tentatively, picking out melodies almost cautiously; by the end, he's singing devotionals to Jesus and Buddha, mulling over ""Art and Life"", fingers stiff against the harpsichord. ""What can you do in a crazy world?"" he asks in ""At Home in the Factory"". His answer? ""Write a song, sing it well, la-la-la.""</p></div>"|15248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15248-imperfiction/|7.4|Paul Thompson

In the 20 years since the first Organized Konfusion album he's fathered numerous styles; without the precedent of his sharp, needling, Ornette Coleman-solo flow and the triple-reinforced polysyllabic depth it delivered, there's arguably no Mos Def, probably no Eminem, and definitely no army of complicated indie-rap spitters elbowing each other in a crowded post-Scribble Jam strata. And despite the huge hitch in his career arc-- eight years between his 1999 solo debut <i>Internal Affairs </i>and his excellent 2007 comeback <i>Desire</i>-- he always seemed like each dispatch from the studio could erase the aftereffects of his protracted absence.</p>
<p>But name me one MC, no matter how great, who hasn't slipped at least a little a full two decades after his debut-- either through wasted potential, desperate compromise, or just a disinterest in moving with the times. The latter method does have the benefit of being backed by a certain amount of personal integrity, and if the worst-case result involves preaching to a choir, at least it's an honest kind of letdown. <i>W.A.R. (We Are Renegades) </i>isn't the kind of disappointment that's liable to piss off hardcore fans. Even if Monch has moments where he sounds less like a battle-scarred vet and more like your cranky dad-- ""young children, pull your pants on up/ Who wants to see the crack of your ass and see your butt,"" he harangues on ""Let My People Go""-- at least he works with material that fits the continuum of his conscious-minded career. Of course a pushing-40 golden age icon is going to spit about the familiar subjects of record industry disillusionment, conspiracy politics, and the tragedy of street violence. Why shouldn't he-- or anybody?</p>
<p>The only catch is that this is the same golden age icon that previously did so on tracks like ""Free"", ""Releasing Hypnotical Gases"", and ""Stray Bullet"", which is about as close to unfuckwithable as an antecedent can get. More than anything else, precedent is what stifles <i>W.A.R.</i> And in comparison to the tracks that made him who he is, here Monch sometimes sounds more like the semi-inspired 2nd-gen backpacker disciples he anticipated than the fired-up elder statesman who was still close to peak as recently as three years ago. There's still bursts of press-rewind brilliance-- ""Haile Selassie Karate"" is a condensed dose of high-density abstraction, and his verse on ""Assassins"", the second of three co-featuring the equally top-of-their-game Jean Grae and Royce da 5'9"", is Monch in classic tongue-twister form. You don't have to go back to <i>Desire </i>to find a performance to unfavorably compare some of <i>W.A.R.</i>'s low points to-- there's more than a few flashes of sharpness here already.</p>
<p>But there's also bars that lean on more workaday lyrics, some of which are relatable and low-key (the matter-of-fact hood-struggle scenario ""Black Hand Side"") but often replace his look-that-up depth with hey-get-it metaphorical handholding. And hearing him drop a throwaway Laffy Taffy-wrapper punchline like ""I make headlines like corduroy pillows"" on the otherwise gripping ""The Hitman"" is damn near cringeworthy. The bulk of his lyrics aren't deliberately dumbed down or diluted to appeal to an audience that was never willing to get him, but sometimes they lack the weight that first hooked the audience that always has been.</p>
<p>That leaves his delivery to pick up the slack, and at least there he's still game-- the agile rhythmic snap of nunchuks whizzing past your head, all staccato internals and punchy alliteration. There's one point in the pulpit-delivery ""Let My People Go"" where he gets so into the sing-song preacher meter that he séances up hints of mid-90s Cee-Lo in his voice, and while it's one of the few moments where he gets flat-out transformative, his sense of interplay with the beat on the rest of the album is still enough to keep you listening even without his lyrics at their highest caliber. Seeing as how anonymous most of the production is, it's good to hear vocals that can carry the backing tracks; when the biggest sonic imprint on your album would otherwise be some Vernon Reid riffage, a few serviceable beats from M-Phazes and an overambitious <i>In the Court of the Crimson King</i>-interpolating collaboration with Citizen Cope, an MC as musically integral as Monch is absolutely necessary. If you value the merits of a singular flow, then what Monch does on this album can redeem nearly anything. Or at least make something likable out of an album that could've been just mediocre.</p></div>"|15193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15193-war/|6.5|Nate Patrin

In all of these songs, Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim, and their composer Davin Wood display a jingle writer's knack for melody, packing absurd humor into compact, ruthlessly effective hooks.</p>
<p><i>Starting From Nowhere</i>, an album of new music by Heidecker and Wood, takes their musical collaboration in a different direction. Heidecker's deep fascination with tacky 1970s and 80s aesthetics is foregrounded in a set of songs that strive to evoke the sound and feeling of vintage soft rock, but the comedy is dialed down considerably, to the point that many of the tracks barely register as comedy.</p>
<p>For example, the opening track ""Cross Country Skiing"" is such a close approximation of earnest, gently harmonized folk pop that if it appeared on a new Fleet Foxes record, you would just take it as a given that Robin Pecknold enjoys winter sports. Other tracks are spot-on pastiches of Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers, Jackson Browne, and the Eagles. The lyrics are often ridiculous, but even the silliest moments could pass as sincere if you didn't know anything about Heidecker's comedy career. If there is a joke here, it's that this music sounds like what it sounds like.</p>
<p>The thing is, all of the songs on <i>Starting From Nowhere</i> are written and executed with far too much precision and care to come off like a shallow mockery of soft rock. (Like, say, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMTI8vg7A5U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Yacht Rock</i></a>.) Heidecker and Wood may be connoisseurs of kitsch, but they obviously love this music. The sophistication and detail on display here is rather stunning; you just can't arrive at pastiche with this kind of accuracy without genuine obsession.</p>
<p>But without funny jokes, what exactly is the point of this album? Cut-out bins around the world overflow with music that sounds exactly like the contents of <i>Starting From Nowhere</i>. Indie bands such as Belle &amp; Sebastian and Destroyer filter these sounds through the sensibilities of distinct, modern songwriters. Wood may nail the aesthetics of a particular era, but that high level of competency isn't the same thing as writing great songs. This is ultimately mediocre music that sometimes recalls the sound and feeling of excellent music, and the only thing that Heidecker brings to the table is a smirking irony that is not particularly appealing when separated from hilarious comedy. If you genuinely want to listen to this kind of music, you're better off with the real deal. (In particular, investigate Steely Dan's back catalog-- their slick, jazz-influenced rock has a darker, dryer wit than anything Heidecker can manage on this album.) If you want excellent novelty pop, cross your fingers for another season of ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!""</p></div>"|15238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15238-starting-from-nowhere/|4.5|Matthew Perpetua

When she released her first LP, <i>Little Window</i>, she was already in her late forties, and her biography read like a Tom Waits song. According to <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17940655"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a story she told NPR</a>, she fell in love with the harp at age four after discovering the one inside an upright piano during a neighborhood piano-smashing party. Later, she often played harp in Central Park while wearing a bear costume. She had stints as a church organist and a Coney Island sideshow. Her music is an equally paradoxical blend of spiritual uplift and tin-megaphone banter.</p>
<p>The transition from street artist to professional has been gradual. By 2008's <i>Safe Inside the Day</i>, she'd learned how to make a commercial album, and her signature harp and accordion gave way to grand piano-- a more typical and versatile foundation. With her remarkable life experience now paired with recording practice, Baby Dee has made her best album yet just a couple of years shy of her 60th birthday. Idiosyncratic but ruggedly classic, <i>Regifted Light</i> is old-fashioned art music with a sheen of downtown grit. Dee caresses and pounds producer Andrew WK's <a href=""http://www.steinway.com/pianos/steinway/grand/model-d/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steinway D</a> to life with the lyrical bluster of Gershwin and the <a href=""http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/08/12/arts/1247468480469/happy-birthday-stephen-sondheim.html?ref=music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nimble thematic development of Sondheim</a>. It's a welcome change of pace from the post-minimalism that's rampant in indie piano music.</p>
<p>Opening instrumental ""Cowboys With Cowboy Hat Hair"" establishes the album's harmonic environment, making this more of a song cycle than a collection of individual pieces. Over martial snares, Dee works a theme from the C Minor scale-- light on the sharps as to lean it toward bright C Major-- up and down the keyboard. The theme rolls back and forth on itself and fractures across different octaves in odd places so that lone high notes ring out ornamentally. <i>Regifted Light</i> never strays too far from this tonal vicinity, which creates a unified wistfulness that Dee articulates in every shade from happy to sad. The diversity arises from Dee's inspired handling of the shallow pool of intervals-- you never know which way the themes will veer next, into upper-register dances or lower-register thunder-- and is abetted by conversational accompaniment for bassoon, cello, and glockenspiel.</p>
<p>Dee has an incredible voice that has drawn unavoidable comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony Hegarty</a>'s. In fact, it is more unusual than Antony's, and more inclined toward musical theater. A little of it goes a long way, which is why it works so well appearing on just four of the 12 songs here. The scarcity gives it an outsized, mythic quality. Dee suddenly appears, utters wisdom or metaphysical fables, and vanishes into the music again. Within a single line, her voice flickers through not just different emotions, but personalities.</p>
<p>""The moon is my redeemer/ The moon is my befriending Jesus,"" Dee drawls on the title track, merging pagan and monotheistic traditions into a sense of human tenderness that overarches eons. The notion that with each ""regifting"" of the light, its ""gentleness increases"" could sound forced and trite in a different context, but in Dee's hands it feels at-ease and hard-won. ""Brother Slug and Sister Snail"" is a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"">Joanna Newsom</a>-like animal allegory where Jesus sings from the cross, ""I am a worm and not... a... <i>MAN</i>!"" But nobody hears him. The narrative topology is strange, but not for strangeness' sake: The elegant music bends it toward profundity.</p>
<p>Baby Dee tends to get written about with words like ""flamboyant"" and ""campy,"" and ""The Pie Song"" demonstrates why: Dee bashes out mad-composer chords while demanding pie with the indefinable undercurrent of menace minted by the <a href=""http://www.thefrogsarchive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Frogs</a>. While ""The Pie Song"" is not representative of <i>Regifted Light</i>, those who want to hear the album as camp will do so, despite the fact that Dee's theatrics have been scaled back, and at any rate are not campy but piercingly sincere. The camp pigeonhole is always difficult for transgender artists to avoid in the mainstream. But Dee is simply a musician making very earnest art about a very unusual life. <i>Regifted Light</i> doesn't seem built to shock or cajole, but to connect with all sorts of people, and to last.</p></div>"|15240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15240-regifted-light/|8.0|Brian Howe

The band's amoebic, sun-speckled concoctions are decidedly psychedelic; these guys do an eight-and-a-half-minute song called ""Marshmellow Yellow"", after all. But the band's sophomore record, <i>936</i>, is less structurally ambiguous than it appears: If you can resist getting totally stranded in its opiate-friendly atmospheres, the joys of <i>936</i> are easy to pin down.</p>
<p>Peaking Lights work like a kaleidoscope, and not only because their music is so richly colored and fluid. The basic patterns are laid out right in front of you-- catchy drum loops, loping bass rhythms, oily groove patterns-- while the smaller, stranger details in your periphery help tie everything together. Take ""Birds of Paradise (Dub Version)"", a song that best characterizes Peaking Lights' M.O. Aaron Coyes lets the clunky drums and bass line anchor the song neatly, while Indra Dunis provides some bewitching, hymn-like vocals. The rest is wonderfully detailed, as Spaghetti Western guitars, reverb, and curious spurts of keyboard drift by. There's no need to clutter the song with extraneous patches of noise, no need to overstimulate. Peaking Lights make sure everything is carefully plucked, arranged delicately, and given room to breathe, with the groove handling the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>For fans of psych-journeyman Sun Araw's collages, this might all sound pretty familiar. Peaking Lights are certainly close contemporaries, but the differences are crucial and indicative of their interest in fostering a subtler, more romantic feel. The fact that the band hails from Wisconsin is puzzling; while components of some of these songs sound downright arid and lost, a lot of <i>936</i> produces a tingle only a vitamin D-rich bath of sunlight can offer. <i>936</i> isn't necessarily a record you might consider tucking in your beach bag-- it's likely too alien and too narcotized (all of this depending on where you're vacationing, of course). But considering that so much of this crackled, psych-drenched dub coming in from the West Coast feels so damn heavy, the lightness of Peaking Lights makes for a surprisingly luminous listen.</p></div>"|15216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15216-936/|7.7|Zach Kelly

Once the song starts proper, however, this UK quintet brings to mind punks of a different vintage.  Their melodically strident vocals are the stuff of every great Buzzcocks single, while the judiciously used (and skillfully deployed) brass section seems to have been pulled straight out of Paul Weller's bag of tricks.  The less said about the lyrics the better-- it'd be hard to sneak a ""silly cow"" rhyme through the middle of a verse, let alone the chorus-- but as first impressions go, this track isn't half bad.  Unfortunately, about half of <i>Space on Tuesday </i>has a different feel.</p>
<p>A rule of thumb if you navigate this album: <span>If you hear horns kick off a track, then you're in good hands.  The better part of </span><i>Space on Tuesday</i><span> features tunes that wholeheartedly explore the R&amp;B/pop vibes that the brass section on ""Silly Cow"" only hints at.  Imagine Pete Shelley taking Elvis Costello's Attractions for a Motown-styled spin, and you'll have some idea what ""Indigo Skies"" sounds like.  ""Love, Love, Love"" and ""Mary"" go even farther back with their retro homages, while the synthy sparkles and blown-out sax action (think ""Dancing in the Dark"" or ""Maneater"") place ""Stay"" squarely in an 80s milieu.  The sentiments expressed in these songs might seem simplistic or too straight-faced, but the musicianship brought to bear ably compensates any shortcomings.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, the group's other attempts to unabashedly rock out on </span><i>Space on Tuesday </i><span>aren't quite as successful.  There's a haughty self-importance that seems to infect Leika whenever they decide to make with any sort of overt rock-like maneuvers.  These grand gestures come in two flavors: Either there's
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
some grave existential injustice that needs to be vaguely addressed, or there's a need to show off the guitarist's chops.  As a result, either the music exchanges its energetic and joyous swagger for a numbing stiffness (as on ""Fake Mission to Mars""), or the need to say big important things via AABB rhyme schemes trumps the need to make a song enjoyable. (The hyper-earnest babble on ""Shrunken Heads"" is the main offender there.) </span><span>And then there is ""Sitting Pretty"", which manages to stick its feet in both of these buckets.  During most of </span><i>Space on Tuesday</i><span>, the album actually alternates between these two types of songs, as if a shameless fun-loving Jekyll is forced to ground by a portentously pompous Hyde.  I don't doubt that, if given a chance, these folks will find a way to reconcile these two conflicting impulses.  However, as </span><i>Space on Tuesday </i><span>shows time and again, there's work to do before that can happen.</span></p></div>"|15217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15217-space-on-tuesday/|5.3|David Raposa

The two make quite a pair; young Roberts looks a bit like  Turner did when we first met him and the Arctic Monkeys five years ago. But Turner's not a young man anymore, and over  the years, the the cynical smirk with which he greeted everything on those early Arctics records has threatened to turn to a scowl. On title alone, the forthcoming Arctic Monkeys album <i>Suck It and See</i> doesn't offer much confidence that above-it-all hasn't finally given way to fuck-it-all. But the songs he's written for <i>Submarine-- </i>the story of 15-year-old Roberts navigating the cusp of manhood-- find Turner sounding more revived, more assured, and in a sense, more himself than he has for some time.</p>
<p><i>Submarine</i> collects five and a half new Turner songs-- a few lilting ballads with minimal adornment, and a couple of mid-tempo pop tunes often calling to mind the spare, stately beauty of Turner's countryman Richard Hawley. It's a brief, fairly unassuming set, pulling back on both the Monkeys' linguistic barrage and the symphonic flourishes that Turner and Miles Kane deploy in the Last Shadow Puppets. He's long been an ace at the narrative lyric, unspooling yarns into tangled, cutting slices-of-life. But with the film providing the storyline, Turner's lyrics tend toward impressionistic details and wallflower observations, filling in the picture rather than trying to retell the script in song. Though some of these stray lines can feel a bit adrift without a plot, Turner's keen wit and eye for detail coalesces into a tender portrayal of that resolute adolescent uncertainty, of figuring things out as they go.</p>
<p>Highlight ""Hiding Tonight"" succinctly captures that uniquely teenage feeling that tomorrow is bound to be transformative, so worry can wait. ""Glass in the Park"" sounds like a lazy afternoon between two young lovers, whispering impossibly grand promises to each other. ""It's Hard to Get Around the Wind"" is a touch more inscrutable, a Dylanesque puzzler that touches on desert spoons, X-Men pinball, and coming to terms with fate. Here, the images get a bit tough to follow line for line, but the overarching notion that we're forced to accept some things we don't understand comes through clearly enough. ""Stuck on the Puzzle"" is the set's most musically straightforward track, with a fuller sound bolstered by psych-pop flourishes. Closer ""Piledriver Waltz"" tells an odd tale of breakfast at the Heartbreak Hotel and reminding someone, ""If you're gonna try to walk on water, make sure to wear your comfortable shoes."" ""Waltz,"" which Turner intends to revive on <i>Suck It</i>, proves the set's  lone dip in quality; its parade of images is a tad too clarity averse,  although it gets by on the constant motion of its melody.</p>
<p>Matched to this sophisticated, admirably restrained music, Turner's <i> Submarine</i> songs have a backwards-looking quality, a guy who's been  through it calmly reexamining the scars and renavigating the pitfalls.  In playing up the contradictions of youth without being cloying about  the real feelings behind them, Turner's songs feel sharply observed and  very true-to-life, even at their most lyrically impenetrable. Far from  the weariness at the center of <i>Humbug</i> and the early <i>Suck It</i> songs, <i> Submarine</i>'s rich, reminiscent tone finds Turner sounding very much at  ease with himself and his talents, offering a swift but satisfying  glimpse at that same charming, circumspect young man we knew back when.</p></div>"|15224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15224-submarine-ost/|7.6|Paul Thompson

The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11176-colorloss-record-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Colorless Record</i></a> EP from 2008 reorganized those huge, crumbling drone-chords on a spindle of obscure psych-pop covers, making the sound less abstract while remaining a glorious ruin. With<i> Common Era</i>, the new album from the New Orleans duo of Turk Dietrich and Michael Jones, an evolutionary timeline emerges.</p>
<p>The band's development began in the primordial muck on <i>October</i>, leapfrogged to the 1960s with <i>Colorless</i>, and now lands with one foot in the krautrock of the 1970s and the other in the shoegaze/post-punk of the 1980s. (Let's hope that next, they pass over their grunge record and skip right to dubstep.) This is Belong's least mysterious album by far, with a greater emphasis on vocals, perceptibly changing chords, and rock rhythms. They used to sound like Tim Hecker having a dream about <a href=""http://aprilskies.amniisia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JAMC</a>, <a href=""http://www.mybloodyvalentine.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, or even <a href=""http://joydivision.homestead.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>. Now they evoke such acts much more directly, as well as the distantly thundering drums of <a href=""http://www.spoonrecords.com/history.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Can</a> at their most elemental. Those drums especially temper Belong's sublime omnipresence, and their music comes to sound flattened here.</p>
<p>Belong often do a great job of separating these key influences from their unique style, but it feels like too much of a genre exercise to maintain album-length interest. Opener ""Come See"" is a tour de force of reconstituted krautrock: A gale of melody-drenched distortion and interference twists around a sinewy bass and drum figure. Sustained chords fall through one another to the sound of rending metal. Elongated vocals pull back against the pulse, and it's all capped by a stuttering feedback solo. The song is so comprehensive in its homage and mighty in its execution that it renders the rest of the album somewhat redundant, as Belong continue to mine the same vein with diminishing returns.</p>
<p>The dark synth-pop mood of ""Never Came Close"" should make for a change of pace, but Belong's murkiness obscures songwriterly differences, emphasizing instead a sameness of surface: muffled voices and broad strokes of glittering melody. The song's endlessly echoing snare also illustrates how limp their version of the motorik pulse can feel; it actually drains tension from the music. It's not that there isn't cool stuff here after the first track-- the curling bass line and stately progression of ""A Walk"" make it sound favorably like a chillwave M83, and its opening flourish is especially neat. But ""neat"" is where <i>Common Era</i> seems to stop. Most of the songs are solid, with the possible exception of the slackened ""Keep Still"", but none after the first has much capacity to surprise us or deepen the palette.</p></div>"|15235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15235-common-era/|5.9|Brian Howe

Until vocalist David Lemoine starts spitting out the lyrics, though, Cheveu's version sounds more like a <i>Pee-Wee's Playhouse </i>outtake than a faux-ghetto ""Under Pressure""<i>. </i>He doesn't fight the beat so much as belly-flop on top of it, his nasal vocals doing their damnedest not to sync up with the backing track's stiff and chintzy rhythm.</p>
<p><i>1000</i> is only the group's second proper album but this sort of odd musical digression seems to be a Cheveu staple. For their debut, the group took a simpering, sex-fixated Philip Seymour Hoffman monologue from Todd Solondz's <i>Happiness</i> and set it to grocery-shopping Muzak, with Lemoine offering a scarily accurate PSH impersonation. While Cheveu's music can be described as ""odd"" even at its most approachable, these tracks push the envelope further than required. That said, if this sort of taste-flaunting exhibition is necessary for Cheveu to produce the mind-boggling, post-everything music they're good at making, then it's a small price to pay.</p>
<p>In a genre where the word ""angular"" is used with alarming frequency, Cheveu's take on post-punk is obtuse in the best possible sense. When not setting fire to pop-rap or psychosexual film dialog, these frenetic Frenchmen take their sonic and spiritual cues from all sorts of musical pranksters: fellow countrymen and proto-industrial noiseniks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11785-anarchy-in-paris-tokio-airport/"">Metal Urbain</a>, British New Wave chuckleheads <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bigflamemcr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bIG fLAME</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/masoncitywidow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Family Fodder</a>, and even good ol' American Captain Beefheart. Calling Cheveu eccentric only scratches their idiosyncratic surface. There's the eerily prophetic ""Charlie Sheen"", a track whose flip-flopping between loping synth tones and digital hardcore breakdowns mirrors the actor's current manic state. There's ""Sensual Drug Abuse"", a spoken-word/rap on the titular subject set over chiming hip-hop groove burbles. There's ""Impossible Is Not French"", in which an Iggy-Poppish Lemoine repeatedly sneers variations on the lyric, ""French know how to do what you don't know what to do,"" through his usual pedal-distorted setup. Nothing from Cheveu sounds quite like anything else, but there's no mistaking who's making this noise.</p>
<p>And then there's the string section. While touring Israel in early 2010, Cheveu spent some studio time recording shockingly normal-sounding string arrangements with composer Maya Dunietz. If you're wondering how Cheveu feel about this surprising development, check out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94jzOKivMKQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their 90-second Israel travelogue</a> on YouTube. What's even more surprising is how well these cultured bits of music fit into Cheveu's distinctively uncultured songs. On <i>1000</i>'s<i> </i>lead-off track, ""Quattro Stagioni"", the strings add an air of stately elegance to the tune's spy-movie milieu. For ""No Birds"", their measured swooning provides a grounded counterpoint to the song's ramshackle textures. And on the Middle-Eastern-flavored ""Bonne Nuit Cheri"", they join forces with an economy-sized hallelujah chorus to provide a oddly stirring end to this beautiful mess of an album. I'd hesitate to say that <i>1000 </i>is proof that Cheveu are ""growing up,"" but if their songwriting chops can mature enough to make room for honest-to-goodness orchestration and equally honest emotion, there's no telling what sort of trouble they'll get themselves into.</p></div>"|15237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15237-1000/|7.5|David Raposa

Lowe, pub rock pioneer, is trying to express just how much everyman gloom and despair plays a part in his songwriting, going so far as to compare himself to ""Joe Blow,"" the guy who delivers the milk. ""I supposedly write the theme music for 'Coronation Street', for life,"" he says. ""That's what I set myself up to do."" Edmunds isn't having it. The Welsh rocker lets his friend know that a) he doesn't have anything at all in common with Joe Blow; and b) he thinks what Lowe just said is ""stupid, really stupid."" Lowe replies with the sort of twinkling deadpan that's defined so much of his pop music: ""That's why I think you and me are friends.""</p>
<p>It's a great scene captured during the making of a great album. Lowe and Edmunds had become friends a few years earlier, when the latter, a guitar-wielding, rock'n'roll purist from Cardiff, helped produce 1974's <i>The New Favourites of Brinsley Schwarz</i>, the final album from Lowe's legendary pub-rocking outfit. After that band dissolved, Lowe also took to production (nicknamed ""Basher,"" he helped shape the roughly-hewn sounds of Elvis Costello's first five LPs as well as the debut from pop-punk blueprinters the Damned) and joined up with Rockpile, Edmunds' tireless touring band. That's who we hear behind him in <i>Labour of Lust</i>, his follow-up to solo debut/masterpiece, 1978's <i>Jesus of Cool</i>. Out-of-print since its last CD run in 1990, it's an album far more cohesive and contained than its eclectic, bursting-at-the-seams predecessor. What it lacks in variety or ragged kineticism, it makes up for in the kind of thorough, clock-punching craftsmanship you'd expect from a guy who sees some of himself in a milkman.</p>
<p>And Rockpile-- what a perfect name for a rock band. Though Yep Roc's re-mastered re-issue of <i>Labour of Lust</i> doesn't include a DVD of ""Born Fighters"", it does a fine job of highlighting the many muscular moving parts of Lowe's songwriting at the time, as they were bashed out by professionals just like those Lowe describes in the hard-charging song of the same name. A bassist, he insisted that every one of his songs rely on rhythm first. So whether it's the devilish basslines of ""Big Kick, Plain Scrap"" or the galloping snap of Terry Williams' drumwork in opener ""Cruel to Be Kind"", a converted Brinsley Schwarz song and Lowe's lone U.S. chart hit, the foundational tracks sound golden in mp3 or vinyl format. The latter is pure pop and pure Lowe, a typically self-deprecating gem whose vocal hook is inescapable. Even more satisfying is ""American Squirm"", a sweeter number that features a spritely Costello on back-up vocals. Layer by layer, it showcases even further that Lowe was as sharp a producer as he was a songwriter. There's as much warmth as there is punch.</p>
<p>Both lyrically and sonically, you'll find a lot of that again from top to bottom, the Dire Straits-alluding ""Cracking Up"" or coal-miner's ache of ""Endless Grey Ribbon"" being two fine examples. Yep Roc didn't go overboard in the way of (often) unnecessary extra material, a decision that befits the no-nonsense feel of the record itself. The quiet bonus B-side ""Basing Street"" is a country-inflected folk number that hints at Lowe's later work, but was rightly left off the original playlist, if only because there's enough of that to chew on as is. At the halfway mark rests ""You Make Me"", a similarly hushed love tune in which Lowe is alone with just a guitar and some reverb. It's short and plain and startling in its vulnerability. But the crackle of the original recording is still there. It's not hard to imagine Lowe putting up a fight to keep it that way.</p></div>"|15236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15236-labour-of-lust/|8.4|David Bevan

After all, the <i>Wire </i>article that gave the movement one of its names-- ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Weird_America"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New Weird America</a>""-- was centered on the Brattleboro Free Folk Festival that Tower helped run. And the band ended shortly after, so anyone just starting to notice had nothing new to tout. Still, as New Weird America morphed into freak-folk and people like Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom got more attention, talk of Tower Recordings seemed too rare given their influence and significance.</p>
<p>No need to feel bad for them, though-- it's doubtful that they cared much about fame, and besides, band members have been too busy with subsequent projects to worry about it. The wandering journeys of Matt Valentine and Erika Elder (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26648-mv-ee/"">MV &amp; EE</a>), the reverent folk of Patrick Gubler (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4075-pg-six/"">P.G. Six</a>), and the haunting pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2618-samara-lubelski/"">Samara Lubelski</a> have all expanded the Tower sound, showing how inimitable and durable it is. Maybe people were hesitant to compare Tower to their descendants out of respect.</p>
<p>The growth continues with Metal Mountains, which includes Gubler and Lubelski but is led by Helen Rush in her first significant musical activity since Tower dissolved. Given a chance to stretch her mesmerizing voice across half an hour of material, she guides the music like a soft wind swirling a cloud. Every sound echoes, reverberates, and lingers, making <i>Golden Trees </i>practically nothing but atmosphere. Sometimes the original sonic events that begin each tune-- Rush's gentle hums, Gubler's guitar plucks, Lubelski's violin tones-- are distant memories by the end.</p>
<p>Because of this amorphous feel, <i>Golden Trees </i>evokes some music outside of the Tower universe. A natural comparison is the Velvet Underground's self-titled 1969 LP, whose patient reverence is shared by Metal Mountains' gradual development. Additionally, the band's drone-leanings recall recent Finnish avant-folk, particularly the engrossing hymns of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2603-lau-nau/"">Lau Nau</a>. What's unique about Metal Mountains is the indelible ambiance surrounding these traits. There's such consistency here, it's hard to imagine any single sound without the others.</p>
<p>In fact, you might find <i>Golden Trees </i>too consistent. Without percussion to emphasize pace, each tune has a similar, indefinite tempo. Time gets lost, and tracks drift and hang rather than moving forward. As the tracks melt together, you might swear the guitar part or vocal line you're hearing has happened before. But for me, such recurrences are what give <i>Golden Trees </i>its peculiar magic. Its cycling sounds and moods feel less like repetitions than dreamy déjà vu.</p></div>"|15220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15220-golden-trees/|7.1|Marc Masters

In  the visual for 2006's ""You Only Live Once"", the quintet wore all white  while dark liquid filled the room, leaving them drowned and floating.  And if that really had marked the end of the band, few would've been  surprised. Their third album, <i>First Impressions of Earth</i>, had  them limping, desperately trying to expand the signature sound that  looked to be swallowing them up like so much black water. It didn't  work. And the Strokes are too cool and too smart to become one of those  bands that puts out a record every few years just so fans can sing the  oldies back to them, right? So they went away-- to an array of  lackluster side projects, to families, to anywhere but the Strokes.</p>
<p>As  late as November 2009, Julian Casablancas was non-committal on the  subject of a fourth Strokes album. ""We've been trying to do it for  years,"" he said. ""I'm always available and they know that but getting  together is tough."" Guitarist Nick Valensi went  even further: ""I'm not even sure we're going to make a fourth album at  this point."" But still, here we are with <i>Angles</i>, not a roaring comeback as much as a glorified spit-balling session.</p>
<p>The  album attempts to rebuild the band from the ground up. Whereas  Casablancas had previously written nearly every part of the group's  songs including guitar solos and basslines, he steps back on <i>Angles</i>,  which features songs from other members. And this revised process is  evident in the credits: ""All Music Written and Arranged by the  Strokes."" Casablancas called the new way ""Operation Make Everyone  Satisfied,"" which sounds condescending enough. And while the more  democratic move may seem generous, the singer threw his clout around by  separating himself from the rest of the recording process and sending  his vocals to the band via electronic files. And the album's oddly  collaborative origins are evidenced in both its scatter-shot diversity  and its lurching fragmentation.</p>
<p>With its sprightly, dueling fret  work and familiar, cascading chorus, first single ""Under Cover of  Darkness"" hinted that the Strokes had come to terms with being the  Strokes-- after dalliances with other styles and sounds, they seemed  content with a revival in their own image. But, for better and (mostly)  worse, that is not the case. Though this band was routinely slapped with  claims of 1970s plagiarism upon their arrival, it's unlikely that many  people have ever mistaken a Strokes song for one by Lou Reed or  Television. So it's ironic that their mimicry can be uncanny on <i>Angles</i>.  But traces of scummy CBGB punk are sometimes replaced with big-snare  1980s flash. ""Two Kinds of Happiness"" pilfers one-time tour mate Tom  Petty for the palm-muted and hiccup-phrased verse before ramping things  up in a whooshing vintage-U2 hook. And ""Games"" is another 80s throwback,  utilizing crystalline synths and distant hand claps to help prove its  dour and strained point about ""living in an empty world."" Opener ""Machu  Picchu"" recalls ""Down Under"" dudes Men at Work. These are not the expected influences for a Strokes album.</p>
<p>Which would be  fine-- great, even-- if they were carried through with anything  resembling charm or commitment. Throughout, the album is hobbled by  disconnections-- between verse and chorus, lyrics and music, intent and  execution. Casablancas' ambivalence about his own actions crops up  often. On the ugly prog wannabe ""Metabolism"" he declares, ""I wanna be  outrageous/ But inside I know I'm plain."" Disjointed closer ""Life Is  Simple in the Moonlight"" has him confessing, ""There's no one I  disapprove of or root for more for than myself."" And while the singer's  singed self-loathing was present in the Strokes from the beginning, it  was always tempered with music that provided some uplift. But on the  sad-eyed and drum-less ""Call Me Back"", he's left to moan about how ""no  one has the time, someone's always late"" against a single guitar and  ethereal keyboard. Listening to the track, it's pretty easy to see why  people may not be returning his calls.</p>
<p>Yet there are still those  moments when you remember why it's a good thing that these five guys  stayed together. The beatific ""Gratisfaction"" is so easy-going and  straightforward in its Thin Lizzy-meets-Billy Joel strut that it  immediately rushes past nearly every other song here in the race for  greatest hits-dom. Even better is ""Taken For a Fool"", which is the only  track on <i>Angles</i> to really offer something refreshing while also  sticking with That Strokes Sound. The song's verse is air-tight and  bizarrely funky like some lost tape from David Bowie's <i>Lodger</i>, while the  hook relieves the syncopation with to-the-point brashness. Talking about  his general sonic goals in 2009, Casablancas said, ""The ideal for me is  to get really out there but have it go full circle and sound pretty  normal."" It's a worthwhile aim, and ""Taken For a Fool"" nails it.</p>
<p>As news about the Strokes' shaky resurgence has continued to flow over  the last few months, two of the group's contemporaries chose to bow out.  The White Stripes-- who faced off against the Strokes in a friendly  Coolest Band Alive competition for a few years in the early aughts--  officially broke up after a hiatus on February 2 in order to ""preserve  what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way.""  Meanwhile, fellow wry New Yorkers LCD Soundsystem will wrap up their  run April 2 at Madison Square Garden. As it happens, that's just one day  after the Strokes will play the same venue to kick-start their second  life. Everybody wants to quit while they're ahead. Some actually do it.</p></div>"|15230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15230-angles/|5.9|Ryan Dombal

He performs and/or produces under three different names (his own and the two attached to this mix); he has a boatload of singles under a cast of genre banners; he's behind one of UK bass' most consistently rewarding labels, Hessle Audio; and he has never released a full-length album. Following him to date has required the type of dedication that, unfortunately, too often deters people from electronic music fandom. Far from obscure, though, Kennedy is a <a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2011/01/badman-begins-ramadanman-david-k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hotly tipped</a> wunderkind, prominent enough that electronic-focused site <a href=""http://www.littlewhiteearbuds.com/chart/lwes-top-5-artists-who-defined-2010/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Little White Earbuds named him the defining artist of 2010</a>. This is how an artist that many people have never heard of ends up helming not just the next installment of the popular FabricLive series, but a highly anticipated installment.</p>
<p>At his core, Kennedy is a relentless style maven, a forward-looking producer and DJ whose curiosity and appetite for the new and regional can make him seem skittish, even standoffish. (To wit: he often gets credit for being one of the first European DJs to adopt the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29324-we-love/"">Footwork</a> sound, and its brash repetition suits him perfectly.) He deals in a stridently rhythmic brand of techno, borrowing the syncopation of dubstep, but with amped-up tempos and elements of reggae, UK funky, drum &amp; bass, and Detroit techno stirred in.  The pileup of styles gives Kennedy's music and mixes a casually aggressive tone; he's not actively trying to batter your sensibilities, but he doesn't care if he does. Remember when suburban skateboarders began listening to Wu-Tang instead of NOFX? Kennedy's cuts have that sort of edgy, athletic bend to them.</p>
<p><i>FabricLive 56 </i><span>represents a chance for Kennedy to display his voracious appetite at work. He wastes no time, racing into </span><i>56</i><span> with his own, ominous </span>""<span>Hawker</span>""<span> before cutting into a slice of the notoriously icy Berghain sound from Leon Vincent. It feels... a little unfriendly, to be honest. Kennedy's quick cuts-- the mix touches on fully 30 tracks-- sometimes feel like they're in the service of his waning attention, rather than the listener or the track.</span></p>
<p><span>The payoff for this thrill-seeking is the same sense of energy and quick momentum that Kennedy instills in his productions. And for all his new-school ethos and exploration, Kennedy has a healthy dose of </span>""<span>classic DJ</span>""<span> in him: </span><i>FabricLive 56</i><span> isn't merely a sequenced, curated set of tracks with transitions. He frequently lays the tracks on top of one other, letting elements of each bustle against each other. Toward the end of the mix, Kennedy has settled into some more recognizable tracks-- Burial's </span>""<span>Pirates</span>""<span>, Girl Unit's </span>""<span>IRL</span>""<span>, Addison Groove's </span>""<span>Fuk tha 101</span>""<span>-- but he takes ownership of them. At one point he lays the Eastern reeds from Pinch's </span>""<span>Qawwali</span>""<span> under MJ Cole and Wiley's </span>""<span>From the Drop</span>""<span>, creating dubby, tense trip-hop. There is a sense of history, too, of Chicago house (the up-with-dancing mantras of Julio Bashmore's </span>""<span>Battle for Middle You</span>""<span>), of German minimal, and of the type of dubstep he and his peers have obviously moved on from.</span></p>
<p>This makes sense: Kennedy hails from a scene of artists who are redeploying classic tools-- 808s, 909s, simple sampling-- in the service of ""new"" dance music. The novelty of this music-- and it does feel novel-- lies in its aggressive technique more than its sound design or genre signifiers. He caters to that aggression throughout <i>FabricLive 56</i><span> without ever losing sight of his responsibilities as a DJ. Waiting for a statement release from an artist with this mindset may be futile, so let's instead consider </span><i>FabricLive 56</i><span> a snapshot of Kennedy's current </span>fetishes<span>; expect it to date quickly.</span></p></div>"|15229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15229-fabriclive-56/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

Crane is archetypal of a certain sort of thirtysomething indie dude. He's brainy and at least somewhat socially conscious (he served half of a two-year stint in Teach for America), he knows his way around music-friendly metropolises (currently living in Seattle, he did his TFA time in Chicago), and he can certainly identify with <i>The Boston Globe</i> sports writer Chad Finn's excellent <a href=""http://www.boston.com/sports/touching_all_the_bases/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> about classic sports cards (BOAT's 2008 <i>Topps</i> 7"" EP came with five hand-drawn cards, plus a stick of bubblegum). Crane's band, meanwhile, has been working on the fringes of the indie rock mainstream, receiving generally positive reviews.</p>
<p>BOAT's fourth album, then, finds the Crane-fronted four-piece going through something of an underachiever's quarter-life crisis. On one hand, <i>Dress Like Your Idols</i> sees Crane, drummer Jackson Long, bassist/guitarist Mark McKenzie, and multi-instrumentalist Josh Goodman finally making their way into a real studio for the first time. On the other hand, that studio-- Seattle's Two Sticks Audio-- is already defunct. And the songs, like the album cover, are as inspired by the band's youth as ever, merging Stephen Malkmus's obliquely deadpan twang, Tullycraft's sugary scene-skewering, and Modest Mouse's ""<a href=""http://www.ohnodisaster.com/boat/2006/12/paradox-setlist-reptile-boy-shirts.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reptile boy</a>"" yelp. Where some slightly younger slackers have been opting for warped 1980s synth-pop, BOAT continue to love the 90s: an era when they didn't know, as per the rueful title track, that ""the job you wanted doesn't exist."" The result is the best album yet from a band whose style finally appears to be back in vogue, though its sometimes-bitterly sardonic humor still won't be for everybody.</p>
<p>When BOAT apply their new-found professionalism,<i> Dress Like Your Idols</i> outdresses more than just famously schlubby Doug Martsch, whose Built to Spill is one of nine bands paid tribute to on the album's memorably meta cover. First single ""(I'll Beat My Chest Like) King Kong"" sets a basic pop hook (""I'll love you if you love me"") over crunchy guitars and boisterous drumming that could please fans of such similarly 90s-minded bands as Surfer Blood, Yuck, or Free Energy (remember, the 90s also loved the 70s: Weezer, people!). John Roderick, whose underrated group the Long Winters gets its own album-cover homage, adds his drowsy, Pedro the Lion-ish backing vocals to ""Landlocked"", the record's screeching, pent-up emotional centerpiece. As Crane sarcastically boasts elsewhere, ""If looks could kill, I'd slaughter you.""</p>
<p>While the caustic, slightly self-pitying edge to PBR-pumping power-pop anthems like ""Classically Trained"" (which targets those lucky souls ""making art for a living"") and ""Kinda Scared of Love Affairs"" (which begins, almost a cappella, ""I'm not sure I want to be good-looking"") may put a few people off, it's hard to fault the successfully bombastic execution for anything except cozy familiarity. ""In time you'll become a cynic,"" hyper-referential ""When Frank Black Says (No. 14 Baby)"" warns, adding, ""We're just like you."" When <i>Dress Like Your Idols</i> transcends the archetypal 30-ish indie dude's perhaps understandable cynicism, BOAT resemble their heroes in more ways than one. That's why the most revealing lyric, ultimately, turns out to be this: ""Nothing seems impossible to me.""</p></div>"|15199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15199-dress-like-your-idols/|7.6|Marc Hogan

Sure, these days plenty of lo-fi acts-- from Wavves to Dum Dum Girls to Cloud Nothings-- have left the scuzzy sonics behind, as Pitchfork contributor Martin Douglas recently <a href=""http://passionweiss.com/2011/03/14/douglas-martins-dirty-shoes-new-adventures-in-hi-fi/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">noted</a> over at Passion of the Weiss. And it definitely works when, say, Smith Westerns embrace swooning Britpop balladry, because those Chicago glam-brats' songs already had a certain teen-dream sweetness to them. But their former tourmates Davila 666 are a different case. You wouldn't hire a big-budget remixer to scrub the grit out of ""Wild Thing"" or ""Louie Louie"", would you?</p>
<p>Like its <i>Nuggets</i>-crushing forebears, this Puerto Rican six-piece earns a place on your next house-party playlist with sheer anarchic energy, not to mention a formidable gift for language-transcending hooks. On Davila 666's underrated 2008 self-titled debut album-- plus a handful of vinyl-only releases for HoZac, Douchemaster, and Rob's House-- they established themselves as gleefully filthy purveyors of indecipherably catchy garage-pop. Thankfully, <i>Tan Bajo</i> doubles down on the group's strengths, delving deeper into screeching sonic chaos while adding an even more memorable batch of songs to shout along with, whether or not you understand the words.</p>
<p>That means Davila 666's sophomore album is still rowdy enough for an impromptu weekend binge with a few friends, but it also offers enough carefully crafted tunes and feedback-streaked textures to fill your headphones. Stylistic tropes from classic 1960s girl groups complement raucous guitar licks on harmony-drenched ""Yo Seria Otro"", with its call-and-response verses and touches of strings, as well as on waltz-time ""¡Diablo!"", with its brutally earnest spoken-word section. Meanwhile, the Velvets-JAMC scree explored on the earlier ""Ella Dice"" only expands on the hypnotically pounding ""Si Me Vez..."" or the instant-earworm advance mp3 ""Esa Nena Nunca Regreso"". When the band breaks into a full Ramones sprint on ""Mala"" or ""Patitas"", anyone with a playground-level knowledge of Spanish can still catch the gist: <i>mierda</i>, <i>caliente</i>, <i>cerveza</i>, <i>cucaracha</i>. That said, at plenty of times Davila 666 continue to delight in their inscrutability, as on the distantly crooned opener or the chocolate-jingle hidden track-- inside jokes, maybe? In any event, such dumb fun is a necessary part of what the train-whistling, irrepressibly hey-hey-ing ""Los Cruces"" reminds us, in a rare English-language moment, is only ""rock'n'roll.""</p></div>"|15223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15223-tan-bajo/|7.7|Marc Hogan

For the past couple of years, they've been toiling in that creative substrata of the electronic music world which means turning out big, buzzy remixes for indie popsters like Ladyhawke and Late of the Pier and occasionally getting a stab at flipping a song as massive as Wiley's bottle-popping, grime-gone-clubbing UK hit ""Wearing My Rolex"". No shame in that. Everyone has to start somewhere, and if Guillaume Brière and Benjamin Lebeau's aren't yet household names, their background has at least prepared them well for making their own surprisingly pop-oriented debut.</p>
<p>Shoes have recruited ringers including prolific all-purpose collaborator Gonzales and high-profile pop producer Lexxx (Arcade Fire, Crystal Castles, Madonna), as well as lesser-known names like Esser, CocknBullKid, and the Bewitched Hands to help out on everything from keys, vocals, and percussion to mixing and production duties. It would be surprising for these tracks not to come out sounding like well-polished pop, and indeed, they land nicely somewhere below the breezy highs of fellow Frenchmen Phoenix but above the well-groomed banality of, say, Tahiti 80.</p>
<p>About half the album aims for pathos at the disco, the kind of contrast of melancholy emotion and moving rhythms that have allowed rock bands to infiltrate dance clubs without mussing their pouts since at least the dawn of New Order. ""Stay the Same"" cops the glum night out vibe of early Hot Chip on the verses and the drugged choirboy falsetto of the Klaxons on the chorus. The title track has its vocalist sighing, ""There's nobody in the club/ I am the only one who's dancing"" over weeping synthetic strings, a listlessly robotic hand-clap, and an appropriately spacious amount of reverb. ""Wastin' Time"" is an effectively encouraging lift-your-head-up sort of ballad, backed with stick clicking percussion and soft cushioning synthesizer chords, its icy background vocals and keys recalling similar producers-turned-band Miike Snow.</p>
<p>But Shoes are at their best when they shake such ennui off. Of their more upbeat numbers, ""People Movin"" might have the most effective hook, an understatedly soulful revolving door chorus (""People movin' out/ People movin' in/ Why?"") set to a preset Rhythm Ace ""Latin"" beat augmented with live drums and a mopey flute motif. Also outstanding is ""Cliché"", on which an arresting female vocal stutter opens up into synth squeals and airy diva vocals on the choruses.</p>
<p>These songs can sometimes feel like catchy choruses surrounded by almost superfluous verses-- in other words, great remix material-- and the album closes with a track that demonstrates how well these songs might work as extended versions with sparser vocal elements, the nearly nine-minute long ""Investigator"". <i>Crack My Bones</i> can feel a little more anonymously cobbled together than you'd like from a pop group's debut, but it's still a promising and occasionally excellent first step for Shoes out from behind the studio desk and into the spotlight.</p></div>"|15225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15225-crack-my-bones/|7.1|Eric Grandy

Unhip even among the unhip bands vying to become the ""next Radiohead,"" playing the underdog worked out well for Elbow-- both at the start and over the span of three critically acclaimed and modestly successful records. After 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11322-the-seldom-seen-kid/"" target=""_blank"">The Seldom Seen Kid</a> </i>took home the Mercury Prize, Elbow earned platinum status in Britain. Even in the U.S., ""Grounds for Divorce"" and ""One Day Like This"" have shown up on TV (even if you were looking at George Clooney the whole time). So what happens now that more people have expectations of Elbow?</p>
<p>A good part of what makes Elbow so beloved is they've always felt impervious to either trends or expectations. Singer Guy Garvey even admitted recently his life isn't providing grist for his typical lyrical gloom. Instead, on <i>Build a Rocket Boys!</i>, the band finds itself camping out in its childhood hometown and reminiscing about days gone by. If that sounds like a return to much-beloved <i>Asleep in the Back </i>closer ""Scattered Black &amp; Whites"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2720-leaders-of-the-free-world/"" target=""_blank""><i>Leaders of the Free World</i></a>'s ""Station Approach"", that's true thematically. The gorgeous ""Lippy Kids"" harkens back to the Talk Talk spirituals of their early work, but what's remarkable about it is the totality of its lyrical warmth. Garvey avoids lionizing a specific time period, instead offering an empathetic survey of the banality and confusion of childhood-- two features of it that you never seem to outgrow.</p>
<p>But sonically, Elbow continue down the narrow corridor they've established in recent years-- immaculately recorded and stripping away nearly every bit of ethereal studio magic. (It's hard to remember that they used to make records people could conceivably get high to.) It only sounds like <i>rock music </i>when they're going out of their way to announce it as such, as on stomping lead single ""Neat Little Rows"".</p>
<p>But more than ever, Elbow are hitching their fortunes to their lead singer, and with that, <i>Rocket </i>is by a large margin their quietest record to date, the closest thing to a Garvey solo album we've heard. That's in the quite literal sense: a rhythm section that could always be relied on for crucial texture and propulsion goes missing for large stretches of time. Still, putting Garvey's charmingly tattered burr at the center is a wise move; it's rangy, warm, and no longer making any bones about its resemblance to Peter Gabriel.</p>
<p>But there's a sneaky risk to it, since what has troubled Elbow from the beginning is that while Garvey is a phenomenal vocalist and wordsmith, the dots don't always connect to form memorable songs. That's particularly glaring during <i>Build a Rocket</i>'s pokey midsection, which abates melodically and hangs on to Garvey's redolent lyrics for dear life. On the other side, for a band who's often held up to an alternative to Coldplay's more bombastic healing powers, Elbow's never met a gospel choir they didn't think could boost an anthem up to the rafters. But unlike the overblown ""With Love"", ""Open Arms"" rings true, a celebration that no one's beyond the convalescent power of the conditional love that one's family or hometown can offer.</p>
<p>""Open Arms"" in particular makes the case that the missteps and borderline mawkish sentiments of <i>Build a Rocket Boys! </i>can be attributed to the degree of difficulty involved with making grown-up music about youth without resorting to smugness, sensationalism or pandering. It's no slight to say the record's distinguishing quality is the one Elbow has had since the beginning, an honest humanity that's imperfect but can be appreciated if you live with it.</p></div>"|15178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15178-build-a-rocket-boys/|6.9|Ian Cohen

The duo spent most of the 1960s as a highly regarded folk act distinguished by their intuitive harmonies and Paul Simon's articulate songwriting, yet compared to the Greenwich Village revivalists, whom they tried to emulate on songs like ""A Simple Desultory Philippic"" and ""Bleecker Street"", they were pretty square. By <i>Bookends</i> in 1968, they were settling into themselves, losing their folk revival pretensions and emphasizing quirky production techniques to match their soaring vocals. Two years later, <i>Bridge</i> did that album one better by revealing a voracious musical vocabulary that spanned gospel, rock, R&amp;B, and even classical. As this thoughtful reissue attests, the album sounds unique even 40 years later, driven and defined entirely by their own personal musical and political obsessions.</p>
<p>This diverse album contains the roots of Paul Simon's subsequent incorporation of African and South American rhythms into astute pop songs, especially ""El Condor Pasa (If I Could)"". The tune is hundreds of years old, but Simon came to it via a contemporary Peruvian group called Los Incas. He wrote new English lyrics about the rural versus the urban, and he and Garfunkel sang them over the original instrumental track. Especially coming after the grandiose gospel of the title track, the song sounds both exotic and humble. Later, ""Keep the Customer Satisfied"" swells with gargantuan blasts of brass, ""Baby Driver"" revs up some R&amp;B sax, and ""Cecilia"" sounds impossibly infectious with its pennywhistle solo and handclap/thighslap percussion. Despite the breadth of sound-- and despite the splintering of their relationship-- <i>Bridge </i>sounds like a unified statement enlivened by styles and rhythms not often heard on pop radio at the juncture of those two decades.</p>
<p>The album cuts on <i>Bridge</i> hold up arguably better than the singles-- or maybe it's just that we've all heard the title track and side-two opener ""The Boxer"" so many times, while songs like ""Keep the Customer Satisfied"" and ""Baby Driver"" still sound less familiar, and therefore full of surprises. Especially on this subtle remastering, <i>Bridge</i> reveals a surfeit of strange, exciting sonic details, as Simon, Garfunkel, and co-producer Roy Halee insert small flourishes of sound, such as the disruptive skiffle beat on ""Why Don't You Write Me"" or the audience rhythm section on the live version of ""Bye Bye Love"". The title track derives its outsize drama not only from Garfunkel's intense, measured vocals but also from the resonating percussion, which mimics the echoing crack of sound against a cathedral wall. Thanks to the echo-chambered vocals, disembodied organ, and Joe Osborn's melodically prominent bass, ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" sounds practically weightless, as if Manhattan were as lonely and desolate as the moon. Even after it's been Zach Braff'ed, the song still retains its considerable evocative power and remains one of the most natural and surprising juxtapositions of sonics and sentiment in Simon's catalog.</p>
<p>""The Only Living Boy in New York"" conjures a very specific sense of melancholy abandonment, which makes it a companion to the title track's pledge of steady friendship and devotion. In some ways, <i>Bridge</i> sounds like a chronicle of Simon and Garfunkel's career and collaboration over the years, especially the album-ending send-off. The live ""Bye Bye Love"" reveals a greater kinship with the Everly Brothers than with Dylan, and an even stronger engagement with their audience; clapping a massive backbeat and yelling along with the song, that rambunctious crowd in Ames, Iowa, remains one of their most intuitive collaborators. As the noise dies down, the quiet ""Song for the Asking"" adds a brief epilogue that reveals their simple mission ""to make you smile."" It's a modest close to both the album and the musical collaboration between these two old friends.</p>
<p>Instead of non-album cuts from those same sessions (some of which have been compiled previously), this edition adds a DVD with a television special from 1969 and a new making-of, which emphasize the duo's social awareness and sonic innovations, respectively. Directed by Garfunkel's <i>Catch-22 </i>co-star Charles Grodin and airing on CBS in 1969, ""Songs of America"" mixes live footage with political rallies and American landscapes, depicting <i>Bridge</i> as a response to the heavily politicized turmoil of the preceding decade. Simon &amp; Garfunkel ponder the ramifications of Vietnam and Woodstock, MLK and RFK, Cesar Chavez and the Poor People's March. At that time such political images were extremely controversial, especially coming from such seemingly nonthreatening folkies as Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and the show was a commercial failure, beaten in the ratings by a Peggy Fleming ice-skating special. But today it plays as a highly instructive time capsule, offering entrée into that era and a valuable glimpse at the duo's chemistry while hinting at their conflicts.</p>
<p>This edition presents <i>Bridge </i>as an end-of-an-era document, that era being both the 1960s and their career together. Instead of acrimony, however, we get devotion and bonhomie, as Simon gives Garfunkel good songs to sing and Garfunkel sings them so well. Perhaps because it never addresses their restlessness or any particular social issue too directly, the album proves both visionary and revisionary, as the two ponder both their own and their country's past while looking ahead to new musical adventures. That Simon &amp; Garfunkel split up shortly after recording this album only makes the sentiments more fleeting and the songs more affecting, lending them a timeless quality that transcends genre and generation.</p></div>"|15197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15197-bridge-over-troubled-water/|9.4|Stephen M.

Black Emperor</a>. If you want to be accurate, however, then there's some explaining to do. Vessels are fond of the stirring (and often unsubtle) dynamic shifts that the aforementioned groups pioneered, but their bombing runs aren't deployed in quite the same manner. While their quieter moments sometimes center around gently plucked guitar figures, they can just as often involve other sounds and textures. <i>Helioscope</i> also proves Vessels capable of crunching numbers as efficiently as the most studious math-rockers. And while using vocals doesn't automatically make one's post-rock less post-y, Vessels' infrequent (though effective) use of them is just another weapon in their well-stocked arsenal.</p>
<p>It takes a little while for <i>Helioscope </i>to show its cards, though. Based solely on the first few minutes of ""Monoform"", Vessels would seem like another perfectly OK instrumental rock group. The arpeggiating synth and nimble, insistent drumming bring to mind recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2694-maserati/"" target=""_blank"">Maserati</a> or older <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4277-trans-am/"" target=""_blank"">Trans Am</a>, and the switch of focus from the heavy bass tones to a rolling xylophone in the second ""verse"" is a nice twist. As the song progresses, however, it becomes clear that Vessels are more interested in taking a road less traveled, opting to eschew the expected crescendo for some scenic meandering. It's only after mucking around for about three minutes-- including a minute-long segue into what seems like a different song altogether-- that they decide to pump up the volume and blow out the speakers. Delaying the presumably inevitable climax allows that pro-forma soft-to-loud move to actually surprise, which is an achievement in itself.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <i>Helioscope</i> offers plenty of pleasant surprises. Vessels can switch from constructing limber instrumentals around pleasantly warped guitar samples (""Later Than You Think"") to a track like ""Art/Choke"", where they unload relentless hard-hitting haymakers worthy of a heavier rock group. On the album's first vocal-centric track, ""Recur"", two group members sing against each other while the music underneath soars and swells like something you'd expect from mid-90s emo-affiliated band Juno. When vocals take the lead again, it's on ""Meatman, Piano Tuner, Prostitute"", with the gentle quaver of Brighton-based singer-songwriter Stuart Warwick at the mic. The end result of that collaboration is a shimmering tune that gives Elbow a run for their post-Radiohead money.  Even when <i>Helioscope</i> offers a more traditionally post-rock track, such as ""The Trap"", Vessels' way with arrangements and sonics produces something refreshingly out of the ordinary.</p></div>"|15215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15215-helioscope/|7.4|David Raposa

More recently, he's doing the opposite-- making warm bodies sound like machines.</p>
<p>Moritz Von Oswald Trio is his group of living, breathing musicians-- an all-star ensemble that also includes Max Loderbauer (NSI, Sun Electric) and percussionist Sasu Ripatti (Vladislav Delay). It's a unique concept: a live band that performs minimalist dance music-- well dressed, clean-shaven, and ready to jam.</p>
<p><i>Horizontal Structures </i>is the group's second studio LP, following a debut, <i>Vertical Ascent</i>, and a live album recorded during an appearance at New York's Le Poisson Rouge. As with the trio's previous output, the compositions on <i>Horizontal Structures</i> are entirely improvised. The record's four long, languid tracks all stretch more than 10 minutes. But the group uses that freedom sparingly. The music has no solos and no dramatic shifts in tempo. A steady pulse-- typically a drum machine or sequenced pattern-- is introduced, then embellished upon using live instrumentation and effects. It's tonal, but never directly melodic. In fact, individual expression of any sort is extraordinarily disciplined-- limited to modest knob tweaks and percussion fills. Like Von Oswald's work with Basic Channel and Rhythm &amp; Sound, the music makes heavy use of extended repetition. The tracks may be jammed out on the fly, but the results are tightly governed by the trio's shared affinity for minimalism.</p>
<p>But reserved and mechanical as it is, <i>Horizontal Structures</i> is a very warm record. Von Oswald and his regulars soak the music in reverb and atmosphere. This time around, additional musicians augment the trio-- Paul St. Hilaire (aka Tikiman) on guitar and Marc Muellbauer on double bass. Both toss a few swatches of dubby riffage and jazzy rumbling into the mix, as on ""Structure 2"", which pours glassy drones atop a percussive sequencer pattern and Rhodes piano tinkles. The mood is similar to electric-era Miles Davis, minus the fury. ""Structure 3"" and ""Structure 4"" make use of more traditional dub-techno elements-- burbling echo, reverb spikes, and phased hi-hat chatter-- but keep the pulse relaxed. ""Structure 1"" is an anomaly-- a loose, surprisingly abstract meditation that only gradually congeals into a rhythmic form. Though it's music is deeply informed by the club, Moritz Von Oswald Trio steers clear of hard kicks and bass. Where most live bands strive to deliver physical intensity, these guys headed down a different, more zoned-out path.</p></div>"|15226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15226-horizontal-structures/|7.0|Aaron Leitko

For starters, it no longer seems to produce the kind of paradigm-breaking acts or tracks like it did when microhouse was in its heyday. For seconds, the parallel ascendancy of Kompakt-inspired labels like Brooklyn's <a href=""http://wolflambmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wolf + Lamb</a> has hinted at a generational shift in techno; one could now argue that Kompakt is more revered than it is fashionable-- aging well, but aging nonetheless.</p>
<p>And while the label has always looked further afield than most gave it credit for, it's still tough to feel like the signing of California-based husband and wife duo Danny and Tiffany Preston isn't a quietly precedent-setting move, and one that's perhaps indicative of a more open mandate towards new kinds of sounds. Taken in isolation, that in itself is probably a good thing; after all, one need look no further than <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a> to find a shining example of an imprint that refreshed itself by expanding on its initial remit. Here's the bad thing, though: Rainbow Arabia are kind of awful.</p>
<p>The elevator pitch is that Rainbow Arabia make post-punky, pan-global electronic synthpop. Between their polyglot of rhythms and singer Tiffany's array of no-wave vocal affectations, they're clearly making a play for the space between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"" target=""_blank"">the Slits</a> and the kind of generalized 80s new-wave nostalgia that's quickly moving from a place of fashionableness and freshness into grim parody.</p>
<p>In fact, it's kind of hard to watch the video for lead single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15467-without-you/"" target=""_blank"">Without You</a>""-- in which Tiffany dresses up like a mime and pogos meaningfully around the streets of Serbia while Danny sits cross-legged in the background and sheepishly stabs away at a small Casio keyboard-- without feeling like it <i>is</i> some sort of parody. The art direction is so consciously oddball, the music so artfully spiky, the energy so telegraphed, and the global aspect so clearly worn like a badge that it's hard not to feel like it's some sort of nadir.</p>
<p><i>Boys and Diamonds</i> bustles with African, Indian, and Caribbean rhythms, and boasts some genuinely interesting production in places. But the  songwriting is ultimately too blocky and dull and slapped together for it to succeed  as the thing it most wants to be-- a pop record. ""Without You"" aside, there's  very little touch on display here; most of the tracks are blunt instruments  that feel like they were composed in two stages-- the complicated but  occasionally unfocused production first, the aimless caterwauling later. I listened  to this record about 15 times and still had trouble retaining any of it, so  I asked iTunes to randomly select one last song to write about and got ""Papai"", a dour, sorta-instrumental thing that's stuffed full of clattering sound  effects, icy synths, bongo drums, and some fun-fair-haunted-house-ready chanting.  It may not work as a song, but it's a perfect parable for why Rainbow  Arabia miss: You can see what they were trying to do, but that's a long way from feeling  it.</p></div>"|15231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15231-boys-and-diamonds/|4.9|Mark Pytlik

Over the last 26 years, Mascis  has produced a number of guitar-rock touchstones, yet it's been tough  to tell exactly how much effort and emotion has gone into his work.  Cited as one of the original slackers, his demeanor is infamously  laconic to the point of aloofness; even as he peels off some of the most  ear-busting guitar solos you've ever heard live, he sometimes looks  like he's about to doze off while doing so. Meanwhile, his words--  usually involving vague alienation and confusion-- are often drowned out  by the ungodly squall behind him. Across his career, Mascis has let  distortion, excess wattage, and virtuoso technique do most of the  talking for him, and the translation can be surprisingly clear. But <i>Several Shades of Why</i> is different.</p>
<p>It's his first solo album of all original material and it's almost entirely acoustic. Here, the grey-haired 45 year old's weathered husk of a voice is close-mic'd, as if he's drawling mere inches away from your head at all  times. And while he was rightfully dubbed ""the first American indie rock  guitar hero"" by Michael Azerrad in <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>-- and has backed that claim up with countless memorable solos-- the songs on <i>Several Shades of Why</i> are marked by background strums and finger-picking rather than spotlit  wails. By using his own name and going with such bare sonics, it's  reasonable to suggest that this album could be Mascis' most knowingly  personal yet. On the title track, he clears up the whole ""trying""  issue, kind of. ""I'm not saying much, I tried hard, that's all I do,""  he croaks, his feelings of hurt, wisdom, and wistfulness fearlessly  up-front.</p>
<p>Though the album is confessional in nature, the reveals  are relative-- there are no clear narratives and almost comically  nondescript song titles like ""Not Enough"", ""What Happened"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15402-is-it-done/"" target=""_blank"">""Is It  Done""</a>, are good representations of the ambiguous pronouns (and  profundity) found therein. Dinosaur Jr. bassist Lou Barlow once said Mascis ""had nothing to say, yet he had everything to say,"" which is about right. But, even considering the imprecise language, Mascis  does a fair amount of telling through his indelible voice, which wears  its years with crackling grace. Though Neil Young has been a common  reference point for Mascis' vocals since he first opened his mouth to sing, <i>Several Shades of Why</i> has him going for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13771-neil-young-everybody-knows-this-is-nowhere-after-the-gold-rush-harvest/"" target=""_blank""><i>After the Gold Rush</i></a>-type  intimacy like never before. So when he finishes the Laurel Canyon  hangover track ""Not Enough"" with ""I know my love is over/ And I wish I  didn't know,"" the simple admission carries serious heft.</p>
<p>That song is also aided by the vocal talents of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/632-band-of-horses/"" target=""_blank"">Band of Horses</a>' Ben Bridwell, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Social Scene</a>'s Kevin Drew, and J's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41254-j-mascis-tours-with-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">current tourmate</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>, whose recent album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15174-smoke-ring-for-my-halo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Smoke Ring for My Halo</i></a> shares a somber eloquence with this one<i></i>.  Guests are used frequently and wisely throughout the album-- adding  subtle vocal harmonies or instrumental atmospherics-- proving that the  notoriously non-communicative songwriter still knows how to make the right  connections when he needs to. None of the featured players are more effective than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank""> Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> violinist Sophie Trudeau, who adds elegant  ache to the title track. For all of his technical gifts, Mascis is wise  enough to know he shouldn't do it all, a fact supported by Dinosaur  Jr.'s brilliant comeback this century. (While Barlow and Dino drummer Murph are nowhere to be found on this album, they are thanked in the liners.)</p>
<p>On opener ""Listen to Me"", Mascis  repeats the song's titular phrase in a pleading voice. As the album's  10 tracks unravel with effortless, low-key ease, it's easy to obey his  appeal. He's no longer ""scared of feeling,"" though that doesn't mean  he's not scared. The specter of loneliness and aging is a through-line  here, too, brilliantly visualized by artist Marq Spusta's gorgeous  cover, which shows a pair of fuzzy, unmistakably J-like creatures-- one  big, one tiny-- using a sea monster's back for an island. (Mascis had a son in 2007.) Though dour, Mascis' sleeve avatar is also kind of cute. <i>Several Shades of Why</i> gives us that softer, gentler J Mascis. But it's not kids' stuff-- these are lullabies for adults, offered up with a compassion that doesn't come easy.</p></div>"|15211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15211-several-shades-of-why/|7.9|Ryan Dombal

Perhaps dance music is regrouping after a period of deep fragmentation, or perhaps it's marking time while awaiting new technologies. In any case, <i>Mosaik</i>, the debut LP by Berlin's <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/siriusmo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Siriusmo</a>, is an archetypal 2011 crossover dance record. There are hair-raising Daft Punk-ian swoops on ""High Together"", purplish bounces and metallic swirls on ""Feromonikon"", voluptuous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28238-applescal/"">Applescal</a>-like synth matrices on the title track, and juddering ghettotech aggression on ""Bad Idea""-- and that's before things get <i>really </i>eclectic. But Siriusmo's music is so fun and creative that, while listening to it, the state of electronic music will likely be the furthest thing from your mind.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With a decade's worth of singles and remixes already in the can, Siriusmo is no newcomer, and it shows in his cunning as an architect of sound. ""Sirimande"" thuds through warping filters toward a breakdown for delicately wrought hand percussion and Spanish guitar, and then reconstitutes itself as a dance track around this new axis. The way Siriusmo clips and bends his tones helps him to reconcile such extremes into coherent songs; he has the skills to realize anything in his prodigious imagination. And for all of his technical ability, his imagination is the star here. A former keyboardist in a 1970s-style funk band, Siriusmo brings a hot and jammy sensibility to his productions. While many could rock a dance floor, the concise lengths and jocular set-pieces give you a hint as to Siriusmo's true ambition: to make a pop long-player rather than a collection of singles.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This dude is quite the showman. At the beginning of ""High Together"", warm-up keyboard vamps are met with sampled audience applause that gradually gives way to boos. Both responses being equally disproportionate to the little keyboard squiggles, there seems to be a joke here about electronic music taking itself too seriously; a crime of which Siriusmo cannot be accused. ""Call Me"" is 51 seconds of vintage boom-bap with wobbly phone-ringing samples. There are wacky vocal monologues, cartoonish sound effects, and cool voices intoning Siriusmo's name with a hint of irony. His music can feel like hotness and a loving satire of hotness simultaneously. But all this personality serves to make the record cohesive. When the electro-pop of ""Einmal In Der Woche Schreien"" pivots into the glassy funk of ""Good Idea"" with a perfectly-placed whistle, you know you're hearing something that wants to be more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Siriusmo succeeds admirably in this goal, most of the time: The diversity is coherent and the gags elicit smiles. His almost hammy sensibility is winning, paired with his obvious awareness of its potential to bog down the sheer musicality of <i>Mosaik</i>. But things finally start to unravel a bit in the home stretch, as Siriusmo's zany notions start to get the better of his taste. ""Peeved"" gives us something like a cut-and-paste Captain Beefheart and works about as well in context as you'd imagine, which seems to set the stage for the irritatingly hyper and Mr. Oizo-like ""Feed My Meatmachine"". But you'll want to stick around for ""Signal"" and ""Red Knob"", which nicely wash away the unpleasant aftertaste.

But that large period of the band's work contains a euphoric feeling of escapism as well; it's still too easy, after all, to put on a song like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Ii0K77K1k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bizarre Love Triangle</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmZqi1PnHwU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Time of Night</a>"" and lose yourself to a place of limitless bliss. It's that electronic escapism that flushes the cheeks of Baltimore-based electronic musician Benny Boeldt's sophomore effort as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19457-adventure/"">Adventure</a>, <i>Lesser Known</i>. From the syncopated pulse of aptly named opener ""Open Door"", it's impossible not to draw comparisons to Sumner and co., as well as the best of the best 80s British synth-pop acts. Unlike the frequent blockiness of new wave, though, <i>Lesser Known</i> sounds expansive and maximalistic in design, as squelching synth runs fill up every last bit of possible space on the record's front half.</p>
<p>Certainly, Benny knows how to do the maximalist thing pretty well; his background in Baltimore's Wham City art scene, as well as Adventure's chiptune-swarmed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12477-adventure/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, fortifies a reputation for Loud and Big sounds. It's his first record's 8-bit confrontational, intermittently aggravating construction, then, that reveals its head on the album's back end, in the form of aggressively sinister synth-padded dance music. There's moments of heavy-lidded bliss in the dark oscillations of ""Another World"", but the spinning-class insistence of ""Lights Out"", as well as the sine wave noise terrorism of ""Meadows"", achieve annoyance rather than transcendence. It suggests that Boeldt hasn't yet fully exorcised the ghost of Wham City's calling card all-everything assault just yet, as the somewhat unintentionally goofy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/611-adventure/2277-relax-the-mind/"" target=""_blank"">clip</a> for a remix of ""Relax the Mind"" further suggests.</p>
<p>Despite those hurdles, <i>Lesser Known</i> feels like a riskily successful work of growth from Boeldt, and it rightly should: this LP marks his first time trying his hand at singing. He's not exactly a professional or anything, but he goes for it anyway with often great success, brightly emoting with an open stride on ""Smoke and Mirrors"" and getting rubbery, like a pop version of R&amp;B abstractionist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"">Autre Ne Veut</a>, on ""Fool's Paradise"". <i>Lesser Known</i>, then, is about self-exploration in unexplored territory, and how to lose yourself in that void. Boeldt's escaped, and it sounds like he's all the better for it.</p></div>"|15209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15209-lesser-known/|7.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

It was a change that affected more than just their roster. On <i>Dolphins</i>, their first release since Long's departure, remaining members Daniel Martin-McCormick and Damon Palermo have abandoned guitars and drums and with them the dubby post-punk alchemy of earlier efforts. In their place are a series of aqueous electronic discoscapes that are are every bit as confrontational. And what this release lacks in hooks or noisy cross-pollinating, it makes up for in continuity. Whether it's the mania of Martin-McCormick's vocals or commitment to head-hitting, rhythmic expanse, it's still obvious that you're listening to Mi Ami.</p>
<p>It's not only made clear by Martin-McCormick's distinct, flailing vocal work. At four songs in just over 30 minutes, Mi Ami are still as economical as they were when wielding guitars-- as many ideas are at play, you never get the sense that anything has been shoehorned into any given portion of a song. In fact, by virtue of their sonics, this is a far sparer and roomier affair than anything else they've crafted until now. What's most problematic about that, though, is that it leaves Martin-McCormick's vocals out in the open. With just a sampler and a keyboard to compete with in the mix, Martin-McCormick doesn't have much else to slam into here, an issue that's at its most jarring in the early seconds of standout closer ""Echo"" or the EP's brooding title track. The quilled texture of his voice simply doesn't match up well with the smooth, temperate tones this band is playing with as a duo, despite their typically violent, overwhelming interplay.</p>
<p>That said, whether working with this palette is a one-off experiment or the beginning of a lengthier adventure isn't easy to hear. <i>Dolphins</i> is both hypnotic and staggering at times, but it lacks the extraordinary stamina that those earlier Mi Ami long-players kept from end to end. Take for instance the neon groove of ""Hard Up"", a song whose pulse can only be matched in murmurs by the blank wandering of ""Sunrise"". That they're able to so accurately translate their singular energy from one setup to the next is a feat. Should they decide to stick with it, finding a way to spread all of that out would be another.</p></div>"|15219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15219-dolphins/|6.2|David Bevan

Their multi-genre stew-- full of funk, dub, jazz, hip-hop, and post-punk-- always takes me back to the late 1990s. That was a time when many cutting-edge bands were so obsessed with rhythms from outside rock's mainstream, their classic forms and brand-new mutations, that it was hard to even sell them in some quarters as ""rock."" At the time, this rhythmic-centric synthesis seemed to some of us like the genre's future, but the moment, unfortunately, passed quickly. Few current indie bands are paying tribute to Sun Ra or King Tubby, blending various strains of Afro-Caribbean rhythm culture and cutting the mix with rock's bite.</p>
<p>Of course, the Eternals aren't some post-rock analog to the current wave of lo-fi 90s nostalgia. They come directly out of the tradition, and over the course of four albums released in the last decade, they've kept its stylistically promiscuous vibe alive. But in <i>any</i> era, even one crowded with likeminded bands, they would be unique. Mostly that's down to vocalist Damon Locks and his wild changeups. Many of those late-90s bands peddled instrumentals. The rest had singers who (being way charitable here) seriously lacked for charisma. That's not a charge you could ever seriously aim at Locks, whose fearless vocal acrobatics, sometimes straining against his skill set, are what set him apart from most indie singers, then or now.</p>
<p>Punk sneer, cosmic P-Funk rapping, cracked crooning, wizened reggae mysticism: Locks rarely sings the same way twice on <i>Approaching the Energy Field</i>. His dub-style chatting and ""mystic space voice"" chanting have more hair-raising conviction than his more conventional (and technically just-okay) singing, just as the Eternals' music gets better the more it strays from homages to familiar genres and into weird combinations. But as on the previous albums, its Locks' abundance of personality and weird way with a hook that elevates the Eternals beyond an experiment in making new rhythms out of old, a band with both a deep love of post-funk history and the chops to scramble that history into new shapes.</p>
<p>Still, musically, this <i>is</i> the most varied and accomplished Eternals set yet. <i>Approaching the Energy Field</i> covers a wider range of sounds than even their first three albums, which were already pretty diverse: The jagged beats of Anti-Pop style ultra-underground hip-hop; the jumpy syncopations of UK bass music like broken beat and dubstep; spaced-out George Clinton synthesizer epics; low-key Latin jazz. It's clear the band knows and loves these sounds; you get the feeling they could ape any of them convincingly if they wished. But they're also too restless to play things straight, to simply pay homage to their influences and obsessions.</p>
<p>Aside from their commitment to rhythm, that desire to bend the rules and mix things up is still the Eternals' greatest asset. It's why the album's best moments are those which can be pegged to no particular genre, even when the beats drop away, like on ""I Let the Telephone Ring"", which evokes Spaghetti western soundtracks, Stravinsky-ish orchestral music, <i>and</i> the fragile dream-pop ballads of A.R. Kane. The Eternals may be out their own in their own in the once again guitar-centric world of indie rock circa 2011, but that just means we're doubly lucky they're still listening so widely, still pushing themselves to come up with such unexpected new hybrids.</p></div>"|15213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15213-approaching-the-energy-field/|7.6|Jess Harvell

It's easy for label heads to see the commercial success of arena-rap like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11609-empire-state-of-mind-ft-alicia-keys/"" target=""_blank"">""Empire State of Mind""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love the Way You Lie""</a>-- or crossover debuts such as Nicki Minaj's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14898-pink-friday/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Friday</a> </i>and B.o.B.'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14242-the-adventures-of-bobby-ray/"" target=""_blank"">The Adventures of Bobby Ray</a> </i>(Lupe turned down the Alex Da Kid beats to ""Airplanes"" and the Smeezingtons' ""Nothin' on You"") -- as a public mandate for more of the same. But wouldn't it just be easier to find someone down for the cause rather than to remake the public persona of someone who's already established?</p>
<p><i>Lasers</i> simply <i>sounds </i>bad, playing against every single one of Lupe Fiasco's strengths and creating new weaknesses. Surveying the current pop-rap landscape and retaining nothing worthwhile, it's at once chaotic, bored, and yet unyieldingly abrasive-- overblown, forced choruses, rawk guitar tracks that <i>had </i>to be laid down by a guy with a ponytail, mixing as subtle as a nu-metal record. There's a guy on several of these songs singing putrid hooks through what sounds like vocal filters retrieved from Dan Deacon's recycle bin-- he's named MDMA. This is a coincidence of cosmic proportions.</p>
<p>And then there's single ""The Show Goes On"", so gallingly lazy, I'm at least willing to view it as some sort of next-level parody of A&amp;Rs asleep in the hit factory-- it would certainly be a more clever indictment than ""Dumb It Down"". This is one that ""interpolates"" Modest Mouse and trades Isaac Brock's fuck-all optimism for <i>Lasers</i>' most blatant attempt to siphon juice from <i>Recovery</i>'s redemption-story treacle. Look, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTAud5O7Qqk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Float On""</a> is a great song, not a sacred text but interpolated into a half-Branson, half-Disney brass fanfare somehow cheapens it worse than any appearance on <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQKdgFZCGs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kidz Bop</a> </i>or <a href=""http://stereogum.com/4846/american_idol_gets_its_float_on/video/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""American Idol""</a><i>.</i></p>
<p>But if this was simply ""man, shame about some of the beats and hooks,"" someone might assume they stumbled onto a review of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9437-food-liquor/"" target=""_blank"">Food &amp; Liquor</a> </i>or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11022-the-cool/"" target=""_blank"">The Cool</a>. </i>Whether it's self-sabotage or a total lack of inspiration, the major difference here is that Lupe isn't working hard or playing hard. Doing just enough to escape his 16 bars before the next bombshell chorus blows, he fills his verses with guh-inducing wordplay, one-note concepts (the central metaphor of ""Out of My Head"" was deep enough to support a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758766/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drew Barrymore/Hugh Grant movie</a>), or stock attempts at anguish (""Beautiful Lasers (2 Ways)""), uplift (""Coming Up""), and non-conformity (""State Run Radio"").</p>
<p>You can't knock him for trying something new, but the tools he should be using-- his rubbery wordplay, thoughtful commentary, sheer <i>love </i>of the art form-- get ditched, with nothing interesting to replace them. This is mostly true even on the songs that sound like Atlantic's reward to Lupe for holding up his end of the bargain. Or maybe I'm wrong about all this and in time, <i>Lasers </i>will make the bean counters happy enough to grant Lupe the resources to and freedom to do whatever he envisions as his classic. Then again, his emo past is well noted-- as is the chip on his shoulder. Lupe often has enough trouble staying out of his own way, yet <i>Lasers</i> doesn't suffer for that reason; it just feels like the flaming wreckage of a project that never had a prayer.</p></div>"|15208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15208-lasers/|3.0|Ian Cohen

Normally a hiatus that long indicates a need to reform, retool, or in some way restart. But apparently this New York trio just gestated, growing their music into something wider, thicker, and harder to define. In huge jams that soar, crash, and smolder-- often at the same time-- the band pumps extra blood and muscle into their sound, as if stretching a balloon into a blimp.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with <i>Gamelan</i>, you might wonder how the Psychic Paramount could make their sound any bigger; their crunchy noise and rumbling rhythms already filled speakers. On the surface, <i>II</i> is actually pretty close to <i>Gamelan</i>,<i> </i>at least in volume. But the way it plays out is more widescreen, more 3-D. The songs encompass more moods and tempos, more shifts and builds, more ideas and moves. And the rippling guitars, cloudy bass, and exploding drums create sonic lava that coats the stereo space.</p>
<p>Given that scope, it makes sense that the Psychic Paramount have been called post-rock. (The same tag was laid on the band that guitarist Drew St. Ivany and bassist Ben Armstrong previously inhabited, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2406-laddio-bolocko/"">Laddio Bolocko</a>.) After all, they're instrumental and they like to build to crescendos. But where most post-rock bands rely on quiet/loud shifts to create dynamics, these three manage to ebb and flow while sticking to a maxed-energy attack. So while they may ascend at one point and descend at another, they never sound like they're retreating.</p>
<p><span>Which puts <i>II </i>closer to the relentless psych-noise of Japanese bands like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushitsusha"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fushitsusha</a> and <a href=""http://www.marby.or.tv/index-e.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marble Sheep</a> than the cine-drama of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a>. It also has the bluesy immolation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"">Comets on Fire</a> and the hammering weight of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"">Lightning Bolt</a>, but the impressive thing about <i>II</i> compared to all of these groups-- even compared to <i>Gamelan-- </i>is how controlled and confident it sounds. It's as if they decided to make fire by patiently rubbing sticks rather than violently striking a match. And just as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/454-glenn-branca/"">Glenn Branca</a> forged an <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/909-the-ascension/"">Ascension</a> </i>by pounding at one chord, the Psychic Paramount find fuel by drilling to the bottom of single riffs.</span></p>
<p>They can get complex, too-- songs<i> </i>like the chopping ""RW"" and jazzy closer ""N5 Coda"" share a math rock vibe with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1127-don-caballero/"">Don Caballero</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3193-oxes/"">Oxes</a><i>. </i>But they're rarely just connecting dots. They're more interested in following intuition than patterns, and <i>II</i> is way more physical than mental. Its density, pace, and exuberance are, for anyone that likes to get lost in sound, basically a sonic amusement park. Still, even if you can close your eyes on this roller coaster<i>,</i> you can't turn off your brain. In fact, the way the Psychic Paramount infiltrate your ears, they're more likely to switch that particular organ into overdrive.</p></div>"|15190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15190-ii/|8.2|Marc Masters

She released four studio albums and one double live, more than matching her output for the previous two decades combined. Drifting away from country music (which had little use for her as a songwriter or as a performer) and toward a gritty strain of roots rock, Williams grew more confessional in her lyrics, which have grown blatantly autobiographical and have coalesced into a larger story built around her romantic ups and downs. Rather than refining her craft, this development has actually had a deleterious effect on her music. In contrast to her first two country-blues albums and her three truly country albums, her four records from the previous decade have been alternately alienating and ingratiating, self-indulgent and self-denying-- eager both to please an audience and disdain them. Her once effortless lyricism has become rigid and workmanlike, with clichéd phrases standing in for complex evocations and words seemingly chosen less for their intrinsic meaning and more for their adherence to her AABB rhyme schemes.</p>
<p><i>Blessed</i>, her ninth studio album, marks the culmination of another trend in Williams' career, one that is much less concrete than the mechanisms of meter and rhyme. Her songwriting has become increasingly about the present rather than the past. <i>Sweet Old World </i>(1992) and <i>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</i> (1998) possessed a heady notion of personal history, exploring the ways we hold onto old lovers and how certain places (an old juke joint, the town of Pineola, Miss.) can evoke such bittersweet memories. <i>Blessed</i> has only one prominent concrete noun-- in ""Copenhagen"", named for the city where she learns of a friend's death. And why shouldn't Williams be more interested in the here and now instead of the there and then? If her 2000s albums have rendered her life as it happens, then these new songs chronicle a new and unprecedented chapter: happiness and contentment. In 2009, she married her manager Tom Overby, which means she's writing songs about finding her joy and from the perspective of a happy woman. ""Sweet Love"" is a straightforward love song that recalls a time when Williams could make simple sound endlessly complex, and ""Convince Me"" and ""Kiss Like Your Kiss"" (written for <i>True Blood)</i> are her sexiest songs since ""Right in Time"" 13 years ago.</p>
<p>Happiness suits her, but Williams' frustrating tics remain-- the constant repetition of phrases, the inflexible song structures, the compartmentalized melodies-- and are matched with anonymous roots rock courtesy of co-producers Overby and Don Was. Williams builds the title track on various iterations of the line ""We were blessed by..."" but the song becomes increasingly hackneyed in its spirituality, speaking in broad platitudes rather than concrete examples. ""We were blessed by the battered woman who didn't seek revenge,"" she sings plaintively, but vaguely. ""We were blessed by the warrior who didn't need to win."" When she tries to reach outside herself and address the wars in the Middle East-- a first for her-- Williams comes up with a great idea that allows her to alternate between the battlefield and the home front, but the persistent couplets deliver only dully acoustic melodrama, culminating in the lines, ""Today I took a bullet through the heart/ Baby's gonna have to make a brand-new start.""</p>
<p>This being a Lucinda Williams album, death looms ominously even over her contentment. <i>Blessed</i> includes not just one but two songs about deceased friends-- a genre she has historically excelled in. But even as ""Copenhagen"" tries to evoke the shock of helplessness that comes with learning of a friend's sudden passing, Williams sets the scene with an astoundingly awkward metaphor about taking a snowball to the face, the melting ice mixing with her tears. Rather than poignant, it sounds forced and arbitrary, even campy. ""Seeing Black"" was allegedly written in the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37454-vic-chesnutt-in-coma/"" target=""_blank"">Vic Chesnutt's death</a> and continues the long line of worried artist laments like ""Drunken Angel"" and ""Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings"". It's an emotionally forensic investigation, but instead of trying to understand his suicidal impulses, Williams just sounds like a scold.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Blessed </i>has the feel of a transitional album-- from lonely to married, from troubled to contented, from regretful to joyful. She's confronting the prospect of happiness and commitment but hasn't fully relinquished the hard feelings of her past few releases. It is enough, however, to engender a lot of good will toward the album. Listening to these songs and knowing the story she has been so careful to document, you want Williams to finally find her joy. You want this album to be good. You want these songs to be better than they really are.</p></div>"|15179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15179-blessed/|5.4|Stephen M. Deusner

From the 1920s onward,  Lollywood-- the affectionate term for the Lahore-based studio system-- has been the source of the huge majority of hit songs in the country, even as the industry has suffered one cruel setback after another, from wars to coups to changing censorship laws. One side effect of film music's grip on the subcontinent's pop consciousness has been that India and Pakistan jointly represent one of the biggest holes in the global late-1960s/early-70s beat music story-- there just aren't many recordings of rock music from the era from either country.</p>
<p>But the music existed. Much of it has been effectively lost simply because the record companies that operated in South Asia weren't interested and the bands didn't get to record. In urban Pakistan, the late 60s looked in many ways similar to the late 60s in Western Europe or the U.S.-- long-haired, politicized university kids making music with whatever was available to them. Bands covered Western hits, and some almost certainly wrote their own material, but when it came time to go into the studio-- a privilege few ever received-- their options were limited. Most cut little more than a single or an EP, and instrumental versions of old folk songs and Urdu film tunes were about all they were allowed to record.</p>
<p>Thankfully, what was put to tape is pretty distinctive. If the 22 songs gathered on Sublime Frequencies' <i>Pakistan Folk and Pop Instrumentals</i> don't illuminate anything that could be considered a real scene, they do at least share a sort of charming weirdness, highlighted by a mix of local percussion, surfy guitars, and blaring, cheap organ, with the occasional sitar or accordion. The set's compiler, Stuart Ellis, has an ear for non-Western beat music-- he also compiled SF's <i>Bollywood Steel Guitar</i> set and runs Radiodiffusion International, a site that for the past few years has posted one exceptional, forgotten beat gem from far off the beaten track, sharing songs from Brunei, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Iran, Bangladesh, Somalia, and dozens of other countries. It's worth checking out the Annex's long archive.</p>
<p>What he's put together here actually represents the lion's share of recorded non-film Pakistani beat music, at least that anyone's been able to dig up. The Panthers, the Mods, the Aay Jayes, the Abstracts, the Blue Birds, and the Fore Thoughts are the featured bands, with a few non-soundtrack songs from film composers Sohail Rana and Nisar Bazmi included to round things out. Predictably, it's the Bazmi and Rana songs that sound the most like the intentional collision of styles that lay at the heart of South Asian film music during the era. Rana's ""The Khyber Twist"" even comes from an album pointedly named <i>Folk Tunes of Pakistan on the Latin American Beat</i>, though that particular song is much more in the surf style of American groups like the Challengers and the Chantays.</p>
<p>The best of the bands included was probably the Panthers-- Ellis is making a point when he opens the set with their ""Malkaus"", which opens with a bit of ghazal-ish singing before someone yells, in English, ""take over, Panthers!"" and the song comes in with a startling rush of Beatlesque guitar. It's a manifesto for a musical revolution that never materialized. The other bands give it their best shot, though. I love the twanging and chiming guitar tones they worked with, but I'll admit that the extremely treble-heavy organ sounds favored by most of these bands might sit a little hard on some listeners' ears.  The mix of Western instrumentation and Pakistani rhythms results in quite a few great songs-- the Fore Thoughts' ""Shahbaz Qalander"" is an especially effective and subtle melding of East and West.</p>
<p>Hearing this music takes on a slightly different shade of meaning when you consider what happened in Pakistan during the time covered by the compilation. It picks up just after the inconclusive 1965 war with India over Kashmir, and encompasses a time of immense change and challenge for Pakistan. The military junta that had ruled the country since 1958 came to an end in 1972, less than a year after a disastrous war that led to the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan and a humiliating defeat at the hands of India. The civilian rule of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was a period of relative liberalization, and this is the period most of these songs actually come from-- many are from 1976, which is not an accidental closing date. Bhutto was overthrown in 1977, and the subsequent regime of General Muhammed Zia-ul-Haq pursued an aggressive policy of Islamization, which included the imposition of curfews and the banning of alcohol. The death of Pakistani nightlife led most of the musicians heard on this compilation to move abroad.</p>
<p>So <i>Pakistan Folk and Pop Instrumentals</i> captures an extended moment in Pakistani music and history. It's a moment in which a segment of the country's educated youth was fleetingly swept up in the great tidal currents that helped make beat music one of the first globe-spanning cultural phenomena. It's a moment that will never be duplicated, and that's part of what makes it so fascinating today. We can lament that there wasn't more documentation, but what we do have is interesting, unique, and just plain fun to listen to.</p></div>"|15207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15207-pakistan-folk-and-pop-instrumentals-1966-1976/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Except Inga's name might be Karen Glass, and Roy Blunt may actually be Roy Nnawuchi. It's possible neither exists; some have suggested Hype Williams may in fact be a much larger collective, while others have offered the name Denna Frances Glass as a potential culprit. When they perform live, they don elaborate masks, and are notoriously-- albeit understandably-- interview-averse. The vinyl version of <i>One Nation</i>, their latest, is a white record, tucked into a plain white sleeve in a glossy white cover. Even their name, Hype Williams, seems less an SEO-piggybacking attempt at easy nostalgia points than a pun on the very idea of ""hype."" There's an intentional blankness and an almost post-punky spirit of deconstruction to Hype Williams' image that does well by their stark music, a spacious, hazy, hip-hop-influenced electronic dub.</p>
<p>As you'd imagine, Hype Williams don't exactly provide credits for <i>One Nation</i>, but they do take the time to shout out a couple of special guests: MDMA and blueberry kush. Despite a certain stoney splay, there's a weird solemnity to <i>One Nation</i> that belies the presence of these mood enhancers, an unsettling ominousness even in its floatier moments. Snatches of smeary g-funk, synth-pop, and monster-movie soundtracks sneak into the mix, but <i>One Nation</i> is sparse throughout, with most tracks consisting of little more than a beat and a bit of queasy synth. There are few vocals, fewer hooks; it's not quite ambient enough to slip completely into the background, but nothing's quite fleshed enough to demand full attention, and you're better off losing yourself in the drift of <i>One Nation</i> in total than attempting to settle on a highlight. In their rare interviews, Hype Williams have done what they can to distance themselves from this kind of half-there hypnagogy, and their aloofness sets them apart from much of the bedroom-borne haze of late. Melodies don't just waft, they meander, beats shuffle into unlikely grooves, and any hints of prettiness are suffused with a looming dread.</p>
<p>But there's an intentionality to every gesture on <i>One Nation</i>. Even when the melodies threaten to lose their shape, they seem to bend just so, and the notes they're not playing seem every bit as important as the few they do. The negative space envelops like a fog; whoever's making this music has a producer's ear and editor's spirit, excising all unnecessary details while embellishing what little's left. At its best, <i>One Nation</i> sounds like a beat tape left to crackle for a decade in somebody's garage, a kind of post-<i>Chronic</i> spin on one of those far-out late 70s dub-inflected collaborative krautrock LPs. But other times it feels like a series of conceptual curios that seems to think holding the listener at arm's length might even be too close.</p></div>"|15212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15212-one-nation/|6.4|Paul Thompson

The classic template, from the kung fu samples and RZA production blueprint to the rapper's trademark styles, was well-established more than a decade ago. Staying in that lane hasn't always paid creative dividends for the Clan-- there are a few post-millennial Wu records that are hardly essential-- but Raekwon has managed to avoid the obvious pitfalls. Making sequels to 1990s classics was a risky effort, considering how much the rap world had shifted in the interim. But with </span><i>Cuban Linx II</i><span>, it was apparent that Rae's rapping, as flashily dense and intensely percussive as ever, was one of the Clan's renewable resources.</span></p>
<p><i>Shaolin vs. Wu Tang</i><span> is neither as ambitious nor as dark as </span><i>Cuban Linx II. </i><span>It's leaner than both </span><i>Linx</i><span> records-- many of the tracks clock in under three minutes-- which also frees it from the weighty expectations game that dogged Rae since </span><i>Immobilarity </i><span>critically bombed. The production from a slate of lesser-known names caused some fans to balk, but it's a strong choice; the beats seem selected for their function rather than the producer's reputation. It's definitely a reverent record created for Wu fans, with all the requisite cinema samples and minor-key melodies. The freewheeling novelty of last year's </span><i>Cocainism Vol. 2</i><span> mixtape, which even included </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG5_nMXAu7A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rae spitting</a><span> over </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrF4-DdqVqs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Blackbyrd's classic ode to public sex</a><span>, is scaled back. But there is enough variation in the production and craft-conscious rhyme construction to make it a worthwhile project, one that unexpectedly stands out in Raekwon's catalog.</span></p>
<p><span>The production </span><span>largely sticks to the RZA's overall approach. Bronze Nazareth's turn on ""Butter Knives"" hews especially closely to the RZA's more cinematic </span><i>Cuban Linx</i><span> moments. But there are twists throughout to keep things interesting.  The best beats build on the typical Wu track by adding some new ideas. Evidence's ""The Scroll"" and Scram Jones' ""Crane Style"", for example, play with some unusual drum loops, which provides a good counterpoint to Rae's choppy, rhythmic approach to rap. ""Crane Style"" and Selasi's ""Snake Pond"" also use some great melodic samples that expand on the Wu's co-opting of ""Oriental"" cinematic tropes.</span></p>
<p><span>The record's biggest weakness is the unfortunate ""Rock N Roll"", which is doomed by its unappealing chorus, generic production courtesy the generally unimpressive DJ Khalil, and a guest verse from Jim Jones. Guest verses in general are all a tier below previous Raekwon records. Although Wu alumni work well enough throughout, Nas' verse on ""Rich and Black"" does nothing to help his recent artistic slide. Busta Rhymes sounds ridiculous on ""Crane Style"". Rick Ross doesn't bring much to the table on ""Molasses"", and Lloyd Banks verse is well-written but his voice sounds strangely strained.</span></p>
<p><span>Raekwon, though, is on point throughout, and in the end it's his rapping that carries the LP. From his reinterpretation of the ""</span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzcdmGINcqI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Broken Language</a><span>"" rap style for the title track to the densely detailed reminiscence ""From the Hills"", his verses never seem underwritten, interlock in interesting ways and convey moods and concepts with gripping style. Few rappers could bring such an engaging sense of energy to a project so focused on preaching to the converted.</span></p></div>"|15210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15210-shaolin-vs-wu-tang/|7.9|David Drake

Their style of hip-hop and R&amp;B-flecked house has developed over years of collaboration, grown publicly via a well-received ongoing party at Brooklyn's Marcy Hotel, and just recently begun to build some traction in other dance circles domestically and abroad. So this set, part of !K7's long-running and well-curated <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series and following two similar Soul Clap mixes for Resident Advisor and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15181-social-experiment-002/"" target=""_blank"">new label No. 19</a>, arrives right when folks are wondering about their sound.<br/><br/>The four DJs behind this mix (Wolf + Lamb's Gadi Mizrahi and Zev Eisenberg, Soul Clap's Cnyce and Elyte) recognize the opportunity and offer here a pretty definitive look at their style. On a basic level, these guys make slow-burning, steamy house music but round it out with elements from hip-hop, R&amp;B, and vintage pop-- breakbeats, rave-y vocal snatches, and funk samples split time with warm, undulating synth and bass. What's interesting, though, is that for the very outward attributes of the music they pull from, these DJs are primarily about subtlety. Rather than climatic builds, they focus on patient groove and vibe, working you over slowly and deliberately.<br/><br/>Originally envisioned as a battle mix of sorts (literally the two acts ""versus"" one another), this <i>DJ-Kicks</i> set is instead a collaborative affair, mixing original tracks from both crews and remixed material by pals like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=jaar&amp;search_type=standard"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a>, Greg Paulus, and Benoit &amp; Sergio. It's a well-crafted, cohesive mix that features some great material and a few superfluous cuts. (At 27 tracks, there's a whiff of overkill.) Generally, they impressively blend genres, like on Soul Clap's ""3 Wheel E-Motion""
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
, which is almost ambient g-funk, or the astral, bubbly R&amp;B of Double Hill's ""Everytime I Go"". There's this great mix of old and new on these tracks, an unlikely fusion of dusty urban sounds and lush synth trickery.<br/><br/>These DJs also go to great lengths to keep the mix varied and interesting, always playing with tone and incorporating surprise bits like Jaar's experimental techno or the skittery dub of Paulus' ""Suchashame"". Even with these detours, the record could still feel background-y to some simply because it's so understated by nature. That's just a taste issue, though-- some will appreciate this more muted style, some won't. But if the idea of letting some balmy, make-out house ingratiate itself over time is appealing? In that case there's tons to enjoy here. And even if this sound remains a regional thing, the mix at the very least shows these dudes are onto to something unique and maybe even quite special.</p></div>"|15206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15206-dj-kicks/|7.6|Joe Colly

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Everyone loves a good comeback story, and the return of Gary Higgins has been one most dramatic and unlikely in recent memory. In 1973, Higgins released his debut album <i>Red Hash</i>, and then, following a stint in prison on drug charges, disappeared entirely from the public eye. Over the intervening years, a small but fervent group of fans came to consider <i>Red Hash</i> a lost psych-folk classic. Following a great deal of detective work, Drag City reissued the album in 2005 and Higgins returned to play some well-received live shows. In 2009, Drag City then released <i>Seconds</i>, Higgins first album of new material in more than three decades.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The only snag in the resurrection of Higgins' music career was that on <i>Seconds</i>, the backstory largely overshadowed the actual music. Time had been surprisingly kind to Higgins' gentle voice, but <i>Seconds</i> failed to recapture the magic glow of <i>Red Hash</i>, with stiff songwriting that too often settled into coffeehouse folk-rock clichés. So it seems a good decision that for the next stage of Higgins' musical rejuvenation Drag City has gone back to the beginning with <i>A Dream a While Back</i>, a short collection of songs recorded by Higgins back in 1970-71. And though these solo works are not as fleshed out nor quite as transporting as the highlights of <i>Red Hash</i>, they provide a fascinating document of a young songwriter finding his voice, and leave behind lingering questions about what might have been.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Oftentimes when an obscure album comes to be considered a cult classic, it can be easy to hear why it failed to find a larger audience in its own time-- it's too out-of-step, too innovative or forward-thinking, or just simply too personal and strange. But to me that has never seemed the case with <i>Red Hash, </i>an album that sounds resolutely of its time, and nearly as accessible as the folk-rock of Neil Young, Bert Jansch, or Paul Simon of the same era. And it certainly doesn't sound that foreign to modern ears familiar with the work of Elliott Smith or Ben Chasny, who memorably covered <i>Red Hash's</i> ""Thicker Than a Smokey"" on Six Organs of Admittance's <i>School of the Flower</i>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Many of Higgins' songs on <i>Red Hash</i> concentrated on that slender line that exists between peaceful solitude and melancholic loneliness. These mixed emotions about being left alone with oneself are further heightened on <i>A Dream a While Back</i>. Whereas Red Hash was recorded with members of Higgins' backing band Wooden Wheel, on these six tracks his voice is accompanied almost solely by his own acoustic guitar. Recorded at The Old Chestnut Inn in Kent, CT-- a location, incidentally, that will soon be used as a drug rehab facility-- these songs have an intimate, fragile quality that encourages its listeners to draw their chairs in a little closer.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With archival material like this, it is always tempting to examine the songs for hints of foreshadowing, and it's easy to have a little shiver when Higgins sings such fatalistic lines as ""Ragged edges will cut your hands, do you in and change your plans"" on the opening ""Stormy Weather"". On the lovely ""Waiting for You"", Higgins raises his voice to a slightly higher register, his near-falsetto adding to the delicacy of his lonesome chorus. It should also be mentioned that by the time of these recordings he was already a very agile guitarist and, given the lo-fi nature of the production, the casual sophistication of his playing on tracks like ""Laugh a Little"" or ""Oxygen"" can catch the listener off guard.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">All of the songs included here feature memorable if not exactly bold melodies, sounding in general like pieces that Higgins intended to come back to later and build upon with a full band. That he never quite got the opportunity to do so at the time feels like a raw deal for him and for us. Listening to this collection, I can't help but think there could be some killer cover versions to be made of these songs, either by younger musicians looking for top-shelf material or by Higgins himself, returned at last to the spotlight.</p></div>"|15198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15198-a-dream-a-while-back/|6.8|Matthew Murphy

A few artists are trying-- by providing only vague geographical information, crafting webpages consisting of blurred video, and other heavy-handed approaches to mystique-building. Vondelpark takes a more bold-faced approach to the lack-of-personality game; no videos, no MySpace page, no Bandcamp, nothing.<span> </span>So far the only tangible information that exists is that he hails from London and has a debut EP out on R&amp;S records.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span>The record's vibe-- lost, fuzzy sounds-- fits the lack of disclosure. ""California Analog Dream"" may sound like the king of chillwave titles but the song owes more to two-step and UK garage; the beats are crystal clear-- more digital than analog-- but the rest of the instrumentation is hazy and lo-fi, from the mumbled, clipping vocals to barely there synth textures that swell and drift throughout the song.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span>There's a restless feel to all four of these tracks, most obvious in the vocal chatter of ""California Analog Dream"" and its yearning for escape-- walking to San Diego is a far cry from the grey, rainy London. Vondelpark combines escapist elements of dream-pop-- gauzy synth textures dripped with reverb-- with some very English two-step beats. It makes for a neat self-descriptive mesh of nostalgic sounds from two distinct places-- one imagined and one lived.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">While the smeared vocals, woozy textures, and garage-y beats work on the more clearly defined moments, they come across as rough or unfinished on ""Jetpack Blue Version"". Here the busy vocals feel intrusive and the melody is difficult to pin down, making the song seem like a first draft. ""Hippodrome"", on the other hand, is the most focused track here, with its lilting guitar line and insistent vocal melody. Despite being shorter and more reigned-in than the more wide-open moments on the record, it still has an effortless off-the-cuff feel thanks to its subtly shifting movements and loose drums. In the end, it feels strangely voyeuristic, as Vondelpark's mumbly vocal style and mysterious persona give off the sense you're privy somebody's private feelings.</p></div>"|15201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15201-sauna/|7.1|Hari Ashurst

But the sound separation is generally pristine, contrasting timbres are clearly proportioned, and stereo space is carefully managed. It was recorded with a band that included members of Múm and Seabear, in Sin Fang's own studio and in Sigur Rós' Sundlaugin.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Maybe the lo-fi label is just hanging on from Sindri Már Sigfússon's debut record as Sin Fang Bous, <i>Clangour</i>, where he played every instrumental part, so that it felt more like his early days as Seabear, before it too swelled into a full band. It seems as if he'd like to be a spontaneous bedroom musician, but is actually more professional by inclination. Morr also reports that Sigfússon tends to make music on a meticulous 9-to-5 schedule, and it shows in this polished, richly detailed, but somewhat workmanlike album. It's consistently easy to admire and, occasionally, be wowed by. It's harder to go crazy for, which is mostly because of the singing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sigfússon's voice describes the right pitches, but that's about all-- it's kind of blank. The lack of affect works well when the melodies have a lot of character, as on the nimbly rising and dipping ""Bruises"", or the gently skipping ""Fall Down Slow"". Elsewhere, like on ""Rituals"", the vocal lines can feel a bit directionless, which Sigfússon's voice isn't atmospheric enough to compensate for. If you prefer more expressive singing, this probably isn't for you. But the great thing about music below the virtuoso level is hearing people find ways to work with what they've got, and for Sigfússon to place so much emphasis on the environment around his voice is a smart move. He shines in the studio, buttressing his songs with hairpin turns and enlivening ornaments without getting too baggy and bloated.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are two types of embellishments that Sigfússon emphasizes on this record. At times, it recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13494-fools-gold/"">Fool's Gold's excellent 2009 album</a>, with bright, fluid <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlife"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">highlife</a>-derived electric guitars (e.g. ""Easier"" and ""Slowlights""). A number of other songs, especially in the back half, explore a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/923-castanets/"">Castanets</a>-like beat-folk, with rubbery electronic bass and syncopated clicks and claps, most productively on ""Sing From Dream"", a Baths-like concoction of twee electronica and mulched hip-hop. But Sin Fang folds in plenty of ear-bending texture from outside of these dominant modes, and hardly any dynamic moment in the many-jointed songs goes without a backmasked synthesizer or harp sweep to drive it home. This is exceptionally thought-through music, which makes it lively at the microscopic level but a bit remote overall.</p></div>"|15204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15204-summer-echoes/|6.9|Brian Howe

<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The difference is obvious from the first minute: On opener<span> ""Black Night"" you're immediately reminded just how magnetic Long and Kroeber can be when they're playing like they don't have to worry about waking the neighbors. The sheer physicality with which these two interact with acoustic instruments feels positively electric, a potent reminder that regardless of their unorthodox musicianship, this is above all else a rock band.<span> </span>And most importantly, one that avoids the usual trope of acoustic acts gunning to be forceful (i.e., </span><i>strum harder</i><span>) and plays off each other's virtuosity for whatever form of crowd-pleasing they want, whether it's another chorus for a beer commercial or unplugged psych-rock with the volcanic peaks of freaky companions Akron/Family</span><span>. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Lyrically, <i>No Color </i><span>is a step in a new direction for Dodos-- for mostly better.<span> </span>Catalog highlights ""Jodi"" and ""Fools"" were ultimately both driven by the same gut-level writing that also resulted in some fairly awkward woe-is-the-world accounts, and Long is noticeably more impressionistic here.<span> </span>The upside is in how the phrasing is rhythmically and thematically more locked in than ever with the sonics-- words acts in tandem with the dizzying momentum accumulated during ""Black Night"", while the odd-metered repetition of ""Sleep""'s chorus mirrors the narrator's increasing self-obsession</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For the most part, the autumnal glow is a good look, even if they nail that feeling a bit much in the record's most sedated and less rewarding second half<span>. ""Companions"" and ""Don't Stop"" close </span><i>No Color </i><span>with Long's most pyrotechnic chops and most pedestrian melodies.<span> </span>But in between, ""When Will You Go"" and ""Don't Try and Hide It"" hit an anthemic stride whose subtle build and optimism feel like new wrinkles-- in particular, the latter works in a manner similar to Jimmy Eat World's ""The Middle"", claiming a pep talk about feeling normal can be every bit as effective as one that makes you wonder if you really have a freak flag to fly. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In a weird way, ""Don't Try And Hide It"" feels like a thematic mission statement for <i>No Color</i><span>.<span> </span>For one thing, it's one of several tracks that feature backup vocals from tourmate Neko Case, but the reason I feel comfortable waiting this long to bring up what at least sounds like a huge selling point is because she's, well, kinda hidden.<span> </span>If you wanted to hear her do the force of nature thing, well, that's what Neko Case albums are for, and the way she fits in as a bit player drives home a line from ""Black Night"" where Long confidently sings ""it was never that I was aiming at being someone else.""<span> </span>Whether that's true or not, </span><i>No Color </i><span>is proof that Dodos are indeed at their best when they're simply being themselves.</span></p></div>"|15173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15173-no-color/|7.6|Ian Cohen

<p class=""MsoNormal"">By the time James Brown's last great band slowly collapsed in 1975, it was clear that something was going terribly wrong. Once so far ahead of all of his R&amp;B contemporaries that every new single provoked an international scramble to figure out his new groove, he'd now settled into repeating himself-- ""Superbad, Superslick"" was a drained, brittle remake of his four-year-old single ""Super Bad""-- or, worse, imitating his imitators. The minor hit ""Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved)"" was simply a hoarse JB lyric set to a note-for-note ripoff of David Bowie's ""Fame"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">From the first seven tracks on this volume of Hip-O's mail-order series-- which also include a pair of wretched doo-wop covers and two tedious versions of a University of Georgia football fight song-- you might guess that Brown's career was crashing and burning. (The lengthy funk jam ""Everybody Wanna Get Funky One More Time"", the final release on his People label, sounds like a farewell for which he's rousing whatever oomph he's got left.) But Brown had long since mastered the art of throwing off his cape and rushing back to the microphone just as he was being led offstage.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""I'm back!"" he declared at the beginning of ""Get Up Offa That Thing"", the first record on which he figured out how to integrate his vamp-and-stab funk into the new disco sound. He was rewarded with a substantial hit, and followed it up with a few more dance records that were reasonably solid, if not quite groundbreaking: ""Bodyheat"", ""Give Me Some Skin"", ""The Spank"". Still, the old master wasn't quite at home in the new era-- compared to the freewheeling funk records he was making even a couple of years earlier, they were clenched-up and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So the fascinating stuff on <i>Volume Ten</i><span> is, for the most part, perversely fascinating. A soupy ""Love Me Tender"", recorded a few months after Elvis's death, begins with a little first-take monologue: ""You know--oh, hi, this is James Brown. The Godfather of Soul?-- I wanna talk about a good friend..."" ""People Who Criticize"" (when artists come up with titles like that, you know there's a problem) isn't good, exactly, but it's bugging out with sheer spirit, including a bungled but vehement piano solo and a minute and a half of unhinged scat singing at the end. The Gershwin standard ""Summertime"" is one of the few times Brown's longtime backup singer Martha High ever got to step into the spotlight--although, for Brown, it's an excuse to chatter about how ""I'm just so disgusted, because Mother Nature didn't intend for the things that are happenin'.""</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And then there's ""For Goodness Sakes, Look at Those Cakes"", the most joyful and most ridiculous of his disco records-- an ass-watcher's diary, at a much faster tempo than ""Hot Pants"". (Brown had evidently forgotten how to pull off slow funk.) When it stiffed, Polydor announced that either Brown would have to turn himself over to another producer, or they were done with trying to promote his rusty funk and soggy ballads to an audience that had moved on. The result was an album called <i>The Original Disco Man</i><span>-- an appeal to nostalgia and respect--led by ""It's Too Funky in Here"", his first single with staying power in a few years. Produced by Brad Shapiro, it sounded like no James Brown record before it, slick, modern and rubbery. The voice on top of it retained its force and rasp and pouncing sense of rhythm: nothing could take those away. But the days of his old slogan, ""A James Brown Production-- The Sound of Success"", were gone for good.</span></p>

Which I guess makes me part of the reason this crap winds up in car commercials. Sorry. But that song was animated by exactly how close it crept up to the line of preciousness without tumbling into full-on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/PomplamooseMusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pomplamoose</a> territory, and even if it was only a trifle, nothing else on their first two albums came close to its sugary stickiness.</p>
<p>In fact, Noah and the Whale's sophomore album, <i>The First Days of Spring</i>, deliberately turned away from that sort of thing, opting instead for a glummer, stripped, and slowed-down acoustic sound. If both these albums relied on a certain hand-crafted feel to derive their small charms, new album <i>Last Night on Earth</i> projects flaws and all onto slicker, seemingly bigger-budget productions. Baumbach and the Squid here are self-proclaimed cinephiles, so let's put it this way: If ""5 Years Time"" was their ""Around the World"" clip (cute, catchy, featuring synchronized dancing) and <i>The First Days of Spring</i> was their Science of Sleep (maudlin, sluggish), then the new album is their Green Hornet in 3D-- although that would all assume they had Michel Gondry's appeal in the first place.</p>
<p>The change is immediately apparent on opener ""Life Is Life""; the song begins with a lapping synth arpeggio and drum machine sputters before building up to big buzzing synth chords, echoing grand piano, and-- why the hell not?-- a gospel choir. Everything that follows is equally blown up, and the arrangements are frequently lovely, but the songwriting at the center of it all doesn't exactly merit such widescreen treatment. Over obvious changes and neatly resolving chord progressions, bandleader Charlie Fink sings stock rockisms and bland platitudes: ""Tonight's the kind of night where everything could change""; ""baby, she's a wild thing""; ""you got heart, and you're going your own way."" Fink's singing is fine, but he's abandoned the folksy British accent audible on the band's early albums to settle into a kind of vast, unremarkable singer-songwriter flyover country.</p>
<p>At its best, and on lead single ""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N."", Fink aims for a kind of Tom Petty story-song vibe, with broadly painted characters (""she's a rock and roll survivor with pendulum hips"") and a classic Americana sense of the possibility in the great wide open, even one littered with cautionary tales. The first half of the album is written almost entirely in third person narratives, and it begins to give the album the feel of a world looked at not through its protagonist's eyes but through a camera's lens. This trick holds up enough so that when the album shifts to first person on the flipside, it feels like Fink is inhabiting roles rather than just spilling his own guts.</p>
<p>Even at their best, though, Noah and the Whale struggle to overcome a trying-too-hard odor that permeates everything they do right down to that ill-advised band name. Here, they've lost both the rinky-dink whimsy of their debut (save for a little xylophone melody on ""Give It All Back"") and the subdued strength of its follow-up, splitting the difference to arrive at an album that's as artfully inflated as it is vacuous and forgettable. Believe it or not, it may actually make you yearn for the simpler times of ""fun fun fun"" in the ""sun sun sun.""</p></div>"|15192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15192-last-night-on-earth/|5.0|Eric Grandy

We may already be this screwed, the Builders and the Butchers seem to be suggesting throughout <i>Dead Reckoning</i>. High time we started shouting about it.</p>
<p>The rivers and trains and once-fashionable women's names peppering their lyrics and the old-timey garb they don for press photos further lend the Builders' doomsaying an out-of-time quality. Often, their blood-spattered, Revelations feel-- matched with Sollee's nasal voice and all the rollicking arrangements-- bears an uncanny resemblance of their fellow Portlandic histrionical society, the Decemberists. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15000-the-king-is-dead/""><i>The King Is Dead</i></a> and R.E.M., it's a comparison the Butchers surely could've predicted; hell, the Decemberists' Chris Funk sat behind the boards on their last album. Sollee's voice is a close cousin to Meloy's, less nuanced perhaps but wilder in the big moments. And the band's half-delicate, half-driving acoustic pileup's got plenty in common with their citymates' earlier, less fussy records. It'd be awfully easy to dismiss the Butchers as mere Decemberist-a-likes, but there's a jittery, paranoiac quality to their music-- and Sollee's shouts in particular-- that lends it a very different intensity than even those earlier, more murderous Decemberists LPs. It's almost as though, while Colin Meloy was down in Missoula studying literature, Sollee and company were somewhere deep in the woods, working out the bylaws of their own sovereign nation.<br/><br/>All that might sound a bit bleak, but it's actually fairly raucous, helped along by the Butchers' fondness for big shoutalong choruses and the sweaty live-in-a-room feel of their arrangements. Using two drummers to play a single kit, there's a wild clatter in the uptempo numbers well suited to Sollee's breathless proselytizing. ""We All Know the Way"" imagines devotion-as-lockstep; an ironic place for a singalong, yet there it is. There's plenty of unusually rollicking moments like that all over <i>Dead Reckoning</i>, plenty of morbid lines that feel almost celebratory in their hands. Recorded quickly, with minimal overdubs, <i>Dead Reckoning</i> has an urgency and a sense of from-the-ether evil even in its slower moments; stark, swirling highlight ""Out of the Mountain"" finds Sollee moaning quite matter-of-factly about setting fire to the earth and ""keeping the rain""; this isn't just any old pyro talking, and Sollee's grim lyrical visions are left to linger in this sparse setting.<br/><br/>Sometimes the fervor gets to be too much for them: the grating but mercifully brief ""Blood for You"" is little more than the junkyard clang of the rhythm section and Sollee's stuck-pig shout, and the verses ""Cradle on Fire"" seem to get away from Sollee, who loses the melody somewhere in the back of his throat. But there's few moments when they don't seem to be throwing everything they've got into these performances, and that furious intensity drives them past both rough patches and easy comparisons. A couple of these melodies seem to run together after a couple listens, and at times the music could stand to be a bit more gnarled to match some of Sollee's more sinister sentiments. But even as they scream down the sky, the Builders and the Butchers seem to be having a blast, and it's catching. Should the end of days finds you with a bottle of whiskey and <i>Dead Reckoning</i>, pray you've got a way to play the thing.</p></div>"|15194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15194-dead-reckoning/|6.5|Paul Thompson

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Gary Wilson's first album, 1977's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8694-you-think-you-really-know-me/"">You Think You Really Know Me</a></i>, hinted at a hidden world. Recorded in his parents' basement, it offered the kind of skewed take on saccharine AM pop best made by one lonely, sunlight-starved individual. The few who heard it at the time probably had the same feeling I did when I first heard Ariel Pink, a Wilson fan whose music shares similar stylistic obsessions. When Animal Collective's Paw Tracks label unearthed Pink's <i>The Doldrums </i>in 2004, its bulging creativity encouraged fantasies that there was much more where that came from.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In Pink's case, fantasy turned out to be reality-- the vault he's uncovered since <i>The Doldrums </i>has been richer and more interesting than expected. Things haven't turned out as well for Wilson. <i>You Think </i>kept a shelf life via sporadic reissues and pop-star name-drops, but it took 27 years for Wilson to release another solo record, 2004's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8696-mary-had-brown-hair/"">Mary Had Brown Hair<span>.</span></a></i> It's a good album, but mostly remarkable for how much it sounds like <i>You Think</i> without matching its predecessor's bold singularity. Now, with <i>Electric Endicott</i>, Wilson's well is beginning to run dry.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Not that there aren't some good songs here. But the ratio of quality-to-disposability is not very high. About a third of the tracks play like throwaways-- either ultra-generic piano jazz (Wilson has apparently played with a lounge band for a while) or squiggly, aimless ambiance. While such abstractions merged nicely with his curious tics on <i>You Think</i>, here they're just filler, devoid of tension and unable to tie the album together or give it much texture. <span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The better songs do have their moments. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/911-gary-wilson/1441-in-the-night/"">""In the Night""</a> and the title track both hit a loopy breathlessness that makes them work as odd earworms. And Wilson's love ballads about surname-less women like Sandy, Kathy, and Karen have a nicely unjaded outlook akin to paeans by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1439-jad-fair/"">Jad Fair</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"">Daniel Johnston</a>. But those two are better at turning phrases and adding self-aware depth to their seemingly naïve tunes. Johnston especially can convey raw emotions that seem unavailable to Wilson, who often sounds like he's more in love with his melodies than the girl he's singing about.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Part of my ambivalence toward <i>Electric Endicott </i>comes from not sharing that love. Glittery synth-pop in the Steely Dan/Todd Rundgren vein is a tough sell for me. I find it hard to break through the cheesy Casio-preset associations and the obsessions with technical craft and formal figures that aren't interesting enough to warrant such commitment. Take Wilson's ""Where Are the Flowers?"", whose irritatingly rote chant listing the days of the week is more like kid's homework than compelling music. Still, when this sound is done with edge and freakiness, it can be a unique surprise, which is exactly what <i>You Think You Really Know Me </i>was. <i>Electric Endicott </i>is too often the opposite-- predictable and numbing, even when it's good.</p></div>"|15200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15200-electric-endicott/|5.6|Marc Masters

Collective interests-- even humanitarian ones-- move awfully fast these days (Anderson Cooper has since been dispatched elsewhere), but it seems more important than ever to give Haiti our attention. An overwhelming amount of basic recovery work-- like providing shelter, water, and adequate medical care to survivors-- is still undone.</p>
<p>Here's one way Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy fans could help: spend $10 on <i>Island Brothers</i>, his new two-song 10"" with the Cairo Gang, and your cash will be directed to <a href=""http://www.edgeoutreach.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Edge Outreach</a>, a faith-based Kentucky nonprofit that ""trains, equips, and mobilizes ordinary people in sustainable solutions for clean water, health and hygiene, and sanitation"" (the funds will specifically bolster the group's relief work in Haiti). The two songs you'll get in exchange-- ""Island Brothers"" and ""New Wonder,"" both familiar to veterans of Bonnie Prince Billy's last tour-- are rich and scrappy in the spirit of his most recent work (they'd fit easily on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14088-the-wonder-show-of-the-world/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Wonder Show of the World</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12859-beware/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beware</i></a>).</p>
<p>Under various guises, Will Oldham has experimented with a cornucopia of backing bands-- he's teamed with Nashville session musicians (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/702-greatest-palace-music/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sings Greatest Palace Music</i></a>), made a fuss with his two brothers (most of the Palace Music catalogue), and collaborated with Tortoise (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/705-the-brave-and-the-bold/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Brave and the Bold</i></a>), to start. But his work with the Cairo Gang-- which is to say, with the guitarist, singer, and songwriter Emmett Kelly-- has felt like an especially fruitful era, and ""Island Brothers"" embodies why: Oldham, in his trademark yelp-croon, sings of hard times while Kelly and the rest of the band roll out raucous country-rock riffs, buoyed by swooning vocal harmonies and an occasional horn solo. Oldham might be singing about sadness, but the instrumentation suggests hope, and ""Island Brothers"" is more about support (and community) than unfettered despair. (Metaphor alert!)</p>
<p>""Island Brothers"" meanders to a boisterous conclusion (check the otherworldly howl Oldham emits about 40 seconds from the end), and segues easily into ""New Wonder"", a comparably staid meditation on the perils of good fortune (""What shall we do about the fact that some things/ Some things are so good that nothing can come after,"" Oldham sings over guitar and tiny bits of piano and percussion). It's a sparse, contemplative companion piece, and an interesting-- slower, bleaker-- counterpoint to the record's A-side.</p>
<p><i>Island Brothers</i> includes photographs of Haiti shot by acclaimed <i>New York Times </i>photographer <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/damon_winter/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Damon Winter</a>, who documented much of the devastation from Port-au-Prince (his slide shows, which ran online in the weeks following the quake, are still remarkably difficult to click through). But the pictures are an easy reminder-- much like the songs included here-- to hold what you love as close as you can.</p></div>"|15163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15163-island-brothers/|8.0|Amanda Petrusich

It's a shift at odds with the polar dynamics this Baltimore-based duo has sworn by in its half-decade career. In a 2009 <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/austin/articles/wye-oaks-jenn-wasner,27434/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, <i>The Onion's AV Club</i> asked guitarist/vocalist Jenn Wasner if her band's knack for suddenly juicing volume was done with the live experience in mind. ""</span><span>We won't admit this to ourselves often,"" Wasner said, ""but the way we play live is based on loud-quiet breaks, super-huge jumps in volume and distortion. Sometimes it's really important to explode with huge amounts of volume. Whether it's out of a creative impulse, or just an angry one where it's like, 'Hey everyone, look over here!'….It's fun to absolutely dominate a room for a couple of seconds."" But those first seconds of opener ""Two Small Deaths"" are telling: On this, their third full-length, </span><span>Wye Oak's tendency to smack listeners with giant, unannounced surges of distortion has been tempered. Wasner and Stack have taken to sanding the edges between quiet and loud, gentle and rough, hard and soft, clean and dirty. From there they've crafted their best LP yet.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>It's an awful lot of ground for a duo to cover, but these two have their ways. As in the case of the White Stripes, it starts with Wasner's guitar. While Marnie Stern and Kaki King tend to run away with top honors and attention amongst female guitarists, Wasner's wailing has remained largely unnoticed. <i>Civilian</i> should change that. Whether it's spare, elegant chords like those on closer ""Doubt"", or the corkscrewing figures of ""The Alter"" and Sonic Youth snarl of ""Holy Holy"", she displays marvelous range and power.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Since Wye Oak began recording under the Merge flag in 2008, their combination of boy-girl hymns and dreamy, sometimes shoegazing sonics, have garnered accurate comparisons to the likes of Yo La Tengo. Though they still hew closely to 90s indie rock, their label found a way of describing their sound best as ""21st Century Folk."" That's a big umbrella but it works because one very malleable influence imbues this particular set of songs more than any other: Neil Young. You can hear Shakey in Wasner's storytelling just as much as her guitar-playing, this album's titular track and centerpiece. It's a fingerpicked, relationship still life that slowly expands before erupting into a clenched-fist coda solo that's one of this album's most arresting moments. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But don't sleep on Stack. His time-keeping here is understated when it ought to be and gargantuan when a song's climb requires it, the tick-tocking-turned-feral stomp of ""Dogs Eyes"" rolling both into one. More impressive, however, are the synth elements he adds to each effort; they breathe life into spaces that didn't have any before. I have yet to hear these songs played live, but together, as they are on record here, this band sounds like more than just an army stuffed into a bedroom. While plodders like ""Fish"" and ""Plains"" revert back to extremes, late burner ""We Were Wealth"" does the exact opposite. What begins as a languid, guitar-driven mood piece, blooms into something far more delicious. Wasner's satin vocals lift, Stack couples a key-driven pulse with splashes of delay and crash cymbal, and what we're left with is fireworks of a dozen colors. They have our attention from beginning to end.</p></div>"|15195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15195-civilian/|7.9|David Bevan

On their own terms, these noises might feel jarring and bothersome, but compared to what transpires over the next 49 minutes, they seem like an oddly naturalistic, curiously imprecise element on album that sounds otherwise scientifically engineered to make the Joy Formidable sound like the Biggest Band in the World, rendering traditional metrics like No. 1 chart rankings and platinum records as mere formalities.</p>
<p>After a decade that saw Britpop break down into Franz Ferdinandian funk, Arctic Monkeys insolence, and xx-ian austerity, the Joy Formidable project a certain guileless bravado rarely heard since the mid-1990s. For this Welsh trio, a <a href=""http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glastonbury</a> main-stage headlining slot doesn't represent some distant career goal to gradually aspire to, but a deeply ingrained spiritual state of mind. This notion informs every rocket-launcher riff and back-of-the-bleacher chorus heard throughout <i>The Big Roar</i>, the title of which is but a surface indication of the band's wanton disregard for subtlety. The deliberate nature of the Joy Formidable's aesthetic can be evinced by the fact that four of the songs here first appeared in alternate form on the 2009 mini-LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14170-a-balloon-called-moaning/"" target=""_blank"">A Balloon Called Moaning</a> and have been retooled for this big-league debut on Atlantic. And in some cases rather dramatically: the sprightly pop single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baNMHNblAMU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Whirring""</a> now comes appended with an extended, accelerated and supremely arse-kicking coda-- complete will dual bass-drum triggers-- that suggests <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9qLnmEN7S8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Made Me Realise""</a>-era My Bloody Valentine with a young Lars Ulrich behind the kit.</p>
<p>But with her Corgan-like tendency to slather the songs with infinite layers of grungy guitar gloss, Ritzy Bryan at times comes perilously close to overpowering her own bracing voice, which becomes an increasingly important humanizing element amid <i>The Big Roar</i>'s in-the-red onslaught. It's somewhat telling that the album's massive opener <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONlLmXuZBI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Everchanging Spectrum of a Lie""</a> fades out rather uneventfully after a dramatic seven-minute build, as if the band members suddenly lost their place in its thickening thundercloud of noise and didn't know where else to go. The Joy Formidable are wise to offset their more colossal tracks with shorter, snappier, new-wavy numbers (""I Don't Want to See You Like This"", ""Cradle""), but even in smaller doses, they rarely relent in their pedal-through-the-metal ballast. As a result, songs like the dancefloor-bound ""Austere"" and the slow-motion lurch of ""Buoy"" are robbed of their dynamic variation and definition. The atmospheric late-album ballad ""Llaw = Wall""-- the lone vocal turn by bassist Rhydian Dafydd-- initially marks a change of pace, but even that cedes to an inevitable quiet-to-loud mid-song eruption. (A he-said/she-said duet along the lines of 2010's spirited Paul Draper collab <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq74zstycmQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Greyhounds in the Slips""</a> would've added a welcome new dimension to the sound here.) There's no denying the Joy Formidable's passion, vigor, and pop smarts; it would just be easier to appreciate those qualities if <i>The Big Roar</i> didn't so often sound like a big blur.</p></div>"|15160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15160-the-big-roar/|6.8|Stuart Berman

People lost their marbles. Tickets for an official run of reunion shows sold out at <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/pixies/16117"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a record-setting pace</a>, some dates in less than just three minutes. Their comeback became the first of many during the 00s, defunct or dormant indie rock luminaries like Dinosaur Jr., Superchunk, Slint, and even Pavement returning to stages and levels of attention they had never seen in their relative, pre-Internet heyday. When those Pixies tickets flew off e-shelves seven years ago, Chicago's Eleventh Dream Day hadn't called it quits since forming in 1981. They were and continue to be first-wave, American indie rock survivors whose legacy has become, at this point, less about their music and more about surviving. <i>Riot Now!</i>, the veteran outfit's first full-length in five years is a meat-and-potatoes rock record that goes one step further in explaining why that it is.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, EDD's sound was without frills. Their debut LP, 1988's <i>Prairie School Freakout</i>, was a pre-grunge guitar workout that was recorded live in six hours. The result was as raw as it was visceral, its of-the-moment feel and barrage of classic rock hooks enough to gain them some love from Atlantic, the major that lifers would argue fumbled this band's trajectory. Twenty years after the alt-rock earthquake that <i>Nevermind</i> triggered, that's a common story. But with the exception of the girl/boy vocals rounded out by frontman Rick Rizzo and Janet Beveridge Bean, EDD's sound was equally so. As a teen, Rizzo had learned to play the guitar with Neil Young and Crazy Horse's <i>Zuma</i>, an album whose loud, gutsy, sleeves-rolled-up feel also became EDD's. This is still very much the case and in fact, all of <i>Riot Now!</i> was recorded as Crazy Horse did for a time: in single takes. Be it in face-punching opener ""Damned Tree"" or the squall of ""Satellite"", what you hear here is a band who sounds like they <i>mus</i>t be monstrous in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CefcmIBKF5o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a live setting</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that's to the benefit of EDD and <i>Riot Now!</i>. There's always something to be said about a band who can simply plug in and blow your hair back on any given night. But this isn't a record to turn to for similarly explosive songwriting. Songs like ""Cold Steel Gray"" or ""Tall Man"" boast as much verve as ""That's What Coming"" and ""Sonic Reactor"" do a sense of strong yet forgettable, Neil Young-indebted guitar wankery. That said, much of this record will translate brilliantly to a rock club with one exception: ""Divining for Water"", far and away the high point here, is a fist-pumper anywhere and everywhere. Surprisingly, it's a simple three-chord strummer with far less distortion than anything else here. But there's a depressing, equalizing, Rizzo and Bean-shared line that goes: ""The smarter you get, the less it seems/ That anybody cares about your dreams."" Resist the urge to scoff, because later, atop a blanket of ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-da-da-da's they deliver some salient, comforting truth in closing, ""what's left behind, might be enough/ But it's gonna take a whole lot more than luck.""</p></div>"|15196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15196-riot-now/|5.9|David Bevan

The lyric serves as a mission statement for the record, as Aspegren and Lori Sean Berg spend its 46 minutes tightly editing decayed or decaying sonic fragments into shuffling, uneasy musical statements. Dead drumbeats smack tightly, while vocal tracks are spliced, sliced, and diced until they sound like power tools. Samples of celebrating children mutate into seasick weathervanes; steel drums are fashioned as crashing disturbances. Overall, the mood is harsh and claustrophobic-- a relatively far cry from the open-air post-rock climate of the Berg Sans Nipple's 2007 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9889-along-the-quai/"" target=""_blank""><i>Along the Quai</i></a>. You get the feeling that if you brought that comparatively splashy record into contact with <i>Build With Erosion</i>'s atmosphere, it would curl up, and become shriveled and tan.</p>
<p><i>Build With Erosion</i>'s unstable, fever-soaked nature owes heavily to the pair's experimentation and employment of reggae and dub textures; granted, said textures are known more for  sky-touching looseness than for jarring rhythms and compulsive  self-editing (the latter might explain  why it's been four years since their last record). It's dub's reputation for  static, uncertain dread, then, that <i>Build With Erosion</i> most closely evokes. Aspegren's expressed meteorological concerns in ""Weatherman"" are slathered in echo, as a snapping beat and ghostly tones stay in close orbit, while the electric squeals of ""All People"" honk under layers of shimmered vocals and scuffed melodic vamping.  In a sense, the stylistic left-turn is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Social Scene</a> peripheral member Andrew Whiteman's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/230-apostle-of-hustle/"" target=""_blank"">Apostle of Hustle</a> project, who put out a similarly Jah-jacking effort with 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13018-eats-darkness/"" target=""_blank""><i>Eats Darkness</i></a>. While that record did itself in with self-serious formalism, the BSN are here taking borrowed elements and embroidering them into their own electronically jittery style. In other words, they make it sound natural, a trick that's not easy to pull off when incorporating other cultures' elements into your own musical experience.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's the more traditionally post-rock moments on <i>Build With Erosion</i> that fail to rouse interest. The soft-padded, mallet-led percolation of ""Dead Dinosaurs Rule the Earth"" may contain <i>Along the Quai</i>'s DNA, but here it interrupts the LP's flow; the cooing closer ""Pink Rays Sugar"", on the other hand, doesn't feel like it belongs anywhere in the band's repertoire (it'd probably make good on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/75-american-analog-set/"" target=""_blank"">American Analog Set</a> record, though). Mind you, these sound like complaints, but in a way, they're compliments; <i>Build With Erosion</i> is the kind of enjoyably sound-damaged effort where stylistic intrusions feel like just that, and not much more.</p></div>"|15191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15191-build-with-erosion/|7.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Whether it's to broaden your understanding of an album or find out about some music you haven't heard, we want to know what's grabbing the ears of our favorite bands. This is especially true with a group like Cut Copy, because even more than other current acts, they excel at thoughtful re-appropriation. Like LCD Soundsystem, they're less interested in making that next sound than absorbing the classics and spinning them into something that feels fresh.<br><br>Released as a promotional mixtape in conjunction with the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15055-zonoscope/"" target=""_blank""><i>Zonoscope</i></a>, <i>A Tale of Two Journeys</i> gets right to the heart of the influences question. It's filled with music you can easily tell worked as inspiration for the album-- atmospheric, pastoral pop and patiently building dance numbers-- and shows the band as tasteful crate diggers primarily interested in older sounds. (As far as I can tell, the newest song included is Headman's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-FJ6ch9Fc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It Rough""</a>, from 2005.) Now, artist-curated tapes are pretty common these days, but this one's a little more special since it's built as an actual DJ mix-- tracks are chopped or extended and strung together as they would be for a club set.<br><br>No tracklist accompanies the mix, and Cut Copy were smart to leave it out since part of the fun with something like this is IDing familiar material and hunting down the more obscure cuts. Stylistically there's a nod to the kind of dance mix perfected by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3215-optimo/"" target=""_blank"">Optimo</a>, where non-dance tracks are incorporated when they fit the overall vibe. So in the front half, which is less overtly clubby than the second, you've got stuff like Fleetwood Mac's stomping ""Tusk"" splitting time with sparkly soul-pop such as Shuggie Otis' ""Strawberry Letter 23"". Obviously these are timeless
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
tracks, but they feel a little disjointed here and aren't mixed together with the same care as those in the dancier latter section.<br><br>The mix picks up steam considerably in the second half, and there are some very inspired song pairings. At one point Cut Copy blend Konk's 1986 no-wave disco <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc3Tvmx5HN0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Alien Jam""</a> into the bubbly psych house of A Guy Called Gerald's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivr57dcs9-E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Voodoo Ray""</a> from 1988, and it's one of those ""Oh, duh"" moments you wish you thought of. This section of the mix is the most valuable, but on the whole <i>A Tale of Two Journeys </i>does work as an illuminative (albeit scattershot) look at what makes Cut Copy tick. Ultimately there are more dynamic, more expertly crafted mixes to be found out there, but if you're invested in this band, here's an hour's worth of very good songs that might help you get to know them better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|15187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15187-a-tale-of-two-journeys/|6.8|Joe Colly

This kind of fascination with and demystification of the rock process seems like an orthodox post-punk move, very of its time. But it also revealed for the first time one of the unifying threads in Scritti's career-- an idea that things become more interesting when they're broken down, and that what's on the surface can reveal that stuff, not obfuscate it. As breakthrough single ""The 'Sweetest Girl'"" put it, ""The strongest words in each belief/ Find out what's behind them.""</p>
<p>Of course in 1979 the idea that a motley of squat-dwelling politicos like Scritti Politti might have a breakthrough single-- let alone a three-decade career and a best of package like <i>Absolute--</i> would have been preposterous. The motor for this compilation, as its title and lopsided sequencing makes quite clear, is Scritti's string of singles from their <i>Cupid and Psyche 85</i> album, produced by Arif Mardin. Most were hits in Britain, and ""Perfect Way"" made them brief stars in America too. But even after a string of 80s revivals, nothing sounds quite like them. It's that Scritti principle again, break things up and they get more interesting. This is pop exploded, fractured and rebuilt as a mosaic where almost every beat seems to have a different sound from the one before. Hi-hats, triangles, drum pads of every kind flicker across the mix for a second or two then never reappear. In fact the tracks hold together only thanks to Green Gartside's deceptively light voice and sweet melodic touch, making songs like ""Hypnotize"" and ""Wood Beez"" into exhilarating sculptures rather than a swingers party for drum presets.</p>
<p>Green Gartside's journey-- from post-punk ideologue to minor pop princeling, then into productive obscurity-- is so interesting that a chronological overview seems an obvious choice for a best of. So, perhaps inevitably, <i>Absolute</i> is no such thing. After seducing you with mid-80s glitz, it bounces forward to 1999's hip-hop influenced comeback, then returns to the post-punk source before finishing with new material. This hopscotch approach can work oddly well, bringing out commonalities as well as differences-- when the gossamer ""Brushed With Oil, Dusted With Powder"" jumps into the similarly mazy but far starker ""Skank Bloc Bologna"", for instance. But frontloading the candyfloss brings disadvantages too. ""Oh Patti (Don't Feel Sorry For Loverboy)"", their slickest but also saddest song, gets lost in the sugar rush.</p>
<p>""Oh Patti"" boasts a gorgeously ornamental Miles Davis horn solo, and because Scritti Politti turns so much on Green Gartside's vision and intelligence it's easy to overlook what a fine collaborator he is, with an ability to find just the right partner to make a good track special. There are song-transforming turns here from Robert Wyatt, Shabba Ranks, and Mos Def, the latter on two tracks from 1999's <i>Anomie And Bonhomie</i>. Here Gartside's presence is more spectral, his voice like perfume over a hip-pop fusion which has aged surprisingly well. These experiments worked because Gartside's concern for how a track's components fit also includes his knowing when to drop into the background. But it's a shame that <i>Absolute</i> misses the finest result of Gartside's passion for hip-hop, 2006's ""The Boom Boom Bap"", a love letter to the genre which is also one of Scritti's most enchanting tracks.</p>
<p>To represent 21st century Scritti we instead get two enjoyable unreleased tracks, the fruit of a recent reunion with 80s collaborator Dave Gamson. ""Day Late And A Dollar Short"" finds Green draping himself delightfully over Britney-esque mecha-pop. ""A Place We Both Belong"" matches a soul-searching Gartside vocal to an R&amp;B slow jam bump. This grappling with modern pop could herald an intriguing new direction, or it could be a dead end like 1991's brief go at pop-ragga (represented here by ""She's a Woman""). With Scritti Politti, you never quite know.</p>
<p>But no matter what Green Gartside's next step it's good to hear him still so engaged with current music. He is a publically smart, well-read guy-- a rarity in pop then and now-- and it's easy to focus on a band's intellectual side when one of their most infectious and witty songs is called ""Jacques Derrida"". But Green's gift wasn't just to namedrop continental philosophy. Starting with ""The 'Sweetest Girl'"" he found an emotional translation of it within pop, building catchy songs out of curiosity and doubt, taking the collapse of certainties and turning it into heartbreak. For all its erratic sequencing and missing pieces, <i>Absolute</i> is a joy: It works as a collection of often thrilling singles, but it also succeeds as a history of Green Gartside's open-- minded approach to pop, and of his love of it.</p></div>"|15175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15175-absolute/|8.8|Tom Ewing

It's an easy enough place to envision them, the cosmopolitan, globe-grinding Denver outfit having much lifted much of their sonic foundation from Eastern European gypsy trails that wind their way through the rest of the continent. But that stage was planted inside the Stade de France, an 80,000-capacity beast built for the 1998 World Cup Final outside Paris. DeVotchKa were there to open for Muse, a long way from their origins as a burlesque backing band that spent years releasing records on their own. <i>100 Lovers</i>, their latest, finds them shedding their remaining punk tendencies for a more ambitious, pop-driven streamlining of all the world sounds they've shown interest in up until now. Despite its knowing arrangements, it ends up feeling rootless.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Much of DeVotchKa's rapid rise can be traced back to 2006's <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>, a film whose unlikely commercial success brought the band's score and OST contributions to a much larger and wider array of listeners. And <i>100 Lovers</i> seems fit for the screen. The backbone of ""The Common Good"" is built on South Asian strings, but what they scream most loudly is ""Bollywood."" Likewise, the accordion and spy guitar of ""The Man from San Sebastian"" recall any number of John Barry-scored hijinx. With the exception of ""100 Other Lovers"" or ""Exhaustible"", a whistle-laced strummer clearly aligned with the quirky indie pop sensibilities that synced so well with </span><i>Little Miss Sunshine</i><span>, <i>100 Lovers</i> lives and dies by the high-drama crescendo. So whether they're retreading Slavic ground or playing with mariachi horns as they do on<span> </span>""Bad Luck Heels"", there's a climax to be reached in grand, cinematic fashion. They never fail to reach it. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>That said, DeVotchKa cycle through and marry varying strains of world music with great aplomb. It's very rare that you'll find a seam. But what this record lacks so painfully is the sort of clearly defined personality that an accompanying visual element so easily provides, be it Dita von Teese, Parisian alleyways or New Mexican landscape. Frontman Nick Urata's croon adds a certain amount of shadow and theater to every bar, but it rarely resonates in a way that's connected to any song's core here. In fact, </span><i>100 Lovers</i><span>, with its interludes, clever sequencing, and the appropriately titled instrumental ""Sunshine"", feels less like a grouping of <i>songs </i>as it does an entirely different animal altogether: The </span>film score without a film to call home.</p></div>"|15186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15186-100-lovers/|5.3|David Bevan

Numero Group deserves credit for resisting this tried-and-true narrative in its attempt to introduce a wider audience to Willie Wright and his extremely appealing 1977 effort, <i>Telling the Truth</i>, the only all-original album he ever released. Instead, liner notes authors Ari Leichtman and Ken Shipley sketch a story of a musician who, despite a lack of commercial success, resolutely followed his own muse as an artist and his own whims as a man. This assessment is perfectly reflected in Wright's music itself-- a radical blend of sounds delivered in a mostly laidback, untroubled style.</p>
<p><i>Telling the Truth</i> has its moments of deeply felt poignancy, but its real value lies in its highly creative and endlessly listenable assimilation of soul, pop, rock, and folk signifiers. A refusal to cleave to one particular genre hindered Wright's commercial prospects throughout his career, which found him bouncing back and forth between New York and Boston for most of the late-60s and early-70s before settling in the mid-70s on Nantucket Island. Given that the prevailing sound of R&amp;B at that time was glossy funk and Philly soul, Wright's music is an idiosyncratic marvel. Basically, imagine Lou Rawls fronting Van Morrison's <i>Astral Weeks</i>-era band with a Duane Allman soundalike occasionally dropping by to lay down some lyrical guitar lines and you've got a pretty good idea. Flute filigrees and gently tugged basslines abound, and Wright's earthy vocals perfectly complement the mellow, spacious grooves of ""Nantucket Island"", ""I'm So Happy Now"", ""Indian Reservation"", and ""It's Only Life, That's All""-- the latter two tunes also tossing off shades of Dylan and the Band's supremely contented mid-70s rambles. Much of <i>Telling the Truth</i> is ideal summertime barbecue fodder, though Wright also demonstrates facility with babymaking fare on the casually seductive ""Lady of the Year"" and ""In the Beauty of the Night"".</p>
<p>The final three tracks on this reissue actually predate the recording of <i>Telling the Truth</i>, and reveal a younger Wright who was nonetheless so much older then in temperament. His reading of Curtis Mayfield's ""Right on for the Darkness"" is gripping, but the seriousness of his own compositions ""Africa"" and ""Lack of Education"" doesn't make up for their undistinguished presentation. By contrast, Wright's insights on <i>Telling the Truth</i> proper may be mostly puddle-deep, but they're delivered with such beguiling charm that it hardly matters.</p></div>"|15189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15189-telling-the-truth/|7.8|Joshua Love

Even aside from the fact that the two are already armed with neon tubes, ""Dark Allies"" alone conjures images of futuristic peril. Light Asylum make music clearly rooted in established styles-- synth pop, new wave, and post-punk-- but there's nothing about these four songs that feels nostalgic or pandering. Dramatic, magnetic, and grand in scope, Light Asylum sound like warriors sent from the future. That they've landed here just happens to be our good luck.</p>
<p>Most talk of Light Asylum has been centered around Funchess, and that makes sense: she seems like a star-in-the-making. Having long been a fixture of the Brooklyn music scene, as well as having leant her vocals to the like of <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/telepathe"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Telepathe</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>, Funchess sees poised to make some waves of her own. Light saber or no, she certainly cuts an intimidating, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM3HO6cLF44"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grace Jones</a>-like figure. But even a less stylish frontwoman could get by with Funchess' unique voice alone, which shakes with a coiled energy sometimes reminiscent of the late <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVc29bYIvCM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ian Curtis</a>. Her low register allows her to take on a fascinatingly aggressive persona and to sell the simple and evocative lyrics. When she talks about ""laying hands on you"" on ""Knights and Week Ends"", believe that she means it.</p>
<p>Coviello's synth work and industrial beat programming is the perfect foundation for Funchess' outsized character. The drums sound formidably cold and heavy, surprising in the regard that he seems perfectly comfortable writing recognizable, catchy synth lines. ""Dark Allies"" features a twinkling arpeggio, laser sounds, and an unctuous low-end, but he never fails to reinforce the séance-like quality of the song. And he wields his musical references responsibly: ""Knights and Week Ends"" is a nifty update of Joy Division's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl1SGrUs9DQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Digital""</a>, and  ""Skull Fuct"" opens with the same iconic drum beat as New Order's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1IsJEOVfnw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blue Monday""</a>.</p>
<p>Even though <i>In Tension</i> is a tense and tough kind of record-- at any moment, it feels as if an extra ounce of pressure could crack it in half-- one of the record's best moments is also the most melancholic. ""A Certain Person"" isn't quite the brand of Cure-grade mope you might expect from the title; instead, it surges with a mechanized intensity that becomes almost elegiac. As Funchess' guard comes down, you're able to see all the bruises underneath. Maybe on a full-length release we'll be able to peel back more of Light Asylum's layers, but <i>In Tension</i> isn't ready to reveal all their secrets at once. Consider this a warning shot.</p></div>"|15169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15169-in-tension-ep/|7.6|Zach Kelly

From the release of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA57Pafq_NU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Radio Free Europe""</a> single in 1981 through 1996's <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i>,  the band's most anthemic songs were always tempered by space, restraint, and nuance; even 1994's so-called ""big dumb rock album"" <i>Monster</i> was an exercise in skeletal glam and sly, swaggering pastiche. When drummer Bill Berry departed the band in 1997, he took with him the one facet of R.E.M.'s sound that no other band has really sought to emulate: a nervous, lockstep grid that lacked the momentum to power a grandiose rock band, but gave Berry's bandmates ample room to weave together the  distinctive tones and melodies that have always been the heart of R.E.M.</p>
<p>Since Berry's departure, R.E.M. has struggled to retain both the consistency and the daringness of their first 10 records. After releasing the plodding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6752-around-the-sun/"" target=""_blank""><i>Around the Sun</i></a>, the band attempted a ""return to rock"" with 2008's <a href=""http://cdn.pitchfork.com/media/11308-accelerate.jpg"" target=""_blank""><i>Accelerate</i></a>, barreling through a forceful but generic set and grasping at a raw, aggressive sound that was never really R.E.M.'s to begin with. So, it comes as something of a relief that <i>Collapse Into Now</i> sounds unmistakably like an R.E.M. album. At its best, the album evokes R.E.M.'s best work while capitalizing on the energy conjured during <i>Accelerate</i>. At its worst, it sounds like a career-spanning collection of B-sides.</p>
<p>The most immediately striking moments on <i>Collapse Into Now </i>are those that sound like explicit retreads of previous R.E.M. songs. The minor key acoustic guitar and slapback delay-treated opening ""hey"" of ""Uberlin"" is a jarring callback to <i>Automatic for the People </i>opener <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um2C0uEDDZg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Drive""</a>, distracting from one of <i>Collapse Into Now</i>'s best choruses. ""Oh My Heart"" has all the trappings of one of R.E.M.'s haunting mid-period acoustic ballads, but repeats itself into drudgery. Album closer ""Blue"", with its abstract sing-spoken lyrics and Patti Smith-sung backing vocals, plays out like an awkward and lifeless re-imagining of <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i> single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syCxUN6Lx0Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""E-Bow the Letter""</a>, throwing into stark relief just how unlikely and remarkable some of the band's earlier successes were.</p>
<p><i>Collapse Into Now </i>also hosts some unlikely successes of its own; in spite of its discouraging title, ""Mine Smell Like Honey"" overcomes a water-treading verse and ascends to a truly a majestic classic R.E.M. chorus, complete with soaring Mike Mills backing vocals and jangling Peter Buck guitars. ""Walk It Back"" alone is worth the price of admission here, a gorgeous and enveloping song that takes a step back from the album's dense arrangements and gives Michael Stipe's vocals room to resonate. It's wise, mature and relaxed in a way that's subtly different from anything R.E.M. have done before, and it is quite possibly the best song that the band has recorded in nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>Bits and pieces from every great R.E.M. record are present on <i>Collapse Into Now</i>, but the ease with which the band once combined these elements is now tenuous and hard-fought. Some of Buck and Mills's best melodic ideas simply get drowned out or rushed through, and Stipe often trips over the idiosyncratic vocal phrasings he once commanded so well. A deadpanned ""20th Century collapse into now"" towards the album's end echoes the line ""20th Century, go to sleep"" from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LewYq40Svw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Electrolite""</a>, the last song on the last truly great R.E.M. album. Fifteen years ago, however, Stipe followed that line with a self-effacing ""... really deep.""

Across more than a dozen albums and even more collaborations, Chasny has proven the restless sort who bounces between sounds, structures, and ideas with the curiosity of a precocious teenager. Scrappy meditations for acoustic guitar, epic drone escapades for ensembles, breezy folk-rock ruminations for a full band: Chasny has played it all, sometimes on the same album and oftentimes with mixed results. Some of his most riveting work brushes against some of his most rote, with some of his most inspired pieces settling alongside his most insipid. The discography of the unquestionably talented Chasny, then, has been a fascinating if frustrating listen, where the attempt has always seemed more important than the execution.</p>
<p><i>Asleep on the Floodplain</i>, Chasny's fifth for Drag City since 2005, again finds the Six Organs mastermind eager to roam. ""S/word and Leviathan"", for instance, builds for 10 minutes through layers of dulcimer melodies, electronic rumbles, and harmonium sustains before arriving, in its final three minutes, at a mantra inspired by theology pioneer Catherine Keller. The tunes around it, though, don't even cross the three-minute mark. ""Poppies"" is a kinetic 61-second adventure for acoustic guitar, built on a theme that lends itself to repetition and long variations that come to a sudden stop. The marathon's other bookend, ""A New Name on an Old Cement Bridge"", is another instrumental, but this one's a concentric beauty, where the acoustic melody moves with graceful deliberation over a harmonium drone.</p>
<p>Three more tracks on <i>Asleep</i> are instrumentals-- the cresting opener ""Above A Desert I've Never Seen"" the glowing ""Brilliant Blue Sea Between Us"", and the curling ""Saint of Fishermen"". But Chasny turns in one of his best pop songs to date, too, ""Light of the Light,"" a hummable little hymn to impermanence. As on 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13352-luminous-night/"" target=""_blank""><i>Luminous Night</i></a>, <i>Asleep on the Floodplain</i> again attempts to corral Chasny's range; this time, it actually works, gathering all of his impulses into one of his more accessible, endearing albums to date. On ""Brilliant Blue Sea Between Us"", electric guitar chords drift through another harmonium haze. Chasny's winding acoustic improvisations eventually goad its slow roll forward. Majestic and lumbering, the tune suggests drone wizard <a href=""http://www.wholly-other.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tom Carter </a>collaborating with young British guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/629-james-blackshaw/"" target=""_blank"">James Blackshaw</a>. Mostly, though, it feels like a strong synthesis of Chasny's interests: Despite its variability, <i>Asleep on the Floodplain</i> is like a cohesive record not because Chasny favors any one style over another (he doesn't) but because he feels confident and comfortable with each look. It's as though he's roved enough that he finally knows how to finesse each of his interests into something seamles.</p>
<p>About six years ago, Six Organs of Admittance was something like a buzz band, swept into the rising tide of what was called freak-folk or New Weird America. Devendra Banhart placed Chasny alongside Joanna Newsom, Iron &amp; Wine, Jack Rose, Antony and more than a dozen others for Arthur Magazine's compilation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/549-golden-apples-of-the-sun-compilation/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Golden Apples of the Sun</i></a>, he got a Drag City deal, and his rock band, Comets on Fire, was signed to Sub Pop. But as freak-folk as a fad has faded, Chasny's star has suffered due less to a lack of musical quality and more to a lack of stylistic consistency. He's been difficult to label. Has it been folk rock or freak folk, free folk or just plain folk? <i>Asleep on the Floodplain</i> triumphantly answers back none of those. Rather, Chasny has distilled all of his impulses and obsessions-- slow drones and brisk picking, solemn mumbles and cheery riffs, ponderous lyrics, and ruminative instrumentals-- into 43 muted, marvelous minutes. It's the sort of record that finds the workmanlike Chasny doing what he does better than most, all at once but never too quickly.</p></div>"|15185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15185-asleep-on-the-floodplain/|7.8|Grayson Currin

On <i>Cervantine</i>, their latest, Hacksaw principals Jeremy Barnes and Heather Trost have expanded both their sound and their scope, expanding their sonic search further into southeastern Europe, making connections between what they've heard on their vast European travels and the sounds of their New Mexico home, transforming disparate (occasionally transcontinental) styles into something rich and rousing. Rooted as their music is to geography,  the feelings A Hawk and a Hacksaw conjure on Cervantine are borderless.<br/><br/>In their recent travels between home and abroad, Barnes and Trost took note of an earlier bit of musical cross-pollination: Through Mexican soap operas, the mariachi horns well familiar to the Southwesterners had made their mark on Eastern European music, seeping into the fiery Romany brass endogenous to the Balkan region. You can hear it in the rollicking ""Espanola Kolo"", which matches its trumpet flare-ups with an accordion rush, sounding like two musical cultures speaking to each other. These sorts of juxtapositions are all over <i>Cervantine;</i> the sinewy ""Mana Thelo Enan Andra"" was specifically arranged to feature both traditionally Greek and Turkish instruments, with a stunning vocal turn from collaborator Stephanie Hladowski. Again, you don't necessarily need to be able to suss out any of these stylistic differences or geographical vagaries to dig into <i>Cervantine</i>, but you'll appreciate the expanded palette; their take on Balkan folk, more clearly displayed on their earlier records, tended towards the mournful and histrionic, but their newfound influences tend to be livelier in tone, and the blend results in the band's most balanced record to date, forlorn and lonesome one minute, boisterous and heady the next. <i>Cervantine</i>'s 40 minutes feel far longer than they are, which is to its credit; when it's over, you're left exhausted, as though you've really been taken someplace.<br/><br/>Recorded on a two-track I'd wager has a little dust in the works, <i>Cervantine</i> has the lively, off-the-cuff feel of a field recording, or a pick-up performance from a traveling band. The unadorned sound does a nice job of offsetting the turn-on-a-dime technicality of some of these performances; Barnes, Trost, and their temporary ensemble knock out every one of their instrumental turns, but their virtuosity never feels showy like a more sterile documentation of the same sounds might. When the central melody of hard-charging opener ""No Rest for the Wicked"" drops from a full-band romp to a lone accordion, this inversion of energy proves every bit as thrilling as when they start to swarm anew. Each instrument is played with wit and tenderness alike, and great care has been put into these tricky arrangements. There's strength and delicacy alike in these melodies, be they Barnes and Trost's originals or their reconfigurations of traditional songs.<br/><br/>But what sets A Hawk and a Hacksaw apart from so many other note-perfect revivalists is their passion, which turns up in every note on <i>Cervantine</i>. That Barnes and Trost really love this music is clear, but that they seem almost possessed by it makes for something else entirely. Just as their music goes far beyond mere imitation, their performances seem to push past spirited, compelled not simply to observe or replicate but to create as well, driven by devotion to the sounds they've heard and the ideas they inspire. Though they'd likely be the first to tell you how much they still have to learn, <i>Cervantine</i>'s ravishing exploration of sound is another step towards mastery.</p></div>"|15188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15188-cervantine/|7.8|Paul Thompson

Nonetheless, Cnyce and Elyte have been stirring there for several years now, releasing a handful of singles and edits as well as venturing out on a few tours. <i>Social Experiment 002</i><span>, both the first commercially available mix the duo has produced and the first mix on Art Department's Jonny White's No. 19 Music label, should kickstart a busy year for Soul Clap. (</span><i>Social Experiment</i><span> will be proceeded quickly by a DJ Kicks mix Soul Clap created with New York up-and-comers Wolf + Lamb.) While Soul Clap are arguably the most visible electronic artists from Boston in some time, one thing they are not is a harbinger of a new or exciting style or scene; their success as DJs (and producers/remixers) is predicated on an elegant, elastic mix of house and techno.</span></p>
<p><span>Soul Clap are also not classicists: </span><i>Social Experiment</i><span> mostly features tracks from young East Coast and European producers. They're kin to DJs like Seth Troxler and Wolf + Lamb in their sly funkiness and preference for making folks dance over making a statement. </span><i>Social Experiement</i><span> is not an exercise in momentum, studied repetition, or steadily building toward a climax. They favor quick-striking, vocally oriented tracks over tension and release. Nothing here qualifies as an anthem: even the most melodic tracks tend to be self-contained, or seem so in this context. To borrow a sports term, Soul Clap ""play within themselves,"" never reaching for catharsis or exultation. The mix picks up quickly-- the brief cuts that dominate the early minutes are smart-- and stays tense and alive throughout.</span></p>
<p><span>That might make </span><i>Social Experiment</i><span> sound easy or even pandering, but Soul Clap avoid those trappings. There's plenty of challenging, off-kilter music here. It's just that Soul Clap are particularly adept at spinning it into warmhearted, bright-eyed jams. SECT's ""H.T.A.D."" is a lurching acid-bass track but any lingering salty aftertaste is exploded by Michael J Collins' whooshing, Kraut

-y ""Schizotypal"" (and then extending the bliss with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12129-parallel-lines/"">Night Plane's ""Parallel Lines""</a>). They swing the reverse trick too, leading Benoit &amp; Sergio's silky pop-house track, ""Principles"", blindfolded into Tanner Ross' ""4 U"", a choppy, psychedelic churn. </span>Clashes like these provide the tiny combustions that keep <i>Social Experiment </i><span>rolling.</span></p>
<p><i>Social Experiment</i><span> is a mix without an obvious agenda. It sounds like it wants to make me dance, but it's not pushy. It's not a label showcase or a genre exercise; the only two summary descriptions I can really pin on it are ""fresh"" (most artists here are relatively new to the scene) and ""North American"" (for its creators and their choices: Art Department, Benoit &amp; Sergio, Jimmy Edgar, Lee Foss, Seth Troxler, and Nightplane, among others, hail from this side of the Atlantic). All of this makes </span><i>Social Experiment 002 </i><span>unlikely to represent anything more specific than ""Hey, Soul Clap: pretty good!"" a year from now, but asking for anything more from a mix so contented and hardworking seems in poor taste.</span></p></div>"|15181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15181-social-experiment-002/|7.0|Andrew Gaerig

Curro Fuentes & The Big Band Cumbia And Descarga Sound Of Colombia 1962-1972|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Soundway']|2011-03-09 00:00:00|2011|2016-06-11 17:33:23.766067|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".uyqgo7m328.1.6:0.1.0.$15182/=1$15182.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p><a href=""http://www.discosfuentes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Discos Fuentes</a> is Colombia's pre-eminent homegrown record label. When Antonio Fuentes established the label in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartagena,_Colombia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cartagena</a> in 1934, he also established the Colombian recording industry, and over the course of the rest of his life built Fuentes into a powerhouse-- it's still an independent company today, releasing records at a prodigious clip. Fuentes died in 1985, but his legacy rings through Colombian music of nearly every stripe today. It was Fuentes who produced the first cumbia, fandango, and porro records in Colombia, Fuentes that oversaw the collision of African, Caribbean, and Colombian styles that gave rise to champeta and some of the country's other distinctive musical exports, and Fuentes that provided a home to dozens of the nation's most important musicians. Today, the founder's grandchildren run the label, hosting a massive collection of ringtones, desktop wallpapers, mp3s and CDs on their website.</p>
<p>So building an understanding of Colombian popular music necessarily requires building an understanding of Discos Fuentes, the same way building an understanding of the American pop charts in the 1960s would require learning about Motown. The UK-based <a href=""http://www.soundwayrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soundway</a> label has been to Colombia for two prior compilations, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14423-palenque-palenque-champeta-criolla-afro-roots-in-colombia-1975-91/"" target=""_blank""><i>Palenque Palenque</i></a>, and <i>Colombia!</i>, the latter of which provided a sort of panorama of sounds released on Discos Fuentes in the 60s and early 70s. On <i>Cartagena!</i>, Soundway founder Miles Cleret collaborates with principle compiler Roberto Gyemant and Quantic's Will Holland (who lives in Colombia) to paint a vivid picture of the hot cumbia music stewarded into record by Curro Fuentes, the youngest brother of the original Fuentes family that founded the label. Curro Fuentes produced most of these tracks, and even plays on many of them.</p>
<p>This music bears a heavy jazz influence, and in particular a strong affinity with the big Cuban bands of the immediate pre-Castro era. Cartagena is one of Colombia's gateways to the Caribbean, so the sounds of merengue, plena, and embryonic salsa all made their way there as the bands on this set developed their sounds. Group musicality is emphasized across the compilation, though there are plenty of great, compact solos, such as the supple, trad jazz-informed clarinet lead on Lucho Bermudez's ""Fiesta de Negritos""-- Bermudez was one of Colombia's first bandleaders to heavily absorb the influence of North American jazz in the 1940s, and though his style wouldn't be out of place alongside Artie Shaw, it works well with the chunky 60s cumbia sound.</p>
<p>In fact, listening to the whole compilation all the way through reveals a general tension between the old and what was then new-- they vacillate between using electric and standup bass, accordion, and organ, and electric guitars make a few understated appearances, too. One concession to modernity that's universally avoided is the drum kit. The beats are driven by percussion sections that are a lot of fun to listen to-- checking all the different ways the washboard-like güiro can lock in with congas, timbales, and claves to push a song along provides several enjoyable listens alone. On some tracks, the güiro's role is filled instead by hi-hat on the upbeat, which gives the songs that feature the sound, such as Orlando Fortich's ""Yolanda"", a funkier feel, though none of these tracks strive for anything like what we'd think of as a true funk beat.</p>
<p>That's actually one of the refreshing things about the compilation-- labels focused on 20th century tropical pop music seem to have become much more comfortable in recent years with straying from the Western funk-inspired sounds that originally sparked so much interest in the music of the middle latitudes. 1960s Colombian cumbia has its own effusive charm, and I like that we're getting to hear more of that. Discovering music from outside your own culture is a gradual process of letting go of what's comfortable and accepting different attitudes toward what music should aim for, and a set like this is a great next step for a listener who's ready to move past the old focus on funk and get into a different kind of groove.</p></div>"|15182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15182-cartagena-curro-fuentes-the-big-band-cumbia-and-descarga-sound-of-colombia-1962-1972/|7.6|Joe Tangari

That Sabbath cover appeared on a post-break-up 1996 split EP, the flipside of which featured three songs by a new project formed by ex-Kyuss members Josh Homme and Alfredo Hernandez. True to the project's feminizing name, Queens of the Stone Age, the new material boasted a more melodic, loose-limbed variation on Kyuss' earthquaking crunch. Still, there was little indication that the Queens were going to have any more commercial impact than Nebula, the Wellwater Conspiracy, the Atomic Bitchwax, or any of the other many 70s-styled psych-rock acts orbiting around at the time. The fact that Homme was concurrently indulging in his free-form, revolving-door Desert Sessions jams made the idea of this clean-cut sideman becoming a post-millennial rock star seem all the more unlikely.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Queens' 1998 self-titled full-length has always sounded more like a document of where the band was coming from than a certain prophecy of their platinum-gilded future. In contrast to the guest list-stacked, stylistically varied, conceptually structured nature of 2000's<i> Rated R</i>, and 2002's <i>Songs for the Deaf</i>, <i>Queens of the Stone Age</i> was primarily a two-man effort by Homme-- who handled both guitar and bass duties-- and Hernandez. (Future bassist Nick Oliveri's services are limited to a recorded voicemail message.) Not surprisingly, it's the band's most monochromatic album, coaxing maximum power out of minimal one-chord rave-ups like the opening ""Regular John"", which craftily applies 70s proto-metal riffage to i
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ts avant-garde inverse, Krautrock repetition.</p>
<p>But amid the album's ceaseless bottom-end barrage, you can still hear Homme coming into his own as a singer-- ""If Only"" and ""Avon"" boast silken melodic hooks that greatly distinguished QOTSA from their stoner-rock peers, and which continue to inform the band's latter-day catalogue (see: <i>Era Vulgaris</i>' ""Make It Wit Chu""). And despite the <i>Boogie Nights</i>-esque cover art, Homme's increasingly quirky guitar playing betrays a desire to distance the Queens from pure 70s FM-radio revivalism-- the repeated single-note pin-prick jabs that fill up the last two minutes of ""Walkin' on the Sidewalks"" are seemingly designed to unnerve and irritate any waste cases who would want to use this album as their bong-sucking soundtrack.</p>
<p>Rather than just include its three bonus tracks as random add-ons, this remastered reissue integrates them into the existing sequence, in a manner that actually enhances the front-to-back listening experience: ""The Bronze""-- featuring a pair of amazing snakecharmer solos from Homme-- deftly mediates between the album's more streamlined front end and its more whimsical back half, while the DJ Shadow-esque drum-break freak-out ""Spiders and Vinegaroons"" (salvaged from that 1996 split EP) provides a more logical set-up for the album's bizarro-world piano-bar closer, ""I Was a Teenage Hand Model"". It's not often that padding out an already hefty album actually improves it, but in the Queens' case, the revised tracklist provides a more accurate portrait of how the band molded its mercurial Desert Sessions experiments into chiseled hard-rock monoliths. At the same time, the expanded edition makes the Queens' debut feel a little less like a time capsule, and closer in spirit to the playful sprawl of their subsequent best-sellers.</p></div>"|14964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14964-queens-of-the-stone-age-reissue/|8.0|Stuart Berman

They're a curious hybrid, combining a Lightning Bolt sonic sensibility with a Foo Fighters gift for melody. If you've spent any time going to noise shows in scuzzy basements or dank warehouse apartments, you'll recognize plenty of the ingredients they use: trebley keyboard-squeals, busy drum thunder, bellowed stentorian vocals. But they always put this stuff in the service of huge, meaty, cathartic songs, often building up to the sort of fists-up crescendos that used to move arenas in the 1990s. Parts &amp; Labor have plenty of songs you can hum in a shower-- certainly not something you can say about most of their Brooklyn contemporaries. Within America's noise-rock underground, Parts &amp; Labor are a rare beast: A band that cares more about <i>rock</i> than <i>noise</i>, and a band that actually makes sure their noise pushes their rock harder. <br/><br/>Over the past few years, Parts &amp; Labor have switched their lineup a few times. On their last album, 2008's <i>Receivers</i>, they'd become a quartet, with the addition of guitarist Sarah Lipstate. Lipstate is now gone, and they're back to being a three-piece. But on <i>Constant Future</i>, there's never any sign of whatever intra-band turmoil they might've gone through. Instead, they sound more identifiably like themselves than ever before. The band is fully in their aesthetic wheelhouse here, never attempting anything like the two seven-minute tracks they did on <i>Receivers</i>. Instead, every track has the same combination of blown-out noise and burly hooks, and their blend of those two things suddenly feels something like comfort food.<br/><br/>Again and again, co-leaders Dan Friel and B.J. Warshaw push their heavy, utilitarian voices further than you'd expect by finding a serious harmonic chemistry in their vocals; two of these guys, for whatever reason, sound way better than one. The songs tend to start with a single, simple melodic idea and then layer on from there, keeping their basic buzzing riffs laudably simple. When the tracks build up for a few minutes, they usually extend their guitar fuzz to oceanic levels, but things move quickly, and they never get ponderous. The title track has a shamelessly hooky melody that recalls the Butthole Surfers' fluke alt-rock radio hit ""Pepper"", of all things. And in a different time, Parts &amp; Labor could probably run a chance of scoring a fluke radio hit of their own.<br/><br/>The band has a fun, physical sound, and they never once move away from that sound on <i>Constant Future</i>. That's a formulaic approach to writing an album, but it's an approach that works; every one of this band's albums is worthy of hard-drive real estate. <i>Constant Future</i> doesn't much build on previous albums, stylistically or qualitatively, but it displays a group of now-veteran dudes who know their strengths and who never stop playing to them. There's a lot to be said for doing one thing and doing it well, and that's what Parts &amp; Labor do here.</p></div>"|15183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15183-constant-future/|7.6|Tom Breihan

Based in Ann Arbor, roughly 35 miles west of the techno holy land (i.e., Detroit), Ghostly has cultivated a brand of techno and instrumental hip-hop blended with the sort of IDM, ambient, and synth-pop hybrids coming contemporaneously out of Kompakt, Warp, and Morr Music. ""Hands Up for Detroit"" was both Matthew Dear's and the label's debut single, and it went on to sign notable artists such as Dabrye and Gold Panda. It's an aesthetic defined less by genre than by lush, synthetic exteriors and an insistence on the endless compatibility of different electronic and pop styles.</p>

It's almost uniformly dedicated to inscribing gradual melodies onto glossy, ruffling surfaces. It represents a generation of artists who are closing whatever gap remains between the minimal ends of electronic and classical music, which have always explored overlapping territory with different tools and perspectives. It evenly splits the differences between Brian Eno and Philip Glass, Phill Niblock and Morton Feldman. The field is dominated by the labels <a href=""http://typerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Type</a> and <a href=""http://www.miasmah.com/recordings/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Miasmah</a>, which have a healthy selection of artists included here: Peter Broderick, Svarte Greiner, Goldmund, Rafael Anton Irisarri, and Jacaszek.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Pensive, lyrical fragments of piano are everywhere, from Goldmund's ""Motion"" and Jacaszek's ""Elegia"" to Christina Vantzou's ""11 Generations of my Fathers"": all lovely tracks, though Vantzou in particular should almost owe Philip Glass royalties. It gets tiresome mentioning Glass so often, but he really is the undisputed titan in this realm-- the ambient/classical pacesetter Eluvium, for instance, based his song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aem9NlKm7BE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Prelude for Time Feelers""</a> around a few notes from ""Mad Rush"", which you can hear clearly around the 2:10 mark in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1vMpkIRAjo&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this video</a>. The gaseous, free-floating drones of Manual's ""Three Parts"" credibly recast Morton Feldman as an electronic artist. While Kyle Bobby Dunn is the purest electronic droner here, there is also something Feldmanesque about his ""Runge’s Last Stand"", where he builds massive chords with his usual severe beauty, the top notes straining ever higher.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This isn’t to say the rest of the matrix of influence doesn't matter: Svarte Greiner's ""Halves"" is a dark gust of Angelo Badalamenti-inspired menace, and Leyland Kirby's ""Polaroid"" summons up the molten flow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12546-no-pussyfooting-evening-star/"">classic Eno/Fripp collaborations</a>. The upshot is that these disparate points can now be regarded as the <i>same kind</i> of music, blending together with indie's characteristic disregard for academic boundaries. And in retrospect, it seems inevitable that the elegant simplicity of classical minimalism would spawn a vital indie counterpart in way that pre-modernist classical, with its high barrier of entry, could not.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>SMM: Context</i> also features Rafael Anton Irisarri, a perfect example of this new kind of composer, who exists in an undifferentiated welter of pop, techno, and classical. He's released Gas-inspired ambient house for Ghostly as The Sight Below, while his piano-based <i>Reverie </i>EP included <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQtzkWO1Cg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a cover of ""Für Alina""</a> by the great Estonian composer of minimal sacred music, Arvo Pärt. Irisarri embodies the hybrid genre that we may, if Ghostly's parlance catches on, wind up calling ""SMM"" as it continues to take on definition-- and there's the rub. A compilation dedicated to ""unspooling musical boundaries"" works at cross-purposes, as it can't help but create a new mold in the process. Nevertheless, this is an accurate and often gorgeous snapshot of a loose affiliation of ideas coalescing into a genre.</p></div>"|15180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15180-smm-context/|7.6|Brian Howe

The band may not venture into genuinely depressing territory, but there's a wistful feeling that courses through it. On ""Out in the Way"", head Fossil Dustin Payseur and Wild Nothing's Jack Tatum sing in unison, ""Everything feels different now here without you."" The EP's final track is titled ""Adversity"". Clearly, this is a different look from the band who made being carefree sound so alluring on ""Lazy Day"".</p>
<p>Even though the song is about the moments that make you overwhelmed with happiness, ""Fall Right In"" sounds anxious and contemplative, like it's a referencing a love long since passed. The pensive guitar lines have something to do with the feeling, but it's mostly because Payseur's detached vocals are too plaintive to display the exuberance of romance. There's a similar disposition on ""Face It"", where he pledges to ""give up the city life"" for his paramour. These tunes create an interesting dichotomy-- joyous lyrics delivered solemnly.</p>
<p>The other tunes on <i>What a Pleasure</i> sound like scaled-back variations of themes explored to their fullest potential on the band's debut, which is odd considering how much more collaborative this record is. One of the biggest drawing points on Beach Fossils-- which Payseur wrote and recorded by himself-- was the way every instrument was written directly in relation to everything going on around it. It was carefully arranged in the way a jazz or classical piece might be. Here, Payseur wrote the songs along with bassist John Peña, and it shows. On certain songs, the bassline provides much of the instrumental melody during the verses, which spreads things out a little, but oses some of Payseur's compositional flair in the process. The aforementioned ""Out in the Way"" sounds like the exact midpoint between Beach Fossils
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
and Wild Nothing, which is very pretty but also a little superfluous.</p>
<p>This is rectified on ""Calyer"", where a sun shower of guitar work provides what is probably the EP's best moment. It's a tune that won't catch you as remarkable on the first few listens, until you start to notice all of the counter-melody blooming between the guitars. But this moment is fleeting, and a few short minutes later, the ending of ""Adversity"" is meant to sync right back into opener ""Moments"". It's one of the times where it seems like the songs on <i>What a Pleasure</i> bleed into each other, with the really bright ideas coming in small batches. It'll be interesting to see where Beach Fossils go from here, because <i>What a Pleasure</i> is the type of release that shows they're talented, but still have a little work to do fully capitalize on it.</p></div>"|15161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15161-what-a-pleasure-ep/|7.2|Martin Douglas

Sven Weisemann probably isn't the genre's first formalist, but he definitely seems more concerned with dubstep's particular timbres and constructions than, say, <i>melting your brain with totally bitchin' bass</i><span> or, well, singing. </span><i>The Invisible Insurrection</i><span>, released under Weisemann's alias Desolate, is a studied and meditative take on a specific facet of the UK bass sound that has proved especially difficult to replicate.</span></p>
<p><span>The party line on </span><i>The Invisible Insurrection</i><span> is that it's Burial 2011; this isn't wrong. ""Imagination"" opens the album and it isn't more than about 10 seconds before you hear one of those <i>20,000 Leagues</i>-type sonar bleeps. Also on that first track: dusty film dialogue, dry, syncopated snares, and minor-key orchestral surges. Stop me if you've heard this one before: dubby basslines, pitched-down vocal samples...right, I'll stop.</span></p>
<p><span>Weisemann can pull this off because his productions are so clean. He cut his teeth on deep house tracks and has also worked as an avant-garde composer (still just in his mid-twenties, Weisemann has been DJing since 1997). In each case, his music is crisp, uncluttered, and beautifully recorded. </span><i>Insurrection</i><span> is peppered with the sort of twinkling piano figures that dominated Weisemann's </span><i>Xine</i><span>, but he mostly removes himself from </span><i>The Invisible Insurrection</i><span>, preferring instead to obsess over details. </span><i>Insurrection</i><span>'s sounds never cross or bleed into one another: the drums patter and softly splash, the divas wail in muffled sorrow, and the strings hover. It feels very organized. This sort of nuance allows </span><i>Insurrection</i><span> to pull of the difficult feat of being sonically buoyant while tonally dark. Rather than despair, Weisemann sinks his mind into cinema (see the floral strings and resonant kicks drums of ""Farewell #2"" or the melancholy piano drip of ""Follow Suit"") and craft.</span></p>
<p><span>Burial's </span><i>Untrue</i><span> is a heavy album, one that sits with you, whose depths of emotion demand a certain heavy-lidded ruggedness that </span><i>The Invisible Insurrection</i><span> doesn't have or, quite frankly, need. This might create a paradox for anyone drawn to Burial specifically because he brings so much vulnerability to electronic music. </span><i>The Invisible Insurrection</i><span> doesn't offer this; it instead borrows Burial's signifiers and deploys them in skilled, note-perfect compositions. This lack of subtext is one of </span><i>Insurrection</i><span>'s greatest strengths, offering the opportunity to revisit this music minus the weighty proposition of listening to a legendary artist. If an album of this stripe can be ""fun"" it's that it allows us to re-purpose these sound: </span><i>Insurrection</i><span> doesn't have to be for love lost or spiritual crisis, it can be for riding the train on a rainy night. It's not a blank canvas but it is a potent, uniform gray.</span></p>
<p><span>I'd feel bad about the singularity of this comparison but it's difficult to avoid and, moreover, Weisemann isn't some trend-rider. He's a student of electronic music and a skilled craftsman. That dubstep is his latest project is a natural product of his interests (blurry deep-house, cinematic piano composition) and a reminder that while Burial's influence looms large, few producers have proven as articulate and patient with these particular sounds. </span></p></div>"|15177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15177-the-invisible-insurrection/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

Aw, hey, who cares? What's a guuuii-taaaaar?"" So begins the sharply titled ""On Tour"", a spacious, diary-like explosion nestled just a few minutes into <i>Smoke Ring for My Halo</i>, Kurt Vile's fourth and finest full-length to date. Strings buzz, strummed patterns double back on themselves and from up above it all, the Philadelphia-native showers everything with cosmic, harp-like harmonics. It's a song that's both monastic and vast all at once, the kind of curiously rich work that seems like it was crafted by forty longhairs instead of just one. But Vile has gone great lengths in answering his own question in recent years, finding a way to distill thousands of hours spent with classic American guitar music into one very singular and sublime vision. Whether he's channeling the energies of John Fahey or Tom Petty or even Bob Seger, <i>Smoke Ring</i> makes clear that the end result is his alone.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But to listen to Kurt Vile is to hear him in conversation with himself: That can be said of his ultra-wry lyrical observations just as much as the elliptical, brick-by-brick architecture of his songwriting. In the past, though, Vile's words have been written off as mumbled, unintelligible, and listless-- a criticism made all the more reasonable given the crude recording techniques he employed. But 2009's <i>Childish Prodigy</i>, his Matador debut, found Vile wiping off some of the grimy, decidedly ""lo-fi"" film that had fenced off much of his work up until that point. (Additionally, he brought his sometime touring band, the Violators, into the studio to help fill out those songs that required more brawn. They also appear here.) It was a jump to the relative big leagues that, despite its cleaner approach, offered more in the way of promise than focus. That's not at all the case here. As hinted at  by last year's <i>Square Shells</i> EP, a ""stepping stone"" to where we are now, the sonics and vocals have been spit-polished to shimmer-- every sonorous detail can now be heard in full, and Vile's voice has taken on a new, mountainous presence in the center of each song. The conversation's grown far more engaging.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What we learn is that Kurt Vile has a lot to say. He can be quick, as on the strong-jawed, electric groove of ""Puppet to the Man"", when he opens, ""I bet by now you probably think I'm a puppet to the man. Well I'll tell you right now, you best believe that I am."" And he can yank your heart out, as he does a number of times here, perhaps most memorably amid the celestial fingerpicking of ""Baby's Arms"", when he tries convincing himself that, he'll ""never ever, ever be alone."" But he's actually always alone here. Vile's lonesome brand of melancholia is still communicated both plainly and unassumingly enough to be missed, but its that sense that he seems to be talking only to himself that lends these songs such magnetic pull. Between the two seismic chords of ""Ghost Town"" this album's bulldozing climax, Vile wonders aloud, ""think I'll never leave my couch again, because when I'm out, I'm away in my mind. Christ was born,  I was there. You know me, I'm around. I got friends, hey wait, where was I, well, I am trying."" Although he stretches those last two or three notes, it doesn't feel like he's singing. We're eavesdropping on the most private of dialogs.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Sonically and compositionally, Vile allows us the space to do that. He's still cycling between strummers and fingerpicked mazework, but the battery of pedal effects is mostly gone. Rather than stitch loop to loop to loop, Vile's </span> given every marvelous, carefully placed layer all kinds of room to aerate. In the past, ""Peeping Tomboy"" may have sunk halfway through its bridge, while single ""In My Time"" probably would have lost its way mid-jam. But here, Vile has acknowledged limits in length for the sake of depth. It makes for a full-blown journey. Though there isn't an earworm like ""Freeway""-- that endlessly replayable, interstate love song from Vile's 2008 <i>Constant Hitmaker LP-- Smoke Rings</i> isn't that kind of listen. This feels like a family of songs, one whose complexion and course changes as a whole with every spin. In the closing moments of ""Ghost Town"", Vile leaves us with, ""Raindrops might fall on my head sometimes, but I don't pay 'em any mind. Then again, I guess it ain't always that way."" He knows exactly what he's trying to say.</p></div>"|15174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15174-smoke-ring-for-my-halo/|8.4|David Bevan

Joell Ortiz, Crooked I, Joe Budden, and Royce Da 5'9"" didn't have much in common other than extroverted online presences and an increasing lack of solo options, but their philosophical alignment and mutual respect led to this collaboration. In spite of the dismal sales of their 2009 self-titled LP, these guys <i>do </i>have fans-- most importantly, Eminem, who signed them (along with Yelawolf) to a newly reinvigorated Shady Records.</p>
<p>The <i>Slaughterhouse EP</i> is a stopgap release to piggyback off this bit of positive PR. Problem is, it won't change anybody's mind about Slaughterhouse. <i>EP </i>kicks off with ""Back on the Scene"", a presumed mission statement featuring Dres of Black Sheep. But whatever goodwill can be wrung out of a hip-hop track as beloved as ""The Choice Is Yours"", ""Back on the Scene"" is just more proof that, in the hands of Slaughterhouse, anything can become a charmless headbanger boogie. You get neither the joy or hunger of a newcomer nor the confidence or accomplishment of veterans, just the clock-punching diligence of people who've been plugging away at the same job far too long.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it's more of the same lyrical combat, accomplished and workmanlike but never overly flashy in terms of technique. ""You get more for your money when you fuck with Mr. Porter,"" goes the salutation on ""Sun Doobie"", while the clinical piano plinks and snare claps roll off the same assembly line Dr. Dre and his associates have been manning for the past half-decade. An eight-minute Slaughterhouse track is a daunting enough prospect, and the autobiographical ""Move On (Remix)"" is saddled with overbearing R&amp;B dramatics and maudlin orchestral sweetener. Hardly any individual personality is allowed to emerge within Slaughterhouse's stiflingly narrow topical scope, any hot rhyme (mostly courtesy of Royce) feeling weirdly redundant.</p>
<p>Considering his penchant for unintentionally self-defeating press quotes and dubious rhymes, Sheek Louch would make a perfect fit as the fifth member of Slaughterhouse. Yet tellingly, he absolutely blows them away on ""Put Some Money on It (Remix)"", exhibiting the sort of lovable charisma beyond the reach of his hosts. It's not too much of a problem on the surface: Plenty of rappers pale in comparison to the L.O.X., but once again, Slaughterhouse presumably exist because because real MC'ing doesn't move units. And yet ultimately <i>Slaughterhouse EP </i>functions in the same way the LP did, essentially asking you how much third-tier throwback rap you need in your life.</p></div>"|15115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15115-slaughterhouse-ep/|4.7|Ian Cohen

It reads as though someone stuck a bunch of National Geographic articles in a blender and hit puree. His early musical development was guided by his grandfather, a Jewish cantor, and Carolina Slim, a well-known blues guitarist. That's an interesting mix right there, but he's since established himself as a member of Balkan Beat Box, a collision of hip-hop, electronic music, and Balkan brass music, and during a trip to Mali to play the Festival of the Desert, his blues-based guitar playing seems to have absorbed the sound of the host of Tuareg bands that have recently come to prominence.</p>
<p>All of these influences crystallize into something unified on Lockwood's second album as the ringleader of the Sway Machinery, the Brooklyn collective he's built to execute his ideas. The collective includes players from Antibalas and Arcade Fire, Tom Waits collaborator Colin Stetson, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs drummer Brian Chase, and for <i>The House Of Friendly Ghosts, Vol. 1</i>, they're paired with Malian singer Khaira Arby, who they met during their trip to her country. Arby is one of Mali's most widely respected female singers and has a powerful style influenced by both southern Malian traditions and Arabic melisma.</p>
<p>She fits in easily with the Sway Machinery's funky rhythms, crunchy guitar, and horns that borrow from Afrobeat, American funk, and even a bit of jazz. Her two biggest showcases are among the album's best songs. ""Gawad Teriamou"" is a stomping Afrofunk/desert guitar hybrid with dubbed out horns that she absolutely owns-- her singing has the effect of sparks flying off something extremely hot. She's arguably even better on ""Hey Ha Youba"", a heavy song that hinges on the way Stetson's bass saxophone intertwines with stabbing horns, Lockwood's dry guitar, and a monolithic Zeppelin drum beat. Arby struts through the middle of it-- it's hard to imagine how a singer could do anything else with this backing.</p>
<p>On other songs, Lockwood sings lead, and he has a diverse style that's heavily informed by cantorial singing, a melismatic style not terribly far removed from the Arabic approach that influenced Arby. On album closer ""Shalom Aleichem"", he sings in Hebrew, but he uses the style while singing in English on other songs, which can be a little jarring-- the singing style was designed around religious songs sung in Hebrew, a language that's spoken very differently from English, and the type of phrasing it requires doesn't always wrap quite right around English words. Lockwood doesn't overplay it, though, and the tangled rhythms the band puts together give it a context in which even the more awkward phrasing is carried swiftly along.</p>
<p>The album is structured as a sort of combination song collection and travelogue-- nearly half of the album's 15 tracks are quick interstitials, snippets of women or children singing and camels braying that give the songs a sense of origin in the desert world where the project was first conceived. The House of Friendly Ghosts is never short of interesting, and in its best moments is galvanizing.</p></div>"|15171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15171-the-house-of-friendly-ghosts-vol-1/|7.5|Joe Tangari

Spread over an hour, the set highlights his vast array of styles-- dubstep variations, found-sound collages, 8-bit-influenced electro, anything that could be termed ""purple""-- sometimes all at once. There's an overwhelming amount of material, but <i>First Wave</i>'s chronological progression helpfully showcases the development of this frenetic, though sometimes overly ambitious, producer.</p>
<p>The first third of the record collects songs from last year's <i>Grey</i> EP and finds Marshallsay at his most manic. Opener ""A Statue That Is Perpetually Unveiled"" contains many  different samples running at different speeds-- flurrying synths,  errant ticks and drums, what sounds like a twinkly, forgotten Disney  score. Some insidious G-funk anchors ""Rebong"", while the strangely organic  vocals woven into ""Yoghurt"" suggest there are some ghosts  in his machines.</p>
<p><i>First Wave</i>'s second act focuses heavily on the ""purple""  sound that Bristol's Joker and his compatriots have been fostering.  ""Theatre"" and ""Purple Arrow"", in particular, rely on that sound's tweaked-up synths and refined  low-end. Most of the time,  Marshallsay is tearing everything apart, attempting to cobble  together something entirely different with the debris. Unlike Joker,  Marshallsay jam-packs his songs with so many  different little details that the music becomes  cluttered. There's a sense of relief when he takes the deconstructed route on a few of the brand new songs, crafting two terrifically  ruminative tracks (""The March of the Prince"" and  ""Beaching Loom"") that stand out simply because of their ability to breathe a  little.</p>
<p>There's no denying that Dam Mantle is constantly looking  for ways to shift and alter his sound, often at the expense of a  reliable groove or palatable bounce. But right now, it's more about  exploration and figuring out how things work than just hitting the sweet  spots. He's too busy trying to crack these songs open and shake out what's  inside. Unfortunately, the music often sounds just plain busy because of  it. But<i> First Wave</i> suggests he's close to finding  some kind of harmony. Don't be surprised if he strikes the right kind of  balance sometime very soon.</p></div>"|15159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15159-first-wave/|6.6|Zach Kelly

Their story has been one of gradual maturation: starting out with a rather simple binary-- power-pop collides head-on with barely controlled outbursts of noisy jamming-- and then refining it to the point where their last album, 2008's <i>Shall Noise Upon</i>, felt like a work of real vision even as it branched out in 10 different directions at once.</p>
<p>Cohen's solo work is a little more focused stylistically. There aren't any competing personalities here, and that leads him to a more conventional but still satisfying style that colors sweepingly melodic rock with a country tinge. Some of Apollo Sunshine's chaos pops up in subtle ways, such as the wobbly carnival keyboards that knock ""Pulaski Bridge"" slightly off-center-- these elements also contribute to the album's homespun feel. It's high-fidelity stuff, but it still has an endearing raggedness that makes it feel as though Cohen invited you into his living room. Cohen's self-harmonization recalls the organic, warm imprecision of the Band, and the abundance of fuzzy organ and synth in the back of the mix adds an air of experimentation that undercuts the more straight-ahead songwriting.</p>
<p>Cohen does well when he embraces the cosmic country vibe that colors much of the album. ""Beneath the Reach of Light"" features some of his best self-harmonizing, gorgeous pedal steel playing, and a climactic mid-section that pits his steel against his soaring, distorted guitar-- it's like a highly refined version of Apollo Sunshine's pop/noise approach that more directly serves the songwriting. On the title track, he sings at the bottom of his register and reminds me a bit of Lee Hazlewood, and the song lives at roughly the same stylistic intersection as Hazlewood's music.</p>
<p><i>The Color</i> is ultimately the sound of Cohen exploring what he can do on his own, layering and trying different juxtapositions of instruments and tones while writing some of his most straightforwardly accessible songs yet. His long-time band's flair for experimentation in a pop context is even more thoroughly integrated here-- see the way the main hook of ""The Honest Ocean"" is a bizarrely queasy melody played simultaneously on a guitar and a Moog. It's a good album that manages to construct a unique world in just a half hour, and I get the sense that making it was a learning experience for Cohen.

Thankfully, the group's more headline-grabbing antics are now a distant second talking point to their eclectic sound. Over the past four years, Deerhunter have taken on ambient suites, 1950s balladry, charging krautrock, Stones-esque swagger, and blistering shoegaze with equal aplomb. On last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/"" target=""_blank""><i>Halcyon Digest</i></a>, the final track, ""He Would Have Laughed"", ended abruptly; it's as if the band wished to leave to the listener's imagination what, exactly, their next move would be.</p>
<p>As a studio act, they've played with refracted genre tics, maintaining a penchant for experimentation even while becoming more of a mainstream viability. As a live entity, though, the near opposite has happened: They've gotten tighter, more straightforward, more no-nonsense. The tour behind 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12360-microcastle-weird-era-cont/"" target=""_blank""><i>Microcastle</i>/<i>Weird Era Cont.</i></a> still contained a touch of tension-riddled shenanigans-- one needed only to take a look at the other band members' faces while former guitarist/actual cheerleader Whitney Petty did cartwheels on stage at one of the NYC stops to know how they felt about it. The controlled blasts of power packed within their setlists, though, suggested a band that had shifted their aim from stage banter to stagecraft. During the band's outing this past fall supporting <i>Halcyon Digest</i>, Deerhunter delivered a monolithic set that sometimes ended with Bradford Cox and guitarist Lockett Pundt creating squalls of guitar noise, a move reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>'s infamous squall of noise at the end of live closer ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9qLnmEN7S8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You Made Me Realise</a>"". They possess an air of seriousness now, and when Deerhunter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15453-memory-boy-live-on-late-show-with-david-letterman/"" target=""_blank"">appeared on ""Late Show With David Letterman""</a> last month, one was tempted to use a word previously unassociated with the band: professional.</p>
<p>It's that level of now-unquestionable ability that makes Deerhunter's iTunes-only live mini-LP, <i>iTunes Live from SoHo</i>, an excellent near-equivalent to catching the band live. Recorded the week of <i>Halcyon Digest</i>'s release at the SoHo Apple Store, this 42-minute document is far from the tossed-off affair one would expect from an in-store appearance. Songs with previously tenuous connections craftily bleed into one another, like the dawn-rising transition from the Lockett-led ""Desire Lines"" to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9824-cryptograms/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cryptograms</i></a> standout ""Hazel St."" There are welcome embellishments, like the descending, drip-drop extended intro to ""Helicopter"" and ""Don't Cry""'s dreamy dropout. There's radical reconfiguring, too: witness the metamorphosis of the title track to 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12991-rainwater-cassette-exchange/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rainwater Cassette Exchange</i></a> EP, which sheds its spindly clothes to reveal a gently stomping take with guitar work recalling forgotten <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a> heroes Pale Saints. Every take here sounds as good as the songs' LP counterparts; some of them actually <i>improve</i> on the originals.</p>
<p>This success has to do with the fact that, at this point, Deerhunter are a band that knows how to play together very well, combining each others' strengths to create engulfing chasms of sound. And yet, it's also impossible not to notice how strong Cox has become as a frontman. One of <i>Halcyon Digest</i>'s more left-turn moments was the swinging, sax-led ""Coronado"", and Cox has certainly applied that song's cocksure bravado to his vocal technique since. He exudes a commanding presence on ""Rainwater Cassette Exchange"", toying with phrasing to add drama and tossing in asides where he was previously content to let his voice become just another instrument. Occasionally, he breaks into a higher non-falsetto register, like in the middle melodic turn of ""Don't Cry"" or during ""Hazel St.""'s ascendant peak; the effect is thrilling and easy at the same time, and hopefully it'll be replicated in the future. Bradford isn't just a persona anymore; he's a <i>performer</i>, and here he relishes the notion wholeheartedly.</p>
<p><i>iTunes Live from SoHo</i> closes with a 10-minute-plus rendition of <i>Halcyon Digest'</i>s séance-like closer ""He Would Have Laughed"". The recorded version breathes in and out, trading gusts of open air with jangly darkness; here, the band wastes no time diving into deep sonic depths, creating a tense atmosphere that slowly and gorgeously dissolves like rain on a window. The full-bodied closure extends to the set as a whole, emphasizing an issue that some die-hards had with <i>Halcyon Digest</i>: The songs were ace, but compared to the full-on aural assault of previous highs like the throttling smash-bang of <i>Microcastle</i> capper ""Twilight at Carbon Lake"", there wasn't as much immediate texture. Sometimes, it felt like a part of the band that used to be was missing. <i>iTunes Live from SoHo</i>, then, serves as a reminder for fans that missed out on the last tour and are desirous for thicker sounds: Deerhunter still have plenty of meat on their bones, and if this release is any indication, they're not going hungry any time soon.</p></div>"|15168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15168-itunes-live-from-soho/|8.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Frank Ocean is also known  as <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lonny+Breaux"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christopher ""Lonny"" Breaux</a>, a songwriter who has helped pen tracks for Justin Bieber,  John Legend, and Brandy over the last few years. He's the latest  example of why the major label system is crumbling at the knees of  Twitter and Tumblr, too. After getting signed to Island Def Jam about a year  ago, the label proceeded to ignore him. Until February 16, that is.  That's when Ocean decided to give away his debut album, <i>Nostalgia, Ultra</i>, for free on <a href=""http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/3333587977/frank-my-arms-are-tired-gurl-drop-your"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Tumblr</a>.</p>
<p>Venting  about his decision to drop the record his own way, he took to <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/frank_ocean"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> on March 1: ""i. did. this. not ISLAND DEF JAM. that's why you see no  label logo on the artwork that I DID. guess its my fault for trusting my  dumbass lawyer and signing my career over to a failing company. fuck  Def Jam &amp; any company that goes the length of signing a kid with  dreams &amp; talent w/ no intention of following through. fuck em. now  back to my day. i want some oatmeal and toast. brunch swag.""</p>
<p>The  mini-rant sums up this singer's demeanor well-- openly passionate and  heartfelt, but also attractively off-center and humble. <i>Nostalgia, Ultra</i> finds Ocean singing over a mix of  original pop-leaning R&amp;B beats courtesy of big-ticket producers  like Tricky Stewart (Rihanna's ""Umbrella"", Beyonce's ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)"") and Midi Mafia (50 Cent's ""21 Questions"", Justin Bieber's ""Down to Earth"") as well as some eclectic remakes of songs including Coldplay's underrated 2009 single ""Strawberry Swing"", MGMT's  ""Electric Feel"", and, most surprisingly, the Eagles' ""Hotel  California"". Ocean's experience within the major-label hit machine comes  through-- his casually hook-y voice is akin to Usher or Jamie Foxx's,  and at least three of the album's songs could (and should) slot in  comfortably on a R&amp;B or even Top 40 radio station near you any day now. There  are distinct elements of Drake's melancholic paranoia and The-Dream's high melodrama, too. But there's also a heady surreality surrounding  <i>Nostalgia, Ultra</i> that makes it unique. The cover-- showing a  bright orange 1980s BMW (Ocean's ""dream car"") hidden in plain sight  amidst lush greenery-- is perfectly indicative of what's inside.</p>
<p>The record is held together by tiny interludes named after 1990s video games in which the unmistakable sounds of a cassette player rewinding, fast-forwarding, and stopping are heard. The old-school touch lends <i>Nostalgia, Ultra</i> the feel of a personal, friend-to-friend mixtape  rather than one made by a name-dropping hip-hop DJ. The  impressionistic, fingerprint details don't stop there. On the brief  segue ""Bitches Talkin'"", a loving snippet of Radiohead's ""Optimistic"" is heard while Ocean sincerely laments how ""all bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?""-- not exactly the type of sentiment you'd expect to hear on any sort of R&amp;B album.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO0QwaRJOVQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">adulterous bedroom soliloquy</a> from Stanley Kubrick's <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> can be heard underneath the murderous ""Lovecrimes"", adding a sense of manic dread. The film is once again referenced on the nightmarish, Stewart-produced ""Novacane"", which has Ocean losing his senses in the company of a wannabe dentist/porn star he met at Coachella. And if that sounds kind of ridiculous, that's probably the point; the atmospheric track almost reads like a knowing parody of Kid Cudi's  fame-as-drug diatribes. The shout outs to Kubrick's mysterious and  lusty final masterpiece aren't just artsy braggadocio-- they make sense  within Ocean's trickily complex world, too. Like on brooding highlight ""Swim  Good"", where he steers his Lincoln Town Car straight into California's  crashing waves. ""I'm about to drive in the ocean,"" he sings,  heart-battered. ""I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me."" He lightens up on the self-reflexive pop winner ""Songs for Women"" and the MGMT-sampling  Garden of Eden fuck ode ""Nature Feels"", but, no matter the mood, this songwriter is always  quick to add fine particulars that make his songs <i>his songs</i>.</p>
<p>At  23, Ocean is a few years older than his mostly-teenage friends in Odd  Future. And his maturity is apparent not only in his vastly more  laid-back style but also in how he deals with the underlying sense of  abandonment and rejection that ignites much of Odd Future's bloody,  cuss-laden vengeance. ""Fuck a deal, I just want my father's e-mail so I  can tell him how much I hate him in detail,"" seethes crew leader Tyler, the Creator on the title track of his album <i>Bastard</i>.  Ocean grew up fatherless too, according to his wrenching revamp of Mr. Hudson's  ""There Will Be Tears"", but he handles his feelings differently. ""My  friend said it wasn't so bad/ You can't miss what you ain't had/ Well, I  can-- I'm sad,"" he wails, letting his guard down completely. And the  fact that Tyler and Frank are smart enough to see their thematic kinship  beneath all the aesthetic disparities bodes well for both.</p></div>"|15172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15172-nostalgia-ultra/|7.8|Ryan Dombal

His willingness to take the basis of UK funky into techier, more austere turf meant he could stake a potential claim as a progressive-minded genre-tweaker. Still, all through his previous peaks, you could hear his music stretching, testing itself, reaching for something ahead even as it planted a couple solid feet directly in the midst of a spotlit movement.</p>
<p><i>Bible Eyes</i> is what those earlier singles were reaching for, and as a full-length debut it's a bit of a shock-- the familiarization process of a compelling new artist sped up into a rapid succession of surprising revelations. Earlier singles hinted at clean minimalism and deep rhythmic space, but that sound is significantly starker here. The rhythmic underpinnings feel more in line with Kompakt-brewed minimal house rather than a label that stormed the gates on the back of Girl Unit's colossal ""Wut"". Most basslines are pared down into pure percussion, pulsing like kickdrums instead of dubstep wobbles or electro throbs, but their deepness and intricacy playing off the snares and claps provides the momentum.</p>
<p>In those terms, you get songs like ""Naples"" or the title track-- cuts that seem both propulsively rich and structurally airy. The louder you turn it up, the bigger the spaces between the beats seem, the larger the drums loom, the more negative space to pit your steps against. And in evoking other stylistic side roads that don't slot as neatly into his post-funky precedent-- the Kris Menace-simpatico electro synths in the pop-friendly ""Chrysalis Records"", the straight-up tech house nod of ""Recital (A Version)"", the brooding dubstep of ""Fuji Club""-- he gives those wide-open beats a lot of contexts to sink into your medulla and filter down your backbone.</p>
<p>But maybe the most surprising revelation is how willing Psutka is to use disorienting, inside-out melodies as a front-and-center element. Think of the current vogue for warped and faded tape-jam sonics freed from its nostalgic VHS trappings, made both crisper and noisier. At their most accessible, the fluttering, woozy chords from singles like ""Drive You Crazy"" and ""Everybody Bleeding"" are pushed just a bit further out; the shaky-kneed hook that cuts in halfway through ""Liberation Front"" has the tactile sensation of an aluminum-rubber alloy, all metallic sheen and resilient elasticity. At its most extreme end, you get ""Barely"", which foregrounds a squelching hook so dissonant and queasy-- yet so gravitational-- that it redraws the parameters of what it's possible to make anthemic.</p>
<p>And yet it all falls together in that calculated way bass music albums do when they're simultaneously engineered for headphones and dancefloors. This is an album that sounds invigoratingly abrasive when you're moving and pins you to your seat when you're not, a study in pushing the limits of distortion that works as just plain good club music. And it's eclectic enough to anticipate a half-dozen directions for Egyptrixx to go from here-- odds are he's not out of surprises yet.</p></div>"|15041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15041-bible-eyes/|8.1|Nate Patrin

Who's got time to appreciate hard-earned, time-shaped wisdom, after all, when there are so many mp3s through which to wade? And what is craftsmanship when some dude in Topeka's just landed half a keyboard hook and a little bit of wit in his bedroom, and it's already streaming on <a href=""http://bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>? That's not to criticize the music that's being made so much as the way we've come to treat it-- anonymous bits of data that can be downloaded, scanned, and discarded before the song's actually over. It's all first impressions and quick fixes.</p>
<p>Give <a href=""http://www.sharronkraus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sharron Kraus</a>' excellent fourth album, <i>The Woody Nightshade</i>, a cursory listen, and you likely won't hear much but a pretty voice pleading about old lovers over drums and dulcimers, guitars and autoharps. But <i>The Woody Nightshade</i>, Kraus' first for the Portland, Ore., label <a href=""http://www.strange-attractors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strange Attractors</a>, is a mature statement by an artist who has developed steadily since her debut nine years ago. As such, it should be handled with the same patience and attention with which it seems to have been made. Here, Kraus' tales of love and loss come graced by the wisdom of experience, with youthful impulses tempered by acknowledgement and empathy. The eight-piece band that delivers these tunes alongside Kraus handles them with restraint and imagination, turning her folk-based tunes into carefully crafted meditations. Listen closely, and Kraus' prepossessing songs deliver real-life takeaways.</p>
<p>Kraus has been busy during the last decade, not only recording her solo albums, including 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11997-the-foxs-wedding-rusalnaia/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Fox's Wedding</i></a>, but also collaborating-- with fellow female folk-benders Helena Espvall and Meg Baird, with folk reconstructionist Christian Kiefer, and finally as the superb Tau Emerald with Tara Burke. And, at its best, <i>The Woody Nightshade</i> sounds highly collaborative, like the work of its nine musicians laboring over Kraus' tunes and taking unexpected chances. The glowing drone that opens the record, for instance, perfectly fills the space between Kraus' droll lament and her steady guitar pluck. ""Heaviness of Heart"" is appropriately spooky, too, with madrigal harmonies hanging between Kraus' quaver and the bass-drum percussion of a funeral march. Kraus' arrangements used to be a tad predictable, putting the tools of Appalachian and British folk toward familiar ends; here, in serpentine guitar figures and rich textures, she finds her own forms.</p>
<p>There's nothing complicated or fancy about Kraus' writing, but each of <i>Nightshade</i>'s 10 tunes presents another angled look at love. ""Once"", as its title might suggest, renders a familiar portrait of love faded, coupled with the hope to revive it, while ""Two Brothers"" makes Kraus' heart and head decide between two ""remarkable brothers,"" one fair and one solemn. The title track portrays the struggle to forgive betrayal and move forward, though opener ""Nothing"" attempts to move forward after a lover leaves, like a prisoner finally freed of his shackle. Kraus details love for a young, wide-eyed adventurer in ""Story"", concern for selfish and misguided kin in ""Evergreen Sisters"". These detailed, poignant tales combine to paint a portrait of Kraus as a sort of mentor, a survivor delivering her perils and lessons with a precise pen.</p>
<p>No anecdote or bit of advice here works better than ""Rejoice in Love"", though, a magnetic little pop mantra about taking what you can get and not fretting too much. ""Some people are dependable/ Some people are so likable,"" Kraus sings, her sudden perkiness countered by hints of surprise and cynicism. ""But when we love them/ That's not the reason why."" It's the sort of advice a grandmother might deliver, having lived long enough to know that, though love can be twisted and tragic, it's worth every risk and reward. It's a mature idea, then, the sort that still works every time this worthwhile record spins.</p></div>"|15152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15152-the-woody-nightshade/|7.4|Grayson Currin

While the Purple One's new moniker was willfully inscrutable, the motivation for Elbogen's truncation to Say Hi was obvious: At a certain age, it starts to look a little immature to identify yourself with a ""your mom"" joke (especially while singing power-pop songs about spaceships, vampires, snowcones, and puppies). And so, since 2008's <i>The Wishes and the Glitch</i>, his first as Say Hi, Elbogen has been settling comfortably into indie pop middle age, slowing down his tempos and digging for deeper veins of sad-sackery.</p>
<p>Not that Elbogen has matured beyond pop music's bread-and-butter concerns: girls, the absence thereof, and what to do about them. Indeed, <i>um, uh oh</i>'s best songs stick to the old romantic tropes. ""Dots on Maps"" finds Elbogen typically glum, reminiscing about the past while trying to reassure his girl about their future; it's a gentle but persistently catchy song, built on a simple guitar strum and decorated with a wavering flute and some well-placed glockenspiel. ""All the Pretty Ones"" is a slightly bitter ode, Elbogen grumbling over acoustic guitar and reverbed electric. ""Take Ya' Dancin'"" is about as upbeat as Say Hi get these days, its shuffling rhythm and hopeful melody enough to make the lyrics sound slightly more attractive than pathetic.</p>
<p><i>U</i><i>m, uh oh</i> doesn't stray too far from the path set on <i>Wishes</i> and 2009's <i>Oohs &amp; Aahs</i>, but there is a notable new development: Elbogen's got the blues, and on ""Devils"", ""My, How It Comes"", and ""Shiny Diamonds"", not just in sentiment but in style. On ""Diamonds"" he gives the kind of pinched electric guitar solo that one imagines being played with eyes shut, lip curled, face scrunched into a grimace. Not that you'd mistake the indie rocker for a blind bluesman: When Elbogen sings about having the devil on his back, over a politely grooving bass line and shaky percussion, it's not a possessed howl but a resigned whimper. On ""My, How It Comes"", he sounds hollowed out against the song's organ buzz, heavy piano chords, and enlivening synth coda. Elbogen's voice isn't an instrument of great range, but he knows how to work its sweetest spot, a low, breathy baritone that, on the downcast verses of ""Posture, Etc."" begins to sound almost like Arcade Fire's Win Butler at his most muted.</p>
<p>These are not all indelible tunes-- probably half of them will fade from your memory shortly after a listen-- but they are pleasant enough while they last, and with half the tracks clocking in under the three-minute mark (and the others barely breaking it), nothing on <i>um, uh oh</i> overstays its welcome.</p></div>"|15157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15157-um-uh-oh/|6.2|Eric Grandy

From a producer's standpoint, her inclusion was a no-brainer: Not only was her debut titled <i>Youth Novels</i>, but it captured the intense yearning of youth, which is also an aim of the <i>Twilight</i> series. Few indie artists seemed as well poised as Li to vocalize Stephenie Meyer's heroine's point of view. As the singer herself told Pitchfork recently, ""I like that age when you feel misunderstood and still believe in the pure idea that love conquers all""-- perhaps the most concise and astute explanation of that franchise's appeal.</p>
<p>That is, however, only one aspect of Li's considerable appeal. As vampire franchises go, she has much more in common with Buffy Summers than the shrinking Bella Swan: Li can kick serious ass, yet even at her toughest, she nurses a persistent desire for a normal and secure life, which-- if her second album, <i>Wounded Rhymes</i>, is any indication-- involves intense love, great sex, and weird dance moves. Li proves a rich and compelling character in her songs, which are dark but also complex, contradictory, and, thank goodness, still rough around the edges.</p>
<p>Like Joss Whedon's show, <i>Wounded Rhymes</i> is an album of stark, scintillating contrasts: between fantasy and reality, between the powerful and the vulnerable, between the brash and the quiet, between the rhythmic and the melodic. Audacious anthems jostle next to heartbreak ballads like ""Unrequited Love"", with its simple guitar and shoo-wop backing vocals. Dense, busy numbers give way to emotionally and musically stripped tracks like ""I Know Places"". ""I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some,"" she sings on ""Get Some"", a come-on so blunt that it's become the talking point for this album. As a single, the song brazenly grabs your attention, but in the context of this album, alongside such forlorn songs, it becomes a desperate statement, disarmingly intimate in its role-playing implications but also uncomfortably eager to shed or adopt new identities to ensure a lover's devotion.</p>
<p>Rather than adjust or reconcile them, Li lets all those contradictions ride, having grown more comfortable in her musical skin. While there are no highs here quite as high as <i>Youth Novels</i>' ""Little Bit"" or ""Breaking It Up"" (and no low nearly as low as ""Complaint Department"", though ""Rich Kids"" comes pretty damn close), there is a sense of cohesion missing from that debut, as well as an understanding that a record can be a document of a particularly tumultuous time and place. To write these songs, Li spent long months in New York and Southern California, spending a great deal of time alone in the desert. The result is depressive without being depressing, dark without being bleak, as it rejuvenates, refines, and redirects her eccentricities.</p>
<p>The biggest moments on <i>Wounded Rhymes</i> take the form of slower ballads, whether stripped down like ""I Know Places"" or grandiose like ""Sadness Is a Blessing"". But they gain their power in contrast to the more upbeat tracks like opener ""Youth Knows No Pain"". Dropping some of the coy affectations of <i>Youth Novels</i>, Li proves a surprisingly dramatic singer with a powerful voice and strong phrasing, able to render the emotional pain of ""Sadness Is a Blessing"" as somehow exultant-- a transcendent state of being.</p>
<p>Like any good vocalist, she knows when to bow out and let the music speak for her. ""I Know Places"" cuts off early to set up a long, dreamy coda that acts as both a quiet promise of escape and an album intermission that sets up the penultimate ""Jerome"", which seems to synthesize every single emotional and musical urge on the album. Both ballad and banger, the song sheds its elements until only the thunderous heartbeat rhythm remains. That moment bleeds into the finale, ""Silent My Song"", a nearly a cappella closer that swells and fades dramatically. ""No fist needed when you call,"" Li sings. ""You silent my song.""

<div>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Papercuts' Jason Quever rarely raises his voice. The Bay Area native's one-man project began as a folkier relative to friends and tourmates Grizzly Bear and Beach House, bands also making smeary, drifting pop music informed by psychedelic harmonies of the 1960s. But unlike Beach House's Victoria Legrand's vocal smoke or the high-wire melodicism of both Grizzly Bear's Ed Droste and Daniel Rossen, Quever breathes more than he sings, as though he isn't sure whether he wants you to hear him at all. So when he abandoned more earthen tones for the reverb-marinated dream pop textures of 2009's <i>You Can Have What You Want</i>, we lost a huge part of him. By muddling his mixes and softening his vocals even further, he also made it difficult to know how to position our ears. Toward those long-gone vocals already headed out the door? Or at the impossibly curvy melody that was bouncing on our doorstep? <i>Fading Parade</i>, his Sub Pop debut, finds both coming together in one place. It's his strongest outing to date.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>We can actually hear the difference right away. Though opener ""Do You Really Wanna Know"" chains together a marvelous set of guitar melodies, it doesn't really make its move until Quever slaps his chorus square in the cheek, forcing the whole to thing to jump to life in a way that’s much more immediate than his previous sets of songs. He does the exact same thing with equally impressive force in single ""Do What You Will"", a doe-eyed, auto-harped beauty with a whale of a hook. A small fraction of this record sounds to be free of reverb and delay, major portions of songs submerged for varying amounts of time. That's a lot of Spector-ized, effects-driven atmosphere But it's also an interesting manner of balancing things, as those moments when Quever has a layer of melody come up for air and back into focus-- particularly by way of his vocals-- are what really distinguish this album from earlier Papercuts records. This isn't music that breezes over you anymore.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>In a way, Papercuts' addition to the Sub Pop roster makes perfect sense. While that label will forever be linked with the wet, teeth-gnashing sounds of early grunge, it also experienced a renaissance in the decade just past by releasing extraordinarily gentle records, career-launching debuts from bands like the Shins and Iron &amp; Wine. (Sub Pop snatched up former/fellow freak-folker and Gnomonsong label co-founder Andy Cabic's Vetiver project not long ago as well.) Quever's songwriting and presentation have been and can be similarly non-threatening to a fault. While a song like ""White Are the Waves"" and the rest of this record's too-vanilla middle third still express ""nostalgia"" or ""haze"" or the sort of semi-familiar ache that we as listeners associate with more amorphous and inscrutable songcraft, it's not easily revisited nor is it really capable of sticking.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>But Quever has extended his transition into dreamy territory really well. In fact, there's actually a sharp, almost comforting amount of sonic overlap with new labelmates Beach House here, particularly in the long braids of tremolo-picked guitar that Quever weaves throughout. And lthough everything about their surfaces could be considered soft, all of these songs boast remarkably strong bone structure. The lattice of organ and Fender on ""I'll See You Later I Guess"" or delay-trapped droplets of ""Charades"" aren't just narcotic, they're crushing. It's the quiet ones you have to watch.</span></p>

There has been so much music made and documented in the last 50 years, my thinking goes, that the best we can hope for is an artful re-combination of elements of the past (which seems like more than enough, most of the time). But then I'll come across a new record that sounds like nothing else I've heard: I can't quite place it, but its appeal feels so organic and easy to understand, I don't really feel a need to place it, either. Such is the case with the second solo album from Michigan-born, Montreal-based saxophonist <a href=""http://colinstetson.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colin Stetson</a>, <i>New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges</i>.</p>
<p>A few things about this record make it highly unusual. First, Stetson generally records his pieces solo, live, and in a single take. Some of these tracks have so much sound, so many cross-crossing and overlapping elements, it simply doesn't seem possible that one musician is making them in real time. <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/constellation-records/judges"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Judges""</a> has clattering percussion, a menacing bassline, and a growling lead element that sounds like an anguished voice processed in a strange way. Well, the percussion turns out to be a close-mic'd recording of the instruments' keys being manipulated, the low-end comes from the fact that Stetson plays the <a href=""http://colinstetson.com/images/colinstetson_new-record_new-warfare-history-vol2-judges_2011.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">enormous bass saxophone</a> and has a good sense of how to underpin a tune with a deep pulse, and the lead voice is indeed his voice-- Stetson vocalizing through the horn as he blows. That all of these things come together at once in a piece that is compelling and highly musical is nothing short of miraculous. The key to Stetson's approach is that he uses an array of microphones placed in strategic places-- on the horn, on his neck, on the other side of the room-- and then mixes everything down into a churning cauldron of sound (engineer Efrim Menuck from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=A+Silver+Mt+Zion&amp;search_type=standard"" target=""_blank"">A Silver Mt Zion</a> and producer Shahzad Ismaily had their work cut out for them, and they succeed brilliantly; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5924-ben-frost/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Frost</a> is equally great on the mix). Stetson has also mastered the technique of circular breathing-- playing continuously with his mouth while breathing through his nose-- so that the sound can unspool unencumbered by his body's need for respiration.</p>
<p>The record does bring certain reference points to mind. When Stetson really gets the circular breathing going and unleashes a torrent of notes the climb up and down the scale, fans of free improv might think of solo material by players like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa8PwHm6nvk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Brotzmann</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByduB4Qpoug"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Evan Parker</a>, whose mind-boggling technique is put at the service of in-the-moment expression. But <i>Warfare Vol. 2 </i>doesn't sound much like improv or even jazz, despite our associations of the genre term with the solo horn. These pieces sound composed and carefully ordered, often closer to the precision of classical minimalism than the expressionism of fire jazz. And compared to someone like saxophonist/composer/bandleader <a href=""http://www.wesleyan.edu/music/braxton/abbio.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Braxton</a>, with whom Stetson has worked (if you are a virtuoso on bass sax, you're going to wind up working with Braxton, who greatly expanded the context for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gssdmK6_uc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unusual reeds</a> in jazz),<i> Warfare</i> feels less cerebral, almost like a ""pop"" version of some of those heady compositions.</p>
<p>So there's no prior experience needed here. You can dive in and immerse yourself in the swirl of musical color that is ""From No Part of Me Could I Summon a Voice"", in which Stetson's blast of notes, many per second, are recorded as though from across a vast stone space, each one vanishing into the air in a cloud of natural reverberation. Or marvel at the way Stetson makes a track like ""Red Horse (Judges II)"" sound almost as if it had a breakbeat, the slap of the keys on the instrument so pronounced in the mix you focus on the rhythm first and the texture of the air coming through the horn later.</p>
<p>Reinforcing the music's connection to both minimalism and pop, several tracks here feature the vocals of Laurie Anderson, whose approach is a natural fit with this material. ""A Dream of Water"" features her clear and hypnotic voice articulating memorable imagery (""There were those who lived in the crawlspace/ There were people lighting candles"") over a grinding and relentless arpeggiated figure from Stetson. ""All the Colors Bleached to White (ILAIJ II)"" begins with Anderson's vocal and a swelling chorus of voices and then shifts gears to a hard, noir-ish stomp whose deep tones can easily shake an entire room. Shara Worden from My Brightest Diamond joins the proceedings on a powerful and affecting cover of Blind Willie Johnson's ""Lord I Just Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes"", a mutant, arted-up blues that reminds me of the overlooked album of Ekkehard Ehlers, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8967-a-life-without-fear/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Life Without Fear</i></a>, the way it abstracts a folk idiom and boils it down to a central emotional idea.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the record (and <i>Vol. 1</i> is also excellent, if not quite as varied or powerful), ""Lord I Just Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes"" feels like music I've been subconsciously craving without even knowing it exists. And though <i>New Warfare Vol. 2</i> is easy to enjoy on a purely musical level, as sound, without bothering about the underlying ideas or any notions of how it's made, it's also a gratifying reminder that horizons of musical expression are so much more vast than prevailing trends would indicate.</p></div>"|15166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15166-new-history-of-warfare-vol-2-judges/|8.2|Mark Richardson

No one has to listen to you, of course, but in the best case scenario you not only have the opportunity to make a case for or against a specific work, but you also send a message to the reader-- possibly a musician, if not the musician being critiqued-- about what qualities amount to good art. It's usually quite futile, but if you're lucky and persuasive, sometimes you can nudge the world just a little bit toward what you want. But sometimes that nudging just isn't good enough, and you have to take matters into your own hands and actually make the music that you want to hear.</p>
<p>To some extent, that's exactly what the members of Mr. Dream have done on their debut album <i>Trash Hit</i>. The Brooklyn punk trio includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Adam+Moerder&amp;search_type=standard"">Adam Moerder</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Nick+Sylvester&amp;search_type=standard"">Nick Sylvester</a>, former Pitchfork contributors who have seamlessly transitioned from writing about music to actually making it. (They weren't the only Pitchfork writers involved in the record-- current contributor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Matt+LeMay&amp;search_type=standard"">Matt LeMay</a> mixed a few of the tracks.) <i>Trash Hit</i> sounds like the work of guys who have spent a <i>lot</i> of time thinking about rock music. Its balance of aggression and tunefulness is unmistakably pointed, and the intense physicality of the record comes off like an indictment of modern indie rock's dazed wistfulness and polite, fussy arrangements. The band's obvious reference points-- basically anything having to do with Steve Albini, but most especially the Pixies, Nirvana, McLusky, and Shellac-- seem prescriptive, as if they're arguing in favor of more bands sounding like the ones that inspired them.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Trash Hit</i> mostly follow the basic template for alt-rock established by Black Francis and Kurt Cobain: Hard hitting drums by Sylvester, sardonic yet highly expressive vocals by Moerder, and thick, rumbling bass lines by Matt Morello. Moerder's bitter sense of humor and the band's cold precision give the album a distant, cerebral vibe, but the sound of the music is especially brutal. At their best, Mr. Dream sound like a huge, incredibly smart dude who wants to beat the shit out of you. That said, they can go a bit overboard with the violent intensity. The hooks in ""Walter"" and ""King Klutz"" get drowned out by the band's frenzied pace, while ""Shotgun Tricks"" gets bogged down by a bass line that's just a bit too leaden.</p>
<p>There are moments on <i>Trash Hit</i> when Mr. Dream's approach to 1990s rock gets weirdly academic. ""Holy Name"", for example, sounds as if they are deliberately fucking with their audience by seeming to mash up Nirvana's ""Lounge Act"" and ""Polly"" before going on tangents that call back to the Pixies' ""Debaser"" and Guided By Voices' ""Postal Blowfish"". The song has a bizarre effect-- it plays off of a listener's familiarity with well-known songs like a Girl Talk production, but constantly disrupts expectations by shifting off into something else before settling into a groove.</p>
<p>Mr. Dream have mastered the tricks of alt-rock enough to play these sorts of formal games, but that isn't nearly as satisfying as when they push themselves outside of their wry, cynical comfort zone and hit upon something more nakedly emotional. The Morello-sung track ""Scarred For Life"" evokes tragedy and regret while barreling forward with great urgency, while ""Unfinished Business"" has a bouncy, excited chorus that sounds more like a smile than a smirk. ""Learn the Language"", the album's final track, offers the most promise for the band's future. The song boils their fierce rhythmic attack down to a lumbering heavy metal thud, all the while building up to the record's most powerful moment of catharsis as Moerder belts out the line, ""Heaven is just a zipcode."" All three members of the band turn in their finest performance on this track, but Moerder in particular is a revelation. He's hardly holding back on the other songs, but in ""Learn the Language"" he cuts loose at full strength and it's a total thrill. Consider this a gentle critical nudge: More of this, please.</p></div>"|15170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15170-trash-hit/|7.5|Matthew Perpetua

You know the type: They've been described to you as ""y'know, fun... kinda pop-y,"" odds are you know someone who made out with the drummer, and they're humbly ambitious in a way that suggests local royalty is an acceptable endpoint. At least that was true of the Athens, Ga., group on their Rooney-fied 2005 debut, <i>Catalogue of Generous Men</i>, a document of ""O.C.""-era indie rock frozen in amber, or at least the sickly yellow of Natty Lite. But whether it was due to encroaching national attention, a desire to honor the daunting musical legacy of their city, or both, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12654-all-of-us-in-our-night/"" target=""_blank""><i>All of Us in Our Night</i></a> found them focusing on artistic heft rather than accessibility. They acted as if the two were mutually exclusive, and wound up with not much of either.</p>
<p>The band's third LP, <i>Gramahawk</i>, is pretty much a do-over in every conceivable way. But despite surface attempts to sidle up as MGMT running mates, its sound and scope circles back toward the middle of last decade. It points to a time when Spoon-fed types like Tapes 'n Tapes, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, and Cold War Kids were lumped into a formative blog-rock vanguard that wanted to front like a movement when it was really a retreat. So if you viewed Animal Collective, lo-fi, club music, or hip-hop as serious threats to indie rock hegemony, dive into <i>Gramahawk</i>'s treasure trove of clunky aluminum synthesizers, polite rhythms, and sturdy Modest Mouse-derived melodies. If you doubt their commitment to serviceability, dig how all 10 tracks forgo any sort of wild bender to clock in between 3:08 and 3:55. Or mock the drum machine clatter that underpins the endlessly spooling, deadpan half-raps ""Happy 81"" or ""Under Bridges and Overpasses"" at your own risk-- Cake did have a #1 album this year.</p>
<p>In truth, ""y'know, fun... kinda pop-y"" is a fairly accurate point. Since Modern Skirts are somewhat tuneful without being overly hooky and seem mostly concerned with bum romance and drinking, <i>Gramahawk</i> at least maintains the familiarity and affability of a talkative house party guest. But as such, its tolerability is inversely proportional to its extroversion. Jay Gulley begins the loosely referential <span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWd__w5UWVc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jane Child""</a></span> boasting ""This heart is so gargantuan,"" which itself gives two indications we're dealing with a heavy sense of assumed cleverness. But what's otherwise a nicely arranged hook is done in by his morphing his everydude drawl into a sickly thicket of harmonized falsetto. During ""Glass of Water""'s madrigal drone, Gulley declares, ""It hit me like I was playing rugby with the Thanksgiving Day parade,"" the sort of wisecrack that probably rattled around its author's head until it made sense to nobody but himself. See also ""Shipshape"", which promises a first date of ""a mariachi band and me removing your top."" Still, it's all so inoffensive and eager to please anyway that it's tough to get mad at <i>Gramahawk</i> or anyone who might gravitate to it. You just can't put a price on local charm.</p></div>"|15095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15095-gramahawk/|4.8|Ian Cohen

In the flat he had a <a href=""http://www.moogmusic.com/voyager/?section=product&amp;product_id=40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Minimoog</a>, a primitive sequencer, an 8-track reel-to-reel recorder, and a lot of time alone. Over the course of several weeks, Grosskopf wrote and recorded the material that wound up on <i>Synthesist</i>, which was eventually released on the venerable Hamburg-based <i>kosmische</i> imprint Sky. RVNG has reissued the album, which is held in high esteem among early synth enthusiasts but is not widely known, along with an additional disc of re-workings by some of the record's admirers (<a href=""http://www.pointnever.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, James Ferraro, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/arp001"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arp</a>, etc.) Between the original record and the new versions, <i>Synthesist</i> offers an endlessly listenable introduction to Grosskopf's music that also serves a fascinating window into the sound of a specific time and place.</p>
<p>In the liner notes to the set, Grosskopf writes of how maintaining the Minimoog in the apartment was a nightmare, and that the pitch would go flat or sharp depending on warm and cold it was in the space. He eventually figured out that if he placed a 60-watt light bulb near the synth, he could regulate the temperature enough to keep the instrument sounding good. This image-- of new breakthroughs in sound-making technology having difficulty being used because of the of their surroundings-- is a nice snapshot of where music technology was in the days of analog electronics. These were the sounds of the future, but they still existed in the physical world, where things like air temperature mattered. Sounds hadn't yet been broken down into 1s and 0s, where they could be endlessly manipulated without degradation. So Grosskopf's future music was confronting the same problems that had vexed instrumentalists for centuries-- how to keep the damn things in tune.</p>
<p>The music on <i>Synthesist</i> hovers in an intriguing middle ground between instrumental synth-pop in the vein of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5os8v-MWYE&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early Kraftwerk</a> and more free-form space-drone explorations popularized by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxph3ow9gs0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Schulze</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv2c2hZL1yE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>. The tracks are mostly compact and tend to hum along to a pop-friendly electronic pulse, but they aren't tied into any sort of verse/chorus structure. Because of this, the music has a floating, airy quality, always in motion but untethered by song, which puts even more focus on the glorious analog textures.</p>
<p>The record is divided neatly into two distinct halves. On the first side are the more tuneful tracks. ""So Weit, So Gut"" hovers in a space between Giorgio Moroder's theme from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akyx5iu_z8Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Midnight Express""</a> and a <a href=""http://www.janhammer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jan Hammer</a> interlude for a montage on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UmOY6ek_Y4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miami Vice""</a>-- there's a dark undercurrent pulling the bubbly keyboard percolations into some kind of nocturnal dread. ""B. Aldrian"" in contrast twinkles with nostalgia, with gently shifting keyboard drones that seem designed to soundtrack a narrative about the benevolent wonder of outer space. The title track, with its <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSRCemf2JHc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Popcorn""</a> bass sequence and overlapping melodies, overwhelms with its simple beauty and naive charm. There's a sense of lightness and optimism permeating the tracks on the first side, which forms a sort of argument that the electronic future was going to be a wonderful place.</p>
<p>The second side shades that outlook and delves more in the realm of dystopian sci-fi. ""1847 - Earth"" is built around a metallic drone that establishes a sense of anxiety that is furthered when percussive keyboard sequences come in signaling something tense, almost frantic, while ""Trauma"" sounds like something fizzing up from an underground cavern, the reverb on the synths bringing to mind the dark ambient spaces <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqow8zyLklo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Rich</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUO08Ob1BgY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Roach</a> would explore a couple of years later. Between the two halves of the record, <i>Synthesist</i> offers a complex array of feelings and settings, but it flows together and feels complete. Throughout, is a sense of joy, wonder, and playful exploration, even when the music leans dark, as it often does on side two.</p>
<p>The various versions on <i>Re-Synthesist</i> ask a simple question-- what happens when we translate these textures and ideas into the present? The biggest differences have to do with the presence of steady 4/4 kicks and a tendency to favor his moodier material. So Brooklyn duo <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blondeblondeblondes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blondes</a> take ""Synthesist"", give it a steady beat, and add a harsh alloy to the keyboards. Oneohtrix Point Never's ""Trauma 2010"" has a dramatic drone encircled by orbiting clusters of static and noise. <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/optimoespacio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JD Twitch</a> from Optimo locks the synths into tight little phrases that border on the techno that would come a few years after <i>Synthesist</i>'s release. And James Ferraro's hypnotic ""Wishmaster (Transcendental Overdrive Zone)"" strikes an imaginative balance between repetition and small, incremental change.</p>
<p>For the most part these versions are reverent, which gives the record a nice flow for a disc from various artists set. It's almost hard to imagine a more coherent and logical remix/re-work companion, since nearly all of these artists are already drawing heavily from the world Grosskopf inhabited in 1979. And while I can't imagine reaching for <i>Re-Synthesist</i> very often when <i>Synthesist</i> is handy (Grosskopf's drumming is especially missed), I am glad it exists. It's a bunch of artists celebrating a fantastic record that was a direct precursor of where they are now. They <i>should</i> be celebrating the original record, given how much their music now owes to it and work like it, and so should anyone else interested in the sound of the electronic music that ushered in the 80s.</p></div>"|15165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15165-synthesist/|8.6|Mark Richardson

""The Ballad of the RAA"" aside, <i>Hometowns </i>wasn't entirely autobiographical, but whether giving a voice to remote outposts (""Frank, AB"", ""The Dethbridge in Lethbridge"", ""Edmonton"") or detailing quotidian domestic inertia in ""Don't Haunt This Place"", the experiences felt deeply embedded within them-- the proverbial record it took a lifetime to write.</p>
<p>While <i>Departing </i>can't quite match its bolt-from-the-blue predecessor, it's not for the usual reasons: There are no dubious genre experiments, no interference from a bigger budget, no pressure of serious time constraints. Simply put, the stakes feel lower here, and there's an attendant lack of urgency now that they're no longer struggling to be heard.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, <i>Departing </i>sounds more like an augmented solo project than the work of the full-bodied band that toured tirelessly after the self-released <i>Hometowns </i>in 2008. Which is not to say Nils Edenloff isn't a capable quarterback: While the Jeff Mangum comparisons won't be going away any time soon, he works well within the context of the band's sparely arranged acoustic rock, his pointed lyrics and astringent tone hearkening to folk traditions that go back way further than <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. </i></p>
<p>But for a band that relies on its stage instrumentation, reducing Amy Cole and Paul Banwatt to bit players proves a disappointing and somewhat baffling under-utilization of resources. On <i>Hometowns</i>, Cole's keyboards offered a quirky counterpoint to an otherwise handcrafted sound, while her harmonies maintained a warm conversational tone with Edenloff. But on <i>Departing</i>, her contributions frequently feel like mere cameos. Meanwhile, Banwatt-- a drummer of stunning technical proficiency and inventiveness-- is far too often relegated to mere timekeeping.<i> </i>None of this is true on first single ""Stamp"", the centerpiece that towers over <i>Departing</i>: The desperation of Edenloff's galloping strums matches his cry that ""the hardest thing about this love is that you're never coming back."" Cole leads the whooping holler of a chorus, while Banwatt rattles off octopus-armed fills as if releasing the aggression that's pent up elsewhere.</p>
<p>Although <i>Hometowns </i>felt more immediate, the songs themselves tended to burrow subtly into your conscience. With a low-key charm, the better moments of <i>Departing </i>do the same; ""Two Lovers"" and ""The Breakup"" begin <i>Departing</i> with deceptive titles-- the former is a spare and lovelorn shuffle in which Edenloff bays, ""If I ever hold you again/ I'll hold you tight enough to crush your veins,"" whereas ""The Breakup"" draws specificity out of seemingly mundane details (""Cut a line in the snow with our boots/ To split this city in two"").</p>
<p>The relatively sparse and chilly tone of <i>Departing </i>ultimately<i> </i>feels less like a slump than a conscious decision to present itself as the wintertime counterpart to <i>Hometowns' </i>prairie summer. But in the end, it's sort of like spending a bitter December night snuggling a pillow instead of a person-- if you can get over a certain sense of disappointment at what's not there, it's still quite comforting.</p></div>"|15079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15079-departing/|6.7|Ian Cohen

In other words, chillwave, a tag that plays off of the late 1970s/early 80s French coldwave movement, albeit while trading that scene's bleak seriousness for druggy innocence and relaxed contentment.</p>
<p>The gooey, out-of-focus synths that herald ""Open the Wormhole in Your Heart"", the opening track on Warm Ghost's <i>Uncut Diamond</i> EP, briefly suggest we're entering the dreamily humid terrain occupied by the likes of Neon Indian and Washed Out. Quickly enough, however, singer Paul Duncan breaks the spell with his sternly romantic voice, and it's immediately clear there's more at stake here than Hipstamatic-tinted bliss. That's not to imply Warm Ghost are more worthwhile than most chillwavers, only that Duncan and his counterpart Oliver Chapoy are taking the world (and themselves) much more seriously. The deep-rooted influence of dark synth-pop, shoegaze, and goth-rock will tend to do that for a group.</p>
<p>Warm Ghost's debt to all manner of icy synth sculpters, slow squallers, and brooding crooners is certainly pronounced, yet Duncan and Chapoy do a good job of finding ways to not sound like mere sullen reenactors. For one thing, the artists they evoke are sufficiently diverse musically and vocally that Warm Ghost can touch on several similarly moody genres without sounding like an out-and-out tribute act to any one group (witness how the pro forma shoegaze feel of ""Resignation Rights"" gets undercut halfway through by Knife-ish synths).</p>
<p>An equally important factor is the duo's general smeary, indistinct aesthetic, which is possibly its most alluring strength. Typically it's clear vocal tics and demonstrative melodic lines that are most likely to make a group appear distractingly derivative, but Warm Ghost frequently skirt that problem
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
in blurrily lovely ways, like how Duncan, his words already fairly obfuscated, slips into ecstatic falsetto for the chorus of ""Open the Wormhole"". Or the way drums and synths have just as much prominence in the mix as the vocals on ""Without a Dancer"" and the title track, respectively. In essence, they're applying shoegaze principles even to songs that don't bear any other similarities to that genre. By contrast, the more straightforward pop moments here aren't failures, but they do tend to feel more overtly second-hand, particularly the Xiu Xiu-ish ""Claws Overhead"". ""Let My Angst Unfurl in the Water Like a Hound's Tongue"" (okay, maybe these guys aren't taking themselves too seriously) splits the difference quite well, delivering the structured payoff of pop while still maintaining a sense of disorientation and mystery. The same feat, it should be noted, that the best chillwave also performs.</p></div>"|15164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15164-uncut-diamond-ep/|7.2|Joshua Love

He was only 48. Just a year earlier, he had released an album called <i>Wátina</i>, which brought the music of his Garifuna people to its widest-ever audience. His death left a hole-- the culture of his people had lost its most prominent ambassador, as well as its most important modernizer. Palacio worked hard to bring the traditional music and stories he grew up with to a wider audience, and in the process, he updated the music, mixing the traditional elements with modern arrangements and production. The Garifuna have no country of their own-- they're an isolated, underserved minority in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua-- and as a result, their culture, a mix of African and native Caribbean influences that traces back to the wreck of a slave ship off the island of St. Vincent centuries ago, is always in danger of being swallowed up by the larger cultures of the nations they're scattered across.</p>
<p>On <i>Laru Beya</i>, Aurelio Martinez picks up Palacio's baton and runs with it. Martinez has served his people's interests in other ways in the past-- he was a congressman in the Honduran legislature for several years, and the first Honduran legislator of African descent-- but Palacio's death convinced him that he should commit to music as a way to spread his people's story. He appeared twice on <i>Wátina</i>, but here he takes the helm, and if Palacio changed the scope of what Garifuna music could be, Martinez seems intent on inserting it into the mainstream of global music. He has spent time in Senegal, studying with Youssou N'Dour, and N'Dour appears on the album along with other Senegalese musicians, including members of Orchestra Baobab and hip-hop group Sen Kumpe.</p>
<p>N'Dour sings with Martinez on album opener ""Lubara Wanwa"", and the kinship in their vocal styles is striking. The modern relationship between Caribbean and West African singing styles, born of centuries of complex interaction, is well-known, but it's interesting to hear it put so blatantly on display. Martinez himself has a weathered tenor that easily handles the rapid ups and downs of his melodies. Every song on the album has a traditional Garifuna beat as a foundation, but from there, the songs can go just about anywhere. Horn sections, guests singers, and small choirs, electric guitars, keyboards, and bass all make appearances, and the net result is an album that feels very much in the spirit of recent efforts by Manu Chao and Amadou &amp; Mariam, records that build off the music of specific places to create an overall sound that's essentially placeless.</p>
<p>Placelessness actually becomes a theme on the album, too, particularly on ""Yurumei"". Yurumei is the Garifuna word for St. Vincent, the island across the Caribbean from the current Garifuna homeland where their culture originally arose. That's where the slave ship wrecked and the survivors mingled with the local population-- they came to live on the east coast of Central America after they were violently expelled by the British, who then colonized St. Vincent themselves. Palacio sang about it, too, and that melancholy, nostalgic sense of loss seems to be a thread running through the music. Martinez may not be able to right the wrongs of the past, but he does Palacio's legacy proud on <i>Laru Beya</i>. And by bringing this music to a world stage, he may also help secure his people's cultural future.</p></div>"|15133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15133-laru-beya/|7.8|Joe Tangari

She strummed stoically, rarely speaking between songs or addressing the audience directly. The shows were short, sweet, and intense, even if the frontwoman came across as slightly detached. It was, she said, a stance born of her stage fright, and it worked only because her songs were so catchy and excitably noisy. Claiming the stage for herself, she conveyed a sense of calm and content, which suited her tales about the thrills of monogamy and devotion.</p>
<p>The title of that album implied a theme of transformation and realization, and in 2010, Dee Dee took her first steps toward becoming a more dynamic performer, harnessing her stage fright into a viable stage presence. That development continues on her new EP, <i>He Gets Me High</i>, a collection of four tracks that reveal the extent of her talent and range. The band's musical palette is larger and more sophisticated than that on <i>I Will Be</i>, and they make more dramatic and idiosyncratic use of the influences they wear on their sleeves. Just shy of 14 minutes, this EP further distinguishes Dum Dum Girls from the other bands drawing from this same well of fuzz-pop influences.</p>
<p>Produced by Dee Dee with the Raveonettes' Sune Rose Wagner and music mogul/songwriter Richard Gottehrer (co-founder of Sire Records and co-writer of 60s girl-group staples ""My Boyfriend's Back"" and ""I Want Candy"" fame),<i> He Gets Me High</i> runs a pretty wide range of moods and emotions considering its brief runtime. The energetic ""Wrong Feels Right"" finds guitars and drums racing exuberantly toward a finish line like dragsters down a deserted highway. Waves of staticky distortion open the title track, which initially echoes ""Bhang Bhang, I'm a Burnout"" before veering off in other directions. And ""Take Care of My Baby"" is an exquisitely mopey farewell to a lover that could be a tour diary.</p>
<p>With <i>I Will Be</i>, the talking point was the Dum Dum Girls' raw sound, a combination of girl-group melodies and fuzzed-out Jesus and Mary Chain guitars, but Dee Dee is a careful, intuitive songwriter, evoking complex emotions with an economy of words. <i>He Gets Me High</i> traces the arc of an intense affair, starting with the shimmery excitement of a first night together and ending with the painful separation, with a lusty ode to a lover's narcotic effect in between.</p>
<p>And then there's the sped-up cover of the Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", which Dee Dee sings as an epilogue to the previous tracks. It's a testament to the EP's sequencing and the band's rush of guitars that she can perform a done-to-death cover and still make it sound fresh and interesting, with a barreling tempo, grandiose guitars, and Dee Dee delivering those super-wry lyrics. You couldn't pick a more obvious choice from Morrissey's catalog (either from his Smiths years or his solo years), and while it might have been more interesting to her take on a song like ""I Started Something I Couldn't Finish"" or ""You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side"", it's likely she chose this particular song to fit the EP's narrative.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy development on <i>He Gets Me High</i> is how Dee Dee is using her voice. Shedding the rough filter of the band's earlier material, she sounds much more expressive and engaged. Whether investing a love=drug metaphor with new urgency on the title track or practically breaking down on ""Take Care of My Baby""-- she wrings so much evocative pain out of the word ""take""-- Dee Dee recalls the brassy authority of Chrissie Hynde and the sharp emotionalism of Kate Bush. She's a commanding presence on these songs, showing more poise and nuance than she has in the past. Rare is the EP that sounds so crucial to an artist's catalog and narrative, but it won't be surprising to look back on this release in a few years and see it as pivotal in Dum Dum Girls' career.</p></div>"|15156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15156-he-gets-me-high-ep/|8.1|Stephen M.

While none of these signifiers seem to directly shape her music, Calvi's record feels like it has much in common with cinema and literature. She uses sonic textures to evoke feelings-- from spaghetti-western guitars to her lung-busting take on gothic melodrama. Musically she's indebted to a lineage of female songwriters from Edith Piaf and Patti Smith to PJ Harvey.</p>
<p>The latter comparison is bolstered by the appearance of longtime Harvey collaborator Rob Ellis on production duties. His rangy, atmospheric handling of the music is one of the record's standout qualities. While the sound is suitably bombastic, Ellis also takes care to open up enough emptiness in the mix to allow Calvi's twisting guitar to snake with menace. On the strongest moments, such as ""No More Words"", Calvi pushes herself into darker territory, as Ellis allows cavernous space to open up, her voice and guitar sounding as if they are being played into a black hole. It's also one of the softest songs on the record, crafting a coiled feeling when Calvi's voice quietens to a whisper, hanging like a thread but never snapping. The restraint has an edge to it that feels provocative.</p>
<p>Still there are moments where Calvi ratchets up the drama too readily, and sometimes hams it up-- see ""I'll Be Your Man"", which comes across as campy. More often than not, however, Calvi gets the balance right: ""Suzanne and I"" feels grand as it lurches from bare guitars underpinned by pounding drums into a skeletal breakdown. The delicacy of its second half-- ghostly, yearning singing and spacey fingerpicking-- makes for a bigger payoff when the drums kick back in and her guitar doubles the vocal lines, giving the ending a truly anthemic quality.</p>
<p>On much of the record Calvi explores the pained romanticism of goth with references to the devil, darkness, and unrequited love. These passing allusions are reduced into something elemental on ""Desire"", with its impassioned wail against loneliness, as Calvi sings, ""You don't have to be lost""; it's a rare moment of togetherness and empathy on an album where Calvi can sometimes seem cold. She dresses up in the same outer strength as Piaf often did, but without the same sense of underlying vulnerability.</p>
<p>Calvi's outstanding vocal tone and arrangements carry the emotional punches, while her lyrics can occasionally take a backseat role. She never allows herself to sound truly exposed, and this adds to a sense that, for all its perceived boldness and big climaxes, the record never seems unhinged or fragile. It can sometimes feel more like a series of controlled demolitions than something from the gut. But once you accept these shortcomings and give yourself over to Calvi's wall of theater, there are plenty of excellent moments to lose yourself in.</p></div>"|15153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15153-anna-calvi/|7.8|Hari Ashurst

But life has a way of intervening, and in the case of Eulogies' ringleader Peter Walker, it was an unfortunate turn of events: Walker's best friend lost his four-year-old boy to cancer, just after the birth of Walker's own child. And Eulogies third album, <i>Tear the Fences Down</i>, was written with him in mind.</p>
<p>The irony that a band called Eulogies has now crafted something of eulogy is likely not lost on Walker, though he certainly doesn't let on. <i>Tear Down the Fences</i>, while elegiac in its own way, is by far the most varied, energetic record Eulogies have made to date, abandoning their mopey moves in favor of sharp, densely arranged indie pop songs that shine brighter the less straightforward they are. Opening track ""Out of Style, Out of Touch"" rumbles with the perky energy of a Vampire Weekend tune, while the tumbling ""You Hide"" could be a lost cut from Eels' <i>Daisies of the Galaxy</i>. In fact, Walker even sounds like Mr. E on many of the songs here, which seems fitting, as the Eels frontman is no stranger to grief. But unlike so many Eels records, <i>Tear the Fences Down</i> is near pitiless, while the entanglement of emotions is still evident. ""Will I"" is coldly detached, Walker's voice hanging like a ghost over the robust, almost aggressive clatter of the band underneath. ""How to Say Goodbye"", probably the most beautiful, affecting song here, boasts a chorus of gorgeous, free-fall vocal harmonies.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Tear the Fences Down</i> is so lyrically ambiguous that ""How to Say Goodbye"" could easily be about a girl. But Walker doesn't seem interested in spelling things out-- this is a record made with a select few people in mind, and that intimacy makes it engaging. Only on two tracks does he address the tragedy head-on, from two unique perspectives. ""Separate Heart"" is paranoid and jaunty, with Walker singing, ""I'm boxed in my happiness, I'm falling down/ I want to surrender, but I don't know how."" It's a weirdly helpless confession; in the face of another's tragedy, he's confronting the difficulty of finding happiness in his own new parenthood. But most of the conflicted feelings, fears, and regrets expressed on <i>Tear the Fences Down</i> are calmed by closing track ""Little Else to Say"", a simply stated epilogue. Clearly a children's song, it's an autobiographical account of the slowed process of overcoming loss-- a big idea written for small people but, like a good portion of <i>Tear the Fences Down</i>, one that registers across the board.</p></div>"|15127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15127-tear-the-fences-down/|6.7|Zach Kelly

Playing fast and loose, Mind Spiders exist in a universe where the Flaming Sideburns never crumbled under the weight of garage rock revival excitement, where pulse-quickening legends Jay Reatard and (fellow Dirtnap Records alums) the Exploding Hearts never met their tragic ends. The songs on<i> Mind Spiders</i> are energetic but not in-your-face, fun but not goofy, sharp but not stifled, wild but not boorish. In essence, it's a rock record that pulls no punches, and it's all the more endearing because of it.</p>
<p>Mind Spiders define their sound right out of the gate, sporting tightly-wound, zoetropic riffs that sound blasted from sand-filled amps. There's also a touch of B-movie fetishism thrown in-- sci-fi sound effects are not just fillers; they carry melodies, with mummy-movie organs and squiggly ray-gun feedback contributing some <i>Plan 9 </i>camp. Add a little glammy pomp and a healthy amount of the Ramones' bop, and you've got a ripping collection of songs.</p>
<p>When Ryan branches out a little, the results are equally appealing. ""Read Your Mind"" is a soft-waltzing ballad, reminiscent of the kind of 1950s slow-dance moves that plenty of lo-fi dabblers have shown a weakness for recently. But like the rest of <i>Mind Spiders</i>, there's something simple and genuine about the approach-- when Ryan is whooping it up, he's isn't thumbing his nose at anyone. Conversely, when he slows things down or tries on a little psych-channeled blues (""Slippin' And Slidin'""), you don't get the sense he's mining for cheap nostalgia.</p>
<p>Ultimately,<i> Mind Spiders</i> is tailor-made for those of us who value that four-on-the-floor reverie above all else. ""Don't Let Her Go"" feels akin to Reatard's <i>Blood Visions</i> with a pop-smart bent, and ""Neurotic Gold"" is... exactly that. ""One Step Ahead"" embodies the broken heart at punk's center, taking a crestfallen turn without letting the rhythm slow-- a terrific little song, but one that might have you sneaking a peek at your watch every so often. And almost right on cue, in kicks ""No. 3"", a rocket-fueled Radio Birdman homage that makes you wish the record were twice as long.</p></div>"|15134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15134-mind-spiders/|7.5|Zach Kelly

""I really need to get away from me."" As David Bevan pointed out in his review, Dondero sounded like a man on his last professional leg, a cowboy staggering with a bullet wound. He'd been in the music business for nearly 20 years, playing in a variety of genres and bands before settling into a solo career playing dusty country folk. His warbly vocal style inspired Conor Oberst, and NPR's ""All Things Considered"" called him one of the best living songwriters, yet sales remained negligible over the years, even after he signed to his protégé's Team Love Records. It's understandable that any artist might be discouraged with such a lousy return on his creative investment, and at the risk of coming across as bitter or entitled, <i># Zero with a Bullet</i> exorcised that frustration even as it threatened to make failure the theme of this phase in Dondero's career.</p>
<p>His quick-on-the-heels follow-up, <i>A Pre-Existing Condition</i>, is the artist getting away from Team Love, from electric guitars, from himself. In addition to returning to Ghostmeat Records, which released Dondero's first two solo efforts in 1999 and 2000, he revisits an older sound and older songs: At distinct odds with <i># Zero</i>, <i>A Pre-Existing Condition</i> is an all-acoustic record, relying on guitars, upright bass, and harmonica as well as shakers, tambourine, and caxixi. It's a rough-and-tumble sound, no less sophisticated for sounding so spontaneous, especially when William Tonks' dobro illuminates the cover of Neil Young's ""Don't Cry No Tears"".</p>
<p>Of the baker's dozen tracks, only four are Dondero originals-- three if you believe ""Please Hand Me Over to the Undertaker"" is actually a decades-old gothic blues number (it sounds like one). The remaining nine tracks are covers ranging from Lowell George's trucker anthem ""Willin'"" to Elizabeth Cotten's ""Freight Train"" to ""Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'"", a massive hit for Charley Pride. Unshouldering the songwriting burden, Dondero sounds lighter and more engaged, his signature vocal style lending these songs a loose interpretive touch. He even has the temerity to adapt Jimmie Rodgers' ""T for Texas"" for a cheap shot at you-know-who: ""Gonna shoot that dirty hipster that stole my voice away."" The song, however, can't really support the sentiment, which sounds like a too-clever twist ending.</p>
<p>By design, <i>A Pre-Existing Condition</i> is a ramshackle affair-- not quite a covers album or a new direction. Instead, it's an album as therapy, Dondero's reminder to himself of why he got into this business and why he stays. For him, music is a way to make sense of the world, which is becoming increasingly nonsensical. Woody Guthrie's ""Pretty Boy Floyd"" sounds newly topical, a Great Depression anthem that resonates during the Great Recession, and he makes those final lines a very specific accusation: ""You will never see an outlaw drive a family from their home."" That's much more damning than the title track, a health care blues that rhymes ""social Darwinism"" with ""capitalism."" As a protest song, it overreaches, but maybe it's his way of stealing back from Oberst. <i>A Pre-Existing Condition</i> likely won't win Dondero any new fans or convince any holdouts, but that's not really the point. He's content simply to play for himself. The album may sound slight in 2011, but it has the potential to be pivotal if Dondero sounds rejuvenated on the follow-up.</p></div>"|15144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15144-a-pre-existing-condition/|6.0|Stephen M.

Both were innovators who existed at once inside and outside a pair of emerging genres (grime and dance-punk, respectively), and both focused so fully on their own tiny corners of existence that they made those experiences tangible to people who only had the slightest idea what they were talking about. Now, a decade later, both are preparing to say goodbye to their signature projects.</p>
<p>Skinner's landmark debut, <i>Original Pirate Material</i>, hit just months before LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"" single, but the follow-up, <i>A Grand Don't Come for Free</i>, arguably holds up better today. A staggering conceptual LP, the record was a grounded and powerful piece of linear storytelling that found Skinner in a more challenging and ambitious mode. But in that album's wake, Skinner adapated a much less relatable and charismatic persona, releasing a pair of disappointing LPs that squashed his accumulated goodwill. <i>The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living</i> was a near-fatal cocaine-and-tabloids tantrum, an attempt to shed light on celeb-culture shallowness that simply wound up indulging in it. And <i>Everything Is Borrowed</i> was even stranger, an amber-hued pastorale that made no sense at all. Now, convinced he's got nothing left to say, Skinner gives us <i>Computers and Blues</i>.</p>
<p>A collection of lesser beats and hooks that somewhat returns to <i>Original Pirate Material</i>'s sonics, <i>Computers and Blues</i> sadly trades that record's wonderful sense of place for a foggy vagueness that leaves Skinner's insights mostly impenetrable. And yet, after the last two albums, it feels something like a return to form, actually coming closer to the particular weird spark of Skinner's debut than anything he's released since. Even the image of the apartment building on the cover echoes the lonely tenement on his first album. And as a series of disconnected sketches with cheap bedroom beats, <i>Computers and Blues</i> is not without its charm.</p>
<p>But where <i>Original Pirate Material</i> empathetically chronicled the lives of its scabby potheads, <i>Computers and Blues</i> mostly concerns their weed-hazed days-- including, on ""Outside Inside"", the frustrating inability to get off the couch. Even as Skinner toys with some truly dumb lyrical conceits, it's a joy to hear him push language around: ""The fossiled remains of lots of ancient ways are buried or lost in every one of my mates' brains."" And there's also the genuinely moving ""A Blip on a Screen"", a vulnerable and wonderstruck song about seeing your kid on an ultrasound screen for the first time.</p>
<p>Musically, too, this is still recognizably the work of the kid who once mined rap and garage for everything he could use and threw the rest away. The beats are all endearingly awkward and homemade-- drums and horns and Bollywood samples tripping all over each other rather than combining into any sort of steamroller. A few tracks bring a nice garge-disco glide, an encouraging sign that Skinner could go on to be quite good at actual dance music. The hooks may be uniformly awful, but at least he's trying.</p>
<p>Still, nothing on <i>Computers and Blues</i> rivals even the weakest moments of Skinner's first two albums, and it comes out at the same time of something much more encouraging: a mixtape called <i>Cyberspace and Reds</i>, which Skinner claims is all music he's made since he finished this album. <i>Cyberspace and Reds</i> dips deeper into British rap than Skinner has ever allowed himself to go, with old grime comrades like Wiley and Kano and Jammer stopping by to talk shit. It's fun, for a change of pace, and it offers no indication that Skinner's trying to make an important piece of work. If he can lighten up enough to make something like that, there could be hope for him yet.</p></div>"|15099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15099-computers-and-blues/|5.3|Tom Breihan

He's also something of an enigma, aesthetically-speaking, and it's easy to get distracted by Smith's oddball presentation: There are costumes (besides the tree, he's wiggled into a nurse's uniform, heart-shaped blinders, and a sad, Willy Loman-esque Bible salesman suit), Christian ideology, plenty of high, unhinged bleating, and family-band mystique. His work has never been especially easy to categorize (""This man in a tree suit is making high-concept outsider art!"" vs. ""These are pretty great pop songs written by a dad from New Jersey!""), but genre is an especially fluid thing these days, and on <i>The Best of Gloucester County</i>, his eighth full-length, Smith successfully nods to a variety of influences-- from Daniel Johnston to Genesis-- while still retaining his particular singularity. Call it Daniel-Smith-rock.</p>
<p>2006's <i>Ships</i>, Smith's last release, saw him employing a vast cabal of artists, pals, and players, but the roster for <i>Gloucester County</i> is a lot leaner, and it feels like more of a solo record than nearly anything else Smith has done (Megan, Rachel, and Elin Smith contribute vocals, but otherwise no Famile members are expressly credited). It's not that he doesn't have help: An expert three-man horn section (Michael Cemprola, Jon Rees, and Paul Arbogast), a solid band (including Sufjan Stevens on banjo and vocals), and guest turns from Jens Lekman, Emil Nikolaisen of Serena-Maneesh, Chris Cohen of Cryptacize, and Mark Shippy of US Maple all bolster Smith's songs, adding a layer of muscle. But the band's ultimate function is to provide a taut and compelling counterpoint to Smith's pipes, which are as wild as ever: Here, the singing is the thing, and Smith's voice is stronger and more elastic than ever before. He's become a little less reliant on screeches and yelps, but his vocals are still riddled with idiosyncrasies, and the disparity between the singing and the instrumentation (which is tight and aggressive) keeps his songs consistently tense and interesting.</p>
<p>Some tracks belie a marked stylistic shift from alt-folk to full-on pysch-- like the spacey freakout ""Hovering Above That Hill"", which consists mostly of mesmeric guitar diddling, effects, and off-mic yelling. ""This Day Is a Loaf"" is more classic Danielson, a folksy, boisterous song about working (""Worry creeps in, like a thief from the nighttime,"" Smith sings, and artists everywhere commiserate). As wild as a Danielson record can get, his compositions are always meticulously recorded and arranged, and his work ethic is palpable on every track-- it's not that these songs feel over-labored, exactly (although they certainly don't seem spontaneous), it's that it's easy to hear all the ways in which Smith is consumed by his work.</p>
<p>But Danielson songs are still unabashedly joyful above all else-- Smith sniffed at irony before earnestness was cool again-- and that sense of deferential celebration is still what animates his work. ""Can we be friends? Can't we be friends?"" he implores (over bouncy-ball piano) on ""Lil Norge"", and resistance seems futile.</p></div>"|15135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15135-the-best-of-gloucester-county/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

Their biography is pretty complicated too. Disbanded in 1975, they reunited in the 1990s, only to split into two groups-- both called Faust-- a decade later. One, a rotating collective lead by founder Hans Joachim Irmler, released an album last year called <i>Faust Is Last </i>that was <a href=""http://freq.powweb.com/freq_wp/?p=736"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thought</a> to be a swan song but never officially confirmed as one. The other, centered on founders Jean Hervé Peron (bass) and Werner Diermaier (drums), has also shuffled members but since 2007 has been a quartet with guitarist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Johnston_(English_musician)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James Johnston</a> and singer/keyboardist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Swayne"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Geraldine Swayne</a>.</p>
<p>Given that confusing history, the most surprising thing about <i>Something Dirty</i>, this lineup's first <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZnxU58d99E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">studio album</a>, is how solid it is. Not to say it's predictable-- looping jams shift into subdued mediations, thick noises fall to near-silence, and loose sprawl morphs into accessible tunes. But there's a distinct cohesion to these songs and the way they move together. Nothing feels wilfully obscure or defiantly abrupt; each pause or shift in momentum serves a purpose. <i>Something Dirty </i>plays like a well-paced movie, with tonal arcs that dissolve into each other, cut back and forth, and build repetition into crescendo. It's often the kind of abstract mood-soundtrack that comrades <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh_(German_band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Popol Vuh</a> once mastered for the <a href=""http://alteredzones.com/posts/706/box-set-werner-herzog-soundtracks-popol-vuh/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">films</a> of Werner Herzog-- but with Faust's sound-stories, pictures aren't really necessary.</p>
<p>If <i>Something Dirty </i>has a weakness, it's that Faust set their own bar too high. The first three tracks-- a grimy rocker, a Pink Floyd-ish psych-out, and a soaring symphonic jam--<i> </i>are so well-crafted and timed, it's hard to imagine the band holding to that standard for another 30 minutes. But it's fascinating to watch them try. They revisit peaks more than a few times, winding through Swayne-led torch songs, ambient noise-scapes, and a pair of stunning guitar destructions called ""Dampfauslass 1"" and ""Dampfauslass 2"". All those moves show up in closer ""La Sole Dorée"", which melts Swayne's echoes into crunchy feedback, ending with a hard-cut to silence. That sudden stop is the only moment on <i>Something Dirty </i>that could be called a gimmick, but it feels oddly right. A fade-out would be too easy-- better to bluntly suggest that there's more music beyond that final frame, and encourage the rumor that this version of Faust is far from finished.</p></div>"|15150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15150-something-dirty/|7.5|Marc Masters

So, for those easily distracted by dreams of that group's reemergence, let's get this out of the way-- <i>Peer Amid </i>doesn't sound a whole lot like Lungfish. But it does sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27751-the-skull-defekts/"">Skull Defekts</a>. The Swedish group has quietly hammered out noisy rock and sharp post-punk since 2005. Playing for the first time with Higgs-- who's spent the last seven years on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14256-say-god/"">spoken word</a>, <a href=""http://www.dischord.com/release/nolib2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jew's harp improvisations</a>, and other <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10442-atomic-yggdrasil-tarot/"">unclassifiables</a>-- they've delivered their strongest work so far. Which means that the best answer to any question about <i>Peer Amid </i>is that it sounds great.</p>
<p>In fact, it probably would've sounded great whether or not Higgs was involved. Even the most wandering and noisy songs crackle with taut energy and hypnotic repetition. But they all rise higher because of the way Higgs sprays his voice around. He's rarely willing to simply settle into the Skull Defekts' impressive grooves. Take ""Fragrant Nimbus"": Atop a wiry one-chord jam, Higgs flips styles like a character actor, doling out single-word warbles, illegible moans, and blunt directions like a megaphone-toting rally-leader. Higgs can narrow himself just as powerfully-- on closer ""Join the True"", he flatly intones a simple mantra, playing the calm in the middle of the Skull Defekts' gathering storm.</p>
<p>That storm evokes some powerful post-punk forefathers-- for starters, think of the rhythmic interplay of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1378-the-ex/"">the Ex</a> and magnetic singer G.W. Sok, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall's</a> tight repetitions in support of Mark E. Smith's rambling. Lofty company, but Skull Defekts have earned it. Perhaps, given that this is such hard-edged music, some tracks may seem over-indulgent. The most abstract piece, a trebly soundscape called ""What Knives, What Birds"", lasts well beyond six minutes, and the drum séance ""In Majestic Drag"" goes over eight. But if you're at all inclined toward the Defekts' brand of hypnosis, you might find yourself wishing every song would go on longer. Save your energy for the hope that this perfectly matched collaboration is what ends up lasting.</p></div>"|15139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15139-peer-amid/|7.6|Marc Masters

For better or worse, this pairing of veteran French dance producers Pilooski and Pentile sticks exclusively to the disco side of the divide, crafting multilayered, largely instrumental glitterball workouts. Honestly though, a few swigs of purple drank wouldn't have been the worst thing in the world for the duo's eponymous debut album, if only because it would've at least ensured some kind of switch-up in tone and pace. Instead, <i>Discodeine</i> settles too comfortably into a consistent four-on-the-floor groove that ends up sounding an awful lot like a rut.</p>
<p>Pilooski and Pentile's project first came to prominence last year with the terrific disco-pop single, ""Synchronize"", featuring Jarvis Cocker. It's included on this album and still sounds great-- too great, because pretty much everything else on the record pales in comparison. Discodeine don't otherwise seem too interested here in sculpting pop songs, as only two other cuts utilize vocals more substantial than stray wordless coos (Matias Aguayo's caddish whispers on the opening ""Singular"" and Baxter Dury's limp Air impression on ""D-A""). That'd be fine, except many of the duo's strictly instrumental tracks are so static that it feels like they ought to be hosting vocal melodies and refrains just to sound whole. Instead of compositions that evolve in emotionally or thematically interesting ways, Discodeine generally prefer to just lock into a tempo and then pile melodic and rhythmic bits atop it.</p>
<p>Some of these elements are admittedly quite nifty, particularly the bashing percussion that peppers ""Falkenberg"" and ""Grace"" or the insistent little synth tones driving ""Ring Mutilation"". Still, dance music of the sort Discodeine seem intent on making demands ebb and flow, a push and pull that takes the listener places and wrings emotion from its tension. Yet only occasionally does it feel like there's any real logical progression taking place here (for instance, there's certainly a journey undertaken on the proggy closer ""Figures in a Soundscape"", but the movement feels arbitrary and aimless rather than purposeful). ""Antiphonie"" manages the trick pretty masterfully, with its busy acoustic guitars and foreboding piano chords giving way to pure disco thump, but unfortunately it's the exception rather than the rule. As for much of the rest of <i>Discodeine</i>, well, five to nine minutes of even the most artfully layered wheel-spinning is still wheel-spinning.</p></div>"|15148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15148-discodeine/|5.3|Joshua Love

Not only can all of us relate to that sentiment at some point in our lives, but it also drew a direct line between the escapism of home-made electro-pop and the lives of most of the people creating it.

Just over a year later, he's already the first of the A-listers from this scene to release a follow-up. But if he was feeling any pressure to validate himself and his peers, <i>Underneath the Pine</i> doesn't show it. The album may be too lyrically opaque to have a line as bloggable as ""Blessa""'s, but it's a far richer and more accomplished whole, and it makes a strong case for Bundick as an artist with scope, ambition, and a firm grasp of how to balance the two.</p>
<p><i>Underneath the Pine</i> begins a little like the last album, with a wobbly, splayed-out chord backing Bundick's cooed vocal salutation. But where ""Blessa""'s murky, aquamarine production set the tone for most of <i>Causers</i>, this album's ""Intro/Chi Chi"" is a textured instrumental that trigger memories of Air's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NINOxRxze9k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""La Femme D'Argent""</a> and underscores one of Bundick's most overlooked assets: his ability to create an appealingly lush ambiance. That mood plays a central role in <i>Underneath the Pine</i>, as much of the album sheds Bunwick's synth-pop roots in favor of a vastly expanded instrumental palette that includes organ, pianos, chimes, and plenty of live drumming. Bundick's skill as an arranger is especially evident in <i>Pine</i>'s midsection: though casually paced and humid as his native South Carolina, it pulls from the French pop and krautrock obsessions of Broadcast and Stereolab, imbuing pastoral, acoustic plucks and synth drones with rhythmic purpose, and making retro chic somehow still sound futuristic.</p>
<p>All of this sonic exploration is in service to Bundick's growth as a songwriter. Big choruses like the one on ""How I Know"" come unexpectedly during what at first appear to be endless motorik grooves, as plainspoken vocal melodies give way to double-helix harmonies. Even the tracks that keep a lower profile maintain enough ballast to prevent the zone-outs that pockmarked <i>Causers</i>. They also serve to set off the big singles, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12098-new-beat/"" target=""_blank"">""New Beat""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12066-still-sound/"" target=""_blank"">""Still Sound""</a>. Heard individually, those songs' straight-up funk delivery mostly sounded like twists on a successful formula, but in context on <i>Underneath the Pine</i>, they underscore how Bundick's knack for analog warmth always comes in the name of physicality and groove. You may want to try and peg where the drum sounds come from-- maybe <i>Innervisions</i>, maybe even <i>Midnite Vultures</i>-- but rhythmic interplay this addictive has to be felt, not simply conjured from memory.</p>
<p>Because Toro Y Moi is so closely linked with the likes of Neon Indian, Washed Out, and Memory Tapes, it's tempting to read into the success of <i>Underneath the Pine</i> as some predictor of those bands' collective staying power, or a direction others might take. But Bundick seems to be following nothing but his own internal compass. Late in the album, ""Good Hold"" comes off like an Eno tribute of detuned piano dissonance, and then morphs into the blissful glide of album closer, ""Elise"". It's a fitting send-off to <i>Underneath the Pine</i>, suggesting that Toro Y Moi's first great album probably won't be his last, or his best.</p></div>"|15129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15129-underneath-the-pine/|8.3|Ian Cohen

They are a band whose big moment has always seemed just out of reach, something compounded by the fact that they went album-less for four years, finally ending the dry spell with last year's fine <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14146-clinging-to-a-scheme/"" target=""_blank"">Clinging to a Scheme</a></i>. That record's success brought with it a swell of momentum-- two singles, an EP, and even a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14839-the-new-improved-hypocrisy/"" target=""_blank"">free Internet single</a> to coincide with the Swedish elections. It was a period of activity that won them a whole new set of listeners, and the decision to reconcile their scattered career into an accessible singles collection seems to be a wise move.</p>
<p>The first disc of <i>Passive Aggressive</i> aims to be just that-- a collection of chronologically ordered singles and album material that shows how much ground the Radio Dept. have covered in eight years. ""Why Won't You Talk About It?"" opens the set with in-the-red guitars and a drumbeat that seems to be endlessly on the verge of kicking in. Johan Duncanson's barely there vocals have a similar lackadaisical quality and effortless cool to Julian Casablancas of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7537-is-this-it/"" target=""_blank""><i>Is This It</i></a>-era Strokes. It has a magnetic breeziness about it, and for all of the early-2000s signifiers and the blown-out lo-fi production, it actually sounds five years ahead of its time.</p>
<p>After the debut album, <i>Lesser Matters</i>, the band took on a more electronic bent, showcased here by ""The Worst Taste in Music"", a well-executed piece of synth-pop reminiscent of the Pet Shop Boys and a stand-out moment on the collection. It's a shame that it is the sole representative from 2006's underrated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9003-pet-grief/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pet Grief</i></a>. Much of that excellent record pre-dates many of the recent Balearic-leaning groups such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28054-korallreven/"" target=""_blank"">Korallreven</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27763-jj/"" target=""_blank"">jj</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28811-ceo/"" target=""_blank"">ceo</a>, and this would have been an excellent opportunity to recast their significance as progenitors of that scene.</p>
<p>At their best, as on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11812-heavens-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven's on Fire""</a>, the  Radio Dept. internalize their varied influences-- dub, sample culture, synth pop-- and refocus them into a something that is unmistakably their own. Their identity is so hard-wired into the core of the sound that it means they can nod to slightly alien textures such as the offbeat keys and dub leanings of ""Never Follow Suit"" without it sounding contrived.</p>
<p>The B-sides disc is less strong, and there are some odd choices-- the inclusion of throwaway instrumental ""Tåget"" over the excellent Cure-tinged cut ""Deliverance"" from the <i>This Past Week</i> EP is disappointing. There are a few highlights to be found, but even those, such as buzzy instrumental ""Mad About the Boy"", sound like sketches. At best, some of these songs show promise, at worst, the mostly minor-key explorations come across as labored and even overwrought in the case of ""You and Me Then?"". While it's interesting to hear the band experiment and stretch its legs, these tracks mark a lot of the disc out as fan-only material.</p>
<p>The weakness of the second disc makes for a slightly awkward contrast as the collection straddles an uncomfortable middle ground between appeasing long-time fans with rarities and acting as a primer to the band's sadly underrated previous material. But while there are a few selection missteps overall, the first disc in particular makes for a great initiation to the Radio Dept.'s previous work. And that there is the opportunity to re-introduce this long undervalued band is something to cheer in itself.</p></div>"|15035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15035-passive-aggressive-singles-2002-2010/|8.2|Hari Ashurst

The vast <i>Special Herbs</i> project, an all-instrumental series of discs put out under his Metal Fingers moniker, would seem to form the center of Doom's ample discography, at least in terms of quantity. But despite the sheer amount of music collected under the <i>Herbs</i> banner-- 10 volumes released in a variety of formats between 2001 and 2005, enough to rival another artist's career output-- the series is often discussed as if it were a sketchbook of Doom's production ideas that is less essential than official ""finished"" albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41264-mf-dooms-ioperation-doomsdayi-reissued/"" target=""_blank""><i>Operation: Doomsday</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Madvilliany</i></a>.</p>
<p>That's not particularly surprising, but it is a little unfair. On the one hand, the <i>Herbs</i> line mostly act as a compendium of instrumentals Doom produced for both himself and other rappers over the course of his career, from his early 1990s days with Native Tongues satellites <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4571-the-best-of-kmd/"" target=""_blank"">KMD</a> to his 21st-century rebirth as monster-loving underground polymath. Casual fans might wonder why, especially if they own the original rap albums these tracks spring from, they need to grapple with this much previously released material in instrumental form. But these releases are far from just being DJ tools or freestyle fodder for amateur MCs. They offer a chance for anyone to revel in Doom's breadth and inventiveness, to appreciate his head-spinning stylistic shifts as a producer by bringing the beats to the foreground. Make no mistake-- most of these tracks sound plenty ""finished"" even in rhyme-less form. And as a document of an underground producer's life's work (so far), the <i>Herbs</i> series is rivaled only Doom's friend and fellow manic archivist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a> in both scope and completeness.</p>
<p>The box slaps all previous <i>Herbs</i> installments onto 10 slabs of  DJ-friendly vinyl, while also offering a digital download of the full  series and bonus material for those rabid Doom-heads who apparently  didn't get enough with their first 10 doses (for this review, I listened  to digital files). The bonus cuts include a 7"" with two slices  of lo-fi R&amp;B nostalgia, the tense trunk-rattler ""Constipated Monkey""  and the richer brass-and-organ 60s fantasia ""Project Jazz"", their ""lost jukebox 45"" quality fitting the old-school vinyl single format  perfectly. There's also a whole disc of unreleased material that ranges  from the whimsical, Muppet-sampling ""Humrush"" to the standup bass  showcase ""It Sounded like a Roc!"", though most of the never-before-heard  tracks stick to the warm, friendly, jazz-tinged sound of the 90s  underground, rather than Doom's harsher psychedelic/futuristic outings.<br><br> Naturally, 12 new tracks on top of 71 previously released cuts will only  be an enticement to mega-fans who decided to preorder this set the day  it was announced. But whatever the package, whether this lavish vinyl  collection or the multi-disc mixed CD compilation Nature Sounds released  a few years back, the <i>Herbs</i> are an essential buy for 21st-century beat  freaks. Doom covers so much ground that it might be a little surprising  for those who haven't been following his career for the last two  decades, with something to please both hip-hop classicists and  experimental-leaning b-boys on every disc. Do you miss the strutting  Meters-derived funk of 90s hip-hop? Find plenty of it here. Or the way  producers once shamelessly flipped classic rock/R&amp;B chestnuts,  letting you revel in the original hook with the bonus of a punchy rap  beat? Well, Doom does his own brand of disco editing on the Doobie  Brothers' ""What A Fool Believes"" on ""Mandrake"". Are you a new-school fan of the tweaked psychedelic beatscapes of the <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> crew? Doom seems anticipate those as well, making the decade-old Herbs  feel more up-to-date than you might expect.<br><br> Sure, he's got his signature tricks, and yes some of these tracks will  always feel like backing tracks in search of a rapper. But much of  Doom's instrumental output is varied and listenable enough all on its  own, full of gorgeous (the weeping violin on ""Syrax Gum,"" the fluttering  Spanish-tinged funk guitars of ""Chrysanthemum Flowers"") and often  untrammeled melodies courtesy of his original sample sources. He's  equally at home with lusher-than-lush symphonic soul homage and  disorienting krautrock-esque noise refashioned into neck-snapping NYC  minimalism, a breadth which justifies the Herbs' status as stand-alone  product. Some tracks offer the kind of antic and hook-heavy funk-collage  that once made ""DJ records,"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11524-what-does-it-all-mean-1983-2006-retrospective/"" target=""_blank"">Steinski</a> to the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/invisiblskratchpiklz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Invisibl Skratch Piklz</a>, plenty of fun without a rapper in sight. And even the more static  and laid-back cuts make for excellent, immersive background music. The  luscious detailing and wild sonic change-ups of the Herbs recall a time when people didn't necessarily need an MC to  appreciate the intricacies of a killer cut-and-paste job, when many were  happy to lose themselves in the head-nodding repetition of a densely  layered loop.</br></br></br></br></p></div>"|15114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15114-special-herbs-the-box-set-vol-0-9/|7.0|Jess Harvell

At the very least, that's an average of just under three per year, a number that, if other solo recording maniacs (Bob Pollard being a good example) are to serve as helpful guideposts, might lead one to assume that Anderson isn't much for self-editing. But having helped co-release a small handful of Anderson's records over the past eight years, Domino has volunteered to cull the Fife-native's catalogue for <i>Thrawn</i>, a collection of King Creosote favorites that also serves as a compelling introduction for American listeners.</p>
<p>Anderson's baffling work rate seems to have adorned his songs with a wide variety of skins. From a curatorial standpoint, what's been arranged and sequenced here goes deep in the name of diversity. The screwball pop flourishes that propel opener ""Bootprints"" and the lovely ""Homeboy"" bleed fluidly into Anglo-folk forays like those to be enjoyed in ""My Favourite Girl"" or the zoot-suit referencing ""King Bubbles in Sand"". It's a blend heard most prominently in the work of Badly Drawn Boy's Damon Gough or Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys, both of whom also do a wonderful job of impressing their own unique, regional sense of humor and sensibility upon their work. Just as gifted, Anderson is of a similar stripe. On the aforementioned opener, he rhymes, ""we rest, we jest, we love ourselves to death but we reek of garlic breath,"" just before the electro-pop of ""You've No Clue Do You"" uses Clue the board game as a relationship allegory that makes sure to include lyrical appearances by Mrs. Peacock, Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum, and the rest.</p>
<p>At the same time, a few songs here are crowded with color and verbiage at the expense of focus, and much to their disadvantage. Because when Anderson zones in, the result is magnetic. ""The Vice-Like Gist of It"" is a quiet, churchly drone that Anderson, also the owner of a fine voice, carves up and through to knee-buckling, crystalline effect. The way he delivers the late line, ""It's not that I don't care for you, it's just that I'm unkind,"" is one steamroller to be found here that contrasts really nicely against the zanier fare that comprises much of the record's first half. In fact, that song in particular is a really useful halfway-mark, as much of <i>Thrawn</i>'s more outwardly melodic and ambient moments (""And the Racket They Made"" is deadly beautiful) sprawl out over the course of the disc's second half. Closer ""No One Had It Better"" typifies the experience best in a single dose, though: Over the span of seven very quick minutes, Anderson abandons an early scramble of wonky, often spectral vocal manipulations and synths for a simple guitar-and-tom groove that locks in and takes off. You can hear his voice loud and clear.</p></div>"|15146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15146-thrawn/|6.9|David Bevan

It's a short, slight LP, with slack ambition and a slightly crunchy indie rock feel that sounds situated in the early 2000s. For the Luyas' second LP and <a href=""http://www.deadoceans.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dead Oceans</a> debut, <i>Too Beautiful to Work</i>, the band-- which carries distinct Northern cache thanks to the involvement of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/610-bell-orchestre/"" target=""_blank"">Bell Orchestre</a> members Pietro Amato and Stefan Schneider-- enlisted a few notable names in the process: specifically, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"" target=""_blank"">Owen Pallett</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a>'s Sarah Neufeld, and sound-mangling saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"" target=""_blank"">Colin Stetson</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you omit those artists' contributions, <i>Too Beautiful to Work</i> is strikingly different from and more self-assured than its predecessor. That ""Montreal sound"" does rear its head at certain points-- if singer/guitarist Jessie Stein were relieved from her vocal duties, the lightly soaring anthemics of ""Cold Canada"" and ""What Mercy Is"" could easily be slotted in on a Bell Orchestre record (and the former carries a distant relation to the build of Pallett's own ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8PZ8-cpWc4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Is the Dream of Win and Regine</a>""). Mostly, though, <i>Too Beautiful to Work</i> sounds taut yet spacey, as metronomic rhythms butt heads with floating melodies and atmospherics. At times, it comes across as a cleaner version of the jarring pop dissonance that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a> explored in their last few albums-- a comparison that's lent sad, heavy weight due to Stein's close vocal resemblance to late Broadcast singer Trish Keenan. When ""Tiny Head"" made the blog rounds last spring, the comparison made one long for new material from the UK act, at the very least; following Keenan's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41200-rip-broadcasts-trish-keenan/"" target=""_blank"">abrupt passing</a> last month, the resemblance is now somewhat haunting, making the already self-contained <i>Too Beautiful to Work</i> sound absolutely claustrophobic.</p>
<p>Maybe too claustrophobic, as a matter of fact: Parsing Stein's lyrics suggests that there are raw nerves lurking behind the tightened face of <i>Too Beautiful to Work</i>. ""I don't want to be a little girl,"" she sings on ""I Need Mirrors"", but elsewhere she speaks vaguely of self-sacrifice with little reward. Over the sparse, uneasy strings of ""Canary"", she depicts fantastical self-mutilation for the purpose of giving someone else a voice, later conceding that ""anyone can talk"" and issuing a haunting statement before the entrance of a creaky, moonlit horn: ""I dream of drowning."" On ""Tiny Head"", she wispily coos, ""It's no use/ I'm confused,"" before clattering percussion crashes through. There's tension, but the album's relative neatness prevents that ominous feeling from developing into high-stakes drama. The record, then, turns out to be a fairly bloodless experience, a trait that suggests the Luyas should take heed of otherwise dangerous advice: A little violence never hurt anybody.</p></div>"|15154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15154-too-beautiful-to-work/|6.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

The pay-what you-think-is-fair system wasn't just  Radiohead being magnanimous, it was using their popularity and  their newly won independence to ask what might have been the single most  important question facing a shaken music industry: What is an  album in the download era actually worth to fans?</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41561-radiohead-to-release-new-album-this-saturday/"" target=""_blank"">Announced</a> on Monday of last week and then chucked out to rabid fans like flank steak <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41623-radiohead-album-available-now/"" target=""_blank"">a day ahead of schedule</a>, the band's eighth album dispenses with the honesty-box pricing model but still finds them using their influence to  interrogate the terms around how we consume and relate to music.  Containing a slight eight tracks across 37 minutes, <i>The King of Limbs</i> is Radiohead's first album to clock in under the 40-minute mark, falling into that limbo between a modern full-length and an EP. What's more, it feels like it stops short  intentionally, almost confrontationally, as if Radiohead are trying to  ask a new kind of question about their music.</p>
<p>""None of us want to get into that creative hoo-ha of a long-play record again,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/36154-thom-yorke-radiohead-not-planning-to-release-any-albums-for-awhile/"" target=""_blank"">Thom Yorke told <i>The Believer</i> </a>in August 2009. ""It's just become a real drag. It worked with <i>In Rainbows</i> because  we had a real fixed idea about where we were going. But we've all said  that we can't possibly dive into that again. It'll kill us."" This  wouldn't be the first time that a member of Radiohead publicly  fantasized about disowning the album format, but it might have been the  most convincing. How better to unburden themselves of the stress of  making more records in the mold of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Bends</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>OK Computer</i></a>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6656-kid-a/"" target=""_blank"">Kid A</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6659-amnesiac/"" target=""_blank"">Amnesiac</a>,</i> and <i>In Rainbows</i> than by simply changing the terms of their engagement?</p>
<p>Radiohead's eighth record, <a href=""http://www.thekingoflimbs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The King of Limbs</i></a>, represents  a marked attempt to create a considered and cohesive unit of music that  nonetheless sits somewhere outside of the spectrum of their previous  full-length discography. And that's not to say that it doesn't ripple  with the dazzling sonics or scenery that have become the band's stock in trade, but just that,  unlike so many of their milestones, there's no abiding sense of a band defying all expectations in order to establish new precedents.</p>
<p>Instead,  we get eight songs that feel mostly like small but natural evolutions  of previously explored directions. Opener ""Bloom"" announces Radiohead's  return with a scattershot sequence of chewed-up drum loops and peeling  horns that dissolve into a rhythmic tangle. ""Morning Mr. Magpie""  re-casts an old live acoustic ballad in a more anxious light, its  once-sunny disposition frozen into an icy glare. With its crumbling  guitar shapes and clattering, fizzing percussion work, ""Little By  Little"" sounds dilapidated and rundown. Meanwhile, ""Feral"" contorts Yorke's voice into a reverb-infused, James Blake-like wriggle that pings around the stereo  channel against a mulched up drum pattern that sounds  sharper than glass.</p>
<p>In this more rhythmic first half of the album, electronic percussion figures in heavily as usual, but also with heightened emphasis on drummer Phil Selway's uneven time signatures. The previously well-rounded band dynamic, meanwhile, feels like it's been reduced to a  miniaturized version of itself. This isn't the band that ripped  through ""Bodysnatchers""; these guys play with a precise, almost  scientific restraint that suits the twitchy anxiety of these  songs well.</p>
<p>Things  open up on the softer, dreamier second side, as rhythms recede and more traditional song  structures take over. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15437-lotus-flower/"" target=""_blank"">""Lotus Flower""</a>, the lead single presumably for having a  chorus and not being a ballad, finds Yorke delivering a  series of slippery hooks in slinky falsetto mode. Album highlights  ""Codex"" and ""Give Up the Ghost"" follow, the former a narcotized cousin  to ""Pyramid Song"" that features woozily flanged piano chords, long,  plaintive horn trills, and Yorke at his most evocative; the latter an  acoustic, guitar-led call-and-response that finds him piling falsettos  into a gorgeously ramshackle wall of harmony. Last is ""Separator"", a  clear-eyed, mid-tempo closer that mixes 1990s–era Radiohead with a touch  of Neil Young-inspired guitar work and ends on a sweet and easy note that's miles away from the complicated clatter it began with.  Compared to such a dense first half, there's something satisfying about all the open space in the album's final  stretch; before you know it, the record's breezed by. It's a nice packing trick, one that makes the album feel even lighter than its 37 minutes.</p>
<p>So:  eight tracks, each of them worth your time, and yet <i>The King of Limbs</i> is still likely to go down as Radiohead's most divisive record. A trawl through message boards and social networks leaves the impression that many  disappointed fans are still struggling to make sense of the gap between  the greatness of the thing they got and the genius of the thing they  thought they might get. It's in that gap, when assessing the album overall, that it's easy to get tangled up. This is well-worn terrain for Radiohead, and while it continues to yield rewarding results, the band's signature game-changing ambition is missed.</p></div>"|15149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15149-the-king-of-limbs/|7.9|Mark Pytlik

But after loading up that debut with nudge-wink samples of everything from 1979 cult classic <i>The Warriors</i> to the freakin' Guess Who, the only joke here is that, titular similarities aside, the two albums could not be more different in approach. But then <i>Return to the Ugly Side</i> is all you could hope for from a fledgling act following up a promising debut--  a sophomore effort that sees the duo of Gary Ealey and Scott Hendy transcending their more obvious influences and unifying their scatterbrained aesthetic into a more singular sound, one that presents all sorts of new possibilities.</p>
<p>In contrast to<i> Ugly Side of Love</i>'s serrated, patchwork quality, <i>Return to the Ugly Side</i> is clearly designed to be experienced as a single piece, complete with an opening instrumental overture that recurs later in the album, and seamless flows in and out of tracks. And where<i> Ugly Side of Love</i> boasted a hermetic, homemade feel, <i>Return to the Ugly Side</i> has a wide-screen scope, with ominous orchestral swells (courtesy of noted BBC composer Ben Salisbury) and thundering drum breaks that give Malachai a heretofore unheard force and sinister majesty. Not coincidentally, the band has taken to posting <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/malachaiuk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a series of mixtapes on their Soundcloud page</a>, manically ping-ponging between 1960s psychedelic pop, dubby 80s post-punk, and bonged-out 90s hip-hop. Beyond showing off their excellent record collection, the mixes serve to illuminate the raw materials that have been reshaped and refined on <i>Return to the Ugly Side</i>.</p>
<p>In effect, Malachai's transformation is not unlike that experienced by their chief mentor, Geoff Barrow of Portishead, as they've subverted their more accessible retro-cool reference points for more jarring, disorienting sonic collisions. As on the mixtapes, Ealey isn't shy about evincing his Beatles love, but that kaleidoscope-eyed melodic sensibility is forced to do combat with percussive onslaughts (""(My) Ambulance"", ""The Don't Just"") or, on ""Monster"", pulverizing industrialized shocks that would sound right at home on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00PdHIPjaWQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Portishead's <i>Third</i></a>.</p>
<p>Even the quietest moments carry a sense of unease, like a gorgeous, ghostly duet with Katy Wainright on ""Rainbows"" that's unnerving in its disaffected calmness, or the smoky jazz-bar haze of ""How You Write"". But after impressively raising the stakes for the album's first three quarters, <i>Return to the Ugly Side</i> unfortunately sputters out in the home stretch, forgoing the climactic finale suggested by its cinematic framework in favor of an egregiously punned slackadasical serenade (""No More Rain, No Maureen"") and a ponderous dub-folk exercise (""HyberNation"") that brings this brief 35-minute album to an unsatisfying conclusion. This would indicate Malachai still have some work to do in separating the inspired from the indulgent. But if they keep at the evolutionary pace set by <i>Return to the Ugly Side</i>, they'll soon be blowing many more minds <a href=""http://i1.soundcloud.com/artworks-000004771640-t2vx89-crop.jpg?c1f0ed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">than their own</a>.</p></div>"|15141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15141-return-to-the-ugly-side/|7.6|Stuart Berman

The 37-year old London-via-Italy transplant previously did time in the little-known indie pop outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9287-sunny-day-sets-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Sunny Day Sets Fire</a>, so he knows his way around a recording studio-- experience that, ironically, makes the tape-hissed tack more desirable for him. In his previous career in a full-band setting, he outlined: ""I started to make demos to show them, but then I suddenly realized that I liked the demos more than the final recordings... I like the idea of a work in progress.""</p>
<p>The songs of Porcelain Raft sound far from incomplete, though; instead, on the project's proper debut EP, <i>Gone Blind</i>, they sound full-bodied and substantial. Composed of mastered material from Porcelain Raft's well of self-released 2010 EPs, this four-track (six on the digital version) record in advance of Remiddi's forthcoming full-length is a brief glimpse of his distanced compositional talents and stylistic breadth. Last year's gorgeously dew-dropped single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12019-tip-of-your-tongue/"" target=""_blank"">Tip of Your Tongue</a>"" owed debts to Swedish indie pop, strengthened here by the buzzing, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4760-the-radio-dept/"" target=""_blank"">Radio Dept.</a>-reminiscent ""I Found a Way"". Mostly, though, <i>Gone Blind</i> elaborates on Remiddi's surprisingly close vocal resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"" target=""_blank"">John Lennon</a>; at times, the similarity in his inflection on certain syllables and held notes is uncanny. The comparison holds melodic water as well; you can hear remnants of <i>Plastic Ono Band</i>'s ramble-rock moments in the haunted, bent-string jangle of the title track, while a peer within the beatific light of Remiddi's best song to date, ""Dragonfly"", reveals a positively gooey melody that works in the vein of Lennon's more sentimental, heart-tugging moments. The latter benefits most from the otherwise hard-to-notice remastering job that was done on these tracks, as Remiddi gently delivers a farewell kiss-off while surrounded by miles-wide guitar and shook percussion: ""Whatever you were looking for/ It's not here anymore.""</p>
<p><i>Gone Blind</i>'s closing track, ""Talk to Me"", is another beast entirely, as broken beats and clattering drone-noise shatter around Remiddi's snapped whispers of the titular phrase. It's a dark departure from the other songs' comparatively optimistic glow, and it's tempting to read the track's placement as indicative of what the future holds for Porcelain Raft. Unfortunately, there's no such future context to be found considering <i>Gone Blind</i> doesn't serve much purpose for folks who have spent the past year with these songs. For newcomers, though, it serves as a good starting point to Remiddi's growing catalog; the rest of us, it seems, will have to wait for his next move. Lucky for us, this stuff has staying power.</p></div>"|15145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15145-gone-blind-ep/|7.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

When BPitch Control launched around the turn of the millennium, it had one primary thing going for it-- a rock-solid identity. That this identity was owed almost entirely to the white-hot streak label founder Ellen Allien was riding didn't matter. BPitch was a totem for Berlin and for the pop-influenced wing of the microhouse sound. In the intervening years BPitch has forfeited its hyper-focused creative identity in favor of a friends-and-family approach. This has allowed Allien freedom to cultivate her own personal techno sphere incorporating a wide range of artists and styles-- the Boogybytes mix series has been successful, for the most part-- but it has also hinted at the type of slow decay that this approach can foster. In the last few years especially it has seemed that Allien and BPitch have done everything just a little bit wrong, and so it goes with <i>Werkschau</i>, the label's latest compilation, a label-spanning collection of unreleased material.</p>
<p><i>Werkschau</i> (translation: showcase) isn't a terrible idea, just an odd one: The label is not marking any significant anniversary or milestone. Seventeen tracks is hardly a vault cleansing, but it's also quite a bit of music, and no one really thought that BPitch was sitting on techno's <i>The Basement Tapes</i> in the first place. <i>Werkschau</i> will not stoke the flames under upcoming BPitch releases. But, importantly, <i>Werkschau</i> is fun to listen to, and not because it offers a lot of nostalgic kicks. It is a ragtag collection of light, effervescent techno, one that features deft pop flourishes, if few surprises.</p>
<p>The selections on <i>Werkschau </i>clock in almost uncannily between four and five minutes, suggesting that BPitch had some plan here: to showcase the best album tracks (as opposed to 12"" dance singles) left in its coffers. Allien is still the bellwether; slotted second, ""The Kiss"" is one of her most house-indebted moments (no micro-), and much of what  follows leans on that genre's warm electric pianos and familiar bass kicks. Simple genre placeholders like Zander VT's ""Gotta Look Up to Get Down"" and Kiki &amp; Lenz's ""Morning Maniacs"" offer a camp around which the rest of <i>Werkschau</i> can settle. There are some surprises: Jahcoozi show up with an especially R&amp;B-indebted take on trip-hop; Paul Kalkbrenner's ""Plätscher"" is dewy, blended <i>kosmische</i>. The now-defunct Telefon Tel Aviv collaborate with Robin Guthrie for gorgeous, strobing techno-rock. I prefer the slight, vocal-oriented tracks (Timtim's ""How We Moove"" is reminiscent of the Notwist; Dillon &amp; Coma's ""Aiming for Destruction"" is mildly sassy) because, to be quite honest, BPitch has rarely had the type of athletic, focused producers necessary for longform dance, Sascha Funke excepted.</p>
<p>As a collection, <i>Werkschau</i> features no internal narrative and offers no grand perspective on BPitch. (If you were to write a one-sentence bio based solely on <i>Werkschau</i> it might read, ""BPitch was a house-y label with some good producers and some anonymous ones,"" and that would only be about half right.) It's only minorly indicative of ""the BPitch sound,"" certainly less so than the <i>Camping</i> series, which began in 2005 (by which point Mark Pytlik had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2086-camping/"">already noted a dissolution in the label's identity</a>). The title implies something utilitarian and under construction-- fine. It's hard not to want more: a truer retrospective, or some sense that BPitch is doing more than treading water between Allien releases (an album comprised of remixes of her last album, <i>Dust</i>, drops in March, natch). BPitch is doing more, of course, but <i>Werkschau</i> doesn't do much to highlight it. It's the rare album that is as impossible to recommend as it is easy to enjoy.</p></div>"|15131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15131-werkschau/|6.0|Andrew Gaerig

I know Mexican Summer does. In 2010, the label put out two records from incredibly similar bands who fitting within that narrow description-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14586-the-waves/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Waves</i></a> was a stirring introduction to the transplanted San Franciscans in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28370-tamaryn/"" target=""_blank"">Tamaryn</a>, and next came the domestic rerelease of Black Ryder's <i>Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride</i>, available in their native Australia since late 2009. If you need an easy way to tell them apart, remember that Tamaryn is the one actually from New Zealand.</p>
<p>But while <i>The Waves</i> is tough for any record in its realm to compete with, it's likely that even without the comparison those versed in psych-rock in its woozier and swooning modes would recognize <i>Buy the Ticket</i> as a facile but unremarkable addition to the fold. Comfort food, plain and simple. At least at the outset, Black Ryder use a pervasive familiarity to their advantage. ""To Never Know You"" and ""Let It Go"" will trigger an instant gratification for the heavy-lidded, as Aimee Nash's vocals coo almost subliminally. And then there are those guitars, where there's not much in the way of attack and release, but plenty of sustain and decay, every wide-open chord wobbling like it's embedded in some sort of gelatin.</p>
<p>Problem is, <i>Buy the Ticket</i> never really aspires towards anything greater. Its referentiality does the heavy lifting instead of the hooks or new textures. So the vistas of <i>Buy the Ticket</i> aren't distinguished by peaks so much as slight alterations of terrain: the prom-night-waltz-remembered shot through a dusty sepia tone (""The Greatest Fall""), the <i>Screamadelica</i> comedown (""Burn and Fade""), the other various comedowns (""Sweet Come Down"", a lonesome C&amp;W duet via the production of <i>Is This It</i>). These are dutifully checked boxes on Black Ryder's to-do list, enjoyable enough but easily tuned out.</p>
<p>It's easy to attribute the lack of identity to the bulky roster of contributing guests-- most notably acts like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Swervedriver, who didn't have to alter their approach in order to fit in. That said, the most striking moments-- ""Grass"" and its chugging blooze shuffle, the visceral oomph of the chorus on ""Gone Without Feeling""-- do manage a pleasing extension of BRMC's debut. And really, that points out how there's still something of a void left in the decade since Black Rebel Motorcycle Club arguably jumped the ""Return of Rock"" bandwagon prematurely. While there is no shortage of bands trying to refract the pulverized beauty of MBV through a variety of filters, shoegaze more in tune with leather jackets, muscle cars, and marijuana has ultimately lain mostly fallow. Unfortunately for <i>Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride</i>, the badass-ness required to make a mark in this sphere just isn't there.</p></div>"|15110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15110-buy-the-ticket-take-the-ride/|5.6|Ian Cohen

A Louisiana-born, Brooklyn-based singer who previously released the album <i>Sanguine</i> and the EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13735-florine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Florine</i></a>, Barwick makes music whose raw material is almost exclusively her voice. But it's hard to know what she might sound like alone in a room. When she records, Barwick layers and processes and twists her utterances into figures that can alternately be described as familiar, soothing, alien, and tense. She might bring to mind the bright harmonies of Panda Bear or the mystical invocations of Elizabeth Fraser, but her approach is her own.</p>
<p>That's partly because her music feels homemade. We know that she spent a lot of time in church as a kid, so it's tempting to think of her work as a digital update on sacred hymns. The heavy reverb and layering brings to mind cathedrals, light refracted through stained glass, some kind of surrender to or celebration of the eternal. But while Barwick can seem to be reaching for these grand themes and overwhelming statements, there's something in her music that brings it back down to earth. It feels human, imperfect, and intimate, and the line of communication is one-to-one. Despite her music's often epic sweep, it can feel like she is whispering in our ears. So the sense of the sublime, which permeates every note of her material, ultimately works on a humble scale.</p>
<p>We've grown used to following along with artists from their first demo to their first self-released EP to their debut album and then their breakthrough moment courtesy of a company that specializes in caffeinated sugar water. But Barwick works slowly and carefully. She had a little bump with the issue of her debut in 2007, returned with a small-scale EP two years later that received a handful of positive reviews, and has presumably been spending the interim figuring out how to make something even better. <a href=""http://juliannabarwick.bandcamp.com/album/the-magic-place"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Magic Place</i></a>, her first album for Asthmatic Kitty, stands above her earlier work in virtually every way. She sings better, the structures are more patient and enveloping, the layering is more precise, and she makes much more effective use of instrumentation. It has the feel of a modest classic of post-millennial ambient music, the kind of record that sounds gorgeous and immersive on first listen and never loses its sparkle, whether playing in the background or filling a room with its swells.</p>
<p>One of the secrets to <i>The Magic Place</i>'s enduring appeal, the way it holds up to repeated listens, has to do with that aforementioned imperfection. Though Barwick's essential tool is the loop, she has a way of structuring them so they never seem too locked into the grid. They tumble and unspool and break into the silence like waves, but they are not easily reduced to units of sound dragged from a window onto a timeline. The imperfection gives a feeling of instability to these tracks. So ""Keep Up the Good Work"" mixes piercing high-pitched voices that a friend compared to the malevolent siren calling distant ships into the rocks and then folds in indecipherable low-pitched murmurs, hints of bass, and a piano line that sounds like a bag of pebbles falling onto the keys. It rolls forward but with an unstable gait, so the shimmering prettiness of the layers never feels too ordered and predictable.</p>
<p>She takes a similar approach on ""Cloak"", but the effect is less creepy and leans more in the direction of awe, a mini celebration of the idea of ethereality. ""Prizewinning"" combines her high/low voices in loops that spread like fractals with a marching guitar/drum figure that bores through the center of the track and makes it feel a little like two complementary songs playing at once. It's in these moments, where loops dangle and collide but don't quite line up, that Barwick seems most indebted to the process music of Eno. The way the units of sound in <i>Thursday Afternoon</i> and the reconstituted Pachelbel of <i>Discreet Music</i> develop bears a marked similarity to the easy unpredictability these tracks present.</p>
<p>Is something beautiful and ethereal that feels timeless and transcendent enough? What keeps Barwick from being the ""indie rock Enya,"" which is the phrase that popped into my head when I first heard her music in 2007? It's not an easy question to answer. I want to say that the encroaching creepiness and human blemishes elevate Barwick's music above the soothing Calgon bath of new age, but I'm not quite convinced that's true. I'm also not sure that it matters. Part of it has to do with where we are living now, and how music functions in our lives. Complaints about the one-dimensionality of new age feel less relevant when we have so much music easily at our disposal. <i>The Magic Place</i> is music for a specific constellation of feelings. They are real, many people share them, and this album owns them completely. So while there are few identifiable words here and the titles don't really register, there's a hell of a lot being expressed. We may not need Barwick to go deep into darkness or to write words that mean something, because she has tapped a vein of expression that is rich and powerful and affecting and even useful. And for the time being, the vein seems to be hers alone, though we can visit any time we like.</p></div>"|15147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15147-the-magic-place/|8.5|Mark Richardson

To make ends meet, he worked at the Home Equipment Company selling venetian blinds, and it was his employer that sponsored his first radio show on KWEM. In May 1955, he played his first show live in the studio, and those 15 minutes are the centerpiece of the latest Johnny Cash reissue, the second in what will hopefully be a long bootleg series. Besides the fact that he sings only three songs and Luther Perkins plays a short instrumental, what's surprising about this short set is how awkward Cash comes across: As a musician, he's confident and clever with that booming voice and careful phrasing, and the Tennessee Two are just as energetic and tight as ever. Reading the ad copy for the Home Equipment Company's inventory of blinds and fencing, however, Cash speaks haltingly and stumbles a bit over his words, peppering his commendations with odd pauses and rhythms. He comes off as the exact opposite of the cool, smooth-talking peddler, and maybe that made him a much more trustworthy spokesman.</p>
<p>That radio program is an intriguing time capsule from an era when radio was much more localized when Cash was young and unschooled, and it's almost a winking punchline that it's followed by an announcement for a concert in which Cash gets seventh billing. It's an intriguing glimpse of the artist at his most human, before he became an industry. As such it's the heart of <i>From Memphis to Hollywood</i>, the second volume in Columbia's bootleg series-- a reminder that Cash started out humbly before he became legendary (the radio show was also included on a bonus disc in <i>The Legend</i> box set in 2005). Nearly eight years after his death, it's difficult to get any critical distance on Cash, as his music is so wrapped up in his larger-than-life persona. So hearing him in this radio setting is a good reminder that there is much about him that remains unexamined and unconsidered.</p>
<p>However, that's really the only revelatory moment on<i> From Memphis to Hollywood, </i>which collects demos and rarities and generally reinforces common perceptions of the Man in Black. There are 11 solo demos that he recorded from 1954 through 1957, but the only surprise is that ""I Walk the Line"" was originally written to be a dour ballad. We get acoustic versions of hits like ""Get Rhythm"" and obscurities like ""My Treasure"", most of which are performed in a necessarily stark way that seems to prefigure his <i>American Recordings</i> albums. Some songs sound good in this setting while others are obvious demos, but the percussive wallop of the Tennessee Two is sorely missed. It's actually refreshing that they figure so prominently in the Sun Records demos produced by Sam Phillips and Cowboy Jack Clement. It's obvious why the label signed the trio: These versions of ""Leave That Junk Alone"" and ""Big River"" percolate with prickly energy, and Cash exhibits fresh interpretive range. He and the Two rumble through an abortive take on Jimmie Rodgers' ""Brakeman's Blues"", which sounds like it's destined to fall apart, and deliver a poignant version of Leadbelly's ""Goodnight Irene"".</p>
<p>With a sense of organizational purpose and of local music history, the first disc depicts Cash an artist hungry for success and willing to sell venetian blinds to get there. When he signed with Columbia records in 1958, he and his family moved out to Los Angeles, where Cash continued to record and dabbled in acting. There are many fine songs and many mediocre songs on the second disc, which spans 1958 through 1969. There's Cash singing a taut version of ""Five Minutes to Live"" and waxing nostalgic on ""Send a Picture of Mother"". He does story-songs about outlaws and soldiers, some of which are still wrenching (""Hardin Wouldn't Run"") and some of which have aged poorly (""Johnny Reb""). And then there's ""Shifting, Whispering Sands"", perhaps one of the most over-the-top recordings Cash ever made, complete with narration by Lorne Greene, best known as Ben Cartwright on ""Bonanza"".</p>
<p>The portrait of Cash on this second disc is, unfortunately, fuzzy and poorly defined. It showcases everything we know about him and very little we don't know. His voice sounds just as deep and authoritative as ever, his tastes just as broad, his concerns just as grave, but we've heard him in these settings countless times. There are no discoveries to make among these songs, no secrets to untangle-- in other words, nothing that adds much detail to our understanding of the artist or his career. That's not an indictment of Columbia's bootleg series, which launched in 2006 with archival recordings that Cash made primarily for himself. That collection showed the private man away from the crowds and the cameras, when he had a few moments alone. Hopefully there are more volumes on the way, perhaps compiling his output from the late 1970s through the early 1990s-- a lost chapter of his life when he was considered old hat among Nashville hat acts and was banished to dinner club purgatory. That's a Johnny Cash we don't know very well, and a glimpse of the casual, private, work-in-progress side of those years would make him all the more fascinating.</p></div>"|15046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15046-bootleg-volume-2-from-memphis-to-hollywood/|6.7|Stephen M.

So they've certainly put in the work, outlasting many indie next-big-things over the last decade-plus. But they've also never achieved a hit on par with their peers in, say, Phoenix.</p>
<p>The disparity between the band's dogged longevity and their limited success isn't hard to account for.  Like so many bands who litter used CD bins and MP3 blogs, Tahiti 80's music has always been <i>just good enough</i> to ensure a modest fanbase happy enough to check out an album every two years or so. They're a wannabe pop act in search of that one really great pop song, let alone a whole album full of them.</p>
<p>Tahiti 80 have just never written a hook as strong as the ones you'll hear on ""1901"" or ""Lisztomania"", and after six albums, you wonder if they ever will. On the evidence of <i>The Past, the Present, and the Possible</i>, they're still searching for one of those choruses that lingers in your head all day, as much as you might like it out of there. The main problem is the songwriting, which could charitably be described as a well-executed but ultimately ignorable mix of lightweight power-pop and smooth soft-rock clichés, played as competently as possible and yet without an ounce of verve, joy, whatever.</p>
<p>But frontman Xavier Boyer's mimsy mewl is also a stumbling block to Tahiti 80's pop ambitions. Boyer's voice has all the character and dynamism you'd expect from a second tier indie-pop band, however polished the end product. Not that Phoenix's Thomas Mars is Marvin Gaye in the pipes department, but he can honestly get across pop ecstasy, even if it's the laid-back sort. Of course when you call your second album <i>Wallpaper For the Soul</i>, you might as well be announcing that your ambitions don't extend much beyond making incredibly slick background music for the Adult Alternative set. Same as it ever was then on <i>The Past, the Present, and the Possible</i>, though as indie-as-background-music goes you could do a lot worse, especially these days.</p>
<p>Like many French bands, Tahiti 80 mine heartbreak and hedonism equally, and while their music may sound lovesick, the overall vibe is also one of sun, sand, and good times. It's a trip-to-the-beach soundtrack, in other words, at least if the beach we're talking about is in Ibiza. Perhaps rather than a pop album, where it pales, it's better to think of <i>The Past, the Present, and the Possible</i> as one of those (often French) chill-out comps that were everywhere around the turn of the millennium, where it would be a stand-out. Plus compared to the glut of (mostly American) indie bands exploring a similar beachcombing sound recently, Tahiti's grasp of basic songwriting makes them sound more like pop geniuses than pop wannabes. Like most bands who list the Beach Boys as an influence, Tahiti 80 are kidding themselves if they think they've even reached a <i>Surf's Up</i> level of quality here, but compared to the bulk of the chillwave crew,  they're Phil Spector and Brian Wilson rolled into one.</p></div>"|15138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15138-the-past-the-present-and-the-possible/|5.0|Jess Harvell

They're so close to being a straightforward indie rock band that it's temping to place them as some sort of prog-pop spin on early Death Cab. But they're not a straightforward indie rock band. They're half that and half something odder. It's not just the cues they take from electronic and ambient music; they have a strange way of constructing songs, from the lyrics on down. Verses have no rhyme scheme, chord progressions seem drawn from a hat. It's as though the band had all the pieces for comfortable indie pop in its possession but no interest in putting them into a standard order.</p>
<p>This is of course what makes them interesting. They are bound to confound your expectations several times on any given album, and if you're into that, they're good enough at putting these weird songs together that they can pull you in with surprising ease. <i>Discontinued Perfume</i> is the band's fifth album, and on this record they've struck a nice balance between building moody, memorable songs and keeping listeners off balance. Acoustic guitar plays an important role on the album as a center for most of the songs, but it's often set against pounding drums or noticeably synthetic keyboard sounds. Michael Kentoff's gentle, high tenor, wrapped in a blanket of reverb throughout the album, acts as a sort of thread tying those disparate sounds together, while the electric guitars take on a variety of destabilizing roles, intoning with ragged melody lines, atmospheric accents, and even a couple of outbursts of back-masked squirming on ""The Clock Tower"".</p>
<p>That song is one of the album's highlights, making good use of a simple piano part to keep the song's momentum building. The back-masking is a nice lead-in to the dream-like ambiance of the next song, ""Collapsitarians""-- the band clearly put some thought into the sequencing of the album. The title track generates a dreamy, psychedelic atmosphere, mixing the acoustic instruments on top of the electric ones and bringing in a strangely funky rhythm guitar part. The hint of funk sits in uneasy harmony with lines about people being wheeled away by paramedics. The album's best song is ""Artists in Exile"". It opens with an ambient recording of a crowded place (an airport?) but progresses into some uncharacteristically tight verses, which are contrasted against what amounts to an instrumental chorus.</p>
<p>By the time the song shows up in the tracklist, you've been set up by the band not to expect such open concessions to pop craft, so the unusual arrival of a strong instrumental hook hits doubly hard. This is one of the reasons it's important to approach <i>Discontinued Perfume</i> as a full album, intentionally put together in a certain order. The Caribbean have never been what you'd call a singles act anyway, but here you need to take in the whole picture the band is painting.</p></div>"|15143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15143-discontinued-perfume/|7.3|Joe Tangari

By the time the song, ""Why Don't You Sleep?"", gets to its soaring chorus, it paints a perfect picture of the insomnia and desire for escape that color the album. While immersed in recording demos for another project, Ethan Gold's physical health quickly deteriorated. He later learned his residence had been besieged by a variety of poisons before the health department considered the apartment unlivable. The titular ""toxic apartment"" was frighteningly literal, forcing Gold to move his recording setup-- and the rest of his belongings.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, the album was recorded in full in his apartment (though thankfully not in the one littered with flakes of asbestos). You wouldn't know it from listening, however. Gold's production prowess first came to the fore on Elvis Perkins' debut album, <i>Ash Wednesday--</i> a close companion of this record in terms of emotional and existential distress. So <i>Songs</i> is not so much lo-fi as it is low-budget. Nothing on the record bears the mild sterility of a professional studio, while snatches of white noise and sounds from outside of Gold's living room window are subtly filtered into the songs.</p>
<p>Naturally, most of the tracks that make up <i>Songs From a Toxic Apartment</i> deal with toxicity in the emotional sense. On ""Poison"", Gold's emotions are sent into a whirlwind as he asks for salvation and tries to stay motivated as the devil stares him down and his relationships are damaged by sex. The album has a childlike emotional purity to it, but that's not to say that it's immature or naïve. Instead, it's rooted in the fact that children don't obscure their hurt by anger or bravado or even mock diffidence, as adults often do. Occasionally, the songs are bogged down by grating lyrics or unnecessary bridges (such as on the breakdown in ""I.C.U. (Toxic)""), but for the most part, the emotions on <i>Songs From a Toxic Apartment</i> are delivered with an unfiltered, glaring legibility.</p>
<p>""Are We Recording?"" finds Gold tangled up in nerves and hunched over his mixing board, facing his self-doubt with fears like, ""We don't know what we're doing yet."" The fears exists even when he thinks he locates his artistic muse: He is quietly huddled in a corner, softly strumming a guitar during ""That (Reprise)"", singing, ""This is what I am,"" before letting out a long sigh. During ""Royal Flush"", he compares love to an intense game of poker, breathing in stale air and staring across the table at someone inscrutably surveying the five cards in their hand. <i>Songs From a Toxic Apartment</i> is a one-act play whose scenes are cast by one bright spotlight and minimal set changes.</p>
<p>On closer ""To Isis Sleeping"", Gold tests his use of dynamics by introducing countermelodies and pulling them away after a moment's notice right up until the dramatic finish, as the instruments fade out into the sprinkling drops of water falling into the shower floor and running down the drain. And just like that, the curtain closes on the toxic apartment, and you're left with your own four walls staring you down.</p></div>"|15092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15092-songs-from-a-toxic-apartment/|7.2|Martin Douglas

But though it was a joyful return to the living for the once-homeless recovering addict and pivotal figure of pre-South Bronx talking blues, the album is defined by pallor. It's grim stuff, built around Scott-Heron's ashes-to-ashes baritone and XL founder Richard Russell's skeletal production, caked in grime and rust. It's essentially a podium for Scott-Heron's remarkable voice, ever-wheezing and cracking, that both supports and condemns his life choices with its grippingly dark magnitude.</p>
<p>Jamie Smith, percussionist and producer of the xx, has become a minor celebrity of the post-dubstep Brixton scene, earning a reputation as a DJ with his MPC mastery and as an ace remixer, crafting memorable, expansive edits of songs by Adele and Glasser in recent months. Smith, like many liners-scanning millennial sound nerds, is a massive Scott-Heron fan, and at Russell's suggestion has taken a stab at recontextualizing <i>I'm New Here</i> in service of changing sounds-- you can practically hear him cycling through subgenres track-to-track.</p>
<p>It's too dangerous to question either the necessity or the motivation behind such a project-- 22-year-old <i>wunderkind</i> cinches cred with resurgent iconoclast, perhaps?-- but it will come up. Do your best to ignore the impulse, because the residue of death that lingers on <i>I'm New Here</i> is wiped clean from <i>We're New Here</i>. It's replaced with brightness, an energy, and a historical milieu. Smith samples older Scott-Heron songs and works them into these newer songs. He takes a rare moment of singing, recorded for but not included on the initial album, and turns it into the Kieran Hebden-indebted ""My Cloud"", a gorgeous and redolent centerpiece. He turns a broken man into a recombinant diva.</p>
<p>Smith recently cited the likes of Rjd2 as both a pillar of influence, and the music of his youth-- and you can hear turn-of-the-century collagists like Rj, DJ Shadow, and El-P all over his constructions. Smith also samples and chops unlikely vocal sources, notably a snatch from Justine ""Baby"" Washington's lone hit, 1963's ""That's How Heartaches Are Made"", for the intro to ""The Crutch"", before it erupts into a drum'n'bass burst. Here, Smith's finicky, hard-charging production trumps Scott-Heron's voice, overpowering it with ideas, if not focus. But there's a go-for-it quality to Smith's production that suggests fearlessness over reverence. On the opener, ""I'm New Here"", he lifts a quickened dash of Gloria Gaynor's ""Casanova Brown"", giving the voice some shape and depth, and slyly nodding to a polar contemporary of Scott-Heron's. This feels like quite a distance from disco, and yet Smith shortens the gap between Scott-Heron's proud missives and exuberant dance music.</p>
<p>Each experiment is a gamble; some of these spoken-word recitations were meant to be without a speed or brightened exterior-- a reconsideration of <i>I'm New Here</i> standout ""Me and the Devil"" is noticeably absent here. And this isn't a simple ""Is it better?"" proposition. The sonorous, Bernard Hermann-esque ""NY Is Killing Me"" is such a far cry from the hand-clapping original that there's hardly any comparison at all. Only rarely does something like ""I'll Take Care of U"" happen. That song, the closer, is the purest distillation of Smith's taste for spacious melodrama and cinematic sweep-- it'd have fit nicely on <i>xx</i>. These two men only discussed the music here, briefly, in handwritten letters. That much shows, though putting them in the same room is the next logical step both for Smith, who claims he has no interest in a solo album, and Scott-Heron, who is now back in the consciousness and ready to be pushed hard. Here's to reunions.</p></div>"|15140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15140-were-new-here/|7.8|Sean Fennessey

As time wore on, their sound sprouted psych-rock fuzz, which has since spread like kudzu to overtake everything. On <i>The Gathering</i>, their fourth full-length, there is precious little evidence of their former shimmering acoustic beauty. The only signal that we are dealing with the same group comes from their undimmed, aching sincerity. This quality that once led them to burden an otherwise lovely song with the lumpen title ""People Flock Not to the Good"" now has lead singer Dave Heumann delivering brutal lines like these from a Jimmy Webb cover, ""I was a highwayman/ Along the coach roads I did ride,"" with a straight face.  This stiffness wasn't a problem as long as their music provided  nuance and shading. On <i>The Gathering</i>, though, the sonic vista is flattened out, resulting in a dreary, grayscale trudge of an album.</p>
<p>It's a shame, because Arbouretum show signs that they could be a great desert-rock band if they loosened up. The churning Foghat riffs on opener ""The White Bird"" evoke the right  time period and headspace, and the pleasantly noodling guitar solos induce the proper middle-distance head-nod. Heumann's voice, traveling somewhere between Jim James' ""Bermuda Highway"" and Scott Weiland's ""Interstate Love Song"", enters high and hearty in the mix, and the song cruises weightlessly along its proscribed path for seven minutes. Everything is, momentarily, in its right place.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things quickly plummet off a cliff from there.  The fuzz-rock trance Arbouretum are aiming to induce needs groove to sustain it; groove, in turn, demands flexibility. And, well, you don't get much more rigidly inflexible of an on-record presence than Dave Heumann is here. With his strident vocals and leaden phrasing, he lends all the swagger
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
of a Calvinist preacher to the proceedings, and the effect is like Kryptonite to the groove.  ""There is a righteous band that's marching/ They're beating drums and even speaking in tongues/ They're passing plates along/ Clothed in garments of the sun,"" he quavers on ""Destroying to Save"". Time and time again, he hits his point so squarely on the nose that it hurts--  I know they're called Arbouretum and all, but did he <i>really</i> need to sing ""Let's go inside the forest?""</p>
<p>Sincerity, by itself, is no musical sin. But it makes a pretty egregious mismatch to the music Arbouretum have found themselves making. Queens of the Stone Age, masters of the bleary desert-rock form, found the perfect mantra to complement their sun-baked throb on ""Walking on Sidewalks""; ""I wish we could get away/ Drink wine and screw."" Sloganeering over this stuff just produces headaches and squinting. No one likes to be hectored when they're trying to bliss out. Arbouretum were once a very good folk-rock outfit; they might want to consider calming down, or unplugging.</p></div>"|15136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15136-the-gathering/|4.9|Jayson Greene

His chord changes are simple without being rudimentary, his lyrics are romantic without being cheesy, and-- perhaps most notably-- his output is outrageously prolific without skirting inconsistency. Since 2009, the Fresh &amp; Onlys have released three full-lengths and handfuls of 7""s and 12""s, all while touring regularly and taking a long enough ""break"" for Cohen to release his second solo set, <i>Laugh Tracks</i> (following the limited-edition <i>The Two Sides of Tim Cohen</i>). After the praise for fall's <i>Play It Strange</i>, you could expect Cohen to take a little break-- or at least wring a little more life out of a record that was released barely four months ago. But that is not Tim Cohen's way; instead, we've been given the separate-but-simultaneous release of a new LP and EP from a good songwriter who can't seem to stop writing songs.</p>
<p>The big draw here is the album, <i>Magic Trick,</i> a collection that leans heavily on the well-worn themes of heartbreak and mortality. ""Love,"" Cohen croons on acoustic ballad ""Legerdemain"", ""is a trick of the heart/ A twist of the arm."" Rife with background singers, a cascading bassline, and subtle piano, the song is reminiscent of Conway Twitty, at least before the its thunderous, noisy ending. Like <i>Laugh Tracks</i>, <i>Magic Trick</i> is more restrained than Cohen's work with the Fresh &amp; Onlys, but the latter album is marked with a sense of nuance, a likely consequence of its being his first LP since recording <i>Play it Strange</i> in a studio with an outside producer (Tim Green, who has worked with the Fucking Champs and Comets on Fire). Spacey effects wobble throughout ""The Flower"", while thudding, muffled drums gallop slowly but majestically on ""Sweetheart"", and the bouncy rhythm section on ""Top on Tight"" highlights Cohen's oft-unmentioned <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/features/tim-cohen-of-the-fresh--onlys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hip-hop influence</a>.</p>
<p><i>Bad Blood</i> contains the same sort of attention to production, but in smaller doses. Opener ""Delicate Creatures"" carries similar ambiance as ""The Flower"", here bookended by ringing guitars. And while distant keyboards punctuate the EP's title track, a little less focus was put into the sonic aspects of this shorter set of songs. <i>Bad Blood</i> is yet another solid set, however, often marrying feelings of struggle to Cohen's brightest pop numbers yet.</p>
<p>Despite being so consistent, there are clear standouts. ""I and I Will Be"" and ""Hey Little One"" are pop songs too bouncy for the driving garage of his main band, but they fit perfectly into the grab-bag of styles featured in his solo work. <i>Magic Trick</i> closer ""I Looked Up"" is the highlight of both offerings, with Cohen indulging in his gift for balladry, building on top of something heartfelt and quiet with a climactic crescendo that includes a tempo change and a makeshift choir.</p>
<p>Given the amount of Fresh &amp; Onlys material already out there, it's unlikely <i>Magic Trick</i> and <i>Bad Blood</i> will usher new fans into the fold, but that's not why they exist. As Tim Cohen continues building his impressive catalog, it seems he can't help but document the progress of his songwriting. Recording music, collecting the most cohesive bits together, and throwing it all into the either multiple times a year seems to be the only working process he knows, the magic trick that he never messes up. And fans of his work-- a number that seems to grow little by little every year-- benefit greatly by having so many of his songs at their disposal.</p></div>"|15142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15142-magic-trick-bad-blood-ep/|7.3|Martin Douglas

Shaggy folk traditionalists Fleet Foxes are the city's most successful band of the moment, and Sub Pop is hoping to replicate that success with the more charismatic but also more conventional young outfit the Head and the Heart. Swing a banjo in that town, and you're likely to hit any number of other equally rootsy bands.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why this music could take root in Seattle, surrounded as it is by fertile farmland and the natural inspiration of mountain ranges, rainforests, and scenic waterways. But it's worth remembering that Seattle is also a dark, gray, miserable puddle most of the year. Sure, it's great to lay out in a field and strum your guitar, but 10 months out of 12, your ass is gonna get soaked right through. And it's a place not without its own (admittedly aerospace) rustbelt and daylight hatchet murders and killer cops and all the claustrophobia of city life compounded with all the isolation of the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the Cave Singers, a Rain City trio whose latest batch of rustic blues reflects a Pacific Northwest slightly less idyllic than their peers might lead you to imagine.  Cave Singers' Pete Quirk, Derek Fudesco, and Marty Lund came to Americana from, respectively, the seedy new wave of Hint Hint, the grim punk rock of Murder City Devils, and the opulent analog synth prog of Cobra High. No surprise then that some of those darker moods would show up in the Cave Singers' more stripped-down arrangements (and, really, you can only get so opulent on a floor tom).</p>
<p>On <i>No Witch</i>, their third album-- and first since leaving Matador for Jagjaguwar-- this dark streak is most apparent on the back-to-back songs ""Black Leaf"" and ""Falls"", which together lend the album an early center of gravity. On the former, Fudesco plays a circling electric guitar riff over a stomp-and-clap rhythm accented with flares of organ while Quirk rasps shaky and feverish. The latter slows the same elements down to a menacing guitar lope and backbeat then adds brass and gospel singers to Quirk's bleak muttering. The album ends with the desolate droning of ""Faze Wave"" and the relatively overdriven blues of ""No Prosecution If We Bail"".</p>
<p>Not that <i>No Witch </i>is without sunshine. ""Gifts and the Raft"" opens the album with some untroubled harmonies and a fiddle jig muted enough to not sound corny. ""All Land Crabs and Divinity Ghosts"" is one long uplift, floating Quirk's declarations of consequence (""it matters what you do"") on a light galloping rhythm, sprightly finger-picking, and a bright, rising harmonica tone. And then there's the shorthand mystic drone and bongos of ""Outer Realms"". But even when their songs are at their most hopeful, it feels as if it's in the face of some vague distress. The verses of ""Swim Club"" have a kind of easy, ambling feel familiar from previous Cave Singers songs such as ""Seeds of Night"", but then the choruses swerve into a worrying refrain (""the streets, watch out"") set to a similarly downcast woodwind.</p>
<p>Quirk has grown into his voice, retaining his nasal sting while opening up a fuller and more flexible tenor, while Fudesco's finger-picking and Lund's drumming are complemented by some of the most generous production the band has had. Like their revivalist peers, Cave Singers aren't reinventing a genre here, but they lend their local folkie scene a welcome dark side, and <i>No Witch</i> is their strongest album yet.</p></div>"|15130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15130-no-witch/|6.5|Eric Grandy

He has generated a substantial body of work in a short period of time as Pixelord, and his previous work as <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/gultskra"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gultskra</a> explores a much different musical landscape. Under that alias, his sound was closer to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"" target=""_blank"">Fennesz</a> or <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/gastrdelsolband"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gastr del Sol</a>, heavy on field recordings and abstraction. So he's fairly steeped in experimentation.</p>
<p>On <i>Fish Touch</i>, which puts four original tracks alongside three remixes from other artists, Devyanin displays meticulous arrangement skills, without which these familiar rhythms could be easily brushed off as mere copycatting. The stutter of UK garage artists like El-B and the ghosted vocal samples of Burial have been explored thoroughly in the past several years, with varying degrees of success. What Devyanin brings to the table is restraint combined with an eagerness to blur the trappings of all these genres; his use of video game sounds adds a childlike sensibility that allows these songs to be at once ominous and mischievous. But there's a certain amount of coldness that is inevitable in his music, which is so heavy on cultural references both literal and figurative. And that chill can be a bit confusing, because even when there is harmonic movement and melodic development, it's not clear what sort of emotion is being channeled beyond giddy thrill.</p>
<p>With its maddening hi-hat/kick drum interplay, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIq-lty7HYQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kiss Your TV""</a> throws down the gauntlet: Listeners have to make their way through noisy shards of glitch that cradle vocal samples from Lady Gaga and snippets of Russian dialogue about houseguests, while the bass gets buried in echo. The hyperactive arpeggios of ""Cybernator"" give way to an 8-bit blip solo bookended by G-funk synths and decaying reverb, and when a surprisingly bright bridge emerges, it's only for a few bars. The drums here knock as tightly as a good hip-hop track should, and without vocals, something needs to speak. But what's being said is not always clear.</p>
<p>The schizophrenia inherent in the four originals gets cleared on some of the remixes. Britain's <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/omunit"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Om Unit</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggdGMAiRsB8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reworks ""Cybernator""</a> by picking up the pace with some electro drums, layering those arpeggios over a much sparer template. Instead of squelchy interjections between bars, there's room for the beat to spread out, making the hook from the original feel fresher. The title track gets updated in two different ways; the better of these finds <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kidkanevil"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KidKanevil</a> dropping a slowed-down Rick Ross vocal over a simpler beat that fixes Devyanin's bassline into a more traditional pattern. Here the squelchy descending pattern becomes more ""put your hands up"" and less ""stroke your chin,"" and in this context that's a good thing. Pixelord has obviously spent some time sharpening these tools, but at times, this is a frustrating release, hovering between house-party bangers and introspective bass worship. Still, as the limits of quantized beats get continuously stretched and mutated, it's fascinating to enter the mind of a producer who doesn't hear the usual limitations and is willing to let his music travel in any number of directions.</p></div>"|15132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15132-fish-touch/|7.3|Finn Cohen

It represented the point where the idea of Sonic Youth (as boundary-pushing, confrontational guitarrerorists) diverged sharply from their reality (as a steady recording and touring act performing their ""120 Minutes""-minted ""hits"" for the alt-rock kids). And perhaps not coincidentally, the decision to launch SYR as a outlet through which to explore their more abstract ideas came shortly after Sonic Youth's first flirtation with Hollywood, having penned a handful of songs for the Richard Linklater/Eric Bogosian teen-angst document <i>subUrbia</i>.</p>
<p>But while both their <i>subUrbia</i> contributions and their early SYR issue <i>Slaapkamers Met Slagroom</i> yielded material eventually reworked on the band's 1998 Geffen release, <i>A Thousand Leaves</i>, in the decade-plus since, the SYR experiments have turned more imposing and impenetrable (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12096-andre-sider-af-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">live collaborations with Merzbow</a>; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7350-syr6-koncertas-stan-brakhage-prisiminimui/"" target=""_blank"">improvised tributes to Stan Brakhage</a>) while the Sonic Youth brand ever more eagerly courts the mainstream (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/26991-starbucks-to-release-sonic-youth-celebrity-compilation/"" target=""_blank"">Starbucks-commissioned compilations</a>; ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBWTcCumGVA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gossip Girl"" cameos</a>). However, the latest SYR marks an attempt to mediate the band's pop-vs.-art dialectic and, much like their <i>subUrbia</i> stint 15 years ago, the meeting ground is a teen flick. True to the series' experimental ethos, <i>SYR9</i> is a collection of amorphous, atmospheric instrumental song sketches, but created in service to French director Fabrice Gobert's high-school-set mystery, <i>Simon Werner a Disparu</i> (or <i>Lights Out</i>, <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Lights-Out/70139541"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">according to Netflix</a>).</p>
<p>This isn't Sonic Youth's first stab at composing a full-length score, but where previous efforts accompanied low-budget indie (<i>Made in USA</i>) or transgressive art-house fare (Olivier Assayas' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7346-demonlover-ost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Demonlover</i></a>), <i>Simon Werner a Disparu</i> is an accessible, if elaborately structured, thriller about a series of disappearances at a French high school, featuring an attractive young cast that could've stepped out of any prime-time teen soap on the WB. But beyond the band's facility with ominous soundscapes, there's a tactility to Sonic Youth's music-- scraped guitar strings,  vigorously stabbed chords, ghostly amplifier hums-- that easily lends itself to cinematic applications. Though I've not seen the film beyond a few <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vbhi0O5qtg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clips on YouTube</a>, the music effectively conjures the film's idyllic suburban high-school setting and the disturbing dramas playing out within in, recalling the California-hippie-dream vs. Manson-family-nightmare dichotomy that informed the band's mid-80s work.</p>
<p><i></i>The album comprises expanded and elaborated versions of incidental music crafted for the film, however, even in fleshed-out form, <i>SYR9</i> can feel frustratingly incomplete, with many pieces coming off as a series of loosely linked fragments lacking an emotional center. The band is liable to shift from chilling sound-effect chicanery to full-power rock-outs to playful piano plinking within a single track, with no internal logic or recurring motifs to tie them together; the most immediately captivating moments (like the motorik surges on ""Alice et Simon"" and ""Chez Yves (Alice et Claire)"") tend to dissolve into a vaporous drift just as they're taking hold.</p>
<p>But there are certain passages that-- in keeping with the spirit of the earliest SYR releases-- carry the promise of being developed into something more substantial on the band's next proper album, like the reverberating, melancholic refrain that unites ""Les Anges au Piano"" and ""Theme de Simon"", which evoke <i>A Thousand Leaves</i>' beautifully understated ballad ""Snare, Girl"". (Or perhaps the soundtrack's liberal use of piano portends a new mode of musical exploration for a band that's spent the past 30 years pushing the limits of the guitar.) You can actually hear the refinement process at work in the colossal bonus track ""Theme D'Alice"", which repositions the woozy, surf-tinged tract first heard on ""Dans le Bois/M. Rabier"" into an electrifying jam that betrays Sonic Youth's latent Stonesy streak, before an extended, ominous fade-out reasserts the film's grim context. But even if this soundtrack doesn't produce any blueprints for a future Sonic Youth album, it does at least provide the band's newly acquired contingent of Starbuck's impulse purchasers and curious <i>Gossip Girl</i> Googlers with a convenient access point into the band's alternate SYR universe.</p></div>"|15119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15119-simon-werner-a-disparu-ost/|6.0|Stuart Berman

He's set out on an endlessly convoluted route, using his instinct rather than reason to guide him. That rudderless approach has propelled a career full of never-ending left turns, including recent collaborations with De La Soul and Gorillaz (on the latter's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14008-plastic-beach/"">Plastic Beach</a></i>), Sparklehorse and Danger Mouse (on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13193-dark-night-of-the-soul/"">Dark Night of the Soul</a></i>) and Brazilian TV repairman Tony Da Gatorra (on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14489-the-terror-of-cosmic-loneliness/"">The Terror of Cosmic Loneliness</a></i>). Somehow, in the middle of all this activity, Rhys has found time to shoot a full-length documentary (<i><a href=""http://www.separado.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Separado!</a></i>) and record this, his third solo album.</p>
<p>It begins with ""Shark Ridden Waters"", one of the tracks Rhys recorded with Twisted Nerve/Finder Keepers co-founder <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4501-andy-votel/"">Andy Votel</a>, who lives up to his cratedigger reputation by shoveling in generous portions of the Cyrkle's cover of Bacharach and David's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJWsfhPmgws"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It Doesn't Matter Anymore""</a>. It plays out like a vintage, spy-thriller theme searching for a film, with Rhys intoning lines that belie a sinister undertow despite his wide-eyed delivery. ""I don't know what's wrong with me,"" he croons, ""but lately I've been feeling like I'm truly... at the end."" Such doom-mongering is at odds with the general thrust of <i>Hotel Shampoo</i>-- named after his OCD-like habit of collecting shampoo bottles from hotel rooms-- which opens byways back to the songcraft Rhys expertly mastered with his main band.</p>
<p>In fact, much of this album allows Rhys to extract ideas he's worked on in the past and breathe some new life into them. As such, it's hard not to play connect-the-dots. ""Take a Sentence"" is a warmhearted ballad flushed with gently parping trumpets that mirror ""Presidential Suite"" from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7598-rings-around-the-world/"">Rings Around the World</a></i>; ""Patterns of Power"" offers a measured take on the condensed guitar brawling of ""Out of Control"" from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7600-phantom-power/"">Phantom Power</a></i>; and ""Sensations in the Dark"" spins around the same frenetic Tropicália/mariachi mash-up as ""Northern Lites"" from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11835-fuzzy-logic-radiator-out-spaced-guerilla-mwng/"">Guerilla</a></i>. Like most of Rhys' projects, there's no particular destination in mind here, no groove that he hits on and settles into. The only thing that binds <i>Hotel Shampoo</i> together are his agreeable vocal tones, which have a soft familiarity to them, whether he's tackling the environment on ""Conservation Conversation"" or encroaching on folky love song territory with ""If We Were Words (We Would Rhyme)"".</p>
<p>The tangible difference between this and Rhys' other band is the absence of any tightly wound electronics from keyboardist Cian Ciárán, although some similar instrumentation lends an endearing sloppiness to the proceedings. The rudimentary analog keyboard loosely splodged over ""Honey All Over"" only adds to its understated grace. The album peaks two-thirds of the way in over consecutive tracks: ""Christopher Columbus"", which equates a spurned lover's actions with the spread of western imperialism, all set to gravelly beats and a plastic-soul sax solo that recalls Deerhunter's <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Deerhunter/_/Coronado"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Coronado""</a>; and ""Space Dust #2"", a jazzy duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4788-el-perro-del-mar/"">El Perro Del Mar</a> that's pierced with Sirk-ian melodrama and a playfulness reminiscent of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood's duets. ""You couldn't even look me in the eye,"" she accuses. ""You had your sunglasses on,"" is his pithy response.</p>
<p>Impressively, <i>Hotel Shampoo</i> manages to strike the right balance between Rhys' desire to indulge odd whims, lyrical humor, outright pop, and heartfelt sentiment. More importantly, he always makes it sound effortless. There's no forced quirkiness shoehorned in, no conceits taken so far that they topple over into self-indulgence. He's excellent at reviewing and editing his own work, making sure all the small parts serve the whole but never overwhelm it. You can hear it in the out-of-tune piano runs sprinkled over a passage of ""Conservation Conversation"", or in the way ""Sophie Softly"" refracts into delightfully spindly synth tones at its close. If Rhys is set to return to Super Furry Animals any time soon, this album suggests that he's in rude health, both lyrically and musically, and that they may regain some ground lost through the uneven <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12935-dark-dayslight-years/"">Dark Days/Light Years</a></i>. But the man is an unreliable narrator at the helm of his own career, putting up smoke and mirrors at every turn, waiting to plunge us to unfamiliar depths at any moment.</p></div>"|15113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15113-hotel-shampoo/|7.6|Nick Neyland

In 2011, though, that moment of impending pop crossover is a distant memory, as the label's outsized personalities-- namely Lil Boosie-- can't seem to go six months without some sort of serious arrest. And yet Mouse abides, cranking out one elastic throwback banger after another and developing a seriously infectious rap style all his own. And here we have the hour-long Mouse solo mixtape, <i>Swagga Fresh Freddie</i>, proof of something I've long suspected: Mouse should be just fine on his own.</p>
<p>For years, Mouse has been the production force behind his crew's biggest hits, like Boosie's ""Zoom"" and Foxx's ""Wipe Me Down"". His tracks were more stripped-down, functional versions of the jittery synth-bounce jackhammers fellow Louisiana production hero Mannie Fresh used to make during Cash Money's first commercial heyday. More recently, Mouse has thrown scene-stealing guest verses on tracks like Lil Cali's ""Ric Flair"" and Jimi Jump's ""2 Pieces"" remix, snatching the spotlight from the other rappers on the tracks just by having more fun than anyone else. This isn't a Kanye situation, where a producer transcends his way to rap-star status by introducing an original persona that rap hasn't seen before. There's nothing all that compelling about Mouse's persona; he's a club clown who loves rapping about cars and money and girls. But he <i>loves</i> rapping about that stuff-- takes obvious joy in it-- which makes him stand out on a label where Boosie's helium-voiced gangsta paranoia is the dominant voice. And he's got a bit of Juvenile or Nelly or D4L's Fabo in his delivery-- a melodic snap that makes throwaway moments sound thrilling just because he turns every last line into a hook.</p>
<p><i>Swagga Fresh Freddie</i> is exactly what you'd hope for from a Mouse full-length-- all those great hooks and guest verses drawn out to an hour, without much in the way of filler or bullshit or anything that could distract from the party. It could stand to be a little shorter than it is, and you could straight-up delete the final quarter of it from your iTunes without missing much. (The world didn't need another ""Black and Yellow"" freestyle, and it's pretty jarring when Mouse half-assedly sings War's ""Why Can't We Be Friends"" on one chorus after delivering so many great choruses of his own.) But when it's on, holy shit: The two-minute ""Turn Da Beat Up"" is everything you need to know about this tape-- a ridiculously propulsive bounce track that recalls hundreds of forgotten early-90s New Orleans bounce hits and never pauses for anything as pedestrian as an actual rap verse.</p>
<p>""Cartoon"", which originally appeared on Boosie's 2010 behind-bars album <i>Incarcerated</i>, is even better. The whole track has a deliriously, irresistibly dumb concept-- Mouse feels like he's living in a cartoon-- and he commits to it with the gusto of someone who loves what he's doing. The complete chorus: ""Going Spongebob on em! Going Ninja Turtle on em! Going Bart Simpson on em! I'ma transform on em! Going Bugs Bunny on em! Going Mickey Mouse on em! Going Blues Clues on em! In a <i>cartoooon</i>."" It's <i>so fun</i>, and even Boosie gets in on the ridiculousness. ""I'm always in trouble, call me Garfield the cat!""-- that's <i>one way</i> to talk about your ongoing murder trial.</p>
<p>The whole tape plays out like that. Mouse impersonates Bill Cosby on one track and Shredder on the next. And you won't find any reference to his label's legal woes, beyond this line: ""I ain't thuggin', I ain't dealin', I ain't tryna go to prison."" That sentiment separates him from a whole lot of the rap universe, even if he is delivering it on a track about how he's not afraid to beat your ass. But Mouse's music isn't about tension; it's about the physical euphoria of relief. And in that, it excels.</p></div>"|15126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15126-swagga-fresh-freddie/|8.0|Tom Breihan

The songs that Banjo principal Alessio Natalizia lets peek out above the grey float along somewhere between the haunted bygone pop of Bradford Cox's Atlas Sound and the ponderous swirl of Panda Bear, their tempos and hooks decidedly impressionistic. In his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14749-way-slow-volume-one/"" target=""_blank"">review</a> of Banjo or Freakout's <i>Way Slow</i> odds and sods compilation last year, Pitchfork's Zach Kelly pegged Natalizia's songs as ""ghosted"": You can make out their vague outlines and maybe a sense of their spirit, but what's missing often seems more striking than what's actually there. The music's wave machine textures and gently lulling half-songs wash over you, and your thoughts will inevitably wander. Sometimes it's bliss; others, boredom.</p>
<p>Natalizia recorded <i>Banjo or Freakout</i> with Nic Vernhes at the Rare Book Room in Brooklyn, and Vernhes' naturalistic production style deepens the expanses in Natalizia's sound while maintaining its clean lines and immersive chill. What seems at first like a steely, almost surgical minimalism reveals rippling textural undercurrents throughout, lots for the ear to work out. But once you've wandered out into Natalizia's haze a few times and grown accustomed to the fog, you start to realize there's not always much behind it.</p>
<p>Natalizia sings in a sustain-laden, slightly otherworldly pitch not unlike Brad Cox or Noah Lennox, but he's got little of the former's slippery delivery and only a touch of the latter's bell-like clarity, with a nasty habit of swallowing syllables all his own. His self-harmonizing can be lovely and semi-narcotic, but Natalizia's voice doesn't have quite enough character to drive his ineffectual songs.<span> </span>""Go Ahead"" and ""Move Out"" fare well enough and the throaty ""Can't Be Mad For Nothing"" feels like ""My Girls"" in greyscale. But save a few darker flutters that cop a move or two from <i>Amnesiac</i>-era Radiohead and the gorgeous up-from-underneath gurgle of closer ""I Don't Want to Start All Over Again"", the rest of the songs feel meek, unwilling to assert themselves over the music's delicate swirl. Beyond a tricky turnaround here and a nice little vocal double-up there, these tracks feel frail, mostly just sort of whisking by, as though they'd float away were they not weighed down by the translucent synth film.</p>
<p>But if you take <i>Banjo or Freakout</i> as an ambient record first and a pop album second, the balance starts to shift in its favor. Natalizia's got a ways to go as a songwriter, but with the help of Vernhes, he's quite a sensualist, his snowdrift sonics capable of both delicacy and heft. There's a lot of territory covered between the shimmering shuffle of ""Idiot Rain"" and the epic Jesu-like crunch of ""Black Scratches"", and even if the hooks of either won't exactly knock you out-- and chances are they won't-- the luxuriant production does help push along the more melodically wanting material. Once Natalizia writes some songs better flattered by his sonic sense, I suspect he'll really have something here.</p></div>"|15137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15137-banjo-or-freakout/|5.6|Paul Thompson

His debut LP, <i>Replicants</i>, features a widened stylistic breadth and higher recording fidelity. These improvements should be bellwethers of hope for a genre (chillwave) that may seem to have run its course. But there's a serious problem: he can't really sing. Not that he doesn't try-- throughout most of <i>Replicants</i>, he aims for the rafters with high-pitched vocal yearning, with a very low success rate. Sometimes he can handle it-- the simple melody of ""Calrissian"" suits him well enough-- but it's not long before his voice gets tangled, losing grip on the song and wavering unevenly.</p>
<p><i>Replicants</i>' problems extend beyond vocal limitations; the real issue is that, at 13 tracks and 40 minutes, this record plays like a shiftlessly uninteresting, self-parodic slab of warm-in-2010 pastiche. There are attempts at Panda Bear's <i>Person Pitch</i> jangle, the cut-and-paste electronica of (old) Toro Y Moi, <i>Graceland</i>'s more drum-driven moments, Washed Out's sleepless nostalgia, and even the strung-out indie-pop of Beach House. No one's ever been arrested for sonic impersonation, but the album's unwillingness to sit still makes for an aggravating front-to-back listen. Its multiple false endings-- three by my count, and that's excluding the shambolic ""bonus track"" tacked on to the end of ""Synanthropic""-- cruelly prevent the whole mess from just stopping already.</p>
<p>Granted, this is a genre known more for shorter-form EPs than LPs, which leaves open the possibility that Diaz simply bit off more than he could chew and perhaps there could be better things yet to come. Still: If this is the result when one of chillwave's brighter lights attempts to release a musical product that's more than four songs long, it stands as a giant red flag hoisted above the genre's future.</p></div>"|15117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15117-replicants/|3.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

Each of his records, from the cinematic rush of <i>Harmony in Ultraviolet</i> to the dreamed-up cartography of <i>An Imaginary Country</i>, explores a specific theme, often in great detail. When he talked to us last month about the artwork for his latest LP, <i>Ravedeath, 1972</i>, Hecker mentioned that he'd been consumed with the idea of sonic decay. ""I became obsessed with digital garbage,"" he said. ""Like when the Kazakstan government cracks down on piracy and there's pictures of 10 million DVDs and CDRs being pushed by bulldozers.""</p>
<p>That idea, the notion of music as a cheapened, battered object, touches nearly every aspect of <i>Ravedeath, 1972</i>, a dark and often claustrophobic record that is arguably Hecker's finest work to date. The album is based on a single day's worth of recordings in a church in Reykjavik, Iceland, where Hecker used a groaning pipe organ to lay down the foundation for its tracks. (Throughout, you can hear the vastness of this place, as sounds ricochet around, bounce off the rafters.) With help from Iceland-based producer Ben Frost-- whose ominous <i>By the Throat</i> is a touchstone here-- Hecker then finished the record in studio, digitally adding synth wash and wailing shoegaze crunch to his live recordings.</p>
<p>The result is a strange hybrid that lives somewhere between the digital and material realms, and it's remarkable how seamlessly the two are combined. For example, in a track like ""In the Fog II"", it's difficult to distinguish between the organic church sounds and the processed ones that came after. But while there is harmony between the source material, <i>Ravedeath, 1972</i> is by no means about prettiness or tranquility. Hecker pits noises against one another in such a way that creates a constant push and pull between discord and beauty. It's a bit like William Basinski's <i>Disintegration Loops</i>, but instead of music aging over time, this is far more combative-- like these songs are being attacked from the inside out.</p>
<p>It's an unusual concept but relevant given the rate at which music is consumed and discarded these days. More important than the record's ideology, though, is what Hecker does with it-- the weight, atmosphere, and contrast he builds into these songs. Take for example the ""In the Fog"" suite, where over three tracks, Hecker lets dissonant squall threaten an undulating organ drone until it's taken over by wailing guitar noise in third passage. Or the two-part ""Hatred of Music"", which recalls an Oneohtrix Point Never synth shimmer before it disintegrates into distant industrial creaks. In each case it's not just about the wild, unearthly sounds he creates but the force with which they move around the mix.</p>
<p>Hecker is also smart with pacing and knows when to dial things back or add in softer, interstitial numbers when things start to become overwhelming. That's the case in the record's back half where he uses open-ended pieces to achieve the same foreboding effect. ""Studio Suicide, 1980"" is almost dreamy but has a sinister undercurrent, sounding something like the more punishing moments of My Bloody Valentine's ""Only Shallow"" heard through the walls of a neighbor's apartment. I wouldn't go so far as to call songs like this and ""Analog Paralysis, 1978"", which has a similar celestial vibe, ""ambient,"" but they are subtler than those in the first half and give the album a sense of balance and a natural arc.</p>
<p>If you buy into the concept of <i>Ravedeath, 1972</i> as an examination of music threatened by technology, there are pretty clear threads that pop up over the course of the record to support that. For one, it seems that the organ sounds Hecker captured back in that Rejkjavik church represent a certain purity of sound and that the digital noise battering it throughout act as the enemy, the corrosive effect. There's an ongoing struggle between the two that's mirrored in the menacing song titles and gripping cover art. It's important, then, that the album closes with ""In the Air III"", a track that features almost no interference whatsoever, just the plinking organ by itself. If I'm reading it right, it feels like Hecker's point is that music, in its purest form, survives no matter what you throw at it.</p></div>"|15124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15124-ravedeath-1972/|8.6|Joe Colly

These two songs are the inverse of the true-crime saga ""The Wig He Made Her Wear"", a standout from the band's 2010 album, <i>The Big To-Do</i>, about a woman in a small Tennessee town who shoots her allegedly abusive husband, a Church of Christ pastor, in the back with a shotgun.</p>
<p>""Go-Go Boots"" is the better of the two new songs, not only because it's shorter but because songwriter Patterson Hood is more interested in the aftermath than the murder itself. The pastor's ne'er-do-well son, with a pregnant teenage girlfriend and a job pumping gas, can't confront his father for fear of losing his temper, so his anger just sizzles and fizzles inside him, with no outlet. Hood intimates a sad arc to his life in a single verse, an impressive lyrical trick that lends the song its considerable gravity. By comparison, ""The Fireplace Poker"", with its curious guitar curlicue wrapping around Brad Morgan's stoic drumbeat, just recounts the details of the crime and sits aghast at a man's capacity for cruelty.</p>
<p>Enthralled by small-town violence (he's reportedly working on a film about a southern crime syndicate), Hood has explored this material before, documenting crime scenes in song and relating blood splatter and gunshot residue in verse while the band draw the chalk outlines on the floor. As always, it's the carefully chosen details that give these songs heft and personality and keep them from becoming redundant. Hood is telling stories that are rare in rock music, if not altogether nonexistent, and the Truckers boast two other songwriters with similarly distinctive styles and subject matter. Mike Cooley writes in a cursory first-person, emphasizing aw-shucks wordplay and wry self-deprecation: ""The Weakest Man"" is classic AM country at its wryest, while ""Cartoon Gold"" is his Zevon anthem, set in a dark L.A. bar seen through even darker sunglasses. ""I think about you when I can,"" he laments, ""and sometimes when I do I still get caught.""</p>
<p>Over three albums (she's been playing for five but only writing songs for three), bass player Shonna Tucker has grown into a sharp, imaginative lyricist, and her one track on <i>Go-Go Boots </i>shows she's absorbed Hood and Cooley's knack for character sketches. ""Dancin' Ricky"" depicts a dancer out on the floor with a tight shirt and ""freedom out in the open,"" which I read as ""tight pants."" Rather than depict this person as a fool, she paints a sort of antihero: ""Hey Ricky, don't let the Diabetes get you!"" Tucker cheers. Tucker may not have written ""Where's Eddie"", but she sings it like she did, in a performance that's restrained and soulful-- a bit of feminine guile to offset so much masculine songwriting.<span> </span></p>
<p>Eddie Hinton wrote ""Where's Eddie"", and the Muscle Shoals Sounds singer and friend of the Hood family figures prominently on <i>Go-Go Boots</i>-- just as prominently as murderous preachers. The band recently recorded two covers of Hinton's songs for Shake It Records' singles series (Afghan Whigs' Greg Dulli has also contributed), and both sides appear on the album, forming a mini-tribute to the troubled artist, whose success never equaled his talents and who died in 1995 largely unknown. Hood doesn't quite have the vocal chops to put across ""Everybody Needs Love"" as confidently as Tucker sells ""Where's Eddie"", but thanks to the band's exuberant take, it proves a potent block of southern soul that reveals the Truckers' range and sensitivity beyond the Crazy Horse guitar attack of recent albums.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Go-Go Boots</i> sounds like a slight retreat from that rock noise, indulging Cooley's country jones as well as the band's more acoustic tendencies. It's a more dynamic record than <i>The Big To-Do</i>, recalling the ramshackle vibe of their first two albums. There's a greater textural range, from the noir ramble of ""Ray's Automatic Weapon"" to the spidery tension of ""Used to Be a Cop"", one of Hood's best character sketches. On the heels of <i>Go-Go Boots</i> comes the DVD release of the documentary <i>The Secret to a Happy Ending, </i>which chronicles the period in the mid-2000s when the Drive-By Truckers almost broke up. There's a telling moment when former guitar player/songwriter Jason Isbell asserts that that line-up was the most solid and the most creative in the band's long history of turnovers. It's no reflection on him, but <i>Go-Go Boots</i> goes a long way to proving him wrong, suggesting a band that knows where all the bodies are buried.</p></div>"|15125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15125-go-go-boots/|7.7|Stephen M.

At some point, it's good to recognize when music from an advancement-heavy scene actually succeeds as a workaday yet appealing synthesis of things that've already worked before. And when that synthesis is as broad-minded as Salva's debut, <i>Complex Housing</i>-- which reaches toward a unique fingerprint while still letting the seams of influence show-- that it clicks at all is an achievement in itself. Paul Salva, head of SF-area label Frite Nite, operates like the end product of cross-genre overload, the end result being an album that shows both the creative freedom and the unpredictability of someone who isn't in a big hurry to find a niche yet.</p>
<p>The trick to Salva's music is how it shrugs off attempts to pin down its elusive origin point. There's a noticeable stylistic affinity with the Low End Theory scene a ways down the California coast in the future-funk hip hop insinuations. But the threads that run through it touch on a checklist of important club music movements from the last decade-- neo-electro, Southern bounce, filter house, ghettotech, ""purple"" dubstep, turn-of-the-decade Dilla breaks, UK funky, pop grime, and boogie funk revival. It's less the affected accent of the kid who comes back from a year in England talking like a Guy Ritchie bit player, and more like the voice of a constantly moving Army brat who's let the dialects of five different regions shape his speech as he grows up.</p>
<p>The reason this succeeds hangs largely on Salva's ear for retrofitting familiar sonic tropes. Probably the easiest example to point to would be his cover of Robert Owens' ""I'll Be Your Friend"". Stripped to the chassis and rebuilt as a sparse, spacious yet evocative minimal-skewing revamp, the remake builds on a recognition of what made the original work rhythmically, shuffling roles around in its thorough modernization of an early-90s house anthem. The bassline becomes a minimoog melody, the 4/4 gains a slippery, skip-rhythm pulse, and the vocal is drawn out into hypnotic, delayed-payoff repetition mid-sentence (""I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your""). It's a good way to nod back to old heads, and it gives Salva's music a bit of grounding in a historical context that goes deeper than the past 10 years.</p>
<p>But the stuff that sticks to variants of more recent developments falls into place just as well, aided by a crowdpleasing notion of how a good melodic hook can be the same thing as a good rhythmic hook. It's most appealing, and most characteristic of an actual game plan, when there's at least a couple of those hooks jostling for space until they finally intersect. ""Beached"" pits buzzing, choppy synths against elastic digital space-funk bass and lets them work in tandem as a sort of dueling riff-break. And the dubstep-leaning ""Blue"" pulls off a similar trick with a rapid, hyperactive succession of shuddering throbs and warbles strung together and given a unifying structure by an intricate, Swiss-precise stagger-step backbeat.</p>
<p>The simpler and less frantic things get, the more pedestrian a track can feel-- the glimmering electro-house/UK funky fusion of ""Keys Open Doors"" and the shamelessly (yet effectively) Joker-aping ""Icey"" are catchy, but nothing earth-shaking-- yet even those moments still carry the weight of music that sounds like it comes from a place of genuine adventurousness. As much of a polyglot parade of signifiers as it sometimes threatens to become, <i>Complex Housing</i> coheres enough to make the quartet of other producers' remixes tacked on at the end feel like a distracting afterthought (even if they'd be good enough for a high-grade EP on their own). Underneath all the familiar sounds is the imprint of someone who knows how to make the pieces actually fit, and if it's still an issue of working out the difference between distillation and construction, at least this first step of progress has some engaging energy to it. <span> Salva's clearly been listening to all the right records-- and learning all the right lessons.</span></p></div>"|15098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15098-complex-housing/|7.6|Nate Patrin

The photograph frames McBride as a custodian staring pensively at his collected wares. But his curatorial role doesn't stop short at his hardware collection. His work here, and as one-half of <a href=""http://xenoandoaklander.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Xeno and Oaklander</a>, pays slavish homage to the anti-rock artifice of the coldwave scene from the early 1980s, much of which has been revived, reissued, and subsequently regurgitated via the <a href=""http://minimalwave.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Minimal Wave</a> label. <i>You Today</i> is an attempt by McBride to feed through another oblique Xerox of that era, where austere vocals are stiffly reinforced by frigid layers of synths, all set in rigid motion by the brutal clop of a vintage step sequencer.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's a skill at work that's undoubtedly impressive. The world may have stopped turning for McBride with the spread of glasnost across the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s, but he's probably spent most of his time between then and now finely honing his craft. Opener ""Occupy These Terms"" is layered with synth rhythms that interlock and break apart at just the right moments. The alacrity of the tinny drum machine pulls this work in line with the Futurists' love of speed and motion, while lyrics about the decaying of ""aging walls"" that highlight ""a need to change"" mirror that movement's fetishization of the industrial city and a desire for humankind to rise up against the natural world. Those concepts are strung throughout <i>You Today</i>, with McBride often finding himself in perpetual motion, singing about ""a strategy for moving around"" (on ""Sidestreets"") and ""moving back along lost tracks"" (on ""Secret Stores""). He twins those speed/anti-nature slants on ""The Empty Sand"", although his bloodless delivery never hints at any emotion felt by the events he sings about.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Deadpan vocals are a basic facet of coldwave, of course, but the colorless utterances here cause a sense of ennui to seep through the cracks after a while. Sadly, the sole attempt to break with protocol, in the minutely higher range flexed on ""Still a Part"", only serves to further highlight his shortcomings as a singer. Despite such deficiencies, the album occasionally bristles with invention, mainly when the urge to stray into overt pop territory is quashed. ""Some Days"" skillfully circles downward by matching contrasting light/dark synth inflections; ""Don't Let Me Go"" is built around a stubborn wall of spidery white noise that all but obliterates McBride's distant vocal passages.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Aside from those fleeting moments of inspiration, there's not much here that pushes this beyond pastiche. The playing is impeccable, but it feels like the work of an archivist. It explains why McBride's vocals lack conviction-- it's the one part of his arsenal that can't be studiously labored over until it's shorn of anything that's recognizably ""him."" It's possible that <i>You Today</i> would have worked better as a series of instrumentals, but even that wouldn't dispel the feeling that this is a journey that reaches deep into the past and remains trenchantly stuck there. It's a shame, because other minimal synth revivalists (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"">Cold Cave</a>, <a href=""http://lederest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Led Er Est</a>) have shown a way forward for this music, by skillfully extracting pertinent signifiers from their record collections and giving them a chance to breathe in a 21st century context. For McBride, that vision of the future remains frustratingly out of reach.</p></div>"|15123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15123-you-today/|5.6|Nick Neyland

But the reality is a little different. Muldrow documents every moment of her career relentlessly, releasing a string of albums that have bright moments, but mostly feel incomplete. Her latest album, <i>VWETO</i>, is entirely instrumental, which is unfortunate. Muldrow's prime appeal is the way she tackles even the most rudderless instrumentals with her silken rasp, briefly attempting to keep a track in lockstep before faltering into spaced out bliss. It's this loss of control that makes her someone worth paying attention to, and without it, <i>VWETO</i> is just a somewhat enjoyable but mostly forgettable listen.</p>
<p>There are promising moments, though. The slap bass on ""Strike"" paired with an upper register balloon squeak is hypnotic in the most blunted way possible, while album opener ""The No-No Chords"" sits dead center in California smog, relying on texture and loose, squelching bass to propel it forward. Meanwhile, ""fOnkRocker"" rolls so smoothly over its own g-funk bounce that it's insane that she doesn't attempt to at least throw a chorus in there. <i>VWETO</i> might flow beautifully from beginning to end, but it also rambles. Outside of those highlights, much of the album feels like it exists just to fill space. Tracks like ""fOnk Stroll"" drag on a few minutes too long and sound like she's fidgeting around in the space between the obvious influence of J Dilla's <i>Donuts</i>-era song sketches and a more fleshed out, modern funk.</p>
<p><i>VWETO</i> might be just another step in what is sure to be a long and storied career for Muldrow, but it's not the one that will match audience expectations. When she finally gets it completely right-- and it seems ridiculous to assume she won't, based on the glimpses of brilliance she's shown in the past-- she'll elevate Nag Champa and Bead Curtain soul into something worth paying attention to again.</p></div>"|15128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15128-vweto/|5.8|Sam Hockley-Smith

Kelly-- are truly weird. How bizarre can the music of Philip Glass or Wolfgang Voigt really be? It seems contained, planned; the curio is the choice to be so on-keel in the first place. One of my favorite aspects of Nicolas Jaar's debut full-length, <i>Space Is Only Noise</i>, is how thoroughly it scatters this misconception. <i>Space</i> is leftfield electro-pop, far-flung and without reserve, but it is also patient, quiet, and small.</p>
<p>Jaar is a Providence via New York via Chile producer. He is 21, he attends Brown University, and he already has several well regarded singles and EPs to his name in addition to running the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15062-ines/"">Clown &amp; Sunset imprint</a>. Requisite hot remixes: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15128-into-the-night-into-the-night-nicolas-jaar-remix/"">check</a>. He exhibits all of the earmarks of a rising techno star: He remixes dance music, and his early singles were released as 12""s on dance labels. He counts Chilean techno giant Ricardo Villalobos as a prime inspiration. Little with Jaar is straightforward, however. His father is an acclaimed visual artist. His mixes play like outsider pastiche. There are conflicting reports about whether his downtempo beats-- usually clocking between 90 - 110 bpm-- actually move dancefloors (<a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=211"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jaar himself is skeptical</a>).</p>
<p>Here is an alternate theory as to why Jaar occasionally fails to shuffle Nikes: He makes weird, self-contained music that only lands a glancing blow on house or any other particular dance subgenre. Jaar's music incorporates lounge pop, African jazz, hip-hop, and sound collage in addition to house and pinches of dubstep. The type of soundsystem most appropriate for <i>Space</i> isn't a sleek club hi
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
-fi but a Victrola in a stop-motion film (""steampunk house""-- let's please not go there).</p>
<p>The textures and ingredients of Jaar's music exist in the context of techno-- rhythm and repetition are clearly important to him-- but <i>Space</i> is not dance music. It's too slow, sure, but it's also too diffuse in its methods and results. Pianos, organs, guitar strings, and, most surprisingly, Jaar's voice all fall under <i>Space</i>'s sepia-toned veil. This sounds like a lot to take in, but Jaar goes to great lengths to ensure that <i>Space</i> settles lightly. The tracks are short, funny, and always hitched to a melody. He sidesteps impulses-- during the quivering ""Almost Fell"", for instance, or during ""Specters of the Future"", during which actual techno threatens-- to drift into full-on ambience, skronk, or extended beat passages. The goofy bass bumbling of ""Problems With the Sun"" is as likely to stick with you as the elegiac ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41535-rising-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Colomb</a>"". Functionally I keep thinking of my first listens to The Books' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/854-thought-for-food/""><i>Thought for Food</i></a>: familiar styles and influences are wafted under my nose. There is a lot of teasing recognition but very little realization. The record passes easily and quickly.</p>
<p>Just as Jaar's treated instruments blur the line between digital and acoustic, his voice-- calm and husky, somewhat affected-- saddles up to the soul samples and film dialogue that pepper the album and confidently blends. He hums earworms-- ""Replace the word 'space' with a drink and forget it""; ""Too many kids finding rain in the dust""-- that ripple across his productions. These voices-- Jaar's own or samples-- are more than melodic placeholders. The gentle house balladry of ""I Got a Woman"" uses a looped Ray Charles refrain and French film dialogue to evoke something more specific than the electric pianos and breakbeat can. Jaar is akin to labelmates DJ Koze and Dave Aju, who weave voices among beats in counterintuitive ways.</p>
<p><i>Space</i> never feels like a showcase for Nicolas Jaar; it's just a modest and well-decorated gathering place for some things he loves, a place for them to interact. This teetering restraint masks the true weirdness of <i>Space Is Only Noise</i>. I could understand someone finding the intensely self-contained <i>Space</i> a bit claustrophobic, but the album<i> </i>is most rewarding when you just grab a seat at the table. Because when Jaar chants ""Grab a calculator and fix yourself"" I don't sit there and think, ""Gosh, why am I listening to electro-acoustic downtempo future-jazz?""; I go look for my calculator.</p></div>"|15122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/|8.4|Andrew Gaerig

Marnie Stern is an exception. The music that eventually became her debut album, <i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i>, was composed in her bedroom studio, totally removed from the culture of rock clubs and regional scenes. The songs are incredibly distinct, fusing the frenetic finger-tapping of metal and the atypical rhythms of math rock to bubblegum hooks sung in a high, girly voice. It's no wonder Kill Rock Stars head Slim Moon took notice of her demo. Stern immediately announced herself as a singular, compelling artist, but she also clearly had some aesthetic kinship with KRS acts such as Deerhoof, Erase Errata, and Sleater-Kinney.</p>
<p>Stern's demo is now commercially available as a cassette-and-digital release on the tiny Dog Daze Tapes label. It's an interesting, if not remotely essential, document for fans of her music. The tape comprises mainly compositions that eventually turned up on <i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i>, though it does contain two songs, ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" and ""Dancing By My"", that didn't make the cut. (No great loss, by the way.) None of these recordings tops the <i>Broken Arm</i> versions, though there is some charm in hearing melodically complex numbers such as ""Put All Your Eggs in One Basket and Then Watch That Basket!!"" and ""Every Single Line Means Something"" without the busy clatter of Zach Hill's percussion.</p>
<p>Hill's absence is the main difference between the demos and the album versions. Stern's music is merely intriguing in this demo form, but Hill's drumming and production on the finished recordings enhanced everything that is great and moving about her songs. Comparing and contrasting the demo and album versions reveals a lot of Stern and Hill's editing process. Some parts were pared down to avoid unnecessary clutter, while other sequences became far more dense and hectic in Hill's studio. Pretty much across the board, Hill's eventual contributions to these pieces improved the material and brought out the best in Stern as a performer. As such, there's really not much use to listening to this tape unless you actively dislike Hill's drumming, enjoy the novelty of owning recent cassette releases, or require proof that Marnie Stern arrived more or less fully formed.</p></div>"|15118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15118-demo/|5.4|Matthew Perpetua

But who are they exactly? It's a question that largely goes unanswered on their debut LP, <i>Headbangers in Ecstasy</i>, a record whose most distinguishing quality is the fact that it really doesn't have one: Whether you wish to parlay Puro Instinct into a discussion of precocity or whether they're truly about their Russian cultural references (""Stilyagi"" loosely translates to ""style hunter,"" or, if you prefer, ""hipster""), <i>Headbangers in Ecstasy </i>won't do anything to get in your way.</p>
<p>Despite the chorused guitars and laggard dream-pop tempos, the facile comparison to fellow L.A. labelmates Best Coast are warranted. Like <i>Crazy for You</i>, there's a hovering sense of simplicity and nostalgia that isn't based in a certain era so much as Southern California, an area that produced Ariel Pink and then unsurprisingly had no involvement whatsoever in chillwave. But the contrast is also pointed, since whereas Best Coast indulged in classic formulae aiming for the radio of beachgoers, <i>Headbangers in Ecstasy </i>is made for poolside lounging-- and as attractive as that sounds, its actually the LP's biggest weakness.</p>
<p>This is the sort of music that is best served by immersion, and the songs are stretched too wide and shallow for you to dive in headfirst. It's pointless to argue whether or not the wafer-thin sound was the best production Puro Instinct could afford at the time considering similarly minded documents like <i>Real Estate </i>or even <i>Beach House </i>cunningly flipped their shoestring budgets, turning stray amp buzz, flubbed takes, and shabby mic settings into positive atmospheric contributors. Meanwhile, <i>Headbangers </i>is distractingly fragile: Skylar's arpeggios and soloing have the pinched treble of early Cure but none of its bite; Piper's unhurried deadpan muddles melodies, begging for more harmonies or reverb for support; and you can hear a bass at points, though its presence is all but theoretical. The ""KDOD"" radio interludes that pop up sporadically throughout <i>Headbangers in Ecstasy </i>attempt to present the record as a wholly conceived musical experience, but they're every bit as good at jolting you out of the torpor caused by dream-pop nodding off.</p>
<p>And that's a shame considering the occasional strength of the Kaplans' songwriting. The choral harmonies of ""Lost at Sea"" have a squinting beauty to them. Then there's the curiously hyped ""Stilyagi"", whose swooning chorus lines are proper Stevie Nicks but fittingly the impact of its major talking points are nearly imperceptible-- Ariel Pink's production is detectable only by the credits, and trying to parse the lyrics will most likely confirm that the title was chosen for its implicit coolness rather than its actual meaning.</p>
<p>But the bigger problem is that the second half of <i>Headbangers </i>takes its structural cues from ""Stilyagi"", nearly every song sleepwalking through non-committal melodies without either much headbanging <i>or</i> ecstasy. Titles like ""California Shakedown"" and ""Luv Goon"" exert an aggressiveness that's aspirational at best considering their owners. You can tell by the intentional garishness of that airbrushed cover that Puro Instinct have both the youth and self-awareness for more promising things, but right now <i>Headbangers in Ecstasy </i>is the image's sonic embodiment: pretty, vacant.</p></div>"|15089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15089-headbangers-in-ecstasy/|5.8|Ian Cohen

A collaboration between perfectionist superproducer Trevor Horn and theoretician/publicist/ex-journalist Paul Morley, ZTT released many fewer songs than records: In the label's early period, every single from the likes of Propaganda, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and the Art of Noise arrived as a torrent of remixes, extensions, edits, and utter reworkings. ZTT was, at first, essentially an experimental label--which is an odd thing to say, given that it promptly scored a handful of massive hit singles in the U.K. But its central experiment (a successful one) was foregrounding the principles that the essence of a pop hit had at least as much to do with its presentation as with its composition or recording, and that a song and a recording and a mix were three entirely different things.</p>
<p><i>The Art of the 12""</i> is a collection of various remixes from the ZTT archives, some from the label's glory years, others from a bit later on. (It's not quite a greatest-hits-- Grace Jones's ""Slave to the Rhythm"" and the Art of Noise's ""Beat Box"" are conspicuous by their absence; it's also not a greatest-mixes: The version of Frankie's ""Welcome to the Pleasuredome"" here is a rare one rather than a particularly good one.) ""Move with me inside the strange world of the 12-inch,"" declares the BBC-formal voiceover narrator who explains each element in the 12-minute remix of Frankie's ""Rage Hard"". It wasn't an entirely original idea (King Curtis had gotten there a few decades earlier with ""Memphis Soul Stew""), but it was a typically witty example of the way ZTT liked to put a frame around the mechanisms of pop and its marketing.</p>
<p>When Horn and Morley and their associates actually applied their understanding of pop theory to artists and songs, though, extraordinary things happened. Propaganda's ""Duel (Jewelled)""-- two wildly different interpretations of the same song, grafted together into a single mix-- is one of the most spectacular examples of their ""ABBA in hell"" aesthetic. (Propaganda singer Claudia Brücken pops up a few other times here, notably on Act's ""Snobbery &amp; Decay"", a song about decadence given one of the ZTT team's most decadently lush productions, and ""When Your Heart Runs Out of Time"", an unabashed power ballad recorded with Heaven 17's Glenn Gregory for the soundtrack of Nicolas Roeg's <i>Insignificance</i>.) The Art of Noise's slowly throbbing instrumental ""Moments in Love"" was famously played as Madonna and Sean Penn's wedding march. And Frankie's ""Relax"" went through endless permutations, including the ""Sex Mix Edit"" featured here, but its synth-lubed bass whomp is the most rawly pornographic pop sound of the 80s.</p>
<p>A few later tracks seem to be on <i>The Art of the 12""</i> for rarity's sake: the Horn/Morley duo Art and Act's previously unreleased ""Life's a Barrel of Laughs"" is a failed experiment, and Nasty Rox Inc.'s ""10th Wonder"" is a gussied-up variation on the Sugarhill Gang's hip-hop classic ""8th Wonder"", which didn't need any gussying. For that matter, (lomax-)'s ""Waiting in Vain"" is as ill-conceived as you'd fear a Bob Marley cover by an act with eccentric orthography would be.</p>
<p>Still, there are some great finds here too, especially a 9 1/2-minute mix of Instinct's never-before-heard ""Sleepwalking""-- they were a plastic funk trio who spun off from Pigbag, released one track on a ZTT sampler LP, and evaporated before this debut single could be released. It's also hard to imagine any other label at the time that would have (correctly) surmised that it would be a good idea to make a dance record that sounded like Michael Nyman (Andrew Poppy's ""32 Frames (Drummed Up)""), or figured out that Anne Pigalle's cabaret-chanteuse voice would sound better with electro-funk behind it. This isn't a definitive ZTT remix collection by a long shot, but if the label had a guiding philosophy, it was that there could never be such a thing as a ""definitive"" version.</p></div>"|15096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15096-the-art-of-the-12/|7.8|Douglas Wolk

Cornog has it pretty good. He's got a good 9-to-5 in a recession economy, working the tiling department at a Home Depot somewhere in New Jersey, and he comes home to his wife and an eight-year-old daughter. When he gets the itch, he writes and records in his simple home studio. When he wants to put out a record-- something that is happening with less frequency thanks to that day job-- he has a sweet deal with one of the biggest indie labels around, which seems committed to him into perpetuity and never asks him to tour. Not bad for a guy whose career-defining story involves an epic drug binge and a kindhearted rescue from the Hoboken train station. While some artists chafe against the strictures of domesticity, Cornog thrives behind the orange apron.</p>
<p>His imagination, however, is out there treading dingy sidewalks and haunting abandoned strip malls, taking in the saddest vistas of the Garden State. His seventh album, the gently elegaic <i>We Live in Rented Rooms</i>, is populated with junkies and clock-punchers, conmen and dead-enders looking for a hit or a job or just a break from drab misery. Some find it in crime or drugs, others in Internet porn or philosophy. ""Conman"" ends with the threat of murder, which is both ominous and humdrum, as if it's an everyday occurrence. Closer ""Three Ships"" intimates a big-box apocalypse, embraced by the narrator rather than feared. Cornog sympathizes with them all, inhabiting his characters as if they were simply different aspects of himself-- or different outcomes to his own story. Never straining for credibility, he conjures these people with a lyrical economy that suggests the realism of Robert Frank-- quick snapshots of Ameicans struggling in and with America.</p>
<p>Forgoing the bitterness that made 2006's <i>What Are You On</i> sound so tinny and doomed, <i>We Live in Rented Rooms</i>, despite its endtimes stoicism, may be Cornog's highest-fi album to date. Either he's seriously upgraded his home studio or he's figured out new ways to get a wider array of sounds out of his signature Tascam 388. Synths still form the foundations for these songs, and he adds texture with sharply resonating guitars on ""Backroom Deals"", a Lennonesque piano on ""When You Were Doing Cocaine"", and what at times sound like real live drums. Rather than slick, it's simply more vivid, adding a sense of keen majesty to ""Cold Ground"" and a long, sad fade-out to ""The Flames Are Coming Back"". His songs remain epics in miniature, yet the details are finer and more varied, as if he's switched film stock. The would-be filmmaker in ""Tommy Made a Movie"" keeps his movies in his head, ""where no one can touch it or the change around the words."" Cornog understands art as a solitary pursuit, made by and ultimately for only one person. Is that song autobiographical? Does Cornog care if anyone outside his home hears his music? Who can say for certain, but we're better off having heard it.</p></div>"|15116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15116-we-live-in-rented-rooms/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

They came out of the gate as a band that Meant Something to many people, namely fans of heavy guitar music and rock critics. They established a clear, identifiable, and exciting new sound, but their latest LP-- <i>Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will</i>-- doesn't change the pattern Mogwai have set for themselves on recent, often middling, releases: There are some anthemic guitar blasts, some prettily drifting comedowns, and one or two vocal tracks.</p>
<p>The band has regained none of its prior fierceness, but <i>Hardcore</i> is, importantly, the band's least self-conscious album in ages. There are no attempts to be <i>really heavy, man</i>. There are no stale electronics. The songs that wander out of the band's comfort zone-- most notably the Neu!-indebted ""Mexican Grand Prix""-- are the types of genre exercises a veteran rock band of Mogwai's stature should probably undertake. <i>Hardcore</i> feels comfy and lived-in, backhanded compliments only to those who didn't slog through <i>The Hawk Is Howling</i> and <i>Happy Songs For Happy People</i>.</p>
<p>The price for all this hominess is basically any lingering sense of mystery. Mogwai can chime away pleasantly during ""Death Rays""-- featuring the band's best guitar lick in years-- but it can't turn ""Rano Pano"" into ""Stanley Kubrick"". This is fine, as long as we're willing to admit that we get different things out of Mogwai albums these days. This is a record of savvy rock vets kicking at distortion pedals until something frothy emerges. I'm on board if the results are going to be as page-turning-ly melodic as ""How to Be a Werewolf"" or as playful as the pitch-shifted ""George Square Thatcher Death Party"". The mistakes are easy to forgive: ""White Noise"" is the band's most vanilla opening track ever. The slide-guitar panorama of ""Letters to the Metro"" will still your blood just as surely as ""Like Herod"" once boiled it, but it's merely the type of innocuous doodling the band has long padded its albums with.</p>
<p>Mogwai's prior output and general demeanor has made it difficult for them to be a group that fans simply enjoy. The band built its reputation on sonic extremes, and that purview has infected their reputation: deliver a masterpiece-- I don't think they have it in them-- or suffer indifference. On <i>Hardcore</i> Mogwai sound like they're enjoying being Mogwai again. I'm ready to enjoy them being Mogwai again too.</p></div>"|15100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15100-hardcore-will-never-die-but-you-will/|6.6|Andrew Gaerig

From other 1990s alt-rock survivors, this might have come across as a wholly nostalgic endeavor, a way to remind fans that he's the guy who wrote ""Debonair"" and ""Honky's Ladder"". Instead, perhaps because he performed alongside a small group that stripped the songs down considerably, it was more like a victory lap, an acknowledgment that Dulli, despite being written off in the 1990s, has thrived where his one-time contemporaries have withered. His older work has aged particularly well: His lyrics have lost none of their potent psychodrama, and the scouring guitars still sound urgent and frantic-- perhaps because they were never beholden to the arena punk of the early 1990s. More impressively, Dulli hasn't lost his fire even in his late forties. His recent material with the Twilight Singers and the Gutter Twins proved strong and compelling.</p>
<p>It's fitting, then, that Dulli follows that tour up with <i>Dynamite Steps</i>, a Twilight Singers album that resurrects his favorite themes and noir-rock sounds. He's our Virgil touring an urban American purgatory, an unnamed city that never sees daytime, with more back alleys than main drags and something dangerous, illicit, and tempting on every corner. We've been here many times before, and we've seen many of these sites. Dulli's only got a set number of tricks up his sleeve, and <i>Dynamite Steps </i>deploys them all: the vocal soaring above the maelstrom of guitars (a trick he perfected back on the Whigs' <i>1965</i>), the off-key croon that other singers might AutoTune, the delicate piano contrasting the gutter guitars, the sordid come-ons masking dark existential doubts, the sudden groove as if someone stepped on the gas. Even the song titles sound familiar. How can this be the first time Dulli has named a song ""Get Lucky"" or ""Never Seen No Devil""?</p>
<p>While Dulli's palette is limited, he manages to ma
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ke these familiar elements sound fresh and vital on <i>Dynamite Steps</i>, newly explosive and meaningful more than 20 years into his career. He's not redefining his sound (why should he?), but he is refining it, indulging the darker orchestrations with a more careful hand. Age lends his lyrics added gravity, as if he's become aware of impossibly high stakes, and the junkie/romance metaphors sounds all the more vital, instilling ""Never Seen No Devil"" with a caustic urgency and the title track with a hard-won transcendence. ""All rise with me/ All take your place,"" he commands on ""On the Corner"", echoing the preacherly exhortations of the Whigs' <i>Black Love</i>. The song's ambiguity is stirring, as the corner suggests music, drugs, life-changing moments-- all serving a seedy gospel uplift.</p>
<p>Dulli's never been the best or most precise singer, and his flirtations with key remain as shaky as ever. On the other hand, that's always been part of his appeal, his rough vocals adding a sense of damage and distress to his song, even discomfiting the listener. But he makes good, soulful use of his falsetto on ""The Beginning of the End"", shouts himself hoarse on ""Never Seen No Devil"", and shares a delicate duet with Ani DiFranco on ""Fox and the Blackbird"". But Mark Lanegan remains his low twin, lending a ceremonial moan to the goth anthem ""Waves"". He sounds like a Satanic throat singer, the devil on Dulli's shoulder belching brimstone.</p>
<p><i>Dynamite Steps</i> is Dulli's best collection since <i>Blackberry Belle</i>, and part of what gives the album its impact is how precisely and dynamically the album has been sequenced. Especially during the ""On the Corner""/""Gunshots""/""She Was Stolen"" run in the middle, he makes astute use of the songs' crests and troughs to shape the album into a dark parable. And yet, there's a conspiratorial hint that Dulli himself wants to escape this world, despite how studiously and extensively he has fleshed it out so far. ""You and I could go anywhere,"" he leers on ""Waves"". ""Cut your losses and I'll meet you there."" Dulli hasn't stood us up yet.</p></div>"|15121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15121-dynamite-steps/|7.9|Stephen M. Deusner

Yuki Chikudate's diction renders her lyrics opaque while still gushing emotion, and with the whorl of James Hanna's heavily processed guitar, they conjure an almost synesthetic merger of sound and color.  Unfortunately, the band found itself grounded after 2006 breakthrough <i>Citrus</i>, relying on hermetic, lacquered production and reworked acoustic versions of their back catalog to wring beauty out of their latest offerings, <i>Hush</i> and <i>Rewolf</i>. On <i>Fluorescence</i>, they're still fumbling with how to reconcile their studio-rat present with the rock band peaks of their past.</p>
<p>If the cover art and title strike you as some kind of prefab 4AD starter kit, it's for good reason.  While <i>Hush</i> took its name as some sort of mission statement, <i>Fluorescence</i> attempts to conjure a specific slice of the 90s where the cushy textures of post-MBV shoegaze were cut across with a forthright, feminized vocal presence and production slick and stylized enough for alternative radio.  From the first seconds of ""Coming Up"", <i>Fluorescence</i> announces itself as more vigorous than its predecessors and ready to recapture their prior rush, despite sawtoothed keyboards and traded vocal hooks that are relative experiments for Asobi Seksu.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the squint-inducing brightness sheds too much exposure on Chikudate's chirpy vocals-- still an acquired taste to those who don't gravitate toward J-pop. On ""Counterglow"", one of the tracks that rely more on subliminal drone than pulverizing sonics, Hanna's flattened moan is more effective.    Clear standout ""Perfectly Crystal"" is a richer rendering of the kind of climactic moments that, on <i>Citrus</i>, were occasionally subjected to brittle recording. In terms of sequencing, <i>Fluorescence</i> plays out something like the inverse of <i>Hush</i>-- an uninspired valley in the record's middle spoils whatever momentum the bookends achieve. ""Perfectly Crystal"" feels particularly marooned, surrounded on one end by ""In My Head"" and ""Deep Weird Sleep""-- near-interludes that ride out wobbly, traipsing organ riffs to no real payoff-- and on the other by ""Leave the Drummer Out There"" and ""My Baby"", attempts at multifaceted suites that meander aimlessly.</p>
<p>Housing only a couple of keepers, <i>Fluorescence</i> might initially feel like another letdown after the end-to-end excellence of <i>Citrus</i>, but that overlooks the challenges Asobi Seksu are up against. Whether you think of them as shoegaze, dream-pop, or some variation thereof, these aren't genres for which a whole lot of definitive albums exist-- if they do, they're unimpeachable totems like <i>Loveless</i>. With their grasp of tactile sensuality and major hooks, perhaps Asobi Seksu are best-suited as a reliable singles act; as long as they're at the level of ""Coming Up"" or ""Perfectly Crystal"", there's no shame in that.</p></div>"|15073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15073-fluorescence/|6.3|Ian Cohen

But his sound can be traced back further; when he's playing spirted power pop, you could see his music working well between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4014-matthew-sweet/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Sweet</a> and Better Than Ezra (if you think the latter is an insult, perhaps you haven't listened to 1996's underrated <i>Friction, Baby</i>). But while Telekinesis' catalog brings to mind a handful of musical eras, it can sound a little odd in the present. What Lerner has been up to for the last few years isn't exactly fashionable, which is probably why he and labelmate contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27688-the-love-language/"" target=""_blank"">the Love Language</a> haven't yet received the type of recognition they might have only five years ago.</p>
<p>Good for Lerner, then, that he's stuck with his sound and kept at it with Telekinesis' second LP, <i>12 Desperate Straight  Lines</i>. The record has some of his strongest, catchiest tunes to date (especially the sugared-up anthem ""Car Crash""), despite the continued reliance on silly lyrics (see the observation on ""50 Ways"" that ""Paul Simon probably said it the best""-- I'll give you a hint, he's not referencing ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fS_7Yp0hY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Graceland</a>""). But though this is his most consistent record, it might be too much so for its own good. On last year's stopgap <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14893-parallel-seismic-conspiracies-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Parallel Seismic Conspiracies</i></a> EP, Lerner toyed with a rougher, frayed-edges sound;  the experimentation resulted in a particularly terrible cover of pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> band Warsaw's ""The Drawback"", but it also added vitality to a sound that too often seemed to coast on Telekines' self-titled debut.</p>
<p>On <i>12 Desperate Straight Lines</i>, the guitars occasionally get abrasive, particularly on the stomper ""Palm of Your Hand"". But otherwise, slickness is the move here, as even the previous EP highlight ""Dirty Thing"" transforms from lovably slack to precisely ordered. But his approach could use some experimentation beyond just throwing in new wave guitar sounds, which sound foreign and out of place on the Cure-striving ""Please Ask For Help"". But if Lerner just keeps on doing his thing, he's clearly getting better at it.</p></div>"|15103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15103-12-desperate-straight-lines/|6.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

He had a productive solo career and was one of the stars of the Apagya Show Band supergroup-- his contributions as guitarist and bandleader helped define the sound that we associate with 70s Ghana today. But it wasn't until this past decade that Taylor gained any kind of notoriety outside of West Africa. <a href=""http://www.soundwayrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soundway Records</a> included his songs, both on his own and with Apagya, on its groundbreaking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2000-ghana-soundz-afrobeat-funk-fusion-in-70s-ghana/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghana Soundz</i></a> compilations, and he stood out as a guy with his own sound. ""Atwer Abroba"" and ""Heaven"", the two solo songs the label compiled, had a distinctive rhythm, a cousin of the Fela Kuti/Tony Allen backbeat that gave the songs a feeling of unstoppable momentum but felt much heavier than its Nigerian counterpart.</p>
<p>One of the best side effects of the surge of interest in West African popular music has been the revival of many careers and groups that had long been idle or working in the margins-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12298-mulatu-astatqe/"" target=""_blank"">Mulatu Astatke</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5491-bembeya-jazz-national/"" target=""_blank"">Bembeya Jazz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5806-orchestra-baobab/"" target=""_blank"">Orchestra Baobab</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27357-orchestre-poly-rythmo-de-cotonou/"" target=""_blank"">Poly-Rythmo</a> have all come back, and now Taylor joins them with his first-ever international release. He's joined by musicians from Berlin's Afrobeat Academy, which is comprised of members of Poets of Rhythm, Kabu Kabu, and Marijata, the last of which was active in Ghana around the same time as Taylor in the 70s. The band is important, because it's key to achieving a sound that makes it feel like Taylor never went away-- the material is fresh, but it has a thick, vintage sound that ties back to Taylor's old work nicely.</p>
<p>It must be said that it also generalizes his sound a little bit; many Afrobeat Academy members cut their teeth on Fela, after all, and that's clear especially in the rhythm guitar and bass playing of J. Whitefield and Patrick Frankowski, respectively. That should, however, be taken as an observation of style and not quality, as there's not really anything you could call a wrong note on the whole album. Taylor's songs are mostly newly written for the project, though the phenomenal title track is a new version of a song he originally recorded in 1980 after his first wife left him-- in the song, he compares her kiss at their wedding to a kiss of death as his guitar rolls calmly along beside his vocal. Taylor has made what appears to be a strategic decision to open the album with ""Nga Nga"", an adaptation of a Ghanaian children's rhyme that many people interested in highlife and Afrobeat will already recognize from a version by the Sweet Talks. Taylor's take is less frantic and takes a sort of slow-burn approach, his guitar slashing ominously against the heavy horns and spacey, snaking sax lead.</p>
<p>That flash of the familiar isn't necessarily a fleeting one-- if you're a fan of <i>Ghana Soundz</i> or, really, funky old West African music in general, you will feel right at home on this album. Taylor hasn't lost a bit of the spark that made his old records good (and we'll get a chance to compare more directly later this year when Strut releases a compilation of his old songs), and the new songs honor the spirit of that music without rehashing it.

When Polly Jean Harvey burst  into the public consciousness in the early 90s, her gravelly voice, outsized personality, and often disturbing lyrics gave the alt-rock world a crucial shot of excitement. That early work is still among the most raw and real guitar music to emerge from the past few decades, so no surprise, it's a version of PJ  Harvey a lot of people still miss. But if you've paid attention to her in the years since, the one thing you can expect is that  she won't repeat herself.</p>
<p>On<i> Let England Shake</i>,  Harvey is not often upfront or forceful; her lyrics, though, are as disturbing as ever. Here, she paints vivid portraits of war, and her sharp focus on the up-close,  hand-to-hand devastation of World War I--  depicting ""soldiers falling like lumps  of meat""-- provides a fitting setting for today's   battlegrounds. From the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMhemzN7sTc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zombies</a> to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPFjToKuZQM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pogues</a>,  artists have often gravitated to the confused,  massive loss of life of  the Great War. If it doesn't resonate as much in  America as it does in  Europe-- and it doesn't-- that's more our fortune  than our shame.</p>
<p>The Great War remains a rich and resonant subject for art because  it briefly caused the world to step back, aghast and afraid to look at what it had done. The collective trauma of World War I did indeed shake England,  specifically, out of the end of its imperialistic Victorian stupor. The rest of the world gasped as well: WWI hastened the Russian  Revolution, coaxed the U.S. into isolationism and a flirtation with  pacifism, and set the tone for a shunned Germany to embrace the Third  Reich. Culturally, the result was modernism, dadaism, and surrealism  continuing to overtake the giddiness of <i>la belle époque</i>;  geopolitically, it redrew European borders, creating roughly a dozen new  nations; diplomatically, the League of Nations, a precursor to the  United Nations, was meant to prevent war, at least on this scale, from  ever happening again.</p>
<p>On ""The Words That Maketh Murder"", Harvey blackly and comically  shakes her head at those post-WWI diplomatic hopes. After spinning tales  lamenting what a soldier has seen and done, she and her cohorts--  frequent collaborators John Parish and Mick Harvey-- break into the  jaunty closing refrain from ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeWC59FJqGc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Summertime Blues</a>"":  ""What if I take my problems to the United Nations?"" It's a hilariously  depressing coda; her song's character has experienced the unimaginable  and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help.</p>
<p>Throughout the record, Harvey sings in her higher register, as she often did on the underrated <i>White Chalk</i>, granting her some  detachment from her surroundings. Instead of owning the spotlight  outright, as she did in the 90s, she floats above and beside it; it's a  neat trick that forces listeners to crawl closer to her words, allowing them to slowly come into focus. The textural and tonal qualities of her voice are made malleable, a scalpel wielded with precision rather than a sword. On the whole, she carries distant echoes of her peers and successors-- Joanna Newsom, Björk, Kate Bush-- while remaining clearly and identifiably herself.<i> </i></p>
<p>Harvey does this musically too, incorporating traces of English folk, early rock, reverbed dream-pop, and  disparate familiar melodies (as well as ""Summertime Blues,"" she  appropriates Niney the Observer's apocalyptic ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7rAwluPfa8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blood and Fire</a>"" on the one directly Iraq-related song here, ""Written on the Forehead"", plus a close approximation of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olr2cDrFkCo&amp;feature=fvst"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Istanbul (Not Constantinople)</a>"" that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0M5MFryU3c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">originally played a larger role on the record</a>) as a foundation. With autoharp, zither, saxophone, and other new instruments added to her palette, Harvey crucially crafts sturdy,  earwormy melodies. If you didn't listen to the words, the record would  scan as beautiful, even docile or tame. Harvey forces you to locate the  real world behind a pleasantly hazy foreground.</p>
<p>Even considering all of the horror on display, this is her most straightforward and easy to embrace album in a decade. Along with ""The Words That Maketh Murder"", the bouncing title track, the  radio rock of ""The Last Living Rose"", and ""Written on the Forehead""  would all make excellent singles. They'll all get a chance, so to speak: Harvey commissioned war photographer <a href=""http://seamusmurphy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seamus Murphy</a> to craft videos for each of the record's dozen tracks. (Three of them  have already been released: ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/1506-pj-harvey/2382-let-england-shake/"" target=""_blank"">Let England Shake</a>"", ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va0w5pxFkAM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Words That Maketh  Murder</a>"", and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWBrWhrKchQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Last Living Rose</a>"".) As much of a piece  as this record is, its songs also work in their own contexts, and  despite using a limited number of players and instruments, Harvey and  co. locate a wide range of approaches to their central subject;  alongside the singles, those include the rousing folk-rock of ""Bitter  Branches"", the delicate ""Hanging in the Wire"", and the acoustic  ""England"".</p>
<p>Even a cursory glance at the album-- its title, song titles,  lyrics-- marks this as a very English record. Its pastoralism befits  Harvey's West Country background and recording setting (as well as the  fields in Europe in which most of WWI was fought, and where most of the dead are  now laid to rest). But it's less about the experience of one nation with  war, so much as one people. That those people are English  is Harvey soaking her music in her own surroundings and experiences. Swap out the place names with others, though, and  the message remains the same. It's universal and it's  necessary-- and it's powerfully and clearly stated. That it's also a joy  to hear is perhaps the most confounding juxtaposition of all, turning a record you'll respect  into one you'll also love<i>.</i></p></div>"|15120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15120-let-england-shake/|8.8|Scott Plagenhoef

But it isn't exactly overdue. In fact, over the past few years, the return of bands and styles from the Clinton administration has almost become cliché. Pavement, Dinosaur Jr., the Dismemberment Plan, Jawbox, and even Blink-182 have reunited. Guided By Voices reassembled their 'classic lineup.' And Weezer recently reprised their beloved mid-90s albums in their entirety at live shows. Among younger artists, the college-rock subculture of the 80s and 90s has been resurgent for some time, whether in the Slumberland-streaked indie pop of the Pains of Being Pure at Heart or Best Coast, the artful squall of No Age, the achingly nostalgic paeans of Deerhunter, the ambling guitar epics of Real Estate, or the slacker punk-pop of Wavves.</p>
<p>There's no escaping it: If you've heard anything about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"">Yuck</a>, it's that this London four-piece loves the 90s. The band's members are very clearly products of the web rather than any particular geography; their self-titled debut evinces tastes that run toward fuzzy indie bands from both sides of the pond. Yes, there's a bit of the wah-pedal guitar violence of Dinosaur Jr., and a little of the lackadaisical detachment of Pavement, but there's also the rich tunefulness of Teenage Fanclub and Velocity Girl, and at times the unadorned resignation of Red House Painters or Elliott Smith. However, like so many artists saddled (fairly or not) with the ""revival"" tag, from post-punk and garage-rock to nu-disco or neo-soul, Yuck are worth hearing not so much because of who they sound like, but what they've done with those sounds: in this case, make a deeply melodic, casually thrilling coming-of-age album for a generation that never saw Nirvana on ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120_Minutes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">120 Minutes</a>"".</p>
<p>As with their best peers in the Fat Possum stable, Yuck distinguish themselves by knowing their way around around a catchy, emotionally evocative song. Sometimes these can be bright and optimistic, almost twee, as in the peppy boy-girl endearments of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/music-videos/766-yuck/1693-georgia/"">Georgia</a>"", or the midtempo acoustic yearning of ""Shook Down"". Elsewhere, they can be gritty and urgent: Screeches of feedback occasionally drown out drowsy vocals on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15235-holing-out/"">Holing Out</a>"", nicely suiting lyrics about communication problems; likewise, the distortion-blistered repetitions of ""The Wall"" suggest the Sisyphean efforts they describe. Then there are the heartfelt mopers: the stripped-down comfort offer ""Suicide Policeman"", the Galaxie 500-meets-""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7851-the-top-200-tracks-of-the-1990s-100-51/3/"">Nightswimming</a>"" ""Stutter"", or the lonely post-breakup jangler ""Sunday"". Seven-minute closer ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12058-rubber/"">Rubber</a>"" is the type of gorgeously incantatory slow burner veterans like Yo La Tengo stlll make (see ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?hl=en&amp;q=%22more+stars+than+there+are+in+heaven%22"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">More Stars Than There Are in Heaven</a>"", from 2009's underrated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13413-popular-songs/"">Popular Songs</a></i>)-- not to mention Mogwai, who've <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15078-rubber-rubber-mogwai-remix/"">remixed it</a>-- but too few bands successfully emulate. Add up these different types of tracks, and you have an unusually coherent album-length experience.</p>
<p>If you've heard anything else about Yuck, it might be that two of the band members, singer/guitarist Daniel Blumberg and guitarist Max Bloom, used to play in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9916-cajun-dance-party/"">Cajun Dance Party</a>: ambitious and typically spazzy post-Arctic Monkeys <i>NME</i> faves who issued a Bernard Butler-produced debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12072-the-colourful-life/""><i>The Colourful Life</i></a>, in 2008 on XL. As with that former band, Yuck are occasionally guilty of some awkward lyrics-- the seemingly gratuitous ""crucifixion""/""benediction""/""addiction"" rhymes on note-bending love ballad ""Suck"" come to mind-- and it's hard to guess how long they can keep this particular sound going (a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEUGypp8f2Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yu[c]k side project</a> offers intriguing hints). But together Blumberg, Bloom, drummer Jonny Rogoff, and bass player Mariko Doi, joined on certain tracks by part-time backing singer Ilana Blumberg, have taken a giant step forward. As Blumberg sang with his old band, the one he started as a 15-year-old, ""This is now and that was then."" Or as he sings now, on instantly searing album opener, ""Get Away"": ""I can't get this feeling off my mind."" Whether they remember the 90s or not, more than a few people could end up saying something similar about <i>Yuck</i>.</p></div>"|15068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck/|8.1|Marc Hogan

Following the release of and tours behind 2006's <i>Gang of Losers</i>, the Dears founder Murray A. Lightburn lost most of his long-time band to attrition. That album had been the most successful for the Dears, though, with support from the label Arts &amp; Crafts and respectable chart positions in Britain and Canada. The Dears-- dubbed ""probably the best new band in the world"" just years before by <i>NME</i>-- seemed to be falling. While the split almost ended the Dears, Lightburn and keyboardist Natalia Yanchak persevered, recruiting friends and former collaborators to piece together 2008's <i>Missiles</i>. The change felt welcome, too, as<i> Missiles </i>was a textured, pensive album, tempering some of the Dears' bombast with well-considered arrangements. Lightburn soon got his band back, reassembling the six-piece version of the Dears for months of intense writing, rehearsing, and recording. That convocation, however, is about as happy as this story gets: Overwrought, overemphatic, and overly suggestive of a band that's using its second chance to go for the big time, <i>Degeneration Street</i> is a miserable album.</p>
<p>Everything <i>Degeneration Street</i> attempts feels a bit too emphatic. When it rocks, it heads for the arenas; when it slinks, it seeks the cover of low, gray clouds. That problem has two-fold consequences. First, it makes many the songs maudlin and melodramatic, occasionally unbearable. What's more, it makes each Dears approach-- heavy rock insurgencies, sweeping synthesizer ambles, big breezy janglers-- seem that much more polar. The album feels scattered and uneven, like a band without direction or restraint.</p>
<p>The individual looks aren't so appealing, either: During ""Blood"" and ""Stick w/ Me Kid"", the Dears race through would-be alternative rock anthems-- and here, alternative rock is meant to suggest sterilized Smashing Pumpkins, or something like Collective Soul-- with stock rock guitars and vocal effects as dated as ClipArt. ""Galactic Tides"" and the closing title track suggest the limpid, clammy post-Britpop echoes of Starsailor and Elbow, with studio tricks and ornate instrumental flourishes doing their best to mask songs that don't say too much. The chiming guitars and skittering drums of  ""Unsung"" are facsimiles of Radiohead after 2003, but the song's big, dumb chorus-- ""We're too/ We're too young,"" shouted for triumph-- conjures Coldplay in the worst way. There's a little bit of Arcade Fire, some Neil Diamond, maybe a little bit of TV on the Radio: From end to end, it feels as though the Dears are strewing sounds about the studio, making a last-ditch effort to make anything stick.</p>
<p>On ""Thrones"", Lightburn lets loose with one of <i>Degeneration Street</i>'s dozen or so lyrical clichés. ""We can't go through this again,"" he howls over swiveling guitars and smothering keyboard textures. ""Plucking your eyes out/ turn into stone."" In the final verse, the band fades into phosphorescence while he continues his tale of forging forward, summoning Springsteen: ""Saw it disappear into the dark/ All the hope we put together falls apart/ In a millisecond point zero one."" It's hard to hear those lines and not consider that <i>Degeneration Street</i> is a reunion album of sorts, at least for the six people that comprise the Dears here. Emotion, especially the feeling that you've got another unexpected shot, doesn't always pair so well with reason. With inchoate, banal lyrics and blustering tunes that go for it all, all the time, <i>Degeneration Street</i> sounds like the product of too much euphoria. Definitely catch the Dears on the comedown, if at all.</p></div>"|15109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15109-degeneration-street/|2.4|Grayson Currin

Over six songs the Auckland, New Zealand, quartet displayed an unabashed yen for vintage noise-pop-- cherry-picking guitar moves and clipped vocal cadences from the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Clean, and Pavement. They were good at it, though. The Chills never wrote another reverb-drenched gem as good as their ""Pink Frost"", but on ""Canned Food"" Surf City comes pretty close to nabbing that song's ominous but dreamy feel.</p>
<p>On their new full-length, <i>Kudos</i>, Surf City remains preoccupied with the college rock sounds of yesteryear. But this time around they've drifted in a slightly stonier direction-- away from the minimalist-pop moves of the Clean and toward the circular space-rock of Spacemen 3, Stereolab, and Bailter Space. Album opener ""Crazy Rulers of the World"" buzzes along on an endlessly repeating two-note bass riff. ""Icy Lakes"" goes one better, riding a single pulsing chord through eight minutes of swooshing guitars and reverb-drenched yelps. It's a record heavy on hypnotic grooves-- phased drones swooping through the stereo field while the rhythm section churns. Somewhere in the last two years, Surf City decided it was okay to jam. For all the static repetition, the band knows how to rattle the mood with a spare riffs and inch upwards toward a fuzzed-out crescendo.</p>
<p>Spacemen 3 used head-spinning sounds as a platform to float dour thoughts on drugs and Jesus. Surf City's message is more optimistic. Even behind a curtain of distortion Davin Stoddard's singing is chirpy and wistful. ""West coast dreams are kept alive by the hidden sunsets in your eyes,"" he sings on the album's title track. Stoddard calls the lyrics out a few stiff syllables at a time, frequently letting the background vocals carry the melodic weight. He's a front man who benefits from splicing extended adolescence with punky naiveté-- part Avey Tare, part Steve Malkmus. On their debut EP, Surf City had a manic edge--the band rushed through its songs with a jittery energy. <i>Kudos</i> is considerably more laid back and vibe-heavy. The guitars still jingle-jangle, just with a little more economy.</p></div>"|15106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15106-kudos/|7.7|Aaron Leitko

It kicked off with a collection of skeletal bangers, a succession of freewheeling, free-associative tracks that gave way to a few coherently thematic, melodic statements by the tape's conclusion. With its balance between unpredictable energy and the promise of possibilities, <i>Roachy Balboa</i> was a concisely perfect business card. <i>Roachy Balboa 2</i> finds Gigz moving from recognition of potential to the execution, and as a result it's a contradictory, exuberant, and confusing mess of a record, its ambition sometimes jumping ahead of his abilities.</p>
<p>The tape is all over the place, which can be simultaneously energizing and exhausting. Racks-- the DJ who mixed the first <i>Roachy Balboa</i>, as well as Young Gully's acclaimed <i>Definition of Gas</i>-- has a skill for sequencing mixes, knowing when and how to pace a mix's build and release. Given a tracklist that jumps from idea to idea with ADD logic, he seems to have thrown up his hands; it's uncertain whether these tracks could have acquired a stronger sense of narrative purpose, although he does manage to put climactic highlight ""Rockin and Rollin"" near the mix's center.</p>
<p>This isn't the record's only highlight, and individual tracks find Gigz covering new creative ground. ""Got Em Like"", for example, finds him working a simple concept, but moving in as many narrative directions as possible line-to-line. ""The Real Rosé"" shifts the archetypal party track by giving the intoxicated feeling a relaxed calm. ""The Moment"" finds Gigz addressing the Oscar Grant shooting alongside rappers Young Gully and Marlo, an affecting section that finds all three performers addressing contemporary political issues without falling into typical pitfalls.</p>
<p>Each of these tracks suggests that Roach Gigz is brimming with creative ideas. What undercuts this effort is that the ambition sometimes seems to reach beyond his mastery-- his verses can get lost within themselves, or his jokey asides don't quite connect,
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
leaving lines that run by you without an impression. Gigz's intricacies and free-association can sometimes seem unnecessarily convoluted and slightly overwritten.</p>
<p>This inconsistency is forgivable. The main problem with the mixtape is the production, which can grate too frequently; compared with the skittering live-wire feel of the beats on the first tape, the production here is a lot more melodic. His producers grab old pop vocal samples that give some tracks a generic feel. Combined with the lack of an overarching focus, the record feels like a grab bag, even as it tests future directions. Roach Gigz has pushed outwards rather than consolidating, which is probably for the best. There are some stumbles along the way.</p></div>"|15107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15107-roachy-balboa-round-2/|7.1|David Drake

At the time, he was close to completing <i>The People's Key</i>, his seventh full-length under the Bright Eyes banner, an album for which he had returned home to Nebraska to record in bursts throughout 2010. Tucked into the album's waning moments is ""Ladder Song"", a purse-lipped heartbreaker Oberst wrote on piano out of grief. When he sat down later to record the song in the home studio he co-founded with Bright Eyes producer and multi-instrumentalist Mike Mogis, Oberst opted to play it on an old keyboard rather than the grand piano their new setup afforded him. The end result-- eerily similar to ""Sunrise, Sunset"", a song from 2000's eye-opening <i>Fevers &amp; Mirrors</i>-- sounds very much in tune with Bright Eyes' beginnings: manic and rickety, grave and strangely gripping, Oberst spitting his words up as though it's just as painful to share them as it is to keep them inside. Here, on what the one-time <i>wunderkind</i> has called this project's final ride, its playlist's final addition stands completely alone both sonically and otherwise. ""Ladder Song"" is not just a bracing tribute, it's a throwback glimpse at how much has changed or not changed at all in the way Oberst has chosen to present himself and his songwriting.</p>
<p>Well over a decade after its inception, it's easy to forget that before Oberst's lyrical abracadabra on 2002's <i>Lifted</i> garnered ""New Dylan!"" hosannas, the Bright Eyes brand got its first bit of traction amongst emo kids. Leagues of them. Oberst was a pin-up-- his hair always swept perfectly across his sad, massive, Milk-Dud eyes-- fit to erupt in small rooms like those in which he first recorded. In the years that followed <i>Lifted'</i>s release, he left behind his handcrafted, attic-pop leanings to fully embrace American roots music. It was a path he hit all the harder as his audience and profile grew. From pure folk to ham-fisted honky tonky to the classic rock of his Mystic Valley band, each subsequent release employed a recording method to match the ambition of Oberst's increasingly dystopian lyricbook. That trajectory reached a pivotal point in 2007's <i>Cassadaga</i>, a cinematic, string-embossed epic that found Oberst in all those modes at once, engaging even further with themes both mystic and apocalyptic. Despite its flaws, that record seemed the loudest expression of what Bright Eyes had seemingly always been about: articulating the world's many weights, as he meant to carry them around. <i>The People's Key</i>, its sci-fi successor, breaks from the narrative. It doesn't articulate much at all.</p>
<p>While a few traces of pedal steel remain, Oberst, Mogis, and recently anointed permanent member/keyboardist Nate Walcott (with few exceptions Bright Eyes' cast tended to revolve) have given the former's songwriting a new sonic skin. Gone is the ""rootsy Americana shit"" he recently <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/news/conor-oberst-switches-it-up-on-bright-eyes-1005022362.story#/news/conor-oberst-switches-it-up-on-bright-eyes-1005022362.story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Billboard</a> he was burnt out on. <span> </span>In its place, the three have settled into a middle space somewhere between the distorted crunch of Oberst's short-lived Desaparecidos project and 2005's electro-pop experiment <i>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</i>. On the hard-charging ""Jejune Stars"", new wave synths piggyback power chords, while ""Triple Spiral"" spikes meatier guitar work with organ and a number of space-bound key flourishes. Walcott's contributions in particular--  like on the hiccupping ""Haile Selassie""-- digitize a lot of the pop elements that distinguish Bright Eyes from Oberst's work elsewhere. It's as well-assembled and produced a set of songs as you'd expect from pros like these guys, but unfortunately, much of it tends to ring empty. What's missing is Oberst.</p>
<p>As ""Jejune Stars"" comes to a close you'll find a short interstitial recording of Denny Brewer, a Texas musician whose husky, some-might-say-batshit musings on other dimensions and extra-terrestrial, ancient reptilian life forms also comprise most of the album's found sound interstitials and intro, a Bright Eyes tradition. In talking about the etymology of the word ""pomegranate,"" he renacts the moment the fruit got its name: ""I don't know why it's called a pomegranate, but it looks like a pomegranate. No matter what language you spoke it in, syllables are frequencies."" Though his brayed delivery tends to be a tipping point for many, Oberst's lyrical acumen has always been his work's great strength. Whether it was four chords for a love song or three to size up of everything that's wrong with Right Now, he's been able to rule a recording from the start. Omaha, East Village, the simpler the better: Oberst could connect in his own way. But here, he's occupying a frequency all by himself, arranging words that do wonders harmonically, yet mean next to nothing side-by-side. Through and through, this record's overarching themes of ""oneness"" and connectivity feel painfully blurred by the fragmented, illusory nature with which Oberst shares them. It's as though he's fallen down any and every rabbit hole he could-- <span>Rastafarian imagery makes room for shamanic allusions, futurist tail-chasing, half-baked philosophizing, aimless retrospection, Bono-like</span> levels of evangelizing (see closer ""One for You, One for Me""), dead end time travel and one very short, psychedelic walk into a place named the ""Land of Tomorrow"".</p>
<p>That very last bit comes from opener ""Firewall"", a song whose sharp-toothed guitar figure and holy shit build can't help but feel hollow once Oberst disconnects as early as he does. When his voice is distorted into barely intelligible warbles during the strummy quiver of ""Beginner's Mind"" it seems fitting, just as it sounds perfectly believable when, on ""A Machine Spiritual (In the People's Key)"", he says he'll ""float into the ether."" None of these songs are quite as overwrought as those found on <i>Cassadaga</i>, a record with enough instrumental soul there at times to carry the load anytime he went rogue. But with the plain exception of ""Ladder Song,"" the slick sonics here make the rest of the pack all the more cavernous and impersonal, a long ways from where the whole story began. Every line is laid with the rich sense of rhythm and texture that he's mastered over the years, but it still adds up to very little: a wildly spiritual record without any spirit.</p></div>"|15111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15111-the-peoples-key/|5.0|David Bevan

Her voice and melodic bass lines lend a sense of fragility to that band, so it's no surprise to hear that carried over into her side project, La Sera. Here, Vivian Girls' distorted guitar and haze is replaced by a bare sound, stripped to its core elements, while Goodman's voice becomes central, sometimes double-tracked.</p>
<p>The opening jangle of ""Beating Heart"" builds with purpose, slow and precise as Goodman sings above clean guitar chimes. Honeyed vocal harmonies stream in, collecting these simple elements, giving the song an ebb and flow that recalls stately, more minimal guitar bands such as Galaxie 500. When a distorted guitar cuts in toward the end, it feels all the more powerful for the restraint surrounding it.</p>
<p>It's this kind of heft that carries the first-- and best-- quarter of the album, where Goodman uses simplicity as an airy foundation for her lovelorn twee-pop songs. It's a trick showcased well on ""You're Going to Cry"", with its weary lyric pitted against off-the-cuff acoustic guitar strums and sparse drumming. Something in her enunciation on the song, not allowing any syllable to fade away, sounds quite innocent and childlike, making for an interesting contrast with the seen-it-all-before theme of the verses.</p>
<p>There's a subtle 1960s girl-group influence throughout, but there are also hints of the folk-pop of that era on ""I Promise You"", as a sweet organ line props up the end of the song, sounding almost like a flute. These interesting moments, living in the space in the music, allow it to feel blithe and easy.</p>
<p>The carefreeness that lends La Sera's better songs a sense of spontaneity shows up some of its weaker moments. ""Left This World"" feels thin and more like a foundation or fleeting idea than something fully formed. That song is typical of the latter half of the record and, despite being made up of very short songs, still feels like a slog. ""Lift Off"", at one minute long doesn't stick around long enough to command much attention, except to note the odd-sounding chorus harmony. This sort of brevity and emptiness makes the tail end of the album, already short at 26 minutes, feel throwaway and hasty. It's hard not to feel, therefore, that this would have made a much better EP, losing some of the shapeless songs that drag down the momentum and charm of the record.</p></div>"|15108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15108-la-sera/|7.0|Hari Ashurst

With Anti-Pop Consortium and across a series of solo records, Beans has honed a signature futurist style typified by intricate fast-talking raps and steely, minimal beats. And while he often raps about the same subject matters as the multi-platinum artists-- his exquisite and expensive taste in apparel, his prowess both on the mic and between the sheets-- he does so in ways that are consistently disorienting and inventive. If Anti-Pop's mission was a deconstruction of hip-hop, Beans has been an ever faithful zealot.</p>
<p>A flipside of autership can too often be hermeticism, but although Beans' solo albums have been largely self-produced, he has never shied away from collaborations. His 2006 album <i>Only</i> saw him recording with a pair of jazz instrumentalists, and he's previously worked with producers ranging from Alec Empire to DJ Shadow. His latest album, and first on boundary testing label anticon., <i>End It All</i>, enlists producers as omnivorous as Four Tet and Tobacco and as disparate as disco pushers In Flagranti and Interpol drummer Sam Fogarino. What's remarkable about <i>End It All</i>, though, isn't its variety but its laser focus-- Beans seems to bend all his collaborators to his singular vision: heavy percussion, deep bass, the sparest of melodic elements, and echoing, nerve-rattling synthesizer effects. It's an ominous sound, and it suits his rapid-fire, anxious-making raps well.</p>
<p>The album opens with its glossiest track, the Ade Firth-produced ""Superstar Destroyer"", on which Beans offers tongue-twisted boasts over synth flutter and gauzy, upward-wavering chords. ""Deathsweater"" is a funk track whose choruses are as dedicated to clotheshorse collar-popping as its verses are to racing down tangential rabbit holes. On ""Gluetraps"", Four Tet recycles the sort of soft electric piano tones and off-kilter synth chirps heard on his last album, while on ""Anvil Falling"" he lays an unexpectedly harsh, squelching lead over headlong rhythm; both are brief interludes on which Beans relentlessly hammers away at single free-associative verses. Tobacco gets typically skuzzy and analogue on ""Glass Coffins"", burying a loping bassline and 8-bit arpeggios under a wash of buzzsaw noise. In Flagranti allow a little of their dark Italo vibe to bubble up in the form of a motorik bassline underneath the sharp snare and lone noisy sample of ""Air Is Free"", while Beans orates in a displaced Run-D.M.C. style-- the combination is, as he says, ""retro in the sense that it's good,"" but still decidedly modern.</p>
<p>""Mellow You Out"" is by far the most distinctive track here, largely due to the album's only guest vocalist, Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio, whose unmistakable wail and falsetto lend the song a touch of human soulfulness otherwise absent in Beans' icy cold aggression. Another odd moment occurs on ""Hardliner"", when the no-holds-barred MC engages in a bit of self-censorship, bleeping an obvious Cadence Weapon dis amidst telltale mentions of Busy P, TTC, and a shared bill at the Knitting Factory.</p>
<p>If Beans' consistency is what holds this album's diverse line-up together, it can also be his occasional pitfall as an MC, as his own cadence can sometimes lock into a predictable sing-song rise and fall, every other syllable a hard accent, to the point that the yo-yoing begins to detract from the dazzling flow. Ultimately, though, <i>End It All</i>, is another well-earned notch in Beans' solo belt and a testament to the strength of his artistic vision-- anyone who can get a convincing hip-hop beat out of Interpol surely deserves some kind of ambassadorship.</p></div>"|15112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15112-end-it-all/|7.3|Eric Grandy

Instead, he got <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14809-the-appeal-georgias-most-wanted/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted</i></a>, a solid but oddly muted affair Pitchfork’s David Drake rightly labeled a “missed opportunity.” The trouble with <i>The Appeal</i> wasn't Gucci, who delivered more of the head-down lyrical prowess that carried his superior 2010 mixtapes <i>Mr. Zone 6</i> and <i>Jewelry Selection</i>. The problem was the beats, alternately lifeless and ill-fitting.</p>
<p>So Gucci's <i>Appeal</i> material has plenty to gain from recontextualization; the further you can get a deliriously great twofer like ""standing on the sofa spilling liquor on the speaker/ Call the paralegal 'cuz this shit should be illegal"" away from the awkwardly undulating Justice sample in ""Gucci Time"", the better. Enter UK producer Sinden, who-- following Diplo's lead from last year-- has compiled a mix of reconfigured Gucci tunes representing the many frayed ends of England's loose-knit beat music scene: grime, dubstep, purple, post-whatever. Diplo and company mostly worked with tracks from Gucci's <i>Burrprint 3D</i> tape-- perhaps the single best encapsulation of Gucci's dual strengths as a technically dazzling MC and total weirdo-- and the results were almost uniformly disappointing, a lot of gurgling glo-fi and off-kilter electroid shuffle that neither bettered their origin tracks or did much to flatter Gucci's tricky rhymes. Sinden's careful not to replicate the Diplo tape's missteps on <i>Free Gucci II: The Burrrtish Edition</i>, opting to take on the more easily salvageable <i>Appeal</i> material and at its best the set does play like an unfiltered mix of the circa-2011 London sound’s many rivers and tributaries.</p>
<p>From ""Wonderful"" to ""Lemonade"", Gucci's best stuff finds the MC and the track practically sewn together, his lively slur weaving itself around the sneaky syncopations in the music. It's not that a good Gucci remix is some kind of impossibility-- Flying Lotus and a few others proved that on the last tape-- but to really succeed it'd have to preserve both Gucci's word-drunk, expectation-tweaking cadences and the grim cacophony to which Gucci is accustomed. With its tottering brainwipe bass hits and stilted-staccato rhythms, the haunting stutter of current UK dance music would seem a good fit for Gucci. Indeed, everyone, even the project's least likely contributors-- math-rock whizzes These New Puritans-- locate some midpoint between the grim and the gigantic. Some opt to switch out the beat entirely, while many attack it head on, complicating the rhythms, transmuting the bass from a throb to a wobble.</p>
<p>The trouble, though, is what to do with Gucci, a question for which <i>Free Gucci II</i> has nearly as many answers as it does contributors. A few shove Gucci to the front of their new mixes; others, like Rude Kid, eliminate him entirely. Only Toddla T, who sneaks a bit of Auto-Tune into ""Trap Talk"", sees fit to treat Gucci's vocals much; perhaps out of reverence, most just let Gucci be Gucci, allowing him to rattle around in the sound-worlds they've created. But whether they're delving directly into those <i>Appeal</i> tracks or affixing a Gucci <i>a cappella</i> to their own productions, hardly one of them betters the material from which it came, often letting the tracks run roughshod over the MC. It's not bad bass music; it's just not always very good Gucci Mane music.</p>
<p>Keep Toddla T's half-slinky, half-sinister ""Trap Talk"", and DJ Swerve's skittering, miles-deep ""Weirdo"", with its appropriately whacked showing from MC Ghetts. And hold onto Sinden's ""Gucci Time"", which switches out Swizz's swarming Justice lick for a downward-moving thunk that's far lusher, if no less oppressive. The snarling synths and steadier rhythm of Duke Dumont's ""Dollar Sign"" prove the closest approximation of the classic Gucci sound here, and while it's no better than the original, it's certainly no worse. Hudson Mohawke sticks a piano under ""Party Animal"" halfway between classic house and barrelhouse, lending the track a funhouse delirium well suited for the track's invocations to debauch.</p>
<p>Do what you will with Funkineven's intriguing but inessential electro update of ""It's Alive"", Mele's suitably chaotic ""Missing"", and the Blessings' ""It's Alive"", which barely touches its source material. These New Puritans' ""Dollar Sign"" feels unusually spacious and ethereal after 2010's beautifully claustrophobic <i>Hidden</i>; their clattering percussion underscores Gucci's verses nicely, although I can't help but think they would've gone grander for Flocka. But don't even bother with Rude Kid's Gucci-free ""Grown Man"", or the Mista Men take on ""Haterade"", both of which downplay some solid Gucci verses and, in the case of ""Haterade"", draw the wretched Pharrell hook well past the point of interminable when  it clearly should've been the first thing to go. Equally baffling is  the total absence of Gucci’s gregariously awful British accent from  2009's <i>Great Brrritain</i>, a seeming no-brainer that would’ve lent this  scattered-by-design affair a bit of much-needed cohesion and levity. Scratcha DVA's sorta trancey ""What It's Gonna Be"" and Rustie's off-kilter ""Brand New"" feel stilted and not quite finished, like they ran up on deadline and shot over whatever they had.</p>
<p>And if they did? Hearing either didn't cost you anything. But the strictly volunteer basis <i>Free Gucci II </i>operates on isn't all that different than the way Gucci tends to work, offering up scads of free music because he understands the 21st century's most valuable currency is exposure. Gucci's mixtapes highlight not just Gucci, but the rappers and producers he favors, a sort of mutual appreciation society that's paid dividends for nearly all parties involved: Flocka, Zaytoven, Drumma Boy. <i>Free Gucci II</i> seems unlikely to turn Gucci fans onto the future sound of London, nor will dubstep kids see too much in Gucci here, given how few of the productions here strike a successful balance between the two. But, much like Diplo's set, the tape's biggest flaw lies in how many of these songs outshine, cover up, or completely rub out the whole reason this thing exists in the first place: it's Gucci.</p></div>"|15104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15104-free-gucci-ii-the-burrrtish-edition/|5.8|Paul Thompson

And not just the ones we use to fit in. The things we affect to stand out, too. So as frontman for legendary proto-punks the Modern Lovers, sure, Richman took the nihilistic clang of the Velvet Underground. But he applied it to songs about sobriety (""I'm Straight""), hometown Americana (""Roadrunner""), and old-fashioned courtship (""Girl Friend""). As a cult-beloved solo artist, he has praised his heroes for the same simple reasons a child-- or a wise old man-- might: a crazy sound (""Velvet Underground""), all those pretty colors (""Vincent Van Gogh""), nice dreams (""Salvador Dali""). His live performances, at once puritanically austere and shamelessly entertaining, suggest an especially gifted street musician.</p>
<p>Released last November without much fanfare, the 59-year-old New England native's latest extends an increasingly remarkable series of low-key, mostly acoustic albums for Neil Young's Vapor imprint over the decade-plus since Richman's closest brush with fame (as the twee singer guy in 1998 Farrelly Brothers slapstick <i>There's Something About Mary</i>). This fruitful phase has brought a mature gravity that translates, improbably, as lightness-- Richman takes his fun pretty seriously. On 2004's <i>Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love</i>, a late-career highlight, he reminded us not to spoil the good things in life by talking them to death. On 2008's sporadically sublime <i>Because Her Beauty Is Raw and Wild</i>, he showed how to experience the bad things in life to their fullest, too. Though a little less thematically unified, <i>O Moon, Queen of Night on Earth</i> continues Richman's doomed but noble attempt to dig beneath the surfaces of modern existence, flaunting its relatively few imperfections-- mic sounds, a rushed phrase or two-- as signs of life.</p>
<p>Like its recent predecessors, Richman's new album is a pretty faithful representation of his live show. With little distracting studio gloss, it captures Richman's warbling, Boston-accented croon; his nylon-string, flamenco-tinged acoustic guitar; and longtime drummer Tommy Larkins' stripped-down kit, which he plays with jazzy panache. There are backing vocals from a handful of guests, including wife Nicole Montalbano and singer/songwriter Ólöf Arnalds (of Icelandic band Múm), but these all blend comfortably enough to add to the album's feeling of shared intimacy, rather than subtract from it. Foreign-language lyrics, a staple of Richman's Vapor records, crop up now and then, but the songs are evocative enough to work as interludes if, say, your knowledge of French is limited to ""Lady Marmalade""-- and anyway on the reprise of ""Sa Voix M'Atisse"" JoJo helps you with the words. There's even one of those half-spoken Massachusetts geography songs Richman does from time to time, ""Winter Afternoon by B.U. in Boston"", though this one's percussive repetitions pale beside the wonderfully vivid ""Twilight in Boston"", from 1992's essential <i>I, Jonathan</i>.</p>
<p>Billed as a ""wee small hours"" record, <i>O Moon</i> isn't so much melancholy as it is soaked in a sort of implacable longing. There's the quasi-title track's plaintive appeal against light pollution. Or the two takes of ""The Sea Was Calling Me Home"", a mournful song that sees in the human fear of conformity little more than our standard fear of death. These songs aren't sad, exactly; they're ambivalent, as any honest look at the world probably ought to be. Even the love songs give both sides of the coin: ""I Was the One She Came For"" is so sweet and pure that you may find yourself wanting to believe the title isn't meant as a pun (in which case it's hilarious); ""It Was Time for Me to Be With Her"" depicts an otherworldly encounter, like the Modern Lovers' ""Astral Plane"" with another three or four decades' worth of perspective.</p>
<p>There are breezy moments, too: ""These Bodies That Came to Cavort"", an uptempo comment on the absurdity of making our bodies sit down all day, or ignoring them when they tell us to drink less wine; ""If You Want to Leave Our Party Just Go"", a simple rock'n'roll clap-along that promises, ""There's no need to be polite and just stay just for appearances""; and most of all ""My Affected Accent"", a self-effacing romp that isn't far removed from 2008 non-album single ""You Can Have a Cell Phone That's OK But Not Me"" and contains an immortal lyric, ""I should have been bullied more than I was."" In apologizing for his 40-years-ago affectations, Richman raises the question whether he-- or any of us-- can truly avoid other affectations, other things ""just for appearances,"" now or ever. We probably can't; as the philosophers say, it's turtles all the way down. Then again, Richman's career is a testament to the beauty of a lost but noble cause. In one of <i>O Moon</i>'s last lines, he asks, ""What's life without the search for the darkened, the shadowed, the obscure?"" If anyone can find it, it's this guy. It's still a thrill listening to him look.</p></div>"|15105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15105-o-moon-queen-of-night-on-earth/|7.8|Marc Hogan

It is split into two sections-- well, suites-- divided by key. There's a limited edition that comes complete with an extra half hour of music and a graphic novel. There's that cover. Considering, if I told you <i>Tao of the Dead</i> was the band's most stripped-back, least bombastic affair in ages, would you believe me?</p>
<p>Trail of Dead pared down to a four-piece for the 10-day <i>Tao</i> sessions, re-shifting their focus back to guitar and peeling away plenty of the ostentatious orchestral-psych flourishes that’ve bogged them down in the recent past. Save the quarter-hour you'll spend with its five-part closer, <i>Tao of the Dead</i> seems to chop its recent predecessors' average per-song runtime roughly in half. <i>Worlds Apart</i> and especially <i>So Divided</i>-- the nadir of the Trail of Dead catalog-- dragged on with excessive runtimes and twice-too-many choruses and elaborate instrumental scaffolding that, tarp removed, revealed a house of cards.</p>
<p>Rather than blowing out the back end of every song with such a movement, <i>Tao of the Dead</i> maps its grand ambitions over its full length; songs slip by quickly but not without notice, and certain motifs reappear throughout, lending the disc a somewhat hallucinogenic disorientation. Mostly, though, they move; the clipped construction helps, as does the <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>-style seamlessness between cuts. But the songs themselves-- out front with the melodies, easy on the extraneous racket, alternately lovely and bruising-- are among the most delicate and memorable the band have unleashed. And, smartly, in shifting the focus back to the tunes themselves, they've pushed the grand payoff to the end, once they've really earned it.</p>
<p>Opener ""Let's Experiment"" gives way to ""Pure Radio Cosplay"", a sweaty rocker with an almost Stonesy underpinning that laments the death of rock radio, a clever inversion considering it's the band's most radio-ready track in years. Conrad Keely's rough-hewn, gun-to-the-head howl is, like almost everything, pitched down somewhat here on <i>Tao</i>, evincing notes of near-prettiness at times, but he spits out ""Cosplay"" like he really can't believe something like Nickelback exists while he languishes in semi-obscurity. Yet the sour, why-not-us vibe of <i>World's Apart</i> couldn't be farther from the fantastical worlds Keely touches on here; his lyrics, as they often do, seem dwarfed by the music, but the few he dangles out in front seem to emerge from Keely's full immersion in <i>Tao</i>'s mythos. He didn't just namedrop Yes' <i>Relayer</i> and Rush's <i>Hemispheres</i> in pre-interviews because there's little or no pause between songs; each conjures a fully-formed universe between your ears, a quality <i>Tao</i> not only aspires to but frequently achieves.</p>
<p>As ""Cosplay"" winds down, Keely jumps in with ""Wanna do another?,"" and off they go to ""Summer of All Dead Souls"", elegantly oscillating between space battle to acoustic plea without overselling either. ""Cover the Days Like a Tidal Wave"" lays a spoken-word missive over some undulating chords. Despite its title, ""The Wasteland"" is a lovely, sinewy psych-grunge number, gliding nimbly from mellotron to megawatts. And ""Spiral Jetty"" feels like a the start of something overcooked that, in the past, Keely and company might’ve drawn out. Here it doesn't hit the two-minute mark, closing out with a bit of dazzling feedback, then easing into the sumptuous ""Weight of the Sun (Or the Post-Modern Prometheus)"". These aren't epics in miniature, exactly; they move through sections and shift tone gracefully, but individual tracks rarely overstay their welcome, instrumental passages rarely getting more than a few seconds to themselves. When the reprise of ""Cosplay"" swings around again two-thirds of the way through the record, it's a surprise every time: shouldn't that've felt longer?</p>
<p><i>Tao</i>, smartly, farms out most of its monolithic hugeness to the record's last two-- well, six-- tracks. But not before ""Ebb Away"", the loveliest track Trail of Dead have made since ""Crowning of a Heart"" from <i>The Secret of Elena's Tomb</i> EP nearly a decade ago. A little guitar tumble, remarkable in its understatement, gives way to a crunchy alt-rock chorus that sees Keely letting go of attachment and doing as its title suggests. It'd make for a helluva closer, but <i>Tao of the Dead</i> isn't about to let anybody off that easy. Onward and upward they go into <i>kosmische</i> whirl ""The Fairlight Pendant"", guitars encircling like three Can records playing at once. It gets to be a little much after a few times through, but I suppose it wouldn't be a Trail of Dead record without some overblown throwback jam, a slack ""Pendant"" happily picks up. But there's still the little matter of ""Strange News From Another Planet"", the five-part, key-of-F, half-a-""Family Guy"" closing suite. ""Strange News"" is a bit like the last three Trail of Dead records in microcosm, lots of movement, with a tendency to drift. The track goes from a lurching alt-rock swirl to sampling a documentary about teenage homelessness in Seattle to a <i>Source Tags</i>-style hardcore pummel and back around again. Some will find the grandiose ""Strange News"" the most thrilling bit of <i>Tao</i>; others may take it as a separate piece entirely, saving it for later or skipping it outright.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span>So much of Trail of Dead's post-<i>Source Tags &amp; Codes</i> output has felt desperate to recapture that now-classic set’s bluster and heart, only to favor one over the other to the detriment of both. That album’s teetering-on-the-brim mix of beauty and furor seems now like lightning in a bottle, the sort of thing you’d spend your life trying (and failing) to replicate. <i>Tao of the Dead</i><span> does feel, in its songs and structure alike, like the first post-</span><i>Source Tags</i><span> record not cooled in the giant shadow of their decade-old triumph; more patient, more potent, more dynamic, less overloaded, the band deftly charting out their ""Flight of the Navigator"" death trip, the skewed alt-prog fantasia between their ears come hurtling to life. Set your controls for the heart of your bong.</span></p></div>"|15101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15101-tao-of-the-dead/|7.2|Paul Thompson

<p>As a DJ, Diplo's greatest asset has always been his versatility, his willingness to pull from any and all possible sources in order to keep a party moving. <i>Never Scared</i>, the landmark 2003 mix from Diplo and Low Budget's Hollertronix project, introduced many of us to Diplo's flailing style by finding room for the Bangles and Baltimore club and the Clash and random-ass Southern rap micro-hits; it felt like they were chewing up the whole of popular music and puking it back out in danceable form. In recent years, that DJ style has hardened into something of a shtick as lesser DJs have taken it and run. But Diplo, at his best, still has a rare sense of rule-blurring vision; he managed, for instance, to get an entire festival crowd dumbing out to Ace of Base's ""All That She Wants"" during Major Lazer's set at last year's Pitchfork Music Festival. The whole Major Lazer project is a testament to how much Diplo and partner Switch love Jamaican music in all its stylistic variety, so you'd think that, given Greensleeves' massive back catalog to play with, Diplo would take the opportunity to just go nuts. Not the case.</p>
<p><i>Riddimentary: Diplo Selects Greensleeves</i>, his DJ mix of music from the label's past, turns out to be a love letter to a very specific period in the genre's evolution: The early-80s moment when deep one-drop roots reggae was just starting to transform into dancehall. It was a time when all these older stars started to integrate digital drum-triggers and echoey synthesizer lines into their tracks, and when the Barrington Levy/Yellowman style of nonsensical stutter-scatting was blowing up. <i>Riddimentary</i> isn't a wide-ranging dance party; it's a mix that maintains a single mood and a single tempo throughout. You could dance to it, if you wanted, but you could also wash dishes or read a book or drive down a highway in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>In focusing on this one instant in the label's history, Diplo shows a sharp understanding of the genre. There's only one track that appears on both the Greensleeves greatest-hits record and <i>Riddimentary</i>: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbU5eIEUQy4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Telephone Love""</a>, a 1988 crossover hit from Londoner J.C. Lodge, by far the most modern-sounding track on Diplo's mix. <i>Riddimentary</i> does have a few big, immortal anthems-- Gregory Isaacs' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6oYyG0KcvQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Night Nurse""</a>, for instance-- but it's just as likely to chase the genre down the bizarre rabbit holes it was digging at the time. So we get some dubby, digitized instrumental experiments from lifers like Joe Gibbs and Prince Far I. We also get a few tracks very specific to their moment, like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGCbgpIf3E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Police in Helicopter""</a>, John Holt's threat to burn down sugarcane fields if police keep cracking down on marijuana farmers, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XezMeRdZIZI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Eventide Fire a Disaster""</a>, Barrington Levy and General Echo's mournful elegy about a 1980 blaze in a Kingston old folks' home.</p>
<p><i>Riddimentary</i> isn't a defining work of genre exhumation or anything; if you love reggae, you might have a decent chunk of this mix in your iTunes, and the more obscure material probably won't change your life. But it does work as a warm, sustained mood-piece and a serious demonstration that Diplo knows what he's talking about when it comes to this reggae thing. If you happened to hear it in the background, very little about the mix would signal that Diplo was the guy behind it; he barely even digs into his endless supply of airhorn effects and DJ drops. He just plays the background and lets the music do the talking. In this case, that's exactly what he needed to do.</p></div>"|15086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15086-riddimentary-diplo-selects-greensleeves/|7.5|Tom Breihan

Gunplay"" on <i>Deeper Than Rap</i>. On that album, otherwise a strictly A-list banquet of superstar entitlement, Gunplay was the only no-name, and he tore into the opportunity, spitting a ferocious, rubbery-lipped verse. Of all the album's marquee-star guests-- Nas, Wayne, Kanye, Ne-Yo-- Gunplay took the best temperature of the environment, delivering exuberant ridiculousness on par with his boss.</p>
<p>In case we were tempted to dismiss this appearance as a fluke or one-off, Gunplay has returned with this mixtape, which should clarify matters. It is named <i>Inglorious Bastard (The Prelude to Valkyrie)</i>, which in another era could have been a Queensrÿche album title. It has the above cover art, which sort of speaks for itself. The production consists entirely of post-Lex Luger monster-crunk beats. Waka Flocka Flame is prominently featured on the first full song. There is a song called ""4 Loko"" in which Gunplay raps over the beat to ""Hard in Da  Paint"". In pretty much every way possible, in other words, <i>Inglorious Bastard</i> is a straight flush of transcendent dumbassery.</p>
<p>Part of the loony joy of <i>Inglorious Bastard</i> comes from how ably Gunplay springs off of his boss: He plays wild-eyed foil to Ricky's fur-draped crime kingpin, but since Ross is not exactly rap's most sober, grounded figure to begin with, things get giddy pretty quickly. Ross is all over the tape, too, running his bellowing ""B.M.F."" cadence down into the tire treads, and while Ross is always welcome, Gunplay doesn't need him: he's endlessly entertaining all on his own. On a freestyle over Drake's ""Miss Me"", he claims he's ""ugly in real life, handsome on a flat screen"" and later says he's ""Skypin' with ya wifey/ Thank god for electronics."" On ""Bust Your Heart"", he screams, ""No Arm and Hammer in my Hannah Montana/ These kicks ain't alligator skin, I think they salamander!"" On ""Pump That Fee Up"", he calls someone ""more pussy than a cat paw.""</p>
<p>The sneaky cleverness of some of these lines point to Gunplay's dirty, shameful secret: He's actually a pretty great rapper. It's not immediately detectable beneath his goofy bluster,  but in the buried internal rhymes and piled-up assonances of lines like ""My niggas rock rags like a Saudi/ My Maserati looping round the emblems on ya Audi/ Only nigga out in Berlin blowin' Cali Maui/ Only nigga out in Par-ee spittin' out my calamaris"" (from ""Another One"", a steam-rolling collaboration with Rick Ross and Diddy) you can hear the crumpled sheets of draft paper that went into them, as well as a genuine love of words.</p>
<p>This sense of craftsmanship is part of why <i>Inglorious Bastard</i> remains replayable after dozens of listens, but it also means things never catch fire in the same way <i>Flockaveli</i> did. At every moment, Gunplay remains firmly in control of his own unhinged joyride, whereas it wasn't entirely clear if <i>Flockaveli</i> came equipped with brakes. Gunplay doesn't quite fit in with this new school of goon rappers, in that way-- his blend of dead-serious technical chops and exaggerated class-clown posing harks back to Redman, an older model, and rap fans who couldn't stomach the artlessness of Waka Flocka's lyrics might find a more companionable listen in <i>Bastard</i>. However you take it, though, <i>Inglorious</i> remains some of the most colorful and invigorating rap of 2011. If you have a treadmill run in your future, or a car you need to destroy with your bare hands, it should make a suitable accompaniment to either activity.</p></div>"|15097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15097-inglorious-bastard-prelude-to-valkyrie/|7.8|Jayson Greene

Founded by Gary Walker in 1962 and purchased by local businessman Slim Williamson in 1964, it was the temporary home of established acts like Junior Samples and Red Sovine, but the emphasis was squarely on young talent with crossover potential, including its biggest success story, Lynn Anderson. Most of its roster might not ring a bell these days, mush less a cash register, but Chart was certainly a label of its moment, when country was entertaining the notion of pop.</p>
<p>One Chart artist, a Miss Nashville runner-up named Connie Eaton, married Williamson's son, and they had a daughter named Cortney (now Tidwell), who grew up to become a country singer herself. Nearly half a century after Chart's founding, she is paying tribute to the family business with an album of primarily Chart covers, most of them duets with Lambchop frontman Kurt Wagner. Both represent the seedy Nashville underbelly of local artists actually paying heed to local history, and fittingly, the idea for this collaboration originated on stage at the Basement, where the two sang an impromptu Don Williams cover together.</p>
<p>Like the best Nashville duos, their voices are very different yet suit each other well. Wagner's is an eccentric take on a cowboy croon, which makes the weird psych-folk-country anthem ""Penetration"" more than simply a novelty, while Tidwell's is a robust, breathy version of a traditional starlet, which can sell the delicate quaver of ""A Special Day"" as well as the epic hurt of weeper ""Who's Gonna Love Me Now"". Both communicate with equal ease the regret and invariable heartache of these tunes, especially when they're trading verses. They  have chemistry, which illuminates the rollicking ""Pickin' Wild Mountain Berries"" even as it makes solo numbers like ""April's Fool"" (him) and ""Yours Forever"" (her) a bit wan by comparison.</p>
<p>The material is perhaps the most surprising aspect of <i>Invariable Heartache</i>. There's a startling wit to these songs, not only in the unexpected title phrase sung in the first line of ""Incredibly Lonely"" but also in the coy wink of ""I Can't Sleep With You"", which goes, ""I can't sleep with you... I can't sleep with you... on my mind."" It's not hard to imagine any of these songs becoming hits in the 1960s, nestling alongside Tammy Wynette's ""Stand By Your Man"" or Eddy Arnold's ""Make the World Go Away"". Recruiting a skeleton crew from Lambchop as their backing band, Tidwell and Wagner don't try to re-create the classic sound of Chart Records, with all their strings and bells and whistles, nor do they try to update the songs to today's particular pop-country sound. Instead, <i>Invariable Heartache</i> sounds more like one of Lambchop's more countrified records, which is to say the music is both lush and minimal, the sound of so many musicians giving themselves over completely to the song. It's a gateway album to Chart's back catalog, as well as to an adventurous era in Nashville history.</p></div>"|15102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15102-invariable-heartache/|7.6|Stephen M.

With her languid drawl suggesting an interior monologue rather than an actual conversation-- as if she's thinking things out in her head-- she comes across as a woman torn between her heart and her brain. On her 2008 debut, <i>With Blasphemy So Heartfelt</i>, she picked apart her relationships like a scholar deconstructs a text, parsing out the finer regrets and conflicts right up to the point of severing the emotional connection between herself and the ""you"" she's addressing. Mayfield sets her songs at that precipice of a break-up-- a tactic  that lends her music the emotional force of the best country music and distinguishes her from other songwriters.</p>
<p><i>Tell Me</i>, her second album, matches and at times even surpasses her debut in terms of rueful atmosphere and unflinching songwriting, and Mayfield works to break free of her country confines and showcase her vocals in new, unexpected settings. <i>Blasphemy</i> set a mood and sustained it; by comparison, the follow-up is positively kaleidoscopic, both musically and emotionally. She writes pop hooks, mingles pedal steel with ramshackle studio beats, and incorporates new styles and influences, such that each song has its own unique identity. If <i>Tell Me</i> lacks the rawness of her youthful debut (she wasn't even old enough to vote when she recorded <i>Blasphemy</i>), it sounds more adventurous and more playful, taking greater risks that almost always pay off. The beat on ""Grown Man"", which sounds like a factory pre-set on an old Casio re-appropriated as some sort of analog electronica, should sound flippant and gimmicky, yet it lends a wryness to her lyrics about a May-December romance: ""I'd give most anything to know, as you're sitting there with your legs crossed and no clothes on, what you are thinking of."" She is, the song makes clear, the more mature one.</p>
<p>Sex remains a constant throughout these songs, yet because it offers a respite from romantic bewilderment, Mayfield's songwriting never becomes tawdry. ""Hate has brought me up the stairs into your house,"" she sings on ""Our Hearts Are Wrong"". ""I'll not let hate be the one to make me naked for you."" There's a lot going on in these tough-minded tracks, and the music is calibrated to reinforce her heady sentiments. Forgoing the cavernous sound of <i>Blasphemy</i>, producer Dan Auerbach gives <i>Tell Me</i> a snappy immediacy that unites these disparate styles and musical experiments into a cohesive whole. His and Richie Kirkpatrick's guitars crash almost brutally against her delicate vocals on ""I'll Be the One You Want Someday"" and ""Somewhere in Your Heart"", but in a way that enacts her emotional turmoil.</p>
<p>The album peaks early with ""Blue Skies Again"", whose ooh-sha-la-la's (sung by Auerbach) and simple, infectious chorus make it a standout. It's Mayfield's most pop-oriented moment, mixing country, girl group, shoegazer, and indie pop into a breezy sound, but it's also a sunny, reassuring song that draws even more power from being the bright spot among so many dire situations. And that reveals the central and enthralling contradiction on <i>Tell Me</i>: Mayfield's uncertainties have inspired a proportionately confident album, as musically assured as it is romantically conflicted.</p></div>"|15090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15090-tell-me/|7.7|Stephen M.

His best tracks are the sonic equivalent of page-turners, constantly making room for new sounds, melodies, and rhythmic half-thoughts, constantly in motion without ever sounding like they made a radical departure. When they work, it's in subtle ways: All their parts sound like they belong even when their entrances feel unexpected. Müller tends to stick to house music's basic pattern of one bass-drum thunk every beat and one snare every other, which is another reason it never seems like he's up to anything overtly unusual: There's always a simple rhythm to tie you down if the other ones-- the sneaky, evaporating ones-- don't. In between the beats are sweet, detuned melodies, computer wheezes, and flashes of dissonance. That his experiments don't always work makes me like him more-- it seems like he'd rather hear a track fall short than bend to the rules.</p>
<p>Müller's last full-length as Isolée, 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4164-we-are-monster/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Are Monster</i></a>, sounded like a cluttered dollhouse, micro in scale but overflowing with ornaments. It's still an amazing album for listeners who'd prefer a parade of tiny surprises to a few skullcrushing ones, and probably my favorite piece of legitimate dance music to crossover to an indie audience in the past several years. Since then, he's released a few singles and EPs, and an early works collection called <i>Western Store</i>-- basically, a total of maybe nine or 10 new tracks over the past six years.</p>
<p>For people who've followed him-- through the ""Albacares"" single, ""October""/""Nightingale"", and ""The Fantastic Researches of Yushin Maru""-- the feel of <i>Well Spent Youth</i> will be familiar. It's less cheerful than <i>We Are Monster</i>, still soft but more dissonant and evasive, and significantly more invested in that recurring fascination of contemporary techno, the squelchy noise.</p>
<p>Its most unusual tracks--""Going Nowhere"" and ""Transmission""-- are so littered with sound that they feel almost random, and while Müller manages to tie them together for a few seconds at a time, the coherence is mostly exciting because of these wild, slippery moments on either end where the music appears to come in and out of focus. He reprises melodic and rhythmic ideas, but to my ears the tracks themselves are never cyclical-- it's flux-music, and music that sounds better when you're willing to be patient with it than when you're not.</p>
<p>In other places, he lapses into moody, low-key house, and in a couple of instances-- ""Thirteen Times an Hour"" and ""Taktell""-- revisits the bright slow-plays that marked <i>We Are Monster</i>. While this record doesn't feel as spirited as his last full-length, I think it's also a different album with different aims. I'd imagine Isolée fans who thought the pretty, toy-like tracks on <i>We Are Monster</i> bordered on twee will prefer the open-ended and more mysterious sound of <i>Well Spent Youth.</i></p>
<p>The album is the first full-length on Pampa Records, a new label run by the prankish and wonderful DJ Koze (about whom I have a lot of nice things to say, almost all of which can be summed up in a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmOntX0cWoY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""commercial"" he recently made for the music tech company Native Instruments</a>). The label that put out <i>We Are Monster</i>, Playhouse, is still around but has receded into a happy routine. At this point, Müller's music isn't really part of a conversation about the future of dance music. ""Microhouse""-- what <i>We Are Monster</i> was classified as-- is an old-fashioned term.</p>
<p>And I doubt Müller cares. He's a venerated producer with a style that people can probably recognize but nobody can imitate well. Hearing him come off a fairly quiet six years with something that doesn't sound at all anxious about being an Isolée album is a show of confidence-- warranted, of course.</p></div>"|15054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15054-well-spent-youth/|7.9|Mike Powell

Instead they were an ideas band, trying to place techno/rave's quickening rhythms in the context of processed guitar music. Because they executed those ideas so perfectly, it makes sense that they've regrouped more than a decade later in the name of new ideas.</p>
<p>I would like to think that Seefeel principals Mark Clifford and Sarah Peacock planned this all along, that they were biding their time until another potent, fully formed musical thought occurred. Last fall's <i>Faults</i> EP made it clear this wasn't the case: The band was still chewing on sounds and fumbling with rhythms. Any hope Seefeel viewed <i>Faults</i> as a stepping stone instead of a new a aesthetic goes out the window on <i>Seefeel</i>, the band's first full-length record since 1996.</p>
<p><i>Seefeel</i> is a thorny album, a thicket of crackling guitars and faltering rhythms. Peacock's sparse, drifting vocals-- at this point the last remaining element of the band's previous work-- navigate their way through by gingerly pulling branches aside. The rhythms-- usually live drums-- are supplied by former Boredoms drummer Iida Kazuhisa, but they contain none of that band's combustible clamor. Instead they grapple with the guitars in slow motion. (I'm reminded of professional hockey fights in which the players, with handfuls of each other's jerseys, awkwardly tussle.) Seefeel's guitars now scrape and smolder, but the foggy landscapes they evoke on tracks like ""Rip-Run"" and, um, ""Dead Guitars"" don't seem as rich as those molded by Fennesz or Black Dice.</p>
<p>Seefeel have thankfully retained the ability to build an environment. If their previous albums sounded womb-like, <i>Seefeel</i> is more like being an overgrown forest, including the nagging discomfort: ""This place has a dark beauty, but I wish my socks weren't damp."" That discomfort may be one of the compositional aims of <i>Seefeel</i>, and sometimes it leads to arresting, challenging anti-pop, like on ""Step Down"", where Peacock pines sweetly over an ominous mechanical advance.</p>
<p>I want to admire <i>Seefeel</i> for its decisive move away from the band's past, but I can't find the complexity and depth that allowed them to take an exhausting style-- shoegaze-- and turn it into something new and special. I don't care that Seefeel no longer chip hypnotic rhythms out of blocks if icy guitars, but it bothers me a lot that the simple drum pattern on ""Rip-Run"" never evolves and that Peacock sounds strangled. The issue isn't one of an old fan pining for glory days; it's an old fan wondering if <i>Seefeel</i> would deserve notice if it were released by a group of 20-year-olds in New York or London. The answer is yes, I think, but just barely.</p></div>"|15084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15084-seefeel/|5.6|Andrew Gaerig

Not since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZnGKlx4UZU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gene</a> has an artist sought so blatantly to turn Morrissey idol worship into instant credibility: Now signed to a major, his introduction was called <i>This Charming Mixtape</i> despite its <i><a href=""http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRxo4bkv6MiXIBkGmCq1RsaG9g5XkjGhirCXdSk6F3P6DD2abWg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Year's American Apparel Model</a></i> cover art, and these days you can catch him rocking a <a href=""http://www.smith.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smith College</a> hat, which-- double word score-- happens to be an all-female institution of higher learning. Fine-- maybe he's not trying to be some sort of inside operative attempting to subvert hip-hop's typical ideas of masculinity, intellect, and proper sonic influence. But from <i>Lovers Holiday</i>, it's plain to see why his forthright opinions are more often found in men's fashion mags than hip-hop rags: he's either unwilling or incapable of letting his music do any of the actual legwork.</p>
<p>That said, its easy to see what the draw is with London: By cutting straight rhyming with large quantities of R&amp;B's 80s futurism and teen-friendly pop, he represents the contemporary ideal for a modern MC. And unlike, say, B.o.B. or Kid Cudi, you never get the idea A&amp;Rs had to massage a rhyme spitter past into a <i>Billboard</i>-aspiring present. That's pretty much been the plan from Day One for London, so there will be no protests of compromise. Problem is, the smug entitlement, unctuous self-satisfaction, and cornball loverman raps reveal its bloodline to the drunk uncle of current radio rap: Common's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1565-electric-circus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Electric Circus</i></a>.</p>
<p>But that was a whole lot of momentarily misguided ambition, whereas <i>Lovers Holiday</i> has London with his grip on the controls, putting together a concept EP of sorts that attempts to capture the angles of humankind's most complex emotion but mostly just reminds me of places where I pay too much for work slacks. The coked-out couture-pop of ""Why Even Try?"" is typical of the hollowed chill preferred by London, and whatever novelty could be gleaned from having Sara Quin (of Tegan and...) as a guest is spoiled by giving her the role and vocal processing of any given R&amp;B gun for hire. If you ever needed a primer on what made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11926-yamaha/"" target=""_blank"">""Yamaha""</a> a display of The-Dream's mastery, go check out the rental version of ""Little Red Corvette"" offered by ""Strange Love"". The idea of whether this is ""real hip-hop"" is moot; it simply falters as pop.</p>
<p>But the gaping void at the center is London himself-- for all the Moz namedropping, he's retained none of his poetry, none of his vocal presence, and certainly none of his wit. His singing voice is serviceable enough, but he has pretty much one flow as a rapper, a halting cadence that has him wheezing for breath at the end of every half bar and gives you plenty of time to register what you've just heard. Most often, his lack of vocal engagement makes outright clunkers scarce, but there are plenty of fortune cookie jewels (""You look ahead and I know you see the stop signs/ A blind man know it's not green all the time"") and squeamish come-ons (""Girl I ain't goin' nowhere sit here and cops and robbers down by the moonlight"") that are impossible to miss. References to camera phones and real-time Facebook updates act as signifiers of ""love in the modern time"" on ""Wine &amp; Chocolates"", yet 2011 still finds a place for harlequin romance details and the fumbled eroticism of a thousand college poetry classes. Competition is fierce, but ""We can wear matching shoes like 'Thriller'/ And watch <i>Godzilla</i>"" ultimately won out for the biggest facepalm. This all comes immediately after the hook on prior track ""Girls Girls $"" becomes the most frequently heard line of <i>Lovers Holiday</i>-- ""She got drunk/ Showed her pussy on WorldStar.""</p>
<p>Recently, London was profiled in a feature called <a href=""http://hypebeast.com/blog/theophiluslondon/2010/11/rebel-style-tl-in-gq-magazine-dec-issue/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rebel Style""</a>, but tellingly it was in GQ as opposed to any publication related to music.

According to PR lore, band founder Jacob Danish Sloan, a disillusioned former child prodigy of the upright bass who had a really strong desire to be a rhythm guitarist, bumped into bandmate Madison Farmer while walking along Manhattan's decidedly downtown Essex Street. Both of their iPods were playing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Smiths</a>' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen_Is_Dead"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Queen Is Dead</i></a>-- still unconfirmed if they were also carrying identical copies of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perks_of_Being_a_Wallflower"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i></a>-- and bam, a band was born. They found their drummer, Alexander Iezzi, in a bar, less interestingly (and probably more true).</p>
<p>If you read that tale as a piece of unintentional indie pop parody, you're not to blame. The fibers of ridiculousness strengthen when putting on Dream Diary's debut LP, <i>We Are the Beat</i>. From the opening six-stringed chimes of ""Paper Flowers"", it's clear that we have our first post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> act of 2011. Granted, Pains aren't exactly bastions of originality either-- which is exactly what makes Dream Diary's copy-of-a-copy shtick so hide-your-eyes embarrassing. That, and Sloan's vocals; his thin-lipped, super-affected delivery makes the entire <a href=""http://www.slumberlandrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slumberland</a> batting order look like a bunch of Pavarottis, as it swallows words and obscures sentiments.  Not that the lyrical content here is particularly deserving of close analysis; selected song titles (""Something Tells Her"", ""She Has a Way"") suggest that this record sort of wrote itself. Still, it's hard to believe that in the process of writing and recording ""Audrey of Spirits"", no one pointed out that Sloan's storybook coo makes his pre-chorus utterance sound a whole lot like ""Suckin' your penis.""</p>
<p>The reasonable improvement that could be made to <i>We Are the Beat</i>, then, would be to ditch the singer-- because when he's imaginarily removed from the proceedings, there's really nothing else that's going horribly wrong here. Parts are played, the production is well-executed, and there are even a few decently catchy melodies (the descending mini-fantasia of ""Something Tells Her"", the clean shoegaze structure of ""Young Veronica""). Not even a single bookish hair is out of place here, which in a way makes Dream Diary's place in the still-going Slumberland Revivalist arena that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2520-longwave/"" target=""_blank"">Longwave</a>'s in the early-aughts Manhattan Rock Explosion: slick, competent, and uncanny at turning sounds normally attached to real feelings into something as joyless and workmanlike as waking up for your job in the morning.</p></div>"|15091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15091-you-are-the-beat/|4.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

The Mexico City foursome has spent the past several years cutting its teeth in that capital's indie rock scene, furnishing a catalog that's fundamentally at odds with what its local audience asks of its own: pop songs sung in Spanish. Instead, Chikita Violenta sing in English like the 1990s American indie rock bands on which they were weaned-- Built to Spill, Pavement, Modest Mouse, Tortoise. In addition, they've opted to record extensively in Toronto with producer Dave Newfeld of Broken Social Scene fame. It makes for interesting moves: while the ultra-saturated tones and widescreen scale that made Newfeld synonymous with BSS play a noticeable role in Chikita Violenta's psych-pop transmissions, <i>TRE3S</i>, their third long-player (released by the Canadian supergroup's Arts &amp; Crafts imprint), finds them continuing to home in on shapes and textures of their own.</p>
<p>A good place to begin is the end. In the first warbled seconds of closer ""My Connection"", indecipherable studio chatter is punctuated with a clear invitation: ""Hey, come on in."" Light, hand-woven guitar melodies sprawl in 38 directions at once. People continue to laugh and hoot and holler in the background. A sunny all-member chorus quickly comes into focus. ""My connection just fades away/ My connection just fades away/ Thanks for coming/ Now just walk away."" Its sentiment isn't at all in line with the welcoming way they sing it, but that opening gesture is one with the rest of the indie rock anthemry to be found here. But deeper inside a song like ""My Connection"", you can hear a sense of rapport that clearly allows them to link up in really thrilling ways at times.</p>
<p>Opener ""Roni"" pairs polluted, Ponderosa-thick riffs with gentler acoustic lines to heady effect, its aired out chorus almost lofty as the ones featured in duo ""All I Need's a Little More"" and ""Tired"". Those two in particular lean heavily on Broken Social Scene-established dynamics and sonics, though the schizophrenic pieces of the former glue together really nicely with the help of the sing-a-long at its center. It's a bit of a trade-off. While Chikita Violenta have no problems huddling together to fashion an outsized vocal hook, much of the detail in their sometimes stunning interplay can get lost in froth of those same vocals. Though it's difficult to find a pulse in the grind of ""The Pause"" or meandering ""Siren"" for example, all of the moving acoustic parts of ""España"" can be found on full display. It's a march that gathers a lot of steam and a lot of tension without ever falling prey to its production values or weighty ambitions. They sound like themselves.</p></div>"|15094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15094-tre3s/|6.5|David Bevan

""Will this decade be remembered as the Dubstep meets pub singer years?"" he asked, not naming the 22-year-old producer who, only that morning, was highlighted in the BBC's Sound of 2011 poll. When dubstep boomed and shuddered from Croydon at the dawn of the last decade, Blake wasn't yet a teenager. Barrow, on the other hand, was almost 40 and already on hiatus from one of the previous decade's most influential bands. He'd heard the rise of dubstep-- its cavernous bass, quick-click rhythms, bent vocal hooks-- and the tall, plaid-wearing kid from Enfield must have sounded a lot like its populist fall.</p>
<p>Barrow's dismissal of Blake is, presumably, a defense of dubstep-- the gesture suggests a purist, an elitist, or both. Reconsidered from the other artistic end, however, the implication is that maybe this is the decade where singer-songwriters-- longtime wastrels of pianos and six-strings with three chords-- finally get interesting, manipulating their pretty little voices and best love songs for something more than plain ballads and pleas. In that case, Barrow is right about Blake's full-length debut. Composed of tender torch songs, elegiac drifters, and soulful melodies, Blake's first puts him in the rare company of fellow singers-- Thom Yorke, Karin Dreijer, Antony Hegarty, Justin Vernon, Dan Bejar-- who've recently bent their own lavish voices, <i>not</i> samples, to make interesting pop music shaped with electronics. These songs are bigger than the defense of any microgenre, and, chances are, they'll soon make Blake a star. He deserves it.</p>
<p>Dubstep producer Untold released ""Air and Lack Thereof"", Blake's first single, on his Hemlock label in 2009; it was solid, slightly spooky dubstep, with drums darting around a sample that kept eroding. Since that debut, though, Blake has slowly focused on crafting songs-- bona fide, three-to-four minute builders-- around hooks. Last year's ""CMYK"", for instance, spliced Blake's voice with cuts from American R&amp;B to place an indelible hook inside a number that actually progressed through its four minutes. Blake's more recent <i>Klavierwerke</i> EP draped its dance floor intentions around his own sweetly sung voice. And now, he moves still further from abstraction, to verses and even an occasional chorus.</p>
<p>While the songs are the magnetic center here, Blake's musicianship and sonics are equally striking. A ""dubstep"" producer with a gentle piano touch and an ear for granular synthesis so sharp it will make fleets of laptop toters envious, his toolkit is seamless. The two-part ""Why Don't You Call Me"" / ""I Mind"", for instance, opens with only voice and piano, played with the studied delicacy of a classical student. But Blake cuts it short 30 seconds in by splicing and resampling the piano line. He then bends his own voice and sings the lone verse twice, editing and re-shaping it into a new form that bears only the faintest resemblence to its opening source material. In the suite's second half, the vocals become spinning smears that fall into the background. It's the only time on the album where the drum clicks, static bursts, and piano splashes become the essential motion. It's the type of track you might have heard on one of his recent EPs-- the kind Blake purists lament this album's supposed lack of.</p>
<p>With this new LP-- released on a major label on both sides of the Atlantic, no less-- odds are, a lot of people are going to listen, and I don't mean in the tail-eating, blog-bite-blog sort of way. ""Lindisfarne II"" takes what Bon Iver's<i> For Emma, Forever Ago</i> did best and turns it into a simple, poignant mantra; if it doesn't score the season's end of some prime-time drama, a music director should be fired. The same goes for the album-ending ""Measurements"", which somehow pulls the sound of a Southern black gospel choir from Blake's laptop and white-boy coo. Feist cover ""Limit to Your Love"" works in just enough of dubstep's bass flutter and snare snap. If Blake really does cross over and become the pretty white male who introduces a broader audience to dubstep, with its foundations in Jamaican music and black musicians in South East London, he'll receive the tired, requisite backlash. But these 11 songs-- gorgeous, indelible tunes that are as generous in content as they are restrained in delivery-- will last a lot longer.</p></div>"|15081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15081-james-blake/|9.0|Grayson Currin

Young Galaxy were a mostly stagnant indie rock band out of Montreal whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10054-young-galaxy/"">dream-pop debut</a> failed to garner any buzz on Arts &amp; Crafts records. When 2009's <i>Invisible Republic</i> reduced their reliance on obfuscation and tightened their rhythms, they still felt like a genre band outside the indie zeitgeist: theatric, self-serious synth-pop. <i>Shapeshifting</i>, the band's third album and first on Paper Bag Records, was produced remotely by Studio's Dan Lissvik. The band retains their big-idea spaciness but sees Lissvik place his coiled rhythms and pulsing synths all over. The result is Young Galaxy's finest record, and while it's impossible to say if Lissvik made the band better, he definitely made them more interesting and relevant.</p>
<p>Young Galaxy have always been good at glancing skyward, but Lissvik provided them the jetpacks necessary to travel there. Lissvik received a fully recorded album from the band and was charged with producing/augmenting the material. Whatever specific contributions he did make, <i>Shapeshifting</i> sounds like his work, at least rhythmically: The songs are underpinned by short, repeating circuits of disco guitar, twinkling piano, and disco thumps. It's impossible to hear the tropical whorls of ""Peripheral Visionaries"" or the way ""Phantom""'s jumping, trebly guitars sink in and out of elongated sighs without hearing the elusive Swede. Sometimes the results are stunning. On ""We Have Everything"", McCandless casts aside her celestial musings in favor of ascendant personal theater: ""I wept when we parted/ I wept when we united/ In poverty my love we have everything,"" she sings, Lissvik stretching a cityscape behind her. ""B.S.E."" recalls a more muscular version of the Eurythmics.</p>
<p>Young Galaxy make explicit the type of evergreen romanticism mostly implied by bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=m83&amp;search_type=standard"">M83</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=the+dears&amp;search_type=standard"">the Dears</a>. Songs like ""We Have Everything"" will make you want to seize your inner libertine and/or power through your modest gym workout. They are not fucking around with vagaries or self-consciousness: at one point Catherine McCandless sings, ""Watch as energy/ Rolls out to us on golden horns of light."" McCandless and the less operatic but less captivating Stephen Ramsay are hopelessly, furiously enchanted throughout. The lyrics can be oppressively silly, and even if they're no more so than some of Young Galaxy's peers (Cut Copy, M83) I find it harder to suppress the snickers during their starry dramas. <i>Shapeshifting</i> is not an album for those repulsed by horoscopes and dreamcatchers.</p>
<p>Dance music errs on the side of fantasy frequently, though those fantasies tend to be self-contained (e.g. in the club, in your heart). <i>Shapeshifting</i> isn't proper dance music-- let's call it dance-inflected pop-- but it is fantastic and unbound. The friction between Lissvik's meticulous spheres and the abandon with which McCandless and Ramsay push against their edges generates a heat absent on prior Young Galaxy records. And while it would seem that makes the band the big winners here, they do provide the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12653-7-trx-intermission/"">occasionally sterile</a> Lissvik with excesses (of melody and emotion) that he doesn't always generate on his own. Listening to him handle it-- imagine a child trying to hold a beach ball underwater-- is <i>Shapeshifting</i>'s greatest reward.</p></div>"|15075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15075-shapeshifting/|7.6|Andrew Gaerig

Bolstered by a nascent fanbase from Haley's other concerns (the woodsy Boards of Canada revivalism of Sarin Sunday, the chewy instrumental hip-hop of Airliner, and SYSTM's frazzled electro), a retro-drenched series of mixes released under the <a href=""http://comtruise.com/kc/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Komputer Cast</a> banner, and eventual remixes for fellow 80s flag-wavers <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/com-truise/sleep-paralysist-com-truise-eyelid-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a> and <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/com-truise/twin-shadow-castles-in-the-snow-com-truise-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twin Shadow</a>, Truise built up a modest buzz, enough to be noticed by the folks at Ghostly. Remastered and re-packaged alongside four new bonus tracks, this reissue marks Haley's debut for the label, and immediately foregrounds him as one of the most interesting and promising producers to mine the weird intersection between 80s computer music nostalgia and proggy, electronic funk.</p>
<p>If we gave awards to musicians for art direction, Haley would be a lock for Best Newcomer. From the shock of red-orange and the Designers Republic-friendly flourishes that grace his official site through to his expertly refer- and rever-ential artwork sleeves, one might conclude that Haley's an aesthete, and certainly meticulous. This is relevant insofar as Com Truise's music also gives the impression of being immaculately designed. In the particular world of synthesizer music, everything is iterative, and a sound can always be pushed. This means that doubt is always around the corner, and finished tracks are frequently slowed by anxiety over whether they've been adjusted to paramount effect. Haley, you can tell, knows exactly what he's going for and exactly how to get it.</p>
<p>His detractors might argue that this is because he isn't working from his own vision at all. If there's a knock on Haley, it's that his music is too easily reducible to its influences, and that those influences are as decipherable as the source of his spoonerized pseudonym. It will, for example, be very difficult for anyone to write about this EP without mentioning Boards of Canada's <i>Geogaddi</i>, many of whose more uptempo, tremulous moments are echoed within, most notably on the pulsing synth swirls of tracks like ""Tripyra"" and ""Sundriped"". That there is generally a nostalgia angle being worked here probably also doesn't help.</p>
<p>And yet, as you move between the burned out shimmer of ""Slow Peels"" to the lurching, stutter-stepped prog of ""BASF Ace"", it scarcely feels like it matters; while a lot of <i>Cyanide Sisters</i> very patently tugs at the archetypes around electronic music and prog and nostalgia and the 80s, it does so with a muscle, gnarliness, and craft that makes it difficult to deny. In other moments, like the classical guitar sampling ""Norkuy"" and the vocal-led ""Pyragony"", Truise steps far enough out of character to suggest he's got plenty of other tricks up his sleeve. According to Ghostly, there's a proper full-length due later this year, so it won't be long before we have a better sense of Truise's path. Even if he just kept on mining this particular vein, though, he'd still be better than most.</p></div>"|15085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15085-cyanide-sisters-ep/|8.0|Mark Pytlik

The Philadelphia-based group skated on the edges of post-punk and no wave in the late 1970s, releasing just one 7"" (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqPdaTXutdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Zipper</a>"" b/w ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4vfUinLmms"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clockwise</a>"") during a five-year career. What they didn't know when they broke up in 1981 was the single had a big effect on Thurston Moore and the band he was starting at the time, Sonic Youth. 20 years later, Moore cited that influence in <i>Mojo </i>magazine, sparking a renewal that led to an archival Notekillers release on his Ecstatic Peace label, and the reforming of the band, whose members were now split between Philly and NYC.</p>
<p>Flash-forward another nine years, and the Notekillers have finally crafted their first album of new music since reuniting<i>. </i>That may seem like a long time, but it's understandable given how busy the three musicians are-- especially guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/7887-the-out-door-9/4/"">David First</a>, who has forged a three-decade <a href=""http://www.davidfirst.com/bio.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">career</a> as a minimalist composer and sound artist. Besides, time seems rather irrelevant for this band. The sound of the 10 chugging tracks on <i>We're Here to Help </i>is as vital and distinctive as those they originally crafted the first time around.</p>
<p>It's a sound that's accessible and welcoming, but not easy to pin down. This is ostensibly structured punk rock, with melodic shapes that resemble verses and choruses. The closest reference point is another underappreciated instrumental outfit, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Mell"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pell Mell</a>. Some songs also recall the brain-vs-brawn math-metal of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1127-don-caballero/"">Don Caballero</a>. But where both of those groups colored within their own designated lines, a good bit of Notekillers' appeal comes from their willingness to play rough and loose, and let their sounds spill around a bit. Sometimes they even stretch into feedback-drenched free jazz. And the band's melodic curves are deceptive-- often a catchy hook becomes a repetitive mantra before you know it, no doubt due to First's highly-developed feel for the powers of minimalism.</p>
<p>If that sounds too theoretical or abstract, don't worry-- <i>We're Here to Help </i>is way more fun than educational. The Notekillers make energy and momentum their main priorities throughout, and every song-- even the loosest and noisiest-- has its share of head-nodding beats and air-guitar-worthy riffs. For me, the best tracks feature a wide range of twists, leaps, and crescendos. Take ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO6vYRr-uIg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Papers</a>"": opening with a snaky guitar line akin to Pete Townsend's wiry intro to the Who's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg3fmZyE3cg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">version</a> of ""Shakin' All Over"", the trio swerves from rising rave-ups, to hypnotic chord repetitions, to fiery noise, to even a bouncy middle section begging for hand-clap accompaniment. Such fresh diversity makes it seem like the Notekillers could-- and hopefully will-- keep churning out this ecstatic music for a long, long time.</p></div>"|15087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15087-were-here-to-help/|7.4|Marc Masters

He sleepily looks on as teenage rapper Rye Rye runs circles around his cluttered, manic beat. On the cover of <i>Divine </i>EP, nearly four years later, the Baltimore club producer is front and center, shirtless and mohawked, almost cherubic-looking. Probably still blunted. And he has removed ""DJ"" from his name, signaling the shift from game-changing maker of club music to experimental bedroom producer.</p>
<p>For Bmore club obsessives, Blaqstarr's move away from rapid-fire dance music is a bit like OutKast's André 3000 starting to sing: a master abandoning his field of expertise for some brassy musical indulgence. Even Blaqstarr's 2006 regional hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyxY7OE5YQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ryda Girl""</a> is stripped of its frenetic dance elements here (and retitled ""Rider Girl""). Anybody familiar with the original can't help but view <i>Divine </i>EP's softer version as a bit of a buzz-kill. But for the many, many more who never heard ""Ryda Girl"", and never heard of Blaqstarr at all, the stumbling interplay of dancing synths, plucked bass, and Blaq's naïve croon are enough to make it transcendent. For most, it doesn't need those trademark Bmore club claps.</p>
<p>The <i>Divine </i>EP isn't a complete sea change anyway. The last productions we heard from DJ Blaqstarr in his former style arrived all the way back in 2009 (Rye Rye's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP_rby0mvvY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bang""</a> and the single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18FCjc7QiM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Get Off""</a>, produced by Diplo) and his shambling slow jams for M.I.A (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10564-kala/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kala</i></a>'s ""The Turn"" or ""XXXO"" and ""It Iz What It Iz"" off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14434-y/"" target=""_blank""><i>/\/\/\Y/\</i></a>) are hardly floor-filling stuff. The differences between DJ Blaqstarr, producer of ""Tote It"", a whirl of vocals and a spare gunshot percussion, and the Blaqstarr of ""Divine"", a similar though markedly quieter mess of explosive dance elements and stoned studio meandering, are more a matter of degree.</p>
<p>The pastiche qualities of Baltimore club remain, only now Blaqstarr's focus is stacking styles rather than organically fusing them together. ""All the World"", a formless intro track, jerks alive with a burst of dance-punk style drumming; ""Oh My Darlin'"" is an oblique stripper ballad with radio R&amp;B drums. Incessant, eventually hypnotic piano makes ""Turning Out"" a mini-epic about lost love (maybe for a girl, maybe for club music). ""Wonder Woman"" sticks spare bluesy guitar on top of a low-in-the-mix flurry of drums and ""what?!"" shouts. In other words, it's a genuine Baltimore club track.</p>
<p>That hint of raucous dance music is a cruel tease to longtime fans of the club music visionary and a tacit acknowledgment by Blaqstarr himself that producing next-level chaos is just one of the many things that interests him these days. Now, you've got to listen closely. <i>Divine </i>EP won't grab you by the throat. It runs on its own pothead logic and takes a little while to sink in. These songs become much more interesting during their 10th listen, and though that's taxing, especially coming from a producer whose reputation previously hinged on explosive dance tracks, it doesn't make <i>Divine </i>EP's ghettotech-tinged, meditative R&amp;B any less remarkable.</p></div>"|15088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15088-divine-ep/|6.8|Brandon Soderberg

(The note contained helpful phrases such as ""Do Not Erase / I Was Ak / Flourish.Flourish.Flourish./ Fuck Shit Up.""). Somehow, that crate of detritus ultimately coalesced into <i>Akron/Family II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT</i>, a record purportedly written in a cabin built into the side of an active volcano in Akan National Park in Hokkaido, Japan and recorded in an abandoned train station in Detroit.</p>
<p>Whether all that's true or not, everyone appreciates a good bit of myth-making, and it's a fitting narrative for a record that plays like a sci-fi novel: Listen long enough and you'll hear volcanoes, old trains, purple lights, and Detroit summer, all tangled up with snippets of found sound and goofy lyrics about worms. There are plenty of global influences here, from Brazilian fuzz to Japanese noise, but Akron/Family's always been most interested in repurposing ancient American folk music, and they pull from Harry Smith's famed <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i> as much as anything else. Like compatriots Animal Collective, MV &amp; EE, and the No-Neck Blues Band, Akron/Family manage to make even the most familiar refrains-- like the sing-the-vowels opening of ""A AAA O A WAY""-- sound deeply strange.</p>
<p>The band, which splits time between New York City and Portland, Oregon, lost founding member Ryan Vanderhoof in 2007 (he left to enter a Buddhist Dharma center); they soldiered on as a trio. Since Vanderhoof's departure, the band's M.O. has become increasingly tricky to define (they can riff like the Kinks-- see ""So It Goes"", especially-- or meander like early Tower Recordings, depending on the track), but they're at their best when they're shooting for some kind of ecstatic high.  The spastic, shimmering ""Another Sky"" is the album's glowing center; it streaks out of your speakers like an aurora borealis. ""The first light of the morning echoes the song in my heart,"" quasi-frontman Seth Olinsky sings in his thin, easy voice (it nicely balances the roughness of his distorted guitar). Light is a reoccurring notion here, both lyrically and musically-- almost all of these songs open up like fireworks, leaving a shower of sparks.</p>
<p><i>Akron/Family II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT</i> is a curious collage (not unlike that box of stuff), but its eclecticism ends up being one of its greatest assets.  Organic and jubilant, it successfully weaves psych, world, rock, and folk traditions into something new and endlessly compelling.</p></div>"|15052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15052-akronfamily-ii-the-cosmic-birth-and-journey-of-shinju-tnt/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

It opens on rotating close-ups of the band's members, each cut timed to a chord change. As the song escalates, their faces grow progressively bloodier and more battered. It's rough stuff, and it becomes increasingly difficult to watch, but it wouldn't be half as unsettling without the song, which builds its descending bass line into a knee-trembling wall of guitars, with lead singer Rachel Davies' full-throated wail on top. It is profoundly arresting, suggesting a hybrid of <i>Pornography</i>-era Cure with Florence's evil sister on vocals.</p>
<p>If the resulting full-length were half as compelling as that heady sales pitch, <i>Violet Cries</i> would be one of the best albums of the year. Unfortunately, Esben and the Witch, a Brighton-based three-piece signed by Matador last year, aren't quite as potent or frightening as they want to be. They are one of the highest-profile of a recent crop of bands that have reached back to goth for inspiration; their name is a reference to a ghoulish, Hansel-and-Gretel-like Danish folk tale, and Davies' lyrics are purple with references to ""strange metallic voices"" and other macabre signifiers.</p>
<p>They've certainly got the pure sound of it nailed down. More than most mini-genres, goth demands ambiance-- the mood is everything, and on this front, <i>Violet Cries</i> succeeds tremendously. The record is mixed by Rodaidh McDonald, who produced the xx's debut album, and there is a similarly ringing gorgeousness to the sound here: Every chord and drum beat echoes into a cavernous emptiness. The guitars, in particular, sound fantastic, drifting like graveyard fog on the verses and then digging in like meat hooks on the choruses. Davies' voice is a spectacular instrument, as commanding in its dusky lower register as when she scales up into a shout. <i></i></p>
<p><i>Violet Cries</i> gets so many of these little details right that it's perplexing that it isn't more compelling. But they haven't quite figured out vivid songwriting yet. The songs are frustratingly drowsy, a series of interludes with the surrounding meat seemingly excised. Despite her alluring voice, Davies struggles to form memorable melodic lines, and dirges like ""Light Streams"" and ""Hexagons IV"" drift by and melt together without leaving much of an impression. The album's through-line is so slack and billowy that when it suddenly snaps taut, as on ""Marching Song"", or the commanding ""Warpath"", or the screeching build in the last minute of ""Euminides"", you are left with a bracing sense of what could have been. <i>Violet Cries</i> never delivers on its promise, though-- in order to deliver, goth needs to be pitched at some sort of extreme, to risk ridiculousness through abandon, and the members of Esben and the Witch are too tasteful and careful to take the plunge. The cumulative impact is more tepid than bone-chilling.</p></div>"|15082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15082-violet-cries/|6.6|Jayson Greene

In the analog 1970s, Hans-Joachim Roedelius made do with the merely real, coaxing miles of variation from his Farfisa's limited selection of timbres, which all tended to be shrill and watery. He recorded the material that would be released in a long series of <i>Selbstportraits </i>whenever he wasn't busy helping to define Krautrock and ambient music as a co-founder of seminal <i>kosmische </i>bands Cluster and Harmonia. His augustly hyphenated name makes him sound like a severe German classical composer, but he brought a playfully jazzy sensibility to these solitary miniatures, improvisations, and moods. Amid Brian Eno's stillness and Kraftwerk's speed and light, Roedelius found a middle way between the void and the Autobahn. His <i>Selbstportraits </i>are dreamy, introspective cruises, rising and falling as if over looping country lanes.</p>
<p>Recorded over old tape at low speed, in mono, on a Revox reel-to-reel, these albums sound <i>really </i>dated. That's why this happens to be an ideal moment to re-release the first two, as their datedness-- they were originally issued on Sky Records in 1979 and 1980-- feels quite contemporary, thanks to the modern resurgence of Roedelius' style of gently propulsive, floridly minimalist keyboard music. You hear it everywhere in recent years, from Oneohtrix Point Never and Arp to Ducktails and Nite Jewel, burbling in woolly analog atmospheres. It seems that when modern musicians aspire to something back-to-basics with electronic music, it's Roedelius' durable easy-listening/new-age aesthetic they're after. <i>Selbstportrait I</i> and <i>II</i> are similar in style and quality, and casual fans may need only one in their lives. <i>II </i>has a couple of the best individual tracks, and contains added material. <i>I </i>is stronger overall, or at least feels that way because it came first, introducing the palette and ideas Roedelius continues to explore on <i>II</i>.</p>
<p>The formula is deceptively simple. There are usually two or three distinct voices, one of which will be an ostinato-- the coursing piano of ""In Liebe Dein"", or the thrumming bass clusters of ""Fabelwein""-- while the others modulate thematic material around it in windy, twisting lines. Sometimes, the ostinato is left out in favor of sheer thematic exploration, as on ""Inselmoos"", where Roedelius manipulates a sticky harpsichord-like motif through major, minor, and hints of chromatic modes. The music is usually solidly tonal, eschewing dissonance to create a sense of everlasting flow. Roedelius preferred gambits of harmony and counterpoint-- one of his favorites is to let a clump of established intervals suddenly unclench and go wheeling across an octave or more. It's not that the music isn't brainy: The carefully patterned pitches, timbres, and durations of ""Girlande"", for instance, suggest a lot of forethought. But it doesn't make a big deal about its braininess. Each track is intent on clearly illuminating a musical notion. The groovy low-frequency bagatelle ""Signal"" seems to preemptively summarize Boards of Canada in less than 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The <i>Selbstportraits </i>can be monotonous; monotony is part of their charm. Roedelius' versatility with limited resources imbues the music with what can only be described as a deep humanity-- a mandatory thoughtfulness. ""Prinzregent"" has a remotely Asian cast, while ""Herold"" gestures at funk. ""Halmharfe"" has a Nordic dolefulness, and ""Arcona"" has a breezy Latin feel. ""Aufbruch"", a standout track from <i>II</i>, introduces the pointillistic arpeggios of techno into the matrix. But it's all so blended into Roedelius' almost-subliminal style that a cursory listen makes the albums sound monolithic, like one undifferentiated electronic pulse. You have to slow down and attune to both the pace and the narrow palette of Roedelius' world, and then the little differences seem huge. That, all in all, is the magic of this music-- it inspires the familiar nostalgia of having more appreciation for fewer options.</p></div>"|15080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15080-selbstportrait-selbstportrait-ii/|7.9|Brian Howe

This side project of two of Brooklyn lo-fi's marquee acts finds Woods bassist Kevin Morby trading songwriting duties and vocals with chief Vivian Girls songwriter Cassie Ramone, whose fast-and-loose way with pitch is a source of contention in the indie rock world. Morby's Woods are a bit of a litmus test themselves, their spindly, bedhead country-folk too mellow and unfinished-sounding for some. The Babies recorded their self-titled debut at Brooklyn's <a href=""http://alteredzones.com/posts/832/inside-woodsist-rear-house-studios/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rear House</a> with Woods' Jarvis Taveniere, and the backroom vibe present on most of his productions turns up here as well. Point being, the temptation to put <i>The Babies</i> together in your mind before you've even heard it can overwhelm any reservation of judgment.</p>
<p>The reality, it turns out, is often more interesting than the sum of its parts. Heard here, Morby's ramshackle country-folk sounds like Woods on a good night's sleep and a pot of strong coffee, running dirtier and kicking a whole lot harder. Morby's voice carries a slight twang and a frequently pronounced derangement, while Ramone-- when she's not left to sing these songs alone-- puts in a showing that might not change any minds, but does hint at where her strengths lie. At its best, <i>The Babies</i> conjures not the shrugged-off ease of either principal's better-known gigs, but the odd-couple white lightning of Johnny and June, Frank and Kim, or John and Exene, run through a K Records filter. Unusual as it is, Ramone knows how to make her voice work for her-- see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/402-vivian-girls/875-tell-the-world/"">""Tell the World""</a> from Vivian Girls' debut-- and here, when she and Morby crash into one of their delirious top-heavy harmonic pile-ups, the result is dizzying.</p>
<p>Take ""Breakin' the Law"", an outlaw's honeymoon trip with a hook so worn-in you'd think it was a cover. Ramone deadpans while Morby fills in the melody. ""Meet Me in the City"" taps the pure ripchord energy and guy-gal vocal multiplication of <i>Wild Gift</i>-era X, while closer ""Caroline"" ends with a shout-along only a bit less rousing than the similarly-named Neil Diamond tune. Their voices, each a bit spiky apart, line up together with an eerie beauty, like they’ve been singing together far longer than they have, and the tunes they attach to their back-and-forth tend to be the Babies' most infectious.</p>
<p>It's when Morby and Ramone put a little space between them that <i>The Babies</i> falters. Morby's breezy, Ramone-less tunes tend to downshift somewhere between Pavement and the first couple of Frank Black and the Catholics LPs; he's got a nice and easy way with hooks and a smart aversion to overcomplication, but his punker ""Personality"" only has so much, and the jerky ""Sunset"" feels stale. Ramone solo doesn't fare quite as well. ""All Things Come to Pass"" bobs along on a pleasant enough melody, one that she seems to take as a mere suggestion; her voice draws curlicues around the verses, sounding like she'd rather be doing almost anything but singing them. Yet she manages to swing around on the choruses, not exactly evincing perfect pitch but suggesting another take might have done the whole song some good. Her husky bit on ""Voice Like Thunder"" is equally nonchalant, and the bridge she sings on opener ""Run Me Over"" almost destroys the good will created by its grinning lead-in until Morby swoops in. But the dirgey, yearning ""Wild 1 is a lost cause, as Ramone's vocal veers quickly into the painful.</p>
<p>What's ultimately frustrating about <i>The Babies</i> is how much potential is floating around in there, and how game they are to spike it. In throwing in his lot with Ramone, Morby's big songwriting debut is now tied up with all kinds of preconceived notions about his songwriting partner. And Ramone, who actually sounds as good or better here singing with Morby than she does with her breathy Vivian Girls compatriot Katy Goodman, does a number on the goodwill she builds up here with her maddeningly inconsistent performances. So they've made made a spotty but occasionally quite successful record, complicated considerably by Ramone's take-them-or-leave-them vocals, still the kind of thing only those with their minds already made up could truly love. You expected something else?</p></div>"|15078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15078-the-babies/|5.8|Paul Thompson

Some sort of orc factory? I don't remember, honestly, but as thinly veiled as the environmental allegory of the scene was, the justice inherent to a bunch of trees taking out the very industrial operation that had been depleting the forest was quite satisfying. The album art for Hello Echo's debut album, <i>Hello</i>, takes that image and makes it several times more literal, showing an Ent-like tree, dukes up, squaring off against some sort of smokestack skyscraper monster, and the images continues onto the back of the digipack to reveal a nearby city about to be wiped out by a towering wave.</p>
<p>The overt environmentalism of its cover art doesn't quite carry over into the album's music, but it is reflected somewhat in the album's tension between the pastoral and the urban. The songs are full of images of moving out where people don't dominate the landscape, to the desert or the seaside, and in the case of the desert, they even juxtapose the landscape with the technology that moves them through it, in this case a car's engine. The trio is lead by guitarist Sean Aylward, best known for a one-album stint in Apollo Sunshine, whose drummer, Jeremy Black, produced <i>Hello</i>. He's joined by bassist Mike Sarno and drummer Mikey Silva, and together they make an interesting trio-- they have a pretty normal set-up, but Aylward's guitar is an unusual halfway point between lead and rhythm playing, especially when he's playing electric.</p>
<p>Aylward's style has its best showcase on ""Stone"". He layers acoustic and electric guitar into a cycling rhythm that imparts urgency to the song's unison singing, but when he breaks out for a little solo near the end of the song, it's very tied in to the structure of what he was already playing, an embellishment of the rhythm part. It's a good style that enlivens the band's songwriting, which is mostly quite strong but occasionally a little short on developed lyrics. Opener ""When Push Comes to Love"" is good to begin with, but his rattling, spiraling leads really blow it up into something huge. The best piece of pure songwriting is the quiet, country-tinged ""Disconnect Me"", which backs Aylward's nearly twangy lead vocal with spectral, wordless harmonies and just a few well-placed electric guitar accents.</p>
<p>That ""Disconnect Me"" succeeds so well without Aylward's guitar dominating it is a good sign for the band's future and potential to branch out. And I do hope they get the chance to branch out. <i>Hello</i> is a very solid debut by a band with plenty of talent-- it's not often I wind up spending so much of an indie rock review talking about a particular player's instrumental style, but Aylward really seems to have found his own voice on the guitar.</p></div>"|15076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15076-hello/|7.6|Joe Tangari

So if  it feels a little weird listening to an album of euphoric,  starry-eyed dance-rock on earbuds while you're scraping snow-grit off  your windshield, keep in mind: Somewhere in the world, someone is probably  road-tripping to a swimming hole with this album playing, or eating a  popsicle, or playing catch with their dogs while it blasts out of a car stereo or nearby boombox. By the time summer  arrives for those of us in the northern hemisphere, we'll know these  songs by heart and be able to sing along loudly.</p>
<p>Back when this group released 2004's <i>Bright Like Neon Love</i>, the idea of backing dazed, introverted indie pop with a utopian house thump was still relatively novel. And though that sound has since inspired legions of followers and copycats, still no one does it quite like Cut Copy themselves. 2008's steamrolling <i>In Ghost Colours</i> was an album of anthems; tracks like ""Hearts on Fire"" and ""Lights and Music"" were transcendent pop that stuck in heads for days. But <i>Zonoscope</i> is something different. It's an album-album that puts serious work into movements and transitions, and it works best when you hear it all in one chunk. That doesn't mean it's Cut Copy's <i>OK Computer</i>; it just means that the group has put more work into building a vast, rolling landscape rather than a series of peaks.</p>
<p><i>Zonoscope</i> opens with a blast of woozy ecstasy in the form of ""Need You Now"", the sort of track where you don't even realize how much tension the group has built up until they release it, and ends with ""Sun God"", a marathon 15-minute groove that slowly morphs into a tranced-out Giorgio Moroder thud. In between those two tracks, Cut Copy build a long-form piece of work that moves between genres and ideas and moods without ever sacrificing its dancefloor momentum.</p>
<p>""Take Me Over"" works in a bouncy hook from Fleetwood Mac's mid-80s party-staple ""Everywhere"" and gives a sly nod to their countrymen Men at Work, turning down-moments into playful  exercises in irresistible cheeseball melody. ""Where I'm Going"" is a twinkly, faraway sigh of a song that could pass for Washed Out if it wasn't for the titanic Gary Glitter drum-stomp powering it. And ""Pharaohs &amp; Pyramids"" may be the greatest thing here; it uses the band's melodic gifts and the sense of yearning in frontman Dan Whitford's voice and applies them to a classic Chicago house anthem, deploying its keyboard blips, synth-strings, and programmed cowbells at the exact right moments, building into a climactic cresting swoop.</p>
<p>Compared to the last two albums, <i>Zonoscope</i> has precious little guitar crunch, which makes it hard to even call Cut Copy a dance-rock band anymore. And that's for the best-- not just because that combination seems like a less thrilling prospect in 2011 than perhaps it once did, but also because Cut Copy have the architecture of dance music down perfectly and the confidence to execute the genre's moves with absolute precision. Even in the dead of winter, <i>Zonoscope</i> does its job beautifully. Imagine how it'll sound when you don't have to layer up to go outside.</p></div>"|15055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15055-zonoscope/|8.6|Tom Breihan

Suddenly, that clever little device rock bands had used to hook kids for decades was more than an accessory; it was the main event, and it was mean. ""Ouroboros Is Broken"", the 18-minute monster on the B-side, spewed its riff through distortion, baring claws over the industrial thwack of a drum machine before slowing down and stretching out toward forever. It was loud, punishing, and new; drone metal, the genre, followed.</p>
<p>In 2005, Earth reinvented themselves. After a nine-year hiatus, Dylan Carlson returned with a bigger lineup and, this time, a surprising sound. The slow motion was still there, as were the winding, deliberate riffs. But on <i>Hex; or Printing in the Infernal Method</i>, Earth's monolithic blast had given way to furrowed blues, the volume reduced to a gentle, living-room purr. Two years later, Earth re-recorded ""Ouroboros Is Broken"" for <i>Hibernaculum</i>, a short album that smartly recast four tunes from the first iteration of Earth in Carlson's new, infinitely arid style. That eight-minute reworking was a revelation, suggesting that not only were Carlson's riffs wonders-- maximum volume, or minimum-- but so were his control and patience. Above a steady drum trot, he bent that old theme with careful diligence, sometimes repeating notes, sometimes omitting them, sometimes letting them radiate. The metalhead knew his jazz and his Jerry Garcia. Here, he wielded those influences perfectly.</p>
<p>The second iteration of Earth has now been recording and touring longer than the first, foundation-shifting phase of the band. You'd be excused, then, for assuming that it's time for Carlson to slip back into the shadows or to again push restart. Rather, on <i>Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light 1</i>, he returns for his fourth LP with drummer Adrienne Davies, whose tasteful, robust, and slow swing has provided essential ballast for Carlson's thinly etched guitar since 2005. Carlson and Davies do make two personnel changes, though, and they prove essential: The K Records polyglot Karl Blau replaces longtime Earth bassist Don McGreevy, while the swelling organ and horns of Steve Moore are swapped for the much more versatile cello of Lori Goldston.</p>
<p>These shifts don't turn Earth into a new band, but they do provide a fresh context for Carlson's guitar. On the brilliantly winding ""Descent to the Zenith"", for instance, Goldston plays against him ever so gently, pushing against his pull, emphasizing the way his lines keep chasing their own tails. Moore's organ used to make Carlson's ideas sound bigger; here, by contrast, Goldston makes them sound smarter. On the album-closing title track, the quartet makes torpid circles for 20 minutes, the guitar, bass, and cello revolving separately around a melody. It's as mesmerizing as an early Earth marathon, just that much more intricate.</p>
<p>""Father Midnight"" is a tease in tension, with Carlson repeatedly sliding back and forth along a melody and Davies occasionally leaning into her snares and cymbals with added oomph. It suggests that Earth are about to break character, to roll suddenly like a rock band, to get loud. They, of course, never do. Goldston and Blau are essential to that feeling, as she runs knotty strands of dissonance through Carlson's staggered figures. What's more, Blau plays bass like a songwriter, meaning that he makes choices and takes chances a simple sideman might miss. On ""Father Midnight"", he's the tension-baiting free radical. Blau sometimes steps with Carlson, thickening his leads and keeping it simple; but he often steps out of that role with stray notes in spots that don't necessarily belong or truncated progressions that let the band slip past. For a unit recording together for the first time, this Earth makes complex, counterintuitive choices.</p>
<p>It might be tempting to dismiss <i>Angels of Darkness </i>as a showcase for one of the electric guitar's best craftsman. Carlson's finesse, after all, has never been better than on these five tracks. A master of tone with an ear for clarity and subtlety, he makes his rests as evocative as the notes themselves. And given the band's recent, steady gestalt, it's also tempting to dismiss <i>Angels of Darkness</i> as just another new album from the second Earth-- you know, the quiet band that's metal only by legacy and label. This isn't a radical reinvention as much as it's a refinement; the backing band and its leader have never been better. But when has Earth's music not been about hard-fought rewards and slow revelations? In the 90s, Earth's heavy metal offered an escape, a massive shelter of volume and drone. But the intricacies of this Earth-- Carlson's harmonics and harmonies, Davies' careful builds, Blau's unexpected bass maneuvers, Goldston's adventurous versatility-- demand attention and immersion. That is, check in, not out, and you'll rarely hear four players with as much quiet command.</p></div>"|15072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15072-angels-of-darkness-demons-of-light-1/|7.9|Grayson Currin

Throughout that release, the Denver psych-ish band created an impressively evocative topographic map of sound, as little details-- most notably, the arpeggiated sky-climb in EP standout ""When the Morning Comes""-- would pop out before retreating into an uneasy murk. On Woodsman's latest full-length, <i>Rare Forms</i>, there's one specific detail that frequently stands out: The addition of vocals, provided by band member Mark Demolar. His voice takes on multiple, uh, forms throughout the record; on opening track ""Insects"", he sounds like a wailing evangelist, while on ""Beat the Heat"" his words crackle above the surface.</p>
<p>Most of the time, though, he sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4174-avey-tare/"" target=""_blank"">Avey Tare</a>, alternating between freaked shrieks and nervy, low-delivered incantations. In fact, a decent amount of <i>Rare Forms</i> takes seemingly literal cues from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/"" target=""_blank""><i>Feels</i></a>-era AC, to the point where light plagiarism might not be too ridiculous of a charge to level-- all it takes is a comparison of the way-too-similar openings of one-two punch ""I Can't Move"" and ""Future Pulls"" to <i>Feels</i>' percolating ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj-0vMrZJbo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Banshee Beat</a>"" to arrive at that conclusion. The distraction of blatant unoriginality aside, <i>Rare Forms</i>' biggest problem is its lack of compelling structure, with a whole lot of atmospheric haze. The look works well in the spooky twilight of ""Dead Awake"" but sounds largely like gear-spinning elsewhere. There's little of the tension that existed in the band's previous recordings, and the result often feels as ephemeral as a passing cloud.</p>
<p>Also, Demolar's voice simply is not a necessary addition to Woodsman's sound; its presence alone gives the effect of a curtain being pulled open on a magician mid-trick, ruining any chance of built suspense. The bright spots, however, suggest that the missteps on <i>Rare Forms</i> are precisely just that-- ""No Dialogue"" has all the crushing grace of an abbreviated Earth cut, while the propulsive guitar-warrior stuff of ""Inside/Outside"" proves that these guys still know what they're good at. Hopefully, next time around the results will be a little more original-- and interesting-- while expressing their clear talent for creating instrumental dread and chaos.</p></div>"|15070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15070-rare-forms/|5.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

(He's made a few lateral moves too, working with Modeselektor and Fantastic Mr. Fox.) Part of SBTRKT's appeal must be his apparent flexibility: On his own productions, he has a crisp, driving sound that, like a lot of contemporary UK dance music, feels steeped in sub-styles that evolved in different directions (like two-step, funky, and dubstep) but have sloshed together over the past few years. Basically, he's a contempo-generalist, someone I'd guess is hired as much for his professionalism and sonic cleanliness as his artistic cache. Even his mask-- an all-purpose ""tribal"" piece fringed with what looks like dried grass-- is a well-meaning symbol: It's to say that ""who he is"" isn't as important as what he's doing. Of course, ""who he is"" is a question that has two meanings: One is the way that the IRS and DMV mean it, the other is the way that we mean it when we talk about what makes an artist stand out in the crowd.</p>
<p>In 2010 he released a handful of singles and EPs, several of them split or shared, several of them on reliably interesting labels, including Brainmath and Ramp. One of his last releases, <i>Step in Shadows</i>, came out on Young Turks, a label responsible for the xx, El Guincho, and Holy Fuck (an indication that even indie folks are hearing him as a kind of all-purpose ambassador from the world of Rill Dance Music).</p>
<p>My main concern about it-- or question, if you want to couch it that way-- has to do with the exact geographic or sonic location of SBTRKT himself. Over four tracks, he moves through styles so effortlessly that the running thread-- whether on the level of composition or sound itself-- is practically invisible. Rigid electro, thumb piano, warm atmospheric synth pads, Chicago-style house, the wobbly bass (which is to dubstep what distorted guitar is to hard rock)-- they're all here, but blended in ways that somehow sound both seamless and completely unintrusive. The moods are all nocturnal and a little sneaky, but that's like saying the mood of a cake is sweet-- it's more rule than distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>Untold, another London-based producer, covers a similar amount of stylistic ground (running all over house, dubstep, and funky), but has such an idiosyncratic way of sculpting and blending the sounds themselves that his tracks are easy to pick out-- they're stamped. The difference is between risking a smaller audience because you're headstrong about your style or risking an audience that isn't that invested in you because they're not sure who you are.</p>
<p>One of the paradoxes here is that there's nothing that sounds even remotely bad on <i>Step in Shadows</i>. It's a glossy and well-assembled 18 minutes of contemporary UK dance music. But it doesn't really command my attention, and it never sticks its neck out-- which seems like an all right way to play your remixes but a confusing way to treat your own music.</p></div>"|15074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15074-step-in-shadows/|6.0|Mike Powell

A husband and wife who record and perform music together would seem like strong candidates for being so intuitively intertwined. It'd certainly go a long ways towards explaining the strange folk-pop made by Ben + Vesper.</p>
<p>The world of marrieds Ben and Vesper Stamper is an appealingly odd one, where mundane chores and concerns rub shoulders with snatches of allusive poetry. A typical song on <i>Honors</i>, the duo's sophomore full-length release, will fancifully sketch an image of birds that ""soar above and back and forth in woolly skirts"" and then moments later earnestly ask, ""Are you getting six-plus hours?/ Is your will and testament in order?"" Actions and situations that might seem banal had they been laid out as conventional narrative get infused with wonder and intrigue when placed under the Stampers' stream-of-consciousness spell. ""Cell phone rings, a mother sings/ Or shopping for a bathing suit,"" the pair reports, but before you have a chance to find the thread, they've moved on to imaginatively observing, ""Carpet socks and static shocks/ Children wield electron fields.""</p>
<p>Ben + Vesper's music, while superficially your standard organic-feeling indie-folk, also seems solely beholden to its own internal logic, with melodic passages frequently broken up by abrupt riffs or discordant tangents. Such persistent tonal shifts theoretically suit the lyrics well, but they lack oomph and often set the duo's songs to meandering when sharper contrasts might've been genuinely thrilling. I look at what Ben + Vesper are doing as being conceptually similar to the Fiery Furnaces or even Pavement. The difference is that the Friedbergers and Stephen Malkmus invest their hodgepodge lyricism with abundant urgency, turning nonsense or banalities into fervent mantras and giving their quixotic tales the push and pull of real drama.</p>
<p>The Stampers, meanwhile, shy away from the loud-soft dynamics that could make even their most obtuse lyrical wanderings feel charged with clear-eyed significance, and only occasionally grasp the importance of giving their listeners an anchor amidst all the associative leapfrogging. When they do hit on a refrain, however, the effect is always galvanizing, and it really doesn't even matter what words they're intoning-- ""Style went to sleep tonight,"" ""Label your junk or lose it,"" and ""Thanks to a fireball"" all work just fine when repeated several times with obvious feeling. Those phrases all look pretty inscrutable on the page, but it's in these moments that Ben + Vesper most sound like they're speaking a language everyone can understand.</p></div>"|15071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15071-honors/|6.3|Joshua Love

Flip to page 20 and you'll  find a gem: a grainy shot of the foursome sitting on a bed, shoulder-to-shoulder, each with their own reading material.  Vocalist/guitarist Mark Gardener is at one end, nose-deep in a copy of the cornball self-help novella <i>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</i>. His bandmate, songwriting foil, and eventual  nemesis Andy Bell is left of center, peeking out from behind an issue of <i>Bunty</i>, an old British comic written for teenage girls. Bassist Steve  Queralt is engrossed in now-defunct UK pop rag <i>Number One</i>, while drummer Loz  Colbert seems rapt by the Christopher Isherwood novel perched at his  thumbs. With the exception of Gardener's book, a likely reference to <i>Nowhere</i> opener ""Seagull"", it's all very English. But at the same time,  there's magic more universal to unpack from this one image. The four of  them look like brothers. They look like ordinary, wise-ass kids you knew  or know. They look like a band.</p>
<p>If I  asked you about My Bloody Valentine, the other most seminal shoegaze band, chances are you'd think immediately  of Kevin Shields and the countless places you've heard his  singular guitar vision unfurl. But while Ride are often mentioned in  tandem with MBV, their  footprint owes more to their songwork than their sonics, and more to the way all four members clashed and combined. They weren't visionaries or  titans; they were young writers with a taste for high volumes. And they didn't situate their melodies amongst tides of effects-pedal-induced mayhem, either; they did it the other way around. Howls were  there to support hooks, and the psychedelic interplay between Gardener and Bell's two  guitars was far more pivotal to their mission than drapes of all-enveloping  noise. But that said, <i>Nowhere</i>, their seismic debut full-length, found them playing  with elements of the shoegaze sound as much as they ever would. While  it's one of the genre's enduring moments, it's Ride's for another  reason: This family of songs is their most focused.</p>
<p>The remastering on this edition makes that all the more clear. It  starts with a sharpening. <i>Nowhere</i> was never an especially warm listen,  and felt a little flat at times if it wasn't played  dangerously loud. The new shine seems so necessary once you hear it.  Each jangle and contour has been shored up and made more distinct, resulting in a richer listen. The first whinnies of ""Seagull"" sound even more serrated than before, and the elliptical guitar figure at its core is less  muddy. Gardener and Bell's dual vocals on ""Polar Bear"" are now as  streamlined as that song's livelier coda. And those are just two spots  where you can hear again what a great all-around fit they were in the  beginning. Not a note feels errant or alone, and Queralt and Colbert  sound inseparable, capable of pummeling through squall and  enhancing fragile passages with ease. Colbert comes on strong enough to dole out compound fractures, especially during ""Dreams Burn Down"" and ""Vapour Trail."" The latter remains immense, standing tall as the most gripping  four-and-half-minutes of their career. Twenty years later, it's exciting to realize  there's a lot more to be relished in between all its chimes.</p>
<p>Such  is the case for much of the first disc. When <i>Nowhere</i> first arrived in  late 1990, Ride had already released three outstanding EPs (<i>Ride</i>, <i>Play</i>, and <i>Fall</i>) that year  alone. The original North American release added three bonus tracks from <i>Fall</i>, which are joined here by three additional tracks from the album sessions: the workman-like trio of ""Unfamiliar"", ""Beneath"", and  ""Sennen"". The new edition also includes ""Today"", a beautiful, acoustic-based torch song  that plumes for miles and miles. Count it up and that's 23 songs of  fantastic quality, all culled from an opening stretch so fertile, the band  would have a much easier time crafting early setlists than they ever  would replicating that initial spark.</p>
<p>Though  the booklet is nice and the remastering essential, what makes this  anniversary package most intriguing is its second disc: a live set from a  Los Angeles show at the Roxy in Spring of 1991. Ride didn't come close  to making a splash in the States like they did at home, but on this  night, if audience noise is any indicator, their reception was electric.  Through headphones, it's hard to believe anyone on stage spent a moment gazing at their shoes, as the legend goes. Rifling through  just half of their catalog at the time, they sound like wild elephants  throwing their weight around. It's a terrific, thunderous recording and  you can quickly get a clear sense for why their live show garnered  as much excitement as it did then.</p>
<p>At the same time, the nature of what  they were trying to accomplish as a band really comes through in full.  The more abrasive tones of MBV and Sonic Youth were clearly an influence as they first started to write and record, but it's the  from-the-gut pop screech of Dinosaur Jr. that sounds like their closest  kin here. Ride's music wasn't necessarily game-changing but the songs are  the kind that last. When they close with ""Drive Blind"", a cut from their self-titled debut EP, they abandon the song's course just two minutes  in to catch a massive swell of guitar. It grows and grows and it grows  some more, and then, sure enough, the volume dips, and they circle right  back to where they started: a melody. They were really good at that.</p></div>"|15069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15069-nowhere-20th-anniversary-edition/|9.5|David Bevan

In it, Young expertly threads together the various manifestations of the genre and takes a look at how each successive generation has drawn on strands from the previous one, essentially mapping out a folk music version of Simon Reynolds' hardcore continuum. The book highlights how the root of many of those stylistic shifts stems from material aimed at children. At times this occurs through work like the traditional song ""The Derby Ram"", which Young uses as an example of how lyrics with a spiritual air often end up as kids' nursery rhymes; at others it's channeled from sources such as <a href=""http://www.oliverpostgate.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oliver Postgate</a>'s children's TV shows ""The Clangers""<i> </i>and<i> </i>""Pogles' Wood"", which cast a considerable shadow over the Ghost Box/hauntology scene that emerged around the middle of the last decade.</p>
<p>New York-based English singer-songwriter Essie Jain has intuitively wired herself into that same ethos with the release of her third album, <i>Until the Light of Morning</i>. Jain has worked on the periphery of the contemporary folk scene since contributing to the Kill Rock Stars compilation <i><a href=""http://www.buyolympia.com/killrockstars/Item=krs449"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Sound the Hare Heard</a></i> in 2006, but for this album she seems to have used all her prior recorded efforts as a cipher of sorts, a way of finding out what makes this music tick. In the sleeve notes Jain claims these songs were written after her friends started to have children; they all seemed to be searching for something appropriately soothing to get their little ones to sleep at night. And soothing it is-- both the vocals and arrangements produce a sense of being swaddled in a great surge of warmth, with Jain adroitly cushioning the listener from the real world.</p>
<p>So what we have here is an album of lullabies, just over half an hour in length, that features a mishmash of Jain's cottony voice and restful instrumental passages. The playing is sparse and tasteful, with Jon Mizrachi's spare taps of glockenspiel often providing the most appropriate counterpart to the snug vocals, while subtle touches of piano, bass, and guitar are slotted in at appropriate junctures. Jain is often compared to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Denny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandy Denny</a>, although her vocal work is less heavily accented, and there's a sense here that she is comfortably maturing into a style of her own. This she demonstrates on the first two tracks, from the soft cooing of ""What a Big Wide World"" to the higher range of ""Lay Down"". The latter is dripping in calm thanks to the light crisscrossing of voice and piano, in which Jain's simple invocations to sleep ultimately evolve into wordless humming as the track relaxes to a slumberous close.</p>
<p>There's nothing studied about this music, no attempt to awkwardly fit it into the freak-folk movement or anything else that could ostensibly win Jain any cool points. This creates a refreshing take on the genre, a return to its base tenets, via words that playfully reflect the habits of animals (""Falling Asleep"") or high-pitched moans that conjure up bewitching imagery of the night sky (""The Magic Star""). Sometimes these two worlds are combined, with a few scattered words neatly conjoined to Jain's rudimentary mantras on ""O, I Love You"". Producer Patrick Glynn deserves credit for creating just the right sense of intimacy by keeping the vocals high in the mix, often making it feel like she's right there in the room with you.</p></div>"|15057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15057-until-the-light-of-morning/|7.1|Nick Neyland

""People salute you. As you grow older, they no longer think of you as heroic. They see you as something else: selfish, foolish, or lost."" Yeah, he's singing in character-- Hank Champion, descendent of Texan miners--  but surely that line in the sand between youthful ideologue to struggling something-or-other has occurred to Smith. Especially lately: The San Fran renaissance man-- artist, author, and bandleader-- recently completed work on his most elaborate project yet, a handbuilt jukebox jammed with 100 songs written by Sonny and recorded with help from a coterie of the Bay Area's garage-pop movers and shakers.</p>
<p>Each tune is assigned a fake band name, each record its own custom sleeve with several groups even earning their own elaborate backstories; the mind reels at the scope of the project, the mastery of mixed media such an undertaking would require, the drive it'd take not to just say screw it and move onto something else. Here's this relatively unsung singer-songwriter crafting possibly the most complicated box set of all time, in an edition of one; brave, to be sure, but at least on paper, not too many degrees removed from foolish either. But Smith, as he did with his Sunsets' still-great <i>Tomorrow Is Alright</i> LP, makes it all seem too easy, and his affably eclectic jukebox-era songcraft and the formidable crew he's assembled for backup make <i>I Miss the Jams</i>-- the second, 10-song set culled from the original 100-- seem anything but foolhardy.</p>
<p>With all the project's extra-musical elements, Smith and company could've almost been forgiven for half-assing the songs themselves; standing in a room with that jukebox, punching buttons for Earth Girl Helen Brown or Loud Fast Fools, the occasional noise splatter or big dumb lark would seem almost inevitable. But the 10 tracks on <i>I Miss the Jams</i> would suggest that Smith put the tunes at least on par with all the trappings, offering up a genial set of retro-minded rave-ups recorded in warm, punchy mid-fi. Smith's sly wit and remarkably natural way with songcraft are very much in evidence here as they were on the Sunsets' LP, but the songs here are simpler and, accordingly, more direct; the bawdy ""I Wanna Do It"", featuring a brassy vocal from the Sandwitches' Heidi Alexander doesn't mince words, while ""Teen Age Thugs""-- its verses in Spanish, its chorus bored into your skull in English-- makes its point despite the potential language barrier. ""Broke Artist"" tells its tale of a skid row artist, his similarly hard-luck benefactor, and a run in on the wrong side of the tracks; Smith's best lyrics have a short-story quality about them anyway, and it's nice to see him finding yet another way to marry his many passions on wax.</p>
<p>Perhaps understandably, the tunes do occasionally feel a tad like genre exercises-- ""Ain't No Turnin Back"" skiffles, ""Back in the Day (I Can't Stand It)"" is straight British invasion R&amp;B-- but Smith's such an unflappably cool songwriter than even borrowed clothes fit him like a glove. Like <i>Tomorrow Is Alright</i>, <i>I Miss the Jams</i> is a remarkably blithe, laid-back work, the subtle charms of Smith's gently funny, sneakily subversive songs occasionally taking a listen or two to sort themselves out. But there's a durability there that belies the fairly easy reference-grabbing and the slightly shrugged-off attitude on display; Smith's fairly unshowy, trend-averse style may never win him the fanbase of some of his peppier, more hook-forward left coasters, but their clean lines and easy feel lends them a feeling of timelessness that seems like it ought to endure.</p>
<p>For all the romantic notions of creative solitude in ""Broke Artist"", Smith couldn't have made his big box happen without a good showing from the smoldering San Francisco indie rock scene, who come out in droves here. Ty Segall takes it down a notch or four on the surfy ""One Way Doomsday Trip to Nowhere"", Smith and the Fresh &amp; Onlys' Tim Cohen attempt to out-deadpan each other on the otherwise rollicking ""Time to Split"", and Kelley Stoltz fulfills his unspoken obligation to be on every San Fran record ever by appearing throughout. The spirit of community amongst this ragtag crew hasn't gone unremarked upon, but it's definitely in full force here; although it's certainly Smith's record at the core, it plays like a nice little overview of the San Francisco scene as it stands, their unusually fresh and forward-looking take on shuffly mod-pop. Through it all, Smith and company remain calm, totally uncowed by the task at hand. With friends like those willing to help flesh out songs like these, Smith's wild-eyed devotion to this absurdly laborious project makes all the sense in the world.</p></div>"|15067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15067-100-records-volume-ii-i-miss-the-jams/|7.6|Paul Thompson
