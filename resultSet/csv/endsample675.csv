It has to. There's no way to experience something outside of the familiar and not be affected, if only in the smallest way. Tinariwen come from a people whose history is travel. The Kel Tamashek (aka the Touareg) have inhabited the vast expanse of the middle Sahara for centuries, living nomadically in a place no one else much visited, never mind called home. The area today is split between Algeria, Libya, Niger, and Mali-- modern ideas about borders and nation states leave little room for wandering peoples, and so the last few decades in the region have seen intermittent violence and displacement as they've fought to maintain their culture and lifestyle in a world that isn't built to accommodate it.</p>
<p>Lately, the members of Tinariwen have done a lot of traveling of another sort: touring as an internationally successful rock band. It's hard to imagine any of them had any inkling they'd be performing an in-store show at Other Music in Manhattan when they formed the band in the camps over the border from Mali. At any rate, they've experienced a lot of the world outside the desert they grew up in, and it seems to have influenced the new direction of their latest album, <i>Imidiwan: Companions</i>. Where their last album, <i>Aman Iman: Water Is Life</i>, was urgent, rebellious, and wrapped up in the importance of Kel Tamashek identity, down to taking its title from the first half of a Tamashek proverb, this new one feels different in spite of only slight changes in overall sound. Recorded in the band's hometown of Tessalit in the mountains of Mali's deep-desert northeastern Kidal region, this is a celebration of a return to the desert and of the people who live there, a communal album with lots of big choral vocals and time set aside for breathtaking flights on the guitar.</p>
<p>And so the songs largely have a little less individual punch here-- the album instead invites you into a soundworld shaped by geography. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the haunting closer, ""Desert Wind"", a whisper of an instrumental that seems to consist of nothing but the movement of electric guitar strings by the breeze. Lyrically, the songs, sung in Tamashek, visit themes of liberation and cultural-historical pride, as well as <i>assuf</i>, an untranslatable word with implications of homesickness, loneliness, and sadness; it also refers to the nighttime world beyond the light of the campfire. ""Assuf Ag Assuf"" lies at the center of the record's odd second half, where the intensity level rises considerably. It's one of two songs to feature a strange, ethereal expansion of the band's signature guitar sound, the lead lines sliding, reverberant, and ghostly in support of the weathered vocals.</p>
<p>""Kel Tamashek"" is less spaced-out, building a propulsive song around a central drone that remains pensive all through, without ever exploding into the kind of dust storm guitar outbursts you get on ""Lulla"" or ""Ere Tasfata Adounia"". It's an even sharper contrast to the positively languid album opener, ""Imidiwan Afrik Temdam"", which is dominated by the chorus. That <i>Imidiwan</i> doesn't quite have the bracing crunch of its predecessor is no great criticism-- this album is the sound of a band growing musically as it adjusts to its new global platform. There is a unique magic to the sounds of the Sahara. <i>Imidiwan</i> captures that magic with skillful grace.</p></div>"|13549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13549-imidiwan-companions/|7.6|Joe Tangari

They mine a familiar sound, and that almost makes it more of an uphill battle for them to stand out from the rest of the pack; it certainly makes it harder to coast by on charm. And yet, that's exactly what they do here on their self-titled full-length debut. Don't look for a ton of gravitas: the Yolks write songs about being broke, being lonely, and-- no shit-- going on picnics. What you see is what you get here, but what you get is more than just competent: it's direct, unpretentious, and joyful. Their songs are instantly hummable, played with an offhand attitude informed by punk at what feels like half the tempo and with none of the posturing.</p>
<p>Opener ""Long Cold Lonely Night"" speeds past with the exuberance of joyriding teenagers in dilapidated cars. The song's simple lyrics have onomatopoeic buoyancy, added to by its quick downstrokes and walking basslines. Some of the band's early singles show up here, re-recorded but not losing any of their spontaneous delivery: ""I Do What I Do"" asserts individuality and bad habits in the face of clingy females, while ""Wandering"" is a simple number that dips into doo-wop for inspiration for backing vocals that are just as laid-back as the lead. The new songs show, comparatively, a bit more effort and angst, but not so much as to punctuate the records perfect lazy haze. ""Fade Away"" kicks up more dust with a far less cautious rhythm and strum and a more pleading melody, and there are hints of sweat in tracks like ""Hey Child"" or ""My Love is Yours (My Money's Mine)"", which (perhaps tellingly) is one of the few moments singer/guitarist Spencer Johnson's vocals rise above a low croon into a grittier and more insistent tone.</p>
<p>While the pleasures of the Yolks' debut are simple, the record is still savvy. The surf-rock nod ""Sir Charles"" leaves just as much room for a muted, almost jazzy organ as it does for the guitar twang, evoking more of a luau on a private island than an open beach party. ""Rambling"" is a languid country strum that sounds blown-out and tweaked from its recording to its copious bent notes. These tracks hint that they've got their ears open and are more versatile than they often let on, and that the consistent, straightforward sound of the rest of the record is all part of the plan. Alone, these two tracks add just enough diversity to a full-length album. But even with moments like these, <i>The Yolks</i> maintains its amiable slacker charm throughout. ""Jane"" even hits a downright naive, innocent note, asserting that the girl in question ""smells nice"" and wooing her with PBJ sandwiches. It's almost a perfect metaphor for the record: PBJ isn't making anyone's top-10 sandwiches for the year, but where would we be without it? This music can still win listeners over, and it's a style the Yolks were born to play.</p></div>"|13523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13523-the-yolks/|7.0|Jason Crock

As much as we loved the idea of Wayne Coyne producing a sci-fi flick in his backyard with hardware-store materials, the Lips' musical production became less frequent-- and less consistent-- during its making. 2006's scattershot <i>At War With the Mystics</i> tried to cut down on the lightness of their two previous landmark albums but was largely overwhelmed by cloying singles (""The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song"", ""Free Radicals"") that felt like little more than excuses to shoot off their confetti cannons. The trio's desire to produce crowd-pleasing spectacle-- whether on stage or on film-- had seemingly taken priority over their desire to be a band.</p>
<p>But when <i>Christmas on Mars</i> finally surfaced in late 2008, it came with a peace offering to fans longing for a return to the band's bizarro roots: a full-length soundtrack of unsettling instrumentals that conjured the film's icy desolation. Now, rather than close a chapter on this seven-year saga, the Flaming Lips have taken a dramatic left turn with their <i>Mystics</i> follow-up-- the double album <i>Embryonic</i> is the band's most audacious undertaking since 1997's <i>Zaireeka</i>. The sprawling 70-minute marathon ruminates on themes of madness, isolation, and hallucinogenic horror, translating them into an unrelentingly paranoid, static-soaked acid-rock epic. <i>Embryonic</i> actually feels like it was produced in one of <i>Christmas on Mars</i>' hermetic space-station labs, with squelching equipment that takes a few moments to warm up and frequent instructional studio chatter that gives the impression of a subject under observation.</p>
<p>There's a raw directness to <i>Embryonic</i> that's been largely absent from Lips records since the mid-90s. For the first time in years, they've made an album that actually sounds like a band playing live together in a small room. In light of <i>Mystics</i>' overly processed, grab-bag quality, the holistic, audio-vérité approach on display here is remarkable-- the record is extremely dense, initially overwhelming, but unusually rewarding upon repeat listens. Like the double-disc, high-concept rock epics of yore (think <i>Physical Graffiti</i> or <i>Bitches Brew</i>), it captures them at their most sprawling and ambitious, boldly pushing themselves towards more adventurous horizons.</p>
<p>Musically, too, <i>Embryonic</i> leans heavily on the Lips' formative 60s/70s psych-rock influence (like <i>In a Priest Driven Ambulance</i>'s ""Take Meta Mars"" before it, <i>Embryonic</i>'s formidable opener ""Convinced of the Hex"" grooves heavily on Can's ""Mushroom""), but never before has the band recorded an album so unwaveringly sinister, or so devoid of pop-song levity. (Hell, even <i>Zaireeka</i> had ""The Big Ol' Bug Is the New Baby Now"".) Wayne Coyne no longer assumes the role of the endearingly creaky, puppet-toting crooner. Instead, he's a world-weary fatalist describing scenes of environmental holocaust in a chillingly unaffected monotone on the rampaging ""See the Leaves"". Or he's a cult leader deviously summoning his minions on ""Sagittarius Silver Announcement"", before leading them to a fiery demise on the monstrous, stoner-metal onslaught of ""Worm Mountain"" (featuring fuzzbox-stomping assistance from MGMT). The atmosphere of dread reaches its fever pitch in the album's spellbinding seven-minute centerpiece ""Powerless"", where, over top a coolly ominous bass riff, Coyne's nervous verses yield to a Syd Barrett-on-Mandrax guitar freak out.</p>
<p>There are brief respites amid <i>Embryonic</i>'s thundering eruptions, but even these carry a calm-before-the-storm unease: On paper, ""I Can Be a Frog"" reads like another of Coyne's animal-populated nursery rhymes, but the foreboding orchestration and giggly background squawks (courtesy of Karen O) render it too creepy for kindergarten. And the vocoderized lullaby ""The Impulse"" serves only to make the screaming intro to strobe-lit freakout ""Silver Trembling Hands"" all the more startling. True to an album named <i>Embryonic</i>, there are tracks that aren't fully formed (namely, the drunken Bonham stumble of ""Your Bats"" or the free-psych splatter of ""Scorpio Swords""), but even in its slighter moments, <i>Embryonic</i> exhibits a renewed sense of fearless freakery for a band who so recently threatened to lapse into stagy routine.</p>
<p>""I wish I could go back, go back in time,"" Coyne sings on ""Evil"", <i>Embryonic</i>'s most conventionally Lips-ian ballad, but the nostalgic impulse is immediately undercut by the admission that ""no one really ever can."" Perhaps Coyne is anticipating the confused reactions of recent Lips converts expecting more life-affirming anthems along the lines of ""Do You Realize??"" or ""Race for the Prize"". But given the band's history, <i>Embryonic</i>'s sea change arrives right on time to herald a new Flaming Lips for a new decade. Back in 1990, <i>In a Priest Driven Ambulance</i> signaled the Lips' transformation from garage-punk misfits into a splendorous, kaleidoscopic rock outfit; 1999's <i>The Soft Bulletin</i> reconfigured them once again into a sophisticated, sincere symphonic-pop troupe bestowed with increasing commercial acclaim and street-naming ceremonies in their honor. We can only hope that, as we enter the 2010s, <i>Embryonic</i> portends yet another new phase for the Flaming Lips-- one that's equally as improbable and rewarding as the ones that have preceded it.</p></div>"|13522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13522-embryonic/|9.0|Stuart Berman

With songs about his bitterness toward his mother, and painfully self-hating lyrics like, ""Don't tell me it's alright, 'cause everything inside is wrong with me,"" <i>She's the Dutchess, He's the Duke</i> hurts so good. With exposed-nerve sentiments married to raw acoustic melodies, it is music made by a damaged man (and his partner-in-crime, the smoky-voiced Dutchess Kimberly Morrison). It was also one of the most underrated albums of the year.</p>
<p><i>Sunset/Sunrise</i> finds Lortz in a much different place. A new father, he wrote much of the collection while his wife was pregnant. Anger, doubt, and resentment about his past is now fear, anticipation, and even a little bit of hope for his future. It is not, however, an album of domestic bliss or comfortable complacency.</p>
<p>While <i>She's the Dutchess</i> matched style to substance, with minor-key Stones/Kinks grit and swagger to mirror the dark lyrics, <i>Sunset/Sunrise</i> finds the Seattle duo exploring murky, in-between places-- both musically and thematically. If a track has a slightly sunny energy or major-key twang, then its lyrics express sadness or, worse, icy ambivalence. ""Let It Die"" is the first song on the album to explicitly deal with impending fatherhood (""In the bed my woman lies sweetly/ With a love that I just can't see/ Inside there's a little child now/ With a heart and soul that's free""). It gallops like a cheerful sing-along, but following the description of his loving, pregnant wife is a chorus that intones how badly he wants to run away from her and the prison of domesticity. The only thing more devastating than what he's saying is how he's saying it-- set against a melody that should be a cozy, cascading love song.</p>
<p>Usually when a band expands upon its simple, lo-fi sound on a sophomore album, it comes off sounding bloated, a blatant attempt to ""mature."" But the Dutchess and the Duke use the new colors in their palette sparingly and to a satisfying effect. Though almost every song on their debut features nothing more than dueling guitars and perhaps a tambourine or kick drum, the best tracks on <i>Sunset/Sunrise</i> are studded with strings, pianos, and organs that add character to their simple melodies. Album closer ""The River"" feels like a hymn thanks to its unpretentious piano arpeggios and churchly harmonies, ""Hands"" is haunted by a ghostly organ that keens behind the hollow thump of the drum, and ""Scorpio""'s call-and-response vocals are highlighted by the imitative violin line.</p>
<p>While the album as a whole doesn't wallop the way <i>She's the Dutchess</i> does, its more spacious, ambiguous, and, yes, adult songs are intriguing and affecting. Repeated, attentive listens to this record will garner great reward. It's a collection for indie-rock Peter Pans, people troubled by family fissures or romantic longing, and anyone who got what they always wanted and then was surprised to find they didn't want it anymore. That basically includes most of us.</p></div>"|13542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13542-sunsetsunrise/|7.4|Rebecca Raber

""Joy Fantastic"" has to be the true over-the-top cartoon moment of the already wired debut album. Preceded by a silly skit featuring two kids whispering about escaping to a magic land, the track of sinewy, bulbous beats features vocalist Olivier Daysoul laying down some fantasyland pap that makes Fonzworth Bentley sound like a thug. He also deadpans ""You can swim the Minnetonka,"" dropping the last word like Dave Chappelle imitating the Purple One. An amusing aside on an overly precious track, it might also obliquely suggest where Mohawke is going with this electronic carnival.</p>
<p>He gets both richer and more restless with <i>Butter</i>, aiming to inject more soul into his skewered style while still fidgeting through pitched-up, Premier-inspired beats, tripped-up drum patterns, and shorted-out 8-bit melodies. Hudson Mohawke already has a track record of refracting hip-hop and R&amp;B through his own neon-colored prism. Between the re-imagined jams on the <i>Oops EP</i>, the <i>Polyfolk Dance</i> EP-- the latter named after a track by prog-rock violinist Jean-Luc Ponty-- and various singles and remixes, he's helped position his LuckyMe crew and the Wireblock label at the forefront of a multi-city axis of boundary-pushing producers. And new tracks like ""No One Could Ever"", which rolls out with dull snare taps and sped-up vocal snippets, would make fertile ground for a freestyle.</p>
<p><i>Butter </i>overflows with these kind of neon-tinted beats, almost tropical in the way they suggest warmth and sunshine (see ""Rising 5""), and deliriously happy. A teenage DMC champ, Mohawke made some initial forays into producing as a teenager by messing with the <i>Music 2000</i> program on his Playstation, and it's clear video game tones and quick-cuts form a large portion of his musical vocabulary. Melody lines aren't just bright, they're blinding, buoyant, and sometimes verge on child-like. So high they sound pitch-shifted, the tracks still manage an unsteady swagger and would fit in well with Alexander Nut's recent Rinse mix. ""FUSE"" glides between pitches, tweaked to massive effect despite a lack of bass. ""ZOo00OOm"" blends bleeps, waves of bass, and what sounds like a beat boxer with a facial tic. ""Shower Melody"" soars on a virtuostic, screaming guitar riff while ""Gluetooth"" slowly bumps, chipmunk vocal chirping over a steady low-end march. His collaborations with Dam-Funk, especially ""Tell Me What You Want From Me"", are a bit more slinky, but the overall sheen is hard to escape.</p>
<p>His wobbling, histrionic beats can also showcase his propensity for going over the top. Like a child on a sugar high, he dives into ideas-- short tracks like ""Twistclip Loop"" and ""3.30""-- and doesn't always follow through, taking multiple directions at once and occasionally dropping under-developed tracks, which flash and quickly fizzle without much resolution. While the album has been in the works for a while, <i>Butter </i>suggests he's moving at a rather frenetic pace. By the time the closer ""Black N Red"" rolls around, another bombast of tinny keyboards and chipmunk vocals, it's not contagious, it's overkill. Hudson can definitely do tweaked, but he has work to do before being transcendent.</p></div>"|13557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13557-butter/|6.7|Patrick Sisson

Most ""modern"" folk artists basically look like members of Tapes n' Tapes with better flannel. I suppose Devendra Banhart had his moment, but he was hardly one of the pretty people. Consider, though, Mi (Mira Romantschuk) and L'au (Laurent Leclère): a former Finnish fashion model (Mi) and a Frenchman who probably could've been (L'au) meet in Paris. They look gaunt, smoke cigarettes, and wear clothes that would probably look stupid on most of us. Two of their songs (""Philosopher"", ""Dance on My Skin"") have been used by Chanel in promotional materials. Not what's expected of a duo that records in cabins in Finland and hangs with Michael Gira, but <i>Good Morning Jokers</i>, their sophomore album for Borne Recordings, finds plenty of ways to subvert modern folk trends.</p>
<p>The fashion links above may be a bit tangential, but <i>Good Morning Jokers</i> invokes plenty of artists who are visually inclined: Scott Walker, Nico, Serge Gainsbourg. While never falling in with the mumbly, ill-bordered folk music that usually comes out of Finland (see the Fonal label, et al.), <i>Good Morning Jokers</i> also emboldens the sounds the group explored on their eponymous 2005 debut. The songs here are almost universally more adventurous, with Mi and L'au exploring brassy funeral marches (""Bingo""), sourpuss orchestral movements (""They're Coming""), and sanguine (literally) Fahey-lite fingerpicking (""Vampire"").</p>
<p>L'au in particular makes strides on <i>Good Morning Jokers</i>. No longer content to mumble alongside Mi, he shows off a reserved, expressive baritone. When he sings, slowly, on ""Vampire"", ""You're like my Lord/ Making me fly before taking my blood"" his voice contains hints of an accent that lends his delivery an internal energy.</p>
<p>Mi handles most of the creeping, floorboard-squeaking balladry. Neither as deliberate as Nico nor as unhinged as Cat Power, Mi's timbre seems to fall somewhere between the two. She ekes out some lines that, even on an album this art-serious, can feel lost and heavy. ""I will shine in the shadows of a snake/ Crawling through the windows of the pain,"" she sings during the chorus of ""Ten Kingdoms"", and not with enough velocity or character to allow you to ignore its overbearing nothingness.</p>
<p>That's a bit harsh, though, as throughout most of <i>Good Morning Jokers</i> she is tenderly contemplative and transfixed, like on ""Dance on My Skin"", possibly the year's slowest, quietest sex jam and the only one to talk about the moons of Jupiter (we need a Goldfrapp cover of this, pronto). On ""Bingo"" she is coy and dangerous before the horns steal her tune. Opening duet ""Up in the Building"" contains what might be this pair's most ascendant and plainsong melody.</p>
<p>The remainder of <i>Good Morning Jokers</i> contains slight variations on the duo's frosty, slowly developing folk music, but much of it (""The Pearl"", ""Clown"") is clear and loving. From its hideous cover art on down, the album is in some ways less charming than their self-titled; bolder melodic and compositional choices can erode familiarity and polarize listeners. But <i>Good Morning Jokers</i> feels like a more realized, heady take on the formula, seeping, however abstractly, with the style and fashion of its creators.</p></div>"|13514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13514-good-morning-jokers/|6.6|Andrew Gaerig

He spoke casually of physics but confessed he didn't understand everything he was talking about. (Comforting, because I didn't either.) He'd lose sight of his points and then pounce when they reappeared. His arguments weren't presented; they were splattered. One explanation for the scrambled approach is nerves, another is that it's just the way he thinks: playfully and with frequent time changes.</p>
<p>So I wasn't surprised when I first heard his music on 2008's <i>Dominique Leone</i>: prog and big-budget 1970s pop like Genesis or Electric Light Orchestra shoved into a bedroom studio and butchered. It was an exhilarating, restless record; it was also too much of a lot. This tension remains unresolved on <i>Abstract Expression</i>. There's no space left unstuffed and no groove left undisturbed. Leone's technical feats are stunning but his musical ones are scattershot. Songs like ""I'm the Police"" and ""Reasonable Snow"" balance his little fetishes-- for bright-eyed and schizoid humor, for unexpectedly dissonant chord changes that resolve without calling too much attention to themselves-- with legible melodies and choruses. Other times, the music is annoyingly complex and the performances are buffed so hard, all that's left is bone. At five minutes, a song as restless as ""Cover Yourself"" could use an intermission.</p>
<p>Abrupt time changes aren't necessarily a display of musical creativity in the same way that crying in public isn't necessarily a display of emotional honesty. They're extremes, which have as much to do with process as with product. And process usually affects the artist more than the audience-- the band that slaves in the studio every day for a year doesn't necessarily make a better album than the band that finishes one in an afternoon. Dominique Leone's music is complex, but sometimes it's complex in lieu of anything else, like he made an obstacle just to see if he could get around it-- and it's in those moments that <i>Abstract Expression</i> feels more like a private ritual or a personal reward  than something designed for an audience.</p>
<p>If it sounds like I'm coming down hard it's because I'm biased: I like that Leone is making things difficult for himself; I like that he's trying to draw a line from electro-pop to Todd Rundgren; I like the noise and the warped melodies and the feeling that I am lost in a brightly lit nightmare. Leone has worked with artists as disparate as R. Stevie Moore and Lindstrøm, and his writing has revealed a taste for musical idiosyncrasies from 70s-pop auteurs like Harry Nilsson to shadow-dwellers with hilarious names like Evil Moisture (whose then-new release was described by Leone, in his ""Out Music"" column on this site, as ""unsurprisingly fucking chaotic""). Point is, Dominique Leone is doing something unique and probably knows it. If anything, the only thing holding him back is that he doesn't relax and forget it more often.</p></div>"|13521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13521-abstract-expression/|6.7|Mike Powell

His reasoning was that, while Daft Punk mined a fairly narrow robot-funk aesthetic, Basement Jaxx emphasized human voices and cherry-picked sounds from a wide range of genres, which should logically open them up to a broader audience. The opposite was true. Whereas Daft Punk's M.O. was consistent and instantly understood, Basement Jaxx's style was constantly shifting and lacked a public face. The duo may have produced some of the most transcendentally brilliant dance music of the decade, but their eclectic taste and resistance to shtick may well have kept them from attaining widespread commercial success.</p>
<p>Basement Jaxx's aesthetic is easy to intuit, but difficult to describe. The word ""maximalist"" gets thrown around a lot, but that implies a musical overkill that belies Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe's talent for precisely calibrating their tracks for an over-the-top boldness. Their most memorable songs-- ""Where's Your Head At?"", ""Romeo"", ""Lucky Star"", ""Red Alert""-- are pummeling, relentless pleasure machines, and even when they dial it down for a melancholy tune like ""Take Me Back to Your House"", the duo still aim for an overwhelming effect. <i>Scars</i>, their fifth album, mostly falls into this latter category, and the results are mixed. Fans hoping for some good ol' Jaxx floor-fillers will almost certainly be disappointed, as only the first single ""Raindrops"" fully delivers the blissful catharsis of their best-known hits. The remainder of the album lingers in a sad-eyed funk even when the group is clearly shooting for fun, uptempo party tunes.</p>
<p>The most successful songs on <i>Scars</i> foreground the romantic anxiety that permeates the entire album. ""Feelings Gone"", featuring vocalist Sam Sparro, and ""My Turn"", a collaboration with Lightspeed Champion, both expand upon the lovesick sound of <i>Crazy Itch Radio</i>'s ""Take Me Back to Your House"", but jettison that song's quasi-country affectations and air of lonely desperation in favor of bright, buoyant arrangements similar to their more upbeat numbers. There is a potent sadness in these tracks, but any trace of self-pity is overshadowed by the way the vocal performances and the sound of the music come together as an open-hearted plea for affection and understanding. These two songs, along with the more mellow cuts ""A Possibility"" and ""Stay Close"", invert the expectations of Jaxx music, but play to the duo's strengths as composers. They may not overload the listener with euphoria, but the songs evoke a powerful emotional urgency, and that more than anything else defines Buxton and Ratcliffe's best work.</p>
<p>This is evidence of true artistic growth, but these successes share space on <i>Scars</i> with creative cul-de-sacs and uninspired genre exercises. The title track establishes the dark tone of the album, but it is almost too effective in the way it applies the Jaxx production aesthetic to conjure nausea-inducing anxiety. The Santigold showcase ""Saga"" falls into a similarly tense zone, but its overly dense ragga is saved by the bounciness of its catchy, taunting refrain. These are fine pieces of work, but they are more interesting than pleasurable. Nevertheless, when the two try for uncomplicated, pleasurable dance anthems, the results are rote and boring. ""What's a Girl Gotta Do?"" comes off like a second-rate retread of ""Do Your Thing"" from <i>Rooty</i>, the Yoko Ono collaboration ""Day of the Sunflowers (We March On)"" is energetic but joyless, and ""Twerk"", their team-up with Yo Majesty, hinges on an interpolation of ""Maniac"" from the <i>Flashdance</i> soundtrack that is far too cheap and easy for a group capable of so much better than kitschy nostalgia. As much as ""Feelings Gone"" and ""My Turn"" emote with genuine feeling, these songs seem distracted and unfocused, as if Buxton and Ratcliffe are going through the motions while their hearts and minds are somewhere else entirely.</p>
<p>All of this highlights perhaps the most crucial difference between Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx: While Daft Punk have not budged from an image established in the late 1990s, have released only three studio albums over the past 13 years, and have been mostly coasting on the success of a record from 2001, Basement Jaxx have never been still for long, and seem entirely unafraid of failure. They are constantly striving and experimenting, and when you're brave enough to take artistic risks, you're bound to turn out a dud here and there. All of Basement Jaxx's missteps to date have been noble in ambition and easily forgiven when you take into account that the same impulses that produce an awkward misfit of a song like ""She's No Good"" also yield the glorious house psychedelia of ""Raindrops"". Basement Jaxx may not have a strong brand identity, but their eagerness to toy with their formula and broaden the emotional range of their material is truly inspiring, and sometimes that matters much more than being popular and influential.</p></div>"|13519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13519-scars/|7.2|Matthew Perpetua

A group like Bad Lieutenant-- including Bernard  Sumner and latter-day Order member Phil Cunningham, with Stephen Morris  also on hand-- is always going to be compared, rather than considered.</p>
<p>In that sense-- and that sense only-- it's a good thing <i>Never Cry Another Tear</i> is such an unassuming  album: It's so breezily unambitious as to make the comparison feel  unfair, even when you can't avoid it.  It's all too common  for famous musicians to talk about how they made a record mostly for  their own amusement, but this album really does feel like that: relaxed,  not overthought, indeed hardly thought at all. Sumner, guitarist Cunningham, and third key member Jake Evans are happy to share your attention, even  if it means everything on the record is a minute too long to keep it.  ""Running Out of Luck"" starts purposefully and wanders happily away  into indifferent jangle-rock; ""Head Into Tomorrow"" switches wistful  guitar figures for draggy vocals from Evans. It's as if the musicians  are passing the spotlight between them like a game controller-- <i> Not sure how to do this bit. Fancy a go, mate?</i></p>
<p>With the electronics mostly set aside  for an album Sumner is making with Jacques Lu Cont, what Bad Lieutenant  have to offer is guitar rock. A specifically British strain of guitar  rock, in fact, with the rhythm section sidelined and the guitars themselves  often blending into a mid-range soup with keyboards and backing vocals.  It's been one of the staple sounds of UK music-- and specifically  Manchester music-- since Britpop-- and songs like ""Runaway""  and ""Shine Like the Sun"" are steeped in it. You can hear echoes  here of James, latter-day Oasis, and John Squire's Seahorses.</p>
<p>Grim names to invoke, and thankfully  Bad Lieutenant aren't fully in that leaden company-- Sumner's offhand  anti-charisma means the record never strains for effect when he's  singing, and there's at least one pretty idea in every song, even  if it usually gets drowned. The moody, Doves-ish ""Twist of Fate""  and the thoughtful ""Dynamo"", with its ""Won't Get Fooled Again""  keyboard, are the best and most coherent things here. ""Summer Days  on Holiday"" is more typical, though. It has Sumner's best performance  on the album, filled with enigmatic threat. But that gets lost as the  verses slide into one of those functionally soaring Britrock choruses,  and both sit badly with the record's most pointlessly pyrotechnic  guitar work. Underpinning it all is perhaps the thinnest drum sound  Stephen Morris has ever been near. Like most Bad Lieutenant tracks,  it never quite coheres.</p>
<p>Of all the former New Order members,  Sumner has (thanks to Electronic) the best track record outside the  band, but Bad Lieutenant are strolling along a familiar road here: like  previous breakaways Monaco or the Other Two, this record meanders through  a set of passable songs that ultimately decline to move or enthrall you.  It's another chance, I guess, to reflect on the curious workings of <i> gestalt</i> and the casual, inscrutable heartbreak these people could  create together. Sumner and Morris helped make some of the greatest  popular music of the late 20th century: They have nothing left  to prove, but does that have to be so obvious?</p></div>"|13563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13563-never-cry-another-tear/|4.1|Tom Ewing

Factory']|2009-10-09 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 18:57:23.961570|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1q7roj1qm8.1.6:0.1.0.$13555/=1$13555.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>So who the heck is Mark Mulcahy, and why does he have so many famous friends? I can't totally answer the second question, but for the first, go seek out ""Hey Sandy"" by Polaris, put it on, and come back. I'll wait.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ah, you're back. Did you go on a four-hour <i>Super Mario Kart</i> and Mountain Dew binge? Yeah, me too. ""Hey Sandy"" is better known as the theme song from ""The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete"", and Polaris was Mulcahy's band, a spin-off from his earlier and far more well-known band, Miracle Legion. Since the glory days of ""Pete &amp; Pete"", he's also put out a few micro-run solo records and has co-written a couple of musicals.</p>
<p>But that all still doesn't explain why<span> </span>Mulcahy's catalog would get the starpower treatment, and sadly, the reason lies less with his music than with his personal tragedy. A year ago, Mulcahy's wife Melissa died suddenly, leaving the singer-songwriter to raise twin three-year-old daughters alone. Thus, <i>Ciao My Shining Star</i> is both a tribute and a kind of collective patronage for Mulcahy's career, intended to give him the funds carry on as both single father and musician.</p>
<p>It's a touching story, lent extra power by just how many big names-- including Thom Yorke, Frank Black, Dinosaur Jr., Michael Stipe, the National-- turned out. Apparently, the response was so strong that this 21-track album accounts for just over half of the music received; 20 more tracks will be released digitally. But warm, fuzzy feelings aside, there's a musical problem at the core of <i>Ciao My Shining Star</i> that I hope I'm not fast-tracked to hell for having the audacity to mention-- the source material isn't really fertile ground for tribute.</p>
<p>Emotional ties to ""Pete &amp; Pete"" aside, Miracle Legion/Polaris/Mulcahy fit pretty squarely into an early 90s college-rock mold-- jangly guitars, nasal vocals-- that produced hundreds of similar-sounding bands. Try as I might, I can't really see what might set Mulcahy's music apart from the pack; some of the production on his last solo LP, <i>In Pursuit of Your Happiness</i>, pushes into the homemade psychedelia of an act like Sparklehorse, but the machinery under the hood of the songs themselves are largely generic-brand.</p>
<p>Still, that's not a dealbreaker for a tribute album-- Mulcahy's songs are a kind of blank coloring book for contributors to fill with their own set of Crayolas. And the start of <i>Ciao My Shining Star</i> offers a few examples of that approach working. Yorke's ""All For the Best"" has the same itchy, chattering sensations of the bulk of his solo work, but as he is forced to wrap his voice around lyrics that are far more direct and domestic than anything he'd write himself, Yorke (harmonizing with his brother Andy) sounds warmer than ever. The National definitively put their own stamp on ""Ashamed of the Story I Told"" with a rumbling cello and plenty of low piano notes, and Frank Black turns ""Bill Jocko"" into a desperate stomp that is heart-wrenching giving the album's backstory-- howling ""Why do I have to stay here?/ Why does she get to go?"" over a deranged organ.</p>
<p>But the majority of the record is given over to singer-songwriters covering a singer-songwriter, and adding all the creative touches you'd expect from somebody who performs under their own name. This stretch is split between people I've never heard of (Frank Turner, Chris Harford, David Berkeley) and people I thought had given up (Josh Rouse, Ben Kweller, Hayden). All do as little as possible with the source material; only Elvis Perkins' dashed-off but soulful ""She Watches Over Me"" and Fountains of Wayne's Chris Collingwood (who draws the catchy ""Cookie Jar"") impress.</p>
<p>So while <i>Ciao My Shining Star </i>is a sterling piece of charity, a post-millennial <i>Sweet Relief</i>, it's also a bit of a slog to sit through, unless you're a loyal regular at your local coffee shop's open mic night. By all means, drop 99 cents here and there to fill out your Radiohead and R.E.M. solo-project collections and throw a few more dollars to this good cause. But there's no need to subject yourself to 40 tracks and two hours of unexceptional covers in the process.</p></div>"|13555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13555-ciao-my-shining-star-the-songs-of-mark-mulcahy/|4.5|Rob Mitchum

Oliveri served as the band's sparkplug, counterbalancing Homme's melodic falsetto with his screeching hardcore vocals and adding a degree of batshit craziness to songs like ""Tension Head"" and ""Quick and to the Pointless"". Oliveri's absence would take its toll on Queens-- they haven't reached the same heights without him on subsequent records <i>Lullabies to Paralyze</i> and <i>Era Vulgaris</i>.</p>
<p>Since that time, Oliveri has played in a slew of bands including the Dwarves and L.A. hard-rock outfit the Knives and continued work on his long-running punk-metal project Mondo Generator, but has remained mostly out of the spotlight by comparison to his ex-bandmembers. (Even lesser known guitarist Dean Fertita has gone on to work with Jack White in the Dead Weather.) Now comes <i>Death Acoustic</i>-- as its title implies, a stripped-down solo album-- featuring a straightforward combination of Oliveri's gutter-punk howl and acoustic-guitar strumming. Despite these simple elements, the album features the same brutality and hostility as his contributions to Queens and other groups, and offers a bleak, sometimes frightening character portrait of Oliveri as an outcast not fit for normal society.</p>
<p><i>Death Acoustic</i> is a pretty strange record and there isn't much precedent for it beyond perhaps the outlaw country of singers such as Hank Williams and Waylon Jennings, men who sold the idea of themselves as kinds of modern-day desperados. The difference, I suppose, is that Oliveri seems to actually <i>be</i> that character in real life, and when he delivers lines like, ""I use crystal methane by the boatload/ I live off straight booze, I just don't fucking care,"" in the G.G. Allin cover ""Outlaw Scumfuc"", you don't really question the validity of that statement for a second. In one sense these songs are effective, as the listener gets some insight into Oliveri's persona, but the material is so violent and misogynistic it makes it difficult to find a way in.</p>
<p>But beyond the lyrical content are songs with real structure and melody that reinforce what made Oliveri an integral part of Queens in the first place. His guitar playing is tight and forceful throughout, and his cover of the Misfits classic ""Hybrid Moments"" is tender and even pretty, with double-tracked vocals that add nuance to the song's simple blitzkrieg bop. Even the stripped-down rendition of ""Gonna Leave You"" from <i>Songs for the Deaf</i> included here serves as a reminder of what a potent combination he and Homme were back in the day. It's enough to make you long for a Queens reunion, but it's darn-near impossible to imagine Homme listening to <i>Death Acoustic</i> and hearing the sentiments of a changed man.</p></div>"|13567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13567-death-acoustic/|3.5|Joe Colly

You'll hear every kind of appraisal of their synth-soaked music: ""too hipster,"" ""too coked-out,"" ""too ironic,"" even ""too fratty."" On the contrary, they're mostly just big nerds, gobbling old-school records with aplomb. Hell, band member and hip-hop devotee Dave 1's day job is in academia, teaching French to Columbia undergrads. The duo, originating from Montreal, obsessively charts a constellation of synthesizer-fueled funk and dance-pop out of the 1980s, with old-school hip-hop serving as a guiding compass. Sure, they aren't especially innovative, and their associations with Vice Records and Brooklyn might falsely indicate that their 80s night hokum is all a big put-on.</p>
<p>Chromeo's entry into !K7's <i>DJ-Kicks</i>, the 30th in the storied mixtape series, seems acutely aware of the distinction. Filled with early-80s funk and R&amp;B-infused pop (including bygone classics like Cheri's ""Murphy's Law"" and Val Young's Rick James produced ""Seduction""), the disc serves as a legend for Dave 1 and bandmate P-Thugg's musical evolution. At the same time, it captures the nexus in funk, pop, and synthesizer-based music that coalesced in the early 1980s around the time of <i>Thriller</i>. Michael Jackson, unsurprisingly, doesn't make an appearance on the disc, but his 80s work acts like a set of parentheses around the record, contextualizing the late-70s blue-eyed disco of Leo Sayer with the late-term vocoder stylings of quirky Quebecers Soupir. Oh, and in keeping with <i>DJ-Kicks</i> tradition, Chromeo cover the Eagles.</p>
<p>Like Hot Chip's recent, superior entry in the series, Dave 1 and P-Thugg craft the mix as a personal biography. But where Hot Chip seamlessly weave incongruity into a glittering tapestry of affectations, Chromeo downplay the pillow-talk wit that marks their original works. Any indication of cheeky sexuality demonstrated in ""Tenderoni"" or ""Bonafied Lovin'"" is rolled back to the come-hitherisms laid bare in the freshly post-Sexual Revolution 70s. As a result, <i>DJ-Kicks</i> almost academically picks apart enlightening standouts from the era of the duo's pop awakening, but unlike the group's best work, the mix tongue-ties the group's collegial motor-mouth.</p>
<p>The best indication of the boys' amateurish charm is unfortunately found in how they've mixed their picks: Let's just say Chromeo aren't gonna win any professional DJ awards. You could thus take the skeptic's route and argue that the disc only reinforces the duo's ineffectual irony: an awkwardly paced set of also-rans from the rough-and-tumble end of the disco era. However, these ""also-rans"" reflect a poorly marked through-way in the development of modern pop music, re-affirming Chromeo as quirky but devoted pathfinders. The only thing that seems clear is that you can't separate Chromeo from their early-80s record bins, so you pretty much gotta take it or leave it.</p></div>"|13561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13561-dj-kicks/|6.5|Mike Orme

But really, there's no one better qualified for the job of translating Maurice Sendak's bedtime-story classic into song. Like <i>Wild Things</i>' young protagonist Max, Karen understands the power of imagination in transforming your mundane surroundings into something spectacular; witness the former Oberlin College student trying to make her way as a folksinger in Unitard, before refashioning herself into the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' beer-spitting, mascara-smeared mouthpiece. Unlike most lead singers with a reputation for physically extreme performances, Karen O's onstage behavior is never really subjected to psychoanalytic interpretation, nor should it be: That giddy, childlike smile she routinely flashes lets us in on the make-believe fantasy of it all, reminding us once again that rock'n'roll is really just the grown-up version of building a fort or playing with dolls.</p>
<p>So for Karen O, <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> isn't just a soundtrack gig; it's a vessel through which she can again redraft her surroundings. This time, she plays the head mistress of a freak-folk dream-team (christened the Kids) that includes fellow Yeah Yeah Yeahs Nick Zinner, Brian Chase, and Imaad Wasif; Deerhunter's Bradford Cox; Aaron Hemphill of Liars; and Dean Fertita and Jack Lawrence of the Dead Weather. Strangely, the <i>Wild Things</i> trailer that's been burning up YouTube for the past month features not a note of music from this soundtrack album, instead luring us into the movie's magic animal kingdom through the choral grandeur of Arcade Fire's ""Wake Up"". But that track provides a cue for what Karen O and her Kids are aiming for here: a balance of the folky and fantastical, with immediate, all-together-now hooks designed for maximal campfire communalism.</p>
<p>Children's music, in other words-- though, barring the forced simplicity of lead single ""All Is Love"" (presented in a simple sing-along and a more dramatic, <i>Funeral</i>-ready form), it's music that's direct and participatory enough to engage the kids without aggressively pandering to them; it won't be hard to get your young'un to shout along to the gleeful, wordless hollers on ""Rumpus"", but the forceful stomps on which they're delivered serves to remind us that, for all their cheek-pinching cuteness, kids can be nasty, destructive little buggers. While the song titles reference the movie's events and characters, the lyrics rarely do; strip away the requisite film-dialogue snippets, and this set could've been a bonus acoustic companion disc packaged with <i>It's Blitz!</i>. In a sense, this soundtrack serves a similar function for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs as the ""MTV Unplugged"" series did for grunge acts in the mid-90s-- an opportunity to strip down, but also get more elaborate and pile on the vibes, woodwinds, and other acoustic textures.</p>
<p>However, while the spell-it-out chant ""Capsize"" and the dust-up jam ""Animal"" tap into the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' feral energy, they ultimately feel like alternate, restrained versions of songs that would sound more effective and natural in amplified form. And, inevitably, there are a handful of incidental acoustic instrumentals that probably sound better when paired with Jonze's widescreen imagery. But the <i>Wild Things</i> soundtrack boasts enough illuminating, atypical turns from Karen O that make it worth experiencing independent of its source. The languorous lullaby ""Hideaway"" may be the least kid-friendly song here-- both in its strung-out, hazy-headed performance and my-baby's-gone subject matter-- but is a marvel nonetheless, a come-down sequel to ""Maps"" that the broken-hearted can comfort themselves with after the tears have dried. And it's no discredit to Karen's efforts to say that the soundtrack's most affecting moment is its lone cover-- for a film concerned with the complicated, conflicted relationship between childish whimsy and the real world, there's no better representative than Daniel Johnston, whose beautifully bruised ballad ""Worried Shoes"" is given a lovely, touching treatment by Karen. Like Johnston, Karen O has used music to access a fantasy world more exciting than the everyday one. The former's eccentricities put him in a mental hospital; the latter's got her on magazine covers. But the appearance of ""Worried Shoes"" on this soundtrack underscores the fact that, while our wildest fantasies are uniquely personal, the insecurities that inspire them are universal.</p></div>"|13550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13550-where-the-wild-things-are-ost/|6.8|Stuart Berman

Name, sound, rhyme style, lyrical content, release sleeve iconography: Anti-Pop were stylized (by the press as much as by themselves) as a fuck-you, a caustic riposte to a genre that had apparently taken every wrong turn possible in the 1990s. They likely give as much of a shit about how they ""fit in"" with rap in 2009 as they do about concepts like ""limited appeal.""</p>
<p>Which is not to say the group doesn't have enough history behind them to be assessed on their own terms. They've gone from straight-up alienating to a somewhat reconciliatory place within the hip-hop nation. For an act usually classed with the late-90s mini-boom in indie-rap futurism, Anti-Pop's earliest 12""s sounded as if they were made with equipment as old as the printing press. A move to Warp for 2002's <i>Arrythmia</i> added a fresh coat of accessibility to Anti-Pop's antagonistic minimalism.</p>
<p><i>Fluorescent Black--</i> their first non-collaborative album in seven years-- sounds like Anti-Pop spent their time away coming to grips with the implied-but-never-fully-embraced pleasure principle of <i>Arrythmia</i> via side projects and solo albums. The foursome's name only occasionally suits the music here, unless you take branding into consideration. <i>Fluorescent Black</i> won't blow up at a time when Rick Ross deigning to sound interested on his own album is considered a major step forward among hip-hop critics, but here Anti-Pop take a less partisan approach to fun.</p>
<p>And so since we're talking party music: ""NY to Tokyo""-- which sounds stitched from 21st-century De La Soul and Men At Work's melody library-- is <i>chipper</i>, about the last adjective I ever expected to use to describe an Anti-Pop record. And while Beans remains the Anti-Pop member you could best sell to rap fans who consider it music rather than some outlaw adjunct to poetry, even M. Sayyid and High Priest sound loosened up across the album, slowing down, using crowd-pleasing pacing, more willing to meet an audience raised on ""Crank Dat""-grade rhymes halfway.</p>
<p>""Goofy"": there's another word you'd be more likely to slap on Soulja Boy than Anti-Pop. Ditto ""playful."" And yet here's ""Born Electric"", with a hammy piano intro and ludicrously straight-faced crooning, managing to evoke Journey, Derrick May, and Vanessa Carlton within its first minute. I'm not even sure if Mike Ladd at his most Infections/Majesticons promiscuous would put Detroit pads and AOR cheese-pomp in the same track, let alone as its appetizer. <i>Fluorescent Black</i>'s backing tracks, in all their mutant techno overbrightness and zig-zagging detail, re-expand the indie hip-hop palette. Not always to the good, mind you. Is ""The Solution"" a Kanye/T-Pain robo-voice tribute or parody? Or just a lukewarm trend jack? So sometimes they may be winking too hard to sell certain songs as anything other than well-made gags-- Anti-Pop's button-pushing still makes a nice break from all the posthumous J Dilla fellatio going around.</p>
<p>All this lightening up is probably good for the soul, but what of the Anti-Pop refuseniks first fell in love with? Sometimes it crops up in unexpected ways. I appreciate anyone with the balls to scatter fans and foes alike with an album-opening blast of fugly hair metal. But my favorite track here might be the shortest and most ""traditionally Anti-Pop."" Lasting 1:30, its foul synth lurch like real-deal Rotterdam rottenness, Beans rips through ""Dragunov"" without pause, hook for cover, or cop to, well, pop. Music stripped to blunt-rhythm-and-nothing-but, the rap an excuse to leave fans breathless over skills they don't possess, ""Dragunov"" is hip-hop as old west line-in-sand at high noon, half-steppers left outside to wonder what the fuss is about.</p>
<p>These go-hard-or-go-home tracks are still sprinkled across <i>Fluorescent Black</i>-- dizzying first single ""Capricorn One""; ""End Game"", a near-arrhythmic duel between gunshot-terse rhyme fragments and the beatbox it sounds like they're slowly killing; ""Timpani""'s (yes, them again) Neubauten tribalism and pervy Martin Denny jungle howls. But those who've been along for the 10-plus year ride may be looking for more of them. No one could stay as intractable as early Anti-Pop forever-- who would want to, except maybe straight-up horse-corpse-beating nihilists?-- but this sort of delight in scrapping is still what APC do best. The idea of an Anti-Pop greatest hits may be anathema-- at least philosophically-- but the moments when they push the genre's boundaries, rather than just fan expectations, are the parts of the group's catalog that will endure.</p></div>"|13559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13559-fluorescent-black/|7.0|Jess Harvell

But Vile differs significantly in style from these other acts, with a sound that draws heavily on the road-weary classic rock and folk of Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and even Tom Petty, but is constructed with the lo-fi bedroom-recording techniques of someone like Ariel Pink. His two albums released in the last year (<i>Constant Hitmaker</i> and <i>God Is Saying This to You</i>) felt comfortable and well-worn like an old pair of jeans and produced a summer jam last season with the very catchy ""Freeway"".</p>
<p>But with an increased profile, the stakes are a bit higher for <i>Childish Prodigy</i>, his first Matador release and a record that offers some noticeable differences in sound and approach from his previous two. About half of the songs here are recorded in the same manner as before-- Vile on his own-- but for the remaining tracks he's brought in his touring band, the Violators, to flesh them out with additional instrumentation, creating some more depth and balance. The other key distinction is that Vile has opted for a much cleaner sound this time around, mostly doing away with the scuzz coating of past jams (though traces of distortion still remain here and there) and, as a result, <i>Childish Prodigy</i> feels more straightforward, perhaps even more professional in certain ways.</p>
<p>While I wouldn't criticize anyone for wanting to work outside the confines of lo-fi, it's not always the best look for Vile, as the added sheen draws away some of the charm of his earlier work. Regardless, he displays the same unique ability to tap into the feeling of classic rock-- the familar, comforting quality of that music embedded in anyone who grew up with a radio-- and the best songs here, most of which come during the record's stronger front half, play off that with a punk spirit. Opener ""Hunchback"" invites the full band in for some swampy stoner-rock boogie while the janglier, almost country-western ""Overnite Religion"" locks down a solid, melodic groove. Others, like ""Blackberry Song"", succeed with simple strumminess, but eventually the record begins to veer off course around the midway point.</p>
<p>One gets the sense that Vile is a prolific songwriter, able to knock out a bunch of tracks in one sitting, and almost all of <i>Childish Prodigy</i> has an on-the-fly nature to it, almost as if he's making the tracks up as he goes along. Sometimes that's impressive, like on the repetitive krautrock-arranged ""Freak Train"", but there's an amorphous quality to these songs that can also make for a difficult listen. Vile lets his guitar and vocals ramble throughout tracks, usually without breaking for a chorus or momentum shift, and lesser material like ""Heart Attack"" and ""Amplifier"" suffers, feeling meandering and structureless. This imbalance feels even more evident when he offers up a song like ""He's Alright"", with its acoustic guitar and pedal steel flourishes, that works great for its directness. Vile certainly has the talent and ability to churn out tunes, and with a little focus and editing his best batch is most likely ahead of him.</p></div>"|13535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13535-childish-prodigy/|6.3|Joe Colly

Three albums deep into the Boston Spaceships and the prolific songwriter is on a tear to rival a few of his best-ever runs. One wonders if the nascent lo-fi revival has lit a fire under the dude after being relegated for much of this decade to the lower rungs of indie favor. Last fall's first Spaceships touchdown <i>Brown Submarine</i> was good, this spring's<i> Planets Are Blasted</i> was great, and this summer's fine <i>Elephant Jokes</i> seemed imbued with an energy leftover from the obviously fruitful Spaceships sessions. Now, in <i>Zero to 99</i>, we've yet another winner.</p>
<p><i>Zero to 99</i> starts with ""Pluto the Skate"", a squelchy GBV rarity old enough to be bar mitzvahed. Pollard's long dipped into his vast back catalog for new releases, but ""Pluto"" further illustrates just what a good thing Bob's got going in fellow Spaceships Chris Slusarenko and John Moen. Slusarenko and Moen seem to know just what Pollard needs, and their efforts whittle down some of his eccentricities and aversions to editing. The pre-Spaceships ""Pluto"", for example, is skeletal, sludgy, decidedly lo-fi, and little more than a sketch; the one on <i>Zero to 99</i> trades analog hiss for a juicier Steve Albini-esque squirm, doubling the volume and intensifying the central squish into the gnarled metal of a car crash. To date, the Spaceships have largely played up Pollard's fondness for chunky riff-pop to fine effect; it's nice to hear them going at a weird one from back when, and nicer still to hear them pull it off.</p>
<p>That notwithstanding, <i>Zero to 99</i> is by and large a power-pop record in the vein of its two predecessor: catchy-as-hell cracklers peppered with form-fitting arrangements and an emphasis on Pollard's impressive pipes. What separates the Spaceships songs from much of Pollard's previous work is the tunes feel fully formed; running times hang out around the three-minute mark, verses bleed into choruses and back into verses, and there's a distinct feeling between one track and the next often lacking in Pollard's more sketchbook-like records. Pollard has run into trouble when he veers towards more conventional song structures-- we might call this ""doing the collapse""-- but there's a shapely quality to the Spaceships' melodies that never belies their quirk. That's as true as ever on <i>Zero to 99</i>, particularly in its first five tunes; after ""Pluto"", set highlight ""How Wrong You Are"" feels like a pile of hooks, the sturdy ""Radical Amazement"" builds to a fine little point, thrashabout ""Found Obstruction Rock N' Rolls"" is simple but effective, and ballad ""Question Girl All Right"" is puzzlingly affecting.</p>
<p>Things get a tad messier around <i>Zero</i>'s midsection; despite an assist from R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, ""Let It Rest for a Little While"" doesn't do much to distinguish itself until Bob takes the chorus from a whisper to a scream, ""Psycho Is a Bad Boy"" seems to favor attitude over aptitude and underutilizes its horn stabs, ""Godless"" goes nowhere (although to its credit, it gets there quick), and ""Meddle"" thuds along unremarkably. <i>Zero</i> picks up again with the gallant ""Go Inside"", peaks anew around ""Exploding Anthills"" (the chorus, after all, is ""I've been drinking,"" a Pollardian statement to rival any other), and finishes strong on the back of the bitter ""The Comedian"" and the short, sweet ""A Good Circuitry Soldier"".</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm writing this about Robert effing Pollard, but if anything, consistency proves <i>Zero to 99</i>'s greatest flaw.<i> Brown Submarine</i> and <i>Planets Are Blasted</i> took more risks and accordingly felt more rewarding; beyond ""Pluto"", <i>Zero</i>'s not exactly a bushwhacker, and while the songs are by and large strong and the performances uniformly top-notch, there's a slight whiff of sameyness to the proceedings here that could stand just a little shaking up. If you've heard the last couple of Spaceships records-- and you oughta-- you'll find <i>Zero to 99</i> pleasant but not particularly surprising, and even the high points don't tower quite like those of its predecessors. Still, weakest Spaceships LP though it may be, as a Pollard-related record in the aughts, <i>Zero to 99 </i>stands pretty tall.</p></div>"|13554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13554-zero-to-99/|6.8|Paul Thompson

It's not totally without hope, but it is the weary sound of real life pressing down from all sides, unfiltered through the usual irony and dramatic stylistic flourishes. It's often not exactly fun, either, and while Germano may rue the comparison, it's hard to jibe her work as a solo artist with the image of her fiddling away exuberantly in John Mellencamp's ""Paper in Fire"" video.</p>
<p>Still, that was a lifetime ago, and since then Germano has come to occupy her own little niche. No surprise that the clouds don't part on <i>Magic Neighbor</i>, Germano's eighth record, or that the woozy gloom hasn't made way for sunbeams and rainbows. Even so, some of the gauze has lifted, especially compared to Germano's last couple of releases. With her piano and vocals at the fore, Germano finds plenty of room to toy with the arrangements, filling the empty corners of each song with small but sympathetic sonic details and a warmth and playfulness that she's not always transmitted from her occasionally spectral remove.</p>
<p>""Marypan"", an instrumental, begins like an overture, its questioning melody the perfect introduction to Germano's warped but not unwelcoming world. ""To the Mighty One"" features Germano teetering between childlike wonder and grown-up melancholy, the tonal unease enhanced by wobbling organ, piano, and what sound like outer space effects beamed in from the margins of the mix. ""Simple"" continues this exploration of contrast, its almost bluesy beginning giving way with little warning to a sprightly carnival waltz. Following ""Kitty Train"", another wistfully evocative instrumental interlude, ""The Prince of Plati"" resumes the bittersweet dance of innocence and experience, with Germano occupying a tough to pin down (but no less effective) emotional ambivalence summed up by the deceptively paradoxical line ""You seem so unhappy; I can't take that today."" Which leaves Germano feeling... where? Up? Down? It's unclear, but it's intriguing, as is Germano's decision to bury her already mumbled, muffled, and eventually manipulated mantra-like vocals in ""Suli-mon"" until she's just another layered exotic instrument.</p>
<p>Things are more clear on ""Snow"", where what could be Germano's feet pumping at the pedals of her piano comes across like a distant heartbeat, and Germano herself sounds almost like she's singing her near-whispered vocals right into your ear. Elsewhere, the swirling Omnichord of ""Painting the Doors"", with its surreal lyrics, may be no less strange and mysterious than the purr of a cat, but they're just as inexplicably comforting. This occasionally awkward intersection of intimacy and elusiveness pervades the disc, just as it pervades Germano's other high-wire-act works, but this time the end effect is oddly inviting. It's almost as if we're being allowed a glimpse into a blurry movie flickering away in Germano's head, projected sans subtitles and its plot obscured, yet somehow no less affecting for it.</p></div>"|13515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13515-magic-neighbor/|7.3|Joshua Klein

The source material comes from Stevens' second album, <i>Enjoy Your Rabbit</i>, a set of glitchy, playful electronic miniatures based on the Chinese zodiac cycle that bore zero resemblance to the orchestral folk-pop for which he would become famous. Taking a page from Bang on a Can All-Stars' reworking of Brian Eno's <i>Music for Airports</i> and contemporary classical ensemble Alarm Will Sound's transcriptions of Aphex Twin, the string quartet Osso has hired a phalanx of New York's hippest young composers to recast these works as a surprisingly full-bodied and thoughtful series of picaresques. The results show gratifyingly little of the shallowness and amateurism that sometimes infects ventures beginning in rock and crossing over into the classical realm.</p>
<p>The New York composers Osso has enlisted-- Nico Muhly, Gabriel Kahane, Michael Atkinson, Olivier Manchon, Rob Moose, and Maxim Moston-- display real ingenuity in transcribing and setting these pieces for traditional string quartet. Osso's transcribers have risen gamely to the challenge of rendering glitchy electronic music for stringed instruments, seeming to treat it almost like a dare-- or an opportunity to remind the world that you don't need computers or amplification to make all those funny noises. In this spirit, they incorporate as many odd instrumental textures they can come up with, scratching and plunking away with abandon, and cycling neatly through a catalog's worth of 20th-century chamber music influences in the process.  The lurching, grotesque dance rhythms on ""Year of the Ox"" summon Bartók's darker interpretations of Hungarian folk tunes: On ""Year of the Sheep"", an uneasy wash of unresolved chords that recalls Charles Ives' ""Three Places in New England"" settles like mist while someone makes clicking noises with their mouth.  Echoes of Debussy's String Quartet No. 1 pop up everywhere. The title track sounds like Ravel's String Quartet in F as played by slightly overzealous high schoolers.</p>
<p>Not that you have to know anything about classical music to enjoy <i>Run Rabbit Run</i>. The Easter Egg hunt is a fun and absorbing game for classical nerds, but the album works just fine without it. Osso play with a rich, gorgeous tone and a wonderfully alert dynamic, switching effortlessly between beautiful string passages and gnarlier sound effects. ""Year of the Snake"" opens with an expansive, long-limbed string melody (echoes of Copland), but less than a minute in, a cellist digs lustily into his C string until it groans and scrunches in protest, the pitch warping like a sun-damaged cassette. From there, we get a round-robin of creepy harmonics, a triumphant theme that feels appropriate for a royal court, and some scurrying string scratches redolent of things living in your floorboards. It's a pleasantly dizzying tour and it all takes place in five minutes.</p>
<p>It's hard to know what Sufjan fanatics, who have been waiting four years now for a proper full-length follow-up to <i>Illinois</i>, will make of this one-off, but <i>Run Rabbit Run</i> serves as a welcome reminder that his curious, try-anything spirit is part of what got our attention in the first place. It also functions nicely as a palette cleanser to help prepare for the deluge of Sufjan-related activities looming on the horizon: the multimedia box-set release of his BQE suite and an ambient instrumental album recorded with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, and Bryce Dessner of the National. The excellence of <i>Run Rabbit Run</i> reassures that whatever seemingly dubious, over-ambitious, or unlikely project Sufjan tackles next, it will probably prove worthy of our attention.</p></div>"|13548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13548-run-rabbit-run/|7.7|Jayson Greene

Ghost, after all, has traveled this ground before. On his debut album <i>Ironman</i>, he enlisted Mary J. Blige for ""All That I Got Is You"", a gut-wrenching memoir of a childhood spent picking roaches out the cereal box. And on <i>The</i> <i>Pretty Toney Album</i> nugget ""Holla"", he straight-up rapped over an entire sweaty Delfonics oldie, his urgent yowl thrillingly banging against the song's weeping strings and punchdrunk guitars. Ghost understands how soul music works, and many of his own best records strive for transcendence as hard as any old Al Green jam. If he'd used either of those tracks as the basis for <i>The Wizard of Poetry</i>, we could have a classic on our hands.</p>
<p>But you review the album you got, not the album you wanted. Rather than either of those tracks, Ghost has built his R&amp;B experiment, understandably enough, around the only song of his to get significant New York radio burn in recent years: The Ne-Yo collaboration ""Back Like That"", the sole Hot 97 concession on the otherwise hard-as-fuck <i>Fishscale</i>. (The Kanye-assisted remix shows up here as a bonus track even though it was already on <i>More Fish</i> three years ago.) ""Back Like That"" wasn't a bad song-- far from it-- but it's tough to imagine how Ghost thought he could make an album full of that, especially when he didn't land a single guest singer anywhere near as talented as Ne-Yo.</p>
<p>In fact, it's tough to imagine how <i>The Wizard of Poetry</i> came into existence in the first place. If it's a A&amp;R-driven commercial Hail Mary, then how did the Def Jam authorities allow Ghost to get away with ""Stapleton Sex"", the squirmiest fuck jam in recent memory? ""Stapleton Sex"", which Ghost hilariously alleges he wrote for Natalie Portman, starts out with ""My face is wet, got a hair on my tongue,"" and only gets more greasily specific from there. (""This ain't no R&amp;B dick,"" he helpfully points out.) But if the whole album is Ghost's baby, then why is he paired up with scrub-ass R&amp;B new jacks like Lloyd and Ron Brownz? I promise you, Ghost doesn't bang any Lloyd CDs in his car.</p>
<p>As a writer, though, Ghost remains fascinating and contradictory. Check, for instance, opening track ""Not Your Average Girl"", where he builds his perfect woman (she should be on the couch reading a book and biting a pen when she gets home, but also shoot home invaders, which seems like a tall order) before tossing all that to the side on the last verse: ""We run trains on them bitches, never ice they arms."" Or ""Do Over"", where he starts out hangdog, apologizing for every form of infidelity before revealing that he's on a bus to prison, apologizing for <i>that</i>, too, and signing off with this: ""Thanks for your patience. You find a man. I hope he's true.""</p>
<p>Even the halfassed songs are filled with enormously likable turns of phrase, like when Ghost interrupts a story mid-sentence to refer to himself as a ""prestigious gentleman."" So many great little verbal moments here: ""The smell of her fragrance baffled my nostrils,"" ""My dick is hard as a callus,"" ""I pull out like a tooth in the back, it's rotten."" A totally sincere pickup line: ""I would love to have a thing like you on the team."" Another: ""I love it like that, stretchmark fat."" And Ghost delivers all this stuff straight-faced; he doesn't <i>do</i> punchlines. Even when he's trying to be as straightforward as possible, his mind works in fascinating ways. You just have to wade through swamps of dreck to find those brilliant little moments.</p>
<p><i>The Wizard of Poetry</i> has exactly one indispensable moment: the weirdly gripping story-song ""Guest House"", where Ghost bugs out looking for his girlfriend before finding her banging the cable guy, played by a titanically goofy Fabolous. Ghost's response: ""Snatched his covers/ Had them looking like the black Adam and Eve, two sinful lovers."" ""Guest House"" comes packed with the same plot twists and telling details and a breathless crime narrative like ""Shakey Dog"", but it uses them in the service of, basically, a soap opera, or a ""Trapped in the Closet"" chapter. It works in a way that almost nothing else here completely manages.</p></div>"|13537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13537-ghostdini-the-wizard-of-poetry-in-emerald-city/|5.1|Tom Breihan

A follow-up to the band's 2000 singles collection, <i>Suburban Light</i>-- so ingratiating and familiar it felt like the distillation of some heartsick indie-pop ideal-- seemed less impossible than superfluous. When something feels perfect, you don't necessarily want want xeroxes, however much you may think you want more in your life. Yet here we are, as the first decade of the new millennium slumps to an ignoble close, with the fourth Clientele album. (Fifth, if you count <i>Suburban Light</i>.) And thankfully the band never really did attempt to reconjure the magic of those early singles, perhaps realizing that leaning on the same reverb-blurry signature would have dimmed the original's charm. What made the Clientele special proved surprisingly durable across multiple releases, fidelity upgrades, and songwriting shifts.</p>
<p>That special something at first felt impossible to convey. Atmosphere. ""Vibe."" Put on a Clientele record and you're entering a space, one crafted as much through sound as lyrical associations, which tend toward the kind of quasi-cinematic string-pulling that makes for the band's own brand of enjoyable cliché. It's lonely without tipping into alienation. It's in tune with the power of memory without being deadened by generic nostalgia. It's someplace where changes in the weather can leave people dumbstruck. And if the music itself were a hair more melodramatic, its wistfulness would probably be unbearable. But the band's restraint, skirting emotional didacticism while still providing room for listeners' own specific states, appeals to humanity's more evanescent (and maybe pop-resistant) feelings. If you're never going to hear unfettered joy on a Clientele record, they're never woe-is-me slogs, either.</p>
<p>That said, despite the band's admirable disinterest in repeating themselves, <i>Bonfires</i> stumbles when the Clientele ditch the musical framework they've perfected to carry these less-than-obvious emotional states. For new listeners, think heartsick, echo-wobbly strum carried along (just barely) by the shuffle of 1960s AM gold. The Clientele are not, despite the guitars and their era-specific sound, a rock'n'roll band. You can't imagine them whipping a club full of Hamburg drunks into a chair-flinging frenzy. That sort of energy sounds feigned and forced coming from a band known for music fragile enough to be shattered by a forceful cough from the audience. <i>Bonfires</i> tracks like ""I Wonder Who We Are"" and ""Sketch"" are stiff approximations of cutting loose. If not quite as cheesy as interstitial music in a Mike Myers vehicle, they're still pretty ersatz.</p>
<p>Still, we're talking a handful of uptempo misfires out of 12 tracks. The Clientele aren't vain or foolish enough to try rocking out for a whole album. And even the ersatz shit <i>sounds</i> lush as hell. If the early Clientele singles made a virtue of trad indie pop's innovation-through-cheapness recording values, those values actually added to the music's character-- reverb can cover a lot of empty space on both the songwriting and production end of things-- then maturity as a band (and slightly bigger budgets, presumably) made that Clientele-specific sense of place all the more 3-D. The sound of <i>Suburban Light </i>was as smudgy as a head under the effects of cheap wine. <i>Bonfires</i> retains just enough of a fuzzy edge-- a Clientele album without fuzz would be the work of another band entirely-- while its clearer bursts of guitars, bells, organs, piano, strings, and horns lend a gentle eeriness, like bright radio melodies heard through the bleary ears of pre-coffee early morning.</p>
<p>Crucially, in terms of this tension between clarity and fuzziness, fire and varying intensities of late-summer light seem to have replaced rain and early spring's lingering dimness as the band's go-to tropes this time out. <i>Bonfires</i> is an indian summer record if ever there was one, music for the dizzying strangeness of unseasonable warmth as the trees begin to brown and sweaters come out of storage. The title track conjures images of watching kids through sleep-deprived eyes as they crowd around piles of burning refuse, the guitars peeling and quavering like weak flames. Frontman Alasdair MacLean even drops the line, ""late October sunlight in the woods,"" if you needed a no-nonsense scene-setter. The next track's called ""Harvest Time"", a similar late-decade thickening of the band's patented murmuring drift, paring the lyrics down even further to leave just wordless long notes that hover between grown-ass swoon and little boy longing. But that title, though: Throughout <i>Bonfires</i>, it's as if the band's trying to beat the synesthetes at their own game, making an album impossible to describe without using colors like ochre and umber and sunset red. You may not be able to recall its melody without prompting, but damned if you wouldn't be able to describe the image it paints with lyrics you could inscribe on a matchbook.</p>
<p>The best of the <i>Bonfires</i> extends the Clientele's great project: building, through hyper-evocative descriptive fragments and music to match, one of the great imaginary places in pop. The Clientele's suburb is obviously the product of an English coming of age, but it's also just dreamily vague enough to mirror the lives of listeners almost anywhere. (Unless you happen to live in one of those William Gibsonish fourth-world megalopolises with no green spaces.) The vibe of <i>Bonfires</i> is strong enough to almost feel the leaves crunching underfoot and smell the smoke cutting through the growing chill in the air, an indie-pop equivalent to Brian Eno's windswept and stone-solid world-building circa <i>On Land</i>. It's not an album you can dance to, but it's one you can live in and with, alone, which is rare enough to be applauded. The band's steadily curated one of the decade's great bodies of mood music. In an odd way, it strikes me as almost cousin to Sufjan Stevens' quixotic attempt to bring each state in the union to life: The Clientele seem to be trying to capture the light and air and meteorological conditions and attendant emotional baggage of each <i>season</i>, with a disarmingly straight-faced grace and wonder that makes it one of pop's more laudable long-term career moves.</p></div>"|13544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13544-bonfires-on-the-heath/|7.4|Jess Harvell

No matter how you slice the indie rock discography, Barlow is central to anywhere from at least three to as many as 10 canonical releases. Between Dinosaur Jr.'s first three LPs, through the uneven highs of both Sebadoh and Sentridoh and on to D Jr.'s magnetic reunion albums (some might count Folk Implosion...<i> might</i>), Barlow's legacy stands as much more than a footnote. In fact, even calling the output of Barlow-- now 43 and a married, soon-to-be father of two-- a legacy is to date him prematurely. Back in the musically unblemished if personally infamous Dinosaur Jr. trio, he's playing to the biggest crowds and most fanfare of his career. And we're not talking the sort of big gigs where Candlebox or the Spin Doctors shuffle through the hits in your town square (or is that just my town square?) for a few thousand lushes on a summer day, either. Dinosaur Jr. is arguably releasing the best music of its career (and its members' respective careers) right now. Their new records and their distinct history have made them, these days, a very big deal. Not bad for a quarter century, huh?</p>
<p>But <i>Goodnight Unknown</i>, Barlow's second solo LP for Merge Records, offers 14 tracks and 37 minutes of proof that Barlow is neither content with the comforts of his rock band's renewed popularity or with the scattered, shambolic solo discography he's built over two decades as Sentridoh. Though it boasted not only what might be the best song ever about a stray cat (""The Ballad of Daykitty"") but also one of rock's quietest moments of devilish heresy (""Mary""), <i>Emoh</i>, Barlow's first album under his own name, often felt too domestic, easy, and assured, as if Barlow got halfway into a track and-- true to his lo-fi heritage-- simply exclaimed, ""Fuck it."" That makes sense, of course, for an album whose title is ""Home"" in reverse and which was recorded half alone.</p>
<p><i>Goodnight Unknown </i>feels comfortable and, to a point, casual, too, but it bears the kind of exploratory vigor that <i>Emoh</i> lacked. Stylistically, it's much more diverse than <i>Emoh</i>, squeezing many of Barlow's alternate modes-- Dinosaur Jr.'s pop crunch, Sebadoh's wiry nerves, Sentridoh's acoustic mold-- into a well-paced and well-produced whole. The songs are mostly simple, but the production of Andrew Murdock and the assistance of a cast that includes Lisa Germano, ex-Soul Coughing bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and Dinosaur Jr.'s Murph add enough flourishes to make careful listens rewarding. Opener ""Sharing"", for instance, is a turgid power-pop charger, pushed from behind by Melvin Dale Crover-- a friend of Barlow's because they cruise the same Los Angeles ""<a href=""http://www.verbicidemagazine.com/?p=3542"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pre-school circuit</a>,"" says Barlow-- and guided by a chorus that opens wide like the top of a convertible. But ""The Right"" is a lithe pop march. Like bedroom Spoon, its understated structure centers on an unshifting, up-down beat and simple chords from an acoustic guitar, all decorated by a chiseled electric line and keys that twinkle between the layers. During ""One Machine, One Long Fight"", the thick drums, circular bass, and anxious vocals saturate the tape. The thuds swell in the speakers as with any number of post-Neutral Milk Hotel acts. ""The One I Call"", though, is a gentle acoustic lilt that punctuates the beautifully intertwined guitars of Barlow and Imaad Wasif with drums so simple they sound like a five-gallon bucket banged with a rubber mallet.</p>
<p>And lyrically, <i>Goodnight Unknown</i> moves well beyond the reductive (and, for a while now, very wrong) image of Barlow as a moping misanthrope. That picture, of course, was rightfully established by records like Sebadoh's <i>Bakesale</i> (""Somehow I don't trust you/ I don't trust myself"") and songs like Dinosaur Jr.'s ""Don't"" (""Why don't you like me?"" <i>ad infinitum</i>). <i>Goodnight Unknown</i>, however, is a reassuring mix of resignation and resistance wherein Barlow admits he's not all powerful but that he's not going to let the world trample him, either. Curious rhetorical devices line these proclamations. Like on the bittersweet ""I'm Thinking..."", Barlow steadies himself amid anxieties about the future by using existential tautologies as crutches. ""The older I get, I get older,"" he sings, somewhere between a whisper and a croon. ""Some days are short, others longer."" He pines about his new quest for patience and laments his own nasty habits. Ultimately, he defends his ""right to be conflicted."" And on the gorgeous ""Take Advantage"", he diagrams love like an exotic chemical equation: ""Take apart a rainbow/ Feed it to the sunrise/ Wake me with your elbow/ And I'll know."" Silly and charming, it feels less like an attempt to be clever than an attempt to be honest, or to document exactly how he feels.</p>
<p>And, in the end, isn't that the point? <i>Goodnight Unknown</i> isn't a record that looks to cement some sort of amorphous legacy. It's Barlow's attempt to, you know, be a songwriter. Given that legacy, though, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Lou Barlow excels at being as much.</p></div>"|13556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13556-goodnight-unknown/|7.3|Grayson Currin

There were the collaborations on <i>The Crybaby </i>with everyone from David Yow to Leif Garrett; full-album partnerships with Jello Biafra, Lustmord, and Fantômas; a staged ""live"" version of <i>Houdini</i>; and whatever the intermittently awesome <i>Hostile Ambient Takeover </i>was supposed to be. Interesting music at every stop, but overall an uneven track record, one that encourages doubts about any new Melvins diversion.</p>
<p>Still, the idea behind <i>Chicken Switch</i> is promising. The band gave entire albums (and sometimes more) to noisy experimental artists, letting each melt, slice, and demolish the music into five-minute-or-so chunks. And the concept works, mostly because the band chose interesting remixers rather than famous ones. The only well-known names here are Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo, Matmos, and Boredoms' Eye Yamatsuka, and even Melvins fans may not recognize the other participants. But everyone involved attacks their work with vigor, precision, and an insatiable desire to test limits. And they all bring their A-games to <i>Chicken Switch</i>, making<i> </i>it less a Melvins remix record than a compilation of excellent experimental music.</p>
<p>In other words, these aren't Melvins riffs set to dance beats. Occasionally the diehard fan might recognize the odd chord or familiar rhythm-- take Eye's loop of chugging riffs, or Ranaldo's busy multi-song edit, one of the few tracks with recognizable vocals. But more typical is the entry from Germany's Christoph Heemann. ""Emperor Twaddle (Remix)"" opens with three minutes of ringing drone-- stretching and thickening the intro of <i>Honky</i>'s ""They All Must Be Slaughtered"" well past its original length-- followed by 30 seconds of riffs and beats blurred into cacophony.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Chicken Switch </i>employs that kind of scorched-earth approach. Rather than rearranging the Melvins' basic atoms, the remixers split them apart, creating unpredictable bursts of noise and texture with completely new DNA. In that sense, ""remix"" is too narrow a term for what's going on here. Better to call these reincarnations, with the participants basically murdering the original music and pumping new breath and blood into its hollowed-out remains.</p>
<p>This process produces impressive diversity. German artist RLW (who himself crafted a similar guest-remix project called <i>Tulpas </i>in the late 1990s) makes what sounds like a minimalist string quartet dragging their bows across metal objects. Viennese electronic group Farmers Manual compose a symphony of blips and growls, like a farther-out version of Black Dice. Japanese noise king Merzbow offers a soothing din chopped up by a clanging beat. And former Melvin David Scott Stone stretches King Buzzo's vocals into a wordless choir of gurgling drones.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Chicken Switch </i>comes from Kawabata Makoto of Acid Mothers Temple. ""4th Floor Hellcopter"" opens with a slow, crunchy beat, slides into forbidding feedback, then ascends into burning metal guitar and stereo-spanning dissonance. Kawabata bridges the gap between recognizable riffs and all-out abstraction, pointing out the rich diversity inside the Melvins' music. As a whole, <i>Chicken Switch</i> does the same. Its wide sonic range is testament to how much lurks beneath the surface of every Melvins album. Whatever faults one can find in their experiments, their work is clearly deep enough to be worthy of such off-center explorations.</p></div>"|13545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13545-chicken-switch/|7.8|Marc Masters

Against the Flaming Lips' grid-draining light show and extravagant confetti budget, the Very Best pitted a grinning guy in a rakishly cocked plaid hat, a stocky Euro-hipster with a console-laden table, and a couple of head-wrapped backup singers. The crowd seemed thin and politely engaged during the first song. By the last, the audience had swelled considerably, and everyone was bouncing up and down-- a sea of genuinely happy faces. That's the simplest and most important thing about the Very Best. Their enthusiasm is contagious.</p>
<p>The group debuted last year with the superlative mixtape <i>Esau Mwamwaya and Radioclit Are the Very Best</i>. The Malawi-born singer ran a secondhand shop in London, where he met Etienne Tron of Radioclit (Tron is French; his partner Johan Karlberg is Swedish). Radioclit's prior work had leaned heavily on grime, Miami bass, crunk, and other aggressive genres; they dubbed their style ""ghetto-pop."" But with the Very Best mixtape, they turned from dark, druggy hedonism to effervescent productions that blended Afropop-laced originals with mixes of M.I.A. and Vampire Weekend. It was feel-good music that felt fresh and healthful, just like Mwamwaya's voice. He sang ebulliently in Chichewa, English, and other languages, and the foreignness of the words only cleared the way for the life-affirming feeling that shined through them.</p>
<p><i>Warm Heart of Africa</i>, the group's official debut, rises to the high standard set by the mixtape, from which only two tracks are held over: ""Kamphopo"", where Mwamwaya swaggers through sun-streaked Architecture in Helsinki samples, and a dance mix of ""Kada Manja"", with added drums and some of its strings gathered up into a loping rhythm. A couple of guest stars also return. Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend duets with Mwamwaya on the title track, which will probably be the first song on the album that knocks out most listeners. ""The boys move fast/ You should take it slow,"" they advise coquettishly, in an irresistible hopscotch cadence, over splashes of sampled guitar and hand percussion. And M.I.A. appears on ""Rain Dance"", panting and purring over a taut drumline, in one of the album's few respites from blaring melody. This sense of continuity with the mixtape is bolstered by the fact that some of these songs are so immediate you'll swear you've heard them before, like ""Julia"", which sounds like some kind of sublimely cheerful G-funk.</p>
<p>Radioclit deserve a lot of credit for keeping the vibe upbeat but diverse: Whether they're cooking up a snap track with pizzicato accents on ""Yalira"", pinging 1980s synth-pop on ""Chalo"", tropical dreams on ""Angonde"", or kwaito-inspired pulses on ""Ntdende Uli"", they stay out of Mwamwaya's way, using small and tactile rhythmic embellishments to give him extra kick-- always lively, never cluttered. Which is smart, because Mwamwaya is a scene-stealer, for the uncomplicated reason that he sings like an angel and takes evident pleasure in doing so. On ""Zam'dziko"", his voice weaves in and out of itself, adorned only with sporadic drum claps. For Mwamwaya, a hot beat is always nice, but pretty much optional. The album's biggest asset has to do with his presence, and it's hard to put a name to-- ""spiritual generosity"" sounds too grand, but that's what it feels like.</p>
<p>Some people tend to get up in arms whenever African music gets mixed up with Western genres-- as if they haven't always been in a dialogue, like how marabi is related to American jazz. The Very Best inspired me to learn more about some of the genres they employ, and if you do the same, that's great-- but an Afropop primer isn't what Mwamwaya's about here. In drawing lines between older African genres, like highlife, and newer ones, like kwaito, and then linking those to international pop styles of various eras, <i>Warm Heart of Africa</i> pictures a glittering web of connectivity where national and cultural boundaries dissolve. People care about socio-cultural chin-stroking; music does not. This record simply wants to be heard, by whomever will listen and enjoy. There's no cynical play for authenticity, no implication that Afropop is somehow piously cordoned off from Western music. It's a true global-pop album, and a hopeful template for things to come.</p></div>"|13518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13518-warm-heart-of-africa/|8.6|Brian Howe

I could have predicted that,"" Sune Rose Wagner wrote in anticipation of <i>In and Out of Control</i>, his fourth proper album with co-Raveonette Sharin Foo. Yeah, we could have predicted that, too. In fact, we expected a lot less from the Raveonettes: After two great records (the debut EP <i>Whip It On</i>, followed by the markedly better full-length <i>Chain Gang of Love</i>), it became fairly clear that these Danes were destined to remain faithful to a singular trick (the overblown Jesus and Mary Chain/ Phil Spector fanaticism; eyeliner), always well-rehearsed and respectfully researched. But by the time their make-or-break mainstream offering <i>Pretty in Black</i> showed up, most interest in their reverb-addled, shooby-doo-wop indulgences had waned. It made waiting a few years for Crystal Stilts pretty easy.</p>
<p>But with their return-to-loud third album <i>Lust Lust Lust</i>, we found a band embracing their failure to launch, reconnecting with (and latching more tightly to) a sound they so lovingly cultured. So you could almost call <i>In and Out of Control </i>a sophomore effort of sorts: ""Now I tremble in New York City, the times we had were the best, yeah baby,"" sings Wagner on ""Gone Forever"", a fantastically dispiriting, too-old-for-this-shit sequel to <i>Chain Gang</i>'s ""New York Was Great"". Less gorgeously noisy than <i>Lust</i>,<i> Control </i>makes up for all that grand recklessness in its sure-footing and execution. A glance at the track listing might persuade one to think that this affair will prove assuredly more ""out of control"" than ""in"" (""Suicide"", ""D.R.U.G.S."", ""Breaking Into Cars""), but most of these songs invert the anticipated and adopt a playfulness that's both disquietingly funny and humbly self-referential.</p>
<p>Single ""Last Dance""-- a resplendent dose of dreambeat prom-pop-- perfectly exemplifies the morbid tongue-in-cheek formula that the best tracks on <i>Control</i> subscribe to. Here, we find a character asking an eventual overdose victim to save the titular last dance for them, though it's apparent the inevitable death of the dancer is far less important than the fulfillment of the traditional ""Spring Fling"" date contract (or more pointedly, simply an ode to teenage narcissism). Whether laying a lover to rest on the interlude ""Oh, I Buried You Today"" (""It's so hard for me to say sweet words about you,"" Foo muses adorably) or frankly embracing their outward influences on ""Suicide"" (assuming that this runaway tale's motto of ""lick your lips and fuck suicide"" is less about deciding <i>not</i> to off yourself and more about literally giving yourself to no wave),<i> Control</i>'s unsettling sense of humor helps categorize the Raveonettes as a weather-tested act that has the good sense to play with the motifs and textures they used to take all too seriously.</p>
<p>This of course brings us to the big water-cooler centerpiece ""Boys Who Rape (Should All Be Destroyed)"", an unnervingly direct and plainly stated song about the frighteningly real effects of sexual assault, made all the more shiver-worthy in its saccharine-laced delivery. ""Those fuckers stay in your head,"" Foo chimes, uncomfortably pitched like an innocent line from a long-lost Ronettes tune about being stood-up. It's a debilitatingly chilling, calculatingly emasculating idea that shouldn't work but does, and only provides further insight into how clever and accomplished the Raveonettes can sound when they feel this confident in their own skin.</p>
<p>When things do begin to feel a little too familiar (the dead-eyed twist of ""Heart of Stone"" and the peppery opener ""Bang!"" feel dredged from sessions that could very well date back to the very beginning of the band's existence), <i>Control </i>manages to pull clever punches that keep interests piqued. The dramatic disco-pulse of highlight ""D.R.U.G.S."" or the barefaced sex metaphors that build ""Breaking Into Cars"" are artful in their ability to circumvent convention just enough to please familiar listeners and still satisfy the songwriters' needier impulses. ""[<i>Control</i> is about] not giving a shit what other people think of you and most importantly being mad and angelic,"" Wagner stated in that same press release. He's dead-on; for that we can certainly be appreciative.</p></div>"|13529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13529-in-and-out-of-control/|6.9|Zach Kelly

Fact: Indie dreamboat and RealDoll lover portrayer Ryan Gosling is one-half of Los Angeles band Dead Man's Bones. Wow! Fact: Dead Man's Bones' self-titled debut is a concept album vaguely about supernatural themes, released less than a month before Halloween! Gee! Fact: The vast majority of <i>Dead Man's Bones</i> utilizes a real-life, full-on children's choir, recruited from hipster kid academy the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. TILT TILT TILT! Step aside Girls, we've got a new backstory winner for 2009.</p>
<p>It's a credit to the record then that none of these angles turn out to be easy nooses by which to hang the project. The one triggering most alarm bells, of course, is Gosling's involvement, since everyone knows that movie-star bands tend to range from amateurishly terrible to inoffensively generic. Well, I'll dispel that preconception straight away-- <i>Dead Man's Bones</i> is a really, really <i>weird</i> record, a project where the musical reference points at least indicate that Gosling and his co-conspirator Zach Shields have record collections that go deeper than an iPod nano.</p>
<p>The other two angles-- spooky themes and a kid's choir-- are both symptoms of the record's most endearing quality, a surplus of ideas and a willingness to combine them in ways that are vibrant, sloppy, and fun. Though the record begins with a pretentious spoken-word introductory track (kind of a necessary concept-album evil) followed by its worst song (the Ambien-overdosed and over-serious ""Dead Hearts""), the remainder of the project is slapdash, giddy, and surprisingly dense. Like an old Elephant 6 record, Dead Man's Bones has a lo-fi warts-and-all feel that's less lazy aesthetic than charmingly handmade, even more charismatic for it's unevenness.</p>
<p>That enthusiasm manifests itself best in places like the hand-clap percussion that propels ""Lose Your Soul"" and ""In the Room Where You Sleep"", both of which feature Gosling's surprisingly effective croon. Songs follow unusual paths-- ""In the Room"" goes from ""Monster Mash"" organ-rock to a soft Rhodes coda; ""My Body's a Zombie For You"" has a flute solo breakdown and an<i> </i>a cappella chant; several songs repurpose laughter and chatter from the kids of the choir as ambient noise. And while most of the supernatural themes are more grade-school Halloween party than horror movie, there are a handful of genuinely unsettling moments-- the aquatic ghost story of ""Buried in Water"" slashed through with sad, shrill children's voices that remind of Bob Drake's brilliantly scary <i>The Skull Mailbox</i>; a creepy whispered monologue in the middle of ""Young &amp; Tragic"" that sounds like a kid conversing with an imaginary friend.</p>
<p>I recognize that the children's choir might be a dealbreaker for some, but the tenaciousness with which Dead Man's Bones use the choir should win over all but the most ardent kid-haters. Sure, there's a bit of the time-honored Roger Waters tradition of making kids sing slightly inappropriate lyrics-- the first line they're given to sing is the eerie ""Like a lamb to the slaughter"" and their participation on a song called ""My Body's a Zombie For You"" is ever so slightly disconcerting. But the kids also add swooping, dramatic ""woah-ohhhs"" that would make the Arcade Fire jealous, and get some meatier parts in the harmonized syncopations of ""Lose Your Soul"" or the showtuney curtain-dropping chorus of ""Flowers Grow Out of My Grave"".</p>
<p>Overall, I'm as surprised as you are with Dead Man's Bones. So many ways for it to go wrong, but instead it's a unique, catchy and lovably weird record, with highlights (the electric piano singalong ""Pa Pa Power"", the Beck-ish ""Werewolf Heart"") that could hold their own with the best indie singles of the year. Perhaps all those easy angles are a smokescreen, a diversion to lower expectations on a record strong enough to be listened to both without preconceptions and long after its Halloween expiration date.</p></div>"|13543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13543-dead-mans-bones/|7.1|Rob Mitchum

To curtail the invading counterculture, the city imposed a strict curfew, and cops clashed with longhairs in a series of small riots that galvanized the hippies rather than dispersed them. The skirmishes inspired Buffalo Springfield to write ""For What It's Worth"" and Four-Leaf Productions to bankroll the teensploitation flick <i>Riot on Sunset Strip</i>, featuring a theme song by local group the Standells. It begins mundanely enough: ""I'm going down to the Strip tonight, I'm not on a stay-home trip tonight,"" sings drummer Dick Dodd over Tony Valentino's snarling guitar lick. But the song's hard beat is more of a billy-club swing than a hip shake, and the lyrics become increasingly serious, as he laments the Strip has become ""just a place for black-and-white cars to race. It's causin' a riot!"" More pointed and angry than the square film that bears it title, the song depicts Los Angeles as a tensed city on the brink of chaos and violence, and the Standells could just as well have been singing about Watts or any of the race riots that made the curfew clashes seem polite and placid by comparison.</p>
<p>""Riot on Sunset Strip"" kicks off Rhino's 4xCD set <i>Where the Action Is! Los Angeles Nuggets 1965-1968</i>, setting the scene for the 100 tracks that follow. Local bands were drawing inspiration from the sights all around them, whether it was sirens on a cop car or sirens dancing in the clubs. For them, L.A. was the center of the universe, if not the entire universe itself, and these groups-- some of whom, in true <i>Nuggets</i> fashion, lasted no more than a 45 or two-- established a particular dialogue with the city that projected well beyond Sunset Strip and reverberated around the Valley. Arthur Lee details just such a trippy travelogue on ""You I'll Be Following"", a bouncy number from Love's debut with killer harmonies and his electric vocal. Kim Fowley's hysteric ""Underground Lady"" tries to capture the scene in the surreal slang of the times, and on ""Los Angeles"", one-time Byrd Gene Clark calls it the ""city of the doomed,"" although you might swear he's singing ""city of the dunes.""</p>
<p>Despite its appearance of insularity, the scene was not a closed circuit. In 1965, the Byrds charted a hit with a cover of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", and their then-new folk-rock not only energized local musicians, inspiring scores of imitators and innovators, but attracted the attention of listeners, DJs, and suits across the country. <i>Where the Action Is!</i> picks up around this time, introducing the Byrds with ""You Movin'"", a sophisticated throwaway from their early ""preflyte"" sessions. You can hear their influence throughout the box set, as other musicians put their stamp on the sound, mixing it with go-go rhythms, psychedelic mindmelts, art-rock excursions, canyon folk, and pretty much anything else that came to hand. Including bagpipes.</p>
<p>A diverse collection of tunes that have little else in common beyond geography, <i>Where the Action Is!</i> depicts the L.A. scene as impossibly busy and variegated. The first two discs collect songs from some of the progenitors of the sound, who played frequently in the clubs and taverns that eventually took over the Strip. The desert eccentricities of Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band's ""Zig Zag Wanderer"" jostle with the proto-flower-power sounds of the Seeds' ""Tripmaker"" and the southwestern flair of the Bobby Fuller Four's ""Baby, My Heart"". The Rising Sons' ""Take a Giant Step"" sounds self-propelled and gritty, at distinct odds with the Palace Guard's ""All Night Long"" and Sonny &amp; Cher's ""It's Gonna Rain"", which sound stuffy by comparison. The Strip found room for all these disparate acts, who honed their distinctive sounds through live performance before demanding audiences.</p>
<p>As the second disc moves beyond those clubs to document the bands around the Valley and throughout the Inland Empire, <i>Where the Action Is!</i> grows even heavier, more adventurous, and more diverse: There's a considerable Latino presence here, such as Thee Midniters rumbling through their energetic ""Jump, Jive &amp; Harmonize"" and the Premiers begging you to ""Get on This Plane"". Acts like the Chymes and Penny Arkade offer very different takes on the Strip beat, suggesting the vast difference between the artists there and elsewhere. If the first half of the set emphasizes performance, the third and fourth discs examine the evolution of the studio as an instrument, whether as an agent for Thorinshield's psychedelic exploration on ""Daydreaming"" or as a tool for beefing up rock songs like Keith Allison's ""Action, Action, Action"". There's an even wider range of sounds, obviously, although the songs typically lack the hard-edged grooves of the Strip bands: Jan and Dean's ""Fan Tan"" and the Yellow Balloon's ""Yellow Balloon"" even sound like commercial jingles, and Rick Nelson's kitschy ""Marshmallow Skies"" comes across as a targeted cred grab, despite his avowed advocacy of the new folk rock.</p>
<p>But there's an even larger narrative traced by these discs, which show how the sounds that developed in clubs and bars were adopted by more ambitious and at times already established artists. There are familiar, sometimes unexpected names on the fourth disc: Tim Buckley and Randy Newman were both influenced by this scene, and their songs show little-heard aspects of their work. Peter Fonda and Hugh Masekela collaborated to record Gram Parsons' ""November Night"" (which Parsons himself never recorded), and <i>Where the Action Is!</i> persuasively argues for the Strip's impact on the Beach Boys by including an alternate take of ""Heroes and Villains"", whose menacing sound bite-- ""You're under arrest!""-- sounds especially loaded in this context. Together, these four discs give the sense of an exciting rock underground arising and mutating and interacting with and changing the mainstream-- not just locally but nationally and internationally. It'd be 10 years before L.A.'s scene would regain this level of excitement and punk purpose, but that's another box set altogether.</p></div>"|13532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13532-where-the-action-is-los-angeles-nuggets-1965-1968/|7.8|Stephen M.

Sam Simkoff, frontman of the D.C.-based indie pop quintet that bears the appellation, claims he chose it to riff on all the other indie groups out there with the word ""Wolf"" in their names, self-consciously ratcheting up the pretentiousness meter by translating it into another tongue. It's a great joke that shows Simkoff has a keen eye for hipster trends, and his band's music is likewise plugged in to the zeitgeist. In interviews, when asked to tick off influences, Simkoff and his bandmates don't reach for ultra-obscure 1960s cult artists or hyper-ironic mainstream touchstones, but freely list folks like Animal Collective, Sufjan Stevens, and Grizzly Bear. In contrast, for instance, to the glo-fi thing that has seemed to burble up fairly organically this year from various and sundry quarters, Le Loup's music feels like a direct reaction to what indie-rock's A-List has been cooking up over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>You could certainly argue that Animal Collective belongs at the top of this heap as the reigning kings of indie, so perhaps it should be no surprise that AC is far and away Le Loup's biggest source of sonic inspiration on the band's sophomore LP, <i>Family</i> (again demonstrating an impressive feel for subtle shifts in subcultural taste, the group's 2007 debut was far more Sufjan-beholden). All of the most distinguishing AC traits are on display here, as layers upon layers of reverbed harmonies get distorted and smeared atop equally diffuse artilleries of percussion. It's an impossible comparison to shake, especially during a couple of really on-the-nose moments like the cymbal crashes of ""Forgive Me"" or the watery effects of ""Sherpa"". If you wanted to be somewhat cynical you could think of this album as a sort of palatable gateway drug for listeners who've yet to stomach Animal Collective's lengthier, noisier, more out-there head trips. Le Loup trade chaos and dissonance for reassurance and tranquility thanks in large part to an abundance of folkier accoutrements like banjo and mandolin, deployed throughout the album and utilized to particularly pleasing effect on the ruminative ""Go East"" and on ""Morning Song"", which hints at a recognition of Fleet Foxes' recent prominence.</p>
<p>Even if the overall effect here isn't terribly original, there are still plenty of nice touches spread throughout these tracks to suggest Le Loup holds the potential to become more than an amalgam of well-regarded influences. ""Beach Town"" rides a full-toned bass and lovely ascending guitar figure, while ""Grow"" allows ""Be My Baby"" drums and a general early-60s lilt to pierce through the ghostly murk. Best of all is the closing ""A Celebration"", which works up a genuine groove and then tantalizingly kisses it with some beautiful guitar glints that alternately evoke Afro-pop and the Allman Brothers. More of this please.</p></div>"|13551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13551-family/|6.0|Joshua Love

Following the high-water marks of <i>Perfect From Now On</i> and <i>Keep It Like a Secret</i>, they went into a sort of low-grade creative hibernation, issuing records every three or four years containing a few flashes of genuine inspiration (""Strange"", ""Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss"", ""Goin' Against Your Mind"") surrounded by increasingly aimless jamming. Doug Martsch, the lead singer, guitarist, and creative force behind the band, was beginning to sound like a guy with nothing particularly important left to tell us-- we could stick around, if we wanted, to hear him play his guitar, but the lack of purpose was disconcerting.  ""Something is wrong/ Something invisible is gone,"" Martsch crooned on <i>Ancient Melodies of the Future</i>'s ""The Host"", and with each successive release, it was hard not to revisit their earlier work in attempts to puzzle out anew what that ""something"" was.</p>
<p>On the unexpectedly terrific <i>There Is No Enemy</i>, it becomes immediately clear what had been missing, and sure enough, it was invisible: While <i>Enemy</i> technically sounds just like every Built to Spill record since <i>Keep It Like a Secret</i>-- the pinwheeling guitar fantasias, the ambling tempos, and the wayward vocal lines are all here--<i> </i> it is buoyed by a fresh sense of emotional stakes, an urgency that puts wind back in the band's sails. For the first time in almost 10 years, it seems that Martsch might actually have something he wants to say.</p>
<p>""Saying something,"" of course, is always a loaded concept with regard to Doug Martsch: He has spent years telling every interviewer who asks that his lyrics contain no personal meaning, that they are chosen more for their meter and suggestiveness than anything else. Ironically, he often seems to be pondering the impossibility of clear communication: ""This strange sound you said I said/ You're not listening or I'm not saying it right,"" he fretted on ""Strange"". ""If there's a word for you, it doesn't mean anything,"" he insisted on <i>Perfect From Now On</i>'s ""Velvet Waltz"".</p>
<p>All of this misdirection only makes the disarmingly candid, even open-hearted tone  of <i>There Is No Enemy</i> more startling. Whether or not the words carry personal weight, Martsch is singing convincingly from the perspective of someone thoroughly humbled by loss. ""Like anyone assuming they know what makes us tick, I was just as wrong as I could be,"" he shrugs on ""Tomorrow"". His shit-eating grin is almost visible when he sings ""Finally decided, and by decide I mean accept/ I won't need all those other chances I won't get"" on ""Life's a Dream"". The loss, of course, remains unspecified-- the only clue we get is ""Pat"", which eulogizes a lost friend--  but its impact can be felt everywhere on <i>Enemy</i>. ""Good Ol' Boredom"" celebrates the arrival of its titular emotional state as a sign that life is returning to normal, a place where ""not so bad/ Seems so great."" On the wounded, fragile ballad ""Things Fall Apart"", meanwhile, Martsch sings ""Stay out of my nightmares, stay out of my dreams/ You're not even welcome in my memories""  in a subdued mutter before delivering a simple, devastating clincher: ""It doesn't matter if you're good or smart-- goddammit, things fall apart."" The inspiration for this sentiment could have come from any number of places-- in the press run-up to this album, Martsch mentioned being influenced by soul music, for example-- but it rings with powerful truth regardless, and produces very real goosebumps.</p>
<p>In this context, even their well-worn and comfortable indie jamming feels revitalized. The core lineup of Martsch, Brett Nelson, and Scott Plouf remains unchanged, and they produce the same sound: a majestic, heavy-footed thud, held aloft by Martsch's transcendent guitar work and weightless tenor. But within this framework, they are pushing harder than ever before: witness the cooing ""ooh-la-la"" backup harmonies in ""Life's a Dream"", or the outbreak of horn charts at the song's bridge. Three-quarters of the way into ""Things Fall Apart"", a  mariachi trumpet wanders in, seemingly from a Calexico album. ""Pat"", meanwhile, is a blistering, two-and-a-half-minute burst of anger that hearkens back to Martsch's days in Treepeople. But even the straightforward Built to Spill songs are some of the best ones we've heard in a long time: ""Nowhere Lullabye"" and ""Life's a Dream"" are two of the most gorgeously dreamy ballads Martsch has written since ""Else"" or ""Kicked It in the Sun"", and on ""Good Ol' Boredom"", when Martsch finally fires up his shimmering, multihued guitar, the following extended solo workout feels both thrilling and earned. The end result is easily the best Built to Spill album of the decade-- an improbable late-career reawakening and heartening evidence that becoming dependable doesn't mean having to settle for being predictable.</p></div>"|13541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13541-there-is-no-enemy/|7.9|Jayson Greene

Most of all, there's the way they composed their music as an unapologetically frothy sort of cheese-pop without letting it get dominated by snorting insincerity or self-conscious hokeyness. You could still hear the kitsch, but it wasn't the driving force, and they had a sneaky way of lulling you into forgetting you weren't ""supposed"" to like this kind of thing. Hell, lots of people actually had sex to <i>Moon Safari</i>, which is about as unironic as you can get. (At least I hope they were being unironic.)</p>
<p>A half-decade of Balearic/glo-fi/'lude-house has since refined that mellow aesthetic to the point where taste-conscious end-runs around potential irony have become increasingly unnecessary. But while that refinement applied readily to the subtle songcraft of <i>Talkie Walkie </i>and <i>Pocket Symphony</i>, both of which provided ample evidence of Air's vintage pop smarts, they've somehow stumbled their way into a pit of lite-FM treacle on their new album. <i>Love 2</i>-- as titles go, a bad pun disguised as a sequel nobody needed-- is a dopey little slice of not-much that feels like a noodly rendering of yacht-pop weightlessness. Much has been made about Air's new independence in the process of making this album; it's the first one to come out of their new recording studio, Atlas, and the first to be written and recorded without the input of any major outside producers (though they still brought in <i>Moon Safari</i> engineer Stephane ""Alf"" Briat to tinker behind the boards). Far be it from me to accuse Jean-Benoît Dunckel and Nicolas Godin of being a couple empty vessels who need a Nigel Godrich to whip them into shape, but maybe they could've used someone looking over their shoulders to warn them away from indulging in some bad ideas.</p>
<p>Bad ideas like, say, ""Tropical Disease"". This song is the album's longest, worst, and most emblematic of <i>Love 2</i>'s problems, nearly seven minutes of malaise that bookends a preciously chipper, tin whistle-punctuated slab of Playskool krautrock with two movements of plastic surgeon's waiting-office Muzak. It's laughably oily when its Econolodge-noir sax oozes in crotch-first, and even more uncomfortable in its second half when Dunckel's pitched-up voice chirps, ""Woman/ Make me feel... <i>warm inside</i>."" God, it's awkward. That  empty yet still uncomfortable theme of louche, inarticulate romance is all over the record's ill-advised vocal tracks: pining over a walking (albeit <i>softly </i>walking) cliché in ""So Light Is Her Footfall""; trying to milk intrigue out of the lifeless phrase, ""there is something going on between us,"" in ""You Can Tell It to Everybody""; murmuring about love in ""Love"" (lyrics: ""Love/ Love/ Love/ Love/ Love""). The lyrics read less like the work of someone who didn't grow up speaking English than someone who knows it well and thinks it's kind of a stupid, pointless language. That'd explain the empty, tense-based babble-talk in ""Sing Sang Sung"", at least.</p>
<p>Maybe they've always been perpetrators of petty crimes against lyrical songwriting and it's only now that their music's been weak enough to avoid hiding it. The exoticism that made their instantly recognizable brand of music compelling-- the outmoded technology, the unexpected world-music left turns, the almost detached baroqueness-- has been diluted to the point where all their old tricks sound listless. Leadoff track ""Do the Joy"" is maybe the least-botched attempt at doing something new, though its fuzzed-out slo-motion strut is quickly rendered absurd by a ""spooky"" B-movie synthesizer melody. Most everything else runs a diverse gamut of uninspiring retreads: uptempo krautpunk that sounds a bit like <i>The Virgin Suicides </i>standout ""Dead Bodies"" without the intensity (""Be a Bee""), lightheaded, minimalist tweaks of hotel-lounge disco (""Love"", which scans like George McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"" in a coma), mid-80s David Bowie with gastrointestinal discomfort (""Missing the Light of the Day""), a half-baked instrumental caricature of Blondie-sans-Debby (""Eat My Beat""), and a couple of pretty unconvincing attempts to incorporate Afrobeat (""Night Hunter"") and township music (""African Velvet""-- I wish I were making up that title).</p>
<p>Thing is, it still sounds entirely like an Air album-- just a remarkably bland one. The complementary piano/synth lines that Dunckel and Godin made their stock in trade still dredge up a few legitimately nice melodies, though they typically prove fleeting. And session drummer-turned-auxiliary member Joey Waronker, well, he tries; he's one of the better motorik beat-deployment specialists going, and even he can't jostle much excitement into the proceedings, especially when his job most of the time is to tap out minimalist beats in one of the many tracks that pushes downtempo rhythms into complete stasis. <i>Love 2 </i>exhibits the band's style by just about every familiar metric, except the one that made them fascinating in the first place-- that uncanny ability to make schlock sound beautiful. In its place is a strange reversal: beauty rendered schlock, pop melodies and space-age wonder curdled by damaged whimsy.</p></div>"|13503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13503-love-2/|4.0|Nate Patrin

They released five such missives on five different labels over just a few months, and soon after plucked tracks from them for their first full-length release, <i>Weirdo Rippers</i>. Since then the L.A. guitar-and-drums duo has toured so much, been written about so much, and released such a great album (<i>Nouns)</i>, that those initial releases feel a little like ancient relics.</p>
<p>No Age's Dean Spunt and Randy Randall have decided to return to the EP, releasing four new tracks now rather than save them for a future long-player. It's a curious move since each sounds album-ready and none are hugely different from previous work, but this band doesn't really deal in long-form anyway-- both <i>Weirdo Rippers </i>and <i>Nouns </i>barely made it past the half-hour mark. It would be cool if<i> </i>these tunes were deemed worthy of an EP because they're a radical departure into dark noise, or a set of Hüsker Dü covers, or a conceptual suite about the human nervous system. But it's also cool that they're just another solid No Age record.</p>
<p>What makes <i>Losing Feeling</i> so solid is how it begins and ends. The opening title track simultaneously floats in place and hurtles forward, recalling the pulsing drift of <i>Nouns</i>' ""Sleeper Hold"". But now the band stretches a bit more, injecting the breaks with a little more tension, a little more bite. And a final rave-up shifts into high gear, turning a nice crescendo into a tidal wave. That infectious wash is matched on the opposite end of the EP<i> </i>by ""You're a Target"". Here the hectic rush of the opener gets drenched in a layer of shimmering guitar tones-- imagine <i>Nouns</i>' ""Brain Burner"" covered by the Pains of Being Pure at Heart.</p>
<p>Those two blasts would've made a killer 7"", but the moodier songs in between build an intriguing bridge. ""Genie"" marries Randall's slow strumming to Spunt's simple whine, building rhythm without the aid of drums. ""Aim at the Airport"" goes one step further, eschewing both drums <i>and</i> vocals. Its looping guitar could probably fit on something released by Kranky or even Mego, but coming in between two No Age rockers, the wavy fuzz is clearly recognizable. It's not hard to imagine a voice and a drumbeat rising out of this mix were it to go on longer. The same can be said for <i>Losing Feeling </i>as a whole-- had No Age stuck in the studio for a few more hours, this could've easily been a stellar LP. Instead, it leaves little doubt that whenever their <i>Nouns </i>follow-up does emerge, it will have been worth the wait.</p></div>"|13516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13516-losing-feeling/|8.3|Marc Masters

Not exactly what one wants to hear when talking about an anticipated sophomore release, especially one with a title that promises to literally split your fucking wig, or at very least serve as an alternate soundtrack to <i>Scanners </i>(I'm guessing <i>Melting Face</i> was a little too on-the-nose). While <i>Exploding Head </i>is no washout-- right around ""Keep Slipping Away"", the back half picks up where the debut left off, full of inspired pieces of paranoia-inducing industrial guitar noise and moribund pop textures-- it too often seems like a misguided attempt to connect dots for the listener. On the debut, much of the fun came from sifting through all that ball-retracting dissonance and coming out with handfuls of melodic goop. Here, after eliminating some of the harsher textures in favor of cleanlier, well-positioned rawk tunes, the music is packed with palatable songs that spook instead of uncomfortable ones that seriously unnerve. In other words, if we're still classifying A Place to Bury Strangers as Jesus and Mary Chain revivalists, it's far too early in their career for this to be their <i>Automatic</i>.</p>
<p><i>Head</i> is most assuredly a maturation, from the songwriting right down to the fancy effects-pedal driven magic that frontman Oliver Ackermann is so rightfully lauded for (Ackermann famously crafts customized pedals through his Death By Audio company for artists like TV On the Radio and U2, but has apparently saved some of the coolest tricks for his own band). The band sounds tight, the production full and perfectly drab. So maybe it might seem like a dick move to criticize this record for giving a fuck, but when that white-hot feral intensity only rears its head ever-so-often, the unsubtle influences that anchor <i>Exploding Head</i> (JAMC, My Bloody Valentine, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen) often render songs pancake-flat. For example, on first listen, older stuff like the irrepressibly exciting ""To Fix the Gash in Your Head"" sounded like little more than Wall•E being crammed into a garbage disposal to the tune of ""Upside Down"", and still managed to be frighteningly arresting. Where here, new single ""In Your Heart"" doesn't offer much more than a very impressive facsimile of some of Ian McCullough and Co.'s darker imaginings, well-shaped and completely forgettable.</p>
<p>The technical stuff on the record is pretty solid through and through, the band always retaining a much-appreciated limberness even on wishy-washy cuts like ""Lost Feeling"". So when big standouts like ""Ego Death"" (rife with ripping guitars and Nick Cave worshipping sneer) and ""Everything Always Goes Wrong"" (a mean and moody sock-hop jam that contains some of biggest and best pedal work on the album), <i>Head </i>seems like a perfect follow-up, tidier but still as fierce. Yet it's genre-nursed stuff like the noodly post-punk of ""Exploding Head"" or the too cleverly rationed rising power-chord chugs of ""It Is Nothing"" that seem to best represent how quickly that fierceness can dissolve when song structures are laid this plain (albeit still kinda groovy). It soon becomes obvious how important that wall of coronary-clutching noise was, and how painfully rewarding it was to break through it. <i>Head</i> just doesn't put up much of a fight in that respect, revealing it's secrets too fast and too loose. It's more than a little greedy, but by the end of <i>Exploding Head</i>, you can't help but feel a little disappointed to be stuck with a bucket of cleaning products and no viscera to scrape off the walls.</p></div>"|13500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13500-exploding-head/|6.6|Zach Kelly

Adept at pulling off the delicate task of making legitimately unsettling, spooky music without sounding like a novelty, sipping from the BHP's skull-shaped chalice as the weather cools and the nights grow longer is a perfect seasonal accompaniment. So good work guy who schedules Temporary Residence record releases; you deserve a raise. What better way to enjoy my run-up to All Hallow's Eve festivities than with the band so overflowing with dread and gloom they made an album called <i>Amore Del Tropico</i> sound like one of David Lynch's cinematic nightmares?</p>
<p>No album title dissonance here, as Black Heart Procession return to the numerical nomenclature of their first three records with <i>Six</i>. But the name on the spine isn't really a tip-off about a return to the band's earlier, sparser approach-- rather, it seems like they just couldn't resist emphasizing the numerology of their sixth album, what with the obvious significance of six-in-triplicate (and yes, I couldn't resist the rating). Sure enough, the devil is all over <i>Six</i>, namedropped as early as the second track, ""Wasteland"", and most of the record's 13 (of course!) songs are drenched in gothic imagery that often veers towards the outright biblical.</p>
<p>There's virtually no activity, no matter how mundane, that can't be rendered Dantean by Pall Jenkins, Tobias Nathaniel, and their coven-mates. The extreme up and downs of love are described as no less than Heaven and Hell repeatedly, and scenes of execution and desolation predominate-- it's rock'n'roll for Cormac McCarthy. Singer Pall Jenkins doesn't just get dumped, he gets hung at the gallows and burned at the stake on ""Back to the Underground"". A nighttime city walk turns into a house of urban horrors on ""Rats"", a travel narrative of pimps and alleys and moon-devils that seems a rather harsh and unlikely judgment on the band's hometown of San Diego.</p>
<p>Musically, the setting is no less full of darkness and heavy fog. There are a few horror-soundtrack nods-- the obligatory musical saw and funeral-home organ making several appearances, the John Carpenter drum intro of ""Suicide""-- but BHP largely avoid horror-soundtrack cues or cheap scares. Much more subtle and unsettling is the band's piano, walking between beautiful and creepy, or the band's hi-low vocal tricks à la TV on the Radio, where in-control monotone cannot mask the high-pitched, near-hysteria wail hovering above. While nothing could be considered overwrought, one can't help but miss some of the empty space and creaky drum loops that were the cobwebs dressing up Jenkins' dark brooding on their earlier numbered records.</p>
<p>In other places, the Black Heart Procession avoid gimmickry by squeezing unexpected dread out of trad-indie sounds. There's an oddly glistening synth snaking through ""Witching Stone"", ""Rats"" has a sinuous bassline cobbled together from the scrap parts of ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"", and ""Forget My Heart"" sounds a helluva lot like... Spoon, who might be the last band I would ever describe as frightening. In more ornate moments, the eerie pizzicato of ""All My Steps"" demonstrates what they can do with a fuller sound, and more lush strings are employed to appropriately melodramatic effect on the hypnotic ""Liar's Ink"".</p>
<p>Yet the commendable atmospheric consistency aside, the relentless danse macabre might grow tiresome for the faint of heart, uninterrupted as it is by any islands of contrast. You know that point in a haunted house where you just kind of wish it was over, as the 15th chainsaw/hockey-mask guy jumps out at you from a nook in the plyboard? That's the feeling I get late in <i>Six</i>, when the album reaches a song called, flatly, ""Suicide"" and the heaven-and-hell imagery starts to wear out its welcome with a reprise on ""Last Chance."" For while, the Black Heart Procession does an excellent job of musically embodying October's primary mood, they'd do well to remember that it's a month made more bearable by the occasional flash of Indian summer.</p></div>"|13530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13530-six/|6.6|Rob Mitchum

So why is one album considered a masterpiece while the other belongs in the bottom end of the band's catalog, just above the tedious instrumental EPs and second-rate hardcore? For one thing, <i>Hello Nasty</i> lacks the energy of almost every other Beasties album. It's got all these sounds to work with, that little-bit-of-everything agglomeration that characterized the late-1990s underground's listening habits: electro, drum'n'bass, lounge, folk, turntablism, tropicalia, dub. Basically anything you'd find in the collection of a given member of Tortoise. But the further the album strays from straight-up hip-hop, the less excited it sounds to <i>do</i> anything with these new influences.</p>
<p>That makes it sound like a chore, and it is, albeit intermittently. At 22 tracks, <i>Hello Nasty</i> is less boundary-pushing, carefully collaged risk-taking than the excess that comes from unlimited home studio time and no fear of mercenary label owners or turncoat audiences. ""Song for the Man"" is the first real evidence of the trio's slide into overextended, self-satisfied slackness. When you take the kitchen-sink approach to making an album, you better make damn sure you bring your A-game to each idea you try. It's not like the Beasties lacked the chops or wit to turn ""Song for the Man"" into something worth listening to. And there's nothing wrong with froth for frat boys, provided there's a hook. But this little-too-laid-back hip-hop lite is barely a song. Even the Beastie's post-<i>Paul's</i> instrumental funk noodles had more bite.</p>
<p>It sounds all the weaker coming from a band whose prime draw was a exuberance, even mania. Sounding lazy rather than effortless or playful is a bad look for any band-- especially when you've previously prided yourself on proving a don't-give-a-fuck-attitude is compatible with hardcore studio experimentation and pop savvy. If the Beasties anticipated so much of the cut-and-paste hip-hop sound on <i>Paul's Boutique</i>, then why does their contribution to the downtempo glut, passably whimsical instrumental interlude ""Sneakin' Out the Hospital"", sound less like elders schooling their disciples than three aging magpies trying to keep up with the Ninja Tunes and Mo' Waxes?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Beasties fall into the usual traps that beset smart dudes with wide ears, a lot of heart, and plenty of industry clout: go-nowhere studio trickery (murky mumblefest ""Flowin' Prose""); eye-rolling heart-on-sleeve earnestness (MCA channeling George Harrison's high guru era on ""I Don't Know""); and of course your standard case of guest star-itis. If you can make it through the starstruck Boys' inability to reign in Lee ""Scratch"" Perry's ramblings on ""Dr. Lee, PhD"", well, you've got a stronger stomach for superstars kowtowing to their heroes than I do.</p>
<p>The good bits tend to stick to what the Beasties do best-- hyperactive rhyme-lobbing with more bad puns than a <i>MAD </i>magazine sub-editor and a brain-melting overload of one pop-cult ref after another-- with a pre-millennium dancefloor sheen. Thankfully pre-millennium dancefloors-- some of them, at least-- were increasingly in thrall to the recycled rigidity of old-school electro. So you get the Beasties keeping current by referencing the sounds that reared them when they were hip-hop obsessed hardcore kids. Unsurprisingly, the Boys rarely fumble when playing with a sound they'd been loving and perfecting over a decade.</p>
<p>It was also-- lest we forget-- the era of dunderheaded big beat and jungle's last gasp of crowd-pleasing jump-up dumbness. The Beasties were clearly trawling New York's import bins in the months before they laid down <i>Hello Nasty</i>, making the live-from-London remixes of tracks like Fatboy Slim's rework of ""Body Movin'"" (included on the bonus disc) almost superfluous. The original album tracks have all of the club-centric subgenres' antic energy, plus plenty of trademark Beasties stupid-unto-genius wordplay to make them more than dance comp filler. Ad-Rock rhyming, ""I'm the king of Boggle/ There is none higher"" with ""quagmire"" tends dangerously close to both being show-offy and plain cringeworthy. But I'm smiling as I roll my eyes, so I guess he wins.</p>
<p>Elsewhere things get odder, less predictable in the good way. ""The Negotiation Limerick File"" and ""Electrify"" don't fit the party-hard schema, but they're good reminders of the sonic diversity of the era's not-quite-mainstream hip-hop. And ""Three MC's and One DJ"", where Mix Master Mike offers a late-1990s turntablism master-class handily condensed to the length of a single, makes me long for that brief moment when <i>Wire</i>-reading avant-heads shared common ground with straight-up b-boys, the pleasure principle of hip-hop colliding with a noise head's preference for abstract expressionism.</p>
<p>The length of the bonus disc nearly rivals the original's length (21 tracks to the parent album's 22) and contains mostly cutting-room excerpts and drag-assy alternate mixes. Oh boy, an even more meandering ""dub mix"" of ""Dr. Lee, PhD""! There are plenty of short snippets of heavy, kitschy jams where the Beasties indulge their love for the muddy, slo-mo funk of the mid-70s. Get ready for a lot of blaxploitation-in-two-minutes-or-less like ""Dirty Dog"" and ""Aunt Jackie Poom Poom Delicious"". As far as the bonus instrumentals go, only the porn-ready mystical mumbo-jumbo minimalism of ""The Drone"" and the pensive quasi-rock of ""Creepin'"" justify running the tape past two minutes. And the bulk of the remixes by other artists are inessential, save the stop-and-go stutter-funk Colleone and Webb's ""Intergalactic"", compelling because it never quite seems to gel with the original.</p>
<p>For an album already in need of a stern editor's hand, the bonus disc just reinforces the impression that the <i>Hello Nasty</i>-era Beasties were bursting with interesting starting points they never bothered to see to completion. I remember loving <i>Hello Nasty</i> at the time in part <i>because</i> it was <i>so</i> much, even the undercooked bits and gimpy hippie schlock. Hell, there were still plenty of tracks left to justify the sticker shock of the just-prior-to-MP3s new CD. But it's hard hearing the positives in such a shapeless mush of half-formed sorta-songs with the weary ears of the post-iTunes playlist compiler. Let alone bothering to pay for it again in full. As an object in itself, we've got the album we've got, and that means assessing the whole unshapely mass/mess, the of-the-moment experiments with the actual tunes worth keeping a decade-plus later. And that whole, less a glorious mess than the exhausting sort, is the least essential Beasties disc until we hit the new millennium.</p></div>"|13527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13527-hello-nasty-deluxe-edition/|7.0|Jess Harvell

The comedian who once railed against the tedious self-satisfaction of AA members and new parents talks about how he's going to cut down on drinking and drugs for the sake of his soon-to-be-born child. He even opens <i>My Weakness Is Strong </i>with a funny but relatively low-key observation on the pitfalls of text messaging auto-complete features, wherein he recalls a moment where he responded to his wife's message of ""I love you"" with the accidental deployment of what he claims is his most-used sentence-starter, ""I hate"". For a man who closed <i>Feelin' Kinda Patton </i>with the most surreal tableaux of Robert Evans-narrated 1970s Hollywood sex imaginable and wrung a Terry Southern-rivaling amount of morbid, horror-struck comedy out of the mere existence of KFC's Famous Bowl in <i>Werewolves and Lollipops</i>, this album seems like a wary step towards maturation.</p>
<p>At least until you remember that ""maturation"" is typically most useful in comedy terms as a euphemism for ""becoming complacent and unfunny,"" which <i>My Weakness Is Strong</i> is all kinds of not. Everything that made Patton Oswalt the funniest stand-up comedian of the last five years is still present and accounted for on his latest album, and it'd be missing the mark to shortchange it under the assumption that he's softened. There's moments of giddy enthusiasm and bewilderment that occasionally temper Oswalt's finely-tuned sense of bitter, aggravated disappointment with himself and the rest of society; the most memorable bit of unbridled optimism is when he brings up the exquisitely nerdy realization that the election of Barack Obama means he doesn't have to go that far back in time to blow his younger self's mind. But when he ties the introduction of ""grocery robot"" technology to the downward spiral of a cashier's meth-addled life or frames his battle with depression in the context of being used as post-apocalyptic sex-currency, you can still feel all the serrated edges in his comedy digging into you.</p>
<p>The thing that's always made even the harshest and bleakest moments in Oswalt's comedy into repeat-listen material is his almost supernatural knack for warping the most uncomfortable concepts into perfectly pitched linguistic absurdity. Some comedians might stop at the evocative-enough concept of stumbling into an aborted orgy in the process of house-hunting, and Patton's eye for ridiculous detail-- the awkward teenage ""Craigslist hookup"" wearing the hastily-procured girls' ""Juicy"" sweatpants backwards, and his subsequent awkward exit out the back into an endless expanse of Hollywood Hills foliage-- serves it well, but it's the way he describes the house's atmosphere as ""fogbanks of twat mist"" and the forest-bound teenager as ""Fucksquatch"" that makes it stick in your head like a particularly memorable guitar riff. With Oswalt, it's not just his demeanor or his geeky obsessions that define him, it's the way he unspools these phrases for maximum rhythmic effect; I don't think I've come across any song lyric this year as inextricable from my skull as Oswalt phrases like ""Uncle Touchy's naked puzzle basement"" or ""free government blowjob robot.""</p>
<p>And while Patton can get a ton of mileage out of his unexpected detours into deconstructing the Christian/Pagan symbolism in Lucky Charms or going on one of his now-characteristic descriptions of horrifying fat-people foodstuffs, it's his ability to draw inspiration from tilled-to-death comedic soil-- like his air travel/baby/treadmill bits-- that reveal Patton as a bottomless well of cultural enthusiasm. And not just pop culture, though he's pretty damn near encyclopedic in that department, but something greater-- an observational sharpness that pushes his work above mere didja-ever-noticeisms. Oswalt's previous release, <i>Werewolves and Lollipops</i>, is a hard act to follow-- it's the one album I want to preserve for a disapproving future cruelly awaiting to pin our era's comedy on LOLcats and ""edgy"" ventriloquists-- and <i>My Weakness Is Strong </i>doesn't quite boast its predecessor's relentless momentum. But the safe, boring dad that Oswalt once threatened to become in order to make sure his kid would grow up to rebel? There's no sign of him anywhere.</p></div>"|13524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13524-my-weakness-is-strong/|7.7|Nate Patrin

Mean-spirited? Less than generous? Their songs all communicate an unfailingly chummy earnestness that stems from candid introspection and unbidden love for their fellow man, and perhaps more than their brotherly harmonies or their rambunctious take on string-band Americana, that sincerity is their chief appeal. Of late, however, the Avetts' self-reckoning has grown so overbearing that it borders on obsession and threatens to limit their musical range. <i>I and Love and You</i>, their sixth studio album, doesn't break from their monolithic solemnity, but actually intensifies it: The hook on ""Ten Thousand Words"" goes, ""Ain't it like most people, I'm no different, we love to talk on things we don't know about."" On ""The Perfect Space"", they sing in sharp harmony: ""I want to have friends who love me for the man I become, not the man that I was."" There's a similar potential yearbook quote in every song-- every verse, just about-- and after a while, you may begin to wish they'd get angry about something, or, god forbid, crack an ironic joke.</p>
<p><i>I and Love and You</i> is a crucial album for the band. One of the biggest grassroots success stories of the decade, they spent years self-releasing albums and self-promoting shows to gradually growing audiences, eventually signing to North Carolina indie label Ramseur before moving up to Sony/BMG/Columbia Records. For their major-label debut, the trio (which includes brothers Scott and Seth and unrelated bass player Bob Crawford) worked with producer Rick Rubin, whose involvement gives the album added critical and commercial cache. With a large and loyal fanbase, they could be as big as Dave Matthews and bring string-band rootsiness to the mainstream. Or not. One thing is for sure: After <i>I and Love and You</i>, they can no longer go back to being the Avett Brothers they once were.</p>
<p>As a major-label debut, the album plays to one set of their strengths while ignoring others. The Avetts continue to emphasize bold melodic lines, emphatic performances, and lyrics whose self-criticism is so magnanimous it becomes a form of self-praise. ""And It Spread"" moves from gentle to raucous the way more pedestrian bands do quiet-loud, and ""January Wedding"" is so delicate it nearly blows away in its own breeziness. These songs draw less from the celebratory energy of <i>Mignonette</i> and <i>Emotionalism</i>-- rambling albums whose spirited imperfections made them all the more endearing-- and more from the recent <i>Gleam</i> EPs, which showcased a calmer, more polite acoustic craftsmanship. That trend may predate Rubin's involvement, but here it sounds like a product of the Beard's approach to Americana, which is unerringly clean, sparse, and tasteful.</p>
<p>Every instrument sounds perfectly placed, and that's a shame because the Avetts got more mileage out of their rough edges than most bands this decade. Buffing away their rough edges and rowdy quirks, Rubin establishes a mood of intense pensiveness even on the first song, when they announce they're getting no sleep till Brooklyn. The title track builds carefully as the brothers ask the borough to welcome them, carefully adding an instrument or two with each verse until the song reaches its destination-- a big, cathartic finale. Most of the songs that follow employ a similar technique: opening with a soft acoustic intro, then inserting other sounds to underline the sentiments. It's effective until it becomes predictable, but later in the album, ""Laundry Room"" plays around with that formula, following a winding path from a gentle near-ballad (marred only by the lyric ""I am a breathing time machine"") as it transforms into a swirling bluegrass jam that's one of the album's finest moments.</p>
<p>There are surprisingly durable hooks on the stand-out ""Tin Man"" and the upbeat ""Slight Figure of Speech"", which, back to back, make the second half much livelier and more tenacious than the first. Rubin allows the Avetts to expand their sound and indulge these pop urges, but not always to great effect. With its jaunty piano theme and insistent screaming, ""Kick Drum Heart"" tries for Wilco but achieves Guster. Generally, there's a refinement to <i>I and Love and You</i> that seems slightly out of step for a group that has built an audience on performances and recordings that sound rawly spontaneous and heartfelt; breathlessly conveying their positive message has always been more crucial than deciding where to put the banjo or how prominent to make the strings. These songs, on the other hand, are more purposeful, more written, more professional. It's not that there's no room for such studio nuance in the Avetts' music, but it gives <i>I and Love and You</i> a quotidian sheen, making their signature sincerity seem sappy and much less special.</p></div>"|13478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13478-i-and-love-and-you/|5.8|Stephen M.

The former built its empire on a stridently anti-corporate ethos and faceless yet politically outspoken orchestral-rock collectives; the latter built theirs on sleazy sensationalism, crass humor, and hipster trendspotting. And yet, these two oppositional entities do share one common value: a love of Lullabye Arkestra.</p>
<p>That the Toronto duo have become the first band to release records on both Constellation and Vice's label subsidiary is a testament to their own unifying qualities: comprised of husband/drummer Justin Small and wife/bassist Kat Taylor-Small (that's them you hear screaming out the chorus on Fucked Up's ""Son the Father""), Lullabye Arkestra have parlayed their own holy matrimony into another, decidedly more unholy alliance-- namely, between sweaty 1960s Stax soul and 80s hardcore/speed metal. Not the most obvious attributes for a Constellation signee, but then Small had an easy in with the label: His other band, space-rock ensemble Do Make Say Think (for whom he plays guitar), are Constellation's longest running act. And if Lullabye Arkestra's emergence in 2002 initially posited them as an antidote to Toronto's prevailing collectivist music culture, by the time they recorded their 2006 Constellation release, <i>Ampgrave</i>, they had developed characteristics akin to those of their Can-indie compatriots-- i.e., crowding the stage with multiple string and horn players to lend their minimalist metal more textural depth.</p>
<p>But even without a global recession, Lullabye were due for a downsizing; lacking the means to tour with their auxiliary members, the duo found themselves with an album they could barely recreate live as a two-piece. No such problem with the band's Vice debut, <i>Threats/Worship</i>, on which the duo fill in any empty space by loading up on the sort of devastating drop-D riffs that have powered every great bass/drums two-piece from godheadSilo to Death From Above 1979, and screaming their lungs out. If <i>Ampgrave</i> lent Lullabye's tortured soul a B-movie, haunted-house ambiance, <i>Threats/Worship</i> is pure grindhouse grit-- ugly, brutal, yet thrilling as all hell.</p>
<p>And yet, even with the stripped-down set-up and brief, 36-minute run time, <i>Threats/Worship</i> still feels weighty and substantial, thanks to an epic, Black Flag-burning introduction, ""Get Nervous"", that effectively welcomes us into their nightmare and showcases the duo's ability to shift gears between slow-motion sludge and high-speed hysterics. Lullabye Arkestra know that, given their low overhead, the slightest dynamic variations go a long way-- the subtle synth swirls lurking in the background of circle-pit stoker ""Surviving the Year of Wolves"" (featuring guest barking from ex-Cursed frontman Chris Colohan); the Tony Iommi accents that punctuate the fist-pump chorus of ""We Fuck the Night""; the echo-effected vocals and hypnotic riff repetition that inject ""Fog Machine"" with a psychedelic expanse; the surprise ending of ""This Is a Storm"", which fools us into thinking it's fading out before returning for one last, <i>Carrie</i>-style scare.</p>
<p>Where there was once a cheeky quality to the Smalls' vocal interplay-- part Ike and Tina, part Mickey and Mallory-- <i>Threats/Worship</i> doesn't play up any kind of he-said/she-said sexual tension. Rather, their unison, hoarse-voice howls convey a genuine, shared feeling of release and solidarity. This is no more apparent than on ""Voodoo"", a rerecording of the first song the Smalls ever wrote together-- when the duo start maniacally shrieking, ""baby baby baby!"" you're not sure if they want to have one or eat one. Clocking in at just 44 seconds, the song both heralds Lullabye's return to their original two-piece formation, while also serving as a signpost for how much they've evolved. The lesson here: The couple that stays together slays together.</p></div>"|13513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13513-threatsworship/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Performing in L.A. as DJ Haircut, Michigan-born hip-hop fan Drew Cohen thought it would be interesting to record his own sample-friendly music. His complicated form of crate digging eventually attracted the ears of Stones Throw founder Peanut Butter Wolf. According to a <i>Real Detroit Weekly</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> interview<i>, </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Cohen even turned to the adolescent-approved porn name formula-- his middle name and the street he grew up on-- as a device for creating his sweet soul singer alter ego. When he received a recording contract for what he thought was a single release, he realized Wolf wanted a full-length and had to bunker down, since he ended up writing and recording just about every part on the album himself. It's not as authentic and gritty a bio as those found in the liner notes of many soul reissues. But Hawthorne's on-the-fly origins are fitting for this release, alternately carefree, charming, and sometimes as green as the 29-year-old crooner.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Hawthorne's smooth voice draws deeply from the work of legends like Smokey Robinson, Curtis Mayfield, and the Stylistics' Russell Thompkins, Jr. While his naming convention may suggest otherwise, Hawthorne never gets near any R-rated love affairs. Posing in a study surrounded by ephemera on the cover, he sort of looks like a lost Tenenbaum, and plays up a lovelorn, sweet angle throughout the album.</p>
<p>He shines brightest on straightforward tracks where he doesn't overplay his hand, instead folding his innocent vocals into catchy, energetic, and unfussy arrangements. He can't match the instrumental chops of Daptone bands or Mark Ronson projects, so he sticks to the basics. Coasting on driving backbeats, feel-good horn and sax melodies, and pleas for passion, ""Your Easy Lovin' Ain't Pleasin' Nothin'"", ""One Track Mind"", and ""Make Her Mine"" are streamlined soul, catchy singles that do right by their obvious 1960s influences. ""The Ills"" nails a Mayfield vibe out of the gate, threading fluid congas among empowering choruses and lyrics about broken levees and single-parent families. ""A Strange Arrangement"" and ""Just Ain't Gonna Work Out"", mid-tempo numbers with more falsetto and apologies for walking away from relationships, showcase blended vocal harmonies. Other than the occasional clockwork backbeat, the closest this comes to Cohen's hip-hop roots is when he slurs ""scared"" so it rhymes with ""bird.""</p>
<p>The lovelorn singer doesn't always handle being on the receiving end of a break up quite as well. While lamenting on ""Just Ain't Gonna Work Out"", his syrupy vocals stall a bit, and ""Green Eyed Love"" lumbers along on a half-hearted organ melody and slack rhythm. Hawthorne clearly has the ability to integrate and recreate his influences in his own compositions; it would be revelatory if he added more of his own signature sounds and soul into the music.</p></div>"|13508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13508-a-strange-arrangement/|6.9|Patrick Sisson

Where most other art is in some way primary, an experience of its own, an original film score is secondary-- it serves something larger. For this reason, a lot of soundtrack music doesn't stand on its own absent the film. It simply isn't meant to do that. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, longtime collaborators in the Bad Seeds, understand this-- their collaborative film scores are sensitive to the needs of scene and character, but they also create scores so richly textured and evocative that they work divorced from their films.</p>
<p><i>White Lunar</i> gathers two discs' worth of the pair's soundtrack work, as well as four short archival instrumentals named for craters on the moon. The work is understandably different from what they do in the Bad Seeds, hewing closer to Ellis' other band, the Dirty Three. The discs divide the music thematically: Disc One contains pieces from the scores of John Hillcoat's <i>The Proposition</i> (2005), Andrew Dominik's <i>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</i> (2007), and Hillcoat's as-yet unreleased adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's <i>The Road</i>; Disc Two is filled with more under-the-radar work, including the four archival pieces, music from Geoffrey Smith's 2007 documentary <i>The English Surgeon</i>, a film about Dr. Henry Marsh's work training Ukrainian neurosurgeons, and music from Matthew Watson's recent documentary <i>The Girls of Phnom Penh</i>, which follows three Cambodian sex workers in an attempt to reveal the country's ""virginity trade.""</p>
<p>Absent any particularly uplifting subject matter, the discs naturally adopt an elegiac tone, dominated by sparse piano and Ellis' often thrilling violin playing. The first disc is remarkably unified, playing almost like a long album in spite of the three sources. The six-minute ""Song for Bob"", which features Ellis layered into a whole string section and accompanied by nothing more than a bit of bass and piano, captures the essence of the inner conflict of a man confronted by the ugly reality of a man he idolized, while the theme from <i>Jesse James</i> is pensive and lovely. <i>The Proposition</i> theme features hard scraping from Ellis over a sickly drone, building a tone of dread for the violence to come. A couple of vocal songs stick out-- ""Gun Thing"" is so understated, the vocals barely feel different from an instrument, but Cave's wounded croak does much for ""The Rider Song"". He whispers sinisterly on ""The Rider No. 2"", doubling himself with muted singing as the music squeals queasily around him, but the duo eases back a bit on the next track, ""Martha's Dream"", where Ellis quotes an old Dirty Three song in the second half.</p>
<p>Obviously, it's impossible to say yet how well the music from <i>The Road</i> matches the tone of the film, but if this is any indication, it will be bleak, beautiful, and deliberate. I confess I've not seen the documentaries scored on Disc Two, but Cave and Ellis have developed a distinctive soundtrack voice that carries over into these films. <i>The English Surgeon</i> features a clutch of brief, gently shifting soundscapes led by solo violin, certainly much prettier than titles like ""Brain Retractor"" and ""Rat's Tooth Forceps"" might imply (though the latter has a nervous undercurrent of overdubbed violin). <i>Phnom Penh</i> is more varied: ""Srey Leak"" is an eerie, creeping intro to the disc, and ""Me Nea"" is an emotionally collapsed short piece. Finally, the four archival pieces reveal some of the pair's textural explorations-- ""Magma"" is the most interesting, featuring Ellis singing, pitch-shifted and layered into something alien and only fleetingly recognizable as a voice.</p>
<p>Cave and Ellis clearly share an aesthetic sympathy that allows them to key in together on the emotional undertow of their subjects, crafting haunting atmospheres to reflect the sweeping cinematography of the feature films they soundtrack as well as the inner lives of the documentary subjects. So does it hold up on its own? Mostly, it does. This doesn't eclipse their non-soundtrack work by any stretch of the imagination, and it occasionally lapses into texture that longs for its visual component, but by and large it's an involving listen that telegraphs a sense of emotional and geographic space. It's good to have it all in one place.</p></div>"|13505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13505-white-lunar/|7.6|Joe Tangari

It's a backhanded compliment, acknowledging that everything he does is a vital listen but also that it would be tougher to overlook the LP's glaring flaws had it come from someone who hadn't built up a decade of goodwill through his musical work and personal transparency. No wonder Kid Cudi threatened to retire before he even put out <i>Man on the Moon</i>: <i>The End of Day</i>-- his debut essentially exists because of a record that drew most of its power from a singular cult of personality, and that's a lot to live up to.</p>
<p>Cudi co-wrote several tracks on <i>808s </i>(most notably guesting on ""Welcome to Heartbreak""), and combined with hits in Drake's ""Best I Ever Had"" and Cudi's own ""Day 'N' Nite"", the commercial resiliency of that album proved that fad or not, this sadsack backpack stuff is here to stay.  But whereas <i>808s </i>was a record about a very public figure attempting a retreat he'd be incapable of sustaining, <i>Man on the Moon </i>uses quotidian, lonely stoner turmoil as a means of introduction.</p>
<p>Now, I still check for Atmosphere projects and I've got a functioning knowledge of the Get Up Kids' discography, so I can't knock <i>Man on the Moon </i>for skewing emo. And we won't play the hipster card, since this record lives and dies by its lyrics as much as any document of spit-these-bars formalism. The problem is how these two impulses feed off each other in all the wrong ways, with Cudi inverting the songwriting process so that a supposed pursuit of honesty is rendered predatory and manipulative.  ""I got some issues that nobody can see,"" goes the hook to ""Soundtrack 2 My Life"", and it's a boast as grandiose as you're likely to hear in 2009. Throughout, Cudi's issues could not be rendered in a more clumsy or obvious way, blowing up every slight perceived or real (""had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them"") into trials of such mythical proportions that it needs a bogus four-part ""plot"" (Cudi is sad, does mushrooms, starts to get famous, is still sad) and narration from Common.</p>
<p>Cudi also slathers his verses with a flat warble that Auto-Tune was made to salvage. It would be numbing enough on its own, but nearly every 30 seconds there's some terrifyingly underwritten lyric to jolt you into sharp pangs of embarrassment. He's referred to as ""our hero"" throughout <i>Man on the Moon</i>, and his superpower is managing to convey unlimited amounts of :-( while staying firmly in his vocab-stunted ""sorrow""-""tomorrow""/ ""room""-""moon"" wheelhouse of rhymes. ""Look at me/ You tell me just what you see/ Am I someone whom you may love/ Or enemy,"" goes a particularly Brandon Flowers-like line of the otherwise effectively spare ""Mr. Solo Dolo (Nightmare)"". As far as rap metaphors go, Cudi is Katrina with no FEMA: ""I live in a cocoon/ Opposite of Cancun/ Where it is never sunny/ Dark side of the moon,"" or, even more pointedly, ""Gray clouds up above, man/ Metaphor to my life, man.""</p>
<p>But what's most frustrating of all is that Cudi can make <i>Man  on the Moon </i>feel like a missed opportunity instead of a non-starter. His hooks have a way of burrowing into your brain-- you already know the deal with ""Day 'N' Nite"", and ""Simple As..."" bears a strange resemblance to ""Semi-Charmed Life"" but damn if I'll be able to forget it any time soon. He's also got a really keen ear for sounds: ""Mr. Solo Dolo"" nods to the warped Orientalism from <i>Silent Shout</i>'s quieter tracks and you almost wish the tangible warmth emanating from the strings on ""In My Dreams"" would reveal itself in something other than a somnambulant intro. Cruelest of all, the album goes a long ways towards redeeming itself with its final two tracks-- ""Hyyerrr"" nods to the haziest productions from DJ U-Neek while ""Up Up &amp; Away"" unabashedly makes its alt-rock intentions known with jarringly optimistic acoustic guitars.</p>
<p>It makes you think things could get better if Cudi manages to cheer up in the future (and why not? <i>Man on the Moon </i>is the rare record in 2009 that's beating sales expectations), but then we might just end up with more songs like ""Enter Galactic"" and ""Make Her Say"", the ""Poker Face"" remake where Cudi, 'Ye, and Common play misogynistically against type for laughs and somehow make you feel bad for Lady Gaga. Even with ""Stapleton Sex"" and ""Gihad"" making the rounds recently, it's probably still the most noxious sex rap I've managed to hear in some time.</p>
<p>Cudi would like to think this record is critic-proof, or at least that's what I cull from his decision to paraphrase the ""there will always be somebody who will shoot down any dream"" line from Kanye's ""Bring Me Down"". But that number up there isn't a judgment of Cudi's pain, as much as it is an ability to express it-- being misunderstood in the Midwest and lost in the big city will never fail to inspire phenomenal art in twentysomethings, but Cudi too often assumes some sort of higher ground even though his self-pity is flaunted no differently than any other tacky rapper accessory.</p></div>"|13504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13504-man-on-the-moon-the-end-of-day/|4.1|Ian Cohen

<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Milwaukee at Last!!!</i> is Rufus Wainwright's second live album, but it might as well be his first. In 2007, <i>Rufus Does Judy Live at Carnegie Hall</i> documented his song-for-song and nearly banter-for-banter restaging of Judy Garland's infamous 1961 performance, and Wainwright's slavish devotion to her performance made it an act of impersonation rather than interpretation. He was living his own dream of pop stardom; it was an odd affair, since his primary audience ultimately was himself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Wainwright hints at that same stagey role-playing early on in <i>Milwaukee at Last!!!</i> As the audience at the Pabst Theater applauds his grandiloquent version of opener ""Release the Stars"", he declares, with mock humility, ""Thank you. I wasn't expecting that."" Of course he was expecting that. Who doesn't expect applause? But soon the show loosens up and Wainwright plays the role he was born to play: himself. He runs through ""Going to a Town"" and ""Sanssouci"" with all the debonair insouciance that he made his name on, and his agile seven-man backing band smoothly inflates the bombast of ""Release the Stars"" and ""Rules and Regulations"". It loses a bit of steam in the second set, when he gives too much time over to big, plodding numbers like the medley ""Not Ready to Love/Slideshow"" and a cover of the early 19th century Irish ballad ""Macushla"" But he recovers with closer ""Gay Messiah"", a <i>Want Two</i> stand-out whose porn-religious imagery makes it a fitting closer. Where do you go from there?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">At times <i>Milwaukee at Last!!!</i> sounds like a retrospective of Wainwright's 2000s, beginning--  sadly-- not with 2000's career-high <i>Poses</i> but with the <i>Want</i> albums, which introduced a more operatic, more staged approach. That headier style, which at its best seemed like the logical extension of his lyrics about gay desire, confusion, and contentment, actually increased his audience rather than drive away listeners, which I guess makes him something of a straight icon. Of course <i>Milwaukee at Last!!!</i> only seems broader than it is: Almost every track, it turns out, is from <i>Release the Stars</i>, and the audience doesn't seem to mind.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A second version of the album includes a DVD of the entire performance-- all 23 songs and stage banter excised from the CD, along with performances from the Montreux Jazz Festival-- and that's the better way to experience Wainwright live. Visuals are crucial: His outfit looks like a Nudie suit for Max Headroom and shows off his well-tanned torso; his band treat the large collection of broaches like religious icons; the enormous black-and-white American flag backdrop gives ""Going to a Town"" extra impact; and, perhaps most importantly, crowd shots show the audience hanging on his every note. Between songs, Wainwright boasts about having ""incredible sex"" with Brandon Flowers, and backstage between sets he jokes with his boyfriend Jörn while stripping down for a costume change. He seems much more psyched to be in front of a camera than in front of a mic.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">More crucially, the DVD contains some of the best songs, which throws the album proper into sharp relief. Where the shorter tracklist favors ponderous numbers, the full show intersperses those songs with the rollicking ""Between My Legs"" (featuring Wainwright perched atop Jörn's shoulders), the booming ""Do I Disappoint You"", the wittily apocryphal ""The Art Teacher"". It's not just that it's a longer setlist, but a broader one, more well-rounded and revealing, although both the CD and the DVD end with Wainwright, now clad in lederhosen, blowing the same sweetly sincere smooch to the audience, which may be the only way to top ""Gay Messiah"".</p>

""Mixed &amp; fucked by TNV and Matt Horseshit,"" it reads, that last bit referring to the Columbus trio's über-pessimistic pal and Psychedelic Horseshit frontdude (with a nod to Columbus noise linchpin Mike Rep Hummel). You pick up on the ""fucked"" pretty quick when you're listening to Times New Viking; of this newish lo-fi crop, they're the finest melodicists by some margin, melodies they're more than willing to step on in service of the skronk. But there's no such note on <i>Born Again Revisited</i>, the band's fourth, nor is there <i>Rip It Off</i>'s urging to ""please play loud."" Indeed, <i>Born Again Revisited</i> is Times New Viking's highest-fidelity album to date, an intentional playing down of the things that've made them among the leading lights of this nebulous, seemingly dwindling movement. Whatever their motives, <i>Born Again Revisited </i>finds these old pros hanging out in the red, further refining their sound to buck the trends that have built up around them.</p>
<p>Because they take such pains to obscure vocals, blow out drums, make one guitar sound like 40, and generally do everything in their power to piss off your speakers, it's easy to miss what sharp, funny, self-deprecating songwriters Times New Viking can be, a failing <i>Born Again Revisited </i>seems hell-bent on solving. Ignoring their obvious gifts as tunesmiths is just a touch harder here, as practically everything's been given a bit more space to itself, the enveloping crunch of <i>Rip It Off</i> replaced with a fizzy, reedy haze that puts a tad more focus on the songs themselves. Although every<i> </i>Times New Viking<i> </i>release to date has sported at least one truly knockout tune, the highs here might be the band's most dizzying yet.</p>
<p>There's shitgaze anthem ""No Time, No Hope"", one of the year's catchiest bumouts-- a little organ-driven fury propelled by Beth Murphy and Adam Elliott's weirdly complimentary vocals and a burst of pure energy. There's the streaky ""Move to California""-- a maudlin request if there ever was one-- middle-fi in its production and resigned in its apparent yearning. And there's the 1-2 of the plaintive, beautiful Murphy-led ""These Days"" and the ripcord Rollins dedication ""(No) Sympathy"", the band's single finest stretch on wax. All four tunes-- and a few others besides, like the weary, hilariously titled ""2/11 Don't Forget""-- take the obvious pleasures of <i>Rip It Off</i>'s ""(My Head)"" and ""Faces on Fire"", strip back some of the peal, turn the sloganeering outward and turn up the lyrical detail, and emerge triumphant. Erm, as triumphant as a song called ""No Time, No Hope"" can be, I suppose.</p>
<p>Beyond a slight downward nudge of the volume knob, the biggest difference between <i>Born Again Revisited</i> and its predecessors is a lean towards the punk side of pop-punk; the tempos are by and large faster, the shout-along choruses more shibboleth and slightly less stoney, the little flashes of melody harder to grasp. Elements of either have shown themselves all over the TNV discography, but whereas on <i>Rip It Off</i> they'd fill in the gaps between the big numbers with sketches of pop tunes-- generally little more than an organ bleat, a guitar rumble, and Beth Murphy's wail, but insidiously catchy nonetheless-- here they're filling the space with scrappy little screamers that seem to pass by faster than even their brief runtimes. It's a pretty good look-- not far in spirit from the 10 terrific, tumult-ridden minutes of last year's <i>Stay Awake</i> EP. There's still a great deal of melody, and small moments-- the steamy organ crunch on the title track, the slap of Adam Elliott's drum on woozy singalong ""Half Day in Hell""-- stand out, but the peaks tower over the valleys here, and as such, the album's internal logic occasionally feels wonky, lopsided. Whereas <i>Rip It Off</i>, after the initial learning curve, was a fairly easy album to sink into, <i>Born Again Revisited</i> is lumpier, dodgier, and in some ways even more fucked.</p>
<p>Good on them, you know? Now would've been a pretty good time for Times New Viking to crank out a mess of beery bouncers or thinly-veiled Clean covers and let that Matador money roll in. But that's pretty much exactly what <i>Born Again Revisited</i> isn't. Instead, we've got yet another standoffishly catchy, completely uncompromising bit of burnout ephemera from a band that predates a revived trend I'm certain they feel themselves outside of. <i>Born Again Revisited</i> is a deeply rewarding record and a worthy entry in a pretty stellar catalog, sure, but coming at a time when everybody's fucking up their tunes and only a few are really doing it well, it's reassuring to know we weren't silly for getting excited about this stuff all over again.</p></div>"|13525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13525-born-again-revisited/|8.1|Paul Thompson

One collection of EPs and two full albums later (and newly signed to TBD Records), the band has pretty much stayed the course, adding some orchestral flourishes to a few songs on new LP <i>Threadbare</i>, but generally hewing to its acoustic guitar/secular spiritual awakening formula.</p>
<p>That steadiness includes recycling older songs like jangly Celtic jig-like ""Tree Bones"", which has now appeared on three different Port O'Brien releases. Like half of <i>Threadbare</i>'s tracks (most of them produced by Earlimart's Aaron Espinoza), including ""Oslo Campfire"" and ""Leap Year"", ""Tree Bones"" winds its way to a rousing refrain that lyrically and musically promotes an optimistic combo of self reliance and a little help from your friends. If that sounds facile, it actually isn't. And if Port O'Brien's general vibe isn't as <i>au courant</i> in 2009 as it was in 2006, the band has firmly established the group-hug aesthetic as their own and proven that they're no trend chasers.</p>
<p>""Band"" is a bit of a misnomer, though. At Port O'Brien's core are part-time musicians Van Pierszalowski and Cambria Goodwin, who work every summer in Alaska-- he on his dad's commercial salmon fishing boat and she as a baker in little Larsen Bay's only cannery. Unlike say, the Decemberists, Port O'Brien earn their seafaring references the old-fashioned way, and the constant stream of swells and salt water never come across as affected grabs at working-class or folk-tradition authenticity. The duo live the remainder of the year in Northern California and add temporary band members as needed for recording and touring. They recruited Papercuts' Jason Quever-- increasingly the Bay Area's go-to guy for touring, session work, and engineering-- to produce approximately half of <i>Threadbare</i>. Quever typically wraps his own bedroom pop in muffled melancholy, and his cabin-fevered touch is suited to the record's more emotionally nuanced, Goodwin-sung numbers, like the bookend variations of ""High Without the Hope"", and the dirgey ""(((Darkness Visible)))"". Goodwin's brother died just as Port O'Brien were starting to work on the album, and while death doesn't overwhelm the record, it's a constant presence, sitting quietly in the corner and informing Goodwin's sweet but weary voice.</p>
<p>But these guys just aren't the types to dwell on any kind of downer. The warm, punchy ""Love Me Through"", sequenced immediately after ""Darkness"", announces, ""Now it's time for healing."" And on the record's best earworm, ""Sour Milk/Salt Water"", a relatively big-sounding production of digital manipulation and swollen multi-tracked vocals, Pierszalowski sings, ""I don't have a trust fund/ If the luck don't come/ It could be a cold one/ All through the winter,"" with a characteristically blasé shrug. If you're sick of hearing privileged kids whine about their non-problems (or celebrate their privilege), <i>Threadbare</i>'s a breath of fresh, sea air.</p></div>"|13526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13526-threadbare/|7.2|Amy Granzin

<p>More than a few of these singles came from Philadelphia's Dayve Hawk in the guise of either Memory Cassette, Weird Tapes, or Memory Tapes. To this point, he'd served as something of a microcosm for this sound, which has created intriguingly hazy, wistful but beat-informed one-offs and EPs, but nothing weighty enough to get it past ""something we did that one summer,"" as if it were a road trip or ill-fated romance recalled years later. That was before <i>Seek Magic</i>, a record of achingly gorgeous dance-pop that captures both the joy of nostalgia and the melancholic sense that we're grasping for good times increasingly out of reach.</p>
<p>Initially, <i>Seek Magic</i>'s power derives from an intensely personalized ability to unlock hidden chambers in our memory banks. The half-submerged guitars that introduce ""Swimming Field"" suggest this is as a soundtrack for a restless evening, but between its F-G chord progression and aqueous thumb-piano and panflute synths, I'm reminded of scorching July days vibing out to Wilco's <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>. Instrumental breaks ""Pink Stones"" and ""Run Out"" recall the unconventional beauty of Apehx Twin's <i>Richard D. James Album</i>. ""Green Knight"" smacks of Police's ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" in its verse and any number of mid-80s light funk with its guitar licks, the sneaker squeak in the instrumental break is one of the most evocative found sounds I've heard in a while.</p>
<p><i>Seek Magic </i>is something of an inhabitable universe that proves there's far more to Hawk's sound than a way with reverb and passing familiarity with dance loops.  The rubber-smacks-road beat of ""Bicycle"" would be content to mirror its titular vehicle, but nearly every minute packs some sort of detailed compositional surprise: the widescreen breakthrough where Hawk's androgynous vocals shake lo-fi two minutes in, the bass breakdown that soon rights itself into the second half's backbone, and the choral coda that lays a euphoric vocal sigh over wave-running New Order guitars. By comparison, ""Plain Material"" is streamlined, but not by much-- the way Hawk's voice hits the fuzzed-out guitar chords, you might think this was an unearthed Flaming Lips track, and at first, it sounds like the first time on <i>Seek Magic </i>that he'll adhere to a standard verse-chorus structure. It does, but only after a drum beat cribbed straight from Organized Noize turns in a bridge of teen screams imported from <i>In Ghost Colours</i>' nastier breakdowns.</p>
<p>And yet in <i>Seek Magic</i>'s centerpieces, you sense a nocturnal unease usually attributed to more spare albums. ""Stop Talking"" could've been content to ride out its gummy bass riff to infinity, but it morphs through so many phases in its seven minutes that the half-time post-rock finale doesn't feel tacked-on. On the following song, ""Graphics"", Hawk offers an unnervingly lonely sentiment-- ""I don't even recognize the sound of your voice, the feel of your touch, you could be alone even though I'm here by your side."" Lyrics are mere suggestions through most of <i>Seek Magic</i>, but Hawk lays out an ""I can't go on, I'll go on"" vibe throughout. One second, he sighs ""this is the last time"" and immediately thereafter, ""one more time, baby, one more time."" It's a sentiment that's underpinned great works of art from Daft Punk (""One More Time"" natch), F. Scott Fitzgerald (<i>This Side of Paradise</i>), Kanye West (""Why can't life always be this easy?""), and um, Old Milwaukee-- the times where you think ""it doesn't get any better than this,"" and it's simultaneously the happiest and saddest thing you can say.</p></div>"|13451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13451-seek-magic/|8.3|Ian Cohen

Ten years ago in this publication, Mark Richardson called them ""the perfect sonic evolution for rock,"" praising their ability to meld the noise prevalent in experimental music with the organic textures of folk as if it were the most natural thing. A decade on, that's still accurate-- Tim Rutili, Ben Massarella, Jim Becker, Joe Adamik, and the various other musicians in Califone's orbit have managed to take their original aesthetic coup and make an incredibly consistent nine-album career out of it. They've been so thoroughly on point on each of their records that earlier this summer, when I happened to be with several fans of the band, no one named the same album as his or her favorite.</p>
<p>That kind of catalog, so reliable but lacking that one standout masterpiece, makes a band easy to take for granted, and there's a temptation to see <i>All My Friends Are Funeral Singers</i> as Another Califone Record. This is especially true on the first few listens, as all those familiar broken textures rush toward you and that one song Tim Rutili has figured out a million ways to write plays again and again. But as you learn the landscape of the album, it becomes clear that Another Califone Record really is a high compliment, and that they can continue to ply the same ground with the same success because that ground is so versatile.</p>
<p>This album is a companion to a feature-length film of the same title, which the band will present and accompany live during a tour next year. Unlike Califone's previous live soundtrack sessions, though, this one is comprised of composed songs, not spontaneous instrumental improv. I can't say how these songs play into Rutili's screenplay, but they stand quite well on their own-- <i>All My Friends</i> follows <i>Roots and Crowns</i> as a cohesive collection that sounds caught between a future of broken machines and a rural past of manual labor. Califone's never been the type of band to write melodies you can sing along with, and this is no exception-- Rutili's soft and ragged singing is, as ever, another repeated element, interlocking with the rough acoustic guitar playing, scraping violin, junkyard percussion, and scouring electronics to create something hypnotic.</p>
<p>""Giving Away the Bride"" is one of the most radical deconstructions of normal rock production in the band's catalog, eschewing even their normal roughly recorded acoustic guitars for a spaced-out beat and a monster of a distorted electronic bass figure, over which Rutili floats dreamily, intoning like a blues singer from the 1930s who got lost and tripped into the 21st century. The otherworldliness is so well-developed that it's genuinely startling when the piano drops almost four minutes in or the live drums take up the rhythm a minute after that. If the band had hits, this would be among the greatest.</p>
<p>The rest of the tracklist is something like the band's discography as a whole-- fascinating but hard to boil down to a favorite. The title track harks back a bit to <i>Roomsound</i> highlight ""Bottles and Bones (Shades and Sympathy)"" with a similarly bright, surging rush, while ""Ape-Like"" is a stomping hoedown flecked with banjo, fiddle, a sprightly organ theme, and, naturally, a bit of droning feedback. And then the band's odd tribute to Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel alternates front-porch jams and group singing with an unusually straight instrumental rock section that's undercut by a clicking, spluttering electric guitar solo. It's hard to think of any other band that combines such disparate elements so naturally, but it all fits together here.</p>
<p>So yes, <i>All My Friends Are Funeral Singers</i> is just another Califone album, but it's also a reminder of just what a special thing that is. They've carved a place in the rock landscape by discovering a previously ignored way of building a record and perfecting it over time through repetition. In my mind, it puts them in a lineage that includes bands like Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis, and This Heat, not sonically but artistically. If you're already switched on to them, you have to hear this. If you're not, well, what's keeping you? The debate over which Califone record is their best just got even more complicated.</p></div>"|13491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13491-all-my-friends-are-funeral-singers/|8.1|Joe Tangari

Their earliest singles, EPs, and CD-Rs were promising, with an immediately identifiable aesthetic and an obvious talent in singer/leader Nika Roza Danilova and her enormous voice. Though there were hints of more melodic directions on her earlier work (see ""Nativity"" from <i>New Amsterdam</i>), they were pulled in a few different directions, between structure and atmosphere, or vulnerable longing and stark, theatrical wailing. Their influences were impeccable, and the music, in nodding to avant-garde and proto-goth forbearers while using back-in-vogue bargain-basement production, sounded both familiar and fresh.</p>
<p>But <i>The Spoils</i> is much more than an exercise in reverence. No doubt that this record is a little gauzy-sounding, but it's not just making something sound new by making it sound shittier-- this is a potent mix of layered and otherworldly vocals, muddy electronics, and storefront-church keyboards that congeal until it's hard to pick out where one instrument ends and the other begins. When the tension swells, there's no volume that gets turned up or pedal that's kicked; it just suddenly feels more anxious, often terribly so. The muffled industrial beat of ""Six Feet (From My Baby)"" sounds like someone dragging student desks up the stairs, with watery drones and Danilova's powerful wail. It's familiar ground for the group, until the synths come in at the minute mark with a brief melody, setting up a push-pull dynamic between a familiar swoon and an anchorless anxiety in the verses.</p>
<p>Even as the record veers away from songs and structure toward creepier pieces that concentrate on mood and tone, the music never loses its visceral impact. The backward effects and wordless upper registers Danilova explores on ""Sinfonia and the Shrew"" are as compelling as they are disorienting, and the piano from the fragile interlude ""Lullaby in Tongues"" is even pretty, while closing tracks ""In Hiding From the Crow"" and ""Tell It to the Willow"" are as unsettling as intended. But when the album's haunted feeling sneaks in an emotion like yearning, it moves from compelling pastiche to a sucker-punch to the gut. <i>The Spoils</i> is compelling throughout, but the peak comes much later in its runtime, with ""Smirenye"" and especially ""Clay Bodies"". The distorted keys of the former sound like chimes over Danilova's sweetened vocals and the song's dogged mid-tempo beat, and the simple wedding-march piano of ""Clay Bodies"" is overwhelmed by clattering percussion-- though none of it ever distracts from the vocals. Nearly anything Danilova sings sounds like a matter of life or death, especially so on these later tracks; the words are almost beside the point.</p>
<p>Yes, some will lose patience for the scrappy bedroom/basement production on display here. But that's no reason to preclude anyone from hearing <i>The Spoils</i>; the intensity of its emotion is real, and given its theatrical roots, it never veers into cartoonish exaggeration or caricature. Danilova exhaustively charts these emotions while creating temples out of stray sonic parts to house them in, creating something distinctive out of sounds often explored and emotions commonly felt.</p></div>"|13487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13487-the-spoils/|7.6|Jason Crock

Under the guise of Plush, Hayes has vacillated from ascetic sparseness (relying almost exclusively on piano for his debut <i>More You Becomes You</i>) to brimming excess (for the densely-populated follow-up <i>Fed</i>). The apparent disdain for temperance has served him well artistically, though it has also resulted in numerous financial setbacks and caused lengthy delays between albums. Hayes reportedly racked up a near-hundred-grand debt financing the Steve Albini-engineered <i>Fed;</i> to make matters worse, he was ultimately unable to secure it a domestic release. Not counting 2004's stripped-down version of <i>Fed</i>, titled <i>Underfed</i>, Hayes has managed to release only three albums in total since his debut single in 1994, only one of which (the debut) received distribution in the States.</p>
<p>Hayes' new album, <i>Bright Penny</i>, follows last year's excellent single, ""Take a Chance"", a breezily nostalgic slice of blue-eyed soul. The euphoric lightness of ""Chance"" suggested that Hayes had a dramatic shift in store for album #3. As different as both <i>More You</i> and <i>Fed</i> are, they remain united by Hayes' meticulous approach to songwriting and recording. The seriousness and naked ambition of both clearly mark them as products of Hayes, despite being on opposite ends of the stylistic spectrum. Even <i>More You</i>, which, according to Hayes, had been constructed to sound like it was recorded in a single take, could never be mistaken for effortless.</p>
<p>Hayes has indeed lightened up with <i>Bright Penny</i>, making it arguably his most significant departure to date. As if to underscore, <i>Bright Penny</i> is credited to ""Liam Hayes and Plush."" That's apt: As upbeat as <i>Penny</i> is, Hayes still has trouble making a clean break from the past. Many of the songs bear the weight of over-studied arrangements typical of Plush. Hayes' fussy, exacting touch in the studio tended to work with the somber, downbeat tone of his prior albums, lending them the feel of hard-won victories. But the tack routinely clashes with effervescent <i>Bright Penny</i>, making the album's cheeriness sound oddly labored.</p>
<p>The album gets off to an auspicious start with the aforementioned ""Take a Chance"", the blaring horns announcing Hayes's sunny disposition in no uncertain terms. Longtime Plush listeners are also likely to notice the smoother vocals, immediately evident from the first track. Suiting the airy, lighter touch of the songs, Hayes' cracked warble now seems more deliberately on pitch. It fits particularly well on stately ballads like ""If I Could"" and ""We Made It"", both of which manage to convey a sunny, albeit measured, optimism without sounding forced. Unfortunately, Hayes is less convincing when playing it loose: ""Look Up, Look Down"" calls for freewheeling barroom stomp, but everything from the backing singers to the shattered-glass sound effect sounds carefully, persistently arranged.</p>
<p>Ultimately, so much thorough plotting begins to darken the mood of <i>Bright Penny</i>. Even the more sprightly tracks, ""So Much Music"" and ""White Telescope"" chief among them, are stifled by structure, a sense that their paths are both predestined and predictable. Toward the album's end, on a song entitled ""Getaway"", Hayes arguably concedes the point, imploring for someone, perhaps himself, to ""let me out of the past."" He doesn't exactly break free on <i>Bright Penny</i>, but typical of Hayes, it's not for lack of trying.</p></div>"|13497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13497-bright-penny/|5.5|Jonathan Garrett

I am not mentioning this because I want your attention and sympathy. I bring this up because this record by U.S.E. is an aggressively joyful and optimistic set of songs, and very much the sort of thing where someone might say, ""It's impossible not to feel happy while listening to this music!"" Well, let me tell you: Even though the band is doing everything they can to push my glee buttons, it has not been working.</p>
<p>I don't think that it is entirely their fault. The band, who wisely shortened their name from the rather unwieldy United State of Electronica in the five years since the release of their debut album, specialize in evoking delirious bliss and positive vibes by melding the style of post-Daft Punk house music, twee indie rock, and a sort of ""Sesame Street""-esque funk. Their formula can produce some truly outstanding and uplifting tracks-- ""Emerald City"" and ""La Discoteca"" from their debut, ""All the World"" and ""River of Love"" on this album-- but the catch is, you have to already be in an upbeat mood to appreciate the full effect of the music. This is not music of solace and comfort, this is the sound of exalting in triumph and good fortune. It's what you listen to when you know you've got it good, and you want to high-five the universe. From a depressed perspective, it seems hollow and nearly smug, like a person who sees you in a bad state and condescends to tell you, ""Hey guy! Cheer up!"" without addressing or even respecting your reasons to be upset. They mean well, sure, but it can be aggravating.</p>
<p><i>LOVEWORLD</i> is an album overflowing with sweetness and joy, but it is rather short on depth. This is fair enough-- U.S.E. are a party band, and this is bright, shiny, wholesome party music. The lyrics are mostly concerned with flirting, love, and utopian fantasies, and the tone of the music ranges from serotonin-blasting anthems to sleek, vocoder-heavy disco groovers. The songs are unapologetically corny, and for the most part, the band's craft and total commitment to their concept results in earnest pop that skillfully avoids a cringe-inducing vapidity. When they fail to hit that balance, though, the results are painful, as in the gratingly goofy robo-funk of ""Party People"", or the overly syrupy ""Helping Hand"".</p>
<p>Though U.S.E. are about as sugary as it gets, the majority of <i>LOVEWORLD</i> is more mellow and gentle than their debut, which rarely let up from its relentless bombast. They've learned to let their songs open up and breathe a bit without sacrificing their tightness or intensity, and that allows for a less exhausting and more varied listening experience. This doesn't keep the music from feeling overbearing if you're not in the appropriate mindset, but it does open up their sound to nuances that were previously just barely suggested. Nevertheless, the group would be wise to ease up on the vocoder and bring the vocals of Amanda Okonek and Carly Nicklaus closer to the center of their compositions, as they add a generous humanity to the music that can be lost when they go too deep into a mechanical, overly pure perkiness that bears little resemblance to the messy clutter of normal emotions. Ultimately, that is the reason why their music can be so difficult to take in a state of stress and misery-- we may want to strive for perfect joy when we're already in a fantastic mood, but their idealized notion of happiness can seem entirely unrealistic if you're even slightly cynical.</p></div>"|13294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13294-loveworld/|6.3|Matthew Perpetua

The original <i>45:33</i>, James Murphy's contribution to Nike's intermittent series of one-artist mixes designed for exercise, is edging up on being three years old. In Internet-era time, the DFA might as well have let these producers loose on original Giorgio Moroder demos.</p>
<p>Not that <i>45:33</i> itself sounds dated, already owing so much to classic disco and techno. Like all LCD releases, <i>45:33</i> was Murphy acting as curator of his local dance music historical society, while thrillingly (at its best) filtering it through his own mix of mordancy and guarded euphoria. Lest we forget, it contained an embryonic version of LCD's ""Someone Great"", sans vocals, making it more or less the debut of Murphy's more tender side, something that bloomed gorgeously on the following year's <i>Sound of Silver</i>.</p>
<p>But remix comps are generally rush-to-market affairs crassly designed to capitalize on a hot release by extending its commercial value for a few more months. The presumably long gestation time of <i>45:33 Remixes</i> might make you think we're getting something really special, something that took time to get just right. In reality, not so much. <i>45:33 Remixes</i> is more-or-less superfluous, the depressingly common fate of the bulk of remix comps. Of the eight remixers, no less than five fix on the exact same section of the original <i>45:33</i>, which starts around 18 minutes in and dissolves into brass gurgles 10 minutes later. Given that the remixers had 45 minutes worth of music to rebuild from the ground up, leaning on the most traditionally ""disco"" section of <i>45:33</i>, complete with horns and diva, and leaving it mostly intact feels like a failure of nerve and/or imagination.</p>
<p>Brooklyn duo Runaway add watery keyboard stabs that blow arrhythmically against the main beat, as if they were playing an Arthur Russell demo on top of the original. Akwardly. Prince Language throws on some dub wobble, but you've got to A/B the two versions closely to even gauge what he's added or subtracted, the ""playing with the levels"" school of remixing at its blandest.</p>
<p>And Theo Parrish, who you'd assume could at least be relied on to add some soul-funk grit to the proceedings, comes momentarily correct with boogie bass and extra percussion. But for a guy who could squeeze so much emotion out of the minimal materials of the ruthlessly raw, repetitive ""Ugly Edits"" series, Parrish's remix blands out over its seven-plus minutes, despite being 10 times more overstuffed. Hey, another Walter Gibbons-aping breakdown with call-and-response drums reverbed to hell and back. It might not seem so deadeningly familiar if it rivaled Gibbons' own best work.</p>
<p>Of the four, only Riley Reinhold does anything remotely interesting with that 10-minute slab of downtown-NYC-in-the-1970s retro. His big innovation is replacing the 4/4 disco swish with a rigid electro-breakbeat shuffle. Even given how generic and/or tentative the other three remixes sound, you can't exactly call Reinhold's remix revelatory.</p>
<p>That leaves four remixers to try and make up for the creativity deficit. And they're good, though not one wows enough to obviate the cost of the whole collection. Prins Thomas takes the original's most feathery section, the cascade of Tangerine Dream-ish synths and wordless vocals that make up the long outro, and turns in pop ambient by adding a micro-syncopated pulse. Trus'Me's electro is the set's most playful and unexpected track, especially when it closes with twinkling mallets that could be kissing cousin to the kind you used to get on Tortoise or Nobukazu Takemura records.</p>
<p>Padded Cell's the only remixer who thought, ""Hey, maybe I can patch different sections of the original together to make something that extends the vibe, rather than adding congas and calling it a day."" (A seriously missed opportunity on everyone else's part.) He takes the outro coos that also beguiled Thomas and adds the lugubrious piano house that serves as the original's warmup. And surprise, surprise, they fit perfectly together, each adding to the other's preexisting sad dreaminess for the best remix here.</p>
<p>What <i>45:33 Remixes</i> lacks most is <i>personality</i>, something even LCD's experimental one-offs (like the original <i>45:33</i>) reliably offer. See: Pilooski's deep house pastiche. Yes, it sounds nothing like the original. It just sounds like... a deep house pastiche. It's not just that the remixes dilute Murphy's inimitable presence in his own music; <i>45:33</i> was mostly vocal-free to begin with. It's that the remixers don't add much of <i>themselves</i> to compensate, preferring to subtly tweak sections of the original to make them more dancefloor friendly or shove them through familiar schtick.</p>
<p>That's the charitable view, at least. A sadder take might be that the artists were just cashing a much-needed check, whether it was cut three weeks or three years after <i>45:33</i> hit iTunes. Or worse, they blanched at the freedom to dismantle Murphy's creation to satisfy their own idiosyncratic wants, their hesitancy all the more strange considering that LCD's whole M.O., what makes the band more than a sterile realization of the gag at the heart of ""Losing My Edge"", is Murphy's willingness to bend or break history to make room for himself.</p></div>"|13502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13502-4533-remixes/|5.1|Jess Harvell

Their muscular post-punk was groundbreaking, but it also had a workman-like quality. Maybe that's what made them unique-- Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott always had their noses to the grindstone even when they were being visionary. Since reforming in 2002, Burma haven't been nearly as pioneering. But their hard-toiling side has not only persisted, it has expanded to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Of their three post-reunion albums so far, <i>The Sound the Speed the Light </i>sounds the most industrious, the most like another day at the office. There's nothing surprising here, and some songs are so signature-styled you might wonder if you've heard them before. But when it comes to office work, Burma's day beats most bands' years. So the lack of surprise also means a lack of flaws, and a lot of energy and power. When these guys punch the clock, they take the phrase literally.</p>
<p>So yet another Burma album hits the ground running, this time with ""1,2,3 Partyy!"", a seriously fun song about how funny it is that someone would take partying seriously. That energy spills into ""Possession"", which swings between weight-lifting pound and a wistful chorus, with lots of Miller guitar grit in between. Later, Conley's bass melodies and half-spoken lyrics turn ""Forget Yourself"" into a thoughtful semi-ballad. By time the anthemic ""SSL 83"" carries the record to its halfway point, it's been six straight unimpeachable tunes, forming an album side that rivals any Burma album side.</p>
<p>It would've been easy to let <i>The Sound </i>cruise from there, filling it with solid also-rans. But the energy level and commitment continue unabated. Two songs in particular stand out. ""So Fuck It"", with its raucous beat and Miller guitar pyrotechnics, captures the band's mix of introspection and machismo perfectly: ""I often wonder what I'm worth/ But I won't take shit from you or anyone else/ So fuck it!"" Closer ""Slow Faucet"" combines Burma's trademark crescendos with stretches of slow-burning guitar, evoking Sonic Youth's more meditative moments.</p>
<p>The fact that Burma seems physically unable to take so much as a note off is inspiring, but also a little depressing-- imagine all the great music we must have missed during their two-decade hiatus, because they surely would've worked hard at making it. But maybe they would've gotten jaded, stale, or just plain tired if they had played the indie rock game for 20 years. Either way, seven years into their second life, Mission of Burma keep attacking their music like they're lucky to be playing it for everyone again. Given all the hard work that went into <i>The Sound the Speed the Light</i>, the converse is even more true.</p></div>"|13489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13489-the-sound-the-speed-the-light/|8.0|Marc Masters

Certainly Big Star itself (current iteration aside) didn't really last long enough to bask in any belated good will. Alex Chilton's writing partner Chris Bell was gone by the time the band released its second album, 1974's <i>Radio City</i>, and by the next year Chilton had essentially pulled the plug on the group, leaving behind a few loose ends later collected as the once-abandoned, later-resuscitated masterpiece <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>.</p>
<p>Bell died in a car accident not long after that album's eventual 1978 release. Prone to serious depression and chemical indulgence, he began fitfully working on solo material as soon as he exited Big Star (though he reportedly participated in at least some of the <i>Radio City</i> sessions), and if there was every reason to expect good things from him, Big Star's own bad luck was indication enough he'd have just as much trouble getting people to hear it. In fact, it wasn't until Big Star's <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i> showed up on shelves (however haphazardly) that Bell made his solo bow: the single ""I Am the Cosmos"" backed with ""You and Your Sister"", songs coincidentally (or not) steeped in the same sense of sadness and loss that marked Big Star's swan song.</p>
<p>That's all most heard of Bell's solo work until 1992, when Rykodisc compiled his extant studio material on <i>I Am the Cosmos</i>, which fittingly showed up alongside a spiffy definitive reissue of the scattershot <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i> and followed some renewed interest in Bell's writing (This Mortal Coil covered both ""I Am the Cosmos"" and ""You and Your Sister"" on 1991's <i>Blood</i>, the latter song sung by then-Breeders Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly). It turned out that Bell, between demo sessions, working in his parents' restaurant, gigging around Europe with various pick-up bands, and dealing with his ongoing depression, had amassed more than enough strong material to make him a cult hero, almost akin to an American analog of Nick Drake, another struggling songwriter lost too soon but unearthed and embraced later (thanks, in no small part, to his own reissues).</p>
<p>Granted, Bell never got his Volkswagen moment, and admittedly he remains on the cultier end of the cult act spectrum. Case in point: while Big Star gets its own four-disc Rhino boxed set, an expanded reissue of Bell's <i>I Am the Cosmos</i> gets relegated to Rhino's Handmade imprint. It's there for people to buy it, but only if they know where to look first. In some ways it's almost fitting that, finally given his moment in the spotlight, he's stationed just left of the bright beam, still illuminated but not totally out of the shadows, either.</p>
<p>But seeing as the original CD issue of <i>I Am the Cosmos</i> was, by necessity, cobbled together from Bell's remains, what, exactly, was left in the vaults? The new reissue features the original album (as such) on the first disc, 12 songs presented in a slightly re-sequenced order. To call most of these songs ""down"" would be as unjustly reductive as calling Big Star's <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i> ""depressing."" It may be true on one level, but it fails to get at the soulful essence that makes Bell so special.</p>
<p>Back in Big Star, Chilton and Bell shared a ""Chilton/Bell"" writing credit, but that was as illusory as ""Lennon/McCartney."" Away from Big Star, Bell's solo work proves him Chilton's equal, or at least equally inclined toward a sort of melancholy but melodic proto power-pop (the ""pop"" part echoing the Beatles, of course, but with the emphasis on ""power,"" at least in terms of the emotions it contains and evokes). Here, ""Better Save Yourself"" hangs heavy and haggard, and Bell's vocals on ""Look Up"" are downright heartbreaking, giving songs such as it, ""Though I Know She Lies"" and ""There Was a Light"" the same sense of shaky, tragic inevitability that pervades <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>. ""Speed of Sound"", ""Get Away"", ""I Got Kinda Lost"", and ""Make a Scene"" surely could have found a place in Big Star's oeuvre, too, given their due in the studio.</p>
<p>The second disc is where the barrel scraping begins, but to the set's credit, much of what's included-- 15 tracks, all but two previously unreleased-- actually helps expand the history of Bell and Big Star. Yes, the bulk comprises alternate versions and mixes (including a version of ""Get Away"" featuring Chilton on guitar), but as with the rarities on Big Star's box, the different perspective proves an invaluable annex to the band's limited catalog (just as fleeting captures of Bell's slow, Southern drawl of a speaking voice proves a fascinating contrast to his sharp, British Invasion-inflected singing voice). Fleshing out the still oddly incomplete Big Star portrait are a few tracks from Bell's pre-Big Star bands Icewater and Rock City (whose early version of ""My Life Is Right"", essentially the same as Big Star's version, underscores Bell's talents), subsequent collaborations with Memphis scene fixtures Keith Sykes and Nancy Byran, and a sleepy solo instrumental, ""Clacton Rag"".</p>
<p>""There were cool things all over Chris' tapes,"" said Ardent Studios engineer Adam Hill recently in the <i>Memphis Flyer</i>, referring to ""Clacton Rag"". ""I found one thing they weren't initially gonna put on the <i>Cosmos</i> reissue, this acoustic guitar demo that theoretically could've been cut anytime, although I think it dates to the mid- or late-70s. No vocals, just pure Chris."" Considering that Bell's tragically limited life and output precludes a fuller portrait, this edition of <i>I Am the Cosmos</i> comes closest to capturing ""just pure Chris"" as we're likely ever going to get.</p></div>"|13498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13498-i-am-the-cosmos-deluxe-edition/|7.9|Joshua Klein

Except instead of imagining themselves as Joe the Woodworker (and you as a lady), the Icelandic collective are singing about-- well, the title's ""If I Were a Fish"". It'd almost definitely be making a geyser out of a lyrical plankton-fart to observe that the world's most famous carpenter also happened to be the world's most famous recruiter of fishermen. Shit, just a few lines later, Múm are a bumblebee, drowning in ""your soggy eyeballs,"" which, hmm.</p>
<p>But uhh, few bands outside 1980s bedsit-indie circles would be better suited to rep the Beatitudes' ""blessed are the meek"" rap than Múm. That's as true as ever on <i>Sing Along to Songs You Don't Know</i>. Already one transitional LP (2007's <i>Go Go Smear the Poison Ivy</i>) removed from singer Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir's departure to go make backwards recordings with Avey Tare, Múm remain pretty obsessed with the kind of childlike innocence that drove people nuts about Valtýsdóttir's impish persona, let alone her voice. Artists like Japan's Lullatone and Tenniscoats have used similar naïve-folk ramshackle wispiness toward their own ambitious, endearing ends, tickling and prodding cuteness toward its avant-garde extremes.</p>
<p>Múm's latest can be childish, but it isn't cute, and despite some (relatively) inventive arrangements, this time it's a bit of a slog on a purely musical level. <i>Sing Along to Songs You Don't Know</i> still melds electronic and organic elements, as the band have been doing since their early-millennium breakthrough, cramming in male-female harmonies, lo-fi percussion, rhapsodically blue strings, prepared piano, hammered dulcimer, marimbas, ukuleles, and even a parakeet alongside guitars and synths. Billed as a response to the recent unrest in Múm's native country, it's an entirely peaceful, largely melancholy, and clearly well-meaning record. Unfortunately, it's also filled with bewildering decision after bewildering decision.</p>
<p>With arguably one exception, the most enjoyable aspect of the album is Múm's ongoing apprecation for sonic detail, though that can get tiresome fast when such details are attached to cringeworthy songs. You might hear a music box being wound up, or an acoustic guitar string buzzing imperfectly, or what seems to be a didgeridoo. ""The Smell of Today Is Sweet Like the Breastmilk in the Wind"" uses not only chintzy electronics and vaguely disco-punk percussion, but also sloping strings, guitars with the trebly chime of the Afropop-influenced stuff that has been popular lately, and, oh yeah, Belle and Sebastian-style harmonies that become a liability when most of those instruments drop out-- no Stuart Murdoch literary mien here. Busy hi-hats and rough-hewn handclaps give ""Kay-Ray-Kú-Kú-Kó-Kex"" a retro-soul tone... if the Residents were a retro-soul band.</p>
<p>The previously mentioned exception is ""Húllabbalabbalúú"". It's the poppiest song on the album-- not because it mimics existing styles or flashes fashionable r&amp;b influences, but because it brings together plenty of Múm's eccentricities in the service of a triumphant feeling. It helps that the singers get to chant syllables that sound like nonsense to American ears, adding, perhaps tellingly: ""In these words we drown."" In any event, the song has some of the album's most successful vocals, horn fanfares, and a structure that ebbs and flows.</p>
<p>Two minor problems: The songs are generally slow, samey, and sleep-inducing, and the lyrics, any language differences notwithstanding, are hard to take seriously, even for a guy who raved about I'm From Barcelona. ""If you must cry with grief/ Blow your nose right on my sleeve,"" elfin voices urge on ""Blow Your Nose"", backed only by slow-motion strings and marimba. ""A River Don't Stop to Breathe"" has lovely string and percussion parts, with a poignantly rising refrain, but it's a dragging, preachy song overall, less than the sum. Tranquil finale ""Ladies of the New Century"" spreads out its plodding piano plinks as far as they can go, but offers little to retain all but the most devoted fans' attention between them.</p>
<p>It's probably another one of those coincidences, but Pitchfork's Mark Richardson once heard echoes of ""Heart and Soul"" in a Múm song, adding, ""I'm not suggesting they stole the melody-- I doubt the band has even heard it."" In addition to the ""If I Were a Carpenter"" similarity, there's a line on quasi-title track ""Sing Along"" that recalls ""You Are My Sunshine"", in melody and lyrics: ""You'll never know,"" Múm sing, and I want them to add, ""...dear"", you know? It's enough to make me half-wonder if the album has more of these little references, like a band singing along to songs they don't know-- kind of like the Dirty Projectors' <i>Rise Above</i>, only with half-remembered tunes from childhood instead of a Black Flag album. ""You are so beautiful to us,"" Múm sing more than once, coming on a little strong. ""We want to keep you as our pets."" Ha?</p></div>"|13470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13470-sing-along-to-songs-you-dont-know/|3.9|Marc Hogan

He's not quite as intractable as, say, old peer Mark Hollis (Talk Talk). For one thing, Sylvian's still releasing records. But from the time Japan ditched the crowd-pleasing glam sheen onward, Sylvian's music has forced his cult to reexamine their ongoing relationship with the master's music every few years.</p>
<p>That's not to say each of Sylvian's reinventions has been total, at least on an album-to-album basis. <i>Manafon</i> is of a piece with the music Sylvian has released in the 21st century, especially 2003's small masterpiece, <i>Blemish</i>. Like that quiet, achingly personal record, <i>Manafon</i> reaffirms Sylvian's aughts-forged connections with the modern avant-garde, be it jazz, electro-acoustic improvisation, post-glitch electronica, modern composition, or the artists who manage to occupy all four worlds while claiming none of them.</p>
<p>A small army of <i>The</i> <i>Wire</i>-friendly types contribute-- sax colossus Evan Parker; Japanese ""onkyo"" ascetics Sachiko M. and Toshimaru Nakamura; guitar re-inventors on the level (and varying praxis) of Keith Rowe, Christian Fennesz, and members of Polwechsel; and many more. So this may be overstating the obvious, but pop music it ain't. Even the unearthly minimalism of Japan's ""Ghosts"" or <i>Blemish</i>'s ""Late Night Shopping"" are more immediate than anything on <i>Manafon</i>.</p>
<p>If the results aren't as bracingly sour as Sylvian's cross-purpose collaborations with Derek Bailey, they also lack the warmth he gleaned from Fennesz's heat-prickly electronics. His collaborators' small, brittle, seemingly disconnected instrumental gestures slip around the unctuousness of Sylvian's infamously mannered high-romantic vocals. Sylvian's remains a voice whose only peer for unrestrained melodrama is Antony Hegarty, and whose old-school voluptuousness makes Antony's whinnying jazz-isms seem positively astringent. Sylvian's voice doesn't lend itself to the kind of modern scat one associates with ""free"" singing, nor does he even try.</p>
<p>But what drama this musical/vocal combination, oil and water on paper, creates on disc. Sylvian often sounds as if he's reading verse rather than singing songs. Choruses are scant, or so languidly paced (as on ""The Greatest Living Englishman"") that they barely register as such. He lets you know just how carefully he's wrought his words, each line left to vibrate with portent before he'll move onto onto the next. Never have the words ""don't know his right foot from his left"" seemed so flush with private meaning.</p>
<p>At its best, it's shiver-inducing, a sort of inverse of Joanna Newsom's ecstatic prolixity, though with the same deliberate pacing that can alienate listeners used to songs that progress from verse to verse at the usual clip. Sylvian can rival Michael Gira when it comes to taking his own sweet time getting through a lyric. And at least Swans had brutal, repetitive rhythms to help guide listeners along. Sylvian makes no such concessions to rock tradition, however perverted. And it's the music that makes <i>Manafon</i> a marvel, a mixture of free-improvisation's moment-to-moment sonic epiphanies with Sylvian's molasses-slow kinda-sorta torch songs.</p>
<p>Mark Hollis' 1998 solo album is probably the closest comparison to the backing tracks of <i>Manafon</i>. On that underheard record, Hollis asked why couldn't a singer-songwriter album move to the staggered (and staggering) quietude of Morton Feldman's china-fragile chamber music. Sylvian takes it much further out, though. For one thing, while he knows restraint when necessary, you could never describe Sylvian's performance as ""hushed,"" whereas Hollis often seemed to evaporate from his own compositions.</p>
<p>Sylvian is front-and-center on every song, which is good because he provides the only rhythmic and melodic stability, as the instrumentals dart and scratch and feedback around him, whether it's the scouring burst of formless guitar noise that opens miniature ""125 Spheres"", the random notes pricking the drone of ""Snow White in Appalachia"", or the splinters of Bernard Herrmann-meets-AMM piano on ""Random Acts of Senseless Violence"". Nothing makes ""sense"" by usual capital-s Songwriting standards; it's music with the rhythm and textural illogic of precipitation. And no other singer is making music this bravely untethered to tradition. Though you know he'll some day move on, you want Sylvian to explore this eerie, expectation-subverting world forever.</p></div>"|13496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13496-manafon/|7.4|Jess Harvell

Crowded House resident Neil Finn invited a supergroup's worth of artists from the UK and America to convene over the Christmas holidays at his New Zealand studio and record an album for charity. Members of Wilco and Radiohead made the trip, along with KT Tunstall, Lisa Germano, Johnny Marr, and a handful of Australian and New Zealand artists. They had three weeks to complete as much as possible, and while that may seem like a long sojourn, it's a fast turn-around when there are 20 musicians coming in and out, some of them bringing finished songs to record but most of them writing as they go. Finn, however, kept it low-key by promising proceeds to Oxfam and by inviting the artists' <span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span>families along. He even included his own musical brood: his wife Sharon, sons Liam and Elroy, and brother Tim all played on the album. Even Spencer Tweedy, Jeff's teenage son, gets a credit.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This isn't the first time Neil Finn has played cruise director. In 2001, he assembled some of the same personnel for a series of concerts and a live double album benefiting Doctors Without Borders. Eight years later, he's grown even more ambitious, and what might have been a slapdash studio effort instead comes across as polished, professional, and cohesive. Of course, like almost every double album, <i>The Sun Came Out</i> would work better at half the length, weeding out the meandering instrumental ""3 Worlds Collide"" along with some of the less effective folk-pop iterations, such as ""Duxton Blues"" by Augie March singer Glenn Richards and Bic Runga's ""Change of Heart"". Jeff Tweedy's ""You Never Know"" was re-recorded for <i>Wilco (The Album)</i>, and this version forgoes the George Harrison guitar fireworks but retains the Sly Stone ooh-sha-sha rhythms, losing some of its rock-historical humor and authority in the process. His other contribution, ""What Could Have Been"", fits better on this album, with his measured vocal and Finn's sensitive guitarwork.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The album features several unlikely singers, including Wilco's John Stirratt and Pat Sansone and former Soul Coughing bass player Sebastian Steinberg, but the real headline so far seems to be, PHIL SELWAY SINGS... AND HE'S NOT HALF BAD. The Radiohead drummer wrote two numbers: the gentle ""Ties That Bind"" and the subdued sing-along ""Witching Hour"", both of which show off his ear for subtle melodic hooks and his arcing, textured voice. He outdoes some of the more professional singers, including the Mutton Birds' Don McGlashan, who at his best sounds like an indie-rock Mike Scott but doesn't have especially good songs to sing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On the recommendation of Glenn Kotche, Finn invited KT Tunstall down to Auckland as well, and she turns out to be one of the project's most spirited participants. While she's often dismissed as a bland pop-Americana artist from the Michelle Branch school, her Scottish cowgirl vocals and easy way with a chorus enliven her upbeat ""Hazel Branch"" and her downbeat ""Black Silk Ribbon"", a duet with New Zealand singer-songwriter Bic Runga. Sharon Finn proves a playful foil for her husband on the duet ""Little by Little"", and Lisa Germano almost steals the album by leading everyone through a sing-along on the stand-out ""Reptile"". Even though she plays violin on several tracks here, she still seems underutilized.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>The Sun Came Out</i>, whether intentionally or not, is an album for singers, but often it's the music that elevates the songs and prevents even the slickest moments from falling into the AOR mire. Kotche and Steinberg form a solid rhythm section on numerous tracks, while pretty much anyone who's not singing lead is singing back-up that ranges from the full choir of ""Reptile"" to the strange whispers on ""The Ties That Bind"". Ed O'Brien conjures Marc Bolan on the opening glam chords of ""Bodhisattva Blues"", sharing vocals with Finn, and Tweedy adds a jostling guitar solo to Finn's ""All Comedians Suffer"". More than even the surprising vocal turns, that sense of give-and-take between the musicians makes <i>The Sun Came Out</i> more than just a collection of cast-offs for charity. It could be a real band here, albeit one that needs an editor.</p>

With breezy calypso rhythms, honeyed country-acoustic guitars, bubbly/silly synthesizer effects, and summery melodies, their debut, <i>Return to the Sea</i>, was a wonderful getaway soundtrack, obscuring its death-haunted lyrics with bright arrangements and rich, coconut-scented production. On Islands' second album, however, storm clouds descended:<i> Arm's Way</i> found the band down a member-- Thompson amicably departed before its recording-- yet ballooned into a six-piece, and the bloat was audible. Melodies (previously the shivery highlight of their songs) were buried in meandering guitar solos, baroque, melodramatic strings, and gloomy, silvery keyboards for a dark, proggy effect that bled the band of much of its fun and levity.</p>
<p>The good news is that the clouds seem to have parted; on their third album, Islands are sunny once more.   Perhaps it's due to the return of Thompson, back in the fold after his one-album hiatus, or just a product of stripping the instrumentation down to its most basic structure (in many cases, just synths, drums, and guitar) in service of memorable tunes, but Islands have made a welcome return to form. While those hoping for <i>Return to the Sea</i>'s Afro-Caribbean flourishes and guest rappers will be disappointed, <i>Vapours</i>' comparably spare synth-pop is replete with the juicy hooks and major-key bounce that were so lacking from their last effort.</p>
<p>The album kicks off with ""Switched On""'s repetitive shimmying guitar figure, squishy 1980s synths, and swooning, hiccuping vocals. The title track struts like a peacock, showing off a big, swaggering chorus (""It's the bassline in your mind/ It's a sexy way to cry/ You know I've had my share of doubt/ Until I saw the vapours in your eyes"") over a four-on-the-floor stomp and brassy, confident horns. And ""Tender Torture"" is not only the most lyrically literal interpretation of Islands' earlier beachy ethos but also, with its whirring suction-cup synth effects and gooey ""ooohs,"" the apex of their futuristically sweet sound. That's not to say Islands have given up their penchant for darkness-- after all, we're talking about guys whose main lyrical concerns have long been bones and ghosts. Moody numbers-- like ""No You Don't"" with its spare percolating keyboards and lyrics that warn, ""Don't buy dope from a man you don't know""-- still abound. But built as they are on tightly wound mechanical beats and free of rococo arrangements, these murkier moments feel more visceral for their restraint.</p>
<p>What made Islands' debut so thrilling (and saved <i>Arm's Way</i> from its grandiose ambitions) was the expansive, creative way they wrapped up their classic pop hooks in unexpected instrumentation or imaginative production. And <i>Vapours</i>, though more stripped down than either of its predecessors, continues in that tradition. Surely, many criticisms of the album will include a mention of Islands' Auto-Tuned ""Heartbeat"", but with organic, galloping guitars and whimsical synth flourishes underscoring their most vulnerable vocal melody, Diamonds' mechanized voice adds a dash of synthetic style and keeps things from devolving into the realm of the overly sentimental.   Though there is an overall whiff of the 1980s about <i>Vapours</i>, it sidesteps the traps of either sounding trendily vintage or indistinguishable from the rest of today's Reagan-era impostors. It works best, however, to think of the album as a return to <i>Return to the Sea</i>, only, as its title suggests, in a hazier, less opaque form. It's as if that album's liquid-y tracks have evaporated, leaving only wispy traces of synthesizer melodies and quirky pop choruses wafting through the air.</p></div>"|13485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13485-vapours/|7.8|Rebecca Raber

To a large extent it's true-- the band definitely prioritizes antics over songs, happy to let their tunes fall apart completely if it means singer Ami Shalev can jump off a balcony or drummer Ran Shimoni can ""play"" his kit on top of the audience. There's so much to watch at their gigs that once the dust settles, it's hard to remember what you heard. So seeking out Montonix albums after seeing them live is kind of like wanting to know what music was playing at a circus.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, if you think of them more as carnival souvenirs than art, Monotonix's records are actually pretty good. If you only want to hear progressive ideas or original sounds, you probably can live without them. But considering that this is devoutly derivative garage rock, there's more going on in these tunes than you might imagine. And, most surprisingly, the band's sound has already evolved in the span of just two releases.</p>
<p>Their debut Drag City EP, 2008's <i>Body Language</i>, mined classic hard-rock and metal, often heading directly for Black Sabbath territory. <i>Where Were You When It Happened?-- </i>deemed an LP even though it's only five minutes longer--<i> </i>is grittier and grimier, lying somewhere along the crayoned line that connects the pre-punk blues damage of the Stooges to the scummy grunge of Mudhoney. Where Shalev previously preferred an Ozzy moan, here he has more of an Iggy howl, and it dovetails nicely with guitarist Yonatan Gat's crunchier tone. There's even a moment during the album's best track, ""Set Me Free"", where the pair unite in a vocal-and-feedback whine that's as mesmerizing as anything the band does onstage.</p>
<p>Outside of that highlight, the album gets by primarily on sped-up energy. Tunes like the riff-riot ""Flesh and Blood"", the swinging ""I Can't Take It Anymore"", and the rolling Mudhoney-rip ""Spit It on Your Face"" all sound a little faster, a little tighter, a little more manic than they rightfully should. Even the more down-tempo ""Something Has Dried"" has a tautness akin to the Jesus Lizard's forays into slow slobber. The band does eventually run out of steam, ending with two weak attempts to add variety and texture through forced crescendos and meditative duets. But aside from those experiments, <i>Where Were You</i> has one crucial thing in common with the Monotonix stage act: it's a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Again, there's nothing genuinely new here, and the influences are so obvious I would bet that even someone who hasn't heard music like this before could quickly smell the band's debt to its predecessors. But just as you'd have to be made of stone not to enjoy at least some part of a Monotonix gig, anyone who likes garage rock would have to be an obstinate stickler for originality not to enjoy the best parts-- that is, the majority-- of <i>Where Were You When It Happened?</i></p></div>"|13490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13490-where-were-you-when-it-happened/|7.0|Marc Masters

It quickly  became a groaner. But it persists as that band's profile grows. And  so now any band that follows and is sufficiently infused with Afropop  influence-- sunny guitar, rattles, djembe, etc.-- carries the burden  of comparison, derision, and, for shame, trend-humping.</p>
<p>Fool's Gold probably aren't thrilled about this. Guitarist and songwriter Lewis Pesacov has been  quietly filtering his obsession with African music into the songs  of his other band, sun-smacked L.A. rockers Foreign Born, for two solid,  underrated albums. Foreign Born's ""Early Warnings"" is the apex  of that subtle evolution, and the highlight of this year's <i>Person to Person</i>. With Fool's Gold, a side project that could emerge  as the more viable of the two bands, Pesacov, with Israel-born singer/songwriter  Luke Top (and a rotating cast from bands like We Are Scientists, Glasser,  the Fall, and Foreign Born), gives himself over entirely to his muse.  The sounds of Touareg and Afrobeat and Ghanaian Highlife are rippling  through the eight songs here, each a rollicking, warm reflection of  appreciation. Pesacov has eradicated questions about authenticity by  composing gorgeous odes to forbearers like Ali and Vieux Farka Touré,  Tinariwen, and Konono N°1.</p>
<p>There is a catch that makes  this something less than out and out replication. Opener ""Surprise  Hotel""-- all pinging guitar lines and hand-slapped drums-- sounds  like the kind of thing filmmaker Jonathan Demme would drop onto one  of his ""world-conscious,"" rubbernecking soundtracks. And then Luke  Top begins to sing. At first it feels like a tribal chant. Which, of  course it is. Only not the tribe you're thinking of. Top, a full-throated,  melismatic vocalist, sings nearly every song in Hebrew. There is something  initially shtick-y about this-- watch as cultures collide! But there  is also something natural about the tones, the ohhs and ahhs, and the  swaying force of each lyric that Top offers. There's an added value  to much of the lyrical obfuscation, too: Top isn't much of a lyricist.  That his words are hidden behind what will be largely indecipherable  to most listeners is a plus. The lyrics to each song are printed in  English in the liners of <i>Fool's Gold</i>, and they reveal a pretentious  streak. From the half-sung in English ""Momentary Shelter"": ""A  mind of night is mine/ A frozen light imbibes/ The darkness is boiling/ Your skin in the moonlight.""</p>
<p>Still, this is ultimately Pesacov's  show. The two transcendent moments of this album come in succession:  The first is the yearning ""Nadine"", a brass band raveup that is  equal parts celebratory and mournful; the second is the expansive ""Ha  Dvash"", which plays like a narcotized recreation of Talking Heads'  experiments in familiar territory on <i>Remain in Light</i>. Top isn't  frantic like David Byrne, and so while the song is less an advance on  the sound, it's a fusion that, in some ways, fits better. And so maybe  Fool's Gold can dodge some cultural reduction along the way.</p></div>"|13494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13494-fools-gold/|7.6|Sean Fennessey

Because we're talking about indie rock and not say, green energy, that feels like a particularly weird thing to write. Even so, if you read/live on the Internet, too, chances are you've noticed a deluge of dudes taking aim at bringing beach times to your headphones year round. Just by name alone: Wavves brought us bummers, Surfer Blood are sharing huge uppers, and the Underwater Peoples label in D.C. as a whole specializes almost exclusively in Coppertoned escapism/aesthetics. Holiday Shores (formerly Continental Divide) are a Tallahassee five-piece that re-named their band after the Florida street on which lead vocalist Nathan Pemberton grew up. Florida underlined.</p>
<p>Pushing off with a short stretch of vocal harmonizing that somehow echoes Fleet Foxes, opener ""Reruns"" actually takes on shades of early Shins songs, another Phil Ek-assisted band. Those hooks were spit-polished and very much in tune to the weird bubbles James Mercer zipped them up in. The same kind of relationship between sonics, structure, and environment can be found here. Though <i>Columbus'd the Whim</i> avoids many of the lo-fi-isms that have stamped so many of said summer jams this year, it does share a similar, shoes-untied vibe. That's inherent in the guitar tones (chiming!) and pacing (fluid!) and effects (koozies of reverb and delay!) more than any insistence on the immediacy some associate with garage sloppiness. It's not music for the beach, it's music of the beach. Take  ""Phones Don't Feud"", which lolls along before cutting itself in half with a crash of frothy tremolo, Pemberton surfing the subsequent swirl of trebly guitar and ""oooh-aaah"" vocal layering as it decrescendos and eventually dissolves away. It's a beautiful way to build a song.</p>
<p>But rarely are Holiday Shores so direct in their approach. As much as Pemberton's vocals sit front row, the reliance on wavy-gravy effects obscures the melodic connections-- so many times this sounds like a band playing from a few blocks away. Most of that problem can be heard in the guitars and the way they chase their tails at times. Listen closely enough to ""Edge of Our Lives"" and ""Errand of Tongue"", and you can totally pick up on jazzy, night time strains of the Clientele or even <i>Parachutes</i>-era Coldplay. Before taking a stab at some West African guitar calisthenics, ""Bradley Bear"" opens with some of the sort of delay-heavy, sopping wet guitar drips that leave you with water in your ears.  Those sounds in particular humidify most of the record, but when crammed and sandwiched in between so many ideas (see also: ""Tremor Rolls the Peak"") it makes for a soggy mess at times. It's why the tunefulness and drive help ""Experiencer"" stand out as much as it does: all the melody you could ask for, but none of the pruning.</p></div>"|13492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13492-columbusd-the-whim/|6.3|David Bevan

His older brother died as a baby because the cult didn't believe in medical attention. His dad left. He and his mother lived around the world, and the cult sometimes forced his mother to prostitute herself. As a teenager, Owens fled and lived as a Texas gutter-punk for a while. Then a local millionaire took Owens under his wing, and Owens moved to San Francisco. There, he and Chet ""JR"" White formed Girls, and recorded <i>Album</i>, their debut album, under the influence of just about every kind of pill they could find.</p>
<p>As band origin stories go, this one is so epically sad and squalid and ultimately triumphant that nobody could make it up. It's the sort of story that can overwhelm a band so completely that you never really hear their music; you only hear the story. So it's a tribute to <i>Album</i> that you don't need to know one word of that first paragraph to hear it as what it is: a dizzily powerful piece of work. That's partly because you don't need to know Owens' story to intuit that there's something going on here. When I saw the band play SXSW, knowing nothing about them beyond their compulsively listenable ""Hellhole Ratrace"" single, I wrote that the band's music sounds ""like the work of one deeply weird and possibly sad person.""</p>
<p>That's largely because of Owens' enormously evocative voice, a hiccupy thing that feels like a direct descendant of every sad nerd genius in pop history. The immediate obvious reference point is Elvis Costello, but you can also hear shards of Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison and Paul McCartney and Morrissey. Owens never brays or moans or snarls; he sings simple songs about heartbreak with the internalized classicism of someone who's been listening to oldies radio in his sleep his whole life. He's playful; he has fun with it. But there's always a wounded, raggedy quaver at the back of his throat, one that implies worlds of hurt beyond the simple breakup songs he's singing.</p>
<p>And make no mistake; most of the songs on the Girls album are about, well, girls. Owens reportedly wrote much of the album in the aftermath of a bad breakup. There's one song called ""Laura"" and another called ""Lauren Marie"", so he's presumably got someone in mind. But he never falls into emo laceration, instead delivering his sentiments with conversational directness: ""You've been a bitch, I've been an ass/ I don't wanna point the finger; I just know I don't like this, I don't wanna do this."" But even his most innocuous classic-pop lyrics hint at a deep-seated fucked-upedness. On ""Goddamn"", he gets downright creepy over glimmering acoustic guitars and ""Ghost Town"" percussion-rattles: ""Just give all your attention to me."" ""Headache"" is just as fragile and reverby, and Owens cops a half-joking lounge-singer baritone to sing, ""Let's be the people that we want to be/ Let's live like we could never part""-- implying, of course, that he's not already the person he wants to be. And he starts out ""Hellhole Ratrace"", the band's first single, with this: ""I'm sick and tired of the way that I feel."" He's a broken man.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Album</i> is mostly sunny Beach Boys pastiche, but it's not the kajillionth indie attempt at orchestral <i>Pet Sounds</i> majesty. Rather, it's simple and forthright early Beach Boys stuff: compact guitar-jangles, sha-la-la harmonies, muffled heartbeat drums. It <i>sounds</i> great. And even though it has a basic core sound, <i>Album</i> manages to cover a lot of aesthetic ground in its 44 minutes. Without being showy about it, they swing from rushing power-pop to acoustic campfire laments to ""Morning Light"", which is one of the most fully realized slices of shoegaze revivalism I've heard in years. If they'd made an entire album of songs like ""Morning Light"", Girls would be getting a ton of blog love, but they decided to go for something at once messier and simpler. And they're getting a ton of blog love anyway.</p>
<p>There's a pillowy quality to many of the sounds on <i>Album</i>, but this isn't lo-fi or glo-fi or whatever. Rather, every little production flourish is so much a part of the whole that you don't notice it until the 10th or 15th listen. On ""Lust for Life"", for instance, there's a melodica that bubbles up on the second half. ""Big Bad Mean Motherfucker"" is joyous beach-party stuff, but there's a beautifully discordant guitar solo in there. ""Hellhole Ratrace"" builds to an epic guitar whoosh halfway through its seven minutes, but the beat's hammer never quite falls; the drums stay just slightly <i>off</i>. The guitars on ""Lauren Marie"" twang like Duane Eddy's. All this stuff functions like the sleigh bells on Liz Phair's ""Fuck and Run"": subtle little intuitive details that you might never notice but that add to the devastating whole. The canniness of <i>Album</i>'s production choices and the scuzzy depression of the lyrics and the gut-level songwriting instincts, along with everything else about the record, add up to something elusive and fascinating-- maybe even heartbreaking.</p></div>"|13477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13477-album/|9.1|Tom Breihan

This might just be a less verbally economical way of saying, ""we did this with the guy who produced the last Clientele record."" Wolf's got a dry sense of humor like that. It's telling that he put it in those terms-- though 2008's staggering <i>Alopecia </i>won plenty of well-deserved plaudits, the most often-heard criticism I heard was a bizarrely general one, essentially that listeners were expecting a hip-hop record and got subjected to 50 minutes of indie rock. The Anticon name must still be heavy in the streets, but the truth is, as long as Wolf continues to be as candid and vivid as he's been in the past, he'll have more in common with the expressionists of outre rap than the straight-laced indie vanguard.</p>
<p>To a large degree, <i>Eskimo Snow </i>comes off like an acknowledgment of that gap rather than a collection of songs culled from the same sessions that birthed <i>Alopecia</i>. For better or worse, <i>Eskimo Snow </i>eschews the musical and emotional contours of <i>Alopecia </i>for a resigned saunter to the gallows. The shift is made apparent from the album's killer first line: ""I wear the customary clothes of my time/ Like Jesus did with no reason not to die."" But as ""These Hands"" progresses, it never builds into a larger statement, just an insular word collage.</p>
<p>But thereafter, the latest from WHY? is almost completely devoid of the black humor that typically undercuts Wolf's most uncomfortable confessions, save for centerpiece ""Into the Shadows of My Embrace"", which serves as the album's reservoir of nebbish quotables. The drum roll that follows ""it'd take a busload of high school soccer girls to wash those hospitals off me"" could just as easily be replaced by a rimshot. By the song's midsection, Wolf can barely contain himself, hyperventilating, ""I wish I could feel close to somebody, but I don't feel nothing/ Now they say that I need to quit doing all this random <i>f-f-ff...,</i>"" biting his lip at that last word, embarrassed as much by his situation as the ease of the rhyme itself.</p>
<p>That's pretty much the last bit of levity before the second half's unyielding bleakness. Balancing it out-- and Wolf's curdled, nasal honk-- is one of the unexpectedly pretty albums you'll come across. Much of <i>Eskimo Snow </i>continues in the manner of ""A Sky for Shoeing Horses Under"" (which gets reprised on the stormy piano ballad ""One Rose""), favoring loops of mallet percussion, live drumming, and acoustic guitar. ""January Twenty Something"" introduces honest-to-god vocal harmonies that blossom and split apart with surprisingly delicacy. But as the album progresses, only the brief, coiled intensity of flanger-lashed ""On Rose Walk, Insomniac"" proves to be a counterpoint to all those literal bells and whistles. Considering WHY?'s shift towards indie, the mixed meters of ""Berkeley By Hearseback"" seem influenced by Chicago post-rock. Meanwhile, many have remarked on the similarity of ""This Blackest Purse"" to the more maudlin side of Ben Folds, while the title track is in the style of the exhausted, finger-plucked acoustic send-off that served as the closer on the last couple of Death Cab albums.</p>
<p>It <i>is</i> easy to focus on what's missing here-- nothing strikes with the surprising pop instincts of ""Fatalist Palmistry"" or the unsettling hilarity of Wolf's far-fetched and yet somehow affecting closet-cleaning about buttfucking Berliners, throwing up behind Whole Foods, or ""jerking off in an art museum john til my dick hurts"" (this line went over surprisingly well at a performance in L.A.'s Natural History Museum)<i>. </i>But as the cryptic refrain of ""no flash photography"" gives a new dimension to the weary C&amp;W crawl of ""Even the Good Wood Gone"", it's clear that there's a hangover to be nursed, a need to ""feel nothing"" after <i>Alopecia </i>had Wolf ""doomed to feel too much,"" as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11254-alopecia/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork's Jason Crock said</a>.<i> Eskimo Snow</i> just feels like the right kind of album for an incredibly gifted and increasingly prolific band like WHY? to release as a quick palate cleanser, reaching an endpoint of a certain sound rather than trying to top its predecessor's unmatchable extremities.</p></div>"|13450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13450-eskimo-snow/|6.9|Ian Cohen

From the start, folks threw around that phrase when discussing the group mostly because their early material put a light wash of textural guitars on their otherwise melancholy indie pop, but, really, it was a garnish and not the main course. At their core, Pains aren't about scuzz or even shoegaze, they're a classic bookish indie pop band-- twee, you might even say-- and <i>Higher Than the Stars</i>, an EP of four new songs and one excellent remix, drives that point home very clearly.</p>
<p>In addition to helping clear up misconceptions about the group's M.O., <i>Higher Than the Stars</i> also marks a small but important aesthetic shift for Pains. On their self-titled debut from earlier this year, the band worked within a pretty specific strain of indie-pop from the mid-80s and drew heavily from the hazy guitar pop of early My Bloody Valentine and C86 acts like Shop Assistants. But this EP demonstrates a tweaking of that sound that falls more in line with the cleaner approach of late-80s Sarah Records bands, most notably the Field Mice. That may seem like a minor distinction, but it helps to show Pains not as period fetishists, but instead a group of indie-pop aesthetes who seem to be able to operate comfortably within several different subdivisions of the genre.</p>
<p>The song that most exemplifies this altered formula is the EP's title cut, ""Higher Than the Stars"", which is noteworthy not only for its gloss but the assurance with which it bounces along-- its twinkling synths, crisp guitar strums, and longing vocals all hitting at the right moments. I'd put it right up there with ""Come Saturday"" and ""Young Adult Friction"" as one of the best tracks in Pains' catalogue so far. Though perhaps not quite as dazzling, ""Falling Over"" is equally crisp, and also puts a greater emphasis on rhythm and synths (keyboardist Peggy Wang-East's playing is confident throughout) and works as a sappy ballad about the uncertainty of a potential new love. Frontman Kip Berman's sad-sack tenderness could be irritating here if it didn't sound so great, as he shields himself from hurt, singing, ""Don't you, don't you touch me... I'd fall over for you,"" in his most convincing faux-British accent to date.</p>
<p>The two tracks that stand out as different from the pack here are ""103"" and the Saint Etienne remix of ""Higher Than the Stars"", the former a holdover from the time of the self-titled LP's recording and more in line with that style. (It's pleasant enough but probably the slightest of the batch.) The Saint Etienne remix, though, is fantastic, stretching the original's four minutes to nearly seven of the kind of tropical dance-pop the group is famous for. It also makes for an interesting complete circle here, since Saint Etienne associate Ian Catt also produced the Field Mice (whose influence, again, is clear on this EP) in the 80s, and SE covered the Field Mice's ""Let's Kiss and Make Up"". Saint Etienne's co-sign on the would-be torchbearers for this style is high praise indeed. It also further emphasizes the argument this EP makes, which is that Pains could be the most promising indie pop group around.</p></div>"|13486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13486-higher-than-the-stars-ep/|8.0|Joe Colly

Which makes sense-- Hope Sandoval was the singer for Mazzy Star, and she keeps the aesthetic of that band very much alive in this, her second solo-ish effort since her old band stopped early this decade. Her accomplice in the absence of David Roback is My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig, who essentially is the Warm Inventions, as was the case on their 2001 debut, <i>Bavarian Fruit Bread</i>.</p>
<p><i>Through the Devil Softly</i> is a quietly enveloping listen, and Sandoval's decision not to get too far from the sound of her former band is a wise one. Her husky voice and worn-down delivery are perfectly served by this open, reverb-heavy, and downtrodden background. You get the sense of her wandering through some abandoned, former gold-rush town, singing quietly to herself as the tumbleweeds bounce by. For his part, Ó Cíosóig is about a million miles from the extreme density and close-mic'd immediacy of My Bloody Valentine, and he embraces the change in his languid drumming on the record (he plays other instruments and co-produces with Sandoval as well). The two give themselves a palette of guitar, banjo, and occasional vibes, keyboard, or cello to build Sandoval's landscapes, which are variably interesting.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting textures is found on ""For the Rest of Your Life"", which sounds constructed on a loop of an echoing, muted pick slide on the E string of a guitar. Sandoval floats over the top with some vibes and sparse flashes of electric guitar, and as the song fades after the verses it sounds as if it's wandering off into a void. The void is never far away on this record. Even at its warmest, there are ghosts in the air and cobwebs in the corners, as on the single ""Blanchard"", which opens the album with the interplay of a shimmering guitar phrase and distant, wordless vocal. The banjo plucking on ""Fall Aside"" and ""Blue Bird"" is slow and wobbly, and  Ó Cíosóig offers a barely audible vocal on ""Lady Jessica and Sam"" in the form of a slow, low moan that shadows Sandoval's weary verse.</p>
<p>They take the distance to an extreme on muffled closer ""Satellite"", which is filtered to sound as if it's creaking out of the speakers after traveling for light years on the back of a radio wave. It opens and closes with the sound of waves on a beach. It's a pretty end for a pretty record, one that will put Mazzy Star fans in a comfortably familiar place and will probably just feel comfortable to everyone else. There's no real standout track-- no ""Fade Into You"" for this decade-- but it's a good listen while it lasts, a thing of slow, sad grace.</p></div>"|13482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13482-through-the-devil-softly/|6.7|Joe Tangari

On his first release under his own name, <i>White Clouds Drift On and On</i>, he discards drums and bass entirely, producing his finest work yet in the process. The tracks are built from tapered, drenching loops of tone, massed in respiring pulses. The music beats, shivers, yawns open. The album's title, while almost comically generic, is apt: without drums, it's wonderfully unimpeded, like a huge pendulum slowly spending its energy. We would get that it's Van Wey's most personal work even if it weren't for song titles like ""I Knew Happiness Once""-- the tracks are sensitively inhabited, with a human ache in every cascade.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Though Gas is Van Wey's most obvious forebearer, traces of modern minimal techno and dubstep echo in the distance. You can detect the Field on ""A Gentle Hand to Hold"", where an idyllic guitar loop slaloms lazily through voices as evanescent as soap bubbles, and Burial on ""Too Little Too Late"", with its gauzy clatter, and vocal information about rapture and pain. The album's emotional depth makes itself plain, but it has a conceptual dimension as well: It lies on a continuum of deconstruction. Dub itself is already an abstraction of something else; <i>White Clouds</i> is an abstraction of dub; and the bonus disc-- a series of interpretations by Stephen Hitchell, as Intrusion-- abstracts <i>White Clouds</i>. Hitchell breaks up Van Wey's glaciers into ice chunks floating on vast seas, sometimes gathering them back up with nets of percussion. The second disc also stretches the total play time to upwards of two and a half hours. This amplitude winds up being important.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>White Clouds</i><i> </i>is immediately pleasurable for the opulence of its sounds. From the unhurriedly swooping strings of ""Too Little Too Late"" to the tinkling piano in an engulfing corona of drones on ""A Chance to Start Over"", Van Wey cultivates an unremitting sense of majesty and loneliness. But to praise ambient music for prettiness is like praising a house track because you can dance to it. Epic pace and scale are what push <i>White Clouds</i> over the border between pretty and awesome. The deliberate pace screws with your perception of time, and minutes melt away unnoticed. When ""I Knew Happiness Once"" finally begins to swirl around the drain, I'm always astonished that 16 minutes have elapsed. Van Wey lets his parts linger until they feel inert and permanent, only then introducing new elements-- often ecstatic voices, piercing what seemed an impenetrable wall of sound. He uses long forms not to antagonize or subdue, but to unleash a welter of happy-sad feeling. It's the most gracious, forthcoming ambient music I've heard this year.</p></div>"|13499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13499-white-clouds-drift-on-and-on/|8.0|Brian Howe

Up until that point, the record is, as advertised, ascetic and stripped down, the product of a person alone in a cabin for months with only a guitar for company. The songs early on bring to mind snow, wood, creaky furniture, drawn breaths-- organic materials that could have been just as easily assembled 80 years ago. But as Vernon sings the ""what might have been lost"" refrain in ""Wolves"", you hear something strange creeping in: One of the many voices, which are layered and harmonized, both full and falsetto, is run through some kind of vocoder-like effect. It's subtle at first, added without drawing much attention to itself, but it even so it feels like the floor dropping out. Just like that, the song is broken wide open, and Vernon's music is infused with a sense of unexpected possibility.</p>
<p>That boundless feeling was confirmed on Bon Iver's <i>Blood Bank</i> EP, released at the beginning of this year. One if its songs, ""Woods"", was an a cappella number with every voice processed, as Vernon stretched and trilled the phrases like Crosby, Stills, Nash, and T-Pain. Yes, these effects became absurdly ubiquitous last year, and the mere fact that it was used was nothing special. But Vernon is operating in a milieu-- an emotionally driven singer-songwriter on a noted indie rock label-- where people don't usually do such things. Especially so early in a promising career, where you're not sure how your audience might react. My sense is that Vernon was able to put expectations aside; he had a sound in mind and he went for it, without worrying too much about what a ""Bon Iver"" song should be. And that in itself was exciting.</p>
<p>So after <i>Emma</i>'s deserved success, the nifty stopgap EP, and Vernon's long stretch on the road winning new fans, his next move proves to be yet another welcome curveball: teaming with the post-rock outfit Collections of Colonies of Bees for a short album of experimental pop as Volcano Choir. Vernon's voice is one of the most distinctive going right now, so you can always hear him in this music. But at the same time, <i>Unmap</i> in no way feels like any sort of follow-up to <i>Emma</i>. This is partly because these tracks aren't really songs. Words mean very little, and there's not much in the way of verses or choruses. Instead, Vernon's voice becomes a texture, a tool for shading the tracks and bringing them into focus. Collections of Colonies of Bees, who have over the last couple of records proven to be the rare instrumental rock band with ideas about how to keep things both surprising and musical, bring Vernon into their world, which turns out to be a very good thing.</p>
<p>When it all comes together, the results are dazzling. ""Seeplymouth"" is one highlight. With its repeating guitar chimes and chanted voices, it begins with a loose, jazzy feel weirdly reminiscent of <i>Peanuts</i> composer Vince Guaraldi. But then, after a sung passage by Vernon, it continues to build in intensity until it's a huge, pumping mass of crashing drums and wailed voices, something apocalyptic and almost unbearably intense. Equally impressive, and much closer to a conventional song, is the following ""Island, IS"", with its hyper-repetitive keyboard pulse drawn from modern classical, loping drums, and Vernon singing mesmerizingly opaque phrases that sound like the product of automatic writing.</p>
<p>Heard back-to-back, these two tracks suggest a sort of fusion between the U.S. and UK versions of post-rock. There's definitely some Talk Talk here, in the way assumptions about sound and structure are re-thought from the ground up and used in service of a new kind of song. But there's also a sense of Tortoise's studiousness, the way existing genres are toyed with and then broken down for parts. But despite the looseness and the grab-bag approach, the best of the songs on <i>Unmap</i>-- the airy opener ""Husks and Shells"", with its plucked acoustic and Vernon multi-tracked into reverb-heavy choir, and ""Still"", which is a longer, better version of the EP's ""Woods"" augmented by droning keyboards and Steve Reich-like figures-- feel right as rain, like these weird mash-ups were there all along, just waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>Some of the tracks are unformed explorations that weren't pursued as far as they could have been, but even these have something to recommend. ""Dote"" puts Vernon in an echoing cavern and stretches his voice out to a rich, gothic drone that sounds like something Kranky would have loved to put out in the late 1990s. But it lasts only for three minutes and feels like it's just getting rolling when it crashes sharply into ""And Gather"". But then, fortunately, the latter is another short, intriguing track, bringing to mind Animal Collective's <i>Sung Tongs</i> with its acoustic guitar figure, handclaps, and chants. So where half-formed ideas are found, sharp editing keeps the album moving along. The only track that doesn't work is ""Mbira in the Morass"", which finds Vernon straining for a kind of bent soul vibe over a shapeless background heavy on the titular instrument. Still, one skip on such a truly experimental record-- they're really trying stuff here, not totally sure if it's going to work-- is an impressive feat. And for Vernon, the possibilities now seem even more vast.</p></div>"|13506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13506-unmap/|8.3|Mark Richardson

His mission-- along with his band of post-Mogwai Scottish noisemakers-- is to evoke. When Graham repeated lines like, ""the kids are on fire in the bedroom,"" and, ""in my dreams I watch Emily dance,"" on the Twilight Sad's debut LP, 2007's  <i>Fourteen Autumns and Fifteen Winters</i>, the specifics were left hauntingly up in the air. It's a tactic used by several of the singer's self-serious forebears-- from Joy Division's Ian Curtis to Interpol's Paul Banks-- but one step too far into the abstract and there's too little for listeners to hang their own shared dilemmas upon. With follow-up <i>Forget the Night Ahead</i>, Graham takes his cryptic musings into a pitch-black place, but he still connects enough to make all the fraught drama worthwhile-- especially when coupled with guitarist Andy MacFarlane's still-overwhelming Kevin Shields-by-way-of-Thurston Moore torrents.</p>
<p>Since <i>Fourteen Autumns</i> contained many (albeit vague) references to a severely traumatic childhood, it often sounded like a form of coded primal scream therapy. The album cover showed a cartoon mother angrily waving her masked son away; the album's companion EP,  <i>Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did</i>, showed the masked son suffocating the same mother with a pillow. With his mommy and daddy issues sufficiently exorcised, Graham moves onto more adult worries with <i>Forget the Night Ahead</i>-- there's still no summer or spring in Twilight Sad World, and the days are even shorter this time around. And there's no youthful spirit to balance out the dread, either, as it's allowed to run amok throughout the album's 11 punishing tracks. To wit, the closest thing resembling a love song, the roiling ""Interrupted"", is topped off by Graham murmuring, ""you and I will bury them all."" It will not be played at weddings. Funerals, maybe.</p>
<p>While Graham has done many interviews over the last few years, he likes to keep mum when it comes to the meaning of his words. ""I've never told anyone what my songs are about, and I don't intend to,"" he once said. And, in a recent Pitchfork interview, he had this to say about <i>Forget the Night Ahead</i>: ""Things happened to me and [the album is] basically about trying to forget what happened."" Such tactics are hardly enlightening, but they are smart. Because this band's tempest of meat-slap drums and fire-engine-from-hell distortion makes the mind go to disturbing places with very little provocation.</p>
<p>""The Room"" is not a particularly detailed song title, but given the track's shadowy images of ""nails in our feet"" and a creepy ""grandson's toy in the corner,"" it's pretty clear this four-walled space is not all that welcoming. ""Look what you have done,"" says Graham on the song, without telling-- its central offense is as diabolical as you want it to be. The same fill-in-the-blank logic goes for careening stand-out ""That Birthday Present"", which is not about a Barnes and Noble gift certificate. Possibly alluding to an alcohol-addled friend/lover who can't help but miss their own candles burning out while going ""nowhere,"" the track is a fireball of frustration and anger and gliding guitar corrosion. ""The curtains closed again,"" sings Graham, offering an apropos visual to his own writing style-- listening to <i>Forget the Night Ahead</i> is like looking at silhouetted neighbors through a draped window; the shapes are there but it's hard to say whether someone's being murdered or preparing the family dinner.</p>
<p>With any sort of levity galaxies upon galaxies away, the LP's non-stop direness can read like a self-fulfilling prophecy, i.e., while it may be hard to tell each song apart, the overall effect is not easy to shake. ""You'll never have some honest fun,"" goes Graham on ""Made to Disappear"", perhaps offering a bit of self-flagellation for his own sins. And there is an almost puritanical streak running through the record-- shame, ghosts, and ""people downstairs"" are constantly encroaching on the singer's consciousness. So is Graham really such an immaculate downer? Guitarist MacFarlane gave his front man up ever-so-slightly in a recent interview, admitting that Graham often ""sits in his hotel room on the Skype and we all go out partying"" while on tour. While the hopeless, unrequited pair in the middle of ""Seven Years of Letters"" could seemingly end up simultaneously sipping poison, in reality, they just might be bawling through a webcam. We'll never know. Luckily, the Twilight Sad deal with the real world on their own heavily shrouded terms.</p></div>"|13493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13493-forget-the-night-ahead/|7.3|Ryan Dombal

White Americans are confronted with their role in the legacy of slavery and their responsibility for the cultural and social structures it left behind. Immigrants, a child of divorced parents, and a self-hating gay teenager get a keep-your-head-up. The ostracized, leprous son of a plantation owner learns to sing from the field hands, only to reject his family's adulation of his talents when he realizes they won't let those same field hands inside their house. These are some of the ways Brother Ali focuses his storytelling talents on <i>Us</i>, and I just wanted to mention that as soon as possible because some people may prefer an advance warning when a rap album is filled with what is perceived as moralistic sermonizing.</p>
<p>But this isn't ""moralistic sermonizing"" where Brother Ali is concerned-- it's displays of a humane, often-troubled conscience. For an MC who has so many tracks which denote his ""bad motherfucker"" status, his persona's dominated by a welcoming strain of populist empathy, an attitude that offers an accessible solidarity just for listening. And unless you happen to be someone who thinks he's a better MC than Ali is, this man will not actually talk down to you, no matter how sociopolitically agitated he gets. If rap didn't exist, he'd be the greatest high school guidance counselor in Minneapolis. But as a talent in a scene that holds decades' worth of some of the most sensitive identity politics of any popular culture movement in the last 50 years, Brother Ali has had to put that populism to good use.</p>
<p>The political material on <i>Us </i>is powerful without being self-righteous: ""The Travelers"" runs through every dehumanizing abuse in the slave trade in its gutwrenching first verse, then spends the second hinging on culpability, complete with an admission that he's been ""terrified to admit it's wrong/ 'Cause I'm hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on."" The blues-cadenced ""Breakin' Dawn"", meanwhile, works in both a literal and allegorical sense, with the story of the master's son taught to sing by the slaves a fable that also hints at latter-day whitewashing in the music industry (and, by potential extension, that theoretical listener who bumps Brother Ali without paying heed or respect to his influences). And while ""Games"" resembles your typical get-off-the-corner message rap on the surface, Ali puts himself on the hustler's level instead of scolding him. Still, the man does have his limits: ""House Keys"" has his family moving downstairs from the second floor of a duplex only to find that his new upstairs neighbors are a bunch of noisy, bickering small-time drug dealers, a problem which he addresses by sneaking into their place when they're out, stealing all their shit, and selling it.</p>
<p>He does have moments where he makes himself the subject, whether needy and heartbroken on ""You Say (Puppy Love)"" or rolling his eyes at haters on ""Crown Jewel"". And there's still plenty of times-- ""Bad Mufucker Pt. II"", ""'Round Here"", ""Fresh Air""-- where he seems content to rattle off gratitude-swagger testimonials to his own career, a tendency that's served his style well from the beginning. I've read a few dismissals of Ali's style as a blatant copy of Pharoahe Monch's, and I don't quite hear it beyond the subtle debt practically every indie rapper ever owes Organized Konfusion: Ali's lyricism forgoes Monch's rewind-provoking abstraction for an approach heavy on straightforward scene-setting, willing to sacrifice complex internal rhyme schemes and rimshot metaphors if it means he can paint you a clearer picture. With those strengths, he's somewhere between the intense street-scholar style of Freeway-- who appears, along with Joell Ortiz, on the shit-talk highlight ""Best@it""-- and an eloquent everyman like Murs, who has a non-rapping cameo telling an amusing story about how Brother Ali's mere presence cooled down a tense situation. Dude can still be pretty acrobatic when he wants to-- ""The Preacher"" makes for a hell of a skeptic-converter-- yet there's also a clarity and non-pretension to his lyrics that, coupled with the smooth rasp of his voice, makes them fully attention-commanding.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this album's original title was <i>Street Preacher</i>, a concept that still manifests in a few spots (like the Chuck D intro and the track it segues into, ""The Preacher""). And ANT, who's produced nearly everything Ali's spit over since his Rhymesayers debut, <i>Shadows on the Sun</i>, turns in a characteristic set of clean, crisp modern soul that accompanies his usual 1970s-skewing R&amp;B touchstones (mournfully-glimmering minimalist g-funk on ""Slippin' Away""; slinky Bar-Kays strut on ""Fresh Air"") with a gospel-soul current. It's a proper backdrop for an album that stands as the most deeply thought-provoking work of Brother Ali's career, an album that draws its strengths from the simultaneous expression of sympathy toward the people in the songs and anger toward the shit they've gone through. The album's title track is gospel personified-- a choir, handclaps, and a rapt MC laying down his idealistic vision of an America that still feels a long way off: ""Can't nobody be free unless we're all free/ There's no me and you, it's just us.""</p></div>"|13475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13475-us/|7.8|Nate Patrin

The debut full-length from the semi-mysterious collective known as Music Go Music-- a collection of all nine tracks culled from the three 12"" the band released over the last year and a half-- is an obvious homage to ABBA, the Carpenters, ELO, and other purveyors of the unironic, sugary pop that was a mainstay of 1970s radio. And perhaps not since those bands themselves has someone made such assuredly hooky, dramatically multi-layered tunes such as these. In an era when bedroom-acoustic intimacy and laptop-pop accessibility seem to rule independent music (picking up, thanks to widely available technology, where punk left off with its ""anyone can make music"" ethos), it's refreshing to hear a band embracing overblown sentiment and matching it with massive choruses and sprawling production.</p>
<p>""Light of Love"", the single from their first 12"", is still MGM's best song, replete with bouncing ""woah woah woah""s, wonderfully cheesy, spacey synthesizer effects, joyous handclaps, and Gala Bell's buttery smooth, echo-laden vocals. But hearing all their songs collected together for the first time, you'll notice that the band isn't content to simply master the epic joy of Scandinavian pop, but also embraces the darker, sadder, funkier impulses of their influences. Both ""Warm in the Shadows"", with its disco bass and wakka-wakka guitars, and album opener ""I Walk Alone"", with its churning minor-key synth figure, build shadowy, roiling beds for Bell's smooth, astral tones (often harmonized against each other or simply overdubbed into endless reverberations) for an effect akin to that on ABBA's ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"". And piano ballad ""Goodbye, Everybody"" is the kind of simple, sentimental, ""Rainy Days and Mondays""-like weeper that ruled the Adult Contemporary charts in 1971, bolstered by Bell's (mostly unadorned) sadly sweet soprano singing clichés like, ""it can't be right to feel so wrong,"" with such earnestness that it will make you nostalgic for a time before such a sentiment was a cliché.</p>
<p>Though the band may disagree, it does not diminish the magic of Music Go Music's time-machine pop to admit who its members are. Though they go by aliases-- Gala Bell, Kamer Maza, TORG-- the band's core is actually comprised of Meredith and David Metcalf and Adam Siegel of gospel-pop Los Angelinos Bodies of Water, and their lineup is augmented (as recent live performances and videos have proven) by members of Beachwood Sparks, Mezzanine Owls, and the Chapin Sisters. I mention this, not to dispel the band's welcome mystery in this age of the overshare, but to elucidate why this blatant attempt at retread feels so fresh. Bodies of Water, even on their sepia-toned last album, <i>A Certain Feeling</i>, are known for three things: the revival-tent fervor of their performances, the goosebump-inducing vocals of their female frontperson, and lyrically, the religious power they ascribe to love. Music Go Music take those attributes and-- to borrow another cliché from rock's past-- turn them up to 11. This makes for songs that percolate with the urgency and precision of Bodies of Water's best, but with an added pop gloss often lacking from their music.</p>
<p>Admittedly, if you own MGM's three 12""s, then there is nothing new for you here. And sure, there is something about <i>Expressions</i> that feels akin to listening to karaoke-- compliments to the songwriters who could so well imitate the likes of Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson in their own originals-- but with a voice like Meredith Metcalf's (sorry, ""Gala Bell's"") singing the sort of addicting, tangy melodies that her briny soprano was made for, even karaoke can be thrilling. After all, I would rather hear Music Go Music's silky, expertly handled faux version of ABBA than Pierce Brosnan's embarrassing verbatim one any day.</p></div>"|13457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13457-expressions/|7.2|Rebecca Raber

Despite the record opening with the sound of a cello, if that collage art on the album's cover doesn't remind you of Guided by Voices, the rest of the opening track certainly will. ""A Guide to the World's Most Fantastic Monsters"" picks up on a lesson well learned from GbV-- not bluster or inscrutability, but brevity. It's a hell of a rallying cry for a midtempo opening track, and when the call-and-response comes in, the song really lifts off; not a second is wasted. They pull the same effective trick on ""Station"", with singer Ryan Walsh's weary double-tracked voice sounding a little more like Conor Oberst than Robert Pollard on that one, which is twice as charming for being half as long as you'd expect.</p>
<p>But the rest of the time-- starting with the quick waltz-time strum of ""The Might Come Back Club""-- the band gets down to sounding like real, mature musicians, with Walsh ranting and occasionally bleating out the vivid lyrics he's becoming known for. Walsh's lyrics are less concerned with cramming syllables and sounding ""literary"" and more about detailed scenes with curious abstractions recurring throughout, which linger in the mind even when the melodies don't. It's an album of haunted minds, ominous figures that could be angels or devils, dreams delivered from character to character, and forgotten boxes of tapes in garages that wind up meaning the difference between life or death.</p>
<p>The music is just as ambitious, but it's much the same ambition heard on many of the most popular indie records of the past few years: the starched-collar strings, the buoyant brass countermelodies, the ranting speak-sung vocals, and, of course, the big crescendos. They're still played tastefully-- the record's most cautious and polite arrangement, ""Oxus Pagoda"", is its irresistibly melodic. That track has all the strings and horns and syncopated drums set apart by the warm hum of organ underneath; this, and not the number of instruments on the track, shows the band's attention to detail.</p>
<p>While the record's runtime could have been trimmed, the LP does have a welcome diversity, from swaying country-inflected tunes like ""Put the Gurus in Charge"" and ""Classic Tapes"" to more tense, layered workouts like ""Blank Passports"" and ""Allied Lions"". When coming around to the tooting horns of ""Variations on the Grand National Championships"" or the slow-motion string plucking of ""The Echo Sequence"", you may get a creeping jaded feeling at the big crescendos and polite arrangements that have become a calling card for what a lot of people consider indie; of course, people still like those calling cards, and Hallelujah the Hills do them as well as most. The band has more command of that style this time around, and that'll make fans happy and hopefully bring in some more. But the band is good enough, and Walsh is compelling enough as a writer, that they have me wishing they'd step outside of it a little next time.</p></div>"|13461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13461-colonial-drones/|6.8|Jason Crock

During a 2004 collaboration- and cover-heavy tour billed ""An Evening with Bright Eyes, Jim James, and M. Ward,"" the quartet committed to making an album when time permitted. Recorded in bursts in Malibu and Omaha, <i>Monsters of Folk</i> often took the backseat to its creators' primary concerns. Since that tour, Oberst released three successively weak albums as Bright Eyes before leaving his own label and recasting himself as a wild-eyed, globe-trotting troubadour under his own name for Merge Records. Ward, now Oberst's labelmate, has since released four albums of retro distillations, including <i>Volume One</i>, the debut of his project with actress Zooey Deschanel known as She &amp; Him. James' My Morning Jacket has grown into one of the biggest American rock bands, his distinctive, reverb-heavy vocals and his band's sharp riffs and hooks putting them somewhere between, say, Wilco and the Black Crowes. Meanwhile, Mogis has produced records by Ward, Oberst, Tilly and the Wall, Cursive, and about a dozen others.</p>
<p>In many ways, <i>Monsters of Folk</i> feels like a summary statement for the inconsistent careers of the musicians behind it. Like the combined output of all four, these 15 tracks-- a mix of highs and lows, stylistic risks and reservations, songs that sound either exactly or nothing like the past of the person singing it-- are as frequently frustrating as they are satisfying. An album about God and love, neighbors and friends, it's the sort of lived-in record that too often feels too comfortable to compel.</p>
<p>Very few of the tunes here are flawless, but most of them at least deliver something interesting. Oberst's ""Temazcal"", for instance, fumbles through a listless decoupage of pagan and Spanish images and lands more than once on maudlin lyrics that seem like Facebook status updates. ""The love we made at gunpoint wasn't love at all,"" he offers, besting himself with the next verse: ""Blew open my mind. Now it's an empty room."" But astral harmonies arch around his frail voice, ensconcing it within a warm falsetto glow. Acoustic guitars build in halos that suggest James Blackshaw with a four-track. They swell and collapse, settling against the click of programmed drums. Smart production props Ward's droopy ""Slow Down Jo"", too. He offers generic advice for a busy, maybe debauched friend, easing it out with a lassitude that makes you commiserate with the fast-living guy instead of the sensible one. But Mike Mogis' steel guitar stretches like a sigh. James wraps a gorgeous choir beneath Ward, and Oberst rotates between washed-out piano and steel drums. All those textures accomplish what the song itself cannot-- to make deceleration appealing. And though it takes a hackneyed stand on issues of mind control, media manipulation, and The Man over a droll, Western barroom bounce, ""Baby Boomer"" twists references to pirates, censors, Christopher Columbus, and big-box book stores into imprecations that are certainly clever, if not altogether provocative.</p>
<p>If that all sounds critical of Ward and Oberst, fine: Between tracks two and 10, James takes only one lead turn, allowing the album to drift into a bland, generally mid-tempo roots-rock torpor. Ward does his nostalgic Americana best (the fragmentary ""Goodway"" and the Tennessee Two-tickin' ""Baby Boomer""). Oberst overwrites and oversings in his overwrought way (the forced and didactic ""Man Named Truth"" and the staid ""Ahead of the Curve""). These songs offer no surprises. But, with the exception of the aching, gorgeous closer ""His Master's Voice"", James' five contributions to <i>Monsters of Folk </i>are left turns. On ""Losin Yo Head"", the rock burst that finally ends the mid-album doldrums, he sings as if leading Cheap Trick, peeling back his trademark reverb to step in front of the album's most aggressive moment. Not coincidentally, it's one of the album's addictive tunes.</p>
<p>Indeed, only James consistently works to move beyond his mold, a quality that's often defined My Morning Jacket's mixed catalog, too. On the gorgeous opener, ""Dear God (Sincerely M.O.F.)"", he and Mogis (the disc's stars, no question) shape a subtle soul track with harp, synthesizers, and samples drums from ""Is There Any Love"", a cut from the Numero Group's <i>Good God!</i> collection that's also been lifted by Kid Cudi. He passes the second and third verses to Ward and Oberst respectively, and they both handle their theological plea with care. Their distinctive voices bend to meet the difficult beat, and, as they ask these big questions of the universe, they sound sincere, approachable and interested. It's as if having to verbalize these misgivings-- ""If your love's still around/ Why do we suffer?""-- inspired a shift in their fundamental approach. The opener is as intriguing as it is unexpected. It's just too bad, then, that the rest of the album continues to ask similar questions, but never again with the same vigor or innovation.</p></div>"|13501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13501-monsters-of-folk/|6.5|Grayson Currin

And this month, all those lives are playing out simultaneously-- it's either extremely fortuitous or unfortunate timing that Ono's first album of all-new material in nine years arrives in the wake of the 09-09-09 Beatles bonanza (in which, regrettably, she has once again been <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/the-beatles/46667"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cast as the villain</a>).<br><br>But while the rest of the world straps on video-game gizmos and pretends to be John Lennon, Ono is resurrecting her late husband's spirit through a much-more subtle gesture-- by crediting her new album to the group they debuted onstage in Toronto 40 years ago this month, the Plastic Ono Band. Of course, the Plastic Ono Band was always more a collaborative concept than a solidified band line-up; it's not like the name's appearance on the cover of <i>Between My Head and the Sky</i> portends the return of Eric Clapton or Ringo Starr to the fold. But the new Plastic Ono Band stays true to the original's loose, friends-and-family vibe, recruiting son Sean Ono Lennon, his former partner Yuka Honda (ex-Cibo Matto), and fellow Japanese art-pop maverick Cornelius, among others. And after a series of releases (2007's <i>Yes, I'm a Witch</i> and <i>Open Your Box</i>) that updated Ono's signature songs with help from the many artists she's influenced (Cat Power, Le Tigre), the reclamation of the Plastic Ono Band name-- and specifically, its exploratory aesthetic-- signals that Ono is ready to plow forward once again.<br><br>Opener ""Waiting for the D Train"" wastes no time getting the wheels in motion, with Yoko's echo-drenched squeals driving a berserker garage-rock rhythm that's less about the mundane feeling of waiting for a subway car than the giddily dangerous sensation of riding it off the rails. That same night-in-Manhattan energy manifests itself in a decidedly different manner on the LCD-like electro-disco workout ""The Sun Is Down"", contrasting Ono's monotone title mantra with layers of huffing and puffing vocal tics that evoke the carnal, animalistic promise of the moonlight. Completing the album's solid opening trifecta is ""Ask the Elephant"", a slice of sax-squawked absurdist funk that showcases the percussive quality of Ono's voice, recalling the heady, hypno-grooves of 1971's incomparable <i>Fly</i>.<br><br>But <i>Between My Head and the Sky</i> becomes a bit of a muddle in the middle, with Plastic Ono Band's free-form approach yielding less satisfying results. And the tracklist momentum gets tripped by the fact that some songs feel like rough sketches for the ones that immediately follow: while the aquatic sound effects and wordless, orgasmic coos of ""Moving Mountains"" provide little in the way of payoff, the same devices are put to more effective use in the Krautrockin' ""Calling"". And if the mid-tempo, reggaefied exercise ""Hashire, Hashire"" doesn't get interesting until starts Ono unleashing her creepy, crying wails in the final minute, the ensuing title track picks up on that cue, placing those unsettling sounds atop a tough porno-funk groove, and coming on like Serge Gainsbourg's <i>Historie De Melody Nelson</i> by way of <i>The Exorcist</i>.<br><br><i>Between My Head and the Sky</i> simmers down considerably in its closing third, shifting away from boisterous band jams toward meditative tone poems and piano pieces. The album's longest song is its most serene-- ""Feel the Sand"", a ripple of acoustic oscillations that aren't too many campfires removed from Animal Collective's <i>Sung Tongs</i>-- but also its most trite, with Yoko dispensing a stream of New Agey eco-slogans (""listen to the sound of the planet"") like a yoga instructor. More affecting is the album's closing string of piano ballads, which preach a similar ideal of universal love, but from the mournful perspective of someone who's spent many years of her life fighting for it and then suddenly dealing with its absence. Were it not for the fact that she's just recently launched her own label (Chimera Music), you'd think Ono had planned ""I'm Going Away Smiling"" as her career send-off, a beautifully desolate I-will-survive serenade that deserves to become a drag-queen diva standard for years to come. But if this song and its equally bittersweet successor ""Higa Noburu"" suggest Ono's writing her own epitaph, the album's extremely brief final track tells a different story: amid 20 seconds of destructive sledge-hammering sounds, Ono cheerfully declares, ""It's me, I'm alive."" Only someone who's lived lives like hers could make such plain and simple words sound so defiant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|13460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13460-between-my-head-and-the-sky/|7.3|Stuart Berman

Tillman's got one a hell of a voice, of course: The newest Fleet Foxes member wasn't just plopped down behind the drumkit post-<i>Sun Giant</i> 'cuz he gives good beard. It merits mention that Tillman's been crafting hushed folk yearners for years, and that <i>Year in the Kingdom</i> is Tillman's second LP of 2009. And it's right around here that we can stop bringing up those other dudes; whereas Foxes trade in the precise and the pristine, Tillman's songs drift along like a piece of ragged wood in the river, a little gnarled but easygoing nevertheless. He's also dealing in a much more contemporary style of folk, kinda, taking plenty of cues from Mark Kozelek's placidly expansive work with Sun Kil Moon and even more recently Bon Iver's ambient whirl. Tillman's records-- and there's no shortage-- are quiet, pensive, unassuming things, Sunday morning kick-around music. And, while the loose, oft-airy tunes can occasionally feel inexact, when cloaked in that voice and a few inspired rattletrap arrangements, you'll barely register the deficit.</p>
<p><i>Year in the Kingdom</i> kicks off with its tidy title track, a strummy, stripped-way-back affair with nothing more than Tillman and his guitar. It's a pleasant enough intro, but I'd have gone with the significantly more adorned ""Crosswinds"" to kick things off. Tarting Tillman's tune up is a touch of banjo and a few woos while the whistling of the wind teases out the nooks and crannies of its central melody; the effect is not unlike Jim O'Rourke's crackling but never overdone production on <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>, with a relatively straightaway song taking on new dimension with the addition of a few key elements. Tillman's long been good at coloring in his compositions on wax; his partiality to slow and steady song structure and his avoidance of most vocals besides his own does leave plenty of room to screw around, but there's an incidental feel to the extraneous noise here, in service of the song rather than some kind
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
of cloak.</p>
<p>As a lyricist, not unlike Foxes' Robin Pecknold, he leans on the pastoral pretty hard, and there's some references to laying a lamb on somebody I suspect might just be biblical. But even when they fail to connect on their own terms, there's a journeyman feel to his words as they unspool (helped along by his lived-in pipes) that conveys meaning even when it's not necessarily there, evoking images of long walks under the stars and that sort of thing. That, plus Tillman's intimate, close-miced voice, does lend <i>Year in the Kingdom</i> a lonesome, somber tone, one Tillman-- a funny, amicable dude, if you've ever heard him clowning on himself at a Fleet Foxes gig-- would do well to shake on occasion. Next time, maybe; for now, the stout, supine <i>Year in the Kingdom</i>, Tillman's second fine record of the year, will certainly do.</p></div>"|13467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13467-year-in-the-kingdom/|6.9|Paul Thompson

In fact, you probably have more people on your Facebook friends list than there are copies of this floating around out there. For one thing, it's a vinyl-only, 5x12"" release. For another, it reissues material few beyond techno freaks heard the first time around, in such a way that even fewer people are going to be able to hear it now. I'm of two minds about this. On the one hand, it's quasi-minimalist, breakbeat-driven  techno-funk, designed to be mixed. So the format, at least, makes sense. Even Craig's releases as 69 avoid his late-era repetition through their cut-up synth riffage, alternating between sandpaper raw and new-age relaxed, and unpredictably looped breaks, they're still designed to be diced hard between two turntables.</p>
<p>It's the availability that rankles. <i>Filter King</i> finally collects some of Craig's best work, out of a large and hard to track down catalog. 69 tracks like ""Desire"" sound A-OK at home, treating the calloused functionalism of first-wave hip-house to a warm, salted bath in Detroit keyboards. Far be it from me to tell the man how he should administer his own music, but a wider release-- even if not on CD and/or digital-- wouldn't feel quite so... alienatingly cultish.</p>
<p>Because this is not difficult music. Craig-as-69 was about the overlap between the rave's peak and the post-club late-night drive, the ""innerspace journeys"" rhetoric of techno and the crowd-pleasing bumpiness of urban radio from multiple eras. ""Jam the Box"" is so unpretentiously rugged I wouldn't have been surprised to hear it in a Baltimore club music mix. On the other end of the 69 spectrum, ""Microlovr"" is as spectrally wiggy as anything on Warp between the bleep era and the wilderness period of Autechre-ian over-programming. But crucially there's always a body-rock undertow that stuff often abjured.</p>
<p>As a collection, <i>Filter King</i> is all-things-to-all-people for fans of the ""funky and proud"" side of electronic dance. Techno-identified stuff in the aughts still has plenty to recommend it, but I'd take the low-res wallop of <i>Filter King</i> over the perfectly sculpted sleekness of cross-continental new-millennium minimalism nine times out of 10. Sure, compared to the bite-sized editing of Hawtin school graduates, the antic beat to ""Frequency Finale"" sounds like Toni Basil's ""Mickey"" with two poppers jammed up its nostrils. That's why it's so fun.</p>
<p>As someone who's mostly immune to the dry, deadening arpeggios of Craig's much-lauded 21st-century remix work, I appreciated the reminder of a time when he could swing, or get dumb, so effortlessly. Again, you want to deduct points for restricting the music to obsessives, but like those hardcore bands still releasing seven-inches (and Jim O'Rourke), Craig's decision can be read as a bracing fuck-you to all those .rar blogs.</p></div>"|13495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13495-69-the-legendary-adventures-of-a-filter-king/|6.8|Jess Harvell

It's been an appropriate stage name over the past decade for Canada's Joel Gibb, describing aptly the explicit sexuality of his lyrics and the dark undertone hiding beneath his baroque orchestrations and genteel vocals. But <span> </span>most of all, the name telegraphs the band's distinctive playfulness (if we're thinking hidden cameras more in the ""Candid Camera"" sense than the Erin Andrews sense), a joyful glee that turns their concerts into pep rallies and makes Gibb's songs humorous without being novelty.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But the inevitable trajectory of any band, any life really, is to evolve from goofy prankster fun to rote adult seriousness. That's not always a bad thing, musically, but can the foundations of a concept like the Hidden Cameras-- with its Oscar Wilde wryness-- withstand the thematic shift? When asked about the old ""jubilant"" material, Gibb told a <a href=""http://torontoist.com/2008/01/tall_poppy_inte_58.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hometown website</a>, ""that naivety is kind of worn, I would say."" Depressing words from the man who titled his last record with perhaps the most economical description of the band's sound and message to date (<i>Awoo</i>) and who bookended his best album with two songs about watersports-- and I don't mean synchronized swimming.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Like a pitcher tipping his curveball, <i>Origin: Orphan</i> signals this increased gravity in familiar fashion: two minutes of thick drone to introduce the dreary ""Ratify the New"". Wide-screen ambitious, the crescendos are both too bleak to be inspirational and too mannered to be cathartic. The album's other landmarks are equally drenched in gloom: with its chattering preset drums and air-raid guitars, the self-loathing title track is easily the dreariest thing Gibb's ever set to tape, and <span> </span>closer ""Silence Can Be a Headline"" is a sludge through last-dance arpeggios and maudlin strings. Only ""Walk On"" stands out among the new-direction material, retaining the boisterous chamber pop the Hidden Cameras are known for, but cranking the tempo down to a New Orleans funeral crawl with Gibb's searching tenor fitfully peeking through.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But as depressing as these hit-or-mostly-miss attempts to slow down and get serious may be, it's even more deflating to hear the songs that approach the Hidden Cameras' old team spirit but fall short. ""He Falls to Me"" and ""Colour of a Man"" both contain disappointingly monotone vocal lines rather than Gibb's typically ornate vocal runs, and show glimpses of hitting the raucous folk-punk strides off earlier material before slipping out of gear.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Only in a couple of places does the band's old giddiness shine through. ""Underage"" is a brief reprise of Gibb's sauciness, with a risqué refrain-- ""let's do it like we're underage""-- made taboo when Gibb asks his partner, ""I'll pretend you're seven, you'll pretend I'm eight."" The song's <i>Graceland</i>-ish afro/electro-pop vibe is also very in tune with indie trends, a timeliness the Hidden Cameras come by honestly after peppering their songs with Ladysmith-lite backing chants. And Gibb adds a synth-pop edge-- flirting dangerously with the band's Magnetic Fields resemblance-- on the 8-bit beat of ""Do I Belong?"" and by borrowing Pete Townshend's old keyboard for the contagious ""In the NA"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But when Gibb blandly promises there to ""marry one day in the NA,"" it's hard not to recall his impish proposal to ""Ban Marriage"" three albums ago, just as the gay marriage movement began to catch fire. That mischief is largely missing from <i>Origin: Orphan</i>, and the lack of lyrical cleverness seems to have infected the music as well, making for a mostly cloudy listen from a formerly sunny-day band. You can't blame Joel Gibb for wanting to grow up, but nobody wants to watch a hidden camera unless it's focused on something fun and forbidden.</p></div>"|13488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13488-origin-orphan/|5.2|Rob Mitchum

Either you carry a certain nostalgist's sentiment for one of your early rock touchstones (I fall into this camp), or you view them as the root of all that was overwrought and evil about mid-to-late-90s guitar music. Sure, everyone knows PJ sold eleven trillion albums between 1991 and '94, but still I imagine it's difficult for relative young'uns to reconcile how strong an opinion so many people in a specific demographic have about a group that hasn't been commercially or critically relevant for over a decade.</p>
<p><i>Backspacer</i>, the group's ninth studio album, seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster. Virtually the whole record settles into the same formula the band's been dutifully churning out since the dawn of the millennium-- lively but almost utterly hookless riff-driven hard rock. Lather, rinse, repeat. And when I say ""riff-driven"" I really mean ""almost entirely riff-dependent,"" because musically the riffs themselves are typically the only things worth your attention.</p>
<p>PJ's long-dormant punk and hardcore proclivities (ugh, ""Lukin"") have been rising to the surface with greater regularity in recent years, and I'll admit in short bursts this bulldozing approach can be somewhat satisfying. The opening four songs kick-start and then keep up a certain pleasing level of propulsiveness, with the goofily fast-and-loose ""Gonna See My Friend"" (hey, is that an actual bassline I hear?) and Thin Lizzy-ish double entendres of ""Johnny Guitar"" being particularly listenable. Sooner or later, however, you remember these guys wouldn't know a melody if it bit them in the ass. What's worse, this chugging blitzkrieg negates the power of the band's greatest weapon, Eddie Vedder's voice, which can display its craggy richness and masculine grace only when the band isn't trying to break land-speed records. (I know some folks hate Ed's singing, but it mostly seems like they're reacting to the fact that his voice launched a thousand Nickelbacks, which is like hating ""The Simpsons"" because of ""Family Guy"" or ""American Dad""<i>.</i>)</p>
<p>The gentle ""Just Breathe"" might seem like the perfect opportunity for Vedder to finally dust off those resonant pipes, but instead he sings the tune with a distractingly country-ish catch in his voice, plus the tune is numbingly syrupy and the lyrics, after a promisingly pointed start (""I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love"") devolve into tedium. The same hit-or-miss sensitivity marks ""The End""-- Vedder inexplicably finds it necessary to remind us he's ""just a human being"" on one song and ""just another human being"" on the other-- but at least ""The End"" manages to land on the right side of affecting thanks to its painfully honest depiction of romantic dissolution (""This is not me/ You see/ Believe/ I'm better than this/ Don't leave""). Still, we have to rely on ""Amongst the Waves"" to deliver anything remotely resembling the soaring anthemics that used to be a PJ trademark (what I wouldn't give for a ""Light Years"" even). The back half of the album sure isn't inclined to help, largely abandoning even the modest steamrolling enjoyment of the record's initial jolt in favor of thoroughly forgettable mid-tempo dreck, save for ""Supersonic"", which nonetheless sounds like a band trying to be the Ramones minus the fun.</p>
<p>It's an extremely odd thing to say about a band that for three or four years was the biggest rock megalith on the planet, but nowadays Pearl Jam are the very definition of anonymously workmanlike, seemingly plugging along with their heads down from one colorlessly unimaginative album to the next. Once upon a time this was a group that was on top of the world and yet still took all kinds of bizarre chances, recording shit like lengthy tape experiments and songs about bugs-- often ridiculously self-indulgent, sure, yet always surprising. Now, paradoxically, with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book.</p></div>"|13480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13480-backspacer/|4.6|Joshua Love

Jawbox reissues in the pipeline, and Sunny Day Real Estate reissues on the street. The just-announced Pavement reunion. The Jesus Lizard at the 2009 Pitchfork Music Festival. And now, a new Shudder to Think live record? Nineties-me is totally stoked by the resurgence of decade-old stalwarts; throw in a few more key acts from that era and we're talking a total nerdgasm. (I'm looking at you, Jawbreaker.) All of this inevitably funnels down to a Blues Traveler reunion or something, so let's enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Based in Washington, D.C., Shudder to Think was born in the mid-1980s, a time when punk music was learning to handle shades of emotion beyond violent anger. Old dudes in combat boots will tell you that this stuff was called ""emo,"" if you can believe it. But even among emo bands, Shudder to Think were <i>out there</i>. They weren't confessional, unless you count lyrics like ""Poor little girl/ Screaming traffic in her hair,"" repeated neurotically in eerie falsetto, as confessional. And they seemed at least as indebted to Judy Garland and David Bowie as they were to Minor Threat and Government Issue.</p>
<p>Shudder to Think's influences were a stretch even in the post-punk era. They pumped up their aggressively wrought art-rock with healthy portions of glam and power-pop, garnished with show tunes and opera. Nathan Larson's intricate guitar leads were both wild and delicately patterned, like cracks in glass. When they leveled out into pounding waves of riffage, Craig Wedren's voice kept the fey dementia intact. Swerving recklessly from a queasy purr to a panicky vibrato, with a head full of tantrums, he seemed to always exist in the moment just before a terrible accident. He made hissy-fits sound like air-raids, sass like a veneer concealing a robust unwellness. Few guitar-centric bands have so deftly balanced the bruising, the fragile, the anthemic, and the bizarre.</p>
<p>This live disc, culled from a 2008 reunion tour, is a terrific showcase for the band's sickly sweet brutality, which remains fearsome. Joining Wedren and Larson, both of whom play guitar, are drummer Kevin March, who joined the band after their 1994 masterpiece <i>Pony Express Record</i>, bassist Jesse Krakow, and guitarist Mark Watrous (that's right, it's a tri-guitar affair). They engage in a bit of canon revision: There's nothing from their mostly forgotten debut, <i>Curses, Spells, Voodoo, Mooses</i>, and only one song, ""Call of the Playground"", from their mainstream-aimed final album, <i>50,000 B.C.</i> (Okay, there are two if you count ""Red House"", but it was originally released on an earlier album. That Shudder to Think thought a creepy power-pop number about psychedelic drugs was a good mainstream gambit says a lot about them.)</p>
<p>Barring those omissions, it's evenly divided between their three influential Dischord albums-- <i>Get Your Goat</i>, <i>Ten Spot</i>, and<i> </i><i>Funeral at the Movies</i>-- and <i>Pony Express Record</i>, on Epic. I get that people hated <i>50,000 B.C.</i>-- including, apparently, Shudder to Think and/or Team Love, who fail to mention it in the press release-- but I wouldn't have minded hearing ""The Saddest Day of My Life"". Other painful omissions, like ""Earthquakes Come Home"", ""I Blew Away/Ride That Sexy Horse"", and ""Kissi Penny"" only stress Shudder to Think's consistent excellence. Most of their songs feel essential in some way. You really couldn't ask for a much better single-disc set-list than this, which covers fan favorites like ""Shake Your Halo Down"" and ""X-French Tee Shirt"", while making a case for Shudder to Think's dynamic range, from the barreling ""Rag"" to the exquisitely gentle ""Day Ditty"". These days, Wedren's doing MOR-pop and soundtrack stuff, and Larson's doing A Camp, but they sound more inspired here than they have since... well, since they played these songs the first time. New album please.</p></div>"|13473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13473-live-from-home/|7.7|Brian Howe

Take the opposing tracks being followed by two former members of Pulp, Jarvis Cocker and Richard Hawley. Cocker has turned into a urbane elder statesman, old enough to appreciate how great things were when he was 22 yet not close to forgoing new conquests. His recent album <i>Further Complications</i> pulses and grinds with the energy, insecurities, and manic wit of someone trying to charm themselves back in time. It's like a twist on Grinderman's ""No Pussy Blues""-- instead of slow-building frustration from not getting any, Cocker's want is emboldened after every tryst.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Richard Hawley maintains wistful relationships, with women and with the past. He's resigned to let time shuffle by but never quite ready to let the past disappear, which echoes through his songs like a gentle reverb. One could assemble a walking tour of his Sheffield home from the song titles and references he works into his often-melancholy tunes. On <i>Truelove's Gutter</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, the guitarist and his throwback lyrical style seem to literally fade away, hovering above a more atmospheric backdrop of drawn-out notes, rich reverb, and waves of echo made in part by obscure instruments like the cristal baschet. The gorgeous, backward-looking beauty of past releases like <i>Coles Corner,</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> drawn in part from details of Hawley's life in the Northern English city, has shifted toward something more dark, ambient, and withdrawn. It may be too slow for many, but it's more measured than it is mundane.</span></span></p>
<p>Hawley was reared on Elvis Presley, and is the son of a steelworker who played the blues-- this is heartland material, folks-- but listen to how he deals with faded beauty on ""Don't Get Hung Up in Your Soul"". He addresses the one-time appeal of the town not with driving rock but slow notes, pedal steel, and sad understanding, his voice cracking when he reaches for the word ""baby."" He even works in the phrase ""darkness on the edge of town.""</p>
<p>Consider the promises Hawley makes on ""For Your Lover Give Some Time"" to his sweet Helene above plaintive, gentle strings, sounding both world-weary and wise. He will maybe drink a little less, come home earlier, complain less, and watch her mend the holes in her dress. Would these bland domestic tidbits ever factor into Cocker's advances upon a young woman? But the subtle, well-timed drop of the title refrain-- ""for your lover, give some time""-- and Hawley's promise to drop off flowers from the graveyard, elevates those details of a lived-in relationship with emotional resonance.</p>
<p>Hawley can sound too stripped down this time out, and the two songs that hover near the 10-minute mark overplay the appeal of minimal compositions and Hawley's sweet croon. An album like this, filled with longing and a bit of resignation, may be an uneasy fit for today's mood of uncertainty and diminished opportunities. Hawley's mined a specific vein of emotion for years, and it's a testament to his skill that his hyper-local focus maintains such a broad appeal.</p></div>"|13452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13452-trueloves-gutter/|6.7|Patrick Sisson

""No Trouble"" is among the finest examples on his sixth album of all of this at work. His filtered, distant vocal is balanced by thumping drums pushed way up in your face, the occasional squeal of a synthesizer or strummed surf chord and a couple of massive guitar outbursts that erupt like bubbling lava from the song's slow-footed shamble. ""You be my getaway car and I'll steal everything you need,"" Raposa sings just before the final eruption, ramming home the sense of unease and danger the music naturally conjures.</p>
<p>The extremes of Castanets' sound are exemplified by ""Rose"" and ""Lucky Old Moon"". The former opens the record with a bare and dry acoustic guitar part and completely unvarnished vocal, and brings in a bit of string bass, drums, and steel guitar-- there is a tiny bit of keyboard, but it mostly sounds like the last song of the night in some godforsaken roadhouse. ""Lucky Old Moon"" opens with spaced-out keys and a drum machine and never comes back to earth, preferring to shoot Raposa through an icy void. It's a neat look for him and one of the most explicitly electronic/ambient songs on any of his albums. It's also one of many tracks on the album that operates primarily as a mood piece. Raposa's lyrics are frequently great, but in spite of that, feeling trumps songwriting for the most part on <i>Texas Rose</i>.</p>
<p>He does save the best for last, though, as closer ""Dance, Dance"" shows him in complete control of his sound for over six spellbinding minutes. The song is rhythmically spare and has a harmonic structure that welcomes ebb and flow in the arrangement, and Raposa brings in small details to accent lines like, ""We stayed in, dodged our friends/ Did some drugs and our best to disappear."" It ends the album on a note of dejected but oddly graceful beauty, which is perfect territory for a guy of Raposa's talents. Overall, <i>Texas Rose, the Thaw, and the Beasts </i>is a good mood record, a midnight opus that sounds great while it's playing but doesn't much travel with the listener beyond its runtime.</p></div>"|13474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13474-texas-rose-the-thaw-and-the-beasts/|6.8|Joe Tangari

The Chicago imprint was, of course, home to Low for a stretch and in recent years has developed a wider stable of song-friendly artists like Deerhunter and Lotus Plaza. To Kill a Petty Bourgeoisie, the Minneapolis-based two-piece of singer Jehna Wilhelm and multi-instrumentalist Mark McGee, aren't easy to place along this continuum since they operate with one foot in the avant-garde and the other in the structural and, like Low or Deerhunter, tend to draw from both schools.</p>
<p>We last heard from the band in 2007 when it debuted with <i>The Patron</i>, a heady concept piece based loosely around the dangers of unchecked capitalism (more prescient now in the wake of that, uh, global economic crisis), but writers and listeners seemed to give too much weight to the record's content instead of its lush sonics. The real appeal of <i>The Patron</i> was the captivating interplay between the group's two members, the way McGee laid a foundation of interwoven post-rock textures over which Wilhelm could paint her ghostly vocals. With new LP <i>Marlone</i>, the group has smartly jettisoned the storyboard conceptualism of its previous work for a deeper exploration of this sound, and the album is more assured and focused as a result.</p>
<p>The style To Kill a Petty Bourgeoisie pursue on the record isn't new-- you could lump them in with contemporaries Sian Alice Group, Asobi Seksu, even Palms, and there's certainly a Portishead inspiration at play-- but it's what the band does with its shoegaze and post-rock atmospheres that ultimately sets it apart. Part of it is pacing (the sequencing of the record is superb) and part of it is the delicate balance between the contrasting notions of dark and light, heavy and airy, and gloomy and hopeful. <i>Marlone</i>'s individual songs play with these opposites: opener ""You've Gone Too Far"" explores ambient tones with wide-open spaces, expanding and contracting over its nine minutes before the punchier ""The Needle"" sweeps in and pushes things in a more forceful direction.</p>
<p>Sometimes they achieve both in the same song. Album centerpiece ""I Will Hang My Cape in Your Closet"" (bonus points for the super goth title) takes form over a long, scraping instrumental section before Wilhelm introduces a climax of upbeat vocal chants. Most impressive is that they pull off such moments largely without the use of hooks or traditional song structures and, still, the record doesn't wander off course. Instead, TKAPB keep attention with shifts in tone and momentum that seem to appear at just the right time. The most surprising is ""In People's Homes"", a buoyant two-minute pop cut that springs up virtually out of nowhere to loosen the seriousness of <i>Marlone</i>'s second half, which the band then follows up with the industrial dirge ""Turriptosis"". Such balance is no mean feat and is just one of several pleasant surprises the album has to offer.</p></div>"|13481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13481-marlone/|7.7|Joe Colly

Given that TVOTR has previously collaborated with David Bowie and clearly draws significant inspiration from the Thin White Duke's work, it's not much of a leap to hear the name ""Rain Machine"" and think, worryingly, of ""Tin Machine,"" the rock-punchline group Bowie put together in 1988 to make a couple of records that were critically reviled and almost immediately forgotten.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Malone should certainly avoid that fate here-- while the late 80s found Bowie's reputation in freefall, TVOTR is arguably at present the most <span>fêted</span> band in America. Still, the two projects share an overall thrust common to so many sidelight efforts, namely a willingness to subvert expectations and pursue indulgences, to explore rabbit holes that might never have been fully penetrated without the protective cover of a new sobriquet.</span></p>
<p>These divergences aren't immediately revealed, as <i>Rain Machine</i> opens in close proximity to TVOTR's wheelhouse: ""Give Blood"" boasts ragged riffs, an ample bottom end and pleasingly batty vocals, simmering and smoldering like so much of that band's catalogue. However, ""New Last Name"" finds Malone beginning to veer off the beaten path thanks to its meditative bent and lovely guitar filigree, and it's a delicate avenue he also tiptoes down on the folky, sleigh bell-adorned ""Driftwood Heart"" as well the jarringly lovely fingerpicked outro to ""Hold You Holy"".</p>
<p>Even amidst these gentle, atmospheric detours, the album's first half doesn't lack for kinetic drama. Pre-outro, ""Hold You Holy"" is <i>Rain Machine</i>'s most explosive moment, an exultant call of desire and celebration heralded by guitar pyrotechnics. Similarly vigorous, though far more grave, is ""Smiling Black Faces"", which starts off with horrific imagery worthy of Cormac McCarthy (""Bodies strung like tanning hides/ Oh, and the fly-covered babies"") and evolves into a thoroughly riveting, cathartic sermon on race that touches specifically on the tragic murder of Sean Bell, providing a sorely necessary treatment of themes typically ignored in the lily-white indie-rock community.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Malone allows his muse to send him entirely too far afield over the second half of the album, where his art-damaged insularity ossifies into pure self-indulgent torpor. No one will ever mistake TV on the Radio for tight-fisted, two-and-a-half-minute popsmiths, but three of <i>Rain Machine</i>'s final six tracks run eight minutes or longer, and we're not talking about danceable funk workouts here either. ""Desperate Bitch"" and its immediate successor, ""Love Won't Save You"", both lean too heavily on lyrical transgressiveness (sixteen straight minutes of turning tricks, ""castration fear,"" cocks, pussies, pimps and hoes only works when Lou Reed's doing it), but at least the former offers sturdy bass and a fair approximation of Sonic Youth at its most ruminative, while the latter is 476 seconds of savagely strummed guitar and aimlessly plangent pining that Jason Molina would probably find too starkly meandering. And I don't really even know what to say about ""Winter Song"", except that there oughta be a law against releasing an 11-minute song that does include the word ""antediluvian"" but doesn't include an actual freaking groove. Even the surrounding back-half tracks that aren't marathons and are far more listenable for that fact still don't carry much juice.</p>
<p>This damning lack of momentum is a real shame considering Malone is such a gifted, expressive, wide-ranging vocalist, a frequently lovely and fluid guitarist, and generally an interestingly vivid lyricist. Almost all of his tangents are worthy of being followed-- I only wish he'd shed a little more light from time to time to help the rest of us trace his steps.</p></div>"|13479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13479-rain-machine/|6.3|Joshua Love

None of his music has been small, and none of it has lacked for promise. But none of it even began to foretell the scale and sweep of <i>Central Market</i>.</p>
<p><i>Central Market</i> is a big album for an age that has acquainted itself with thinking small about the album both as a vessel for sound and as a standard-bearer for new aesthetic vision. It's big in the sense that it's orchestral-- made in part with the Wordless Music Orchestra, a rangy New York ensemble proficient with everything from strings and xylophones to flutes and kazoos. But <i>Central Market</i> proves bigger in the sense that it's clearly been delivered as a statement record-- a summation of lots of ideas accrued over the years and lots of restless thinking about how best to engage those ideas in ways far from expected.</p>
<p>Braxton came up around the start of the 2000s in the same underground folds that fostered Black Dice and Animal Collective. He wrote music that shared certain rustle-y, ritualistic traits with the early work of both, but Braxton was also more expressive from the start. Especially at startling (and all too rare) live shows that would find him sitting solo on a floor with a mess of effects and a microphone, he would layer loops upon loops of guitar sounds with vocals that he would bellow-- like some strange fusion of formless noise-music with the pent-up goth squirm of Morrissey or Robert Smith.</p>
<p>Vocals of the sort don't wander often into <i>Central Market</i>, but the emotive tilt of them figures into arrangements that address many shades of meaning and mood. ""Opening Bell"" begins it all with an expectant piano trill that builds as it couples with gamely whistling, dark electric guitar, and golden horns, all before spreading into a bright fantasia of strings played within the deep space of the most accomplished classical music. Braxton has a conservatory background and, maybe more importantly, a well-thumbed copy of<i> The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century</i>. Indeed, echoes of that book-- a suggestive survey of modern classical music by storied <i>New Yorker </i>critic Alex Ross-- linger in scores that evoke the studiousness and sonic spread of composers like Igor Stravinsky, Olivier Messiaen, György Ligeti, and many others who addressed both the state of the world and the very idea of ""music"" at its semiotic core.</p>
<p>Not that stoking seriousness is <i>Central Market</i>'s sole province. Some of the barely recognizable vocalese in tracks like ""Uffe's Woodshop"" plays like the kind of almost goofy voice-pitch games that Braxton has played in Battles, a band he's helped rescue from what could otherwise be a mere triumph of rock technicians. And the ways that slide whistles and kazoos dance around portentous guitar in a track like ""The Duck and the Butcher"" make much of their sourcing from, well, slide whistles and kazoos.</p>
<p>Some of the album is experimental and sly, but most of <i>Central Market</i> is searchingly big and magnanimous. The centerpiece, ""Platinum Rows"", flits through stately reserve and composed chaos over 10-plus minutes, given to deep drama and comic celebration that thrive as both for not really showing their cards as either. And as the mood constricts and descends into darkness toward the end-- especially in the guitar/vocal-based ""J. City"", the only song that could be classed as rock at all-- Braxton stumps well for an internal logic at play from the beginning. How that logic manifests itself throughout can prove stunning at times and a bit scattered at others-- but it's always, in ways that count as an important achievement in the end, a galvanizing surprise.</p></div>"|13472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13472-central-market/|8.0|Andy Battaglia

This  isn't quite a full-on Pastels album, either: it's a collaboration with  the Japanese duo Tenniscoats, who were the ones who had the idea for  the collaboration. (The Pastels apparently have an album of their own  in the works, too, although it's been coming along very slowly for a  while.)</p>
<p>In the 90s, the Pastels were  smart enough to realizing that becoming subcultural icons-- champions  of C86! poster children of wide-eyed amateurist innocent indie-shabby-chic!-- meant  that they had to change what they did or risk being trapped in their  adolescence forever. So they slowed way down and hazed way up on 1995's <i> Mobile Safari</i> and 1997's <i>Illumination</i>, shifting their focus  from pop thrills to blurry mindfulness exercises. The version of the  band that turns up here (for longtime Pastels-watchers, they seem  currently to be reduced to a duo of Stephen McRobbie and Katrina Mitchell)  has gone even further down that path: the tempos here are so slow and  the arrangements so spare that every note seems like a tentative step  into too-bright daylight.</p>
<p>The only hint of the Pastels  of two decades ago actually comes from ""Sodane"", one of the  Tenniscoats-directed songs-- there's a rare hint of urgency to its rhythm  and a suggestion of <i>Sittin' Pretty</i> to its one-finger lead guitar  part. Fortunately, Tenniscoats' aesthetic here mostly has more to do  with with the Pastels as they are than as they were back in the days  when a Pastels badge was the sign of membership in an indie-pop sodality-- it's  hard to tell which instrumental details come from which band, and Tenniscoats  vocalist Saya's singing owes something to Mitchell's. (The fragment  of melody that provides the hook of ""Yomigaeru"" involves a  very Pastels-like stretch for notes that are probably somewhere in the  vicinity of where Saya actually lands.)</p>
<p>Sometimes, the result is as  frail and lovely as worn lace; sometimes it's just threadbare. The danger  of inter-band collaborations is that nobody takes responsibility for  the project, and the track list here has been bumped up to a dozen with  the help of a couple of half-formed instrumentals (""Modesty Piece""  is an intro in search of a song that never quite gets there) and a pretty  but relatively by-the-numbers cover of ""About You"" by the  Pastels' Glasgow homies the Jesus and Mary Chain.</p>
<p>When <i>Two Sunsets</i> gels,  though, its foggy shimmer is intermittently lovely. ""Vivid Youth""  isn't much more than a subtle guitar riff, Mitchell singing like she's  just woken up and is still lying on something soft next to someone she  likes a lot, and an off-the-cuff clarinet solo, but as textural songs  go, it's warm, fluffy and fragrant. And the one song that actually sounds  like both bands wrote it together is one of the album's highlights:  ""Song for a Friend"", on which McRobbie, Mitchell and Saya  exchange English and Japanese lyrics as if they're stepping up, one  by one, to voice memories of a time that they understand better now  than they did when it was happening.</p></div>"|13463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13463-two-sunsets/|6.1|Douglas Wolk

<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are cult artists, and then there are <i>cult</i> artists. Judee Sill is a little of both. In one sense of the word, she remains an obscure singer-songwriter with only a passing familiarity with the mainstream (she wrote ""Lady-O"", a hit for the Turtles) but with an avid audience devoted to tracking down every note she recorded. In the other sense of the word, Sill's songs have many of the trappings of an upstart California cult: astral planes, heavenly spaceships, apocalypse, and a unique understanding of a certain crossmaker. By today's standards, it can sound a bit loopy, but also much more benevolent than other cults and cult artists. Hers is a distinctly compassionate worldview, which seems natural given that music served as an escape from the harsh burdens of her reality: broken family, heroin addiction, health problems, stalled career, and an early death.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Perhaps that explains why fans are often so protective of Sill's legacy and also why this new tribute album often sounds so noncommittal. Her complex songs-- which typically emphasize swooping melodic lines and eschew choruses-- demand complete devotion from listeners and performers, and only a handful of these fifteen artists give themselves over so completely to the material. Ron Sexsmith and P.G. Six open and close the compilation with pretty but mundane versions of ""Crayon Angel"" and ""'Til Dreams Come True"", respectively, and in between the Bye Bye Blackbirds reimagine ""There's a Rugged Road"" as a Gram Parsons lament, which isn't that much of a re-imagining. Meg Baird doesn't have the vocal presence to convey the melody on ""When the Bridegroom Comes""; she gets lost in the song. And then Marissa Nadler ignores melody altogether. Accompanied by Black Hole Infinity, her dark, cramped take on ""The Kiss"" favors dull trip-hop atmosphere and a breathless delivery, but feels neither erotic nor celebratory, just grayly downcast and overlong.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For fans, this collection will be of special interest for including two recently discovered compositions that Sill never recorded. ""Reach for the Sky"" turns the hold-up line into a spiritual imperative, but it makes more sense-- at least autobiographically-- as a Sill tune than as a Beth Orton tune, where the message sounds obligatory rather than felt. Bill Callahan's carefully, patiently, glacially paced ""For a Rainbow"" shuffles along for eight long minutes. He doesn't always hold your attention, but his efforts toward eccentricity are appreciated.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The best moments on <i>Crayon Angel</i> are created by the truest believers, whose own idiosyncrasies compete with Sill's. Final Fantasy arranges ""The Donor"" as a variegated pattern of keyboard lines, reducing the tune to 1s and 0s and finding a liturgical melody at its heart. Similarly, Nicolai Dunger's ""Solder of the Heart"" shouldn't work but does; his performance, which combines the vocal mannerisms of an earthier Jeff Buckley and the accompaniment of a Sunday afternoon piano lesson, sounds both refreshingly unrehearsed and evocatively over-the-top. Daniel Rossen resurrects the demo ""Waterfall"" and fills it out nicely, and Princeton not only samples Sill's live introduction to ""Down Where the Valleys Are Low"", but recasts the song as a short, sweet hymn full of oddball percussion, mewing keyboards, and distracted vocals. But the real gem here-- the reason to visit and revisit this collection-- is Frida Hyvönen's ""Jesus Was a Crossmaker"", a lovely, lonely gospel number that features the Swedish singer-songwriter layering her vocals into a celestial choir and unearthing new veins of meaning in the ambiguously scriptural lyrics. More than any other artist on <i>Crayon Angel</i>, Hyvönen understands Sill's intentions and appeal, and this cover sounds positively inevitable, as if Sill had prophesied it years ago.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The fact that Damon McMahon (aka Amen Dunes) recorded <i>DIA</i> while holed up in a Catskills cabin is so fitting it feels like a myth. The album's claustrophobic, voice-in-head tone immediately evokes inner-space travelers like Syd Barrett, Roky Erickson, and Skip Spence. And McMahon's simple songs, fuzzy guitar, and buzzing vocals all sound like the product of some solitary brain, sitting in some isolated cabin, buried deep inside some dark forest.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>It's telling, though, that after he made <i>DIA,</i> McMahon moved to Beijing: as the album progresses, it reveals a musical vision reaching beyond the boundaries of a lonely woods. Early on, his stylistic umbrella expands to let in a Suicide/Spacemen 3 loop, the eerie howls of early Royal Trux, and the post-Barrett folk of Robyn Hitchcock. But his farthest-flung and strongest reference point proves to be the underground sounds of 1980s New Zealand. As McMahon's tunes sharpen and deepen, he becomes like an American cousin to Kiwi songsmiths Alastair Galbraith, Chris Knox, and brothers Graeme and Peter Jefferies.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The key to how McMahon can evoke those greats and still bring some of himself to the mix is his voice. On the surface his singing sounds raw and monotone, pitched in a droning hum and distorted at the edges. But listen closely and you can hear subtle changes that give </span><span><i>DIA</i></span><span><i> </i>a surprising diversity. On ""White Lace"", his singing rises sharply, pulling his guitar along with it. He alternates tough moans and eerie falsettos in the Barrett-ish ""Castles"", and ghosts of Knox and Galbraith emerge via his openly earnest croons in ""No Shot"". By album's end, McMahon's meditative hums are practically all that's left, like shells on a beaten shore glistening in the sunset.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>""Glisten"" is a relative term here-- overall, </span><span><i>DIA</i></span><span><i> </i>is still a rather constricted album, with a tonal range that's pretty narrow despite how much McMahon mines from it. But the record<i> </i>does hold indications of how wide his sound could become, particularly the perfectly-crafted bit of psych-folk called ""Two Thousand Islands"" that pops up near album's end. Here, his modest voice melds beautifully into some clucking, Velvet Underground-ish guitar. That alone is enough to make you look forward to what McMahon comes up with next, perched above a temple in Beijing rather than tucked away in a Northeastern woodland.</span></p>

Indeed, if you're legally listening to your own edition of <i>The Visitor</i>, then you're holding either a compact disc or an LP. Whether for reasons of sound quality, tradition, or both, O'Rourke and Drag City forewent an mp3 release of his new album. You have to, like, pick it up. And inside, on the minimal liner notes, O'Rourke makes his second demand: ""Please listen on speakers, loud,"" he entreats, as if now recording under the name Jimm O))). In the end, these prerequisites presage <i>The Visitor</i>, a unified 38-minute instrumental piece that plays hide-and-go-seek with dozens of instruments, textures, and motifs before refusing to deliver the climax you might have expected. An arrogant pop record, <i>The Visitor</i>'s intricate, long-form composition rewards repeated close listens through its own insistence on subtlety and craft.</p>
<p>Calling <i>The Visitor</i> a pop record is as much of a stretch as it is a reduction, but it's an important distinction to make here. Despite his involvement with well over 100 albums in the past two decades, <i>The Visitor</i> is just the fifth in a string of highly accessible if equally nuanced O'Rourke releases on Drag City. That series began in 1997 with the rustic instrumental <i>Bad Timing</i> and, until now, ended with 2001's rock opus, <i>Insignificance</i>. Along with <i>Eureka</i> and the EP <i>Halfway to a Threeway</i>, that quartet offered listeners easier inroads to O'Rourke, especially relative to his noise or improvised output, the textural radiance of Gastr del Sol or the kitchen-sink compositions of Brise-Glace. But they weren't your average pop records, either: <i>Bad Timing</i> twisted parochial roots music ideas into a gorgeous four-track cycle, while <i>Halfway to a Threeway</i> paired instrumental elegance and emotional ruefulness in four nearly clinical tunes. Throughout, O'Rourke moved just as deliberately as he'd later move on the long-form laptop record, <i>I'm Happy and I'm Singing and a 1, 2, 3, 4</i>, or with drone masters Tony Conrad and Faust on <i>Outside the Dream Syndicate Alive</i>. <i>Bad Timing</i>, for instance, built for nearly 40 minutes before horns and steel guitar ricocheted against each other like pinballs. And on the wry <i>Insignificance</i>, he'd often open a stanza with a happy sentiment just to present the blade beneath the cloth as conclusion. With O'Rourke, patience is more necessity than virtue. On <i>The Visitor</i>, it is an absolute.</p>
<p>Offering a play-by-play guide to <i>The Visitor</i>, an album that O'Rourke says required over 200 separate recorded parts, would be tedious at best, but a few qualities deserve notice: <i>The Visitor</i> feels polite and dainty, perhaps to a fault. Much of its music, all made by O'Rourke alone in Tokyo, isn't unique or overly complicated, in that one could easily find a guitarist, organist, drummer, banjo picker, and guitarist to play the bulk of this album as a band. As with most of O'Rourke's pop output, you could imagine these ideas on any stock singer-songwriter or Sunday afternoon jazz record. In that way, though, <i>The Visitor</i> is a perfect gestalt, where the connections between the elements and their sum are more important than any one instant. O'Rourke links the melodies across instruments, letting a piano mirror a guitar, adjusting one slightly either by changing its meter or letting it slip away from the melody and into the next variation. Such shifts pull the whole into the next phase, maintaining nothing if not constant motion. Rather than sudden payoffs, <i>The Visitor</i> favors careful, minute shifts that amass over its runtime. To that end, there's no big, terminal peak. Sure, the second half springs forward with a bouncy banjo lick, and the drums, pedal steel and piano dance around each other near the track's end. But, true to its name, as soon as <i>The Visitor</i> begins to lean too heavily toward cerebral textures or more visceral moments, it quickly pushes in the other direction. When the action rises, know that there's always something subdued one groove over.</p>
<p>Such a plan works because, from the acoustic guitars that mix O'Rourke's heroes Derek Bailey and John Fahey to the bright electric guitar leads that suggest Electric Light Orchestra or the Doobie Brothers, every moment here is pristinely recorded and carefully mixed. As with Joanna Newsom's <i>Ys</i> and Wilco's <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>, two masterpieces O'Rourke mixed this decade, each layer sits in its perfectly defined space. Each gesture rings clearly. But these parts are written so that they blend across those spaces, in effect creating a collage without seams. We hear every sound, but we never hear them without the benefit of their accompaniment.</p>
<p>Given its patient development and refusal to climax, <i>The Visitor</i> runs the risk of being labeled boring and bland. Given its use of common instruments and techniques (a cymbal scraped with a drumstick constitutes the album's most ""out"" sound), it runs a high risk of being labeled pedestrian, too, as if O'Rourke has taken all of his experimental tendencies and finally reduced them into an adult-contemporary instrumental. Ultimately, that's about as silly as it sounds: <i>The Visitor</i> is a defiant record in both sound and spirit. The reluctance of O'Rourke and Drag City to release <i>The Visitor</i> as a digital download, for instance, rebels against our need for instant gratification. You have to work a bit to hear it. Symbolically, it's a potent act for such an anticipated release, even if bit torrents, RapidShare, and the ilk mean it's little more than a symbol. And O'Rourke's request that you listen out loud, loudly, means that you give it your attention, that you let it fill the room with sound. After all, this is soft music-- and graceful and complicated and rich, too. While it might sound polite, though, it's not to be heard passively during your morning walk to work.</p>
<p>That's because, in the end, <i>The Visitor</i> is a one-man show that refuses to be selfish. It eschews spotlight moments and elides our need to be greedy, to be fed captivation. After a decade of bands exclaiming it all in five minutes (The Arcade Fire, MGMT, this list never stops) and a season of bands getting Internet famous with 40 minutes of output where the tape hiss is to my ears more interesting than the songs (Wavves, Vivian Girls, will this list stop soon?), it's redeeming to hear something deliver such development and depth. These 38 meticulously prepared minutes offer dozens of memorable moments. They just demand that you listen.</p></div>"|13468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13468-the-visitor/|8.3|Grayson Currin

But it is an interesting one, a unique effort by an artist struggling to mesh two disparate musical systems, gambling that inherent internal friction could spark some excitement. Unfortunately, the road to 6.3 is paved with experimental intentions. <i>Kamaal the Abstract</i> first leaked at the beginning of the decade, the follow-up to Tip's solo debut <i>Amplified</i>. While the status of the latter record has only grown in the ensuing years, thanks largely to Dilla's rise as a cult production hero, <i>Kamaal</i>'s nature as an experimental cul-de-sac feels more cemented with time. But the ink never dries in the history books; if anything, the 2000s may have finally given Kamaal and <i>Kamaal</i> an opportunity for creative redemption.</p>
<p>The collision of jazz and hip-hop, of course, isn't a new concept, especially for an artist who worked with Ron Carter on Tribe's second LP. But with Tribe, never mind Digable Planets, Guru, or US3, incorporating jazz often felt like more of a stylistic affect than concrete engagement, just a couple of looped bars and a brief instrumental solo from a big name on a track outro. Since bebop revolutionized jazz in the 1940s, attempts to integrate the genre with pop forms have been risky. Tip's pops used to say hip-hop reminded him of bebop for a reason; at their best, jazz and rap both feature interconnected conversations and content being generated over a short time in their parallel worlds. But rap music's complexity is tied up in language, the melodic and harmonic aspects stripped down so as to focus the listener on the verbal. Post-bebop jazz usually hinges on harmonic complexity.</p>
<p><i>Kamaal the Abstract</i>, to its great credit, is unafraid of (messily) combining these values. Tip seems to have focused primarily on jazz's harmonic intricacies, evident on opener ""Feelin'"" or ""A Million Times"", which are unafraid to eschew pop song structure to get at the meat of what makes post-swing jazz harmonically interesting. But sometimes this nuanced backdrop sounds an off-note for the subject matter; while a bunch of ideas were going on in any Tribe-era Q-Tip verse, Tip's redundant boilerplate womanizing over Steely Dan-style chord changes on ""Heels"" just doesn't fit. Even worse, Tip's singing throughout the record -- a shallow signifier for this more ""soulful"" approach, perhaps? -- feels unnecessarily cautious. Very Andre 3k.</p>
<p>But jazz gets shortchanged, too. For the most part, the solos feel safe and not particularly notable. Guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel's presence followed the release of an exciting, adventurous solo LP <i>The Next Step</i>, so it's confusing to hear his cameo reduced to rhythm guitar on the extended, platitudinous jam ""Do You Dig U?"". Even the incredible Kenny Garrett, who does get an extended solo feature on the stop-start funk “Abstractionisms,” seems to be holding back. It feels like the soloists were so conscious of the album's pop music concessions, they felt they had to dumb it down, afraid to cut loose, as if they were recording for “The Late Show” or a random studio session. Despite Tip's willingness to combine the stylistic approaches of jazz and hip-hop, many songs feel imbalanced this way, with potentially exciting material undercut by underwhelming performances or half-finished ideas. It is worth recognizing that the Miles and Mizells of the world were extraordinarily rare. Few artists could perfectly balance of jazz's intricate complexity as a live performance with lightning-in-a-bottle pop perfection as a piece of recorded art.</p>
<p>Which is why ""Even If It Is So"" is such an accomplishment. With a simple repeated piano vamp over acoustic guitar, the song features the rapper riffing compassionately about single motherhood alongside a memorable horn hook. The music perfectly reflects the song's theme of subdued respect, the incredible beauty of strength in the most harrowing situations. It also leaves you wanting more, the kind of song you'd love to hear extended and embellished, perhaps in a live setting. Which is the key to this record's possibility; each track is a loose framework of unfulfilled promise. There's been a lot of talk about the growing importance of the live show to artists in the RapidShare era. While <i>Kamaal</i> isn't the brave, experimental success it wants to be, it doesn't exactly feel like the cul-de-sac it once did. It suggests a promising future, where the world of live shows offers Q-Tip and these soloists a chance to stretch out, while recalling their roots in entertainment, which isn't so evident here.</p></div>"|13471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13471-kamaal-the-abstract/|6.3|David Drake

At times, I wondered if I overrated it, but these days, I think it might be underrated-- if I told you Animal Collective-inspired music could be used to sell beer, what chance would you give it to turn out as good as the charmingly undecided <i>Visiter?</i></p>
<p>Changes are afoot for this prototypical duo: Yet electric vibraphonist/percussionist Keaton Snyder isn't even the most noticeable addition to the fold on <i>Time to Die-- </i>producer Phil Ek is. and if you're thinking that <i>Time to Die </i>has a suspiciously similar sound to the Shins' <i>Chutes Too Narrow </i>or <i>Fleet Foxes</i>, now you know why. Look, Ek's call is one you gotta take if you're looking to make a leap to a new echelon of indie-fame, and the decisiveness of the album can be admirable when so many other quick turnarounds result in more of the same or guessing against a band's strengths. But while the Shins' James Mercer and Fleet Foxes' Robin Pecknold often use their backing bands as vehicles for vocals, but they don't have the Dodos' rhythmic force and this presentation initially plays like a misallocation of resources. Not that Long is a poor singer, far from it-- his voice remains convincingly boyish, even at its most cynical and he never loses control of his range. But as a wordsmith, he can be distractingly dodgy-- see: the anti-establishment sentiments of ""Two Medicines"" and ""The Strums"", too generic to have real bite despite featuring the record's most intriguing structure and a ingratiating, swooping chorus, respectively.</p>
<p>Opener ""Small Deaths"" begins with Long alone on guitar and vocals, and while that was the dominant sound on <i>Visiter, </i>there's a distinct makeover in presentation: His acoustic is more rounded, almost spongy, his voice coated with a warm, thin glaze of reverb. And then the drums come in-- <i>Visiter </i>crackled with the intensity of two monstrously talented musicians competing for the lead role (acoustic Lightning Bolt too much of a stretch?), but initially, it's ""no, <i>you </i>go first."" Over the wide-open chords at the start of ""The Strums"" you can practically hear a voiceover boasting ""a new romantic comedy from the director who brought you..."" ""This Is a Business"" bears more than a passing similarity to the ramshackle rumble of ""Jodi"", but it doesn't achieve the same frenetic lift-off. I've seen most of <i>Time to Die </i>performed live, and through that, answered the one question you'll probably have: Absolutely, these songs would sound much better if the drums were turned up.</p>
<p>All that said, the Dodos' charms are too strong to be held hostage by a bigger budget, even if you wonder what a guy like Brian Deck could do with it. If ""Small Deaths"" initially comes off as too tastefully restrained, it's only because the Dodos are allowing space between themselves and their most conventionally ""epic"" climax, a steady drum guiding as guitar and vibes steadily pace themselves in adding subtle fuzz tones. Likewise, early leak ""Fables"" may have sounded wanting for energy, but Kroeber shows a knack for a subtly ingratiating swing that emphasizes the Dodos' rhythmic gifts.</p>
<p>As <i>Time to Die </i>progresses, you slowly hear the Dodos growing more comfortable in their tonier territory. ""Troll Nacht"" is quite possibly the most gorgeous Dodos composition to date, an endearing and tender vocal performance by Long fitting its ease-into-Autumn glow, while the title track ends the record on a bobbing, bluesy note recalling their more <i>Zeppelin III</i>-inspired moments while incorporating a newfound look to harmonizing vocal loops.</p>
<p>So you really can't call <i>Time to Die </i>a disappointment, not when it actually improves on <i>Visiter </i>in some ways. It's not the full-out leap into ""pop"" that it would initially seem (for that, you'd need to hear the difference between <i>Visiter </i>and their self-released full-length, from back when they were called Dodo Bird), and for all its charms, <i>Visiter </i>wasn't exactly the tightest hour going.  <i>Time to Die </i>bests it as far as consistency goes-- might not get a ""Fools"" here, but you won't get a ""Park Song"" either. And it's hard to envision <i>Time to Die </i>slowing the momentum of the Dodos' ascendance, not when their live performances are still thrilling as ever, but <i>Time to Die </i>comes off like a temporary decision to forgo made them lovable, flaws and all, and stress what makes them likeable.</p></div>"|13446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13446-time-to-die/|7.1|Ian Cohen

Like Magellan, they discovered a new route to iconic status, but theirs was more circuitous and didn't involve such niceties as sales, audience, tours, or really anything resembling actual success. Instead, they maintained a slow, dim burn throughout the 1970s and 80s, their memory kept alive by critics, collectors, record store clerks, and younger generations of musicians such as R.E.M. and the Replacements. It's easy to read that history in the band name and album titles, which today play like ironic gestures toward out-of-reach celebrity. But Big Star were sincere about being big stars and having #1 records. They didn't set out to be cult: Striving for celebrity and confirmation, they wrote what they thought should be hit records, and they played to please. Their appeal should and could have been broad. By comparison, their loyal audience nearly forty years later is a fluke.</p>
<p>Despite their unprecedented longevity and surprising durability, Big Star have been under-anthologized, with a strange string of lackluster releases. Alex Chilton's pre-band solo debut, <i>1970</i>, took more than 15 years to make its way to record store shelves, and the band's first two albums, <i>#1 Record</i> and <i>Radio City</i>, have been joined at the hip now for decades, starting with the British combo release in 1978 throughout Fantasy/Concord's recent remaster. Big Star's final album, <i>Third/Sisters Lovers</i>, gathered dust for nearly five years before finally getting a small release, and even that tribute album was delayed for nearly a decade. During that time, <i>The Best of Big Star</i> and <i>Big Star Story</i> tried foolishly to whittle the band's short career down to one negligible disc.</p>
<p>Combining studio tracks, live cuts, demos, and unreleased recordings to reveal new sides of the band, Rhino' 4xCD <i>Keep an Eye on the Sky</i> sounds like the one reissue that finally gets Big Star right. It picks up right before the band formed, with solo tracks from both Chris Bell and Chilton as well as songs from previous bands Rock City and Icewater (the Box Tops are missing, and certainly not necessary to the story). Each iteration of the line-up is represented here, although there's nothing from 1993's comeback <i>Columbia: Live at Missouri University</i> or from 2005's already forgotten <i>In Space</i>. This set wisely keeps its eye on the 70s.</p>
<p>These four discs ultimately do what any good box set should do: In tracing the band's trajectory from power-pop progenitors to post-pop tinkerers, <i>Keep an Eye on the Sky</i> presents a history of the band that could not be gleaned from the albums themselves, using finished studio tracks along with demos and rarities to give a fuller picture of the musicians, their dynamic, and their songs. This type of repetition can be fatal in some reissues, either offering distinctions only a true diehard could love or valiantly covering up a deficit of unreleased material. But here, the approach goes a long way toward humanizing a band that has been largely mythologized even into the Internet age. You can listen in on band practice or late-night jam sessions at Ardent, or just wander across happenstance pairings, such as Chilton singing ""Nature Boy"" while William Eggleston-- yes, <i>that</i> William Eggleston-- plays piano. That these new versions of familiar songs feed the cult rather than expunge the mystery is perhaps due to Ardent founder and engineer John Fry, whose studio work brings out the subtle flourishes in these different takes: the handclaps on the sped-up version of ""O My Soul"", the rich strums that underline the chorus of ""The Ballad of El Goodo"", the crisp guitar sound that gives ""You Get What You Deserve"" its bite. He's the fifth Big Star, as crucial to these early recordings as George Martin was to the Beatles or Martin Hannett was to Joy Division. <span> </span></p>
<p>Big Star developed its particular sound in a very short time. The first notes of ""Feel"", the <i>#1 Record</i> opener, still sound like a clarion call, a signal that something exciting is about to go down. They live up to that promise through their first two albums, but on their third, with Bell and bass player Andy Hummel gone, Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens gradually disassemble that power-pop sound, seemingly indulging every oddball impulse: jive-talking through ""You Can't Have Me"" and ""Kizza Me"", adding French-language backing vocals to the Velvet Underground's ""Femme Fatale"", writing a paean to Jesus Christ. <i>Third</i> and its outtakes show Big Star in its death throes, giving up on the idea of power pop to the people and just making strange, sad, beautiful songs for themselves. ""Holocaust"" in particular, especially the haunting piano demo here, is devastating in its damaged beauty.</p>
<p><i>Keep an Eye on the Sky</i> ends with a cuts from three concerts recorded at a small Memphis club in 1973, featuring the original line-up minus Bell. They run through songs from the first two albums, including jammy performances of ""She's a Mover"" and ""Don't Lie to Me"" as well as covers of T. Rex, the Kinks, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Todd Rundgren. It's a strong show, a better glimpse at Big Star the live band than any of their actual live albums, but what stands out is the relative lack of audience response. Big Star were opening for Archie Bell &amp; the Drells, and it's clear that the crowd was already impatient with the first act. As a result, it sounds like Big Star are playing to an empty room, which feels thematically appropriate. People wouldn't start clapping until many years later.</p></div>"|13444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13444-keep-an-eye-on-the-sky/|9.3|Stephen M. Deusner

What better way to emerge into the light than with unapologetically derivative 80s synth-pop that features hysterically expressive vocals and sharp songwriting? Meet La Roux.</p>
<p>In the UK La Roux is already a household name, boasting #1 and #2 singles to go along with a #2 peak placement for the group's eponymous debut album, which finally gets its U.S. release on September 29. A duo consisting of out-of-the-spotlight co-producer Ben Langmaid and very-front-and-center vocalist Elly Jackson (daughter of famed British TV actress Trudie Goodwin), La Roux delivers icy but irresistible throwback pop that hearkens back explicitly to fellow femme-led Brits Yazoo and the Eurhythmics. As far as contemporary comparisons are concerned, La Roux seems almost to have chosen its moniker as a means to ensure their record store placards would be slotted in the same alphabetical neighborhood as most of their RIYLs-- Little Boots, Lady Gaga, and Ladyhawke are all nearby taxonomically and sonically.</p>
<p>The album starts with ""In for the Kill"", which besides inspiring an excellent remix from Skream is also pretty emblematic of the record as a whole, as its key elements-- plinky synths, hollow beats, ecstatic vocals-- pop up again and again, particularly on ""Quicksand"" and ""Fascination"". Jackson's demonstrative vocals are inevitably going to be a sticking point for some people, but unless you want all your ladies to sound like Lykke Li then hopefully you can stomach La Roux's bountiful affect.</p>
<p>The best thing on here by far is ""Bulletproof"", a declaration of emotional steeliness containing an utterly irresistible sing-along chorus, and if you could level an instant criticism at the rest of the album it's that it lacks more truly indelible moments like this one. The flip side of the coin is that there isn't a single duffer on the whole record, as each song offers its own spot of fun even if it fails to deliver a hook that demands to be shouted from rooftops. ""Tigerlily"" features a vaguely creepy, Vincent Price-ish spoken word bit that's just bizarre enough to work, and then seemingly to answer it, ""Reflections are Protection"" whips out a rubbery, creeping synth line that wouldn't have sounded out of place on <i>Thriller</i>. Jackson and Langmaid even showcase a solid knack for balladry, which accounts for most of the admittedly minor emotional resonance of an album that primarily recycles lyrical themes of spurned, illicit and obsessive love. The pulsing synths, clattery beats and vocal histrionics of ""Armour Love"" don't stray terribly far from the group's wheelhouse, but ""Cover My Eyes"" is a real revelation, featuring a chillingly deadened vocal turn from Jackson and a miraculously non-ridiculous assist from the London Community Gospel Choir. It's a promising sign La Roux might actually develop some range as this pilfer-pop duo continues to mature.</p></div>"|13181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13181-la-roux/|7.0|Joshua Love

We'll get more in depth on that shortly, but with the two most important questions surrounding this album finally answered after four years of anticipation, that leaves a third one: why a sequel? The easy conclusion is that Raekwon needed a benchmark-- that he couldn't just put together any slapdash collection of skits and weedcarrier features and b-grade beats, then slap the words <i>Cuban Linx </i>on the cover. So while some people might read this album's title as a gimmicky hook to lure in bring-NYC-back nostalgists, it actually acts more as a reassuring seal of quality from an MC who some people think lost his way the moment he released <i>Immobilarity</i> without a single RZA beat.</p>
<p>The connections to <i>Cuban Linx</i>'s roots of grimy, Mafioso opulence run deep here, starting with a partial reprise of the original album's closer ""North Star (Jewels)"" as <i>Pt. II</i>'s opening track. In 1995, Popa Wu admired the way Raekwon was growing and coming up in the world in the same way a master teacher regards his star pupil; 14 years later he's simultaneously marveling at Raekwon's success and warning him of the treachery that elevated status brings. From there we get not so much a single narrative as a vivid overview of a criminal empire that's grown in scope since the first <i>Cuban Linx</i>. Raekwon's gift for deep focus-- homing in on an adversary's apparel one moment, zooming out to take in an entire hood's social system the next-- is at its sharpest, and in running the gamut of criminology rap from kitchen stove to prison yard, he reinforces his reputation as a lyricist with a supreme ability to simultaneously set an evocative scene and turn a slick phrase.</p>
<p>Two early detail-oriented highlights come back-to-back: ""Sonny's Missing"", a compact, Pete Rock-produced narrative concerning the grotesque interrogation of a rival segues into the strangely calm crack-cooking setpiece ""Pyrex Vision"", where Rae simmers his voice down to a murmur and gives a tactile snapshot of the crack-cooking process. That mixture of tightly knit procedural storytelling and lyrical virtuosity carries through on the other solo showpieces, the business plan/inventory rundown ""Surgical Gloves"" and the confrontation with a kiss-blowing, shit-talking Jamaican dealer in ""Fat Lady Sings"" chief amongst them.</p>
<p>But it's the guest spots that make the album widescreen, particularly with the involvement of every remaining Wu-Tang member (except for U-God, possibly as a canonical continuation of his being ""killed off"" on the first <i>Cuban Linx</i>). Inspectah Deck, Masta Killa, and GZA bolster the narrative, Method Man provides a couple respites from the criminal theme with some flat-out vintage lyrical boasting on early-leak highlights ""New Wu"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"", and the the RZA has a memorably unhinged cameo at the end of ""Black Mozart"". Even ODB's there in spirit, with the Dilla-utilizing ""Ason Jones"" cutting through all the mythologized goofball eccentricity to depict him as a wise man with real love in his heart. All that, and you get Jadakiss and Styles P waxing grimy on ""Broken Safety"", Beanie Sigel at his remorseful best on ""Have Mercy"", Slick Rick pulling diabolical Queen-mocking hook duty on ""We Will Rob You"", and Busta Rhymes dialing down his characteristic bellow to growl on ""About Me"".</p>
<p>And then there's Ghost. Maybe the biggest strength of the original <i>Cuban Linx </i>was how well Ghostface and Raekwon complemented each other, with Tony Starks' rampaging wail underscoring Chef's calculating intensity, and Ghost's appearances here hold that same power. He opens his verse on ""Cold Outside"" with one of his most evocatively disturbing lines ever-- ""They found a two-year-old strangled to death/ With a 'Love Daddy' shirt on/ In a bag on the top of the steps""-- and expands that into a ball-of-confusion breakdown of friends' betrayals, AIDS mothers, ""swastikas on the church,"" being broke during Christmas, and the need for troop withdrawal from Iraq. Later on, he has a sharp back-and-forth dialogue-style prison-hustle account with Rae in ""Penitentiary"", castigates a street soldier after being caught getting a blowjob from the man's girlfriend in ""Gihad"", and has a classic outrageous-swagger line in ""10 Bricks"": ""the currency rushes like poppin' a wheelie/ Holdin' a bike with one hand, the other countin' the billies"". Listening to him going R&amp;B on <i>Wizard of Poetry</i>'s gonna be weird after this.</p>
<p>That said, there's one crucial difference between the two <i>Cuban Linx </i>records that could've tripped this album up: The switch from an all-RZA palette of beats to an all-star roster of production names. RZA does contribute three of the best tracks-- the fuzzed-out cinema funk of ""Black Mozart"", the choral headknock sway of ""New Wu"", and the lavish, orchestral mid-70s soul of ""Fat Lady Sings""-- which fall between his classic first-wave style and a less out-there strain of the experimentation that alienated Ghost and Raekwon circa <i>8 Diagrams</i>. But aside from Dr. Dre getting a bit too polished and joylessly glossy on the faux-Latin cheese of ""Catalina"" and the plodding ""About Me"", the rest of the production proves to be an eclectic yet fitting take on the classic Wu-Tang aesthetic. ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Ason Jones"", and ""10 Bricks"" benefit from a trip to the Dilla vaults that brought back three of his most RZA-esque beats. The Alchemist's chopped-up chimes and woozy guitars give ""Surgical Gloves"" a hypnotic edge. Pete Rock maintains the integrity of his style with the flute and horn-driven bounce on ""Sonny's Missing"" (repurposed from <i>NY's Finest</i> track ""Questions"" and an even better fit here). And Marley Marl gets a lot of atmospheric mileage out of the subdued yet gripping guitar loop that comprises the 55 seconds of ""Pyrex Vision"".</p>
<p>Between the hype, the anticipation and the attachment of a legendary album's legacy, anything less than a classic would have proven to be a major disappointment. Few albums have gone through this much turmoil and delay in the planning stages yet turned out so cohesive and tight. The last time a Wu-Tang record came together with this kind of personnel and succeeded under a grand conceptual vision, we got <i>Fishscale</i>, and calling <i>Cuban Linx II </i>Raekwon's equivalent to it isn't out of the question. Like Ghostface's modern classic, this album defies hip-hop's current atmosphere of youthful cockiness and aging complacency: instead, it's driven by the sometimes celebratory, sometimes traumatized sense of stubborn survival and perseverance, a veteran mindset that can no longer picture success without having to defend it. Consider this a triumphant defense.</p></div>"|13441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13441-only-built-4-cuban-linx-pt-ii/|8.8|Nate Patrin

<p class=""MsoNormal"">But perhaps the most audacious claim made by <i>A Brief History of Love </i>is that Oasis' <i>Be Here Now </i>might've been onto something had its creators not been loaded on cocaine during its recording process (to this day, it's still one of the worst sound engineering jobs you'll hear on a major-label album).<span> </span>This is generally not a popular stance, since history has viewed it as the big loser in Britpop's dinosaur-meet-asteroid summer 1997.<span> </span>But not everyone was interested in following <i>OK Computer</i>'s example of using electronic music for texture so much as another avenue towards anthems, and tracks such as ""Bittersweet Symphony"", ""Pure Morning"", ""All You Good Good People"", and, yes, ""D'You Know What I Mean"" proved a natural fit between massive, if rudimentary hip-hop beats and what might otherwise be flag-waving, stadium-filling radio smashes.<span> </span>And so then, the lineage continues with the Big Pink's mighty ""Dominos""-- it's such an undeniable, simple hook, and such an undeniably locomotive but lumbering beat that it steamrolls any doubt you have about the rest of it being underwritten or misogynistic.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But more promising is how in spite of the IMAX-ready sonic presence of previously released singles like ""Dominos"" and ""Crystal Visions"", <i>History </i>rarely feels something other than hand-crafted.<span> </span>Furze and Cordell produced the album themselves, with engineering done by Rich Costey who, judging from the latest Mew and Glasvegas records, knows his way around huge.<span> </span><i>A Brief History </i>stills sounds surprisingly nuanced in headphones-- you can enjoy how the group fits an entire album's worth of power chords into a swath of synthesizers that honor their 4AD legacy on ""Dominos"", but from the anticipatory shaker that leads into the hook or the feedback-scratched bridge, repeat listens are rewarded long after they've been demanded. ""Too Young to Love"" hurtles by on momentum more than melody, its raga drone breaking up into shards of scree like a comet through the atmosphere.<span> </span>But almost as hypnotic is the passionate vocal performance on ""Velvet"", which reveals a similar endlessly upward arc to ""Fake Plastic Trees"", right down to the distorted blow-out midway through.<span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Though <i>History</i> never fails to sound elegantly wasted at any tempo, its majority goes in buffet-style on the last two decades of UK's beat-minded rock, united by Furze's Jason Pierce-ing sneer. ""At War With the Sun"" nicks <i>Stone Roses' </i>jangle with nastier distortion pedals, while ""Frisk"" is halfway between Damon Albarn's early forays into funk and the more silken prog of Mansun's <i>Attack of the Grey Lantern</i>.<span> </span>Two years ago, you might've caught Cordell releasing early singles from Crystal Castles and Klaxons on his Merok label, so it's not a surprise that learning on the job resulted in nu-rave wondering how it missed out on shrieking dumb fun like ""Golden Pendulum"" and ""Tonight"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Despite all the cavalcade of classics that <i>A Brief History of Love</i> conjures, my favorite comparison for these guys is actually another youthful, romantically minded British act: The xx.<span> </span>By ""comparison,"" I don't mean ""sounds like""--  the two bands seem like they're operating while diametrically opposed.<span> </span>Some might find the Big Pink churlish or even anti-romantic (though I'd argue they hardly spend enough time <i>acknowledging </i>women enough to really comment on them) compared to the restrained and unusually mature xx, who hew more comfortable notions of gender relations.<span> </span>""Love in Vain"" tries a little tenderness, but ""if you really love him, tell me that you love him again,"" hints at vulnerability before ""then go"" turns the sentiment as cavernous as the reverb surrounding it.<span> </span>But while sometimes you fall for the art of seduction, there's the part of us that want to be overwhelmed-- <i>A Brief History of Love </i>is a study in the enormity of sound doing just that, each reverbed kick drum, phasers-on-stun guitar, and wastrel vocal refuting the idea that you need to talk about the passion to express it.<span> </span></p>

Yeah, yeah: That's one of those classic contentious record review openers. Open to debate, easy enough to pick apart. I'm sure I could name 10 albums that rival <i>So Tough</i> on that front myself. But when <i>So Tough</i> is actually playing, I'm not sure I can think of any other record I so hope to one day find myself walking around inside of: It's like a bright, hazy early morning captured on disc, those hours where the day is still all potential.</p>
<p>In the two years between Saint Etienne's debut, 1991's <i>Foxbase Alpha</i>, and follow-up <i>So Tough</i>, Pete Wiggs, Bob Stanley, and Sarah Cracknell grew confident enough to chase that early morning vibe for a whole LP rather than craft Obvious Chart Hits to cement their status as burgeoning UK pop fixtures. Even the album's catchiest moments -- ""Mario's Cafe"", ""You're in a Bad Way"", ""Avenue"" -- are like sketches snatched from a personal demo reel compared to some of the glitzy indie-bubblegum and D.I.Y. disco on this reissue's second disc of extras and B-sides (cf. ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" and ""Join Our Club"").</p>
<p><i>So Tough</i> is that common paradox of the sampling era: carefully constructed to feel completely casual. Even the sampled movie and TV dialogue sounds more like field-recorded day-in-the-life pub chatter. And Wiggs and Stanley's heavy-duty studio effects soften every instrument. The crispness of the percussion is eroded with reggae-tinted reverb on ""You're in a Bad Way""; ""No Rainbows For Me"" is a slo-mo girl group shuffle drowned in dream-pop noise. A mock-menacing beat familiar to fans of the Beastie Boys (or the Incredible Bongo Band) can be muted into ""Calico"", as agreeably sleepy as kinda-sorta hip-hop ever got.</p>
<p><i>So Tough</i> is a young person's record, in that it suggests there's everywhere left to go in life while seeming in no great hurry to get anywhere in particular. It was made by a trio who'd recently happened upon a singular atmosphere, and then had no problem just soaking the listener in it. The title of the first bonus tune on disc two, ""Everything Flows"", was of course named by Teenagle Fanclub (it's a cover of their debut single), but it summarizes the feel <i>So Tough</i> well enough. But so does its sound: Unutterably gorgeous pop-house with the off-the-cuff quality of both indie and ambient, without ever committing to any on genre. There's still no better soundtrack to whiling away your life in a café.</p>
<p>Recorded seven years later, <i>Sound of Water</i> is similarly low-key, but with the unmistakable feel of adulthood, the accumulated responsibilities and disappointments. Out goes the unexamined, endearing optimism. Wistfulness has crept in, both lyrically and sonically. It's probably no coincidence that the first single was called ""How We Used to Live"", a multi-part minor masterpiece that came off like someone watching the young lovers of <i>So Tough</i> drift apart in memory. On <i>Sound of Water</i>, Saint Etienne's earlier records now seem to represent a world that can be observed, or fondly/painfully remembered, but no longer entered into. And musically, it seems that for the band growing up means smartening up. The swooning ambience of the band's first few records has likewise been buffed away, revealing sleeker, sharper-edged techno-pop. The album is more traditionally stylish, but tinged with an ill-defined sadness. Even the title suggests something beautiful but chilly, and in this case maybe a little too pristine.</p>
<p>That's not to say <i>Sound of Water</i> is a bad album, just harder to immediately fall in love with than the cuddly <i>So Tough</i>. The turn of the millennium was a time for many indie-identified Brit bands to suddenly start making their records very slick and traditionally well-made in a very specific ""electronica era"" sort of way. Sometimes, thematically, it worked, as with the aforementioned ""How We Used to Live"". But often, as with the antiseptic digital (or digital-sounding) arrangement of ""Roseneck"", you have to listen <i>past</i> the band's restraint to hear the emotion under the beautiful-but-sterile computer-assisted minimalism.</p>
<p>The second disc of era-specific B-sides and bonus tracks is obvious a grab-bag of highs and lows, quality-wise. But the schizo mood-hopping actually helps to undo some of the parent album's stiffness, despite the songs being made with the same materials. You may still not be ready to enjoy the vibraphone again, but it's undeniable that, on the evidence of ""52 Pilot"", Saint Etienne deployed that overused emblem of late-90s high-seriousness more playfully than Stereolab or Tortoise ever managed. Especially since it's bracketed by the icy miniature ""Ivyhouse"" and the more-or-less straightforward club cut ""We're in the City"".</p>
<p>Future records would handle Saint Etienne's late-career embrace of age and wisdom and skill with more warmth and less compositional control-freakitude. It probably didn't hurt that they turned back to the organic oddness of rural and urban England as a source of inspiration, rather than continuing to pine for the mock-futuristic placelessness of turn-of-the-millennium continental European laptop gurus. If <i>Sound of Water</i> isn't a Saint Etienne classic, it's not for lack of craft or even inspiration. It's because it's often hard to feel at home in a world where the artists themselves are visitors.</p></div>"|13462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13462-so-tough-sound-of-water/|8.9|Jess Harvell

<p>The second disc of era-specific B-sides and bonus tracks is obvious a grab-bag of highs and lows, quality-wise. But the schizo mood-hopping actually helps to undo some of the parent album's stiffness, despite the songs being made with the same materials. You may still not be ready to enjoy the vibraphone again, but it's undeniable that, on the evidence of ""52 Pilot"", Saint Etienne deployed that overused emblem of late-90s high-seriousness more playfully than Stereolab or Tortoise ever managed. Especially since it's bracketed by the icy miniature ""Ivyhouse"" and the more-or-less straightforward club cut ""We're in the City"".</p>
<p>Future records would handle Saint Etienne's late-career embrace of age and wisdom and skill with more warmth and less compositional control-freakitude. It probably didn't hurt that they turned back to the organic oddness of rural and urban England as a source of inspiration, rather than continuing to pine for the mock-futuristic placelessness of turn-of-the-millennium continental European laptop gurus. If <i>Sound of Water</i> isn't a Saint Etienne classic, it's not for lack of craft or even inspiration. It's because it's often hard to feel at home in a world where the artists themselves are visitors.</p></div>"|13462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13462-so-tough-sound-of-water/|7.0|Jess Harvell

(As Douglas Wolk put it in his Pitchfork review, ""the forgotten secret of Woodstock is that it kinda sucked."") Personally, I don't see any sign of abatement on that front, since around the same time, Tanya Morgan's new album taught me that misconstrued nostalgia is pretty much part and parcel of any span of time where great music and worthy ideals intersect: damn if the praise of <i>Brooklynati </i>has me wondering if I've got a faulty memory too.</p>
<p>This indie hip-hop group has been lauded as a flamekeeper for a certain time in the early 1990s when the Native Tongues held down New York with a sound that was less overtly Afrocentric but more commercially successful. But didn't Q-Tip appear on a Mobb Deep track? Didn't Phife Dawg threaten to ejaculate on someone in at least two of Tribe's most beloved singles? Wasn't <i>De La Soul Is</i> <i>Dead</i> a pitch-black rejection of the hip-hop hippie aesthetic foisted upon them by rock fans and critics? Couldn't Busta Rhymes and Redman, even at their most rah-rah, come and go as they please? Well, you all know that's true, but <i>Brooklynati </i>instead coasts by on a revisionist historical perspective where Tribe, De La et. al were at the forefront fighting gangsta rap not with innovation or originality, but with common decency.</p>
<p>It's a shame too-- I can't remember the last time a record this innocuous and well-meaning irked me so much. Well, maybe I can-- it was either eMC's <i>The Show </i>or the self-titled Slaughterhouse album from earlier this year, both motley supergroups of talented but commercially waning MCs who do a nice rendering of the kind of mid-90s NYC records that they don't have to compete against any more. Fortunately, Tanya Morgan (a partnership of Cincy's Ilyas and Donwill and Brooklyn rapper/producer Von Pea, formed on the Okayplayer message board) brings out the best in each MC-- ""Bang &amp; Boogie"" is an unrelentingly good-natured ode to promiscuity, and I suppose the major difference separating them from their easiest comparisons is that Tanya Morgan has a discernable<i> </i>sense of humor.</p>
<p>As such, it's difficult to imagine the good vibes here fucking up any barbecue. But scattin' off soft-ass beats, Tanya Morgan raps happily-- tragically, that style deteriorates rapidly over the span of an hour of Von Pea and Brickbeats' loungy neo-soul. The three have a good rapport with each other, mostly spitting the kind of craft-minded raps (""I wanna be self assured... I did the right thing, following my dream and tightening my writing"") that are considered intelligent because they're not overtly stupid. But too often, these three like-voiced rappers are too genial to step on each other's toes every once in a while or even play too much off each other-- even the most telepathic partnerships in hip-hop need someone to take the lead every now and again, and only guest spots from Blu and Phonte rank as standouts.</p>
<p>As with <i>The Show</i>, <i>Brooklynati </i>is most affecting when it finds some sort of purpose in the mundane workings of minor hip-hop celebrity. ""Don't U Holla"" all but begs to be called ""Rap Promoter 2009"", and ""Plan B"" is like some sort of tragic alternate ending to Kanye West's ""Spaceship"". And while there's thankfully little in the way of grumpy complaint rap, after gaining a bit of momentum, <i>Brooklynati </i>throws ""She's Gone (aka Without You)"" at us, assuming what the rap game really needs in 2009 is yet another ""I Used To Love H.E.R."" It just further to illustrate the philosophical dead end <i>Brooklynati </i>seems more than content to head towards: The album spends nearly its entirety trying to revive a sound prevalent in 1994, the same year when Common dropped the original, and the same year where hip-hop was so shamefully out of touch with its artistic roots that it only managed to produce <i>Ready to Die, Illmatic, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Tical, Hard to Earn, Dare Iz a Darkside</i>...</p>
<p>So it's only fair that if Tanya Morgan is willing to use the clichéd, borderline misogynist personification of hip-hop as an easily cowed woman with a good heart who can't keep her legs closed, <i>Brooklynati </i>embodies the overused romantic foil: It's hardworking, reliable, sincere, kind-hearted and wouldn't do anything to hurt her. It's the sort you're supposed to settle with after spending one's youth going through exciting yet ultimately ""unrewarding"" flings. But hell, you've seen those divorce rates.</p></div>"|13456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13456-brooklynati/|5.8|Ian Cohen

But then came Mika Vainio's <i>Black Telephone of Matter</i>. Kreng sounds positively sweet by comparison. Vainio's tailored noise is deeply fissured, unforgivingly ambiguous, and almost entirely devoid of the kind of cues that help us read sound as music. He doesn't mix in any creepy strings or detuned pianos to humanize his compositions, and he locates more feeling in near-silence than high volume, which makes him distinct from harsh-noise mavens. Only a few sounds on the album-- some mangled bird calls, a scattering of cymbals, hints of deconstructed death-metal on ""Swedenborgia""-- are mimetic. All else is seething, oozing electricity. It's a pitch-black world where blown-out machines mutter to each other.</p>
<p>As a member of Pan Sonic, a Finnish group that mines a ragged seam between minimal techno, industrial, and power electronics, Vainio (now based in Berlin) is no stranger to dire, confrontational music. Pan Sonic is known for blurring the line between the sonic and the physical. In 1995, they performed in a car park in London with a sound system rigged up on an armored car (designed by the KLF's Jimmy Cauty), similar to what riot squads use, in pursuit of the infamous brown note. One pre-Pan Sonic performance by Vainio found him locked in a room for ten hours with a low-frequency drone at 125 decibels. He's a process-guy with a bottomless fascination for how sound interacts with the whole body, not just the ears and mind.</p>
<p>Even in Vainio's various solo work (as Ø, Philus, and under his own name), there's usually at least the intimation of a beat, but <i>Black Telephone of Matter</i> is guided solely by extremes of frequency, volume, and stereo space. ""Roma A.D. 2727"" scans like a poltergeist radio, shuffling through piercingly textured machine noises that divulge moments of overwhelming force (spoiler alert: wait for what sounds like an infernal pipe organ). ""Bury a Horse's Head"" features pockets of laughter amongst its drones. The ghosting tones of ""In a Frosted Lake"" establish a subtle cadence with rate-of-decay parameters. The impossible shapes start and stop abruptly, yet their progression never feels desultory: Moving from one gripping  passage to another by way of tapered segues or violent ruptures, every new development opens out inevitably, as in a really vivid nightmare.</p>
<p>It's hard to keep a grip on everyday rationality when the record is playing, as it's overwritten by Vainio's implacable script. This uncompromising dictation of reality is, of course, physical as well as emotional. Plenty of records favor headphones, but here, they're simply mandatory, unless you happen to have a very quiet room with a very good sound system. On ""Silencés Traverses Des Mondes Et Des Anges"", for instance, an important connective passage of juddering quietude simply vanishes without headphones. And it requires you to constantly adjust the volume, which you'll have jacked up during the quiet parts, unless you don't mind subjecting your ears to deliberately inhospitable frequencies as high volumes. ""A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 ML/S"" creates an uncanny effect by paring a tone so high you feel it more than hear it, as a sort of high-altitude pressure in the ear drums, with a soothing rumble that seems disproportionate to its anxious result. It's not too much to call <i>Black Telephone of Matter</i> a sadomasochistic record: In consenting to be mastered, we tap into a dreadful vitality.</p></div>"|13458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13458-black-telephone-of-matter/|7.6|Brian Howe

George Harrison, however? Hard to imagine he'd be anybody's first pick. He probably wasn't James', either, but in the days following Harrison's late 2001 death, James, his guitar, a reel-to-reel, and precious little else got together to pay, well, <i>Tribute To</i> the quiet Beatle. It's a deeply passionate project, it would have you believe, and it's that passion that gets <i>Tribute To</i> past some of its sonic sameyness and slight sluggishness. But there's just no getting around the fact that these are inferior versions of, to be fair, brilliant recordings-- an inescapable fact James treats with delicacy.</p>
<p>You cover the Beatles, and you're just asking for it; that combination of familiarity and fondness on the listener's part simply does not exist in the same way for any other band, and no matter what the song, your take immediately becomes one of hundreds. James smartly opts to work around the more obvious choices in the Harrison catalog; there's ""My Sweet Lord"", yeah, but there's no ""Here Comes the Sun"", ""While My Guitar Gently Sleeps"", or, mercifully, ""Got My Mind Set on You"". James doesn't exactly go way out-- there's nothing past 1970, despite Harrison's fair-to-good track record through the rest of that decade-- but does favor album cuts with plenty of room for his searching, occasionally soaring voice: <i>Revolver</i>'s sitar-soaked ""Love You To"", woozy White Album winder ""Long Long Long"", and several more from Harrison's solo opus <i>All Things Must Pass</i>. Though Harrison's tunes-- particularly the ones post-<i>Rubber Soul</i>, as he shook off the twang-rock that characterized his earlier compositions-- are possessed with a wistful, longing quality, there's little thread holding the half-dozen tunes here together beyond their creator and an avoidance of anything above the mid-tempo. That puts the burden of cohesion on James.</p>
<p>Comprised of little more than acoustic guitar and the swell of James' high, lonesome voice, <i>Tribute To</i> starts off plenty inviting, with a lovely cover of the loping ""Long, Long, Long"". The slight psychedelic gurgles in the original track are traded in for room sound and falsetto, and James does indeed sound more wounded on the track than we're used to after the ebullient one-two of <i>Z</i> and <i>Evil Urges</i>. But then it's ""Behind That Locked Door""-- itself a tribute to one Bob Dylan-- dressed up in much the same way, but devoid of the original's atmosphere of uplift and Harrison's tender (read: human) vocal. James has always seemed a very technical singer to me; he hits every beat, holds every note just so, and as often as the sound of his voice gets talked about, his expressiveness as a singer doesn't always match up, something <i>Tribute To</i> bears out. Not only does he sing these Harrison songs just like Jim James, but if you've spent any amount of time around either, what you're currently hearing in your head couldn't be closer to the truth.</p>
<p><i>Tribute To</i> is buoyed by ""Love You To"", which switches out sitar for banjo and stoned supplication for a slowly-building swoon, and a damn gorgeous strum through ""My Sweet Lord"", both of which find ways around their original counterparts' famed arrangements. But it closes out with a straightahead take on ""Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp""-- fine, but seemingly an excuse to let James get his voice around the ""let it roll"" exhortations that close it out-- and <i>All Things Must Pass</i>' title track, which James slows to the point of sluggishness by minute three. The ever-languid pace and James' familiar insistence on reverb-- which hangs heavy over nearly everything here-- weighs down <i>Tribute To</i> to the point where its 25 minutes feel far longer.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, most My Morning Jacket fans will eat this up; James' voice is in top form, and after <i>Evil Urges</i>, this is certainly soothing. And it's tough to imagine any Beatlemaniac balking much, either; James avoids imitation, never devolves into parody, and shows a clear love of Harrison's work. Given the quick and dirty circumstances in which it was recorded and the somber mood over the proceedings, it'd help if <i>Tribute To</i> felt a little more, well, imbued with feeling; when you know James sings every song in essentially this manner, it loses a bit of its mournful luster. It's not that <i>Tribute To</i> isn't on some level deeply felt, but it's just not deeply considered, and while it's nice to hear James focused and playing to his strengths after the scattered <i>Evil Urges</i>, his tribute eventually loses the one thread it sets out to carry on its cover. These may be Harrison's songs, but here, the quiet Beatle gets crowded out by James and all his reverb.</p></div>"|13454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13454-tribute-to/|6.2|Paul Thompson

Not that long ago, message boarders could diss and dismiss boring new bands (insert your least favorite post-punk revivalists here) for sounding like ""a copy of a copy of a copy."" Fast forward just a few years, and that's exactly what some of the most exciting new bands sound like.</p>
<p>Pastiche and intertextuality are as ancient as postmodernism-- not to mention disco, hip-hop, and the remix-- but childhood memories, in particular, are present now like never before. Today's blockbuster movies are based on yesterday's beloved toys; today's wars and political battles are sequels, too. It isn't surprising that music would reflect the zeitgeist. What's striking is how an international cohort of rising artists has successfully translated this culture of watery VCR transfers and Fisher-Price cassette rips into 1980s-inspired psychedelic music.</p>
<p>Names like Ducktails, Reading Rainbow, VEGA, Pocahaunted, and, especially, Memory Tapes tell you a lot about where these disparate reminiscers are coming from. Arguably, more than genre tags like ""glo-fi"" or <i>The Wire</i> critic David Keenan's ""hypnagogic pop,"" but those labels can be useful, too. Washed Out, the solo project of Georgia (via South Carolina) multi-instrumentalist Ernest Greene, fits in almost too well with the balmy lo-fi synth atmospherics of peers like Neon Indian, Toro Y Moi, Small Black, the higher-fi jj, or the darker, heavier SALEM, as well as the more guitar-based Real Estate, Best Coast, and Pearl Harbour. Washed Out's debut <i>Life of Leisure </i>EP, out digitally now and on 12"" early next month (another release, the cassette-only <i>High Times</i>, arrived September 15), isn't at the top of its class, but Greene so far is one of this fledgling aesthetic's most gifted students.</p>
<p>Focusing on romantic nostalgia and homespun textures, <i>Life of Leisure</i> does with 80s soft rock and synth-pop what Glass Candy and Chromatics did with Italo disco a couple of years ago, only Washed Out evokes summer afternoons indoors rather than the Italians Do It Better crew's early-a.m. urban stalking. Out-of-sync PBS-theme synths and videogame lasers meet funky horn breaks on opener ""Get Up"", as Greene's slurry vocals suggest deep pain. A sampled sax sighs mournfully behind a chopped-up voice, Cut Copy-pasteable beats, and some more indistinct singing on ""Lately"".<i> Life of Leisure</i>'s six tracks, whether poppier and more approachable like ""New Theory"", or moody and alarming like ""Hold Out"", tend to cut off suddenly, which gives the EP an appealing, unfinished quality. Like hearing a work in progress: Greene has only been making music under his current moniker for a couple of months, so don't come flaming me if his live shows suck or his Dave Fridmann-produced sophomore album flops in 2013.</p>
<p>More than some contemporaries, though, Washed Out submerges a sense of intense feeling within its 80s-fantasy electronic ether. Greene's ""copy of a copy"" distance, then, comes across as a form of emotional repression. The yearning-in-utero effect is strongest on woozy centerpiece ""Feel It All Around"". With blurry singing, cheap-sounding synths, and a humid, syrupy flow, the track suggests an 80s synth pop hit that won't come straight out and cop to itself-- or a young man in love, too tongue-tied (or too stoned?) to admit it. ""You feel it all around yourself,"" Greene echoes. As for what ""it"" is, the song never says.</p>
<p>If this review itself reads like a ""memory of a memory"" (to sample another phrase from Keenan), blame ""Feel It All Around"". Days after the filing of a final draft packed with trenchant insights drawn from the similarities between the track's choral drone and 10cc's 1975 hit ""I'm Not in Love"", it came to light that Washed Out's signature tune is actually based around a loop from Gary Low's 1983 single ""I Want You"". The words you're reading changed; the rating didn't. ""You're soooooo... fine,"" it sounds like Greene's finally able to bring himself to say on finale ""You'll See It"", one of the EP's loveliest and most tuneful tracks; ""Don't you fight it."" OK, I have to go fast-forward through NutraSweet and Sylvania commercials to watch the TV movie of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> with Ringo Starr as the Mock Turtle now.</p></div>"|13438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13438-life-of-leisure-ep/|8.0|Marc Hogan

The town has been hit by wave after wave of economic disaster, and when you drive through it today, it looks like a ruin. Here's how Gary rapper Freddie Gibbs describes the city on his song ""From the G"": ""Land of lost hope/ Clouds of mill smoke/ Community devoured by hard and soft dope.""</p>
<p>If beaten-down regional defiance is one of rap's great animating forces, Gary is a great place to be from. On <i>The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs</i>, the first of two very good mixtapes that Gibbs dropped this summer, he complains about not even being able to get on local Chicago radio. Sportswriters call that the ""nobody believed in us"" factor; when the world has written you off, you're that much more determined.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Gibbs was signed to Interscope. He's not anymore, but he recorded a pretty hefty chunk of songs with the label. It's not too often that someone can arrive on the mixtape scene rapping over brand-new beats from expensive producers like Just Blaze or Polow da Don, but that's what's happening here. Gibbs has a hell of an ear for beats, and for a while he had access to some of the best producers working. The tracks he recorded in his time at Interscope are all over <i>Miseducation</i> and the even better <i>Midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik</i>. And the tracks from unheard producers hold up. Sometimes they do more than hold up; ""Murder on My Mind"" is a bass-heavy seasick lurch, one of the heaviest rap tracks of the year.</p>
<p>More than most actual rap albums coming out these days, these two mixtapes have an actual identifiable sound, a varied but cohesive midtempo thump. Gibbs doesn't rap over other people's songs too often, and when he does, they're impeccably selected slices of vintage rap: ""93 Til Infinity"", say, or Goodie Mob's ""Black Ice"". Aesthetically, then, both tapes are as solid as you could possibly hope: Hard, cohesive long-players with hints of the familiar but not enough to make it sound like cliche. They're really albums more than mixtapes, and they're exceptionally well put-together albums at that.</p>
<p>But all of this is secondary to Gibbs himself, who emerges as a very serious voice. Gibbs doesn't do anything on either tape to innovate formally. He doesn't resort to gimmickry or showy cleverness. He does one thing-- hard, unpretentious gangsta rap-- and he does it very, very well. Gibbs' voice is a strained, husky growl, one that occupies some of the same tough, honest ground as Z-Ro, say, or Young Buck. He switches in and out of double-time speed-rap almost effortlessly, sounding like he's fully internalized the tricky rhyme-schemes of Midwestern forebears like Twista and Bone Thugs. He sings some of his own choruses in a deep, drawly singsong-- maybe not technically the greatest voice, but one better suited for conveying emotion than at least half the mercenary R&amp;B hook-singers out there.</p>
<p>And Jesus Christ he can rap. To really enjoy Gibbs, you have to be OK with the idea of rap songs that graphically chronicle the act of pimping women, in great detail-- including but not limited to what job your girl tells her mother she's working. This is rough, fiery stuff, but it's not entirely amoral. When Gibbs talks about the devastation of his hometown, he sounds seriously pained-- just like he does when he talks about sleeping in a sock drawer instead of a crib as a baby. Gibbs' threats resonate: ""I got a itchy trigger finger and the nuts of a elephant/ Knock the stuffing out your fuckin' muffin just for the hell of it."" But so does his real talk: ""This ain't how I wanna live/ I dream about having kids / But I'm afraid that as they grow they won't see they daddy live."" On ""World So Cold"", <i>Miseducation</i>'s closer, he raps about the son he almost had, keeping the fact that the kid was stillborn as a devastating surprise ending. He's a ferocious rapper who can break your heart when you're not expecting it. He's the real thing.</p>
<p>Rappers like Gibbs, messy street-rap classicists without crossover-pop instincts or easy marketing hooks, don't get to make albums for labels anymore. So Gibbs has made his own albums-- two within a few months of each other-- and put them out himself. With a little bit of Googling, you can download both for free. For every out-of-touch gazillion rapper putting out a slab of sadness to a massive PR rollout, there's someone like Gibbs, cranking out great music without knowing whether the world will take notice. Guys like Freddie Gibbs are saving rap.</p></div>"|13466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13466-the-miseducation-of-freddie-gibbs-midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik/|7.8|Tom Breihan

When Gibbs talks about the devastation of his hometown, he sounds seriously pained-- just like he does when he talks about sleeping in a sock drawer instead of a crib as a baby. Gibbs' threats resonate: ""I got a itchy trigger finger and the nuts of a elephant/ Knock the stuffing out your fuckin' muffin just for the hell of it."" But so does his real talk: ""This ain't how I wanna live/ I dream about having kids / But I'm afraid that as they grow they won't see they daddy live."" On ""World So Cold"", <i>Miseducation</i>'s closer, he raps about the son he almost had, keeping the fact that the kid was stillborn as a devastating surprise ending. He's a ferocious rapper who can break your heart when you're not expecting it. He's the real thing.</p>
<p>Rappers like Gibbs, messy street-rap classicists without crossover-pop instincts or easy marketing hooks, don't get to make albums for labels anymore. So Gibbs has made his own albums-- two within a few months of each other-- and put them out himself. With a little bit of Googling, you can download both for free. For every out-of-touch gazillion rapper putting out a slab of sadness to a massive PR rollout, there's someone like Gibbs, cranking out great music without knowing whether the world will take notice. Guys like Freddie Gibbs are saving rap.</p></div>"|13466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13466-the-miseducation-of-freddie-gibbs-midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik/|8.3|Tom Breihan

Sure, they made <i>Jerusalem</i>, a stoner metal masterpiece that was basically an hour of Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" riff. But the record was a logical limit-- how much more droning and Sabbath-esque could a band get? When the band split up in the late 1990s, it birthed two behemoths: Guitarist Matt Pike formed High on Fire, while bassist Al Cisneros and drummer Chris Hakius formed Om. High on Fire's mixture of Motörhead and Black Sabbath has found considerable success, and Om's drums-bass-vocals shtick has also garnered a large following. The two bands are as if Sleep separated into its constituent elements: High on Fire continue (and accelerate) Sleep's midrange roar, while Om explore Sleep's mantra-like low end.</p>
<p>Since Om are a duo, Hakius' departure last year caused a stir. His metronomic, cymbal-heavy style was literally half of Om's sound. Many fretted over the choice of Grails' Emil Amos as his replacement. Amos' style is busier, and at first seemed like a poor fit for Om's spareness-- 15-minute head-nodders don't need fills clattering away in the back.</p>
<p>However, Amos has turned out to fit right in. His playing is often Hakius-like, with a ride cymbal ticking away to mark time.  ""Cremation Ghat I"" is more his own, with a relatively uptempo groove and hand claps. With slinky bass lines, the track isn't that far off from the Folk Implosion's ""Natural One""; however, as an instrumental around three minutes long, it seems like a throwaway. In general, the album is sequenced awkwardly. The first two tracks have vocals and are around 19 and seven minutes long, respectively. Closing out the album is the instrumental two-part ""Cremation Ghat"" suite, which is about eight minutes long. It feels more like a coda than a song.</p>
<p>That's too bad, as it's the most interesting section of the record. Not only is the first part more lively than Om's typical lope, but both parts feature tamboura. This is a mixed blessing. On one hand, it adds color to Om's sound. On the other hand, Om did just fine before without additional coloration. Part of the band's appeal has been its ability to utilize its few elements. Additionally, the choice of an Indian instrument to accompany Cisneros' hippy-dippy lyrics (""Descends supine grace of the luminant/ Attunes to access light of celestial form"") is too obvious. (The Beatles' dabbling with Indian instrumentation comes to mind.) What was once an implied spirituality, drawn out through trance-like repetition, has become spoon-fed. Perhaps this evolution was inevitable: Like Sleep, Om likely could mine their minimalism only for so long.</p></div>"|13465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13465-god-is-good/|6.0|Cosmo Lee

His characters, on the other hand, are typically some place else, defined at they are by their numerous and often anachronistic affectations, foremost among them an affinity for 1950s rock, 1970s soul, and AM pop. It's those songs that have thus far composed the bulk of Tarantino's classic soundtracks and provided his films many of their most indelible moments. Think Michael Madsen slicing ears to Stealers Wheel or Robert Forster cruising around listening to the Delfonics. Tarantino's approach changed, slightly, with his two <i>Kill Bill</i> installments, which featured RZA rubbing shoulders with recycled Ennio Morricone, but by <i>Death Proof</i> he was mostly back to his usual cratedigging ways.</p>
<p>Yet even a filmmaker as audacious as Tarantino probably couldn't get away with pairing his first period flick, <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>, with another snap, crackle, and pop soundtrack. Needless to say, Kool and the Gang's ""Jungle Boogie"" just doesn't jibe with WWII Nazi hunting. But that's not to say Tarantino hews strictly to the straight and narrow, either. Tarantino again shuns an original score, but this time he picks and chooses the film's music selections specifically from a rolodex of forgotten B-movie cues or clever cinematic in-jokes, a smart complement to a film concerned with movie making and its particular powers.</p>
<p>The director's said he thinks of <i>Basterds</i> as a spaghetti western (albeit one set in Nazi-occupied France), so he again utilizes relatively obscure Morricone to impose the maestro's trademark weird moods. Other composers of note include the great Lalo Schifrin, with the groovily melodramatic ""Tiger Tank"", and the lesser-known Jacques Loussier, represented here with the title theme to <i>Dark Side of the Sun</i> (which starred Rod Taylor, who crops up in <i>Basterds</i> as Winston Churchill). Even more obscure is the presence of tracks from Gianni Ferrio and Charles Bernstein, whose ""White Lightning"" comes from the forgotten 1973 Burt Reynolds flick (though not forgotten to Tarantino, who also drew on that soundtrack for <i>Kill Bill</i>).</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without a few pop songs, too, but here Tarantino branches out into fresh territory. Sure, Billy Preston's title theme from 1972's blaxploitation classic <i>Slaughter</i> crops up as a truncated (if still cool) instrumental clip. Beyond that, only a quartet of non-instrumentals appear in the film and on this attendant collection, three of them historically compatible and one of them totally leftfield despite its brilliant use in the film. One, ""Davon Geht Die Welt Nicht Unter"", is a song by Swedish Nazi collaborator (or, more generously, cooperator) Zarah Leander, who lived out her life a pariah for her participation in Hitler's UFA film studios. Another, ""Ich Wollt Ich Wär Ein Huhn"", comes from Willy Fritsch and Lilian Harvey, the latter of whom escaped under duress from Nazi Germany (her name earns a sneer from the onscreen Joseph Goebbels in <i>Basterds</i>). Last of the contemporaneous lot is Samantha Shelton &amp; Michael Andrew's ""The Man With the Big Sombrero"", most notable in the movie for what goes down in a basement bar when the song ends with the stylus hypnotically hopping along the vinyl's inner edge.</p>
<p>That leaves David Bowie's very out of place Giorgio Moroder collaboration ""Cat People (Putting Out the Fire)"", rescued from Paul Schrader's ill-conceived 1982 remake of the Jacques Tourneur masterpiece and repurposed to much superior effect here. It shouldn't work, but it does, mostly because Tarantino realized the track's darker undercurrents suited a pivotal sequence in his film a lot better than the ending credits of Schrader's risible flop, which was lost forever to all but late night cable viewers and obsessive video store clerks with good memories. That Tarantino stored the song somewhere in that trivia filled brain of his for all these years, waiting for the right moment to use it, is one of his gifts as a filmmaker. That he also shows such a knack for stringing together such disparate source material on his various soundtracks (here minus the usual between-track banter) is one of his gifts to us.</p></div>"|13464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13464-inglourious-basterds-ost/|7.2|Joshua Klein

Be it fanboy karaoke love letters, guilty-pleasure attention-grabs, lazy B-side filler, or just plain amateurs singing into their laptops and broadcasting the results on YouTube, there's a seemingly unquenchable thirst for musical masquerading. Now covering an entire album, that takes a special testicular virility and devotion, a feat that only a few bands have had the gall (or the chops) to attempt-- your Camper van Beethoven, your Pussy Galore, your Petra Haden, your Phish. The motivations might be the same as covering a single track, but the commitment is exponentially higher. Just think of all the chords and words you have to learn!</p>
<p>So I doff my cap to Beck for making not just one attempt at full-album reenactment, but launching a whole systemic ""Record Club"" effort of recreations on his website. The game is this: Beck, and whatever L.A. scene buddies are around, spend a day covering a chosen album without rehearsal or forethought, though presumably they're printing out some lyric sheets. It may seem self-indulgent, but in practice it's likely a hell of a lot of fun. It's also an A+ use of a website, embedded video players, and a home studio, and considering the people involved, is way more interesting than most albums of original material.</p>
<p>To launch this project, Beck aimed low, choosing a little-known cult record called <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i>. Seriously though, it's a ballsy move but a smart one-- icons, after all, wear fawning worship well, and I'm much more skeptical about his in-progress follow-up pick, Leonard Cohen's <i>Songs of Leonard Cohen</i>. The roster for <i>VU &amp; Nico </i>features frequent co-conspirator Nigel Godrich, members of Beck's touring band and ""Introducing Thorunn Magnusdottir as Nico."" Oh, and Beck's bro-in-law Giovanni Ribisi, who the singer claims is ""a virtuoso of just shredding.""</p>
<p>So with all the pieces assembled, Beck and his merry band faced a fork in the road: straightforward covers, or complete reworkings? Perhaps unsatisfyingly, they choose neither: ""Sunday Morning"" suggests faithfulness will be the move, with a sleepy cello-enhanced arrangement that is a passable forgery of the original. Here, and elsewhere, Beck's Codeine head-cold voice is a passable replacement for Lou Reed, nailing the opiate haze if not quite reaching the snide pathos underneath.</p>
<p>""Waiting For the Man"" is where the <i>Record Club</i> starts to diverge from the source material, and here it's not for the best. Rather than being the taut, paranoid shuffle a song about waiting for your drug dealer really should be, Beck &amp; co. make it a ramshackle hootenanny, the approach being ""everybody grab the nearest instrument and vamp."" Unfortunately, that seemed to be the instructions for most of <i>VU &amp; Nico</i>'s epic drones, ""Venus in Furs"" and ""Heroin"", and ""European Son"" all losing their edge in overly busy arrangements and carrying a noticeable John Cale-shaped hole. ""Heroin"", in particular, is a trainwreck, with Brian Lebarton forgetting the words and screaming his way through the peaks, completely missing the seething calm that is so disarming about Reed's addict on the original (his little chuckle gets me every time).</p>
<p>But not all the makeovers are a downgrade. In the middle of the record, ""Run Run Run"" and ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" get electro-pop treatments that shouldn't work on paper, but do. The original ""Run Run Run"" always struck me as a jammy toss-off anyhow, and it's much improved by a simple drum loop and video-game rubber bass. The legendary ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" might be a harder sell, but with Magnusdottir doing Nico's ESL thing and space-y details that are pocket-Godrich, it's a gorgeous re-imagining.</p>
<p>The project's other score is maybe its humblest, a simple, delicate ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" that is as reverent as it is pitch-perfect. For all the Velvets' rep as the big scary black leather bondage and hard drugs band, it's a nice reminder that Reed could write an adorable pop song when he wanted, even if the ""reflect what you are"" backing vocals on the outro always creeped me. Less subversive creepiness here, but I maybe even (gasp) prefer the cover.</p>
<p>So surprise surprise, the spontaneous album-covering gimmick project is uneven and goofy. Much of the context that lifts <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i> to the top of many a music snob's favorite records list-- the anachronistic late-1960s doom and gloom, the death drone, Nico herself-- aren't present here. And there's not really a replacement message, a musical theme to suggest why Beck chose this record. It may not be the cover album that inspires everyone who listens to start a cover band, but it's a fun, ambitious idea that turns up a handful of moments worth ripping off the Vimeo feed.</p></div>"|13455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13455-record-club-the-velvet-underground-nico/|6.2|Rob Mitchum

You know, where the album has a pleasing ramshackle feel under the surface-level skillfulness, the sense that the vocal acrobatics or tricky instrumental interplay could suddenly veer into uncomfortable, mock amateurish expressionism.</p>
<p>By contrast, you never get the sense that Muse are anything less than in total control of their ""difficult"" music at all times. Throughout <i>The Resistance</i>, frontman Matt Bellamy is ready and willing to foreground his chops, be it tickling the ivories, hopping octaves, or tossing out increasingly tasteful solos. If the <i>The Resistance</i> is ""about"" anything, aside from the conceptual malarkey encoded in the lyrics, it's about mastery, ego-security, etc. It's the kind of all-caps, no half-stepping ART-ROCK that closes with a three-part mini-epic so shameless about its own classic rock bigness that it's billed as a ""Symphony"", complete with ""Overture"". Jumped ship yet?</p>
<p>For the wary or outright dismissive, however, <i>The Resistance</i> is also a very smartly sequenced album. it opens with the most ""pop"" sequence of the band's career, a three-song sequence aping the stadium-grade synth-rock of Depeche Mode at their crossover height. It then segues into a middle section of hard (but not <i>too</i> hard) rock, nodding in the direction of grottier bands like Queens of the Stone Age or System of a Down without stripping away the sparkle. Only then does <i>The Resistance</i> shift into the sort of fist-pumping, kitchen-sink prog you were probably expecting. It's canny: Leading the uncommitted down a drum machine paved path of catchy 1980s revivalism and straight into the path of an army of kids straddling the gap between entry-level classical and ""Headbanger's Ball"".</p>
<p>And ""army"" is right: Unity in the face of faceless post-industrial society grinding down beautiful stuff like love and friendship is perhaps Muse's great theme. Bellamy is constantly tossing out mass-shout-along-ready lyrics like ""we will be victorious"" and ""they won't stop breaking us down."" Songs get titles like ""Uprising"" and (natch) ""Resistance"". Things break down easily into a ""we"" (rarely does an ""I"" creep into Bellamy's songwriting) and a ""they."" Your age-old, rock-standard good (we, the fans) vs. evil (them, the nebulous straight government-corporate nexus) set-up, got it?</p>
<p>But unlike the creepy mass-rally overtones that so bugged early rock critics about music designed to pack civic centers-- or thrilled them when it was punk leading in the kids in revolt-- you get the sense that Bellamy's lyrics are an outgrowth of wanting to make his music as big and inclusive as possible, rather than any inchoate political impulses. No doubt Bellamy fancies himself some sort of social crusader, but his mush-headed vagueness (like Bono and Chris Martin and just about any Brit frontman operating on this scale) is designed to inspire warm fuzzy feelings of togetherness and resistance rather than offer any ten-point plan to overthrow the emotionally fascist modern world.</p>
<p>So let's take the warm fuzzy bigness of the music at face value. It's understandable if the Buckley mannerisms and Mercury multi-tracking on ""The United States of Eurasia"" aren't your cup of tea. You may cringe at the Pavlov-approved crescendos that surge through ""Guiding Light"", the sort of thing where you imagine a ProTools preset producers have nicknamed ""10,000 People Holding up Bics They Bought Especially for the Concert."" And then there's ""Exogenesis"", the aforementioned ""Symphony"" in three parts. Now a <i>Daydream Nation</i> style knowing ""trilogy"" this is not. There's massed strings. There's half-time chest-beating theatrics ready for flashpots and Vegas set design. If it's not <i>quite</i> Keith Emerson's territory-- or Celine Dion's, for that matter-- it's a similarly grandiose ballpark where the fans wear slightly different clothes.</p>
<p>But still: I'm a punk at heart, suspicious about the meeting of rock band and orchestra after all these years, and even I have to admit there's something cornily beautiful about ""Exogenesis"", like Radiohead with no fear of pushing things until the motor bursts into flames. Judged on its own terms-- out of control scale, genre-smashing ambition, musical and vocal virtuosity-- <i>The Resistance</i> is a success. It's just the kind of success where you have to appreciate a guy who builds his own guitars daring himself to make the next song even more rapturously overstuffed and classically cathartic. It's an album you can embrace or get the fuck out of its way. There's really no in between. It's high-test pop-prog hokum, better suited to mashing buttons to kill wizards or gorging on a stack of four-color batshittery than working on your thesis or darning your socks.</p>
<p>Video games or comics are probably a closer comparison than most of the music Pitchfork covers, actually. There's a prevailing idea that there's something spiritually and emotionally dangerous about grown men and women spending most of their alone-time immersed in improbable fantasies where interpersonal relationships and the traumas of the real world can be dispatched/ignored via magical powers. But do <i>you</i> want to wallow in grey impotence in the face of quotidian bullshit every damn minute of the day? Escape, whether via Matt Bellamy or the Immortal Iron Fist or the fine folks at Nintendo, shouldn't be a dirty word, at least when used sparingly.</p></div>"|13453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13453-the-resistance/|5.9|Jess Harvell

Watch the band tunnel a small groove during ""Evil, With Evil, Against Evil"", drop it, and pick it back up again before moving quickly on. They mine the ringing, orbital electronics of ""Canalfish"" for 90 gorgeous seconds before letting it slip into ""Loudly""'s more concrete whoosh. ""Passionate Introverts"", however, needs its four-plus minutes of glowing pulse to deliver its serpentine melodies and abstracted nostalgia (""Do you believe in dinosaurs at all?"", asks the chorus), and SDIG provide it the necessary breathing room. Summed, the shifting tracks pull <i>Ashes Grammar</i> through its hour-long runtime smoothly and patiently.</p>
<p><i>Ashes Grammar</i> is more propulsive than SDIG's debut, <i>Scribble Mural Comic Journal</i>, whose effects-heavy compositions sometimes felt leaden or overconsidered. ""Blood White"" and ""Loudly"" thrum along with Krautrock-y beats. Those rhythms, when mixed with SDIG's lite-psych jams, recall Caribou's <i>The Milk of Human Kindness</i> or Múm's whipped electro-folk. The band plays with contrast, often layering their catchiest and most concrete vocals (""Passionate Introverts [Dinosaurs]"", ""Failure"") over their least tidy, far-flung compositions, while their most traditionally orchestrated moments (""The White Witch"", ""Close Chorus"") receive affected cooing and wordless harmonizing.</p>
<p>If there's a real complaint to be lobbed at <i>Ashes Grammar</i> it's that the vocals are too often buried, and their mushmouth-y Liz Fraser-timbres too willingly blended into the pooled sonics. If SDIG didn't imbue so much of <i>Ashes Grammar</i> with a terse rhythmic presence, many of these songs would easily be swept into the ether.</p>
<p><i>Ashes Grammar</i> is not for those who need their pop music spit-shined and robust. Instead, SDIG form their hooks stealthily, letting acoustic guitars and a steady patter rise from the ambient beginnings of ""Starting at a Disadvantage"" or repeating phrases amidst the disparate stretches of ""Nitetime Rainbows"". ""Close Chorus"" offers big, breaking hooks only after four minutes of morning chatter.</p>
<p><i>Ashes Grammar</i> draws you in by offering outstanding moments in strange contexts; you'll re-listen to hear specific pieces even though you're unable to remember exactly when and how they occur. <i>Ashes Grammar</i> often feels like the result of a band who took Martha Reeves &amp; the Vandellas' ""Come and Get These Memories"" in the most abstract, art-damaged way possible: nostalgic, jigsaw pop music from a group of writers strong enough to keep you humming and courageous enough to make you guess.</p></div>"|13440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13440-ashes-grammar/|8.3|Andrew Gaerig

Kelly and the Runners and speedboats and everything.<span> </span>You might remember it.<span> </span>You probably don't.<span> </span>Did he really think those won over by ""All the Above"" would've been even more down after ""Go Low"" threatened two forms of sodomy in its first verse and ""H.H.E.H."" set the standard for anti-skinny jeans rap?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Whether it's seeing Freeway sign with Rhymesayers or, you know, Roc-A-Fella disintegrating, Beanie's realized it's time to move on and offers ""the lost files"" on <i>The Broad Street Bully, </i>which trades in the same irony as so many other similarly positioned mixtapes: It's constructed in a manner that pleases the sort of people who might actually pay for a Beanie Sigel album, and yet, it's being given away for free.<span> </span>Hell, it's not only an improvement over <i>The Solution</i>, but it's better than most other rap albums out there too-- such is the reality when we get Beanie in his natural state talking serious shit with only State Property alums as guests.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Beanie Sigel isn't a complex MC so much as a conflicted one-- <i>The B.Coming </i>is by far his best record because it managed to show how his remorse felt every bit as frightening as his anger, the sort of thing that makes all those tracks he did with Scarface a natural fit.<span> </span>That's not the Sigel you get on <i>The Broad Street</i><i> Bully.<span> </span></i>Befitting its stopgap, low-stakes formation, <i>Bully </i>is as about as subtle as a curb-stomping and every bit as straightforward, 12 tracks that mostly go into rich detail about you being a sucker and Beanie's ability to beat the living shit out of you.<span> </span>""The ignorance is coming,"" he intones, and while that likely refers to the title of his yet unannounced new album, you can be goddamn sure that the ignorance is here right now.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It might be a simplified rendering of Beans, but it's tough to care when it's so damn entertaining.<span> </span>Whether it's due to his no-nonsense subject matter or pugnacious persona, Beans rarely gets the credit he deserves as a lyrical craftsman, but there's not much to distract you this time around from his haughty humor, rife with internal rhyme and off-kilter cadence.<span> </span>""You'll forever be stuck under the baker's thumb/ You keep dealing with them crumbs/ Keep dealing with them bums who receive their funds in minute-sized sums.""<span> </span>Such goes a line from ""Why Wouldn't I"" but elsewhere, he lets off punchlines brimming with self-satisfaction and double entendre. <span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As far as surprises go, you'll have to take what you can get here-- the beats are just functional, even if the brazen Queen rip on ""All For It"" is kinda hilarious for never bothering to be cleared.<span> </span>Outside of Beanie's usual State of the Hood address (""The Ghetto""), about the only thing that goes off-topic is ""Run to the Roc"", where a subdued sample of the Slickers ""Johnny Too Bad"" backs Beanie's just-vague-enough hashing of his relationship with his former label-- ""Another lie told by Ol' Blue Eyes/ Blue is the color of deception, to my recollection,"" either referring to Jay-Z's insistent Sinatra-likening or any one of the <i>Blueprint </i>albums.<span> </span>There's more potential intrigue in hearing Dynasty role players like Young Chris (who's been on some kind of winning streak as of late) and Omillio Sparks give up the goods about Jigga's acumen as an executive, but somehow their restraint proves more powerful-- it might seem petty for someone at Chris' level to claim people planning his demise, but you've read a rap blog lately, right?<span> </span>It's even worse when people actually <i>can</i> bring you down.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But in a way, ""Bang Bang"" is the most revealing track on <i>Bully</i>, where Beans and State Prop associate Murda Mill riff on western films to further illustrate the numerous ways in which they can kill you.<span> </span>Besides being extremely comprehensive, it's jarring as well, an undoubtedly nerdy moment for a career that, outside of ""Mac Man"" isn't exactly brimming with them.<span> </span>But it's a heartening inclusion: Beanie might be myopically focused on the Art of War on <i>The Broad Street Bully</i>, no one works harder to make violence more graphic.</p></div>"|13448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13448-the-broad-street-bully/|7.5|Ian Cohen

I should first clarify that in my heart, there will always be a place for crummy, DIY lo-fi-- it might not be the most original shit in the world, but when applied with vigor and creativity, you've got some potentially exciting stuff on your hands. When paired with rote punk variations, laziness that's been confused for brattiness and a profound propensity for short, shambling pop-punk tunes that are as aimless as they are irritating, well, you've got the London-based female trio Pens-- they can't play, shout directionlessly at each other most of the time, and make sure that each song on their debut <i>Hey Friend, What You Doing?</i> sounds exactly like the one before it, a pastiche of uninformed garage footnotes, slug-and-chug hardcore rhythms and boneheaded tee-hee in-jokes.</p>
<p>It's not that Pens don't have the steps down or that the dance is tired, but this particular brand of raucous, don't-give-a-fuck pogo-fuel can't be this empty and boring. If more of <i>Friend </i>sounded like the single ""Freddy"" or maybe ""High in the Cinema"", we'd be in business. Carried by a way-cool keyboard melody, four-on-the-floor guitars and the girls' gleefully trying to outshine one another (and occasionally coming in once in a while to shout along together), ""Freddy"" is not only fun, but memorable and repeat-worthy. Even the oi! punk of ""High in the Cinema"" (which, in all fairness, isn't much of a song) boasts a sly cleverness (""We got no money! We gotta break in!"") that compliments Pens' aesthetic and could have potentially saved portions of <i>Friend</i>, though on second thought, maybe it's too slippery a slope to applaud a clever idea from a band that writes songs titled ""Yeah Baby I'll Take You to Bagel Town"" and ""Fuckufuckinfuck"".</p>
<p>The varying degrees of lo-finess make this thing sound even more thrown together. There's a distinct, nearly unlistenable tinniness on ""Networking"" that's a world away from the fuzzed out bassiness of opener ""Horsies"" (which also boasts a semi-interesting keyboard lick-- maybe something they might want to think about in the future), suggesting <i>Friend</i> was something pieced together and mailed off right before the post closed. And yes, I'm well aware this was recorded in a bunch of different places with shoddy equipment, but unfortunately you can't make such convenient excuses for the laggard songwriting. Taking into account that they are likely too busy making artwork for Wavves and name-checking Thruston Moore, I'm guessing that these girls probably care less about this band than we initially could assume, but hey, that's what you get when even the band name is a dick joke. But if for nothing else, Pens do provide much needed contrast in the whole lo-fi debate, proving that, sure, anyone can probably do this, but don't don't act surprised when it comes out half-baked.</p></div>"|13442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13442-hey-friend-what-you-doing/|4.2|Zach Kelly

Timbaland or Drake? Um, LeBron James? According to our RSS, the answer would appear to be Ed Droste. Now, a few years ago, a YouTube of Jay-Z swaying lazily to ""Ready, Able"" might've been a ""gotcha"" moment worthy of the Summer Jam Screen, but in 2009, the buzz it's generated is either a huge breakthrough for the hip-hop/indie conversation or a sign that seeing Jigga in the same room as Grizzly Bear is more exciting than hearing him on the same song as any of the all-stars that populate <i>The Blueprint 3</i>: After all, <i>The Blueprint 3 </i>is so certainly Jay-Z's weakest solo album, you'll be tempted to wonder if <i>Kingdom Come </i>was somehow underrated.</p>
<p>While ""30 Something"" and ""Beach Chair"" might stand as some of the most smug hip-hop ever committed to tape, they at least came from a real place, which illustrated the ""curse"" Jay so often speaks of: Nearly all of his LP's are concept albums about the state of his career, but in the 21st century, he's needed some sort of external boost to make it work, whether it's announcing his dominance of New York, his retirement, or the ability to play fast and loose with Frank Lucas' biography. Maybe it's just the timing, but like any recent MTV VMA's, <i>Blueprint 3</i> generates its event-ness from a stubborn belief in its own ability to be an event. As such, most of it finds Jay-Z dealing in contradictory impulses-- to remind listeners of his unparalleled success in the rap game, but just as often, imploring everyone to stop thinking about his unparalleled success and get on some ill-defined ""next shit.""</p>
<p>Honest question-- did Kanye West pull an inside job on Big Brother here? I mean, he gets all the good lines on ""Run This Town"" and getting Jay to follow his punchdrunk, slouchy flow on ""Hate"" has to be the result of some bar bet. But it isn't a matter of Kanye fronting him bad beats as much as a state of mind, the sort of maniacal need for approval that often humanizes Kanye but just makes Jay-Z sound insecure and whiny (see: most of <i>The Blueprint 2</i>). ""Niggas want my old shit/ Buy my old album,"" he sneers in ""On to the Next One"" over a hyperactive Swizz Beatz track that indicates Jay's not the only one trying to sum up his entire career within the span of four minutes. But ""Thank You"", ""Reminder"", and ""So Ambitious"" all go to great lengths to reiterate accomplishments that we've heard dozens of time, but without naming names, they ultimately feel toothless considering his detractors in 2009's rap game are almost incapable of being taken seriously.</p>
<p>But even as Jay attempts to flow futuristic on self-explanatory tracks like ""Off That"", ""Already Home"", and ""A Star Is Born"", he never allows any sort of torch-passing moments-- without the credits, you'd almost completely forget actual Future of Rap guys like J. Cole, Kid Cudi, and Drake even made it to the studio. The last of which is numbingly non-committal salutation to the past 10 years of hip-hop royalty with all the insight of an <i>Encarta </i>entry-- yeah, Eminem was a white guy and he still got respect. Those were the times, right?</p>
<p>We can wrangle with the moral implications of Jay-Z making a track like ""D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)"" when the very next song on <i>Blueprint 3 </i>has Rihanna (to say nothing of whoever's on the hook for ""Reminder""), but the singles actually gain a sort of halo effect for their familiarity, or at least giving Jay some sort of topical construct. Elsewhere, there's just such a weird vibe-- Jay-Z still <i>sounds </i>like himself, but for someone whose lyrics become the <i>lingua franca </i>of the hip-hop community for months after any of his releases, he goes vast stretches of time without saying anything remotely memorable. He's in <i>Kingdom Come </i>autopilot here, ""get me out of these 16 bars"" clock-punching intermittently spiked with chuckle-worthy rich rapper rhetoric (""nowadays I eat quail/ I'll probably never see jail""), pulled-from-<i>People </i>namedrops (""no I'm not a Jonas,"" plus a Bernie Madoff reference that we won't get into), and a ""downward dog"" coke rap that even Clipse might think twice about.</p>
<p>Even stranger is how it invokes the title of the original <i>Blueprint </i>(not to mention an aborted attempt to opportunistically recall its release date), but bears no sonic resemblance to it at all. Timbaland clearly wasn't bringing his A-game here (""Reminder"" and the dumbfounding ""Venus vs. Mars"" are phoned-in from his uninspired mid-decade valley), but the other big names, even Kanye, follow suit with the most middling futurism 2004 had to offer, or the kind of Vegas schmaltz that make all those Sinatra at the opera lines uncomfortably trenchant-- the piledriver hooks of ""Run This Town"" and ""Empire State of Mind"" are content to annoy their way to ubiquity, but<i> </i>the cheesed-out synths of <i>­</i>""So Ambitious"" clearly demonstrates the difference between ""ft. Pharrell"" and ""produced by the Neptunes.""</p>
<p>I guess we should've brought up ""Young Forever"" earlier, and the answer to your question is ""Alphaville, not Rod Stewart,"" and done completely straight-faced by Mr. Hudson. So menopausal and trite that it makes ""Beach Chair"" sound like ""Streets Is Watching"", Jay-Z rounds out <i>Blueprint 3 </i>with a gaggle of self-help bromides-- ""just a picture perfect day that lasts a whole lifetime/ And it never ends because all we have to do is hit rewind.""  It's only passable as next-level reverse psychology, inspiring a demand of <i>another </i>Jay-Z album in spite of how godawful <i>Blueprint 3 </i>is, just as long as ""Young Forever"" isn't the last song we hear from him.</p>
<p>But in the end, Jay-Z's probably right about his claim this year that hip-hop could learn a thing or two from indie rock, even if he's purposefully vague about what that actually means. Should rappers start booking studio time with, like, Nico Muhly? Well, there's always <i>Late Registration</i>. Talk a good game about making ""experimental albums,"" like Jay's doing already? <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i>. Is Jay-Z really the kind of guy who should be telling rappers to think differently about building a fanbase when his only mixtape was created to sell a shoe? Because from its roster of producers and guest spots to its elaborate marketing, <i>Blueprint 3 </i>is the kind of stuck-on-stupid, event-driven money pit that proves while Jay-Z's at a point where he's got no one to answer to but himself, he's still capable of an entire hour of failing to take his own advice.</p></div>"|13445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13445-the-blueprint-3/|4.5|Ian Cohen

They wrote some original material and learned a couple of Beatles songs. They took their show 20 miles southeast to Hoboken, drove to Manhattan under the Hudson River, tucked in their shirts, pushed their glasses up on their nosebridges, and unleashed a kind of hypnotic punk-lite so buttoned up that it sounds choked-- like they counted to four and grabbed an electric fence. Did I say the Feelies are a rock band? I misspoke. They're a particle collider.</p>
<p><i>Crazy Rhythms</i>, their 1980 debut, has none of the attitudinal markings of rock-- no looseness, no swing, no danger, no laughs. Its cover-- a band portrait on a sky-blue void, echoed 14 years later on Weezer's ""blue album"" -- is bland and eerie. It looks like a misplaced rendering of four boys whose closest contact with rock music came from fixing radios. The title of the album appears as some innovative form of non-joke.</p>
<p>And yet, and yet. Three-chord punk-- apparently too excessive for them-- is boiled down to two-chord devotionals: one for the first three minutes, one for the second. Two- and three-note guitar solos drone over the mix like a Muezzin's call. Bill Million and Glenn Mercer sing in grey, unimpressive voices-- probably influenced by the Velvet Underground, but just as likely a product of the belief that lead vocals were for generally immodest people.</p>
<p>The focus and direction of the sound hangs on Mercer and Million's guitars, but the essence of the album-- the DNA sequence not found anywhere else-- is its percussion tracks.  Cymbals and hi-hats are ignored almost entirely-- too cathartic, too showy. Almost every track is overdubbed with a dry chorus of cowbells, claves, woodblocks, bells and maracas. Glenn Mercer's credit on a cover of the Beatles' ""Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey"" reads: ""other guitar, vocals, bell, coat rack."" Drummer Anton Fier thumps out the words <i>NOT TIRED YET NOT TIRED YET NOT TIRED YET</i> in Morse code on his tom-toms. Presumably, shows ended with the rest of the band unplugging him.</p>
<p>It's fastidious, committed and unendingly tense music. A couple of tracks-- first single ""Fa Ce'-La"" and ""Original Love""-- take the shape of pop songs: A few minutes, a few parts, a verse, a chorus. Most of the songs, though, are shaped like Steve Reich or Philip Glass compositions: Music that creates drama by swelling, shading and repeating, not carving out peaks and valleys. The album's longest, most arresting tracks -- ""Forces at Work"" and ""Crazy Rhythms""-- don't seem to change as much as <i>dilate</i>.</p>
<p>The music on the album is rare, but the tone-- especially with the knowledge that it was never really replicated by any other band-- is rarer. Weezer, the Talking Heads and the Modern Lovers used their social eccentricities as badges of honor and safe vantage points for self-expression. The Feelies don't sound any more comfortable on <i>Crazy Rhythms</i> than you imagine they might standing in a room full of strangers or mountain lions. They sound commanded by inspiration, almost religiously single-minded. Mark Abel, who co-produced the album with Mercer and Million, called them ""the most obstinate people I've ever met."" According to Jim DeRogatis's liner notes for the reissue, they started telling adulatory interviewers that driving through the Holland Tunnel gave them headaches.</p>
<p><i>Crazy Rhythms</i> is their big album. Their talked-about one. <i>The Good Earth</i>, produced by R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and released six years later, is their little one. Bassist Keith DeNunzio and Anton Fier left the band (Fier went on to play with Bill Laswell, Pere Ubu, John Zorn and a gymnasium's worth of notable avant-rock musicians). Dave Weckerman, Brenda Sauter and Stan Demeski-- all local musicians Million and Mercer had been tooling around in side projects with-- joined.</p>
<p>The tempos are relaxed, the percussion understated, the instrumentation largely acoustic. It's no less hypnotic than <i>Crazy Rhythms</i>, but it has a different notion of infinity: Wheat fields, Sunday drives, childhood bedtimes to the sound of adults murmuring from the living room. The cover image-- the band, slightly sepia-toned and standing in tall grass-- is a rural reconsideration of <i>Crazy Rhythms</i>, a stepping back. Mercer's vocals are a stream-of-consciousness hum under the shimmer of guitars. ""Being a guitar player,"" he said, ""I don't have much of a need to express myself as a singer"" -- a claim that makes you think the guitar solos are going to be fireworks, and they aren't. Fireworks are not what the Feelies were about.</p>
<p>You don't hear too many people talking in hyperbole about <i>The Good Earth</i> is for the same reasons you don't hear people talking in hyperbole about taking a nap in the park. Listening start-to-finish, it sounds even more removed than <i>Crazy Rhythms</i>, an album that blurs together and exists unto itself-- different enough from their first album to be incomparable, different enough from a lot of other music-- even R.E.M.-- to be unmistakable as anyone else.</p>
<p>These albums have been out of print for several years. If you were lucky (or old) enough to own them the first time around, buy them again. The bonus material is nothing special: New live recordings from their recent reunion shows, a couple of demos, a couple of older covers (but not the cover of ""Paint It, Black"" appended to the last edition of <i>Crazy Rhythms</i>). And you have to download the songs using a little business card with a serial number because the band thought the albums should stand on their own, which they should.</p>
<p>But oh the glorious sound. I am not someone who relaxes on an animal hides in front of four-foot tall speakers and compares the relative merits of recordings, but I will tell you that these remasters sound fantastic-- crisp, nuanced, and all kinds of other luxurious adjectives. Apparently, there's a dog barking the background of <i>The Good Earth</i> interlude ""When Company Comes"". Someone mumbles during the guitar break on ""Let's Go"". And the coat rack, as clear and unexpected as ever.</p></div>"|13403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13403-crazy-rhythms-the-good-earth/|9.1|Mike Powell

One of the end results of the Black Lips' possibly kicked-outta-India incident back in January, aside from a deluge of some of the most breathlessly manic press-release freakouts I've ever read, was an emergency stopover in Berlin to recuperate/decompress with King Khan and Mark ""BBQ"" Sultan. Apparently the mood was so charged and jubilant in the aftermath they celebrated by spending eight days recording an ""evil gospel"" album. Well... shit, why not?</p>
<p>It's important to keep this narrative in mind when listening to <i>The Almighty Defenders</i>, because it definitely sounds like it took no more than a week to exist from conception to completion, even if it's probably more likely that the group's actually a culmination of a more long-stewing collaborative interest. It's a hasty sounding album in pretty much every sense of the word, with spontaneous-sounding takes and muddy recording that sounds almost surreptitious. It's like listening in on a bunch of like-minded friends screwing around in a jam session, which it technically pretty much is.</p>
<p>The album contains 10 originals and a cover of the Mighty Hannibal's ""I'm Coming Home"", all of which fall pretty strongly in line with what you might expect from a Black Lips/King Khan &amp; BBQ Show hybrid, only messier and more incoherent: lots of garage-soul wailing, drums that sound like they're being hit with a stake-driving hammer, snarling guitar riffs lathed into crude, shambling catchiness, and the occasional UHF station Horror Chiller Theater organ. Both bands' propensity to run the wider gamut of pre-psychedelic rock'n'roll is bolstered a bit by the gospel underpinnings, though many of the songs-- sludgy vintage rhythm &amp; blues (""Bow Down and Die""), amped-up doo-wop (""Cone of Light""), goonish blues-rock (""Over the Horizon"")-- don't need too far of a push to get there. It's a shame that the on-the-fly nature of this album dampens what could've been a superb collaboration given another month's worth of studio time, though there's moments where they manage to pull through anyways; leadoff track ""All My Loving"" isn't all that complicated, but it gets its hooks in you quick.</p>
<p>Now if only I could figure out what they're singing. The biggest downfall of <i>The Almighty Defenders </i>is that most of the vocals seem to be miked sloppily, so while you get a nice fuzzed-out quality to the call-and-response chants and the wild-assed choirboy choruses, the actual lyrics often get subsumed into this big swirl of noise. It's especially bad on ""Cone of Light"", where Mark Sultan's amazing deranged-Sam-Cooke voice, strong as it is, still winds up smothered under percussion. When the irreverent-gospel theme is decipherable, it can be pretty striking, if frequently a little too prone to self-aware, button-pushing edginess: ""Jihad Blues"" is a demented sweet-chariot-ride song that invokes exactly what you think it does (""just gimme a boxcutter and a one-way ticket""), and I'm banking on ""The Ghost With the Most"" being the first time in recorded history that the Holy Spirit is invoked using a catchphrase from the movie <i>Beetlejuice</i>. But maybe the spirit's more important than the letter anyways: there's two tracks in a row (""30 Second Air Blast"" and ""Death Cult Soup n' Salad"") that are mostly just incoherent howling and mumbling and the occasional Three Stooges imitation, and they might be the most ecstatic moments on the album. Maybe the most profound, too.</p></div>"|13427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13427-the-almighty-defenders/|4.2|Nate Patrin

His music is often desolate, to be sure, but I can't say it's ever felt cold. Also, from his songs it doesn't seem like Joyner ever goes out-- his poetic lyrics give me the feel of a cloistered life, like he spends his days alone projecting himself into characters that face life for him. He's not just a little like Leonard Cohen, and that extends from the feeling his recordings embody to the way he sings. His voice is a broken instrument, gesturing toward melody as much as actually singing it, and it could be a sticking point for a lot of listeners. He's had that style for almost 20 years now, so fans are used to it, even love it, and you can see it a couple of ways. Some will hear a voice that can't convey its songs, while others will hear a powerful foil for the ramshackle country/folk/chamber backing of his band, not to mention a croak that reflects the tone of the writing.</p>
<p>I admit that even as a seasoned Joyner listener, there are still moments where I wish he'd just hit the note, and on this record, there is one song where that's the case. Closer ""Roll On"" is a mid-tempo country tune soaked in pedal steel guitar, saloon piano, and backing vocals by Sarah Gleason and Pearl Lovejoy Boyd that all roll along just fine, apart from the fact that Joyner is just kind of tunelessly there in the mix. It has the effect of your drunk friend singing along to the band in a bar, and while that can be fun while it lasts, you wouldn't want to listen to a playback of it the next day. The other tempos are slower, the music less celebratory, and the songs more suited to his style.</p>
<p>At the other end of the record, the nine-minute opener ""The Drunken Boat"" is a masterful drifter's narrative that moves seamlessly in its middle from understated country backing to dark chamber folk dominated by Laraine Kaizer's intricate string arrangement-- the point where the song makes the full transition is perhaps the biggest surprise in his whole discography, and the song's final third is pretty breathtaking, getting progressively lusher until Joyner is left behind by the violins as they spiral off into silence. Kaizer's sympathetic arrangements help make a couple of other tracks, too, especially ""Ambulances"", where the fluttering strings and ghostly backing harmonies create a haunted atmosphere. As the electric piano, glockenspiel, pedal steel, and acoustic guitars pile up on top of those elements, it makes for an almost comically full arrangement for such a skeletal song.</p>
<p>For a guy who's much more a poet than a singer, Joyner seems to love a good musical flourish, and he doesn't miss many opportunities for one here. He goes for a different flavor on ""Last Evening on Earth"", with the band laying down an inky blues-noir track to accompany lines like ""the moon crashed in your whiskey glass and it took away all your friends."" <i>Out Into the Snow</i> is another solid entry in a long career for Joyner, and it seems his place as the dark observer on the indie world's fringe is pretty well set. And that's fine-- this is music that needs time to settle and grow into you, and that's a mission often best accomplished away from the harshest glare of spotlights.</p></div>"|13447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13447-out-into-the-snow/|6.8|Joe Tangari

It's not a very encouraging question when talking pop records, let alone a bedroom-psych pop record from the mind of a guy going for his Master's in ethnomusicology. But those of us who still consider patience to be a virtue will find that Julian Lynch's debut full-length <i>Orange You Glad</i> is full of great little moments that gradually (and successfully) cultivate songs brimming with hushed wonder. What really saves these four-track recordings from relying too heavily on aimless atmospherics is a profound interest in late-1960s psychedelia-- I'm guessing that spending most of your time writing lengthy papers about native Tunisian music is either going to heavily influence the record you are making, or drive you deep into the garage, back to a stack of Love LPs.</p>
<p>Most of us already familiar with Lynch probably are so as a result of his work with the Underwater Peoples label and their associates (he frequently plays in and with Ducktails, his ""Banana Jam Pt. 1"" was a highlight on this summer's <i>Underwater Peoples Records Showcase</i> sampler). But Lynch might soon have a niche all of his own thanks to the various improvisations on <i>Orange</i>, all anchored by uniformed suites of airy electronics, slow-burn rhythms, and his garbled coos and whines. Even the most patient (i.e., stoned) listener probably wouldn't come back for seconds if this was all there was to absorb, but Lynch interjects these weird little set pieces on almost every song-- that crazy low-budget Jimi Hendrix lick on opener ""Venom"", that quirky-cool bird-call synth blip on the too-short highlight ""Rancher""-- that gives these pieces real character on an album that could have could have lazily revisited the same tones and ideas in an effort to over-establish ""feel"".</p>
<p>""Winterer One"" nicely encapsulates a lot of the stronger points on <i>Orange</i>. ""I saw witchcraft tonight,"" sings Lynch (it's one of the few discernable lyrics on the whole album, but one helpfully indicative of the moods explored here) over muffled tambourines and a bleary acoustic guitar line that gorgeously melts into a set of buttery-soft synth tones. It's a quiet victory with the ethereal  sadness of a <i>Nebraska</i> cut, oddly welcoming and calming. ""Mercury"" would be a big time throw-away if it weren't for Lynch's elusive clarinet carrying the whole thing, weaving in and out of those aquatic guitar textures like a fish through an anemone. And the fractured psych of ""Andaza"", it's violent wah-wah pedals screaming in the face of melancholic ho-hummery all make for wonderfully contrasted pop pieces that make the patience so virtuous.</p>
<p>Of course there is the obligatory 11-minute droner ""The Flood"" smack dab in the middle of the thing, a tedious rumination that plays like a very drugged-out seance for a snake charmer, only not a pinch as awesome as that might sound. You can't help but feel a little exhausted after it, leaving ""Winterer Two"" to stand as an unnecessary epilogue and rendering the syrupy far-outness of ""Seed"" a little bland. Moments like these curry some favor with those worried that <i>Orange</i> might not be much more than a welcome addition to your ""Sleep"" playlist, but that application seems somewhat backwards with such wide-eyed intrigue being so delicately stoked time and again. So if you do doze off with such brightly inviting ideas and sounds this hard at work, consider your REM cycle pleasantly soundtracked.</p></div>"|13439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13439-orange-you-glad/|6.8|Zach Kelly

As it happens, Brown's arrogance was misplaced and the band's rock stardom a lot shorter-lived than anyone expected. <span>The Stone Roses made a stunning debut,</span> then bled out in a slow agony of contractual disputes, internal discord, and, eventually, public indifference (though their sophomore release and swan song, <i>Second Coming</i>, is nowhere near as bad as people say). More prosaic than drugs or young death, this trifecta killed a career that now essentially consists of <span>just</span> one great record.</p>
<p>But the story of <i>The Stone Roses</i> is really a tale of two records, divided by an ocean. <span>As Sony (which now owns original label Silvertone) rolls out a remastered version in celebration of the album's 20th anniversary, Brits wrestle with what's become a cultural crucible.</span> <span>When a record's aura or associations, rather than its content, begins dominating discussions-- especially </span><span>when a nation routinely votes it one of rock history's best</span><span>-- clothing-deprived-emperor jive usually isn't far behind. And the fact that the </span><span>former idols have had the bad grace to survive into their forties and release a string of middling yet well-promoted solo albums</span><span> hasn't boosted the <i>The Stone Roses</i>' reputation at home.</span></p>
<p>We Americans are relatively unencumbered (though it'll be fun to see if <i>Nevermind </i>incites as much hair-tearing when it <span>hits</span> 20 in two years). The Roses, and the ""Madchester"" scene with which they were loosely associated, never translated to the U.S. beyond modern rock radio and late-night MTV. They also failed to hugely impact an underground hostile to anything that implied feet were made for more than propping up a body so it could sip beer and look bored. Many prominent American critics didn't champion the Roses, either. <span>""What do [the Stone Roses] do that the Byrds or Buffalo Springfield didn't do better in 1967?"" Robert Christgau wondered in <i>The Village Voice</i>, typifying the Boomer establishment's predictable position on a band of GenXers cheeky enough to remind them, ""the past was yours, but the future's mine.""</span></p>
<p>To answer Christgau's question, what the Stone Roses did better was marry smart psychedelic pop to dance grooves in an incredibly accessible and powerful way that appealed both to rock and rave fans, lovers of hooks and beats, punks and people who actually welcomed 10-minute guitar solos. If influence matters, the album influenced scores of other bands, including Spiritualized, Primal Scream (which bassist Mani joined after the Roses collapsed), the Manic Street Preachers, the Beta Band, the Libertines, and, as the Gallagher brothers have never missed an opportunity to assert, Oasis. And unlike most of the Madchester bands, the Roses weren't <span>only</span> about a sound, a vibe, or a scene<span>. They owned a clutch of insanely catchy, emotionally nuanced, lyrically astute songs about love, lust, youth, and raging ambition </span>that didn't require a historical context to understand or embrace. Exploding the false dichotomy of album band/singles band, <i>The Stone Roses</i> is a logical, cohesive album made up of incredible stand-alone songs.</p>
<p><span>To wit, ""She Bangs the Drums"", ""Waterfall"", ""Made of Stone"", ""(Song for My) Sugar Spun Sister"", and ""Fool's Gold"" (a later single that was appended to the original U.S. release and, unlike fellow longtime U.S. add-on ""Elephant Stone"", reappears on the reissue), would make stellar radio hits in any decade. </span>Brown's vocals, guitarist John Squire's intricate fingerwork and mighty riffs, and rhythm section Mani and Reni's sly, lockstepping grooves, are a textbook case of the whole far exceeding its components. Even ""Elizabeth, My Dear"", a notorious monarchy smackdown set to ""Scarborough Faire""'s half-millennium-old melody, was ballsy then and remains deliciously tart today.</p>
<p>But queen-bashing and other acts of symbolic resistance aside (""Bye Bye Badman"" and Squire's abstract expressionist cover art reference the 1968 student protests that uprooted France's political and cultural establishments), <i>The Stone Roses</i> isn't a <span>radical, or even particularly progressive,</span> work: From its verse-chorus-verses, to its meticulous overdubs and careful sequencing, to its revival-- however cleverly repurposed-- of hoary old rock myths (""I don't have to sell my soul/ He's already in me""), the album is a slick production designed for maximum market penetration. And for something that signaled a generational handoff, it's awfully invested in the previous generation's specious valorization of The Album, not to mention<span> the</span> hippie values inscribed in psychedelia <span>(on this point at least, Christgau was correct)</span>.</p>
<p>Nobody, therefore, need be put out by Sony's splashy remarketing campaign. The 20th anniversary edition is available in four formats, from a standard single CD or vinyl set to a $120 ""collector's"" box of four discs, four vinyl LPs, and such extras as signed prints of Squire's artwork, a lemon-shaped USB, wallpaper, and ringtones. I can't recommend dipping into your rent money to buy that thing, but $30 for the <span>elegantly</span> designed deluxe edition, which includes the remastered album, a disc of demos, a DVD with live footage and videos (most of which are lame pastiches of said live footage), and a booklet of <span>band member reminiscences, seems fair to fans. </span>Largely lacking the funk that snuck into the studio, the demos are still a phenomenal bunch of tunes (including some that didn't make final cut) that should finally put to rest rumors that the Roses were nobodies who came out of nowhere. The demos also officially confirm that, left to his own devices, Brown sings about as well as you do on a shit-faced midnight karaoke dare. But hey, he cleans up nicely. In fact, Brown's brooding, beautiful self-harmonies on the album may be one of producer John Leckie's <span>finest </span>achievements.</p>
<p>Leckie teamed up with Brown to remaster the LP, which, produced at the tail-end of the vinyl era, lacked some range at the low end and suffered<span> from its tin-timbred </span><span>late-80s </span><span>drum sound,</span> among other issues. Now, the infamous bassline that opens ""I Wanna Be Adored"" has an even more thrilling anticipatory deep-earth rumble; instead of slaps, ""She Bangs the Drums""' beats pack actual punches; and the originally muddy textures of a song like ""Made of Stone"" are brighter and broader-spectrumed<span>, with crisp chiming guitars and lustrous basslines</span>. The record industry has whipped itself into a frenzy of last-ditch, cash-grabbing CD reissues lately, but the original <i>Stone Roses</i> actually merited a sound overhaul. And the results are brilliant, further supporting the case for classic album status-- if support's needed.</p></div>"|13449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13449-the-stone-roses/|10.0|Amy Granzin

Like, I dunno, making her official recording debut with a version of jazz standard ""Summertime"". Joining a reunited Jesus and Mary Chain onstage at Coachella. Taking on the Tom Waits songbook. Covering Jeff Buckley's ""Last Goodbye"" for a romantic comedy based on a self-help book. Or owning the lips that inspired Katy Perry's ""I Kissed a Girl"". Um, I guess that last one isn't really Johansson's fault.</p>
<p>Add to the list: Putting out an album inspired by the 1960s duets of Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot. Especially when the unkempt male in question is Pete Yorn, who had an unfairly panned sleeper of a debut album back in the David Gray era, then followed it with the kind of blandly forgettable slump that made a lot of people wonder why they ever liked either of those guys in the first place. On last year's <i>Anywhere I Lay My Head</i>, Waits' songs and producer David Sitek's woozy 4AD-style majesty would've made for an intriguing listen even if Johansson had been awful (she totes wasn't). <i>Break Up</i>, by contrast, resembles a Yorn album: nine tracks of tastefully beige, electronics-brushed roots-rock. Suddenly, Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward's collaboration as She &amp; Him sounds like <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i>.</p>
<p>In a way, it's a shame Yorn ever started making comparisons to classic ""guy-girl"" duos at all. If you take <i>Break Up</i> for what it is-- a low-key project recorded with little preparation in a couple of afternoons three years ago-- then the set has its charms. First single ""Relator"", for one, with its buzzing instrumental hook and breezy acoustic shuffle, is engagingly playful <i>Rushmore</i> fodder, only a White Stripes credit away from a spot on way too many year-end lists. When Yorn goes uptempo again, with the weeping guitar fills and crisp drum machines of ""Blackie's Dead"", he comes up with more of the blankly catchy hooks that propelled him to stardom. The song even ends with a mildly satisfying twist: ""Darlin', you're forgiven/ I don't like what's goin' on.""</p>
<p>That's right: In case you couldn't tell from the name, <i>Break Up</i> is about two characters who gradually find themselves in an impossible situation of their own. This conceit means just that much more extra-musical baggage for the skeptics out there to overlook. But as you might expect, it happens to suit Johansson. When she's able to sing closer to her natural, deeper range, as on a vaguely futuristic cover of late Big Star member Chris Bell's 1978 single ""I Am the Cosmos"", the husky creak in her voice would demand attention even if you didn't know her from Kirsten Dunst. But the same song is also one of the main instances where Quincy Jones grandson Sunny Levine's generally background-friendly production starts to get in the way, all vwerping bass and annoying tick-tocks. On predictable country-rocker ""I Don't Know What to Do"", complete with honky-tonk piano, how much fun Johansson is having beams right through lyrics clouded with confusion and doubt.</p>
<p>It's nobody's fault that She &amp; Him's fine <i>Volume One</i> came out first, but the girl-next-door quality, like the usually higher vocal register, suits the glamorous Johansson less than it would the more approachable Deschanel. And that's when Johansson isn't buried in the mix: On banjo-rock plodder ""Wear and Tear"", she gets in barely a few backing words, while on bossa nova-tinged ""Shampoo"", Levine's stereo-panned electronic sounds-- twinkling in one channel, crunching in the other-- communicate the couple's disconnect better than anything in their dull dialogue (Johansson: ""Run away""; Yorn: ""I'd go anywhere with you""). Even on ""Relator"", Johansson's voice is crammed into the same kind of telephone-style filter that Yorn used to more memorable effect on 2001 single ""Life on a Chain"".</p>
<p>Yorn's story really isn't as different from Johansson's as you might think. His first big break came through the movies, too, when ""Strange Condition"" (later re-recorded with R.E.M.'s Peter Buck) landed on the soundtrack to 2000 Farrelly Brothers film <i>Me, Myself &amp; Irene</i>. Nor is <i>Break Up</i> Yorn's first collaboration with a female singer. He previously worked with the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines on ""The Man"", an otherwise pretty typical Yorn midtempo strummer from his rock-leaning 2006 album, <i>Nightcrawler</i>. More recently, Yorn-- like Johansson-- has turned to veterans from the world of indie rock, working with Saddle Creek producer Mike Mogis on this year's cleverly titled <i>Back and Fourth</i>.</p>
<p>Still, ""Relator"" aside, there's little about this duo's chemistry that lives up to Matt and Kim, let alone Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra. ""The memory fades away,"" Yorn sings in that faded Ryan Adams whisper on <i>Break Up</i>'s sorrowful finale, ""Someday"". Their album is better than the knee-jerk beauty haters will tell you, but it rarely has the tunes or emotional impact to make it one of those rare impossible situations you'll actually want to remember. Breaking up shouldn't be this hard to do.</p></div>"|13415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13415-break-up/|4.7|Marc Hogan

In Stars she plays the tart, girlish counterpoint to Torquil Campbell's Morrissey-loving drama queen, grounding his theatrical tenor in realism on their bubbly, synthesizer-kissed pop. And in Broken Social Scene she is part of the crowd, one of a trio of shivery voiced women who add emotional hooks to the collective's often cerebral, atmospheric sound. On her own, however, she lacks heft. On her second woodsy solo album she admits as much by loading the collection with covers-- four of the 11 tracks are remakes on this 31-minute record. Which is a shame because, even though the album is slight, it is quite pretty, thanks to its lush, intimate production.</p>
<p>Despite the padding. Millan's originals are the best parts of <i>Masters of the Burial</i>. ""Low Sail"" flickers like a campfire with its warm strings and understated pedal steel melting under the repeated, lissome-fingered acoustic guitar arpeggio. ""Lost Compass"", over too soon at less than two-minutes-long, turns a smoky ode to feverish sexual desire into a spare, acoustic waltz. And ""Day to Day"" distinguishes itself as a practically a cappella endeavor. With just some tinny percussion-- which sounds partly like a sampled live drumline and partly like a fuzzy programmed drum machine-- to bolster her own feathery tones, the emphasis is placed squarely on Millan's best musical feature: her honeyed-twilight voice. On her last solo outing, 2006's <i>Honey From the Tombs</i>, Millan presented herself as a cowgirl-chanteuse, drowning her sorrows in whiskey and Emmylou Harris records. But though it is torchy and folksy, this collection mostly eschews that vibe-- the most notable exception being album closer ""Bound"", which dosados with fiddle flourishes, pedal steel, and the Canadian singer's valiant attempt at Southern twang as she sings lines about ""the fussin', the fightin', the boozin', [and] the cryin'"".</p>
<p>Millan's taste in covers is eccentric, running the gamut from the obscure (""Old Perfume"" by defunct Canadian rockers Weeping Tile) to the expected (""Day to Day"" by Jenny Whiteley whose ""Baby I"" was the lone cover on <i>Honey From the Tombs</i>). Her version of Richard Hawley's ""Run for Me"" is a surprising success, though, with her feminine murmur adding new depth to a song that originally hinged on its British songwriter's growling, masculine delivery. And while Millan's version of Death Cab for Cutie's ""I Will Follow You Into The Dark"" is handsome enough with its keening pedal steel and kettle-steam harmonies, it feels unnecessary. Did we really need another version of Death Cab's love-and-death theme song? The original is more than mawkish enough.</p>
<p>Overall, the gauzy prettiness of the collection, its initial strength, can get boring, and things never manage to heat up beyond a low simmer. Without Campbell to up the dramatic stakes or other Broken Social Scenesters to quirk up the percussion or rouse the dynamics, Millan sounds bland. But even if her solo work is mostly one-note, at least the alluring voice she sings it with is always pleasurable.</p></div>"|13437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13437-masters-of-the-burial/|5.8|Rebecca Raber

But if the New Zealand trio's output has been notoriously sporadic over their 32-year lifespan, their releases have been fortuitously timed to capitalize on their unyielding influence: After a brief string of legend-making singles in the early 1980s, the band's relatively prolific 1990-96 run coincided with the ascendance of Clean acolytes Pavement and Yo La Tengo; their last release, 2001's <i>Getaway</i>, dovetailed with the Strokes and the Shins' back-to-basics ethos; while the new <i>Mister Pop</i>-- only their fifth full-length release-- arrives at a time when a new generation of lo-fidelity all-stars (Jay Reatard, Bradford Cox, Crystal Stilts, Love Is All) is displaying a voracious appetite for Kiwi pop.</p>
<p>But the Clean have always exuded a casual grace that suggests they'd still be making the same records even if no one was listening, employing the same set of devices-- ramshackle locomotive rhythms, buoyant basslines, swirling organ lines, and wide-smile melodies-- irrespective of prevailing fashions, technological developments, or geopolitical unrest. And yet, the Clean's periodic resurgences serve as a reminder that, in a world of uncertainty, there are still some things you can rely on.</p>
<p>Despite the eight-year layoff since <i>Getaway</i>, <i>Mister Pop</i> effectively picks up right where we left off, with a pair of warm-up exercises-- the metronomic organ-grinding jam ""Loog"" and the possibly self-referential dream-pop ditty ""Are You Really on Drugs?""-- that feel like vapor-trail echoes of its predecessor's distended, psychedelic haze. Even in light of the Clean's lo-fi legacy, the tracks feel demo-grade, built on single ideas that, while lasting only three minutes each, still feel run into the ground, begging the question of whether eight years was actually long enough for the song reservoir to replenish itself again. But such quibbles are cast aside 30 seconds into ""In the Dreamlife You Need a Rubber Soul"", a headlight-bright jangle-pop pleaser (possibly about the new Beatles reissues?) that boasts all the hallmarks of classic Clean. On another track, David Kilgour makes an even more explicit reinforcement of <i>Mister Pop</i>'s return-to-form intent: over a paisley-toned, mod-rock swing, he repeats, ""It puts me right back in the day.""</p>
<p>And so <i>Mister Pop</i> stays the course for the rest of its relatively compact 10-song, 34-minute length, reshaping the Clean's core components into poignant bossa nova instrumentals (""Simple Fix""), propulsive Krautrock-outs (""Tensile"") and, as only they can, bizarro fuzz-organ jigs that resemble <i>White Light/White Heat</i>-era Velvets auditioning for ""Riverdance"" (""Moonjumper""). But whenever <i>Mister Pop</i> threatens to drift off, it's grounded by an ace-in-the-hole strummer like ""Factory Man"", a Go-Betweens-worthy working-class-hero portrait that, rather than comment on the blue-collar life from an artist's distance, sees a kinship. ""He's a factory man/ And I'm no better than he 'cause I'm a factory man, too,"" Kilgour concludes. And after all these years, the Clean's assembly-line craftsmanship is as well-oiled as ever.</p></div>"|13423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13423-mister-pop/|7.3|Stuart Berman

As much as that film deserves to be looped infinitely in In-Flight Movie Hell, it kind of made perfect sense to peg Lerche to handle the tunes, most of which happily remained congruent with his ever-wistful, singer-songwriter romanticism.

Nevertheless, he has the good sense to pay close attention to arrangements and general songcraft on <i>Heartbeat Radio</i>, reinforcing his pleasant earnestness sufficiently enough that the heartsick sunniness sticks with you all afternoon, even when the actual songs themselves don't always do the same.</p>
<p>What saves most of <i>Heartbeat Radio</i> from becoming too aware of itself is Lerche's deft ear for composition that, when he sticks to the script, often benefits him greatly. Grandiose opener ""Good Luck"" wouldn't be much more than half-assed Coldplay bombast, but the wild strings egg on a fortuitous build that sets an exciting tone for the rest of the album. Title track ""Heartbeat Radio"" follows, confirming Lerche's fondness for Belle and Sebastian-- unfortunately, the energy isn't channeled properly, leaving the track sounding like a spazzy <i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i> outtake. But cuts like the following ""I Cannot Let You Go"" are so crisp and immediately tuneful it's easy to ignore the quirkier missteps. Shakers, bright acoustic guitars, and great little piano accents play so simply and delightfully on ""Let You Go"", you wonder why the guy even bothered to hire all those viola and cello players.</p>
<p>Still, those string accompaniments are pretty sharp. Not only are the players solid, but Lerche knows just where to place them. ""Like Lazenby""-- an ordinary little ballad with a strange ""take me back"" metaphor involving ""the second James Bond"" George Lazenby-- successfully morphs into a lush slice of garden pop with the addition of those swooning strings. Even on such well rounded, unapologetically Beatles-indebted fare like ""Words &amp; Music"" and ""Guess It's Gonna Rain Today"", the strings are what you end up taking away with you. (There's nothing coy about Lerche's Fab Four flirtations-- most of the songs found here owe a great deal to the band's mid-to-late-1960s studio output.)</p>
<p>Not everything here is salvageable, like the irritatingly sugary ""If Only"" and the meandering closer ""Goodnight"". When there is no melodic hook and arrangements become prototypical, all you are really left with is Lerche himself and his <i>Confessions of a Teenage Romantic</i> thing. It nearly tarnishes the stronger cuts on repeat listenings, his cutesy, dry delivery drawing further to the front, his lyricism more apparently banal and dopey. Even if a lot of<i> Heartbeat Radio </i>is affable and politely poppy, a lot of it is so pointedly bland that you can't help but wonder if the good stuff stands out only because of the beige filler around it. That, or you've let your inner-cynic get the best of you. So if it seems to be a nice enough day outside and you're not feeling particularly sinister,<i> Heartbeat Radio</i> should suffice nicely for a little while.</p></div>"|13426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13426-heartbeat-radio/|6.1|Zach Kelly

Everything they did is deeply embedded in rock's DNA, and the band's offhand and ad-hoc gestures have long been established parts of pop music mythology. And of the Beatles' albums, none-- not even <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>-- rivals <i>The Beatles</i> as a rock archetype. The phrase, ""It's like their White Album""-- applied to records like Prince's <i>Sign o' the Times</i>, Hüsker Dü's <i>Zen Arcade</i>, the Clash's <i>Sandinista!</i>, and Pavement's <i>Wowee Zowee</i>, among many others-- has long been accepted critical shorthand. To use the expression is to conjure a familiar cluster of associations: The work in question is large and sprawling, overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences, and filled with a hugely variable array of material, some of which might sound great one day and silly the next. A band's White Album is also most likely assembled under a time of great stress, often resulting in an artistic peak but one that nonetheless scatters clues to its creator's eventual demise.</p>
<p><i>The Beatles</i>, the band's complex and wide-ranging double album from 1968, is all of these things. It's a glorious and flawed mess, and its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs. People love this album not because every song is a masterpiece, but because even the throwaways have their place. Even so, for the Beatles, being all over the place was a sign of trouble. The disintegration of the group as one ""thing"" is reflected in every aspect of the record, from its recording history (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison sometimes worked in separate studios on their own songs) to its production (generally spare and tending to shapeshift from one song to the next) to the arrangements of the songs (which tend to emphasize the solo voice above all). Visual changes were also apparent. Until <i>The Beatles</i>, the group's album artwork tended to depict the band as a unit: same haircuts, same jackets, same costumes, same artist's rendering. But <i>The Beatles</i> was packaged with separate individual color photos of John, Paul, George and Ringo, and they now appear almost forebodingly distinct. All of a sudden, the Beatles neither looked nor sounded like a monolith. So soon after <i>Pepper</i> and the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967, the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p>But the backstory of <i>The Beatles</i>, while fascinating, is inessential to the album's appeal. Yes, they wrote most of it in India on acoustic guitar, while on a pilgrimage of sorts in early 1968 to see the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Some of Lennon's songs, including ""Sexy Sadie"" and ""Dear Prudence"", are based directly on the group's disillusioning experiences there. But it's the spectral, floating mood of ""Prudence"" and Lennon's playful, faintly condescending vocal in ""Sadie"" that stay with you. And while we know that Lennon's new love, Yoko Ono, was a regular presence during the session, much to the rest of the band's chagrin (McCartney has claimed that she would sometimes sit on his bass amp during a take, and he'd have to ask her to scoot over to adjust the volume), and that her influence on him led to the tape collage ""Revolution 9"", the more important detail is the final one, that the biggest pop band in the world exposed millions of fans to a really great and certainly frightening piece of avant-garde art.</p>
<p>In one sense, ""Revolution 9"" almost seems like <i>The Beatles</i> in microcosm: audacious, repetitive, silly, and intermittently dull, but also pulsing with life. If the individual Beatles hadn't been on such a songwriting roll during this time or if the album hadn't been sequenced and edited so well, <i>The Beatles</i> could easily have been an overlong slog, a <i>Let It Be</i> x2, say. But somehow, almost in spite of itself, it flows. The iffy jokes (""Rocky Raccoon"", ""The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill"", ""Piggies"") and genre exercises (Lennon's aggro ""Yer Blues"", McCartney's pre-war pop confection ""Honey Pie"") are enjoyable, even without knowing that another gem is lurking around the next corner.</p>
<p>If <i>The Beatles</i> feels more like a collection of songs by solo artists, they've also each got more going on than we'd realized. John is even more hilarious than we'd imagined, wanting nothing more than to puncture the Beatles' myth (""Glass Onion""), but he's also displaying a disconcerting willingness to deal with painful autobiography in a direct way (""Julia""). Paul's getting disarmingly soft and fluffy (""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"", ""I Will""), while simultaneously writing the roughest, rawest tunes in his Beatles oeuvre (""Back in the U.S.S.R."", ""Helter Skelter""). George is finding a better way to channel his new Eastern-influenced spiritual concerns into a rock context, while his songwriting toolkit continues to expand (""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Long Long Long""). And even Ringo Starr writes a decent song, a country &amp; western number with weirdly thick and heavy production (""Don't Pass Me By""). Listening as the tracks scroll by, there's a constant feeling of discovery.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the thing about this record is that the Beatles sound human on it. You feel like you're really getting to know them, just as they're starting to get to know themselves. Their amazing run between the latter part of 1965 through 1967 made them seem like a band apart, infallible musical geniuses always looking for another boundary to break. Here, they fail, and pretty often, too. But by allowing for that, they somehow achieve more. White Albums come when you surrender to inspiration: you're feeling so much, so intensely, that you're not sure what it all means, and you know you'll never be able to squeeze it all in.</p>

The only truly minor album in the Beatles' catalogue isn't really an album at all. <i>Yellow Submarine</i>, released in January 1969, is the soundtrack to the feature-length cartoon of the same name, a project with which the Beatles had little involvement. The idea of an animated film stretched back to 1965, but these were busy years for the band, and the project was pushed to the backburner. Once the movie finally got underway in 1967, the Beatles had no real interest in the details.</p>
<p>In one sense, the <i>Yellow Submarine</i> project is the opposite of<i> Magical Mystery Tour</i>. While the latter film was derided as pretentious and incoherent, the <i>Yellow Submarine</i> feature was well-received. And while the record releases associated with<i> Magical Mystery Tour</i> are of staggeringly high quality, the <i>Yellow Submarine</i> soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered. Brian Epstein had died in August, and with him gone, there was little motivation for the Beatles to participate in any meaningful way. So actors mimicked their voices, their input into the story consisted of a meeting or two with the filmmakers, and when it came time to assemble the soundtrack, they combed through the vault to see what was left over.</p>
<p>Of the six tracks by the Beatles on the album's first side, two, ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""All You Need Is Love"", are already familiar from their original contexts (as part of <i>Revolver</i> and as a single, respectively). The other four were holdovers from sessions in 1967 (Paul McCartney's ""All Together Now"", George Harrison's ""It's All Too Much"" and ""It's Only a Northern Song"") and 1968 (John Lennon's ""Hey Bulldog""). They never found release during the time they were recorded because, well, they weren't good enough. Granted, we're talking about a time when the Beatles were making some of the finest pop albums of all time, so the question of what constitutes ""good enough"" is relative. But even setting aside their exceedingly high standards, this lot is pretty middling, if certainly still enjoyable.</p>
<p>Neither of Harrison's songs ranks with his best. ""Only a Northern Song"" and ""It's All Too Much"" are filled with swirling psychedelic production-- tooting horns, backward instruments, shimmering percussion-- but beneath the din there's not much else interesting going on. ""Only a Northern Song"" at least has a good joke going for it, simultaneously alluding to the North of England and the Beatles' Lennon-McCartney-dominated publishing company (i.e., no matter what Harrison wrote for this particular number, it belonged to Northern Songs, Ltd.). But ""It's All Too Much"" stretches on for an endless six and a half minutes, the constipated production in fruitless search of a tune. For McCartney's part, ""All Together Now"" is a cheery and pleasant sing-along befitting an animated soundtrack, and Lennon's ""Hey Bulldog"" is a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, by a good margin the best song here. They might be second-rate Beatles songs, but still.</p>
<p>To round out the album, the second side of <i>Yellow Submarine</i> is filled with George Martin's score for the film. Pieces like ""Pepperland"", ""Sea of Holes"", and ""March of the Meanies"", however they were received at the time, function now primarily as garish kitsch, lushly orchestrated orchestral music that could have come from anywhere. Personally, I can enjoy this stuff when I'm in the mood. The blandly anonymous but beautifully recorded swoop of strings, self-consciously ""exotic"" percussion, and recurring thematic motifs serve as an intriguing sort of time capsule of a time when light ""beautiful music"" still commanded the ears of a sizeable listening pubic. But it's very easy to forget that the music has anything to do with the Beatles, or even popular music of the last 50 years, at least until the ""Yellow Submarine"" melody returns in ""Yellow Submarine in Pepperland"". As a souvenir of the film, <i>Yellow Submarine</i> has its place, and in fairness, it was never intended as a major release. But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise.</p>

They were hoping to bounce back after the serious downer that had been the Get Back sessions, which, months after they wrapped, had yet to yield an album anyone was happy with. But what ""like we used to"" meant, exactly, was rather hard to pin down: The Beatles' life as a band was so compressed, with such a massive amount of music and change packed into a short time, that there was never a single moment that could be used as a reference point for what a Beatles record was supposed to be. So when they returned to the EMI studios on Abbey Road in summer 1969, it wasn't clear how it would go. They still weren't getting along; their musical interests continued to diverge; John Lennon didn't really want to continue with the Beatles; Paul McCartney did, but on his own terms, which meant that he set the pace and got what he wanted. Though it was unspoken, they all had a good idea that this could really be the end. So what now? One more, then.</p>
<p>And what a finish. The Beatles' story is so enduring in part because it was wrapped up so perfectly. <i>Abbey Road</i> shows a band still clearly in its prime, capable of songwriting and recording feats other groups could only envy. Working for the first time exclusively on an eight-track tape machine, their mastery of the studio was undeniable, and <i>Abbey Road</i> still sounds fresh and exciting 40 years on (indeed, of the 2009 remasters, the improvements and sonic detail here are the most striking). Even if it's ultimately the Paul McCartney and George Martin show, as demonstrated on the famous second-side medley, everyone brought his A-game. Where <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> strained for significance, <i>The Beatles</i> was schizophrenic, and <i>Let It Be</i> was a drag streaked with greatness, <i>Abbey Road</i> lays out its terms precisely and meets them all. There's not a duff note on the damn thing.</p>
<p>This applies even if, like me, you've never quite understood the attraction of John Lennon's ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and sometimes find yourself skipping ahead to George Harrison's second-side lead-off ""Here Comes the Sun"". ""I Want You"" is certainly a singular item in the Beatles discography, with its extreme repetition, stark simplicity, and epic three-minute coda, but it requires a certain kind of mood to appreciate. Yet, along with album-opener ""Come Together"", it also shows how Lennon finally found a way to square his latter-day interest in leaner and edgier rock'n'roll with trippy studio experimentation. Lennon's two big songs on the first side are raw, direct, and biting, but they're also lush studio creations, in keeping with the spirit of the album. And the sophisticated sheen laid over top has the effect of making them seem more like ""Beatles songs"" compared to, say, Lennon's White Album output. <i>Abbey Road</i> feels like one thing.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney's ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" and Ringo Starr's ""Octopus's Garden"", two silly, charming, childlike songs in a long tradition of silly, charming, childlike Beatles songs, round out side one. But then, oh: side two. The suite that runs from ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" through ""Her Majesty"" finds the Beatles signing off in grand fashion. Gathering scraps of material that had piled up, McCartney and Martin pieced together a song cycle bursting with light and optimism, and this glorious stretch of music seems to singlehandedly do away with the bad vibes that had accumulated over the previous two years. From the atmospheric rip of Fleetwood Mac's ""Albatross"" that is ""Sun King"" to the sharp pair of Lennon fragments, ""Mean Mr. Mustard"" and ""Polythene Pam"" (the former given a line about ""sister Pam"" to join the pieces), and on through the explosive, one-climax-after-another run of ""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window"", ""Golden Slumbers"", and ""Carry That Weight"", the nine fragments in 16 minutes add up to so much more than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>The music is tempered with uncertainly and longing, suggestive of adventure, reflecting a sort of vague wisdom; it's wistful, earnest music that also feels deep, even though it really isn't. But above all it just feels happy and joyous, an explosion of warm feeling rendered in sound. And then, the perfect capper, finishing with a song called ""The End"", which features alternating guitar solos from John, George, and Paul and a drum solo from Ringo. It was an ideal curtain call from a band that just a few years earlier had been a bunch of punk kids from a nowheresville called Liverpool with more confidence than skill. This is how you finish a career.</p>
<p>The Beatles' run in the 1960s is good fodder for thought experiments. For example, <i>Abbey Road</i> came out in late September 1969. Though <i>Let It Be</i> was then still unreleased, the Beatles wouldn't record another album together. But they were still young men: George was 26 years old, Paul was 27, John was 28, and Ringo was 29. The Beatles' first album, <i>Please Please Me</i>, had come out almost exactly six and a half years earlier. So if <i>Abbey Road</i> had been released today, <i>Please Please Me</i> would date to March 2003. So think about that for a sec: Twelve studio albums and a couple of dozen singles, with a sound that went from earnest interpreters of Everly Brothers and Motown hits to mind-bending sonic explorers and with so many detours along the way-- all of it happened in that brief stretch of time. That's a weight to carry.</p>

The symmetry was perfect: youthful energy, optimism, and camaraderie had given over to cynicism, discord, and looking out for number one. As the decade's final year began, the White Album was still riding high on the charts and the <i>Yellow Submarine</i> soundtrack was days away from release. But the Beatles were in serious trouble. Nothing about being in the band was enjoyable or easy. The power vacuum left by the death of manager Brian Epstein a year and a half earlier had never been satisfactorily filled; Apple Corps, the multi-media company started by the band a year earlier, was bleeding money; and toughest of all, the once-Fab Four didn't generally enjoy being in the same room together. All were either married or close to it, closing in on 30, and tremendously weary of all they'd been through.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney, the most devoted of the gang to the notion of the Beatles (Ringo Starr called him the ""Beatleaholic""), thought that the group needed a special project to bring it together. Another White Album-style scenario, with the songwriters in the band working alone in separate studios, enlisting each other to serve as a de facto backup band, was bound to fail. Too much good will and trust had been lost. They needed something big they could all submit to. Several ideas were proposed, most involving a return of some kind to live performance: perhaps a live album of new songs or a huge show in a remote place; maybe the band would charter an ocean liner and make an album on it. Ultimately, it was decided that the band would be filmed on a soundstage rehearsing for a show and developing material for a new album-- a document of the Beatles at work. The theme for the project would be back-to-basics, a return of the group as a performing unit, sans overdubs, emphasizing their inherent musicality. Working title: <i>Get Back</i>.</p>
<p>It was an awful idea. First, no one was sure exactly what he was supposed to be doing. Glyn Johns was there, a new presence behind the boards, but he never quite figured out if he was producing or just engineering. Regular producer George Martin was technically on board, but his participation was minimal. While <i>Let It Be</i> was initially meant to be a return to simplicity, Phil Spector's later involvement (he was brought in to ""reproduce"" the tracks, adding extra voices and instruments to thicken arrangements and remix the record, a decision made without McCartney's input) killed that angle.</p>
<p>Organizational chaos aside, the sessions were painful. We all know what it feels like to be around people we don't like for days on end; if reality television has taught us anything, it's that a camera crew in a room full of such people does nothing to ease tension. The time the Beatles spent recording and filming was described by all as supremely unpleasant, despite a later uptick when they'd returned to finish up at Abbey Road. And when they finished, no one really liked what they'd laid down on tape. So not surprisingly, the essential nature of <i>Let It Be</i> is that it feels incomplete and fragmented; it's a difficult album to peg because the Beatles were never sure themselves what they wanted it to be. So the best way to approach it is as a collection of songs by guys who still were churning out classics with some regularity. It may not succeed on the level of the Beatles' previous albums, but there's enough good material to make it a worthy entry in their canon.</p>
<p>Outside of the title track, there's little here that feels consequential to the Beatles' legacy. The easy acoustic shuffle of the John Lennon and Paul McCartney duet ""Two of Us"" has appeal, though, as do the prickly rhythmic drive of George Harrison's ""For You Blue"" and the bubbling Booker T-isms of McCartney's ""Get Back"". The swampy ""I've Got a Feeling"", possibly reflecting McCartney's recent interest in Canned Heat, is intriguing because it sounds so classic rock 70s. And Lennon's ""Across the Universe"", recorded during the White Album sessions and sounding like it was beamed in from somewhere else, has a certain ringing brilliance. For balance, there's ""Dig a Pony"" and the boogieing ""One After 909"", the latter actually written by Lennon and McCartney as kids in the fifties. Still, for plenty of good bands, the best of these would be career highlights.</p>
<p>Recorded without joy, set aside for months while a better album was assembled, and finally remixed in a way that enraged one of the band's principals, <i>Let It Be</i> finally saw release in May 1970. But by that point, the Beatles break-up had been official for several weeks. There's since been a live album, compilations, digitization, trolls through the archives, and an ocean of ink spilled about this little band that made it very big. And now there are these CD issues, done beautifully. But there never was a proper reunion, and we can assume that there will never be another Beatles.</p>

Originally released  as two separate discs in 1988, it's a catchall for  all the stuff the Beatles officially released during their existence  that wasn't intended for their albums (and didn't end up on the after-the-fact  album <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i>). It's slapped together chronologically,  so it begins with an unprepossessing alternate take of ""Love Me  Do"" and ends with the ludicrous doodle ""You Know My Name (Look  Up the Number)"". And, between them, it includes some of the best  pop songs ever recorded-- scratch that: some of the best pop <i>singles</i> ever recorded.</p>
<p>It can be hard to grasp the  way it used to work if you've grown up with the basic unit of pop music  as the album or the individual song, but the model the Beatles grew  up with-- and arguably broke-- was the 45 RPM single: two songs sold together,  one of them aspiring to popular success and the other one a sort of  lagniappe. They treated their own singles not just as hit-plus-filler  but as an often-complementary pair: the massive humanist crescendo of ""Hey Jude""  paired with the corrective political fireball of ""Revolution"",  the frantic urgency of ""Paperback Writer"" paired with the  dreamy involution of ""Rain"", John Lennon's bitter, betrayed ""Day  Tripper"" paired with Paul McCartney's hopeful, clear-eyed ""We Can Work  It Out"".</p>
<p>For that matter, their singles  weren't simply teasers for an album: Of the 22 singles (and two EPs) the  Beatles released in the UK between 1962 and 1970, more than half weren't  initially part of a bigger unit. Their first non-album single, ""From  Me to You"", came out all of three weeks after <i>Please Please  Me</i>; ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" emerged a week after <i> With the Beatles</i>. ""Day Tripper""/""We Can Work It Out""  was actually released-- as a double A-side-- the same day as <i>Rubber  Soul</i>, on which neither side appeared. By that point, they were basically  just showing off.</p>
<p>Most of the first disc of <i> Past Masters</i> is the product the Beatles were being pushed to crank  out over the first three years of their recording career: The three-covers-and-a-leftover <i> Long Tall Sally</i> EP, German recordings of a couple of hits, a version  of Larry Williams' ""Bad Boy"" that filled out an American LP.  It also features the two phenomenal, headlong late 1963 singles that  transformed them from a perfectly nice Liverpool band to The Goddamn  Beatles: ""She Loves You"" and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".  It's a testament to the Beatles' gamechanging originality that the  opportunistic American bands who tried to make a few bucks by covering  those songs over the following few months couldn't even play them right-- the  harmonies of ""She Loves You"" and the delicious rhythmic trick  that introduces ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" flummoxed every  one of them.</p>
<p>The astonishing stuff continues  on the second disc: seven A-side/B-side pairs, plus an alternate version  of John's devotional ""Across the Universe"". ""Paperback  Writer""/""Rain"" was the single where they moved away from  their great subject of love, and where Ringo Starr perfected his uncanny  ability to shift the beat just enough that the band seemed to be hovering  a few inches above the ground. George Harrison's ""The Inner Light""-- a  spaced-out setting from the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, on which he's backed up by  Indian musicians-- is a momentum-killer in the context of an album (as  it is here), but it made sense as part of a yin-and-yang pair with Paul's  earthy Fats Domino homage ""Lady Madonna"".</p>
<p>""The Ballad of John and  Yoko"", rushed out seven weeks after ""Get Back"", looked  like a colossal act of vanity on its surface-- John messing with the  Lennon/McCartney copyright juggernaut by reporting so literally on what  he'd been up to for the past couple of months that the result was basically  impossible to cover, and getting Paul into the studio to bang it out  with him, even though Ringo and George were due back in town just a  few days later. It's a triumph, anyway. As usual with their singles,  there's something new and ear-catching jumping out of the speakers every  few seconds (the shaker that doubles the rhythm right after the bridge,  Paul's improvised-sounding last-word-of-each-line harmonies, John singing  ""Gibraltar near Spain"" at a moment when that was a political  assertion), and honestly Lennon <i>had</i> been having a pretty interesting  spring.</p>
<p>And then there's their biggest-selling  single and deepest pairing of songs, ""Hey Jude""/""Revolution"". McCartney is singing about Lennon's son, Lennon is shouting about the  system and culture about which they're embedded; ""Jude"" wraps  its arms around the world and gets everyone to join in its mantra, ""Revolution""  pushes the idiots away with the nastiest noise the Beatles had ever  made. It was also the first release on the Beatles' own label, Apple  Records-- or, rather, one of two singles that came out the same day.  (The other was Mary Hopkin's ""Those Were the Days"", which  knocked it off the top of the British charts after a couple of weeks.)  As a seven-minute song on an album of three-minute songs, ""Hey  Jude"" inevitably overpowers its context; as a free-floating sound  file without ""Revolution"", it's missing the sting that tempers  its sweetness. But if you find yourself taking advantage of the reissue-and-""Rock Band"" frenzy to sit down and really <i>listen</i> to the magnificent recordings  that have spent the last four decades or so as inescapable background  music, remember the way much of these two discs were meant to be heard and understood:  two by two.</p>

But it's arguably the most important artistic leap in the Beatles' career-- the signpost that signaled a shift away from Beatlemania and the heavy demands of teen pop, toward more introspective, adult subject matter. It's also the record that started them on their path toward the valuation of creating studio records over live performance. If nothing else, it's the record on which their desire for artistic rather than commercial ambition took center stage-- a radical idea at a time when the success of popular music was measured in sales and quantity rather than quality.</p>
<p>Indeed, at the time the Beatles did need a new direction: Odd as it seems today, the lifespan of a pop band's career in the early 60s could often be measured in months, sometimes in years, rarely in three-year increments. And by 1965, the Beatles were in danger of seeming lightweight compared to their new peers: The Who's sloganeering, confrontational singles were far more ferocious; the Rolling Stones' ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" was a much more raucous, anti-ennui cry than the Beatles' ""Help!""; and the Kinks beat the Beatles to both satirical, character songs and the influence of Indian music. By comparison, most of the Beatles music to date was either rock'n'roll covers or originals offering a (mostly) wholesome, positive take on boy-girl relationships.</p>
<p>Above all, Bob Dylan's lyrical acumen and the Byrds' confident, jangly guitar were primary influences on John Lennon and George Harrison, respectively (and the Byrds had been influenced by the Beatles, too-- Roger McGuinn first picked up a Rickenbacker 12-string after seeing <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>). Dylan and the Byrds' fingerprints had been left on <i>Help!</i>-- Lennon, the group's biggest Dylan acolyte, played an acoustic rather than electric guitar throughout most of that record. Even Paul McCartney's ""Yesterday"" found him strumming an acoustic. (All this at a time when Dylan was beginning to move in the other direction and fully enter his electric period.) Harrison was growing more serious on the political ""Think for Yourself"", while ""If I Needed Someone""-- his other contribution to <i>Rubber Soul</i>-- is practically a Byrds pastiche and his chiming, sure-footed solo on ""Nowhere Man"" also displays a debt to that band. His deft touch is all over the record in subtle ways-- appropriate for an album full of finesse and small wonders (the ping at the end of the ""Nowhere Man"" solo, Lennon's exhalation in the chorus of ""Girl"", the ""tit-tit-tit"" of the backing vocalists in the same song, the burbling guitar in ""Michelle"").</p>
<p>The most lasting influences of Dylan and the Byrds on the Beatles, however, were likely their roles in introducing the group to recreational drugs: Dylan shepherded the quartet through their first experience with pot, while the Byrds were with three-fourths of the Beatles when they first purposefully took LSD. (McCartney sat that one out, avoiding the drug for another year, while Harrison and Lennon had each had a previous accidental dosage.)</p>
<p>Marijuana's effect on the group is most heavily audible on <i>Rubber Soul</i>. (By the time of their next album, <i>Revolver</i>, three-fourths of the group had been turned on to LSD, and their music was headed somewhere else entirely.) With its patient pace and languid tones, <i>Rubber Soul</i> is an altogether much more mellow record than anything the Beatles had done before, or would do again. It's a fitting product from a quartet just beginning to explore their inner selves on record.</p>
<p>Lennon, in particular, continued his more introspective and often critical songwriting, penning songs of romance gone wrong or personal doubt and taking a major step forward as a lyricist. Besting his self-critical ""I'm a Loser"" with ""Nowhere Man"" was an accomplishment, and the faraway, dreamy ""Girl"" was arguably his most musically mature song to date. Lennon's strides were most evident, however, on ""Norwegian Wood"", an economical and ambiguous story-song highlighted by Harrison's first dabbling with the Indian sitar, and the mature, almost fatalistic heart-tug of ""In My Life"", which displayed a remarkably calm and peaceful attitude toward not only one's past and present, but their future and the inevitability of death.</p>
<p>Considering Harrison's contributions and Lennon's sharp growth, McCartney-- fresh from the success of ""Yesterday""-- oddly comes off third-string on <i>Rubber Soul</i>. His most lasting contributions-- the Gallic ""Michelle"" (which began life as a piss-take, and went on to inspire the Teutonic swing and sway of Lennon's ""Girl""), the gentle rocker ""I'm Looking Through You"", and the grinning ""Drive My Car"" are relatively minor compared to Lennon's masterstrokes. McCartney did join his bandmate in embracing relationship songs about miscommunication, not seeing eye-to-eye, and heartbreak, but it wouldn't be until 1966 that he took his next great artistic leap, doing so as both a storyteller and, even more so, a composer.</p>

The group's competitive drive had them, at times, working to match or best Bob Dylan or Brian Wilson; their drug use greatly colored the musical outlook of John Lennon and George Harrison in particular; and the death of former manager Brian Epstein ushered in a period of distracting and poor business choices and opened the door for individuals such as the celebrity guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Yoko Ono, and businessman Allen Klein to penetrate, alter, and, some would say, disintegrate their inner circle.</p>
<p>The most important of these external shifts in the Beatles narrative, however, was a series of changes that allowed them to morph into a studio band. The chain of events that ushered in the band's changing approach to studio music began before <i>Rubber Soul</i>, but the results didn't come into full fruition until <i>Revolver</i>, a 35-minute LP that took 300 hours of studio time to create-- roughly three times the amount allotted to <i>Rubber Soul</i>, and an astronomical amount for a record in 1966.</p>
<p>Longtime Beatles producer George Martin, justifiably upset that EMI refused to give him a raise on the back of his extraordinarily profitable work with the Beatles, quit his post with the label in August 1965. Martin used his clout to create his own company, and the group and producer used theirs to effectively camp out at Abbey Road Studios for whatever length of time suited them rather than being forced to comply to the rigid and economically sound schedules demanded by labels at the time. The Beatles could now work both in and out of the studio, taking full advantage of new advancements in sound recording that allowed them to reflect upon and tinker with their work, explore new instruments and studio trickery, and refine their music by solving problems when they arose.</p>
<p>This new approach not only greatly altered their work environment, but drove the Beatles to value the flexibility of emerging technology. They also cashed in some of their commercial capital to abandon the mentally and physically sapping practice of touring-- and the glad-handing and public relations requirements that went with it. Exceptionalism became the watchword for the band, and it responded by using its freedom to push forward its art and, by extension, the whole of pop music. Musically, then, the Beatles began to craft dense, experimental works; lyrically, they matched that ambition, maturing pop from the stuff of teen dreams to a more serious pursuit that actively reflected and shaped the times in which its creators lived.</p>
<p><i>Revolver</i> was also the first record in which the impression of the Beatles as a holistic gang was disrupted. The group had taken three months off prior to <i>Revolver</i>-- easily its longest break since the start of its recording career-- and each band member went his own separate way after years of moving around the world as a unit. Even without the break, it's possible that the group would continue to explore individual concerns: After starting to do just that on <i>Rubber Soul</i>, it was only natural that the Beatles wished to continue to highlight their individual strengths on its follow-up, and they did by listing each song's lead singer on the record sleeve.</p>
<p>The first, surprisingly, was George Harrison, who kicks off the record with another stab at politics on ""Taxman"", and then later offers philosophical musings on ""I Want to Tell You"" and the Indian-flavored ""Love You To"". Over the next year or two, Harrison's guitar played a more background role in the group's recordings-- fortuitously, then, that time also corresponded with the years in which the Beatles were pleased to bunker down in the studio and most explore the dynamic tension between their individual interests and their final stretch of camaraderie and mutual respect.</p>
<p>Lennon's primary interest throughout much of this time was himself, something that continued throughout his career-- he was always suspicious, even dismissive, of Paul McCartney's character songs, but once he and Yoko Ono joined forces, her Fluxus-rooted belief in art-as-subjectivity became orthodoxy in his mind. Lennon's early explorations of self and mind that began on <i>Rubber Soul</i> continued on <i>Revolver</i>, as the suburbanite spent much of his time at home indulging his zest for the exploratory powers of LSD. He contributes five songs to <i>Revolver</i>, and, indeed, each is concerned with drugs, the creative mind, a suspicion of the outside world, or all three.</p>
<p>Each is also uniformly wonderful, and together they provide a tapestry of Lennon's burgeoning art-pop, which, along with Martin's inventive arrangements and playful effects, would peak the next year with the triumphs of ""I Am the Walrus"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", and ""A Day in the Life"". The gauzy ""I'm Only Sleeping"" and rollicking 1-2 of ""She Said She Said"" and ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" aren't nearly as demonstrative as the songs he'd write in their wake-- as a result each remains oddly underrated-- but they function as some of Lennon's most purely satisfying pop songs.</p>
<p>""Tomorrow Never Knows"" is another thing entirely. While ""Doctor Robert"" or ""She Said She Said"" touched on drug culture playfully or privately, ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" was a full-on attempt to recreate the immersive experience of LSD-- complete with lyrics borrowed from Timothy Leary's <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead-</i>inspired writings. Remarkably, though, much of it due to Martin's experimental production, tape loops, and musique concrète-inspired backdrop, the song is lively and giddy instead of self-serious or preachy. Even Martin's primitive psychedelia could have been thudding and ponderous, and yet more than four decades later the entire thing seems less a clear product of its time than not only most art or experimental rock, but most Beatles records as well.</p>
<p>Despite that triumph, however, <i>Revolver</i> was McCartney's maturation record as much as <i>Rubber Soul</i> was for Lennon. While Harrison was learning at the feet of sitar master Ravi Shankar and Lennon was navigating heavy use of psychotropic drugs, McCartney was refining his compositional chops by exploring classical music, training an eye for detail and subtlety in his lyrics, and embracing the orchestral work of Brian Wilson.</p>
<p>McCartney's optimism and populism resulted in the most demonstrative songs he created for <i>Revolver</i>-- the brassy ""Good Day Sunshine"" (which delightfully toes the line between schmaltz and heartwarming) and ""Got to Get You Into My Life"", and the children's music staple ""Yellow Submarine"", an inventive and charming track too often derided as camp. (It's also an early indication that it would be McCartney who would hold tightest to the impression of the group as a unit-- the image of the band all living together here was, for the first time in years, untrue.)</p>
<p>The understated qualities of McCartney's lyrics began to be misconstrued as simplistic in his ballads, but he provides three of his best here: ""For No One"", all the more affecting because it's slight and difficult to grasp, ""Here, There and Everywhere"", a model of sepia-toned sentimentality, and ""Eleanor Rigby"", which in its own way was as groundbreaking and revolutionary as ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". Virtually a short story set to music, ""Rigby"" and its interwoven descriptions of lonely people was and is a desolate and altogether mature setting for a pop song.</p>
<p><i>Revolver</i> in the end is the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence. The Beatles had been transformed into a group not beholden to the expectations of their label or bosses, but fully calling the shots-- recording at their own pace, releasing records at a less-demanding clip, abandoning the showmanship of live performance. Lesser talents or a less-motivated group of people may have shrunk from the challenge, but here the Beatles took upon the task of redefining what was expected from popular music. Lest we forget it, the original flashpoint of Beatlemania remains the most influential and revolutionary period in the Beatles career, but the creative high points of 1966-67 aren't far behind. It's worth remembering as well that what had been demanded or expected from them as entertainers and popular musicians was something they'd challenged from their first cheeky, flippant interview, but just a few years later they were no longer mere anomalies within the world of pop, no longer potential fads; they were avatars for a transformative cultural movement.</p>

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|546.0|The Beatles|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|1.0|['EMI']|2009-09-09 00:00:00|1967|2016-06-11 18:58:31.909929|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".j7yuym9udc.1.6:0.1.0.$13435/=1$13435.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Finally free of touring, the Beatles next sought to be free of themselves, hitting on the rather daft concept of recording as an alias band. The idea held for all of two songs, one coda, and one album sleeve, but was retained as the central organizing and marketing feature of the band's 1967 album <i>Sgt. Pepper'</i><i>s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>. Hailed on its release as proof that popular music could be as rich an artistic pursuit as more high-minded media such as jazz and classical, the record's reputation and sense of ambition ushered in the album era. Its influence was so pervasive and so instructional regarding the way music is crafted and sold to the public that this is still the predominant means of organizing, distributing, and promoting new music four decades later, well after the decline of physical media.</p>
<p>The concept, of course, is that the record was to be recorded by the titular fictional band, a washed-up rock'n'roll group on the comeback trail. (This was actually the second concept earmarked for the Beatles' next LP; the original, a record of songs about Liverpool, was abandoned when its first two tracks were needed for the group's next single, ""Strawberry Fields Forever""/ ""Penny Lane"".) Probably for the best, little of the fictional-band vision for the record made it through; what did last from that conceit are a few tangential ideas-- a satirical bent on popular entertainment and a curiosity with nostalgia and the past.</p>
<p>The record opens with a phony live performance by the Lonely Hearts Band, a sort of Vegas act-- the sort of thing that, in 1963, people thought the almost certainly soon-to-be-passé Beatles would be doing themselves in 1967. Instead, the Beatles had completed their shattering of the rules of light entertainment, even halting their own live performances, which they'd never again do together for a paid audience.</p>
<p>Even as they mocked this old version of a performing band, ironically <i>Sgt. Pepper'</i><i>s</i> and its ambitions helped to codify the rock band as artists rather than popular entertainers. In the hands of their followers, the notion of a pop group as a compact, independent entity, responsible for writing, arranging, and performing its own material would be manifested in the opposite way-- rather than holing up in the studio and focusing on records, bands were meant to prove in the flesh they could ""bring it"" live. Notions of authenticity and transparency would become valued over studio output. (To be fair, upstart bands had to gig in order to get attention and a reputation, while the Beatles, of course, could write, break, and rewrite their own rules; they had the luxury and freedom to take advantage of a changing entertainment world and could experiment with different, emerging models of how to function as a rock band in much the same way that Trent Reznor or Radiohead can today.)</p>
<p>The freedom from live performance didn't necessitate that Beatles songs now sounded practiced or rehearsed, and indeed they weren't. Instead, they were studio creations assembled in sections and pieces. As the band splintered, this practice would spill over into releasing song sketches on the White Album and inspire, in part through necessity, the lengthy song cycle at the close of <i>Abbey Road</i>. On <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>, the most rewarding manifestation of this shift was the record's most forward-looking piece, ""A Day in the Life"". Complex in construction and epic in feel, ""A Day in the Life"" nevertheless seems enveloping and breezy to listeners. Indeed, the sustained, closing ringing chord of the song comes a mere 4:20 into the track.</p>
<p>""A Day""'s only best-in-show competitor was McCartney's ""She's Leaving Home"". (As on <i>Revolver</i>, the peaks here were a mold-breaking closer and classically inspired story-song). ""A Day in the Life"" has only grown in estimation, rightfully becoming one of the most acclaimed Beatles tracks. ""She's Leaving Home"", by contrast, has slid from view-- perhaps too maudlin to work on classic rock radio and too MOR for hipster embrace, it was nevertheless the other headline track on <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>'<i>s</i> when it was released. The story of a runaway teen, it misses as a defiant generational statement in part because it's actually sympathetic to the parents in the song. In the second verse, McCartney defies expectations by not following the young girl on her adventure but keeping the track set in the home as her parents wake to find her goodbye letter.</p>
<p>In the end, we learn ""She"" left home for ""fun""-- a rather churlish reason, and when paired with McCartney's simplistic sentiments in ""When I'm 64"" (the aging couple there will be happy to ""scrimp and save""), the young girl seems more selfish than trapped. In fact, for a group whose every move was a generational wedge, and for such a modern record, the Beatles' <i>Sgt. Pepper'</i><i>s</i> is oddly conservative in places: ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" takes inspiration from a Victorian-era carnival; ""When I'm 64"" is a music-hall parody that fantasizes about what it would be like to be the Beatles' grandparents' age; ""Fixing a Hole"" has a rather mundane domestic setting; the fantasy girl in ""Lovely Rita"" is a cop.</p>
<p>Lyrically, it's an atypical way to usher in the Summer of Love, but musically, the record is wildly inventive, built on double-tracking, tape effects, and studio technology. The dream-like haze of ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", the fairground, sawdust feel of ""Mr. Kite"", and the cavalcade of sound effects at the end of ""Good Morning Good Morning"" were the most demonstrative sounds on the record, but otherwise benign passages were also steeped in innovation, whether recording from the inside of a brass instrument or plugging instruments directly into the sound board instead of capturing them through mics.</p>
<p>Almost everything done on <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i> turned out to be new and forward-thinking, from the iconic record sleeve to the totemic ending to ""A Day in the Life"". There are very few moments in pop music history in which you can mark a clear before and after, in which almost everything changed. In the UK, it's arguably happened only five times, and on just four instances in the U.S. (<i>Thriller</i> here; acid house and punk there, and Elvis everywhere, of course); in both nations, the Beatles launched two of those moments.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it almost seems like this time the band itself was taken aback by its own accomplishments, not only shying from directly living up to <i>Revolver</i> via the smoke and mirrors of the Lonely Hearts Club Band but then never again throwing themselves into their work as a collective unit. <i>Sgt. Pepper'</i><i>s</i>, possibly as a corrective to the hushed tones with which it's been received for decades, has slipped in estimation behind a few of the band's other records, but it's easy to hear how it achieved that reputation in the first place. Even if John, Paul, George, and Ringo would arguably go on to best a handful of its moments, the amazing stretch of music created in 1966-67 was the peak of the Beatles as a working band.</p>

Conceived as a low-key art project, the Beatles were oddly nonchalant about the challenges of putting together a movie. They'd assembled records, they'd worked on <i>A Hard Day's Night </i>and <i>Help!</i>-- how hard could it be? Without Epstein to advise, however, things like budgeting and time management became a challenge, and this understated experimental film turned into a sapping distraction.</p>
<p>Musically, however, the accompanying EP was an overwhelming success. The EP format apparently freed the band to experiment a bit, not having to fill sides of a 45 with pop songs or make the grand statements of an album. The title track is a rousing set piece, meant to introduce the travelogue concept of the film. The remaining four songs released exclusive to the EP are low-key marvels-- Paul McCartney's graceful ""The Fool on the Hill"" and music-hall throwback ""Your Mother Should Know"", George Harrison's droning ""Blue Jay Way"", and the percolating instrumental ""Flying"". Few of them are anyone's all-time favorite Beatles songs, only one had a prayer of being played on the radio, and yet this run seems to achieve a majesty in part because of that: It's a rare stretch of amazing Beatles music that can seem like a private obsession rather than a permanent part of our shared culture.</p>
<p>As a more laid-back release, the EP suggested the direction the band might have taken on the White Album had it remained a full band, happy to shed the outsized conceptualism and big statements and craft atmospheric, evocative pieces. In the U.S., the EP was paired with three recent double-sided singles, ballooning <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> into an album-- the only instance in which a U.S. release, often mangled by Capitol, became Beatles canon. With only the EP's title track married specifically to the film's themes, the overall effect of a title track/album sleeve as shell game was in line with <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>'<i>s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>.</p>
<p>Of the three singles, the undisputed highlight is ""Strawberry Fields Forever""/ ""Penny Lane"", John Lennon and Paul McCartney's tributes to their hometown, Liverpool. Slyly surreal, assisted by studio experimentation but not in debt to it, full of brass, harmonium, and strings, unmistakably English-- when critics call eccentric or baroque UK pop bands ""Beatlesesque,"" this is the closest there is to a root for that adjective. There is no definitive Beatles sound, of course, but with a band that now functions as much as a common, multi-generational language as a group of musicians, it's no surprise that songs rooted in childhood-- the one experience most likely to seem shared and have common touchpoints-- are among their most universally beloved.</p>
<p>The rest of the singles collected here are no less familiar: Lennon's ""All You Need Is Love"" was initially completed up for an international TV special on BBC1-- its basic message was meant to translate to any language. Harrison's guitar solo, producer George Martin's strings, and the parade of intertextual musical references that start and close the piece elevate it above hippie hymn. Its flipside, ""Baby You're a Rich Man"", is less successful, a second-rate take on John Lennon's money-isn't-everything theme from the considerably stronger ""And Your Bird Can Sing"". It's the one lesser moment on an otherwise massively rewarding compilation.</p>
<p>Much better from Lennon is ""I Am the Walrus"", crafted for the <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> film and EP but also released as a double-sided single with McCartney's ""Hello Goodbye"". One of Lennon's signature songs, ""Walrus"" channels the singer's longtime fascinations with Lewis Carroll, puns and turns of phrase, and non sequiturs. ""Hello Goodbye"" echoes the same contradictory logic found in the verses of ""All You Need Is Love"", a vague sense of disorientation that still does little to balance its relentlessly upbeat tone. McCartney excelled at selling simplistic lyrics that risk seeming cloying, though, and he again does here-- plus, the kaleidoscopic, carnival-ride melody and interplay between lead and backing vocals ensure it's a much better record than it is a song.</p>
<p>In almost every instance on those singles, the Beatles are either whimsical or borderline simplistic, releasing songs that don't seem sophisticated or heavy or monumental (even though most of them are). In that sense, they're all like ""All You Need Is Love"" or childhood memories or Lewis Carroll-- easy to love, fit for all ages, rich in multi-textual details, deceptively trippy (see Paul's ""Penny Lane"" in particular, with images of it raining despite blue skies, or the songs here that revel in contradictions-- ""Hello Goodbye""'s title, the verses in ""All You Need Is Love""). More than any other place in the band's catalogue, this is where the group seems to crack open a unique world, and for many young kids then and since this was their introduction to music as imagination, or adventure. The rest of the <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> LP is the opposite of the middle four tracks on the EP-- songs so universal that, like ""Yellow Submarine"", they are practically implanted in your brain from birth. Seemingly innocent, completely soaked through with humor and fantasy, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> slots in my mind almost closer to the original <i>Willy Wonka</i> or <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> as it does other Beatles records or even other music-- timeless entertainment crafted with a childlike curiosity and appeal but filled with wit and wonder.</p>
<p>On the whole, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> is quietly one of the most rewarding listens in the Beatles' career. True, it doesn't represent some sort of forward momentum or clear new idea-- largely in part because it wasn't conceived as an album. The accompanying pieces on the EP are anomalies in the Beatles oeuvre but they aren't statements per se, or indications that the group is in any sort of transition. But if there was ever a moment in the Beatles' lifetime that listeners would have been happy to have the group just settle in and release songs as soon as possible, it was just before and after the then-interminable 10-month gap between the <i>Revolver</i> and <i>Sgt. Pepper'</i><i>s</i>. Without that context, the results could seem slight-- a sort-of canonized version of <i>Past Masters</i> perhaps-- but whether it's an album, a collection of separate pieces, or whatnot matters little when the music itself is so incredible.</p>

club, covering Chuck Berry for hours at a stretch.<span> G</span>irls screamed, and the band got bigger and bigger 'til it stormed the world (specifically, America).<span> </span>Tours and celebrity and more screaming girls followed, until suddenly the world was a drag-- and they ascended a magic escalator to the sky, where they rode the giant elephant god Ganesha up to the edge of the creation.<span> </span>They became saints, or gods, or something just as sacred, and on a tablet it was written: ""You don't mess with the Beatles.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That was Harmonix's mantra going into the project.<span> </span>The developers knew if they were going to handle one of the biggest properties in popular culture, they would take excruciating care to make it loyal, even worshipful.<span> </span>The visual design is warm and adoring, and each Beatle looks gentle and kind-- especially John Lennon, who's so beatific you almost forget that George Harrison has died, too.<span> </span>And the Beatles dominate the game. <span> </span>They're the only people on the virtual stage: Eric Clapton never plays guitar and Billy Preston and Yoko Ono are expunged.<span> </span>More importantly, the Beatles ignore <i>you</i>.<span> </span>Every song is shown with period dress and setting: You can't play ""Helter Skelter"" in the Cavern in Liverpool or ""Boys"" at their 1969 rooftop concert.<span> </span>When you screw up, the screen just fades to black.<span> </span>In the first few clubs, the camera regularly cuts to those girls in the audience, screaming, in love.<span> </span>But they're not screaming for you.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">You, the player, are the disciple. You're here to study the music: To play as fast and loud as the band did in its youth, to finish the delicate ""Dear Prudence"" without a single bum note, to master Paul McCartney's bass line to ""I Saw Her Standing There"" on expert.<span> </span>The challenge is moderate compared to other music games, and harmony vocals are the only new feature: While the Beatles used strings, tape loops, and other effects, these are all channeled through the standard four instruments (guitar, bass, drums, and mic), and playing the strings for ""I Am the Walrus"" with the guitar controller works better than you might expect. But the harmony vocals make it a far better party game than previous <i>Rock Band</i> editions. <span> </span>I've played with two additional singers, a guy who likes to belt Rush and a woman who's in a choir, and listening to them chant ""GUTEN MORGEN GUTEN MORGEN GUT"" was worth the price right there.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The 45-track setlist balances better-known Beatles songs (""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", ""Day Tripper"") with deep cuts chosen for gameplay. <span> </span>(The loping, sad ""Dig a Pony"" is an instant favorite.)<span> </span>The game even bends the canon, reaching out to the <i>Love </i>soundtrack's mix of ""Within You Without You"" with ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", which gives you the melody of the first with the drums of the second.<span> </span>Many songs also cut off before their fade-outs-- which was the right call, but it sounds strange on a song as burned in your brain as ""Yellow Submarine"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The first chapters take place in concert settings in front of screaming crowds.<span> </span>But after the Beatles quit the road in 1966, the game segues to the Abbey Road studio, where each song gets a ""dreamscape.""<span> </span>These vignettes recycle well-worn references for each song, and none of them would make the creators of <i>Yellow Submarine </i>lose sleep.<span> </span>Covering the band's psychedelic period, they're a thin metaphor for the fact that the band was well off their tits, but they also reinforce what an insular and magical place these recordings seem to emerge from-- especially if you skip the turmoil behind the scenes.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That's not to say the game ignores their history.<span> </span>Good scores unlock rare photos dug from the archives, as well as clips of sound and video. You get their 1963 Christmas fan club record, a rough rehearsal for ""Ed Sullivan"", and a promotional film for ""Get Back"" edited out of outtakes from the <i>Let It Be </i>film. And there are clips of the band just chatting or goofing around..<span> </span>They're candid, but the candidness doesn't make the band seem more human; rather, you feel like you're eavesdropping on a whole new level of divinity.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The storytelling is at its finest in the last act, the rooftop show in London in 1969.<span> </span>The audience has aged and the band is tired.<span> </span>We never watch them fight, but the break-up is implied in the climax of ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"", where the camera jitters until the song cuts off.<span> </span>But encore ""The End"", the unannounced 45th song, is the proper send-off: Ultimately, the band was judged by the love they made.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The word ""love"" sums up the entire vision for the game.<span> </span>Where past <i>Rock Band </i>and <i>Guitar Hero </i>titles emphasized the thrills and the grinds of rock, <i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i> feels completely different: it's soothing and cozy, and the songs keep luring you back not just because they're excellent and fun, but because the familiar recordings, the nostalgic visuals, and the Beatles' smiling faces make a peaceful, loving place.<span> </span>As a painstakingly crafted piece of fandom, it's a bullseye.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But all this worship has a drawback.<span> </span>Discussing <i>Rock Band 2</i>, which doesn't use the likeness of any real stars, Harmonix's Helen McWilliams once told me, ""<span>We want it to be about you, and your rock star fantasy... You're there with your band, for each other, and you're fulfilling your rock star dream together, and the audience is there for <i>you</i>.""<span> </span><i>The Beatles: Rock Band </i>is the total opposite.<span> </span>The ""characters"" are untouchable, and the tracks don't even toss you a freestyle section.<span> </span>Your only choices are to get the song right, or not. Sure, it's a cliché that most videogames make you save the world, but at least in those games, you know you're needed.<span> </span>I've never felt less important in a game than this one.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>But I'll let 'em get away with it.<span> After all, t</span>hey're the Beatles.</span></p>

More  so when you factor in the sense that they drove their fascinating times  as much as mirrored them.</p>
<p>But the satisfying sweep of the Beatles'  epic risks doing them a disservice. It makes their achievements and  development feel somehow predestined, an inevitable consequence of their  astonishing talent. Of course, this isn't the case: Every record they  made was born out of a new set of challenges and built around tough decisions. The marketing of the band over the past few decades by their record label, Apple,  has been aimed at creating a sense of apart-ness: Let lesser talents  digitize their songs, feature on compilations, sell their music to samplers.  The Beatles are different. This flatters listeners who were there, but  setting the band apart from the rest of the pop world risks sterilizing their  music and making newcomers as resentful as curious.</p>
<p>Besides, at the start they weren't  so different at all. Britain in the early 1960s swarmed with rock'n'roll  bands, creating local scenes like the  Mersey Sound the Beatles dominated. Rock'n'roll hadn't died out,  but it had become unfashionable in showbiz eyes-- a small-club dance  music that thrived on local passion. It was raucous, even charming in a quaint  way, but there was no money in it for the big-timers of the London music biz.</p>
<p>At the same time the record market was  booming. The Conservative UK government of the late 1950s had deliberately  stoked a consumer boom: Aping the post-war consumption of the U.S., more British households than ever owned TVs, washing  machines, and record players. The number of singles sold in Britain  increased eightfold between the emergence of Elvis in 1956 and the  Beatles in '63. Combine this massively increased potential audience with the local popularity of rock'n'roll and some kind of crossover  success seems inevitable-- the idiocy of the Decca label in turning down the  Beatles isn't so much a businessman's failure to recognize genius  as a businessman's failure to recognize good business.</p>
<p>The Beatles' life as a rock'n'roll  band-- their fabled first acts in Hamburg clubs and Liverpool's Cavern-- is mostly  lost to us. The party line on <i>Please Please Me</i> is that it's a raw,  high-energy run-through of their live set, but to me this seems just  a little disingenuous. It's not even that the album, by necessity, can't  reflect the group's two-hour shows and the frenzy-baiting lengths  they'd push setpiece songs to. It's that the disc was recorded on  the back of a #1 single, and there was a big new audience to consider  when selecting material. There's rawness here-- rawness they never  quite captured again-- but a lot of sweetness too, particularly in  Lennon-McCartney originals ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""Do You Want to  Know a Secret"".</p>
<p>Rather than an accurate document of  an evening with the pre-fame Beatles, <i>Please Please Me</i> works more like  a DJ mix album-- a truncated, idealized teaser for their early live shows. More than any other of their records, <i>Please  Please Me</i> is a dance music album. Almost everything on the record, even  ballads like ""Anna"", has a swing and a kick born from the hard experience  of making a small club move. And it starts and ends with ""I Saw Her  Standing There"" and ""Twist and Shout"", the most kinetic, danceable  tracks they ever made.</p>
<p>The ""evening with the band"" feel  makes <i>Please Please Me</i> a more coherent experience than other cover-heavy  Beatles albums: Here other peoples' songs work not just as filler,  but as markers for styles and effects the band admired and might return  to as songwriters. McCartney, for instance, would go on to write songs  whose drama and emotional nuance would embarrass ""A Taste of Honey"",  but for now he puts his all into its cornball melodrama, and the song  fits.</p>
<p><i>Please Please Me</i> also works as a unit  because the group's vocals are so great. At least some of this is  due to the remastering, which makes the Beatles' singing thrillingly  up-close and immediate. I'd never really paid much attention to ""Chains""  and the Ringo-led ""Boys"", but the clearer vocals on each-- ""Chains""' sarcastic snarls and the harmonies helping Ringo out-- make them far  more compelling.</p>
<p>And as you'd imagine, making the voices  more vivid means Lennon's kamikaze take on ""Twist and Shout"" sounds  even more ferocious. Done in one cut at the session's end, it could have  been an unusable wreck. Instead, it's one of the group's most  famous triumphs. This sums up the Beatles for me. Rather than a band  whose path to the top was ordained by their genius, they were a group  with the luck to meet opportunities, the wit to recognize them, the  drive to seize them, and the talent to fulfil them. <i>Please Please Me</i> is the sound of them doing all four.</p>

On the original sleevenotes for <i>With the Beatles</i> he cheerfully admits that the group were following the formula  of <i>Please Please Me</i>, going so far as to make several track-by-track  comparisons. ""[Paul McCartney] recalls the numerous Cavern Club occasions when  this item ['Money'] brought forth the same type of overwhelming  response given to 'Twist and Shout'.""</p>
<p>Barrow's notes are direct and descriptive-- crediting each R&amp;B find, noting which tracks were live favorites  and who played what. They're an intriguing glimpse of how the band  related to its audience in this first shock of pop success: as curious,  educated listeners, not the blind screamers of Beatlemania legend. By  this point, though, the Beatles were kings of Britain with the world  about to follow. Their success was already game-changing: The band who  would go on to invent the concept album invented the boy band first.  The cheek, the gang mentality, the picking favorites-- all this would  be formularized by later svengalis but emerged initially out of Beatle  fandom.</p>
<p>So<i> With the Beatles</i> is simultaneously  a quickly turned-around cash-in and a record of real generosity and integrity. And if the  structure of the album is pretty similar to <i>Please Please Me</i>, the extra  studio time is already starting to tell. On McCartney's romantic spotlight,  showtune ""Till There Was You"", producer George Martin builds a wholly convincing  soft-focus soundworld around Ringo Starr's bongos. The group harmonies on  tracks like their rumbustious ""Please Mr. Postman"" are even more  gorgeously thick. The way the drums rumble in on ""Roll Over Beethoven""  is a moment of simple joy.</p>
<p>And those are just the covers. <i>With the  Beatles</i> starts with aggressive confidence, ""It Won't Be Long""  taking the ""yeah yeah"" chants that were the group's early calling  card and turning them into missiles. We're back, it says, and it's  one of their most thrilling songs. On ""All My Loving"" the guitars  bubble and tumble and the band finds a new way to marry prettiness and  drive. ""I Wanna Be Your Man""-- Ringo's best early vocal--  has a wolfish, hustling urgency. Not everything the band tries, as writers  or interpreters, comes off: draggy girl group revival ""Devil in Her  Heart"" is an obscurity too far, and George Harrison wins a first  songwriting credit for the Shadows-esque ""Don't Bother Me"", but  it doesn't get much spark until the guitar solo.</p>
<p>As for ""Money"", well, there simply  is no second ""Twist and Shout"" in the catalogue, but neither was  there any shame in the Beatles trying. And it has its own thrills to  offer: Less demonic and frenetic than that previous album-closer but  by some way the heaviest thing they'd yet recorded, a quality the  remaster brings fully out. Ringo's booming drums, John Lennon's sneer,  and the others' banshee backing vocals all create an air of menace,  repressed violence: the black leather and Bierkeller vibe of the band's  1961 proving grounds.</p>
<p>It's a superb way to end an album that  doesn't quite flow as well as <i>Please Please Me</i>, but never cheats the  fans either. A week after its release the band would drop ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and rewrite the entertainment pecking order: For  now they were living up to high expectations.</p>

Pop music meant teenagers, which  meant fads, which meant the clock was running on the band's fame.  The jazzman George Melly, who was writing about pop in the UK press  at this time, remembered being convinced several times that the Beatles  had hit a peak and their fans would soon desert them. I doubt this was  an unorthodox opinion.</p>
<p>A film career might extend the fame a  little, and smooth the band's inevitable transition to light entertainment.  If the film was an enjoyable romp, so much the better-- John Lennon  asked for <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> director Richard Lester on the basis  of a comedy short he'd made (later referenced in the film's famous ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence), but Lester had also helmed 1962's <i>It's  Trad, Dad!</i>, a snapshot of the British pop world just pre-Beatles (Tagline:  ""The newest, most frantic fad!""). He knew how to mix music and feelgood  filmmaking to commercial effect.</p>
<p><i>A Hard Day's Night</i>, in other words,  is a crucial inflection point in the Beatles' career. Coinciding with  their leaving Liverpool and moving to London, this could easily have  been their first step on a road of crowd-pleasing predictability: Instead,  both film and this soundtrack album are a testament to how fabulous  pop can be when you take care over doing it.</p>
<p>The album is most famous now for being  the first all-original record the band put out-- and their only all  Lennon-McCartney LP. Formidably prolific at this point, the pair had  been creating songs-- and hits-- for other performers which must  have given them useful insight into how to make different styles work.  There's been a particular jump forward in ballad writing-- on ""And  I Love Her"" in particular, Paul McCartney hits a note of humble, open-hearted  sincerity he'd return to again and again. His ""Things We Said Today""  is even better, wintry and philosophical before the surprising, stirring  middle eight.</p>
<p>But the dominant sound of the album is  the Beatles in full cry as a pop band-- with no rock'n'roll covers  to remind you of their roots you're free to take the group's new  sound purely on its own modernist terms: The chord choices whose audacity  surprised a listening Bob Dylan, the steamroller power of the harmonies,  the gleaming sound of George Harrison's new Rickenbacker alongside the confident  Northern blasts of harmonica, and a band and producer grown more than  comfortable with each other. There's detail aplenty here-- and the  remasters make it easy to hunt for-- but <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> is perhaps  the band's most straightforward album: You notice the catchiness  first, and you can wonder how they got it later.</p>
<p>The best example of this is the title  track-- the clang of that opening chord to put everyone on notice,  two burning minutes thick with percussion (including a hammering cowbell!)  thanks to the new four-track machines George Martin was using, and then  the song spiraling out with a guitar figure as abstractedly lovely  as anything the group had recorded. John Lennon's best songs on the record-- ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Tell Me Why"", ""When I Get Home"",  ""You Can't Do That""-- are fast, aggressive, frustrated and spiked  with these moments of breathtaking prettiness.</p>
<p>The <i>Hard Day's Night</i> film itself was  also a triumph in its way-- Lester's camerawork capturing the frenzy  of Beatlemania and the way the group's music was feeding off it. It  had the happy effect of introducing the group's millions of new global  fans to their world-- the fire escapes, boutiques, bombed-out spaces, and well-preserved salons of 60s London. In fact the film's knowing  dialogue and pop-art cinematography has a level of surface sophistication  that the Beatles' records don't approach for another year or two  (though they were already far more emotionally nourishing).</p>
<p>Watching the film you're reminded that  what the Beatles had set in motion was pop music's catching up with  the rest of British popular culture: In art, in TV satire, in film and  fashion and literature, the 60s were already a boom time. Pop had  been left behind-- tastemakers looked instead to jazz and folk to  soundtrack this creativity. What the Beatles had-- accidentally--  unlocked was pop music's potential to join, then lead, the party-- though it wasn't yet a given that they'd be the band to realize  said potential. <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> is an album of an era when pop  and showbiz were inseparable-- and if it doesn't transcend that  time, it does represent its definitive peak.</p>

""It isn't a pot-boiling quick-sale  any-old-thing-will-do-for-Christmas mixture,"" claimed Derek Taylor  on the <i>Beatles For Sale</i> sleeve. This pre-emptive strike looks more than  a little defensive, especially when the cover versions are back in force,  and one of them is the notorious and oft-detested ""Mr. Moonlight"".</p>
<p>The workrate expected of early-1960s pop  stars is one of the hardest things for modern listeners to get their  heads around. We're used to bands making a record, touring in support, searching for inspiration, trying out new ideas, maybe two years  later making another. Because our experience of the early Beatles is  structured around their albums, we tend to think of them as doing something  similar, except at a much more rapid pace. As Ian Macdonald's superb <i> Revolution in the Head</i> makes clear, this wasn't true: albums,  singles, EPs, tours tumbled over one another with hardly a break--  a firehose of almost continuous activity.</p>
<p>There were two reasons for this workload.  Firstly the music industry simply hadn't worked out yet how to extend  a record's shelf life-- singles weren't taken from albums after all. Secondly the lifespan of acts wasn't expected  to be long, so it made sense to get the most work possible out of them.  The famous hotch-potch of their early American catalogue was one result.  The Beatles themselves were changing how the business worked, but <i>Beatles  For Sale</i>, of all the British records, bears the stamp of these business  realities. It's a mess.</p>
<p>But it's a really good mess. Taylor's  sleevenotes are also interesting because they go out of the way to reassure  listeners that everything they're hearing can be reproduced live.  Studio experimentation was becoming more important to the band and producer George  Martin, but clearly someone viewed it with a little nervousness. You  can understand why: The Lennon-McCartney originals on <i>Beatles For Sale</i> are often full of curious arrangements, drones, jagged transitions, and  lashings of aggression. Blame pot, or the inspiration of Bob Dylan, or just the pressure-cooker  environment the group was in, but the record hits a seam of angry creativity.</p>
<p>This is particularly true of Lennon's  amazing first three songs. ""No Reply"" shatters itself with waves  of jealous rage, taking the menace that had flecked Beatles music and  bringing it up in the mix: his dangerously quiet ""that's a lie""  is the most chilling moment in their catalogue. ""I'm a Loser""  turns that anger inward with just as much brutality. And ""Baby's in Black"" curdles a nursery rhyme, transforms the group's crisp pop sound  into an off-kilter clang, and uses John and Paul McCartney's double vocal to  thicken the soupy sound even further. This run of tracks marries the  direct attack of their earliest material and the boundary-pushing of  their later albums, and stands with the best of both.</p>
<p>Even so it's a relief when ""Rock  and Roll Music"" breaks the tension, especially when you notice that  the band are playing their best rock'n'roll since ""Twist and Shout"".  Perhaps the workrate had pushed them back into the Hamburg hot zone,  but the uptempo covers on <i>Beatles For Sale</i> are fiercely good-- as ragged,  loud and immediate as the songs needed to be. Even ""Mr. Moonlight""  fits the aggressive mood, the ugliness of its organ solo surely deliberate.</p>
<p>McCartney's songs on <i>Beatles For Sale</i> are more thoughtful than moody, though on his splendid ""Every Little  Thing""-- given melodramatic thrust by Shangri-Las-style piano  and bass drum-- he's distinctly melancholy, his ""yes, I know I'm  a lucky guy"" sounding like an attempt to convince himself of that. But Lennon's  anger and the band's rediscovery of rock'n'roll mean <i>For Sale</i>'s  reputation as the group's meanest album is deserved, even if it has  ""Eight Days a Week"" as its breezy centerpiece. The lumpiest and  least welcoming of their early records, it's also one of the most  rewarding.</p>

Such a rude young man-- but is he ""an early clue to the new direction""? They consult the calendar: no, the new trend isn't due for another three weeks.</p>
<p>It's a gag, and not an original one, but born of truth: the fashion watcher's assumption was that things ran on a two to three year cycle. As 1965 began, the Beatles obviously weren't going away, but being pop's aristocracy didn't necessarily make you pop's leading edge. The kids were coming up from behind. Commentators like Nik Cohn had noted sections of the pop audience looking to R&amp;B clubs for their harder-edged, bluesier sound, and this was bleeding into the mainstream. The Animals could claim a no. 1, the Stones had two. So did London's Kinks, and if the Who didn't it was only because their routines were too extreme.</p>
<p>And so, two years and four albums into their career, the Beatles at last had rivals. Serious ones, who'd rampaged through the door the Beatles opened and blithely ignored the showbiz conventions the Beatles were contractually tied to. While the Rolling Stones recorded ""Satisfaction"", the Beatles were being trotted around the world shooting the ambitious, ridiculous <i>Help!</i>. Its soundtrack album is as haphazard as <i>Beatles For Sale</i>, but lacks that record's glowering intensity.</p>
<p>Luckily, it replaces moodiness with curiosity and a much-expanded instrumental palette. They'd been intermittent experimenters from the start, but <i>Help!</i> is where the band's interest in sound and arrangement really starts to flower, and this remastered version is a particular feast of new timbres and ideas: the percussion on ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"", Indian instrumentation appearing on ""Ticket to Ride"", the weary woodwind on ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"".</p>
<p>All this is put into the service of some of the band's best pop songs. The title track, for instance, where Lennon's as confused and angry as he was on ""I'm a Loser"", but now the music doesn't follow suit-- its briskness blanks his pleas, and his bandmates sound more mocking than sympathetic. Paul gets similar finger-wagging backing on ""The Night Before"", a wonderfully jaunty song about being dumped after a one-night stand. ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"" is another song happy to marry beauty to venom-- its words an explicit threat, its harmonies an example of the seemingly effortless loveliness that makes people go gooey and mystical when the Beatles are mentioned.</p>
<p>Obviously, their new interest in texture wasn't wholly distinct from their new interest in drugs. The ""reference"" in ""It's Only Love"" is played for laughs, but ""Tell Me What You See"" falls halfway between romance and mysticism and is rather awkward despite its marvelous period percussion. The album has other murky spots-- Harrison's songs are fine, but ""Act Naturally"" suggests that finding a tune for Ringo every album was becoming an issue. And the closing version of ""Dizzy Miss Lizzie"" is a farewell to the ""end it with a rocker"" formula that drags despite Lennon's best efforts to rouse it.</p>
<p>It doesn't help ""Dizzy"" that it's placed just after two personal breakthroughs for McCartney. ""I've Just Seen a Face"" and ""Yesterday"" are both love songs, rich with feeling but never overwrought, with the deceptive lightness that would become trademark and millstone for their writer. ""Face"", a folksy country song, demonstrated the gift for pastiche that would help give the rest of the Beatles' career such convincing variety. ""Yesterday"" went further, demonstrating that you could arrange a pop song orchestrally in a way that might deepen it, not just turn it into kitsch. Of all their tracks, ""Yesterday"" is surely the one that's hardest to listen to with new ears. This remaster, capturing its preternatural serenity, is a terrific opportunity to do exactly that.</p>
<p><i>Help!</i> is almost the last twitch of the Beatles as a working, gigging beat group. It's a great but confusing record, and no wonder contemporaries felt they might at last be losing direction. With hindsight confusion looks like transition, and the remasters-- issued all at once and linked to a game designed to present the band's story <i>as</i> a story-- can't help but invite that hindsight. But the story could have turned out differently, and these early records are still so fierce and alive. Taking the Beatles one disc at a time lets us recover their precariousness, the risks they took, what they lost as well as what they gained.</p>

Considering how much music had already found its way to CD, the Beatles were very late, so the digital rollout was a big deal. The new issues came out in batches and the excitement steadily built, peaking when <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> came out on June 1, 1987, the 20th anniversary of its original release (""It was 20 years ago today..."" was perhaps the greatest record marketing hook of all time.) In the 22 years since, plenty of bands have had their catalogues reissued a few times over (some with ridiculous frequency-- looking at you, Bowie and Costello), either to take advantage of improvements in technology or to repackage the records to sell them again to existing fans. But those 1987 CD versions have been it as far as the original Beatles albums. They've done some special projects-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1093-let-it-be-naked/"" target=""_blank""><i>Let It Be...Naked</i></a>, two volumes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1094-the-capitol-albums-vol-1/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Capitol Albums</i></a>, collecting American versions of their records, the remix album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9669-love/"" target=""_blank""><i>Love</i></a>-- but if, two months ago, you wanted to buy a copy of <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>, you'd be getting the 1987 remaster, done with 1987 technology, complete with a flimsy, bare-bones CD insert in a jewel case.</p>
<p>This week, Capitol/EMI rectifies the situation. The entire Beatles catalogue has been remastered and the CDs are coming out in new editions. It is perhaps ironic that this is happening as interest in the compact disc format is on the wane, but once again Beatles fans are excited. Are they worth buying again? Over the next three days, we're going to be reviewing all of the Beatles reissues, including the <i>Beatles Rock Band</i> game also coming out this week. But in addition to discussing the music and the records, we wanted to take a moment here to lay out some general thoughts on the sets, with further details relegated to the proper reviews.</p>
<p>First, the configurations. All 12 original albums, from <i>Please Please Me</i> to <i>Let It Be</i>, have been remastered and are being issued in stereo (these are the same tracklistings as have been on CD since the 80s, including the American version of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i>). In addition, the two <i>Past Masters</i> CDs, which collect singles and tracks that didn't appear on the original albums, have been combined into one 2xCD set. The first four albums are appearing in stereo on CD for the first time. The packaging for all stereo CDs includes the original artwork and liner notes, along with new recording notes and a historical essay. Rather than jewel boxes, the stereo CDs are packaged in sharp-looking and durable foldout cardboard packaging. Each CD contains a short documentary in QuickTime format on the making of the album (these are said to be limited to this initial reissue).</p>
<p>The packaging in general is very well done; the albums feel like they were put together with care and great attention to detail. You hold one in your hand, and it feels important. I've never been a fan of the plastic jewel box, and it's wonderful that they've done away with them here. CDs slide into a little pocket, so there are no spindles to break. The liner notes are succinct and informative, they favor the factual over the hyperbolic, and they cover what should be covered. The documentaries are well done but about what you would expect: four minutes long or so, narrated with interviews with the Beatles and George Martin culled from the <i>Anthology </i>project, with archival photos and film footage. They're certainly nothing revelatory, but a nice intro to the world of the album for anyone unfamiliar with the details. All in all, they did the packages right.</p>
<p>In addition to the individual CDs, the reissues are available in two box set configurations. <i>The Stereo Box</i> collects the stereo versions of all the albums and adds a DVD gathering all the short documentaries in one place. <i>In Mono</i>-- limited, but it's not exactly clear yet <i>how </i>limited-- is more of a specialty item. It presents mono mixes of albums (which are available only in the box set, not for sale individually) from <i>P</i><i>lease Please Me</i> up through <i>The Beatles</i> (aka the White Album). <i>Yellow Submarine</i>, <i>Abbey Road</i>, and <i>Let It Be</i> were never mixed for mono, and are not included, but the set does include a 2xCD set called <i>The Mono Masters</i> with mono mixes of most of the singles included on <i>Past Masters</i> (a few of the later ones were never mixed for mono). Each record included with <i>In Mono</i> appears in a mini-LP replica package, accurate all the way down to the original printing on the inner sleeves (yep, you can slide the CDs in them if you want). Two discs, <i>Help!</i> and <i>Rubber Soul</i>, also contain the original stereo mixes on the same disc as the mono mixes (the 1987 CD issues were newly remixed for stereo). The original inserts included with the LPs-- the individual portraits in <i>The Beatles</i>, the cut-outs in <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>-- are included as well. There are no CD booklets in <i>In Mono</i>; rather, the set contains a separate booklet of liner notes, covering the <i>Mono Masters</i> set in detail, and explaining the differences between the stereo and mono mixes of the proper albums. There are also no mini-documentaries.</p>
<p>Why mono? Two reasons. First, pop music in stereo was still a novelty through most of the 60s. Radio was dominated by single-channel AM, and the young people who bought LPs were far more likely to have a mono record player as a sound source. Given their audience and the technology of the time, for much of the Beatles' run, the band themselves considered the mono mix as the ""real"" version of the record and devoted more of their attention to it. Mono mixes were prepared first with the involvement of the band, and in some cases, George Martin and EMI engineers completed stereo remixes of the albums later, after the group had left the studio. So mono, first off, presumably hews closer to the intentions of the Beatles themselves. It's what the Beatles had in mind, their vision of the records.</p>
<p>Secondly, since the mono and stereo mixing sessions happened at different times, there are differences between the two versions, not just in the balance of the sound but also in the actual content. Different takes were sometimes used for punching in overdubs, or an alternate vocal take might make its way into the mix. Sometimes tracks were edited differently, and would be shorter or longer, and in some cases the tape ran at a slightly different speed, changing the pitch slightly. Some of the differences are subtle, and some are not. The mono version of ""Helter Skelter"", to take one example, is a minute shorter, as the ""false"" ending fadeout is presented as the track's true ending (and it thus omits the closing scream of ""I got blisters on my fingers!"") The significance of these differences will depend on the level of one's Beatles fandom; of course, those shelling out for the <i>In Mono</i> box will likely enjoy poring over the details.</p>
<p>Comparing stereo and mono versions also offers an opportunity to think about changes in the technology of music listening. In the 60s, far fewer people listened to music on headphones. Music was meant to be heard through the air-- over the radio, in a car, on a jukebox, in a living room. And mono mixes were not designed with headphone listening in mind. It's been pointed out that mono records heard through headphones can sound like they are coming from a single point in the middle of your head, which can feel strange. I find that as the decade wore on and stereo mixes became more sophisticated, the Beatles' albums become less interesting on headphones when they are in mono-- the swirling pans of psychedelic material like ""I Am the Walrus"" or ""Revolution 9"" moving around are missed. From roughly <i>Revolver</i> forward, if I'm listening on headphones, I generally prefer the stereo mixes. Over a sound system, though, the mono mixes throughout the catalogue sound absolutely wonderful. The first four albums, however, with their extreme stereo separation, sound much better in mono in my opinion, regardless of the playback source.</p>
<p>In any case, the sound of these remasters, mono or stereo, is exceptional. I've always felt that the sound quality of the original 1987 remasters was slightly underrated. The CD issues were well received at the time and were considered state of the art, but as the years wore on and the label never did anything to improve them, resentment set in and people began to focus on their flaws. Fair enough. But whatever you think of the 1987 remasters, these new versions are a marked improvement. In terms of clarity and detail, they are consistently impressive. But they're also successful for showing restraint.</p>
<p>In the last few years, there's been a lot of talk about the ""loudness war""-- the tendency to over-compress and master albums too ""hot,"" so that dynamic range is squashed and peak-level sounds are pushed to the point of clipping. Fortunately, that has not happened here. These CD versions are definitely louder across the board, but there's still plenty of breathing room, so that the dynamic sound-- and these records were nothing if not dynamic-- hits the way they should. Interestingly, the mono mixes are uniformly a bit quieter than the stereo mixes, tending to fall somewhere between the original stereo master and the new one. To get geeky here for a moment, a few diagrams, so that you can see the increases in volume with the new set. The key when looking at waveforms is to take note of whether the peak sounds (which come closest to the volume ceiling inherent in digital audio) maintain the same relationship to the quieter sounds. I'm not an engineer, but the loudest sounds:quietest sounds ratio looks to me to be intact.</p>

<p>Listening to the new masters, the differences in sound quality generally manifest in three ways: songs have more ""punch,"" with Paul McCartney's bass (an absolute wonder throughout) and Ringo's drums hitting with more force; the separation is better, so that instruments and (especially) layered vocals have more definition-- when the Beatles are harmonizing, you can more easily pick out the different vocalists, and the voices have more presence; and finally, the sound in general seems just a touch brighter, with various sound effects, cymbals taps, and so on, ringing with more clarity. The differences to my ears are not quite night and day, but they are certainly there, and they are noticeable. And it's satisfying to have these albums, absolutely some of the best-engineered records in the history of pop music, sounding as good as they can.</p>
<p>And now, onto the music. Note that, rather than doing so for individual records, we're designating the Beatles sets as a whole as ""Best New Reissues"".</p>

The late qawwali legend has earned the admiration of singers as different as Jeff Buckley, Eddie Vedder, and Devendra Banhart. On 1989's <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i> soundtrack, he also worked with Peter Gabriel, who ended up releasing six of Khan's albums on his own Real World label. With so much indie culture these past few years stuck in the 1980s, Gabe fave raves Vampire Weekend are simply the most collegiate of recent bands returning to Toto's ""Africa"" for inspiration. Khan's native Pakistan has been comparatively overlooked.</p>
<p>Victoria Bergsman's recorded output to date is almost quintessentially Swedish. With the Concretes, she introduced Diana Ross shimmy to Mazzy Star haze, staying tuneful enough to soundtrack TV commercials. Lending her shy detachment to Peter Bjorn and John's world-conquering ""Young Folks"", she participated in a moment likely to define Swedish pop for many casual listeners the way Ace of Base or ABBA used to serve as shorthand for the peace-loving nation's catchiest export. Bergsman's debut album as Taken by Trees, 2007's <i>Open Field</i>, uses the full expanse of PB&amp;J-er Björn Yttling's production (plus a songwriting credit from Camera Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell) to evoke a gorgeously austere northern landscape, the kind of place where you appreciate the sun all the more because it shines so sparingly.</p>
<p>So it's tempting to be skeptical of Bergsman's trip to Pakistan to record a follow-up-- all the more so given an accompanying <i>National Geographic </i>mini-documentary's whiff of cultural condescension. Thankfully, <i>East of Eden</i> suits Taken by Trees the way a shift from folk-pop to terrifying avant-classical suited oft-mentioned German antecedent Nico. Bergsman's plaintive purr can't match Khan's multi-octave ululations, and unlike the late Buckley, she doesn't try. Instead, she and accompanist Andreas Söderström-- working with local musicians who've played alongside the maestro-- embrace the ecstatic peacefulness of this Sufi musical tradition's rhythms and instrumentation. Production from Studio's Dan Lissvik gives the nine-song, half-hour set an ascetic grace, sort of like secular devotional music. How very Scandinavian.</p>
<p>In truth, Taken by Trees' debut already had a similar religious quality, albeit owing more to the introspective folk of Nick Drake; excellent remixes by the Tough Alliance and Air France showed how much those songs could gain by leaving Europe. On <i>East of Eden</i>, sinuous woodwind and rippling hand percussion help give plainspoken love songs like ""Day by Day"" or ""Watch the Waves"" an eternal resonance, which Bergsman's understated poise only deepens. Söderström's dusty classical guitar should please Studio devotees on haunting opener ""To Lose Someone"", while from out of the swaying call and response of ""Greyest Love of All"" rises a perfect prayer for our time of endless Web 2.0 connectivity and ever-shortening attention spans: ""I hope you'll find some peace of mind.""</p>
<p>Noah Lennox, aka Animal Collective's Panda Bear, is no stranger to prayerfulness, field recordings, or non-rock influences; that he and Bergsman would develop a mutual affinity is only fitting. After the fashion of Studio, TTA, Air France, and some of Gothenburg, Sweden's other musicians, who like to retitle and reimagine the songs they interpret, Taken by Trees transforms <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i> highlight ""My Girls"" into intimate, harmonium-humming ""My Boys"". It's a little paradoxical, recording an ode to simple domesticity in a region where religious fundamentalism led men to consider the unmarried Bergsman ""everyone's property,"" but as with any great hymn, this spirited meditation on indie-style puritanism should have the power to move even non-believers. Lennox, in turn, adds his incantatory vocals to the nylon-stringed regret of ""Anna"", where having ""way too much tonight"" can mean alcohol, fighting, or both.</p>
<p>If you go straight long enough, somebody once said, you'll end up where you were. <i>East of Eden</i>, in that sense, isn't so far from Studio's <i>West Coast</i>: a masterful, hypnotic album that draws on a world of influences but is ultimately limited by none. So the most distracting misstep is ""Wapas Karna"", essentially a field recording fronted by a qawwali singer rather than Bergsman herself, while two other less immediate tracks are compelling mostly for their impulse toward cultural merger: the sparsely adorned, Swedish-language melancholy of ""Tidens Gång"", which melts into ambient chirps in under two minutes, or the closing drone of ""Bekännelse"", apparently a setting of a poem by (German) writer Herman Hesse that reflects some of Bergsman's liberal guilt. ""If you know what you want to create and are determined, you can do it wherever you are,"" Bergsman recently told London's <i>The Independent</i>. ""I'd rather live in sunny California."" This must be the place.</p></div>"|13386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13386-east-of-eden/|8.1|Marc Hogan

On paper, and to many trainspotting DJ types, they're the sole invention of Brooklyn-based producer Andy Butler; this arrangement-- wherein interchangeable parts orbit around a single driving force-- is one we all recognize and understand. In the live environment, though, that dynamic isn't so clear cut. On stage, Hercules and Love Affair's many moving parts combine for a theatrical re-imagining of late-1970s and early-80s disco. That music was loaded with sexual identity politics, reclamation cries, and, ultimately, an overriding inclusivity; H&amp;LA's forceful live configuration emanates those aspects so totally that one might leave wondering whose show it really is.</p>
<p>This push-pull, of course, is no bad thing. More than anything, it allows for a level of dialogue between producer and live performers that most crossover dance acts frequently aim for and miss (cough, Basement Jaxx, cough). It adds dimension; Butler may be the creative force, but it's the rest of H&amp;LA who provide the sense of community and surprise that ratifies and contextualizes his output. He's the DJ, they're the party. He's Hercules, and... yeah, you get the point.</p>
<p>As Hercules and Love Affair's first commercial mix, the superb <i>Sidetracked</i> affords Butler the opportunity to step outside that feedback loop and straight-up DJ. Judging from the immediacy and sheer exuberance of this set, you can tell it's an opportunity he relishes. If last year's studied, nuanced DFA debut hinted at a talent with an impressive record collection and quietly sturdy judgment, <i>Sidetracked</i> cements it. With a menu consisting mostly of old-school disco, Euro house and slightly off-kilter electro, this is one of those rare sets that works every bit as equally as a party mix as it does as a sort of travelogue of influences. By the first three tracks, which sees Butler link Westbam's zippy, overeager ""And Party"" to Todd Terry's ice-cool hip-hop drum pastiche ""No Pares (Don't Stop)"" to an oblong, twerky disco-house original (new H&amp;LA track ""I Can't Wait""-- sadly not a Nu Shooz cover), we're in full bloom.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Sidetracked</i> continues pretty much on that level, with Butler's keenly tuned ear for mid-tempo lifts and staccato breaks working across decades and continents. Early-90s synth stabs from Belgian Euro house also-rans Fax Yourself sit prettily alongside a revelatory bit of mutant disco from Brooklyn's In Flagranti (""I Hadn't Screwed Around Before""), released earlier this year. An obscure sliver of big beat from Berlin's Daniel Wang (""Zola Has Landed"") finds new life when plunked next to the proto-dubstep of Rhythm Masters' ""Oh Oh Why"". The Moroder-influenced grind of Montreal producer Gino Soccio's ""Dream On"" leads into the dainty, feather-light ""Dreaming"" from Italy's early-80s disco outfit Rainbow Team. On paper, you wouldn't expect this stuff to fit nearly so well together.</p>
<p>This edition of <i>Sidetracked</i> is the first in a new series from longtime house giant Renaissance, and while one might reasonably question the wisdom of getting into the commercial mix series game at a time when the best benchmark for this sort of thing is arguably a free weekly podcast, it's hard to deny they've made a strong first showing here. <i>Sidetracked</i> includes a second disc featuring uncut and original versions of all these tracks, a perk that's admittedly worth mentioning only in light of Butler's mix consisting of songs you'd actually want unabridged versions of in the first place. As a first salvo, though, it's pretty hard to fault; if vintage disco, classic house, and gurning Euro house are up your street, this is as happy-making as it gets.</p></div>"|13216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13216-sidetracked/|8.3|Mark Pytlik

Is it just that it takes too much technical proficiency to play? Is it that latter-day prog metal bands like Dream Theater ruined it for everyone? Did the asteroid of punk actually kill off rock's dinosaurs? As someone who came up on old, (let's face it) unfashionable progressive rock, I do occasionally like to come across a new record that scratches those old itches, and Mew always seems to come through for me. The Danish trio (originally a quartet) doesn't do 17-minute epics, extended solos, lyrics about Chinese scripture, or crazy odd-metered jamming, though. Rather, they seem to have captured the exact moment when Carl Palmer, Steve Howe, Geoff Downes, and John Wetton realized prog was done for and started thinking about forming Asia.</p>
<p>And that's not a bad thing at all! <i>And the Glass-Handed Kites</i> (2005), with its continuous mix and suite-like structure, nailed just about everything you could do right with that formula. Their new record, which has a whole freakin' poem for a title (<i>No More Stories Are Told Today I'm Sorry They Washed Away No More Stories The World Is Grey I'm Tired Let's Wash Away</i> is how it reads complete), is a hair less awesome, but it won't lose them any fans, and its poppiest moments might even gain them a few. It doesn't open in the most welcoming way-- ""New Terrain"" is half-backward/ half-forward, with instruments and vocals switching back and forth for the whole song. Playing it backward gives you a different song, called ""Nervous"". The disorientation fades pretty quickly, though, once the tangled, King Crimson-ish guitar refrain and lung-full-of-helium vocals of ""Introducing Palace Players"" kick in. That nasty riff is one of several instances where Bo Madsen's guitar playing serves as a sort of dry, dissonant foil to the music's otherwise lush, floating ambiance.</p>
<p>Another of those songs is the other single, ""Repeaterbeater"", which, the way it kicks in with a hard rock rush before lifting off with multi-tracked vocals and high-wattage keyboards, seems designed as a follow-up to <i>Glass Handed</i>'s biggest hit, ""The Zookeeper's Boy"". It's like ""Heat of the Moment"" if it was played by Phoenix with the Bee Gees sitting in on vocals. While these songs and a few others (""Beach"", especially) foreground the band's accessibility and odd arena appeal, they do still chuck a few knee-buckling curveballs at you. ""Sometimes Life Isn't Easy"" could contain the seeds for five songs if you cut it up. The intro is a total mindfuck, with super-high falsetto outbursts and saxophone that comes out of nowhere, but it quickly winds down with some warm synths and a gentle verse vocal backed by what sounds like a choir of children. The chorus may be the most joyful thing this band has ever put to tape.</p>
<p>Mew show signs of trying to shake themselves out of habits, reversing their slow build approach on ""Cartoons And Macramé Wounds"" by starting the song at its peak and slowly ramping down from there. ""Hawaii"" is raw and rhythmic, with the guitar taking more of a lead role than usual in the opening verse, before giving way to a xylophone solo and anthemic final movement. The same method of through composition shapes closer ""Reprise"", a song that could easily be used to re-soundtrack <i>Blade Runner</i> in a pinch. Over the course of a long career (they formed in 1994), Mew has succeeded in developing a good sound from some of the least hip ingredients imaginable, and <i>No More Stories...</i> feels like a consolidation of every stride they've made to date. I'm still not sure if the word Mew means something in Danish or they're just named after something their cat said, but I'm ready to start using it as shorthand for quality prog-pop.</p></div>"|13399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13399-no-more-stories-are-told-today/|8.1|Joe Tangari

Not that Dean Wareham was much more capable a singer or musician than his former bandmates (far from it), but once he formed Luna, he did seem more naturally inclined toward the spotlight. Meanwhile, the underrated Galaxie 500 rhythm section of Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang nestled into their niche on the margins, content to call it quits but quietly prodded by some polite benefactors (among them Galaxie 500 producer and Shimmy Disc majordomo Kramer) to continue their hushed career as a duo.</p>
<p>The pair's other prime benefactor was Jonathan Poneman of Sub Pop, who, following Damon &amp; Naomi's debut, <i>More Sad Hits</i>, signed the two for a near-decade of increasingly confident releases, culminating in 2000's peak collaboration with Ghost. Admittedly, that decade resulted in a mere three studio albums, but Damon &amp; Naomi's relatively limited output makes them a good candidate for a concise career overview compilation, which <i>The Sub Pop Years</i> welcomingly provides. Divided more or less evenly between <i>The Wondrous World of Damon &amp; Naomi</i>, <i>Playback Singers</i>, and <i>Damon &amp; Naomi With Ghost</i>, while adding material from a 2002 tour document, <i>The Sub Pop Years</i> likely won't spark any epiphanies, but it does help coalesce a career that often, by design or not, threatened to float off into the ether and disappear.</p>
<p>When Damon &amp; Naomi get real gone, they practically vanish, and certainly as vocalists Krukowski and Yang were far from forceful, preferring to hover rather than soar. But their songs do build, gently and gradually, with all the invisible grace of a sunrise, letting in the light a little at a time until even barely there tracks such as ""New York City"", ""Tour of the World"", ""The Mirror Phase"", and ""Turn of the Century"" achieve more in terms of emotion than they initially let on. The two know their limitations but embrace them, too, with each song a meditation on simplicity almost presented as paeans to life's slow-motion inevitability. One can easily imagine what, say, demolitionist dervish Neil Young would do with a song like ""Judah and the Maccabees"". Damon &amp; Naomi, on the other hand, deliver an epic by implication, content enough in its own austerity to let the elliptical portent seep rather than spill out.</p>
<p>It helps that, between the studio album and the live disc, more than half of the songs on this comp feature contributions from Ghost, and particularly Ghost guitarist Michio Kurihara, who turns out to be such an oddly suited collaborator. Odd, because never do Damon &amp; Naomi reach the heights of his legendary band (though the extended Kurihara-fied coda of ""The Great Wall"" is pretty hypnotically great) but suited all the same because he knows how to modulate his playing to support Krukowski and Yang's quiet storm. That Kurihara has stuck with the duo for its subsequent studio albums as well makes <i>The Sub Pop Years</i> an ideal bridge from past to present for anyone playing catch-up.</p></div>"|13390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13390-the-sub-pop-years/|7.5|Joshua Klein

For his follow-up, he has joined forces with drummer Derek W. James and bass player Paz Lenchantin (both of whom played on <i>Prayer</i>) as the Entrance Band, and the rhythm section + lead guitar equation is meant to recall the Jimi Hendrix Experience. This reconfiguration from lone troubadour to bandleader is a bit confounding: <i>Prayer of Death</i> filtered Bay Area psych rock and Chicago-style electric blues into an idiosyncratic and compelling mishmash, and with what seemed at the time like an unwavering devotion to a peculiar vision, he most certainly didn't sound like someone who would play well with others.</p>
<p>And he doesn't. The Entrance Band's self-titled debut dilutes the narcotic otherworldliness of <i>Prayer of Death</i> with jamband wankery that's far too beholden to Jimi in particular and blooze rock in general. Gone are the mind-expanding reverb, devil-may-care indulgences, tweaked nostalgia; in their place are buffed production values, noodly longueurs, ""Guitar Hero"" theatrics, copycat conceptualism. Blakeslee doesn't clean up so well. In these environs, his caterwaul sounds willfully instead of naturally abrasive, constantly threatening to slide off key but never conveying any wildman bravado. The high notes on ""Sing for the One"" sound well beyond his reach, and he sounds even further out of his depth on ""MLK"", a paean to the civil rights leader that has all the gravity of a grade-school book report: ""I remember MLK,"" he sings, ""and how I wish he was here today.""</p>
<p>This is obviously not the fault of James and Lenchantin, who constitute a perfectly adequate rhythm section. Nor is producer Nadav Eisenman entirely to blame, although his disinfectant sheen saps the dirty rock drama from the instruments. And you can't really chalk it up to the move from Chicago to Los Angeles, even though such westward movement blanches many artists' eccentricities (see: the Band, Rod Stewart). But all of these factors combined have siphoned off the crazy and brought Blakeslee back down to mundane earth, which isn't a good setting for him.</p>
<p>He's only a middling guitar player, but insists on soloing and showboating endlessly, drawing out songs to unnecessary lengths. ""You Must Turn"" drags on and on through an uninteresting instrumental section, then launches into an ambient outro that goes nowhere slowly. Rising and fading nicely, the slower ""Lives"" marries some watery Cure guitarwork to a blues framework-- an initially compelling combination that is eventually marred by Blakeslee's mannered howl and the band's aimless playing. Blakeslee does himself and his band a severe disservice by resurrecting one of the best <i>Prayer of Death</i> tracks, ""Grim Reaper Blues"", as a sallow retread, with his vocals garishly out front and with no trace of the mortal conflict that shot through the previous album. It's an unfortunate point of comparison that just shows how harshed Blakeslee's buzz has become.</p></div>"|13394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13394-the-entrance-band/|2.2|Stephen M. Deusner

It's an easy narrative to set up, maybe because it requires fewer keystrokes than the more correct comparison: Sunny Day Real Estate.</p>
<p>It's got nothing to do with churches of reverb or Christianity, though those would come later for SDRE. Taking the longview, SDRE seem even less of their time than they were in the mid-90s, positioned between the more stone-faced acolytes of Fugazi and the branches of Jade Tree that went mathletic or simply stuffed as many proper nouns as possible into radio-intended pop-punk (see: songs called ""Anne Arbour""). SDRE saw beyond the constraints of ""scene"" and envisioned a point where the meek would inherit the arena--- independently minded, sensitive boys doling out anthems of introspection to thousands of fist-raising, navel-gaving kids. With a hotly anticipated fall tour coming, Sub Pop has reissued the original lineup's only two records, which reaffirm what those swiftly sold-out shows already made pretty clear: a lot of people love these guys, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>What immediately strikes you about <i>Diary </i>is it doesn't sound intended to be a gamechanger-- even if it's no surprise that one of emo's most enduring documents is called <i>Diary </i>of all things. But even if it doesn't break new ground musically, it signaled a new way to talk about the passion. The quicksilver time-changes and jangly-but-not-collegiate guitar chords show nods to Dischord, but it's the terse yet tender delivery of the lyrics from Jeremy Enigk that ultimately drew people in. ""The waiting could crush my heart/ The tide breaks a wave of fear,"" okay, fine-- this kind of stuff inspired a whole lot of heartfelt word salad from far less talented sadsacks, but ""Seven"" still is one of those great album-starters, written like they had to win you over in five minutes or it would be their last song.</p>
<p>Immediately after, the insistently ringing two-note riff that opens ""In Circles"" portents something every bit as excitable, but to this day, I still find myself genuinely surprised as it folds into a half-time dirge. It's quite possibly the definitive SDRE song, since it's here where you hear their signature trick: Enigk is often content to softly nudge verse melodies, but the choruses are something else entirely. If the harmonies were prettier, it could be straight-up pop; if they were yelled, it might be punk. Here, it simply hits a sweet spot for people who were into shows for the community, but also to meet potential dates.  The rangy, disarmingly ramshackle ""Song About an Angel"" nearly equals it during its six-minute run.</p>
<p>If <i>Diary </i>has a reputation of being front-loaded, it can't be in the pejorative sense: bands can and <i>have </i>spent entire careers ripping those three songs off over and over again. For a while, I thought <i>Diary </i>happened to be an album whose importance exceeded its quality-- thanks to some unfortunately (or unavoidably) dated production, if nothing else. That's been remedied to good extent on this remaster-- ""The Blankets Were the Stairs"" no longer sounds as grounded by its granular grunge tones, and the drums sound less bogged in Green River sludge. Elsewhere, classic rock guitar heroics are more prevalent than Pac NW grunge: certainly in the memorable riffs from ""47"" and ""Round"", and ""Shadows"" played the shadow-and-light game better than any of their peers who were just <i>dying </i>to be compared to Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Despite <i>Diary's </i>success, SDRE had a pretty uncomfortably defined relationship with their audience as well as themselves, so the follow-up proved to be a knottier affair, and not just because it's widely known as either <i>Sunny Day Real Estate, LP2</i>,<i> </i>or <i>The Pink Album</i>.  The songs themselves didn't get any shorter or less intense, but they feel significantly less edified. When the charmingly animated video for ""Seven"" ran on ""120 Minutes"", it never felt <i>too </i>out of place regardless of whether it led into Jawbox or Pearl Jam, but <i>LP2</i> tended to veer more towards the obscure. It certainly didn't help that the packaging itself contained no artwork other than its entirely pink cover or lyric sheet. And compared to <i>Diary</i>'s untouchable opening triad, that of <i>LP2 </i>was bound to pale, and you feel like SDRE is playing it overly self-aware-- ""Friday"", ""Theo B"", and ""Red Elephant"" each would've been the shortest track on <i>Diary</i>, save for its near-interlude ""Phuerton Skeurto"". ""Friday"" starts <i>LP2 </i>with the kind of risky, slippery melody that all but screams ""difficult follow-up."" The high-wired guitars of ""8"" introduce damn near atonality, the kind of chords an amateur bangs out on a piano, but soon they become the backbone of the record's most muscular number.</p>
<p>It's easy to project the idea that this was a band dissolving personally and musically from the inside-out if you know the history, but the music itself is every bit as ghostly on its own-- even beyond the threadbare arrangements, Enigk has said that many lyrics were left unfinished or sung as gibberish. <i>LP2 </i>certainly has more than its share of moments, but in the context of SDRE's artistic arc, a time when they wanted to be Shudder To Think instead of arena-fillers can feel like a bridge to nowhere.</p>
<p>And that was pretty much it for the classic lineup of SDRE-- the rhythm section would play on Foo Fighters' <i>The Colour and the Shape</i>, a record whose brickwalled dynamics and gleaming-edge guitar arguably did just as much to determine the actual <i>sound</i> of modern radio rock as Sunny Day or even producer Gil Norton's work with the Pixies.

It's an easy narrative to set up, maybe because it requires fewer keystrokes than the more correct comparison: Sunny Day Real Estate.</p>
<p>It's got nothing to do with churches of reverb or Christianity, though those would come later for SDRE. Taking the longview, SDRE seem even less of their time than they were in the mid-90s, positioned between the more stone-faced acolytes of Fugazi and the branches of Jade Tree that went mathletic or simply stuffed as many proper nouns as possible into radio-intended pop-punk (see: songs called ""Anne Arbour""). SDRE saw beyond the constraints of ""scene"" and envisioned a point where the meek would inherit the arena--- independently minded, sensitive boys doling out anthems of introspection to thousands of fist-raising, navel-gaving kids. With a hotly anticipated fall tour coming, Sub Pop has reissued the original lineup's only two records, which reaffirm what those swiftly sold-out shows already made pretty clear: a lot of people love these guys, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>What immediately strikes you about <i>Diary </i>is it doesn't sound intended to be a gamechanger-- even if it's no surprise that one of emo's most enduring documents is called <i>Diary </i>of all things. But even if it doesn't break new ground musically, it signaled a new way to talk about the passion. The quicksilver time-changes and jangly-but-not-collegiate guitar chords show nods to Dischord, but it's the terse yet tender delivery of the lyrics from Jeremy Enigk that ultimately drew people in. ""The waiting could crush my heart/ The tide breaks a wave of fear,"" okay, fine-- this kind of stuff inspired a whole lot of heartfelt word salad from far less talented sadsacks, but ""Seven"" still is one of those great album-starters, written like they had to win you over in five minutes or it would be their last song.</p>
<p>Immediately after, the insistently ringing two-note riff that opens ""In Circles"" portents something every bit as excitable, but to this day, I still find myself genuinely surprised as it folds into a half-time dirge. It's quite possibly the definitive SDRE song, since it's here where you hear their signature trick: Enigk is often content to softly nudge verse melodies, but the choruses are something else entirely. If the harmonies were prettier, it could be straight-up pop; if they were yelled, it might be punk. Here, it simply hits a sweet spot for people who were into shows for the community, but also to meet potential dates.  The rangy, disarmingly ramshackle ""Song About an Angel"" nearly equals it during its six-minute run.</p>
<p>If <i>Diary </i>has a reputation of being front-loaded, it can't be in the pejorative sense: bands can and <i>have </i>spent entire careers ripping those three songs off over and over again. For a while, I thought <i>Diary </i>happened to be an album whose importance exceeded its quality-- thanks to some unfortunately (or unavoidably) dated production, if nothing else. That's been remedied to good extent on this remaster-- ""The Blankets Were the Stairs"" no longer sounds as grounded by its granular grunge tones, and the drums sound less bogged in Green River sludge. Elsewhere, classic rock guitar heroics are more prevalent than Pac NW grunge: certainly in the memorable riffs from ""47"" and ""Round"", and ""Shadows"" played the shadow-and-light game better than any of their peers who were just <i>dying </i>to be compared to Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Despite <i>Diary's </i>success, SDRE had a pretty uncomfortably defined relationship with their audience as well as themselves, so the follow-up proved to be a knottier affair, and not just because it's widely known as either <i>Sunny Day Real Estate, LP2</i>,<i> </i>or <i>The Pink Album</i>.  The songs themselves didn't get any shorter or less intense, but they feel significantly less edified. When the charmingly animated video for ""Seven"" ran on ""120 Minutes"", it never felt <i>too </i>out of place regardless of whether it led into Jawbox or Pearl Jam, but <i>LP2</i> tended to veer more towards the obscure. It certainly didn't help that the packaging itself contained no artwork other than its entirely pink cover or lyric sheet. And compared to <i>Diary</i>'s untouchable opening triad, that of <i>LP2 </i>was bound to pale, and you feel like SDRE is playing it overly self-aware-- ""Friday"", ""Theo B"", and ""Red Elephant"" each would've been the shortest track on <i>Diary</i>, save for its near-interlude ""Phuerton Skeurto"". ""Friday"" starts <i>LP2 </i>with the kind of risky, slippery melody that all but screams ""difficult follow-up."" The high-wired guitars of ""8"" introduce damn near atonality, the kind of chords an amateur bangs out on a piano, but soon they become the backbone of the record's most muscular number.</p>
<p>It's easy to project the idea that this was a band dissolving personally and musically from the inside-out if you know the history, but the music itself is every bit as ghostly on its own-- even beyond the threadbare arrangements, Enigk has said that many lyrics were left unfinished or sung as gibberish. <i>LP2 </i>certainly has more than its share of moments, but in the context of SDRE's artistic arc, a time when they wanted to be Shudder To Think instead of arena-fillers can feel like a bridge to nowhere.</p>
<p>And that was pretty much it for the classic lineup of SDRE-- the rhythm section would play on Foo Fighters' <i>The Colour and the Shape</i>, a record whose brickwalled dynamics and gleaming-edge guitar arguably did just as much to determine the actual <i>sound</i> of modern radio rock as Sunny Day or even producer Gil Norton's work with the Pixies.

Elephant Six effectively closed shop in 2002 and many of its flagship acts appear to have dropped off the radar. Granted, it seems Robert Schneider will never stop wringing giddiness out of the Apples in Stereo and one-time second-tier player Kevin Barnes has found a highly rewarding, well-deserved second-wind with his long-lived group of Montreal. But let's not forget that the whole effort began on the backs of childhood chums Schneider, Jeff Mangum, Bill Doss, and gregarious ringleader Will Cullen Hart. In this decade, Hart has dealt with a life-changing diagnosis, so it's a happy surprise that his new <i>Signal Morning</i> saw completion at all.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the Golden Age of the lo-fi 90s, Schneider indulged his Beach Boys fetish in the Apples and Mangum sculpted his Dylan insecurities into the now mythic Neutral Milk Hotel, while Hart swashbuckled with Doss a Zorro Z (or Psychedelic P) across the prevailing rock sphere with the Olivia Tremor Control. Closer to Hart's sensibilities was his subsequent project Circulatory System, a more serene group largely composed of the same OTC players, minus co-collaborator Bill Doss, which focused on some of the lusher and more experiment-laden textures often found near the stumbletine end of an Olivia Tremor Control record. But following the celebrated self-titled debut and a CD-R, Circulatory System took seven mysterious years off, the only noise being made by an Olivia Tremor Control reunion mini-tour.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In late 2008, Hart revealed that one reason for the layoff was his struggle with the diagnosis and symptoms of multiple sclerosis. The disease had affected his mood and energy in recent years <span>and continues to interrupt his artistic output</span>, <span>but </span>careful management of the disease may allow Hart years of asymptomatic life, Thus the understandably delayed <i>Signal Morning</i>, the group's second proper full-length, enters an indie music culture quickly forgetting the indelible mark made by the Elephant 6. Nevermind that <i>en vogue</i> lo-fi groups like No Age, Wavves, and Deerhunter built their philosophy of bedroom experimentalism at least partly on Hart's gauze-wrapped template.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With <i>Signal Morning</i>, however, Hart picks up pretty much right where he left off-- maybe even reaching back to OTC. As ""This Morning (We Remembered Everything)"" rolls along, cellos churn ahead of grating guitars and what sounds like a mellotron, constantly wobbling off kilter picking itself up, dusting itself off and always managing not to devolve into complete chaos (or at least, not for long). <span>Likewise, </span>Hart's lyrics have always been infamous for their tendency to invite the listener into a<span> </span>Gondry-esquepact <span>of make-believe</span>. ""We"", ""us"" and ""you"" must be the most common words in Hart's palette, and they splay in full display with scattered lines like ""We still make up this world as we go along"" on ""Particle Parades"". The record's melodic songcraft, inventive yet reflective, tumbles out so effortlessly that it's almost an afterthought. Hart and his co-collaborators fashion a shambling take on psychedelic rock, flaunting experimental production that was undoubtedly intricate yet never burdened by professionalism. Think George Martin or Brian Wilson in tatters.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The more compact psych-rock delivery mechanism of the Olivia Tremor Control imbues</span><i>Signal Morning</i> hits with a breakneck pace of ideas, matching the Circulatory System's scale (which sometimes threw in sixty or more concurrent tracks). Sure, the last record noodled around with short, dense tracks just as <i>Signal </i>does, but it found its grounding in fully formed pieces like ""Yesterday's World"", ""The Lovely Universe"", and ""Waves of Bark and Light"". By contrast, ""Particle Parades"", ""Round Again"", and ""Signal Morning"" spin delicious ellipses, developing verses or riffs only to throw them out for stylistic shifts sometimes multiple times in a work.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That's <i>Signal Morning</i>'s greatest strength: It's a supremely busy record that at the same time doesn't sound fussed over. When the record's been seven years in the making, it's easy to assume that the output has been over-designed (see: <i>Chinese Democracy</i>), but <i>Signal</i> rings fresh. Will Hart's health might hinder his further musical output, and of course no one would deny that his priorities lie in managing his illness, but perhaps the most reassuring aspect of the record that Hart is still able to share one more piece of his gleefully damaged vision. Then again, you never know-- the E6 logo has been showing up on more than a few record covers these days, and one of the most exciting effects of the original Golden Age was that it begat a Renaissance.</p></div>"|13171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13171-signal-morning/|8.1|Mike Orme

Vocalists are good. Filler is bad. Hooks are a must. Nods to underground sounds must not alienate the unfamiliar. And an approach to genre that ranges somewhere from ""catholic"" to ""aggressively eclectic"" is the only way to hold the attention of the uncommitted.</p>
<p>Sure, judged by those increasingly out-of-date album-qua-album standards, <i>Temporary Pleasure</i> is something of a mess. It doesn't ""flow."" Sonically, SMD sticks to the neon thread that runs from the glittering prizes of 1980s synth-pop through Latin freestyle roller-skating jams and on into the earliest house and techno whose smiley-faced exterior wooed radio programmers. <i>TP</i> feels like 10 distinct singles, each pastiching a slightly different side of well-trod retro-modern electronic/club culture, connected by an album title and little else. And the disparity in quality between those singles can be pretty stark.</p>
<p>The album also lacks the immediate replay value of the best pop craftsmanship, the kind of choruses, breakdowns, or random spine-tingling musical asides that make you rewind a track before it's finished to relive the shiver all over again. Sure, even the most uninspired femme diva material (cf. Beth Ditto doing her best bedroom-mirror Crystal Waters on the somnambulant ""Cruel Intentions"") on <i>Temporary Pleasure</i> never irritates like ""Poker Face"". Young Fathers' skills on ""Turn Up the Dial"" surely best anything Flo Rida's farted out in the last 24 months. But you also can't picture a single SMD song besting <i>Billboard</i>'s current kings when it comes to the kind of dance-pop that works as well on drive-time Top 40 as it does during a club's peak hours. Less irritating than Lady Gaga or ""Low"" is one thing, but SMD would still pale next to fellow 80s fetishist The-Dream's lesser efforts.</p>
<p>At their worst, SMD's turns toward ""songwriting"" are crass and half-assed at once, slapdash stuff that points out the mix of sweat and inspiration that goes into even the most effortless-seeming bubblegum. A truly terrible song, ""Audacity of Huge"" dares you to make it through Yeasayer's Chris Keating pulling on an ill-fitting sassy diva costume and snapping his way through an increasingly ridiculous big-spender shtick. (Swimming pool filled with grape Kool-Aid, mother-of-pearl oyster fork, bio-diesel dirigible, et friggin' cetera.) The song is a reminder of why so much electroclash stiffed on impact: A guest vocalist and sarcastic high-life signifiers do not a sure-shot jukebox hit make.</p>
<p>Not so shockingly, <i>Temporary Pleasures</i> delivers more reliably on its title when it sticks to straight-up dance. ""Synthesise"" is a fierce little slice of hyper-compressed gospel-techno, somewhere between an abstract Blaze belter and Justice at their less intentionally abrasive. ""Ambulance"" is a slow-burning accumulation of acid squiggles and Emergency Broadcast System sirens that stays just on the pleasing side of shrill.</p>
<p>But throw on SMD's best (old) single, ""It's the Beat"". Listen to how the track builds and maintains interest with good old inhuman techno building blocks-- nagging bleep, a few overlapping synth squiggles. The sampled snatches of rap are useful punctuation, but the track wouldn't collapse without them. It becomes clear that for a distressingly large chunk of <i>Temporary Pleasures</i>, the duo has forgotten to do much of interest with the <i>backing tracks</i> in favor of roping in a rolodex's worth of singers and rappers and hoping the songs write themselves. Yeah, Technotronic had Ya Kid K. But what everyone <i>really</i> remembers is those riffs.</p></div>"|13420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13420-temporary-pleasure/|6.5|Jess Harvell

Seriously, check it out on Google Earth some time. A multi-tiered waterfall in a dark glen on the slopes of Mount Hood in Oregon, it's one of those endlessly photographable landforms that makes you want to be there any time you see a shot of it. As a sort of shorthand for the natural majesty of the Pacific Northwest, the name works well for Portland's Ramona Falls, aka Brent Knopf of Menomena and a huge cast of his friends. In fact, of the various Menomena side projects, this is the one that most matches that band in terms of both sound and quality, paying meticulous attention to sonic and compositional details to emerge with a record full of memorable surprises.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Sometimes it's just an unexpected element that mails a song all the way home, like the impromptu choir that suddenly emerges from the acoustic guitar and spaciously recorded drums of ""Bellyfulla"" or the unbelievably gorgeous violin part that shines like a vibrant light from the center of ""Russia"". The violin melody interacts with the chord sequence to grow more aching by the second and turns a decent song into one you can't forget. Knopf is piano player and programmer for Menomena, and he comes up with some wild stuff here, especially on ""Always Right"", where he sticks you with these bizarre, stuttering phrases for the odd-metered verses. It's offset by big choruses and a strange Eastern European-ish bridge with a carnivalesque atmosphere. More simple is ""Boy Ant"", a short piano instrumental with a sense of melody derived more from traditional European songs like ""Edelweiss"" than anything in contemporary pop sphere.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Any Menomena fan will recognize Knopf's voice, which is a delicate instrument-- it's not rangy, but he knows his capabilities and uses them. He gives himself a bit of electronic assistance on ""I Say Fever"", falling down a processing rabbit hole on the title refrain, which precipitates a sudden downpour of heavy guitar. Sleater-Kinney's Janet Weiss provides the song's pounding rhythmic floor, but Knopf's own piano gives it its funky stride. Knopf's solo songs share with Menomena an ear for contrast--""Going Once, Going Twice"" swings between easy-flowing passages and lurching sections that build tension for the next rhythmic release.<i></i></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>Intuit</i>, a word that nicely serves as a homophone for ""Into It"", works as a title for the album because it so neatly seems to describe the writing process-- very few of the odd shifts and unexpected turns in the songs sound contrived or forced. Down to the cover art, it feels like a strong echo of everything great about Knopf's primary band. There are no cut-outs or flipbooks, but Theo Ellsworth's elaborate, grotesque illustrations are worth taking in-- they're like a combination of <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>, a fever dream, a pagan woodland ceremony, and a notebook doodle. The music is worth taking in, too, over and over again.</p></div>"|13418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13418-intuit/|8.0|Joe Tangari

But we don't live in a vacuum. BLK JKS-- <i>Fader</i> cover stars  before releasing a lick of music in the U.S.-- have been introduced  as a savior of sorts with a zippy hook: ""African TV on the Radio.""  That's a fool's game and that much was clear the minute the swirl  started. So they will be judged (probably not all that well) against  the strains of expectation. But that's too bad because <i>After Robots</i>,  produced by the Secret Machines' Brandon Curtis, is a hugely ambitious  album, with swooping forays into kwaito, ska, reggae, ambience, jazz,  prog, and furor. It's not always great-- the band has a tendency to  let its best ideas get the best of them-- but there is a bigness of  sound that is hard to approximate. And even harder to control.</p>
<p>The band was discovered, in  part, by (who else?) Diplo-- who came up with the ""African TVOTR""  tag-- while touring in South Africa in 2008. One year later, during  their second trip to America, Curtis dragged them to Electric Lady Studios  to begin recording <i>After Robots</i>. The enormity of sound-- often  a loose-limbed rumble and shout-- always starts out well. ""Molalatladi""  is a full-on revival by minute one, roiling with a brass section, guitar  solos, a sloppily mixed clatter of percussion and chants on high of  ""Away, away ah-ho."" But it tumbles and tumbles on, climbing and  climbing, for nearly four minutes and then it peters out. There's  a lot of sparks and smoke, but few fireworks.</p>
<p>This is a strange band, one  minute rivaling the Mars Volta in bombast, the next prettily strumming  about like Vampire Weekend's bolder, authenticated friends. Vocalist  Lindani Buthelezi has a voice that sounds heroic when swathed in reverb,  which hides some of the deficiencies, but his songs are often shrouded.  He sings here in English, Zulu, and Xhosa, mixing and matching  dialects on songs, turning moments of revelation on ""Molalatladi""  into opaque reflections. When  things are slow and allowed to unfurl, as on the dub-inspired ""Skeleton"",  guitarist Mpumi Mcata is able to stretch his singed chords out and Buthelezi  sounds more lucid. Closer ""Tselane"" finds the band stripping away  all but an acoustic guitar, and suddenly Buthelezi's quick-tongued  lilt reveals a wide-eyed hopefulness. But only on the breezy psych-out  ""Lakeside"" do BLK JKS fulfill promise. The vocal harmonies are tucked  deeper into the mix, the guitar tones are gorgeously bright, the crescendo  hits at the perfect moment. It isn't TV on the Radio-- BLK JKS don't  seem to have the same knack for clarity at the right time-- but they  make a powerful noise.</p>
<p>That <i>After Robots</i> has  been released just a scant few weeks after the runaway success of the  politically-tinged South African sci-fi glopfest, <i>District 9</i>,  is fitting. The intersection of hype, payoff and muddled message is  a unique coincidence of South African cultural currents. And just as  there is both hope and fear for director Neill Blomkamp's follow-up,  BLK JKS have some refining-- and maybe a bigger budget-- to work on  next time around.</p></div>"|13401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13401-after-robots/|6.2|Sean Fennessey

For all of us who fell for their 2008 debut, there were just as many others who cried foul. Boy, did they cry. ""The singing is flat!"" ""I heard this in the 80s when it was better!"" And, of course, that most classic of put-downs: ""They can't even play their instruments!"" Such criticisms miss the point. We are talking about punk music, after all, and since when did studied musicianship become a prerequisite there? And frankly these are the same folks who will tell you that a band like Dirty Projectors is too pointillist, too proggy, too <i>musical</i>, so apparently there's a golden medium somewhere that I'm unaware of. So let's focus on the important stuff: Is this band doing something interesting? Do their songs sound good?</p>
<p>On last year's <i>Vivian Girls</i>, the answer to those questions was a simple yes. Tell me ""Where Do You Run To"" and ""Tell the World"" aren't great pop tracks and I'll argue you until I'm blue in the face. But, sure, there were probably other factors at play in their success. The timing was ideal, for one. Vivian Girls arrived at the onset of the lo-fi resurgence-- a point when hazy guitar pop wasn't quite so, um, prominent, and when the mention of ""shitgaze"" would elicit an eyebrow raise instead of an eye roll. A year and what feels like hundreds of scuzzy records later, the band faces a thorny task with their sophomore LP, <i>Everything Goes Wrong</i>. Lo-fi fatigue has officially set in for many listeners, and fair or not, it feels like the band has to fight off a backlash not only against themselves but also against the genre they represent.</p>
<p>That's a lot of pressure to put on a group that seems principally interested in playing quick-and-dirty punk rock songs about things like boys and love and loneliness. And <i>Everything Goes Wrong</i> generally falls in line with those simple goals. It's not a record that aims for the rafters or seeks to win over the band's haters and fence sitters. (Much less prove the worth of the whole lo-fi <i>movement</i>, if such a thing exists.) In fact, it's so straightforward and largely enjoyable that it kind of sidesteps the whole notion of the anticipated follow-up all together.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Everything Goes Wrong</i> almost feels more like a third record than a second. There are no dramatic missteps, no weird forays into krautrock, just a batch of mostly solid rock cuts. But there are notable differences between this album and its predecessor. Part of what made <i>Vivian Girls</i> so appealing (and ultimately divisive) was its synthesis of influences-- Spector pop, the C86 stuff, shoegaze, it was all in there. But the band was always quick to shrug off those inspirations (""I actually don't like shoegaze at all"", drummer Ali Koehler once told me in an interview), and there is markedly less pop-canon pastiche this time around. If they're drawing on any particular genre now it's the thrashy hardcore they grew up on; the sound here is decidedly more aggressive (or at least faster) than before. Ramped-up rpms on ""I Have No Fun"" and ""The Desert"" are welcome, and standout ""Survival"" finds a sweet spot by combining it with sugary melodic verses.</p>
<p>The move away from bubblegum-sticky garage rock towards classically inspired punk works both for and against the band here. On one hand the sound feels more their own, but the subtraction of some those doo-wop hooks, along with the record's darker, more somber tone makes for fewer instantly memorable moments. The band finds eventually finds its comfort zone, though. They do so on ""Double Vision"", a four-minute (!) jangle-pop cut that ends in a lovely group-sung coda, and ""The End"", the song that most closely resembles 80s blues-punk greats Gun Club, whose inspiration, if not purposefully sought after, looms large on the record. But <i>Everything Goes Wrong</i>'s best track is also its strangest: ""Tension"" is Vivian Girls gone art-punk, and with its spiky choruses yanked from dirge-y tar pit sludge, it feels somehow like a Wire song covered in muck (a compliment, of course).</p>
<p>And that's the funny thing about this album: It's weirdly kind of a grower. There's nothing that immediately jumps out and announces itself as the ""Where Do You Run"" of <i>Everything Goes Wrong</i>. Some of that has to do with the gloomier vibe of the record; its pleasures are less upfront, sneakier in a way. But under the radar is a good look for Vivian Girls in 2009, and hopefully it adds a bit more nuance to the discussion surrounding them.</p></div>"|13395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13395-everything-goes-wrong/|7.8|Joe Colly

Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Tom Zé, Rogerio Duprat, Gal Costa, and the others weren't exactly oldsters themselves during the movement's brief heyday, but they all carried themselves with a degree of seriousness and projected themselves as artists in a way Rita Lee and brothers Sérgio Dias and Arnaldo Baptista never did and perhaps even couldn't. The trio that named itself the Mutants attacked rock'n'roll with rebellious, gleeful abandon, using homemade effects pedals and layering on wacky sound effects to cover up the bits of their songs the Brazilian military censors found most offensive. Their five albums together still sound vital and exciting today, but Lee left in 1972 and the brothers-- and ultimately just Sérgio Dias-- carried on until 1978.</p>
<p>That period of Os Mutantes isn't well-known outside of Brazil, but suffice to say it hasn't aged as well. They were as prone to prog excess as any psych band that survived past 1970, and though their music retained its wild spirit and Brazilian character, it also got tighter, more bombastic, and less infectious. Their last studio album came out 35 years ago, and Os Mutantes were a memory until 2006, when Baptista and Dias got back on stage with Zélia Duncan standing in for Rita Lee. Baptista and Duncan both appeared on the band's quality 2007 live album, but both were gone by the time <i>Haih</i> was recorded, and Dias reached out to a couple of old Tropicália warriors, Jorge Ben and Tom Zé, for a hand writing the songs. Zé co-wrote six songs with Dias, and he proves a sympathetic partner, turning in a salad of modern imagery, biting satire, and pointed commentary for the band to sing (in Portuguese, I should add-- nothing apart from bits of ""Neurociência Do Amor"" and ""Samba do Fidel"" is sung in English on this record).</p>
<p>The music is kaleidoscopically varied, sounding sonically like a descendant of the band's late-period records but a little closer in spirit and vigor to their 60s output. You get manic rumba on the jokingly titled Zé co-write ""Samba do Fidel"", which tackles the Western Hemisphere's complex left-right politics through the perspective of Brazil's social problems, slyly sprinkling in references to Carmen Miranda and American corporate imperialism with the lines ""Chiquita banana I love you,"" and ""Yes, we have McBananas."" The brazen lampoon of sitting Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva strikingly illustrates how much easier it is to be in a Brazilian rock band today than it was from 1965 to 1978. ""2000 e Agarrum"" begins as pretty basic accordion-driven samba rock with a cartoonishly nasal lead vocal but swerves into a sweeping chorus, a morass of psychedelic carnival music and lounge lizard Latin pop.</p>
<p>There are flourishes of non-Brazilian ethnic music, including the chunky oud riffs that open ""Teclar"" and the Arab cabaret swagger of ""Baghdad Blues"", which mixes historical stereotypes of the Middle East with imagistic anti-war commentary that never descends to accusation. New female vocalist Bia Mendes plays closer to a Rita Lee role than Zélia Duncan ever did, but she still gets in a few forceful moments-- her boisterous belting on ""Querida Querida"" as the band rocks out behind her might even be a little too forceful, and there are passages of the song that rock too generically. The band mostly keeps the passages of boilerplate funk and rock to a minimum, though, and the most straightforward rock song on the album, ""O Mensageiro"" is even a little jangly-- it's what a Brazilian R.E.M. might sound like until the heavy guitar solo comes in.</p>
<p>The transition to that song from the Jorge Ben-penned Tropicália throwback ""O Careca"" is unintentionally the most jarring segue on an album well-populated with abrupt and unexpected turns. My primary complaint is that <i>Haih</i> could have used a more open sound-- a looser approach to recording might have let some of the music's natural wildness out to play, where it sometimes feels reigned in or stifled. <i>Haih</i> is just as weird as their older albums; it's just weird in a much more polished way. All in all though, it's good to hear a new Os Mutantes record that carries forward the ideals and exploratory spirit that made us all love the band in the first place, even if it won't ever supplant those classic early albums.</p></div>"|13391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13391-haih-or-amortecedor/|7.0|Joe Tangari

Their first few releases, which dabbled in electronic ambience, heavy-beat IDM, and fractured funk, were too schizophrenic to fit the moniker. But on their fourth album, <i>As Good as Gone, </i>the group sticks to gentle pushes and soft prods-- the kind that don't disturb or bruise, but are impossible to ignore. Their sounds approach slowly and rub against each other cautiously. The music is rarely sparse, and often quite full and busy, but there's no jostling for position. Everything interacts carefully, with a tap on the shoulder rather than a shove.</p>
<p>What makes that M.O.<i> </i>so hypnotic is the way Nudge applies it to both structured songs and abstract explorations with equal effectiveness. Beat-less opener ""Harmo"" collects wafting synths, tinkling percussion, and soaring hums into a thick web. That's followed by the album's tightest cut, ""Two Hands"", a simmering hymn with dubby bass, jazzy drums, and singer Honey Owens' ethereal musings. Yet there's no tonal conflict between the two tracks. Instead they sound like two sides of a coin, exuding one confident, chilled-out vibe.</p>
<p>Given their pedigree, it figures that Nudge's approach is versatile. Owens comes from the amorphous collective Jackie-O Motherfucker, and records rangy music as Valet. Leader Brian Foote was in the bubbling post-Jessamine ensemble Fontanelle; so was Paul Dickow, aka genre-straddling solo artist Strategy. Mixing together that many creative juices could cause a surplus of ideas that blur or cancel each other out. But no moment on <i>As Good as Gone </i>sounds crowded, and the best tracks build intensity with simple tools. On ""Aurolac"", minimal beats and Joy Division-esque bass escalate to a climax, while on ""Burns Blue"" Foote's moans rise like a spirit floating above its body. The band repeats and varies these elements constantly, like characters in a play. It all culminates in epic closer ""Dawn Comes Light"", a long journey from lonely guitar up to storm-cloud drones.</p>
<p>The only complaint I can imagine being lodged against this album is a stock criticism often thrown at Kranky records-- that its devout commitment to texture and atmosphere makes it more admirable than engaging, more studied than lived-in. In other words, sterile. But such accusations could result only from surface skimming. Dig deep, and the blood coursing through these tracks-- the insistent bass lines, the impulsive percussion, the stirring voices-- is clear. That's why <i>As Good as Gone </i>is Nudge's best album so far, the kind of record that indicates a band has found its signature sound, and is poised to deepen and expand it.</p></div>"|13410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13410-as-good-as-gone/|7.7|Marc Masters

Derek Fudesco, late of much missed incandescent emoters Pretty Girls Make Graves, and a crew of fellow Pac Northwest facial hair enthusiasts got together a couple years back to make an EP and then later an LP, 2007's <i>Invitation Songs</i>, of ultracasual folk, floaty and freewheeling but tossed off and only fleetingly memorable. Given Fudesco's hyperkinetic pop pedigree, this new thing seemed an oddly easygoing showcase for his formidable chops, like one of those dreadful early-90s Jerry Garcia/David Grisman albums that announced on the cover they were recorded over a weekend. The Cave Singers just seemed like a band who'd have to get real good real fast or probably wouldn't feel the need to do what they'd done already; that lark thing again.</p>
<p>Yet here we have <i>Welcome Joy</i>, their second long-player in just shy of two years, so if this is all a goof, this bunch has an enviable amount of time to screw around. It's yet another fine and mellow set of twangy, slightly tart folk rockers, warm but patchy like a farmer's tan. Lead singer Pete Quirk's amber voice is wavering and grainy as ever, and the tunes roll by nice and easy like a pickup rattling down a country road. But from the wide open arrangements to the tug'n'tumble of Fudesco's picking to Quirk's reedy bleats never quite congealing into memorable ditties, <i>Welcome Joy</i> does precious little to distinguish itself from its predecessor.</p>
<p>These tunes seem like they'd fall over in a strong enough breeze, and with songs rarely composed of more than the wispy lilt of the guitar and Quirk's slightly droll drawlery, there's not always enough to catch your ear over the whirr of the boxfan. Quirk's behind-the-beat delivery is certainly the band's strongest suit, but combined with those rusty pipes, he tends to swallow syllables whole, rendering lyrics more than occasionally indecipherable. That might be for the best, actually, given the hippy-dippy pastoralism of the odd word or two that does slip out. Fudesco's fingerwork, a product of his Pac NW upbringing, is impressively unfettered, but he adds the same little bump in the road to nearly every tune, which wears with time; at least Modest Mouse had the good sense to make only ""Wild Packs of Family Dogs"" weird, and make it only once.</p>
<p>So not only is <i>Welcome Joy</i> nearly identical in tone and texture to what they've done in the past, you start hearing echoes of songs you swear you'd just finished as soon as it slides into the next; how is ""Summer Light"" not ""Hen of the Woods"", or, really, not <i>Invitation Songs</i> opener ""Seeds of Night"" either? The set's best tune, its title track, arrives at the end, and it's hard to tell whether it's simply a more gripping melody than what came before it, or just better due to the rough hewn feel of its demo-like presentation. The even keel can be comforting or numbing depending on your mood, but either way, it's not a sound that'd grab anybody with <i>Music From Big Pink</i> or even the <i>Sun Giant</i> EP on their shelf already. The Cave Singers' mild, moseying tunes aren't without their minor charms, and they're unfailingly good at conjuring images of wide-open fields and dust-caked lanes, but nobody wants to walk down the same road all the time if they can help it.</p></div>"|13416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13416-welcome-joy/|5.1|Paul Thompson

Oh demon longevity! These twin curses can plague any decades-old band in an age when careers are measured in months. Yo La Tengo can count themselves in the rare company of this group, elder statespeople operating in a genre where they're influence-grandparents. And alongside peers Sonic Youth and the Flaming Lips, YLT have to operate under the bane of their own consistency at a time when the new and a compelling narrative are over-celebrated. All three of those bands have reached a steady state where reinvention is unnecessary: They're so frequently good they don't even get a redemption story. Hell, <i>Wavves</i> already is set up for one of those.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as Yo La Tengo celebrate a quarter-century of existence with <i>Popular Songs</i>, their twelfth album, there's still plenty to like without a PR push. The Yo La Tengo repertoire has expanded steadily over the years, and the genre experiments of years past have slowly assimilated into their creative process until it's hard to remember the mere Velvets-jacking indie pop band they once were. The easy way to draw fickle attention to your dozenth album would be a drastic makeover, but Yo La Tengo are wise enough to choose continuity over the easy angle. And as far flung as these dozen <i>Popular Songs</i> may be, any Yo La Tengo scholar can easily trace their DNA back through their discography.</p>
<p>Now, forget I said all that for a moment, as the opening track and single, ""Here to Fall"", is the exception to the rule. Nearly guitarless, with a menacing electric piano and cinematic strings lifted from an Isaac Hayes soundtrack, it's an ear-catcher for anyone expecting the same old same old. If there's an antecedent here, it's the treasured ""Autumn Sweater"", but beaten and wary and a little dangerous, Ira Kaplan refusing to play the kindly, reassuring grandfather: ""I know you're worried/ I'm worried too.""</p>
<p>But it's a darkness that quickly lifts. ""Avalon or Someone Very Similar"" is upper-register psychedelia, dreamy and chipper. And when the drony keyboards and hazed-out Georgia Hubley vocals combine on ""By Two's"", we're safely back on familiar ground-- in this case the late-night dream cycle of A<i>nd Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out</i>, arguably the band's last unmitigated success.</p>
<p>Some will surely find the return trip to that well a welcome reprise, others a tired retread-- pick your side and know whether you will Enjoy This Album. Because there are more historical echoes here, particularly in how Yo La can crank out a fuzz-pop anthem (""Nothing to Hide"") or fragile, vaguely-countrified indie pop (""When It's Dark"", James McNew's ""I'm on My Way"") in their sleep. Fortunately, they don't phone it in on those tracks, and slip ‘em into <i>I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One</i> and most people wouldn't know the difference.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the band indulges its expanded palette by riffing on Motown, funk, and organ-boogie (not sure how else to classify ""Periodically Double or Triple""), as they've been doing off and on for most of the decade. For most bands, the costume-swapping would be a novelty act, but Yo La Tengo, who prove their cover-band chops every year on WFMU, have hung these sounds permanently in their closet by this point. ""If It's True"" is pure Funk Brothers karaoke complete with a spot-on bridge and AM-radio strings, but Hubley and Kaplan's back-and-forth duet is too adorable to nit-pick.</p>
<p>After nine tracks, the only thing missing would be the usual YLT epic, and well, the band doesn't disappoint. In an odd bit of sequencing, all the long tracks are clumped together at the end, forming a trilogy of nine-minute-plus jams with wildly varying results. ""More Stars Than There Are in Heaven"" is the only one that could have slipped into the front half of the album unnoticed, a gorgeously unspooling meditation that suits its ethereal title. But the stark acoustic riff that makes up most of ""The Fireside"" is interminable, and ""And the Glitter Is Gone"" is 16 minutes of the usual Kaplan noise-skronk that will tempt all but the most devoted YLT fans to cut the album short.</p>
<p>Thanks to whoever pushed them to the back, those missteps are easily ignored, leaving a 10-track record (of a more reasonable length) that can compete with anything since the band's heyday. It's easy to overlook the sound that's on display through the bulk of <i>Popular Songs</i> as more of the same, but it's also uniquely Yo La Tengo in a way that has taken 25 years to reach vintage status. Experience can be a crutch, an excuse to tread water in comfortable waters. But <i>Popular Songs</i> wears its age well, a calm but firm reminder of an indie rock perennial it's all too easy to take for granted.</p></div>"|13413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13413-popular-songs/|7.9|Rob Mitchum

But the sudden, surprising return of Polvo (or, at least three quarters of its original line-up) after a 12-year absence does not adhere to any of these scripts. As a band that bridged late-80s SST-schooled indie-rock and more abstract, angular 90s math-rock, Polvo's legacy feels very much frozen in time-- they're not a band whose influence is especially apparent among contemporary indie-rock acts; their popularity never extended beyond the campus-radio crowd; and there's no juicy back-story to propagate their myth. They were simply a very good band that made some very good records, and then just plain stopped.</p>
<p>But Polvo's first album in 12 years presents a different kind of reunion rationale-- one that's less about extending a legacy as rewriting it. Like Hüsker Dü, the Minutemen, and Sonic Youth before them, Polvo reached their critical peak with an epic double-album statement, 1996's <i>Exploded Drawing</i>, which saw them successfully unraveling their bee-swarm guitar buzz to explore the polarities of their sound, from psychedelic-folk lullabies to brutalizing post-hardcore. But instead of answering their <i>Daydream Nation</i> with their <i>Goo</i> (i.e., a more streamlined, approachable set), Polvo took a hard left on 1997's <i>Shapes</i>, a hodgepodge of contorted classic-rock riffage and fractured-folk interludes that, in hindsight, anticipated the current vogue for <i>Arthur</i>-endorsed new-school psychedelia, but at the time felt like a directionless drift into the unknown, one from which Polvo never returned. Until now.</p>
<p><i>In Prism</i> thus feels like an attempt to chart an alternate course for Polvo post-<i>Exploded Drawing</i>, in which the band harnesses its psychedelicized sprawl into a precise, laser-focused tracklist, where even the eight-minute excursions feel brisk and purposeful. Ten years of recording-technology advances also means that Polvo has never sounded more radiant; liberated from the murky, mid-fi production of the band's older records, Ash Bowie emerges as a forceful, almost swaggering vocalist on <i>In Prism</i>'s blast-off opener ""Right the Relation"", which, despite its cryptic allusions to Polvo's history and ethos (""We see the beauty behind imperfection... I kill my creation to right the relation"") is the band's most forthright, unfussy rocker to date. And, if this were 1997, you could easily imagine ""Beggar's Bowl"" becoming the band's crossover calling card on alt-rock radio, thanks to seismic, Led Zep-like convulsions and an uncharacteristically funky ""Another One Bites the Dust""-style break that showcases the muscular time-keeping of new drummer Brian Quast. Remarkably, Polvo achieve these breakthroughs without sacrificing any of their signatures, such as spastic structural shifts and eerie, spidery guitar leads where you can feel the strings bend. They've just organized them in such a way that their aggressive and melodic impulses complement rather than fight against each other.</p>
<p>Of course, you'd expect a new Polvo album to deliver at least a couple of corkers. But where <i>In Prism</i> truly distinguishes itself-- not just as a surprisingly good reunion album, but also as the most immediately satisfying front-to-back album in the entire Polvo catalogue-- is in its quieter, headier stretches. Where the extended running times of ""D.C. Trails"" (6:57) and ""Lucia"" (8:15) may seem to indulge the band's old free-form tendencies, each is carefully constructed on an upward arc: the former cruises on a pleasingly lysergic jangle-pop tip before climaxing with a fireworks-worthy guitar jam; the diregy, doom-metal build up of ""Lucia"" makes the song's sudden transition into a melancholic, tambourine-rattled pop song all the more effective and affecting. <i>In Prism </i>could be the first Polvo album where the melodies leave as lasting an impression as the noise around them, with Bowie tapping into a more guileless mode of expression that rarely revealed itself before.</p>
<p>It's only during the prolonged middle breakdown of the drifty, eight-minute closer ""A Link in the Chain"" that <i>In Prism</i> acquires an air of ponderousness. But by that point, Polvo's comeback coronation has been handily earned. If no one was really asking for a new Polvo album at the start 2009, <i>In Prism</i>'s dreamy discord feels perfectly in tune with that of contemporary psychedelic iconoclasts like Deerhunter. And if Polvo's reformation initially defied the traditional logic for indie-rock reunions, <i>In Prism</i> ultimately sets a new standard for them: don't just make it sound like you never left, but rather make the past seem like a mere warm-up for what's to come.</p></div>"|13398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13398-in-prism/|8.1|Stuart Berman

Sure, the Norwegian duo has its eye-rolling moments about night flights to Uranus or dancing with their daddies, but they also sport some of the slickest dance production in the biz, not to mention their effortless traversing between neurotic post-punk licks and coked-to-the-gills 1980s synth pop. While convention would say sophomore LP <i>Red</i> will have its share of ""growing up"" moments, there's already something artistically mature and high-concept about two guys jury-rigging their own sub-genre of kitsch disco to one-up the legions of more ""serious"" Talking Heads/Eno knock-offs floating around today. <i>Red</i> isn't exactly austere, but its lapses into wistfulness jolt Fredrik Saroea and Ketil Mosnes out of the bizarre but stable niche they carved out on their 2005 debut.</p>
<p>As a quick glance at the track listing shows, Datarock's going pop on <i>Red</i>, boiling their songs down to a compact three minutes rather than going nuts with the dramatic dancefloor builds. These songs also have premises beyond shouting goofy shibboleths. There's a song consisting entirely of Talking Heads song titles (""True Stories""), an electro metal album opener about the Internet (""The Blog""), and a chilly kraut-funk apostrophe to Molly Ringwald (""Molly""), to name a few. While the lyrical craft here ain't exactly Dylan-esque, the duo shows off a level of cleverness that previously tended to level-off at wordplay and dick jokes.</p>
<p>The (minor) drawback: Datarock didn't have to dumb things down this much to become catchier. While tightly wound tracks like ""Give It Up"" or ""Dance!"" bring the energy, they're the kind of easy-to-swallow electropop hipness you can get from, like, Chromeo, which isn't a bad thing, just that Datarock's usually a lot tougher to pin down than that. To their credit, though, there are also flashes of songs I didn't think the band could pull off. ""Back in the Seventies"" backs up its gushing nostalgia with crisply replicated plastic soul, and aforementioned ""The Blog"" soups up the headbanging outro from previous standout ""Princess"", creating an apocalyptic maelstrom of fuzzy bass riffs and soundbytes of computer pundits talking about the Internet.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Datarock Datarock</i> cooled down with two overlooked but nonetheless solid IDM tracks, but on <i>Red</i> the duo's softer side gets a lot more shine. ""Amarillion"" would sound at home on <i>Saturdays=Youth</i>, a John Hughes-y serenade full of watery guitars and shout-outs to girl-ensnaring junior high mixtape staples like ""Take On Me"" and ""(I Just) Died in Your Arms"". ""Fear of Death"" is an equally zealous 80s tribute, lifting lines from Don DeLillo's <i>White Noise</i> and chord progressions from Robert Smith to produce a stinging existential ballad.</p>
<p>While it's tough not to notice the ""Fa Fa Fa"" or ""I Used to Dance with My Daddy""-sized holes in <i>Red</i>, you can't fault the band too much. After all, their frenetic songs sound perfect for all those video game and TV spots they've netted, and no energy's been lost in the transition from writing club-friendlier music to more conventional pop structures. <i>Red</i> contains no clunkers, only lukewarm forays that further convince me this band can nail any sound they want, cheekiness be damned. If the songwriting ever catches up with the stellar production and performance, they could name their next album <i>2 Girls 1 Cup</i>, and people would be too blown away to care.</p></div>"|13207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13207-red/|7.2|Adam Moerder

The Omaha trio honored instead the insect that infested the childhood home of two of its members, brothers Clayton and Jeremiah McIntyre. It's an easy pit for a music nerd to stumble into, but aside from the tape hiss, the McIntyres' band share little sonic DNA with Pavement. Rather, they seem to be just a few strands or family tree branches away from another set of unkempt <i>Nuggets</i> devotees, Black Lips.

However often the lo-fi patina seems to lend what's happening musically a cozy spot in what's happening ""right now,"" it doesn't change what's under the hood: you've no doubt heard the 1960s garage surf of Box Elders before. It just wasn't theirs.</p>
<p>Of course, if you put together enough solid hooks, none of that would matter. But <i>Alice and Friends</i> doesn't produce often in that department, relying instead on the kind of raw energy that fuels a good house party. Opener ""Jackie Wood"" is a 75-second study in retro that toes the line between rushed and well-crafted pretty smoothly. But as soon as the McIntyres and simultaneous drummer/organist Dave Goldberg fly into the herk and jerk of the title track, they set a rhythm and pace that creates a hell of a traffic jam throughout both halves of the record. Vocals stacked on vocals, organs on drums, choruses on verses-- with the exception of some really juicy guitar runs, there's isn't much room to breathe here. ""Stay"", in particular, leaves little impression beyond a vague feeling of nausea.</p>
<p>""Necro"", though opening with a really beautiful conversation between clean guitar and organ, pulls itself inside out and back again in a way that typifies the experience as a frustrating whole. No consistency. The lines ""Way down in New Orleans/ Beneath the weeping willow trees/ You lay waiting patiently for me"" might be painfully familiar, but they're heading somewhere. What starts as just another plate of sock hop leftovers turns quickly into a sweetly macabre take on loving a dead person-- emotionally or, you know, otherwise. The chorus slays, the melody allows itself to sweat some, and the song enjoys a simple twist on a formula Box Elders seem beholden to in so many ways.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that sort of ingenuity comes off as a song within a song. ""Talk Amongst Yourself"" is a double-time disaster nearly identical to those of ""Isabella"" and ""Cougars"". Listening on headphones is a lot like getting the spins while drunk-- a bit too much of everything. The easy sway of closer ""Death of Me"" then is truly jamming, the staggered vocal coda, ""We're going home,"" as comfortable and familiar as these guys were supposed to sound all along. Hangovers suck.</p></div>"|13404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13404-alice-and-friends/|5.4|David Bevan

So we'll probably solve them for better or worse.""</p>
<p>--Doug Randle, quoted in the original liner notes to  <i> Songs for the New Industrial State</i>.</p>
<p>There's a funny mix of cynicism and optimism in that quotation from Canadian songwriter Doug Randle that nicely sums up the prevailing sentiment of his lone album. Originally recorded only for broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1970, the record was ostensibly given a new lease on life when the Kanata label picked it up the following year for release, but poor distribution ensured its quick trip into the recesses of Canadian music history, where it remained until now.</p>
<p>On its surface,  <i> Songs for the New Industrial State </i> is a sunny pop record adorned with many of the baroque trappings of adult-aimed light music records and California pop-psych, but there's much at work within that glossy interior. Randle turns his background composing music for advertisements inside-out with lyrics that carefully dissect the very methods he employed to sell things and lay their phoniness bare. In the late 60s and early 70s, lyrics decrying the artifice of a plastic world and environmental degradation weren't uncommon, but Randle does it differently, sometimes with a charming awkwardness that leaves the notion of rhyme scheme behind. He'd written musicals for the CBC, and that background is evident here, too-- the album as a whole feels something like an inversion of the industrial musicals that large companies frequently staged at shareholder meetings and sales events from the 40s into the 80s.</p>
<p>Randle doesn't sing or play anything on the album, instead serving as the composer/conductor while steady studio hands take care of the instrumental parts. The dual vocals of Tommy Ambrose and Laurie Bower, which alternate between harmony and unison singing, give the record a distinctive, plush feel. They help to sell Randle's vision of commerce trampling nature and peace of mind amid the fanfare of trumpets and strings as surely as the lady who sang ""My Bathroom Is a Private Kind of Place"" sold American Standard fixtures. Randle's open-hearted sincerity and tendency to say exactly what he's thinking without irony means that a lot of modern listeners will have to make a bit of an adjustment for lines like ""Warm wood/ It looks like warm wood/ Touch it/ It feels like colored plastic.""</p>
<p>""Nicolston Dam"" has some of the album's best imagery as Randle contrasts the pace of modern life with just sitting and watching trout leap over a dam, which nicely ties in the environmental themes that are also on his mind. On the odd, harpsichord-stuffed ""One-Way Swimming"" he offers to a hypothetical partner a way to get even further from the modern world: swimming out into the middle of the ocean. It doesn't quite advocate suicide, but it does suggest that falling off the edge of the world might be a nice escape. At the other end of the record, ""Vive La Company"" is a satirical portrait of a company man and his wife who tailor their interests and conversation to help him up the corporate ladder while their children walk to school singing commercials.</p>
<p>Randle's battle between cynicism about modern life and wide-eyed optimism is ultimately won by the latter, as he ends the album with ""Life Will Be Worth Living"". Naturally, many concerns on the record still ring true today, even if our ways of talking and singing about them have evolved as our society has moved from industrial to post-industrial. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but the album is a work of singular vision that earns its second airing through Randle's inventive sense of arrangement and to-the-point honesty.</p></div>"|12781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12781-songs-for-the-new-industrial-state/|6.2|Joe Tangari

<p>On the band's striking 2008 debut, <i>Limbo, Panto</i>, frontman Hayden Thorpe unleashed his shrill, glass-shattering shrieks as a means to project both the vulnerability and depravity of his sexually frustrated protagonists, and he didn't care if he went hoarse in the process (you can practically hear his vocal cords disintegrate on the galloping single ""Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants""). Perhaps as a means to avoid chronic laryngitis, on follow-up <i>Two Dancers</i> he's deferring more frequently to bassist Tom Fleming, a deeper-voiced foil in the Nick Cave crooner mold. But that's just a surface indication of the transformation Wild Beasts have undergone in the past year-- in contrast to the first album's fidgety, impulsive baroque'n'roll, <i>Two Dancers</i> sees Wild Beasts refashioned as a steely art-funk outfit that's no less alluring in its austerity.</p>
<p>Granted, some old horny habits die hard-- we're not two verses into album opener ""The Fun Powder Plot"" before Thorpe hollers, ""This is a booty call! My boot, my boot, my boot, my boot up your asshole."" But his words feel less outrageous and much more ominous when set against the song's metronomic groove and melancholic jangle-- pulse-tempering measures that keep the cheekiness in check. Likewise, first single ""Hooting and Howling"" benefits from a patient, linear build that transforms the song from a quiet trill into a heart-racing anthem, with Thorpe's circular vocal and guitar lines burrowing the melody well into memory before the first chorus is out.</p>
<p>Fans of <i>Limbo, Panto</i>'s chandelier-swinging flamboyance may be less enthused with <i>Two Dancers</i>' more organized presentation, but it allows Wild Beasts to better achieve their singular balance of aristocracy and anarchy: the debonair funk of ""We Still Got the Taste Dancin' on Our Tongues"" speaks of class warfare under the serious moonlight (""Us kids are cold and cagey rattling around the town/ Scaring the oldies into their dressing gowns/ As the dribbling dogs howl""), while the two-part title track suite finds Fleming sharing a grim, first-person account of some horrible attack before the song erupts in a tribal, psychedelic surge. He could very well be talking about a public stoning in the 15th century or a gang rape from last week-- and it's not even entirely clear if he's singing from a male or female perspective-- but the lack of specificity makes the transgressions described all the more unsettling, as if they could happen to anyone.</p>
<p>Wild Beasts certainly aren't the first rock band to stand up society's dregs and outcasts, but few others immortalize them on such a wondrous, mythic scale. And in the grand ""This Is Our Lot""-- the sort of song everyone wants Radiohead's perpetually imminent ""return to rock"" to sound like-- we quite literally have an anthem for the ages. Over top a rubbery bassline and shimmering guitar riff, Thorpe tips his tipple to the enduring passion of youth: ""We find ourselves dancing late/ Like young reprobates/ By the milky light of the mighty moon/ Find someone to nuzzle you/ And waltz from the room."" Of course, come sunrise, those kids will have to clean themselves up and get to work on time.<span> And perhaps the more accessible approach of <i>Two Dancers</i> suggests a greater willingness on Wild Beasts' part to interact with the straight world. But for them, every night is still a full moon-- and when it comes, Thorpe will be ready to howl.</span></p></div>"|13382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13382-two-dancers/|8.4|Stuart Berman

Jones wasn't reeling from alcohol, nor was he being chased by an angry ex, nor did any of the hard-living country tropes play into the crash. Instead, he was simply talking on his cell phone to his daughter. He was in critical condition but recovered eventually. Which is fortunate, because a legend like Jones shouldn't go out that way. Part joking and part shaming, the Truckers' ""George Jones Talkin' Cell Phone Blues"" acts as a biopic of sorts, framing a consideration of his life and legacy with details from the crash. ""He almost stopped loving her today,"" Hood sings, before admonishing the legend: ""Better leave that cell phone alone.""</p>
<p>That song kicks off <i>The Fine Print</i>, a collection of ""oddities and rarities"" that closes out a particularly productive decade for Drive-By Truckers. They were bound to get around to this kind of release sooner or later: At any given time they've had three and sometimes four songwriters in the band at once, so the backlog of unused songs was sure to back up the drains and overflow into a catchall like this one. As a retrospective, <i>The Fine Print</i> is incomplete, covering only 2003 onward (save a recent version of a <i>Pizza Deliverance</i> song). There's no Rob Malone, who left the band following <i>Southern Rock Opera</i>; Shonna Tucker sings only a verse of their redundant cover of ""Like a Rolling Stone""; but there are two new Jason Isbell tracks, which reminds you how naturally he fit into the group and how dynamically the band performed his songs. ""When the Well Runs Dry"" is a tense assessment of romantic and creative desiccation, and you can almost hear the mosquitoes buzzing around the languid ""TVA"", a shaggy dog story told by a backwoods lifer and interrupted by a simple, graceful guitar solo.</p>
<p>The Truckers don't skimp on the elements that have made them stand out among the southern-rock upstarts: These songs are populated with realistic characters in hard-luck situations, soundtracked with gnarly guitars and gritty vocals. ""The Great Car Dealer War"" and this version of ""Goode's Field Road"" (from <i>Brighter Than Creation's Dark</i>) are two more entries into Hood's Southern crime syndicate series. Recorded for <i>The Dirty South</i>, ""The Great Car Dealer War"" is told from the point of view of an arsonist who burns down car lots, and Hood balances the gravity of his testimony with bits of grim humor. Mike Cooley's ""Uncle Frank"" may not have quite as strong an impact, but this alternate version of an early song does include a grim coda not included in the original, which gives the song even higher stakes.</p>
<p>Their take on Tom Petty's ""Rebels"", recorded for ""King of the Hill"", fits so perfectly among the Truckers' original that I forgot it was a cover, and Hood updates Tom T. Hall's Vietnam-era ""Mama Bake a Pie (Daddy Kill a Chicken)"" to Iraq, fitting it nicely among the veteran songs on <i>Brighter Than Creation's Dark</i>. But the real story here is their version of ""Play It All Night Long"", which Warren Zevon wrote as a response to Lynyrd Skynyrd's response to Neil Young's ""Southern Man"". The Truckers wrote about Skynyrd and Young on 2001's <i>Southern Rock Opera</i>, so this cover acts as a sort of epilogue to that album. Plus, they fold in a few bars from ""Ain't That Pretty at All"" before throwing the song against a wall and beating it senseless with their guitars.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the rarities on <i>The Fine Print</i> could make a good album, but the oddities are often distracting. Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"", which they covered for <i>Uncut</i> magazine, is pretty much uncoverable, but the Truckers do as good a job as anyone else. The noir blues ""Mrs. Claus' Kimono"" is about unrest among the elves and reindeer, who plot to off Santa. Hood's conspiratorial tone sounds as out of place here as the song's cartoonish concept, but at least they can poke a little fun at themselves. More crucially, it adds another facet to <i>The Fine Print</i>, which recalls the Truckers' studio albums in its range of distinct tones and subjects: Filled with ups and downs, this collection of toss-offs and also-rans portrays the Truckers as a band that finds inspiration in the unlikeliest places.</p></div>"|13380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13380-the-fine-print-a-collection-of-oddities-and-rarities-2003-2008/|6.6|Stephen M.

Smell alumni HEALTH were a band going for broke, throwing everything-- noise, aggression, tribalist tendencies, spastic energy-- at the wall and barely waiting around long enough to watch it splatter. It was a nihilistic sound-- post-apocalyptic, even-- and even though you could hear distinct traces of noise-rock forbears Liars and Boredoms in their approach, the sheer energy of the thing seemed to suggest the potential for the band to carve out its own style. Fast-forward two years later and HEALTH's profile has risen considerably, thanks in part to the national-media focus on their DIY homebase the Smell, a solid remix album, and a coveted opening slot for Nine Inch Nails on one of that group's final tours.</p>
<p>All of the pieces were in place, then, for HEALTH to blow minds and unfasten jaws with the follow-up to their first release, <i>Get Color</i>. And when lead single ""Die Slow"" dropped a few months back, it seemed like they just might pull it off. The thrashing, industrial-disco track was easily the best thing the group had done to date, and it hinted that they had zeroed in on a more neatly defined aesthetic using a heavier focus on melody and song structure. So naturally the big question now is if the rest of <i>Get Color</i> lives up to the promise of ""Die Slow"". The answer is that it does... kind of.</p>
<p>In terms of its stylistic shift, the album is an unqualified success. Whether the result of their mixed-genre collaborations with Crystal Castles, relentless touring or plain old musical growth, HEALTH have clearly located their sound. It hinges on a more delicate balance of noise and prettiness (think the heaviest part of a My Bloody Valentine track magnified to entire-song length) and emphasizes frontman Jake Duzsik's androgynous vocals. With this revamped style, portions of <i>Get Color</i> reach the high bar set by ""Die Slow"". One such moment is ""Before Tigers"", with huge walls of guitar-and-drum noise that play off its whisper-to-a-roar vocals. ""Nice Girls"" is meaner and more asymmetrical but succeeds with similar contrast. Here, forceful tribal drumming sets off screeching instrumental caterwauls that seem at odds with, but ultimately blend into its ethereal, almost feminine coos.</p>
<p>HEALTH also incorporate more electronic textures this time around, and songs like ""Death+"" and ""Eat Flesh"" find the band using intricate synth patterns as jumping-off points for brutal freakouts. These tracks rely less on melody than those mentioned above, and while usually very sonically interesting, they seem to have only one purpose-- destruction. In that sense, a number like ""Eat Flesh"" fascinates my ears but doesn't do much for my heart. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to <i>feel</i> when I listen to the song, other than that maybe everything is fucked so it's best we just rage until the sun comes up. Which is a completely legitimate sentiment (and, heck, probably accurate) but I think I was able to glean that much from HEALTH's first record.</p>
<p>With its machine-gun drumming and end-of-days guitar shredding, <i>Get Color</i>'s second-to-last track, ""We Are Water"" also seems to be racing towards some kind of total annihilation, a violent end. But the band takes a surprising detour by following that song up with the more pensive closer ""In Violet"", which takes a step back to survey the scorched landscape, assess the damage done, and explore the possibilities beyond the moment. It's this sort of mature downshift that seems to suggest that if HEALTH can continue to find some deeper meaning behind their very impressive musicianship, they might be onto something great.</p></div>"|13409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13409-get-color/|7.4|Joe Colly

Justin Broadrick and Aaron Turner are two of the most influential rock musicians today. The former masterminded industrial metal behemoth Godflesh; now he helms shoegazer rock band Jesu. The latter fronts atmospheric metal outfit Isis, perhaps the most imitated metal band today. Greymachine also includes Broadrick collaborators Dave Cochrane (Head of David, Ice) and Diarmuid Dalton (Jesu). Broadrick has said that Greymachine taps into his aggressive side-- welcome news for long-suffering Godflesh fans. Combined with people from Broadrick's musical present and past, such intent raises interesting possibilities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Greymachine does not realize them. Contrary to hype, it is not Jesu + Isis. It has none of the pretty melodies of either. In fact, Broadrick's collaborators might as well have been absent. This sounds like a Broadrick project through and through, just not a fully fleshed out one. Songs often start with hoover bass lines-- a throwback to Broadrick's days producing drum 'n' bass 12""s in the 1990s under pseudonyms-- then wander through hazes of slow beats and guitars with loads of effects. The bass lines are bracing enough, but their power dissipates as songs go nowhere. Broadrick's production skills are peerless, and cool noises wind throughout the album. But cool noises do not make for songs. These tracks exhaust their ideas long before their running times, often eight minutes or more. The album feels like a collection of demos-- for a Godflesh remix EP, perhaps, or for Broadrick's earlier beat-oriented projects like Techno Animal or Ice. It was assembled via email, and sounds like it. The title is apt.</p>
<p>Greymachine wastes the talents of Broadrick and Turner. Perhaps it could have been more focused had they sat in the same room and hashed out songs the old-fashioned way. Maybe Turner's melodic sense would have come through. Maybe Broadrick would have worked up actual riffs. The lack of riffing has been his greatest weakness since ending Godflesh. His Jesu and Final projects revolve around chords and melodies and textures. Sometimes these work, but often others do them better. Riffs are distillations of purpose. They occupy the midrange and can almost act like voices. Since Broadrick left riffing behind, his work has felt scattered. It often has mammoth low end, clouds of high end, and emptiness in between.</p></div>"|13389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13389-disconnected/|4.3|Cosmo Lee

New EP <i>One Foot Ahead of the Other</i> is Zomby's second stab at non-single formats, after last year's revivalist, acid-spiked <i>Where Were U in 92?</i> More put-together than a throwaway work but lacking any true coherence or an obvious standout to rally around, <i>One Foot</i> exists in a weird limbo.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11438-one-foot-ahead-of-the-other/"" target=""_blank"">Title track</a> excepted, <i>One Foot</i> mostly abandons the blank-eyed vocal samples that gave <i>Where Were U in 92?</i> its slurred, sloganeering (""Need Ur Lovin'"", ""B With Me"", etc.) feel. <i>One Foot</i> instead relies on Zomby's harried, stepwise sequences, resulting in trebly, kaleidoscopic melodies that, yes, sound not unlike those of a video game.</p>
<p>This becomes a distraction early on <i>One Foot</i>, as ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead's Revenge"", eerie sparse siblings, pit their pixilated, serpentine programs against one another. Listening to these note flurries is a little like watching a mother spider carry a few dozen children on her back: an impressive, intimidating act that offers lots of creepy motion but very little definition.</p>
<p>Because Zomby favors brief, bright tracks (together, ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead"" sum to just more than five minutes) he can mostly weather these missteps, though it's hard not to see those tracks-- and, later, the similar ""Mescaline Cola""-- as two-dimensional showpieces, lacking something to compliment their whiz-bang programming.</p>
<p>Those tracks obscure <i>One Foot</i>'s leaner, warmer tracks. ""Godzilla"" is prickly and resplendent, its opening moments revealing a stuttering beat and orbital melodies. ""Expert Tuition"" relies on a canned thud and soft, putty keyboards that Zomby stretches and snaps. The padded, pulsing tones of ""Firefly Finale"" feel like soft-pedaled trance for two minutes before they're snatched away. ""Polka Dot"" may come closest to advancing <i>Where Were U</i>'s hurried floor-sugar. ""Bubble Bubble"" pairs short, repeating melodic phrases to an off-kilter drum track, the two occasionally slowing and syncopating. Fuck dancing, let's wig out.</p>
<p>The title of this EP might initially seem to promise progress, something <i>One Foot</i> almost assuredly does not deliver. But given the phrase's usual usage-- that is, ""one foot ahead of the other, slowly now""-- perhaps Zomby is hedging his bets. Just nine tracks and 26 minutes, <i>One Foot</i> feels like a stopgap (to wit: ""Polka Dots"" was streaming a year ago, and various other snippets and versions of these tracks have been floated). Zomby rode a wave of acclaim and stalwart singles to plenty of fanfare last year, but he's been mostly quiet in 2009. So <i>One Foot</i> feels like another step, finally, but only a very small one.</p></div>"|13414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13414-one-foot-ahead-of-the-other/|6.6|Andrew Gaerig

They are also one of the stranger recipients of UK hype in recent memory. They have no calling-card song; members of the Pitchfork staff have ID'd no fewer than four songs (""Basic Space"", ""Crystalised"", ""Islands"", ""Infinity"") as ""the one."" They are not fashion plates, nor likely to be. Their list of influences is potent but imperfect: Young Marble Giants (too shaggy and heavy-lidded); Japan (too robust and theatric); Glass Candy (too quick and glammy). Without one gimmick song they'll never be able to reproduce, without an alternate agenda, without a set-in-stone hip influence, the xx start to sound like a real actual band, even if, after dozens of listens, it's nearly incomprehensible to think that a group so fresh-faced produced <i>xx</i>.</p>
<p>Strongly influenced by modern R&amp;B-- the group made hay with an early cover of Womack &amp; Womack's ""Teardrops"", while UK copies of <i>xx</i> come packed with their version of Aaliyah's ""Hot Like Fire""-- the xx use a drum machine to complement their copiously tidy compositions. Unlike contemporary R&amp;B fetishists Hot Chip or Discovery, who have clearly spent long hours internalizing Timbaland, the Neptunes, and other radio cognoscenti, the xx incorporate more abstract elements of the genre: a liberal use of bass tones and an unwavering focus on sex and interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Singer-guitarist Romy Madley Croft in particular seems all but incapable of uttering a line that isn't a come-on, a post-coital musing, or a longing apology for a lack of one of the former. During ""Islands"" or ""Basic Space"", her voice takes on a pleasant soft-pop vibe, like Stevie Nicks'. When Madley Croft sings, during ""Shelter"", ""Maybe I had said/ Something that was wrong/ Can I make it better/ With the lights turned on,"" it's unclear whether lights-turned-on activity is sex or... something besides sex. She's not some purring kitten, though, merely reflective about a subject we don't often associate with teenagers and self-awareness.</p>
<p>Croft's sparring partner, bassist Oliver Sim, usually fills in the other spaces via either his responsive vocals or ever-present bass. (His best trick: momentarily interrupting the divine verses of ""Islands"" with four short thumbings). Sim's voice, papery and affectless, is a sticking point for some, but pop music has plenty of room for ugly male voices, especially those with such pleasant friends. Importantly, both Croft and Sim seem like they're singing not because they have the best voices but because they have the most to say (and, purely speculatively, possibly to one another), something that would align them with an indie rock tradition as long as the genre is old, (and folk and blues long before that).</p>
<p>Their voices provide plenty of friction, however, in the context of the xx's slight, expert compositions. Working without a live drummer, the xx manipulate airy, lingering negative space as well as any band going. Initially hospital-tile sterile, <i>xx</i> rewards volume and repetition like few other albums this year. Nudge the knob clockwise to hear sparse guitars decay, bass notes wobble. Amid these delicate environs, Croft and Sim can seem like they're working on different agendas, but the cagey back-and-forth on ""Basic Space"" is exquisitely timed, and the lovers' mumbles of ""Heart Skipped a Beat"", over a clacking drum machine, acquire their own weird logic. Jamie Smith (he of the ""Basic Space"" remix) and Baria Qureshi are responsible for most of the drums/loops/keyboards (and some of the guitars), and they're adept at knowing when to jump in, picking up ""Stars"" just as Sim seems to get bored with it, spicing ""VCR"", the band's quaintest, simplest pop song (""You/ You just know/ You just do""), with small xylophone melodies.</p>
<p>That all said, the record is not a complete break with recent sounds: tune in during certain moments of ""Crystalised"", and you'll hear the flecked, staccato guitars of Interpol. ""Infinity""'s slow-strummed electric chords feel like late-period Radiohead. But <i>xx</i> is nervy and self-contained, the product of a new band thinking a lot harder about topics-- sex, composition, volume-- than we are accustomed to new bands thinking. It is so fully formed and thoughtful that it feels like three or four lesser, noisier records should have preceded it. The xx didn't need a gestation period, though <i>xx</i> is nuanced, quiet, and surprising enough that you might.</p></div>"|13400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/|8.7|Andrew Gaerig

They've just never had much time for the economic framework of  hits, and although Sire co-released <i>Tone Soul Evolution</i> back  in 1997 when it briefly looked like anything could blow up, the Apples  have generally presented themselves as a DIY operation. Their home-brewed  approximation of late-60s psychedelic pop is removed both temporally  and culturally from the audience they often pretend they're playing  to. (They've also barely released any singles: they're an album band  and a live act.)</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that  isolating songs from their records and scrambling their chronology does  them neither good nor harm. This best-of spanning the six albums they've  made in the last decade and a half is their most straightforward record:  no trippy gestures or between-song links, thanks, just Schneider's better  hooks lined up end-to-end, plus a couple of showcases for now-departed  drummer Hilarie Sidney. (The one non-album track is probably the Apples'  most widely exposed song, the adorable <i>Powerpuff Girls</i> soundtrack  contribution ""Signal in the Sky [Let's Go]"".)</p>
<p>Schneider was arguably the  engine of the Elephant 6 collective, the guy whose work ethic   and low-budget ingenuity turned his friends' dreams and jams into actual  records like <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i> and <i>Dusk at Cubist  Castle</i>. His greatest weakness as a frontman is that he has nothing  in particular to say lyrically (""It's gonna be all right/ It's gonna  be all right, uh-huh, yeah""); the strength that covers up for it  is that he's figured out all the tricks of 40-year-old psych-pop production,  chief among which is keeping something new and ear-grabbing jumping  out of the speakers every few seconds. (Schneider's never heard a backing  vocal he didn't like, especially if it sounds like something John Lennon  could have sung.) He also likes to work in stray bits of melody from  40-year-old records: the very first line of the first song here, ""Energy"",  echoes Jackie DeShannon's ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart"",  and ""Seems So"" suggests an intimate familiarity with the Beatles'  ""You Won't See Me"".</p>
<p>The Apples' sound has been  remarkably consistent over time; aside from the ELO tendencies and digitalisms  that turn up on the four songs here from 2007's <i>New Magnetic Wonder</i>,  this set could just as well document a single year in the life of a  band, and it wouldn't be clear what year. (The unfancy crunch of 2002's  ""Please"" is the only real nod to their .38 Special-ish live  sound.) What's missing from <i>#1 Hits Explosion</i> is a sense of why  a hitless, consistent album act needs a retrospective. If it were the  only Apples record, it'd be a shock and a delight. Given that there's  been only one new album by the band in the past seven years, though,  it feels like a time-marking gesture-- a mixtape whose only argument  about the Apples is how reliable they are.</p></div>"|13402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13402-1-hits-explosion/|7.5|Douglas Wolk

That was a lesson hard-learned, so it's understandable (and fortunate) that this decade's significant beat-driven innovations from the UK have gotten only less genteel with time. Compare an early dubstep classic like one of Horsepower Productions' plenty-heavy 2001 singles with some of the outlandish stuff Joker or Zomby have dropped this year, and you can hear what it means for a genre to jump from strength to strength, advancing without diluting. Moving up in this arena means you don't necessarily need to get more tasteful-- and if you do, you just offset it by getting brasher, too.</p>
<p>Evidence of this rarely comes clearer than it does on an album like Silkie's <i>City Limits Volume 1</i>. The London producer broke out big last year with a succession of singles, including the tellingly-titled ""Jazz Dubstep"", that blended fusiony sophistication with the archetypal shuddering bass wobbles and tightly-built drum patterns that accompanied the genre's mid-decade expansion. The 13 new tracks on <i>City Limits</i> (nine on the triple-12"" edition) sound like a wider mission statement of that style, and that this album pulls it off without sounding like an exercise in mannered noodling is a cause for relief. The best moments on <i>City Limits</i> perfect a certain wide-ranging formula: ethereal, borderline-ambient synthesizer chords billow like fluffy airbrushed clouds over deep skank-motion rhythms, jittery breaks, or agitated melodies that keep them grounded in body-moving turf.</p>
<p>So while there's subtlety and refinement in the melodies-- like the fluorescent glow of the synths in ""Turvy"", or the ultra-smooth digital sax riff in ""Beauty""-- the beats knock hard, trembling inside subwoofers and pushing back so heavily you're practically forced to hear every single note in a rhythmic context. At its rawest-- ""Spark"" and its waist-winding, rave-gone-skanking rhythm; the chattering, long-arm-swinging lope of ""Sty""-- Silkie's productions sound a bit like Benga's wobbly, bristling aesthetic having <i>Blade Runner</i> visions. There are subtle nods towards breakbeat and jungle, too, like the choppy, pitched-up chirping vocal samples and Atari bomb-drops in ""Quasar"" that sound like they could've come from a 1994 Bay B Kane joint.</p>
<p>And even when it all gets pushed to extents as absurd as the eight-minute ""Planet X""-- a deep churn of mousetrap percussion and tremulous, rubber-legged bass punctuated with '84-style funk flash on some Jam/Lewis business-- there's more than enough force in its beat to keep entropy at bay. Funny, then, that even with the knack for extended vamps exhibited on this album, the biggest highlight should also be the most succinct song on the record. The Mizz Beats collaboration ""Purple Love"", with its restless, stammering arpeggio bassline and thickly congealing waves of sweeping pads, is dubstep at its funkiest and most euphoric. It's almost doing <i>City Limits Volume 1</i> a disservice to call it retrofuturism-- such a tendency has rarely sounded much less indebted to a caricatured past or a clichéd tomorrow. And it's good to know that even in the wake of a forward-thinking genre's continued commercial acceptance, it's still possible to keep pushing the limits-- wobbling without falling down.</p></div>"|13378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13378-city-limits-volume-1/|8.2|Nate Patrin

So it's refreshing to know there are young guns in the game: <i>A Slave's Commitment</i> is the debut LP from 21-year-old, Amsterdam-based Pascal Terstappen for the venerable Traum label. Released as Applescal (get it?), Terstappen's <i>A Slave's Commitment</i> arrives after just one 12"" on Traum earlier this year (he also has four EPs to his name on different labels). A humid, pattering imagining of Traum's glittery, spiked dance music, <i>A Slave's Commitment</i> promises more than it delivers while announcing Terstappen's presence.</p>
<p><i>A Slave's Commitment</i> introduces not just a new artist, but new music as well: It features 11 exclusive Applescal tracks and a remix of Local Daddy's ""Sjeesh Up"". Terstappen seems deeply committed to the album as a form, as <i>Commitment</i> feels more than balanced (in fact, its back half is somewhat superior) and the vocals that close the ""Sjeesh Up"" remain the only hiccup in Terstappen's woozy, compressed world.</p>
<p>It's a world built out of electronic sounds that will be familiar to fans of crossover electronic acts of the past few years. The strident, deliberate melodicism of late-90s Warp Records (the Boards of Canada-indebted ""The Forms of Abstract Life""), the trance-like pop repetitions of the Field (""The History of Love""), and the skybound synth-tronica of M83 (""Nottingham Hobbits"") are all reference points. This isn't to damn Terstappen's credentials, however-- <i>Commitment</i> is sturdier and more beat-conscious than any of the above acts' records.</p>
<p>Despite his oft-warm soundscapes, Terstappen has a bit of a bend to him. ""In the Mirror"" begins with a bass rumble and unadorned beat before adding a creeping minor-key melody, giving the track strange, noir-ish grit. ""Funk &amp; FC"" exhibits a paranoid, skittish streak that borders on the most coherent and clear-eyed strands of (gasp) IDM. <i>Commitment</i>'s standout track is ""How Heroes Die"", which behaves almost like a rock song from the flat, machinated snaps of its opening moments. From there: gorgeous, hill-like synth patches, pulses that drift over what might be a bridge, and a gorgeous, ascendant convergence of these elements before a slow fade. It's a familiar formula, and cynics might note that this kind of major-key hope-stirring (ignore the song title) is a little bit like hitting baseballs off a tee, but damn if Terstappen doesn't swing hard.</p>
<p>There are less inspired moments: the tech-y ""Ugly But Nasty"" mostly lives up to its title and, at over eight minutes, does so for a long time. The Local Daddy remix is an odd choice for a rookie showcase, its vocals obtrusive and weird (could've been a great B-side). Committing to an album format makes a lot of sense for Terstappen, as Applescal is unlikely to thump on dancefloors. Moreover, <i>Commitment</i> plays evenly, even if no one would complain about an EP of remixes and extended edits of ""How Heroes Die"" or ""Nottingham Hobbits"". <i>Commitment</i> would be better if it were weirder and more singular, but for now, Terstappen's waxy, roomlit beats make for fine evening companions.</p></div>"|13406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13406-a-slaves-commitment/|6.4|Andrew Gaerig

""Joined by quest for fire/ They searched all through the land/ Joined by quest for fire/ Discovery of man,"" he sings in his melodramatic howl, offering a summary of an early French novel and a then-recent English film of the same name. In all three quests, prehistoric tribes battle for a spark from a natural blaze, their adventures filled with animal attacks, theft, and, of course, badass triumph. Was there ever a more ready-made Iron Maiden song?</p>
<p>Despite the handle and a self-titled debut on New York stoner-and-psychedelic syndicate Tee Pee Records, Toronto quartet Quest for Fire aren't just another metal band welding their adolescent sci-fi fantasies to British heavy metal allegiance. Quest for Fire deserve the name by maintaining the sense of grandeur of its namesakes. On <i>Quest for Fire</i>, finally available domestically after Montreal's Storyboard released it in 2008, the dudes stretch six songs to 43 minutes of distended riffs, patient drumming, and subtle textures. And though there are enough leaden riffs and tangential trips for the record to pass muster in the right stoner and psychedelic circles, Quest for Fire-- like the Deadly Snakes, the garage-pop bastard-greats to which two of its members once belonged-- move beyond the expectations of their form. With a two-guitar approach and mutual interests in Black Sabbath sludge and druggy dream-pop, Quest for Fire often suggest Built to Spill as much as Black Mountain or Birds of Avalon, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen as much as Earthless.</p>
<p>Quest for Fire generally find a good riff and grind away for five minutes or more. Sometimes they build into it and burn out in a blaze (""Strange Waves""), go straight for the throat and lash away until track's end (""Bison Eyes""), or build to and away from a roaring peak in the middle (""The Hawk That Hunts the Walking""). Quest for Fire focus more on tone and tune than technique, too, meaning that-- though the individual playing is certainly strong-- the band's a gestalt of sorts. Each song sweeps you in and moves you along, calling more attention to the general thrust than the individual performance. The solos are more functional than fantastic, working mostly to move the band from one speaker-shattering convergence to another.</p>
<p>But there's always a little more going on than just four guys riffing in a room. Consider ""You Are Always Loved"", the album's most anomalous moment: A moody drifter of layers and contrast, the seven-minute tune centers on an acoustic guitar line so distant it feels like it's played by a ghost, and a tambourine that feels like too much of a burden to lift. A ragged electric guitar line and a steady march of cymbals and toms smolder around the broken ballad, washing past and pushing behind Chad Ross' forlorn, death-threshold vocals.</p>
<p>It's not the only track here with creative juxtaposition or interesting parts, though. ""Strange Waves"" buries an acoustic guitar and harmonica behind its juggernaut electric lumber, adding not just texture but the sort of finesse that makes you want to listen again, to peer around the thick curtains up front. At six minutes, ""I've Been Trying to Leave"" is a relatively short barnburner. And as Ross sings, ""Follow me to the sun,"" over a steely throb, it's one of the album's most riveting rock anthems. At one point, though, they shift out of the groove and riff, downshifting into a supreme bit of weird jangle that recalls vintage R.E.M. The relationship between the guitars on ""Next to the Fire"" seems complex enough to require a compass, map, and canteen to navigate. Sometimes, Ross and Andrew Moszynski paw away at the same riff, trying to reduce one theme to a vapor of dust. One or the other eventually separates himself simply by changing tone or spinning through unexpected variations that split the difference between Mahavishnu John McLaughlin and J. Mascis. So, yeah, epic-- just like that Iron Maiden track.</p></div>"|13198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13198-quest-for-fire/|6.9|Grayson Currin

By that time, they had essentially completed the ideal life cycle of a rock band, rising from an intermittently promising debut to become one of the world's biggest bands, creators of twin masterpieces that captured the fear, exhaustion, alienation, and anxiety of modern life in near-perfect musical settings. There is no rock record that did more to set the tone and establish the parameters for rock music in this still-young century than <i>Kid A</i>, an intentional masterpiece so brimming with creativity it spawned a sequel in <i>Amnesiac</i>.</p>
<p>How does a band follow that up? Well, for one thing, it doesn't try to make another masterpiece. The record Radiohead did make, <i>Hail to the Thief</i>, is almost an anti-masterpiece, a well-sequenced collection of songs that finds them internalizing the blend of experimental electronics and straightforward rock they wore so far out on their sleeves just a few years earlier. They basically started over, and on the record, the band sounds aware that it's peaked in a  way, and perhaps less sure of where it wants to go. I hear the tension between a band that started to make the back-to-basics album guitarist Ed O'Brien so frequently mentions in interviews and a band that self-consciously want to do something new each time out and perhaps even feels guilt when it fails to innovate. They'd pushed their horizons so far already that they didn't have much exploring left to do.</p>
<p>Confusion and apprehension are written all over the album. Just look at the tracklist: ""Scatterbrain"". ""A Wolf at the Door"". ""Sit Down. Stand Up"". ""2+2=5"". ""Backdrifts"". They couldn't even decide what to call the songs, giving each one an obtuse parenthetical co-title. When Thom Yorke sings, ""I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied,"" on ""Myxomatosis"", he sounds as though he's talking himself out of a creative eddy, and what better way to do it than over a crazed, fuzzed-out odd-metered groove? At 14 tracks and 56 minutes, <i>Hail to the Thief</i> is easily the longest Radiohead album, and it doesn't seem accidental that two-thirds of the way through lies a song called ""There There"", as if the band is consoling itself, recognizing that there are worse challenges than carrying forward in a successful rock band.</p>
<p>""There There"" has one of the album's many ambiguous refrains in its ""just cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there"" turnaround, which could be taken as a brief rebuke to the anxieties expressed earlier. But what's even more striking about the song is how unremittingly gorgeous it is. It has a melody fitting for a jazz standard, but just as important is the rhythmic undercarriage. Drummer Phil Selway hardly plays a conventional rock beat anywhere on the album, here using kettle drums to give the song a distinctive buoyancy, while Colin Greenwood's bass part constitutes a second melody. Selway and Greenwood run away with ""Where I End and You Begin"", creating a rushing current to carry along the queasy synths and understated vocal.</p>
<p>It's one of the album's few vocals that could reasonably be called understated. Thom Yorke uses his full range across the record to give voice to anger, defeat, affection, frustration, and longing. He's a fantastic singer in general, but his real strength is in the way he can latch onto a simple phrase like ""over my dead body"" and twist and pull it to mean whatever he wants it to. His most virtuoso performance on the album comes on its breathtaking closer, ""A Wolf at the Door"", where he balances a frantically paced, paranoid verse with a towering chorus. It's on songs like this where you realize that this album, more than any of their LPs since <i>The Bends</i>, simply lets you concentrate on a what a good band Radiohead is without distracting you with thematic concerns, conscious innovation, or attempts to force a bend in the band's artistic arc.</p>
<p><i>Hail</i> has a few low points and could probably be edited to make it that much more digestible-- apart from its tumbling bridge, ""We Suck Young Blood"" is a momentum-killer between the sinuous groove of ""Where I End and You Begin"" and the tangled loops of ""The Gloaming"" (it's also somewhat similar to the superior ""Sail to the Moon""), while the brief ""I Will"" is pretty distracting from the album's overall flow. I would've been happier with it as a B-side. ""A Punchup at a Wedding"" has a disappointingly flat refrain, but makes up for it with the funky swagger of its rhythm track. Even the lowest points have their considerable merits, though, to the point where it even bears wondering whether Radiohead can even make a bad album at this point.</p>
<p>The tracks they did relegate to B-sides, now included on the second disc of Capitol's reissue, were certainly well-suited to their release format. ""Paperbag Writer"" is an interesting, even worthy experiment with programmed beats, a whacked-out bass line and creepy strings courtesy of Jonny Greenwood that at first sounds like an update on Martin Denny's version of ""Quiet Village"". Its counterparts sound for all the word like odds and ends. Even the title of ""I Am Citizen Insane"" sounds forced, ""Where Bluebirds Fly"" is an exercise in creating texture with almost no content, and three of the four remixes and alternate versions that backed ""2+2=5"" aren't especially interesting (Four Tet's take on ""Scatterbrain"" is the squirming exception). Yorke's piano sketch ""Fog (Again)"" is nice, and the quiet, acoustic ""Gagging Order"" is practically a throwback to the stuff they were putting on B-sides in the mid-90s, which is to say it's by far the best B-side included in the bonus material.</p>
<p>Even if it is a cash-grab by Capitol (and who can blame them the way things are going?), the bonus disc is a convenient aggregator for the band's fans. The video content on the third disc, meanwhile, offers little you can't experience easily on the Internet. The reissue also offers a chance to re-assess an album that's oddly failed to develop a solid reputation over the years since its release-- I've heard it described as everything from a disappointment to ""their best album"" to ""too long"" to ""I don't remember what it sounds like"" by fans of the band. For a while, I identified most with the last statement-- there's no denying that <i>Hail to the Thief</i> took longer to settle for me than any of their four preceding albums. Time and persistence have been kind to it, though. <i>Hail to the Thief</i> isn't Radiohead's best album, but it doesn't need to be, either. There are other albums for that. It did, however, prove that there can be life for a band after its landmark statement, and that life sounds pretty damn good.</p></div>"|13384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13384-hail-to-the-thief-special-collectors-edition/|8.6|Joe Tangari

It's okay because this is one of those situations where the story and the music feed into each other and complement each other beautifully. The persona, whether it was ever really real or not, wasn't part of the noise that kept us from hearing the music; it was as central to the music as her actual voice. And anyway, her actual voice told her story better than any press bio.</p>
<p>So here's the story: Sally Shapiro is the stage name of a Swedish woman whose real name we don't know. We don't know her name either because she's painfully shy or because she just doesn't want us to know. Before <i>Disco Romance</i>, her incandescent debut album, she wouldn't let strangers photograph her, and she wouldn't sing her songs with her producer in the room. And yet she and her producer, Swedish Italo-disco dude Johan Agebjörn, got each other perfectly. He fed her airy, delicate minimal dance tracks, and she cooed over them in her barely there wisp of a voice. That voice implied so much: Sadness, nostalgia, devotion.</p>
<p>And now the follow-up. When <i>Disco Romance</i> came out, I compared Shapiro to Belle and Sebastian, whose early-on reticence similarly defined them and gave their music context and weight. Shapiro's in a little bit of a <i>Boy With the Arab Strap</i> situation now. There's still an air of mystery surrounding her, but it's been depleted a bit. She's done some interviews, she's let dance producers manipulate her songs on a pair of remix albums, and she's even gone on a quick DJ tour. Since that tour, Shapiro and Agebjörn have announced that touring just ain't her thing, but it's done. She's out there. She's got a Twitter, for fuck's sake.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I should read the general watered-down quality of <i>My Guilty Pleasure</i> as a symptom of Shapiro being out in the world or what, but that sense of exquisite isolation from <i>Disco Romance</i> is gone now. The songs are shorter and packed with more activity. The tempos are faster. Shapiro's voice is still slight and sometimes wounded, but it doesn't fully give into titanic emotion the way it did on <i>Disco Romance</i>
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
. Instead, it's an album of vaguely slight dance-pop songs. That's fine, but it's not great. <i>Disco Romance</i> was great.</p>
<p>The good news: These dance-pop songs, slight as they are, are sometimes very good. Agebjorn is mostly working with the same materials as on the last album-- twinkly synths, vintage 4/4 drums, Moroder bass oscillations-- but he's using them to fill more space, not letting them fade into the background the same way. ""Moonlight Dance"" has slap-bass, which is weird. The pitched-up ""Save Your Love"" track is fast and bubbly enough that it could almost be Latin freestyle. These tracks gleam, but they don't necessarily sound perfectly suited to Shapiro. Often, it's easy to imagine someone her opposite (like mid-decade Madonna, say) singing over them.</p>
<p>As for Shapiro, her voice still has a perfectly evocative quality, and so, sometimes do her lyrics. She's looking at the stars tonight and only thinking of you. Someone she loves turned her down, and she didn't feel her head touch the ground. That kind of thing. You get some of the weirdly poetic sentence-structure that only seems to come from people who aren't native English speakers: ""I walk the streets I used to live upon with you."" ""Dying in Africa"" seems to just be about being dumped, and then she drops this tiny bombshell: ""I won't get over you, even if I died in Africa."" Huh? She never tells. Well played.</p>
<p>But <i>My Guilty Pleasure</i> doesn't have the same sense of character and place that <i>Disco Romance</i> had, and it also doesn't succeed as the straight-up dance-pop record it seemingly wants to be because the melodies aren't there. (<i>Disco Romance</i> would've made a much better straight-up pop record if they'd sped it up a bit.)

He's pleasant-looking if not actually handsome, and he usually dresses well, though he is never very flashy. He's always nice to you, and you've never heard a bad word about him. He's always just around, and you don't mind him being there, even if you never seem to connect with him in any meaningful way. This dude-- perhaps he's your co-worker, maybe he's you're classmate or neighbor-- is rather like the music of Cale Parks.</p>
<p>This is not a judgment on the personality of Cale Parks himself, who is a man, and not, remarkable name to the contrary, a gated community. It's hardly even a comment on the quality of his compositions, which are well-crafted, uniformly tuneful, and performed at a standard well above a very generous notion of average. The selections on <i>To Swift Mars</i>, the Aloha member's third solo release, reveal him to be a thoughtful, subtly clever musician with an ear for low-key melodies and a mind for cerebral indie rock poetry. Nevertheless, even though the songs are objectively interesting and well-written, they are not especially engaging on an emotional level, leading to a rather hollow listening experience.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this is not a huge problem. Not all art needs to be emotionally charged, and there is a great deal of pleasure to be taken from Parks' cool, sterile grooves. The consistently neutral vibe of the music lends the record a degree of utility, both as background noise and as something to complement a blank state of mind. If this were instrumental music, or even some quasi-shoegazer thing with the vocals blurred into incoherent washes of sound, this would be a non-issue, but Parks makes a point of foregrounding his voice and lyrics, which indicate far more feeling than his singing or instrumentation expresses. The tell-don't-show approach has its merits on an intellectual level, and there is something to be said for exploring this sort of stoicism in song, but even the overtly melancholy ""Eyes Won't Shut"" is utterly impenetrable.</p>
<p>Though Parks never breaks from his reserved, diffident persona, he does allow for moments when he lets his guard down enough to seem more like a fascinating enigma and less like some nondescript guy on the outer edges of your social circle. The gentle organ-based duet ""Knight Conversation"" showcases his handsome croon and sense of moonlit romanticism, and the mellow funk of the single ""One at a Time"" is emboldened by percussive fills that convey far more passion than his aloof vocal performance. Ultimately, the thing that nags about this work is the way Parks comes right up to the edge of something quite powerful and exciting, but inexplicably keeps himself from going all the way. The man clearly has the talent and the skill to do great things, and one can only hope that eventually he'll get over the timidity that is holding him back.</p></div>"|13405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13405-to-swift-mars/|6.4|Matthew Perpetua

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The music of Foot Village is loud, spastic, and often complicated. But it always poses one simple question: ""How much can you take?"" Not that the L.A. quartet's sound is overly harsh or even noisy. In fact, they almost never use guitars or other electric instruments, just drums and voices. But on <i>Anti-Magic</i>, their third LP, almost every track offers something to test your endurance. On ""Reggae War Zone"", it's a bratty ""nah nah nah""; on ""Grace's Death"", it's throat sounds that verge on graphic gagging; and on ""National Jamthum"", it's the operatic croon of lines like ""We're all on acid!/ And some of us on PCP!"" What's more, most songs here roll on past the point where you'd expect them to relent.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>And yet somehow <i>Anti-Magic </i>is not annoying, at least not for anyone who values energy and commitment. The group hurls themselves so devoutly into every second that their urgency becomes contagious. It's a trait they share with the band they most resemble sonically, the Boredoms. Their muscular multi-drumming, intricate beats, and unintelligible screams could all be conducted by Eye Yamatanka himself. But without the safety net of guitars, Foot Village can sound as naked as the characters on </span><i>Anti-Magic</i><span>'s cover. As a result, their approach risks being grating, gimmicky, or just plain tedious.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Those are dangers the band members are skilled at confronting. Brian Miller and Grace Lee come from Gang Wizard, a shambling noise group prone to bouts of glorious ineptitude. Josh Taylor was in Friends Forever, who played cartoon-metal shows from inside their tour van. Both bands had spilling, unpredictable energy, but Foot Village opts for rigorous precision. Nothing here is improvised, and it all has the feel of a ritual. So the labor that these songs require often pushes them past formality into cathartic workouts.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>When that happens, Foot Village's chanting voices and slamming percussion unite in one furious stomp. On ""Reggae War Zone"", Lee swings as she spurts out, ""This a war for the human race!"" Later, a male voice-- presumably Miller's-- barks in time to the rolling rhythm of ""Death of the Endless"", like a sharp horn in a sax-drums duet. And on the anthemic ""Anti-Magic"", a bouncing beat inspires the group's best invective: ""We believe in nothing/ Because nothing is what's true!""</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>About that belief: apparently <i>Anti-Magic </i>is a concept album about a war against magic and spirituality (a follow up to last year's <i>Friendship Nation</i>, purportedly about a land where ""our national language is drumming [and] our national pass-time [sic] is screaming""). All this is pretty hard to discern beyond a few chants about death and destruction, though the band does have a knack for pithy slogans like ""We write love songs in a secret language that no one can resist!"" But however unclear the themes are, there is definitely something guiding Foot Village through their hectic, impossible-to-leave-on-in-the-background music.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>That music may ultimately be more engaging in concert, judging by videotaped </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvy0Ly7wPS8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">evidence</a><span> from the Smell, the L.A. mecca that Miller helps run. But even if Foot Village's records are less essential than their shows, they're not afterthoughts. And don't be surprised if <i>Anti-Magic</i>'s pound-and-scream ends up compelling you to turn it up rather than off.</span></p></div>"|13388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13388-anti-magic/|6.9|Marc Masters

You're being called the greatest band in the world, and many want you to become the biggest. You've been charged with uniting and possibly leading a large group of listeners who spent the late-1990s exploring some combination of the outré genres of post-rock, IDM, exotica, Tropicália, and French house; the emotionally resonant yet textural sounds of artists like Björk, the Verve, Beck, Stereolab, and Spiritualized; and the once-potent but now flagging spheres of rave, jungle, and techno. In short, there's a hell of a lot of pressure on you.</p>
<p>Whether prescient or just fortunate, Radiohead never had to create a new set of songs under the weight of these expectations. Instead, they followed the instant-classic <i>Kid A</i> with what they had planned to do from the start: Relatively quickly issue another set of songs recorded at the same time, a lengthy studio-bound period that ate up much of 2000.</p>
<p>Appearing nine months after <i>Kid A</i>, <i>Amnesiac</i> faced an uphill climb as steep as the icy mountains that adorned the earlier record's cover. And so it was that the record was met with derisive ""Kid B"" jokes, sniffed at as pretentious, or considered the work of a band that had moved a little too far to the left. In the face of choosing between the forward-looking sounds of Radiohead and the revivalism hailed as the New Rock Revolution, a lot of listeners and critics chose the easy way out. Eventually, later in the decade, artists like the Knife, Animal Collective, Liars, and LCD Soundsystem would carry the mantle of blending genres and upsetting listener expectations in rewarding ways. But in 2001, in an era when the radio and MTV were still the primary delivery systems for new music-- and after the majors felt burned by electronica, or by U2 and Smashing Pumpkins' ahead-of-the-game attempts to experiment with electronics in a stadium-rock setting-- creatively ambitious guitar music was still considered a commercial misstep.</p>
<p><i>Amnesiac</i> was in some ways another leap beyond <i>Kid A</i>, an album that already was heavily influenced by experimental electronic music, 20th century classical, and ambient music, and often featured the manipulation of singer Thom Yorke's voice and found Jonny Greenwood ditching his guitar for a compositional electronic instrument called the Ondes Martenot. To a generation raised on Pearl Jam and Oasis, it wasn't always easy listening.</p>
<p>Three other things handicapped the record from the go: First, the belief that, because these songs were released after those on <i>Kid A</i>, the band felt they were inferior, which has never been the case. Second, in order to ensure <i>Amnesiac</i>'s summer 2001 release, <i>Kid A</i> wasn't promoted in a traditional manner: No singles were officially pulled from the record, and no videos were created. The band commissioned a series of online ""blips,"" short films that preceded the record's release, but because the LP wasn't being milked for extra product it appeared to be a unique, complete piece unsullied by scrupulous promotion or overexposure. If you wanted to listen to <i>Kid A</i>, you listened to the CD, at a time of your choosing, generally front to back. As Rob Mitchum said in his review yesterday, for many, it was virtually the last record they engaged with in this way.</p>
<p><i>Amnesiac</i>, by contrast, was promoted with singles, which gave it an aura of both ordinariness compared to <i>Kid A</i> and gave the impression that the band itself, threatening even then to dismantle the received wisdom about how to record, promote, and release music in the digital age, had caved to the wishes of their label.</p>
<p>More than all that, however, <i>Amnesiac</i> is the first album I can remember most everyone I know getting online in bits and pieces. In the slipstream between encoding mp3s and records leaking in full, songs would tend to dribble out one by one. For a record like <i>Amnesiac</i>, this was particularly disadvantageous. The word on <i>Kid A</i> was already that it flowed so perfectly as an album (which is half-true: Like Daft Punk's <i>Discovery</i>, also out that year, its first half does. But then each CD featured a palate-cleansing instrumental and a more traditional second half which, other than their respective finales, could have been arranged in arguably any order.)</p>
<p>For <i>Amnesiac</i>, the tracklisting is important because of the tension it creates rather than the comfortable way in which it flows. As a result, there are a number of songs that work as experiments or filling between more traditional pieces, and these tracks' power is heightened when you listen to the record straight through. When you've spent 30 minutes to download a song, you don't want to hear something like Robert Fripp homage ""Hunting Bears"" or leftfield excursions like ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors"" or ""Like Spinning Plates"". They work just fine as standalone songs to my mind, but many in 2001, upon first encountering them, felt cheated. No more so than with the band's decision to release a second version of <i>Kid A</i>'s ""Morning Bell"". At the peak of the bloated CD era, when a record is already a ""mere"" 44 minutes long, spending three of those precious minutes re-working a song from your previous album wasn't a popular move.</p>
<p>Yet despite the supposed arm's-length coldness of <i>Amnesiac</i>, it's an emotionally resonant and often very warm record. When the group aims for rich, tonal undercurrents of sound beneath swelling, heart-lifting arrangements, on <i>Amnesiac</i> the songs are less likely to be buffered by electronic crackles and pops or swirling strings. The difference is most notable in that second version of ""Morning Bell"", but pick any of the album's more glacial, atmospheric songs and you have the blueprint for the band today. ""Pyramid Song"" and ""You and Whose Army?"" surely, but even rhythmic, vibrant songs like ""I Might Be Wrong"" and ""Dollars &amp; Cents"" sound like the itchy, impatient way in which Radiohead today balance their rock and electronic impulses.</p>
<p>As a whole, the friction within a song like ""I Might Be Wrong"" is played out on a grand scale, heightened by some of Yorke's more aggressive lyrics. After the evocative, often lonesome and disconnected lyrics of <i>Kid A</i>, <i>Amnesiac</i>'s snap more clearly into place and often are pointed or defensive. ""You and Whose Army?"" and ""Knives Out"" on their surface carry tinges of violence, while elsewhere Yorke pleads for people ""to get off [his] case"" or threatens to ""crack your little souls.""</p>
<p>The strains of paranoia that had run throughout Yorke's songs for a half-decade came most sharply into view on album closer, ""Life in a Glasshouse"", which oddly seems to predict the post-9/11 Bush administration's misguided warmongering (in Iraq), belief that patriotism is equated with obedience, and willingness to trade liberty if they believe it will bring security. The only song on <i>Amnesiac</i> recorded after the release of <i>Kid A</i>, it would also have been the only song recorded after the election of Bush, and with its stately, funereal New Orleans jazz arrangement it provides an earthy, traditional close to the forward-looking <i>Kid A</i>/<i>Amnesiac</i>.</p>
<p>Released again, with its grab bag of B-sides-- some more interesting than lovable, but all worth hearing-- and a few songs recorded in a Paris studio (all reconstructed enough to make them worthwhile, if a bit sterile at times in this environment), <i>Amnesiac</i> can ideally take its rightful place among Radiohead's acknowledged classics. More than <i>Kid A</i>-- and maybe more than any other LP of its time-- <i>Amnesiac</i> is the kickoff of a messy, rewarding era in which rather than owning records that were of a piece, we listen and engage with a wide variety of sounds in jumbled, sometimes confusing ways. And <i>Amnesiac</i> sounds like what the dawn of the mp3 era sounded like: disconnected, self-aware, tense, eclectic, head-turning-- an overload of good ideas inhibited by rules, restrictions, and conventional wisdom.</p></div>"|13407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13407-amnesiac-special-collectors-edition/|9.5|Scott Plagenhoef

Factory']|2009-08-26 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 18:58:59.981583|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".19w6b9vvocg.1.6:0.1.0.$13129/=1$13129.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p><i>Walking on a Wire</i> isn't Richard Thompson's first boxed set: that was 1993's 3xCD <i>Watching the Dark</i>, which compiled studio and live recordings from the breadth of the great British singer/guitarist's career (about a third of them previously unreleased) in an order that tossed chronology to the winds in favor of musical flow. It's also not his second boxed set: that was 2006's 5xCD <i>RT: The Life and Music of Richard Thompson</i>, which was almost entirely unreleased recordings, arranged thematically.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This one is a straight-up career retrospective: one magnificent song apiece from the first five Fairport Convention records (the era in which he was the indestructible folk-rock group's full-time lead guitarist and occasional songwriter), and then at least a track or two from each of Thompson's studio albums with and without Linda Thompson (except, oddly, 2005's <i>Front Parlour Ballads</i>), a handful of his live records, and a couple of his other album-length projects. There's nothing from his session work with other artists, no discographical oddities, no previously unheard material, and very little regard for sequencing or musical contextualization. It's just a Man, This Guy's Made a Lot of Albums info-dump, a primer for those who have not yet been converted to this cultiest of musicians and therefore don't understand why it's an international disgrace that ""Withered and Died"" and ""I Feel So Good"" are not generally available at karaoke bars.</p>
<p>The problem with acolytes is that we tend to go on a bit too long about our heroes, and <i>Walking on a Wire</i>'s and-then-he-made-<i>this</i>-record enthusiasm turns exhausting over the course of four discs. (Including six songs from 1974's epochal <i>I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight</i> was a good idea. Including six songs from 1994's shaky <i>Mirror Blue</i> wasn't. The five songs from his two collaborations with Danny Thompson are at least four and a half too many.) Song for song, though, there's a lot of remarkable stuff here. In particular, the first two discs (which go up to 1985's <i>Across a Crowded Room</i>) aren't faultless, but they're fantastic. Thompson had an old man's gravitas from the get-go-- Fairport's ""Meet on the Ledge"" is probably the most emotionally weathered looking-back-at-youth song ever written by a 20-year-old-- and the six albums he made with Linda anchor their precision-tooled craftsmanship and erotic tension with the deeper resonances of the British folk music that's always informed Thompson's songs.</p>
<p>The second half of the box is spottier, not because Thompson lost his songwriting mojo altogether-- ""Gethsemane"" and ""Beeswing"" are right up there among the peaks of his repertoire-- but because the split with Linda was roughly the point at which Thompson the songwriter began to stiffen and peel apart from Thompson the guitarist and live performer. (The big-bang production of his 80s and early-90s records hasn't aged well, either.) One thing he lost when he no longer had a woman to sing his words was an easy cue that his lyrics might not be a direct expression of his own experience, so they shifted more toward obvious fictions and character sketches as his singing grew more mannered. ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning"", Thompson's best-loved post-Linda song, presents the singer as a storyteller, entirely detached from his subject, where Linda and Sandy Denny always found a way into his narratives. And 1991's ""Read About Love"" is as vivacious and catchy as any other power-pop song of its era, but it's unbecomingly condescending to its narrator: ""When I touch you there it's supposed to feel nice/ That's what it said in Readers' Advice.""</p>
<p>The highlights of the final disc are excerpts from the live records Thompson's been cranking out through his own label since the mid-90s and selling at concerts, especially a scintillating acoustic dash through the Who's ""A Legal Matter"" and a 12-minute, solo-heavy, roof-blowing-off version of ""Hard On Me"". (The acolytes, of course, are always the ones who get access to the best stuff.) The set is the closest thing Thompson's got to the career-spanning greatest-hits album he deserves-- but if you're not already part of his cult, it's more a moat than a drawbridge.</p></div>"|13129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13129-walking-on-a-wire-richard-thompson-1968-2009/|7.7|Douglas Wolk

Consider: Dark, synth-splashed pop songs with enough of an industrial bent to validate any flashbacks you might be having of watching Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie stalk the club for fresh meat in <i>The Hunger</i>. And though pack leader Wesley Eisold (also known for his work in the hardcore outfit Give Up the Ghost) does have the spooky Peter Murphy vocal thing down pat, Cold Cave sound more realized than the one-off pleasure project they look like on paper. By enlisting noise goblin Ian Dominick Fernow (Prurient) and Xiu Xiu-graduate Caralee McElroy to pitch in, their full-length debut<i>, Love Comes Close</i>, manages to stand out as a successful collaborative effort with a clear sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Synth-pop, post punk, new wave, atmospheric industrial-- all these references, which came and went and were fashionable again a half-decade ago, somehow manage to feel fresh here. It's probably because the songs on <i>Love Comes Close</i> are consistently catchy and well constructed-- once you have that down, genre concerns become secondary. Still, these are some awfully icy landscapes, and Cold Cave do have a way with mood. Take, for instance, opener ""Cebe and Me"", which exhibits a pulsing, Ambien-addled dry cold that threatens to wear thin if over-exercised. But this track turns out to be an entry-level teaser, as album highlight ""Love Comes Close"" chimes in right on time, an inspired, bittersweet New Order-style dance-pop track that's as morose as it is curiously uplifting, constantly refreshing itself on that earworm of a guitar hook. From here on out, <i>Love</i> evens out, outfitting those creepy, dead-eyed synthetics in more pop-friendly garb.</p>
<p>The presence of Fernow is apparent and welcome, seasoning the Human League pop pulse with big, bright slices of Throbbing Gristle abrasion on cuts like ""Heaven Was Full"" and ""Cebe and Me"". Cold Cave have the chops to be a depraved batch of noise warriors with a <i>Blade Runner </i>fetish, but I'm guessing that those crystalline new wave hooks they're capable of were just too juicy to ignore. There's an overwhelmingly disaffected quality to this music, but in the sense that even the darkest parts have been treated with Cheer® Dark Colorguard®. So maybe it's McElroy's vocal contributions that are to credit, sweetening dance-ready tracks like ""Life Magazine"" and the splendid ""The Trees Grew Emotions and Died"" (both of which sound much like two very reined-in Crystal Castles singles).</p>
<p>But Eisold proves to be the noble, well-versed synth-Svengali of the whole operation, his devilish baritone channeling the vocal reticence of Ian Curtis one moment and the yearning of the National's Matt Berninger the next. True, he sometimes allows the lyrical content to wade a bit too far into chic discontentment for some (""A synthetic world without end,"" interjects McElroy on the Eastern Euro disco joint ""Youth and Lust"", ""sheds a tear of plastic deception""), but <i>Love Comes Close</i> is all about that world anyway and makes no apologies, so you might as well just roll with it. Besides, most of the pretenses presented here can't overshadow the sexy fun of a little black lipstick on the collar. <i>Twilight</i> fans, let's cut the shit: throw on a little Cold Cave and get down to business already.</p></div>"|13383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13383-love-comes-close/|7.6|Zach Kelly

That's not to downplay his talent when it comes to gluing his grey synth bubbles and drum thwacks into little sonic shoebox dioramas. It's just that it took the introduction of the disco pulse before Delay made his masterpiece. Even on his best ambient album, 2001's <i>Anima</i>, you feel like you're listening to Luomo minus the rhythm, and the lack is disappointing.</p>
<p><i>Tummaa</i> is just fine as these low-impact, Delay-branded outings go. Anyone who clicked this probably doesn't need to be forewarned, but just in case: it lacks melody (except in frustratingly haunting and brief snatches); repeating rhythms; a pretty frontperson singing about the universal stuff we feel in our squishy human parts. As usual with this stuff, you can take it straight as possible-- the tactile joy of certain noises slithering up your earhole, aka the ""wow, that was neat the way some non-musical sound set my emotions tingling"" factor-- or let it spice up the stale silences of your day-to-day. Or both.</p>
<p>Fractured backing for your domestic micro-dramas? There <i>is</i> a certain early-morning calm to ""Kuula"", and its blend of quavering synth, and it sounds like someone rustling around in a kitchen while looking for the muffin tin that's gone missing. Bumper music for the world's most avant-garde nature doc? ""Toive"" will add its own not-standard animal cries and the sound of brush crushed under heavy hooves to your next nature walk. And so on. What elevates the album beyond similar outings by Delay's peers is his care. Just as with Luomo, where every vocal hiccup sounded erotically casual <i>and</i> machine-plotted, you get the sense these collages proceed as they do for a reason, Delay's openness to organic happenstance adding a little extra suspense to his formal rigor. This is not music made of tidy loops.</p>
<p>It's no fun to write about this sort of post-Eno quote environmental music unquote, because adjective-heavy impressionism and quasi-poetry lurk around the corner with baseball bats waiting to bludgeon the reader's credulity and the writer's rep. So let's end things in the real world, a place that can almost always use a better soundtrack than it's got. I spent most of my time listening to <i>Tuumaa</i> on my porch, watching deciduous trees and off-white houses bake under the August sun in a flat, featureless patch of suburb. And it made my neighborhood-- usually so lacking in surface interest it makes Andy Warhol's <i>Emprire</i> look like D.W. Griffith's <i>Intolerance</i>-- newly entertaining for that hour-plus. While I do wish he'd release another (good) Luomo LP, if Delay's dip back into sound art can add alien color to the drab Everytown, U.S.A. street scene I confront each morning, imagine what he can do for you.</p></div>"|13393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13393-tummaa/|6.2|Jess Harvell

There's Fun Wave Machines, i.e., a group unafraid to break out the helium pump for Bee Gees-style vocals while tidy funk bops along in the background. And there's Pensive Wave Machines, i.e., a group of graceful cowards who adorn their endearing fears with crescendos that hint at triumph without confirming it. One of these guises is decidedly more convincing than the other.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with geeks angling for some semi-awkward dance floor action, just ask Devo or Hot Chip. It's just that, on <i>Wave if You're Really There</i>, the groovers come packaged with singer Timothy Bruzon's ""are you serious?"" falsetto, which quickly turns into a grating tea-kettle squeal. Simply, it's annoying. Less simply, it doesn't vibe with the songs' often-defeated viewpoints and ends up undermining them. Which is a shame because upbeat numbers like ""Keep the Lights On"" and ""The Greatest Escape We Ever Made"" are sleek acoustic-pop confections with Beta Band beats that actually deserve such a comparison. There is a welcome exception: Single ""I Go I Go I Go"" packs the upbeats without the upticked voice and wins.</p>
<p>Then there's the other half of the record, where Bruzon relies more on his natural register, a soothing instrument with just the right amount of McCartney and melancholy. These songs ditch the electronics for arrangements that are more quietly epic, as if the band is finally facing their dead and lost relationships head on. Still, they're born pacifists. And that's okay. ""Put your bow and arrow down,"" sings Bruzon on the swelling, Super Furry Animals-style title track; meanwhile, ""Punk Spirit"" finds him amusingly reneging on vicious rebellion and rolling out white flags. But even as these tracks submit, they do so with a bristling, realistic vitality; if these guys are going down (and they most definitely are), they're doing it on their own terms. Such is the moral on ""Dead Houses"", where Bruzon nearly whispers about old homes, abandoned homes, childhood homes-- but his loss is loud.</p>
<p>One of the album's other great, slow-burning tracks, ""You Say the Stupidest Things"" comes off like a self-lashing. But it's not what this band is saying that's particularly dumb, it's just how they're saying it. And since these masochistic fellows seem fully aware of their own foibles, they should keep in mind that singing songs about having no balls in a voice that suggests you actually have no balls is a risky endeavor.</p></div>"|13396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13396-wave-if-youre-really-there/|6.2|Ryan Dombal

There was once a time when music was organized into 45- to 75-minute chunks-- often a few standout tracks padded with a lot of mediocre filler, but occasionally designed so that the parts built up a larger structure. Used to be, people would sit down and listen to that lengthy piece of music from front to back in one sitting, resisting the urge to jump to their favorite parts or skip over the instrumental interlude that served as grout between two fuller compositions. These antiques were called CDs. Here's a story about the last of its kind.</p>
<p>When <i>Kid A</i> came out in October 2000, it sounded like the future. Unless you were a Napster whiz-kid, the record was one of the last to arrive unspoiled and complete, a physical object, the disquieting Stanley Donwood art reinforcing its dark mystery. It's arguably two-and-a-half minutes into ""How to Disappear Completely""-- more than a third of the way through the album-- until anything sounds like a ""Radiohead<span> </span>Song,"" even with how far the elastic of that term was stretched on <i>OK Computer</i>. And while Radiohead were far from the first to glitch-up their vocals with a computer or drown their compositions in ambient washes, it was still a thrilling experimental gamble for a band that could've profitably re-made ""Karma Police"" 100 times over with minimal reputational damage.</p>
<p>But simply flirting with new technology wasn't enough; even in 2000, the idea of a band ""going electronic"" was a laughable marketing gimmick from an era that spawned the term ""electronica."" But the samples, loops, and beats of <i>Kid A</i> were more than just the patronizing dalliance of a bored band, they were tools used to service the album's even deeper exploration of<i> OK Computer</i>'s thesis on identity loss in computerized society. It was, unashamedly, a complete album, one where everything from production to arrangements to lyrics to album art were carefully crafted towards a unified purpose.</p>
<p>It's also a contoured album without clear highlights, best experienced in one sitting rather than cherrypicking the best parts. (It's telling that the band famously quarreled over the sequencing of tracks.) The biggest stylistic coup was the corruption of Thom Yorke's vocals-- arguably the band's most singular feature up to that point-- and the detuned-radio effects of the album's opening couplet: ""Everything in Its Right Place"" and ""Kid A"" threw listeners expecting that signature ""Fake Plastic Trees"" falsetto immediately into the deep end. On ""The National Anthem"", Yorke is shouted down by horn section mayhem, and when he finally gets in an unfiltered word in on ""How to Disappear Completely"", it's the album's most haunted (and revealing) line: ""That there, that's not me.""</p>
<p>There's no storyline to pick out from Yorke's lyrics, but a unified thread moves through the album nonetheless: Basically, <i>Kid A</i> is scary as hell. It might be the paranoid, nearly subliminal, unbroken undercurrent of haunted drone, courtesy of a Rhodes or a tape loop or Jonny Greenwood's Ondes-Martenot, a instrument for nightmares if there ever was one. Or it might be Yorke's terrifying one-line, Chicken Soup for the Agoraphobic Soul mantras that alternate between honeyed violence (""cut the kids in half"") and clichés and hum-drum observations twisted into panic attacks (""where'd you park the car?"").</p>
<p>(A brief intermission to talk about the bonus tracks included with this reissue. Capitol's in a tough spot with finding <i>Kid A</i> outtakes, because they already released such a thing-- it's called <i>Amnesiac</i>...*rimshot*. So instead the bonus-disc padding is all live tracks, culled from British and French radio or TV shows. In keeping with the album's isolation fixation, the empty studio of the four-track BBC session is the most fitting environment for the band's performance, the vocal manipulations of ""Everything in Its Right Place"" ricocheting off egg-crate walls. Contrast that with the clap-along crowd on an ""Idioteque"" from France, which neuters the song's sinister undercurrent and turns it into an inappropriate party jam.)</p>
<p>Every great album needs a great resolution, and <i>Kid A</i> has two: the angelic choir and harps of ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" which serve as a much-needed (if fragile and a bit suspicious) uplift needed after such unrelenting bleakness, and a brief ambient coda that justifies the hidden-track gimmick. The silence that surrounds that final flash of hazy analog hiss is almost as rich, conferring a eerie feeling of weightlessness upon anyone who's completed the journey with a proper headphones listen.</p>
<p>But that's where the twist ending comes in. <i>Kid A</i> turned out not be the music of the future, but a relic of the past, more in line with dinosaurs like <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> or <i>Loveless</i> as try-out-your-new-speakers, listen-with-the-lights-off suites. By the time <i>Amnesiac</i> officially arrived, it had been served up piecemeal on the internet, handicapping the final product from reproducing its predecessor's cohesive structure. From then on, albums have persisted, sure, but they're increasingly marginalized or stripped for parts-- release <i>Kid A</i> today, and many might choose to save or stream ""Idioteque"" and Recycle-Bin the rest, missing the contextual build and release that makes the album's demented-disco centerpiece all the more effective.</p>
<p>That's not a qualitative judgment: The way things are now isn't better or worse, just different. Technology, of course, is a selection pressure, digital music eroding the arbitrary 45ish-minute barrier that once was dictated by vinyl's finite diameter. But while a single song will often do, there's a talent to building and a pleasure in experiencing a dozen songs weaved together into a 40 minutes that's richer than each individual track, a 12-course meal for special occasions between microwave snacks. Like calligraphy, it's a fading art, as even Radiohead themselves seem to be disinterested in the format, perpetually threatening to dribble tracks out in ones or fours when the spirit takes them. In the end, one of the many ghosts that haunt the corridors of<i> Kid A</i> is The Album itself, it's death throes an unsettling funeral for a format that, like so much else, was out of time.</p></div>"|13385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13385-kid-a-special-collectors-edition/|10.0|Rob Mitchum

These were tricky, seductively spare works that got at jazz by outlining jazz-shaped holes. They were most notable for Henriksen's adventurous, curiously-phrased style as a trumpeter. He made his instrument sound like a woodwind, a flock of birds, a Japanese flute, a punctured helium balloon. His strangled yet fluent tone is marked by a vivacious Scandinavian melancholy and a hint of noir. His meditations for trumpet and electronics expand the warm, alien landscape that Jon Hassell initially revealed, and populate it with Olivier Messiaen's avian familiars.</p>
<p><i>Cartography</i>, Henriksen's first album for the serious-business jazz label ECM, is an ambitious showcase for his exotic syntax: Notes float on cushions of air or clang like lead; they sigh, squeak in distress, bleat, and taper off into thin shrieks. When ravishingly full tones break out from the baroque constraints, the effect is devastating. Henriksen plays the way Ian Curtis sang: A rough-and-ready yet wounded voice, always on the verge of cracking with emotion. On ""Migration"", he unrolls a gaseous theme that periodically dissipates into the merest pinched tones-- minimalism's pervasive mark is not omitted here. The climactic swells of ""Migration"" have chafed edges, as if Henriksen's trumpet had a sore throat. He spits rapidly through the mouthpiece on ""Ouija"" to create a richly-textured, telegraphic stutter. But he's a focused, patient player, who miraculously condenses breathtaking themes from this almost-zoological diversity.</p>
<p><i>Cartography </i>differs from prior albums in that it was cobbled together from structured improv sessions with a variety of collaborators, both live and in-studio, over a three-year span. But it plays seamlessly, owing to Henriksen's highly-developed style, as well as to smart, immersive post-production by Jan Bang and Erik Honoré, who enrich the live instrumentation with samples, field recordings, synthesizers, and programmed beats. While Henriksen's plaintive motifs are still central, pacing the development, there's a lot more going on around them than before.</p>
<p>""Poverty and Its Opposite"" sets Henriksen's trumpet against a distant shimmer and intensifying abstract percussion; it's like a forest coming to life as night falls. ""Recording Angel"", with its scratchy textures, haunting Trio Mediaeval vocal samples, and founts of drenching melody, is a jazz answer to Nico Muhly's <i>Mothertongue</i>. From the distressed orchestral samples on ""Loved One"" to the staticky piano of ""Sorrow and Its Opposite"", the invention never flags, and never veers away from the service of severe beauty. No matter how many times I hear the two pieces that feature spoken-word poetry by David Sylvian, I can never hold onto the narrative thread for very long before I slip into the sounds of the words and the timbre of Sylvain's calming voice. That's how deep an enchantment Henriksen casts on <i>Cartography</i>, which maps an impressionistic world where sound is meaning.</p></div>"|13379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13379-cartography/|8.1|Brian Howe

Which is an apt description of the music of Helado Negro, Roberto Carlos Lange's project named for the Spanish translation of that odd dessert. On his debut, Lange, the Florida-raised child of Ecuadorian immigrants, offers a lazy summer's day worth of dreamy, percussive tracks (almost entirely sung in Spanish) that pay homage to his roots yet use broad brush strokes from a silvery, futuristic palette. It's like Beck's version of Tropicália, but bled of his white-boy admiration of the exotic.</p>
<p>You may recognize Lange from his work in Guillermo Scott Herren's Savath y Savalas, a project that is similarly enamored of Latin American psych-folk, scratchy beats, and warm, homemade production. And, in a lot of ways (most notably its blend of traditional Latin music with the elastic sonics of experimental electronica), <i>Awe Owe</i> sounds like a follow-up to Savath y Savalas' <i>La Llama</i>, which was released earlier this year. Except that there is no place for <i>Llama</i>'s spooky undercurrent amidst <i>Awe Owe</i>'s feather-weight, beachy effervescence. Without the steely, mechanical effects and dark, tinny din that are clearly preoccupations of Herren's, Lange is free to leave lots of airy space between his chattering percussion and loopy xylophone melodies and play with whispery bossa nova textures without being overwhelmed by rhythmic heaviness.</p>
<p>Without hooks to hang on to, though, or vocals to serve as your guide-- most of the singing here is washed out, like the sun-bleached stucco of homes by the shore-- this album gives off a first impression of curiously constructed background music. But like a pointillist painting, the individual songs seem fuzzy and indistinct until you look at the album as a whole, and only then do they sharpen into view. Opener ""Venceremos"" (translation: ""we will triumph"") gives the album a whimsical start, with a plucky xylophone run that's reminiscent of Stephen Malkmus' ""Phantasies"". The track then finds its groove with trotting percussion that sounds like horse hooves against cobblestone streets and an acoustic strum so breezy that you can practically smell the saltwater in the air.</p>
<p>With its ambiance so clearly stated from the get-go, the album then moves on into Animal Collective territory with ""Espuma Negra"", which builds its psych-tinged track over a hypnotic, repetitive core riff. Then ""Dos Sueños"" lives up to its title (which translates to ""two dreams"") with an ethereal, winding melody, spare, plinky orchestration, and some tangy harmonized ""oohs"" that are so mellifluous they almost sound created by synthesizers or a Theremin instead of human voices.</p>
<p>The album is frontloaded, though, and the middle, mostly instrumental section is somewhat forgettable and monotonous before giving way to the best song on the record. After roughly 35 minutes of organic melodies spackled over electronic beats and effects, closing track ""Deja"" surprises with its handclap percussion, which makes a nice bed for Lange's hushed, easy singing, nimble fingerpicking, and the ominous sound of distant church bells. Eventually the track displays Lange's mechanical proclivities, layering hard-edged scrapes and computerized bubbles under its echo-y vocal melody, making it the only track on the collection that sounds like it is meant to be listened to, not <i>by</i> the sea, but 20,000 leagues under it.</p>
<p>Lange made <i>Awe Owe</i> in his home studio in Brooklyn with different friends and collaborators (from the aforementioned Herren to Stars Like Flea's Shannon Fields) floating in and out of the sessions, and this gives the album the feel of being stitched together like a homemade quilt. And like a quilt, it is warm and comforting, if not necessarily dynamic. So while it may never deviate from its mid-tempo lull, its mellow, reflective songs are goosed by their Latin melodies, making it a languidly satisfying complement to the hazy, hot final weeks of summer.</p></div>"|13292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13292-awe-owe/|6.4|Rebecca Raber

In fact, Brosseau's proven himself hip and adventurous enough to effortlessly hob-knob with L.A.'s elite, equally imbued as he is by Woody Guthrie's folk wanderlust, Cole Porter's cosmopolitan class, and even Jeff Buckley's arty otherworldliness. Indeed, Brosseau's the sort of artist whose simple, strikingly unadorned songs and high, lonesome vocals could probably be fit to shape if not any occasion than certainly any time and place.</p>
<p>Still, one gets the sense Brosseau may have nonetheless played his true nature close to the vest. Albums like <i>What I Mean to Say Is Goodbye</i> and <i>Cavalier</i> feature their share of tasteful musical flourishes, but by and large those discs remain spare, almost skeletal in their execution, as if Brosseau were still waiting for the right body to hang on those bones. <i>Posthumous Success</i> (which takes its name from a chapter of a Camus bio but its self-deprecating wit from <i>The Late, Great Townes Van Zandt</i>) isn't quite the coming-out party it's being presented as, but it does find Brosseau expanding his sonic palette while retaining the lyrical (both literal and figurative) qualities that have made him a quietly special performer and singer. He's the type of guy who can casually reference Dave Grohl, Vincent Price, and Flannery O'Connor's <i>Wise Blood</i> protagonist Hazel Motes without waving the red flag of pretension, let alone breaking the slightly surreal, waking-dream quality of the music he's so carefully fostered.</p>
<p>Minus that deceptively unaffected voice, a song like ""Big Time"" might come across as bluster. Instead, anchored by Brosseau's nuanced delivery it feels oddly innocent, even bittersweet. Similarly, in ""Been True"", Brosseau's voice vies with trebly interlocking guitars, the tone vacillating between melancholy and hopeful. Even the cacophony of ""You Don't Know My Friends"" is oddly hushed and muffled, subverting the album's obvious Big Rock Moment into something stranger and more unpredictable. ""Axe &amp; Stump"", with its oblique Afro-pop nods, and the just shy of straightforward ""Wishbone Medallion"" find some intriguing ways to twist themselves in and out of knots, too. Keeping the record further off-kilter, Brosseau scatters several not insignificant instrumental tracks throughout. They range from the wistful (""Boothill"") to the wide-eyed (""Miss Lucy"") to the more abstract (""Youth Decay"" and ""Chandler""), yet even without vocals they impressively adhere to Brosseau's style.</p>
<p>Yet were one to still suspect, even for a second, that Brosseau is widening his scope simply in search of wider success, he also offers an explicit reminder of how malleable a talent he remains by starting and finishing the album with the same song, albeit in very different forms. The first version of ""Favorite Color Blue"" is austere and acoustic folk, in the mode of Brosseau's earlier work. The second, however, is full of pulsing synths and further embellishments, not so much a remix as a re-imagining. By book-ending <i>Posthumous Success</i> with these two dissimilar yet equally effective and affecting takes on the same song, Brosseau is keeping us on our toes. Is the latter a tease of a future direction he plans to take, or a sly concession to the stylistic temptations he's thus far largely resisted?</p>
<p>""I'm slowly changing my style,"" he sings. ""I got new shoes and now all I want to do is dance a while."" Time will tell, but listening to Brosseau finding his footing at least makes the mystery more compelling.</p></div>"|13127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13127-posthumous-success/|7.0|Joshua Klein

And a lesser band might have been swallowed, but it should be clear by now that Arctic Monkeys weren't undone by a little media frenzy. It's no surprise: They're a skilled band that writes complex songs filled with unexpected musical turns, wit, and observational acumen. They have a level of musicianship that hasn't been fashionable since the 70s, but they employ it in a modern way, and everyone I've heard doubt the group changed their mind when I played them one of their records.</p>
<p><i>Humbug</i>, the band's third album, breaks ground in a few directions for the Arctics. It's their loosest record yet by far, following on the heels of the hyperaggressive <i>Favourite Worst Nightmare</i>, which at times was wound so tight it felt like it might collapse from a heart attack on the next chord change. Part of this looseness can be credited to producer Josh Homme, who brings out the darkness that often underlies Alex Turner's songwriting. The guitars in particular have a snapping, reverberant desert/surf tone that fuels the band's descent into night. It's an interesting look for them, and one that undeniably sounds much better on the third or fourth listen than the first. This perhaps reflects that the Arctics, having established and subsequently defended their place in the UK pop firmament, can now afford to make a record that grows on you rather than walloping you in the face repeatedly.</p>
<p>First single ""Crying Lightning"" is among the record's loudest, most aggressive tracks. Alex Turner's Yorkshire accent and penchant for detailed writing-- he catalogs the sweets the ""you"" in the song ingests almost obsessively (pick'n'mix, strawberry lace, gobstoppers, and ice cream) and the song rides its overdriven bass line to a theatrical horror guitar build-up. The song's heavy hand is oddly off-putting and engaging at the same time. As an antidote, they'd do well to release ""Cornerstone"" as the follow-up single. The album's highlight, the song is beyond lovelorn, with Turner delivering a swooning, dreamy vocal, possibly his best to date. He makes a somewhat hokey premise-- a guy who keeps approaching women who look like his ex-girlfriend, only to strike out when he asks if he can call them by her name-- actually work through clever turns of phrase and his usual flair with detail.</p>
<p>That song feels like a legitimate expansion of the band's songwriting arsenal, but their usual territory offers its share of good stuff as well. Matt Helders' drumming on the frenzied riff-fest ""Dangerous Animals"" is jaw-dropping, and it's one of things that saves the song from its spelled-out vocal hook. ""Potion Approaching"" threatens to turn into a cover of Nirvana's ""Very Ape"" on its opening riff, but the band instead opts for Zeppelin-ish start-stop passages that read like ""Achilles' Last Stand"" recast as a Britpop tune before it shifts completely into a seesawing, mildly psychedelic mid-section.</p>
<p>Their riffier tendencies can get the best of them, as on ""Pretty Visitors"", a progged-out song that gets lost in heavy metal thunder, choral vocals (not an actual choir, but the band built up into one), and creepy organ interludes. The balance between songwriting and excess seems to hold across all three of their albums, though, and it's never undone them yet. <i>Humbug</i> isn't better than either of its predecessors, but it expands the group's range and makes me curious where it might go next. It also demonstrates a great deal of staying power for a band that could have imploded before it ever got this far.</p></div>"|13374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13374-humbug/|7.2|Joe Tangari

If you happen to have tumblesaulted into the world at about the same time, Mondanile's solo wanderings-- already corralled and categorized by some as tropical lo-fi or a part of the memory-mining hypnagogic pop shift-- should represent a deep rabbit hole. Chances are the first impressive pop sounds you (or I) heard as tots in overalls weren't really those of the Beatles being played/shoved down our throats by Mom or Dad. It was the guitar and synth fantasias that breathed life into our modest television diets: commercials, Saturday morning cartoons, NES, or PBS programming like ""Reading Rainbow"". In a way, those were our first music videos. Mondanile's moniker may seem like just a goof on a Disney cartoon of the same name, but it's also a commitment to conjuring images of ""back then,"" whether you're 25 or 45. <i>Landscapes</i>, his latest full-length, might as well soundtrack home movies of Mondanile's youth. On VHS, of course.</p>
<p>That should bring you up to speed on what's happening sonically as well. Lo-fi to the core, Ducktails is a close cousin of Real Estate's sun-dappled basement pop (kind of an oxymoron), Mondanile's Deadhead guitar tones carrying over chord for chord. These, however, are largely instrumental jam sessions of a more monastic stripe. As has been the case with his vinyl and cassette-only releases over the past couple of years, <i>Landscapes</i>' setup is ultra-spare: synths, guitar, drum machine. The success and failure of these songs lies not in the hook department but in how well Mondanile is able to harmonize these textures and squeeze them into a pop context, how he's able to convince a listener to smack their <i>own</i> pleasure centers.</p>
<p>Opener ""On the Boardwalk"" is a light synth mist that's very much the tone setter for the rest of the record. With the exception of ""Landrunner"", a hairsprayed guitar jam far more forceful than the rest, everything floats by as if on its own weed-fueled current. That's a double-edged blade for sure, and no matter how ridiculously tuneful Mondanile's loop pedaling gets, things get sticky. While ""Deck Observatory"" is the kind of glass-bottomed bathtub zen its title suggests, ""Welcome Home (I'm Back)"" seems to have had its tempo slowed down past the point of deliriously languid and into yawn territory. But <i>Landscapes</i> is rarely anything but engaging. ""Wishes"" in particular is a slacker standout more harmonically rich, more sweetly and appropriately lonesome than anything else here. And if it weren't for the brittle, frequently jazzy guitar licks that braid together Mondanile's key solo in ""Roses"", you'd be listening to music more fit for a Chinese restaurant or Walgreens. Not a layer goes to waste, though. Just before launching into ""Spring"", a slim guitar jam that could easily have been an outtake from the <i>Terror Twilight </i>recording sessions, Mondanile mumbles ""it sounds cool like that."" Indeed. It looks cool, too.</p></div>"|13375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13375-landscapes/|7.3|David Bevan

<p>But the excitement is understandable-- in case you haven't noticed, everyone's hopping on the idea that there's a 90s revival underway, and in theory, <i>Slaughterhouse </i>provides a missing link to the awe-inspiring posse tracks of the mid-Clinton years-- songs like ""Banned From TV"", ""Verbal Intercourse"", ""John Blaze""-- except that the <i>whole album</i> would be like that! But as anyone who's cheered for a squad GM'd by Isiah Thomas, listened to a Dylan/Dead record, or paid $12 to see <i>He's Just Not That Into You </i>knows damn well, the fantasy approach to franchise-building has a staggering failure rate. The best rap groups are borne of collaboration and chemistry from complementary parts, but Slaughterhouse is less duel of the iron mic and more Pro Bowl talented performers caught up in a listless walk-through with no real competitive incentive and no indication that they spent any time beforehand in the same room planning things out.</p>
<p>Granted, each of these guys can bring the pain on whatever track they're on, but that's pretty much the entire problem here-- all four essentially serve the same purpose, blunting each other's effectiveness and magnifying the sort of problems that always arise when a rapper can put together a hot verse but not a decent album. For all of its Jack White ""realness"" shtick, <i>Slaughterhouse </i>still has commercial aspirations but absolutely nothing resembling pop instincts.</p>
<p>The only way you could put together a supergroup in 2009 with a worse ear for beats would involve getting Jadakiss, Nas, Foxy Brown, and Marlee Matlin in the booth. Befitting a bunch of guys who've orbited Shady/Aftermath in various degrees, Slaughterhouse's beats are towering, but in a way that's monolithic, charmless, and corporate, like a gleaming office building. Take ""Bad Boy 4 Life""-on-a-budget faux-banger ""The One"", inexplicably the first single. DJ Khalil's geetar-stuffed beat is so intrusive and annoying, you have to wonder why he doesn't change his named to ""Khaled,"" and even if it had a remote shot getting anywhere near a club's playlist, a tone deaf hook from the New Royales throws it out on its ass. ""Not Tonight"" provides the walking music for a whole museum of Hov MC'ers, but only ends up reminding you of mid-decade Roc-A-Fella songs that you'd rather be listening to instead (""Roc Boys"", ""Roc the Mic"", ""Encore"", Freeway's ""Still Got Love""). ""Cuckoo"" takes a stab at pill-poppin', limb-choppin' horrorcore and suggests that they got greedy while ghostwriting for <i>Detox </i>and tried to get a drop on <i>Relapse.</i> There's a song with Fatman Scoop. Seriously.</p>
<p>To their credit, ""Sound Off"" and ""Salute"" are the sort of no-frills beatdown rap that would score a 3 ½ mic rating in <i>The Source</i> circa 1998 and if grokking syllables serves as your sole criteria of an MC's worth, <i>Slaughterhouse </i>is at least impressive on a surface level-- Crooked I puts in the best performance relative to his public stature and if you sprinkle Royce Da 5'9""s verses over a year's worth of feature spots, you might be as excited about Slaughterhouse as you were in 2008. Hell, even Joe Budden acquits himself nicely enough that you almost feel bad that there are versions of this that exist on the web where he's completely eliminated.</p>
<p>But <i>Slaughterhouse­</i>'s<i> </i>biggest weakness is what brought us here in the first place-- for a record that's supposed to be so lyrically godbody that aspiring rapsters will retreat to a lifetime of Auto-Tune in fear, the lyrics display no real wit or inspirational spark.<i> </i>Punchlines fail and fail often, whether it's cumbersome comestible raps that recall a very lazy DOOM (""so it bleeds to death like the middle of an unfinished burger,"" ""I want me a sloppy ho whose pussy smells like tilapia""-- thanks for sharing, Joell), delightful homophobia (""like your boyfriend's sodomy hole, full of shit""), or broke man's Wale NBA namedrops that make you wonder how the Knicks could fuck up so bad on and off the court and yet still have Anthony Mason be the last guy who got a dope rhyme in his name (""like Nate Robinson, I back up the point"").</p>
<p>If it seems like a show of restraint that they wait three minutes to make their first crack about skinny jeans, I don't know what to say about leaving ""Cut You Loose"" until the 13th track. It's your basic ""you can't fire me 'cause I quit"" missive to a mainstream acceptance they clearly strive for, and the saddest part is when Crooked I goes at Rick Ross and Jim Jones for taking shots at Eminem in 2009-- it takes me back to reading <i>Guitar World </i>in the mid-90s and suffering through technically proficient assholes like Steve Lukather and Billy Setzer putting Billy Corgan on blast for not staying true to rock'n'roll's roots. It's easy enough to dismiss <i>Slaughterhouse </i>as preaching to the choir (albeit one known to be stingy around the collection plate), or just point out that even the most intense internet test-tubing can't save a wack album (see also: Asher Roth), but it's that impotent defensiveness that ultimately makes you think Dr. Dre might've been right about these guys.</p></div>"|13373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13373-slaughterhouse/|5.5|Ian Cohen

Electro-popper Woolfy comes in for the theoretically profile-raising comp treatment next, as <i>If You Know What's Good For Ya!!</i> snaps up a handful of the singles they've released since 2005 and pairs them with fresh material. The result is a neat compendium of many of the decade's electronic-pop trends, from digestible funk-punk to spaced-out disco.</p>
<p>Lead single ""Oh Missy"" (which appeared as early as 2005 as an A-side, was remixed on a label comp in 2007, and was again released as a 12"" earlier this year, presumably to prep for <i>If You Know</i>) borrows DFA's oldest, and best, trick: Trojan Horse-ing in a great pop number under the guise of a dance track. Slated second here, Woolfy wastes no time introducing listeners to what remains his best song: speedy congos, serrated, upsmacked guitar chords, and, as Woolfy's big-floor vocals drop, thwumping bass. ""I'll tell you what's wrong/ If it makes you see the whole half of it"", he declares with the confidence of man who is actually saying something. As a preening takedown of a rogue babe, ""Oh Missy"" touches on (without getting too wild) late-70s pop-disco Stones.</p>
<p><i>If You Know</i> rarely reaches ""Oh Missy""'s heights again, but there's plenty to like: the quick-finger guitar strut of ""Odyssey"" and the hard-scrabble electro-punk of ""The Warehouse"" (both previously released) retain their sense of craftsmanship and their nervy hooks. ""Looking Glass"" is the obvious breakout candidate among the new tracks, with a big, infectious synth-pop groove and Woolfy's shouty, processed verses leading to a soft, stuttered chorus: ""Don't/ Take/ Your/ Eyes/ Off me."" ""Sonic Monday"" is a drizzly, undeniably British ballad, developing slowly as swaths of digitized noise patter about; it's saccharine and weightless in the way Bernard Sumner's slower moments were.</p>
<p>Woolfy's pop instincts remain mostly on point, though the Lindstrøm-lite of ""Loa the Disco"" is undercooked and ""Pink Champagne"" (the final original composition before the remixes) is either drearily heavy-handed or a fitting ""the drugs don't work""-style salve depending on your tolerance for weepy closers. The remixes-- Carlos Hernandez's lounge-y take on ""Two Far Gone"" and Lee Douglas' lightening of ""The Warehouse""-- serve only to move <i>If You Know</i> from a manageable 45 minutes to more than an hour in length.</p>
<p>It's fine, though, that <i>If You Know</i> arrives with blemishes; nothing about Woolfy's track record suggested a coherent, workable, full-length was in the cards. <i>If You Know</i> is a bit perplexing-- if we're collecting, why not collect all of the mixes?-- but ultimately a useful tool for putting to bed Woolfy's past while eyeing his future.</p></div>"|13387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13387-if-you-know-whats-good-for-ya/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

But even in an age of instant global communication, Australia is still pretty far away from most of the rest of us. So when this Melbourne rock foursome with stadium-sized ambitions first landed in my inbox last October, it was a modest revelation. Curtis Vodka, Alaska's remixer extraordinaire, was pushing all the right tech-textural buttons on an epic reworking of ""Sweet Disposition"", a majestic anthem which, if annoyingly derivative, had ""mainstream hit"" written all over it. Listeners who Shazam'd the original after hearing it in ads for Sky Sports TV in the UK-- or, stateside, on the trailer and soundtrack to alt-emo romcom <i>(500) Days of Summer</i>-- probably know the feeling.</p>
<p>Hemispheric differences may have given the Temper Trap room to develop their radio-friendly sound without getting pushed prematurely into the spotlight (for real: sorry, Black Kids), but otherwise their debut album could've been made just about anywhere. <i>Conditions</i> is one for the Coldplay set-- all tightly executed grandiosity and U2 pedals, generally with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbE1-ZPz-Cg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title='The Doves, ""Pounding""'>pounding</a> drums, soaring vocals about steadfastness or mortality or whatever, one rumbling bass note per arpeggiated guitar chord, and a modest drizzling of synths. Unfortunately, when you adopt the trappings of revolutionary significance without showing much interest in advancing beyond the revolutions of 20 years ago, you sound ridiculous. Southern conservatives are super concerned about racial discrimination now, you guys.</p>
<p>Defined by almost any measure except musical creativity or lyrical ingenuity, the Temper Trap are a lot better than I'm making them sound. Dougie Mandagi's virtuosic falsetto is the kind of instrument that should come with a money-back Jeff-Buckley-comparison guarantee. When Mandagi comes in, over ecclesiastical keyboard stabs and handclaps on opener ""Love Lost"", there's a brief glimmer of hope <i>Conditions</i> will end up being more like TV on the Radio, with all that New York group's restless adventurousness, than, um, whichever band we gave that ""U.2"" rating. His bandmates are no slouches, either, as instrumental finale ""Drum Song"" shows. If its jagged rhythmic attack owes something to Arctic Monkeys, then it's no coincidence-- producer Jim Abbiss also helmed the brainy Brits' fateful debut, along with albums for Kasabian, Adele, and others.</p>
<p>What the Temper Trap do devastatingly well is drape post-office-party mistake-hookup tackiness in the lofty imagery of global struggle. You can just picture Mandagi standing on a mountaintop for ""Sweet Disposition"", his hair blowing in Bono's wind, but remember, ladies: Some insincere sketchball with limited imagination is going to use this to try to get you to have <i>sex</i> with him. ""Just stay there/ 'Cause I'll be coming over,"" Mandagi booms. ""Won't stop to surrender."" Well, love is a battlefield, right?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Temper Trap's pairing of sweeping portentousness with mundane douchebaggery is trickier to overlook. ""I pledge myself allegiance to a battle not to sleep at home,"" Mandagi clarifies on another single, the reasonably catchy uptempo electro-rocker ""Fader"". Synth-dripping slow jam ""Fools"" adds, ""I want it, I want it, I want it,"" amid rebukes to unnamed, uhh, fools. Cold War Kids-ish indie nod ""Down River"" pulls out all the orchestral, choral, and vaguely baptismal flourishes in <i>Neon Bible</i>'s book to repeat, ""Go, don't stop."" And remember ""Love Lost""? It adapts a line from ""Amazing Grace"" into a request to ""flash your heart."" Yeah, open up your shirt and-- ohhh. One more in the name of love: Latest UK single ""Science of Fear"" samples Robert F. Kennedy's famous remarks on the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. I take it Mandagi still hasn't found what he's looking for.</p>
<p>It's telling to learn where, in fact, the Temper Trap did come from. The first thing producer Abbiss apparently heard from the band was a demo of ""Soldier On"", <i>Conditions</i>' Muse-rific nadir. Mandagi tells the BBC, ""His wife really liked it so apparently they had a moment together and out of obedience to his wife Jim decided to record us."" The six-minute track moves from <i>Grace</i>-ful guitar and falsetto into gnashing prog-rock bombast, until Mandagi is seriously howling at ""death."" I'm gonna assume he means the little one-- what the French call ""<i>la petite mort</i>.""</p></div>"|13368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13368-conditions/|4.6|Marc Hogan

Elverum & Sun']|2009-08-14 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 18:59:08.638154|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1v7juoze134.1.6:0.1.0.$13299/=1$13299.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>At this point, some 13 years after those first Microphones cassettes and eight years since the watershed <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>, we tend to know what to expect from Phil Elverum. The production will be cavernous and downright primordial, the instruments resounding as though carved from bone and strung with wool. Natural and elemental imagery will abound. And, of course, we'll be treated to Elverum's unmistakable, unsophisticated, ever wonder-struck mumble. Yet Elverum has a way of playing with those expectations. And, more to the point, knowing what to expect can make us underestimate, which can in turn lead to surprise. If last year's <i>Lost Wisdom</i> outing with Julie Doiron and Fred Squire served to remind us that, stripped of all the scuzz and sonic bramble, Elverum is a damn good songwriter, then <i>Wind's Poem</i> now reminds us that with all his characteristic production dressings in place-- surprise!-- Phil can still be a force of nature.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Poem</i> has been touted as Elverum's ""black metal"" album, and Phil has made no secret of his relatively newfound affinity for Xasthur and other lynchpins of the unholy genre. Yet apart from opener ""Wind's Dark Poem"", a slice of bona fide hellfire, any outside influence here feels wholly absorbed into the fabric of what is every bit a Mount Eerie concoction. Even ""Wind's Dark Poem"" retains the singer's characteristic vocal delivery and cadence, and other loud ones-- ""The Hidden Stone"", ""The Mouth of Sky""-- smack as much of the chunky, bowel-rattling heavy riffage of <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>'s ""I Want to Be Cold"" and ""Samurai Sword"" as anything else. All of which makes Elverum less chameleon and more collector of sounds, assimilating them as he sees fit to suit his grand artistic vision. A vision, as he also told us, that's been there all along: ""I think I've always been drawn to things that sounded massive, or at least created this feeling of an immense vibe.""</p>
<p>And massive and immerse are certainly two ways to describe <i>Wind's Poem</i>-- though they hardly tell the whole story. To better do so we might divide the 12 tracks that comprise the record into two rough camps: the loud and thoroughly rattled, noted above, and the renewed and becalmed, chief among them ""Summons"", ""Ancient Questions"", and the epic lullaby ""Through the Trees"", which effectively swallows whole any hell raised by ""Wind's Dark Poem"". The story, then, emerges from the way these songs alternatingly devour or are born from the smoldering ashes of one another, clear skies giving way to ferocious muddle, which in turn begets light and insight anew. The lyrics, appropriately, deal in fundamental dualities. ""My Heart Is Not at Peace"" and ""Summons"" each posit wind as both ""destroyer"" and ""revealer,"" ""Ancient Questions"" pits doubt against a sense of purpose, and closer ""Stone's Ode"" is divided into two distinct movements, one assured and awash in the clarity of day, one less so and detailing the onset (literal and metaphorical, one assumes) of night.</p>
<p>What makes <i>Wind's Poem</i> among the most compelling and fully realized Mount Eerie releases to date is the record's ability to satisfy several types of listeners on several contextual levels. The iTunes shuffle junky, for starters, can excerpt almost any selection here and find something to marvel at on its own terms. The Elverum obsessive will waste no time seeking god in the details, the recurring musical and thematic touches, and the intertextual puzzle created across the artist's catalog. Even considering the most basic mechanics of the album format, <i>Poem</i> gets it right: a rock solid opener that draws the listener right in, an effective closer that recapitulates lyrical and musical motifs from across the record, fine pacing, well-balanced dynamics, and the overall sense that one has completed a journey and emerged in a slightly different metaphysical place by the end of those 55 minutes. But then, too, there are the 11-and-a-half-minute second track, the pure pulsating noise cut, and other outliers, as if to remind us that despite any concessions made to the listener-- and Phil has moved well beyond the often formless experiments of the early Microphones releases-- this is still by no means a record to be digested lightly. And thank goodness for that.</p></div>"|13299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13299-winds-poem/|8.2|Matthew Solarski

A Harvard dropout and <i>Village Voice</i> theater critic is coerced by her boyfriend, heir to a British maternity-goods empire, to record some music. The suggestion is seconded by a Parisian punk-shop owner then new to New York. The song is called ""Disco Clone"", a brittle dance track by a hot woman about how all the hot women at the clubs look exactly the same, but that shouldn't stop boys from wanting to bed them. It's funny-- it's a disco track, but a disco track that ridicules and defiles the image of disco.</p>
<p>Later, the dropout's record is produced by the almost-teacher, who has taken to wearing zoot suits. She calls him an ""ice-cream soda,"" which is supposed to be an insult. Along the way, they're joined by a saxophonist who punches his audience members in the face, and a couple of friends from suburban Detroit who record abstract funk with beat poetry over it. This all happens in the span of about four years, during which Michael Zilkha and Michel Esteban of Ze Records-- and August Darnell, Cristina, James Chance and Was (Not Was)-- change the shape of music around them. Very New York.</p>
<p>The records released on Ze at the dawn of the 80s wouldn't have had a comfortable home elsewhere. August Darnell, the almost-teacher (he earned a Master's in English with the intention of joining the vocation, but music intervened), had some success with Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, but wanted more freedom-- freedom he got as Ze's in-house producer and with his new project, Kid Creole and the Coconuts. James Chance and the Contortions made violent, anti-musical rock that people were calling ""no wave,"" but Ze invited him to record disco-- a chance he jumped at, presumably because it would enable him to piss off the fans he had accidentally earned trying to piss people off.</p>
<p>Some of the label's singles were fairly straight disco with a flair for theater-- ""Deputy of Love"", for example, by Darnell's friends Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band. Others, like Was (Not Was)'s ""Wheel Me Out,"" were songs only familiar when broken into discrete parts-- a disembodied string melody, the purr of a woman's voice, hippie poetry, UFO sound effects making casual visits, Latin percussion. But together? Unpalatable to everyone-- too glamorous and dance-oriented for the punks to buy, too freakish to ever work consistently at mainstream clubs or at Puerto Rican block parties on the Lower East Side. When it came time for the label to issue a compilation in 1981, they called it <i>Mutant Disco</i>.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Ze 30</i>, compiled by Ze's Michel Esteban and Strut Records' Quinton Scott, you might think that Ze was a pretty good label instead of a great one. You would be misled. It certainly isn't the fault of the misfits who recorded all this fearless, cockeyed music, but <i>Ze 30</i> is a confused baby. About half the cuts are obvious and half are obscure, raising the question of just who Strut and Ze were aiming at with this thing. After several listens, my guess is two-fold: Long-time fans and first time listeners. Naturally, they hit the woods.</p>
<p>Complaints: I don't need to hear Alan Vega of Suicide performing rockabilly. Material and Nona Hendyx's ""Bustin' Out"" definitely belongs here, but the extended version is a waste of space. I'm glad for James Chance's ""Roving Eye""-- ""Contort Yourself"" is, in the realm of 80s art-rock compilations, overrated and overexposed, which is funny considering that most people would probably find it unlistenable. Casino Music's cover of ""The Beat Goes On"" makes me very uncomfortable, which is more a statement of fact than a complaint. Selections for some of the label's biggest artists-- including Cristina, Was (Not Was), and Kid Creole-- feel like second choices, and while the songs are great, their inclusion feels problematic if the compilation really is being marketed as ""the one Ze Records album you need to own.""</p>
<p>But with access to a catalog as deep and frequently innovative as Ze's, ""failure"" is an accident of the mouth, a word with no meaning. The selections here do support Ze's reputation. They illustrate, in bullet points, not only what made the label special, but what made them influential to artists like the Chromatics, LCD Soundsystem, even M.I.A. (whose ""Sunshowers"" takes its name and hook from a Dr. Buzzard/August Darnell song). Lizzy Mercier Descloux's ""Hard-Boiled Babe"" is practically dubstep-- so unprecedented that it's hard not to wonder what they were thinking while making it. On nearly every track, rules are broken, boundaries are stretched and pushed back into other territories.</p>
<p>(As an aside for people who might buy this but would want to supplement it with other tracks, here are some suggestions: Was (Not Was)'s ""Wheel Me Out""; Cristina's ""Disco Clone""; Lizzy Mercier Descloux's ""Funky Stuff"" or ""Lady O K'pele""; Kid Creole's ""Annie, I'm Not Your Daddy""; Coati Mundi's ""Me No Pop I""-- all songs I'd put on a single-disc compilation of the label, all available through Ze's own digital shop, eMusic, or iTunes.)</p>
<p>The current musical moment isn't a particularly great time to reissue this material. There's no particularly great time to be a brave weirdo. Or, it's always a great time. <i>Mutant Disco</i>, unfortunately, is out of print (though available through digital retailers). <i>Ze 30</i> is a decent substitution, and is accompanied by great notes rife with first-person accounts of the label's history.</p>
<p>When Suicide went into the studio with the Cars' Ric Ocasek, Ze co-founder Michael Zilkha hoped they'd record something like Donna Summer's chilly, momentous ""I Feel Love"", a track that re-imagined what disco could do without abandoning it. The duo recorded ""Dream Baby Dream"", an insistent tick-tock of drum machines and glockenspiels offset by the moans of Alan Vega, who does a good impression of someone who has just taken a bad fall. A song by a band that hadn't found a venue they couldn't get kicked out of, sung by a frontman who used to take to the audience swinging a bike chain. A band that, three years earlier, had recorded a ten-minute long exercise in horrific screaming called ""Frankie Teardrop"". And a couple of label heads thought they could squeeze a dance hit out of them.</p></div>"|13361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13361-ze-30-ze-records-story-1979-2009/|7.7|Mike Powell

He makes records largely on his own, playing a huge array of instruments, and then he does the artwork and the impressive animated videos himself. He made his name with three increasingly excellent albums of glow-in-the-dark, ramshackle indie pop that showcase his odd falsetto and even odder inner world. He's also the author of one of the best modern murder ballads I've heard lately in ""Molten Light"", from last year's <i>Soft Airplane</i>.</p>
<p>It's natural for a guy with VanGaalen's skill set to want to branch out, and so we now get Black Mold's <i>Snow Blindness Is Crystal Antz</i>, a collection of 19 mostly short instrumentals that give him a chance to stretch out and experiment. It makes sense to release it under the banner of an alter ego, because it really is a diversion from his output under his own name. His electro-acoustic tracks range from nicely developed pieces that skillfully blend contrasting textures and timbres to inconsequential sketches that feel like dry runs for something he might try in a more interesting song later.</p>
<p>On the positive side of that coin, ""Metal Spider Webs"" opens the album by smashing together a little cello and clarinet with a heap of chimes and bubbling synthesizer, while the synth arpeggiations and pulsing static of ""Swimming to Food"" telegraph a sort of lonely sadness. The longest track, ""Wet Ferns"", is a drifting, buzzing song that harks back to a time when people made whole albums of Ondioline music and still thought of the future as a place we were all going to. ""Rotten Walls"" suggests he might try composing new scores for classic arcade games. On the other hand, there are a number of tracks that don't get beyond the idea phase. ""Smoking Rat Shit"" and ""Dr. Snouth"" are sketchy glitch experiments, while ""No Dream Nation"" is full of seemingly random drum hits and doesn't hit its stride until it's mostly over and brings in an eerie synth solo.</p>
<p>The less satisfying tracks aren't all a waste, though. For instance, ""Tetra Pack Heads"" is a little too unfocused on its own to invite me back, but it explores some interesting individual moments and sounds I'd like to see him return to. ""Toxic Lake"" is an aggressively noisy percussion extravaganza he could clearly use as a blueprint in the future. Ultimately, <i>Snow Blindness</i> isn't essential listening for anyone but VanGaalen's most dedicated fans, but it is an enjoyable, occasionally even great record. Musicians with eclectic approaches need release valves for their excesses, and this seems to serve that function for VanGaalen. Hopefully, indulging some of his restlessness will help him come back even more focused and hungry on his next full-length under his own name.</p></div>"|13365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13365-snow-blindness-is-crystal-antz/|6.1|Joe Tangari

And of all those grizzled sorts, Toth stood among the most prolific, churning out tapes and CD-Rs and proper albums at a pace so feverish one simply assumed something special would come of it all.</p>
<p>Toth got close, too (especially with the almost-excellent <i>Buck Dharma</i>) before crafting more straightforward, song-oriented albums. He slowed his pace, concentrated, and emerged with the Sky High Band's <i>Second Attention</i> in 2006 and the Lee Ranaldo-produced <i>James &amp; the Quiet</i> in 2007. While those records maintained traces of Toth's unhinged Americana, they resigned themselves to transmitting tunes and images directly. After a deal with Nonesuch Records fell through, Toth landed on quasi-major Rykodisc with a sterling supporting cast that included Wilco's Nels Cline and Vetiver's Andy Cabic. Finally, one assumed, Toth was poised to crack the casing that had long made him a second-class songwriter.</p>
<p>But that didn't happen: Despite its pristine guitar leads and a handful of stunning soul ballads (""Look in on Me"", in particular), <i>Waiting in Vain</i> met largely lukewarm reviews and audiences still trying to decide if Toth was a freak, a folk, or neither. That's when a bad situation turned into a catastrophe. His band-- including longtime collaborator and wife, Jexie Lynn Toth, or Vanishing Voice-- quit during the middle of a multi-month tour. He persevered, losing his job back home and spending a night in jail. As he's done for most of his career, Toth wrote a lot, though, allegedly churning out 50 songs and submitting 12 of those demos to Rykodisc. Shortly thereafter, he says, he was dropped. No big label deal, no bright horizons: He was just another good songwriter who'd never made it to the big leagues.</p>
<p>Those dozen hard-luck demos comprise <i>Born Bad</i>, a limited-edition vinyl release that's more memorable for its circumstances than its songs. Shifting between boozing outlaw country, hard-linining morose ballads, and self-deprecating wry folk, <i>Born Bad</i> is mostly raw nerves and hurt feelings. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but-- from Hank Williams and Chris Bell to Elliott Smith and Will Johnson-- it's just been done better. On the title track, Toth borrows the skeleton of Swans' ""Failure"" and tosses in lifted Dylan nothings-- ""I was dialing in a feral mind transferal salt lick stew-eyed suicide""-- for unequivocal sad-bastard measure. He cries when he reads the paper, curses journalists questioning him, cuts himself compulsivel, does cocaine on baby-changing tables, and generally moans about his crimes against himself and the world. ""I don't believe it'd bother me to die,"" he offers somewhat cheerfully above a Tennessee Two trot on opener ""Agent of Destruction"". Beneath it all, though, Toth keeps a hint of humor (""The Forgiveness Factory) and-- more importantly-- admits that the root of his problems is himself, not the world around him. ""I'm selfish and I'm stubborn but I deal with this every day,"" he sings at one point. He's likely not seeking forgiveness for <i>Born Bad</i>'s overwrought emotional folly, but he mostly gains it-- at least from me.</p>
<p>On <i>Born Bad</i>'s ""Creature of Habit"", Toth moans, ""Sometimes you just need to hear the music from the other side of the room/ Sometimes you just need perspective and a different point of view."" That helps explain why <i>Hard Knox</i>, a collection of 14 tunes recorded by Toth at home in Knoxville between 2002 and 2007, works so well: Freed from the transient aesthetic or emotional whims that ruin <i>Born Bad</i>, <i>Hard Knox</i> simply offers the best of what Toth vows is a sizable archive. All told, it's one of his finest moments to date. Sure, like Toth's career, it's an uneven collection, but-- with its shifting moods and modes of productions-- it keeps the listener close. ""The Drag Pit' is a silly waltz of poignant parables and scenes, while ""Trails"" documents the hardships of the romantic vagrant. Opener ""Arriving"" is stoic and chilling, rife with images of disaffection and crippled despair. Both on ""Lady of Situations"" and ""Saturday Delivery"", he sings softly with Jexie (they're back together, by the way) with wonderful intimacy and quiet, as if the two sat naked in their bedroom, huddled around a microphone as the sun rose. ""Lady of Situations"" is about dying, and ""Saturday Delivery"" is about cheating, but there's an unflagging sweetness behind these closed doors. We're simply lucky enough to have been invited.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Toth signed to Young God Records, the label run by Swans/Angels of Light founder Michael Gira. Young God accidentally served as a crucial foundation for the freak-folk movement by releasing the early and still most essential records of Devendra Banhart and Akron/Family. Gira, by all accounts an iron will with a wide imagination, was an essential influence on those records and in helping both bands find bigger ears. The best moments of Toth's 13-year career-- scattered in general and absent from <i>Born Bad</i> as they may be-- suggest Gira's again found a strong talent who needs the right sort of guidance to make, at last, some great statement.

And from there, is it ever on: 65 minutes of slightly spacy live-band psych-disco, Hawkwind jamming with Isaac Hayes with percussion from the Incredible Bongo Band. If that sounds like a party, well, it is a party; you'll want to grab a drink and do your damndest to have a good time. To that end, the buzzing, burbling four-on-the-floor dancefloor fillers the PHB-- a cadre of hot New York-area instrumentalists, joined by guests from TV on the Radio and the Dap-Kings, among others-- is a resounding success; a few numbers stand head and shoulders above the rest, but there's a uniform quality to it all, due in no small part to the hydra-headed band's instrumental virtuosity and obvious love of all the sounds they're unabashedly calling their own. But this is also a long-playing record that feels awfully long, due in no small part to the band's deft but somewhat diagnostic handling of the music. In other words, party or not, nobody's gonna blame you for keeping an eye towards the door.</p>
<p>The PHB's sense of reverence for their sources can lend the record a samey quality; sure, there's a few miles between the wormhole groove of ""The Martyr"" and the proggy strut of ""Dim the Lights"", but they're on a similar continuum, with round lines bass underpinning jutting horns or spacey synths or what-have-you. It's hard to point to a track and say ""this sounds precisely like that,"" but there's not been quite enough reconfiguration to result in anything intriguingly new; they're more groove than song most of the time, but boy, do they groove. As such, the parts of the band's verve that can't be drawn back to their record collections are largely the result of a spin through the Rolodex, and these guest turns behind the mic give the PHB its reason for being. Jon Spencer (yeah, that guy!) turns in a characteristically groovy little blooz-swoon for ""Give It a Rest"", and Si*Sé's Carol C croons one out over the steely bump of ""You'll Disappear"" that might've proved a starmaking turn in another decade. Morgan Phalen of the Diamond Nights sounds like he showed up drunk and did his turn in one take, which lends the tune a looseness not often heard on the relatively lockstep LP. Oh, and Lady Tigra's verse, how can we start? Yes, that Lady Tigra-- from legendary hoopty-knock aficianados L'Trimm-- takes ""15 to 20"" for her own, and thank god for it; Tigra waxes funny and mildly paranoid and just a mite ""Rapture""-ous, and for really the only time on the LP that the Phenomenal Handclap Band justify all three words in their name at once.</p>
<p>And she's a ringer! And there's your trouble. The many folks who make up the Phenomenal Handclap Band do what they do well, but there's a feeling of anonymity to the band, due to their stable of stand-ins and their workmanlike performances, good as they are at jumbling up a few not-especially-disparate sounds. But the album gets into the most trouble by gleaning a good bit of its personality from outside sources; entirely their intention, I realize, but with the perhaps unintended effect of not leaving one with much impression of what the PHB really are. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the LP for anyone who can't make an hour on the treadmill, but there are a few tunes here worth hearing. Too bad you can't exactly make out who's cranking them out.</p></div>"|13376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13376-the-phenomenal-handclap-band/|6.2|Paul Thompson

It doesn't feel like long ago that I first discovered the label-- the way many others did, through its classic <i>Total 3</i> compilation, which opened my rock-leaning ears to a new strain of dance music that I instantly fell for. Minimal techno! How had I been unaware of this? That was 2001, three years after Wolfgang Voigt founded the Cologne-based imprint, and since then it has, of course, grown substantially in size and cultural import, breaking artists like the Field and Gui Boratto and establishing itself as a one-stop shop for all things minimal via its physical storefront in Cologne and distribution house. But in 2009, one wonders where Kompakt stands artistically. This year, it released a very nice Ada mix, but it's been a few years since the label presented an exciting new artist, and its last truly essential LP was 2007's breakout <i>From Here We Go Sublime</i> by the Field. So, does Kompakt have the juice to go another decade?<i></i></p>
<p><i>Total 10</i>, the label's latest collection of exclusive cuts and recent hits, provides a timely opportunity-- an anniversary edition of sorts-- for its makers to address that question. More so than previous installments, which have gradually dipped in quality over recent years (the last great <i>Total</i> comp being the sixth, in 2005) but still remained mostly enjoyable, this year's <i>Total</i> carries with the weight of increased expectations, and even the record sleeve's regal purple and gold coloring seems to suggest legacy, or at the very least continued relevance. So does it deliver? Well, that depends on which portion of the jam-packed, two-and-a-half hour house-and-techno cornucopia you're talking about.</p>
<p>Minimal techno lends itself to slow builds, long stretches where the beat repetition becomes a continuous throb, and Kompakt comps generally aren't known for their brevity. But <i>Total 10</i> is a monster even by those terms, with an average track length of around seven minutes, and the best way to think about it is in two distinct parts-- Discs One and Two, conveniently. The first is easily the better of the pair, and it opens with a bang-- or, well, a serve. DJ Koze, one of the label's more underrated producers, kicks things off with ""40 Love"", a blippy Nintendo-style cut built from live tennis-match sounds (no, seriously)-- a forehand and its return, crowd gasps, and a Monica Seles-like grunt to boot. He uses the crisp pops and dramatic oohs and ahhs as pieces of his arrangement, and what should sound like a gimmick is simply fun and oddly compelling. The rest of disc one, heavier on undulating grooves than we're used to from the label, matches Koze's winner in quality and playfulness.</p>
<p>Previous <i>Total</i> collections have separated new and already-released tracks into dedicated discs for each, but this year Kompakt has wisely jumbled the two. It makes for a more balanced overall listen, even if most of the best songs reside on the first CD. Here, you've got Dirk Leyers' fantastic mix of Justus Köhncke's ""(It's Gonna Be) Alright"", an epic, minimal disco-funk piece replete with chopped-up vocal samples and whiny guitars that annihilates just about everything on the Juan MacLean's similar-sounding LP from earlier this year. There's ""Lovestoned"", a standout track from Ada's <i>Adaptations</i> mixtape, which provides probably the best example of her unique balance of texture, danceability, and smoothed-out sultriness. New jams favor deep-house wallop over glitch and restraint, and thumpers such as Thomas/Mayer's ""Total 9"" and Nicolas Stefan's ""Closer"" explore club-friendly possibilities with zany basslines, insistent snares, and ramped-up BPM.</p>
<p>If <i>Total 10</i>'s first disc has you convinced of Kompakt's longevity and ability to reinvent itself outside of established microhouse norms, then the second will likely call that into question. It's here where the compilation starts to sag under the weight of its own bulk and relies too much on the type of repurposed tracks that ultimately did in the largely disappointing <i>Kompakt 100</i> from 2004. Even those of us who pay very close attention to this type of thing almost need a legend to sort out its various tag-team contributors (Mayburg = Michael Mayer and Jörg Burger; It's a Fine Line = Ivan Smagghe and Tim Paris), and the remixes included don't improve upon their originals in most instances (case in point Thomas Fehlmann's take on the Field's ""The More That I Do""). Add to that a few head scratchers such as Jürgen Paape's circus-y ""Ofterschwang"" and Pachanga Boys' utterly bizarre Mexican-pop closer ""Fiesta Forever"", and it begins to feel like a decidedly lopsided compilation.</p>
<p>But-- and this is a big but-- scattered among <i>Total 10</i>'s generally lesser second-disc material are a few really great songs, the kind that save the album from becoming an unnecessary, why-do-I-need-another-Kompakt-comp kind of release. One of those is Matias Aguayo's ""Walter Neff"", which, come to think of it, is also the best track of the whole collection. With the finest hand claps-and-cowbell arrangement I've heard since the last LCD Soundsystem LP, it's ostensibly modern disco, but more than that it's a future-pop number as good or better than anything being done by YACHT, Neon Indian, or any other recent techno-savvy whizkids messing around with dance beats and pop sensibilities. The darn thing sounds so fresh and of-the-moment, and next to a dozen or so other similarly strong cuts here, it makes me think that, yeah, even 10 years in and literally thousands of minimal tracks later, Kompakt's still got plenty of gas left in the tank.</p></div>"|13344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13344-total-10/|7.1|Joe Colly

To his credit, Diplo's always seemed like a genuine, serious student of his favorite sounds, and the tunes have been almost uniformly hot, so it was easy to accept not only an icon-in-her-own-right like M.I.A. but also a savvy chameleon like Santigold and even, to a degree, expertly crass party-starters like Spank Rock.</p>
<p>But, I suppose, a line must be drawn in the sand, and thrusting her crotch in the air obliviously on the wrong side of the divide is Amanda Blank. She's no Maya or Santi for sure, but vitriol against the girl has been especially intense considering that up until now she'd been on only a couple of mixtapes and on one track from Spank Rock's debut. Perhaps some of the extra-forceful disdain is owing to the fact that Blank sort of feels like the last bulwark between some imagined indie community of shared self-awareness and an outright void of crassness. Either she's working too hard to construct a mimetic parody of materialistic fuck-pop, or she's not working hard enough to separate herself from it. Either way, I don't see how you're not better off listening to Lady Gaga, who at least offers pretty good hooks.</p>
<p>A few good hooks, in fact, would go a considerable way toward redeeming Blank's largely forgettable debut, <i>I Love You</i>. Remember, Santigold's eponymous bow certainly didn't blaze any trails either, but it was chock full of irresistible, indelible tunes. Not so with Blank, who submits an album that runs a mere 33 minutes and yet still can't manage to outfit it properly, eschewing even the pursuit of catchiness and pop fun in favor of deathly deterministic robo-chants like ""Lemme get some/ You don't want none"" and ""hottest motherfucker on the whole damn block,"" repeated <i>ad nauseum</i>. (Admittedly, ""Big Heavy"" does have a nice Blondie-ish breeze.) The torpor extends to Diplo, Switch, and Blank's other beatminders, who largely recycle well-worn tricks they've ponied up elsewhere, from the skipping vocal samples and dancehall drum fills of ""Something Bigger, Something Better"" to the crunk claps of ""Lemme Get Some"". Only ""DJ"", with its burbling techno groove, really succeeds at wringing something useful from Blank's ""persona,"" evocatively communicating the self-abnegation of loneliness without sounding too much like a Peaches-level lobotomy victim. Of course, it's sandwiched between two tracks that troublingly rely on a beloved 1980s pop classic for much of their juice, Blank's <i>Top Ranking</i> mixtape holdover ""A Love Song"" (interpolating LL Cool J's ""I Need Love"") and <i>I Love You</i>'s first single, the pointlessly ""titillating"" ""Might Like You Better"", which cannibalizes Romeo Void's ""Never Say Never"". Keep in mind, to date these are Blank's two best-known songs.</p>
<p>Far more apropos is the straight-up cover of Vanity 6's trashy relic, ""Make-Up"", a song penned for the 80s pop tarts by their puppetmaster, Prince. I don't know who's responsible for picking this song for the album, but if it's Blank then I at least ought to tip my cap at her stunningly precise grasp of her own place within the Diploverse.</p></div>"|13158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13158-i-love-you/|2.0|Joshua Love

For a particularly startling run throughout 2007, it seemed like this odd Norwegian duo transformed themselves entirely with each new remix, offering overblown Italo-disco, or beatbox- and accordion-driven electro-gypsy-funk, or dark Jon Hassell-style percussive digital jazz. If they haven't quite been able to sustain this knack for total self-reinvention since, nonetheless the past year and a half has seen Pål Nyhus and Knut Sævik continue to cram together just about every sound that can fit in with a slow-mo four by four beat, and a fair few that can't.</p>
<p>You'd expect such a maximalist approach to get messy at times, and there are several points on the duo's gargantuan 2xCD remix compilation <i>We Gave It All Away, Now We Are Taking It Back </i>when it does just that, but Mungolian Jet Set nonetheless give the impression of knowing precisely what they are doing. Starting life as a modern jazz group but openly acknowledging the Orb as their current heroes, they balance the controlled chaos of Miles Davis' <i>Bitches Brew </i>with the roaming and ruminative repetition of <i>The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld</i>. The duo's debt to the latter record was already a clear-- and perhaps solitary-- thread of consistency throughout the group's work to date, both in sound design and feel, short-circuiting the exotic, the mysterious, and the unashamedly cheesy. Structuring their remix collection-- usually a utilitarian or at best ""mood-setting"" exercise-- as a kind of safari tour at the end of the universe makes the resemblance all-too-obvious, and yet it was the very best thing the duo could have done. With its acres of excess and ceaseless transformations, <i>We Gave It All Away </i>rams home even to the trained listener the essential alienness of this music.</p>
<p>If Mungolian Jet Set's only tricks were their polystylistic perversity, their legions of goblin singers and their canny allusions to a million pop reference points (see their stop-start take on Bob Marley's ""Could You Be Loved""), the attraction would quickly pall. Like all maximalists worth a damn, they have the producer's ears and attention to detail of minimalists. They can ""do"" deepness, as revealed on the spacious, acid-flecked tech-house of their own ""Madre (Epics Part 2)"", but even at their most overblown, their rhythms share all the hyper-rhythmic succulence of the most pointillist techno. And as with all maximalist musicians-- certainly the Orb before them-- the future danger for Mungolian Jet Set is that they come to seem like parodies of themselves, still charting celestial bodies but for no particular purpose or goal. Perhaps this set's weakest moment is the still-fine remix of the Shortwave Set's ""Glitches 'N' Bugs"". It's the one moment where they sound content not to challenge themselves, but rather to remain in the subservient position of skillful interior decorators for another artist's vision. It also channels rather too straightforwardly Andrew Weatherall circa 1992.</p>
<p>Let's hope it's a momentary lapse, because Mungolian Jet Set are far too good for this fate. Just listen to their take on Ronny &amp; Renzo's ""Big Smack &amp; Flies"": a rolling and roiling masterpiece of tribal percussion and cavernous dub bass. Perhaps the duo's most solemn effort to date, it astounds with its moist density, the layers of drums showering droplets of iridescent sweat as they slap against one another. Here and elsewhere (see their marvelously trancey new remix of Lulu Rouge's ""Melankoli"", too late to make it on here) the groove seems to spiral inwards as well as outwards, plumbing ever greater depths of intertwining, sensuous complexity. For all Mungolian Jet Set's comic allusions, their elaborate costumes and tongue-twisting remix titles, it's here at the very core of things that their singular magic is at its most powerful.</p></div>"|13301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13301-we-gave-it-all-away-now-we-are-taking-it-back/|8.1|Tim Finney

And that's not only because this self-professed ""real geek"" is a redhead who'll take harps over horns. Whereas Lily Allen and Amy Winehouse worked their way through the tabloids while breaking down life's troublesome bits into startlingly candid profundity on record, Welch aims for little but the outer reaches on her debut LP,  <i>Lungs</i>. Welch hovers high above her native London's seedy back alleys-- and she's looking skyward.</p>
<p>For this glittery free spirit, matters of the heart aren't simple, everyday occurrences-- they're as grand and mysterious as the big bang itself. ""The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out/ You left me in the dark,"" wails Welch on the audaciously huge ""Cosmic Love"".  <i>Lungs</i> is a cloud-headed introduction to Welch's world, where It Girl hype, coffins, violence, and ambition combust on impact; it's a platinum-shellacked demo reel drunk on its own hi-fi-ness.</p>
<p>Instead of giving this gothically pale 22-year-old with megaphone vox some classy pop-soul to work with à la Duffy or Adele, <i>Lungs</i> takes the smorgasbord approach. Welch bursts mouth-wide over garage rock, epic soul, pint-tipping Britbeat, and-- best of all-- a mystic brand of pop that's part Annie Lennox, Grace Slick, and Joanna Newsom. A lesser talent might fall prey to such veering stylistic change-ups (cough, Kate Nash, cough), but Welch powers through, her ear-snapping alarm call of a voice making <i>Lungs</i> sound like the work of a courageous artist rather than a group of well-paid producers. Of course, well-paid producers are still involved-- specifically, James Ford (Simian Mobile Disco, Arctic Monkeys), Paul Epworth (Bloc Party), and Stephen Mackey (Pulp).</p>
<p>Mackey is seemingly responsible for setting-up Welch's rock'n'roll bona fides, chalking up credits for the faux-shock White Stripes rip off ""Kiss With a Fist"" and the swinging and sinister ""Girl With One Eye"", which finds the singer in a gouging mood. Meanwhile, Ford and especially Epworth help their would-be star find a more unique sound that-- more often than not-- is overflowing with twinkling harps and breakup language writ large. Welch catapults off of Epworth's immense tribal drums on two of the record's finest, darkest opuses, ""Cosmic Love"" and the spooky stunner ""Blinding"". Ford's frothy, orchestrated style compliments Welch's theatrical bent on the swelling ""I'm Not Calling You a Liar"" and lilting single ""Dog Days Are Over"". Thanks to Welch's refreshingly immodest talent and vocal abilities, she not only conquers but thrives on the myriad bells and bobs pitched her way by her equally showy producers<i></i>.</p>
<p>""Seems that I have been held in some dreaming state/ A tourist in the waking world, never quite awake,"" begins Welch on ""Blinding"". The song is about Welch's desire to put her girlish dreams away and face reality, but it conjures a place that's frightfully untouchable all the same. When notions of big-budget music become increasingly rare and name-brand artists are giving fans intimate concerts from their bedrooms via YouTube, Florence Welch's zeal for all things bright and/or shiny comes off as its own act of rebel defiance. Coming to her senses isn't an option.</p></div>"|13372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13372-lungs/|7.2|Ryan Dombal

The record would sound completely different, or perhaps not even exist, without the influence of that band. But rather than accuse Wyss and Chettri of unoriginality or diagram the album's specific reference points-- how the gurgling intro to ""The Warm Currents Pull"" is reminiscent of ""Grass"" from <i>Feels</i> or that the synth build of ""Heavy Cloud Hustle"" recalls the one from <i>MPP</i>'s ""Brother Sport""-- it seems more constructive to judge the songs on their own merit. And the tracks that make up <i>Season Dreaming</i>, which are cobbled together with acoustic instrumentation and bedroom electronics and possess the hazy ambience of a long day at the beach, are mostly quite nice.</p>
<p>Blind Man's Colour rely heavily on texture and ambience, applying shimmering layers of background synths and dubby aquatics, but wisely keep most of their material tethered to a formal structure. <i>Season Dreaming</i> is the sort of record that could, in the wrong hands, easily drift off into formless bedlam, but the group's employment of simple melodies and tunefulness when needed keeps that from happening. A track like ""Heavy Cloud Hustle"" works because of that balance, its rolling percussion and stabs of heavy bass eventually making way for a lovey-dovey, almost classically doo-wop chorus. Other, simpler songs such as ""The Dinosaur Ride"", with a lo-fi acoustic backing reminiscent of current beach-pop tunesmiths Toro Y Moi and Washed Out, succeed in much the same manner.</p>
<p>That's not always the case, though, as <i>Season Dreaming</i> occasionally runs into trouble. The band gets ambitious on ""The Planets Explode"", sort of a noise cloud that floats over flickering keys and ghostly vocals, and loses their footing as the track becomes a bit murky and grey. But that's the exception here and not the rule. Elsewhere Blind Man's Colour show an enthusiasm, like other recent pop collagists Telepathe and Teengirl Fantasy, to incorporate sounds from outside the general sphere of experimental indie, utilizing heavy hip-hop bass on standout ""Jimmy Dove"" and building a distorted synth-pop lullaby with ""Sleeping Habits"". It's these moments of adventurousness that make <i>Season Dreaming</i> more than just a <i>Feels</i> knock-off, even if, yes, it does sound a lot like that album. But to discard it for that reason alone is also to deny the wide impact of a band like Animal Collective and preemptively rule out the many other acts coming down the pipeline also drawing upon them. And believe me, these guys won't be the last.</p></div>"|13225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13225-season-dreaming/|6.8|Joe Colly

There's still no right or easy way to mature-- do you stick with what works, playing the music that brought you all your fans, but never getting out from under those initial successes? Or do you slow down, stretch out, and risk sounding nothing like yourself, growing away from the sound that brought in your fans in the first place? This is a conundrum Jay Reatard's facing now, but it isn't the only one: After a successful run of singles on Matador that was compiled last year, <i>Watch Me Fall</i> is the first official full-length since being signed to the label. You can't blame the guy for feeling some pressure, and from the title to the lyrics and even its brooding cover, it's safe to say he might be.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean he hasn't risen to the challenge, however. Opening track and leadoff single ""It Ain't Gonna Save Me"" is ample proof that Jay Reatard can mature without the dull connotation the word carries, being as relentlessly catchy as it is careful in its arrangement. His seemingly tossed-off, self-hating lyrics may be even more potent over the irrepressibly cheery jangle of the track, especially in its brief, unexpected bridge. The track sets a tall bar for the record, but ""Before I Was Caught"" comes close, with more tortured lyrics and windmill guitar chords. However, Reatard's factory-like sewing together of hooks begins to overwhelm ""Man of Steel"", with an urgent ascending melody that leads to an uncertain breakdown that could belong to another song entirely. No doubt that Jay Reatard is a song machine, but some of the earlier album tracks sound assembled from parts lying around.</p>
<p>While the record peaks early, the rest of<i> Watch Me Fall</i> has a welcome diversity in melody and arrangements, and several late-album growers worth returning to-- the kind of thing that makes this an album, and not a singles compilation. ""Faking It"" gets plenty of mileage out of rapid, clean strumming and a fake British accent, then leads into a re-recorded version of ""I'm Watching You"", which made an appearance on last year's singles compilation, fleshing out its rough charm with warmer organ and putting Reatard's sweetened vocal up front. And he digs even deeper into New Zealand pop with the delirious ""Wounded"", cruising by entirely on acoustic guitars and the surprising flexibility of his voice: disarming falsetto, nasal demands, and impatient bark.</p>
<p>A lyric from ""Rotten Mind"" is where the album gets its title, and where Reatard sings paranoid fantasies in a near-whine in its verses, but is tempered by more of Reatard's falsetto and a rapid drum part that sounds like sneakers in a washing machine. The introversion of ""Nothing Now"" skirts indulgence through its buoyant Beatles-esque march before each verse returns. The last few tracks are the largest stretches for Reatard, leaving his screaming young self behind almost entirely: ""My Reality"" builds from more acoustic strumming, but has a sparse, echoing riff winding through it, and leads to a floating, disembodied chorus. ""Hang Them All"" ends on walls of harmony and a violin-laden outro in waltz time, while ""There Is No Sun"" has a gentle, natural flow, disturbed only by a hint of feedback in its final moments.</p>
<p><i>Watch Me Fall</i> is neither a reinvention nor a holding pattern for Reatard-- walking the line between them is tricky, but he continues to make doing so look easy. From his many earlier, artier side projects, to his recent fascination with Kiwi pop, to impromptu covers of tracks like Deerhunter's ""Fluorescent Gray"", listeners are often discovering music along with Reatard, watching him learn and adapt as he goes-- he's in step with listeners rather than one step ahead, and that makes already wildly accessible tunes even more approachable. Self-exploration may carry a little more pressure with it for Jay Reatard these days, but that joy of discovery-- plus the tunes, of course-- is what will keep listeners tuning in, whether he's freaking out over success or getting ready to conquer the world.</p></div>"|13371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13371-watch-me-fall/|7.9|Jason Crock

As bands of musicologist types fronted by fetching lady singers go, the Miami trio doesn't quite have the cosmopolitan chic of seductive NYC labelmates Ivy nor London's dance culture-conscious Saint Etienne. Yet they're not nearly as homespun as any number of pleated-skirt, jangly indie pop acts that live or die by the tambourine, either. Up the shamble factor, and they could well be regulars at Indietracks and the NYC, Athens, and New England Popfests, not selling many records but cultivating a cultishly devout international fanbase happily adorned in ""Tim Postmarks"" one-inch buttons. Put on a little more polish, and they might find themselves music-supervisor darlings, routinely opening sold out concert hall tours for, say, Pink Martini. Instead? They're in some kind of listener-demographic limbo, a Venn-diagram sliver between ""professional"" and ""adorable""-- and in today's caste culture, that can spell utter obscurity.</p>
<p>The problem isn't lost on the Postmarks, who, rather than dial it down DIY-ward, have ramped it up to the rafters with their second full-length collection of originals, <i>Memoirs at the End of the World</i>. In case the title and cover art didn't clue you in, this is the Postmarks hopped up on some Mancini/Morricone/John Barry axis of cinephilia (something they touched on on last year's cover outing <i>By the Numbers</i>) and embracing all the bold horns, cascading strings, and percussive panache that come with it. Lavish and evocative are the keywords here; there's even a harpsichord effect on ""Go Jetsetter"", a jazz trumpet outro on ""Theme From 'Memoirs'"", and some sitar business on the sumptuously arranged ""All You Ever Wanted"". Several tracks also showcase a hitherto unheard grit: ""Don't Know Till You Try"", with its electronic chirps and dramatic brass, starts out sounding like a lite version of Broadcast's ""Pendulum"", while ""For Better...Or Worse?"" has all the tension of a spy thriller chase sequence, complete with a timpani-accented finale. Some more discerning listeners might rightly accuse the band of studio arsenal overkill, but for the most part <i>Memoirs</i> congeals into a thing of pristine orchestrated pop beauty. There isn't a misstep on here, even if you probably won't hear an out-and-out single either.</p>
<p>With the cinematic leanings, it's tempting to position the Postmarks of <i>Memoirs</i> alongside Portishead, and, especially, the later Hooverphonic records, but vocalist Tim Yehezkely is in a decidedly different league. Rather than play the vamp here, Yehezkely sounds like the comely girl staring wistfully out the window on the cover of the first Postmarks disc. This is not a bad thing, and in fact can make for a compelling dialectic, akin to movie star theory's great paradox that stars seem simultaneously ""just like us"" and of another world altogether. Yehezkely, with her limited range and slightly detached delivery, effectively bridges that gap between the music's indulgent/escapist tendencies and our desire to connect with it despite that distance. With her the Postmarks very well may have found a way to speak to both of the indie pop worlds they once seemed so precariously caught between: an unlikely marriage of craft and unpracticed charm, and a music made for dreamers and by dreamers. Can't wait for the sequel.</p></div>"|13355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13355-memoirs-at-the-end-of-the-world/|7.6|Matthew Solarski

Analog-y, downbeat electro-goth has a rap sheet too long. Silk Flowers have the fortune, however, of sounding less like a Xerox of so many legendary bands and more like one of their minor contemporaries: <i>Silk Flowers</i> feels less like the grand statements of Suicide, Cabaret Voltaire, or PiL and more like the quiet, parallel contributions from (to name two reissued examples) Ike Yard or White Noise.</p>
<p>It's not an issue of authenticity, because unless Silk Flowers actually live in a meat locker, sleep upside down, and feast exclusively on the discarded ink cartridges of 1980s fax machines, no one lives this life. But Silk Flowers' aggro-skronk machinations sound more legitimately humid and creaking than, say, the buzzed-over SALEM's ""We take drugs, so many drugs even our moms and aunts know""-distensions. Nor is it an issue of fidelity; Silk Flowers' crusted-over instrumentation seems like a choice (<i>Silk Flowers</i> was produced by noted fuzz aficionado Fred Thomas of Saturday Looks Good to Me), sure, but it's one made by the album's instrumentation and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Silk Flowers' real talent lies in their ability to carve hummable, head-bobbing moments out of decidedly downtrodden elements.  Despite a list of influences eclectic and goth-y, and despite a singer doomed to Ian Curtis and/or Cookie Monster comparisons, Silk Flowers' pop instincts are surprisingly strong. Album opener ""Flash of Light"" pulses warmly, with symphonic synth patches providing soft footing for the singer's noir ranting. ""Costume"" loops a simple vocal-- ""All over their hands""-- over a canned beat and tremulous high end. ""Night Shades"", wordless and giddily propulsive, stirs up a near-pogo-worthy burst of analog synth putty.</p>
<p>Silk Flowers also have the good sense to keep their anti-anthems short.  You might feel a tinge of self-consciousness listening to the punky, lo-fi bleat of ""Cheap Shot"" or dour whimpering of ""Sand"" (""I felt like I was drowning but no one heard my plea"", rhymed later with, you got it, ""eternity""), but you'll feel a lot less self conscious for three minutes than you would for six or seven. The whole of <i>Silk Flowers</i> clocks in at an almost EP-worthy 27 minutes, with only one track even approaching the five-minute mark.</p>
<p>It's a credit to Silk Flowers, then, that they've managed, via brevity and swampy pop moments, to craft a murky, legitimately spooky debut. <i>Silk Flowers</i> is modest in both aim and accomplishment, but it never feels forced, gauche, or needlessly retro-fitted.</p></div>"|13369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13369-silk-flowers/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

Getting tagged with these contradictory stereotypes-- a classically trained workhorse mastering the canon versus an improvisational, intemperate tinkerer dismantling the rules-- goes a long way toward describing the Warp mainstay's musical output. He can sound technically brilliant and wickedly provocative at times, whether it's with restless, distended breakbeat patterns, buoyant bass-heavy fusion excursions, or airy combinations of these and other styles. And on his new album, in a gesture that could be a challenge in both senses of the word, he merely plugs in his bass and lets his playing speak for itself.</p>
<p>And bass, unaltered and without digital delay or effects, it definitely all you'll hear, whether it's delicate melodic progressions, arpeggiated chords or spitfire runs up the fretboard. While Jenkinson's skillful playing, the vital pulse of tracks like ""Cooper's World"" from <i>Hard Normal Daddy</i> or ""Circlewave 2"" from <i>Hello Everything</i>, has earned serious plaudits and a shout-out from Flea, it may be slightly surprisingly to hear how classically oriented some of the songs on <i>Solo Electric Bass 1</i> are. Granted, he claims to have taught himself classical guitar at age 10, but the elegant, breakneck playing on tracks like ""S.E.B. 6"" resembles that of a Spanish guitarist, and ""S.E.B. 5"" is a rubbery, staccato splatter of notes that belies the thickness of bass strings. Hyperactive ""S.E.B. 8"" showcases Jenkinson's antsy side, bouncing between slap-happy antics and more slow and soulful passages. As the naming convention and out-of-order tracks suggest, the songs blend into each other. It creates an album weighed toward showcasing masterful execution that leaves a pretty muted general impression. Unless you're predisposed toward technical prowess and solo bass recordings, it's probably going to come off as more of a clinic than a collection of great songs.</p>
<p>In a 2006 <i>XLR8R</i> interview with Pitchfork contributor Mark Pytlik, Jenkinson spoke of avoiding the ""music for musicians"" tag. A limited-edition solo bass album recorded live at a Paris theater-- just one musician, one amp, and a six-string-- might appear pretty musician-friendly, leaning heavily toward virtuosic self-satisfaction. A large part of Jenkinson's fanbase isn't going to rush out to purchase uncut and unfiltered bass noodling, unless they were hoping for some intriguing digital manipulation or that the <i>Loveless</i>-esque cover was meant as a strong visual clue. But don't start with the simplistic slap bass/""Seinfeld""<i> </i>theme jokes without considering what these tracks say about Jenkinson's process and procedure. There's a reason the audience gets enthusiastic during this 12-song set. Jenkinson is technically one hell of a bass player. Perhaps by playing it straight, he's playing with people's definitions of what does and doesn't constitute musical skill in a digital world or merely showing off his own ridiculous abilities. For an artist known for restlessness and provocations, this may be a ""mature"" way to fuck with expectations.</p></div>"|13363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13363-solo-electric-bass-1/|5.6|Patrick Sisson

This was the Folklore Center, recently relocated from MacDougal Street to Sixth Avenue, as if physically representing the gradual dispersal of the Greenwich Village folk scene. In 1967, Buckley was not a household name (nor would he ever be); he had released a mannered debut on Asylum the year before, and had a follow-up scheduled for a few months later. At that point, he was a young artist still developing his sound and style, still honing his lyrical and vocal gifts.</p>
<p>Although he had spent a few years in New York City before returning to Los Angeles, Buckley was closely associated with the West Coast scene, which was the reason Young booked him: ""I'm presenting concerts again so I can hear what a West Coast singer sounds like in person,"" writes Young in the liner notes to the new <i>Live at the Folklore Center, NYC – March 6, 1967</i>. Buckley must have been a novelty on the monthlong Folklore Center Continuing Folk Festival, the odd man out among New York natives Jack Elliott, Art Rosenbaum, and Spider John Koerner. But he was no more a Laurel Canyon strummer than he was a Village folkie and in fact adopted the brittle composure of the British folk at its stiffest on his debut.</p>
<p>There are traces of that formality on <i>Live at the Folklore Center</i>, but it is usually obscured by the influence of Bob Dylan, Fred Neil, and other East Coast singers, which is more obvious on this record than on any of his studio LPs. These are stark recordings of skeletal songs, featuring just Buckley's bell-like voice and emphatic, often percussive guitar playing. The sound quality is good, which is unexpected considering the performance was recorded through one mic on a machine used for taping field recordings. On opener ""Song for Jainie"", ""Wings"", and especially ""Aren't You the Girl"", Buckley conveys the conflicts and romantic recriminations as strongly and surely by himself as he did with a full band and string section on his debut, and ""No Man Can Find the War"" flourishes in this context, the strident strumming and descending melody on the chorus sounding like damning judgments.</p>
<p><i>Live at the Folklore Center</i> is a document of the artist pulling away not just from the New York scene or the West Coast scene, but from every scene. With each record, Buckley put an increasingly distinctive stamp on his songs, saturating them in jazz, raga, psychedelia, rock, and even schmaltz (ever heard his cover of Tom Waits' ""Martha""?). ""Phantasmagoria in Two"" and ""Carnival Song"" point in that direction, even if they feel a bit unformed at this point. On the other hand, his relatively conservative reading of Fred Neil's ""Dolphins"" sounds much less affected than the version that would appear on 1973's <i>Sefronia</i>.</p>
<p>What makes this recording more than a milemarker in an unpredictable and truncated career is the tracklist itself: Of the 16 songs Buckley played that night, six have never been officially released in any format, live or otherwise, until now. That the show ends with four such discoveries gives a sense forty years later of the artist embarking into the unknown, starting with the juxtaposition of his delicate vocal melody against his spidery, almost sinister guitar playing on ""Cripples Cry"". ""If the Rain Comes"" never pours, but ""Country Boy"" is a strong stab at country folk, and Buckley sounds like three or four different singers trading off vocals on ""I Can't Leave You Loving Me"". It's a climactic performance that shows both what Buckley had been and what he would become.</p></div>"|13304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13304-live-at-the-folklore-center-nyc-march-6th-1967/|7.4|Stephen M.

I've been expecting a lot from Throw Me the Statue after <i>Moonbeams</i>, their springy, surprisingly durable 2007 debut, and now I hope I haven't just been waiting for a star to fall. ""Lolita"" and ""About to Walk"" were killer indie pop singles, and ""Your Girlfriend's Car"" and the title track and a few others held up pretty damn well. I didn't get what I was looking for in this year's <i>Purpleface</i> EP, a bland collection of warmed-over slow burners and leftovers, and I'm sorry to say I can't find it here in <i>Creaturesque</i>, their sophomore set. It's a record that still finds the band struggling to shake a few influences while picking up a few familiar moves from others. Some apparently come shackled to perennial indie pop producer Phil Ek, who does little here to flatter the band's sound, but the band's biggest problem is their own; one of confidence.</p>
<p>In all the best senses of the phrase, Throw Me the Statue are an easy-listening band; they play mostly mid-tempo, guitar-led pop rock, peppered with inventive but never perplexing turns and flourishes. Scott Reitherman's honeyed lead vocals are occasionally a bit meek, but for a band who called their first album <i>Moonbeams</i>, that's usually fine. The trouble is, when the song's not there or Reitherman doesn't feel up to it, you get a little closer to the lite-rock connotation of easy listening: the kind of thing you don't have to turn down if your phone rings or some fool steps to your desk. Unobtrusive, they call this. And a lot of <i>Creaturesque</i> is kind of unobtrusive.</p>
<p>There's not a song among <i>Creaturesque</i>'s dozen to match the best from <i>Moonbeams</i>, and as with its predecessor's lesser numbers, <i>Creaturesque</i> can sometimes float by in a haze of Reitherman's lovely but polite vocals and hushed strumming with not enough melody to go around. It starts out strong, with the bouncy builder ""Waving at the Shore"", but once there moves into ""Pistols"", which takes cues for its floppy melody from several other TMTS tunes (""That's How You Win"", ""Ship"") without offering up too much of its own.</p>
<p>Then there's ""Tag"", which finds the hand of Phil Ek sitting firmly on Reitherman's shoulder; the tune's like a more dour take on the Shins' ""Mine's Not a High Horse"", from the Ek-produced <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i>, right down to the hurricane strum and Reitherman's every-which-way vocal. Even ""Waving"" shows a bit of Shin, too, in its melismatic Mercerian climax. Friends of Phil Built to Spill rear their gnarly beards, too; there's a very Martschy guitar turnaround on closer ""The Outer Folds"", and highlight ""Hi-Fi Goon"" nevertheless lifts everything but the sizzle of Built to Spill's ""Center of the Universe"" almost outright. Though he's produced some of my favorite records, Ek's hardly my favorite producer; he'd muffle Van Morrison if he thought he could sneak another effing guitar into a mix, and he tends not to add much to band's pre-Ek sonic palette but a few new, occasionally too-bright tones. And he certainly doesn't do as much for Throw Me the Statue as Reitherman himself and co-producer/multi-instrumentalist Casey Foubert did on the luminous <i>Moonbeams</i>; Reitherman, mild on the mic as it is, often gets squashed here, and the album feels pasty and sags a bit under the adornment.</p>
<p>They do get a few more than right on <i>Creaturesque</i>, ""Dizzy From the Fall"" especially; light and airy in tone, gossamer in its intersecting melodies, it doesn't quite have the hooks the <i>Moonbeams</i> highlights did, but bet you'll be clapping right along by the time the horns kick in anyhow. ""Dizzy"" kicks off a nice little mid-LP run that goes through ""Cannibal Rays"" and the aforementioned audiophile-baiting lazer beamer ""Hi-Fi Goon"". The stripped-down, almost tossed-off sounding ""Baby, You're Bored"" is a nice break from all the slightly overdone stuff that precedes it, and though the dull ""Shade for a Shadow"" is no great shakes, closer ""The Outer Folds"" has a mildly anthemic chorus melody that brings things down smoothly.</p>
<p>Some of <i>Creaturesque</i>'s failure to connect springs from Reitherman's lyrics, which ache for poetry but often come off as a series of clipped phrases, like they're a little afraid to come out and say just what they mean. His more than occasional inscrutability's a bad match with Ek's windpipe crosshairs, and even when he's saying some things they often fade into the frequently mushy mix. As a lyricist, Reitherman's too abstract to be affecting, and it's hard to imagine anyone loving these songs when-- through the casual lyrics, Reitherman's frequently disconnected voice, or the cloudy production-- they hold you at arm's length. Similarly, the arrangements are occasionally familiar and rarely all that interesting: I much prefer the warm, clear vibraphone of ""Lolita"" and harpsichord of ""Your Girlfriend's Car"" to the mushy, nearly all guitar-or-synth-or-both-led stuff here. But it's the song structures that have suffered the most; the bright, bouncy first half and the more plaintive, searching second half of <i>Moonbeams</i> had a ton of nice turnarounds and little moments of pleasure-center pounding, but the songs here don't hop around enough, and when they do, it's often someplace soft and safe. <i>Creaturesque</i> is an easy enough listen with a few moments that stand at attention, but even the best bits can't compare to <i>Moonbeams</i>', and the lesser stuff's far lesser indeed.</p></div>"|13353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13353-creaturesque/|6.1|Paul Thompson

With songs named after the Pop Group, Sonic Youth, and This Heat, and cuts that careened from freak-out to free jazz, <i>Neji/Tori</i> was an explicit homage to the band's points of origin. This five-song EP, <i>Destination Tokyo</i>, is about where those influences may take them. Detailed and more cleanly recorded, it's as if the trio are demanding listeners move past the confrontations and comforts of post-punk talking points and pay more attention the songs. Not coincidentally, there's more here to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Nisennenmondai's hammer blows have been replaced with pin pricks, and each song is more lithe than lumbering. Opening track ""Souzousuru Neji"" sets the tone for the record: Krautrock's industrialized repetition, swatches of melody played against flutters of strangled feedback. Drummer Sayaka Himeno's hi-hat is one of the only variable elements here, loosening and tightening to suggest an imminent <i>Neji/Tori</i>-style eruption. Of course that never happens, no matter how many <i>French Connection</i>-style chase scenes <i>Destination Tokyo</i> evokes.</p>
<p>Nisennenmondai maintain grooves until they reach a sort of anxious frenzy, then move to the next buildup. For all the repetitious melodies and rhythms that form the core of the record, they don't sacrifice subtlety or surprise. They drop a barely audible bass hook into the tail end of the joyously frantic ""Disco"", which, whether you hear it the first time around or not, throws the perfectly balanced piece just slightly off kilter. ""Mirrorball"" is the record's greatest departure, a densely woven braid of guitar squeals and taps that seems to gain mass with every measure. Maybe not all the outside references are gone: ""Mirrorball"" especially seems to reference Battles' minimalist, churning grooves, or even Terry Riley's ""A Rainbow in Curved Air"". They even preview ""Mirrorball"" with a sped-up a cappella version of the song (""Miraabouru""), full of rhythm-keeping stomps and giggles. Part of me hopes this is how they always demo their tracks. Since <i>Destination Toyko</i> is the result of a single take in the studio, that may be close to the truth. But Nisennenmondai never break their songs up with the same off-kilter melodies or squeaky vocal hooks, even if that's how the songs start out. It shows an amazing amount of patience and faith in their listeners.</p>
<p>Last album around I thought their cloudier, dirty tracks played better than their cleaner ones. I was still more impressed with the physicality of their songs, their musicianship, rather than the songs themselves (the Marnie Stern syndrome, I think). While they're still nimble musicians, <i>Destination Toyko</i> paints the trio as equally exciting songwriters.</p></div>"|13367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13367-destination-tokyo/|7.3|Jessica Suarez

It's a line you could affix to the front of just about any of Bejar's glam-folk tunes; he does, after all, tend to sing like he's trying to blow the last fleck of Chianti from his bottom lip. But here it is, leading off what's now Destroyer's longest track (by several minutes) in a catalog peppered with epics. The rumors were indeed true, as ""Bay of Pigs"" is in fact an ""ambient disco"" number, a couple of genres that even for the ever-eclectic Bejar seems oddly foreign on paper. I mean, Destroyer goes disco? The guy must've been under the goddamned table when he came up with that one.</p>
<p>This sprawl, paired with that succinct, near-summation of a first line-- oh yeah, and the dozen-minute screed that follows-- makes ""Bay of Pigs"", if not the single best Destroyer song, certainly the ultimate. It's an exceptional work, a surrealistic epic rich in novelistic tone and texture and sometimes shockingly vivid in its imagery. But it's also a 13-and-half-minute long Destroyer song in a spacey, eventually lite-disco style, and it's rife with all the quirk and self-reference of your favorite Bejar song, and then some. An entry point for curious New Pornographers fans this ain't.</p>
<p>The narrative is as troubled and prone to time-lapse and footnotes as you'd expect from Bejar's longest-ever tome; the tune is ostensibly about the botched 1961 Cuban invasion, but for an aside or 12 our narrator cops to being 20 years old in 1992, throwing up in an English garden, his antler-wearing conquest all the while lost in the desert. And, hey, maybe there's Christine, stowing away from <i>Destroyer's Rubies</i>' ""Painter in Your Pocket"", to whom Bejar refers as the rage-inducing object of his affections. Getting one's head around a tale this sinewy and sprawling is no easy task, and while Bejar's done exceptionally well in widescreen, the blowhard majesty of his compositions can wear one down after the third rave-up. But ""Bay of Pigs"" feels about half as long as the actually half-as-long ""Shooting Rockets"" from last year's fine <i>Trouble in Dreams</i>, and, weirdly enough, it's the disco that keeps you from flagging out around minute nine.</p>
<p>That said, don't go looking for your minimal dubstep Balearic whaddyacallit here; ""Bay of Pigs"" sounds like a synth rock band playing disco, and more specifically, like Destroyer playing disco, having never met a big build they didn't like. As such, the track burbles to a slow start, synths twinkling around Bejar as he explains away the booze on his breath. It's essentially one synth wash after another for a spell, swarming around Bejar's words before settling into a stuttery New Ordery synth pattern, a wet slap of a beat, and a little Spanish guitar. You'd look awfully funny trying to dance to the largely low-end-deficient first half or so, but ""Pigs"" gets a pretty good groove going about halfway through, pulling in all the elements from before and marrying them with a startlingly apt dancefloor refrain: ""Free and easy/ Gentle gentle/ The wind through the trees makes you mental/ For me"". The track stays out of Bejar's way when need be, helps carry over some of the wordier verses on the back of a thumpa or two, gets real good around the chorus, and then backs out slowly; it hangs onto the song like a rumpled sportcoat, the kind Bejar himself favors.</p>
<p>Talk about your self-reference; on the flip of ""Pigs"" is ""Ravers"", a stripped-down, slowed-up take on <i>Trouble in Dreams</i>' ""Rivers"". It took me a minute, honestly; ""Rivers"" was a fairly peppy tune about ""a standoff with the fucking horizon,"" more notable for its easygoing chorus melody than its words, but ""Ravers"" finds Bejar sounding pickled and determined as he moans those very same lyrics over an even spacier synth wash than ""Pigs"". To hear Bejar, who sounds almost like he's being propped up to get through this one, wail this one out into the ether is practically to hear a completely different tune, and he imbues the song's central lines with a lot more feeling and pathos than the livelier LP version. Bejar's long been a songwriter of the highest order-- and ""Pigs"", butt-minded sonics and all, is one of his finest-- but his powers of performance and interpretation have nearly caught up in the last few years. <i>Bay of Pigs</i> draws a clear line under that part of the Destroyer equation, as both songs here owe their successes to execution just as much as his early work got by on intent. I'd assume <i>Bay of Pigs</i>' disco diversion to be just that in the long run, but after the relatively wagon-gathering summary of <i>Trouble in Dreams</i>, this certainly feels like a break and, perhaps, the first blush of something new. Cheers to that.</p></div>"|13351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13351-bay-of-pigs-ep/|8.0|Paul Thompson

Though Sub Pop, of course, first built its empire two decades ago on caustic, post-hardcore rock, the few signees to mine that tradition since the mid-1990s-- from godheadSilo to Murder City Devils to the Catheters-- tended to have tokenistic standing on an increasingly diversified and commercially viable roster. Pissed Jeans thus appeared to be the latest addition to this lunatic fringe: one that provided a spiritual link to the imprint's storied past, but-- given the limited crossover potential for caterwauling, guttural noise-core-- hardly a foundation for their future.</p>
<p>But two years later, our appetite for absurdist punk-rock seems to be on an uptick. The Jesus Lizard and Butthole Surfers are hitting the reunion-tour circuit, playing venues larger than the ones they filled in their heydays; Fucked Up have scored Fox News-pundit gigs and a nomination for Canada's Polaris Music Prize. Pissed Jeans, meanwhile, have answered this pigfuck-apoolaza with an album that could potentially elevate the band to Sub Pop franchise players. If <i>Hope for Men</i> was distinguished by the canyon-wide chasm between the band's ugly aggression and frontman Matt Korvette's seemingly frivolous lyrical concerns (the potential for a Whole Foods sponsorship remains sadly unrealized), <i>King of Jeans</i> successfully consolidates these two strengths, harnessing the earlier record's sometimes directionless fire-extinguisher splatter into shake-appealing rock action, and cohering Korvette's ramblings into a more complete picture of wage-slave misanthropy and alpha-male inadequacy.</p>
<p>On paper, that latter part might read like the makings of a mid-life crisis record (à la the Wrens' <i>Meadowlands</i>), but the difference is Korvette wears his failure like a badge of honor. And where <i>Hope for Men</i>'s carpet-bomb onslaught sometimes obscured the relatable quality of Korvette's observations, on <i>King of Jeans</i>, they're organized into shout-back slogans cathartic enough to keep enraged 9-to-5ers from going postal: on opener ""False Jesii Part 2"", Korvette answers a litany of social pressures-- from going to the gym to wearing a ""tight black shirt""-- with a boisterous holler of ""I don't bother!"" before celebrating his slothfulness with a playground-taunt chorus of ""nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah,"" all to the steady beat of a tambourine, no less.</p>
<p>No one's going to confuse this with pop music, of course, but Pissed Jeans have certainly become more economical and precise in their attack-- gone are <i>Hope for Men</i>'s extended exercises in textural noise terror (""People Person"") and piano-blues concrète (""Scrapbooking""). In its place are two-minute Germs infections (""Human Upskirt""), Buttholes blurts (""Pleasure Race""), and crazed Nick Cave cattle calls (""Half Idiot""-- a soulmate to ""Zoo-Music Girl""). And in ""Request for Masseuse"", we hear the closest Pissed Jeans will probably ever get to a slow-jam: over guitarist Bradley Fry and bassist Randy Huth's oozing Iommi/Butler riff, Korvette lists off a series of instructions for his personal-ad pleasure-giver; when drummer Sean McGuinness kicks into the lurching groove 90 seconds in, Korvette lets out the creepiest sigh ever, graphically confirming the ending was a happy one.</p>
<p>But if ""Request for Masseuse"" represents a rare expression of joy for Korvette, <i>King of Jeans</i>' centerpiece track, ""Spent"", underscores how fleeting such moments really are. At seven minutes, the song is about three times as long as the average track here, but rather than being the most elaborate piece, it's the most despairingly regressive. Where <i>King of Jeans</i>' more compact tracks provide us the opportunity to scream or laugh along with Korvette's complaints, ""Spent"" is a 16-rpm Melvins-grade sludge feast that slows down the self-loathing commentary to ensure we feel every second of his agony; after counting off the ways his life sucks (""I went and got my car back/ There's a new noise this time""), he finally loses it when he realizes that even a ""cold glass of water... [doesn't] satisfy."" Recent history tells us that angry, confrontational music tends to flourish during Republican administrations, but <i>King of Jeans</i> illuminates the problems that plague the working man-- receding hairlines, the inability to relate to girls, the transactional nature of romance, the impossibility of proper cuticle maintenance-- regardless of who's running the country or how the economy is doing. The bumper sticker may say ""Yes we can,"" but the guy driving the leased Hyundai on which it's affixed is still left there staring at himself in the rearview mirror, thinking, ""No, dude, I really can't.""</p></div>"|13360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13360-king-of-jeans/|8.3|Stuart Berman

He's released one or two albums each year since 1998 under his Six Organs of Admittance banner, plus a bunch of EPs, one-offs, and 7""s, and because that didn't keep him busy enough, he's also worked with Comets on Fire, Badgerlore, and Current 93. It could be argued that he's done more than anyone to establish, develop, and fuel this whole modern freak-folk thing, even if his profile has never risen as high as some of his peers'.</p>
<p><i>Luminous Night</i> continues Chasny's association with Chicago's estimable Drag City label, and it's something of a summary record, demonstrating most of the range he's shown over the years, from pretty acoustic guitar ramblings to ambient noodling, droning psychedelic horrors, acid folk tunes, and rumbling noise. It's heaviest on the middle three and has an overall dirge-like quality that wears a bit thin at times. The record opens with a fake-out of gorgeous acoustic plucking on ""Actaeon's Fall (Against the Hounds)"", a sound that harks back to <i>School of the Flower</i>. This is joined by jazzy flute and an even prettier surfed-out guitar before everything stops for a breath and comes back in on a decidedly more medieval note, the flute joining a viola on a positively ancient-sounding melody that occasionally lapses back into surf-jazz for a couple seconds.</p>
<p>Taken in the context of the whole album, ""Actaeon's Fall"" plays something like a palate cleanser for the extended exercise in existential dread that follows. Chasny's oddly deadpan, almost British-accented voice makes a good instrument for brooding, and he almost makes a point of separating his brand of acid folk from his hippie forebears by confronting his personal failings head-on, declaring, ""I'm a vengeful man,"" on ""Anesthesia"" as harshly droning guitars crowd in around him. He wraps himself in thoughts of death on ""Ursa Minor"", singing, ""Love can't keep death at bay/ Good people dying everywhere/ When shadow's your doctor the price you pay/ Is asking if god is even there.""</p>
<p>Chasny is careful to cut through the pallor of the densest tracks with small splashes of color, like the tabla that drives ""Bar-Nasha"" or the piano that wafts through the electronic haze of ""Cover Your Wounds With the Sky"". Eyvind Kang leads ""River of Heaven"" with a haunting viola solo played in a style that sounds half European Renaissance and half Syrian. Genuinely haunting moments like that forgive some of the album's more egregious indulgences in drifting noise and intentional obfuscation (see the brown guitar squall in the middle of ""Enemies Before the Light""). But really, half the fun of Six Organs is hearing Chasny get away with being over-the-top on the strength of his sheer talent. <i>Luminous Night</i> doesn't challenge <i>School of the Flower</i> or <i>The Sun Awakens </i>for Six Organs' best albums, but it is a solid addition to a big catalog that gets more interesting all the time.</p></div>"|13352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13352-luminous-night/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Admittedly, many more folks have seen and heard Benson in the Raconteurs than have encountered him as a solo artist, but (literally) standing in the shadow of Jack White, even when you share vocal and songwriting duties, imposes a different sort of shroud than the fog of anonymity.</p>
<p>In many ways, then, Benson's fourth solo album, <i>My Old, Familiar Friend</i>, offers a third start to a stuttering career hindered by label woes, radio indifference, and the kinds of hurdles generally not faced by, say, Jack White. With the Raconteurs having laid the groundwork, Benson finally gets his shot in the spotlight. But to say he's seized the opportunity would imply Benson's gifts were not apparent from the start.</p>
<p>However, one big difference is that this time out people actually know who Benson is, and, perhaps taking that into consideration, Benson's shelled out for top-notch production from Gil Norton that greatly benefits his otherwise mostly <i>pro forma</i> power-pop. It's a smart move, since unlike so many in that long line of similarly minded peers, Benson doesn't skimp on the power. Yes, the usual AM radio suspects are floating in the mix-- Cheap Trick, the Raspberries, Todd Rundgren, Badfinger, even Wings-- as well as the acts those bands borrowed from, but Benson emphasizes the raw power of his riffs instead of polishing them into a smooth sheen. It's not as DIY charming as his earlier works, but it's pretty darned effective.</p>
<p>For example, piano and (fake) strings aside, ""Poised and Ready"" is pure guitar rush and snarl, supporting by pounding drums and throbbing bass. ""A Whole Lot Better"", too, rather than going for pat uplift on the chorus, instead piles the intensity on even heavier, all without losing sight of the massive hooks driving the song. The ""la la"" singalong ""Don't Want to Talk"", the squiggly synth-adorned kiss-off anthem ""Borrow"", the mock-Motown meets ELO of ""Garbage Day"", and the proto new wave-channeling ""Feel Like Taking You Home"" all wield their relentless infectiousness with relish.</p>
<p>Yet <i>My Old, Familiar Friend</i> isn't some document of cathartic rage (predictable undercurrent of romantic woes aside). Rather, this is pure, unbridled joy in recorded form. ""I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day,"" sings Benson in ""A Whole Lot Better"". ""I feel a whole lot better when you come around."" He might as well be describing the instant listener/song relationships fueled and formed by a lifetime of restless radio station surfing, favorite songs coming and going, many brightening up those bad days and making those long car trips go by that much faster. Back in the 1970s, Benson would have surely been held in the same esteem as many of those aforementioned AM titans. Here in 2009, he's merely the kind of best-kept secret you want to share with anyone who will listen.</p></div>"|13362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13362-my-old-familiar-friend/|7.0|Joshua Klein

Culturally, of course, it was a beautiful  thing-- half a million kids found each other and everything was groovy.  The audience was a generation with high ideals, crazy dreams, unreliable  drugs, and an inexplicable fondness for Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and  it finally had something to pull it together that didn't involve all  that many things being set on fire. The port-a-potties were overflowing  by Friday night, and the flower people left tons of garbage rotting  all over Max Yasgur's farm, but it's generally remembered as a positive  social experience by people who claim they were there.</p>
<p>The music, on the other hand,  didn't entirely live up to the event's rep, and there's been a certain  diminishing-returns effect from the recordings that have been released.  The first Woodstock album was a 1970 triple-album that cherry-picked  the festival's musical highlights-- 18 acts, give or take, most  of them limited to a track apiece. (Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, with  and without Young, got three.) Then there was a double LP a year later,  with some second-tier performances and three more CSNY songs. The 25th  anniversary 4xCD box set had all the music from those records, plus  some other stuff, minus the iconic between-song announcements (""the  brown acid that is circulating around us is not, specifically, too good"").</p>
<p>Now we've got this <i>six</i>-disc  monster, with a bit under half of the music that was played the weekend  of August 15, 1969, plus a healthy sampling of stage patter. (The unabridged  version will, one assumes, come out on subcutaneous nanotech in the  year 2024, by which time most of the festival's attendees will be well  into their seventies.) It's newly mixed from the original, unsweetened  master tapes, with miraculous clarity, so ha ha on you, Neil Young,  Ravi Shankar and Mountain-- no taking a mulligan on performances you  were unhappy with for <i>this</i> edition! And it's got at least a song  or two from almost every act that played the festival. The missing ones  are the negligible Keef Hartley Band, Ten Years After-- who were actually  on the original triple-LP-- and the Band, who were apparently bummed  out that everyone just wanted Bob Dylan to show up on stage with them.  (They reportedly played his ""I Shall Be Released"", as did  Joan Baez and Joe Cocker, although none of those versions show up here.)</p>
<p>There are a handful of deserving  excavations on the box. Country Joe &amp; the Fish get to demonstrate  that there's more to their groove-garage than the two minutes of ""Rock  &amp; Soul Music"" that made the movie soundtrack (although maybe  not the half an hour more's worth they get here), and it's nice to hear  Bert Sommer's elegant, pastoral meditations and the Incredible String  Band's people-of-the-forest folk. There are also some less-than deserving  exhumations, like Sweetwater, who get a pair of warbly numbers with  flute solos that are not, specifically, too good, and Quill, Bostonian  Zappaphiles who went on first on Saturday and promptly sank back into  obscurity. Jimi Hendrix's closing set was preceded by Sha Na Na, whose  squeaky-clean 50s nostalgia might have seemed like it provided some  kind of connection to rock's roots; that's probably the kindest possible  spin on it. The low point of <i>Back to Yasgur's Farm</i> is its third  disc: Canned Heat jammin' (with an apostrophe) on a boogie that seems  much longer than its actual half-hour, the Grateful Dead's dud of a  ""Dark Star"", and Creedence Clearwater Revival brusquely replicating  their studio recordings' ragged intonation.</p>
<p>Still, some bands managed to  pull off ace performances, even under Woodstock's ghastly conditions.  The Who were apparently miserable, tripping on acid they hadn't realized  they were ingesting in the backstage refreshments, and unable to hear  themselves in the monitors when they finally got to go on at 4 a.m. Somehow, that translated into a blistering, furious rendition  of ""Tommy"", of which 18 minutes appear here, including the  legendary onstage confrontation between Abbie Hoffman (who grabs the  mike and starts whining about John Sinclair) and Pete Townshend (who  growls ""Fuck off my fucking stage!"" and whacks him with his  guitar. Go Pete!).</p>
<p>There are other moments of  inspiration-- maybe about a CD's worth, all told. Some of them surfaced  on the original triple-LP: Joe Cocker's wild-eyed swan dive into ""With  a Little Help From My Friends"", Richie Havens' high-friction acoustic  ramble ""Freedom"", and especially Sly and the Family Stone's  peak-after-peak-after-peak ""I Want to Take You Higher"". Jefferson  Airplane's ""Volunteers"" roars, and so does their previously  unreleased cover of Fred Neil's ""The Other Side of This Life"";  hearing Melanie transformed from an unknown to a minor star over the  course of a few songs is pretty adorable. And yes, Jimi Hendrix's gloriously  audacious ""Star-Spangled Banner"" deserves its place of pride.  By that point, most of the hippie masses were straggling home, but whoever  was left on that muddy field on that Monday morning was very lucky.  As the old joke goes, though, if they can remember it, they weren't  really there.</p></div>"|13302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13302-woodstock-40-years-on-back-to-yasgurs-farm/|5.2|Douglas Wolk

But a little subterfuge can still go a long way. On his hit single, 22-year-old singer/rapper Drake insists, ""This one's for you,"" then cops some ""gray sweatpants, no makeup"" sweet talk en route to envisioning himself ""all up in your slot."" He recently admitted to MTV that ""it's not the most heartfelt song."" Where Drake talks dirty and sounds Auto-Tune clean, the Smith Westerns take the opposite approach. Like the Beatles, though, these four Chicago teenagers don't want to hold your hand-- they want to do more.</p>
<p>Don't let the Fab Four mention throw you: From this young Windy City group, retro-rock doesn't feel like a history class. Rummaging through 1970s glam, Phil Spector teen-pop, and <i>Nuggets</i> garage-punk with the youthful abandon of kids finding new toys in the attic, the Smith Westerns' self-titled debut exudes an earnestness almost as pure as its recording levels are deafening. Their simple, sweet choruses about boys and girls in love could spike the punch at a 1970s TV show (OK, ""Freaks &amp; Geeks""/""That '70s Show"") school dance. Parent chaperones would be none the wiser.</p>
<p>When singing guitarist Cullen Omori, his bassist brother Cameron, second guitarist Max Kakacek, and a drummer known to Google only as Hal have the tunes to make themselves heard over their vintage aesthetic, <i>The Smith Westerns</i>' teenage kicks are hard to beat. Take string-swept glam ballad ""Be My Girl"", which softly punctuates one of the year's most wrenchingly innocent hooks with somewhat pervier pick-up lines. There's less lyrical subtext, but no less raunchy production, on the glam-rock boogie of ""Girl in Love"", a come-on cursorily addressing the fleetingness of youth. It's only fitting that in a year-old YouTube video featuring scratchy sockhop swooner ""Tonight"", the Smith Westerns both look and sound like the Black Lips' good-bad not-evil twins.</p>
<p>These guys are sort of literally true to their school-- garage-rocker Miss Alex White is a fellow Northside College Prep magnet-school alum-- and their time on the road with the likes of Jay Reatard and Nobunny is evident on fine 60s-style frat-rocker ""Gimme Some Time"". With fuzzed-out xylophone, frenetic opener ""Dreams"" suggests the group's most recent tour with Girls and Los Campesinos! might serve them better for a follow-up. ""Diamond Boys"" almost earns its piano on the strength of its adolescent grandiosity, but ""We Stay Out"" lets lo-fi become the end rather than the means, with a guitar line that sounds like a bee buzzing underwater.</p>
<p>Japandroids, another loud punkish group concerned with youth and girls, ask a cathartic question on <i>Post-Nothing</i>'s ""The Boys Are Leaving Town"".  DFA signees Free Energy channel Thin Lizzy's ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" on their recent ""Dream City"" single. The Smith Westerns turn to lighthearted psych-folk for their own declaration: ""Boys Are Fine"". Then, on blithely woo-oohing fuzz-popper ""The Glam Goddess"", they actually go and say it: ""I wanna hold your hand."" Boys will be boys.</p></div>"|13358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13358-smith-westerns/|7.7|Marc Hogan

Sure, it's risky, but at a time when everything else is fair game for interpretation and reconfiguration-- dancehall, dub, deep house, Balearic-- why not go for broke and hang your hat on hits like Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's ""Good Vibrations"" or CeCe Peniston's ""Finally""? This music was all good times and no pretense, and it managed to spark some much-needed mainstream discussion about electronic music here in the U.S., however vapid and disingenuous those compilations may have seemed. When this sort of spic-and-span, popwise techno music hit, Denver's Pictureplane, aka Travis Egedy, was in grade school-- an age when sonic consumption is passive. So it makes sense that his mostly solid full-length debut LP asks the question: Where were u in '92?</p>
<p><i>Dark Rift</i> manages to extol the virtues of those sugarcoated dance music templates while still working within the parameters of punk DIY. Most of the record feels like a well-curated basement party mixtape; it bounces around enough to keep things ripe, despite sticking to the same few Korg effects and raygun bloops on nearly every cut. Egedy clearly feels comfortable style-hopping, though you could likely tag a number of sub-genres within every song-- from the Afrobeat-heavy ""Time Teens"" to the dancehall designated ""5th Sun"", things are left largely uncluttered so an idea can fully flesh itself out before we move on to the next one. Jungle and garage inflections rear their heads at nearly every turn, but they're mostly cleansed of their gutter appeal and newly reupholstered in glitter and gold lamé. Throughout, Egedy finds a way to unearth these like-minded genres' deep roots in glam and disco, so don't let that deliberate layer of noise splashed over the mix fool you: Despite the Massive Attack-pruned atmospherics on cuts like ""Transparent Now (Thin Veil)"", Pictureplane's sound ultimately lives and dies by the smoke machine.</p>
<p><i>Dark Rift</i>'s two best moments-- ""Goth Star"" and ""Gang Signs""-- hint at another possible path. Both are a little languid and frayed and they seem very much in the now, a time when clipped vocals and delayed synth loops are allowed to nurture the groove instead of stifle it. Rather than working an endless disco suite or breakbeat, Egedy here manipulates samples with the best of them, revealing a keen ear for sound-melding that pushes past those nostalgia-inducing rave-ups into a more affecting realm.</p>
<p>Given the force of those moments, you might expect some of the cheeky early-90s referencing to sound weak in contrast, but two-steppers like ""New Mind"" and ""Dimensional Rip III"" still succeed on their own terms, happy to appeal to the disembodied-female-hook and laser-effect set. Indeed, the propulsive, strobe-streaked allegiance to the mainstream dance music of days gone by is ultimately the most admirable thing about <i>Dark Rift</i>. Pictureplane's music has its weaknesses-- the breathy vocal whine on every track is flatly injected and grating-- but there are enough lo-fi footnotes, grab-bag genre references, and sprightly hooks to draw in a variety of listeners.</p></div>"|13347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13347-dark-rift/|7.3|Zach Kelly

Aside from Vernon's sympathetic falsetto, his potpourri approach to lyrics, and the vocal take from his previously released Vocoder curio ""Woods"", Volcano Choir shares little with its more famous brethren. An impressionistic affair gilded by occasional crescendos, <i>Unmap</i> trades rock and folk linearity for guitar notes that refract, bend, and sustain; drums that prowl, circle, and march; and a panoply of unfamiliar sounds that ping, swirl, and float. On ""Still"", a full-band update of ""Woods"", all of those elements-- Vernon's voice, the band's luminous matrix of tones and drums-- coalesce into seven incredible minutes. The wintry chill of Vernon's solo take becomes a slow, icy burn here, the sting fastidiously increased by drums that spread patiently through the mix until, by climax, your chest feels like it is the kick drum.</p>
<p>The locomotive beneath ""Still"" is Jon Mueller, a fringe percussionist and improviser living in Milwaukee. He's long stood just at the edge of indie notoriety, formerly with Polyvinyl jazz benders Pele and now with Collections of Colonies of Bees, the often-brilliant quintet that's the other piece of the Volcano Choir chimera. Apart from those acts, Mueller has cultivated a sprawling discography of outsider collaborations with people like resonance expert Z'EV and environmental audio plunderer Jeph Jerman. With his bands, Mueller's drumming emphasizes power and precision. Those collaborations, though, often exploit texture, building rich sprawls of sound from unlikely tones.</p>
<p>On last year's <i>Metals</i> and this year's <i>Physical Changes</i>, Mueller's first and second eponymous albums for Table of the Elements' Radium imprint, the twain meet in long-form pieces that combine the explosiveness of his timekeeping and the expansiveness of his sound-making. <i>Metals</i>' two tracks wound wires of noise around heavy-metal marathons, blurring each bludgeon until they became one bulk sound. <i>Physical Changes</i> goes further, surrounding Mueller's drums with the varied dins of collaborators-- the guitar of Khanate's James Plotkin, the cello of Lightbox Orchestra leader Fred Lonberg-Holm, the synthesizer of Collections of Colonies of Bees bandmate Jim Schoenecker-- that threaten to rip whatever rhythm arises apart. Two hours of these escalating, dense pieces are split over five tracks on a DVD, CD, and LP. A gauntlet of focus and endurance, then, <i>Physical Changes</i> teases the divides between beats and bedlam, composition and improvisation, insanity and intensity. By set's end, it establishes Mueller as an audacious ringleader for new music.</p>
<p>The title of this collection and of the tracks therein-- ""Things Will Not Stay the Way They Are"" and ""Change Is the Only Evidence of Life"", to cite two-- serve as a sort of convenient credo for Mueller's music. Superficially, these five pieces can be quickly categorized as drones, in that they find a sonic space and pursue it doggedly. But as with many Table of the Elements artists, stopping there would be at the expense of the nuance and dynamics these tracks offer. As the titles hint, they're always shifting, even if slightly, letting sounds rise and fade, blend and break. ""Nothing Changes"", the first track of the set's CD and the real masterpiece, stretches a bell tone until it's long and thin. The track swells for 10 minutes as an arco cello sends shocks of dissonance through the music. Mueller rips into a drum roll that he releases about 25 minutes later, or as the track expires. But the sounds surrounding the drums shift constantly, changing the way Mueller's static beat fits into the frame. Sometimes, it's a background wash. Other times, it's at the front, lashing at open air.</p>
<p>Similarly, ""The Only Constant Thing is Change"" sounds like a rock band bursting from the inside of a cauldron in waves of chaos and silence. Electric tumult splits Mueller's rhythm at the side, and no sound sticks around too long. That's the point emphasized by ""Survival Is Not Mandatory"", an accompanying 36-minute collaboration with video artist David Dinnell. Dinnell blurs familiar images-- trees in the wind, a deer drinking in a brook, a still lake-- until they look like lunar landscapes. He shifts from one scene to the next, alternately overexposing and underexposing his film so that nothing dominates a frame too long. Mueller's sound achieves the same effect, bits and pieces slipping in and out of a composite roar so that, even after 30 minutes, the music seems still very nebulous.</p>
<p>It feels condescending to suggest that <i>Physical Changes</i> won't readily appeal to fans of Bon Iver or Volcano Choir. Strangely, it feels vaguely incorrect, too: Though Mueller's music is often chaotic and distorted (perhaps to the point of being indiscernible from one moment to the next), it is the product of singular vision and steadfast will. Its focus transcends mere sound, so-- for those who seek no apology in their music-- there's the potential for broader appeal. What's more, Mueller pulls a few collaborators and, to an extent, his audience into the tide of his own ideas. In this way, <i>Physical Changes</i> is not altogether unlike a James Blackshaw record, where friends help the young English guitarist lift his mesmerizing guitar takes into bigger, better songs.</p>
<p>But let's not downplay <i>Physical Changes</i>' visceral roar too much: It's an impolite, unflinching record, loudly making its case as one of the year's boldest statements.</p></div>"|13267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13267-physical-changes/|8.0|Grayson Currin

The duo continues to appear on almost any bill, in front of any crowd, in any town, and if you haven't seen their names on a local listings, you might know them from their collaborations with the men of the Mae Shi, remixing their ""Run to Your Grave"" for the <i>HLLYEA</i> EP. Though their kindred spirits are a little left of traditional notions of hip-hop, Kid Static still lays nimble, easygoing rhymes over the dense and busy production of Yea Big, who also plays the gawky, sweatband-and-gym-short adorned hypeman for Static on stage. Whether you're a fan of glitch-inspired sci-fi rap production or not, Yea Big's work here is a potent argument for continuing to work the niche: it's always chintzy and threatening, robotic and organic, teeth-gritting and head-bobbing all at once.</p>
<p>The tracks on <i>The Future's Looking Grim</i> were sent back and forth between the two principals, Postal Service-style, but you wouldn't know it from hearing it. The chemistry is still enough that Kid Static knows when to lead the track and when to let it pop, squelch, and thump on its own. There's a social message that occasionally creeps in from the sidelines (they carry ""two barrels of beats"" and are ""super-soakin with guns, not with skeetin"" in ""Middle America""), and yet Kid Static is becoming a strong enough MC that his flow alone is as compelling as the content. It's evident on the frenetic Nintendo beat of ""Stomp the Pedal"" that hides more thump and open space in its second return, while Kid Static's double-time flow and breathless inflection show his growth as a rapper. The same goes for when he slows down: ""The Nameless"" has him taking name-dropping to the most absurd heights possible while rhyming ""alphabet"" with ""Cox-Arquette."" It's a concept that might read as corny, but is exactly the kind of thing that can transform folded arms into smiles in an unfamiliar crowd.</p>
<p>Yea Big, meanwhile, is all over the place-- jumping into juke in the outro of the opening track, providing giddy post-Neptunes bounce underneath the chip-tastic ""Mega Man"" valentine ""Bots"", receding into harsh static in the closing moments of the darker ""Dollar Bill Hat"", and combining jazzy hi-hat tapping with distorted bass hits in ""Rock Bottom Rock"". The fact that Kid Static can even keep up, let alone find a way in to these tracks, is saying something. Sonically, the album veers between a more relaxed and confident reiteration of the busy-but-laid-back rap of their first record and tracks that build an icy tension in their glitchier moments. Goosebumps are raised as bicycle-spoke percussion floats through an otherwise silent moment before the refrain of ""Down to the River"", and paranoia lurks over the shoulder of the nightmare-inspired ""Long Night"". Even ""Middle America"", which could easily be a theme song for the group, sounds a little tense and beleaguered.</p>
<p>Though it's not completely fair to harp on a song that's more than a year old by now, ""Eatchyo Samwich"" is a good summation of Yea Big + Kid Static's strengths: they're usually at their best when they're smiling, and most potent when the track has just a little breathing room-- in this case, an unusually slinky beat that carries a ridiculous, occasionally uncomfortable extended riff on food-inspired braggadocio, with Static adopting a lantern-jaw tough-guy voice that rivals his regular tone. Yet even ""Samwich"" isn't quite the same without the pre-song anecdote Static delivers when they play it live. The icy pessimism of the record is compelling, but ""Samwich"" and ""The Nameless"" hint at how irrepressible and charming these guys are, and how they're comfortable in front of any audience. Above all else, the group is serious about being silly, and it's hard to get what they're about without seeing them dive into a crowd, scale a venue's walls, or turn their backs to the audience for some Supremes-worthy dance moves. Fortunately, <i>The Future's Looking Grim</i> comes a little closer to capturing that spirit.</p></div>"|13356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13356-the-futures-looking-grim/|7.2|Jason Crock

For a man whose recorded output outpaces most major manufacturers, a slapdash Robert Pollard LP of particularly dour output seems at times the rule rather than the exception, and even tacking on a little flourish to get things going means Pollard's at least thought this one through to the beginning. The same could hardly be said for this winter's turgid, tossed-off <i>The Crawling Distance</i>, a record as easy to shrug off as it probably was to lay down. From the get-go, <i>Elephant Jokes</i> sounds deliberate; a deliberate go at a punchy front-to-back rock record, one, but also an intentional return to a few of the moves that made those mid-to-late-90s Guided by Voices records (and, to a lesser extent, his fine recent work with the Boston Spaceships) such a ramshackle good time.</p>
<p><i>The Crawling Distance</i> spread 10 tracks over 36 minutes; <i>Elephant Jokes</i> crams 22 of 'em into just over three-quarters of an hour. Just by the numbers, that reduction is huge; since forever, all the best Pollard records have been the ones that get the most songs in, and <i>Elephant Jokes</i> never met an idea it couldn't swiftly abandon in 90 seconds. After a few years largely leaving the fretwork for just about anybody else, several of these songs started with Bob on guitar, with a few taking root with Pollard in an actual studio rather than mucking about at home. The pre-studio GBV records had a feeling of haphazard inception to them, like they were laid down just about anywhere the bottles could be cleared enough to set the recorder down, and in many cases they were. Bob's ""I'll sing, you play"" mode from the last few years has certainly stripped the music of this quality, and it's something <i>Elephant Jokes</i> tries to recreate.</p>
<p>Pollard also hasn't sounded as loosely with-it behind the mic on a record since maybe <i>Universal Truths and Cycles</i>. Helps that he's got some weird stuff to say, too; it can be damn near impossible to follow a Pollard free association through to its conclusion, so <i>Elephant Jokes</i> sports some of his better semi-sequiturs and asides in some time. You owe it to yourself to hear Uncle Bob in his best cornball voice asking, ""Don't you just like college?"" then prodding you about ""seven or eight years"" like he expects a loan repayment, and there's a good deal of playfulness here missing from the straightfaced <i>Crawling Distance</i>.</p>
<p>Not sure who's wagging which dog, but with this setup-- actually being around the folks he's recording with, playing a little, chopping it up song-wise, having lots to say, however strange-- Pollard shines. <i>Elephant Jokes</i> isn't just all the makings of a fine Bob Pollard record, it actually is one, carrying on its back a mostly clunker-free batch of tunes that, even when they stall out, always seem to stay on the move. ""Johnny Optimist"" and ""When a Man Walks Away"" are perfectly seasoned power-pop, with Pollard singing the hell out of either, ""Symbols and Heads"" shuffles its way up into similarly hooky but even rockier territory, ""Epic Heads"" has a strong sidelong strut to it, and ""Jimmy"" feels like a continuation of ""A Salty Salute"", and its neon guitar is nearly worthy of the honor. Album highlight ""Stiff Me"" bounces along on warm, wide-open chords, and Pollard's staccato vocal suits the up-and-down verse and stuttery chorus almost perfectly; it's about as fine a song as he's done since GBV ended, and it's got all the markings of a staple.</p>
<p>As ever, there's a few numbers that aren't worth skipping back to, and ""Perverted Eyelash"" and ""Blown Out Man"" trudge along at the awkward gate of the sludge rock I wish he'd save for the Circus Devils, and there's not all that much in the same league as ""Stiff Me"" and ""Johnny Optimist"". But the songs slip by so quickly, with a pretty damn high hit-to-miss ratio, it doesn't matter too much that so many of the hits happen to be doubles. <i>Elephant Jokes</i> just has a good feeling about it, as if Pollard really liked this batch, so that's why he deigned to play an instrument on it, maybe, and why he slips a little intro in and closes it out with the very final-sounding ""Architectural Nightmare Man"". It's still a little soft in spots, and not exactly jam-packed with Pollard classics, and for that I'm still partial to the pair of rangy, jangly Boston Spaceships LPs, both of which seem to favor new forms and exciting arrangements rather than the revisitation of a bunch of good old ideas. But, hey, a good idea's still not bad this far on, especially when the guy delivering it is really delivering. As it stands, he is; <i>The Crawling Distance</i> and the spotty Cosmos record with Richard Davies of the Moles notwithstanding, with this and <i>The Planets Are Blasted</i>, Pollard's having his best year on record since pulling the plug on GBV.</p></div>"|13293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13293-elephant-jokes/|7.1|Paul Thompson

And at some point on that Möbius strip, the routine transmissions of life-- TV chatter, street chatter, radio chatter-- morph into otherworldly assaults, mounting evidence of a conspiracy against human peace. Hippies called this ""turning on.""</p>
<p>But pop art proved that there were ways to embrace the noise without surrendering to it. Scanning the backside of culture for fleas, discovering American gods in the grain of public access shows, etc.-- ways that you could baptize, by fire, whatever grotesqueries the TV Fast Food Complex fed you as a kid. It's why twenty- and thirty-somethings are out making paintings influenced by bootleg Bart Simpson T-shirts or ""video art"" like ""Wonder Showzen"" (a deformed twin of ""Sesame Street"" by people who presumably have never met a child), or why Ariel Pink has an audience.</p>
<p>Eric Copeland-- one-third of New York's Black Dice-- is a lifeguard in this world. <i>Alien in a Garbage Dump</i>, a CD issue of two vinyl-only EPs, sounds like the soundtrack for Chuck E. Cheese's memorable 1993 ad ""Ultimate Pizza"", time stretched and desiccated by effects boxes. Or like what Panda Bear's <i>Person Pitch</i> might sound like if Panda Bear was replaced by the doll from <i>Child’s Play</i>. Like an alien in a garbage dump.</p>
<p>It's fun. I boogie to it. Grooves collide in what sound like accidents; ringtone-sized melodies are played and played and replayed and replayed and wrung out like roadkill. The songs bounce and reel. He never opens the window for air. Copeland exists in the world of noise and art music, but <i>Alien</i>'s blissful repetitions are closer akin to hip-hop or the tireless elation of steel drum bands. After all, ""breaks"" were basically just the DJ finding the brightest beam of sunlight in a song and looping it till drool trickled from the audience's mouths.</p>
<p>Apparently the searching, high-minded folks at British magazine <i>The</i> <i>Wire</i> have started calling music like this ""hypnagogic pop,"" a reference to the state between wakefulness and sleep. I don't buy it. Copeland-- and James Ferraro, and Nite Jewel, and all these coastal folks vomiting up crusty, 80s-inspired psychedelia-- are fully awake, just on some other side of reality. It's not hypnagogic-- it's stoned, daffy, and righteous. It's chewing up something familiar and making it weird again.

No shit: Even in a ""post-race"" world, street sells. Certain British journalists predictably pounced on lyrics about a period in Debelle's late teens idled among London's demimonde of crack mums and minor crooks, spinning a tiny bit of flash into blinding bling. Fact is, she was raised in a middle-class Jamaican neighborhood south of the Thames where she, uh, attended school and studied music and wrote poetry. Debelle doesn't so much map ""street"" as girl-next-door or Speech-from-the-block. Wherever she's from, anyway, some hip-hop fans will likely write her off because the usual American rap signifiers-- samples, seething synths, bombastic beats, and buckets of braggadocio-- play scant part in her artistic agenda.</p>
<p>But if Debelle can't win the authenticity game, so be it; The baby-faced, mature-minded 26-year old has debuted with a fine, fresh, serious (yet never dour) album that speaks for itself, thanks. Wayne Lotek (Roots Manuva, who makes an appearance) produces the 13-track set on a spacious, spontaneous, even improvisational-sounding jazz tip with understated string, key, woodwind, and brass arrangements. It's hard to imagine a more effacing intro to someone being billed as UK hip-hop's next big thing as ""Searching""'s tremulous guitar and brushed cymbals, which only slowly crack the door to a secret of skittish beats and Debelle's anxious ""2 a.m. in my hostel bed, my eyes them red, my belly ain't fed."" Elsewhere, Lotek deploys everything from Afrobeat guitar lines to trumpet solos to new-agey bell tones, providing texture without upstaging Debelle's low-resting-pulse cadence. He's not trying to upstage her, anyway. Knockout single ""The Key"" is cool for Debelle's relaxed, conversational delivery, but gets its heat from a clarinet's serpentine swish and the way all the instruments pile on her voice in the last minute like a hill of ants on a dropped donut.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, <i>Speech Therapy</i> isn't a producer's record, but an MC's. And the title's no feint: Speech lies supine on the couch for the full 50 minutes. Fortunately, whether she's sifting through the anguish she's caused her mother and the trouble she's having finishing her album, or realizing that good sex can make for bad boyfriends and that even sucky jobs serve some cosmic purpose, she generally cuts through the crap without pretending to have easy answers. If you think you've heard everything about absent, irresponsible fathers and the children who tear their own insides out loving them, Debelle, in ""Daddy's Little Girl"", is casual but ruthlessly right-on: ""Daddy, I think I love you 'cause I hate you so much that I must love you"".</p>
<p>Which isn't to say she doesn't sometimes copy captions from baby animal posters. Debelle credits tough American female MCs like Lil' Kim with artistic inspiration, but her outlook's far more pacifist and optimistic-- even erring on the side of naïvete. The same song (""Spinning"") that kills it with the couplet, ""This is for the tat on my wrist/ This is for the black of my fist,"" also whimpers ""One day all people will be all equal/ Until that day comes I'll just be singing my song"". To make sense of such inconsistencies, it helps to think of Debelle in relation to a less-violent Brithop tradition and to impossible-to-peg (and, yeah, inconsistent) contemporaries Lady Sovereign or Micachu. (The latter pops in on ""Better Days"" to don her Miss Ubiquity 2009 sash and execute an underwhelming smile-wave-turn move.)</p>
<p>Hip-hop could use a less rigid paradigm, less insularity, more girls on the mic. I suspect plenty of people with a greater investment in this genre would disagree and dismiss<i> Speech Therapy</i> as coffeehouse rap. Debelle anticipates that reaction, though, with the record's final lyric: ""I understand this is my speech therapy, this ain't rap."" But it could be.</p></div>"|13354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13354-speech-therapy/|7.5|Amy Granzin

Labels like Mule Electronic complicate the situation further, as we can't ascribe to them any scene or sound specific enough to rally behind (think Kompakt's Total series or the Skull Disco comps). Despite this, Mule Electronic, which trades chiefly in varying strands of minimal and techno, has served as a worthy home for some of this decade's most productive, creative electronic acts. <i>My Favorite Things, Vol. 2</i>, featuring exclusive and/or upcoming tracks from artists like Isolée, Minilogue, Move D, and DJ Koze, offers a chance to delve (slightly) deeper into the catalogs of some favored artists.</p>
<p><i>My Favorite Things, Vol. 2</i> celebrates Japan-based Mule's fifth anniversary, and it's as much a marketing opportunity as a party: In addition to the headlining acts mentioned above, <i>MFT2</i> offers peeks into comparative unknowns like (recent Mule signee) Foog, Ribn (a new project from Manuel Tur), and Strategy. There's no need to search for a unifying sound or theme on a comp like this, but the mood of <i>MFT2</i> is dreamy and expansive, though aggressive, tech-y pulses from Ribn (""Lum Lum"") and Strategy (""My Synthetic Guitar"") will snap any drooping eyelids.</p>
<p>The sound of the comp is almost perfectly summed by ""Jill"", an album-track preview from Dial co-owner Lawrence. A clacky, metronomic beat taps industriously under an alternating bass figure and slurred, ambient keyboards. Newcomer Foog's ""Kanazawa"" is one of the track's dancier beats, featuring a tunneling bass channel and way-off, smeared blasts of Rhodes, like deep house with any trace of disco orientation beaten out of it.</p>
<p>The big guns alternate between the rote (Isolée's funky but strangely wanting ""Albacares"") and the exciting: Move D's brilliantly named ""Happylock"" is twitchy and floor-oriented in ways that last year's (still excellent) <i>Songs From the Beehive</i> was not. The big winners are Minilogue, whose ""My Teenager Gang"" (now a 12"") offers 10 minutes of vinyl-heated, tropic jam. Beginning with a rollicking deep-house bleat, the track accumulates chattering rainforest sounds and youthful chants; ""My Teenager Gang"" surpasses nearly everything from the dance-oriented half of last year's <i>Animals</i>. Other highlights include Koss' ""Earth (Âme Remix)"", which provides loose, urban-wilds shuffle, and the still-underrated DJ Koze's ""First Snow"", which closes <i>MFT2</i> with a gorgeous, organ-tinted fadeout.</p>
<p><i>My Favorite Things, Vol. 2</i> isn't essential listening-- tech fans will likely accumulate this material more organically, and Mule still lacks a true crossover success-- but for anyone looking to take a second step into a favorite artist, or perhaps anyone lacking the time (or locale) to scour new-arrival 12""'s, <i>MFT2</i> is a mostly winning collection from a steady, commendable label.</p></div>"|13174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13174-my-favorite-things-vol-2/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

Guitar magazines would feature him on covers, and people would play his tunes with plastic toy guitars. But Hufnagel does not tease his hair enough for magazine coverage. Nor does he play trendy music. Instead, he has pursued idiosyncratic musical paths. Dysrhythmia, an instrumental trio, is his main band. With Dysrhythmia bassist Colin Marston, he does Byla, an avant-garde ambient project. He also records solo acoustic guitar records under his own name.</p>
<p>Hufnagel can play circles around more famous guitar ""shredders."" The conventional model of a guitar hero is a lanky fellow emitting streams of notes during the middles of songs. Such playing is usually linear, one note after another, and often depends on rhythm guitar underneath to keep the song going. Hufnagel has no such luxury, nor does he need it. As Dysrhythmia's sole guitarist, he renders obsolete terms like ""rhythm"" and ""lead guitar."" He plays high, he plays low, he plays everything in between. Hufnagel does not play notes so much as describe worlds. In this way, he recalls Al Di Meola, who uses his immense speed not towards left hand heroics, but towards percussive picking patterns. Hufnagel sketches outlines of chords, then fills them in with various tones and adds outside notes for color. The result evokes audible alien paintings.</p>
<p>Dysrhythmia's sound hasn't changed over time so much as come into focus. Their songs are instantly recognizable for their chewy tones, muscular dissonance, and roiling percussion. If 1990s noise rock had acquired shredder chops, it might sound like Dysrhythmia. The band has a few sonic cohorts, like Don Caballero and Keelhaul. But Dysrhythmia is more willing to soar above its odd-metered foundation. Hufnagel can unspool leads as elegantly as Joe Satriani or Steve Vai. However, he reins in this aspect on <i>Psychic Maps</i>. The record is Dysrhythmia's darkest and densest yet. ""Festival of Popular Delusions"" approaches thrash and death metal at times. The precise picking of ""Iron Cathedral"" suggests Megadeth in the 31st century. ""Reactionary"" is thrusting and elastic, like an angry Primus. ""Room of Vertigo"" lives up to its name, as Marston unleashes torrents of throbbing low end. ""Lifted by Skin"" is the exception to such relentlessness, with hummingbird picking forming webs of electric ambience.</p>
<p>Never the most accessible band, Dysrhythmia have become even more inscrutable on <i>Psychic Maps</i>. Its beefy tones and immense virtuosity are almost like armor. This yields a more difficult listen than the band's last few releases, which wielded more space and quiet. Now the band feels big and menacing. It's almost a prelude to Gorguts, the legendary Canadian death metal band that recently recruited Hufnagel and Marston. Perhaps these tunes are best suited for the live setting, where the band is formidable. It's arty, it's math-y, and one can definitely headbang to it.</p></div>"|13359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13359-psychic-maps/|7.0|Cosmo Lee

Those albums, created largely as solo endeavors, will not have prepared listeners  for <i>See Mystery Lights</i>. Now an official partnership between Bechtolt and Claire  L. Evans, who performed on several songs on 2007's <i>I Believe  In You, Your Magic Is Real</i>, YACHT finally feel like a full-fledged band with direction and vision, particularly given the added weight (or rather, levity) of Evans' influence.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>See Mystery Lights</i>--  from the bouncy, burbling you-can't-take-it-with-you screed ""The  Afterlife"" (which plays like a less spastic companion piece to the  Mae Shi's ""Run to Your Grave"") to the roller rink-ready vocoder  vocals of ""I'm In Love With a Ripper""-- represent YACHT at their  most poppy. It's a collection of stone jams that finds the band finally  as hellbent on experimenting and expanding  the boundaries of its sonic scope as it is on having fun. Built on electronic foundations-- laser effects, skittering computerized beats, and spacey  synth lines (or guitar riffs that have been tuned or distorted to sound  like synths)-- these new songs are giddy with creative freedom while remaining tethered in service of their melodies. The vocal melodies are bright and  buoyant, but delivered (by either band member, or in unison) in a chanted,  oftentimes detached monotone that plays up the repetitive lyrics'  mantra-like feel and adds a welcome undercurrent of slacker cool to  their otherwise sugary optimism.</p>
<p><i>See Mystery Lights</i> also marks  the first time that YACHT are recording for DFA. Normally a label-change  wouldn't be notable, as it is usually less an indicator of artistic  choices than it is of financial or business ones, but moving to a label  with such a distinctive aesthetic may be enough for many to reconsider their work. YACHT themselves created the track ""Summer Song"" as an homage to LCD Soundsystem, and LCD/DFA leader James Murphy liked it enough to release it on his label. It's no wonder that  Murphy was smitten; the track, which also appears on the full-length, echoes the deadpan vocal delivery and burbling 80s krautrock synths  of his own band, as well as cowbell-and-handclap percussion ripped  from the Rapture's ""House of Jealous Lovers"", one of DFA's biggest  singles. Even other tracks on the collection-- ones that weren't written  specifically in homage to Murphy-- can't help but sound influenced by him. Case  in point: ""We Have All We've Ever Wanted"", with its minimalist dance  beat, heavy bass, and Bechtolt's dry, talky delivery, recalls ""Losing My Edge"", albeit with a lighthearted, anthemic chorus.</p>
<p>Still, while YACHT clearly share influences  with Murphy's gang (Eno, Ferry, Neu!, ESG, etc.), their positive,  futuristic jams actually sound most closely related to Tom Tom Club.  Perhaps that's because, like Tom Tom Club's first self-titled album,  which was recorded in Barbados, <i>See Mystery Lights</i> was recorded  in a sunny, faraway locale-- in this case, far from the band's native  rainy Portland, Oregon, in Marfa, Texas. The vibe of the album is relaxed and sun-soaked-- especially  ""Psychic City (Voodoo City)"", which features an elastic groove built  on a dubby, reggae-ish keyboard melody inspired by the bassline of Althea  and Donna's ""Uptown Top Ranking"".</p>
<p>Regardless of influence or intent, however, <i> See Mystery Lights</i> is a triumph. It's a feel-good album for an  era that could use a little happiness, a sweaty collection of heady,  hedonistic tunes just in time for the hottest days of the year. And  the best part is that one spin of this wily, sunny disc will be able  to transport you back to summer vacation any day of the year.</p></div>"|13334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13334-see-mystery-lights/|8.5|Rebecca Raber

He is an acknowledged inheritor of Miles Davis and Teo Macero's experiments in electric jazz and studio-aided collage composition, and yet the ambient nature of his work often lands his discs in the new age racks. Hassell studied with Stockhausen and Pandit Pran Nath, played on the first recording of Terry Riley's <i>In C</i>, and collaborated with the likes of La Monte Young, Talking Heads, David Sylvian, and Ry Cooder. He's also the inventor of something he calls Fourth World, ""a unified primitive/futuristic sound combining features of world ethnic styles with advanced electronic techniques""-- a phrase that's hard to shake free, in 2009, of associations with Putumayo compilations, or Burning Man. It's difficult to think of another contemporary jazz musician whose reputation encompasses such opposing poles: conceptual rigor on the one hand; easy listening on the other.</p>
<p>Hassell's new album, <i>Last Night the Moon Came Dropping Its Clothes in the Street</i>, does in fact make for easy listening-- profoundly warm, immersive, relaxing listening. It's electric-blanket music, isolation-tank music, lucid-dreaming music that moves as assuredly as if by the power of your own suggestion. I've been tempted to call it ""yoga for the mind,"" except that the phrase sounds way too glib, too slack, for music this rigorous. But it's also a puzzle, a non-Euclidean rendering sourced from small-ensemble sessions and recomposed via digital editing. It's as hard to separate out the music's discrete pieces as it is to discern between its structure and sense of drift.</p>
<p>Much of the album's pleasures are immediate and visceral. This is as sumptuous as ""ambient"" music gets. The album opens with a glowing song, ""Aurora"", that sounds exactly like its title suggests, with scratchy, glowing drones of uncertain provenance taking on a daybreak shine as Hassell's trumpet rises like a heat mirage in echoing, overlapping lines; there's a faint echo of dub in the bass. ""Time and Place"" is slow, spelunking funk, descending ropey bass lines through chambers where ambient shimmer illuminates melodic figures as lifelike as cave drawings: bluegrass violin, panting organs, and of course Hassell's reverberant horn melodies, which slide around the edges of the song's key signature, highlighting its contours in slippery relief. A dubby pulse echoes the percussive rattle of Hassell's <i>Earthquake Island</i> and, on a more contemporary note, the Moritz von Oswald Trio's <i>Vertical Ascent</i>, which might not be surprising, given that von Oswald has professed his admiration for Hassell's work. The track leads almost seamlessly into ""Abu Gil"", where violin and electric keys blow its modal structure wide open. One of the album's centerpieces, the 13-minute song is grounded in more loping percussion and a pinging bass line that wobbles like a taut clothesline; Hassell's trumpet is refracted through delays and a harmonizer effect, throwing shadows in fourths and fifths as it slinks, catlike, around the changes.</p>
<p>You might not notice any of these things on your first or even tenth listen. The measured pacing, especially on the slowly unfolding title track, lulls you into a state that can be described only as hypnotic, as reassuringly resolving string phrases lay out the soft, spongy ground over which Hassell drifts and soars. Like any bird on the wind, Hassell knows how and when to conserve his energies; he lies quiet for long stretches, letting reverb carry his melodies. Often, the line between cause and effect is blurred beyond recognition, leaving only a suggestion of breath lingering in the air. The music's gaseous feel serves to highlight more solid forms, like blocky keyboard chords, that sit like squat, rounded ruins poking through the forest canopy.</p>
<p>The title comes from a poem by the 13th century Persian Sufi poet Jalaluddin Rumi: ""Last night the moon came dropping its clothes in the street/ I took it as a sign to start singing,/ Falling up into the bowl of sky."" Some 700 years later, it proves to have been an exceptionally prescient description of Hassell's own malleable approach, melting geometrical structures with blur and bent pitches, turning breath to wind and cheating gravity with every updraft.</p>
<p>But if part of the music's pleasure is its liquid physicality, an equal measure derives from its conceptual base. Formally, it's hard to say exactly what to call this stuff: jazz? Electro-acoustic improv? Ambient dub? All those terms apply in some measure. Rather than a record of single performances, the album is stitched together from fragments of both studio sessions and live recordings-- although ""stitched"" is an inexact metaphor for joints this smeared and seamless.</p>
<p>As Hassell describes it in his liner notes, ""The music presented here is a montage of the last years of concerts and the changing cast of the group I call Maarifa Street-- all musicians who have contributed their personalities-- the way an actor does to a film-- to this living, morphing process that occasionally gets set down as a 'record.'"" The slippage in his hyphenated phrases approaches the horizontal rush of the record itself, ideas overlapping, subjects blurring, dependent clauses assuming a commanding role. His touring group Maarifa Street is here a core ensemble including Peter Freeman (bass, guitar, percussion), Jan Bang (live sampling), Rick Cox (guitar), Jamie Muhoberac (keyboard), Kheir-Eddine M'Kachiche (violin), Dino J.A. Deane (live sampling), Eivind Aarset (guitar), Helge Norbakken (drums), and Steve Shehan (percussion), with a few other players occasionally rotating in for a single track. The album's sleevenotes also credit Thomas Newman and Rick Cox for the title track's repeated string phrases, Eivind Aarset for ""a beautiful loop"" in ""Blue Period"" and ambient dub producer Pole for a sample used in an unspecified track. (Bringing things full circle, the composer Miles Evans-- son of Miles Davis' collaborator Gil Evans-- is credited ""for the atmospherics"" in ""Abu Gil"".) That might look like a lot of names in a row, but I think they bear repeating, for Hassell clearly means to impress upon us that this is a collective effort. Even Arnaud Mercier and his live-sampling software, Cognition, get a mention-- suggesting the degree to which the album's creation was not only a collaborative process, but one where the easy assumptions about chops and genius don't apply. Wrapping your mind around this music is about as easy as grabbing a fistful of river, but that's precisely what makes it so rewarding.</p></div>"|13247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13247-last-night-the-moon-came-dropping-its-clothes-in-the-street/|8.5|Philip Sherburne

After two full-lengths, it's clear this is Desolation Wilderness' style, a sound not so much lo-fi as lo-res. Thus far, the band's best work is as a kind of hazy memory trigger; their slowly cascading guitar-led melodies can be imbued with the kind of easygoing beauty that brings to mind slow Super 8 footage of cars rolling by, parks full of trees, sky full of sun, that sort of thing. Yeah, they still evoke flickering memories of stuff like Galaxie 500 and the softer side of shoegaze, too, but there's less of a lead guitar bent this time out, which does help tamp down some of its predecessor's heavy debt.<i></i> Leader Nicolaas Zwart seems to have put a little more time into crafting songs rather than soundscapes this time out, and whereas <i>White Light</i> felt scrapbooky and occasionally tentative, <i>New Universe</i> sports a newfound confidence and cohesion. Still, though. Is it ever gauzy.</p>
<p>And still a tad short in the song department. My biggest complaint about <i>White Light Strobing</i> was that it was too easy to ignore, too breezy, and that it unraveled with concentration. <i>New Universe</i> finds a new way to fall right into the same trap, masking a bunch of jangle-pop songs in far too much jangle. From moment one, as cymbals meet guitars and slowly swell into a loose strum, the music is constantly clouded by the haze. Zwart's lyrics are almost completely obscured by the production-- his own-- and though the band's casual handling of familiar forms can at its best read like the Byrds and the Kinks in a dense fog, songs too often slip by without leaving much in their wake. As with <i>White Light</i>, one certainly senses a wistful, romantic feeling even when the exact message of the song gets lost in the fray; it helps that track titles include ""Strange Cool Girl"" and ""Restless Heart"", I guess. But unlike, say, fellow muzzlepoppers the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, the obscured sonics don't mask any songwriting shortcomings but in fact often amplify them. A few of these tunes feel as though, if you peeled away the film, you'd only find part of a song.</p>
<p>Not so with ""San Francisco 2AM"", which starts out chiming and ends up pounding, its melody dizzying like the peak of a long evening out. It's one of just a few moments on <i>New Universe</i> where the song seems perfectly in step with the sound, and it rivals ""Come Over in Your Silver Car"" as the band's best tune. The near-gallop of ""Restless Heart"" and the easygoing, almost Philly soul-tinged ""Satellite Song"" stand out as well, sharp spikes in otherwise fairly staid waters. After <i>White Light</i>, I would've thought Zwart would go the other way with it, throwing a lot more mood into his tunes rather than simply draping atmosphere on top of fairly traditional guitar-pop arrangements. This one-two-three punch near the center of the record-- with the sunsoaked ""Boardwalk Theme"" and the Bradford Coxian ""No Tomorrow (Version)"" trailing shortly behind ""San Francisco""-- does suggest that Zwart can get the balance right when he wants, but there's just not quite enough tune in these tunes, and after one too many unremarkable songs, the production haze casts a pall like an overcast afternoon.</p>
<p>All that in mind, I actually like <i>New Universe</i> a little better than its predecessor. It's far less frustrating, for one; <i>White Light</i> <i>Strobing</i> went from one superb little twinkler to one boring-ass overstretched guitar noodle and back too many times to be a satisfying listen, but you can do far worse than to put on <i>New Universe</i> and forget about it until the good parts kick in. Though it's not quite as warm as <i>White Light</i>-- those long instrumental passages did help there-- <i>New Universe</i>'s shading is more captivating; <i>Light</i> was a sun-bleached postcard to <i>New Universe</i>'s scratchy but comparatively spry filmstrip footage. And Zwart's got a way with melody, though he's got a way to go in developing it, so it's not too terribly hard to see the comfortable but too-easy <i>New Universe</i> as the first step in a potential holding pattern. As it stands right now, though, it's a nice bit of gauzy, gray-hued racket to throw on when you've only got so much attention to give.</p></div>"|13340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13340-new-universe/|6.3|Paul Thompson

Or so says Esser, an English electro-pop troubadour who sports a flattop that's vintage mod (or exaggerated Jordan Knight). Despite a nonchalant delivery and mostly sunny melodies, he seems down. On opener ""Leaving Town"", he says, ""It feels like I'm drowning, so I threw my mobile in the sea."" On the cartoonish chorus of the title track, he suggests putting on a brave face when the morning comes, and if that little affirmation doesn't see you through the day, attach a brick to your legs and jump into a lake. By track three, he doesn't mince words: ""I've got a problem, it's called living.""</p>
<p>With a musical bent towards bouncy melodies and eclectic instrumentation, Ben Esser's debut album of fractured pop is still more muddled than sharp. The dark undercurrents in some of his songs make sense. He's often namechecking 1960s British producer Joe Meek, a skilled yet paranoid artist known for both his tragic demise, a shotgun murder/suicide in 1967, and his ramshackle audio experimentation on hit singles such as ""Telstar"". Esser seems to aspire to create conceptual pop-- not sure if his matching good and bad neck tattoos are commentary on the duality of man or just fashionable ink. But where Meek literally experimented with found sounds and production gear, Esser plays with established techniques and toys to no singular effect.</p>
<p>Pop singers certainly don't need to reinvent music production to be gripping, but Esser's debut doesn't strain or stretch creative boundaries or hit that perfect balance between playful and experimental in the same way that contemporaries like Micachu and the Shapes do. ""Leaving Town"" and the title track coast by pleasantly enough, with horns or synth flourishes dressing up run of the mill beats. ""Stop Dancing"" is a Streets-like meditation on getting fucked up in the club, and single ""Headlock"" rolls by with bulbous beats and warped synths before ending in a pool of squeaks and sound effects. While he shows some skill at the kitchen-sink approach to pop experimentation, perfecting it is far from simple.</p>
<p>Esser's lyrics, often delivered in a sub-Damon Albarn style, swing towards self-deprication, though they can sound ham-fisted and ring hollow. Take a track like ""I Love You"", where love can be dangerous like a fire in your kitchen-- a grease fire of passion? He even adds that ""love is no excuse for bad art,"" a line no singer should ever serve up with a straight face. ""Satisfied"" sways with staccato piano and stock phrases like, ""You know it's hard to please a woman/ She'll put you on your knees and make you cry,"" and originals like, ""You know a man can never win/ Even if you buy her all the shoes."" Esser needs to tweak the formula a bit, though Cee-Lo has reportedly enlisted him to do production on his solo album, so he'll get plenty of opportunities.

So what now that Fred Thomas, he of the erstwhile retro-pop outfit Saturday Looks Good to Me, is now recording as part of City  Center on the same imprint?</p>
<p><i>City Center </i>doesn't necessarily come off like a true pop record, but where Grouper made a point of sounding fully submerged, City Center never go so far that they can't come up for air. Somewhere between early Paw Tracks' folk abstractions and the recent outpouring of lo-fi dream beat, most of <i>City Center </i>is content to drift in and out of its aqueous surroundings like a buoy. The major chords and ringing ambience of ""Killer Whale"" make for a welcoming entrance point, though Thomas' vocals sound like they've been suspended in some kind of gelatin. If you're looking for a commonality between Coldplay's ""Yellow"", Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's ""So Everyone"", and Animal Collective's ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"", it's the same ringing B-major chord that begins ""Open/House""-- likewise here, amidst punchy synth kicks, it heralds an unusual display of scrutability even while erratic panning, processed steel drums and plate reverb give it distance.</p>
<p>You hear echoes of Thomas' past work on ""Gladest"" and ""Summer School"", which hide otherwise sure-footed progressions under bobbing, waterlogged percussion and bell-timbres. Lyrics are, at best, implications and vocal melodies are content to eddy away with no plans of return. Ultimately, it's the dynamic between melodic resonance (""Young Diamond"") and found-sound obfuscation (the four minutes of ""You Are a Force"" are pregnant with stay amp hum) that defines a debut that I'd call ""promising,"" if only it gave any sort of indication that it was looking to become a part of some sort of artistic arc, as opposed to a stasis with plenty of breathing room-- even when <i>City Center </i>may appear impenetrable, it's still welcoming. C'mon in, the water's great.</p></div>"|13287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13287-city-center/|6.8|Ian Cohen

In 2009, you kind of need to know some C++ just to talk about bands. The trend began in dreamy California, which gave us the skuzzy-sweet Nodzzz and Wavves, and then migrated as far as Nebraska (UUVVWWZ) and Glasgow (Dananananaykroyd). Meanwhile, in serious Brooklyn, the Antlers were quietly working on a coincidental antithesis to this fad. <i>Hospice </i>answers silliness with solemnity, jitters with nerve. Their band name simply describes their music: a delicately branching instrument of force.</p>
<p>Not that the Antlers are startlingly original-- they're just swinging for the bleachers at a time when it seems fashionable to bunt, or put your forehead on the bat and spin until you get dizzy. Their widescreen sentimentality comes with an equally familiar back-story. You remember the Bon Iver beat: Sad, bearded dude emerges from self-imposed exile with batch of urgently intimate songs; recruits band; self-releases album that earns surprise web-buzz and gets picked up by venerable indie label. Well, the Antlers used to be the solo project of Peter Silberman, who wrote <i>Hospice </i>while emerging from a period of ""social isolation."" During the bedroom recording process, two guest musicians (drummer Michael Lerner and multi-instrumentalist Darby Cicci) became permanent members. They self-released <i>Hospice </i>in March, and Frenchkiss picked it up after web- and NPR-praise helped sell out its first pressing.</p>
<p>The Antlers' skyscraping blend of the ambient and the anthemic is a far cry from Bon Iver's subtle folksiness, but Silberman and Justin Vernon emerged from their traumas seeming equally scoured and eager to reconnect. <i>Hospice </i>is bereft of irony and cynicism, as befits a rather ghastly narrative that feels, perhaps deceptively, autobiographical. Centered around a relationship with a terminally ill child, and evocatively spun from eerie hospital scenery, snippets of conversations with doctors, terrifying dreams, and the periodic intrusions of Sylvia Plath, it becomes a broad meditation on guilt, duty, mortality, and hope in the face of hopelessness. The emotional payload, while artfully couched, is fervent and bleeding. Silberman's affecting earnestness, not to mention his sweet voice, allows him to pull off lines like, ""All the while I know we're fucked/ And not getting un-fucked soon,"" while sounding more prayerful than cynical.</p>
<p>Given the bluster of the music and its fixation on death and illness (not to mention Silberman's creaky diction and fluttery falsetto), it's impossible not to be reminded of Arcade Fire's <i>Funeral</i>. You could even fix <i>Hospice</i>'s precedent a bit earlier-- its starry atmosphere and bludgeoning tenderness evoke Cursive's <i>Domestica </i>with a pop-noise sheen. Like these groups, the Antlers plumb that elusive place where the personally specific becomes universal. They achieve this by keeping the human frailty of the singer intact while inflating his feelings to mythological proportions. You can imagine Silberman, in his isolation, growing world-sized and full; how the emotional forces he grappled with came to seem meteorological.</p>
<p>This sense of the boundary between self and world-at-large collapsing permeates <i>Hospice</i>. The lyrics cover shades of emotion from despairing persistence (""Kettering"") to desperate joy (the 21st-birthday fantasia ""Bear""); the music tells the same story, through quicksilver currents of tension and tranquility. ""Sylvia"" alternates between acute frailty and Queen-caliber bravado, guided by the sort of gnarled electronic line the Antlers love (see also the monotonous buzz whipping around the corners of chipper guitar chords on ""Two""). But what’s really great is how these modulations of weight are integrated into an album-long sweep, with crescendos nested inside decrescendos, coiling surges inside lengthy unwinding passages. It's as vast and empathetic as loneliness itself, a generous framework through which Silberman can show us almost everything: The tiny figure on the horizon and his huge shadow on the mountain, the extreme weathers roiling about him at once symbolic and real.</p></div>"|13196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice/|8.5|Brian Howe

The Vancouver singer/multi-instrumentalist who sidelines as Lightning Dust with fellow Black Mountaineer Joshua Wells, lends single-slug words ""hand"" and ""sea"" a dozen extra syllables and a line like ""this city is in a panic"" a waving-or-drowning inscrutability. Throughout Lightning Dust's second LP, <i>Infinite Light</i>, Webber's on the verge of tears-- or laughter, depending on how her voice finds you-- and her raw emotion makes for one of the fiercest, most stirring vocal performances of any release this year.</p>
<p>But I don't want to sell <i>Infinite Light</i> as an alt-""American Idol"" vocal exhibition-- all weird drama, no script. Webber's fever and shy fervor is precisely suited to the album's thematic conceit: the anxiety and streaky joy of new love, which unfolds in a loose narrative you can trace from ""I Knew""'s itchy iterations of lust, to the morning-after calm of ""Waiting on the Sun to Rise"", to ""Take It Home""'s melancholy crossroads straddle. And unlike the duo's 2007 self-titled debut, which too often banked on the atmosphere wafting off Well's pulsed organ tones, these songs start with basic pop templates and expand on them with inventive, genre-exploding arrangements. Sure, Webber and Wells make the predictable Cali-canyon and psychedelic space moves you'd expect from people who've worked closely with Stephen McBean, but they call up a range of references-- Krautrock, girl group, piano man, and source du jour, Fleetwood Mac.</p>
<p>According to the players, the five-day loan of a Steinway grand piano inspired this mostly keyboard-driven clutch of spontaneous-sounding tunes. Blues boogie ""The Times"" finds its capital letter emphasis in the piano's capacity for booming, bounding chords, and ""Antonia Jane"" deploys the instrument in rolling, arpeggiated waves for the opposite reason-- its knack for sensitive conversational counterpoint. First single and should-be summer mixtape staple ""I Knew"", however, owes its unexpected electricity to the collision of drum machine, quicksilver organ, dusty guitar, and molasses-mouth vocals, its jittery propulsion reminiscent of Black Mountain's dark odyssey ""No Hits"". And ""Wondering What Everyone Knows"", a kind of homage to paranoid doomed-love ballads once emoted by Lesley Gore and Nancy Sinatra, finds delicious melodrama in a wall of histrionic string swells and lumbering drum fills. ""Never Seen""'s foggy synthesizers, on the other hand, produce the most characteristic Lightning Dust sound (if such a thing exists among folks this enamored of so many different ones) of trippy hippie mysticism.</p>
<p>I could easily rustle up praise for every track on the album; notwithstanding a title that says <i>too much weed</i> at best and <i>religious cult</i> at worst, <i>Infinite Light</i> is solid. And its overall quality owes more than a small debt to the fact that Webber and Wells have the good taste and modesty to keep it at 10 songs (supporting my long-held conviction, anyway, that if rock bands want to pack more than 10 tracks or 40 minutes of material on an LP, they should have to petition a court first). That said, if these guys happen to have any more casually gorgeous songs like these just lying around, I'd love to hear them.</p></div>"|13295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13295-infinite-light/|8.0|Amy Granzin

Unlike writers such as Ray Davies or Elvis Costello, Pernice isn't known for his tricky wordplay, tight character studies, or flights of fancy. Rather, as an erstwhile solo artist and the leader of the Scud Mountain Boys, Chappaquiddick Skyline, and, most prominently, the Pernice Brothers, he's focused on the big picture: the swoon of strings, the subtle interplay of chiming guitars, hook-enhancing harmonies, the whole slightly out-of-time chamber-pop package. Lyrics included, of course, but rarely are they specifically so clever or incisive to call undue attention to themselves.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That's a tad ironic, since Pernice, unlike 99% of his peers, actually holds an MFA in creative writing from U Mass, but up until now one of the few documents of his fiction was his 2003 33 1/3 novella inspired by the Smiths' <i>Meat Is Murder</i>. Now comes <i>It Feels So Good When I Stop</i>, Pernice's debut novel, and it, too, features its fair share of autobiographical elements, an aspect which Pernice has cannily amplified by recording a companion ""novel soundtrack"" to the book containing several covers of songs referenced therein.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's a smart way for a songwriter-turned-novelist to break the fourth wall without distracting from his prose, complementing the story (some snippets of which, as read by Pernice, appear interspersed through the disc) while emphasizing his parallel musical background and prowess. To that end, the covers here are particularly diverse, ranging from Sebadoh and Plush to Tom T. Hall and Todd Rundgren. Pernice's instinct for assembling the whole package comes in handy, too-- not just in the music's connection to the novel but how Pernice takes this eclectic slate of source material and fits it to his established melodic métier.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Del Shannon's ""I Go to Pieces"", for example, undeniably reflects its<span> 19</span>60s rock'n'roll origins, but Pernice polishes it up and contemporizes it enough that it wouldn't sound particularly out of place on one of his more conventional records. The same goes for Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham's ""I'm Your Puppet"", a hit for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_%26_Bobby_Purify"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James &amp; Bobby Purify</a> and here a laid-back jangle-pop breeze. On the indie rock tip, the jagged guitar lead of Pernice's wistful rendition of Sebadoh's ""Soul and Fire"" is the only nod to the skuzzier origins of the original.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Elsewhere Sammy Johns' smooth 1975 hit ""Chevy Van"" and Tom T. Hall's malleable new standard ""That's How I Got to Memphis"" are reminders that Pernice's career began in alt-country, while the Dream Syndicate's ""Tell Me When It's Over"" reminds us of the college rock and punk roots that made so many alt-country acts ""alt"" to begin with. ""Black Smoke (No Pope)"" hones closest to the novel<span style=""font-style: normal;"">, credited as it is to the Young Accuser, the name of the band featuring Pernice's page-bound protagonist. It's an easy-going instrumental that, in an instance of life-imitating-art-imitating-life, is getting its own separate<span> </span>7"" release (as<span> </span>a B-side) via Sub Pop, the label that gave Pernice his first break back in the Scud Mountain Boys' days. (Sub Pop calls it ""the non-fiction version"" of a fictional single).</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It bears mentioning that<i> It Feels So Good When I Stop</i>, the book-- which begins with a quote from Elvis Costello's <i>King of Americ</i>a-era ""Our Little Angel""-- also references such acts as the Pogues, the Clash, Naked Raygun, and the Chills (among many, many others), bands that might have pushed Pernice further outside his comfort zone. Even if as usual said comfort zone is nothing to complain about, Pernice's way with a pretty tune is pretty well documented.<i> </i>If<i> It Feels So Good When I Stop</i> expands his abilities as a writer, it'd be at least interesting to hear a record of his that does the same for his skills as a musician.</p>

Daniel Preston (Tiffany's husband, and the other half of the L.A.-based global fusion outfit) plays the shopkeep who becomes increasingly frustrated with the bizarre antics of these grocery-terrorists (from the hatcheting of a female customer to just a general disregard for produce), only to finally give in when the pair throw a rager in the booze aisle. All is forgiven (I think), but I couldn't help but feel for the poor guy: I happen to feel the exact same way about Rainbow Arabia itself. The aimless rambunction is fine for a while, but nothing really gets off the ground unless the groove is firmly in place.</p>
<p>The fact that <i>Kabukimono</i> has such a high batting average doesn't really have much to do with freshness: out of the seven tracks presented here, two of them are remixes of year-old songs found on the band's debut EP <i>Basta</i>, leaving a scant 17 minutes of new music to explore. It's kind of a shame that the remixes are such duds, because some of the band's songs could benefit from a little cleverly balanced outsider influence. You spend a lot of the time admiring the freeform liveliness and nifty instrumentation rather than the tunes themselves, so when a little restraint is exercised, you find yourself, well, frustrated that it isn't exercised more often.</p>
<p>Still, there's a lot of charm in <i>Kabukimono</i>'s amateur feel. Where ""Haunted Hall"" feels a little half-baked, ""I Know I See I Love I Go"" imports the same eerie trepidation and offers it some shape, giving way to the perfect soundtrack to a chase through the tangled alleyways of Algiers. Much of <i>Kabukimono</i> is a little seedy and a little dangerous in that way, which is pretty refreshing coming from a band that tries on so many inherently cheerful global stylings. Maybe the blithe Congotronic opener ""Holiday in Congo"" (a horrifying situation in a certain context) isn't as warmly innocent as it sounds, now grafted into a potentially tongue-in-cheek affair that suggests the Prestons are slyer than we initially assumed. It's a good look.</p>
<p>And yes, the album is fun to bop around to, so maybe it's nitpicky to complain that none of the songs really stick. But when you're throwing us ideas this playful and engaging, it's hard not to expect a little more. ""Harlem Sunrise"" is most certainly the album highlight, but also provides an essential insight into why some of these tracks work and why some don't: The island vibe and cool tin drums are bouncy and affable, but it's that great, plainly-stated guitar line that provides a wonderful juxtaposition between inner-city melancholy and malaise and windsurfing with a daiquiri in your hand. ""Harlem"" offers some much need intricacy for a band whose sound too often flirts with greenhornism, and proves that there's room for real expanse in the near future (oh, and maybe more than five new songs next time around).</p></div>"|13346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13346-kabukimono/|6.6|Zach Kelly

But they've never seemed to fully unpack until now. Sure, they self-released a debut in 2007 that was born of the San Diego sunshine, but it took verdant Portland to give Nurses the rain they really needed to grow. Since arriving they've taken on a third member, percussionist James Mitchell, and hunkered down in an old Victorian house to self-record a much higher profile sophomore release. And as such, <i>Apple's Acre</i> sounds homemade in the best possible way. It is a quality that speaks to not only the intimacy of the recording, but also the confidence and comfort that Nurses now have in their delicately shambolic sound. (Not to mention the plain fact that something can't be homemade unless you actually have a home to make it in-- and Nurses now do.)</p>
<p>Like the shaggy younger sibling of Animal Collective or Grizzly Bear on a tight budget, Nurses marry dreamy harmonies to spare arrangements of slightly out-of-tune pianos, carnival organs, and basic percussion from a lone snare or tambourine. The songs have a real sonic sprawl due to the space within the airy voices-- they manage to sound cohesive without sounding dense-- and the ticking, whirring electronic effects that resonate in the background mysteriously. With a reedy, acrobatic vocal timbre that can recall Jeff Mangum, Muse's Matt Bellamy, or Win Butler all in the span of one song, Chapman adds a messy, primal pulse to the ethereal, otherworldly arrangements. His not-quite-vulgar but definitely earthy delivery keeps these haunting tracks from living entirely in a heady realm of glimmering pianos and off-kilter rhythms, anchoring the vaporous harmonies with his slightly incongruous red-blooded delivery.</p>
<p>The band rightly kicks off <i>Apple</i>'<i>s Acre</i> with ""Technicolor"", a track that not only acts as an introduction to Nurses' ramshackle combination of the sweet and the hard, but also, with its title, announces their big, bright musical ambition. With pianos that sound like the gentle tinkling of a crystal chandelier layered atop reverberating vocals and heavily galloping percussion, the track constantly threatens to blossom into a psychedelic anthem, but muffled by an echoey effect, it remains subtly muted. Though there are bold color strokes in many of their songs-- the chirpy whistling on ""Caterpillar Playground"", the vintage-inspired ""I Only Want to Be With You""-like vocal melody of the title track, the swirling stadium- or carousel-worthy organs of ""Bright Ideas""-- most of the collection is painted with a more subdued palette of watercolors. ""Lita"", for instance, tames its firm, percussive stomp with lush vocals, a repetitive melody, and ghostly electronic effects.</p>
<p>The toll that the band's itinerant wanderings had on the duo is audible in <i>Apple</i>'<i>s Acre</i>'s lyrics. With lines about trying to get back home (on ""Technicolor"") or the differences between a house and a home (on ""Lita""), you can hear the two drifters yearning to put down roots. But that can be attributed to the fact that many of these songs were written years ago, during the band's travels, and only recently recorded in their Portland attic-cum-studio. And so, in juxtaposing those lyrics against their lysergic harmonies and lovely, strange piano twinkles, both of which feel lived in, you can hear that those desires for permanence have been answered. For the time being at least, Nurses have found a home, and they sound good there because, as we know, there's no place like it.</p></div>"|13263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13263-apples-acre/|7.2|Rebecca Raber

<p class=""MsoNormal"">A decade ago, the idea that Modest Mouse would have the #1 album in the U.S. seemed about as unlikely as a liberal African-American president. But sure enough, <i>We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</i> debuted strong back in 2007, and the initial shock turned first into living-in-the-future optimism and then into holy-shit-what-do-we-do-now jitters. Would Isaac Brock, you know, blink? Would Modest Mouse's follow-up be a Best Buy exclusive? Would their next single end up on a summer blockbuster soundtrack? (Do they even make soundtracks for summer blockbusters anymore?)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But the band's gradual acceptance via radio, commercials, and ""American Idol"" reveals the porousness of the 2000s mainstream rather than Brock's own career ambitions. Over six albums in 12 years, he has thought up countless metaphors to express the same cosmic anomie, and if his recent songs have displayed a sense of hopefulness and maybe even contentment, it sounds both more precarious and more intense following so many years of growling angst. It seems he can't be anything other than his usual weird self, as this new EP suggests.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>No One's First and You're Next</i> is not a real follow-up to <i>We Were Dead</i>. It collects eight songs dating as far back as 2005's <i>Good News for People Who Love Bad News,</i> all of which have been previously released in one form or another: some A- and B-sides from earlier this year, along with album outtakes like ""King Rat"", which is famous for having a video directed by Heath Ledger. A remora to the previous album's shark, <i>No One's First</i> recalls 1999's <i>Building Nothing Out of Something</i> and 2001's <i>Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks</i>, both of which assembled leftovers into stand-alone statements that sound as cohesive as the material that fed them. <i>Building</i> in particular stands as one of the band's best releases of any length.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's neither surprising nor especially troubling that <i>No One's First</i> sounds scattershot compared to those two releases. As the band has grown more popular, it has mutated considerably over the last two albums, making forays into more accessible pop as well as into stranger Dixieland territory and collaborating with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and former Smith Johnny Marr (both of whom appear here). So this EP has a lot of ground to cover, and does a decent job of portraying a band that can stretch itself from epic guitar workouts like ""Whale Song"" to straightforward singles like ""Satellite Skin"" to warped brass-band reimaginings like ""Perpetual Motion Machine"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That makes <i>No One's First</i>-- all shortcomings aside-- an intriguing listen, one that presents Modest Mouse's defining characteristics intact even as it plays up new ones. ""Perpetual Motion Machine"" invites the Dirty Dozen Brass Band back for another round, their horns melting and flaring as Brock leads them in a sing-along about our own mortal fears. It's nothing new, but the central idea-- that we all want to keep moving forever-- puts an interesting spin on Brock's favorite subject. ""Guilty Cocker Spaniels"" and ""King Rat"" sound better for sounding more anthropomorphic, and yet for all their weirdness, the tracks barrel as forcefully as their singles, with Jeremiah Green's fluid drumming and the dense guitars matching Brock's fevered carnival barker delivery.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Especially considering the EP's <span> </span>title<i>, No One's First</i> opens and closely weakly. ""Satellite Skin"" is an adequate guitar jam and an obvious single in the vein of ""Float On"" and ""Dashboard"", albeit not nearly as catchy or as insistent, and ""I've Got It All (Most)"" never quite works up any real momentum to accompany its lyrical contradictions. It keeps trying to fade out long before it ends. On the other hand, the strongest part of the EP is its middle. Drawing from the same well as the opener and closer, ""History Sticks to Your Feet"" indulges the clash of frontwards and backwards guitar and the blistered staccato of Brock's bark to create the sense of rumbling rising action and thwarted release. On the other hand, he repeatedly rhymes ""history"" and ""mystery,"" which seems a bit unimaginative for such a careful songwriter.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Autumn Beds"" seems to split the difference between the pop instincts of ""Float On"" and the rock anthems of ""Little Motel"" and ""Trailer Trash"", but comes out somewhere completely different. Brock can spit venom, but he can also write a supremely elegant melody, as he does here, and the banjogazer accompaniment bolsters the song-ending sing-along. In the EP's best sequencing flourish, ""Autumn Beds"" is followed by ""Whale Song"", a lengthy near-instrumental where the guitars sound like saxophones rather than maritime mammals. Set at a buzzy midtempo, it layers the guitars and later the vocals densely, recalling the scabrous attack of ""Doin' the Cockroach"" filtered through the stargazing sensibilities of ""The Stars Are Projectors"". Given its years-spanning tracklist, <i>No One's First</i> obviously has a retrospective flavor, but it also seems to point the way ahead for Modest Mouse, if only to suggest that the band will continue moving in opposite directions-- backwards and forwards-- all at once.</p>

Part of the reason of late is Johnson's own doing; the outfit has been dormant since 2005's breezy Laurel Canyon paean <i>Spelled in Bones</i>. Johnson himself has been plenty busy, though, between becoming the first non-Albuquerquean to play with Mercer &amp; co., and sitting in with <i>American Beauty</i> acolytes and fellow Sup Popians Vetiver. As for the latest release: The word ""ruminant"" applies to cows making cud as well as brains making decisions, and this effort, the one he's had the most time to chew on, emerges unsurprisingly as the fullest-sounding, and (by a hair over <i>Bones</i>) the best thing he's done yet.</p>
<p>Listen to any of Johnson's albums for more than a track or two, and you get the sense that he's not really one for drastic change; instead, he's capable of flexing within the rustic confines of his chosen vibe. His ear for detail here is sharper than ever: The bittersweet and nostalgic ""Singing Joy to the World"" bookends an imaginary relationship between Three Dog Night's titular tune sung at a fairground performance and a girl dancing to Prince's ""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man"" at a bar. But he's able to bliss out, too-- ""Flamingo"" is post-tweaked with crackle and echo to sound like a Sun Records doo-wop pastiche, Johnson closing the record in giddy falsetto: ""Everything is gonna be just fine.""</p>
<p>That's a nice way to describe <i>Ruminant</i>, and Johnson's work more generally: ""just fine."" That's not damnation via faint praise-- the record is ""fine,"" as in an indication of precision and elegance. As always, Johnson's gift for grab is subtle but effective. In a 2005 interview with Popmatters, he expressed a fondness for <i>Led Zeppelin III</i>, and though it took a while, sure enough, subtle variations on the forceful front-porch strum, stout drums of the borderline jammy ""Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"" underscores opener ""Primitive Man"", followed by the title track, which while namedropping a ""blue-eyed Merle"", packs enough pristine overdubs to even suggest <i>II</i>'s ""Ramble On"" or box set bonus ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"". The tossed-off saloon stomper ""The Hobo Girl"": yup, <i>Physical Graffiti</i>'s ""Boogie With Stu"".</p>
<p>Johnson also finds a way to make AM Gold fresh again by filtering his own spirit through a cast of characters. One offers roadside proverbs (""You'll always eat bread if you always have seeds to sow""), another relates a bluesy origin myth built on bringing cold weather wherever he travels, and another loves hearing about your dreams when he wakes up. For what it's worth, the album fits exceedingly well between <i>Wilco (The Album)</i> and Richard Swift's <i>The Atlantic Ocean</i>: ""My Unusual Friend"" fits breezy guitars over a staccato piano rhythm, and ""Being on Our Own"" is sympathetic country-pop. All this means that Fruit Bats, like their contemporaries, could unfortunately be passed over due to sheer familiarity. That'd be a shame, because <i>The Ruminant Band</i> only gets more rewarding as it settles in.</p></div>"|13350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13350-the-ruminant-band/|7.4|Eric Harvey

He cracked corny jokes and introduced cornier monster movies on WHBQ-TV's ""Fantastic Features"" and even recorded a few novelty hits, including the stiffly swinging ""Sivad Buries Rock and Roll"". Just a few years later, however, Davis was off television and mostly forgotten, working as a mechanic in rural Arkansas. Yet Sivad remains a pop-cultural touchstone for Mid-Southerners of a certain age, including Greg Cartwright of the Oblivians and Reigning Sound, who chose Sivad's motto as the title as the Sound's long-awaited fourth studio album, <i>Love and Curses</i>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That reference works as a grim reminder of the status of so many of Cartwright's influences, who prospered decades ago but are less than footnotes today, inspiring crate-digging musicians but rarely reaching the large audiences they once commanded. If Sivad buried rock'n'roll, Cartwright digs it up under torchlight in the dead of a moonless night, unearthing outer-boroughs girl-group sounds, deep-South R&amp;B rhythms, and universal garage-rock skuzz. It's no coincidence that the only cover on <i>Love and Curses</i> is an obscure single called ""Stick Up for Me"" by the Glass Sun. Does anyone remember them? Reigning Sound do, and the song's organ-drenched boogie momentum and shouted call-and-response are simultaneously nostalgic and immediate.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Coming across as the period's most diligent archivists, Reigning Sound have over the past few years backed former Shangri-La Mary Weiss in the studio and on tour and worked with Muscle Shoals legends Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, and Cartwright was briefly a member of Michigan garage rock lifers the Detroit Cobras. <i>Love and Curses</i> sounds as much a product of the present as of the past, and the new songs attack with goblin force but vampire sophistication, thanks to another new line-up. The rhythm section of drummer Lance Wille and bass player David Wayne Gay (formerly of Freakwater) add muscle and agility to the stomping ""If I Can't Come Back"" and ""Dangerous Game"", while Dave Amels lays down sweeping organ riffs on ""Something to Hold Onto"" and ""Broken Things"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The album never quite sounds as life-or-death urgent as 2004's <i>Too Much Guitar</i>, but that album lived up to its name by burying Cartwright alive. <i>Love and Curses</i> brings his vocals back to the forefront, although he still sings like he's being chased by some unknown specter. In addition to his open-wound rasp-- few singers today can convey grievous pain so easily-- he also has an eye for the cruelties and ironies of romance, which slice through every track. On the stand-out ""Debris"", he sings about a lover's heart turning to stone and his own turning to rubble, straining his voice like he has to cover his eyes but can't look away. Love can be horrifying, hilarious, gory, and deeply disturbing, so why not have a horror host like Sivad presiding over the chills, creeps, and scares?</p>

He's played a variety of stringed instruments for, like, every indie band in the Pacific Northwest. He moved to Copenhagen for a live stint with some mad Danes, Efterklang, and played on Library Tapes' <i>A Summer Beneath the Trees</i>. Amid all of this collaboration, he's eked out several of his own albums, ranging in style from post-classical (<i>Float</i>) to folk (<i>Home</i>). His catalog is consistently enjoyable and well-played, but we're still waiting for him to produce a major work. This isn't it, but it has a good excuse: <i>Music For Falling From Trees</i> is a score for a modern dance by Adrienne Hart, and standalone scores tend to be faintly anemic. It's like someone offering you half of a sandwich, then giving you just the bread. (There are some self-sufficient exceptions, like Jóhann Jóhannsson's <i>Englabörn</i>, which <i>Music For Falling From Trees</i> resembles.)</p>
<p>Broderick's score is surpassingly lovely, but it doesn't synthesize his influences into a unique voice-- ""Patient Observation"" is a dead-ringer for <i>Kronos Quartet Performs Philip Glass</i>, with a roundelay of longing strings conveying a lonely, enigmatic grandeur. ""Electroconvulsive Shock"", with its taut two-tone foundation, suggests the same affinity, and elsewhere, you'll hear unreconstructed echoes of Max Richter, Elodie Lauten, and many other composers of a post-minimal bent. Of course, trying on different voices is exactly what a musician Broderick's age should be doing. He wears them well, and will surely come into his own once he stops ticking items off of a to-do list and develops more focus. His development seems stunted only because of his prodigious output, which makes a brief career feel much longer than it is.</p>
<p>That said, fans of plain-old pretty (myself included) will get plenty of spins out of <i>Music For Falling From Trees</i>. It's musical air-freshener at worst, and inspired homage at best. The dance's themes of infirmity and redemption are writ large in the song titles, but it's Broderick's technique, not the narrative, that captivates. What you notice is the control of his pacing on ""An Introduction to the Patient"", the implacability with which lines of force gather on ""Pill Induced Slumber"", the liquid cadence of ""The Path to Recovery"". And standout track ""The Dream"" offers a hint as to what might well become Broderick's mature style-- heavenly drones spill into a light-footed dance for piano and pizzicato strings. It's a crystal-clear expression of an impulse that flits through most of Broderick's music, where he condenses folksy, jubilant themes out of masses of understated tone. It's exciting to hear his talent develop in something like real-time (given the fast pace of his output), as he finds his way toward a breakthrough that seems tantalizingly close at hand.</p></div>"|13289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13289-music-for-falling-from-trees/|6.7|Brian Howe

Finnish experimental/folk label Fonal harks back to days when an album's label stamp was indicative of sound (and Fonal's exquisite digipaks also provide reason to trudge to the record store). Amidst this, Sänpäkkilä has quietly claimed one of the best records in the Fonal catalogue as his own: Es' 2005 2xCD <i>Sateenkaarisuudelma</i> stands as a monument of kaleidoscopic drone and rabbit-eared chant. Sänpäkkilä's <i>Kesämaan Lapset</i> dials down <i>Sateenkaarisuudelma</i>'s sprawl while exploring increasingly electronic soundworlds.</p>
<p>It sometimes seems Sänpäkkilä hasn't yet carved out his own niche among the Fonal roster: Es records don't contain Kemialliset Ystavat's aggressive art foibles, Islaja's doom-y vocals, or Kiila's ever-buried songcraft. Sänpäkkilä does have a fine sense of construct, however: <i>Kesämaan Lapset</i> revolves around its title track, a 21-minute carousel of distorted voice, bold, horn-stained orchestration, and soft-palate fadeout. The final enveloping minutes-- heavenly choirs, champagne electronics, decaying keyboards-- are as blissfully opulent as anything a Fonal artist has laid to tape.</p>
<p>""Kesämaan Lapset"" has such a pull to it that the remainder of <i>Kesämaan Lapset</i> often seems slight in comparison. This despite Sänpäkkilä's sound-heavy compositions, the product of (likely) constant tinkering (visit <a href=""http://escycle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Es' website</a> and click ""gear"" for a step-by-step design process of a string-plucking mechanism built using a turntable). Sänpäkkilä saturates his tapes until they drip honey, and the result is not just beauty but a <i>lot</i> of beauty. The overloaded organ sendoff of ""Haamut Sun Sydämestä"" sounds like the chapel blew an amplifier tube; ""Ennen Oli Huonommin"" fills the opening five minutes of the album with randomized digital patter and way-off sighs. ""Kesä Ja Hymyilevät Huulet"" sees Sänpäkkilä adopting a weird sing-speak over a nervous keyboard that, 30 years and a continent away, might've belonged to Red Krayola.</p>
<p>Like all pretty experimental music that either contains few vocals or contains vocals we can't understand, it's easy to read religion into Es' compositions (an observation that has been made more generally about the Fonal label). They seem peaceful, reverent, and mysterious. And while it's certainly not fair to ascribe any specific religious intent to Sänpäkkilä, this is part of the appeal: no one should listen to <i>Kesämaan Lapset</i> to contemplate tires or coffee or closet storage. The album's artwork strongly suggests childhood nostalgia, but <i>Kesämaan Lapset</i> offers plenty of fuel for the navel-gazing subject matter of your choice.</p>
<p>Five albums in, this is hardly a surprise. <i>Kesämaan Lapset</i> is neither as wildly ambitious nor as carefully orchestrated as <i>Sateenkaarisuudelma</i> (the 11 minutes of bright-organ drone that comprise ""Säteet Sun Sielusta"" are as prettily, gorgeously stale as Es gets), but it does delve more heartily into chance-y electronics. More importantly, Sänpäkkilä has managed a warm, open composition cycle that is forgiving of his dozing and kind to his epics; so much so that it allows us to function the same way.</p></div>"|13349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13349-kesamaan-lapset/|6.9|Andrew Gaerig

Though bassist Carlos D is probably  the most widely lampooned member of Interpol, singer/guitarist Paul  Banks-- he of ""HER STORIES ARE BORING AND STUFF"" and other louted lyrics-- often bears the brunt of unfair Joy Division comparisons  and similarly unfair assertions that Interpol is ""just"" a rhythm  section band.  Banks' assumed moniker, and <i>Skyscraper</i>'s  ""Law &amp; Order: Special Birthdays Unit"" artwork, didn't really  do much to assuage the fear that this record would only provide more  fodder for naysayers.  Thankfully, the opposite is true: While <i>Julian Plenti Is... Skyscraper</i> is not as strong or as exciting  as Interpol's first two records, it is certainly a step up from their  third, and makes a good case for Banks' individual strengths within  and without the band.</p>
<p>None of which is to say that <i> Skyscraper</i> is a huge departure. ""Only If You Run""  is host to monolithic drums and layered guitars that would be right  at home on an Interpol record.  Even Banks' trademark delivery  is largely unchanged here; I don't think anybody else could deliver  the line, ""I've tasted degradation,"" with the same weirdly agitated  flatness.  <i>Skyscraper</i> leads off with two of its most Interpol-y  tracks, which is in a way reassuring, but also evokes an unwelcome sense  of deficiency.  Banks' minimal, repetitive vocal lines leave  a lot of room for the kind of propulsive instrumental flourishes at which Interpol excel, and without strong background players Banks occasionally  comes across as minimal and repetitive in a less flattering sense.</p>
<p>Only on ""Skyscraper"" does  Banks begin to use this space to his advantage.  On first listen,  the song comes off as a bit overlong and heavy on atmosphere, but something  about the way Banks measures out the syllables of ""shake me, shake  me, skyscraper"" is strangely haunting. Here, the absence of Banks'  bandmates works to his advantage; when he matches the intensity of Interpol's  nimble and forceful rhythm section, Banks often SOUNDS LIKE HE'S SINGING  IN ALL CAPS ALL THE TIME.  Here, Banks has more room to explore  a quieter register without it serving as a straight-up counterpoint  to the ""loud"" songs (à la ""Hands Away"" on <i>Turn on the Bright  Lights</i>).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a similarly minimal  approach has the opposite effect: On ""Unwind"", Banks explores exuberant  pop in a way that Interpol never could, building an entire song around  a simple vocal line, a drum loop, and trumpet fanfare.  ""Games for Days"" shoots for a similarly triumphant big rock chorus via more  conventional structure and arrangement, but lands on slick and generic.   Predictably, there are some skeezy lyrics here, but-- as with Interpol's  best songs-- they rarely seem at odds with the music itself, and often  add to the air of unease that permeates much of the record.</p>
<p>I don't know what exactly  it says about Paul Banks, but the most borderline-embarrassing tracks  on <i>Skyscraper</i> are, in fact, the strongest-- it's the safe,  formulaic moments that fall flat and, unfortunately, make up a substantial  portion of the record.  Still, <i>Skyscraper </i> is difficult to complain too much about: It establishes Banks' viability  as a musician outside of the context of Interpol, and it reaffirms the  unique potency of Interpol as a band.  RIGHT ON.</p></div>"|13224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13224-julian-plenti-is-skyscraper/|6.2|Matt LeMay

The Japanese instrumental quartet has no lyrics to parse. It has little pop culture impact. The group has many imitators, but it remains superior. It is no longer formally interesting. For 10 years, it has unfurled long songs with quiet beginnings and stormy climaxes. Mono albums are different in the way AC/DC and Motörhead ones are: they contain new combinations of old ingredients. Once a band establishes itself in music's canon-- and Mono has, next to post-rock colleagues Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky-- one either accepts or rejects its formula. The formula then replaces the canon as the critical yardstick. Now we compare Mono against itself.</p>
<p>What makes Mono most critic-proof is their goal: to make the listener feel. Much music has this goal, but with Mono it is writ large. Melodies are achingly pretty; climaxes are blitzkriegs of flying hair and frantic strumming. Mono's songs are essentially power ballads. What separates them from Céline Dion is a post-modern sense of cool: no lyrics to make sentiments cheesy, no over-production to earn critical scorn. Because they move slowly, Mono seem more cloaked than Dion. But they drop the hammer just as hard. Most Mono songs have a step-on-the-distortion-pedal moment that raises the emotional stakes. There's nothing wrong with that. Pixies, Nirvana, and Metallica all did it. Mono are better at it than most. ""Better"" is a subjective measure, though. Critics can analyze lyrics and sociocultural impact. But critics are no good with feelings. Explaining why a melody works is expressing the ineffable. (Sure, there's music theory. But V chords resolve to I chords all the time as they should, yet some bands do it better than others.) Most of the time, Mono's melodies work. That's why thousands flock to Mono shows and often cry there. Crying, of course, is the end of rational thought.</p>
<p><i>Hymn to the Immortal Wind</i> has probably caused floods of tears. That's a description, not a dis. The melodies are more sure-handed than ever. They are like missiles locked onto emotional buttons. More independence in the guitars helps sharpen this aim. The rhythm guitar often complements the lead guitar with counter-melodies, instead of merely shadowing it. Also, the band hired a chamber orchestra this time. Mono have augmented their sound in the past with small string ensembles. But now strings are all over the place, making everything bigger, lusher, and weepier. This is a mixed blessing. On one hand, the band has lost whatever skeletal veneer it had. In the past, with just two guitars, bass, and drums, it maintained some mystery before distortion pedal moments. Now it's filled in all its cracks. But, boy, do the strings amp things up. ""Everlasting Light"" is a good old-fashioned piano ballad that mushrooms to a <i>Titanic</i>-sized finale. Ms. Dion would be jealous. It's emotional manipulation of the highest order -- and that's OK. Surrendering to it is called ""enjoying music.""</p></div>"|13341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13341-hymn-to-the-immortal-wind/|7.0|Cosmo Lee

Whether the war's happening in Vietnam or Iraq, garage-rock is essentially the musical equivalent of a superhero comic book-- it transforms shy, socially awkward young men into fuzzbox-stomping, skirt-chasing, government-overthrowing revolutionaries. The mostly failed attempts in the early part of this decade to reposition the music as a marketable hipster commodity overlooked this fundamental quality-- garage-rock is not a music for the masses; it's the private, fantastical domain of misfits.</p>
<p>And in that sense, Austin, Texas, quartet the Strange Boys come just as advertised, coming on like the kids who sit in the back of the class and would gladly sign up for another hour of detention because it at least gives them something to look forward to. The <i>Nuggets</i>-vintage rudiments are all in place on <i>Girls Club</i>: maximized R&amp;B rhythms and bright Rickenbacker strums; trebly, AM-radio-quality production (making them a natural In the Red addition); and, in frontman Ryan Sambol, a suitably nasal mouthpiece who suggests a young Bob Dylan had he spent more of his formative years in juvie halls than coffeehouses. But the Strange Boys' debut is notable for what it doesn't do-- though their songs are rife with references to guns, death, and terrorism, the Strange Boys do not behave like angry young men railing against the indignities of our time. They're just a little worried and confused, maintaining a steady, roadhouse-blues beat indicative of a band just trying to keep their shit together as the world around them seems to come apart. This sense of uncertainty is perfectly embodied by Sambol, who doesn't know whether he should get fucked up or join a militia-- as he wails on ""They're Building the Death Camps"": ""I'm scared because no one else around me seems scared/ I'd buy a gun and be prepared.""</p>
<p>That the Strange Boys never actually blow their tops may prove a liability for garage-rock heads looking for more fierce, swift kicks, especially over the course of a 16-track album that would benefit from a few edits; straightforward bluesy shuffles like ""Who Needs Who More"" and ""Probation Blues"" sound like they would hit a lot harder in a live setting than the tempered, lo-fi presentation they're given here. But the Strange Boys are the kind of band that seem weirder and more threatening the nicer they play it, drawing us closer into Sambol's peculiar psyche: ""Should Have Shot Paul"" is a memo to Mark David Chapman delivered in a jaunty jangle and high-pitched harmonies, and within the graceful, Greenwich Village folk-rock of ""Then"", Sambol casually recounts the U.S. government's involvement in 9/11 as if it were received wisdom. Even his most graceful, open-hearted songs-- the swooning ""No Way for a Slave to Behave"" and the standout soul strut ""A Man You've Never Known""-- carry a whiff of misanthropy. ""Please understand,"" Sambol sings on the latter track, ""it's my job to write songs/ Allow me to do whatever I want."" And that is why generations of young men keep going back to the garage-- it's the only place in this world you can do just that.</p></div>"|13280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13280-the-strange-boys-and-girls-club/|7.1|Stuart Berman

One can hear traces of Tortoise and Godspeed You! Black Emperor in their sound, and there's an aesthetic and structural seriousness to how they present themselves on record. Take last year's mostly very good <i>59.59</i>, which featured time-stamped instrumental intermissions separating each batch of its rock-leaning tracks. As pretentious as that may have seemed, it was also a convenient way for the group to divide its avant-garde material from its more straightforward pop songs. On their latest album, the less accessible and stylistically varied <i>Troubled, Shaken Etc.</i>, Sian Alice Group look to combine those approaches in a more seamless manner.</p>
<p>The desire here to more fully incorporate the experimental-- heard in the record's deeper explorations of free jazz, krautrock, and swirling instrumental passages-- makes for a far more ambitious outing than its predecessor. <i>Troubled, Shaken Etc.</i> eschews verse-chorus-verse structures, hooks, and easy melodies, and generally seems to ignore the fact that the attention span of today's listener is growing ever shorter. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with that-- and, heck, mp3-length focus is nothing to be proud of-- but there's an aloofness at play here that makes the album difficult to penetrate. Part of the reason is that Sian Alice Group tend to sound best at their most straightforward, and <i>Troubled, Shaken Etc.</i> excels during its simpler moments.</p>
<p>It takes some time to get there, but the record finds its footing on ominous rock tracks such as ""Close to the Ground"", where frontwoman Sian Ahern's commanding vocals sit upfront in the mix and play off the foreboding arrangements behind them. A similar approach works on ""The Low Lights"", a fairly uncomplicated pop-rock number with rolling percussion and Ahern at her most vocally charming. And while I wouldn't mind if a few of the record's vocal-less cuts and slow dirges didn't make the final pressing, ""Longstrakt"" (note the ""k"" for krautrock!), repetitive and drum-heavy with blippy keyboard embellishments, is a welcome addition. Moments like these show a band versatile enough to work comfortably within several genres, but the record's low-energy moments elsewhere draw away from some of this success.</p>
<p><i>Troubled, Shaken Etc.</i> has a tendency to fall back on the morose, and tracks such as ""Grow Again, Repeat"" and ""To Thine Own Self Be True"", which are nearly funereal in tone, lack a certain spark that keeps me away from the ""back"" button. Ultimately this is a question of taste-- and plenty of folks like their music slow-moving and somber-- but the general avoidance of rhythm on some of these cuts poses a problem for me. It's a bit like the middle section of Grizzly Bear's recent <i>Veckatimest</i>, where the album just seems to be aching for a bit more soul. Of course, Sian Alice Group are a British avant-rock act and this brand of grave studiousness is sort of their calling card, so it would be silly to expect, say, a funk record the next time around. But I do think that a general loosening of the reins would go a long way.</p></div>"|13283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13283-troubled-shaken-etc/|6.1|Joe Colly

<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Fuck the guitars,"" blurts the anonymous author of the liner notes for <i>History of the Units</i>. ""I was sick of the sameness, the lack of choice. I wanted to start my own game."" Lofty goals to be sure, and perhaps an exaggeration of this San Francisco band's accomplishments. It's debatable whether their rejection of guitars in favor of synths in the late 1970s actually broke molds (though their habit of cutting guitar shapes out of plywood and smashing them at shows was certainly novel).<i> </i>But it's also not very important. What matters is the energy and commitment the Units brought to their electro-futurist post-punk.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Whether doling out tight melodies, atmospheric instrumentals, or freer experiments, the Units attacked everything with an intensity that matched their sloganeering. On <i>History of the Units-- </i>a collection of singles, demos, and tracks from their debut LP <i>Digital Stimulation</i>-- their synths don't sound like guitars, but they pack as much sonic punch as any six-string. And their lyrical warnings about conformity and materialism-- ""This is a generation of cannibals!"" they sing in the pounding ""Cannibals""-- come in a monotone bark, mimicking what they saw as a society of unthinking robots.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Listening 30 years after the fact, you might think the Units were mimicking something more specific-- Devo. The vocal similarities are undeniable, and certain songs could've been written by either group. Take ""Bugboy"", a stuttering tune about a kid who ""liked to torture bugs"" that's like a parallel version of ""Mongoloid"". But the Units happened at the same time thousands of miles away, so it's doubtful that there was much cross-influence. Besides, their sci-fi synths were more forward-looking. Often it sounds like they knew video games were right around the corner, and were crafting potential soundtracks.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But the best Units songs push the hypnosis of synth-loops into the realm of irresistible melody. ""High Pressure Days"" marries a scratchy beat to cautions about the isolating influence of technology. ""We're all moving pretty fast these days,"" they chant. ""It's awful hard to hang onto each other... exchange phone numbers, wither away."" The chugging ""i Night"" sounds like the Advantage playing protest punk, while ""Digital Stimulation"" evokes Theremin-happy horror films. The group could stretch out too-- check ""East West 2"", whose lo-fi bleeps sound like a Raymond Scott experiment, or ""I-5"", whose polyrhythms conjure visions of Brian Eno honing the group's worldly leanings the way he did with Talking Heads. That kind of diversity makes <i>History of the Units </i>more than a sliver of post-punk history. It's the kind of reissue that makes you wonder why the music was ever out of print.</p>

In Blur's case, the band's four original members have recorded exactly three new songs together this decade, and despite a recent run of successful reunion shows in the UK, they announced last week that they'd not be making new music as a quartet anytime soon.</p>
<p>And judging by the tracklisting, they could have called this <i>Midlife Crisis</i>, as the compilation-- which eschews many of the group's biggest hits and best-known songs for album tracks-- finds them attempting to reshape their identity, reaching for the dronier, artier end of their catalog. As a bonus then, this comp actually serves a pair of actual purposes: To give new listeners interested in the group as an artistic rather than commercial force a nice, career-spanning entry point, and to give those only familiar with the band through its hits (as collected on 2000's <i>Best of Blur</i> or, if you're in Europe, heard on the radio throughout the 1990s) a deeper and wider look at its work.</p>
<p>Still, the first thing any fan will notice is what's missing: Eight of the 18 songs from <i>Best Of</i> have been axed, including key singles ""Country House"", ""There's No Other Way"", ""On Your Own"", ""End of a Century"", and ""To the End""-- the latter two most likely so the 25-song set doesn't repeat too much of Blur's biggest album, <i>Parklife</i>. Chirpy third-tier singles ""Charmless Man"", ""Bang"", and ""Sunday Sunday"" are also absent but unmissed.</p>
<p>So this compilation can be seen as a more Americentric look at Blur's career, which makes some sense as they still have a lot of fanbase growth potential in the States. Few bands from the 90s increased their stature this decade among America's self-identifying indie set as much as Blur-- and this at a time when, thanks to globalization and the internet, the caché of romanticizing other nations as exotic or different largely dwindled. Anglophilia in the States was once the province of those willing to take the time and effort to look outside their immediate surroundings, and with that came the attendant feelings of acting or thinking differently from one's peers that often fuels cultural choices, especially in indie circles. Nowadays, the UK feels and acts a hell of a lot more like, well, the U.S., and the internet has made the practice of looking in on a band from Britain the same as checking out one from Brooklyn. So while it's no surprise that Blur have become more central to American indie listeners' lives this decade, it's not due to intensifying their position wthin niches and subcultures but simply drawing in larger numbers of people.</p>
<p>Blur leader Damon Albarn certainly embraced his Anglo nature at a few junctures in his career-- particularly after a 44-date, morale-sapping 1992 trek around America supporting the warmed-over Madchester of their debut LP, <i>Leisure.</i> The tour left the group frayed and, above all, determined to reject the dour earnestness of grunge. At the same time, Suede became the darlings of London indie by exaggerating many of the basic tenants of British guitar pop-- wit, glamour, artifice. In short, everything grunge wasn't.</p>
<p>With their distaste for America sharpened, Blur played along, going all in on what was soon to be called Britpop, starting with their second full-length, <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish-- the first of three albums in a so-called British trilogy that also included 1994's <i>Parklife</i> and 1995's <i>The Great Escape</i>. Fully embracing the UK's art-pop history, Blur's London- and UK-centric records made them superstars. Less celebratory than they at first seem, these records are teeming with despair and dripping with disdain. From Phil Daniels' title-track monologue to discouraging traffic reports to suicidal thoughts on the Cliffs of Dover, all was not well.</i></p>
<p><i>Parklife</i>'s low point is also the band's artistic peak: The tempestuous, atmospheric ""This Is a Low"", with Albarn's reading of the English shipping report over Coxon's backward guitar was an admission that this once-dominant island nation was increasingly sheltered and inward. There is a sort of spectral finisterre quality to the song's tracing the outline of England by boat, and because those shipping reports-- news from the end of the world-- used to sign off the BBC's nightly radio broadcasts, the song almost sounds as if it could be the nation's lullaby. The sun once never set on the British Empire; this song seems to indicate that it now did so nightly-- in a haze of depression and doubt.</p>
<p>It's fitting then that <i>Midlife</i> includes not only the celebratory (""For Tomorrow""), the heavily Anglo-coded (""Parklife""), and the snarky (""Girls &amp; Boys""), but also ""This Is a Low"" and other nods to the diversity of these albums, chief among them <i>The Great Escape</i>'s ""He Thought of Cars"" (arguably their most underrated song), <i>Modern Life</i>'s ""Blue Jeans"" (a paean to mundanity) and ""Advert"" (like ""Girls &amp; Boys"", a riff on consumer and leisure culture), and <i>Parklife</i>'s ""Badhead"" (an odd substitute here for the record's more well-known relationship-splitting soundtrack, ""To the End"").</p>
<p>Despite the cravenness with which it seemed Blur-- Albarn and bassist Alex James, in particular-- sought and reveled in fame, this portion of their career is dominated by songs about pre-millennial tension, the dangers of conspicuous consumption, and social changes regarding shifts in technology and communication. In retrospect these prescient sentiments are the strongest and most compelling threads of their mid-90s work; rather than celebrate Britain with knees-up Mockneyisms, they often painted real warnings about a nation quickly being engulfed in obsessions with consumer and celebrity culture. In the years after World War II, America's exportation of such culture was seen as powerful, endearing, the sign of an emergent nation that would dominate the second half of the century as Britain once did. By the 90s, however, Blur had correctly identified the U.S./UK axis as perpetually spoiled and distracted and these themes often dominated their songs. But without the moaning and brooding of peers like Radiohead, Tricky, or Pulp, the messages were often glossed over.</p>
<p>Stardom, it turned out, left Blur fractured, with Coxon-- a riot grrrl devotee and dyed-in-the-wool indie kid-- particularly adrift. His torment was poked at by his more jovial bandmate Alex James, who offered jokes like, ""What's 50 ft. long and has no pubic hair? The front row of a Blur concert."" By the time the group needed to film a video for late 1995 single ""The Universal"" (also included here), the promo couldn't even hide Coxon's dissatisfaction-- in almost every shot he is absent, sitting on the ground, or barely participating.</p>
<p>Rather than split the group, Coxon's sensibilities instead found root in the band's music, and their next two albums-- 1997's <i>Blur</i> and 1999's <i>13-- </i>ironically displayed an increased interest in lo-fi and other strands of American indie music, as well as totems of 1970s art-pop such as dub, krautrock, even free jazz and prog. And it was during these years that Blur's fame and reputation in the U.S. swelled, thanks to the endearing ""Coffee &amp; TV"" video and the arena sports-ready ""Song 2"". (Mythbuster: Despite Blur being commonly called U.S. one-hit wonders, ""Song 2"" was the third-highest charting single of their career here, behind ""There's No Other Way"" and ""Girls &amp; Boys"".)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those LPs are sparsely represented here, however. The two big moments listed above, the gospel-tinged global hit ""Tender"", and UK No. 1 ""Beetlebum"" are present as expected, but beyond that group only two additional songs from each album are included-- the best of which are ""Trimm Trabb"", an excellent example of <i>13</i>'s engaging sprawl, and <i>Blur</i>'s ""Death of a Party"", which now sounds like a proto-Gorillaz song.</p>
<p>Early in the recording of 2003 LP <i>Think Tank</i>, Coxon finally left the band. The resulting record finds Blur in a strange space-- neutered without their primary instrumental force, caught between their pop impulses and Albarn's growing embrace of non-Western sounds, and generally disturbed over the Bush/Blair administrations' failures. Three songs here make the cut, highlighted-- not surprisingly-- by Coxon's sole contribution, ""Battery in Your Leg"".</p>
<p>With hindsight, it's no surprise that Blur's star has shone so brightly again this decade in their absence. Despite the cries about careerism, they rarely settled into one spot for long, and even when they were correctly perceived to have done so-- about one half of <i>The Great Escape</i> really is a <i>Parklife</i> retread-- they were still spreading their collective wings on album tracks and B-sides. (Indeed, the great irony of Blur's second decade is that Albarn, once the prince of Britpop, has spent the past 10 years becoming a 21st century David Byrne, a sharp, respectful pan-global figure through which many U.S. and UK listeners have stepped into multiple strains of African music, Arabic music, Jamaican music-- even Chinese opera.) Whether or not they continue to tour, record again, or really are calling it quits this time, the distance between their years of tabloid fame (and sometimes punchable ubiquity in the UK) and today has stripped away a lot of preening and the press and left their legacy enriched only by their music. Unlike a lot of rock's image-conscious genre-hoppers that music is sturdy, sometimes whipsmart, and endowed with more cracks and crevices and corners in which listeners can become lost than they're often given credit.</p></div>"|13168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13168-midlife-a-beginners-guide-to-blur/|9.4|Scott Plagenhoef

Three years on, it's hard to imagine there's much of an appetite for any new music that sounds like Boards of Canada that isn't actually, you know, <i>by</i> Boards of Canada-- so what next for the 25-year-old Fake?</span></p>
<p>The answer, as it turns out, lies with his earlier EPs. Fake may have won psych-IDM accolades for the woozy swathes of noise highlighted by James Holden's seminal refit of ""The Sky Was Pink"" (for my money, one of the best 10 remixes of the decade), but his output before that was significantly more rhythm-obsessed. From 2003's unabashedly banging ""Outhouse"" to the more pointillist techno of 2005's ""Dinamo"", his initial string of 7""s and 12""s put an emphasis on the low-end that his post-""Pink"" work pretty much ignored.</p>
<p>On his second full-length, <i>Hard Islands</i>, Fake addresses the what-next problem by shifting his primary focus back to the rhythm section and scaling the immensity of his sound back to something substantially less unruly. If the serrated minimal of opener ""The Turtle"" isn't enough to convince you of his re-prioritization, consider how this LP title plays off the last; this is a record that sounds, in all senses of the phrase, more grounded.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say that Fake's best trick (which involves a slowly deployed swathe of noise and feedback) has been retired altogether, just that he's learned to integrate it better. Beginning with a sharply minimal pulse and ending with a cacophony of flanged and reverbed organ pads, the aforementioned ""The Turtle"" is probably the album's single best example of that. Elsewhere, ""Basic Mountain"" marries a thumping minimal line with a detuned organ sound to similar effect, while album centerpiece ""Castle Rising"" bubbles with an acid-inspired synth line and a tech house-grounded rhythm. Meanwhile, with their scattershot rhythms, funhouse mirror melodies, and decaying synth leads, ""Narrier"" and ""Fentiger"" recall AFX's early day bubblebaths.</p>
<p>If there's anything disappointing about <i>Hard Islands</i>, it's the sheer lack of material. With only six songs on offer-- one of which is a 75-second interlude called ""The Curlew""-- it's hard to feel like this is the assertive, confident statement Fake has it in him to make. As a strategic move out from the ghetto of nostalgic IDM Nowheresville, though, it'll suit just fine.</p></div>"|13043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13043-hard-islands/|6.2|Mark Pytlik

Its brittle, monstrous tones shake whatever space they enter. Riffs coil, shatter, and splinter into notes that disperse like buckshot. Words trade mythology for purely imagistic hatred. You could imagine Khanate pushing some feeble soul over the edge.</p>
<p>This was true of Khanate on their previous LPs, but <i>Clean Hands Go Foul-- </i>which the band recorded in 2005 before breaking up in 2006-- ups the aggression until it feels like a score for nervous breakdowns and wanton rampages. Khanate once found a riff and marched behind it, cutting it open and bleeding it until but a din of feedback or a vortex of noise remained. <i>Clean Hands</i> doesn't worry so much for the riff or the rhythms, though. Instead, it aims directly for the blood, or the sense that these songs are for, well, ending the world. Cuddly stuff, really.</p>
<p>The world's full of misanthropic and menacing music, but Khanate exist within a fairly isolated subset for their sonic, structural, and thematic instability. First, Stephen O'Malley, Alan Dubin, James Plotkin, and Tim Wyskida rarely cloak their implements of aggression. The lyrics share a pristine space with the monolithic guitar, drums, and bass, and Dubin crawls in front or slinks in the back as the moment demands. His piercing voice never needed much manipulation to be convincing, so most every word rings loud and clear. That is, when he opens the album screaming, ""It went down bad, and it's a sad life/ When angels break so easily,"" his clear words don't need much context, though those machete-shaped guitars behind him don't hurt. Or, on the sporadically escalating, painfully patient 33-minute closer, ""Every God Damn Thing"", you understand Dubin when he moans, ""Out there, someone's dying/ Hopefully/ It should be all of them/ I'

d step on them if I could."" Especially in extreme forms like metal, noise, and industrial music, bands often cloak their darkest thoughts in walls of distortion or the clangor of the surrounding instruments. Think about how many black metal lyrics you've easily picked out, or how many power electronics ideas you've spotted without liner notes. Khanate demand you intellectualize their verbal despair in real-time. And just in case you can't, the lyrics are reprinted in plain text.</p>
<p>Khanate have always done that, though. What makes <i>Clean Hands Go Foul</i> the quartet's most menacing but intriguing effort ever is its new propensity for misdirection. Khanate don't push like metal, pull like drone, or raze like noise. Rather, it does all of those things in fitfully unpredictable fashion. Indeed, what's perhaps most frustrating about the band's break-up is, by this session, they'd become perfectionists in torturing by teasing. If not improved, their musicianship had certainly become more interesting. Tim Wyskida, for instance, used to lash at the backs of his bandmates, moving in obsequy. But here he gallivants with a heavy jazz freedom, suggesting Sunny Murray's roaming mind in Chris Hakius' powerful frame. Again on ""Wings From Spine"", Wyskida avoids any semblance of pattern. He trips through the kit, spinning cymbals around, slapping and silencing them in a single second. ""In That Corner"" continually approaches a groove, but the beat keeps splitting apart at the seams. The drums spill between the bass crests, and the guitar zips off in the opposite direction. Beneath its own top-heavy trudge, the track finally collapses. Plotkin's bass looms like a thunderhead, while the disappearing drums and trickling guitar splash against each other like puddles and raindrops.</p>
<p>As sinister and frightening as these tracks might be to newcomers, both Khanate fans and slow-music enthusiasts might want to avoid the last number, the moribund ""Every God Damn Thing"". Before this last bit, <i>Clean Hands </i>is a fine Khanate EP. After ""Every God Damn Thing"", it's a mandatory finale. It's a sign of real Khanate progress right before the dreaded break-up. A fantastic study in the newfound patience of a very loud band that's discovered intensity can also be found in stillness, ""Every God Damn Thing"" presages the mix of acoustic and electric instruments on Sunn O)))'s <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i>. Over 33 minutes, Khanate creep, generating tones to let them dissipate, howling about hell and deformed children to let those thoughts evaporate. Its deliberate movement recalls experimental Japanese electronic music and Derek Bailey's free-form guitar explorations. By the time Khanate hit the 30 minute mark, they're roaring glacially, huge cymbal splashes and rolls splattering against roiling bass and guitar and what might be Dubin's quintessential Khanate statement: ""It's all bad again/ It's all bad/ Get out-- my head.""</p>
<p>Too bad the band, presumably done forever, took that as its credo, too.</p></div>"|13099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13099-clean-hands-go-foul/|7.6|Grayson Currin

Though each cut hovers around the two-minute mark on records like this, they all make a lot more sense in the context of the whole. As we trek deeper into the jungles of ""Long Tail"" music consumption, this kind of structure feels almost brash. We're almost a decade into the ""return of the single"" era, but those who craft and consume albums as front-to-back endeavors-- even those built from fragments-- wear it as a badge of honor, resuscitating that nerdy elitism of eras that championed the impossibility of track-skipping.</p>
<p>Javelin, comprised of New York City crate-rats George Langford and Tom Van Buskirk, certainly do their share of jumping around, never letting their listener get too close to an idea or a groove for very long. <i>Jamz n Jemz</i>, a CD-R they've been distributing at gigs, is flecked with brilliant little vignettes-- almost every one a gem, many of them certifiable jams-- that argue for the notion of a million little pieces coming together to make something much larger. Whether or not <i>Jamz n Jemz</i> achieves this in the way Javelin intended is somewhat moot; from a distance, the 17 ideas presented here aren't terribly cohesive and they certainly don't flow. But a larger statement looms: At a time when most people are DJs, it can be rewarding to simply hit ""Play"" and let the professionals handle it.</p>
<p>David Byrne certainly gets it. His Luaka Bop imprint recently signed Javelin, immediately giving the guys control of the label's podcast to debut their <i>Andean Ocean Tape</i>, a curiously sly concoction of found sounds and nautically dizzying loops and breaks that reference everything from beach-psych to diet-dub, all outfitted with delightfully strange ticks, grumbles, and seagull squawks. <i>Jamz n Jemz</i> has the good sense to dig deeper, exploring sounds even more elemental and dance-ready.</p>
<p>Javelin come over as hardcore cratediggers in the vein of artists like Quiet Village. The knob-twiddling is scarce and utterly unrecognizable amongst the patchwork of dime-store samples (their official band URL is dollarbinsofthefuture.com). It might be dubious to try and pinpoint exactly where and how much work is being put into these cut and paste jobs, but Javelin seem more like puzzle-solvers than puzzle-makers. The mystery only benefits the artistry of stutter-step weirdo hip-hop cuts like ""Susie Cues"" and ""Digits"" (an indictment of poor cellphone etiquette in movie theaters-- Javelin just earned a special place in my heart), whereas more complete and meticulously ""worked"" cuts like ""Oh Centra"" (a terrifically playful bit of 8-bit disco-hop) and the terribly titled ""Lindsay Brohan"" show signs of real musical prowess beyond having way too much fun with an MPC.</p>
<p>Even at its most irreverent (check out the melting Elvis impersonator on ""Like Wood Would"" or the 1970s car chase flick nodding ""The Merkin Jerk (Take Three)""), <i>Jamz n Jemz</i> becomes less and less of an ""idea"" record than a simple celebration of reference, as magnetic opposites marry in the most familiar of ways. At a time when it seems like everyone's roommate is cooking up bargain-bin symphonies, Javelin stand out like two heady chefs, turning canned food classics into tiny little pieces of inspired, inverted gourmet reimaginings.</p></div>"|13317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13317-jamz-n-jemz/|7.4|Zach Kelly

That said, Drug Rug managed to juice a bit of feeling and a couple of pretty great string-benders out of the too-familiar sound on their self-titled debut. It's a fine listen, but it's the kind of record where you could feel as though you were digging on the constituent elements-- Sarah Cronin's voice, the neo-primitive production, the occasional guitar stab-- rather than taking in a fully functioning song at play.</p>
<p>Cronin still gets in a few howls and the occasional mewl, and Drug Rug's songs still have a loose, easygoing charm to them, but you'd be forgiven (and wrong) if you presumed a lineup change prior to the band's sophomore set, <i>Paint the Fence Invisible</i>. Nothing on <i>Drug Rug</i> predicted the bratty, almost Be Your Own Pet-like ""Hannah, Please"" or the New Pornographers-indebted rush of ""Haunting You"", but it's an easy shock to bear; <i>Paint the Fence Invisible</i> is maybe half as weird as its predecessor, but roughly twice as tuneful, and a hell of a lot more fun.</p>
<p>After the shimmering but slight opener, ""Follow"", ""Haunting You"" rushes right out of the gate, buoyed by an insistent guitar chug and Cronin and Tommy Allen's tight harmonies; good as Cronin sounded on her own on <i>Drug Rug</i>, her voice sounds incredible when meshed with Allen's, and it's too bad she doesn't get more mic time here. ""Never Tell"" carries some of the twang over from the first LP but matches it with a steady stomp missing from the comparatively languid debut. There's a buzzy organ at the heart of ""Blue Moon"" that'd fall right into place on a ? and the Mysterians record, while ""Passes On"" has all the thud of Steppenwolf until the recorders drift in. This sonic expansion works in a couple of directions; another record like the debut would've meant a creative flatline, but Drug Rug always feel like a duo, and it's precisely enough ambition and sonic tinkering for two people making their second LP.</p>
<p>One can't help but think of occasional Drug Rug tourmates Dr. Dog when hearing <i>Invisible</i>, a solid power-pop record largely devoid of any influence from the past three decades. Both bands certainly borrow liberally from late-60s production style and song structure, and both are so competent, so adept at placing hooks and solos and such in their ""proper"" place, it can leave you a little cold. But Drug Rug have allowed a bit of the drawl of their early work to carry over here, and even when they're playing it fairly straight, there's something slightly twisted about their melodies; if Dr. Dog are gunning for the Beatles, Drug Rug are going for Country Joe &amp; the Fish-- this time. God knows who they'll sound like next.</p></div>"|13279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13279-paint-the-fence-invisible/|7.1|Paul Thompson

They're friends with Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz) and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour. They live a jetset life traveling between Africa, Europe, and North America to play shows and record. They've made a record with global megastar Manu Chao, and back home in Mali, their son is a successful rapper. By any standard, they've had one heck of a run since 2005's excellent <i>Dimanche à Bamako</i> established them as major world music stars. And they deserved all of it, not only because their music was great, but because they spent nearly three decades earning it. Mariam Doumbia and Amadou Bagayoko met at the Institute for the Young Blind in Bamako in the 1970s and have made music together ever since, first traveling abroad to record in Abidjan, Ivory Coast in the early 90s.</p>
<p>I've heard those early recordings, and they're quite spare, just the two voices and Amadou's mellifluous guitar playing. Even so, the sound they established then is still very much apparent in the maximalist, pan-global pop records they've made recently. They began adding a band in the mid-90s, finally traveling to Europe late in the decade to record. It's this transitional phase, where the duo began to try on a dizzying array of styles and incorporate a broad range of instrumentation, that's covered on <i>The Magic Couple</i>, a sharp retrospective that shows clearly that they didn't arrive at <i>Dimanche </i><i>à</i><i> Bamako</i> and <i>Welcome to Mali</i> by accident. The set draws from three albums, <i>Sou Ni Tile</i>, <i>Tje Ni Mousso</i>, and <i>Wati</i>, recorded from 1997-2001 and released in 1999, 2000, and 2003, respectively. (It has a very different tracklisting from<i> Je Pense à Toi</i>, another A&amp;M best-of released several years ago that covers roughly the same period.)</p>
<p>The tracks of the three LPs are jumbled together in favor of flow, and the period of recording covered here is so distinct and unified that the lack of chronological tracking isn't really a big deal. <i>Wati</i> is only represented by two tracks, but they're clear arrows pointing to their watershed. ""Sarama (La Charmante)"" is generously splattered with tumbling jazz piano, an extremely unusual texture for Malian music, while ""Poulo (Les Peuls)"", a song about an ethnic group from the Sahel region more widely known as the Fulani, has a hyperspace beat that mixes kit drumming, slashing guitar, and traditional flute and stirs. Flute also drives the hard funk of <i>Tje Ni Mousso</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s</span><i> </i>""Beki Miri"", a song that finds Amadou leaning on his wah pedal as he and Mariam sing in unison.</p>
<p><i>Tje Ni Mousso </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">is the funkiest of the three albums drawn from here, and it produces what might be the compilation highlight in ""Chantez-Chantez"". The song is an interstellar Afrofunk jam, riding a heavy, sped-up ""Green Onions"" groove from Mali to Memphis and back. Amadou reels off a brilliant guitar solo that's enough to make me a little sad that his guitar has been relatively played down on their last two albums. At the other end of the spectrum is ""Je Pense a Toi"", one of the duo's most stunningly gorgeous songs. The couple sings its way in and out of harmony over simple hand percussion while Amadou's snaking guitar trades leads with a cello played in a mixture of Arabic and European styles.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;""><i>The Magic Couple</i> is a good overview of the middle period of Amadou &amp; Mariam's recording career, and should serve a lot of listeners who got on board with <i>Dimanche</i> or <i>Welcome</i> quite well. If you like Amadou's guitar work, you'll be happy to hear a lot more of it right out front here than on their two most well-known albums. If you're very into the group's sound, you might do better to skip past this and simply pick up all three albums-- they're still available, and they're all very solid. If all you need is the overview, though, this will do the trick.</span></p></div>"|13343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13343-the-magic-couple/|8.0|Joe Tangari

The revival of old-school funk and soul sounds that began with Desco Records in New York and bands like Germany's Poets of Rhythm in the 1990s has produced a lot of fantastic throwback music, some of which stands right alongside the real thing from the late 60s and early 70s. Sharon Jones may be the queen of American revivalist soul, but what's easy to forget is that Jones was discovered by Phillip Lehman and Gabriel Roth singing backup for Fields on a session in the mid-90s. Fields cut his first 45 in 1969, a series of follow-ups on tiny labels in the 70s, then recorded an album in 1979 before disappearing for most of the 80s. He recorded a few albums for Ace in the 90s before landing at Desco and its offspring, Daptone and Soul Fire.</p>
<p>Now he's with Truth &amp; Soul, and that crew, led by Leon (aka El) Michels, has helped him create one smoking mother of an old-sound soul record. There's a subtle hint of hip-hop in this brand of deep soul, but for the most part, it sounds like something that easily could have come out of some imaginary mid-point between Stax, Muscle Shoals, and Philadelphia International in about 1971. A few of the Southern-style ballads on <i>My World</i> are simply stunning, especially ""Honey Dove"". This is at least the third time he's recorded the song, and this version is a total bomb-- Fields sweats through every second as the guitar channels Steve Cropper, horns and a small string section drift through the languid rhythm, and Homer Steinweiss lays down a perfectly understated and sharp drum part.</p>
<p>Steinweiss and the rest of the Expressions clearly feel this music and don't sound like mere imitators. They serve up an inventive arrangement on the moralistic funk track ""Money I$ King"", which is essentially through-composed-- the horns constantly shift, working up to a dissonant finale. The haunting backing vocals, bells, and shivering strings that color the cover of the Supremes' ""My World Is Empty Without You"" show a lot of imagination and a willingness to interpret a stone classic rather than simply parroting it. ""Love Comes and Goes"", with its big harmony vocal on the chorus, also takes the form out of its box a little.</p>
<p>Fields has been sampled a number of times by hip-hop artists, and he and the Expressions seem to invite another heist on the title track, offering up a tasty drum break and a supremely moody rhythm track that drips with vibraphone and pitch-black guitar. Even the instrumental ""Expressions Theme"" is solid, playing like a descendant of Young-Holt Unlimited's ""Soulful Strut"" and Willie Mitchell's solo LPs for Hi. For about 40 minutes, <i>My World</i> is like taking a trip back almost five decades. It loses a bit of steam at the end, but if there was any doubt Fields was still the real deal 40 years after his first record, this should obliterate it. <i>My World</i> is a throwback done right.</p></div>"|13333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13333-my-world/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Narrated by a graybeard music professor and featuring cameos from collaborators like Feist, Jamie Lidell, and Gonzales, it's a clever conceit brilliantly executed, and probably deserving of some sort of prize, if there's anything like a Grammy for best online EPK.</p>
<p>But such a jokey angle doesn't really doesn't do justice to the album. Mocky (Toronto's Dominic Solale, long based in Berlin) isn't so much chameleonic as exceptionally versatile, as he's shown again and again as a songwriter, arranger, backup musician, and producer for the likes of Feist, Lidell, and Jane Birkin. (It's hard to think of any other musician that's worked with both Kevin Blechdom and Nikka Costa.) Reflecting the broad pop sensibilities of those collaborations, <i>Saskamodie</i> ditches the quirky electro-funk of previous Mocky albums in favor of acoustic instrumentation and lilting songs in the spirit of 60s lounge jazz and easy-listening soul.</p>
<p>Mocky and his accomplices recorded the album in two weeks at Paris' Ferber Studios, the site of classic recordings by Nina Simone and Serge Gainsbourg. He paid for the sessions out of the winnings of a lawsuit against an Austrian supermarket chain that had used his music without permission, a detail that might seem extraneous if it weren't so metaphorically fitting, Mocky weaving contemporary free-market capitalism's dross into golden shapes evocative of a simpler, but also more ambitious, musical era. <i>Saskamodie</i> isn't, by any stretch of the imagination, a ""challenging"" record. Around a traditional jazz rhythm section, the diffuse strings, glockenspiels, and woodwinds carry a whiff of lite-FM. Tempo and timbre both favor lullaby moods; melodic riffs laze and lilt, shadowed by harmonies as dulcet as they come.</p>
<p><i>Saskamodie</i> is an exceptionally intimate album, the product of a close-knit group effacing their own egos behind the ghosts lingering in their chosen studio. Mocky, who has a wonderfully warm, throaty voice, nestles his singing in amongst the instrumental tracks, rarely letting lyrics assume center stage. You might not even notice Feist's contribution, which peeks over the mix's horizon in faint close harmony. ""Music to My Ears"" features Lidell but forgoes words entirely, with rounded syllables stepping in unison with piano and bass. Indeed, it might take some close listening before you realize that many of the album's vocal tracks are wordless. Even ""Birds of a Feather"" (featuring Gonzales and Joel Gibb), one of the record's few songs with actual lyrics, carries the refrain with a chorus of whistling. But instead of coming off as kitsch, it's one of the album's most innocent and compelling moments, summing up the whole question of musical expression with childlike simplicity.</p>
<p>Couched in yielding textures and hushed tones, the album might initially come off as slight. The easy-listening touches are loaded signifiers, after all, and a kind of critical shutdown is a not-inconceivable response. This ain't Battles, but it also isn't fluff. It took me some time-- a few weeks of listening, followed by a month spent away from the album-- for me to hear beyond the airy sonics and allow the full weight of the songwriting and arrangements to sink in. When they do, you'll be struck by <i>Saskamodie</i>'s wit and grace. It's an inspired, giving album whose generosity is masked by its easygoing veneer. It's an exceptionally <i>musical</i> album-- there's no other word for it-- that could fail to seduce only the hardest of hearing, or the hardest of hearts.</p>

But Kiila, one of the only Fonal bands who occasionally flirt with English (their debut album: <i>Heartcore</i>), might be close: <i>Tuota Tuota</i>, the band's third album, trades in lush, North-country arrangements and silvery group chants. You can probably still count the truly coherent pop moments on one hand, but the fact that you can count them at all places <i>Tuota Tuot</i>a squarely on Fonal's skinny axis of accessibility.</p>
<p>Faust have long been considered the most bucolic of the Krautrockers, famously recording their albums in an old schoolhouse; Kiila aim for that sprawl on <i>Tuota Tuota</i> (""Well Well""), the six-strong troupe extending their many limbs over all manner of countryside tremble. Kiila unsurprisingly trade in European traditions, echoing the shapeshifting Incredible String Band, the elegant hum of John Martyn, or the accumulating stir of Peter Brötzmann and so many other free improv stalwarts. An intimidating list of influence, maybe, but Kiila rarely strain or stumble on <i>Tuota Tuota</i>. Opening hymn ""Viisi Hirvasta"" is as careful and reverent as anything the band has put to tape. Simple acoustic guitar lines mix with surface stirring until, three minutes later, a strident fiddle grabs the song by its collar, if only for a moment, and shakes some clarity out of it.</p>
<p>That same fiddle announces the purposeful, rock-land gait of ""Kevätlaulu"", which Kiila proceed to rollick through for three no-fat minutes. This sort of between-tracks interplay benefits <i>Tuota Tuota</i>, whose seven tracks alternate between short and peppy and long and winding; it even spins like one of those old Faust albums. The affair is more strung-together and traceable than 2004's <i>Silmät Sulkaset</i>, which saw Kiila falling more in line with Fonal's reputation for untenable forest children. The contrasts are heartfelt and charming, if occasionally jarring: Moments after ""Niin Kuin Puut"" delivers the album's most tender country paean, ""Kehotuslaulu"" proposes to build an entire song out of a fiddle breakdown. It is fun music in a decidedly un-fun realm (Finnish-language experimental music), and even when Kiila return to softer compositions, <i>Tuota Tuota</i> retains an air of parlor-room conversation.</p>
<p>The final six minutes-- devoted to ""Pöllötulkin Mietteet"", which charges downhill on strangely phasing funk guitars, wildman organ and ornery trumpeting-- provide a strange end to an album mostly intent on crafting homey, wooden revelries. But Kiila never ask you to gulp down their sprawl: the jamming is modest, the songcraft repeatable and molded. <i>Tuota Tuota</i> joyfully balances the band's experimental tendencies with tender, aged songcraft. <i>Tuota Tuota</i> is friendly skree for the intimidated.</p></div>"|13140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13140-tuota-tuota/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

At least that's the impression he leaves listening to <i>Arecibo Message</i>: a man who's studied the past 20 years of electronic music with a historian's eye for exacting detail, if not exactly an innovator's need to prod unexpected pleasure centers. The rhythmic choices, springing from Boxcutter's previous work, make this music dubstep, at least nominally. But very little about the album otherwise points to any of the London bass-centric subgenre's current stylsitic conceits, save perhaps a sonic palette that tends toward the days of repurposed Atari 2600 SFX set to a beat. <i>Arecibo Message</i> reflects a longer and stronger lineage, one that starts well before FWD&gt;&gt; opened its doors or South Londoners began siphoning the estrogen from two-step.</p>
<p>And so for the most part we get a mash note, in the form of non-referential homage, to the housebound geniuses who left their rainbow-tinted fingerprints all over white label buyers' expectations in a post-acid world. The boogie b-line and retro-brittle handclaps on ""S p a c e b a s s"" are the breakdance-friendly roots of all those hip-hop import fiends whose spastic enthusiasm for shuddering synthetic beats would have them dubbed ""I.D.M."" a few years later. Likewise, ""Free House Acid"" is yet another attempt to make overlapping quasi-acidic bleeps harmonize like dueling opera singers in a Chuck Jones cartoon. And for every fleet slice of dark, swinging neo-garage (like ""Mya Rave v2""), there's something like the title track, which splits the difference between the stiff-limbed early days of Warp Records and the label's convoluted second wave, rigid LFO suddenly nipped and tucked a thousand times over into something closer to Autechre.</p>
<p>Two things keep Boxcutter's latest from the tedium of unchecked nostalgia for sounds which never left us long enough to be missed. One, the garage-ish tempos mean all that acidic filigree never gets overbearing the way it can when combined with the ""look ma, no brakes"" programming that's the bane of Boxcutter's post-drill'n'bass peers. And two, he's wedded to neither the sound of 1989 or 1999; curveballs like the slanted J Dilla funk of ""A Cosmic Parent"" keep <i>Arecibo Message</i> from simply being a experiment in bleeding one rave era into another. Still, most of the album is throwback enough to be a pleasant one-off, not so much a work of fevered straining at a genre's edges so much as a well-crafted nod to the O.G.'s of Brit bleeping, made with grace and a smile. And if you've been lamenting a lack of hairy electro-tinged riffage in your life, here's a quick re-up.</p></div>"|13139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13139-arecibo-message/|6.0|Jess Harvell

Not because a rising lo-fi rocker acted stupidly-- who doesn't sometimes?-- but because I'd always imagined being on ecstasy in Barcelona would be a lot more fun. After all, some of the most rewarding music from the last couple of years basically promised as much. Or was Swedish imprint Sincerely Yours being insincere? How about U.S. labels True Panther and Underwater Peoples? From Oslo to Melbourne, from indie rockers to club kids, sunny electronic euphoria has been one of the late-2000s pop underground's richest musical nodes.</p>
<p>Just as that endless blissed-out summery vibe unites everyone from Panda Bear to Todd Terje, Barcelona electro-pop four-piece Delorean pull up at the intersection between several disparate and exciting movements. Start with their remixes: In the U.S., the bedroom pop of Glasser and disco-punk of Lemonade; in the UK, the <i>NME</i>-approved guitar rock of the Big Pink and Mystery Jets; and, right in Delorean's hometown, the sample-heavy tropical psych of El Guincho. They can be as airy and suave as Air France or Phoenix, but their unremitting beats are also plenty huge enough to convert fans of Cut Copy or MGMT. John Talabot, a Barcelona DJ who's released cosmic disco grooves for Munich label Permanent Vacation, lends a house remix to the group's current EP, <i>Ayrton Senna</i>.</p>
<p>The third release on Fool House, the new label from French indie-dance blog Fluo Kids, <i>Ayrton Senna</i> represents a similar kind of convergence. In the early 2000s, Delorean originally set out to be something like Jimmy Eat World crossed with Elliott Smith, keyboardist Unai Lazcano confided to <i>The Pop Manifesto</i> magazine last summer. By the time of their promising <i>Transatlantic KK </i>album a couple of years ago, Delorean had absorbed the synth-pop sleekness of New Order and the echoey guitar spikes of post-punk revivalists like !!! or the Rapture, with one transcendent moment: so-called ""breakhop"" finale ""Apocalypse Ghetto Blast"". On the <i>Ayrton Senna</i> EP, the group's burgeoning dance-pop savvy comes into bloom with three unstoppable summer bangers, the Talabot remix, and a digital-only bonus cut.</p>
<p>Despite their rock roots, Delorean do tracks, not songs. Singer/bassist Ekhi Lopetegi is a Ph.D. candidate with a background in philosophy, but Delorean use his Factory-ready yelp more as just another element to loop than as a vehicle for delivering lyrical content. ""Seasun"" is the best example of Delorean's layered approach to composition, methodically building 1990s piano-house keyboards, disembodied female vocals, Baltimore club-ready handclaps, and a ringing guitar line into the ultimate beach house (not Beach House). But ""Deli"", with its breakbeats and youthful enthusiasm, and ""Moonson"", all 90s-house liberation and anthem-rock yearning, are almost as thrilling. Talabot's ""Kids &amp; Drum"" remix of ""Seasun"" could well hold up after even more listens than the original version, its hand-percussion samples reaching closer to the islands but its vast, clean lines stretching out toward space.</p>
<p>Prior to <i>Ayrton Senna</i>, arguably Delorean's most compelling release was its remix for oft-misunderstood electro-pop Serge Gainsbourgs the Teenagers. On last year's occasionally brilliant <i>Reality Check</i>, the French band's ""Love No"" is a hilarious, sleazy, and brutally scathing snipe at a nagging girlfriend who disapproves of the narrator's self-absorbed internet stonerdom. Delorean's bass-heavy ""No Love"" version-- like Studio's ""Possible"" rework of the Shout Out Louds' ""Impossible"", only more dramatic-- strips away all the negative lyrics, ditching a chorus of ""I'm not in love"" and instead repeating the big question: ""Are you in love?"" Well, that's a hell of a thing for a pop song to ask. The track promises dancefloor absolution, only to nag at the heart in a way the Teenagers' lame girlfriend never could.</p>
<p>Summer always ends too soon, and before long I'm sure beachy dance music will sound as cloying as rock fans considered the Beach Boys by the late 1960s. Like Wavves in Barcelona, Delorean recognize there's a dark side to their ecstatic vision, the aching truth that utopia-- literally, ""no place""-- can never totally be fulfilled. As equally impressive bonus track ""Big Dipper"" puts it: ""Babe, if you want to we could run away up into the sun/ But we would only fade from black to black."" Delorean's similarities to other ""sunny"", ""shimmering"" new artists, ultimately, are far less important than their similarities to other practitioners of well-crafted and instantly gripping pop.</p></div>"|13339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13339-ayrton-senna-ep/|8.4|Marc Hogan

So it follows that they're in a position to make the darndest music, which is one way, perhaps, to describe what Anja Plaschg is doing with Soap&amp;Skin, a project that's already turned a few heads in the young singer's native Austria. Plaschg recorded <i>Lovetune for Vacuum</i>, her debut album, while still a teenager, and the record is in many ways a document of what an ugly, awkward, erratic-- and, occasionally, glorious and transcendent-- process growing up can be. Tracks teeming with tension and lyrics detailing obsession and strife rub right up against moments of clarity and respite, just as Plaschg's chosen instrument, the piano, is sometimes usurped by more gnarled sounds of electronic origin. For all its connotations of purity, a vacuum, after all, is also a place where you can't breathe.</p>
<p>Plaschg is part of a generation of music-lovers not bound by the strictures of geography and commerce, free to gorge on sounds in limitless abundance. So is it any wonder that <i>Lovetune</i> sounds like some unholy union of Nico and Regina Spektor <i>and</i> Aphex Twin <i>and</i> a sizable chunk of the Fonal and Monika rosters? And, sure, some <i>You Are Free</i>-era Cat Power too, and Autechre, and maybe Stina Nordenstam, and certainly Björk, and a good deal of the classical/art song vanguard as well. The Nico namedrop has the most currency, particularly given Plaschg's native tongue and the fact that she has already portrayed the iconic musician/model in a play back home. Indeed, it's tempting to posit <i>Lovetune</i> as the sort of record Nico might be making today had she not taken off on her bicycle that fateful day in 1988.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Plaschg's most singular quality: her voice, a thing of great authority but not much grace that helps smooth over the parade of influences here into a unified whole. Even when she attempts the ethereal, as on ""Cry Wolf"", that voice still has an earthy, guttural weight to it, and when she uncloaks it completely to let out a full-on scream on ""Spiracle"" (live YouTube clips of this are worth seeking out), it blasts forth with all the violent colors of German Expressionist painting. There's a beauty-in-ugliness thing going on through much of <i>Lovetune</i>, in fact. ""Marche Funèbre"" throbs along on clusters of dense strings rendered severe and imposing by repetition, while the clatter of toys on ""Cry Wolf"" (the most Fonal-like moment here) sounds grating even as it suggests a yearning toward childhood. ""Wolf"" has an interesting parallel in the similarly clattery ""DDMMYYYY"", only there the toys have mutated into demon typewriters and fax machines performing what sounds like a rather nasty dissection. Call it growing pains.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, such as on ""Turbine Womb"" and ""Brother of Sleep"", Plaschg's piano conjures images of serene repose, a temporary calm within the emotional storm that is just about any teen's inner state. ""Extinguish Me"" and ""Mr. Gaunt Pt 1000"" even tend toward the saccharine. She may be synthesizing a whole mess of influences, but there's no questioning Plaschg's talent for marrying what we might consider ""comfort music""-- sentimental, indulgent fare that's easy to cling to-- and the ""distance music"" of her more outré electronic and classical forbearers. By the end of closing track ""Brother of Sleep"", all is becalmed, right on through to the quiet sounds of the natural world that occupy the track's final minute.

Granted, they're not particularly useful reasons, what with them having more to do with scenester anxiety and cred wars than anything, but they're floating around right now and muddling up the discourse. Fortunately, they have an album out now, which means that extrapolating judgments from little more than a 7"", an EP, and the dreaded Williamsburg address is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>And here's a shock: <i>Rewild</i> isn't brought down by irony or posing or whatever it is about trust funds and/or beards that's supposed to make music shitty-- it's just a really scattershot debut, albeit a frequently entertaining one. Amazing Baby seem to be at the point in their young career where they're a short distance away from transitioning out of the traditional ""riffing off bands we like"" phase, and while there's a healthy eclecticism to their nebulous classic rock affectations, they do a better job at creating interesting variations of known quantities than transcending them. Opener ""Bayonets"" features a more muscular take on ELO's baroque, string-driven prog-pop, ""Invisible Palace"" towers like Pink Floyd's ""Astronomy Domine"" reproduced in neon and buffed to a metal-flake shine, ""The Narwhal"" is an amped-up, bongo-driven echo of Led Zeppelin's ""The Battle of Evermore"", and ""Dead Light"" and ""Headdress"" are perforated with glimmering shards of T. Rex. Still, it's a sign of hope that their stuff's hooky enough to transcend their semi-obvious source material, and combining early-70s rock histrionics with glossy post-electro party-rock wildness is a promising formula.</p>
<p>But to get past the decent-pastiche stage, they still need a little work in the identity department. Frontman Will Roan has a voice that can't stick to a single memorable template, so he shades towards Marc Bolan astral swagger one moment and Donovan pastoralism the next. The single most consistent thing about his voice is how dazed and mumbly it sounds, which is either an asset or a detriment depending on how far towards dope-haze swooning any given song skews; he sounds effortlessly majestic in the gauzy slog of ""Pump Yr Brakes"" but smothered and lagging beneath the energetic uptempo charge of ""Kankra"". Simon O'Connor, guitarist and the other half of the band's core founding duo, has a broader problem: he drowns his instrument in so much arena-sized production glop it can be hard to tell what he's got going on stylistically beneath it all, though when he breaks out-- like he does in the squalling solos during ""Smoke Bros"" or ""Pump Yr Brakes""-- it's a pretty good jolt. (And since he played in Stylofone, who put out the great Thin Lizzy-toned riff-fest single ""Nighttime"" two and a half years ago, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.) This wall-of-gunk approach extends across the rest of the band, to the point where there's not a lot of breathing space; compare their <a href=""http://www.daytrotter.com/dt/amazing-baby-sxsw-session-blowing-psychedelic-smoke-into-your-face-concert/20030667-3738003.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daytrotter</a> sessions or the version of ""Headdress"" from their <i>Infinite Fucking Cross</i> EP to the overproduced re-recordings here and you'll hear what a subtler mix could do for these guys.</p>
<p>That lack of breathing space, combined with Roan's mumbly-Joe tendencies, does obscure the hell out of the lyrics, which is a mixed blessing; Roan admitted to <i>Rolling Stone</i> that ""our lyrics are totally ridiculous sometimes,"" and it is at least to his credit he recognizes this. I'm not sure if that makes it more or less difficult to forgive ""Bayonets"" for using the phrase ""the kids are all right"" as part of its chorus, or ""Smoke Bros"" for its baffling refrain, ""We are starving cannibals/ She protects her animals."" I suppose when your closest lyrical analogue on the album's most memorable sing-along/chant-along line is Total Coelo, you risk alienating some people. But that's the kind of turf that can come with the feeling-out process, and there's enough lyrics that aren't goofy, uninspiring, or just plain illegible to make up for the ones that are. Unfortunately, the post-Web 2.0 hype cycle doesn't have time for growing pains; their reactionary approach tends to be enthusiastic first, then disappointed. Speaking as someone who would prefer to see the opposite happen-- letting bands dick around and get mediocrity out of their system before hitting on the inspiration that makes them worth following-- <i>Rewild</i> is how an average debut album should pan out. It might outstrip its ambition and wear its influences too blatantly, but Amazing Baby could be something special once it all clicks.</p></div>"|13286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13286-rewild/|6.1|Nate Patrin

Trying to find a whole lot of Fol Chen info, photographic or otherwise, on the web is a big fat waste of time. And presumably, they want you to listen to their debut and think, ""man, <i>who are Fol Chen?</i>"" Of course, that can just as easily turn into a dismissive ""man, who the fuck are Fol Chen?"" Especially when similar tactics worked for intentionally faceless and musically mysterious acts from (early) Sunny Day Real Estate to the Knife to the Sincerely Yours crew, and these guys play a click-push electro-acoustic pop thing whose first priority should be distancing itself from the similar likes of Anathallo and Le Loup.</p>
<p>And yet for all of their attempts at presenting a consolidated front, Fol Chen make good on their charge on account of being a deceptively good singles act. Opener ""The Believers"" sets out to establish a mood with vague conspiratorial lyrics and generally ""album track""-ness, but it's a flat opener; follow-up ""No Wedding Cake"" makes good use of <i>Remain in Light-</i>styled funk guitar and an investment in motion. Likewise, ""The Idiot"" comes off like a less-stylized, more approachable Junior Boys, doing the old C&amp;W trick of offering dedication as a proper substitute to one's intelligence.</p>
<p>But if this all sounds a little too cutesy in that 2005 way to you, Fol Chen distinguish themselves during <i>John Shade</i>'s midsection with some seriously percussive production. ""Red Skies Over Garden City (The Ballad of Donna Donna)"" tumbles out of the court of King Crimson with cavernous drum patterns, while ""Winter, That's All"" manages a stomp-the-yard drumline mixed with rave keyboards. But if you're gonna pick a breakout single from <i>John Shade</i>, your best bet is ""Cable TV"". It's lyrical idea is cliché, but there's a certain sense of slink (if not necessarily sexiness) that recalls, I dunno, Bran Van 3000 or any number of late-1990s one-offs-- its ""Killing Me Softly""-style sitar drop is just dorky enough to be kinda loveable.</p>
<p>As good as ""Cable TV"" and ""Winter, That's All"" sound, <i>John Shade'</i><span>s main weakness was supposed to be its strength-- during the points where the tempo dies down and the songwriting hues closer to traditional forms, there's not enough personality or character in the vocals to compensate, leading to stretches of indie promo-pile filler. Not quite up to the level that Fol Chen consider themselves at-- they've compared their music to the obelisk that graces the cover of Led Zeppelin's <i>Presence</i> (be forewarned that it <i>sounds </i> nothing like, say, ""Achilles Last Stand"" or ""Tea for One""), and while it's not <i>that</i> transfixing, Fol Chen at least have our attention going forward.</span></p></div>"|13342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13342-part-i-john-shade-your-fortunes-made/|6.9|Ian Cohen

Garneau knows this. These melodramatic chords and melodies wended their way through his debut <i>Music for Tourists</i>, and his follow up <i>El Radio</i> is rife with them as well. Simple progressions, heart-on-sleeve lyrics, Garneau's own little boy singing-- his innocence and earnestness is apparent, but at the same time if he makes this stuff sound easy it's because, generally speaking, it <i>is</i> easy. (see: our brains, hard-wired).</p>
<p>While far from pastiche, <i>El Radio </i>does explore, at least in passing, such familiar territory as chamber pop and theatrical Eastern European-flavored showtunes, and if there's anything working in Garneau's favor it's that he works within these frameworks with an ear for space. With kitchen-sink indie at its apex, Garneau often goes the other way, stripping his songs down to their minimal components. Songs such as ""Dirty Night Clowns""<span> </span>or ""Fireflies"" might have a lot going on in them, but they're by no means cluttered, which keeps the focus keenly on those simple melodies and Garneau's almost androgynously high (though rarely keening) voice.</p>
<p>Yet even relatively pared down and hushed, <i>El Radio</i> is steeped in affectation, from its vaguely cabaret bent to its mopey singer-songwriter tropes.<span> </span>""Over and Over"" and ""Hands on the Radio"" are certainly pretty, but they're also so precious it's almost unbearable, and not in the emotional way. On ""Things She Said"", Garneau almost sounds like he's playing a character, not in the story-song sense but like a secondary performer taking a solo turn in the spotlight in an off-Broadway musical. The winsome ""No More Pirates"" benefits greatly from Garneau's tidy arrangement, but it, too, sounds like a beat in a story we don't get.</p>
<p>In fact, like friend Duncan Sheik, that may ultimately prove the best place for Garneau's particular talents. In the context of the LP, Garneau's songs typically connect only on the most facile of levels-- those easy sad chords, plinking piano keys and the like-- but in service of a story, a narrative, they might gain a little more meaning. Ending the disc with ""Black Hawk Waltz"", another soft, minor key instrumental, gives <i>El Radio</i> its conclusion, but little that preceded it leaves enough of an impression to enhance or amplify the album's erstwhile final punctuation. For music that aims to ply the heart, <i>El Radio</i> ultimately lacks in noticeable passion, leaving the listener lingering outside Garneau's little world, waiting to be let in.</p></div>"|13204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13204-el-radio/|4.8|Joshua Klein

I tried for weeks to get hold of him, bent my own schedule around his; when we finally got on the horn, he was in a loud airport and seemed uninterested in talking to some random dude about J Dilla or his process. The connection was shaky anyway, so we just aborted the thing. As frustrating as that was for me and my editors, it gave me a better understanding-- and weirdly, respect-- for Ellison as a musician. Here was a guy concerned only with the making of beats and none of the attendant PR bullshit that accompanies being a hotshot producer.</p>
<p>That was about a year ago, and since then Ellison's single-mindedness has paid off, manifesting itself in the creation of his own new imprint, Brainfeeder, and no less than five albums of fresh or remixed material, most notably a triptych of EPs reimagining tracks from 2008's <i>Los Angeles</i>. The last in the series, <i>L.A. EP 3 X 3</i>, is also the most intriguing, a seven-track suite that features two new songs and a handful of bold recontextualizations (they're more than remixes, really) from friends and fellow leftfield beatmakers from his homebase of L.A. and abroad.</p>
<p>It's not surprising that Ellison would conceive a piece like this, since so much of his music relies on the deconstruction and re-configuration of sounds and ideas. The difference here is he's allowing others to do the same with his own material. Remarkably, much of <i>L.A. EP 3 X 3</i> differs in style and tone from Ellison's previous beat-centric work, which is known for retaining a soulfulness amid its often complex, propulsive arrangements. Here, in place of the spliced-up Dillaisms of <i>Los Angeles</i> and his lesser known, but equally strong <i>1983</i>, Ellison offers a textural ambient piece, music that falls somewhere between the electro-drone of Canadian composer Tim Hecker and the Eastern-tinged blissfulness of <i>Rounds</i>-era Four Tet.</p>
<p>Considering that most electronic-music producers take years to develop a singular style, it's no small feat for FlyLo to try on an alternate genre and mostly pull it off. His two original contributions to the album, the appropriately titled ""Endless White"" and ""Spin Cycles"", are most notable for showcasing that rare flexibility. The former is one of the record's standouts, where an undulating synth groan is set aflutter by distant bird chirps and ethereal vocal samples drifting in and out of the mix. ""Spin Cycles"" has a similar, though slightly more distorted feel. In it, a crowd of voices is processed into one, creating an unsettling group chant that FlyLo embellishes with bits of harp strumming and wonky analog bits. <i>L.A. EP 3 X 3</i>'s remaining tracks, all handled in some way by other artists, share these songs' ghostly qualities.</p>
<p>Most of the guests here are affiliated with Ellison in some way, friends from a loose L.A. beat collective who share his weeded-out, future-forward aesthetic. If their remixes don't always improve upon the original tracks, they at least push the source material in compelling new directions. Dimlite (né Dimitri Grimm), a downtempo specialist who records for Sonar Kollektiv, reimagines <i>Los Angeles</i>' spare vocal closer ""Infinitum"" as a haunted, buzzing atmospheric number, with heavy Sunn O)))-style guitars and asymmetrical drumbeats filling out the arrangement. UK dubstep dude Breakage, the lone international contributor here, takes a similar course on his shoegaze-y ""Bill's Suit Mix"" of ""Testament"" and manages the best track of the bunch. He turns the breezy original into something fierce and ominous, stirring in angelic female vocals to soften his walls of guitar noise and storm-a-brewing drums.</p>
<p>Probably the most impressive thing about <i>L.A. EP 3 X 3</i> is that, despite its many cooks in the kitchen, the record feels remarkably cohesive-- almost like the well-thought-out work of one artist. The intricate strings from harpist Rebekah Raff's ""Auntie's Harp Remix"" echo through FlyLo's ""Spin Cycles"", the droning elements from ""Endless White"" spill over into Take's clattering re-do of ""Parisian Goldfish"", and tiny pieces of tracks seem to reappear in others. The songs bleed into one another naturally and exist more as an album than a remix collection, which is an achievement in its own right. But more than that, <i>L.A. EP 3 X 3</i> shows an exciting new side of Ellison, a producer who seems to be getting better as he progresses. We'll have to wait to find out how these new ideas coalesce on his next full-length, but if this album's any indication, we might be treated to something altogether different.</p></div>"|13325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13325-la-ep-3-x-3/|7.6|Joe Colly

On opener ""Greatest Thoughts"", for instance, Groves suffers her adoration for the lover who won't meet her in the middle and, even worse, will never actually understand her. But she's willing to forfeit just a bit of her young life to give him a chance: ""You pulled me closer to your chest/ You were the one that I liked best,"" she rhymes simply, her bracing voice whispering above a romantic piano line that recalls Claude Debussy. And over the steadily building waves of acoustic guitar that shape ""Coast"", Groves sings of escaping to the ""coast of the East of England."" Confident in the immortality afforded by youth and love, she wants to stare into the danger of the storms moving in from the sea-- with him. ""I think that he and I will be saved,"" she sings, harmonizing the high notes herself. Indeed, the bulk of Blue Roses is a call to turn one's beliefs over to feelings and intuition, even if it results in the sort of somber, sobering imperative that ends this album: ""You're better off leaving/ Just go in the night."" For Groves, life's more about invigorating highs and lows than the inevitable crash that follows.</p>
<p>These lyrical patterns fit the 10 songs that comprise <i>Blue Roses</i>, a mostly solo album played almost entirely by Groves and recorded by friends in several English homes. Even though youth sometimes overcomes her taste here, she's adventurous and confident, executing grand musical gestures without hesitation.</p>
<p>To wit, the opening triptych is as brazen an introduction to a new songwriter, singer, arranger, and performer as I can recall. Groves is as comfortable with the soft, solitary coo that begins ""Greatest Thoughts"" as she is with the crisscrossed-and-stacked harmonies that bloom at its middle. She swings between the strident flair of Joanna Newsom and the broad mellifluence of Antony at will, and her versatility continually renews interest. The album's best moment-- the brilliant second tune, ""Cover Your Tracks""-- even bends time. With its dizzying succession of parts, it feels like 15 minutes' worth of ideas crammed into a potential radio hit. And Groves' ideas-- from guitar finger-picking to an exultant choir that splits the song's calm surface-- suggest we're not witnessing someone who treats her songs casually. Having nothing and everything to prove at once, Groves infuses tunes that seem naively simple on paper, like the coming-of-resilience mantra and third track ""I Am Leaving"", with floods of conflicting elements. Analog keyboards and accordion, digital distortion and glockenspiel: They all lift the song's lilting acoustic guitar, effectively transforming it from a ditty into a statement.</p>
<p>Over these 45 minutes, though, that saturated aesthetic sometimes drowns itself. Groves doesn't yet posses the wisdom of restraint, at least not consistently. Sure, ""Rebecca"" begins with a spare electric guitar line and her lonely voice, and closer ""Imaginary Flights"" begins with an elegant piano dirge. But, like their counterparts, these tunes inevitably swell, suffocating Groves' occasionally masterful use of dynamics with too many of them. She doesn't step away from the flourishes to let the song breathe, and she only rarely lets the music communicate the story apart from the words and her voice. It's like watching two great movies on a split-screen television: Sometimes, one needs to be paused so that the other can make sense. This idea works in the hands of masters like Sufjan Stevens (in spite of his vainglory and gimmicks) and Jim O'Rourke (in spite of his, you know, aloofness). Groves isn't there yet.</p>
<p>But I'm more than willing to eat these words soon: <i>Blue Roses</i> makes it clear that Groves is inordinately talented and working with big portions of audacity and acumen. It's the sort of debut that puts Groves in the company of recent giants, both with its dramatic compositional flair (again, Joanna Newsom) and in its mix of homemade humility and major accomplishment. Add Blue Roses to the recent list of Bon Iver, Adem Ilhan, and Peter Broderick-- smart songwriters with the vision and wherewithal to do succeed, for the most part, by themselves.</p></div>"|13335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13335-blue-roses/|7.8|Grayson Currin

Today, Sangaré is an elder stateswoman of Malian music, in particular the updated pop descendants of the traditional hunting songs of the Wassoulou region. She is immensely popular in her homeland-- her 1989 debut album, <i>Moussoulou</i> (""Women""), sold an astonishing 250,000 official copies, mostly in Africa, where bootleg cassettes account for an enormous percentage of sales. She's earned her place among West Africa's musical elite, and <i>Seya</i> should solidify her place abroad as well, with its seamless mix of old and new sounds that give her an arresting, sometimes haunting backdrop for her confident vocals and activist lyrics, sung in several languages.</p>
<p>Sangaré gets a hand from a whopping 47 collaborators on the album, including master guitarist Djelimady Tounkara, Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis, and Tony Allen. Most appear on a track or two, and mixed in with all the electric guitar, bass, flute, sax, and trap drums are a host of traditional Malian instruments, including the ngoni (a cousin of the guitar and banjo), the balafon (a type of marimba), and an arsenal of drums and percussion that give the album a diverse and always interesting rhythmic base. It opens with a blast of rhythmic balafon and dives into a fractured groove topped with an arcing flute, as Sangaré sings a forceful appeal for women's equality in society and the home. Women's rights are an issue she's built her public life and much of her music around, and it's a theme that crops up across the album.</p>
<p>""Wele Wele Wintou"" sets dark female harmonies against a sharp sax theme behind Sangaré's rapid-fire vocal, which speaks out against forced marriage. Subtle wah guitar burbles through the verses, and Tounkara takes one of the most unusual solos I've heard, playing far down the neck with a dark, blunt tone. You could probably listen to just the instrumental backing tracks to most of these songs and come away satisfied by the richness of the interlocking rhythms and the subtle harmonic shifts. Even slow tracks like ""Senkele Te Sira"", which features another brilliant guitar part from Tounkara, have a dynamic, vibrant character that perfectly matches Sangaré's sometimes towering vocals. She knows how to accent a phrase, unleashing a powerful wail at key moments to drive home a thought in a way that makes her passion clear in any language.</p></div>"|13330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13330-seya/|8.1|Joe Tangari

But Felix's ""Silver Screen Shower Scene"" sounds as good now as in the days of electroclash for one simple reason: His teenage training cutting tough-as-nails jack fodder for post-Frankie Knuckles Chicagoans meant ""Silver Screen"" felt honestly tough, rather than the feigned brutalism of those who wouldn't come within spitting distance of either gabba or a gosp<i>el a cappella</i>.</p>
<p>It's tempting to say that Felix's music has been progressively less interesting as the decade's worn on because he refuses to let go of the context that briefly made him a pan-genre star. <i>He Was King</i> was described in the advance press as an ""electronic pop"" record, but Felix was never particularly good at ""pop,"" while he positively fucking excelled at floor-ready craziness without much chance of crossing over. Like his track-happy peers in the Relief/Cajual era, Felix would have been barred from the Brill Building, but you also suspect he wouldn't have cared. And as for his later career, well, it was easy to look like Phil friggin' Spector when your competition was Avenue D.</p>
<p>So unlike, say, Basement Jaxx, Felix's pop moves have never been material you could debut straight-faced at an acoustic open mic. Even the Jaxx's lesser songs have a distinct personality, whereas Felix's attempts at trad catchiness sound like the anemic approximations of someone who stopped listening to the radio on Dec. 31, 1989, and forgot what was so good about the era in the interim. Take album opener ""We All Wanna Be Prince"", whose main crime is not its blatancy (kinda signposted by the title) but how enervated its pastiche sounds. Prince had no shortage of imitators when he was at the top, either. And in both eras, those who ripped him off knew to swipe some of his songwriting mojo, rather than just the lame sonic signifiers that scream ""PRINCE"" in 40-foot high purple letters and offer nothing on the second listen. ""We All Wanna Be Prince"" is so stagnant and obvious that you keep waiting for some conceptual punchline only to walk away with the dead air greeting a joke that fell on its face.</p>
<p>Most of the tracks you suspect Felix thinks are capital-p pop likewise toe the ""joke or not?"" line warily, from the titles on down. ""Turn Me on a Summer Smile"" would be a little cringeworthy even if we were trawling through demos fished from the dumpster behind an apartment-run twee label. But at least it fits the song's cut-rate Saint Etienne pastiche. Anyone who claims Sarah Cracknell lacks vocal personality will sigh at the off-the-rack girly club vocals all over <i>He Was King</i>.</p>
<p>But ""Spank U Very Much"" is the kind of entendre-flaying pun guys banging out identikit hi-nrg remixes would roll their bloodshot eyes over. Felix has never been afraid to be gaudy, whether good (the no-excuses O.T.T. house of his early days) or really, really bad (the avert-your-eyes cover art for 2004's <i>Devin Dazzle and the Neon Fever</i>). But the endless sing-songy chorus substituting for anything like structure, and the generic ""pop made with keyboards"" backing, means ""Spank U"" flops square in ""eh"" territory.</p>
<p>Like so much of <i>He Was King</i> ""Spank U"" can't even be bothered to poke the ass-end of awfulness in your eye, doubly sad when that lack of shame is generally a good thing when it comes to house music. This is, after all, a genre whose populist end has thrived for two decades on some pretty questionable purloined bubblegum hooks. So why do those 4/4 remixes of hardcore chart cheese work better than, say, Felix's ""Do We Move Your World"", a song so clearly aiming for that kind of ear-worm-plus-club-rhythm two-for-one value? Oh, right, because they had their start as <i>pop songs</i>, a venue where you go hard with your hooks or you stay home. The subtle shimmer of ""We"" is the about the only time this slightness feels like choice rather than necessity.</p>
<p>And here's the real rub: When Felix stays fierce, instrumental, and near-abrasive, the album scrapes greatness. ""Elvi$"" and ""LA Ravers"" are both no-bullshit house tracks, the former with a great rapper-with-the-hiccups electro break and the latter with some knuckle-dusting riffage that's a reminder of why we also continuing listening to Vitalic when we've recycle-binned our Fischerspooner collection. And the titular boing on ""Kickdrum"" is so big and baldly boorish it's like some Rotterdam raver flew one of the ladies of the Human League over for a one-off collaboration. Unfortunately a whole album of similarly DJ-pitched material, all the quote-unquote pop frills shaved off, wouldn't have allowed blog readers to devote the few days their attenuated attentions can muster for <i>He Was King</i>'s singles, before the next this-is-kind-of-okay-I-guess electro-pop album arrives to distract them.</p></div>"|13276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13276-he-was-king/|4.5|Jess Harvell

But Miss Derringer's custom duds are no more a put-on than Kings of Leon's Shaggy wardrobe or the Decemberists faux Victorian accoutrements. The L.A. band plays its parts to the hilt: A sculptor dealing in darkly whimsical phantasmagoria, singer Liz McGrath appears in a sequined baton-twirler leotard with a goth marching-band helmet and prison tattoo for the band's third and best album, <i>Winter Hill</i>, which is a change from the Weimar rockabilly chanteuse she played on 2006's <i>Lullabies</i>. Enlisting local designers like Adele Mildred and Winter Rosebudd, she's a West Coast Karen O, but aims for retro composure rather than punk disarray. The men who back her wear black as a nod to the Man in Black but accessorize like Mike Ness: matching wallet chains, western shirts, black armbands, heavy eye make-up.</p>
<p>To their considerable credit, Miss Derringer sound exactly like they look and don't need the look to sound good. Just as they mix and match fashions, they blend country, punk, rockabilly, showtunes, cabaret, and New Wave into a surprisingly sturdy and seamless sound. With faster tempos and more pronounced hooks than their previous albums, <i>Winter Hill</i> is a concept album of sorts about the Irish Gang Wars of the 1960s, when the McLaughlin Gang and the Winter Hill Gang made Boston a bloody battlefield. These songs are the band's playful approximations of what might have been playing on the radio as gangsters drove to hit jobs or slumped in their seats during stakeouts. Accordingly, the band build from period-specific sounds, but it's highly unlikely-- okay, outright impossible-- that James ""Whitey"" Bulger or Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi were listening to X and Social Distortion while whacking McLaughlin soldiers or laundering money. Perhaps because Miss Derringer are enough removed in time from their music heroes, they don't have a kneejerk reverence toward Carl Perkins, Lesley Gore, or Blondie, which leaves them free to compress half a century of pop history into short, sharp, smart pop songs.</p>
<p>On <i>Winter Hill</i>, Miss Derringer are witty synthesists. ""Death By Desire"" begins with a spoken-word intro and ends with some Explosions in the Sky guitars, as if girl-group drama is no different from post-rock drama. The chorus of ""Bulletproof Heart"" sounds like there's a skip in their Shangri-La's record: ""He don't! He don't! He don't!"" sings Liz McGrath, and you expect her to continue with ""hang around with the gang no more!"" Likewise, ""Drop Shot Dead"", one of the few songs to explicitly address the gang wars, (mis)quotes Roy Orbison. ""I close my eyes/ And I dream away,"" McGrath sings with a sly hiccup in her voice, before the song rockets into a surf-guitar chorus that's one of the catchiest and most undeniable hooks on the album.</p>
<p>In fact, the fashion is inseparable from the music, not just as another manifestation of their influences but as an emotional scrim. Despite its period trappings, <i>Winter</i> <i>Hill</i> is a heavy, dark, and desperate album, and songs like ""Mausoleum"" and ""Heartbreaks &amp; Razorblades"" have real emotional stakes. Consider the opening lines of ""Heartbreaks &amp; Razorblades"", which McGrath sings with only a spare guitar for accompaniment: ""We found him late last night/ Lying on his side/ With a note by his side/ And I try to block the sight from my mind."" She makes it a very real moment, cutting through the sequins and make-up to invest those lines with a sense of real loss<i>. Winter Hill</i> thrums with chilly heartbreak that belies the liberties Miss Derringer take with traditions and influences, as if the only way they could address subjects so raw and painful is with lots of eyeliner.</p></div>"|13148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13148-winter-hill/|7.7|Stephen M.

The trio-- comprised of brothers Brad and Phil Cook and Joe Westerlund-- sing that admonition repeatedly, in boisterous unison, yet they have no intention of taking such advice, at least not musically. In fact, since the disbanding of their previous band DeYarmond Edison (with Bon Iver's Justin Vernon), they have celebrated the joys of shaky foundations, creating ingeniously ramshackle folk rock that combines acoustic instruments and mountain harmonies with obtuse sound collages, meandering song structures, and abstract passages featuring the most psychedelic banjo imaginable. As if to illustrate this point, they've even designed the album cover so that it works either as a square or as a diamond, the subtle shift of landscape revealing new ambiguities.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Solid Ground"" kicks off with a dirty guitar riff and a walking bass line, unfolding as a formally repetitive blues. This type of structure-- the same line three times, followed by a new fourth line-- is perhaps the most solid ground in rock, yet Megafaun make it slippery by adding a squealing solo whose feedback emanates not from a guitar, but from a closely mic'ed blues harmonica. Near the end, the casual midtempo groove threatens to fall apart as the instruments break stride, but Megafaun manage to keep it together. Averse to predictability and sentimentality, the band is restless with established forms, yet instead of subverting blues and folk traditions, they upend them. Their ends are deconstructive, not destructive.</p>
<p>This tendency, however, made their 2008 debut, <i>Bury the Square</i>, sound frustratingly divided, as if the band's divergent musical urges had been compartmentalized and overthought. It was as though they had all the pieces, but were unsure how to fit them together. <i>Gather, Form &amp; Fly</i> improves dramatically on that release, integrating musical styles more organically and confidently to play up the contrasts between them. ""Solid Ground"" segues seamlessly into the múm-like ""Darkest Hour"", which turns water droplets into a rudimentary melody before morphing into waves crashing on a beach and finally settling into a thunderstorm backdrop for splices of a hymnal roundelay. Similarly, ""Impressions of the Past"" begins with a shuffling intro that never coalesces into a vocal-based song. Instead, it's 10 or 12 different songs before the vocals enter in the final minutes, and even then, they sound like just another instrument in the mix. The song doesn't present a fully formed memory but, as its title suggests, a series of memory traces-- brief, bittersweet, and impossible to hang on to.</p>
<p>Megafaun's songs change shape constantly-- a thrillingly mercurial quality that makes <i>Gather, Form &amp; Fly</i> a headily absorbing, occasionally unsettling listen. Despite their musical wanderlust, the trio remain firmly rooted in the Appalachian foothills, enamored with folk traditions and pastoral airs. The album opens with ""Bella Marie"", a gossamer overture featuring guitar, piano, and a violin so closely mic'ed you can hear the friction of the bow on strings. Joe Westerlund's clattery percussion on ""The Process"" can't disguise its chicken-coop soul, and Christy Smith, of Nola, North Carolina's the Tender Fruit, duets on ""The Longest Day"", a delicate country number that floats along on tender banjo and guitar strums. The buoyant melody of ""The Fade"", perhaps the most instantly accessible song here, recalls locals the Kingsbury Manx as the Cook brothers sing about the death of their grandfather and the tragic shortcomings of memory: ""It's been a year,"" they sing together, ""and now I fear the fade is on."" (Trivia: That's him on the CD and etched into side four of the vinyl.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Moments like that lend <i>Gather, Form &amp; Fly</i> its warmth and accessibility, despite the intentionally shaky foundations of songs like ""Guns"", which begins with one of their best moments: ""All we'll ever be, all we'll ever need,"" the trio sing together, with a mix of triumph and forlornness, before ominous rumblings dislodge their vocals from the emphatic guitar strums and drown them all in gentle noise. Rather than blanch the song of its momentousness, that spectral coda makes it all the more meaningful, as if they've just stepped from a sunlit clearing into dark woods. While some listeners may grow weary of such insistent drones, and while it's tempting to read these tendencies as opposite extremes, ultimately there are no simple dichotomies in these songs, no easy distinctions between written and improvised, concrete and fluid, organic and synthetic. All the sounds and ideas emanate from the same sources and desires, and the prismatic contrasts between them illuminate this intriguing and heartfelt album.</p></div>"|13223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13223-gather-form-fly/|8.1|Stephen M.

Since releasing its first album in 1998, the Massachusetts group has been tinkering restlessly with its sound and lineup to the degree that each new album heralds a new approach and a new band. As a result, there is no straight line of development from Wheat's debut through their most recent efforts, but rather a jagged trajectory tracing their exploration of the frayed edges of pop songcraft. So it's no surprise that their fifth full-length, <i>White Ink, Black Ink</i>, proves so markedly different from 2007's <i>Every Day I Said a Prayer for Kathy and Made a One Inch Square</i>, just as that album was worlds removed from its predecessor, 2003's <i>Per Second Per Second Per Second... Every Second</i>, whose streamlined sound made it a fan favorite.<span> </span>If the sonic contortions of <i>One Inch Square</i> lost the band some listeners (especially after a four-year wait), then <i>White Ink, Black Ink </i>might bring them back: It may not be start-to-finish consistent, but it is much more focused and straightforward.</p>
<p>Singer Scott Levesque and drummer Brendan Harney-- who switch up instruments often enough that those titles are almost meaningless-- emphasize rhythm and texture on these songs, which gives the album a straight through-line that suggests the pop sensibility of <i>Per Second</i> sucked through the clatter of <i>One Inch Square</i>. Opener ""H.O.T.T."" layers several live and programmed beats over each other to create a strange and steady groove that plays up Levesque's all-chorus songwriting even as it acknowledges that the band's ever-changing sound may alienate some listeners: ""Half of the time I feel broke, cracked, peeled, weathered,"" Levesque sings. ""Half of the time I feel shiny and new.""</p>
<p>""Changes Is"" similarly emphasizes forward motion and Levesque's self-commentary, fashioning a statement on the band's mercurial nature into the album's catchiest hook and bounciest beat. ""I Want Less"" rallies around quick bursts of snare drum hits and high-hat clicks, as if Harney were playing each part of his drum kit separately, yet that sound gathers unexpected momentum as it pushes the song along at a weird clip. Wheat may sound more direct here, but never predictable. ""My Warning Song"" sets up a series of seemingly unconnected elements-- a continually unfolding guitar riff, a choir, a simple drum tattoo, Levesque singing, ""Everything is going to be alright,"" over and over-- yet their modularity is the point, and in the end they all cohere into one of the best and most naturally dramatic moments on the album.</p>
<p>Levesque and Harney repeat no trick on <i>White Ink, Black Ink</i>, no matter how well it may work the first time around. That reluctance to linger makes for a concise album, and part of the album's appeal is hearing them find new ways to sound like themselves. These songs are dense with ideas, some intriguing and others not so much. The thirty-second ""Coke and Tanqueray"", for example, aims for the evocative brevity of a haiku, but sounds more like a wisp of a breeze of a song. Closer ""Baby in My Way"" opens with Levesque singing excitedly over a simple piano theme, creating a nicely spare moment that lets the album exhale a bit, but it soon settles into a string section before fading out prematurely, ending the album on a puzzling but not unpleasant note. Wheat flirt with cursoriness on <i>White Ink, Black Ink</i>, which seems overly compact at times, but they've come back around to the simple pleasures of verses and choruses-- and sound all the better for it.</p></div>"|13146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13146-white-ink-black-ink/|7.4|Stephen M.

Deep house is in vogue everywhere from American indie dance, where DFA acts routinely invoke Chicago and New York's house originators, to European clubs, where moody chords and jacking grooves have dethroned minimal techno. Bradock, meanwhile, remains sorely under-recognized and underrated, despite his roots within the same scene that gave the world Daft Punk and Cassius. It's a pleasure and a public service to finally have the bulk of his remixes, most of them vinyl-only and long out of print, collected in one place. More importantly, the album confirms Bradock as one of house music's most inspired and most uncompromising producers.</p>
<p>This is, after all, the artist responsible for ""Rhapsody in Pain"", a 2007 track pairing a bouncy, lighthearted melody with a gruesome chorus of shrieks and moans. Rarely has feel-good dance music been quite so unsettling. But rarely are his productions are so confrontational, either. In fact, with his predilection for laid-back tempos, aquamarine chords, disco detailing, and full-throated vocals, Bradock's music puts a premium on pleasure-- but there's almost always something slightly ""off"" about his work.</p>
<p>Just listen to his 2002 remix of Iz &amp; Diz's ""Mouth"", which opens the collection. Bradock sticks with the original song's principal conceit, using hiccupping vocal samples (and nothing else) to mimic house music's machine cadences; atop that base, he lays down an airy cushion of barbershop harmonies and sampled scat singing. There's even a kazoo solo, or something like one. But where a lesser artist would have stopped at the clever sound design, Bradock puts it all in service of something ambitiously musical, with unusually voiced chords and odd twists and turns suggesting both the manic whimsy of Raymond Scott and the angelic bent of Grizzly Bear.</p>
<p>Bradock is a genius arranger. His 2008 remix of International Pony's ""Bubble in the Bottle"" should be required listening for a generation of producers across house, minimal, disco and electro who think that it's enough to juggle a handful of loops for eight minutes, and call it a track. The ""Happy Zumbi"" remix of ""Bubble"" is minimalistic filter disco at heart, just a lone set of chords and a cacophonous percussion pattern. (Aside from a brief, treated snippet of Snax and Khan's vocals, it bears almost no relation to the original song.) But across just under seven minutes, he puts the thing through its paces, sculpting broad hills and dells out of the filters and levels, and sending squealing oscillators and ramshackle percussive fills flying overhead like unkempt crows. Every element is always in motion-- rising, falling, morphing, turning inside out-- but it never feels busy, and never distracts from the track's graceful arc.</p>
<p>However he's picked his commissions, Bradock has kept curious company. Icons like Cesaria Evora and Roy Ayers share space here with names like Incognito, Zero 7, Chateau Flight, and Pete Namlook, drawing a map of 1990s/00s electronic music that runs from world fusion to deep house to middlebrow downtempo. Judging by the tracklisting, it looks schizo at best and mercenary at worst. But for all the disparity of the source material and the range of sounds, ideas, and moods achieved in the remixes, the reworks all point to a unifying aesthetic.</p>
<p>How to describe it? The phrase ""deep burnt""-- also, incidentally, the title of a 1999 Bradock tune-- might suffice. Jazzy augmented chords and skipping grooves are torn straight from the deep house textbook, but there's something deliciously charred about it all. Drum samples and synthesizers swim in a fizz of distortion. Voices double and dub into a fog of echo. Melodies aren't so much played as splashed on in broad, energetic strokes; samples are daubed atop one another in haphazard, slapdash fashion. Both his textures and his collage sensibility recall Robert Rauschenberg. Everywhere you listen, odd sonics clump like sand in drying paint, while errant electronic noises go careening beyond the limits of the canvas and the frame.</p>
<p>If Bradock is less well known than, say, DJ Koze, another musician who has used remixes as a springboard for his own idiosyncratic style, that's at least partly Bradock's doing. He has never hidden behind a scrim of anonymity, but he's never exactly courted attention, either. His remixes far outnumber his original productions, the bulk of which have appeared only on his own, vinyl-only label, Atavisme. And despite the high profile of his commissions, I daresay that the cavalier weirdness of his approach hasn't inspired many average Zero 7 fans to delve further into his catalog. But <i>Confiote de Bits</i> shows the remixes to be far more than merely a footnote to Bradock's recording career. Almost two hours long, the collection still holds together as coherently as many artist albums, testifying to the strength of Bradock's voice and vision over the past decade and more. These tracks are so full of spirit and ideas that, taken together, <i>Confiote de Bits</i> is practically an embarrassment of riches-- though the only ones blushing should be the musicians who have taken ""deep house"" as a model simply to be remade in its own image, over and over. In Bradock's house, the doors and windows are thrown wide open, with gusts of wind left to remodel at their leisure.</p></div>"|13273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13273-confiote-de-bits-a-remix-collection/|8.6|Philip Sherburne

Unlike most of their peers operating in some form of lo-fi punk, Blues Control have their sights on a more expansive sound, a kind of homespun blend of instrumental, machine-tinged psychedelic rock. Though stylistically dissimilar, they do share these acts' affinity for stripped-down, hissy sonics, making the band a sensible fit at boutique noise-pop imprint Siltbreeze. <i>Local Flavor</i>, their second full-length and first for the label, is an ambitious offering, a half-hour ride through murky textures built from electronics and traditional instrumentation.</p>
<p>Blues Control are not a pop band (far from it, in fact), and they don't seem especially concerned about hooks or melody. While the four songs on <i>Local Flavor</i>-- which strung together, comprise one gradually expanding instrumental piece-- may not find much of an audience outside of committed fans of noise and drone, the album's grainy assemblage of submerged mood music could represent a welcome addition to the latter's record collection.</p>
<p><i>Local Flavor</i>'s tracks are built simply, usually on a foundation of Cho's keyboards or a modest drum-machine pitter-patter, on top of which Waterhouse embellishes with expressive guitar playing and additional electronics. With trumpet assistance from recent It Guy Kurt Vile, opener ""Good Morning"" is the most straightforward track, a lo-fi reimagining of the sludgy psych-rock perfected by Californians Comets on Fire, but it's the slower, dub-tinged pieces here that work best. The album's two best cuts are its last-- the gurgling ""Tangier"" and extended outro ""On Through the Night""-- and on these Cho and Waterhouse home in on a dark, disquieting tone. Here, the music sounds like it's bubbling up from and evil underground, a burial place that holds the secrets of past atrocities.</p>
<p>Though they succeed in sketching these gloomy portraits, there's a detachment about these songs that feels at odds with their other aim, which is creating a feeling of druggy ambience. The best ambient music envelops its listener, and <i>Local Flavor</i> ultimately lacks that sense of inhabitability. (I will say that I find this true of most guitar acts attempting a similar style; this music is difficult to build organically-- part of the reason so many of the finest ambient records are electronic.) It does seem Blues Control might benefit from grander sonics, since it's even harder to make something truly hum out of basic instrumentation. Still, in a scene with too much overlap, one has to commend the band for working far outside the status quo, even if <i>Local Flavor</i> feels like an album that a few will love and a larger majority will find head-scratchingly opaque.</p></div>"|13272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13272-local-flavor/|6.4|Joe Colly

Birthday sex? The best you ever had? Sure, but that's a different kind of summer heat altogether. What if you live in a place where, save for some nasty winds every now and again, summer seems like the season and state-of-mind all year round? There are never any icy sidewalks to brave, fewer windshields to scrape, and bands aren't throwing 'bows for cramped rehearsal spaces-- just miles of hot beach, palm trees, and outdoor dining all day every day. Foreign Born are an L.A. indie rock outfit that exist further west and outside of the Smell or Silver Lake, a band that seems to have germinated over the years outside all semblances of scene in a city whose guitar music rarely sounds genuinely Californian. I'm writing from the opposite coast, but Foreign Born have made a record that feels like a conversation with the Pacific coastline and sounds like endless summer.</p>
<p>That's harder to do well than one might think. Before assembling <i>Person to Person</i>, their second full-length and first for Secretly Canadian, Foreign Born were a band whose rootless pop rocks were still in search of a way to do its geography proud. They branched out, taking layers of vaguely African percussive styles and made them bedrock for frothy, weightless guitar rock. No matter how muscular or tethered to the ground, each four-minute burst sounds as though it could float up and away. Take opener ""Blood Oranges"" and the way it traipses out a series of firefly guitar figures before the roto toms kick and the song guns it into sun showers. It's a shift from light to shadow, tiny to epic, and it bolsters these songs even when the drums aren't banging. ""That Old Sun"" and ""Winter Games"" are sweaty BBQ squealers (The Band! The Allman Brothers!) minus the spillage, frontbrah Matt Popieluch's bronzy vocals a fine match for a mix that always feel controlled, no matter how free or insanely vivid. What's more, Popieluch earns his nonprofit daycheck working in L.A. parks, a job that's sure to build a lyricbook rife with images bright enough to make a dude shield his eyes.</p>
<p>Next to the textural anthemics of ""Vacationing People"", the highlife guitar runs of ""Early Warnings"" anchor a first half every bit as airtight as its comedown second. Closer ""Wait in This Chair"" is easy living, and the final 85 seconds of ""See Us Home"" is the best Coldplay send-off since TV on the Radio snaked a page out of that band's gameplan just last year: gorgeous, wave-of-the-hand melodicism that takes your feet from you better than riptides.

Guitarist Lewis Pesacov and drummer Garrett Ray have been studying and nerding out with these sounds in L.A. clubs for years, equally seamless fruits of which can also be heard in their work with Afro-Hebrew collective Fool's Gold. You can tell that these songs were shaped and sculpted and polished ten times over, the attention to detail and space a welcome step away from the often sloppy clumps of no-fi ruckus clattering up from garages and out of bedrooms everywhere right about now.

For guys who introduced themselves to the world by asking us to be gentle with them, ""angry"" is a relative term. The story of the UK indie pop duo's wonderfully ramshackle 2005 debut, <i>The Best Party Ever</i>, is something like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah without the New York media glare or square-baiting obliqueness: from homemade 7""s to Oscar-night soda commercials, all in a few short years. 2009's <i>The Law of the Playground</i> adds depth, if little breadth, to their near-perfectly realized birthday-party aesthetic, while among the professionally hip, admitting your own insecurities remains as frowned upon as ever.</p>
<p>When your entire band concept is based around identifying with the sensitive but neurotic outcasts, your B-sides better damn well bring your A-game. <i>The Best B Sides Ever</i> doesn't disappoint. Originally bundled with Rough Trade Shop pre-orders for <i>The Law of the Playground</i>, and now available only at independent record stores, this slight but almost wholly satisfying disc is well worth any TBLLT fan's recession-pinched dollar. With two revealing covers and originals that at times rival their A-sides, singer/vocalist Jof Owen and multi-instrumentalist/composer Pete Hobbs keep their hearts precariously on their sleeve and their production colorfully ramshackle. Yup: acoustic guitar, banjo, synths, recorder, xylophone, stuffed-animals-on-parade drums, and whispery singing. Dudes who hate this shit and anything else that smacks of wimpiness, you can buy two and say it's for your sister. Deep down, you're one of us, too.</p>
<p>The covers aren't far from TBLLT's usual territory, but they're expertly enfolded in the group's deceptively childlike universe. Where Limp Bizkit made George Michael's ""Faith"" safe for the moshers, this version emphasizes the song's simple emotions and gold-plated pop craft. There's jauntiness to spare, sure, but little trace of irony. If this ""Faith"" turns chart-pop into twee-pop, then the disc's spare, faithful cover of the Field Mice's ""Between Hello and Goodbye"" could just as easily introduce Sarah Records to the charts. You don't need a tattered collection of 1980s <i>NME</i>s to enjoy simple guitar, heartfelt vocals, twinkling percussion, and a beautifully aching romantic ballad, just ambiguous enough to reward listen after listen. (You do need the Field Mice, though, for your personal enjoyment.)</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the originals shed new light on an established persona, with results that range from the exceptional to the ""mediocre for the Boy Least Likely To"". With a bottom made out of rubber, a top-end made out of snips and snails and puppy-dog tails, ""Oddballs"" falls closer to the latter category, suggesting a name for the CD artwork's fine fuzzy wuzzies but breaking little new ground. Closer ""Cuddle Me"", meanwhile, at first seems like an almost too-literal encapsulation of the group's softer side. Within those watery sound effects and faraway rum-pum-pums, however, is an overwhelming vulnerability that should still be a treat for core indie-pop fans. ""I hurt the things I love/ Because it stops them hurting me,"" Owen sings. If you can relate, you can spend a rainy afternoon daydreaming to this.</p>
<p><i>The Best B-Sides Ever </i>is best when it's tinged with nostalgia. It's a kind of nostalgia that works both ways: Lost childhood becomes a metaphor for lost love on midtempo banjo-synth reminiscence ""Every Grubby Little Memory"", but ""When I Grow Up I Want to Be a Boy Again"" hopes to find the past in the future. While the guitar underneath the latter song's outer-space synth burbles comes perilously close to Sixpence None the Richer's ""Kiss Me"", the vivid imagery of felt-tip pens and first-snow excitement easily wins out. Similarly, ""Rock Upon a Porch With You""-- one of TBLLT's best-ever songs-- looks forward to growing not-so-dignified and old together with a loved one, puttering around ""on the front steps of our sweet retirement home,"" remembering when they still had their own teeth. Don't make these guys get angry.</p></div>"|13332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13332-the-best-b-sides-ever/|7.4|Marc Hogan

""They're here."" While it's not entirely clear what they're on about, there's little doubting that whatever form these radio wars may take, Howling Bells are ready for them. They've just come off a high-profile tour with Coldplay and Snow Patrol, they've got a couple of new videos in the can, and they've chiseled their agreeable sound into the 10 exquisitely produced tracks that comprise <i>Wars</i>; it's telling also that while the Bells' self-titled debut featured a nondescript and utterly forgettable grayscale collage on its cover, the new one puts portraits of the band members front and center (it doesn't hurt any that they're all easy on the eyes). Stylistically, <i>Radio Wars</i> represents a move away from the occasional organ and twang that gave these guys their previous country-noir tag, and finds them dabbling in keyboard-saturated textures and leaning a little more on their 1980s influences. It's still a tad dark, but more the dark of shadows and clouds and thunderstorms than of pitch black night.</p>
<p>The LP offers a formidable opening volley in the form of first track ""Treasure Hunt"", which springs right out of the stereo on a wave of ""bah-bah""s, sci-fi sounds, and ""How Soon Is Now?""-esque helicopter-blade-swirl guitar, never losing its impulse. ""Into the Chaos"" and single ""Cities Burning Down"" emerge as the other standouts here, both crisp, competent, cleanly-structured jams, though neither is nearly as dangerous as its name would have you think. The sugary sweet ""Let's Be Kids"", meanwhile, easily wins the prize for Track Most Likely to Make It Into AIM Away Messages, Facebook Status Updates, and Teen Television Drama Montage Sequences, even if its return-to-innocence sloganeering (""Let's be kids again/ Life was so simple then,"" goes the chorus) is a curious sentiment coming from a band so polished, professional, and, yes, grown up. As for everything else, well... again, it's an agreeable sound the Bells have hit upon, and that makes for an agreeable listen throughout. Plenty of bands have done far worse.</p>
<p><i>Howling Bells</i> was a very agreeable record too, though, and <i>Wars</i> doesn't really improve on its predecessor in any significant regard. Even the aforementioned highlights don't quite shine like their counterparts from last time around: Nothing on the new album swoops quite like ""Velvet Girl"", or soars quite like ""Setting Sun"" (""Chaos"" does come close), or snarls quite like ""Low Happening"". That's okay; <i>Wars</i> also shouldn't put off anyone who loved the first record, and thanks to increased worldwide exposure this time around, it will likely catch the attention of new fans looking to expand their scope of listening outside the present day alt-rock mainstream, but not too far. Sometimes wars are won with persistence and numbers alone, after all. And in any case, when you're cruising along in a pleasure craft as nice and reliable as this one, it's all right to tread a little water.</p></div>"|13278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13278-radio-wars/|6.1|Matthew Solarski

What's more surprising is how mixed the results collected on debut offering <i>Of the Cathmawr Yards</i>-- recorded in large part by Icy Demons' Griffin ""Blue Hawaii"" Rodriguez-- can sometimes be. When Elkington, Bean, and their three Chicago hired guns (cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm, bassist Nick Macri, and drummer Charles Rumback) are on, they're <i>on</i>, and when they're not, well, it can get cloying.</p>
<p>With its lively rhythm section, lush string-playing, and exquisite pacing, ""Asleep in a Waterfall"" falls squarely in the former camp; a summation of the band's strengths and a harbinger of the good things to come on the record's second half. Notably, Bean gets the lead vocal here, with chief lyricist Elkington joining her in harmony for the choruses (more often on <i>Cathmawr Yards</i> it's the other way around). As anyone who has listened to the Zincs can attest, Elkington's lyrics can tend toward the weighty, and letting Bean's lithe voice sing them is one way to counteract this. After slumping for a couple of tracks, <i>Yards</i> picks up again with instrumental ""Liberation"", which sounds like Tortoise traded the cocktail lounge for the front porch and went acoustic. ""The Piss Choir"" keeps the momentum going as the band loosens up, lights up, and jams out, culminating in a delirious dance between Elkington's guitar and Lonberg-Holm's strings. Vocal interplay takes a more interesting turn here as well, with Bean first echoing Elkington's lines, then joining him, both singers sumptuously stretching their syllables. It's pretty smooth sailing from there, right on through the slightly spooky clip-clop of ""Rising Moon"" (the only Bean composition on the record) and barnstorming finale ""Map of Stars"", where noted improvisor Fred Lonberg-Holm gets a chance to just let it rip on the cello. Suddenly a record with a mostly inauspicious start has gone out with a bang that won't soon be forgotten.</p>
<p><i>Catamawr Yards</i>, then, gets better as it gets more adventurous, and it gets more adventurous as it leans more on that backing band. When that's not the case, things can drag, as on ""Wilds Empty Bedroom"". Subsequent track ""Left Hand"" falls into the same plodding tempo trap, salvaged only by Rumback's percussion touch and a guest jazz trumpet bit courtesy of Calexico's Martin Wenk. Indeed, the drumming on this record deserves special mention, and hats should be tipped both to Rumback and Rodriguez for creating and capturing a dynamic percussive sound that goes a long way to distinguish <i>Cathmawr Yards</i> from any number of whisky-soaked, overimaginative acoustic records out there. Instead, the Horse's Ha's post-folk feels right at home amid the legacy of Chicago sonics as innovative as they are pleasing to the ear.</p></div>"|13274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13274-of-the-cathmawr-yards/|6.8|Matthew Solarski

Full of crackling pop-rocks and snapping bottle caps, McGuinness' debut was an irresistible, effervescent piece of juvenilia. A couple of critical years later and he's graduated to more mature themes: sex, love, work, God, old movies, outer space, circuses... well, some of them are more mature, anyway. His songwriting, however, hasn't really made the same incremental progress.</p>
<p>The fresh-scrubbed but worldly wise McGuinness on the cover of his self-titled debut resembles a young John Lennon. But the 22-year old loosely participates in a different British pop tradition-- that of showmen, storytellers, and social commentators like Ray Davies, Paul Weller, Damon Albarn, Jarvis Cocker, and Eddie Argos. It's worth emphasizing the <i>British</i> part of this inheritance, because its wry, witty, oft-ironic observations usually-- for whatever reason-- get lost in translation during the transatlantic crossing. McGuinness can post all the Ramones covers he wants on his <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/eugenemcguinness"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MySpace page</a>, but with his logorrheic wordplay, Vaudevillian sensibility, and distinctly English inflection, he's about as likely to break his forebears' New World curse as Pete Doherty. Even if you're inclined toward high-street level closeups of old Blighty, songs like sashaying barroom-piano number ""Atlas"" or sticky stringed, between-the-wars throwback ""Those Old Black and White Movies Were True"" are little more than genre exercises. McGuinness packs so many retro idioms-- skiffle, Mersey beat, honky-tonk, doo-wop, even ballroom dance rhythms (not to mention the usual punk, pop, and folk conventions)-- into the album's 12 tracks, that he's more star pupil upstaging his peers at a student recital than someone you'd pay a cover charge to see.</p>
<p>McGuinness hasn't entirely misplaced the pop gifts or snake-charming skills hinted at on <i>Early Learnings</i>; even if it's mostly downhill from there, the album's opening triad is clear-focused and engaging. ""Rings Around Rosa"", a short'n'sweet tribute to cradle-robbing, gets things off to a breathless start with its furious strumming and uncaged beats, followed by new-wave singalong ""Fonz"", and delightfully subversive ""Wendy Wonders"", which invites you to cha-cha with ""a fucked-up bastard, a subzero psycho"" and the girl who loves him. But even with two self-titled releases and undeniable charisma, Eugene McGuinness, the artist, is still a little undefined, an intersection of musical vectors rather than a single strong signature. Let's chalk it up to growing pains and watch how early learnings further develop into an adult style.</p></div>"|13100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13100-eugene-mcguinness/|5.8|Amy Granzin

This sort of low-key, lowbrow tunefulness has always been a central component of the Friedbergers' aesthetic, even when they're off on proggy rock opera tangents, splicing their live shows into deliberately jarring sound collages, or roping their grandmother in to sing her own surreal, heavily fictionalized biography. After a half decade of booby-trapping many of their most charming melodies, the Furnaces have come full circle with <i>I'm Going Away</i>, a set of clean, straightforward tunes that, like those on <i>Gallowbird's</i>, would sound terrific playing on a pub jukebox.</p>
<p>Cultish fans may find themselves disappointed by how well-behaved the band sounds on <i>I'm Going Away</i>, but anyone who has been paying attention each step of the way would note this is not a sudden departure or artistic retreat-- it's part of a steady progression. Matthew Friedberger may have jettisoned his impulse to overstuff his compositions with unnecessary leads, but his melodic sensibility remains intact and boldened by streamlined arrangements emphasizing acoustic piano and the crisp, groovy percussion of drummer Robert D'Amico. The difference in this album isn't simply a matter of scaling back and dialing down eccentricities, but in the way the quartet embraces their rhythmic strengths, and subtly integrate elements from old school R&amp;B in tracks like ""The End Is Near"", ""Drive to Dallas"", and ""Keep Me in Dark"" without resorting to pastiche or going against the grain of their established style. Compared to the weirder tracks on <i>Widow City</i> or <i>Bitter Tea</i>, these songs may sound relatively ""normal,"" but there's no confusing this music with anyone else-- the tunes follow familiar Friedbergian patterns, and Eleanor's vocal cadences are as distinct and unmistakable as anyone in contemporary pop this side of Snoop Dogg and Lil' Wayne.</p>
<p>As on <i>Gallowsbird's Bark</i>, Eleanor Friedberger is the primary author of the lyrics on <i>I'm Going Away</i>, and the contrast with her brother's words on their four previous efforts is immediately noticeable. Though both siblings have a taste for packing their verses with tongue-twisters and obscure references, Eleanor's lyrics are far more emotionally direct, revealing, and confrontational. Whereas Matthew's songs lean heavily on skewed fictional narratives that are brilliantly crafted yet emotionally unengaging, the lyrics here are mostly autobiographical first-person accounts of romantic dissolution. Eleanor's words cut deep, but only to a point-- there is sorrow and regret, for sure, but there is also a slight aloofness, implying a character willing to speak her mind but not quite let her guard down.</p>
<p>In some cases, this comes off like a Dylan-esque pose, particularly on the <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>-ish ""Cut the Cake"", but for the most part, the reserved approach to personal revelation is entirely appropriate. This isn't ""confessional"" music, at least not in the way that we often understand that mode of songwriting to be about venting pain and anxiety. This is more about reflection on the past, or even a reconfiguration of memory to make sense of the present tense. This is certainly the case for ""Lost at Sea"", a gorgeous ballad near the end of the sequence that finds Eleanor struggling to understand her reasons for ending a relationship. It's easily one of the Friedbergers' best compositions to date, but also one of the most atypical, as its majestic piano parts recall Elton John's work in the early 70s, and Eleanor's lyrics have an unadorned candor generally lacking in their older work. After six years of songs about everything from cell phone salesmen in the Middle East to being kidnapped by sinister Mormons, there is something refreshing in hearing her sing something as relatable and unpretentious as ""Baby I'm... maybe I'm not me.""</p>
<p>Not every song is so nakedly emotional. A solid third of <i>I'm Going Away </i>sticks to the band's thematic comfort zone, i.e., romanticizing seemingly lost cultural moments from the not-too-distant past. The record starts with the title track, a traditional number arranged by the duo to sound convincingly like one of their originals, and it bows out with ""Take Me Round Again"", a rollicking chorus in rounds that name checks popular songs from the early 20th century, including ""When a Fellow's on the Level With a Girl That's on the Square"", ""The Merry Widow Waltz"", and ""See Saw Margery Daw"". Like most of the duo's body of work, the latter practically demands annotation, and it certainly gains something from a bit of research. Ultimately, it's unnecessary-- the pleasures of ""Take Me Round Again"", like the rest of <i>I'm Going Away</i>, are immediate and unforced. The Fiery Furnaces will always be arty and precious, but they definitely know their way around a good tune. Have a drink and sing along.</p></div>"|13220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13220-im-going-away/|7.8|Matthew Perpetua

As he tipped the bottle, he intermittently updated his thoughts on the taste: ""tart,"" then ""sweet"", then (drunker) ""peanuts"", then, finally, ""ice cream."" Though perhaps not quite the psychedelic experience that is cheap malt liquor, ""Cosmic Mudra"", the first of two long-form drones on Greg Davis' <i>Mutually Arising</i>, functions much the same way: A single, homogeneous substance pours out of your speakers, its effects dependent on how long you've been listening. Tedious at first but, as it progresses, overtones accumulate and bass frequencies begin to shiver, spraying gnarled tones across your living room. It is room-altering, melodic even, however abstractly.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a heap of rockcrit mumbo-jumbo, forgive me: <i>Mutually Arising</i>-- one 29-minute drone and one 22-minute drone-- is unbending and blocky even in the context of experimental composition. Its dearth of complementary sounds and slight instrumentation (its credits, in whole, read: ""Korg mono/poly &amp; crumar stratus analog synthesizers, various effects pedals &amp; computer"") aside, <i>Mutually Arising</i> is a maximal album, totally saturated, and your enjoyment of it may change depending on how much air your stereo/living environment permits you to shove around. At low volumes, <i>Mutually Arising</i> is sleepy and unassuming; high volumes can help unlock the scant few sounds and textures Davis allows to leak.</p>
<p>""Cosmic Mudra"" is the stronger track; it soaks and wiggles, and, if you can maintain attention through its runtime, it will offer some subtle, erudite rewards. ""Hall of Pure Bliss"", its name giggling-ly ironic given that it's not the best track on a two-track album, pans a flat, nasally drone between channels as a slowly pulsing tone sits quietly between them. Two-thirds of the way through, the panning tones drop out and a quiet, somnambulant smudge leads you along as the noise fades to nothing. The track is basically a 22-minute journey from almost nothing to completely nothing, which, as an exercise in restraint for a formally educated musician, might have some value, but it's hardly the most compelling work Davis has turned in.</p>
<p>Sitting in a room and composing half-hour, unflinching drone epics is never a ""normal"" activity. But from an artist who once covered an Incredible String Band song, for one whose collaborations with Sébastien Roux, Jeph Jerman, and Keith Fullerton Whitman have yielded bold, strange fruits, <i>Mutually Arising</i> feels a bit too settled in its own monolithic devices, as if this is the kind of music Davis is supposed to make. Davis has frequently offered more, though, and the brief, off-balance moments of clarity ""Cosmic Mudra"" offers suggest he will in the future as well.</p></div>"|13269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13269-mutually-arising/|5.7|Andrew Gaerig

It's one of the rawest flows to ever go abstract, but in the pieces of grit and gravel that line it you can still hear the meanings clearly. When that voice warns of an upcoming American Holocaust or accuses labels of perpetrating modern-day slavery, you believe it; when it delivers stories of unfair prison bids and deteriorating cities, you feel it. If any member of the Dungeon Family deserves the kind of commercial-slash-artistic breakthrough that made ""Hey Ya"" and ""Crazy"" inescapable, it's him, though getting Khujo to compromise himself to get it is out of the question. He'd need to roll with someone willing to take chances.</p>
<p>Enter Jneiro Jarel, the mind behind borderline-psychedelic underground hip-hop projects like Dr. Who Dat and Shape of Broad Minds-- a man who's been compared to Madlib and Flying Lotus, and a dedicated fan of Khujo's style who previously recruited him for a remix of SoBM single ""OPR8R"". That collaboration succeeded to the point where they decided to create their own surrealist supergroup, situate it in a fictional portmanteau of the two states the artists come from, and experiment with a few forays into underexplored turf. That makes <i>Georgiavania</i> defiant by design, one of those albums where a couple of creative renegades flip out over every stylistic possibility available to them, overextend their ambition, and still come away from it making its missteps sound exciting.</p>
<p>Not that there's a ton of missteps on this album, though-- more like some moments where you kind of wonder what they were thinking, give them marks for effort, and then find some strange appeal in it after the fact. ""The Grussle"" is one of those tracks that immediately slaps you upside the head with how audacious it is-- an Irish country-style fiddle melody combined with a slow-ride Southern bounce groove-- but once the novelty wears off it's easier to focus on its rhythmic slinkiness and how comfortable Khujo sounds in its odd environment. And there's a three-song stretch early in the album-- the gothic new wave ""Loner"", the Tunde Adebimpe-assisted electro-punk ""Gawn Jet"", and the shoegaze doo-wop of ""I Didn't Mean To""-- where Jarel and Khujo go overboard in pushing hip-hop into places most people aren't ready for it to be taken; that they take it somewhere rewardingly unique is worth the risk.</p>
<p>Besides, there's still a bit of familiarity in the songs that touch on Southern-style hip-hop skewed just a little strange, and when that happens, it's an advancement in its own right. Khujo retains much of the same grimy consciousness that he mastered in his Goodie Mob days, championing his work ethic on ""The Grussle"" and snatching your breath with his empathy-stoking class-war struggles on the album-closing ""In the Red"" (""We know talk is cheap and closed mouths don't get fed/ But we starvin' down here, can you spare some bread?""). That Jarel can hang with Khujo on the mic is a pleasant surprise, at least for those who slept on him as just another producer. His Soulja Boy-needling performance on the title track and his doomsaying get-right warnings on ""Prepare Fo It (Spiritual Gladiators)"" follow some of Khujo's most liquid Mach 1 flows on the album, and he holds his own with a subtly Big Boi-ish smoothness that just barely hides some heavy-minded undertones.</p>
<p>With all this envelope-pushing, there'll inevitably be some excursions that don't entirely work. The woozy avant-soul ""Violet Heart Box"" sounds like an analog synth tribute to seasickness, and the spaced-out electrofunk of ""Autopilot"" feels a little weightless in those moments where Khujo's voice isn't there to give the rhythm more backbone. But they're more weird-confusing than weird-bad, and by the time they show up near the end of what's already been a startlingly original album, it's easy to accept failing at the unusual over succeeding at the ordinary. Hip-hop needs more albums willing to be this strange, and hopefully this is the one that gives these two artists some new, hard-earned shine.</p></div>"|13275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13275-georgiavania/|7.7|Nate Patrin

Naming themselves for a defunct European car that valued practicality over style yet was not practical enough (i.e., gas-efficient) to withstand the late-1970s energy crisis, the band announces its interest in the mechanical, the proletariat, and the cruelly ironic. And the title of the self-released CD-R/tape veterans' proper debut for Hardly Art, <i>Lessons in the Woods or a City</i>, hints at the mysterious, primal menace and noisy, urban clamor contained within. Talbot Tagora are disciples of No Age's muddy, muddled punk, but take their psych-drenched sounds out of sunny, smoggy Los Angeles and into the Pacific Northwest, where the metallic clang of big-city life rings out through thick cloud cover and lush, sound-absorbent forests. The glue, then, of their first widely available collection is an echoey sludge that envelops every track, making it sound like the band is bashing away at their instruments from the bottom of a well or conducting a particularly raucous practice underwater.</p>
<p>Songs bleed into one another, as the wiry, high-pitched guitars and flatly thudding drums pervade every track and fade out into blustery dissonance at the end of each song, and lyrics are mostly indistinguishable thanks to their nasal, blunted delivery and the highly distorted microphones the band uses. Only occasionally do you hear a smattering of verbiage-- ""Park your vehicle under Tiger Mountain with the swastikas and the glass all over,"" ""We can choose to go to hell if we want to. Yes, he like's this. He's a masochist,"" ""Break me out of jail""-- that only adds to the sense of sinister aggression that prevails throughout. Talbot Tagora create a dense thicket of tinny guitar riffs (which are too repetitive to be abstract, yet too unstructured or amelodic to be pop), dirty basslines, and jittery, thumping percussion that all-too-often races ahead of the beat so that the other instruments sound like they are breathlessly trying to catch up. There is, therefore, a sameness that saturates the album; no track deviates from the unwavering intensity. And thus, the record is better digested in its entirety, rather than song-by-song.</p>
<p>The uniformity isn't a bad thing, though, and there some tracks that stand out from the rest. ""Johnny Lazor"" gallops along on propulsive, shuffling drums and a distorted walking guitar line that is mimicked in the taunted vocal melody. ""Mouth Rainboy"" is built on ticky-tacky stickwork and churning, churlish guitars, and is one of the few songs that listeners can sing along with since its few lyrics are almost audible and chanted repeatedly. And ""Perception Stick"", with its simplified (and relatively slow) 60s rock beat and dry, monotone boy/girl singing, feels like an homage to Sonic Youth circa <i>Daydream Nation</i>.</p>
<p>The band has a timeless punk set-up of just guitar, bass, and drums, but there is something futuristic about their sound, as the heavy reverb lends a silvery patina to everything from the stabbing guitar lines to the opaque co-ed vocals. And with songs that are raw and antagonistic, yet dreamy and droning, Talbot Tagora fulfill the destiny of their namesake: There is no pretense in their simple arrangements, but you can hear their motor revving, and you know they'll never run out of gas.</p></div>"|13172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13172-lessons-in-the-woods-or-a-city/|6.7|Rebecca Raber

Regardless of the quality of the renditions, what struck me was the illustration of instantaneous influence in 2009 captured in real time-- once even the bigger underground names would have had to fester in obscurity for a while before their presence was felt in a larger context. But as it becomes increasingly easy to record as well as distribute music, it's become increasingly likely that bands that are forming right this second could be heard from six months or a year from now, not only before they've taken the time to establish their own identity, but while their most obvious precedents might still be riding out their last record release cycle.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Our Brother the Native, still teens when signed to the esteemed FatCat imprint. Even if that's like getting an Ivy acceptance letter, they took massive student loans from contemporaries like the Books and especially Animal Collective up-to-and-including-<i>Sung Tongs</i>. <i>Tooth &amp; Claw</i>, their proper debut, was released in 2006, the very, very tail-end of ""freak-folk as an ongoing concern with the indie kids."" It was promising and flawed and in love with its source material, as to be expected, but at least they were on the right track-- it's sort of disingenuous to reward youth qua youth, but likewise, it's tough to pass judgment if you were covering Sponge songs in your garage at the same age (um, not that I'd know).</p>
<p>But with <i>Sacred Psalms</i>, it's hard to shake the idea that maybe that they could've used some time woodshedding with proper songs<i>. </i>These guys love their brassy, ringing textures-- chimes, gamelan, thumb pianos, and the like subsumed by a hazy production veil of buzz and reverb. Problem is, they like them all at the same time, and parsing the clamorous ""Well Bred"" is like trying to pick out individual flavors in a Long Island Iced Tea; get to ""Dusk"" and it's like trying to do the same after five. The album's first half tries to conjure an Elverum-styled sense of naturalist dread with doomy, didgeridoo-like drones, wandering acoustics, and scratchy vocal snippets, and it eventually wafts out of those murky eddies into a nearly dancehall-derived drumbeat. Which is admittedly a neat direction, but the only reason I can't use the term ""momentum-killing"" in regards to its forbidding seven-minute runtime is that there isn't much momentum to kill, by design. Like drum circles or pre-shot-clock NBA games, it's easy to see how lack of structure is freeing to its participants and repellent to its observers.</p>
<p>In Mark Richardson's review of <i>Tooth &amp; Claw</i>, he offered the hope that Our Brother's iffy singing could be fixed with time (or at least a vocal coach), but you have to wonder if they're so enamored with a type of sylvan authenticity that troubleshooting never crossed their minds. This style of music doesn't require a conventional-sounding voice or even a really <i>good </i>one. But while ""Well Bred"" and ""Manes"" have hooks that feel more substantial and stand-alone than any from their debut, even if their appearance gives one the feeling of brief moments of clarity after being roused from a particularly intense siesta. But they're still employed in the same-defeating way, delivered by unpleasantly overwrought Beirut (the band)-via-Baltimore (the scene, ca. 2007) vocals that evoke any number of post-Fugazi emoists rather than catharsis or celebration.</p>
<p>Closer ""Endless Winter"" doesn't totally redeem the 40 minute-investment in <i>Sacred Psalms</i>' nougat-y center, but it does sort of serve as a potential corrective-- it bears plenty in common with what preceded, what with its maundering tempo and multimedia samples (though their pan-Arabic sound brings to mind too much mawkish sound collage from 2002).  But a disarmingly straightforward piano melody stumbles nakedly in and out, by a large margin the most memorable and simple passage on a record that's too strained in voice and in reverence to bands that paved the way with years of bold and blind experimentation before they ended up sounding like <i>themselves </i>(and really, that's the unifying quality of 2009's Indie Big Three). The Deer Tick of freak-folk? Discuss...</p></div>"|13221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13221-sacred-psalms/|4.7|Ian Cohen

In a review of the Songs: Ohia album that gave Molina's Magnolia Electric Co. it's name, Eric Carr chastised a guest singer with, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7333-magnolia-electric-co/"">[H]e's not Molina, whose voice you paid to hear.</a>"" Another Forker, William Bowers, once referred to Molina's voice as an ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5565-pyramid-electric-co/"">occasionally erect vibrato</a>."" Like chalking a pool cue, Molina's distinctive bleat was a hedge against flaws, and even his best, most interesting albums feature many. You know where this is going. That final Songs: Ohia marked not just a stylistic shift for Molina, from doom-folker to classic rocker, but a vocal one as well: The man fell in love with his croon, an even, spread-able tenor, and one that has smoothed the edges of Molina's full-band works with Magnolia Electric Co.</p>
<p>Billed as a comparatively sparse counterpoint to Magnolia's recent classic-rock material, <i>Josephine</i> offered real stimulus for change: a three-year studio-album hiatus, the longest of his career; a move to London for a famous Midwesterner; one more turn with frequent engineer Steve Albini; the December 2007 passing of touring bassist Evan Farrell.</p>
<p>But no. Look no further than ""Whip-poor-will"", which, if you're keeping score at home (Molina's fondness for baseball and for numbers suggests he hopes you are), was the finest of a fine set of outtakes for the aforementioned Magnolia Electric Co. album. Molina's vocals, aided by slight pedal-steel, smooth over one of his finest lyrics to the point of inscrutability. ""Shiloh"", from 2007's <i>Sojourner</i> box set, also receives a new treatment, this one an improvement, but the rehashing is a curious decision for an artist who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35368-magnolia-electric-cos-jason-molina-spills-about-new-album-ijosephinei/"">claims to have recorded six albums</a> since <i>Sojourner</i>. More distressing is that ""Shiloh"" and ""Whip-poor-will"" stand as the best, most resplendent songs on <i>Josephine</i>, the latter's strong-willed confession and subsequent plea to heaven putting to shame Molina's unspecific ramblings about horizons and ""when the fire didn't answer to the flame"" elsewhere.</p>
<p>Molina has cautioned us from reading <i>Josephine</i> as an epitaph for Farrell, and it's just as well: Separating mourning from Molina's usual wistfulness is like trying to parse black and beige grains of sand. The one change <i>Josephine</i> offers is trading <i>Fading Trails</i>' penchant for bombastic guitar for a more varied set of arrangements. ""Little Sad Eyes"" marries Molina's early-years amelodicism to a peppery Hammond organ. Too-short closer ""An Arrow in the Gale"" invites, finally, Molina's bandmates onto a chorus, and they implore the title character (don't go searching hard for a narrative) to ""run run run."" ""The Rock of Ages"" is awkward and a bit hard to take, but it's Molina's first real stab at incorporating 1950s vocal-pop into his songwriting, that era's fascination with teenage tragedy and heartbreak a natural fit for Molina's mythmaking.</p>
<p>So the croon remains, but please don't read this as a love letter to an artist's younger, now-gone days. <i>Josephine</i> is the first Molina album to suggest that he's learned anything more than bombast from those classic rock albums he's been accused of aping. There are real, new stylistic portents here. But <i>Josephine</i> mostly suggests new directions rather than moving in them, and the traceless ache of its muddy middle-third (""Hope Dies Last"", ""The Handing Down"", ""Map of the Falling Sky"") is burdensome.  So we wait, still, but judging by those six albums on the docket, we won't wait long.</p></div>"|13218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13218-josephine/|5.6|Andrew Gaerig

Surprising because it was the sound of two kids, barely 21, playing earnest, noisy folk-rock that ignored nearly every trend in indie music; surprising because it came out of Baltimore, a city whose indie scene-- lead by Dan Deacon and bands like Ponytail-- is publicized for its spasm and flash. Surprising because of the sympathy in Jenn Wasner's lyrics. Most of the songs on the album were about age and domesticity, and most of the time it was impossible to gauge how old or domestic the band was. The character of Wasner's voice flickered between baby bunny and bitter wife, and swelling, muscular moments in the music were as confidently handled as the quiet ones.</p>
<p>If it's not obvious that I sincerely love the band Wye Oak (and not for sentimental reasons), let me clarify that I do-- and so it's with bit lip and heavy heart that I report on <i>The Knot</i>. The record doesn't feel as varied or agile as <i>If Children</i> did--  which is too bad only because<i> If Children</i> proved they could make a varied, agile record. Songs rarely pick up from a crawl. Sustained guitar chords fan out and crush whatever momentum the band gets going. The bursts of distortion that colored <i>If Children</i> are almost pornographically expanded.</p>
<p>It's also about as close to objectively <i>gorgeous</i> music as I can imagine. Drummer Andy Stack's arrangements are integral and imaginative: The big string-section harmonies on ""I Want For Nothing"" practically pry the song open; the unrepentantly rock climax of ""For Prayer"" washes away on the mercurial sound of slide guitars. But dirges like ""Mary Is Mary"" and ""Slight, Flight"" end up serving as measuring sticks for how much pretty is too much pretty-- for me, it's about five minutes. If not five, definitely seven and a half.</p>
<p>Wasner's voice has become more expressive, something I'd noticed during live performances of songs from <i>If Children</i>. There's probably more than one good way to sing the lines, ""Do you never ask because you know I'll say/ You're the only one?""-- ""but you're not the only one,"" but damn if they don't feel like anvils when she drops them.</p>
<p>I mention all their achievements because I feel like Wye Oak is still a young band, still growing, still singular. When I met Jenn and Andy last April, we talked briefly about the reviews for <i>If Children</i>-- one of which I wrote for this site. Jenn said that the numbers didn't matter to them at the moment, and surprisingly, it looked like she meant it. ""The way I see it,"" she said, ""we're going to be doing this for a long time."" Here's hoping.</p></div>"|13219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13219-the-knot/|5.9|Mike Powell

It's also one of the better radio-ready pop records of the last several months, and occasionally a more than adequate (if swivel-troublingly ethereal) dancefloor filler. That's some gap between Acid King and Kelly Clarkson, you know, a challenge the shapeshifting Brooklyn collective Lights meet at nearly every turn; pure, pretty pop rubs elbows with fistpump fodder in the same song, occasionally intermingling but never interfering. That kind of swift and changeable movement between genre means just about every sound they touch on, they can handle. And it's some list.</p>
<p>Take if you will ""Heavy Drops"", a sprawling, Dean Wareham-jamming-with-Pink-Floyd slow-burner with a supple, slightly sour, country-tinged melody. Or ""Can You Hear Me?"", equal parts Bobby Womack, the Spice Girls, ""Stillness Is the Move"", <i>Rumours</i>, and ""Baker Street"". Shades of the Everly Brothers and Lucinda Williams' better ballads color the multipart ""Love""; well, the parts that aren't in waltz time, anyhow. ""Hold On"" imagines PJ Harvey as Neil Young, while ""Fire Night"" takes DFA style disco funk to Paris for the evening. I could go on, but unlike music writing that delights in reference dropping for its own sake, <i>Rites</i>' fluidity of motion keeps things from getting awkward and self-congratulatory. That ""Fire Night"" crackles out just seconds before ""We Belong"" trickles in seems the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>Guitarist Sophia Knapp and drummer Linnea Vedder, who share lead vocal duties, are blessed with pipes so well matched you might wonder if they're related. Though equally strong on their own, moments where both share the mic seem stolen, each voice coiling around the other before heading skyward. They're great screamers, too, as the louder moments prove; nowhere is this clearer than on ""War Theme"", where nonsense words meet some very serious, fuzzed up rock'n'roll. As riff-rockers, the taut, bottom-heavy Lights would inspire lighters; as balladeers, they're ready for your swoons now. The compositions are assured, but never overly busy; just as it takes some serious work to map out a builder like ""Love"" or ""Can You Hear Me?"", it takes some pretty solid musicians to stay out of the way of a melody as bloody gorgeous as the one at the heart of ""Nothing Left to Build"". And while not all the ideas are good ones-- the waltz around ""Love"" is awkward and the Fleetwood Mac cover that closes out the record is pointless-- there's certainly no shortage.</p>
<p>What's most interesting about <i>Rites</i> is what happens when a little snippet of one idea seems to land atop something else altogether. Take ""Love"", which has all the spindly melody of an Aimee Mann tune, but eventually breaks into an ""ooh-hoo, yeah"" you could build a Jessica Simpson song around. Or ""Hold On"", which starts out screaming and winds up cooing like Emmylou Harris singing with Hawkwind. Good as Lights seem to be moving between one idea and the next, they're at their best when they're stuck between the two, and I only wish there were a little bit more making nice between the bits that rumble and the ones that unfurl a little more slowly. It's this that makes <i>Rites</i> just a little more boring than it oughta be; there's not a lot of middle ground between the thumpers and the swayers, and while the ballads are well-hewn and plenty lovely, when interspersed with the rockers, they do mess with momentum a bit.</p>
<p>A fondness for either Sleep or the Spinanes won't necessarily make <i>Rites</i> for you; not many doom metal records take the occasional cue from <i>Bachelor #2</i>, and unless you've got strong feelings for both, enjoying <i>Rites</i> means making room for either. That's what's so great about it, though; save the Vaseline-on-lens Fleetwood Mac number that closes things out, there's nary a dull patch or an awkward spot to be found here, just a sublime (if sorta schizoid) trip through the warmest, spaciest parts of your record collection.</p></div>"|13321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13321-rites/|7.7|Paul Thompson

As a result, Americans grow up with a distorted view of Syria, seeing it as a satellite orbiting the Axis of Evil and a regional bully with little regard for, say, the lives of ordinary Lebanese people. And at least as far as its government is concerned, there's some truth to that image. Bashar Al-Assad wouldn't exactly be cover material for <i>Democracy &amp; Human Rights Magazine</i>, if such a publication existed, but behind him and his cohort there's a whole Syria we never get to see, a place of abundant entrepreneurial spirit and immense cultural heritage spanning millennia-- Syria is the railing on the cradle of civilization.</p>
<p>In the country's agricultural Northeast lies the city of Hassake (also transliterated Al-Hasakah and several other ways). It's a sizable town, but it's also a bit out of the way, straddling a tributary of the Euphrates that spends part of the year as a muddy wadi and hugging the inner curve of the Fertile Crescent. The population is a mix of Kurds, Assyrians, and Syrian Arabs, and it's no surprise the area produced a potent musical amalgam. That's what the music of Omar Souleyman is-- a modernized blend of old musics that collide in the modern Middle East. He draws from Kurdish and Turkic music, Iraqi choubi, and the dabke, a broad regional Arab folk style that grew out of a celebratory line dance developed by Levantine builders seeking an efficient way to stamp down the materials used to make a wattle-and-daub roof.</p>
<p>The future-past implications of the title <i>Dabke 2020</i> could hardly be more perfect for describing Souleyman's wild, buzzing Arab New Wave. This disc compiles music recorded between 1998 and 2008 and released on cassette in Syria, and builds on Sublime Frequencies' first Souleyman compilation, 2007's <i>Highway to Hassake</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, which was reissued on vinyl this year</span>. It opens with its least party-worthy track, ""Atabat"", named for its style of sung poetry. Souleyman cries out in the melismatic Arabic mawaal style and is answered alternately by soulful saz solos and a blistering, progged-out synthesizer. The synthesizer's nasal tone takes center stage on the next track, blazing over the machine-gun drum programming-- for a lot of Western listeners, that wall of sharp-toned, constantly fluttering synth will be a little too much to take. If you're not already used to Arabic pop music, Souleyman is bound to be something of an acquired taste.</p>
<p>That said, there are a couple of tracks that don't require much acclimatization, including the two that close the record. ""Laqtuf Ward Min Khaddak (I Will Pick a Flower From Your Cheek)"" has a rhythm track like a hyperspeed Middle Eastern ""Knight Rider"" theme, and the dust storm swirl of synthesizer uses a mellower tone that's a sympathetic companion for Souleyman's husky baritone. Closer ""Kaset Hanzal (Drinking From the Glass of Bitterness)"" nearly brings things full circle to ""Atabat"" with its slow organic percussion and mixture of roughly scraped violin and synthesizer. Western listeners with a keen sense of audio adventure should have no problem feeling the groove of Souleyman's future folk and should take <i>Dabke 2020</i> as what it is: a chance to know the music of a people politics has long kept at arm's length.</p></div>"|13114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13114-dabke-2020-folk-and-pop-sounds-of-syria/|7.4|Joe Tangari

It helps, because regular rock'n'roll adjectives-- gritty, spirited, haunted-- describe their presence but fail to provide a sense of their unique throwback hop. So let's be clear: Normally when a reviewer says a band ""does not let any genre define them,"" they mean simply that no single genre properly describes the band. When I say it with regard to the Pine Hill Haints, and their new record <i>To Win or to Lose</i>, it means that the Haints have managed to weld a recognizable style from these genres with the style and precision of a band with a much larger profile. <i>To Win or to Lose</i>, the band's second album on K Records, marks their boldest effort yet, mostly abandoning the playful, deflective subject matter of previous albums for bold, scattered character-making. The shift, however subtle, is successful because the Haints maintain not only their brittle, rock grooves but also their sense of humor, companionship, and identity, such that no one ever mulls whether the Alabama quintet has ""matured"" or some such other nonsense.</p>
<p>The beautifully recorded <i>To Win or to Lose</i> (engineered by Lynn Bridges) greets each of the Haints' many instruments-- accordions washboard, saw, bucket-- with ample space and warmth. On previous albums the band has relied on lead Haint Jamie Barrier's spindly electric riffing to carry their rhythms, but here Barrier limits himself mostly to small percussive slashes (an exception: listen to his guitar twirl gracefully in the fires of ""Not So Lucky and the Invisible Kid""), freeing your attention for the mulling bass tones, painted drum work, and, most prominently, accordion.</p>
<p>Overselling the originality would be a mistake. At any given moment you will recognize the DNA of a Haints song, and, were you to have a broad definition of ""folk"" or even maybe ""Appalachian"" music, you could slap a word on it, but the arrangements are clever and eerie. My cat jumped at the hot-plate bass that carries the minimal, clacking ""Revenge of the Spider-Web Boy"". Note the trebly, tropical mandolin of ""Bordello Blackwidow""; shiver and strut with the spectral guitars of ""Screaming Jenny"". <i>To Win or to Lose</i> brims with these ear-pricks, which spice the Haints' traditional minute-long spitfires and buy them time for their mostly new exploration of longer compositions like ""Never Cry"" and ""Doublehead"".</p>
<p>The songs are propped up by the scarred vocals of Barrier, but his voice isn't Waits-ian or ""damaged""; he's merely adept at coughing out phrases in suggestive and unexpected ways. He seems increasingly interested in characters, and he can be blockily poetic. During ""Never Cry"", he speaks of a roving band of ""fair-weather friends"" who stick around only when it's warm out. On ""My Bones Are Gonna Rise Again"", another vocalist, Matt Bakula, notes, ""Her lips were frosty as a root-beer mug."" The bratty sing-song hooks of ""My Bones"" or ""Never Cry"" provide the type of in-your-ear footholds that the Haints albums have lacked in the past.</p>
<p>To callback the album title's sentiment: to win, mostly. The Haints have always nipped at their own sound. On <i>To Win or to Lose</i> they find it, each of their deftly carved instruments aimed like pistols at your heels.

And each time, there was a reason to emphatically answer  ""no,"" whether it was <i>() </i> and its extraterrestrial fragility, <i>Takk</i>'s advance into verdant  pop forms, the <i>Hvarf/Heim </i>curtain-reveal, and then last year's <i>Með  suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust</i>at least had ""Gobbledigook"" going  for it.</p>
<p>But after ""Gobbledigook""  hinted at surprisingly concise melodic smarts (as well as a dialogue  with American indie trends), most of <i>Með </i> feasted on their most overcooked arrangements yet, leaving the listener  to wonder whether Sigur Rós had much desire or incentive to really mess  with a sound that made them arguably the most successful post-rock act  of all time.  <i>That </i>issue is one that could ostensibly be  resolved by Jonsi Birgisson's Riceboy Sleeps project, recorded with his musical and romantic partner, Alex Somers.  Depending on how you  look at it, by that measure, <i>Riceboy Sleeps </i> can be considered a defiant statement, doing a full-on cannonball into  <i>Pure Moods</i> bubble bath: Birgisson and Somers keep the lush orchestration  and elastic song lengths of Sigur Rós, but break rank by all but eliminating  rock-based textures and structures, and most startlingly, the iconic  part of the band's sound-- Jonsi's own voice.</p>
<p>I'll be quite honest: When  I first tried to tackle this thing as a whole, I fucking hated it.    That's not really the response a record that goes so far out of its  way to sooth should elicit.  But regardless of Eno, Stars of the  Lid, and Mountains being a staple of a listener's balanced diet, you  always run that risk approaching ambient music while otherwise being  in the verse/chorus mindset.  But what struck me as most frustrating  about 20 minutes in was just how indecisive it sounds about its ambience-- too deconstructed, patient, and ethereal to really qualify as pop music  obviously.  But it's also too ostentatious (is the average track length  of eight and a half minutes <i>really </i> earned?) and well, <i>loud </i>to even fit the bill as background music,  the dynamics static and nearly suffocating. Brevity is the soul of wit  and all, but then again, Jonsi's never really been known for his sense  of humor.</p>
<p>Despite being recorded entirely  on acoustic instruments, much of <i>Riceboy</i>'s components will  be familiar to those experienced with Birgisson's previous work: the  guest appearances from string group Amiina, melodic passages composed  on piano but drifting in gusts of reverb like windchimes, choirs that  are used as much for texture as they are for melody.  That compilation  hardly needed a breather, but amidst the tracks that only hinted at  texture, ""Happiness"" played like a nine-minute sweep of a cool palm  across a sweaty brow.  Perhaps it's the familiarity or just its  presence as the first track that makes it the relative entry point or  ""accessible"" single, but regardless of how resolute and patient  the chording is, ""Happiness"" finds itself to be comparatively more  form-fitting than what surrounds it.</p>
<p>Considering that <i>Riceboy Sleeps</i> is also a 52-page, wordless book by Somers and Birgisson, as well as  a visual project, there's the idea that, yes, you're really not  meant to swallow this thing whole unless you want to feel like a goose  on its way to pâté status by funneling indulgent but indistinct sweeteners.   Broken down into (relatively) manageable seven-to-eight minute chunks,  one can summon up the patience to drift along.  There's no <i>percussion </i> per se on <i>Riceboy Sleeps</i>, but nice touches of percussive sound--  the rock tumbler-like samples on ""Indian Summer"", which recalls the  understated and underrated work of Helios.  Within the span of nine minutes instead of the robust 68, it's easier to look forward  to the choir sighs of ""Atlas Song"", the occasional wave of distortion  and static of ""Stokksyri"", and even the curiosity of ""Boy 1904"",  containing a recording of the last castrato.</p>
<p>In the end, the question surrounding <i> Riceboy Sleeps </i>recalls that of similarly unwieldy and user-dictated  content from Flaming Lips' <i>Zaireeka </i> to Nine Inch Nails' <i>Year Zero</i>-- is it worthwhile to evaluate  a recorded document based on how the listener is <i>most likely </i> to experience it?  Put together, <i>Riceboy Sleeps </i> is an admirable, intensely personal labor of love from a guy who's  risking risibility by the mere matter of including the word ""sleep""  in its title, and although ""Daníell in the Sea"" and ""All the Big  Trees"" do little remarkable on their own merits, when combined with  the arresting videos found on the Riceboy Sleeps website, you start  to understand its motivation more thoroughly.  And really, as long  as you don't give it your undivided attention, <i>Riceboy Sleeps </i> can keep you company in your cubicle or gridlock traffic, though I realize  that's not exactly as riveting as ""if there's one ambient album  you own this year...!""  But in a necessarily faceless artistic  milieu, a Sigur Rós Stamp of Approval might make that the case anyway.</p></div>"|13328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13328-riceboy-sleeps/|5.3|Ian Cohen

It emphasizes dynamic action, feelings of speed, impressions of light-- extremes and intricacies of sensation. It tweaks your senses with creative deformations of time and space, with strictly engineered frameworks lurking beneath sleek or gaudy facades. And as Simon Reynolds credibly argued in <i>Energy Flash/Generation Ecstasy</i>, it strives to create experiences instead of describing them. Doesn't it sound a lot like the state fair, and make it seem crazy that tinny speakers still blast mostly rock, rap, and country hits across the rides? Imagine Lindstrøm's slopes and plunges on your roller coaster; the Field's nested spins on the Tilt-A-Whirl.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In an obscure corner of the midway, Chris Clark mans the funhouse. He lays out certain conditions-- dark twisty passageways, treacherous stairs, and moving platforms-- but doesn't suggest that you experience them in any particular way. His songs are divided into bizarre chambers of clashing design. He's the rare case where a heavy-handedly metaphorical approach like this seems defensible. In interviews, Clark holds forth at length on process and ideas while neatly sidestepping taxonomical points. He has his go-to tricks: His specialty is the cataclysmic anthem, cobbled together from homemade break beats, glitchy jags of Euro- and acid-house, pockets of concussive noise, honeycombed synth lines, and contoured masses of distortion, all piled up in lunging heaps of coarse texture. He really doesn't seem to make any <i>type </i>of music, which means that there's no background proposition or guideline, and metaphor might be the only way to talk about it. As in the funhouse, you have to make your own way through.</p>
<p>We enter an unspoken contract with the funhouse: To be tripped, mocked, and have our skirts looked up in a spirit of good-natured mischief. It's the same with Clark, and at his best, he honors it. His greatest record, 2006's exquisitely convulsed <i>Body Riddle</i>, was full of spaces as deeply habitable as they were impossible. It was an alchemist's album-- violent where it naturally should have been tranquil (and vice-versa); corporeal where it should have been cerebral (ditto). The acid squelches of ""Herzog"" were weirdly serene and grounding, their ambient atmosphere charged with live-wire menace. It was, unquestionably, his most humane album. But the same body Clark celebrated in 2006 was trampled under the war-tank treads of last year's <i>Turning Dragon</i>, a fascinating but dyspeptic album that it's difficult to imagine anyone wanting to listen to very often.</p>
<p>As on <i>Turning Dragon</i>, Clark's tricks are all in place on <i>Totems Flare</i>, but the abstracts that made <i>Body Riddle </i>great are spottily present. It lacks a certain tenderness or reticence, and there's no implication of a compact with the listener, an assurance that this inhospitable space is ultimately for their pleasure. Put it this way: You would probably decline to ride a roller coaster designed by the Clark of this album, not trusting that its promise of danger wouldn't be taken to its logical conclusion, the car separating from the tracks. <i>Totems Flare</i> regains a measure of hospitality from its predecessor, but it brings only one new idea to the table-- Clark's singing, which is only partially effective. It works pretty well when he pitches his deep, roughshod voice toward dilapidated grandeur: ""Growls  Garden"" imagines Matthew Dear's <i>Asa Breed </i>as interpreted by Thomas Brinkmann. But his cyber-Teutonic turn on ""Rainbow Voodoo"" is a bit silly.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Clark's voice works best when he uses it like just another sound source; say, as a stuttering, FX-laden pulse in ""Look Into the Heart Now"". Your attention is drawn to details like this because the compositions often feel under-imagined as songs. The aforementioned tracks make the first half of the album feel jumbled and cluttered. The fizzy syncopation of opener ""Outside Plume"" is enticing, but its lumbering synths and beat-dropping tangents thwart its momentum. Things do start coming together after the utilitarian vamp ""Luxman Furs"": ""Totem Crackerjack"" uses gusts of noise to enhance, not derail, its cadence, and has a confidently measured stride that carries it intelligibly from breakneck drums to delicate arpeggios. The home stretch has a satisfying continuity-- the revved-up but beatific ""Future Daniel"" runs into the rewinding ambiance of ""Primary Balloon Landing""; the dark drive of ""Talis"" and ""Suns of Temper"" dissolves into the gentle guitar whorls of closer ""Absence"". That's how funhouses are supposed to work-- we know the chaos is an illusion, designed for our enjoyment by an orderly hand. Otherwise, they're just confusing and enervating.</p></div>"|13268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13268-totems-flare/|5.9|Brian Howe

Their last two widely distributed albums, 2004's <i>Burned Mind</i> and 2006's <i>Human Animal</i>, came out on Sub Pop and got lots of media attention, even landing the band on the cover of <i>The Wire</i>. Three years later, Wolf Eyes return with <i>Always Wron</i><i>g</i>, a follow-up of sorts after reams of smaller-run releases. It came out on Hospital in May, and I can't find a single review beyond a few blog entries and tweets. Even <i>The Wire</i> hasn't mentioned it.</p>
<p>This probably doesn't matter much to John Olson, Nate Young, and Mike Connelly, and it shouldn't. The workman-like Michigan trio keeps plugging along, crafting massive textures, severe sonics, and daunting tension from all kinds of sources. They must be happier back among their brethren (Hospital is run by their comrade Dominick Fernow of Prurient) than on Sub Pop, but ultimately they must not care much about who pays attention. If they did, they'd smooth out their aggressive, uncompromising noise.</p>
<p>As <i>Always Wrong </i>shows, such change is not an option. Wolf Eyes long ago internalized buzzing static, piercing screams, and crashing cacophony-- basic elements as essential to the band's vocabulary as finger picking is to John Fahey's, or violin drone is to Tony Conrad's. In fact, the most impressive thing about the band at this point in their career is how instantly identifiable their unruly noise is. Reference points remain, such as the industrial bombast of Throbbing Gristle, the gothic dirge of Swans, and the sheer extremity of Whitehouse. But Wolf Eyes now speak their own language exclusively.</p>
<p>On <i>Always Wrong</i>, that language is more literal, at least verbally. Young's vocals are less buried in the mix than before, and his lyrics are not only discernible, they're even printed in the CD booklet. This gives the band the feel of a post-apocalyptic jazz trio, with Young playing snarling bandleader to Olson and Connelly's destructive anti-rhythm section. ""All I want is what I see,"" he moans with a Johnny Rotten-like sneer on opener ""Cellar"", spitting into the surrounding noise until it rises up and drowns him. On ""Living Stone"", he slobbers like a stunned David Yow over a mesh of screech and rattle, while the subtly-titled ""We All Hate You"" is practically a voice-percussion duet between Young and a construction-site beat.</p>
<p>The increased clarity of Young's vocals accompanies a shift in the band's flow. Where <i>Burned Mind</i> and <i>Human Animal</i> relied on cycles of tension and release, alternating sparse lurch with slamming bombast, <i>Always Wrong</i> is more interested in constant build. You won't find many fist-pump moments here, but that doesn't mean the band has abandoned crescendos-- more that the album itself is one elongated climax.</p>
<p>Such descriptions may make the album seem musical, and in relative terms it is. But Wolf Eyes remain as confrontational and forbidding as ever. Take the title track, which bears the rhythmic remnants of a demolished hardcore jam, but to the uninitiated will sound more like a broken hearing test than a song. Yet for anyone attuned to the subtle differences between each overloaded whine, harrowing clang, and psychotic drone, <i>Always Wrong</i> offers a lot to lose your mind in.</p></div>"|13320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13320-always-wrong/|7.4|Marc Masters

Though their 2006 record <i>Drowaton</i> proved a mastery of their niche-- if you're in the market for an excellent facsimile of early David Bowie, by all means seek out the standout track ""Seventeen Devils""-- it also indicated that the group's songwriter Allan Vest was running out of ideas, save for adding yet more layers to his already lush and overstuffed arrangements. As its title implies, <i>Change Remains</i> is a clear turning point for the band, but weirdly, also something of a holding pattern. Though Vest has downplayed his string section in favor of emphasizing white boy funk akin to MGMT's singles or an off-brand Of Montreal, his songs are marked by a stiff fussiness that neutralizes even his best grooves.</p>
<p>Taken at face value, the melodic bass lines that serve as the basis for the songs on <i>Change Remains</i> are above average, and Vest's instincts as a composer are pretty good. The problem here is not in the writing, but in the execution: The bass parts seem too flimsy and fragile for actual dancing, and most of them come off like pain-stakingly crafted replicas of funk hooks intended strictly for display purposes. This isn't always a problem-- ""Sesame (Untie the Wrath)"" and ""Zoomba"" have enough juice in their grooves to at least inspire some half-hearted swaying during headphone listening-- but it's hard to shake off the sense that Vest is not yet fully comfortable working in this mode. Many great songs play up tightness at the service of body-moving funk, but too much of this music sounds more uptight than taut, and the general vibe of the record is like being invited to a house party in which the host hovers around the room, terrified that a guest may spill some beer on their carpeting.</p>
<p>Starlight Mints may be foregrounding their rhythm section, but they still shine the brightest when they fall back on their strengths as an orchestral pop outfit. The string accents in ""Sesame"" and ""Black Champagne"" are by far the most exciting and appealing textures in their respective arrangements, and ""40 Fingers"", a goofy number that could have fit in easily on their debut album, betrays a natural confidence lacking in the flat-footed beats of tracks like ""Natural"" and ""Power Bleed"".</p>
<p>This is not to say the band should have stayed within its comfort zone. There are good ideas all over <i>Change Remains</i>, but the band does not fully connect with its own material. There is a good possibility that these songs may come to life in the context of a live performance, or more likely, that this work is the necessary first step towards more effective and refined versions of similar ideas on future records. Ideally, Vest should work towards finding a happy medium between the generous melodicism of his earlier records, and the physicality of this music. It may be best to think of <i>Change Remains</i> like a failed attempt to cook a new dish from scratch: This first try may have turned out bland and overcooked, but with a few adjustments, the next batch may yield something rather wonderful.</p></div>"|13097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13097-change-remains/|4.6|Matthew Perpetua

Yes, it has parameters. It includes growling vocals, blastbeats, and riffs that ideally should sound like murder. No, it is not all metal that is abrasive, a shorthand laymen often employ. Out of metal's many subgenres, death metal sounds the biggest and most masculine. That's neither positive nor negative. The music has simply evolved that way since Death and Possessed pushed thrash to harder, faster extremes in the late 1980s. Hear enough death metal, and one will recognize it, even ""get it,"" without needing a definition. (Most music is like this.)</p>
<p>Suffocation have had that feeling from the start. Formed 20 years ago in Long Island, the band has never let up. Suffocation are unique in death metal for being technical without sacrificing atmosphere. Many metal bands are more fleet-fingered than Suffocation. But generally, the more musical gymnastics a band undertakes, the less edge it has. Death metal pioneers like Obituary and Asphyx sounded evil as hell with riffs children could play. The genre does achieve a certain rush sometimes by flinging thousands of notes at the listener. But Suffocation remain one of the few bands to do so well. Their secret? Not playing too fast. Sure, drummer Mike Smith whips up a mighty storm. But it's not so fast that he loses power. He is renowned for inventing a style that involves hitting snare, hi-hat, and kick drum all at once. Essentially, Smith turns his kit into a jackhammer. His bandmates gear up and down with him in perfect synchronicity. Suffocation are like a gigantic vehicle with a very rough ride.</p>
<p><i>Blood Oath</i> best crystallizes Suffocation's formula. The band has finally gotten production that's powerful yet clear. Subpar sound has hampered much of Suffocation's career. Here all the instruments are balanced and legible. Frank Mullen's growls are surprisingly understandable. Once again he spews tales of madness, megalomania, and paranoia. Suffocation still evoke a bunch of guys jamming together because there's nothing else to do in Long Island. They just got really good at their instruments. Tracks like ""Images of Purgatory"" and ""Cataclysmic Purification"" are not songs so much as battering rams. Yet they often bleed bursts of melody-- keening, upper-register laments. These drape atmosphere over the downtuned bulldozing underneath. Terrance Hobbs' axe rips out big hunks of riffs. Warm, thick lines flow from bassist Derek Boyer like blood from a large animal. Suffocation have many imitators; an entire metal subgenre, deathcore, essentially rips them off with a commercial slant. But nothing substitutes for the original. It's not new and improved so much as older, bigger, and a hell of a lot stronger.</p></div>"|13331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13331-blood-oath/|7.7|Cosmo Lee

Since all jj choose to show of themselves is their music, video, and occasional blood-spattered merch, then those Sincerely Yours catalogue numbers represent the sum total of what we know about them. Hell, we wouldn't even know jj were a ""them"" had the group's Gothenburg, Sweden-based, Tough Alliance-owned label not confirmed that. So... they're mysterious-- but not inscrutable: Despite a brief discography that's already geekily byzantine enough for anybody who ever bought into the legend of Factory Records, jj's full-length debut is as easy to enjoy as whatever the last CD was you brought home with a giant cannabis leaf on the cover. They're as naive as they are cynical-- or is it the other stupid way around?-- and they manage to be pretty, touching, funny, and motivating, in different ways, in all the right places, for nine songs lasting 28 minutes.</p>
<p>You don't need me to tell you for the 128th time (320th if you're at CD quality) how digital file distribution has spread sounds and ideas across the globe during the current decade, and jj have earned a place among the current wave of pop globalization, sharing both the island sounds and sticky-fingered irreverence of their labelmates the Tough Alliance, Air France, and the Honeydrips. Sure, jj still carry traces of iconic twee label Sarah Records, but they celebrate a broader definition of ""pop"". Sometimes, as on ""Lollipop""-biting slo-mo raver ""Ecstasy"", jj do this by borrowing from global hip-hop culture. But they also participate. Never by straight-up rapping, but by expanding the reach of ambient music-- defined expansively, as Brian Eno once did, as music that ""suggests, a place, a landscape, a soundworld which you inhabit""-- to include a whole new kind of swagger. ""Of course there is people out to get me,"" a female vocalist sings on ""My Hopes and Dreams"" as hand percussion evokes the Avalanches' beach blowouts, hypnotic guitar recalls German <i>Kosmiche Muzik</i>, and gusts of winds whistle over high-noon Ennio Morricone strings.</p>
<p>Then again, on the same song, jj's singer just wants ""someone to share my hopes and dreams with""-- a humbler goal to be sure, but jj excel just as much at strummy intimacy as they do at lavish blissouts. The lo-fi hooks on ""Tell It to My Heart""-biting closer ""Me &amp; Dean"" suggests TTA's aching teen-pop cover ""Lucky"", only done as an original this time. The pisstake-y giggles also make you wonder if you're hearing their mixtape outro.</p>
<p>When jj drift closer to early-1990s ambient-house, they still allow emotion to flood through the textures, and they never start repeating themselves. Opener ""Things Will Never Be the Same Again"" sets almost new-agey strings and Enya-esque sailing imagery to a bouncy Caribbean rhythm: ""I close my eyes and remember/ A place in the sun where we used to live."" For all the flickering synths and rainforest percussion of ""Masterplan"", we also get <i>Top Gun</i> guitar rocketry, faux-innocent-as-Disney sing-song, and that reporter guy from YouTube going, ""I'm dyin' in this fucking country-ass fucked-up town."" <i>jj n° 2 </i>may be easy on the ears, but it isn't wallpaper.</p>
<p>At their most ideal, ambient, hip-hop, punk, and the most crassly commercial pop all have in common an ""anything goes"" approach. Like any ideal, this usually gets fucked up pretty fast. ""New Age"" harnesses ambient's chill-out pleasantness to eco-politics and yuppie mysticism; old rappers start dissing younger rappers for not following in their footsteps or being more socially conscious; the punk and indie traditions become as idol-worshiping as the classic-rockers they sought to displace. jj obliterate that bullshit and get back to a place where Lil Wayne can be ambient, and Enya can show up on an album with a pot leaf on the cover.</p>
<p>Free mp3 ""From Africa to Málaga"", on some days my favorite track on the album, is almost as suited for a cruise-ship commercial as Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life"". But it also faces Important Ideas like death and art with the clear-eyed precocity of an adolescent, riding in on trade winds with a message that could speak to middle-school cheerleaders and middle-aged soccer moms and middlebrow-loathing former punks alike: ""The thought that you found/ Takes you to town/ Smashes your face/ Burns out your heart/ Then you go home and turn it into art."" Pop's just fine, too, thanks.</p></div>"|13326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13326-jj-n-2/|8.6|Marc Hogan

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ty Segall's self-titled debut was released last year on Castle Face Records, the label run by Jon Dwyer of Thee Oh Sees. His follow-up, <i>Lemons</i>, is out just a few months later on Memphis-based Goner Records, run by the Oblivians' Eric Friedl. Pretend his next one is out on Siltbreeze and it's not hard to triangulate Segall's sound. His short, sharp songs peal out of the garage without raising the doors, sending 1960s rock riffs crashing through splintered, smart-ass lo-fi buzz. After spending time in San Francisco's the Traditional Fools, Segall went way solo, playing early shows all by himself: Alone on stage, he strummed a beat-up guitar, howled his lyrics, and worked a kickdrum with a tambourine duct-taped to it. He has recently started playing with a band, but still believes that all a song really needs is whatever one person can strike, strum, sing, or shake.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This no-fuss, no-frills DIY philosophy defines both of his albums, but especially the rough-and-tumble <i>Ty Segall</i>. It actually sounds like the product of one man, all the instruments he could carry, and an hour's worth of studio time. It kicks off with the guitar and tambourine strut of ""Go Home"", with Segall's vocals drenched in harsh reverb that doesn't conceal but enhances the song's concise melodies. He's enamored with 60s pop rhythms, so you could conceivably do the Shag or the Mashed Potato to ""The Drag"" or ""So Alone"". But his is a limited, limiting set-up, and at times his run-throughs sound obligatory. He apes Jon Spencer aping Elvis Presley on ""Pretty Baby (You're So Ugly)"", saving the song only with a breakneck distortion chorus. Ultimately, <i>Ty Segall</i> sounds like a test run, a document of an artist discovering what all he can do by himself, which makes moments like the whistled outro on ""Watching You"", so reminiscent of Sergio Leone, all the more endearing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Musically and chronologically, <i>Ty Segall</i> and <i>Lemons</i> make a good pair, not only because together they add up to about 50 minutes, but because the latter builds confidently on the experiments of the former.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ty Segall's self-titled debut was released last year on Castle Face Records, the label run by Jon Dwyer of Thee Oh Sees. His follow-up, <i>Lemons</i>, is out just a few months later on Memphis-based Goner Records, run by the Oblivians' Eric Friedl. Pretend his next one is out on Siltbreeze and it's not hard to triangulate Segall's sound. His short, sharp songs peal out of the garage without raising the doors, sending 1960s rock riffs crashing through splintered, smart-ass lo-fi buzz. After spending time in San Francisco's the Traditional Fools, Segall went way solo, playing early shows all by himself: Alone on stage, he strummed a beat-up guitar, howled his lyrics, and worked a kickdrum with a tambourine duct-taped to it. He has recently started playing with a band, but still believes that all a song really needs is whatever one person can strike, strum, sing, or shake.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This no-fuss, no-frills DIY philosophy defines both of his albums, but especially the rough-and-tumble <i>Ty Segall</i>. It actually sounds like the product of one man, all the instruments he could carry, and an hour's worth of studio time. It kicks off with the guitar and tambourine strut of ""Go Home"", with Segall's vocals drenched in harsh reverb that doesn't conceal but enhances the song's concise melodies. He's enamored with 60s pop rhythms, so you could conceivably do the Shag or the Mashed Potato to ""The Drag"" or ""So Alone"". But his is a limited, limiting set-up, and at times his run-throughs sound obligatory. He apes Jon Spencer aping Elvis Presley on ""Pretty Baby (You're So Ugly)"", saving the song only with a breakneck distortion chorus. Ultimately, <i>Ty Segall</i> sounds like a test run, a document of an artist discovering what all he can do by himself, which makes moments like the whistled outro on ""Watching You"", so reminiscent of Sergio Leone, all the more endearing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Musically and chronologically, <i>Ty Segall</i> and <i>Lemons</i> make a good pair, not only because together they add up to about 50 minutes, but because the latter builds confidently on the experiments of the former. Segall coaxes a greater range of sounds from his set-up, touching on a bit of psychedelic country on ""Rusted Dust"", frenzied gutter-punk fury on ""Johnny"", and hallucinatory desert rock on the Captain Beefheart cover ""Drop Out Boogie"". ""In Your Car"" stomps with the brat-menace of Black Lips, and the instrumental ""Untitled #2"" builds its surf rock from the ground up, establishing a fast rhythm section of rimshots and acoustic strums before introducing the barreling lead guitar and wiping out spectacularly at the end. Buffed to a relative shine, these songs are leaner, more frenetic, and simply more imaginative.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With this one-two punch, Segall enters a lo-fi field crowded with artists mining similar influences for inspiration and making similarly compact noise. What distinguishes him from his peers, however, is his ability to instill his songs with a palpable creative zeal, as if the final recordings were less important than the process of performing them.

It's not an entirely novel concept--   the lead-off track sampling the theme from <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> makes that much obvious-- but it's exceptionally well-crafted in a  way that eludes many of the artists who've fucked with this formula  in the past. It helps that the Alchemist plays well to a lengthy guestlist  of rappers with heavyweight street gravitas. As a rapper, Alc is still  a pretty ignorable presence who can pull off some tracks as long as  his lyrical honesty makes up for his poor vocal  impression. But what makes this record work is Alchemist's balanced  blend of creativity, craft, and atmosphere, a real underground rap record  that works best when it plays to its strengths.</p>
<p>The beats are, of course, the  main attraction. The claustrophobia, a mood so common to underground  hardcore, is less about the dusty breakbeats of New York  rap history;  Alc's instrumentation is modern, smooth, and crisp, haunting less  with texture than by strangled melody and the interplay of percussive  beats with raspier rappers. ""Lose Your Life"", for example, is all  swooping strings racing around bells that seem like the soundtrack  to Dracula's mansion over minimal drum snaps. ""That'll Work"", meanwhile, is one of the year's best hip-hop tracks; over a bleeping sheet of  computer sound, Juvenile and Three 6 Mafia spit inspired verses, accompanied  by sudden jittery 16th-note bass stabs. The hook's eerie vocal samples  are scratched less as a signifier of rap tradition than as disquieting  affect. ""On Sight"" is another highlight; the Dogg Pound rap with  classic West Coast lyrical dexterity over ominous bass burps and stuttered  snares.</p>
<p>Eminem's return to form on the title track is a return to classic ignorant shock rap-- essentially, the kind of thing that made him worth hearing,  even though it meant the eye-rolling homophobia of a ""couple of fags  stuffed in the back seat muzzled and gagged."" A double-edged sword,  less easily-ignorable coming from a full-grown established star.  That said, his return to these more clever lyrical roots is so engaging  that you have to wonder when this was actually recorded.</p>
<p>It's not all darkness and future-street  noir, though;  the listener gets some space to breathe, with the soulful Maxwell-assisted ""Smile"", featuring an impressive verse from Twista. Alchemist again walks a thin line between justifying his flaccid  delivery with smart lyrics, and undercutting those lyrics with his paltry  vocals. But it's the ominous lightning-and-thunder horror film moments  where the record really takes shape: Rappers like Prodigy, Lil Fame,  Jadakiss, Pusha T, and the Dogg Pound ""shine,"" a word that feels wholly  inappropriate for the grime-encrusted sonic background of the LP. The  only real ignorable moment comes on the noodle-y, overlong, and boring ""Therapy"".</p>
<p><i>Chemical Warfare</i> blends  the grimy vibe of classic underground East Coast rap with the coast-to-coast  who's who of rugged real rap, with highlights from New York lyrical  heads (Fabolous) to brass knuckles bomb throwers (Lil Fame), down south  legends (Juvenile) to the rugged West Coast street shit (Dogg Pound).  Tying it all together is the Alchemist's allegiance to craft, but never  at the expense of creativity; this kind of sci-fi cinema meets underground  rap ruggedness has been done before, but not with this much agility. <i> Chemical Warfare</i> is a rap version of Speilberg's <i>Minority Report</i>;  it draws upon a gritty underground past while embracing more modern  craftsmanship, where new smooth edges are balanced by the felt-authenticity  of its caliginous vision.</p></div>"|13329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13329-chemical-warfare/|7.8|David Drake

""Doom metal,"" for example, has diversified so much that the term doesn't mean much beyond down-tuned guitars and slow tempos. The tree from which all doom (and metal in general) springs is Black Sabbath. Sabbath lead to the bluesy stylings of ""stoner doom"" of Sleep and Electric Wizard. The doom tree also has stranger branches-- ""death doom"" (death metal + doom metal) hybrids like Coffins and Hooded Menace; ""sludge doom"" like Eyehategod and Sourvein from the American South; the astral density of the UK's Esoteric; grandfather clock bongs a thousand years wide from their compatriots Moss.</p>
<p>Oregon's YOB have carved out a niche of ""cosmic doom,"" which is a descriptor, not a subgenre. Few bands do what YOB do-- marry Black Sabbath's heavy and psychedelic sides. Sabbath did both equally well. But when they wheeled out acoustic guitars and bongo drums, they were just taking a break. YOB keep the pressure up, driving riffs into subterranean depths, yet sending melodies spiraling skyward. 2005's <i>The Unreal Never Lived</i> perfected such duality. It found the intersection among roaring guitars, yoga class, black light dreams, and white light ecstasy. Black Sabbath with Dio as singer changed their name to Heaven and Hell for legal reasons. Had they followed through sonically, YOB might have resulted.</p>
<p>YOB's discography is variations on this theme-- again, shades of black. The band is mostly a one-man project by singer/guitarist Mike Scheidt, with different rhythm sections over the years. Even a detour in 2007 as Middian was YOB-like, with more diverse speeds and tones. Middian lasted only one album due to a trademark dispute with Wisconsin metal band Midian. The lawsuit took a lot out of Scheidt, both financially and personally.</p>
<p><i>The Great Cessation</i> perhaps reflects this. It has YOB's signature 10-ton riffs and glacial tempos. But their delivery is more vulnerable now. The band sounds a little weary. Scheidt's Dave Mustaine-esque wail is ragged and desperate. The theme of damaged vision recurs throughout: ""burning eyes brim with tears""; ""thorn in the eye, gods that are blind""; ""tears of lead""; ""eyes like magnets."" At one point, ""The Lie That Is Sin"" breaks down to a single, naked guitar. Of course, it builds back up to surging peaks. But the attack is no longer a galactic wall of sound. Sanford Parker's production is partly responsible. It's more rock and less metal. The tones are darker and leaner than before. All this makes for a surprisingly human YOB record. Before, the band strode on astral planes. Now heaven and hell are closer to earth.</p></div>"|13327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13327-the-great-cessation/|7.0|Cosmo Lee

But there's a line where Broken  Records soapboxer Jamie Sutherland bellows, ""from the couch here, I plead  apathy.""  Unless he's being non-autobiographical, the only  natural response upon hearing the rest of <i>Until the Earth Begins  to Part </i>is to call bullshit.  This album is meant to inspire  a sort of lurking dread that you're not doing enough things  with your life, and as such, ""apathetic"" ranks as one of the least-accurate words to describe it. Like  a high-school junior volunteering his Saturday at a rescue home, it's  concerned, intense, and very much motivated.  And like that same  person, whatever altruistic intent they have is overshadowed by being  so goddamn serious, they're impossible to bear for more than a half  hour.</p>
<p>I hesitate to bring up that  an influential UK publication called them ""the Scottish Arcade Fire""  because on the surface, that's the sort of simplistic catch-all comparison  that a band spends the rest of their career unfairly trying to live  down.  But it's helpful in terms of figuring out where everything  went wrong-- rather than <i>Funeral </i> catharsis, Sutherland abides by <i>Neon Bible</i> tendency to<i> </i> blunt and oversensationalize.  With that, I suppose there's no  other choice for this sort of cheap-seats bound stuff than to deal with  governmental distrust, post-apocalyptic prophesying, and childlike wonder  at the inner workings of one's body: you'll find it completely against  type to even acknowledge such a mundane household fixture as a couch.   Instead, much of <i>Until the Earth </i> comes off like the narrator from ""Windowsill"" still telling these  damn kids to get off his lawn.</p>
<p>Broken Records certainly believe  in the redemptive power of a bunch of people playing instruments at  the same time, particularly if they're chamber pieces like glockenspiel,  balalaika, mandolin, and horns.  If they can all come in after  two or more minutes of piano piddling that comes off like narcoleptic  Blue Nile (""Wolves"", ""Nearly Home""), even better.  But  we really shouldn't go any further without addressing this record's-- and until further notice, this band's-- biggest problem, namely, Sutherland  going full-on diva like life is a big commercial.  Typically, ""bad""  vocalists are known as such if they're on the bland side or can't  hit notes, but what about giving no quarter whatsoever to what the other  guys in the band are doing?  I guess it's probably not in Sutherland's  best interests to let the lyrics speak for themselves, but he never exhibits awareness of his surroundings, toggling  between overbearing brogue and overbearing falsetto to the point where  Jeff Buckley sounds like Guru by comparison.</p>
<p>Where Broken Records' ""twist""  comes in is their adherence to folk stylings, ""folk"" usually meaning  a double-time drum beat and some tiny stringed instrument playing the  front.  Sure, even if a Coldplay/Gogol Bordello hybrid would possibly  slay Coachella, I'm not sure if there's really much breathing room  in that Venn diagram.  The track that attempts to set up shop in  that region (""A Good Reason"") sounds suspiciously similar to ""The Devil  Went Down to Georgia"" without the kickass solos, and I seriously doubt  they were looking to go there.</p>
<p>Still, it's almost admirable  just how easy of a target Broken Records make themselves again and again  here-- go ahead, Google the name ""Eilert Løvborg.""  He's  the inspiration for the track ""If Eilert Løvborg Wrote a Song, It Would Sound Like This"", and it'll certainly play well with  undergrads who are into songs for the mere fact that they're written  from the perspective of Ibsen characters who romantically can't moderate  their behavior.  It turns out to be pretty embarrassing straight-from-Cliff's Notes fan-fic, and an unbelievably obvious unintentional  metaphor for a record.  Yet, it seems sorta disingenuous to criticize <i> Until The Earth </i>as being overblown, since there's no way that  wasn't Broken Records' intent.  Hell, I suppose I should congratulate them  for accomplishing their goals of either turning mid-00s collective  soul-indie into a spectacle worthy of the ""Hate Me Now"" video or  at least making Glasvegas sound like a bunch of underfunded chumps.   Still, if the music can be moving on its own merits, there's no need  to be this damn pushy.</p></div>"|13322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13322-until-the-earth-begins-to-part/|4.9|Ian Cohen

The former introduced what would become the band's favorite topic-- ""the  duality of the Southern thing""-- and was so good it overcame the handicap  of that awkward band name. The latter effectively expanded their scope  well beyond the South, writing about Iraq vets the way Springsteen wrote  about Vietnam vets in the 80s. In between, they released two great albums  and one good one, as well as two solo albums from Patterson Hood and  an odds'n'sods collection slated for next month. Few bands have been  both so prolific and so consistent this decade.</p>
<p>Their latest 00s release is <i>Live From Austin, TX</i>, a CD/DVD set that documents  their 2008 performance on ""Austin City Limits"". The 13-song  tracklist draws heavily from <i>Brighter Than Creation's  Dark</i>, but also digs deep into the band's catalog, as far back  as their 1998 debut, <i>Gangstabilly</i>. Parallel with their ambitious,  sprawling albums, the Truckers have earned a well-deserved reputation  as a dependable live act with energy, stamina, and an ever-present bottle  of Jack Daniels. For ""Austin City Limits"", this is a raucous  performance, but for the Truckers, it's politely subdued, at times  even a bit staid. It's a good show, but they play better shows every  night.</p>
<p>If their guitars don't churn and  ramble as much as they might during a regular club show, this approach  puts more emphasis on the band's songwriting, showcasing the uptempo  tension of ""The Righteous Path"", which moves almost too fast for  Hood to get his lyrics out. That rush heightens the song's desperation  palpably, befitting a tale about everyday people struggling from one  day to the next. Likewise, Cooley's Southern boogie guitar licks on  ""3 Dimes Down"" and closer ""Marry Me"" lose none of their energy  in this setting, and ""Space City"", which was lost in the studio  sheen of 2006's <i>A Blessing and a Curse</i>, becomes a particularly  devastating country lament, especially sung in his distressed  baritone.</p>
<p>When Hood spits venom on ""Puttin'  People on the Moon"", it's hard not to be reminded of the man most  closely associated with the Texas Capitol dome on the <i>Austin City  Limits</i> backdrop, but none of these Bush-era songs prize the political  over the personal. They are character-driven compositions, and Hood  has no trouble singing from these perspectives even as he himself comes  across as a raconteur on stage. Hood is as compelling setting up these  songs as he is singing them, offering lengthy intros to setlist staples  ""18 Wheels of Love"" and ""The Living Bubba"" (although he doesn't  take as much time and care setting up newer songs). Sure, his prologue  to ""18 Wheels of Love"" may be the very same story he told on 1999's  live <i>Alabama Ass Whuppin'</i>, right down to the words and inflections,  but it's become part of the song itself, as crucial as the chorus  and verse. Besides, the decade between that album and this one has added  a new chapter in the unlikely romance between his mother and stepfather  that's so miraculous you might have trouble believing that happy ending.  ""You think I make this up?"" he hollers, his voice going raw. ""I  could never make this up!""</p>
<p><i>Alabama Ass Whuppin'</i> looms  large over <i>Live From Austin, TX</i>. Released two lineups ago, it  captures the band just before <i>Southern Rock Opera</i>, when Rob Malone  was still a member and long before Jason Isbell and Shonna Tucker joined.  It's the better live album, retaining the band's scouring guitars  and gritty punk urgency. The 2005 DVD <i>Live at the 40 Watt</i> is  similarly a more representative document of their live shows, benefitting  from an excitable hometown audience and the presence of Isbell completing  the three-songwriter/four-guitar assault. But the 2009 Truckers are  a better band than either the 1999 Truckers or the 2004 Truckers: Hood  and Cooley have written some of their best songs this decade, and the  additions of bass player Tucker (whose ""I'm Sorry Huston"" shows  her to be a strong vocalist and songwriter in her own right) and keyboard  player Jay Gonzalez have strengthened their attack considerably. What  could have been a simple fans-only release-- essentially redundant at  this point in their career-- is instead a strong compliment to what  has come before: <i>Live From Austin, TX</i> is a marker in time for  a band that seems always to be finding new ways to kick ass.</p></div>"|13324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13324-live-from-austin-tx/|7.0|Stephen M.

Concision is often held as a virtue for many modern indie bands, and, let's face it, there are scant few double albums in rock that really have the ideas and vision to sustain their runtime. Save for prolific geniuses like Frank Zappa or Prince, the even-rarer triple album is more common for weighty anthologies, or documenting the live shows of acts with drooling fan bases, from the Grateful Dead to Pearl Jam. Sure, the Clash brought us a rare triple triple album of original material at the peak of their critical capital, but even that was reviled in certain circles. So... why on earth would any band release a triple album now?</p>
<p>Maybe you've never met Oneida. When so inclined, they'll fill a whole side of vinyl with one long track, one whole CD's running time with two or three-- and if you haven't seen them on the festival circuit lately, it's because they went ahead and started their own. The reason they can do this (aside from keeping their dayjobs) is that their fans-- being open-minded enough to absorb the many permutations of repetitive, inexhaustible rhythms, and stinging vintage organ and guitar over 10 years-- eat it right up. Those fans won't be surprised by the behemoth <i>Rated O--</i> some have been waiting for it ever since it was planned and then scrapped before 2006's <i>Happy New Year</i>.</p>
<p>Before putting the idea of a 3xCD set aside, Drummer Kid Millions told an interviewer the project was ""the stone tablets of Onieda."" Given how hard it is to nail the band down to one sound, figuring out what those tablets could be remained a mystery. The good news: Between beat-heavy studio workouts, some of their loosest instrumental jams, and their most liberal use of ""O""-related puns in song titles, Oneida were considerate enough to build it all around lean, no-frills rock on par with the best of their earlier work. <i>Rated O</i> contains the band's wildest experiments while still covering most of their previous sonic tentpoles.</p>
<p>The first disc introduces the band as beat-hungry, dub-obsessed studio scientists, where at least 10 minutes go by before any sound resembling a guitar is discernible. While opener ""Brownout in Lagos"" is ostensibly inspired by dancehall, its rubbery and distorted beat sounds only remotely like that genre or any of Oneida's previous work. It features bona-fide toasting from Dad-Ali Ziai, but the guest is another texture in a very strange soup of radar blips, tin cans, and faraway explosions. ""What's Up, Jackal?"" begins with echoing drums and a hiccupping Eastern tone, before leading into muffled screaming and a dizzy studio collage that sounds like the aural equivalent of a strobe light, with that hiccup being the only constant. The first minute of 10 on ""10:30 at the Oasis"" has a similar fakeout before emerging into a more delirious and layered version of the sleek jams that Trans Am were later known for (which makes sense, as Trans Am's Phil Manley/Double Rainbow contributes here, alongside former Onieda axeman Papa Crazee). This first disc is new for band, fans, and unacquainted listeners alike, and there aren't a whole lot of hooks to guide anyone. As with much of Oneida's work, it starts and ends on the beat, leading listeners through percussive whirlwinds of psychedelic sound.</p>
<p>The middle disc is closer to the band's live sound with few overdubs, and is an exemplary document of the hell the band can raise as an honest-to-god rock outfit. ""The River"" starts from Oneida's familiar monotone patter before uniting on a simple but massive-sounding theme, showing more melodic certainty and fearless classic-rock worship than they have in a while. Proto-metal riffs power spacey but insistent workouts like ""I Will Haunt You"" and ""Ghost in the Room"", while more exotic rhythms push ""The Life You Preferred""; these tracks sprint and shimmy and drone without ever losing momentum. As the sluggish chant of ""Luxury Travel"" slows to a halt, the most stretched-out part of the three-disc set begins with disc C: ""O"" is an anchorless sitar-laden haze until minute five, when the rhythm builds and the guitars coagulate around brief, hypnotic tones. ""End of Time"" is a formless, nervous drone (<i>smoke break!</i>) that leads into the <i>20</i>-minute ""Folk Wisdom"". Make no mistake: The band is jamming.</p>
<p>But Oneida's version of jamming tends to be a more pulsing, atmospheric, moody affair than the scale-fingering aimlessness the word probably calls to mind, and the tracks on the third disc are no exception. They don't have the same layers or utilize the studio in quite the same way as last year's instrumental <i>Preteen Weaponry</i> did, but marathon sessions like ""Folk Wisdom"" maintain their anxious, yearning edge while revealing the intuition and chemistry of the band through its many subtle shifts and turns. The last section of <i>Rated O</i> may feel like work to some, but at this point in the record (and their careers), it also feels earned.</p>
<p>While it's not quite three discs of all killer and no filler-- the plodding anguish of ""The Human Factor"" is difficult enough the first time through-- <i>Rated O</i> could stand easily as three discrete<b> </b>records, with each of them meriting their own release. Putting them all together is what makes it a statement: In an era when easy availability of music makes attention spans dwindle, it's an audacious listen the first time around, not to mention the repeated listens that Oneida records often reward. And as music gets increasingly reduced to a ""niche interest"" (shudder) and focuses more on the novelty of the physical package, the triple-gatefold <i>Rated O</i> is undoubtedly a beautiful package.</p>
<p>More than anything, <i>Rated O</i> is part and parcel of the band's long-standing and always-increasing ambition--don't forget this massive slab is part of a triptych of albums, with the third installment yet to come. Few bands push themselves this far from their comfort zone, fewer still this late in their career-- and that slice of the pie chart gets even smaller when considering what little attention the band has received, even in indie circles, while they've continued to innovate and sweat. Maybe you've got some other Brooklyn band pegged as your creative north star-- and that's cool, this year has some contenders-- but Oneida are the only band running that I could tell a listener with a straight face, yes, it's worth three discs, and it's worth your time.</p></div>"|13215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13215-rated-o/|8.4|Jason Crock

You look forward to the cryptic postcards, the soon-to-be party-favored stories-- hell, you even make him an honorary member of the band. You might even try to channel his spirit animal through your new LP, however vague a seance it ends up being. This particular Johnny is also the Skygreen Leopards' Johnny, for which a good deal of their sixth proper full-length <i>Gorgeous Johnny</i> is about, either in body or spirit. But don't blame the man (or myth, for that matter: Johnny's name appears as much as Jehovah's, a longstanding Leopards' reference and centerpiece) for either the mild successes or countless missteps presented here; it is, for the most part, the final shake of a fruitless branch.</p>
<p>The Leopards certainly have enjoyed a solid streak since teaming up in 2001. Anchored by Glenn Donaldson and Donovan Quinn, the San Franciscan duo (who regularly enlist orbiting friends and musicians from record to record; this one features Papercuts' Jason Quever) has long been producing Cali-fried folk concerned with extolling the virtues of blissed-out Americana. Best represented on their 2005 <i>Surrender Jehovah EP</i>, these seemingly straight-forward strummers and hummers can somehow bear and begin to force open the young buds of commercial-leaning psychedelia. Those songs, much like the ones here on <i>Johnny</i>, weren't in the least bit freaky (especially at a time when everyone clung so desperately to that tag), owning their own space within the wiggle-free barriers of the straightforward, two-and-a-half-minute song.</p>
<p>The bulk of <i>Gorgeous Johnny</i> is unfortunately too earnest and too patient really to go anywhere in particular, preening like a collection of meticulously cleaned Travis demos or, at their worst, an Adam Green album without any of the dirty bits. Take for example album highlight ""Goodnight Anna"", an extremely well-crafted, simple song that is sadly rehashed and reevaluated about 12 times too many over the course of the album. It sits dead in the middle, falsely redefining the first five cuts as building blocks and ignoring any chance to eventually one-up ""Anna""'s foamy whispers and mournful twangs as the album moves along. It most fully realizes the Leopards' struggle with the bittersweetness of reminiscence and fleeting emotion, but unfortunately doesn't leave much room for any sort of creative expanse: however pacifying the rigidity of these song structures are, well... what you see is what you get.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that everything both North and South of this astute highlight is for naught, with plenty of ideas and passing moments that manage to stick rather elegantly. Opener ""Johnny's Theme"" is a lovely little stone-kicker that helps recall lost days of butterfly-netting; ""Margery"" is a spot-on summer lament for a girl impossibly trapped inside herself for whatever reason; ""Gorgeous Johnny"" waxes Dylan over a simple little Band-indebted progression, more pleasant yet equally as plain as anything else here. It's not that there are any cataclysmic duds, though ""Dixie Cups in the Dead Grass"" ultimately tumbles over itself like a sprinting drunk, and ""SGL's, et al"" is about as repetitive and irritating as a song gets. The real problem is that the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) model needs to somehow circumvent the complacency and redundance. That, or maybe a record about your wild and flaky friends shouldn't submit to such hollow sameness.</p></div>"|13311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13311-gorgeous-johnny/|4.8|Zach Kelly

Bug can have that effect. The night before I'd seen him play for several hours, and whether it was due to his sharp fashion sense or his endearing little dance moves behind the decks or his knack for choosing deep tunes that slowly become thoroughly gripping, he seemed awfully charismatic. His own productions adopt a different pose: in the last decade or so he's managed only a handful of anthems (chiefly his late-1990s classic ""Loverboy""), while putting out a lot of material that seems almost defiantly anonymous. This is partly because a fair amount of it is good-not-great, but even the bona fide masterpieces can slide right past you if you're not paying attention. 2005's ""Bugs in Your Brain"" is my favorite Bug moment: A deceptively fragile, airy piece of minimal house that at first seems to act only as a pretty bridge between tracks in a mix, it reveals its enormous charm through repeat playing, and the accompanying recognition that each beat and each synth chord have been placed just so to achieve an overwhelming sense of rightness.</p>
<p>""Fit"", rather than weirdness or populism or futurism, forms Bug's stock-in-trade. His productions invite the sort of praise you might bestow on well-designed furniture: sleek, comfortable, without visible flaw. But these traits are as elusive and enigmatic as they are unobtrusive. The difference between a good Bug production and a brilliant one is difficult to articulate, and often just comes down to context-- in the hands of a talented DJ a track can easily move from the first category to the second. Which makes Bug's own albums seem slightly ill-conceived from the start; his tracks are not designed to be heard in full, one after the other. It's not that this music is difficult or impenetrable; if anything, Bug's classicist fusion of deep house grooves, reflective post-Detroit synthesizer melodies, and slight electro affectations (all wrapped in clean, hyper-detailed Euro minimal sound design) will be pleasurably familiar to anyone who has paid the slightest attention to German dance music of the past decade. But this itself is the problem: Bug's work never shocks, and his own consistency works against him. <i>Collaboratory</i> is the equal of previous albums <i>The Other Day</i> and <i>Sensual</i>, but this equality also verges on exchangeability.</p>
<p>As its title suggests, <i>Collaboratory</i> focuses on collaborations with other producers, but you'd be forgiven for not noticing, as the sound of the album is overwhelmingly consistent. There's much to love here. Opener ""Trees Can't Dance"" is the sort of echo-strewn, melancholy Detroit homage that any producer would kill to call to their own, its roaming, mutating synthesizer line confirming that while Bug is proudly functionalist he's never rigidly geometric. On the unnerving ""Month of Sip"" (in collaboration with the Martini Bros' DJ Cle), portentous chords and drooping, decaying synth tones slowly transform into a morose gesture towards peaktime energy, like Âme on strong downers. ""Still Music"", with Donnacha Costello, is dreamy acid house whose seven minutes of radical uneventfulness would still be captivating if it were stretched out to 20. Meanwhile, for the romantic, mysterious vocal house of ""Trust in Me"" and ""Like It Should Be"", Bug concocts delectable, evocatively humid grooves-- all glowering bass and intricate, delicate snare patterns.</p>
<p>In fact pretty much every track here is filled with ear-tickling sounds and uniformly sensitive production. Still, imagine how much more startling these qualities would be if they were marshaled in the service of mind-bending, unpredictable grooves, or gigantic dancefloor-slaying hooks, or simply unforgettable melodies. Bug avoids these ""easy"" options in order to focus listeners' attentions on the carefully thought-out physicality of his work; I sympathize, but despite its superlative craft <i>Collaboratory</i> still seems at times like a missed opportunity. For music that's so easy to like, falling in love with this stuff can feel like surprisingly hard work.</p></div>"|13266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13266-collaboratory/|6.7|Tim Finney

<p class=""MsoNormal""><i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">And now upon the release of his solo debut, </span></i><i>Lord Cut-Glass, </i>Delgados frontman Alun Woodward is still a misfit, even in his own home.<span> </span>While Scotland has been known as of late for producing romantic anthem-toters with bleeding hearts and bleeding ears, Woodward is still the kid in the back of the poetry class casting spitballs.<span> </span>Lyrically, <i>Lord Cut-Glass </i>could be mistaken for <i>Hate</i>'s<i> </i>sequel, a call for the utter negation of social contracts.<span> </span>""Even Jesus Couldn't Love You"" is a sprawling, initially awkward composition of taunts at an anonymous no-hoper (""did your pony not <i>wuvv </i>you?"") that swings between a verse melody that tensely and steadily nudges upward and mantra-like repetition of the song's says-it-all title.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But if Woodward is still wheelhousing it as a wordsmith, <i>Lord Cut-Glass </i>is a significantly more singer-songwriterly affair musically.<span> </span>It's a relative claim: There's still strings all over the place, either mocking in their pizzicato affectations or swaddling madrigal-like minor keys (""You Know"", ""Toot Toot""), and a female vocalist who sounds suspiciously like his fellow Delgados hatemonger Emma Pollock.<span> </span>""Jesus"" and ""Look After Your Wife"" give off the impression that <i>Lord Cut-Glass </i>could be undercut by overly distracted composition, but most of its remainder is built on a chassis of cowboy chords (""Holy Fuck!"" ""I'm A Great Example to the Dogs"").<span> </span>But Woodward deflates the puffier song lengths and takes a melodic turn that owes more to Paul McCartney and Stuart Murdoch. ""Picasso"" has a ""Blackbird""-like acoustic lilt that's almost honestly sweet, while the brief piano ballad ""Be Careful What You Wish For"" recalls ""For No One"", a low-key indication that Woodward's sarcasm is likely a defense mechanism for genuine loneliness.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Granted, this runs the risk of crossing the radar of only Delgados diehards, who would chalk this up as another one of life's inevitable letdowns: Woodward's snark can cut a little predictable and broad and he'll give into an occasional stale, eyeball-rolling rhyme. But really, <i>Lord Cut-Glass </i>gets an unintentional boost from the recent fortunes of Future of the Left, who rose from a similarly underappreciated act (Mclusky) even angrier and misanthropic than before-- hopefully, Woodward can make a second-album leap the same way <i>Travels With Myself and Another </i>did, but if <i>Lord Cut-Glass </i>can at least be seen as an indication that he has no plans to go soft on us, that in and of itself is a success.</p></div>"|13271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13271-lord-cut-glass/|6.4|Ian Cohen

Such bonus materials were meant to augment the primary artifact and, more often than not, did just that-- even the hilariously excessive <i>Surrounded</i> Dolby 5.1 set came in an irresistible cotton candy-colored square. But <i>Voltaïc</i>'s task is tougher. Björk's latest foray into the deluxe edition world not only has to bolster 2007's <i>Volta</i>, it has to save it. Because even <a href=""http://www.allentattoo.com/2007/09/bjork.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the dude with the <i>Homogenic</i> tattoo on his leg</a> has to admit-- <i>Volta</i> is Björk's worst solo album.</p>
<p>In his review of the album, Pitchfork's Mark Pytlik keenly observed that it sounded ""almost unfinished,"" and the heftiness of the <i>Voltaïc</i> package almost seems to acknowledge this fact. Of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35213-bjork-ivoltaici-box-set-details-revealed/"">five available versions</a> of the set, the most maxed-out boasts a live DVD chronicling two <i>Volta</i>-era gigs, a DVD stuffed with <i>Volta</i> music videos, a CD of <i>Volta </i>remixes from the likes of Simian Mobile Disco and Ratatat, a <i>Volta</i>-heavy CD recorded at London's Olympic Studio with Björk's <i>Volta</i> tour ensemble, and three LPs that reiterate the tunes on the aforementioned CDs. <i>Voltaïc </i>isn't a victory lap as much as an attempted rescue mission.</p>
<p>The Volta Tour live DVD is the set's centerpiece and offers the best evidence for re-evaluation. Ironically, though, the disc's two shows-- a full-stage extravaganza taped at the Olympia in Paris and a solemn, largely acoustic performance at an Icelandic church-- didn't make me want to give the original <i>Volta</i> another go. Even with frills including Björk's Rainbow Brite-inspired getup, a 10-piece female brass ensemble dressed up like Skittles, and plenty of green lasers, songs like ""Earth Intruders"", ""Vertebrae by Vertebrae"", and ""Wanderlust"" simply can't hope to compete with greatest hits like ""Army of Me"" and ""Bachelorette"". But the DVD does make a great case for what may be Björk's most mysterious and eccentric album, 2004's underappreciated <i>Medúlla</i>.</p>
<p>Since the singer didn't tour behind that all-vocal curio upon its release, the <i>Volta</i> tour marked the live coming out of several <i>Medúlla </i>tracks. Re-arranged for her full band, a mini <i>Medúlla</i> suite from the the Paris show proves to be its most unpredictably stunning stretch. ""Where Is the Line"" digs even deeper into its death metal-meets-Gregorian chanting roots, churning with enough gothic evil to satisfy Sunn O))). Then, ""Who Is It"" fulfills the sprightly, weirdo-pop pleasures that <i>Volta</i> promised but didn't deliver. Finally, ""Desired Constellation""-- a static-y electro-ballad that finds Björk ecstatically questioning her own place in the world-- glides like a worthy successor to <i>Homogenic</i> classic ""All Is Full of Love"".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of the five tracks performed at the hushed Reykjavik locale, <i>Medúlla</i>'s three entries roundly trump the two <i>Volta</i> selections. Modern hymns ""Vökuró"" and ""Sonnets / Unrealities XI"" take advantage of a full choir to translate a dark knowing seemingly born of another epoch entirely. <i>Volta</i>'s understandably forgotten mother-to-son finale, ""My Juvenile"", gets an appropriately warm voice-and-harpsichord treatment and goes lengths to show this 43-year-old pop irregularity looks and sounds noticeably more comfortable in a church than an arena.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Voltaïc</i> is marred by redundancies. While the remix disc collects an impressive list of producers-- XXXchange, Matthew Herbert, Modeselektor-- almost the whole collection is based on not-completely-radical reworks of the same three songs: ""Earth Intruders"", ""Declare Independence"", and ""Innocence"". Even considering upgrades like XXXchange's admirably funked take on ""Earth Intruders"", the disc becomes wearisome. Kudos to Ratatat, who take on the less obvious-- and not-exactly-danceable-- track ""Wanderlust"" and flip it into something more pop-friendly and fun than anything on <i>Volta</i> proper. Most inconsequentially repetitious, though, is the Live at Olympic Studios disc, recorded by the <i>Volta</i> tour band near the beginning of the trek's 18-month, on-and-off itinerary. Stuck in a purgatory between live album and studio creation, it offers risk-less takes on five <i>Volta</i> tunes, which once again sound staggeringly unmemorable next to stuff like ""Pagan Poetry"" and ""Hunter"".</p>
<p>Which brings us to the music videos DVD. To say the videos from <i>Volta</i> were disappointing is an extreme understatement; the album's five clips are not just ""bad for Björk,"" i.e., sub par material from possibly the most original and ambitious video artist this side of Michael Jackson and Madonna. Most of these videos are just inept, full stop. It's almost shocking. But there is a common thread, which may speak to <i>Volta</i>'s overall lack of luster.</p>
<p>In all of the clips here, Björk's face is obscured or completely computer generated-- from the embarrassingly amateur CGI head of the ""Earth Intruders"" video to her constellation-ized face in ""Dull Flame of Desire"" to the Michel Gondry collaboration ""Declare Independence""-- their least successful vid by miles-- where her head is mostly seen behind a megaphone. This may not matter if Björk didn't have one of the most expressive visages in all of pop; previous eye crushers like ""Big Time Sensuality"", ""Hunter"", and ""Hidden Place"" all rely almost exclusively on the unique contours and twitches of her cheeks, mouth, nose, etc. She even made a straight-up <i>robot</i> appear more than human with the help of video auteur Chris Cunningham in the ""All Is Full of Love"" clip. This second-hand facelessness runs throughout <i>Volta</i>, which still reads oddly rote and cold with this addendum. Even with its hulking abundance, <i>Voltaïc</i> is flesh without bone.</p></div>"|13254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13254-voltaic/|5.2|Ryan Dombal

Said in an over-the-top manner, this was David Bowie's inauspicious kick-off to an over-sentimental start to ""Life on Mars"". Like the rest of his 1999 performance on ""VH1's Storytellers"" series, it poses a question, or more accurately, suggests the audience will be privy to inside information. But the answers don't come during a mostly tepid eight-song set.</p>
<p>Broadcast in August 1999, a quarter-century after he hung up his Ziggy Stardust kimonos, this episode teased fans with a rare chance to hear the shape-shifting artist discuss and deconstruct part of his mythology. Bowie was running on the fumes of what was a disappointing decade-- between albums like <i>Earthling</i>, <i>Outside</i>, and the then forthcoming <i>Hours...</i>-- but if anybody had an iconic back catalog, a colorful personal narrative (or narratives), and an amazing supporting cast to draw stories from, it was Bowie. Sadly, only flashes of his wit and gregarious storytelling come out during this CD/DVD release of his television performance.</p>
<p>Standing at the center of what looks like a bad community theater stage set, entertaining an overly polite audience while donning a gray hoodie, Bowie comes off likable and very off the cuff. Take his introduction to ""China Girl"". After a hushed retelling of a story about a story-- Iggy Pop, over coffee, recalling a 1970s Berlin punk show where German artists built and destroyed a replica of the Berlin Wall-- he says, ""this is a song I wrote with Jim at around that time, and I guess this one's also about invasion and exploitation, take it away, Mike."" There's no mention or insight into Nile Rodgers, the Nazi reference in the song, or the then-controversial, award-winning music video-- just a somewhat interesting little tale followed by a piano intro better suited to some low-budget made-for-TV movie. His storytelling continues in this vein, jumping between the Paul Anka connection to ""Life on Mars"", an Eartha Kitt obsession and the shocking admission that the mid-70s was a dark, drug-fueled period impervious to recall. What's especially frustrating is that he's charming and self-deprecating, tossing out casual references to a meeting with Abbie Hoffmann and doing an amusing Marc Bolan impression, suggesting he could actually tell dozens more interesting, relevant, and revealing stories if he felt like it.</p>
<p>Musically, things don't go much better, occasionally sliding into cheesy, cabaret-lite renditions from a band that looks like a casting call for session player stereotypes. Two of the tracks on the original broadcast, along with two more of the bonus tracks on the DVD, come from <i>Hours...</i>, not many fans' first choice. Two of the extra tracks, ""Always Crashing in the Same Car"" and ""I Can't Read"", provide a slightly more-well rounded look at his career, but none come with additional commentary, making them four modest live performances, nothing else.</p>
<p>It's part of the puzzling DVD/CD element of this release. A DVD with a companion CD that doesn't bother to separate the songs from storytelling or include the bonus tracks makes it an audio recording of a television episode. Don't major labels have enough problems with venerable and archaic media formats without working hard to invent new ones? The substance of this reissue seems indebted to a famous name instead of adding significantly more insight into a famous and intriguing career. It's hard to imagine a fan outcry for a DVD filled with decent to muddled performances.</p></div>"|13202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13202-vh1-storytellers/|4.5|Patrick Sisson

Poly-Rythmo actually make a few appearances as a backing band on this compilation, which is one of uncountable reasons to check it out. The tracklist focuses on four of Benin's greatest, most distinctive bandleaders-- Honoré Avolonto, Antoine Dougbé, Gnonnas Pedro, and El Rego-- and each brings something special to the table.</p>
<p>Each singer could support a compilation on his own, so getting to hear all four duke it out in the same space is a total blast-- they had decidedly different approaches to floor-burning Afrofunk, but there's not a track here that won't make you want to move. Two of the men featured here preferred to lead their own bands, with musicians they selected. Gnonnas Pedro put together a succession of tight outfits over his career, assembling groups that could throw down a hard funk groove one minute and then turn around and reel off a lilting Afro-Cuban track. El Rego's Commandos often came off a little more rocked-up than their counterparts but could hold their own with just about any kind of beat. Antoine Dougbé and Honoré Avolonto tended to bring in the ringers; each spent time with both Poly-Rythmo and sensational trumpeter Ignace de Souza's Black Santiago orchestra.</p>
<p>De Souza and Black Santiago (and before Black Santiago, the Melody Aces) were among the first groups in Benin to incorporate Western soul and R&amp;B into their sound in the early 1960s, and they make a perfect backing band for Avolonto on ""Dou Dagbé Wé"", a burbling Afrobeat track underpinned by a laidback organ figure and head-nodding bass line. He's that much harder with Poly-Rythmo behind him on ""Tin Lin Non"", a sick Fela-influenced Afrofunk workout that shares a lot with what was being recorded next door in Nigeria around the same time in the mid-70s. Yehouessi Leopold uses his drumsticks more to kiss his snare than to smack it, painting behind the needling guitar and staccato bass as the catchy vocal call-and-response works itself into a lather up top.</p>
<p>Dougbé's track with Poly-Rythmo, ""Ya Mi Ton Gbo"", has an infectious bounce buoyed by a summery organ, and it reaches an ebulliently joyous high as Dougbé calls out to Poly-Rythmo vocalists Vicky and Eskill, who provide spirited backing for Dougbé's rapid-fire vocal. The song is positively weightless, but if that track floats, ""Non Akuenon Hwlin Me Sin Koussio"" practically scours the earth with its heavy reggae thump. The song's completely unexpected modulation after the first couple of verses for a concise instrumental jam is a great example of the kind of detailed, thoughtful composition that makes funk from Benin so constantly rewarding to listen to.</p>
<p>Gnonnas Pedro and His Dadjes Band's 1966 cut ""Dadje Von O Von Non"" updates an old rhythm called agbadja, spinning it into a crazily memorable light-speed bed for an earworm of a vocal call-and-response. Pedro was an eclectic bandleader, and that shows even in the small sample heard here. ""La Musica en Verité"" shows his Afro-Cuban side, combining hints of Cubano son with voodoo rhythms, highlife guitar, and a touch of psychedelic organ to emerge with something all his own. ""Okpo Videa Bassouo"" is more of a crash-and-bash, chicken-scratch funk track with heart-stopping drum fills and stabbing horns.</p>
<p>That leaves El Rego, whose ""Feeling You Got"" launched the entire ""jerk"" scene in Benin. Dig the accordion holding down the chord progression as a raw guitar hammers the beat. Ghanaian singer Eddy Black Power, who clearly had some James Brown records, provides the gritty soul-man vocal. ""Vimado Wingnan"" is spiked with a wah'd-out guitar solo, as if the buzzy organ and wild drums (catch the insane break two minutes in) weren't enough to drive it home by themselves. He dials it back for some slow, airy funk on ""E Nan Mian Nuku"".</p>
<p>The sequencing of the tracks is well done, moving you from a light bounce to a heavy rhythm and back, playing up the variety without throwing you out of the groove. Mixing the four bandleaders together makes it feel a little like a battle of the bands where everyone won, and it accentuates the contrasts in their styles while allowing for the similarities to show through. Analog Africa is mining serious gold from Benin's funky past, and <i>Legends of Benin</i> is yet more proof that the country had an incredible scene in the 60s and 70s, equal in quality if not quantity to the country's much larger neighbors.</p></div>"|13173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13173-legends-of-benin/|8.5|Joe Tangari

<p><i>Azar</i> is structured around four electronics-heavy instrumental movements spread across the album, what we might collectively call the ""Azar Suite"". ""Azar One"", with its warm, impressionist tonal swaths eventually given shape by steady march drumming, suggests Explosions in the Sky gone <i>Pure Moods</i>, shot through with just the slightest touch (no pun intended) of Fennesz. ""Two"" takes the main theme into more delicate, twilit territory, and ""Three"" introduces tape manipulation chatter, while ""Four"", which begins as somber undersea waltz as performed on some phantom player piano, only turns more gloomily nostalgic with the introduction of strings. Taken together the suite conjures some pretty big, cinematic imagery-- too big, as it turns out, for the still-modest indie pop in between.</p>
<p>See, the problem here, and what makes <i>Azar</i> a more satisfying listen in parts than as a whole, is the rather epic disconnect between the ""Azar"" bits and the seven actual songs that comprise the blood and guts of the album. Take ""Young Master Sunshine"" as an example: the track sports an Elephant 6-esque title and comes in a pretty package, with an elegant swaying tempo and a horn- and string-saturated outro reminiscent of Okkervil River, but is ultimately sunk by a chorus-- constructed of slight variations on the line ""It's not enough/ But sometimes it's more than enough""-- too bland and ambiguous to leave much of an impression. It's not for want of trying; while Karolyn Troupe's viola-playing anchored most of the tracks on <i>Sorry</i>, here it's almost an afterthought amid a sound rich with horns, woodwinds, percussion, and atmospheric flourishes. Yet more often than not the grand arrangements tend to smear together rather than punctuate specific moments, and overall these more cautiously optimistic tracks lack the weight of their determinedly melancholy counterparts on <i>Flowers</i>. In short, this is still a small band with some big ideas.</p>
<p>Despite its flaws, however, <i>Azar</i> feels like a necessary step for Venice Is Sinking. They're getting their feet wet with some new sounds and departing from the fairly strict structure that kept <i>Flowers</i> engaging but prevented it from ever truly soaring, and one gets the sense that the lessons learned here have the potential to foster some really exceptional material from these guys in the future. And indeed, the band has already cut a third, decidedly less produced album-- recorded live to tape at a local theater subsequently destroyed by fire-- so it's clear they're not just going to fall back on their day jobs for now and hope <i>Azar</i> catches on. They're already trying a new look, and perhaps this will be the one to stick.</p></div>"|13261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13261-azar/|6.0|Matthew Solarski

Pisces were one of them: a group from the nowheresville of Rockford, Illinois. Their Lennon and McCartney wannabe auteurs were guitarist Jim Krein and keyboardist Paul DiVenti, who came up through the bar-band scene, put together a little studio and recorded piles of material, basically because they'd heard <i>Sgt. Pepper's </i>and the White Album and had to let it out somehow. Barely any of it was ever heard outside the walls of their studio, A Lovely Sight (which was briefly the band's name, too)-- just three singles on a label run by a Rockford tailor with big ambitions for his own easy-listening sides.</p>
<p>This isn't an unreleased album, as such, despite the disingenuous ""bonus tracks"" at the end of the CD: it was pieced together from bits of a half-disintegrated acetate, their singles' A-sides, and a few other tapes that have survived the last four decades. It's not quite a lost masterpiece, either. Pisces weren't a big deal the first time around, partly because they were stuck in the Midwest, but mostly because Krein and DiVenti were strictly average songwriters-- most of their material is somewhere in the range between underdeveloped and barely germinated. The low point is probably ""Elephant Eyes"", an embarrassing Doors impression with a carousel-music bridge flown in from ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!""</p>
<p>What Pisces did have going for them was a van-load of clever arrangement ideas (like the way the lurching bass riff of ""Dear One"" triggers the song's textural shifts), and mightily impressive studio technique for a couple of guys who were basically doing everything on their own. Every song here has a distinctive and freaky sonic identity that makes a lot out of their limited resources-- they were effectively Elephant 6 <i>avant la lettre</i>. The drum loop that propels ""Mary"" is years ahead of its time (although the flange effect it's run through, along with about half of the rest of the album, is the king of psychedelic clichés). Accompanied by heady harmonies and a wasp-nest bass riff, it sounds amazing for about 45 seconds; then Krein and DiVenti run out of song and throw in a slowed-down breakdown and a bunch of atonal tape noise and sound effects until it's time for the fadeout. Nice try.</p>
<p>Pisces' greatest asset, though, was a singer who was only passing through: 17-year-old Linda Bruner, who sang Krein's lyrics as if she were choking back tears. (Great detail from the liner notes: ""When last heard from, Linda was embroiled in a check fraud scheme and was on the run."") Her voice has the smoldering singularity that Krein's and DiVenti's lack, and she's the star of the album's centerpiece: ""Sam"", a woozy, chorusless, one-chord farewell that was way too much of a bummer to make an impact as a single but staggers out of the album to glower intently at anyone willing to listen to its naked pain. Krein found an ideal interpreter in Bruner, and rose to the opportunity. The four tracks he wrote for her are <i>A Lovely Sight</i>'s best and deepest-- effectively an awkward but priceless EP, a little bad-trip marvel. Next to them, the rest of Pisces' surviving output just sounds like context.</p></div>"|13201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13201-a-lovely-sight/|6.0|Douglas Wolk

Where <i>Check Your Head</i> was a jam session turned venting process turned crossover success, <i>Ill Communication </i>is the album that let them infuse their turn towards sincerity with a renewed sense of playfulness, solidifying their transition from the gleefully exaggerated bad-boy anarchists of their first two albums to a trio of (slightly) more mature, trend-setting enthusiasts. It's as if they took stock in their history, realized they were past the point of having to prove anything, said what the hell, and decided to throw their whole repertoire into the album. Considering the record was assembled over a comparatively brief six-month span, it's an ideal, condensed snapshot of the Boys' genuine interests and cultural obsessions, whether they were spiritual (Buddhism), musical (late-60s/early-70s soul-jazz) or recreational (no less than three members of the 1993-94 Knicks get shout-outs). It's the Beasties at their most lifestyle-savvy, though they came across less like opportunistic youth marketers and more like the idiosyncratic hipsters they'd always been. (Remember, this was in 1994, before ""hipster"" was a pejorative.)</p>
<p>Their lyrical personalities are a bit more distinct, too, even as they keep up their traditional mic-passing back-and-forth rapport: MCA's the pistol-smashing, anti-misogynist, spiritual one, who gets a couple of solo joints to mull over the decaying state of the world (""The Update"") and espouse upon his Buddhism (""Bodhisattva Vow""). Mike D's the instigator of analog throwbacks (""I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD""), working-class style (""I'm shopping at Sears 'cause I don't buy at the Gap"") and b-boy golf chic (""Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot/ Then you throw me off the green 'cause I'm strictly hip-hop""). And Ad-Rock's the irreverent name-dropper who compares himself to everyone from underground cartoonist Vaughn Bode to Moog pioneer Dick Hyman in the process of big-upping his microphone technique. But even amidst all the Gen-X cool-hunting and social-conscience soul-searching the Beasties were undertaking at the time, <i>Ill Communication</i> rings true because it stands as one of their most dedicated engagements with hip-hop culture. They're game as far as actual lyricism goes; even if they're a half-step behind the dizzying, rapid-fire linguistic free-for-all of <i>Paul's Boutique</i>, there's enough quotables and inspired moments of limber beat-riding in tracks like ""Sure Shot"", ""Root Down"", and ""Do It"" to hold up.</p>
<p>It helps the cause that the Caldato-abetted beats have a close affinity with the classic post-Premier/Pete Rock early-90s NYC production sound, to the extent that it sounds a bit like the work of a Native Tongues auxiliary-- and not just because of Q-Tip's great, off-the-cuff-sounding guest spot on ""Get It Together"". It's an influence the Beasties wear on their sleeves, focusing ""Root Down"" around the reverently-acknowledged 1972 Jimmy Smith jazz-funk classic of the same name, infusing cuts like ""Alright Hear This"" and ""Flute Loop"" with Village Vanguard atmosphere, and throwing around a cratedigger's shopping list of names-- Les McCann, Yusef Lateef, Archie Shepp, Bernard ""Pretty"" Purdie-- in ""Alright Hear This"". Throw those moments alongside anything off <i>Buhloone Mindstate</i> or <i>Midnight Marauders</i> and they stand up strong, plus you've got yourself a hell of a pool party mixtape.</p>
<p>A whole album full of that caliber of straight-up hip-hop would've been a pretty safe bet for borderline-classic status, but the fact that <i>Ill Communication </i>frequently switches between that and their more sprawling live-band stuff actually adds to its kitchen-sink charm a bit-- largely because so much of it's cut from a similar cloth as the soul-jazz records they sampled for their lyrical cuts. Sure, the big axe-swinging titan at the center of this album is the fuck-yeah highlight ""Sabotage"", the meatiest slab of moshpit rap-rock aggression the Beasties ever put to tape, and it stomps around a bit conspicuously between the funk-bop grooves of ""Root Down"" and ""Get It Together"". It's a classic case of the album's biggest single being its least-representative track, though I ain't complaining about its inclusion in the least; I think the one time I listened to that song and<i> didn't </i>get all amped, I was in a bronchitis-fighting NyQuil stupor.</p>
<p>But the instrumentals that they'd started experimenting with on <i>Check Your Head</i> are a bit more at home here, and they benefit from some additional polish and a tighter structure. The growly, early-Funkadelic-meets-El Chicano doom-funk jam ""Futterman's Rule"", the violin-driven shtetl-dub of ""Eugene's Lament"" and Money Mark's sleek electric piano vibe-out showcases ""Ricky's Theme"" and ""Transitions"" reveal a band that's busted their asses in the process of honing a relatively new aspect of their craft. They also wisely relegate their hardcore tendencies to the realm of absurd intermission-caliber comedy tracks; they might not be the most indispensable songs, but there's something inherently hilarious about using Minor Threat aesthetics to rail against a ""Bill Laimbeer motherfucker"" pickup-game nemesis.</p>
<p>Like <i>Check Your Head</i>, this reissue of <i>Ill Communication</i> comes with a bonus disc of B-sides and remixes; unlike <i>Check Your Head</i>, the B-sides and remixes are mostly good-to-great, though a bit redundant if you already own 1995's <i>Root Down</i> EP and/or are uninterested in listening to 87 seconds of the Beasties playing basketball. Still, it's worth it to hear the Prunes' Free Zone Mix of ""Root Down"" and the live performance of ""The Maestro"" where Ad-Rock goes fantastically apeshit on the ""<i>yeah</i>, you motherfuckers, <i>I'm all that</i>"" bit. In any case, the best thing about this reissue is that it's a good excuse to reassess an album that isn't quite as derivative and tossed-off as you might remember.</p>
<p>Since it shared some of their previous album's stylistic tendencies, a few listeners were left trying to pinpoint where the groove ended and the rut began when the album first came out. It's still regarded in some circles as a water-treading attempt to continue drawing off the aggro-punk/garage-funk blueprint of <i>Check Your Head</i>, and lord knows I'll probably draw some what-the-fucks for opining that <i>Ill Communication</i>'s actually a fair bit better. But once the Beasties got a steady grip on their live-band sound, the fact that they found a way to reincorporate the gleefully adolescent goofiness of <i>Licensed to Ill </i>and the retro-funk style and pop-culture obsessions of<i> Paul's Boutique</i> is what really let them put together their ideal here-to-stay mission statement.</p></div>"|13319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13319-ill-communication-deluxe-edition/|8.6|Nate Patrin

The Most Serene Republic are, as they always have been, a big band; seven members, expansive arrangements, eyes on the horizon, that sort of thing. They're effective when they sound like a small band, too-- when they manage to wrench as much power out of their tenderest, most threadbare moments as they are when seven people are banging the hell out of their instruments. Though they've had gossamer moments on their two LPs and 2006's fine <i>Phages</i> EP, what they've not yet done is make a record that strikes the right balance between their formidable skills as arrangers and instrumentalists and their penchant for penning affecting, Stars/Mates of State-esque twilight melodrama; you know, retrofitting their little heartbreaks with just the right amount of bombast. Their latest, <i>...And the Ever Expanding Universe</i>, gets grandiose in nearly all the right places; it's the singing part of the songs that could use a little beefing up.</p>
<p>It took them long enough, but these Canadian many-piecers and Arts &amp; Crafts signees finally hooked up with producer of mostly MSR labelmates and Canadian many-piecers Dave Newfeld for <i>Universe</i>. It's Newfeld, so the difference is clear; surely I can't be the first to liken his work behind the boards to bobbing up and down in mildly troubled waters on an otherwise beautiful afternoon, but whatever the description, if you've listened to much indie rock in the past five years or so, you know it well. Newfeld helps MSR suss out some of their tendencies towards overcrowding and lends the quieter moments a lovely glow, but as with most Newfeld productions, there aren't many moments where you can't hear the guy conducting; one can't help but wonder if he's instructing guitarists to strum everything in that dun-dun-d-dun ""Almost Crimes"" rhythm.</p>
<p>I mention all this not to belittle the band's role in its own record, but to reemphasize: <i>...And the Ever Expanding Universe</i> is a truly gorgeous sounding album, and while that's certainly got plenty to do with Newfeld, it's no less impressive for it. Arrangements pop where before they might simply pile it on, and songs rise and fall with requisite grace. The formula of 2007's overworked <i>Population</i> hasn't changed significantly, it's just been, er, expanded upon; it's roughly the equivalent of seeing a movie you've grown up with on TV on a big screen for the first time, and everything's just a bit brighter and given a lot more room to walk around. I'd argue, too, that Adam Moerder's closing complaint in his review of <i>Population</i> was met about halfway here: melody lines do bob and weave-- there's plenty of diversity between the relatively straight-up strum-pop of ""Heavens to Purgatory"" to the synth throb of ""Don't Hold Back, Feel a Little Longer"" and lightly orchestrated ""Patternicity"" to answer that charge-- but when you remove the window dressing, the songs still seem a little shabby.</p>
<p>But this is, after all, a big band, and you've got to give all those idle hands something to do. Besides, those instrumental passages are the songs as much as anything with a fuckton of flutes on a Sufjan record is. I suppose the trouble lies in the fact that the most memorable parts of <i>Universe</i>, just as with the band's past work, tend to be the instrumental flourishes rather than the singing-- a weird thing for a vocal pop record. It's a manifold problem: Adrian Jewett affects a near-brogue when he sings so even his most assured vocal lines feel a bit swallowed, Emma Ditchburn's got kind of a wispy Isobel Campbell thing going on, which doesn't really fly in a mix this busy, and when the two double up (as they so often do), it's all those things at once.</p>
<p>Indeed, there's a couple of impressive vocal turnarounds in opener ""Bubble Reputation"" and ""Heavens to Purgatory""; bless their hearts for singing ""gadzooks gadzooks gadzooks!"" on that one with reasonably straight faces. But even the most straightahead track here, the slightly Jock Jammy ""Don't Hold Back, Feel a Little Longer"" is more compelling in its clatter than its crooning. Structurally and, gadzooks aside, lyrically, the non-orchestrated are fine; it's just that a sound this expansive needs more swagger behind the mic, lest the tunes get lost in the fray yet again. At least this time out, losing yourself in the fray's not a bad way to go.</p></div>"|13255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13255-and-the-ever-expanding-universe/|6.5|Paul Thompson

The L.A.-via-Boston label started out in New Mexico in the 1990s bending the rules of hardcore punk with bands like Converge, Cave In, Coalesce, and Botch. About five years ago, Hydra Head began taking on metal. Influential acts like Jesu, Khanate, and Xasthur have stretched metal's boundaries. Now metal includes the fuzzy, the broken, and the weak-- characteristics antithetical to traditional metal (precise, constructed, strong). In short, Hydra Head metal is art metal. Purists hate it for abandoning metal culture. In place of the metal uniform (black shirts, blue denim) is an array of pastel colors. Goodbye, spikes and leather; hello, trucker hats. Those who like loud guitars but are scared of metalheads can get with Hydra Head.</p>
<p>On one hand, the label's metal is a diluted kind. Few things are as powerful as pure, uncut metal, whether it be death metal, doom metal, black metal, or thrash. These subgenres have had decades to work out ideal formulations. But purity can come from fence-sitting if that is an artist's nature. Sweden's Bergraven, a one-man band by Pär Gustafsson, is one example. Its debut, 2004's <i>Fördärv</i>, didn't know whether to be black metal or something else. The record's black metal was serviceable, but stray codas and preludes suggested a predilection for psychedelia. Three years later, follow-up <i>Dödsvisioner</i> embraced such duality. Bergraven turned into sort of a dark rock act. Elements of black metal, like raspy vocals and raw guitars, remained, but clean tones and bent melodies weaved throughout. Unlike much of black metal, the band had an identity.</p>
<p><i>Till Makabert Väsen</i> goes further down this path. Now the melodies are elongated and spidery. Their off-kilter dissonance suggests a quieter Deathspell Omega. Slint playing black metal might sound like this. Gustafsson doesn't forget to step on the distortion pedal, though. After wandering through funhouses of skewed high end, songs return to big, rocking riffs. Fellow Swedes Lifelover similarly mate black metal and pop, though they are more tongue-in-cheek. Katatonia on hallucinogens also comes to mind. Some passages suggest Opeth's ornate prog, though much spicier. Pop music often compresses huge worlds into small structures. Bergraven does the opposite. Song start small, then grow tendrils, teeth, and fur. Five minutes later, they're roaring and hissing. Then the shoots and leaves return to the ground. They leave behind an aroma with many notes: black metal, rock, pop, studio weirdness. The smell is unmistakably Bergraven's.</p></div>"|13256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13256-till-makabert-vasen/|7.5|Cosmo Lee

The song, about meeting a chick at an awesome frat party and more generally about how great it was to go to a college with a monstrous enrollment, is played earnestly and without a whiff of irony, like Robert Pollard with his leg kicks and British affectations, or Brandon Flowers doing whatever Brandon Flowers does.  It then becomes a matter of my own taste that I find it so hard to sign off on beer-bongs and cornhole as the source of viable cultural expression, even when it's done well, as it is here. Even more, I realize the irony in that I have no problem with Thin Lizzy's bro-down ""The Boys Are Back in Town"", which Baby Teeth use as the foundation for ""Schools"". Hell, even Steely Dan's ""My Old School"" was at least about a <i>drug bust</i>.</p>
<p>Yet the fact that Baby Teeth go full bore on song one into an aesthetic that would no doubt make many Pitchfork readers run for the safety of their Hold Steady LPs makes me respect these dudes. Even better though, graduating from ""Big Schools"" dumped me out into a record that does what few American indie bands are willing to do nowadays: sound like a really good college bar band.  These guys clearly grew up listening to classic rock radio and watching MTV, and I'm assuming they're in their early thirties-- if not, then they fake it well-- because integration of the FM era's most <i>outre</i> top 40 stuff, from glam to power pop, bandannaed cock-rock and New Romanticism, shouldn't come this easy, or sound this good.</p>
<p>This mix sounds over the top, sure, but it turns out that the best part of <i>Beach</i> is its sense of control-- not to be ""tasteful,"" but just to stop things from flying over the top. Singer Abraham Levitan tempers his occasional histrionics with plenty of restraint, and the band thankfully eschews too much grandiosity in lieu of simple arrangements, sticky melodies, and hooks. ""Shrine""s refrain puts Pollard's melodic swagger over a <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i> bed, and ""The Part You Play"" bends a standard lovelorn lyric into a plaintive, almost soulful wail.  Don't front: if the high-gloss danger and spiky synths of ""Hustle Beach"" and the geeky siren wails on ""Snake Eyes"" were made by a group from Paris, or posted on a .rar blog specializing in out of print early-80s New Wave, you'd be all over this.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the sociological part of my brain wants to position Baby Teeth as the lower-stakes, Midwestern Vampire Weekend, and my indier-than-thou side wants to assert that Dan Bejar does more inventive things with similar source material, while creating his own mythology to boot. While all of this stuff might be true on some level, none of it, again, has anything to do with the band.  Sure, deep down they might think they're pulling one over on the world by sneaking bits of Billy Squier here and there. But who cares, right? It might be hard for some of us, but, especially when the biggest indie song of the year features a protagonist worried about his social status, it's a bit refreshing to hear a band clearly <i>not</i> looking over their shoulders.</p></div>"|13259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13259-hustle-beach/|7.1|Eric Harvey

Not that there's anything wrong with a clearly savvy listener like Borges resurrecting a bunch of once-familiar or never-remembered gems from other artists and interpreting them in her own individual voice and style. But two or three covers per record seems about enough, especially for someone who's already shown she has interesting things to say on her own. Borges' debut featured only four non-originals, yet between her 2007 sophomore release <i>Diamonds in the Dark</i> and the new <i>The Stars Are Out</i>, Borges (with her terrifically-named band, the Broken Singles) has released 22 songs, a full 10 of which have previously been recorded by someone else-- almost all of them, it bears mentioning, by someone quite good.</p>
<p>One clear testament to the fact that Borges is a pretty damn strong tunesmith is the fact that it's not always readily obvious which of her songs are the covers and which are her own compositions. <i>Diamonds in the Dark </i>included material penned by X and Tom Waits as well as a song popularized by Dolly Parton, yet Borges' own moodily metaphorical ""Modern Trick"" and heartbreaking ""Belle of the Bar"" stood nearly shoulder to shoulder with those selections, while ""The Day We Met"", ""Lonely Town of Love"", and ""Lord Only Knows"" showed her assured command of the bar-rock basics. Unfortunately, the originals on <i>The Stars Are Out</i> aren't always as impressive, and in fact some of the ""is this a cover?"" head-scratching owes more to Borges' imitative sonic and lyrical choices, like the outdated talk of ""party dresses"" on the girl-group-influenced ""Me and Your Ghost"" or the overt fusion of southern rock and bubblegum girl-punk on the opening ""Do It For Free"". Both of these songs are fine for what they are, but do worryingly seem to be the kind of pastiche stuff that normally would represent the high-water mark for a covers-dependent artist. Luckily, we have ""Symphony"" to prove that's not the case with Borges-- it's a lovely, arty song largely devoid of bar-rock influence, marked by pensive acoustic guitar, soaring violin and a wonderfully affectless vocal turn from its author.</p>
<p>And then there are the covers themselves, of course, which I'll admit are admirably inspired in the sheer variety of Borges' source material, and on the whole quite engagingly read. NRBQ's ""It Comes to Me Naturally"" is bar-rock boilerplate, and it's pretty hard to fuck up Smokey Robinson (Borges doesn't on ""Being with You""), but unearthing the 1980 nugget ""Yesterday's Love"" from Costello soundalikes Any Trouble is certainly laudable, as is digging up the Lemonheads' shaggy ""Ride with Me"" and daring to take on ""No One Will Ever Love You"" from the Magnetic Fields' classic <i>69 Love Songs</i>. Borges remains a skilled, sensitive interpreter, and because she seems so comfortable in her skin as a keenly sympathetic music buff and sometime songwriter, it's hard to really knock the path she's currently following. Still, I can't help wishing she'd let her own muse have a bit more of the spotlight.</p></div>"|13318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13318-the-stars-are-out/|5.9|Joshua Love

But really, these are the places where classic rock goes to die, fossilized onto playlists that haven't been updated since the second Black Crowes album. You think it's hard getting attention for your psych-folk-disco-shitgaze collective? Try being an up-and-coming meat-and-potatoes blues-rock band, who are shut out from both hipster-blog discourse and the sort of mainstream media channels that theoretically should be nurturing them. Most people laughed at the Blueshammer scene in <i>Ghost World</i>; me, I just felt sorry for those dudes-- because once they leave that bar, there's really nowhere else for them to go.<br/><br/>The plight of the post-millennial blues-rocker thus makes Jack White's ascent to superstardom all the more remarkable, having refashioned such dead-horse devices as slide-geetar riffs and Bonham-style boogies into something both exciting and exceedingly profitable. And he's done it by not just honoring the blues' authenticity, but exploiting the music's capacity for mythology, using it to color his world any way he sees fit, be it the candy-striped fantasyland of the White Stripes, or the wood-panelled, <i>Dazed and Confused</i>-style nostalgia trip of the Raconteurs. And it's the reason he's been able to extend his golden touch to now a third band, the Dead Weather, who delve even deeper into the blues' swampy roots and devil's-music deviancy, but in a manner that's every bit as stylized, sexually charged, and trashy as an episode of ""True Blood"". <br/><br/>Of course, the major difference this time out is that White's dropped the guitar and returned to his first instrument, the drums. But the rear-admiral position hardly diminishes his presence; arguably, it gives him an even better vantage point to direct his cast, which includes Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence, Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist/guitarist Dean Fertita, and, in the starring role, Alison Mosshart of the Kills. Even though the Dead Weather is unquestionably a full-band effort, <i>Horehound</i> is designed as a showcase for its lead vocalist as much as the White-produced <i>Van Lear Rose</i> was for Loretta Lynn-- Mosshart's face is front and center on the album cover, and after the cool electro-pop maneuvers of the Kills' <i>Midnight Boom</i>, her cat-in-heat performances on Horehound suggest an eagerness to bust out of that band's minimalist, drum-machined parameters, and give the sort of scrappy, scuzz-rock songs that defined the Kills' early releases a full-blooded treatment.<br/><br/>But while built from the same rudiments as its principals' other bands, the Dead Weather are greatly distinguished by a richness of atmosphere. Over its 11 tracks, <i>Horehound</i> rarely relents in its murky, humid, southern-gothic ambience-- one that's greatly thickened by Fertita's Dr. John-style organ mojo and Lawrence's array of fuzz-bass effects. And if both the White Stripes and the Raconteurs have traditionally positioned their singles in the album-opener slots, the Dead Weather take their sweet time to settle into the deep marshland miasma of ""60 Feet Tall""; taking a page from PJ Harvey's size-queen routine, Mosshart belts out the title as a badge of invincibility while the song ebbs and flows between solitary blues-picking and eruptions of blast-furnace noise. On top of setting up Horehound's greyscale scenery, ""60 Feet Tall"" also establishes White's drumming style for the album-- simple and steady-as-she-goes, favoring tension-building snare-rim rolls and strategically placed cymbal taps, with echoplexed accents to expand the sense of space.<br/><br/>Or, in the case of the less-than-incendiary (and not entirely representative) single ""Hang You From the Heavens"" or its sluggish sister track, ""No Hassle Night"", he'll trip up the rhythm in an attempt to make a repetitive blues-rocker sound more dynamic. But even when perched behind the kit, White's not one to turn down a duet with fetching female foil, and <i>Horehound</i> really shows its teeth when he and Mosshart battle for mic control. Thankfully they do often, blurring their voices on the gender-bending reggaeified funk strut ""I Cut Like a Buffalo""; playing call-and-response on a deliciously sleazy Led Zepped take on Bob Dylan's ""New Pony"" and the Bad Seedy chain-gang chant ""So Far From Your Weapon""; and, literally, playing tug of war for control of the Royal-monster-Trux groover ""Treat Me Like Your Mother"", which in Mosshart's hands sounds like less a plea for respect than an Oedipal enticement. Even <i>Horehound'</i>s most reverential blues gesture-- the strung-out acoustic reverie ""Will There Be Enough Water""-- retains the album's haunted vibe, with a completely spent White and Mosshart begging for a few life-saving drops that they know will never come. <br/><br/>The songs on <i>Horehound</i> don't so much rock as writhe, reinstituting the idea of the blues as a sinister, morally corrupting force that's as much the province of voodoo priests and witch doctors as musicians. Perhaps Jack White's continued dominance over contemporary blues-rock is in fact the product of some deal with the devil-- and if that means more bands as fully realized as the Dead Weather, let's hope that Beelzebub will consider a contract renewal.</p></div>"|13187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13187-horehound/|7.5|Stuart Berman

He is credited as being one of the first musicians to bring genuine African music to Western ears <i>en masse</i>, having burst on the scene in 1959 with his debut, <i>Drums of Passion</i>. It was the first known album of traditional West African drumming and chants to be recorded in the United States (Olatunji moved to Atlanta in 1950 before relocating permanently to New York City), and was released during a high tide of political and cultural change-- including appearing alongside epochal jazz recordings by Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, and Ornette Coleman. As listeners were exposed to different styles and the collective interest in world music and jazz continued to grow in popularity, Olatunji helped turn people's attention away from the corny melodies that dominated the exotica genre fad by offering authentic, captivating songs from his native homeland.</p>
<p>Six years after Olatunji's death at age 75, and 50 years after its original release, <i>Drums of Passion</i> has received the deluxe treatment as a beautifully packaged 2xCD containing its companion album <i>More Drums of Passion</i> (1966) and a well-chosen smattering of jazz-influenced bonus tracks, some of which were previously unreleased in the U.S.  It also benefits from considerate remastering: the sound snaps with color, defining the rhythmic fabric with greater clarity while illuminating the integrity and magnetic intensity of Olatunji's arrangements. In some ways, the impact of this sonic resuscitation feels even more vital on a recording that is structured primarily by multiple tiers of voice and percussion, as the distinction between them were often tricky to capture, particularly in studios with comparatively limited equipment.</p>
<p>Olatunji frequently drafted a vivacious, disparate ensemble of musicians and vocalists to contribute to his recordings, and many of these people drifted in and out of the studio unknown and unaccredited. By its very nature, his music is designed to be performed by large groups-- it is this communal input that gives <i>Drums of Passion</i> its infectious vitality and relentlessly entertaining energy. The elated female and male chants on ""Odun De! Odun De! (Happy New Year)"" glide over a knot of polyrhythms, while the call and response vocals on ""Baba Jinde (Flirtation Dance)"" are injected with so many whoops and jeers that the song ends up sounding like a pack of copulating hyenas, pinned down by a surge of ecstatic Afro-Cuban rhythms.</p>
<p>""The spirit of the drum is something that you feel but cannot put your hands on,"" Olatunji once explained to an interviewer. ""It does something to you from the inside out. It hits people in so many different ways, but the feeling is one that is satisfying and joyful."" This zeal lay at the root of Olatunji's music, and is arguably felt more ferociously on <i>Drums of Passion</i> than any other of his many recordings. It may not be as immediately accessible as some of his later work, but in terms of improvisational liveliness and the sheer animation of his rhythmic phrasing and arrangements, it’s hard to beat. Over the last several decades, fans of world music have had access to a plethora of material from all over the globe. But it's worth retracing the steps to this virtuoso, who not only brought genuine West African music to popular attention but also influenced musicians such as Quincy Jones, the Grateful Dead, and Bob Dylan. Olatunji was a remarkable entertainer, whose impression on world music is as enjoyable and significant now as it was in the early 1960s. He has achieved a gold standard in music: Timelessness, and an ardor that does not simply simmer but glows fiercely, and joyfully, from within.</p></div>"|13258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13258-drums-of-passion/|8.2|Mia Clarke
