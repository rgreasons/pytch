If these two simultaneously released Merge LPs were a double album, it would be too long, too bloated, and too much to digest-- like 95% of all double albums. As two individual records at 16 to 17 tracks apiece, <i>Coast to Coast Carpet of Love</i> and <i>Standard Gargoyle Decisions</i> are both nearly as exhausting as double albums themselves and prone to the same problems.</p>
<p>Moreover, the somewhat arbitrary distinction between the two albums-- <i>Carpet</i> supposedly angles for power pop, while <i>Gargoyle</i> explores rawer rock territory-- only means the former features more of producer/accompanist Todd Tobias' keyboards (set to 'auto-swoon' as usual), although the songs on that one are probably more consistent and hit their modest mark a bit more often. Were you to consume these two records in an impatient, disrespectful, and completely human way-- say, by deleting the weaker tracks from your iPod and keeping the better ones-- you'd end up with Pollard's strongest record since dissolving GbV, and one that would at least stand up to the albums that band recorded during their second stint at Matador. By and large, Pollard has found his groove.</p>
<p>In <i>Standard Gargoyle Decisions</i>' best moments, it's a record about rhythm. Drums have a renewed focus, snapping and hissing and almost overwhelming in the final moments of ""Killers"", whip-cracking in the cowboy strut of ""Pill Gone Girl"", and galloping through the prog-inspired stops and starts ""A Hero Blows the Revolution"". There's a long stretch of forgettable tracks between those and late-album highlights (such as the simmering anthem ""Feel Not Crushed"" or the irrepressible energy of punk-cribbing closer ""Spider Eyes""), but even the lesser tracks benefit from more diversity, interesting production, and Pollard's immutable charm.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Coast to Coast</i> holds up better, playing like a careful and more confident refinement of last year's <i>Normal Happiness</i> as Pollard moves just outside his usual comfort zone without overreaching. There's nothing that doesn't ""rock"" about opener ""Our Gaze"", with its insistent guitar line and vocal providing catchy countermelodies. Of course, the track sequencing is again mystifying here, wedging two of Pollard's most winding and unpredictable songs between the opener and ""Current Desperation (Angels Speak of Nothing)"", patient pop that layers several sparkling guitar tones under Pollard's comforting croon. Still, there's no skipping or waiting around for inspiration here; ""Dumb Lady"" navigates its circuitous and wobbly melody to a satisfying end, ""Customer's Throat"" turns a few staccato notes into simple, but ominous power pop, and even the backwards faux-eastern tones of ""Pnumbra"" are tempered by sweetened harmonies. These may all be small-scale successes for Pollard, but they're successes nonetheless.</p>
<p>It's unlikely there will ever be another record from Pollard that could be all things to all fans, not just due to the expectations set by GbV's mid-90s peak, but because Pollard's many side projects allow him to indulge his stranger inspirations across entire records, rather than in brief, quirky experiments tucked between hits. Still, after his latest collaboration with the Takeovers (singing over pre-recorded tapes) and thoughtfully balanced records like these that take a few chances without losing focus, hearing a record from Pollard that's both concise and still weird doesn't seem impossible. He doesn't always sound inspired here, but he sounds a whole lot more like himself.</p></div>"|11911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11911-coast-to-coast-carpet-of-love-standard-gargoyle-decisions/|7.0|Jason Crock

    Many years ago, making small talk with a Chicago cab driver, the subject of music came up. ""You know, I used to sing with Sam Cooke,"" the man suddenly revealed. He then proceeded to sing Cooke's ""Cupid"" with perfect pitch and timing, like a pro. So was he telling the truth? Who knows? The point being, there are still great singers walking among us, some of them forgotten, some of them retired, some of screwed over beyond repair, and very few of them ever given the kind of second shot afforded Bettye LaVette.</p><p>
    On her 2005 comeback <em>I've Got My Own Hell to Raise</em>, LaVette recorded songs written by Lucinda Williams, Sinead O'Connor, Fiona Apple, and Aimee Mann-- unlikely songwriters for a Detroit-raised vet of the soul circuit to tackle, no doubt chosen from a pile of potential tracks hand-picked by producer Joe Henry. For <em>The Scene of the Crime</em>, LaVette made the perhaps equally unusual choice of hooking up with the Drive-By Truckers.</p><p>
    Loyal sons of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, the Drive-By Truckers know their Southern soul. But as a guitar band par excellence, the Truckers have never really shown how they would fare actually playing soul. Yet LaVette, by all accounts, suffers no fools, and knows exactly what she's doing; you don't survive as long as she has in the music world without some good instincts. It turns out her long-lost album <em>Child of the Seventies</em> was recorded in Muscle Shoals and featured David Hood (father of DBTs singer Patterson) on bass, making the aptly named <em>Scene of the Crime</em> a sort of exorcism of lingering bad feelings over that earlier album's mistreatment (and mysterious shelving).
    </p>
<p>
    Patterson Hood is back for more on this disc, and legendary songwriter and keyboard player Spooner Oldham rounds out the line-up, but the spotlight here is shared by LaVette and her partners in crime the Drive-By Truckers. It turns out to be a pretty smart choice. The Truckers may excel at Southern rock writ large, but they're respectful enough to hold back. Not that their playing is necessarily in check on <em>Scene of the Crime</em>, but it is exceedingly simple and sympathetic, ceding LaVette every inch of space she needs.
    </p>
<p>
    She needs a fair amount, too, since unlike such fellow comebacks (and Anti- labelmates) Solomon Burke and Mavis Staples, LaVette's singing hasn't really been diminished by the passage of time, or at least not so much that it really matters. Here LaVette is all growl, snarl, bark, and, if you train your ear to the nuances in her delivery, sometimes deliciously mean and mirthful, too. As for the band, the Truckers have never sounded so groove-minded as they do here, particularly the rhythm section of Brad Morgan and Shonna Tucker but also guitarist Mike Cooley, relegated for once to a mere supporting roll but excelling at his flash-free duties.
    </p>
<p>
    LaVette is a proud interpreter, and even back in her earlier days she was covering David Bowie and Neil Young, but on <em>Scene of the Crime</em> her choices are a little less NPR-friendly than they were on the all-female critics darling roster of <em>Hell to Raise</em>. Here she handles Willie Nelson's ""Somebody Pick Up My Pieces"" like one of Ray Charles' legendary country excursions, and tackles Elton John's ""Talking Toy Soldiers"" with the kind of gritty gusto John could never muster. But she also underscores John Hiatt's status as one of the most underrated contemporary singer-songwriters with his ""The Last Time"", and does the same for Eddie Hinton's ""I Still Want to Be Your Baby (Take Me Like I Am)"".
    </p>
<p>
    The sole original, co-written with Patterson Hood, is the autobiographical ""Before the Money Came (The Battle of Bettye LaVette)"", a where-you-been? round-up. ""I was singing r&amp;b back in 62, before you were born, and your mama, too/ I knew David Ruffin when he was homeless, sleeping on my floor before he crossed over/ All my friends on the Grammy show, I was stuck in Detroit, trying to open doors/ Record deals kept falling apart, one with Atlantic nearly broke my heart.""
    </p>
<p>
    LaVette sings that last line like she's pulling a knife out of her side, releasing every bit of frustration, pain, and disappointment from her soul. Of course, she's the one getting the last laugh. ""Forty years I kept singing, before the money started rolling in!"" she declares. But it's not just the cash that's bringing her so much satisfaction in 2007. It's the principle.

    Aside from the inky black-and-white shots of the group on the back of their clean, cryptic album packaging, it's hard to tell where Cloak/Dagger's allegiances lie. You might guess from the label, Jade Tree, which in the past few years has been a haven for artists like Fucked Up who maintain the punk formula while trying to push it forward, getting experimental without losing the simple pleasure of smashing away on a few power chords. Cloak/Dagger, however, aren't nearly so ambitious. To paraphrase a wise man-- Anthony Kiedis in <em>Point Break</em>-- that would be a waste of time. They just wanna fuck you up.</p><p>
    The trebly, in-the-red production may quickly become exhausting to some ears, but this record will sound punishing out of any stereo imaginable, be it iPod, PA, car, or ham radio. I admire that. While they clearly have one foot in early hardcore, they also make moves similar to purists like Hot Snakes, though they're more uniform in tone, and without the tunes. There are more shifts in dynamics than hooks, and even those take a few spins to really distinguish.</p><p>
    The first four tracks blow past without taking a breath: ""Bended Knee"" dispenses notes at such a rapid pace, they're barely discernible, collapsing over each other like a cartoon locomotive crash. The consistent frenzy of ""Suburnt Mess"" still builds a certain tension that fades straightaway into ""Runways"", where the guitars find a few empty corners to stretch out as singer Jason Mazzola chokes through lyrics where you can make out the words ""victims"" and ""suburbs,"" but not much more. The uncertain minor chord that ends ""Kamikazes"" might be the first moment of pause.
    </p>
<p>
<em>We Are</em> lacks a balance between melody and thrash, something to get across more than just the impression of being pummeled, but there's plenty here to suggest the band may find it in the near future. In the record's best moments, there are fleeting moments of stunning musicianship that never get in the way of the perpetually-in-5th-gear rhythms, like the arch ringing notes in the chorus of ""Red Hair"" that precede a scant few moments of lightning-fast rhythmic guitar picking, while ""Walk the Block"" adds some fine distractions-- an upper-string riff here, an octave there-- that sound completely epic in the center of a uniformly ugly, spittle-soaked debut.
    </p>
<p>
    While they cop to influences like Black Flag and D.I., and there's more than a few fist-pump chants over staccato chords in tracks like ""Walk the Block"" and ""J.C. Pays the Bills"", Cloak/Dagger aren't strictly punk just because they're comparable in the speed and consistently choked, angst-ridden delivery. You could just as easily call it no-frills rock, dedicated to dirty minimalism and with delivered with a modicum of taste-- really, what more could you ask for?

The title track kicking off this record delivers on those signs-- over a canned prison-break siren and backward vocals straight from a metal-is-Satan trial, the group put forth their best tough-guy rock stomp, claiming ""this is what it sounds like when heads roll...and you're gonna want more.""  They spend the next thirteen tracks doing everything in their power to prove that claim wrong.</p><p>
    From the look and sounds of things, the Donnas wanted <em>Bitchin'</em> to be an over-the-top pop-metal album-- there are blatant nods to Joan Jett (""Don't Wait Up For Me"") and Def Leppard (""Save Me""), a brief lyrical wink at post-makeup Kiss (in the title track), and loads of production flourishes that conjure images of pretty boys gussied up in tight pants and topiary-like hair structures.  In this setting, the Donnas' usual talking points-- bad boys, drinking, lame boys, drinking, bars, drinking-- would seem like a perfect fit.  Unfortunately, the gift of lewd gab that the group once possessed in spades (last seen on <em>Spend the Night</em>) is still AWOL.  If you're hoping for put-downs on the level of the ""Charlie Brown shirt / Cavariccis"" TKO, you may as well just watch a ""Will &amp; Grace"" rerun.</p><p>
    The record's title seems to have less to do with describing some level of awesomeness and more to do with the attitude behind whiny song-posed questions like, ""What do I have to do to make you want me?""  Sure, they still talk the talk, but every time the girls claim they're here for the party or they're like an animal around some guy, it sounds like they're doing an awful job of convincing their parents that they're going to the library and not the house party one town over.  Brett Anderson trying to sing such sentiments, instead of using the bored growl that worked so well in the past, doesn't help matters-- she sounds great and un-Donna-like on ""Love You Till It Hurts"", but otherwise comes off as a pale shadow of her former glory.  The songwriting, which attempts to split the difference between their humble beginnings and the stabs at relative sophistication from their last record, also needs to shoulder some of the blame.  It's great that the group's gotten better at playing their instruments, but it doesn't matter how well you play if the songs you're playing are either flat rewrites of ""Photograph"" or just plain flat.
    </p><p>
    The entire album sounds like a half-hearted compromise between what the group was and what the group wants to become.  If The Donnas fully committed to making a gloriously gaudy paean to Aquanet and spandex-- if they brought in Bob Rock or Mutt Lange (or a reasonable facsimile) to work their magic behind the boards, if they put the over-the-top flourishes (like the lion roar in ""Like an Animal"", or the vocoder in the intro to ""Girl Talk"") front and center-- I've no doubt the result would've been spectacular.  If The Donnas wanted to continue refining their songcraft and follow the initial steps they took with <em>Gold Medal</em>, it would've been commendable (if not enjoyable).  Instead, their attempts to take leaps forward without forgetting their roots just leaves The Donnas going nowhere.  Instead of coming off like the girls that know what's what, the Donnas now sound like the wanna-bes they used to love to hate.

It was between songs during Black Kids' set at Athens Popfest, and the singer/guitarist's onstage banter wasn't sounding quite as sharp as his songwriting. The guitar-jangling, Jacksonville-based five-piece were hardly ""struggling"" musically, though: Eyewitness raves about the performance spread faster than you can say ""Technorati,"" and positive notices soon followed from the <em>NME, Vice, </em><em>The Guardian</em>, and, yes, Pitchfork. All this for a band with no announced label, or even much touring history.<br/></p><p>
    You can download Black Kids' four-song demo, <em>Wizard of Ahhhs</em>, for free on <strong><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blackkidsrock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their MySpace</a></strong>-- it's not available in stores. They're giving away something we can't buy often enough: a record with not just a distinctive aesthetic, but also one single-worthy track after another. Dueling keyboards and scrappy lo-fi guitars give rise to Go! Team-style shouted-back cheers, a communal urgency not unlike the Arcade Fire's, and an uptempo bounce paying homage to Motown 45's. In short, Black Kids make catchy, tightly executed songs that put a memorable stamp on pop's classic themes.</p><p>
    Black Kids offer their most immediate bid for pop dominance with the ridiculously good ""I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance With You"", which we put <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/45801-black-kids-im-not-gonna-teach-your-boyfriend-how-to-dance-with-you-mp3stream"">on repeat</a></strong> over at Forkcast a couple weeks back. Here, Youngblood's reverb-doused guitar spars with Owen Holmes' declarative bass, Kevin Snow's drums, and bright keyboards by Dawn Watley and Youngblood's sister Ali over whether there will be dancing, or just pogoing.
    </p><p>
    Even when Youngblood doesn't get the girl, he's an astute enough student of Morrissey's to shade his songs with playful gender ambiguity: ""You are the girl that I've been dreaming of ever since I was a little girl,"" he sings on ""I'm Not Gonna Teach"". On ""Hurricane Jane"", a staccato guitar riff leaves room for decadent synths and a bare, melodic bass line. ""Oh, you've been playing nice, but I can see it in your eyes/ You're thinking, 'Christ, he's everybody's girl,'"" Youngblood describes, then trades question marks for exclamation points on an ecstatically miserable chorus: ""It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody/ What's the use of making the bed?"" The object of his affection, voiced by either Watley or Ali Youngblood, ain't having it.
    </p>
<p>
    On <em>Wizard of Ahhhs</em>, though, it's just as likely the girls will be chasing the boy. Opener ""Hit the Heartbrakes"" backs up its goofy pun with surging lead guitar and such a cold (if tongue-in-cheek) move that only a guy who can <em>really</em> dance could hope to pull it off. He's really flattered, Youngblood explains, but there's no way he wants to meet the parents, let alone the siblings, nieces, and nephews: ""It's quite all right, you can stay the night/ But please be gone by next morning's light."" After all, ""It's not me, it's you."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The record leads to a beautifully conceited conclusion. On ""I've Underestimated My Charm (Again)"", Youngblood graciously blames his admirer's pain on his own charisma. He sings this deadpan to a girl caught, in a detail that would make Stuart Murdoch proud, ""giving head to a statue."" The track also suggests a broader fascination with pop history. There's a possible allusion to Positive K's ""I Got a Man"", an innocent 1950s chord progression on the verses, and a coda with the ostinato bass of classic Motown-- or at least the Arcade Fire's ""Wake Up"". ""Every time we kiss, it's like an inside joke I always miss,"" Youngblood finishes.  
    </p>
<p>
    Black Kids are such good-natured pop-cultural sponges that they opened their fateful Athens Popfest set by reciting a screwball exchange from the Jim Henson-directed David Bowie fantasy film <em>Labyrinth</em> (a back-and-forth borrowed from Cary Grant's <em>The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer</em>). It was an inside joke many might have missed. Black Kids are plenty savvy enough to have known exactly what they were doing when they changed their band's name from World War I femme fatale reference Mata Hari, even though the Youngblood siblings are the group's sole African-American members. Unduly provocative? Personally, I'm shocked to discover a great young guitar group whose name includes the word ""Kids."" What a world.

    embracing pop has always walked a fine line between self-awareness and
    seriousness. No one could cover Brian Eno as crunchy synth-pop (Superpitcher's
    ""Baby's on Fire"") or have a robot recite Sade over a stripped-down tech-house
    groove (Michael Mayer's ""Love Is Stronger Than Pride"") without planting their tongue
    somewhere in the vicinity of their cheek. But at the same time, this levity
    has been counterbalanced with the earnestness that's
    characterized the label's most emotive (and at times melodramatic) anthems-- see the rainsoaked optimism of Superpitcher's ""Tomorrow"", or the wistfully
    sighing vamps on Mayer's ""Falling Hands"". The label's flagship acts, Mayer and
    Superpitcher (real name Aksel Schaufler), have long flirted with both extremes
    of this pop spectrum (as well as a hefty chunk of straightforwardly physical
    dancefloor numbers), so their teaming up for an album under the Supermayer
    moniker left many anticipating that this might be the ultimate
    statement of Kompakt's emo-house aesthetic.</p><p>
    However, their half-hearted
    concept album <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Save the World </span>(if
    you can discern any concept beyond the garish cover-art you've beaten me) very
    deliberately refuses to rise to this challenge. Instead, the duo offer a
    ramshackle assemblage of dancefloor tracks, eccentric stabs at pop, and
    cinematic interludes with names like ""Superbrain Transmission"" and ""Psychoprogs
    Attack"". The distinction may be difficult to spot, as Mayer and Schaufler
    essentially are deploying the same stylistic tics in new combinations. This can
    be seen in the first proper song, ""The Art of Letting Go"", which lays a
    strained, sing-songy Schaufler vocal over a fitful live disco groove and an
    array of unexpected musical effects. Rather than execute an unlikely pop-contraption
    with deadpan seriousness, ""The Art of Letting Go"" sounds like a giant arrow
    pointing to a raised eyebrow.</p><p>
    This is levity of the wrong
    kind: Whereas Mayer and Reinhard Voigt's ""Unter Null"" courted disaster (but ultimately won over listeners) by including a Jam &amp; Spoon-style Balearic guitar hook,
    Supermayer's pop tracks preclude such risks through overt humour, childlike
    wonkiness and self-consciously small gestures. But smaller risks means smaller
    rewards, and while such moments can be charming, they're difficult to really
    love. Which is not to say that the album isn't enjoyable, or that some of the
    duo's diversions aren't interesting. ""The Lonesome King"" is a surprisingly
    pretty psuedo-medieval ballad, flutes and synthesisers harmonising with winsome
    lugubriousness. The sparkly and bouncy, goblin-voiced ""Us and Them"" sounds like
    the work music for the elves in Santa's workshop, but is less annoying and more
    enjoyable than you'd think. At times such efforts recreate the magic
    whimsicality of labelmate Justus Köhncke's best work, but this kind of thing is
    Köhncke's home turf, whereas Mayer and Schaufler sound like they're only just
    getting their bearings.
    </p><p>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""></span>If Mayer and Schaufler were
    more prolific, this investment in a slight, mildly half-baked side project would
    be more sympathetic. But it's been three years since these artists released
    their respective debut albums, with only the barest trickle of solitary tracks
    since then, and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Save the World</span>'s
    blithe disregard of expectations can seem trying. Amidst such recalcitrance,
    it's a breath of fresh air to encounter the brooding, synth-laden tech-house of
    ""Saturndays"", whose bleepy chords, wet snares and shimmering synthesisers so
    straightforwardly fuse the most recognisable aspects of Mayer and Schaufler's
    respective aesthetics that on a stronger album the track might be dismissed as
    generic.
    </p>
<p>
    As such, this is an easy
    album to underestimate and then dismiss. Which would be a shame, as there's a
    fair amount of very good material here, from the plangent piano tinkling and
    Balearic glide of ""Please Sunrise"", to the energetic uptempo Chicago house of
    ""Planet of the Sick"". What the album needs is one or two knockout moments to
    anchor the duo's wanderings. The closest it comes is ""Two of Us"", a menacing
    track whose unexpected glockenspiel hook falls just on the right side of
    cheese. It's close to thrilling, but it's not moving, and it's the lack of a
    single moment to make your heart swell that feels like <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Save the World</span>'s fatal flaw.

    Few (if any) reviewers of Le Loup's debut so far have bothered to know, or research, or point out that, wow, these ballsy kids named their debut album after the pinnacle of outsider art: the golden seat for Jesus built from trash over 14 years by South-Carolina-cum-Washington-D.C. loner/janitor James Hampton. Several cluelessly cited the band for the album title's ""quirky"" and ""arduous"" unwieldiness, even though the record's blog hit is named after the imperative (FEAR NOT) on the sign that Hampton hung over the mammoth structure. Cult author Denis Johnson even co-opted the lengthy phrase for his <em>Collected Poems</em>, and included a picture of the Throne on the book's cover. His title poem about the work could be read as a prompt for Le Loup's rural-versus-urban, organic-versus-machinated, new-math sound-- Johnson describes the structure of ""the forest"" and ""the city"" as systems so full of ""stuttering mystic replication"" and ""blithering symmetry"" that they make you ""go crazy.""</p><p>
    The above stuff is just more reason why Le Loup's, you know, pleasant and even artful indie folk-- that's almost all it is, promise-- is difficult to appraise/enjoy on its own merits due to the icky/lazily hyperbolic and expectant climate around it, some of which the band brought on itself, some of which is circumstantial, and the rest of which was generated by them ever hype-democratizing bloggers. The incongruities between aspects of Le Loup's promotion/reception problematize the whole endeavor of typing about music, and by extension, your skimming of that typing.</p><p>
    One can't ""just listen,"" right; isn't that what is implied by blog posts about bands to watch? More than the music must be ""observed,"" a band's name must be propped between high-profile, supposed soundalikes (Le Loup get saddled as both So You Think You Can Arcade Fire and America's Next Top Sufjan), inaccurate clichés and mushbrained stereotypes must be tossed at it for blurry context (banjo=Appalachia, very simple songs + seven band members=intricate and complex music), and then the band's show-by-show evolution must be tracked on the back of a box of Instant Legacy cereal flakes, until the inevitable Discard By date apocalyproaches. Just as open-ended, tabloidy narrative arcs, with uninteresting characters, saturate the 24-7 news cycle (""the Lohan chronicles""/""the Britney saga"") to help there be enough (non-progressive and misanthropic) news, the burden of currency on the mp3-osphere often oversells its freeware for the sake of constantly a) generating interest in blah content, and b) flattering the consumer with faux omniscience re: a cultural moment (Band of the Week!/ Day!/ Nanosecond!). Okay, okay: I teach an introductory composition course at an open-door school in the South, and some of the most inane fucking bullshit I've ever read has been published online about Le Loup.
    </p>
<p>
    Please note: Le Loup's music is not uninteresting or blah-- it's often beautiful (more so in the scruffy/uncanny K Records way than the babysitting/unchallenging Starbucks way) and risks such seriousness that some listeners will no doubt find its handful of straight-faced songs about the end of the, er, world sort of silly. ""Canto I"" sets up the emo-Dante vibe, its fragile spoken-word bit and expanding banjo-riff atmospherics aping a fine Books B-side. I won't type the title of the third track but it's lovely: beginning as a kind of mash of virginy Stars and visionary Laurie Anderson, it ends as a stately minimal dance piece, suggesting a Factory Records single made in someone's bedroom. ""(Storm)"" decently glitches up a cloud's noise, ""We Are Gods! We Are Wolves!"" does homegrown handclap electronica, the organ-led ""Look to the West"" bursts from pompous whispers into rousing hell-yeah swagger, and elsewhere a kind of cyclic-Phil-Glass-versus-wispy-Cat-Stevens ethic obtains, never flirting with Tunng-like snooziness. 
    </p>
<p>
    Forget all the names I just dropped though, and try to forget how much revolutionary new music ends up later providing a context for shopping (I've actually heard: ""I only bought the stupid dress because the store was playing Panda Bear""). Don't freight Le Loup with D.C.'s venerable indie heritage, ignore know-nothings calling them ""amazing"" due to having grown up in a PR feedback loop that naturalizes messianic overestimation, and try not to emphasize the 9/11 release date. Let the deliberately infectious songs of Sam Simkoff and his six Craigslist recruits be, you know, songs, in your bedroom or on a walk or on a train, and they'll more than serve you well. Maybe they'll even survive.

Despite betraying his own moniker by transplanting from Pennsylvania to Brooklyn a few years ago, as well as the constant reshuffling of his musicians, Pond remains convinced that slow, steady, and innocuous wins the race. So without further ado, here's <em>Last Light</em>, MPPA's umpteen-trillionth release and first to deal with the themes of melancholic love and nighttime since some EP he released earlier this morning.</p><p>
    Remember that old joke about the Spice Girls selling so many albums yet you never knew anyone who owned one? MPPA provide an even more puzzling version of that paradox. Even with indie being steadily infiltrated by the smooth <em>World Cafe</em> aromas of AAA, it's hard conceiving what type of audience MPPA's tailored to. Their teenage pathos alienates anyone over 20, while teeny boppers have been slow to embrace a band with an aesthetic reminiscent of their parents' Phil Collins and David Gray CDs. Sure, they appeared on an ""O.C."" soundtrack, but their contributions were Neutral Milk Hotel and Oasis covers, begging the question-- is this band any more relevant than Howie Day?</p><p>
<em>Last Light</em>'s impressive guest list answers yes to this question, though the resulting music hardly supports that conclusion. Pond hopes some of Neko Case's alt-country expertise rubs off on twangy barroom ballad ""Taught To Look Away"", but her cameo's too short and too sweet. Guest producer Rob Schnapf, best known for his work on early Beck material and Elliott Smith's final four albums, proves no match for Pond's unwavering pop pabulum as <em>Last Light</em> sounds no grittier or darker than previous MPPA albums, excepting the brief, twisted <em>X/O</em> homage ""Wild Girl"" or dreamy piano-gaze of ""Until the East Coast Ends"", both tracks lasting less than two minutes. Rooney's Taylor Locke also drops by to pepper Pond's stale acoustic arrangements with some electric guitar, but his solos feel painfully mercenary, attempting to inject edge into songs not at all willing to shed their life-preservers.</p><p>
    So why doesn't the indie universe just pull the plug on this not-so-closet cafe band? Well, Pond occasionally manages to pull off a roaring, rousing chorus, like on the Pulp-y title track, or the massive stomping piano pop gem ""People Have a Way"", capable of forcing even the Polyphonic Spree's cathedral-sized reverb back into the narthex. Also, MPPA's remained fairly insulated from success, meaning there's no army of fans that'd feel betrayed if the band branched out and tried something experimental for a change. Still, the band's had innumerable chances to take these intrepid steps, and with yet another standardized LP of glorified Dave Matthews tunes, that glimmer of hope's fading fast.</p></div>"|10721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10721-last-light/|3.7|Adam Moerder

    Christopher Denny is off in a world of his own, which some
    might call Arkansas and others
    might call country. In promo photos, he sports a soul patch and overalls. On
    his debut album, <em>Age Old Hunger,</em> he
    writes songs about westbound trains and hearts on fire and feeling all burned
    up inside, which he sings in a voice pitched somewhere between the winnowy
    whine of Jimmie Dale Gilmore and the more forceful yodel of Slim Whitman. His
    is a distinctive instrument that would sound right at home on a low-signal
    Ozark radio station 40 or 50 years ago, but sounds out of time and out of place
    in the here and now-- such that his voice may prove an insurmountable hurtle
    for many listeners. Denny acknowledges these influences and others: He credits
    his teenage discovery of Lefty Frizzell and Hank Thompson with inspiring him to
    write songs, and on <em>Age Old Hunger</em> he
    covers popular, some might say obvious songs by Kris Kristofferson and Johnny
    Cash. To his credit, however, he never comes across as a nostalgia
    act, which for this genre would be excruciating. Rather, he is content to sound
    like he sounds.</p><p>
    That he can make all these elements work so well-- and on a
    debut, no less-- is a considerable accomplishment. It helps that his backing
    band, the Old Soles, aren't afraid to rough his songs up a little. With Denny
    leading on guitar and harmonica, the rhythm section of Chris Atwood and Marcus
    Lowe give these songs backbone, while Robbie Crowell adds flourishes of Hammond
    and barrelhouse piano. They can hold back on a ballad like ""The Stars Above and
    My Heart in Your Hands"" or cut loose on romps like the instrumental ""Goin'
    Home"" and the ecstatic ""Time"". They quicken the tempo on Johnny Cash's ""I Still
    Miss Someone"", making it slightly more upbeat, but Denny's vocals still sell
    the misery and loneliness. They take fewer liberties with Kris Kristofferson's
    ""Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)"": The Old Soles make
    the song sound like an unmade bed while Denny delivers a gently soulful
    performance that suggests an intuitive understanding of the lyrics as well as
    perhaps a very personal history with them.</p><p>
    Little Rock is far enough removed from any other scene--
    Memphis is two boring hours down I-40, Dallas and Jackson even further-- that
    an artist like Denny can flourish in relative solitude, developing his own
    sounds and styles apart from everyone else. Granted, technology now allows the
    dissemination of all sorts of music to every corner of the country, including
    the foothills of the Ozarks, blurring the regional distinctions that once
    defined Denny's heroes. Nevertheless, he comes across as an industry outsider, not
    just in the way he sings but even in the way his songwriting makes virtues of
    southern simplicity and downhome directness. 
    </p>
<p>
    Denny flirts with misogyny on the evil woman blues ""Gypsy Into
    a Carpenter"", whose accusations and condemnations sound jarrring on <em>Age Old Hunger, </em>especially for an album
    opener. But he quickly rights himself. On ""All Burned Up"" and ""Heart's on
    Fire"", he teases nuance from the pain of romantic uncertainty. ""When am I gonna realize I realize I really, truly do care?""
    he sings on ""When Am I Gonna Realize?"" ""When will I realize
    love is right here?"" ""Westbound Train"" is a gospel-stoked love song in
    which Denny tenderly testifies to love's stabilizing power. When the westbound
    train he and his lover are riding stops near where he once lived, he remarks, ""That place don't feel much like home anymore/ Darling, you feel
    much more like home to me."" The song's Dylanesque cadence and straightforward
    sentiment, like the rest of <em>Age Old
    Hunger,</em> sound sincere and even daring.

    Bob Dylan's recording career has been compiled and re-compiled so many times that his new 3xCD box set needed to have some kind of serious reason to exist-- it's got the responsibility to give us some kind of fresh take on him. Instead, it's the same damn songs they've been feeding us over and over for 40 years. (There was originally some talk about how the tracklisting would be determined by the votes of fans; that doesn't seem to have happened.) We don't even get that not-bad new Mark Ronson remix of ""Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)"". <em>DYLAN</em> is just his brittle canon of ""classics,"" undigested and unreconsidered, with stuff from his lesser records thrown in to fill it out.
    But half the point of Dylan is that he <em>doesn't</em> have a neat canon-- the first pop musician to be bootlegged has been spilling out around the edges since he gave himself his name and started trying out poses and masks. <em>DYLAN</em> (the title is all caps: you cannot escape from him) attempts to frame his body of work as a linear arc, and Dylan isn't a linear kind of guy. Think of him in an each-thing-leads-to-the-next way sense, and you end up with something like <strong><a href=""http://www.bobsboots.com/cds/2002Intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the spiel his concerts introduce him with</a></strong>: reading the headlines, missing the story.</p><p>
    Back in 1985-- roughly halfway into Dylan's career-- his label released <em>Biograph</em>, a retrospective box set that does the best job in his discography of explaining what's so special about him (it's not his best record, but his most well-rounded). <em>Biograph</em> also includes 9/10 of <em>Greatest Hits</em> (no ""Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35""), but it's packed with otherwise unavailable material and meticulously sequenced: not chronologically, but thematically. And it's meant for listening, refreshing overfamiliar songs by presenting them in a new light. </p><p>
<em>DYLAN</em>, on the other hand, is meant to sit on a bookshelf. It's unutterably boring, which is a rotten way to frame the achievements of one of the least boring musicians alive. It tries to represent his entire studio career in chronological order, which means it spends its first half-hour droning through some of his most embroynic and underdeveloped material. In the middle, a marathon set of his wordiest songs are assembled into an impenetrable block-- ""Changing of the Guards"" is a magnificent song, but preceded by ""Hurricane"" it's almost unbearable. Finally, it excerpts ""representative"" material from crummy 1980s and 90s records, concluding with a couple of indifferent tracks from last year's <em>Modern Times</em>.</p><p>
    Treating Dylan as a studio artist completely misrepresents the post-<em>Biograph</em> period, when he's essentially been a stage performer who puts out a record every so often-- Dylanophiles describe the 2000-plus shows he's played since 1988 as the ""Never Ending Tour"". What he plays on any given night has virtually nothing to do with the greatest-hits canon as it's represented here; his most recent gig, as I write this, included exactly three of the songs from <em>DYLAN</em>. A decently curated set of live stuff from the past 20 years would be a welcome addition to the discography, a portrait of the artist as the fascinating mess he really is.</p><p>
    In fact, the selection here is boring because it's so <em>un</em>-messy. The Bob of <em>DYLAN</em> is almost entirely the Serious Crafter of Fine Popular Music who wrote ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" and ""Make You Feel My Love"", not the burning-eyed mystical horndog who wrote ""Oh, Sister"", the self-righteous blues jukebox who wrote ""Gonna Change My Way of Thinking"", the absurdist comedian who wrote ""On the Road Again"", or the zombie clone of Luke the Drifter who wrote ""The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest"". There's more of a sense of Dylan's hilarity, passion and dizzying weirdness in any episode of his ""Theme Time Radio Hour"" than there is here.</p><p>
    It's hard, in some ways, to argue with an album that has a lot of these songs on it, and a few of the handful of tracks that haven't made it to a greatest-hits before are nice left-field choices-- the rusty lament ""Dark Eyes"", the zydeco goof ""On a Night Like This"", the post-vaudeville ramble ""Po' Boy"". The problem comes down to this: If you're more than faintly familiar with Dylan's stuff, you have no use for this collection. And if you aren't, and you're looking for a place to start, it will put you right off him. It's cold, dry and dusty-- a sarcophagus for an artist who deserves a bazaar instead.</p></div>"|10729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10729-dylan/|1.3|Douglas Wolk

So, to skirt the rumor mill, here are the particulars, as much or as little as they might apply: In 2005, Vernon's former band DeYarmond Edison moved from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to North Carolina. As the band developed and matured in its new home, the members' artistic interests diverged and eventually the group disbanded. While his bandmates formed Megafaun, Vernon-- who had worked with the Rosebuds and Ticonderoga-- returned to Wisconsin, where he sequestered himself in a remote cabin for four snowy months. During that time, he wrote and recorded most of the songs that would eventually become <i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i>.</p>
<p>As the second half of its title implies, the album is a ruminative collection of songs full of natural imagery and acoustic strums-- the sound of a man left alone with his memories and a guitar. Bon Iver will likely bear comparisons to Iron &amp; Wine for its quiet folk and hushed intimacy, but in fact, Vernon, adopting a falsetto that is worlds away from his work with DeYarmond Edison, sounds more like TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, not just in his vocal timbre, but in the way his voice grows grainier as it gets louder.</p>
<p>Vernon gives a soulful performance full of intuitive swells and fades, his phrasing and pronunciation making his voice as much a purely sonic instrument as his guitar. In the discursive coda of ""Creature Fear"" he whittles the song down to a single repeated syllable-- ""fa."" Rarely does folk-- indie or otherwise-- give so much over to ambience: Quivering guitar strings, mic'ed closely, lend opener ""Flume"" its eerily interiorized sound, which matches his unsettling similes. ""Lump Sum"" begins with a choir of Vernons echoing cavernously, which, along with that rhythmically rushing guitar, initiates the listener into the song's strange space.</p>
<p><i>For Emma</i> isn't a wholly ascetic project, though. A few songs benefit from additional recording and input after Vernon's initial sessions: Christy Smith of Raleigh's Nola adds flute and drums to ""Flume"", and Boston-based musicians John DeHaven and Randy Pingrey add horns to ""For Emma""; surprisingly, their company doesn't break the album's spell of isolation, but rather strengthens it, as if they're only his imaginary friends. Vernon turns the cabin's limitations into assets on ""The Wolves"", layering his falsetto, tweaking his vocal tones to simple yet devastating effect, and piling on clattering percussion to create a calamitous finale.</p>
<p>That passage contrasts nicely with the simple intro to the next track, ""Blindsided"", which builds from a single repeating note into a halting chorus melody that sells his skewed Walden imagery: ""I crouch like a crow/ Contrasting the snow/ For the agony, I'd rather know."" Vernon's lyrics are puzzle pieces that combine uneasily; his nouns tend to be concrete, yet the meanings slippery. On ""Flume"", the lines ""I am my mother's only one/ It's enough"" form a strong opener, but the song grows less and less lucid: ""Only love is all maroon/ Lapping lakes like leery loons/ Leaving rope burns-- reddish ruse."" It's as if he's trying to inhabit the in-between spaces separating musical expression and private rumination, exposing his regrets without relinquishing them. His emotional exorcism proves even more intense for being so tentative.</p></div>"|10709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/|8.1|Stephen M. Deusner

    Despite their long list of releases, Magik Markers have up to now been more compelling live than on record. Even on their best discs, the highs of their free-ranging noise-rock have come with meandering, sometimes off-putting lows. By contrast, the live act of guitarist and singer Elisa Ambrogio and drummer Pete Nolan is constantly fascinating. Their commanding stage presence steamrolls over musical gaps that, without the visceral visuals, might stick out awkwardly on record.</p><p>
    So it figures that, to make an album that holds attention the way their shows do, Magik Markers would have to channel their rambling spontaneity into more conventional tunes. What's so great about <em>BOSS </em>is that even though it is more structured and song-oriented than any previous effort, the band's fiery, scraggly approach remains intact. Paradoxically, by restricting their options (and, coincidentally, losing bassist Leah Quimby), the band has made its music even more open and free.</p><p>
    Such discipline has also made Magik Markers' sound more diverse. Their improv-based records sometimes got stuck in a narrow range of noises, but while BOSS may be a bona-fide rock album, there's lots of different stuff happening here: straight up rockers, punk rants, country-ish acoustics, and even an aching piano ballad.  And each has an energy and authority that matches the band's live show.
    </p>
<p>
    That said, <em>BOSS</em> isn't a complete split from the band's past. They have veered toward straight rock in the midst of some of their noise jams before, and many tracks here evoke the post-Sonic Youth clang of 2005's <em>I Trust My Guitar Etc.</em> But there's definitely something new going on, and most of it comes from the seductive voice and lyrics of Ambrogio. She's always been a deserving attention-getter, but here her talents seem wider and sharper. Her singing primarily evokes Patti Smith, as do her words, which deftly use rhyme to build intangible meaning. For example, on ""Taste"" she varies her choruses with tantalizing off-rhymes-- ""He had tasted her, tasted her/ Smiled right into the base of her/ He kept racing her, racing her/ And stayed alive; outpacing her""-- while her guitar and Nolan's simple drumming seem to rhyme in turn.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Taste"" may be <em>BOSS'</em>s most memorable track, but highlights abound. Opener ""Axis Mundi"" rises from initial guitar noise into a chugging swing, while ""Last of the Lemach Line"" sways hypnotically as Ambrogio intones with increasing desperation. Later, Nolan contributes primal piano chords to Amborgio's Cat Power-ish croon on ""Empty Bottles"", mixing nicely with the glockenspiel of producer Lee Ranaldo. Ranaldo also adds a layer of guitar fire to the manic ""Body Rot"", which sounds like a punked-out take on Rhys Chatham's minimal trance-rocker ""Drastic Classicism"".<em></em>
</p>

<em>BOSS</em> stumbles just slightly at its end. The noise essay ""Pat Garrett"" never really gathers steam, while closer ""Circle"" comes off as a thinner version of ""Lemach Line"". But sandwiched in between is the stellar ""Bad Dream/Hartford's Beat Suite"", a haunting tale of bloody pockets and severed thumbs that approaches the chill of a Johnny Cash tune. Such a comparison might be surprising, but then <em>BOSS</em> is bound to rearrange a lot of people's perceptions of this potent duo.

    Roberto Fonseca will not be coming to a city near you any time soon, at least if you're an American. In recent years, it's become very difficult for Cuban musicians-- even ones who've been to the U.S. before-- to promote their music here through touring. But while Fonseca himself can't make it into the country, the pianist and producer's fifth solo album has, and it's a startlingly fresh take on Afro-Cuban jazz that draws in elements from around the world and across many styles. At times, it sounds close to Quincy Jones' late 1960s work, classic soul-jazz, and even vintage German television soundtracks.</p><p>
    At the center off all the experimentation and genre-bending lies Fonseca's piano. His playing is impressive and versatile, ranging from aggressive tone clusters and driving left-hand grooves to lyrical, explorative soloing. The piano is richly recorded, with an emphasis on the lower octaves that feeds into the album's dark, dreamlike vibe. It's a feel rooted as much in pre-war recordings as it is in post-modern jazz-- there's just a slight patina of grit on the disc that makes it all the more arresting.</p><p>
    Wordless voices are a major part of the album's texture, and the way it's produced, they sometimes blend with Javier Zalba's clarinet to make a single, unique timbre. Some of the material was recorded in Brazil, and you can hear a bit of that country's influence-- the wordless vocals occasionally recall Sergio Mendes and some of the nation's great vocal groups, and some of the percussion has a Brazilian flavor. Like ""Clandestino"", which is equal parts McCoy Tyner, Quincy Jones, Peter Thomas, and Sergio Mendes, riding a dramatic left-hand piano theme as hand percussion snaps and sizzles in the background.
    </p>
<p>
    Other songs draw from even further afield. ""Congo Árabe"" has a light-speed rock beat and coalesces around a diving Middle Eastern sax theme that sounds closer to 70s European prog than Cuban jazz. And that's all before the flamenco guitar comes in. The title track rides a slow soul-jazz groove and some mind-blowing in-and-out-of-pocket drumming by Ramsés Rodriguez that complements the rock-solid piano ostinato at the song's heart. Then there's ""Ishmael"", which sounds like a spy movie theme, with its string section and funky Afro-Cuban rhythm, but takes a salsa-jazz detour in the middle with some brutal lower-octave pounding as Fonseca lays into his keyboard with open palms and fists.
    </p>
<p>
    Omara Portuondo's duet with Fonseca's wandering piano on ""Mil Congojas"" sounds about a hundred years old and drips with sadness, but it's the next track that most embodies the album's dichotomy between rhythmic movement and contemplation. ""Triste Alegría"" (""Sad Happiness"") morphs from a dour, rainy-day tango into a screaming, sun-poisoned mambo with fluid ease. If there's a criticism for <em>Zamazu</em>, it's that a few tracks are a bit nebulous, and on an hour-long album, a few of those go a long way toward disrupting momentum. But on the whole, <em>Zamazu</em> is an excellent and varied work of modern jazz that deserves to be heard.

    Can a band that names its debut album <em>Eulogies</em> be taken at face value? The group must be playing their self-reflexive card out of the gate, starting at the end and working their way backwards, or otherwise signaling the poetic finish of something large, with a fresh start to boot, right? Not necessarily, especially if the band itself is named Eulogies. Bandleader Peter Walker's songs draw inspiration from the literal meaning of the term, dealing variously with despair and regret, and were crafted during a 2006 tour on which he opened for Starsailor; to his credit, Walker plays his songs much closer to the vest than his former tourmates. <em>Eulogies</em> simmers with emotion and brims with understated hooks, registering nearest the sensible introspection of Wheat's <em>Hope and Adams</em>, Nada Surf's <em>The Weight is a Gift,</em> or Death Cab for Cutie's <em>Transatlanticism</em>.</p><p>
    Not so much clenched teeth as effectively restrained power-pop passion, <em>Eulogies</em>' most expressive moments-- the chugging chorus of ""Running in the Rain"", the opening guitar fanfare from ""Useless Amends"", the temporarily wanky solo from ""Life Boat""-- are quickly subsumed to calmer tones, most often in the form of shadowy electric guitar and Walker's whispery pleas. Matters are occasionally expanded, but at the lyrical level: ""Under the Knife"" elevates denial to universal proportions, questioning the impact of ""Those who died for us to live/ On false foundations,"" before reaching a fulfilling, yet discreet, refrain. ""Can't Relate"" overcomes the occasional overwrought lyric (""We're all swimming in the bottles of our own accord"") with one of the record's most effective productions, an organ-laced acoustic brood. Opener ""One Man"" has a muted, Ric Ocasek-style guitar line weaving throughout, and expands into a satisfying, but self-possessed chorus.</p><p>
    ""If I Knew You"" maps an apparent road to recovery, with Walker gently asking ""If I knew you, would you do the same to me?"", as if he's forced to simply start from interpersonal scratch and rebuild a ""friendship,"" beginning with the basics: ""Should I say goodbye again? Should I stick around?"" The gentle, wordless falsetto climax-- the album's early peak, and something Walker would be well served to further explore in the future-- doesn't give many clues as to the outcome, but that's okay. At times like those Walker is working through, it's often best to avoid language altogether. The one <em>Eulogies</em> song that doesn't work, ""Little Davie"", fails because Walker steps outside of the first-person perspective, breaking the one-to-one atmosphere he'd effectively created to that point.
    </p>
<p>
    The encomia Walker delivers here, per the above RIYLs, succeed for the most part because he sends them off to the great beyond with a brand of sentimentality that resists drifting into weepy nostalgia or keening over-emotion. For anyone who's recently seen the demise of a once-flourishing partnership (ahem), <em>Eulogies</em> can be instructive as well: measured, well-crafted recollections are much more presentable (and, for that matter, less embarrassing) than expressions of unadulterated feeling.</p><p>

In their early 1970s heyday, they recorded versions of pop, psychedelia, tape, and electronic music-- but really, they just played Faust music, alienating their record labels, each other, and generally being impossible to either classify or market.  By 1974, categorization threatened to ruin the reception of their fourth LP-- long considered their ""sell out"" record by die-hard fans due to an alleged concession to more palatable songs and mixes-- but as the concept of pretty/catchy noise isn't necessarily as wtf now as it would have been then, the record's rep has mostly recouped.  And I guess that's the lesson of Faust: Make the music you want to make, take the drugs you want to take, escape from the outside world when you can, and for god's sake, BE PRETTY/CATCHY/DISTURBING.</p>
<p><i> IV</i> was Faust's second release for Richard Branson's fledgling Virgin Records.  The band had recently been dropped by Polydor, and though Branson wasn't willing to pay them the huge advance sum manager/svengali/credit-taker Uwe Nettelbeck had nabbed from their previous label, he would let the band use Virgin's state-of-74 recording studios at the Manor in Oxfordshire to cut a new album.  Faust left Germany for England, played a few shows, and even managed to compile the super-classic <i>The Faust Tapes </i>for Virgin-- with which they promptly guerilla attacked the UK charts by selling it for half a pound-- all before starting work on what would become <i>IV</i>.  They even shared studio space with a young Mike Oldfield, whose <i>Tubular Bells</i> would soon help bankroll Virgin into Really Important Label status.</p>
<p>Of course, before the album was done, things got messy: Nettelbeck stepped in to compile the record from Faust's sessions at the Manor (and previous ones in Wümme, Germany) without consulting the band, in turn prompting founding members Hans-Joachim Irmler and Rudolf Sosna to quit. This then forced those who remained-- Jean-Herve Peron, Zappi Diermaier, and Gunter Wüstoff-- to recruit members of Slapp Happy and Guru Guru to fill out their touring band in order to promote <i>IV</i>.  By 1975, the band cut (or were relieved of) its ties with Branson and Virgin, reconvened to record a few tracks at Giorgio Moroder's Munich studios for an album that was never completed, and eventually, unceremoniously dissolved.  <span class=""postbody"">Not much was heard from the Faust camp before the band reunited (sans a couple of members) in 1990, and released <i>Rien</i> in 1994.</span></p>
<p>So, do you know Faust yet?  As an album, <i>IV</i> matches the band's trajectory: Jumbled, fragmented, with random data integrity issues, but seeming more the brainchild of inspired pop anarchists than calculating avant-gardists.  Yes, the record sounds more ""professional"" than any of their others, but somehow that doesn't actually equate to slick sounds: Opener ""Krautrock"" (which Irmler says was inspired by the band's perception of the British still fearing the ""krauts"") is on the noisiest end of Faust's spectrum, using distortion and feedback as springboards for tripping into galactic clouds.  For better than seven minutes, minute gradients of angelic, overdriven major-chord-sheets are exploited by who knows what devices before the drums come in and the track moves from milky, third-ear noise into MINDFUCKING KRAUTROCK.  And before you can explode from the sonic congestion, ""The Sad Skinhead"" starts, replete with ridiculous 60s go-go beat and skank guitar.  They sing, ""Apart from all the bad times you gave me, I always felt good with you,"" ""Going places, smashing faces-- what else could have happened to us?""  I say needlessly: it's a jam.  And then they keep going.</p>
<p>The gorgeous psych-ballad ""Jennifer"" provides a suitably jarring transition from the previous song, and is further proof that the band (Sosna in this case) were capable of writing actual ""songs,"" with melodies and chords that in some other, non-acid-baked circumstance, might already have been attached to a Volkswagen ad by now.  The pulsating bass drone, backed by eerily distant organ and guitar arpeggios, provides the perfect, glowing backdrop for lines like ""Jennifer, your red hair is burning,"" but this song is a good example of how dissecting individual Faustian innards often yields much less than the whole-- it's the sum shine that matters.</p>
<p>""Just a Second (Starts Like That!)"" begins as a relatively conventional guitar jam, but soon devolves into electro-noise that reminds me of some of the space-tropical music on Hosono &amp; Yokoo's <i>Cochin Moon</i>-- but the fractured nature of the piece is pure Faust.  They go one better on the next track.  Right down to the fucked-up tracklisting (which double-confusingly appends names of forthcoming tracks to the previous one), the medley of ""Giggy Smile"" and ""Picnic on a Frozen River"" may be the ultimate Faust moment, crossing strains of rock otherwise totally, transitionally opposed-- in this case, fake blues-rock and synthy surf-pop-- in the name of ""why the fuck not?""  And to no fan's surprise, it is also a magic song.</p>
<p>So is ""Läuft...Heißt Das Es Läuft Oder Es Kommt Bald...Läuft"".  Appearing later on the <i>71 Minutes</i> compilation as ""Psalter"", it fits in perfectly on IV: the first half of the song is based on a finger-picked acoustic guitar figure (playing what sounds like 6/4 + 7/4, or hey, maybe 13/4), but adds layers of drums, handclaps, flutes and what sounds like a bowed string (?) of some kind.  In any case, what sounds complicated actually comes out pretty lovely, and certainly the most hummable song in 13 that I know.  The song ends on a solemn, almost distractingly plain-faced organ postlude.  Even with distortion cranked up in the final minute, this is the kind of thing they should be playing in church to fool me into going.</p>
<p><i>IV</i> ends perfectly with Peron's ""It's A Bit of a Pain"".  This is essentially a strange take on pleasantly psychedelic, 70s So Cal country-rock, but its true awesomeness can only be appreciated by following the lyrical narrative:</p>
<p>It's a bit of a pain<br/> To be where I am.<br/> It's a bit of a pain<br/> To be where I am.<br/> But it's all ri-- BBBBBBZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ</p>
<p>This reissue includes a bonus disc of tracks from a 1973 Peel Session broadcast, as well as alternate versions of several songs and fragments.  Fans will know the Peel Session songs (the jazzy, sax-heavy ""The Lurcher"", a ""Krautrock"" remix and ""Do So"") from the <i>BBC Sessions+</i> CD, also contained in 2000's <i>Wümme Years</i> box set.  The spacey, ambient piano piece, titled appropriately ""Piano Piece"", later appeared on <i>71 Minutes</i> as ""Das Meer"".  Since both discs are available in the box, I'd advise anyone in love with <i>IV</i> and needing more Faust just to drop the required funds and own almost everything Faust released in their original incarnation.  Of course, <i>IV</i> isn't in that box, so if you don't need everything, but are curious, it's an easy starting point.  Pretty, catchy, slightly disturbing, magic.</p></div>"|10728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10728-iv/|9.4|Dominique Leone

    Bruce Springsteen occupies a unique place in American popular
    culture. He doesn't have the cachet that Bob Dylan has, yet he's much more
    approachable-- populist in practice, not just in theory. He has inspired pale imitators
    (Tom Petty, John Mellencamp), but has no peers to speak of. Unlike similar 1980s
    supercelebrities Prince or Madonna, he remains artistically viable and
    culturally relevant two decades after the height of his popularity. In the 1970s, he was never hip, but in the 2000s he has gained a considerable following
    among indie rock bands like the Hold Steady, the Killers, and the National, among
    many others. Because his music has lost none of its triumphant rock'n'roll
    kick-- no matter how many times you hear it, ""Born to Run"" always kills-- he
    has become today what Brian Wilson was 10 years ago: the indie ideal.</p><p>
    And yet, his popularity extends far beyond the indie realm.
    His mainstream audience remains fanatically loyal, making him one of the few
    artists that both you and your boss enjoy. Springsteen's success continues
    despite the constantly shifting ground that finds him on one side of certain
    cultural and political lines, then on another. His 2002 album <em>The Rising</em> was received as a post-9/11 salve,
    a paean to American resilience in the face of tragedy: The same people who died
    or lost loved ones in the attacks-- cops, firefighters, corporate grunts, their
    wives, husbands, families-- were said to be the very same people who inhabited
    Springsteen's earlier songs, now facing hard, cold reality. So it's forgivable
    if many heard the album they believed the country needed instead of the one
    Springsteen actually made.</p><p>
    Despite the nickname, the Boss has never inhabited his
    iconic status comfortably. <em>Devils &amp;
    Dust</em> followed <em>The Rising </em>in 2005<em>,</em> trading the E Street Band's full sound
    for acoustic contemplation and spinning a much grimmer version of America
    that was full of unrealized dreams and insoluble injustices. <em>We Shall Overcome,</em> his album of Pete Seeger
    covers and his best late-career album, proved much subtler in its subversiveness,
    communicating an anti-establishment stance through decades-old tunes. That's
    nothing new for him: The E Street Band's enormous, exuberant rock'n'roll has
    always hidden darker currents of American realism, most famously on ""Born in
    the U.S.A."", a
    song about disillusioned Vietnam
    vets that was hilariously co-opted by Ronald Reagan's 1984 presidential campaign as a theme song. 
    </p>
<p>
    That's the secret power of <em>Magic</em>, Springsteen's 15th album in 34 years: The album hides its raw
    disillusionment deep within the music, mingling it with a weary optimism and a
    thoroughly committed lustiness that have not diminished with age. The result is
    a surprisingly complex album that recalls <em>The
    River</em> in its heartfelt populism, <em>Darkness
    on the Edge</em> <em>of Town</em> in its
    small-town scope, and <em>Tunnel of Love</em>
    in its mature take on love and sex. On ""I'll Work for Your Love"", which could
    be a cover of an outtake from the first half of <em>The River</em>, he tells a woman he's ""counting the bones in your back
    like the stations of the cross""-- a concise fusion of the sexual and the
    spiritual. Where he once chronicled youthful abandon in the face of life's
    possibility, now his subject is
    the wonders of middle-aged contentment, as if he can't believe his own luck.
    It's a surprisingly durable subject, one that fits his outsize sound perfectly.
    </p>
<p>
    On the other hand, Springsteen's prickly angst makes songs like ""Last
    to Die"" and ""You'll Be Comin' Down"" sound like challenges to, rather than
    platitudes for, regular Joes. On second single ""Long Walk
    Home"", he considers the small(-town) satisfaction of having distinctive local
    landmarks and knowing everyone you pass on the street. That such pleasures are
    slowly dying makes the song both a romanticizing ode to an American ideal that
    may never have existed as well as a clear-headed lament that we no longer yearn
    for those securities. ""You know that flag flying over the courthouse means
    certain things are set in stone,"" he sings, ""who we are, what we'll do and what
    we won't.""
    </p>
<p>
    If <em>Magic</em> revisits
    the subject matter of previous career crests, it unfortunately recalls <em>The Rising</em> in its sound: Brendan O'Brien
    returns to the producer's seat, once again shuffling most of the E Street Band
    to the music's margins and focusing his attention squarely on the Boss. In
    addition to drenching slower songs like ""Your Own Worst Enemy"" and ""Devil's
    Arcade"" in melodramatic and totally unnecessary strings, the producer too often
    glosses over the creaks and wear in Springsteen's voice-- like air-brushing a
    model's face to look younger-- when it's the imperfections that give him his
    particular authority. Springsteen should sound more like Tom Waits, less like 3
    Doors Down. 
    </p>
<p>
    But then there are the songs that get everything exactly
    right, like the gorgeous ""Girls in Their Summer Clothes"" and ""Livin' in the
    Future"". On the latter, the E Street Band are given freer rein to revive and
    even update the boardwalk strut and namesake shuffle of their early days. Clarence
    Clemons' sax is integral to the modified doo-wop groove, drummer Max Weinberg swings
    easily, guitarists Steve Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren trade out licks, and Patti Scialfa's
    tender vocals echo Springsteen's excited performance. While he doesn't have the
    youthful eye for detail and narrative he once had, Springsteen's more concise
    songwriting style allows for some nice observations and surprisingly playful
    comparisons. ""Then just about sundown, you come walkin' through town,"" he sings
    on ""Livin' in the Future"", ""your boot heels clicking like the barrel of a
    pistol spinning 'round."" He-- and the E Street Band-- actually sound hungry
    and, yes, just a little pissed off. It's an angry song, with a rumbling
    undercurrent of dread (""Woke up Election Day, sky's gunpowder and shades of
    gray""), but damn if it doesn't sound awesome when you're speeding down a
    back road with the windows rolled down.

If you're in a club and you're dancing and the DJ drops a repetitive track in the middle of the set to maintain the momentum, should you bother worrying about whether or not there's a good hook in the melody and focus on how empty the composition seems to be, or do you just keep moving and accept that the groove is what matters and there's some other song that could fill that compositional dynamic later in the set? It's a conflict that's been separating straight-up club-bound music from the eclectic pop-crossover potential of groups like Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx for a long time now (to say nothing of, oh, Deee-Lite), and the tendency to play both sides is what made Felix Da Housecat's output earlier this decade both well-balanced and perilously close to falling on the wrong side of the equation-- whatever the wrong side would be.</p><p>
    If <em>Virgo Blaktro and the Movie Disco</em> says anything-- which, frustratingly enough, it really doesn't-- the message is that you can fall on the wrong side of pop and club simultaneously. <em>Virgo Blaktro</em> is, at least presumably, a record centered around a revival of the more melodic, song-crafting aspect of dance music, with a focus on black artistry present in the late 1970s and early 80s; Felix claimed in the Nettwerk PR material that he wanted to aim for Prince and P-Funk, with touches of what-if-they-were-black versions of George Michael and the Pet Shop Boys. It's an interesting M.O. that could've touched on some of club music's most persistent and intriguing cross-pollinations, especially given the now-familiar collision between American funk and European Italo/synthpop. Plus, it'd be a breath of fresh air to hear him working without the weight of his last two albums' ""electroclash"" trendiness informing his style. But when he examines the way these sounds play off each other, he does so superficially, and potentially interesting first-draft sketches are passed off as end products.</p><p>
    At the risk of dropping this album into the old ""this food tastes awful...and such small portions"" joke, the songs at the core of <em>Virgo Blaktro</em> suffer from being both repetitive and short, lacking both the verse-chorus-verse structure that makes 3-minute pop songs work and the gradual crests and transmutations that underpin the best 10-minute underground house cuts. Of the sixteen tracks, only two are longer than three and a half minutes, with an eight-track song-and-skit stretch in the middle where nothing goes further than 2:22. That stretch might have worked as a sort of mid-album mini-suite, but despite the tracks' general sonic consistency-- the delicately-autotuned ""It's Been a Long Time"", the icy minimalism of ""Monkey Cage"" (with a lyrical lift from Prince's ""America"") and the subtly euphoric ""I Seem 2B the 1"" all have a sleek, similarly-paced electro-funk energy to them-- it doesn't particularly cohere into a specific mood, transitioning from wistful to stressed to lovestruck without any thematic thread and leaving listeners with a scattershot grouping of songs that should've been given more time to transcend their fleeting, all-hook superficiality. There's probably worse crimes than writing tracks that just stop where other artists (or a younger Felix) would've really gotten warmed up, but the lost potential of songs like the outlandish two-part carnival funk/replicant soul diptych of ""I Saw the Future/Blaktroman"" and ""Mad Sista""-- combined, a mere 69 seconds-- is perplexing.</p><p>
    Still, there's a small handful of cuts in the three-minute-plus range that feel complete enough, and while the two attempted ""epic"" tracks near the end belie the album's skeletal notion of electro-soul-- ""Tweak"" sounds like the worst-case scenario results of Justice dismantling Amii Stewart's ""Knock on Wood"", and ""The Future Calls the Dawn"" turns his 1993 single ""Thee Dawn"" into grating pseudo-trance-- there's a few good nuggets here and there. ""Night Tripperz"" might be a flat-out knockoff of Moroder's <em>American Gigolo</em> composition ""Night Drive"", but it's also a lot prettier, trading Moroder's up-front bombast for warmer, more subdued synths and a hauntingly repeated vocal hook of ""night trippers, take me home."" ""Radio"" drains all the twee from the Buggles' solitary hit and replaces it with a multi-layered melodic vocal that switches between claustrophobia-inducing and calmly detached. And it's easy to forgive ""Like Something 4 Porno!"" its lighter transgressions (#1: the title; #2: the cliché ""sexy"" lyrics that title necessitates) just for being the big moment on the record where the funk completely takes over in the service of a genuinely catchy and well-developed dancefloor filler. A damn shame so much of the record's remainder feels like filler of a different kind.</p></div>"|10707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10707-virgo-blaktro-and-the-movie-disco/|5.4|Nate Patrin

    Since releasing two albums of skewed psychedelic pop in the early 1990s, the Mabuses have been keeping such a low profile that even their own Wikipedia and MySpace fan pages seem to have forgotten about them, their discontinued histories serving as quaint time capsules from an era when Dean Wareham and Kramer associations were the stuff of college-rock career-building. What exactly Mabuses main-man Kim Fahy has been doing in the 13 years since 1994's <em>Melbourne Method</em> is something of a mystery-- the press file on the band's labyrinthine website yields not a single dispatch from the past decade. Given Fahy's apparent fondness for Syd Barrett, it's tempting to imagine that, like his hero, he made a mythic retreat into chemically-induced seclusion. The more mundane theory is that, given the limited commercial market for Soft Boys-inspired indie pop, he probably just had to get a day job.</p><p>
    But for a band with such a modest, barely preserved history, <em>Mabused</em> is a grand, spare-no-expenses reintroduction to the world. You'd think Fahy had blown his entire recording budget on the album packaging alone, presenting us with a glossy, multi-paneled digipack and a lyric booklet concealed in a sleeve with cutout windows (á la Led Zeppelin's <em>Physical Graffiti</em>). What's more, the cover collage of WWI soldiers and 19th Century circus-poster iconography posit <em>Mabused</em> as Fahy's <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>-- and when compared to the more typical indie fare of The Mabsuses' early releases, it certainly is.</p><p>
    Fahy is still firmly hitched to a lineage that spans all the great pop eccentrics-- from Syd and Arthur Lee to Robyn Hitchock and Andy Partridge through to Bob Pollard and Shack's Michael Head-- but he's ditched the standard four-piece electric indie-rock formation of old. <em>Mabused</em> is both more acoustic and yet infinitely more elaborate, recorded as a seven-member open-door collective (Kramer included), with an auxiliary 12-piece ""Orlac Kestra Ensemble."" But all that extra ornamentation never overwhelms the songs with unnecessary orchestral dressing, instead coloring in the background of Fahy's folk frameworks like the soundtrack to a radio play.
    </p>
<p>
    Ace opener ""Dark Star"" sets the album's breezy tone: It's a strum-along head-nodder buoyed by a catchy chorus that withstands slide-guitar sweeps, chirpy woodwinds, and a subliminal old blues sample. Fahy's brand of psychedelia has little to do with standard genre signifiers like noise, distortion, drones, and trippy instrumental passages, instead savoring the strangeness of bygone traditions-- mariachi serenades (""Havana""), silent-movie scores (""Garden Devils"")-- and placing the emphasis on his engagingly droll storytelling. The Beatle-bouncing ""Seasider"" even makes sly references to his prolonged absence from music-making: ""I once thought I was funny, it's no secret I indulged/ I once ran out of money, it's no secret I evolved."" The cheeky folk-raga ""I'm the Greatest..."" takes the self-deprecation one step further, completing its title statement with the words ""coward on Earth."" But most telling line about the Mabuses' current condition arrives in the form of an Aldous Huxley namedrop on Beta Band-styled groover ""Feast""-- for a band that was dormant for 13 years, <em>Mabused</em> welcomes a brave new world.

    Bedroom pop goes meta with Drug Rug, a duo whose apocryphal first date took place on top of an actual bed in an actual, if unspecified, Boston, Mass., bedroom-- located perhaps a few blocks down Mass Ave from the Middle East, the Cambridge rock club where the two worked and first met in 2006. And if their love is a tenuous peg to hang an album on, tell that to fellow Cantabridgians Damon &amp; Naomi or Major Stars' Wayne &amp; Kate.</p><p>
    Since these two are each other's whole world-- and there are only two of 'em, after all-- it shouldn't be much of a shock that their debut splits some. That is to say, you've got your drunken, mostly Sarah Cronin-voiced caterwaulers: CocoRosie covering the Carter family, maybe; and then you've got your singing deep-into-your-bandmate's-eyes crooners, which are more lush and domestic and by process of elimination probably belong to Tommy Allen, Cronin's bandmate and boyfriend. Like a good couple, though, they double up on nearly every vocal, so who knows exactly.</p><p>
    More Moldy Peaches than Matt &amp; Kim, to keep up with this m/f duo thing, there's not a lot of celebration of love in song to <em>Drug Rug</em>. ""For The Rest of Your Life"" yips and yawls in the kind of underwater fidelity you'd get from a 78, which matches up pretty well with the duo's professed interest in Hank Williams and June Carter before she married Johnny. ""Lie, Lie, Lie"" clanks and jingles and croaks like a Joanna Newsom outtake if Newsom's harp was a quarter-size guitar and her voice was a bit more childlike; Cronin also spits the same sort of complicated fairytale narrative, which is incongruous, since by the next song, ""Cut the Meat"", the two of them are back out on the porch with their bare feet mashing the earth.
    </p>
<p>
    But if stretches of <em>Drug Rug</em> tremble and pose like a child playing dress-up, the record eventually gets assertive. ""Day I Die"" and ""Alright"" are chirpy, gliding Beatles-esque marching tunes that have the kind of joy to them you get the feeling DR would like to express in every song, not just a couple of them. And ""Tiny People"" is their curled-up gem and album finisher: ""You don't have to worry, you don't have to panic no more."" Take your own advice and you'll be fine.

    Industrial hums are not inherently dramatic or musical. There are numerous ways engender a sense of drama, most of them suggestive of intent or austere to the point of
    making the presence of ""art"" unmistakable. Musicians can lean on what's
    signified in their names (Labradford, Iannis Xenakis) or the imagery on their album
    covers (graphs, power lines, nothing), or they can set industrial hums within surroundings that amplify their abstract
    nature (atmospheres, beats, more industrial hums).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Another way to engender drama is to simply be Scott Walker.
    Since reestablishing himself with his 1995 comeback album <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Tilt</span><span>, Walker has maintained a formidable presence in art-music circles. If singing about Ingmar Bergman in the 1960s wasn't enough, everything Walker has done in his fertile later years has
    skewed as work that aspires to the heights of High Modernism. He's assayed
    atonal sounds. He's bedded down with formalism. He's invested his process with
    gestures, such as making a rhythm track for last year's </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Drift</span><span> by punching a big slab of meat found hung on a hook
    in a butcher shop.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Walker has banked lots of reasons to be taken seriously no
    matter the context, and that figures highly into hearing <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">And Who Shall Go to
    the Ball? And What Shall Go to the Ball?</span><span>, a
    score written to accompany a dance piece in England. It all starts
    with an industrial hum: an ominous, throbbing pulse that pushes the air out of
    a room when played loud. The fact that it was recorded by Walker ups the sense
    of foreboding already there, but the drama ticks up with sparse flickers of
    static and then a mad clash of what sounds like demonic klezmer-- a rush of
    reeds and expressive strings that fall apart as soon as they've struck a
    melody.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The score develops from there in a fashion similar to <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The
    Drift</span><span>, with a focus on classical music
    delivered and denuded in an avant-garde vein. Intricate strings drive the
    action throughout the course of four movements, but sections give way to the
    dramatic rumble of drums (the kind played with mallets by guys in tuxedoes) and
    surprising bursts of brightness in which Walker sounds attuned to old
    Alfred Hitchcock scores composed by Bernard Herrmann.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The most dramatic aspect of the piece, however, involves
    reconciling the fact that Walker doesn't sing a single note from start to
    finish. If the absence of a voice when you're expecting it can play games with
    the mind, then the absence of Scott Walker's--
    a tremendous, trembling voice that sounds deep, eerie, gorgeous, and terrifying
    all at once-- arouses a special kind of dramatic tension. For its voicelessness alone (as
    well as its short 25-minute running time), <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">And Who Shall… </span><span>can't be classed as a Walker album proper. But it
    goes a long way toward revealing the strengths of an artist who has established
    himself as a serious composer as well as a monumental presence-- even when he's
    not there to be heard.<span></span><span></span></span>

Nellie McKay-- for all intents and purposes, a poster-child for the Old Masters of Song-- writes tunes that take advantage of any number of patterns and modulations used by her musical forefathers (Gershwin, Rodgers &amp; Hart, Weill, Leiber &amp; Stoller), yet manage to seem a little off-the-cuff.  Part of this is down to her performances, but many of the songs themselves have an aspect of ""I wrote this in 20 minutes, and I can do it again,"" while still being structurally sound, rarely betraying any musical corner-cutting.</p><p>
    On her third record, <em>Obligatory Villagers</em>, McKay's craft is in full splendor.  The credits read, ""all songs written, arranged &amp; orchestrated by Nellie McKay,"" and listening to the Technicolor, show-stopping ensemble figures in ""Oversure"", or the big Broadway rock of ""Testify"", it's very easy to marvel at the assured hand of the composer/arranger.  Indeed, <em>OV</em> is McKay's best sounding disc yet, which is especially good news after occasionally flat production on both her debut and last year's mildly underrated (but still overstuffed) <em>Pretty Little Head</em>.</p><p>
    Still, sheer craft and arranging chops can't always save her songs.  I've listened to ""Zombie"" a dozen times, and I'm still not really sure what it's about.  Best I can figure, McKay's protagonist (herself?  It's possible the ""I"" in her songs takes a page out of fellow classic popateer Randy Newman's songbook, and doesn't ever actually refer to the singer) travels down South, possibly encounters a curse in a swamp, and is urged to ""do the Zombie."" (Other Pitchfork staffers insist it's <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/44628-nellie-mckay-zombie-stream""><strong>a political song about our sleepwalking through the GWB years</strong></a>.)  The light blues feel doesn't really help the song's cause, except to emphasize its showtune-without-a-show feel.  ""Testify"" stuffs a whole show's worth of arranging into one song, going through brassy fanfare, double-lite rock-opera (uncomfortably similar to what Bill Conti might come up with to introduce Oscar presenters), faux gospel-- and though McKay's melodies are fool-proof, the familiar feeling that I'm hearing someone's private musical revue without the benefit of knowing any of the back story, or having any particular emotional nagging to investigate just why the protagonist is urging us to ""testify, raise your hands up to the sky.""   </p><p>
    My favorite stuff is on songs like the opener ""Mother of Pearl"", where McKay again recalls Newman by employing straight-faced irony and vague sarcasm to illustrate the absurdity of her subjects-- in this case, feminists (""feminists don't have a sense of humor… they have a tumor on their funny bone"").  Sure, there's a tap-dance break in the middle, and the band's ""funny"" responses to her lines are hit and miss, but it's the still kind of song that makes it impossible for me to not at least be curious about how she develops as a songwriter.  Likewise, ""Oversure"" is both the crown of McKay's arrangements, and the most musically interesting moment on <em>Obligatory Villagers</em>, speeding through be-bop changes, syncopated, stop/start rhythms, and even the first of several cameos by infamous songwriter/singer Bob Dorough.  And even though the song could be heard as yet another song missing a musical, the visceral ride through all of its many detailed sections thrills my, er, muso bone. </p><p>
    Of course, McKay starred on Broadway last year, playing Polly Peachum in a limited run of Weill/Brecht's classic <em>Threepenny Opera</em>.  Given the theatrical nature of many of the songs on <em>OV</em>, it's not a stretch to forecast she'll be penning her own musicals in the not-too-distant future; as her senses of melody and harmonic movement (and perhaps most importantly, humor) seem more pronounced, more assured with each record, I really do look forward to hearing her try.  I guess I just hope the content of her songs follows suit.</p></div>"|10735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10735-obligatory-villagers/|6.9|Dominique Leone

For nearly two decades, O'Hagan has been busily hollowing out a nook that's all his, both with his own High Llamas and as an adjunct contributor to Stereolab. You could call his work a pastiche of retro sounds-- Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, Tin Pan Alley, bossa nova, 1950s exotica, 60s soundtracks. Then again, anyone familiar with his signature twinkle-and-bounce can spot one of his arrangements within three chords, unless you trick them with the theme from ""The Odd Couple"" TV series. And for a good while, those arrangements provided exactly what a lot of 90s listeners seemed to look for: the creation, on CD, of other little worlds, sunnier or trippier or just quainter than our own.</p><p>
    Listeners in the new millennium seem to like things a lot less escapist-- music that's social and fiery and engaged-- and it's only this year that the High Llamas have gotten some praise for breaking a few steps off the old O'Hagan script. When it comes to film soundtracks, though, creating hermetic little worlds is precisely the idea, and it's incredibly wise for director Marc Fittousi to have tapped O'Hagan and Stereolab partner Tim Gane to score a comedy like <em>La Vie d'Artiste</em>. Clever indie folks may hear these strings lilt and think <em>more O'Hagan</em>-- and this is surely O'Hagan's world, more than Gane's. All those who step into this film fresh, on the other hand, will leave with this sound printed in their brains as the world of this film and this film alone-- never mind that this music could have done an awfully similar job for <em>Amelie </em>or <em>The Science of Sleep</em>.</p><p>
    And they'll appreciate it, one imagines: these two discs of short cues work pretty well as a sort of Pocket O'Hagan. The brevity of the cues lets him do what he does best, setting up some new reconfiguration of quaint, light 60s bounce, shooting it through with string colorations and soft horns and harpsichord melodies, and then brushing onward before your brain objects that it gets the picture. Their range also lets him pull in directions he otherwise might not: shades of John Barry's James Bond music in dangerous moments, or doo-wop idylls that could be Françoise Hardy backing tracks.</p><p>
    The value of a soundtrack, though, is different from the value of the actual discs you might take home, and some logistical problems weigh this stuff down pretty heavily. The cues are short, which forestalls any kind of steady, close attention to this stuff; they also circle around melodic themes, something that's grand when you're watching a film, but can make home listeners feel like they left the disc on repeat. It's also an open question how many O'Hagan devotees need the bite-size sampler or the pocket edition; High Llamas records probably aren't as good for walking around pretending you're in a charming French comedy, but they also won't give you two-minute mood shifts on the subway. It might be best to leave this one to the people it's for: the lovers of this film who'll get to carry a signature sound around as a reminder of it.<br/></p></div>"|10714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10714-la-vie-dartiste-ost/|5.4|Nitsuh Abebe

    I don't remember American indie rock ever sounding as big as it does right now. Maybe it's the democratization of professional recording methods through technological advancement, but from the Arcade Fire, Interpol, and the Walkmen to Band of Horses and Okkervil River, everything sounds gigantic, on the brink of anthemhood regardless of subject matter. It could also be a matter of bands trying to stand out from an ever-thickening mass of groups, and what better way to do that than to make music that wields a bigger, clearer hook than the competition?</p><p>
    Whatever the reasons, count Office as another small-budget band with a big-budget sound. The Chicago quintet is more interesting than its boring, un-Googlable name would suggest, applying 21st century indie rock grandiosity to late-1970s pop moves. I hear shades of ELO, the Bee Gees, and even Queen here, with hints of early XTC and the Posies. There are lots of close backing harmonies (with female band members filling in for what might have been male falsettos on their influences' records) and the production has a neon feel-- bright and colorful with a bit of a buzz.</p><p>
    In fact, the biggest criticism of the record is that the switch is always all the way on, and it gets to be a little much over the course of a whole album. When they finally do try something different, on closer ""Suburban Perfume"", it's something of a relief, because we finally get to hear a side of the band that isn't full-throttle rhythm and actually indulges in some introspection. Main songwriter Scott Masson performs the song mostly on acoustic guitar, with an excellent assist from keyboardist Jessica Gonyea, who complements the song's wistful, nostalgic tone and lyrics with a sort of grab-bag of late-60s/early-70s textures.
    </p>
<p>
    But while one of the best songs sounds very little like the rest of it, there are several tracks in the band's bread-and-butter style that are just as good. ""If You Don't Know By Now"" has a massive, instantly memorable chorus and a lead verse vocal that dances in a nimble sing-speak across drummer Erica Corniel's rhythm, which is reminiscent of ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"". Tom Smith even gets in a quick, snappy guitar solo. ""Company Calls"" (no resemblance to the Death Cab song) has an even hookier chorus, with a rapid-fire call-and-response, and verses are well arranged, with a bass part that cuts in and out and double-stop dynamic shifts that keep the listener guessing.
    </p>
<p>
    That kick-snare-kick-snare ""Mr. Blue Sky"" beat crops up on several songs, including ""Paralyzed Prince"", which is pretty good apart from an awkward spoken bit in the middle. The band's stab at hard rock, ""Had a Visit"", is brief but satisfying, and ""The Ritz"" finds them at their most glammed-out. A few songs don't quite measure up to their ambitions-- ""Q&amp;A"" is both the least memorable of the bunch and the longest, while ""Wound Up"" just doesn't grab the way many of its counterparts do.
    </p>
<p>
    Office is a band, though, that can weirdly get away with a filler track here and there, because they still sound reasonably powerful even at their lowest points, and Masson kicks out plenty of lyrical nuggets like, ""I'm carving a pumpkin/ In your resemblance/ With a dull knife/ Leaving jagged edges,"" to snap your attention back his way. In the end, it's an album that's dominated by its high points but still mostly satisfying.

    There are worse ways to kick off a debut album. Atop an orchestra of plucked strings and backed by a complementary chorus of Reasons, Clare Muldaur's knee-buckling voice sings a bittersweet but ultimately uplifting song about the now-dwarf planet Pluto. ""Cheer up, Pluto,"" she croons, ""the stars still love you, and we down here do, too."" Coupling this sort of charm with Muldaur's gorgeous voice, equally gorgeous orchestration, and a nice list of contributors (including Beach Boy abettor Van Dyke Parks, internationally-renowned harmonicist Gregoire Maret, and obscure indie troubadour Sufjan Stevens) would lead one to believe that <em>The Movie</em> is a stem-to-stern pleasure. Ultimately, however, the seemingly sumptuous stew one would hope to concoct from these ingredients ends up as a dish that leaves something to be desired.</p><p>
    The most glaring shortcoming of this otherwise enjoyable record is the inadvertent slap-fights that break out between Muldaur's rich yet delicate voice and the album's ornate arrangements. If the track's trappings are modest-- such as the piano and bass configuration that Parks uses for ""Love Can Be a Crime"", or the gentle restraint exhibited on ""Sugar in My Hair""-- Muldaur shines through without a struggle. More often than not, though, she has to fight her way through heart-tugging string sections and a Spartan phalanx of back-up singers and any number of musical accoutrements to get herself heard. If there's any clever wordsmithery to be had in ""Cook For You"" beyond the opening couplet (""I like to cook for you in my underwear/ 'Cause our kitchen points to a wall""), it's smothered by a bathetic cadre of violins. ""Science Fiction Man"" starts off strongly on the less-is-more tip, with just a few plucks and a running harpsichord behind Muldaur, but ends up going for the throat in an overly dramatic fashion just as the song nears its end.</p><p>
    There's also a bit of shtickiness to overcome. While the album's leadoff track is gorgeous, it also wears out its welcome after a few listens. The album closes with a re-envisioning of ""Pluto"" en français-- the jovial plucking of the original is replaced with dreamy piano twinkling and a musical saw-like moan, and singing the lyrics in a foreign language goes a long way towards making the titular concern hold up longer. Stevens' nondescript appearance comes on <em>The Movie</em>'s second track, a clumsy medley titled ""Nothing/Nowhere""-- the former's 90 seconds sounds like a missing movement from a 1940s Disney soundtrack, while the latter apes the same stuff that Beatles-era McCartney would when in a show tune mood. In contrast, Maret's contributions to the album (some Stevie Wonder-esque toots on ""Rodi"") stick out awkwardly. And, as mentioned previously, when the strings try to up the emotional ante, the end result comes off more schmaltzy than sincere. It's a shame, too-- there are plenty of moments and songs on <em>The Movie</em> that have me wishing the rest of the album was as strong as its high points.

    Between Sunset Rubdown, Wolf Parade, Frog Eyes, and Swan Lake, Spencer Krug might be the most prolific indie rocker this side of Bob Pollard. The Montreal-based musician may still be best known for Wolf Parade, but while that band's flash-and-bang masks some surprisingly subtle songwriting, Sunset Rubdown's music quietly creeps under your skin. Despite the unifying thread of Krug's cracked, emphatic voice, Wolf Parade's bombast and Sunset Rubdown's nuance make them very different bands.</p><p>
    There are precedents for the elegant, cobwebby <em>Random Spirit Lover</em>: Frog Eyes' dark, dramatic vocals and abstruse lyrics, Xiu Xiu's creepy instrumentation, and Modest Mouse's off-kilter guitar rock. But these predecessors are, at best, just a frame-- it's Krug's exquisite attention to detail that makes this such a striking album. <em>Random Spirit Lover</em>'s songs have verses, choruses, and bridges like most other pop/rock songs, but they're so architecturally complex and harmoniously joined that the boundaries between them become erased. In a song-driven era, Sunset Rubdown is making a strong case for the album.</p><p>
    Krug stitches his suites together so adeptly that it's difficult to tell where one ends and the next begins, and yet, each song still retains its own unique character-- a testimony to the album's careful crafting. The ascending plateaus of ""Magic Vs. Midas"" are shaggy and dim; ""The Courtesan Has Sung"" is a taut and martial; ""Winged/Wicked Things"" has a paradoxically bruising delicacy; ""Colt Stands Up, Grows Horns"" juxtaposes an atmospheric expanse with an inward-looking finale.  
    </p>
<p>
    But while <em>Random Spirit Lover</em> is dense and thorny-- even opaque, at times-- it's never haphazard. Its sonics are robustly melodic with layers of depth that emerge over time. ""The Mending of the Gown"" builds block by block, each amplifying the impact of its undulating melody. ""For the Pier (and Dead Shimmering)"" establishes a celestial uplift with harpsichord and synth tones, then collapses into a rock anthem. ""The Taming of the Hands that Came Back to Life"" features singing guitar leads, dewy glockenspiels, and squelchy synths in its sprightly stutter-step. 
    </p>
<p>
    Throughout all this instrumental pageantry, Krug's vocal presence is strong, both as a stylist and a lyricist. There's more than a whiff of obscure mysticism and archaic vocabulary in his lyrics, which might turn off more literal listeners. But Krug has a knack for couching his baffling imagery in compelling, repetitive syntax that shapes a narrative from his procession of characters-- courtesans, jackals, virgins, and stallions. 
    </p>
<p>
    Insofar as I can boil down Sunset Rubdown to a single moment, it's one near the end of ""Up on Your Leopard, Upon the End of Your Feral Days"". The song's maniacal carnival music, which until this point has rocketed through a rollercoaster's worth of peaks and valleys, settles into barren dirge where Krug's lyrics come clear. ""Because you're the one who's riding around on a leopard,"" he sings with his usual creaky splendor. ""You're the one who's throwing dead birds in the air."" This moment doesn't compartmentalize Sunset Rubdown; it traces out the broadest contours of their allure: The striking image that sticks in the mind, unfathomable but heavy with meaning, for days; the carefully contrasted song structure, and the sense that this is a band uncompromising in its vision, making music with more depth and longevity than its stubborn relegation to ""side project"" merits.

For about $15, you can purchase the one-disc ""Original Masters"" version released this May by Universal/Hip-O.  For about $20, you can purchase Rhino's 2001 reissue, which features the original album on one disc plus a bonus disc of assorted demos, live tracks, and outtakes.  And now, for about $30, you can purchase Universal/Hip-O's 2xCD ""deluxe"" version, which packs the original album, outtakes and Costello's solo demos on the first disc, and an entire 1977 live show from the Nashville Rooms (complete with soundcheck) on its second.</p><p>
    In a sense, it's an interesting model of consumer choice, or at least it could be: three incrementally priced versions of an album, geared towards three different levels of interest.  But this new reissue not only falls short of being the final, definitive word on the album-- it falls short of the Rhino reissue as well.  The bonus material on the 2001 reissue seemed more carefully curated, giving a complete picture of Costello's work at the time and making for a compelling listen throughout.  The gestures towards completism on this reissue are appreciated, but much of the bonus material fails to be of more than just passing interest.</p><p>
    A good deal of the first disc's better bonus material has appeared on previous reissues.  Outtakes ""Stranger in the House"" and ""Radio Sweetheart"" heighten the country-tinged tone of the record, and are on par with some of its weaker tracks.  The Pathway Studio demos, most of which are previously unreleased, sound like what they are: high-quality demos recorded in anticipation of making a record.  Four of these unreleased tracks didn't make it onto the record, and all are serviceable, if not spectacular.  But a lot of the better tracks from the Rhino reissue are noticeably absent here, including a cover of the Burt Bacharach/ Hal David standard ""I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself"".  While this reissue offers an interesting glimse into Costello's creative work immediately before and after the release of <em>My Aim Is True</em>, it lacks the reverent and enthusiastically geeky perspective of the Rhino reissue.</p><p>
    The live disc provides a fascinating window into how backing band the Attractions changed the course of Costello's work.  You can hear Steve Nieve's keyboard begin to take prominence over Costello's guitar work, but the band has yet to account for these changes in their arrangements.  You can also hear drummer Pete Thomas holding back and falling a bit behind, perhaps trying to emulate the more loose and laid back tone of My Aim Is True.  The songs culled from the record sound awkward and uncertain, and an embryonic version of ""I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea"" is listless and sluggish.  At this stage, the band sounds like a pale imitation of the incredibly forceful unit heard on the vastly superior Live at El Mocambo, which was released in a box set with Rykodisc's even earlier reissues, and excerpted on the Rhino reissue.  </p><p>
    Of course, the album itself is still fantastic.  Songs like ""Alison"", ""(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes"", ""Less Than Zero"", and ""Watching the Detectives"" are among Costello's best, and constitute a vital chapter in the lexicon of punk and new wave.  <em>My Aim Is True</em> sounds just as relevant now as it did four months ago, seven years ago, and 15 years ago (when Rykodisc's expanded reissue was first released on CD).  Does this reissue do anything to provide a new context for the album?  Not really.  Whereas the Rhino reissue featured some truly fascinating liner notes from Costello himself, this reissue-- though impeccably packaged-- includes no illuminating liners, old or new.  It does, however, include an ad for Elvis Costello ringtones, obnoxiously dating this release and calling into question its motives.  Still, this is hardly a case of exploitation or instant obsolescence.  None of the bonus material here is bad, and much of it will be of interest to Costello completists.  If you have thirty dollars to spare on a batch of demo recordings and an interesting live show, there are worse ways to spend your money.  If not, the Rhino reissue makes a much better case for this classic and essential album.<br/></p></div>"|10712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10712-my-aim-is-true-deluxe-edition/|7.0|Matt LeMay

It's his first record on Drag City, but more importantly, it's his widest-ranging one yet, a joyful trip through his many styles, influences, and obsessions. Most of Bishop's previous albums have had a stricter range, be it the improvised acoustics of <em>Improvika</em>, the electronic atmospheres of <em>Elektronika Demonika</em>, or the long-form experiments of <em>While My Guitar Gently Bleeds</em>, released earlier this year.</p><p>
    But <em>Fragments</em> is a spectacular showcase of Bishop's multi-dimensional talents. Here we get fast-picked folk, Django Reinhardt-worthy gypsy tunes, Chet Atkins-style ditties, Hindi-influenced melodies, and a lode of other, less classifiable stuff. Interestingly, this catholic approach is closest in tone to Bishop's actual solo debut, 1998's <em>Salvador Kali</em>, which also freely rolled his polygonal sonic dice. But even compared to that stellar release, <em>Fragments</em> is remarkably kaleidoscopic.</p><p>
    It's also Bishop's most ear-catching work so far. His playing is still open and exploratory, but nearly every track is also hummable. Opener ""Cross My Palm With Silver"" begins with typical Reinhardt-ish sketches, but halfway in coalesces into a sneaky rolling hook. ""Elysium Number Five"" matches that with a snake-like lead line, and ""Free Masonic Guitar"", made almost solely of ringing strums, builds melody from sheer momentum. Bishop has always been a stunning player, picking through blinding runs in a flash. But here his ability to think fast and play even faster is employed solely in service of songcraft. The album's centerpiece, the ten-minute piano meditation ""Saraswati"", might seem like an exception to <em>Fragments'</em> melodicism, with its searching tones and chilly drone. But as writer Grayson Currin recently pointed out, listen closely and the track seems to nick the melody from the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", stretching it into revelatory slow motion.</p><p>
    One would imagine that ""Saraswati"" would be too daunting an achievement to follow, but in fact, <em>Polytheistic Fragments</em>' three final tracks <em></em> are the album's best. ""Tennessee Porch Swing"" is an unabashed country-road stroll, while ""Canned Goods &amp; Firearms"" channels the bounce of Chet Atkins. And ""Ecstasies in the Open Air"" is the record's ultimate charmer, a denouement whose halting acoustics melt perfectly into a soaring flute line.  It's probably the softest, dreamiest thing you'll ever hear Bishop play, but like the rest of <em>Polytheistic Fragments</em>, its gentle bliss fits perfectly inside this sound-painter's rainbow palette.</p></div>"|10701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10701-polytheistic-fragments/|8.2|Marc Masters

    It's the end of the world as we know it, and Vic Chesnutt feels just fine. ""Warm"" rouses his 11th album, <em>North Star Deserter</em>, with intimations of Armageddon, as the Georgian vents a nagging question over an isolated acoustic guitar: ""Do they say that the end it is a'coming soon?"" He can't decide if it's the rapture or the apocalypse, but he's not worried: ""Anyway A or B, it's alright with me."" This is the resignation of the powerless, and Chesnutt's act of removing himself from polite company-- note the military implications of that album title-- is not only a curmudgeonly comment on the terrors of our times, but also perhaps the only sane response. This is reassuring: his past few albums have traded bristling eccentricities for something closer to a cozy agreeableness, threatening to commit him to the Americana old folks home: The cosmopolitan <em>Silver Lake</em> in 2003 was his friendliest album to date, a sales grab to match all his critical accolades; two years later, <em>Ghetto Bells</em>, with Van Dyke Parks and Bill Frisell, retreated into weirdness, but the songs were overlong and largely impenetrable.</p><p>
    The more succinct songs on <em>North Star Deserter</em> sound like a return to the dark woods after years in the city. From this hermit position-- ""my soul in its special hell,"" he describes it-- Chesnutt can read <em>The Palm at the End of the Mind</em>, watch everything fall apart, and record it in song after song after song. ""The barn fell down since I saw it last,"" he sings on ""Everything I Say"", ""it's rubble now, well so much for the past."" Such wry understatements hold legions of ideas and interpretations, and his grim humor balances his dread. ""You Are Never Alone"", with its shuffling lounge beat, is his funniest song in a while: ""It's OK, you can use a condom/ It's OK, you can take a Valtrex/ And it's OK, you can get an abortion/ And then keep on keepin' on.""</p><p>
    As Chesnutt's self-reckoning continues, so do his turnstile collaborations. The crew on <em>North Star Deserter</em> includes Fugazi's Guy Picciotto, former Arcade Fireman Howard Bilerman, and all of the Godspeed You Black Mt. Zion! Tra-La-La Emperorchestra (or whatever they're calling themselves these days). Whether on a decorously loud song like ""Debriefing"" or a quieter song like ""Wallace Stevens"", their versatility allows Chesnutt to sound spooked and spooky, Southern and gothic without resorting to ""Southern gothic."" The quiet, contemplative verses of ""Everything I Say"" erupt into loud, scouring choruses that sound like white noise and black thoughts. ""Splendid"" reverses that pattern, beginning with an electric fanfare that gives way to a curious acoustic theme that gives way to a bizarre equine pastoral.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Debriefing"" makes the topicality of apocalypse a little too obvious, with a collage of newsroom and press conference noises that sound like Simon &amp; Garfunkel are about to sing ""Silent Night"". Still, it allows the many musicians full rein-- for eight damn minutes! It's by far the noisiest, ballsiest, blusteriest thing Chesnutt has done, and whether or not it ""works"" becomes moot when the brimstone drums kick in around the six-minute mark, brutal like war footage.
    </p>
<p>
    But Chesnutt's voice remains the most curious instrument on <em>North Star Deserter</em>: His creaky vocals and peculiar pronunciation (which can locate unknown syllables in common words) may have diminished slightly since his first few Texas Hotel albums, but he sounds ornery as ever on <em>North Star Deserter</em>. On ""Glossolalia"" he spits sharply alliterative b's and d's, matching them to the percussively plucked strings as if warning you to back off. And yet he draws you in: On ""Splendid"", he sings, ""We came across an incomplete set of..."" He pauses ominously to make you lean forward and listen for the next words. That sense of mystery has served Chesnutt well over the course of a bumpy seventeen-year career. ""Can't say I didn't rattle the load,"" he sings on closer ""Rattle"", ""but I'm keeping it on the road.""

    Warp Records made its name in IDM, and when the books are closed, it's for IDM the label will be remembered. But to their credit, the Sheffield label has gradually expanded well beyond its original purview. These days Warp is arguably less renowned for the mysterious (and suspiciously MIA) likes of Aphex Twin, Autechre, and Boards of Canada than it is for rock acts such as Battles, Grizzly Bear, and !!!. Granted, these acts are only nominally rock acts. They're too uncategorizable to be comfortably placed in any one box, and that's no doubt part of what caught Warp's attention in the first place.</p><p>
    Even so, Gravenhurst, another recent Warp gamble on (for them) a non-traditional act, was perhaps more of a risk than the others. Early on, leader Nick Talbot adhered closely to established gloomy folk templates, but just like his label home, the scope of his music has grown greatly. By <em>Fires in Distant Buildings</em> Gravenhurst had embraced-- or at least gravitated toward-- the psychedelic noise rock of one of Talbot's stated influences, Flying Saucer Attack, finding room between the finger-picking for Krautrock experiments and epic feedback explorations.</p><p>
<em>The Western Lands</em> continues in this mode, blurring the borders between folk and noise, and the result is probably Talbot's most focused to date. It's still pretty unpredictable, though. ""Saints"" starts the disc as a ghostly meditation, a spooky yet stately mood piece that never builds up to an expected cathartic explosion. Yet the next track, ""She Dances"", comes off like latter period Fugazi had somebody spiked their club sodas, all sinewy menace, a tightly-wound mix of guitars, piano, and quietly driving drums, albeit featuring Talbot's just-north-of-a-whisper vocals.
    </p>
<p>
    It's an important transition into the shoegaze squall of ""Hollow Men"", a straight rocker reminiscent of prime Ride, but just as you're surfing the crest of Talbot's wave of noise he downshifts into ""Song Among the Pine"", a subdued folk song. ""Trust"" splits the difference, striking a fine middle ground that will bring a smile to fans of the late, great Bedhead. With the title track we're back to more standard indie-rock fare, though ""Farewell, Farewell"" strums up an intriguing match of concise pop melody and out of control guitar swells.
    </p>
<p>
    Talbot's ability to switch between these various extremes without making any of the switches seem extreme is a neat trick. He's just as at ease with the pretty ""Hourglass"" or the poppy ""The Collector"" as he is with the stretched out introspective trip ""Grand Union Canal"". It's what gives the disc its psychedelic edge, but it's also what keeps it from falling into a pattern of pastiche and retro replication.
    </p>
<p>
    Sounding straight out of the 1960s would have been the easy route. That Talbot's songs sound very much of the present no matter what era he draws from, only minus the careerist compromises he could clearly make to widen his fan base, constitutes a large part of Gravenhurst's appeal. Even at its prettiest and most accessible, <em>The Western Lands</em> is still a very insular, sometimes uncomfortably intimate album, and listening to it is akin to sharing a tiny but comfortable space in Talbot's closed little cocoon.

    They say the true measure of a great song is whether it still sounds as
    good when you strip the accompaniment down to a solo acoustic guitar.
    They, of course, are full of shit. This year alone, a bunch of my
    favorite songs-- Chromatics' ""In the City"", let alone Lil Mama's ""Lip
    Gloss""-- have been more about texture and rhythm than melody. José González might
    still be best known for his unplugged cover of the Knife's ""Heartbeats"",
    but with this Swedish singer-songwriter, lack of adornment means
    something different than just showing a song's bones.</p><p>
    In fact, for González's follow-up to debut album <em>Veneer</em>,
    I hesitate to use the term ""singer-songwriter"" at all. It used to
    bother me that the Gothenburg-based artist hadn't written any originals as compelling as his covers, which so far have included not just
    ""Heartbeats"" but also Kylie Minogue's ""Hand on Your Heart"" and Joy
    Division's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". I'm so over it now. While
    sophomore full-length <em>In Our Nature</em> still only rarely nears the
    songwriting brilliance of González's fantastic cover selections (an unfair standard!), that's clearly not the game he's playing best.</p><p>
    On <em>In Our Nature</em>,
    González takes the basic elements of an acoustic troubadour's craft and
    explores their possibilities, not only as ingredients of songs, but as
    sounds to be enjoyed in their own right. A stray breath, the buzzing of
    guitar strings, a hand scraping across the frets: these are all shades
    in González's palette. The biggest embellishment you're likely to hear is a metronomic foot-tap, subtle hand percussion, or a backing vocal by Little Dragon's Yukimi
    Nagamo. Where the Knife's ""haunted house"" sound is informed by minimal techno, González's lo-fi acoustic guitar music could be dubbed
    ""minimal folk.""
    </p>
<p>
    Or ""minimal folk-pop,"" if you prefer. Like British folkie John Martyn on 1973's <em>Solid Air</em>,
    González has a reassuringly airy voice and the intricate finger-picking
    of a leftfield jazz aficionado. Plus, there are plenty of hooks in his
    spare melodies and still sparer lyrics. Whether a political statement,
    a musing on sin, or a stark depiction of a troubled relationship, first
    video selection ""<a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/forkcast/44788-jos-gonzlez-down-the-line""><strong>Down the Line</strong></a>""
    is entrancing beyond its slightly distorted strums, droning treble
    strings, or clicking percussion. ""It's all about compromising,""
    González sighs into what he calls ""the darkness."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The
    fire and brimstone from classic American folk (and its folk-rock
    inheritors) is often detectable behind González textures. For all its sleepy
    off-mic mumbling and uncluttered finger-picking, ""Abram"" reads as a
    shot against religion: ""Even though you mean well (well, most of the time)/ You made a delusion and created lies in our
    minds."" And from the first breaths of bloodstained opener ""How Low"", <em>In Our Nature</em> is haunted by the ugliness of war. With one of the more memorable, faster-paced guitar figures on the album, second video selection ""<a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/44919-jos-gonzlez-killing-for-love""><strong>Killing for Love</strong></a>"" could be an indictment of blood lust, if not the lust in our hearts.
    </p>
<p>
    The
    preaching occasionally turns slightly pat. The title track trudges a bit, and
    its repetitions (""It's in our nature,"" or, ""Put down your gun"") don't
    make the dark theme more arresting. Closer ""Cycling Trivialities"" shows
    González at his most vulnerable, with a stream of plangent notes
    bubbling out from an unaccompanied guitar, and while the song's sense of
    futility-- capping off an album heavy with the stuff-- gets pretty
    powerful, an extended outro and the awkward title phrase itself
    find González in a rare moment of unwarranted excess.
    </p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, even
    the least striking tracks have their electrifying moments: Take ""Time to Send Someone Away"", which
    sets weary defiance over handclaps, or ""Fold"", which casts up a gentle
    plea against the better of its own hard-earned wisdom. Opening with a
    yawn, ""The Nest"" adds the bagpipe-like keyboard playing of Håkan
    Wirenstrand before ending in the hiss of amplified dead air.
    </p>
<p>
    Like its predecessor, <em>In Our Nature</em> is a collection of sparse acoustic recordings. But it's a more thoughtful and atmospheric work than  either <em>Veneer</em> or last year's <em>Stay in the Shade</em>
    EP-- one that suggests González has enough talent to make good on the lofty <em>Pink Moon </em>comparisons. And for the first time, the cover-- an urgent acoustic
    rendition of Massive Attack's ""Teardrop""-- isn't even the album's best track.

    By day, Thad Calabrese and Justin Foley are mild-mannered, bespectacled working stiffs in New York, toiling away on PowerPoint presentations and diaper changes. One trip inside the telephone booth, though, and this unassuming duo transforms into one of the most impressive rising metal acts of the year. Formed in 1997, the Austerity Program have taken 10 years to spawn their full-length debut, and the wait's worth it. Despite the Program's tame background, <em>Black Madonna</em> mercilessly fires one skull-crushing riff after another, reinforced by beats so mosh-worthy you'll want to buy their drum machine a beer.</p><p>
    Some metal diehards will inevitably levy charges of amateurism or phoniness against these guys, bitter that advanced equipment and recording technology permits the making of an album like <em>Black Madonna</em> without a lifetime of nosebleeds and Satan worship under one's belt. True, <em>Black Madonna</em>'s riffs favor the mathematically precise over the technically dazzling, and the drum machine's inhumane drum rolls and double-bass sixteenths seemingly mock the limitations of carbon-based percussionists. But these subversions of metal's tenets inject a playful punk ethos in a genre oft-parodied for its, um, austerity.</p><p>
    With a cursory listen, the duo's charisma is hard to detect. Opener ""Song 12"" (all tracks are systematically numbered) slowly burns over an unfeeling riff not unlike one of Jesu or the Jesus Lizard's metal/shoegaze hybrids, each of its transitions marked by a dramatic vamp or drum fill. However, after closer inspection (and a few viewings of the band's goofy YouTube album promos), <em>Black Madonna</em> hedges its earnestness with the sort of over-the-top metal tropes reserved for violent video game soundtracks and monster truck shows. Sandwiched between the seven minute-plus epics, you'll find brief 70-second explosions like ""Song 18"", a frenetic, tightly-wound mini-boss theme that acts as an adrenalin shot to the album's heart. On the flipside, there's 15-minute closer ""Song 16"", a lurching leviathan that takes nearly five minutes to establish its main riff, let alone kickstart a steady programmed beat.
    </p>
<p>
    If all this astutely calculated headbangery sounds kinda dorky, Foley's ticked-off caterwauling should provide the fist-clenching fix you've come for. Rather than relying on tried-and-true Cookie Monster affectations, Foley shares a piss-and-vinegar howl with curmudgeon ad infinitum Steve Albini. While not quite as enraged or verbose as Albini, Foley slings tongue-in-cheek venom that nicely meshes with the cataclysmic instruments, setting up the inevitable downfall of his songs' characters. On ""Song 17A"", he tells an antagonist that they can keep coming around, but ""Pretty soon you're gonna have to stop coming around/ 'cause you're dead."" On ""Song 17B"", he briefly appears in the eye of the metal storm, happily lecturing on the effectiveness of poison on a ""quiet man"" with a cold <em>schadenfreude</em> and bouncy bass backing.
    </p>
<p>
    With its uniform distortions and canned percussion parts, <em>Black Madonna</em> doesn't quite have the texture and dynamism of the best metal. Still, considering their limited experience and DIY guidelines, Calabrese and Foley get great mileage out of their shades of gray. The prospect of adding keyboards or a living, breathing drummer to this sturdy drum/bass framework is exciting, especially if these white-collar workers devote their full attention to it. Dudes, please quit your day jobs.

    Edwyn Collins' indefatigably eccentric recording career began in 1980 with ""Falling and Laughing"", Orange Juice's debut single for Glasgow's Postcard label. It was a giddy, ramshackle joyride of a song, and with its willingness to find amusement in infatuation and consolation in wit-- at the precise moment that Joy Division were approaching their spectacular dead end-- it may even have been a tipping point for British pop after punk.</p><p>
    Over a quarter of a century later Collins returns with his sixth solo album, and a closing track that might as well have been called ""Falling and Crying"". On the face of it, <em>Home Again</em> fits right into one the 21st century's most unexpectedly rewarding genres: the post-punk Euro-soulboy midlife redemption record; to be filed alongside Scritti Politti's <em>White Bread, Black Beer</em> and Roddy Frame's <em>Western Skies</em>. Right on schedule (Collins' pop career has operated on the elliptical, cosmic timetable of an errant comet), 12 years after ""A Girl Like You"" and 24 years since ""Rip It Up"", it could even offer him his third proper hit single in ""You'll Never Know (My Love)"".</p><p>
    Like the original Euro-soulboy midlife redemption record-- Dante Alighieri's <em>The Divine Comedy</em>-- it begins midway in the journey of life, lost in the woods. ""I'd ask for directions, but my memory is shot and full of holes,"" he sings on ""Written in Stone"". ""But my recall's near perfection when compared to the condition of my soul."" And like Dante (I hope to god I'm speaking allegorically), Edwyn Collins had to go through hell to get back on track.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Home Again</em> was written and recorded in 2004-- just as Collins' critical stock was at a 20-year high, with Simon Reynolds borrowing an OJ title for his comprehensive post-punk survey <em>Rip It Up and Start Again</em>, and the release of the definitive <em>The Glasgow School</em> compilation. It was mixed in 2006. In the year in between, Collins suffered two cerebral hemorrhages and an equally threatening bout of the hospital ""superbug"" MRSA. Even after he was discharged, he and his family were encouraged to try and ""live within the limitations.""
    </p>
<p>
    Consequently, it's impossible to review the album with a dry eye, or without hearing an ominous subtext to every song. In a year when we've already lost Lee Hazlewood and Tony Wilson (and I wonder whether Collins isn't spiritually a kind of missing link between the two), it's tempting just to be grateful that he's still with us. And though it's not a perfect record, and a couple of tunes feel like sketches that have still to be properly realized, <em>Home Again</em> is nevertheless undeniably one of the most affecting records of the year.
    </p>
<p>
    Opening track ""One Is a Lonely Number"" is a spooky ode to failing better in an indifferent world: ""If life breaks your heart, you needn't fall apart, cos you've still got your mind..."" Collins sings, his croon cracked with unusually direct sincerity. It's driven by banjo and sitar, swathed in spooky harmonies and Theremin, in that Joe Meek-goes-plastic-soul style he perfected on 1994's <em>Gorgeous George</em>. As such it's untypical of the album. Because though ""You'll Never Know (My Love)"" is a chill, autumn breeze take on the Isley Brothers, <em>Home Again</em> is mostly an odd kind of folk record.
    </p>
<p>
    ""It's in Your Heart"" and ""Liberteenage Rag"" have the acoustic lilt of Collin's childhood pop idol, Donovan, and strike a note of nostalgia for the Scotland of his youth. And the eerie, foreboding ""Leviathan"", all troubled seas and furious skies, seems to hark further back, to the folk revival of the 1950s and 60s and corny but effective groups like the Corries. The title track walks a similar line with heart-breaking results. A simple, delicate acoustic ballad, in a certain light you could almost mistake it for a rueful Jim Reeves song all about straying, betraying, and belatedly coming to your senses.
    </p>
<p>
    I interviewed Collins at his home in west London a couple of weeks ago, and though his recovery has exceeded all expectations, he was still frustrated with getting his words to work as fluently as they once did. A lot of the time he was happier singing to me: because of the structure of brain injuries, people recovering from strokes can often sing sentences impeccably they might have trouble simply speaking. So he started crooning ""Home Again"", over a cup of coffee and some fig rolls. Once started, he soon realized he was having too much fun to stop. ""Outside on the street, I heard somebody singing/ And I heard the music ringing/ Rrom some clapped-out pirate station/ It was my unholy salvation."" At the end he burst out laughing. ""I've still got it, haven't I?"" And you know what? He really does.

How else to explain how the Delgados managed to fly so long just under the radar? They were indie darlings, sure, but even as far as indie darlings go, the Scottish group was strictly cult fare. By the time the band quietly broke up, after a string of strong albums culminating with the wonderful swan song <em>Universal Audio</em>, the Delgados were still barely filling Stateside venues vastly disproportionate to their immense charm.</p><p>
    Anyway, life goes on. With news of the breakup, fans flipped their internal hourglasses and waited for the sand to count down to the first solo album. That arrives in the form of <em>Watch the Fireworks</em>, the solo bow from singer Emma Pollock, one of the Delgados' co-leaders and its creative engine. Needless to say, those fans will find much to like. In fact, while <em>Watch the Fireworks</em> doesn't pick up where <em>Universal Audio</em> left off, it owes much to the poppier and more streamlined direction the group had been following. Aside from some keyboards and piano, the disc further abandons the tricky orchestral arrangements of the Delgados' past in favor of the alternately bittersweet and bright hooks we expect from Pollock.</p><p>
    All the same, waltz-time opener ""New Land"" is explicitly about making a clean break. ""And so begins the show/ And not for the first time/ We step on the fault line/ And just like that/ We watch the fireworks start."" The fireworks, however, don't really start until the second song, ""Acid Test"", with its familiar stop-start guitar riffs and rumbling drums: Pollock is clearly in her comfort zone here, both vocally and musically.</p><p>
    Yet Pollock also reveals a quieter side, unencumbered by the dreaminess that often cloaked similar songs in the Delgados' catalog. The gentle piano and picking of ""Limbs"" and ""Fortune"" somehow skirt folk clichés, coming off grand despite the subdued arrangements, while ""If Silence Means That Much to You"" swings wonderfully as she veers from a pounding bridge to a rousing chorus. The short and deceptively upbeat downer ""This Rope's Getting Tighter"" may be yet another profession of artistic nervousness on the part of Pollock-- ""Keep it simple/ Keep me static/ Just enough to lose the panic,"" she sings-- but you'd never guess someone with such clear and obvious pop instincts would still be dealing with butterflies. </p><p>
    Not that Pollock has gone pop. Pollock approaches songs such as ""Adrenaline"" and ""You'll Come Around"" as if they are pop, and it's everyone else's problem that they're not as popular as they should be. Pollock sums it all up nicely in emotionally contradictory closer ""The Optimist"": ""As long as I'm upright I'll try to prolong/ The notion that future events must go on/ No matter the turn out is right or is wrong."" She soon second-guesses her enthusiasm with the self-conscious counter-take ""when everyone's watching it's hard to admit/ The movement of shadows that lead me to quit."" It's a bummer of a way to end an album that finds Pollock doing what she does best. The optimist-- and anyone rooting for Pollock-- would say she needn't worry so much.<br/></p></div>"|10690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10690-watch-the-fireworks/|7.4|Joshua Klein

    Back when Adam Franklin was blowing cool about cars and guns as Swervedriver's head honcho, his drowsy drawl was the perfect complement to the group's blistering effects-pedal attack. His work under the Toshack Highway moniker was certainly less spirited than what he's best known for, but he's always had a sleepy way about him. It's only here on his first official solo album where Franklin actually sounds tired and worn-out, both in a good and bad way. While <em>Bolts of Melody</em> deftly illustrates that his way with a tune hasn't diminished in the slightest, his attempts to split the difference between rocking and reclining leaves the album worse for wear.</p><p>
<em>Bolts of Melody</em> starts off with a relative bang, and while ""Seize the Day"" says what it needs to say in just over two minutes, it comes off as a half-hearted nod to his previous days. The same goes for the oddly muted ""Shining Somewhere"". ""Syd's Eyes"" is presumably meant to pay homage to Syd Barrett, but it sounds more like a watered-down pastiche of Franklin's swinging 1960s touchstones (the ""Space Oddity"" homage ""Walking in Heaven's Foothills"" is much more flattering.) The other nominal ""rock"" track on <em>Bolts</em>, ""Birdsong"", sounds like Franklin getting in touch with his inner Eric Clapton. And I'm talking about the arena-rockin' Eric Clapton that epitomized the worst excesses of the 80s. That the track also appears in a stripped-down acoustic version does the album no favors.</p><p>
    Aside from that misstep, the album's less energetic tracks are what save this record. Gentle psychedelic songs like ""Sundown"" and ""Morning Rain"" might find Franklin gazing more at his navel than his shoes, but he sounds much more comfortable and confident taking it easy. Only the appropriately titled instrumental ""Theme from LSD"" tops the latter track's hypnotic groove, though both feature stellar wah-wah pedal work that would make Jimi Hendrix smile. And while the album starts off on the wrong foot, it ends on a strong note. One would think a track called ""Ramonesland"" would be an upbeat album closer. Instead, it's a dreamy seven-minute tour that encapsulates everything good about this album. There's a line midway through the track about a girl playing the Red House Painters, where Franklin says they sound ""fucking depressing."" It might be a toss-away zinger at that sort of introspection (which Franklin willfully indulges in throughout this album), but it comes off as knowing irony: The most depressing tracks on <em>Bolts of Melody</em> are those that superficially sound the least depressing.

The proper names, liars, and criminals that made up their lyrics were like a world we only wished we could fully relate to. Which was fine by them: Whatever <i>you</i> were doing, they wanted no part of it. Jarcrew graduated from Wales' underground around the same time as Mclusky, but they lacked the more well-known band's swagger and nonchalance. They were the brilliant, creative, genre-defying geeks who tried a bit too hard-- Mclusky were off pulling fire alarms while the Jarcrew were writing screenplays in the computer lab after hours.</p>
<p>Future of the Left is the mutually beneficial pact between the two camps, with guitarist/vocalist Andy Falkous and drummer Jack Egglestone from Mclusky joining forces with the singer-turned-bassist of Jarcrew-- stripping down, geeking out, emoting earnestly for at least a few seconds at a time, and indulging several silly ideas that almost always come together in the end. Is it possible for musicians to show growth and maturity while singing about pretty pussycats and couples who eat sausage on a stick? <i>Curses</i>, the band's debut, makes a compelling argument for ""yes.""</p>
<p>The big difference between FOTL and their predecessors is the use of keyboards, but skeptical fans will be pleased to learn that the keys are wielded like broken toys with the pointy bits leveled squarely at the audience. The oscillating whine of ""Suddenly It's a Folk Song"" sounds like an infant's mobile set to ""seizure,"" yet somehow makes for a stunning slacker anthem, while the guitarless ""Manchasm"" is just a platform to lampoon one Mark Foley (no, not the former U.S. congressman, the co-owner of a Cardiff studio). Once you've gotten used to the idea, the neanderthal new wave of ""Team:Seed"" and ""Manchasm"" are particularly gratifying.</p>
<p>There are familiar textures here, certainly, but they're a bit more detached about the grind. ""The Lord Hates a Coward"" is impressively ugly, but almost clinical in its odd harmonics and precise punches. ""Plague of Onces"" follows up with a quick shot of tempo, adrenaline, and judicious screaming from Falkous, and it probably benefits from being more stripped-down and arch, leaving all it's rhythmic twists and purple bass tones barer and more jagged. Even ""Small Bones Small Bodies"", the most Mcluskyish of the bunch, is much more syncopated and nervous, barring the queasy middle eight that could have been ripped from <i>Incesticide</i>.</p>
<p>By the time they do get loud and stupid on ""adeadenemyalwayssmellsgood"", it seems almost plain in comparison. There are moments that sound a little more like exercises than songs, like the circular structures of ""My Gymnastic Past"" and ""Fuck the Countryside Alliance"", but you'll grow to love-- or maybe be calloused by-- the group's sharp edges, fitting better with quirkier lyrics and increased variation from song to song. (I'd certainly never guess they'd add glammy piano rolls to ""Real Men Hunt in Packs"", coming off like Jesus Lizard taking on Elton John.)</p>
<p>There's a surprising focus on the vocals here, but Falkous proves himself more than up to the task. The wall-of-harmonies on ""Fingers Become Thumbs!"" or ""Suddenly It's a Folk Song"" that are unexpected and inspired, while his fey and mocking inflections dropped in the hardest tracks like ""Plague of Onces"" and ""Small Bones Small Bodies"" make them that much more appealing. These songs also veer from baiting and bilious to tender in small bounds: The lyrics of ""Manchasm"" move from ""Colin is a pussy"" to ""Colin is a very pretty pussycat,"" while the self-deprecating lyrical fragments of ""Suddenly It's a Folk Song"" end on the line, ""Now we are not burdened by love.""</p>
<p>With tracks like ""Small Bones Small Bodies"" and ""Plague of Onces"", it'd be understandable if you walked away wishing <i>Curses</i> put the pedal down a bit more often. However, toning it down just a bit shows that Falkous was more multi-faceted than many might have surmised, only because Mclusky's thrash was so potent it was easy to overlook. It's doesn't sustain tension like <i>Mclusky Do Dallas</i>, but not much else does. <i>Curses</i> retains all the bile, all the laughs, and adds enough musicality to remind you that-- even after changing the program somewhat-- they're still unmatched at balancing equal parts humor and spite with a tune.</p></div>"|10698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10698-curses/|8.0|Jason Crock

Debut album <em>Dance the Dance Electric</em> took up arms in the disco-punk revolution the label had declared a couple of years earlier with near-perfect 12""'s like the Rapture's ""House of Jealous Lovers"" and LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"". Except Shocking Pinks' one-man-band man Nick Harte couldn't be pigeonholed as easily as most of his cowbell-wielding peers. Harte's interests were more eclectic, his lyrics bittersweet. Party-starters aren't supposed to have, like, feelings.</p><p>
    Beyond its high standard of quality, Shocking Pinks' first DFA release might seem a less obvious fit for the label. And not just because Harte's project shares its name with Neil Young's 1980s rockabilly sidemen. A 17-track, 45-minute compilation cherrypicked from Shocking Pinks' two 2005 albums for New Zealand's legendary Flying Nun imprint (<em>Mathematical Warfare</em> and <em>Infinity Land</em>), <em>Shocking Pinks</em> veers even further from early-2000s Brooklyn for an emotionally vulnerable highlight reel of scruffy Jesus and Mary Chain dream-pop, ecstatic My Bloody Valentine haze, droning C-86 confessionals, and bedroom New Order bass lines. Oh yeah, and cowbell.</p><p>
    Harte is the ex-drummer for the Brunettes, who made their promising Sub Pop debut earlier this year. Those Kiwi indie-poppers go for lavish studio orchestration, but Shocking Pinks adhere to the lo-fi principles of hugely influential Flying Nun bands the Clean and Tall Dwarfs. Harte's vocals are whispery and fragile, delivered with a slight lisp. He plays all the instruments himself: The tragic synths on ""End of the World"" or ""The Narrator"", the electric-guitar squall of ""Blonde Haired Girl"" or <em>Psychocandy</em> descendant ""I Want U Back"", the distant acoustic strums over the fuzzed-out anomie of ""Victims"", the prominent Peter Hook bass of ""This Aching Deal"". You can hear strings squeaking, fingers sliding-- the homemade-pop legacy of Flying Nun's early-1980s Dunedin Sound left to 1990s indie groups like Pavement or Boyracer.
    </p><p>
    Most of all, you can hear the drums. Jealous love song ""Emily"" pans them over to the left, where Harte's cymbal-heavy clatter stands opposite skuzzy bass, elongated synths, and chiming percussion. In fact, an emphasis on rhythm and percussive elements seems to be the one place where Shocking Pinks intersect with other DFA acts. ""SmokeScreen"" is the most overt dance-punk nod here; Harte's clipped speak-singing (""Just take the medicine"") and cowbell ruckus could fit easily onto LCD songs like ""Us V. Them"". Original New York dance-punks ESG or Liquid Liquid might recognize the funky breaks beneath ominous, synth-led ""Yes! No!"" or buzzing hi-hat exercise ""Cutout"". 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Shocking Pinks</em> is ragged and emotive where the DFA's other
    recent full-length release, UK post-punk duo Prinzhorn Dance School's
    quite good self-titled debut, is terse and mechanical. ""I love you when
    you're happy, I love when you're sad/ But I'd rather be your retard
    babe than be your motherfucking dad/ Telling you what to do,"" Harte
    sings with hissing breaths on the album's heroin-clouded standout, ""How
    Am I Not Myself?"". On midtempo lo-fi rocker ""Second Hand Girl"", Harte
    imagines a tearful encounter on a woman's doorstep: ""You let them go
    like falling stars, passing through the years."" Elliott Smith used to
    juxtapose pop sentimentality and fucked-up romantic bitterness like
    this, too. 
    </p>
<p>
    A couple of tracks are basically just interludes-- instrumentals ""Wake Up"" and ""23""-- and one or two, specifically ""Girl on the Northern Line"" and ""Jealousy"", are more languid and meandering than the best songs here. Even so, Shocking Pinks' DFA debut is an auspicious one by a young artist who knows as much about loneliness as he does noisy pop classics. The finale, Harte's cover of Arthur Russell's ""You Can Make Me Feel Bad"", reworks the <em>Calling Out of Context</em> original's dive-bombing cello as naïve, evocative guitar-pop. Its title could be Shocking Pinks' songwriting manifesto. His heartache, our pleasure.

    Metal and drone's rhetoric tends to prize nature as awesome above all, so here goes: if some bands are earthquakes, Om are erosion-- slow, massive, patient. By my count, bassist and vocalist Al Cisneros plays five different notes on <em>Pilgrimage</em>. He takes the notes and puts them in a row, then he turns the row inside out, then he hiccups the notes in patterns so intimate and subtle it's hard to figure out whether they're patterns at all. Cisneros and drummer Chris Hakius don't make ""stupid"" or ""smart"" music, it's just a lot more detailed and engaging than it immediately appears, which is probably why their audience splits the difference between gobsmacked stoner rock fans and people who like to listen to Steve Reich or Alice Coltrane and stare into rugs.</p><p>
    While rhythm sections tend to play as if periods were the only punctuation mark, Om break space with commas, semicolons, and side clauses-- their storytelling prowess and dramatic timing rival a glacier's or a narcoleptic's. But again, that's not the point. Om is a pointless band, and that's high praise. If <em>Pilgrimage</em> holds a discernable achievement, it's that it forges a sense of intricacy-- and a balance between the crushing and the meditative-- that Om struggled with on <em>Variations on a Theme</em> and 2006's <em>Conference of the Birds</em>. Most of ""Bhima's Theme"" is bread and butter for head-nodders, but ""Pilgrimage"" (which opens and closes the record), is shiftier and less stable, accentuated by a bassline that seems to tack extra bars to a phrase if it feels good, not for the sake of metrics. It's not metal and it's not even drone; it's like a heavy folk dance.</p><p>
    A friend recently remarked that he didn't really care for Om because they seemed ""unidirectional,"" which struck me as more of a preference than a criticism. Either way, I sense they're a little different-- not as keen on crushing your fucking solar plexus with the volume-hammer; willing to forgo wonky pagan cover art or brutalist abstraction for a Christian icon; softer, more traditional, older-world. If there's any climax on the record, it's about nine minutes into
    ""Bhima's Theme"", when Cisneros
    blurts out the name ""LAZARUS"" after a minute of near-silent bass
    noodling, then disappears. I spit hot tea into
    my lap. It's hilariously portentous-- Om's not exactly the sound of
    levity-- but they wear it well: I'm hard pressed to think of many bands
    that could shatter a
    song with one word.
    </p>
<p>
    Even if it doesn't reach the highs of <em>Conference</em>'s ""At Giza"", <em>Pilgrimage</em>
    is the most varied and comprehensive album they've made. Another more
    metal-oriented friend tried to ward me off Om with suggestions of bands
    he thought made similar music, but better: Earth, Corruption; he even
    tried me on Khanate. All passably gigantic, sure, but none of them
    sounded as delicate or transportive as Om. When my friend said
    ""unidirectional,"" I couldn't help but
    think of how ""Pilgrimage"" does sound kinda like Pink Floyd's ""Set the
    Controls for the Heart of the Sun"".

    How full of shit is Jon Spencer, really? It's a question that has baffled critics for ages, or at least since whenever in the 1990s the collective decision was made to define the decade's overarching tone as ""ironic."" The man's got his share of self-aware affectations; how can anyone who sings like he does in this day and age not be persistently conscious of a debt not just to Elvis, but to a whole lifetime's worth of comedy-Elvis hucksters? Whether those affectations are in the service of minstrelsy-twice-removed and a disconnected Southern fetishism depends on whom you ask: Robert Christgau stomped a mudhole in Spencer circa 1994 for using his ""cultural-chronological advantages"" to make 60s and 70s blooze-rawk into what purists would consider a farcical grotesquerie, but Jon isn't so much a signifier or a stand-in as he is a largely unserious personality who willingly let the blues do more damage to him than he could feasibly do to it. I suppose asking him wouldn't hurt, in which case you could go by his interviews and note his frequent admittances that the blues and rockabilly and pre-Beatles rock in general is just, well, something he likes and thinks is cool. A fair enough explanation.</p><p>
    Hearing nothing motivationally other than ""I like it, might as well play it"" in Heavy Trash will at least help you along towards enjoying the record a lot more, even as it-- like anything that seems at least somewhat deliberately anachronistic-- might leave you asking what its place is in the here and now. It's the same question a lot of people ask after seeing a Tarantino film: does he think all those pop-culture asides are cool on their own terms, or did they have to get old and disused first? In the latter case, there's typically some sort of kitsch factor embedded in the final product, which is one of the things that <em>Going Way Out With Heavy Trash</em> doesn't seem to run on. A kitsch merchant might stop right around ""Charlie Feathers sang all hiccupy"" or ""I want a modified Gretsch exactly like the one Eddie Cochran played,"" but Spencer and cohort Matt Verta-Ray subtly place themselves over your typical rockabilly Xerox acts by drawing out the more eccentric, individual quirks that the original 50s artists didn't bury under a nostalgia that hadn't happened yet.</p><p>
    And how legitimate are these quirks? Well, three of the songs have titles that end with the word ""baby"" (and they all start pretty goofily, too: ""Kissy Baby"", ""She Baby"", and ""Crazy Pritty Baby""); there's a rave-up number called ""They Were Kings"" that exists to give gratitude to rock revivalists of years past like the Gories and the Cheater Slicks (""Misunderstood geniuses of a-rock'n'roll... wearin' sideburns""); and Jon screams ""Everybody say yes please/ Everybody say no thank you/ I wanna suck my brain out my eyeball"" in the first twenty seconds of ""I Want Oblivion"" like some combination of Johnnies Rotten and Burnette. At least to a point, it's punk-style irreverent without being entirely blasphemous, and Heavy Trash have a certain winking levity to 'em; if they didn't, what the hell would they be doing getting Tony Millionaire to do their album art?
    </p>
<p>
    But <em>Going Way Out</em> isn't a Pomade-slicked exercise in giggling like an idiot at that kooky hillbilly music, not when they're playing like they do. Spencer's voice might be have some artifice to it, but it's an affectionate one, and it does some flat-out crazy shit: leaping and hitching and growling and cackling, turning huge gulps of air into a sort of percussion, even going three-quarters <em>Man in Black</em> on ""That Ain't Right"" (just far enough to avoid crossing over into Cheech and Chong's ""Johnny Stash"" parody turf). Verta-Ray's guitar completes the double-frontman equation with a style that pushes Cochran, Link Wray, and Luther Perkins a couple decades closer to punk in a way Joe Strummer did in his later years, while his note-bending hacksaw riffs on ""I Want Oblivion"" and dilated-pupil screeches on the scuzzy, Beefhearty beatnik hobo-lament blues dirge ""You Can't Win"" stand out just as much as the more traditional twangs and snarls that power the likes of ""She Baby"" and ""Kissy Baby"".

<p>
    The choice to recruit three different groups to record with-- including Canadian alt-country band the Sadies (who give ""Outside Chance"" a 1967 Stones feel), a Danish group made up of members of surf-rock pranksters Tremolo Beer Gut, garage weirdos Powersolo (magnificently eerie on ""Crying Tramp""), and New York session hands Simon Chardiet and Phil Hernandez (a rock-solid rhythm section on ""Pure Gold"" and ""Way Out"")-- keeps things diverse. <em>Going Way Out With Heavy Trash</em> is a lot of things-- wild, aged, loose, dangerous, ridiculous, respectful-- but it's not a joke. Even if it is kinda funny.

    There seems to be more craft than soul in Josh Ritter's songs. An intelligent songwriter working in a vein previously mined by older artists from Bob Dylan to Randy Newman, Ritter remains so melodically and lyrically self-aware that his songs take on the character of literary endeavor rather than musical undertaking-- an approach that has earned him a rapid fan base. He places every word, renders every image, unspools every theme, and lays out every melody with superlatively efficient precision that the resulting songs-- including those on <em>The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter</em>, his fifth studio album in eight years-- possess no defining blemishes or faults, no open wounds or emotional heft. There's a lot of smarts in his music, but little sense of spontaneity or discovery.</p><p>
    Perhaps aware of this academic distance or perhaps just
    aching for a new approach, Ritter chose to shake up his writing, arranging, and
    recording process on <em>Historical Conquests</em>.
    Writing melodies first and words later, he decamped to Maine
    with long-time collaborator Sam Kassirer and a new band, aiming to capture something
    more rough-and-tumble than his previous albums. That he did: <em>Historical Conquests</em> proves more
    rambunctiously immediate than any of its predecessors while retaining its smart
    arrangements. Ritter's vocals, especially on songs like opener ""To the Dogs or
    Whoever"" and ""Mind's Eye"", do sound looser and less practiced, as if he's
    trying to make every first take work. On ""Rumors"", he boasts that his ""string
    section's screaming like horses in a barn burning up."" It's an evocative
    image, but it never escapes the bounds of simile. His band sounds loud and
    insistent, but they never cut loose enough to make any of the songs actually
    sound like that.</p><p>
    There are some nice moments on <em>Historical Conquests</em>: Ritter can
    click off a great, even unexpected line-- like ""I traded all the innocence I
    ever had for hesitation""-- whose meanings his audience must excavate over many listens.
    But these songs rarely sound lived in or personable; rather, they're more like
    museum dioramas where he can pose figures like Calamity Jane, Casey Jones, and
    Casey at the Bat in stiff tableaux. ""To the Dogs or Whoever"", which namedrops
    each of these American icons (and throws in Joan of Arc for good measure), could
    be an epilogue to a senior thesis. Ritter fares
    slightly better on love songs like ""Right Moves"", with its slick 1970s pop sheen,
    but the back-to-back sequencing of the too-similar ""Still Beating"" and ""Empty
    Hearts"", especially followed by a short, unnecessary reprise of ""Wait for Love"",
    clogs the second half of <em>Historical
    Conquests</em>, ending on an especially low note and making the album seem
    overlong. 
    </p>
<p>
    To his credit, Ritter sees no difference here between folk
    artists like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and pop artists like Hall &amp;
    Oates and Brian Wilson; in his eyes, all are important artists working in
    distinctly American idioms. But Ritter's combination of their styles and sound
    nevertheless comes across as overly safe-- closer to Fastball than anything with
    historical merit. As a result, he's often labeled MOR, but that name-calling,
    which extends to more indie-friendly acts like Feist, Cat Power, and even the
    National, might have more to do with MOR's self-legitimizing embrace of roots
    music than with anything inherent in Ritter's music. In actuality, his meticulous
    roots pop sounds rootless, taking a big-picture view of the country and its
    history but with no fixed perspective to lend his musings any specificity. His
    Americana is holistically, blandly American, which-- in an age when sprawl and
    box stores are edging out regional differences-- might suit the present
    cultural moment better than any of us would like to believe.

The nostalgia trip continues on the band's latest album, <em>Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace</em>, which reunites the Foos with <em>Colour</em> producer Gil Norton (who has since worked with Jimmy Eat World, Maxïmo Park, and Morningwood, among others). The result, however, feels like a retread, a shame for a band that-- as one of the few late 1990s/early 2000s modern rock groups to enjoy a long run of success-- has practically become a walking metonym for alt-rock in the same way Kleenex has for tissues.</p><p>
    Album opener and first single ""The Pretender"" goes through the same motions as early, successful anthemic rawkers ""I'll Stick Around"" or ""Monkey Wrench"", and packing plenty of clever ideas and fist-pumping firepower, it's the most interesting song the band's released in quite a while. But deploying that same vitriol proves clumsy on hard-rocking post-relationship bummers like ""Let It Die"" (featuring the infinitely repeated plea ""Why'd you have to go and let it die?"") and ""Long Road to Ruin"". Even ""Erase/Replace"", sporting the album's catchiest chorus, can't atone for its hackneyed heartache and Fugazi-lite riffs.</p><p>
    On <em>The Colour and the Shape</em>, Norton brushed up the already passé grunge sound of the Foos' debut, applying a sleeker, arena-sized version of the loud/quiet dynamic he famously produced on the final three Pixies albums. While Norton's touch often sounded hyperbolic (see: <em>Colour</em>'s ""Enough Space"" and ""Up in Arms""), he was merely an accessory to a band that was ready for its close-up. Now, with the Foos being full-fledged rock stars, Norton's presence takes a backseat to the band's heightened technical skill, which has grown exponentially since the addition of dexterous guitarist Chris Shiflett in 1999. The band hardly rallies around Grohl's ear-grabbing melodies and complementary guitar lines anymore, opting instead for a vanilla classic rock sound where vocals do their bit and showy solos or overly complicated riffs fill in the empty spaces. Bent on striking the right big rock pose at the right time, these potentially simple and endearing three-minute pop songs sound cold and detached compared to heart-wrenching Foo pop gems like ""Big Me"" or ""Everlong"".</p><p>
    For the past decade, the Foo Fighters have used acoustic numbers as placeholders to fill out their albums, a trick gone too far on 2006's unplugged record <em>Skin and Bones</em>. Several campus-lawn ballads on <em>Echoes</em> trigger nightmarish flashbacks from that live album, most notably ""Stranger Things Have Happened"" and ""But, Honestly"". Grohl's split-personality of happy-go-lucky punk-prankster and teary-eyed balladeer has never felt more dissonant than on these heart-on-sleeve pieces, and unfortunately, a quarter of the album succumbs to this schmaltz. <em>Echoes</em> does attempt to forge new ground, as Grohl's longtime affinity for Tom Petty sounds very apparent on the Americana-faded ""Statues"" and ""Summer's End"", though the novelty quickly wears off, the coyote-howl of the guitars lacking the necessary power to mask the drab melodies.</p><p>
<em>Echoes</em>' most telling slip-up comes during ""Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners"", an instrumental track dedicated to the Tasmania coal mine victims that clashes the band's magnanimous intentions with an awkward musical direction. Sounding like a Led Zeppelin <em>III</em> outtake, the track highlights the Foo Fighters' unsolicited willingness to be everything to everybody all the time. Consequently, they're sounding less and less relatable, leaving us pining not just for the days of a little grunge trio from Seattle, but for the relentlessly catchy and charismatic Dave Grohl of the Foos' still-fantastic self-titled debut and the better half of <em>The Colour and the Shape</em>.</p></div>"|10694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10694-echoes-silence-patience-and-grace/|4.2|Adam Moerder

    atmosphere from the moment his records begin to play,
    a new release by house/techno producer Ricardo
    Villalobos is also characterized by a slight
    apprehension in those seconds before you drop the
    stylus, as you wonder if you're going to walk away
    feeling like you've actually been had. Villalobos' sparest stretches of pure rhythm can be frustratingly opaque while still daring you to give the record just one more spin; even those who've called him a genius (like me) sometimes worry they're not in on some inscrutable gag. But where last December's ""Fizheuer
    Zieheuer"" single intoxicated (or irritated… see, I
    still can't decide) by stretching just a handful of
    parts across 37 minutes, the hour-plus <em>Fabric
    36</em> brims with the piled-up (and pilled-up)
    rhythmic layering that characterizes Villalobos at his
    most intriguing.</p><p>
<em>Fabric 36</em> is Villalobos' ravenously awaited mix CD, and it just happens to be blended entirely from his own new productions and remixes. These cut-and-paste percussion clinics would be already straining with detail as stand-alone tracks, but their interlocking beats become ever more complex in
    the virtuoso way Villalobos meshes them, as when the opening electronic tones of ""Groove 1880"" sprout acoustic cymbal accents and jazz snares nine minutes later during ""Moongomery"". The hyper-percussive top end of the mix is perpetually bustling, too: Peppering his tracks with preverbal hiccups, askew extraneous rhythms, and halting half-melodies is one of Villalobos' favorite (and most effective) tricks throughout <em>Fabric 36</em>-- both for keeping the listener engaged and for lending his music its trademark uneasy quality. Phantom voices are layered into bad-trip
    swirls on ""Organic Tranceplant"" and ""Fumiyandric 2"".
    Strange sizzling noises flare up during an otherwise
    austere drum track. <em>Fabric 36</em> constantly slips
    and slides around multiple percussive pulses, yet remains utterly sensual.</p><p>
    If the snapping tick-tock of ""Farenzer House"" or the bouncy full-vocal cut ""4 Wheel Drive"" suggest the Villalobos of old-- standard electro-house with a case of the shivers and sniffles-- then the rumbling ""Andruic and Japan"" is the most audacious example yet of the Chilean producer's freehand approach to disassembling techno's grid. Over 12 minutes long, it drops thunderous bursts of arrhythmic wooden percussion over autistic percolation, shattering the mix's momentum. But slowly, Villalobos reconfigures those skull-crushing mallets back into the almighty 4/4. That (often nearly undetectable) hand ordering things is what keeps <em>Fabric 36</em> from turning into flurry of spooky sound effects and aimless drum loops. Villalobos' barely-there melodies (like the descending deep-house organ hum in ""Prevorent"") and unerringly steady tempo float you downriver as swarms of beats circle overhead. It's that gentle but unyielding push that keeps even his most outré moments-- the woozy soccer stadium chant ""Premier Encuentro Latino-Americano"" bleeding into ""Chropuspel Zündung"", Villalobos smearing the cacophony of a sampled crowd into a jumbo jet roar-- from wrecking not only your head but your equilibrium.</p><p>
    Thanks to Villalobos' cheekily narcissistic tracklist, <em>Fabric 36</em> is in the unenviable position of both having to deliver the arc of a great DJ mix and to stand as the first multi-track collection of mostly new Villalobos material in more than a year. In both cases, it can be judged a triumph, a controlled burst of rangy productivity that offers a full-spectrum look at Villalobos' various obsessions (the power of percussion, haunted house vibeology, dub science applied to Latin swing and Germanic snap, minimalism vs. maximalism). The ebb and flow of a heterogeneous DJ set makes it easier listening than the often grindingly static repetitions of 2004's <em>Thé Au Harem D'Archimède</em>, while it still offers moments so polyrhythmic that they make that earlier record sound downright ingratiating. Technically, it's just stunning-- the most alchemical digital-into-analog (and vice versa) home-listening DJ mix I've heard in years. And if you've ever felt on the wrong end of Villalobos' formalist stunts-- if you have a love/hate relationship with his mix of the engrossing and exasperating-- you can take comfort in the fact that while <em>Fabric 36</em> is hardly pop, it repays your undivided attention from the first listen.</p></div>"|10688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10688-fabric-36/|8.7|Jess Harvell

    Gang Gang Dance's 2006 CMJ performance at Webster Hall remains an unexpectedly transcendent moment. I'd seen the quartet a dozen times before (and in various forms since), but something about Lizzie Bougatsos, decked out in a Ghostface Killah tee, leading the boys through a real-time percussive collage in front of a half-filled room seemed like the weird promise of this avant crew eventually <em>filling</em> a big club without compromising one iota. A certain charismatic command of the stage, yea, but also the density and liveliness of the <em>sound</em> eking into every corner, jamming shit into the gaps that existed between the spread out, diffident crowd.</p><p>
    GGD's most recent full-length, <em>God's Money</em>, has improved over the two years since it was released, but all we've gotten in its wake are teasers: First came the 30-minute collaged <em>Hillulah</em>, the <span class=""reviewtitle""></span>soundtrack-in-a-soundtrack of gorilla-happy <em>Retina Riddim</em> CD/DVD, and now <em>RAWWAR</em>, a three-song EP that taps out just over 20 minutes. The two earlier pieces had their joys, but of all these mini-discs, <em>RAWWAR</em>'s the most satisfying.</p><p>
    Straight outta the gate, hot-stepping opener and regular live staple ""Nicoman"" is GGD in pop mode, a taut rhythm with a crystalline core. A few minutes in Bougatsos' vocal intonation practically sounds like M.I.A., but she surfs the percussion in a more soul-nodding way, tapping a different sort of avant-pop tribalism. ""Nicoman"" is followed by the new wave-y instrumental ""Oxygen-Riddim Demo""-- the synth is so tinny, you can feel it blowing back someone's feathered hair (though, high school students should adopt it for proms everywhere). The track builds to GGD's signature Kabuki-style notation atop drum clicks and drags. After moving into a catchy patch of Junior Boys-like 4 a.m. pop, the song ends with a few seconds of sampled rain. 
    </p>
<p>
    Closer ""The Earthquake That Frees Prisoners"" could've taken a turn for the worse with its Godspeed-style sampled-voice-against-dramatic-backdrop thing, but the voice here is Nathan Maddox, an early member of GGD who died after being struck by lightning on a NYC rooftop. So take a step back to that rain at the end of ""Oxygen-Riddim Demo"" and now listen to his voice as he mentions ""rooftops,"" as well as dust, terror, anxiety, pain, and...well, this suddenly is a lot more moving than your usual faux-cinematic narrative. Opening with a Bougatsos wail, the montage moves to a more anthemic place-- the band is all systems go for 11 minutes as it celebrates its ghosts.

As the newest entrants to indie-rock's ever-expanding campfire folk circle, Seattle's Cave Singers like to sing of god and country, though only in the vaguest terms. Listening to the trio's Matador Records debut, you get the sense that, for them, singing about the lord is simply as much a prerequisite for roots-music authenticity as their ragged acoustic strums, walking bass lines, and snare-brushed rhythms.</p><p>
    While bassist Derek Fudesco's previous tenures in Murder City Devils and Pretty Girls Make Graves provide the most salient details of the band's back story, the Cave Singers really focus on the voice of one: Pete Quirk, whose endearingly nasal tenor-- think of a less snotty, more stoned Gordon Gano-- is entrusted to carry the band's brittle hymnals. Quirk is prone to stretching his words beyond decipherability, but he's especially effective at communicating that bleary-eyed feeling of darkness turning into dawn: When Quirk sings, ""Ooh, thinking of heaven,"" on <em>Invitation Songs</em>' highly inviting opener, ""Seeds of Night"", you can practically hear the smile that's spreading across his face, while the closing brass fanfare adds a glint to his teeth.</p><p>
    Quirk's voice lends a peculiar, alien quality to the Singers' otherwise basic, busker-band foundation, though that's not even enough to elevate back-porch stompers like ""Dancing on Our Graves"" and ""Oh Christine"" beyond genre exercises. The singer's winsome personality is best revealed on sweet tambourine-tapped serenades like ""Cold Eye"" and ""Elephant Clouds"", but the Cave Singers also explore weightier, gloomier territory, with mixed results. The ominous backwoods creeper ""New Monuments"" is of a piece with Mark Lanegan and Kurt Cobain's Leadbelly makeovers, with a blaring chorus of melodica and harmonica intensifying the song's menacing lurch. Less compelling, however, is the closing funeral march ""Called"", another melodica-enhanced track on which Quirk over-drowses his voice for dramatic effect-- ""oh lord, tear me down,"" he pleads, but the tremble in his voice makes it difficult to discern the details of his transgressions.</p><p>
    If these songs constitute the Cave Singers' most pronounced attempts at transcending standard folk tropes, it's the gentle, percussion-free lullaby ""Helen"" that ultimately proves most successful: over a finger-picked melody, Quirk pours his heart out to his titular subject while tremolo effects reverberate around the room, a fitting analog for his quickening pulse. Whether these sorts of modernist intrusions suggest a latent desire to turn into Spiritualized will be revealed on the next Cave Singers album. But even in small, sporadic doses, they lend greater depth and color to <em>Invitation Songs</em>' sepia-toned surface-- and raise the possibility that the Cave Singers' earth-bound aesthetic is perhaps just a temporary state, a prelude to something bigger that they're either too timid to explore just yet, or simply too cash-strapped to indulge.</p></div>"|10695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10695-invitation-songs/|6.8|Stuart Berman

    Austin's Oh No! Oh My! are like a nice boyfriend you wish you could get mad at once in awhile, if only to scracth behind their pleasant veneer and unleash something new and potentially revealing. The band debuted with its self-titled, self-released album in 2006, mottled with pleasurable little guitar numbers and dim synth explorations. Even its darker songs like ""I Love You All the Time"" buckled into the snappy and clappy realm after a couple of minutes, which was jarring but excusable. On this polished Dim Mak sampling the trio almost entirely strips the electric circuits, legging up resolutely into the twee region perhaps once and for all, with just a hint on the goofy ""The Bike, Sir"" of UK label mates the Mystery Jets' ephemerally interesting folk rock.</p><p>
    Twee is one of those <em>je ne sais quoi</em> genres that you simply know upon hearing giveaway elements-- in this case it's tones and plucks and human meowing, which you either want to eat up or throw up. Opener ""Oh Be One"" is a dorky play on words as well as a predictable rocking-horse shimmy on the acoustic guitar's top strings. The percussion is so homemade and understated (or undermixed), it's indiscernible from, say, traffic or footsteps: hands hitting each other, hands hitting hollow things with sticks, and so on. The lyrics don't help-- round and round goes the same line, ""Yes you are my only hope/ Oh be one/ You're my only hope."" The effect is simply: Really? This is the song?</p><p>
    ""The Party Punch"" fares better, depending on the same repetitive nature of the first track to play the same kind of happy, hop-skippy note patterns on the acoustic guitar. Off-key yelps give way to shouts peppering the end of verses. Soon the key changes to a deeper, resolved melody supporting, ""No, I don't even care"" and non-verbal, sustained vocal coos until the close. The effect is still frustratingly understated, like one musician was sick and couldn't make it to the studio (there is no bass player in the band-- that might be it).</p><p>
    With ""A Pirate's Anthem"" and ""Our Mouths Were Wet"" the group betrays their strange and maybe unconscious affinity for Modest Mouse: The rangy, whiny electric guitars of MM's early career and the sweetened electronics of their latest stuff both appear on ""Our Mouths"". The plodding rhythm of ""Anthem"" is peppered with cymbals plowed too quietly, a less rambunctious version of a <em>We Were Dead...</em> track. The moments of mediocre vocals and delicate piano rounds-- the heaviest, fullest moments-- stand up, because just as their debut album, ONOM's strongest expressions are the rarest ones; their interest is in scuttling acoustics and post-it sized, private statements, but it's the glimpses of raging passion that are the most riveting. <br/>

    Sam Beam's
    first two full-lengths under the name Iron &amp; Wine were bare-bones, hushed
    affairs full of rich imagery, whispery falsettos, rhythmic finger-picking, and not much else. In the time since, Beam has gradually moved in other directions, expanding his palette on both the excellent <em>Woman King</em>
    EP-- which featured more percussion and fleshed-out arrangements-- and 2005's
    full-band collaboration with Calexico, <em>In the Reins</em>.</p><p>
    Beam has also toured with a group of musicians for some time now, so
    it makes sense that his new album would complete his gradual journey away from lo-fi home recordings. The album even
    teases you at its start-- it begins with a snatch of scratchy black-and-white guitar and
    percussion before jumping to Technicolor when the bass and drums dive in. The rest of opener ""Pagan
    Angel and a Borrowed Car"" is surprising as well, at once sleek and full of clattering Americana
    signifiers like steel guitar, acoustic slide guitar, and tack piano.</p><p>
    Despite these new sounds, the core of Iron &amp; Wine
    remains Beam's voice, guitar, and songwriting, which is still more suggestive
    than concrete, and is built mostly around strophic verse/verse/verse forms rather than leaning on choruses. Beam
    and producer Brian Deck deftly build on that foundation, venturing into dub,
    blues, and West African music (among other styles), creating a series of
    interstitial passages that cushion the transitions between songs. Beam also
    experiments with his voice, layering himself heavily on several songs.
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps the most stunning arrangement is the West African
    juju casting of ""House by the Sea"", which builds from an abstract soundscape into a
    snaky groove led by a frenetic bass and a strangely employed baritone sax.
    Guitars dance atop the rhythm as Beam harmonizes with his sister Sarah on the
    chorus-- one of the few on the album. The album's foray into dub
    and reggae, ""Wolves (Song of the Shepherd's Dog)"", could have been a disaster if
    it hadn't been done so subtly, with an ear toward the musical elements that
    define reggae rather than the sonic character that defines it-- it's not a
    pastiche or a genre exercise in the least.
    </p>
<p>
    For an Iron &amp; Wine album, <em>The Shepherd's Dog </em>is so varied that it takes several listens for
    everything to fully sink in, but the individual details-- such as the dramatic steel guitar at the end of ""Love Song of the Buzzard"" or the cascade of banjo in
    the middle of ""Innocent Bones""-- are nearly as rewarding as the overall sound of
    the album. The sequencing is also well-considered, setting contrasting songs
    against each other and ending on the stunning and starkly emotional ""Flightless
    Bird, American Mouth"". The vocal harmony as it rises into the chorus is
    shiver-inducing, and the song finally delivers the sense of resolution that
    much of the album purposely holds back. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Shepherd's Dog</em>
    is Iron &amp; Wine's most diverse and progressive album yet, a deft transition to a very
    different sound that explores new territory while preserving the best aspects of Beam's earlier
    recordings. It's the kind of record that just keeps pulling you back with
    its dreamlike flow and attention to detail: The first time I listened to it, I played it straight though again
    when it ended, and I can't think of a higher compliment than that.

    In 2006, Two Gallants caught a load of shit for re-appropriating ""Long Summer Day"", an impassioned work-song likely hollered by Texas slaves in the early 20th century and ultimately anthologized in the late 1950s by famed folklorist Alan Lomax. Nothing on the duo's third full-length is as overtly controversial, but there's still plenty of righteous anger. Vocalist/guitarist Adam Stephens' lyrics are ambitious, heady, and riddled with histrionics: Check his earnest references to self-crucifixion, face- and eye-clawing, broken hearts, exploding beauty, tears, drinking, dreams, ""boys like me,"" and, in true emo fashion, dangerous girls: In ""Despite What You've Been Told"", Stephens perversely declares, ""I should set the steel trap of your thighs/ And dive right in.""</p><p>
    Emo's casual, inadvertent misogyny is well-documented, but Stephens' desperate screeds aren't so much hazardous to women as they are self-flagellating. On paper, <em>Two Gallants</em> is a breakup record of epic proportions, a collection of folk-rock songs exploring the awkward, agonizing aftermath of failed love. It's hard not to cringe when Stephens caws things like, ""I'm just as full of hate as I used to be/ But in the hour of my demise/ I'll recall your empty eyes/ You know I died the day you set me free""-- although, truth be told, these are the exact sorts of overblown proclamations that make perfect, stupid sense when you're on the business end of a relationship-ending chat.</p><p>
    The sprightly ""Miss Meri"" indicts grand American hubris, with Stephens spitting caustic barbs (""Same old story, blood, sweat, glory... So-called country men who bless this stolen ground"") before chomping down on a harmonica, the classic vehicle for working-class, campfire laments. For the most part, ""Miss Meri"" summarizes Two Gallants' general approach to music-making: Stephens (oddly credited as Adam Brinkman Stephens Fontaine) bellows impassioned screeds while partner and childhood pal Tyson Vogel (see also: Tyson Dillingham Corvidae) beats perfect rhythms on his drum kit, solemn, intense, and impossibly strident.</p><p>
    Musically, <em>Two Gallants</em> offers the same blend of pseudo-Americana the band built its reputation on: a grainy mix of classic blues, folk, and electric guitar. Vocals are mixed high and loud, and Stephens' caterwauls are the most prominent sound here. Opener ""The Deader"" sees Stephens shouting over curly guitar and some unexpected rhythms; ""Despite What You've Been Told"" is so comparably spare that it almost feels a capella. There's a certain vocal cadence inherent to the genre that can start to feel awfully repetitive over the course of a full-length LP-- the lyrics never stop, and words keep piling up on top of each other, barely punctuated by instrumentation. The bitterness doesn't help: On ""Reflections of the Marionette"", Stephens declares, ""I don't want to see you fall/ I just want to see you fail,"" before continuing to chastise his unnamed nemesis for invading his hometown. It's tempting to write Stephens off as self-obsessed (which, in all fairness, places him in a long line of beloved singer-songwriters, from Bob Dylan on), but nonetheless, there are some compelling melodies here and more than enough commitment.

    The novelist Oakley Hall's American West was even more imagined, as in made-up, than Cormac McCarthy's-- go figure that he was the runner-up for the Pulitzer that McCarthy eventually won. But while McCarthy sat like a gentleman and endured Oprah's attentions on national television, he also made sure to tell her that back home in New Mexico, he doesn't deal much with other writers. Contrast that to the California-dwelling Hall, whose cosmopolitan sideline as a writer's writer and inspiration to famous recluse Thomas Pynchon makes him a regular Eli Cash. Which is to say that Oakley Hall the band choose their namesake wisely, picking the guy who figured out how to be plausibly sophisticated and wild bunch at the same time, even when it cost him plaudits on both ends.</p><p>
    The band's pedigree as Southern refugees is more convincing than most give them credit for, and anyone around New York probably knows by now that they fit in pretty well here, too. Lead guy Pat Sullivan founded the Brooklyn institution Oneida and then left, he says, in part because ""Without me, they were able to streamline and get ferocious."" <em>I'll Follow You</em> is Oakley Hall's fourth LP in three years. Their underpublicized days as an occasional ""rough-around-the-edges honky-tonk band"" that played weddings for cash are behind them, but it's stuff like those gigs that lets you know these guys may be many things, but they're not vain.</p><p>
    Another thing they're not is hippies, especially now that they've throttled out the last of the Oneida jamming sprawl. They may do long hair and peasant blouses and sundresses, but their sound is as much Carter Family as it is Allman Brothers (who weren't hippies either, right?). <em>I'll Follow You</em> certainly has its share of ""the blues,"" the blues as an anesthetized trope that stands for melancholy and dust and unembarrassed hollering, rather than the kind of blues with a rhythm section and life experience and a really murderous sadness.
    </p>
<p>
    For instance: ""Rue the Blues"" is easily the most euphoric thing here, with that banjo-tuned-guitar, um, pickin' up a storm, I guess, and Sullivan opening his throat when he sings. One thing about not being embarrassed about who you are or where you're from is that your band can rev up a track like this one, complete with a Steve Miller Band turnaround three-quarters in, and not be tempted to somehow hide the fact when it comes time to record. Conversely, there may be a time or two where you forget to write an actual song and don't even realize it, like with ""First Frost"", a lap-steel ballad whose conceit is that fall is here and the seasons are changing and the grass isn't really green anymore and you could generally get the idea from the title and seconds one through five.
    </p>
<p>
    One way Oneida seems to have shaped this band, though it took a while, is in how seriously they take not just their harmonies and their drum synchonicities, but the guitar playing too. Besides ""Rue the Blues"", ""Alive Among Thieves"", ""Rogue Revelator"", and ""No Dreams"" all make surprisingly fierce riff showdowns, and if the vocal hooks on ""Best of Luck"" and ""Marine Life"" are Hicksville corny, they're also undeniable. One gets the sense that there will come a time when Oakley Hall will become so different from every other band in New York that they might start feeling alone, what with the virtuosity combined with the earnestness and the obliviousness, all appealing qualities on their own that together can feel-- for someone used to being pitched a bit more-- a bit like they've already left. 
    </p>
<p>
    Which is to say they could actually get a job out there in the country that they came from, playing what would probably be a pretty big stage to people nowhere near their age. Why they don't is a different story. Maybe people around here love it a bit less but could use it a bit more, since Oakley Hall are the only ones doing what they do in New York who are any good at it.<br/>

Their previous albums evoked Max Richter: Pianos dominated, but a broader instrumental palette comprised a sparkling exterior. Last year's <em>Feelings for Something</em> <em>Lost</em> was entrancingly murky, like a scene reflected in a mirror coming unsilvered.</p><p>
<em>Höstluft </em>resides in that same dim glass, but after the departure of bandmate Per Jardsell, David Wenngren chose not to fill in the empty spaces, and his first solo effort as Library Tapes is even more spectral than the collaborative efforts. Comprised solely of piano and scratchy field recordings, <em>Höstluft</em>'s ghostly themes emerge glittering from clouds of roughhewn texture, cycle tenuously for awhile, and then either peter out abruptly or slip back into the haze. The album's fluid, rudimentary nature imbues it with an eternal quality: Wenngren stays hard on the damper pedal to attain a consistently lulling, legato purr.</p><p>
    The presence of Philip Glass seems writ large in the record, but influence travels in mysterious ways. In a brief email exchange, Wenngren intimated to me that he wasn't overly familiar with the composer. But Eluvium, a mainstay in Library Tapes's RIYL line, is heavily indebted to Glass: ""Prelude for Time Feelers"", from his latest album, <em>Copia</em>, unambiguously cribs its yearning theme from ""Mad Rush"". <em>Höstluft</em>'s repetitive etudes, lacking horns and strings, actually resemble Glass's piano music more closely than Eluvium's homage does, although they favor blunt simplicity over subtle shading. And while even Glass's most retiring music has a sweeping quality, Library Tapes is resolutely ethereal, enticing the listener to lean in. This contrasting affinity is especially apparent in the conch shell whorls of tracks like ""Skiss Av Träd"" and ""Dis/Dagg/Dimma"".
    </p><p>
<em>Höstluft</em>'s starkness reveals nuances that create affinities with diverse piano works from diverse ages. The bright star-cracks of ""Noslipós"", once they resolve from a chattering overture, sound like a John Cage sonata for prepared piano glinting through a veil of resonance. The album largely favors the cantabile melodies of Romantic-era nocturnes, a style Erik Satie adapted for his <em>Gymnopédies</em>, and Wenngren's fleshier tracks, like ""Repor"" and ""Skiss Av Löv"", capture that same expressive, vanishing quality in less meandering, more forthright lines. The glistering waves of ""Mellan Ljud Och Text"" and the title track resemble a Glassian, truncated take on Morton Feldman's <em>Triadic Memories</em>, with those long tones condensed and wreathed in an armature of rhythmic clicks. <em>Höstluft</em>'s raw simplicity is its most enticing aspect, and its densely textural atmospheric effects might afford listeners who usually can't find purchase in minimal piano music's glassy surfaces an access point into the genre. 
    </p>
<p>
    More complex composition creates a buffer between music and the raw stuff of sound. Digital editing technology, when it's used to eradicate slippage, widens the disconnect between the sounds we hear and the people who intoned them. This isn't to denigrate either idiom, but to demonstrate how <em>Höstluft</em> operates differently. It draws us into a barely-mediated awareness of the presence of the musician, his fingers pressing palpably onto ivory keys, and it accentuates the sheer materiality of the piano: A humming resonance machine. More than any other instrument, the piano sounds like a leap of faith, something impossibly bulky lifting off arduously, but feather-light in the air, spanning the chasm between silences as if suspended by its own purling tones. The only way to get closer to the piano's essence than listening to <em>Höstluft </em>is to sit down at one yourself.

As punishment, I'd sentence Ferguson to a lifetime of forging emo albums out of the gooiest of sentimentalities, but the dude's beat me to it. Straddling the mall-punk tangent that plagued No Knife's later material, Ferguson aims higher on the pop charts than ever with <em>Help</em>, a soft-rock debut as meek and unctuous as its title suggests.</p><p>
    Saddest part of this debacle is, Ferguson, like the rest of his ex-No Knife mates, can pack a Cuomo's worth of hooks in a aptly composed song; though lately, like Rivers, he's been using his powers for evil, not good. Combining the superbad geek catchiness of all those mid-90s Weezer wannabes (Superdrag and Harvey Danger especially come to mind) with the mawkish, Claritin-deprived whine of this decade's emo, Ferguson's simultaneously weeping and pissing on No Knife's grave. For example, ""Must Be Friday Night"" would likely evoke, in No Knife's heyday, inebriated brawls or at least some sardonic social commentary. Instead, Ferguson croons ""I'm alone in my room/ So it must be Friday night,"" and somewhere in the world a keg-hugging frat guy glances up from the tap and sheds a lone tear.</p><p>
    For a few brief snippets, Ferguson pays his respects to some semblance of indie rock. Opener ""Remission"" summons the kind of life-affirming choral tidal wave Broken Social Scene's Kevin Drew makes his career out of, and the curious line ""So we take the knife/ And cut away pieces that don't seem right"" stirs up some nasty gossip around No Knife's breakup. In other instances, like the Gatling gun snare during the verse of ""X's and O's"" or the faux-Specter girth of the Brian Wilson-esque ""In the Sea"", interesting ideas pop up but quickly get trounced by heavy-handed choruses or unwarranted dashboard confessionals.</p><p>
    Dismissing Ferguson as a total hack, while tempting during the throes of ""The Imposter""'s or ""Not On My Watch""'s sob sessions, would do his songwriting a disservice. Taste's the bane here, not talent. You can easily read Ferguson's opportunism on ""Introduction"" when his aggressive post-punk strumming abruptly switches to sweet nothings: ""A fading photograph of her face/ Takes me to the safest place."" I'm not surprised then that ""Suddenly,"" from Ferguson's debut EP <em>Three, Four</em>, earned a spot on the soundtrack of <em>The Sims 2</em>. Like a cruel Sims user, Ferguson's mastered the songwriting game enough to balance the various elements on his palette and make people happy, but instead he chooses to drain our morale meters with, in <em>Help</em>'s case, unmitigated histrionics and Top 40 posturing.</p></div>"|10683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10683-only-trying-to-help/|2.8|Adam Moerder

    Harvey's 15-year career it's that she seems uncomfortable in her own skin--
    which may explain why she sheds it so often. Harvey has a penchant for
    self-correction, to an almost compulsive degree: After <em>To Bring You My Love</em>
    made her a marquee act, Harvey released the dark, more atmospheric <em>Is This Desire?</em> When her 2000 album <em>Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea</em> accidentally captured the
    tenor of the times (its songs had an eerily prescient
    relationship to post-9/11 paranoia), Harvey responded with the stripped-down and
    studiously raw <em>Uh Huh Her</em>.<span></span> In recent years, reports even swirled that Harvey was considering retiring,
    and in at least one regard she temporarily has: <em>White Chalk</em>-- Harvey's most radical
    self-correction to date-- finds her setting aside the
    guitar and the blues touches that marked past releases in favor of chamber-gloom, a ghostly piano her tool of choice.</p><p>
    In <em>Uh Huh Her</em>'s liner notes, there's a scribbled note from Harvey which
    reads, ""TOO NORMAL? <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""text-decoration: underline"">TOO P J H</span>?"" On <em>White Chalk</em>, there might be more Polly Jean Harvey than we've ever heard before-- if not quite enough of what traditionally falls under the ""PJ Harvey"" moniker. One problem is that Harvey isn't nearly as creative a pianist as she is a
    guitarist. However, the
    instrument switch has forced her to alter the way she composes as
    well as the way she sings. From<span> </span>opener ""The Devil"" on down, she's singing almost exclusively near
    the top of her range, using the piano as much as for percussion as melody. There are very few distracting trills on ""Dear
    Darkness"" or ""Grow Grow Grow"", where every note rings with
    loneliness, and the simple repetitive pattern that gently drives ""When Under
    Ether"" drips with menace.</p><p>
    The rest of the album's instrumentation is equally spare and
    strictly old-fashioned, with such mood-setters as broken harp fleshing
    out (ahem) ""Broken Harp""; when some (fake)
    brass enters the song, it's somber and subdued. Even the
    scant use of drums is largely intended to accent the songs. While there's probably more
    room than usual for Jim White, only ""The Piano"" finds him playing
    with any force.
    </p><p>
    Lyrically, <em>White Chalk</em> is oppressively bleak. Harvey's songs never seem as if they come
    easily; they instead sound like the product of much effort, rigor,
    and even some pain. Her music is so raw it's a far cry from fun,
    even when she's trying to be funny; when she commanded
    Robert De
    Niro to ""sit on my face"" in 1993's ""Reeling"", she made it sound part
    dare, part threat. But there are no chuckles to be had on <em>White Chalk</em>, which
    is dark and austere, the songs striking an uneasy balance between
    indulgence and confrontation.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite the presence of regular collaborators John Parish, Captain Beefheart alum Eric Drew Feldman,  and producer Flood, <em>White Chalk</em> sounds as lonely and isolated as any album Harvey has made. There is a rich history of depressing British
    folk that Harvey taps into here, but without a hint of catharsis, much of <em>White Chalk</em>'s miserablism just hangs in
    the air like a noose. On the
    right day, at the right time, the album's powerfully claustrophobic intimacy is more
    palatable; on the wrong day, at the wrong time, in the wrong
    frame of mind, <em>White Chalk</em> may be the longest half-hour in the world.

    The good news for Iceland's Múm is that they sound noticeably different on <em>Go Go Smear the Poison Ivy</em>, their first album following the departure of founding member and vocalist Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir. Earlier this year, we heard her one-of-a-kind voice moving backwards in collaboration with her husband, Avey Tare of Animal Collective, on the tape-direction experiment <em>Pullhair Rubeye</em>. Now her former band returns, with several members of the now seven-strong band pitching in vocals, including male leads for the first time. The bad news is that, despite some encouraging changes, the band seems to be struggling to find a fresh point of view to go with their new line-up.</p><p>
    Múm still have a way with texture. The 95-second confection ""Rhuubarbidoo"" nicely blends horns and melodica with synthesized music box sounds. Strings and harp give ""Marmalade Fires"" a regal cast. ""Winter (What We Never Were After All)"" is close to Enya-style ethereality, with a small chorus of vocals singing wordlessly over a steady throb of distortion and light-streaked drone. To those who have followed the band's career from the beginning, <em>Go Go</em> continues to explore their distinctive sound world and finds (somewhat) interesting ways to integrate traditional instruments with electronics.</p><p>
    The best example of this comes with ""Dancing Behind My Eyelids"", released as a single earlier this year, which opens with a subtle synth pattern that combines percolating, underwater-sounding bass tones with a slight twinkle of bells. It's an instantly effective set-up reminiscent of their first album <em>Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Was OK</em>, on which they managed to evoke a tangible sense of place on almost every track. When percussion and accordion fall in and the tempo increases, we find ourselves inside what is probably the best ""pop tune"" (though only of a sort) the band has written. The song has an appealingly dramatic sweep and delivers on the electronic folk ambitions they've hinted at from the beginning-- and best of all, the vocals even exist in service of the track. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""They Made Frogs Smoke 'Til They Exploded"" is another effective hybrid, with its intentionally awkward, tumbling drum programming, blasts of harmonica, wordless kiddie vocals, and bright, 8-bit synths. Elsewhere, we hear bits of the currently fashionable Eastern European influence, perhaps carried over from the Storsveit Nix Noltes project, an Icelandic collective paying tribute to the music of Bulgaria that includes members of Múm. 
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, the advance songs we heard from <em>Go Go</em> are probably the two best tracks here. But while this is certainly not a great record, it probably has broader appeal. The last two Múm full-lengths seemed bent on a return to the womb through cloying titles (""The Island of Children's Children"", ""Don't Be Afraid, You Have Just Got Your Eyes Closed"") and Valtýsdóttir's baby-like coo. The band didn't just reference the concerns of early childhood, they longed to inhabit them, to make the music sound like it came from that pre-pubescent place. While the lyrical concerns haven't really changed here, they come at them with an appealing sense of distance, allowing an easier ""in,"" for whatever that's worth.

The brainchild of London's spectacularly named Markland Starkie, Sleeping States' debut LP is packed with gentle, lapping compositions (most comprised of electric guitar and sugary vocals, exclusively) that tend to come off nauseatingly bucolic on paper. But Starkie's lilting electric folksongs are just as indebted to <em>Metal Machine Music</em> as they are the Carter Family, and <em>There the Open Spaces</em> is peppered with just enough sour notes, off-tuned guitars, and atonal skronks to keep listeners fully agitated and engaged.</p><p>
    Plenty have speculated that <em>There the Open Spaces</em> is very much a record about shacking up in London, and, accordingly, focuses on the claustrophobia, disassociation, and loneliness inherent to urban living.  It seems plausible: Musically, Starkie favors spare, ghostly sounds, and his electric guitar work feels sticky, soft, and unsettling, like stepping face-first into a spider web. Lyrically, Starkie doesn't make definitive claims either way, but the record's cool, slightly unhinged atmospherics will make perfect, eerie sense to anyone who's ever felt trapped by skyscrapers, concrete, and hoards of human beings.</p><p>
    Opener ""Rain Check""-- a fey, a capella ditty with doubled (and tripled and quadrupled) vocals and limited lyrics (""When I'm getting ready/ In spite of the rain/ You sometimes ring me up and say/ Another time"")-- is pleasant enough, but ultimately feels like a bit of a false start. ""Rivers"", first released as a Tome 7"" in 2006, is a far more suitable introduction to Sleeping States' particular sound, with its flurry of nonsensical blipping and rolling guitar. ""I Wonder"", which Caspian released as a 7"" earlier this summer, is one of the record's most addictive (and straightforward) cuts, a spinning mess of guitar and smooth vocals. The record finishes with ""Life vs. Love"", a grim, droning lament accented by the slightest hint of found sound. </p><p>
    From the confessional poets through Joan Baez, the notion of the singer-songwriter as a self-indulgent whiner has endured, and plenty-- like Starkie-- are making huge strides to reinvent the idea of the bedroom poet with a guitar: <em>There the Open Spaces</em> is an impressive start.</p></div>"|10666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10666-there-the-open-spaces/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

    acts Lil' Fighters, the Totallys, and Brute Force. Emily Manzo graduated from
    Oberlin Conservatory of Music, has worked with numerous composers and artists,
    and teaches piano. Like the Wonder Twins or a Reeses peanut butter cup, theirs
    is an interesting partnership for the strikingly different abilities and
    musical flavors these two multi-instrumentalists bring to the studio and stage.
    <em>Gueen's Head</em>, the product of their
    work, isn't just ""rock"" versus ""classical,"" but interpretive versus
    creative, mood versus hook, song versus sound.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The album sounds like indie pared down to its DIY basics:
    eight patiently paced songs creating a rainy-day minimalism. On opener ""Ocean"",
    Emily's keys swirl against Christy's guitar until the two intertwine so closely
    they sound inseparable. The music swells and fades gently, as if mimicking the
    motion of its title, until it morphs into a new song altogether. It's a neat
    trick, but the lyrics detract from the effect. No matter how many times they
    sing ""Whoa the ocean"" in the first half, it never becomes much of a hook, and
    the theme of the second half-- ""I'd rather steal/ I'd rather steal/ Than go
    back to you/ Go back to you""-- never comes across as the monumental cry of
    defiance it's meant to be.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    That problem extends to the seven tracks that follow: The
    music is usually interesting, the lyrics rarely so, as if the songs need the
    justification of words to exist. Often the lyrics veer toward cliché, as on
    ""Signs"": ""I am waiting for a sign/ I will know when I see it."" Still, the banality
    of these lines makes them easy to ignore or tune out, especially when Christy
    and Emily's voices blend beautifully. Christy typically takes lead, but Emily
    haunts the background, echoing and reinforcing her partner's declarations. On
    ""Noah"", the voices become indistinguishable from the atmospheric drone of
    guitar and synths, but the effect is purely aural, not lyrical.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Christy &amp; Emily is largely a musical project, an outlet
    for the duo's sound ideas rather than their songwriting, so the best songs on <em>Gueen's Head</em> are those that emphasize their
    musical resourcefulness. ""Island Song"", the album's most surprising departure,
    drifts along on a scratchy samba beat that sounds like someone's mental
    postcard of a long-ago getaway. On closer ""Birds"", Emily's piano mimics the
    flight of birds, ascending and descending suddenly, making the keyboard swoop
    across Christy's vocals and earthy guitar. It's the fullest-sounding track on <em>Gueen's Head</em>, with a sublminal bassline
    and a very shallow depth-of-field that makes the instruments sound like they're
    constantly going in and out of focus. It's a strong end to a musical novella
    that never quite fulfills the promise of this intriguing pairing.

    Joe Henry has a love/hate relationship with traditional American music. He started his career as an alt-country troubadour, akin to his cohorts the Jayhawks, but turned away from the movement just as it was gaining steam. While countless other artists began exploring their inner twang, Henry started releasing strange and atmospheric albums like <em>Trampoline</em> and <em>Fuse</em>, discs more likely to nod to Sly Stone than bow at the throne of Gram Parsons. Before getting the boot from his longtime major label home, he even managed to lure no less than Ornette Coleman in for a cameo, appropriate enough for a songwriter whose music has as much in common with jazz as it does with rock or folk.</p><p>
    Yet at the same time, Henry's love of traditional American music seemed to flourish. Between producing records for peers such as Aimee Mann and Ani DiFranco, Henry helmed comeback discs for Solomon Burke and Bettye LaVette, splitting the difference with Elvis Costello's <em>The River in Reverse</em>, which featured Costello paired with Allen Toussaint (himself a vet of the soul supergroup Henry assembled for 2005's <em>I Believe to My Soul</em>). Around the time Henry released his 2003 disc <em>Tiny Voices</em>, he told me one of his dream collaborators was Dr. Dre.</p><p>
    It's four years later, so where does Joe Henry fit today? Apparently in a kind of introspective, back-to-basics frame of mind. There are no horns and few outré flourishes on <em>Civilians</em>, not that Henry's all alone, left to deal with those ghosts and demons alone. He's surrounded himself with a cadre of capable studio hands, including such usual unusual suspects as guitarist Bill Frisell and Van Dyke Parks as well as old friends Patrick Warren, Greg Leisz and drummer Jay Bellerose. The result is Henry's most ""traditional"" album in years, at least in the words-and-music-come-first sense. It's also, unfortunately, a bit dull, like a cross between current Tom Waits and Bob Dylan without that ineffable quality that makes even their clichés so compelling.
    </p>
<p>
    That's not to say Henry hasn't left some room to play with that relationship between words and music. ""Loose lips, desperation and convenient morality might make for tense dinner conversation, but put them in waltz time and even the young people lay down their assault rifles and start crowding up next to the stage,"" he writes in the notes, and he makes a good point. Lyrically, <em>Civilians</em> finds Joe Henry at his poetic best, his words the stuff of hardboiled fiction, the Beats, and the heart. Stick with them, and he takes you on an evocative trip down (bad) memory lane.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Every truth carries blame/ And every light reveals some shame/ Progress rides with thieves and whores/ The stowaways of civil war,"" he sings in ""Civil War"", an oblique take on domestic conflict (and indeed a sort-of waltz). ""God is in the details/ Of the smoke in the air/ The devil, he's a pauper prince/ Nesting in your hair,"" goes another bit in ""Parker's Mood"".
    </p>
<p>
    Indeed, God is in the details, literally, as the Almighty makes at least a passing appearance in just about every <em>Civilians</em> track. But God in this context is little more than a cipher, a passive presence. It's something else that seems to be compelling Henry to create in the face of the hopelessness that surrounds around him. ""I turn my face from all the rage/ Playing on the grim, dark stage/ But you've shown me an open page,"" he sings in ""I Will Write My Book"", and while he could be singing about divine intervention as inspiration, it sounds more like Henry is singing about a connection made with an actual corporeal human being when all the forces of the world are conspiring to draw us apart.
    </p>
<p>
    It's on this note that <em>Civilians</em> falters. The sound is as warm and rich as could be expected from a craftsman of this caliber-- David Piltch's upright bass tone alone should be bottled and sold to the highest bidder-- but musically and melodically <em>Civilians</em> falls short of making much of a connection itself. There's real weight (and when need be, weightlessness) to Henry's lyrics, but wait as you might for some force to back it up, the disc never dislodges from its doggedly midtempo (and slower) groove and oppressively dour vibe. It's all sparks, shooting up and out into the night sky, but no fire.

After all, it's easy enough to make an iTunes playlist of a record's best songs, right? So I don't get it when people call Devendra Banhart's albums too long. Not only is that problem easy to rectify, but his rambling style needs room to breathe, and space to wander toward its inspirations. Banhart's valleys have rarely diminished his peaks, and often provided ramps to them.</p><p>
    But after spending time with the 16-track, 66-minute <em>Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon</em>, I'm starting to understand. It's not so much that the quality varies, but that a bloated, lethargic feel permeates the record. Banhart has too much skill and creativity not to hit on something good when given 16 chances to do so. But in the context of the album, even the best pieces sag, bathed in a blurry haze that bleeds over from other songs. And it's hard to shake the feeling that the highlights would've been brighter given the extra time and attention they were deprived of by the lows.</p><p>
    The easiest fix would have been for Banhart to restrict his tiresome love of genres. This cloying infatuation pops up on all of his albums, but he usually keeps it to a minimum, and often tweaks the clichés of the styles he apes. But more than one-third of <em>Smokey</em> consists of indistinct genre exercises. There's a flat Samba piece (""Samba Vexillographica""), a middling Reggae jaunt (""The Other Woman""), a weak Motown rip (""Lover""), and a sub-Santana Spanish rocker (""Carmencita""). Worst of all is ""Shabop Shalom"", a Jewish love song done in doo-wop style and filled with painful couplets (""When I'm ever in a foul mood/ I've gotta see you in your Talmud""). Banhart labors to distinguish these tunes with his stellar voice, but they remain stubbornly forgettable. Only ""Seahorse"", a classic-rock epic that's sort of Banhart's ""Layla"", rises far above mimicry, but even it doesn't make any moves that you can't see coming.</p><p>
<em>Smokey</em> does have a handful of songs that capture Banhart's idiosyncratic mix of odd folk and warbling emotion. For the most part, this happens when he keeps things simple: Opener ""Cristobal"" is a modest tune with a worm-like melody, while ""Tonada Yanomaminista"" is energetic and sharp, practically caffeinated compared to the sluggishness around it. Even better is ""Bad Girl"", whose gentleness is hypnotic rather than sleepy, much the way the slower shuffles on Stephen Malkmus' solo albums find tension in patient strolls. Over small slide guitar and pitter-pat percussion, Banhart's tale of romantic ambivalence is achingly pretty. </p><p>
    Similar simplicity bolsters the album's end. The Gordon Lightfoot-esque soft rocker ""Freely"" benefits from a nice Banhart vocal turn, while the wistful piano and voice of ""I Remember"" feels like an update of ""Autumn's Child"" from 2004's <em>Rejoicing in the Hands</em>. Best is the final cut, ""My Dearest Friend."" As Banhart bemoans how he will ""die from loneliness,"" the track does the opposite, gaining strength from its unadorned setting and lack of heavy effects, indulgent flourishes, or winking genre baggage. It's a strong way to close <em>Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon</em>, but an even stronger reminder of how much better Banhart can be.</p></div>"|10687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10687-smokey-rolls-down-thunder-canyon/|6.5|Marc Masters

    San Francisco is one of the
    few truly unique cities in the United
    States. It could not possibly be
    mistaken for another city, and its position on the West Coast at the dramatic
    mouth of a bay gives it an aura unlike any other place I've been. Its hilly
    topography alone sets it apart, but from its roots as a Spanish mission to the
    boom of the Gold Rush, right through the mid-20th century San
    Francisco Renaissance and 1967's Summer of Love, the city has attracted a mix
    of people that's kept alive a certain frontier spirit that persisted long after
    it became one of the country's largest urban centers.</p><p>
    When youth counterculture rose into the mainstream and popular
    music expanded into previously unimagined realms in the latter half of the 60s,
    San Francisco
    was undeniably one of the most important epicenters of change. The city's
    history with the Renaissance poets, the Beats, and a vibrant folk scene left it
    in a good position to serve as a cultural engine, and the ignition of the San
    Francisco Sound came from dozens of sources, from Bob Dylan, Paul Butterfield,
    and the British Invasion to UC-Berkeley's 1964 Free Speech Movement, the
    evolution of freeform FM radio, and the proliferation of hallucinogenic drugs. By
    1967, San Francisco was the most psychedelic
    city in America,
    if not the world.</p><p>
    The word ""psychedelic"" was first coined in 1957 by British
    psychiatrist Humphry Osmond, but it was popularized by Timothy Leary, the
    legendary acid guru who did most of his research on psychotropic drugs at
    Harvard but chose San Francisco's
    January 1967 Human Be-In gathering to first issue his exhortation to ""Turn
    on, tune in, drop out."" Amusingly, given San Francisco's
    association with drugs, hippies, and flower children, the original name for the
    city that grew up outside the San
    Francisco mission was Yerba Buena, literally Spanish for ""Good
    Grass."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Rhino's fourth 4xCD <em>Nuggets</em>
    compilation steps laterally away from the focus of previous volumes-- on
    two-to-three-minute blasts of fuzzy pop and obscure singles-- to
    build a panoramic picture of what was happening in Bay Area rock music between
    1965 and 1970. The set's own lavishly illustrated and beautifully printed<span style=""background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; font-size: 12pt""></span> liner notes take pains to emphasize that this
    isn't a genre excavation so much as it is a musical examination of a
    particularly volatile point in space-time. The tracklisting includes transplants
    like Steve Miller and bands from around the Bay, showcasing bubblegum,
    folk-rock, proto-metal, Latin funk-rock, garage fuzz, and acid-damaged novelties
    alongside San Fran staples the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, the
    Charlatans, Moby Grape, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not all of the music exactly qualifies as obscure,
    either-- I'd guess nearly everyone reading this has heard Jefferson Airplane's
    ""White Rabbit"", Santana's ""Soul Sacrifice"" and ""Evil Ways"", Janis Joplin's
    ""Mercedes Benz"" and Blue Cheer's cover of ""Summertime Blues"". Context seems to be a
    leading motive for including these, but they could as easily have been swapped
    for other rarities. Each disc has a theme: <em>Seismic
    Rumbles</em>, <em>Suburbia</em>, <em>Summer of Love,</em> and <em>The Man Can't Bust Our Music</em>, and each tackles a slightly different
    aspect of what made the Bay Area music scene so special. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Seismic Rumbles</em>
    chronicles the transition from the folk scene to the first flashes of
    psychedelia, which largely began when Dylan went electric at Newport and convinced guys who'd been playing
    in old-time jug bands that electric guitars were okay. Six of the disc's 21 songs were produced for Autumn Records by Sly Stewart, who was
    honing his craft while harboring dreams of a multi-racial, multi-gender band
    that could pull together the strands of r&amp;b and rock'n'roll and make
    something new from them.
    </p>
<p>
    Among his productions is ""Can't Come Down"", an early track
    by the Warlocks, soon to become the Grateful Dead, and still very much in a
    blues-rock mode-- it sounds more like John Mayall than ""Uncle John's Band"". Sly
    shows up later on disc three with the Family Stone, railing against racial
    inequality on the funky ""Underdog"", which quotes ""Frere Jacques"" in its horn
    chart as a tribute to brotherhood. The Dead appear two more times, including
    the rarely heard single version of concert staple ""Dark Star"", a jazzy wisp of
    a song that sounds like it was composed as the band played it in the studio.
    </p>
<p>
    Many of the bands featured were inter-related. For instance,
    Grace Slick lent her powerful vocals to both the Great! Society and Jefferson
    Airplane, both of which are featured multiple times. The Society's 1965 original
    version of the massive Airplane hit ""Somebody to Love"" unfortunately turns out
    to be a leaden relic, but their other track, the pounding, raga-inspired ""Free
    Advice"", was ahead of its time and is easily as thrilling in its dissonance as
    Slick belting, ""Feed your head!"" two years later on <em>Surrealistic Pillow</em>. The compilers have elevated Country Joe &amp;
    the Fish to a surprisingly exalted position by including three of their songs,
    including the sound-effects-laden EP version of ""I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die
    Rag"", which became an iconic anti-war song years later when the band
    performed it at Woodstock. Perhaps more intriguing is the inclusion of ""Section
    43"", a fluid, mysterious instrumental that features an early dose of the
    open-ended improvisation that became so important to the San Francisco scene
    later on.
    </p>
<p>
    There was surprisingly little overlap between the scenes in San Francisco proper and
    its many surrounding communities, and as such the <em>Suburbia</em> disc is the only one that features no bands found on other
    discs in the set. It's also one of the most solid discs, with its emphasis on
    tight songs and rough-and-tumble garage rock. Count Five's ""Psychotic Reaction""
    is fantastic, but feels a bit redundant given that it was on the first <em>Nuggets</em> box. Marin County's Front Line
    back vocal harmonies with wild fuzz and organ, while the Sacramento area's Oxford
    Circle check in with the roiling psych-punk nugget ""Foolish Woman"", with
    drummer Paul Whaley slamming away on his toms in preparation for his future
    work with Blue Cheer. The weirdest inclusion is Teddy &amp; His Patches' ""Suzy
    Creamcheese"", a blistering freak-out complete with psychedelic studio effects
    and a cheeseball monologue about ""opening your closed mind"" that was reportedly
    recorded by a bunch of straight-arrow coattail-riders from San Jose. 
    </p>
<p>
    The <em>Summer of Love</em>
    disc zeros in on 1967, the year everything came to a head in San Francisco. It was the year hippiedom went
    national, but it was also the year that largely destroyed the idealistic collectivism
    that permeated San Francisco
    in the mid-60s. The Human Be-In, which attracted 30,000 people to Golden Gate Park in January, stoked optimism that at
    least a portion of society might be on the brink of a truly new way of living.
    In a lot of ways, the dream peaked in June at the Monterey International Pop
    Festival, the first successful outdoor rock festival. But as the summer wore on
    and wannabe hippies from all over the country crowded into the Haight-Ashbury, the situation became untenable. By the
    end of the year, many of the original hippies, disgusted by the dilution of
    what they believed in, had left San Francisco
    for the hills of Northern California. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, plenty of good music poured out of the city amid all
    the chaos. The Charlatans' ""Alabama Bound"" features almost the whole band on
    vocals, and Dan Hicks' drums play in a unique pocket that doesn't rely on any
    kind of conventional beat. The Beau Brummels, once cast as America's answer to
    the Beatles, turn in a sublime bit of pop drama on ""Two Days 'Til Tomorrow"", Moby
    Grape's ""Omaha"" is a small masterpiece of barreling American psych, and
    Quicksilver Messenger Service's cover of Buffy Sainte-Marie's ""Codine"" gives you the
    other side of the drug experience, with David Freiberg's tortured vocal
    slogging through the song's bluesy downer haze. 
    </p>
<p>
    Nothing was ever quite the same after 1967 in San Francisco,
    and it's interesting to note that while music continued to grow in excess and
    ornamentation in many other scenes (for instance in much of Europe, where psychedelia
    gave way to prog), much of the music coming out of San Francisco as the 60s
    wound down was markedly pastoral and unadorned. Improvisation remained a
    central feature, but there's far less open experimentation on the final disc,
    whose title refers to the numerous run-ins with the law members of San Francisco's rock
    royalty had incurred by that point. Among the best finds on the disc is Mother
    Earth's psych-jazz waltz ""Revolution"", which features an excellent, loose horn
    arrangement. 
    </p>
<p>
    The set is bookended by two versions of the same song. At
    the beginning, Dino Valenti's original solo acoustic version of ""Let's Get
    Together"" comes off like a limp Dylan retread with muddled phrasing, but at the
    end, the Youngbloods turn it into a free-flowing anthem for a dying era, a mix
    of weary melancholy and wistful optimism (I learned it growing up from TV ads
    for Time-Life anthologies). By 1970, psychedelia was just about dead in San Francisco, though the
    city has continued to attract people drawn by the allure of the ideas that
    fueled the original Summer of Love. 
    </p>
<p>
    What happened in San
    Francisco in the late 60s was a key piece of the
    development of music as we know it today. The social experiments of the hippies
    largely failed, but the musical experimentation of the period has kept many of
    these songs fresh to this day. The San
    Francisco sound was an important step toward the
    realization that popular music was true art, and for a fleeting moment, arcane
    concepts such as John Cage and Allan Kaprow's ""happenings"" gained real
    macrocultural currency. It's something that will never happen again, and while
    this boxed set isn't definitive, it's incredibly well-designed, full of detailed information and vintage photos, and does a good job of providing a
    highly enjoyable starting point for listeners who'd like to explore further.

That song alone drew me into her last album, <em>The Reminder</em>, and I can't complain too much about the other things I found there. But it still felt a little deflating when I realized that the song that had lured me through was actually written by an artist I was <em>already </em>plenty fascinated by-- Australia's Sally Seltmann, sole proprietor of New Buffalo.</p><p>
    On her previous LP, <em>The Last Beautiful Day</em>, Seltmann's songs were backed by an odd and awfully charming array of sounds: Her own guitar and piano, of course, but also breezy hand percussion and squared-off, minimalist constructions of sampled horns and strings, ghostly in tone and yet endlessly friendly. (Appropriate, given that Seltmann's husband is one of the Avalanches.) Her hit writing for another singer, though, befits the sound of her newest record, which is a lot less finished off. These tend to feel like songs alone, not full-on productions: Mostly Seltmann at the piano, and sometimes at the guitar, and mostly more interested in the drifting multi-track harmonies of her voice than anything else.</p><p>
    Coming from anyone else, parts of it might even feel lazy-- except this kind of intimacy is Seltmann's whole appeal as a songwriter. Here more than ever, she doesn't seem to write the kinds of songs that are built for stages, or grand pronouncements to other people: They're more like the kinds of half-songs that hum through your head while you're walking alone or sitting on park benches or washing dishes. The first track here is called ""Cheer Me Up Thank You"", and has her absently thanking every pretty thing around her for making life nicer. It's not precious, either: She sounds pleased with herself in the good, grateful, generous way, the kind of happy you get when it's nice out, your life is going okay, and you just want to stop and marvel at that for a second. (You can hear that same sly joy in ""1, 2, 3, 4"".) It's not static, either: She sounds sad and amazed at the loss of friends; grand and transported on ""Emotional Champ""; tired and drained on a track called ""I'm the Drunk and You're the Star"".</p><p>
    But as she goes on like that, lolling delicately around the piano, writing these simple, gemlike songs, it becomes clear that this kind of intimacy won't charm everyone. Seltmann's conversational lilt and sigh doesn't have the emotional range to move in many different directions, and the low pulse rate of her songs doesn't make for much tension or release. The production here is polished and airy-- not raw enough to sell her as a lo-fi bedsit genius, nor hazy or abstract enough to come off like an arty dream-world she's inviting you into. And it's inevitable that some will find this sort of thing twee, or <em>too </em>feminine, both of which it isn't.</p><p>
    It's challenging, actually-- ""difficult"" art-- to pull people into songs this <em>close</em>, and her decision to pull harder and further is moving her music in directions that are hard to get from anyone else. There are lots of indie artists who feel cloistered, sealed off in their own worlds, but few of them are offering anything so full of wonder and surprise at the everyday. Seltmann's the most earnestly dreamy balladeer around: If she has an agenda, it would seem to lie in the idea that your private, daily moods and emotions-- hurt feelings, spilled coffee, a nice patch of sun-- are as worthy of tender ballads as any grand plot or crisis. (There's no reason that should be any more ""feminine"" than a short story is, but I suspect it still is.) On her last album, that meant stuff like a song called ""Recovery"", with an upbeat, anthemic chorus that just said ""Recovery/ Looks like it's gonna be/ Okay."" On this one, it involves staring you right in the eyes even more calmly than that, singing lines as great as ""I got myself into this mess/ I chose to wear this stupid dress"".</p></div>"|10647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10647-somewhere-anywhere/|7.7|Nitsuh Abebe

    Bright Eyes mixed with ""Hotel California"" sounds like just about the worst musical combination imaginable, the kind of auditory experience that would have most reasonable people reaching to clean out their ears with an old screwdriver. And yet, Pseudosix tidily merge the role of the mega-vulnerable songwriter with the burned-out, late-night California drive that only a 70s supergroup could've mustered on their latest self-titled record. It shouldn't work, but it does.</p><p>
    The first track, ""Some Sort of Revelation"", plays like a warning: a bit of scorched-earth go-for-broke balladry mixed with the swooning group vocals and out-of-nowhere crescendos that seem so in vogue with indie-rock these days. It ambles and trips over its feet until a few scant moments of unison singing precede a huge climax of voices intoning ""now"", along with some dramatic strings, a cool-down with a little wah-wah, and, I'm pretty sure, wind chimes. If this was the band's only trick, their album wouldn't be half as rewarding as it is.</p><p>
    Quick on the heels of the opening track's droning finale is ""Under the Waves"", an insistent acoustic shuffle. It builds anxiousness with quivering, barely audible strings, before throwing in a sharp guitar lead while the vocals layer and croon with confidence. The guitars interweave over some behind-the-bridge strumming while the drummer speeds up on the brushes, and the sound of the band is almost rivaled by the sound of the room itself, as if the voices and instruments vanish into blackness moments after the sound hits the air. Psuedosix includes members of other Portland bands like the Joggers, the Standard, Grails, and Dolorean, and by all indications, a collaborative group like this should sound like ramshackle Up With People handclappy bullshit; instead they sound like studio musicians here. What do they feed musicians in Portland so they get to have taste and chops?
    </p>
<p>
    That same open space bubbles underneath the deliberate pace and melody of ""Apathy and Excess"" and the lethargic shuffle of ""Waisting Taking Up Space"", and while ""Paltry Remains"" might be the moment where the vocals of mastermind Tim Perry become a bit too much to bear, it's merely a minute-long intro to one of the record's gems. ""Enclave"" isn't just sonically rich, but a deft modernization, with its titular concern as a creepy holdover of the long-abandoned free-love promise that the older bands paid tribute to here preached and saw evaporate. ""Enclave"" pines for the ideal while acknowledging its impossibility; no living situation could be as sweet as those harmonies, those gently suggestive drums, that unaccompanied guitar arpeggio that gets tripled when the whole band comes in. The result is excessive like flourless cake.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Treacherous Ways"" is nearly as strong a band performance, but falls short in much the same way as recent Bright Eyes material-- it's hard to buy the hedonistic, predatory narrator from someone who sounds like they're ready to burst into tears. The record may devolve, in points, to a game of spot-the-influence (""Fight or Flight"" is ""The Beach Boys one""), but it keeps one foot in tradition of the canonized greats while bringing in more conflicted, modern concerns in its lyrics. Yes, it's only a dusting off of convention, but it's amazing what a little open space can do, and how it can remind you how well those conventions worked. You may find yourself reaching for it again and again at the strangest times.

    In ""Ramadan"", the 50th issue of his <em>Sandman</em> comic book series, Neil Gaiman took some liberties with the myth of the phoenix. In cultural variants, the phoenix rises from its own ashes or inters them in an egg of myrrh. But when Gaiman's phoenix dies, it lays two eggs, ""one black, one white: From the white egg hatches the Phoenix-bird itself, when its time is come, but what hatches from the black egg no one knows.""</p><p>
    Now we know: It's a supergroup of sorts, one that leans heavily on the ""doom"" of its roots while forgoing the ""metal."" Performing material written by Electric Wizard drummer Justin Greaves, with Mogwai bassist Dominic Aitchison helping to set the tone, Crippled Black Phoenix has also drawn members of Pantheist, Gonga, and Seattle's 3-D House of Beef under its sooty wing. In Western thought, every concept creates its opposite, and if the phoenix embodies redemption and resurrection, Gaiman's black egg embodies downfall and annihilation. Crippled Black Phoenix's debut album (the first in a planned trilogy) follows suit with a collection of apocalyptic hymns.</p><p>
    There are flashes of salvation: ""The Northern Cobbler"" sets a Tennyson ballad, spoken in its original Lincolnshire dialect, against a languid, optimistic post-rock crescendo. The poem finds an alcoholic cobbler hitting rock bottom, then kicking the bottle and regaining his societal standing. But moments of uplift like this are few and far between, and the bulk of the album is taken up by a lugubrious plod. ""The Northern Cobbler"" also summarizes the ways in which the album doesn't satisfy-- it's an interesting idea that doesn't amount to much musically (the words are all but impossible to discern unless you read along with the original text, although there's some pleasure in the rhythm and texture of the brogue itself), and it's one of many impediments to the album's flow. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>A Love of Shared Disasters</em> is so eclectic that its parts don't cohere into a harmonious sum. There is a dominant mood of macabre gloom, familiar from slow-core depressives like Black Heart Procession, with an instrumental palette heavy on singing saw, vintage harmonium, accordion, strings, woodwinds, and other agents of creaky melancholia. The album is at its best when it plays into it. On opening track ""The Lament of the Nithered Mercenary"", a field of static and a baggy wheeze surround a monastic throat song by Andy Semmens, a droning basso who imbues dirges like this one and ""My Enemies I Fear Not, but Protect Me from My Friends"" with unique gravitas. ""The Whistler"" weaves a harmonic braid around an eerie minor-key theme. ""Long Cold Summer"", with its elongated, ramshackle progression, sounds like a goth Dirty Three. 
    </p>
<p>
    But these superior moments have a tepid overall impact, largely because their cumulative force is blunted by the frequent insertion of songs that neither make sense in context nor impress on their own. Far too many tracks find Gonga's Joe Volk helming anonymous rock-structured songs that sound like a cross between-- I kid you not-- Calla and the Goo-Goo Dolls, derailing the ponderous momentum of the instrumental or Semmens-sung tracks every time. On ""Really, How Did it Get This Way?"", ""Suppose I Told the Truth"", and many others, Volk's generically gritty howl and amorphous acoustic guitar structures render the album's extraterrestrial atmosphere mundane. A supergroup needs to integrate its concerns to stick together, and it sounds like that didn't happen here. <em>A Love of Shared Disasters</em> wants to be two focused albums, a solid Semmens-fronted one and a mediocre Volk-fronted one. It's hard not to feel as if this phoenix crippled itself by shoving them together in one bloated package.

    Since their inception, Akron/Family have seemed to enjoy playing in the shadows, always allowing some personality or characteristic apart from themselves to dominate center stage. As the backing band for Angels of Light, that personality is former Swans frontman Michael Gira; on their own records, it's a variation of folk music and electronics. But <em>Love Is Simple</em>, their latest release on Gira's Young God label, seems designed to change that.</p><p>
    An absurd and occasionally awkward celebration of humanity, love, and the natural world, <em>Love Is Simple</em> is Akron/Family's bold, unvarnished paean to discovering god within nature, through a fusion of drum-circle bliss, religious signifiers, and classic rock. The best introduction to this new style comes four tracks into the record, with the joyous ""I've Got Some Friends"". Initially evoking the Mothers of Invention's <em>We're Only in It for the Money</em> with its unhinged lo-fi folk-rock opening, the song soon segues into a hillbilly country greeting that reflects the album's sunny disposition: ""I've got some friends that you should meet/ But don't go see 'em if you are shy/ 'Cause they are always in embrace beyond propriety.""  The song's second half is notably different, pitching the vocals and guitars to the highest registers, with the result somewhere close to the fantastical prog style of Yes' ""Roundabout"".</p><p>
    The often hammy results of Akron/Family's exploration of unmitigated hippie gaiety is sure to alienate some fans; the vaguely Phishy early cut ""Ed is a Portal"" is the first test for cynics, finding shape in a tribal chant and cyclical
    guitar figure.  The lyrical cadence is more important than their nonsensical content (my search for ""liquidated hydrogen"" returned zero results), but the briefly discernible lyric ""shamanistic Shaker spells"" nicely summarizes what the band is aiming for.  </p><p>
<em>Simple</em> draws largely from late 1960s/early 70s rock, with its most traditionally structured songs owing inspiration to a few of John Lennon's guises. The Mellotron-accompanied ""Don't Be Afraid, You're Already Dead"" contains the ""All You Need Is Love""-style sing-along refrain that gives the record its name, and first single ""Phenomena"" oscillates somewhere between ""Across the Universe"" and <em>Plastic Ono Band</em>'s ""I Found Out"".  Appropriately, the latter's lyrics are a series of enigmatic, most likely meaningless metaphysical paradoxes, like ""Things are not what they seem to be/ Nor are they otherwise.""</p><p>
    The group's bold compositional digressions aren't a total break with its earlier work: Akron/Family are still interested in zig-zagging song structures, it's just that on <em>Simple</em>, they're mural-sized and painted with bold, primary colors. The 15-minute-plus duo of ""Lake Song/New Ceremonial Music for Moms"" and ""There's So Many Colors"" are <em>Simple</em>'s climax, as well as its creative centerpiece.  ""Lake Song""'s eerie, minor-key vocal incantations open with a hazy vibe that gives way to a throbbing, incantatory drum-circle frenzy in the mold of the Boredoms' <em>Vision Creation Newsun</em>.  The chanted first half of ""Colors"" is intermission entertainment, gradually swallowed by a shaggy, threadbare verse and torrential guitar outro somewhere between Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse's <em>Zuma</em> and the fiery denouement of Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Effigy"".
    </p>
<p>
    Akron/Family have stepped into the light for the first time with <em>Love Is Simple</em>, and the results alternate between gawky and deeply enjoyable; the record is bursting at its seams with lovingly and vividly realized ideas culled from a broad selection of prior works.  Whether the band is showing off its self-reflexive genre awareness or just unable to keep its conceptual shit together is unclear-- and also largely unnecessary to consider to enjoy the record, which claims managed disarray as its most prominent and enjoyable trait.   <em>Simple</em>'s greatest success might be that it holds together as a single work despite the general senselessness of its basic narrative.   Don't try to sort it out, just dig it: As the band themselves repeat when trying in song to find a perspectival spot on the horizon: ""No point exists.""

About a half-minute into to <em>Love's Miracle</em> opener ""Apartment"", drummer Paul Christensen begins singing in a simple, full, and tuneful voice, soothing the rapid fire-onslaught conjured by himself and guitarist Matt Cronk. If you're harboring fantasies about Yow's new project returning unchecked violence and grit to indie rock, Qui couldn't have chosen a better way to burst your bubble. But though it's far from the revelatory experience that many hoped it would be, <em>Love's Miracle</em> is a satisfyingly loud, far-flung, and fucked-up record.</p><p>
    To wish for a return of the Jesus Lizard is to sell short both the potential of Yow's new bandmates and the accomplishments of his old ones.  Indeed, the two projects are fundamentally different; while the Jesus Lizard were unnervingly focused, Qui are much more playful and disjointed. ""Gash"", with its spare and screechy guitar lead, is more in line with the work of contemporary noisemongers Lightning Bolt.  The aforementioned ""Apartment"" has all the jerky and repetitive intensity of vintage Don Caballero.  A cover of the Frank Zappa/Captain Beefheart tune ""Willie the Pimp"" is a dead ringer for <em>God Ween Satan</em>-era Ween.<br/>
<em><br/>
    Love's Miracle</em> is Qui's first record with Yow on vocals, and the band still seems to be figuring out how best to incorporate him.  While Yow's performance is consistently excellent, it doesn't always seem to further the cause of the music; there are too many moments on <em>Love's Miracle</em> that effectively reduce Qui's extremely talented instrumentalists to a backing band and the inimitable Yow to a sideshow.  While the Gollum-like cajoling ""smack her, smack her!"" on ""Gash"" is wonderfully menacing, it's not all that well-suited to Cronk's high-octane riffage.  The overlong ""A#1"" comes off as subpar psychedelic riff-rock pastiche.  And a cover of Pink Floyd's ""Echoes"" (thankfully trimmed down from the original 23 minutes) isn't all that exciting, especially on such a short record.</p><p>
    Given that this is the second full-length release from a relatively young band-- and its first to incorporate an extremely distinctive vocalist-- <em>Love's Miracle</em> is hardly disappointing.  Rather than pigeonholing themselves via Yow's former band, Qui draw from a broad and inclusive history of noisemakers old and new.  Yes, <em>Love's Miracle</em> is more than a little bit scattered.  But it's refreshing to hear a band that's still interested in pushing people's buttons, fucking around but playing well, and not worrying about being all things to all people.</p></div>"|10689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10689-loves-miracle/|7.2|Matt LeMay

    Like prophets, Savannah, Ga., metal quartet Baroness named
    its earliest releases <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">First </span>and<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> Second</span><span>.
    Their third-- and first for Relapse Records-- is called </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Red Album</span><span>, and it's seven minutes longer than its predecessors
    combined. It's also </span><span>more ambitious, more accomplished, simply bigger:
    Here, the ideas Baroness have offered since 2003-- a colossal, airtight rhythm
    section backing sludge-of-the-South vocals and guitars-- </span><span>are realized with purpose and aim.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Of the four current genuinely unorthodox metal bands
    from Georgia-- Mastodon, Harvey Milk, Kylesa (whose Phillip Cope produced <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Red
    Album</span><span>), and Baroness-- it's Baroness that are
    perhaps the most comely. The band shares some of the most appealing traits of
    its fellow statesmen-- Mastodon's steaming guitar trips, Harvey Milk's teasing
    maneuvers and crushing payoffs, Kylesa's generally crusty countenance. But on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Red
    Album</span><span>, those qualities culminate into a
    dynamic, moving landscape, full of unexpected pitfalls, lifts, and classic
    bait-and-switches. The album's most energetic coda, for instance, collapses
    into a contemplative piece for finger-picked acoustic guitar, and its most
    ferocious pocket of thrash has winding instrumentals for bookends. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Baroness juggle motifs and
    ideas, making patterns only to toss them and catch them later. Ascendant,
    spectral guitar phrases ease the album in, supplying the sort of radiant hum
    that shaped Brian Eno's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Music for Airports</span><span>.
    Cymbal splashes and aberrant notes tease that flow, obliterating it when the
    guitar finds its theme and the drums land their mid-tempo, kick-and-tom gallop.
    But the next 15 minutes are pure power. Intervening tracks ""Rays on Pinion"" and
    ""Isak"" turn laptop speakers into arsenals of cannons and automatic
    weapons. John Baizley's voice is dually capable of shouting down a spirit or
    etching melody from the same monolithic growl, and his guitar interplay with
    Brian Blickle is all energy. But four tracks in, those introductory ebbs wash
    back, slightly less predictable and graceful. Before they seemed pure, but
    now-- as drummer Allen Blickle pounds away in the encroaching distance-- things are
    panicked. Tongue-and-groove guitarmonies sometimes lift the band's reins, letting
    the rhythm section flip tempos just beneath. On ""Aleph"", Baroness even inverts
    that pattern, killing the rhythm to let the piercing, lock-and-key guitars
    diverge and cobweb into silence through long, corroding riffs.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    As replete as it is with changes, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Red Album</span><span>'s relation to prog runs the risk of being overstated
    at the sake of Southern rock, the Georgia bone-and-blood genre that, at its
    best, challenged prog as a dynamic equal and emotional master. When Baroness are swiveling through intertwining, fast-fingered melodies like
    those of ""The Birthing"" or letting the big, bouncy groove of ""Pinion"" stand
    alone, they're channeling a local lineage that began in Macon with the Allmans.
    And on the acoustic ""Cockroach en Fleur"", Baroness nod more to the
    mountain music one state up and to the humid blues two states over than to
    trans-Atlantic psychedelia or prog-minded folk. The source of those
    sidetrips-- Southern steam over proggy smarts-- has two consequences: </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Red
    Album</span><span>, full of Baizley lyrics about bearing
    the world's load and ""resign[ing] ourselves to soar home,"" is a workhorse.
    Most importantly, though, is Baroness' consistent return to a comfortable,
    languid groove after every excursion. The album roars and creeps, but it's best
    when it's somewhere in between, riding a slightly above-mid-tempo pace. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Red Album</span><span> stands to
    lose Baroness a clutch of longtime devotees, wont to damn these simmering
    textures and time-lapse payoffs in favor of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">First</span><span> and </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Second</span><span>'s maul and fervor. But it's the type of album that can help a band
    begin to gain a Mastodon-sized legion. The double-guitar chug and dirty-bass
    thrum of ""The Birthing""-- juxtaposed as they are with Baizley's distended,
    growling melody-- are readymade for today's dominant mixed metal crowd, where half of a room loses its mind near the stage as the other more stoic half nods at the pit's perimeter. And, in Baroness' case, that's perfectly fine: Purity's never
    been a concern. It's just that, on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Red Album</span><span>, the band's disparate cores finally have more space
    and more effect. The textures have become holistic atmospheres, the peaks
    anthemic strongholds, and the clashes unavoidable cataclysms. When they
    intersect in the middle, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Red Album</span><span>
    is hard to doubt.</span>

    Roky Erickson didn't invent psychedelic rock, but he did (with the 13th Floor Elevators) give it its name. He didn't invent garage rock, either, but he remains one of the few artists of the <em>Nuggets</em>-era revered as more than a flash in the pan.</p><p>
    This much is made clear in the first few minutes of <em>You're Gonna Miss Me</em>, the excellent 2005 documentary about the life and times of Roky Erickson. In fact, these early biographical touchstones essentially mark both the start and end of the Roky Erickson musical story, since Erickson spent much of his years past his late-1960s prime struggling with drug addiction and alleged schizophrenia. <em>You're Gonna Miss Me</em> is thus less about Erickson's musical legacy than it is about the quest to restore that legacy, allowing Erickson to reclaim his past so that he might have a future.</p><p>
    Obviously, given that Erickson is playing live again, the mission was a success and Erickson's reputation was restored. Still, for many his music remains either hopelessly obscure or too scattered around to get a grip on. Erickson's been anthologized so often that even some of the numerous best-ofs and boxed sets aren't necessarily the best place to begin.
    </p>
<p>
    That's where the <em>You're Gonna Miss Me</em> soundtrack steps in: as a well-intentioned one-stop dive-in point for Erickson's colorful and storied 40-year career. Except that even that's been done already, too, by 1995's excellent two disc <em>I Have Always Been Here Before: The Roky Erickson Anthology</em>, which includes all but a couple of the paltry 12 songs included on <em>You're Gonna Miss Me</em>. That leaves this disc a well-intentioned one-stop dive-in point with an asterisk. It's a well-intentioned one-stop dive-in point for anyone that doesn't want or have an earlier, superior one-stop dive-in point.
    </p>
<p>
    But that's OK, especially if your introduction to Erickson-- his trademark shriek, his surreal lyrics and, most of all, his otherworldly life-- comes via the documentary's narrative. Certainly Erickson's songs possess different meanings when paired with the sight of this disheveled veteran, victim, and survivor, for years passed over or ignored as an outsider when in the end his mixed-up ways were more a matter of him getting-- or being denied-- the right meds, care, and treatment than the actual effects of madness.
    </p>
<p>
    As far as that goes, Erickson's best songs-- the ever-astounding ""You're Gonna Miss Me"", ""Fire Engine"", ""Red Temple Prayer (Two Headed Dog)"", ""For You (I'd Do Anything)""-- are no crazier than those of any gifted songwriter whose effortless output marks both a sign of genius and a certain insanity. Where do these things come from? And are all artists able to reach down into themselves and produce music capable of affecting so many perhaps a little bit nuts, too?
    </p>
<p>
    The happy ending of movie and man alike is, of course, that Roky Erickson is back up and running, but <em>You're Gonna Miss Me</em> adds one important facet to the tale: he's still good, too. One unique selling point of this disc is an unreleased song of recent vintage, ""Goodbye Sweet Dreams"", which plays over the ending credits of <em>You're Gonna Miss Me</em> and implies a fresh start to Erickson's stalled career. Is there more where that came from? Of course there is. There always is. But for the first time in his life, Roky Erickson may be in a position to actively expand his legacy rather than simply fade away with it.

    Calling Arks a one-note act would almost be a literal interpretation after hearing the opening title track of <em>The International</em>. Starting with a staccato snare beat, singer/guitarist Paul Hornschemeier (who's also a noted comic artist and writer, author of the fantastic <em>Sequential</em>  among many others) barks in monotone like a lifeguard's warning, and the guitars and bass follow suit, all layering onto one tone in lockstep rhythm. The song barely varies on the chorus, letting the notes reverberate for a few moments while the singer scrounges just enough melody to make up a hook. It's one of the more economical openers I've heard lately, and it certainly sets the tone for the rest of the record.</p><p>
<em>The International</em> is a mix of familiar underground sounds with peculiar execution, cobbling songs together from loose, jagged shards of melody, suggesting and insinuating hooks rather than laying them out for the listener. From second track ""Candor"" on, Arks establish an unusual tension, with songs that never quite go the direction you'd expect. However, they often go from one obvious influence to the next without even so much as a segue, ""Candor"" among them. They've made some unusual choices there, too: Girls Against Boys are not a band you often hear referenced, nor do they get loads of accolades in hindsight. I'm pleased to hear them nodded to, in the surprise breakdown of ""Candor"" and many other places on <em>The International</em>. However, GvsB themselves hovered on the precipice of parody, and aping them is a tricky thing without sounding like an aspiring sleaze at best, and a charmless Nic Offer at worst. Hence the Jekyll/Hyde vocals of ""Candor"" sound more incongruous than they should, and the lounge-lizard verses to choked rants on the chorus of ""Cars on Fire"" is a little hard to take seriously.</p><p>
    The album's middle section is no less indebted, but a little more focused. The clean, single-note guitar parts nod to the sprawling peaks of the Cure's career, as does Hornschemeier's more insistent wail. Falling in these footsteps suits them better, as they take the time to develop a groove and a more noticeable, moodier atmosphere than the record's swaggering first third-- the sparse stretch of ""Customs"" especially seems to fold restlessness of the title track into a careful tribute. Hornscheimer also lays back on that one, and he shows good instincts throughout when he doesn't have to lead the pack. He only mutters a few disdainful words over the verses in ""Safe and Sound"", knowing well enough to let the minimal horror-camp atmosphere take the foreground, and punching in on the chorus when needed. It's a shame that it's one of the few moments where the band picks up the slack melodically, as that and the squealing grind of ""Silver"" are easy standouts here.
    </p>
<p>
    The cumulative mood of the songs on <em>The International</em> seems to hint towards omnipresent, low-level paranoia, though primarily through snippets of lyrics and the ghostly reverb of the guitars. The vibe gets across, but mostly because the record feels claustrophobic and homogeneous. Though many of it's songs aren't much more than the sum of their influences, collectively, they have an odd, stilted swagger all their own. Arks' debut is still pretty derivative, but it sounds like they're learning the right lessons.

    In 2006, the release of Sonic Youth's <em>Rather Ripped</em> brought a lot of the band's ex-fans-- people who'd either gotten over them with the help of 2000's <em>NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers</em>,
    or just thought they'd finally aged out-- back to the fold. The more tuneful record was
    different from anything they'd done this decade, re-establishing the direct line many of us had to the Sonic
    Youth of our teenage years. At the Pitchfork Music Festival this
    summer, Sonic Youth played a well-received <em>Daydream Nation</em>, but a bunch of people I talked to after their set thought the group sounded even <em>better</em> during the encore, when they tore through a handful of newer songs.</p><p>
    As a separate entity from Sonic Youth, Thurston Moore's reputation as
    a basement icon precedes him. Where it was once surprising to
    find him at Connecticut noise shows, Brooklyn No Fun fests, and Western
    Massachusetts DIY open mic nights, his recent role as mentor to
    (and collaborator with) young rock dynamos has since made his presence in
    the underground a constant. Given these feedback showdowns--
    not to mention the solo work of his distant past-- it came as a mild
    shock when his Ecstatic Peace label recently announced that not only
    was there a new Thurston Moore solo album in the works (his first
    formal LP since 1995's <em>Psychic Hearts</em>), but that it would also feature actual <em>songs</em>.</p><p>
<em>Trees Outside the Academy</em> is, in fact, a song-based album-- and they're <em>good</em> songs, too.<em> Rather Ripped</em>
    had whistle-clean guitar lines and minimal melodies-- the noise had
    lifted to reveal Sonic Youth still picking out sharp hooks, with
    songcraft as sparkling as ever. Those pop songs were a good place for
    them to return to for inspiration-- they gave the band a form (rather
    than void) to play around with-- and <em>Trees</em> takes up a similar
    challenge: What can a guy like Thurston Moore do with the bare,
    noiseless architecture of an acoustic guitar and verse-chorus-verse
    structures?<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Try ""Honest James"", a chiming, slippery duet with Charalambides' Christina Carter that holds back on vocals until two minutes in, giving that delayed entrance an immediate kick. Or ""Fri/End"", an archetypal spoken-sung Moore track that begins with cranky feedback, then something more upbeat and jaunty before settling into a melancholy Sonic Youth groove.  Add experimental folk artist Samara Lubelski's violin punctuation, which augments every song here, and Steve Shelley's solid drumming, and you begin to understand how much this guy can do with relatively little-- especially after growing accustomed to hearing him work for so long with so much more.</p><p>
    Those listening for Sonic Youth demos might be surprised to hear how much more there is to Moore's songwriting when it's comparatively unadorned.  What would be burners in his band's hands are instead spare and introspective: ""The Shape Is in a Trance"" is weary; ""Wonderful Witches + Language Meanies"" begins emphatically and then strips down, a kind of reverse-momentum rock song.  And then, just to prove he can do it, ""Never Light"" is a guileless twilight-type ballad about ""beat-up copies of old satellites, messages beaming."" </p><p>
    Spare hints of Moore's more revved up ways show up here and there on <em>Trees</em>, but with the same relaxed and dusty cast: ""American Coffin""'s out-of-tune piano, ""Free Noise Among Friends""' homemade analog noise, and ""Thurston@13"", a self-explanatory archival tape that begins like this: ""What you are about to hear is me taking off the <em>cap</em> of a Lysol spray disinfectant can...[pop]...<em>there</em>.  What you are about to hear is me spraying Lysol spraying disinfectant <em>around</em>...<em>the room</em>...<em>I am in</em>...[spray sound]... <em>there</em>.""  </p><p>
    It's no coincidence that Moore chooses to end <em>Trees</em> on this note.  That his 13-year-old self was a huge theatrical weirdo won't surprise anyone, nor will the fact that the track ends with a young Thurston saying, ""What you have heard is me wasting time again, asking myself deep inside, why the fuck I am doing this?"" Of course, he's already answered this question, and he knows he has.  What he's hinting at is a different question: How many different ways will he do it before he's done?

Stockholm's Shout Out Louds made their U.S. debut two years ago, on the heels of garage-rockers the Hives and Mando Diao, retro-pop groups like the Concretes, and a bunch of immediately regrettable Ikea jokes. Since then, Swedish pop's stateside profile has continued to escalate. Many listeners who never heard Shout Out Louds' major-label full-length have probably seen their video work; bassist Ted Malmros directed the <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/39241-video-peter-bjorn-and-john-ft-victoria-bergsman-young-folks""><strong>animated clip</strong></a> for Peter Björn &amp; John's ""Young Folks"".</p><p>
    That trio's Björn Yttling produces Shout Out Louds' sophomore album (and Merge debut) <em>Our Ill Wills</em>, after sharing the controls for the quintet's 2005 Capitol LP <em>Howl Howl Gaff Gaff</em>. Yttling's undivided attention occasions plinking piano played by the man himself, more acoustic guitars, and the expansive percussion sound familiar from his own band's <em>Writer's Block</em> and his recent production for Victoria Bergsman's Taken By Trees. Brisk strums and lead singer Adam Olenius' Robert Smith-like anguish mean the Cure's most streamlined pop album, 1985's <em>The Head on the Door</em>, is still as apt a reference point as it was for Shout Out Louds' prior album, though sharper hooks and emotionally richer songwriting ensure <em>Our Ill Wills</em> improves upon its predecessor.</p><p>
    Yttling's cinematic production wouldn't be enough without a set of strong tunes. Where <em>Writer's Block</em>'s high points came from the new-love dizziness of ""Objects of My Affection"", ""Paris 2004"", or, yes, ""Young Folks"", <em>Our Ill Wills</em> shakes with the pain of loves lost and unrequited. For all the bright synth-strings and acoustic guitar of excellent first single ""Tonight I Have to Leave It"", what matters most is the feeling Olenius is leaving behind: ""I just want to be bothered with real love,"" he sighs. The album's second single, seven-minute ""Impossible"", finds Olenius wanting what he can't have, and not wanting nearly everything else. No amount of cheery woodblock percussion can mitigate that gnawing paradox. It's surely with some bitter irony that he imagines the now-unattainable object of his affection finding true love of her own: ""I know it could happen to you,"" he concludes.
    </p><p>
    Olenius' sobbing vocals might grate if he spent the entire album whining about girls, so it's satisfying when the album explores other themes: a tragic accident on ""Time Left for Love"", tricks of memory on ""Your Parents Livingroom"", or calls to the police and vague worries about ""when she will get her child"" on ""You Are Dreaming"", with its indelible ""don't come back to Stockholm"" chorus. Travel is a means of escape for Olenius, too, on ""Normandie"" (also note the album cover's maritime-signal theme).
    </p>
<p>
    Even when Shout Out Louds sing about something else, for them-- as for most pop groups, including PB&amp;J-- love is a constant subtext. On ""Normandie"", Olenius can't escape his old flame's memory. Over tropical acoustic guitars on ""South America"", he gets stupidly jealous at the sudden thought she might fall for someone else ""in the bright nightclub light""; it's an embarrassingly realistic male moment. Multi-instrumentalist Bebban Stenborg takes the lead for a female perspective on despair-drenched ""Blue Headlights"", her breathy vocals not undeserving of the inevitable comparisons to Bergsman (whose part she sang in PB&amp;J's Coachella performance of ""Young Folks"").
    </p>
<p>
    If the songs can't all hold up to those of inspirations like the Cure or the Smiths-- ""Meat Is Murder"" is an acoustic lament, not a cover-- well, few can. ""I haven't said too much, have I?/ There are things you should keep to yourself,"" Olenius frets, on a guitar-pop album full of what can sound like another person's aching secrets: a fellow traveler's pursuit of what might almost seem impossible, until it happens to you. On the strength of <em>Our Ill Wills</em>, Sweden looks poised to win a few more hearts, minds, and sensitive souls.

    Would electro-house have happened without Ewan Pearson? Certainly, but it probably wouldn't have erupted so spectacularly. Pearson's 2002 remix of Freeform Five's ""Perspex Sex"" is the key moment in the genre's emergence out of electroclash, the seductive drive of its house beat signaling the moment when the machines turned on their masters and demanded their own dancefloor satisfaction. Living up to the original song's title, the ""Perspex Sex"" remix combined sadistic robot vocals with a speaker-tearing synthesizer riff that sounded and felt like a fist squeezing your heart convulsively. In retrospect though, this dancefloor monster's most telling attribute is the sudden flood of sorrowing strings towards the end, which lift the song to an eerie, oddly self-reflective climax, perhaps inviting listeners to consider the consequences of their amoral program of sexual gratification.</p><p>
    It's this shift in register towards the widescreen and the cinematic that has become characteristic of Pearson's astonishing (and astonishingly prolific) run of remixes ever since. Despite a short run of solo productions in the late 1990s as Maas, and today as Partial Arts (with Al Usher), it is Pearson's remix work over the last five years that has both established his name and defined an individual aesthetic, so it's fitting that it should now receive the lavish double-disc retrospective treatment.</p><p>
<em>Piece Work</em> is an exhausting document, but its size feels appropriate: more than anything else, what Pearson's remix work has always called to mind is the ""extended mix"" of pop songs so common in the 1980s, sensitively redeploying the original songs' charms amidst epic dancefloor arrangements of synthetic splendor, with sonic cues equally drawn from Giorgio Moroder, New Order, and Orbital. But Pearson's ideological commitment to the extended mix should not be mistaken for conservatism. In fact, he's weakest when he's most tentative: On pretty but underwhelming remixes for Closer Musik and Depeche Mode, he sounds too enamored and respectful of the originals. Rather, the best material on <em>Piece Work</em> interprets the notion of the extended mix as a process of destruction and resurrection, Pearson stripping the source material to its bare essentials (usually just a vocal and perhaps a solitary melodic hook) and rebuilding it into something more majestic than the original's creators could have envisioned. 
    </p>
<p>
    As with Jacques Lu Cont's remixes, it's often the less-than-perfect originals that are most astonishingly transformed: witness how ""The Golden Path"", the Chemical Brothers' bloodless synth-rock collaboration with the Flaming Lips, is blown up into a swirling electro epic, its endless neo-Moroder groove ceaselessly introducing more and more synthesizer lines and sound effects, until it finally explodes into a climax of sighing firefly harmonies. Stripping from the song the signifiers of the psychedelic, Pearson's buzzing electro version is psychedelic in substance, its effortless evocation of panoramic visions acting as a rebuke to the original's empty pretensions.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite having dabbled in a number of sonic gimmicks that are clearly of their time (from schaffel to glitchy minimal beats to acid 303 spirals to neo-shoegazer guitar chords), today Pearson's remixes mostly sound more contemporary than I expected them to, perhaps owing to his characteristic largess. This is partly a matter of timing-- dance music is in love with the epic at the moment-- but I wonder if Pearson's best work, consistently exceeding and overspilling its functional qualities, simply resists temporal classification; by being so allusive of so many sounds and sensations, these grooves can always find a ""home"" within current trends. 
    </p>
<p>
    The collection's most recent effort, a dramatic extended reconstruction of Cortney Tidwell's ""Don't Let Stars Keep Us Tangled Up"", demonstrates perfectly how Pearson's signature sound weathers changes in fashion: its unusually soft, shimmering assemblage of interwoven chime loops blends exacting discipline with mind-altering expansiveness, sounding equally at home amidst DJ sets peddling minimal, deep house, or cosmic disco, and always finding something in its surroundings to pick up and reflect back more brightly. 
    </p>
<p>
    Pearson's lavish production bleeds into his DJ sets, which are gaining a higher profile due to his superlative mixing style: often matching not just the beat but also the harmonic key between tracks, he has a knack for pulling off fast but flawless transitions that sound utterly organic. Mixing skills are only part of the story, however, and 2005's <em>Sci.Fi.Hi.Fi.</em> mix was equally impressive for the distinctively melodic floating quality it sustained for long stretches. Pearson's recent <em>Fabric</em> mix sounds more in line with current European dance trends, but while its rigorous focus on the dancefloor sacrifices some of the magical cinematic feel of <em>Sci.Fi.Hi.Fi.</em>, its relentless physicality makes it the stronger effort overall.
    </p>
<p>
    Aside from the odd inclusion of a percussive punk-funk workout from Liquid Liquid, this time around Pearson mostly opts for minimally melodic, big-riffing tech-house. In context, the Liquid Liquid detour makes more sense: hypnotically muscular tracks such as Konrad Black's remix of Snax's ""Honeymoon's Over"", Tobi Neumann's remix of Johannes Heil's ""All For One"", and Kaos' ""Panopeeps"" share the same monomaniacal focus on percussive grooves translated into an electronic environment, endlessly reiterating simple combinations of glowering bass and mnemonic keyboard riffs in a manner that builds up an intense sense of friction, as if the various components are literally rubbing themselves against one another. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's here, within the grooves, that Pearson's penchant for melodrama has been discreetly secreted, and what at first seems unspectacular and almost workmanlike gradually reveals itself to be chasing a grandeur of a different kind. Right at the end he relents and pulls out the big gesture, laying the familiar vocals from Beanfield's ""Tides"" over Aril Brikha's monstrously portentous neo-trance ""Berghain"". The shameless grandstanding of the resulting sing-along anthem stops just short of self-parody; we'd expect nothing less.<br/>

    Since debuting in 2004 with <em>Meritie</em>, Merja Kokkonen, aka Islaja, has refined and restitched her fractured craft. Kokkonen plays in Avarus, Kemialliset Ystävät, and Hertta Lussu Assa (with Lau Nau and Kuupuu), but Islaja remains a particularly magic space where she weaves her most personal and affecting material. On album three, <em>Ulual Yyy</em>, she manages to introduce a more refined approach, offering a deeper and denser atmosphere, without sacrificing the free flow or, importantly, the mystery.</p><p>
    Case in point: <em>Ulual Yyy</em>'s been out since April, and I listen to it regularly, but somehow until now I haven't been able to affix any words: it's kind of like decoding a secret language. These nine songs present such a personal, eccentric vision, it feels strange offering a reaction in straight-and-narrow paragraphs. As with certain artists, it seems like the more fitting way to stumble upon Islaja would be scrolling past her chillingly ecstatic vocals on an AM dial or hearing those shuffling dub drums, thin guitars, and creaky strings drifting out from some shack deep in the woods.</p><p>
    If you haven't heard Islaja yet, don't expect another moody, post-<em>Golden Apples</em> female folky. As Dominique Leone pointed out in his 2005 review of <em>Palaa Aurinkoon</em>, Kokkonen has ""more in common with an abstract expressionist painter than a folk musician, using her palette to fill in the details of subconscious experience."" The description has always struck me as the dead-on way to approach Islaja's surrealist landscape: Rip up your maps, toss the fragments in the air, and see where they land. The logic isn't always clear-- especially because she sings in Finnish and we non-Finnish speakers can't use lyrics as guides-- but the songs, no matter how skeletal or warped, congeal into intimate, sharp-focused epiphanies/moments.
    </p>
<p>
    From the opening, woozy piano steps of ""Kutsukaa Sydäntä"" through the catchy Gang Gang Dancing of the excellent ""Pete P"" (sax skronk, feedback clouds, Krokkonen in diva mode) and the psychedelic Twisted Village jazzing of ""Laulu Jo Menneestä"", <em>Ulual Yyy</em> is her strongest work to date. The uncoiling, Shadow Ring-style ""Muusimaa"" tumbles over itself, dropping percussion, strings, and onto a patchwork quilt. The spare, sawing, ""Pysähtyneet Planeetat"" feels like a forest lament filtered with a pitch shifter that distorts the undertow. ""Varjokuvastin"", which also includes vocals by Jukka Raisanen, finds Kokkonen splitting into multiple personalities over spare, but busy bass and organ. She spins delicate vocals over armies of toy instruments.
    </p>
<p>
    The technique of pairing slightly askew doubled vocals makes it sounds like she's singing, breathlessly, to herself between two cans connected with string (and tiny bits of glitter). A rather prominent Don Henley sax can verge on cheese, but cast against cascading pitches, howls, creepy organs and her ecstatic voice(s), it's ripped enough from a usual context to render it somehow mystical and enchanting. Raisanen, also of Sala-Arhimo, is the one blowing. He also adds bass, additional vocals, and straight-up ""new age synth."" It's amazing how those horns transform Kokkonen from wood sprite to noir vocalist in a smoky speakeasy-- Yoko Ono singing to Peter Jefferies' <em>Last Great Challenge in a Dull World</em> (when is someone going to reissue that, by the way?).
    </p>
<p>
    You hate to make your own echoes, but as I <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/43027-islaja-pyshtyneet-planeetat-stream""><strong>mentioned in Forkcast a</strong></a> few months ago, <em>Ulual Yyy</em>'s cover includes a photo of Krokonnen, strands of her hair covering parts of her face. One curl in particular casts a shadow, making her mouth appear larger than it is. It's a surreal, seemingly unintentional touch. The way the light's shining, it also seems to be in the middle of a particular strong sunset-- the bright moment before the moon. Across these forty-one minutes, shades and shadows play similar tricks on our ears, expanding and warping the instruments we run into on a daily basis.

    Picture the most over-the-top clique of art connoisseurs conversing outside a cafe in Williamsburg, then imagine a soundtrack to said conversation. Congratulations, your brain's just imagineered <em>Our Way Is Revenge</em>, the debut from the Brooklyn-based hodgepodge Shock Cinema. Essentially the product of some intricate networking-- drummer Miyuki Furtado (Rogers Sisters) tours with Katrina Ford (Celebration), Ford recruits him a guitarist and singer, TV on the Radio's David Sitek takes them under his wing, etc.-- the group totes a copious catalog of influences (both musical and non-musical) into this pithy 28-minute EP.</p><p>
    Considering their eclectic shout-outs to David Lynch, Can, Ennio Morricone, and other high-minded luminaries, Shock Cinema's music fits snugly in the post-punk niche, the six tracks and two remixes providing few chances for anti-ingenue frontlady Destiny Montague to elude Karen O/Vanessa Hay/Siouxsie Sioux comparisons. The rest of the band follows suit, crafting tinny, echo-laden backing all within the confines of CBGB's safety restrictions, never blowing the roof off with any one riff or cymbal crash but adequately filling out the venue nonetheless.</p><p>
    In modest doses, the pretentiousness and mimicry doesn't mean squat. Opener ""Breathe Again"" coasts on an ultra-cool surf guitar riff lifted from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' <em>Fever to Tell</em>, but as the track disintegrates into ruckus and Montague's imagery of bodily harm comes to the foreground, you can hear echoes of a twisted Kim Gordon-led Sonic Youth number rather than stockpiled post-punk tropes. The three-piece garage assault boils over on ""Death in Texas"", perhaps the track where the presence of Trail of Dead bassist Danny Wood is most apparent. Although most of <em>Revenge</em> beats the chromatic scales and loud-soft dynamics to death, ""Texas"" doesn't relegate its riffs to the status of glorified vamps, a lesson the stagnant ""Aftr Hrs"" and ""Howling Door (Evasion)"" should jot down.
    </p>
<p>
    The album's more sluggish tracks, along with the slapdash pro-am remixes, compromise the fireworks provided by <em>Revenge</em>'s more volatile songs. I understand the band refusing to fall rank and file behind the YYYs or Be Your Own Pet, but slowing things down painfully exposes their art-rock pablum. Unlike the Long Blondes or Love Is All, bands with similar post-punk/new wave aims yet broader palettes, Shock Cinema lack both the biting wit and endearing tenderness to complement their cerebral, misanthropic post-punk trappings. ""Art of Noir"", sung entirely in French, registers as something mildly charming and/or sexy, but its repetitive, back-and-forth raga has been done better by more stripped-down acts like Spoon, and the souped-up Giovanni Marks remix finds the track even less engaging on the dancefloor.
    </p>
<p>
    Ironically, the lack of anything remotely shocking is Shock Cinema's Achilles heel. No one's getting points docked off the bat anymore for shameless soundalikes, but you still need to reflect your influences from a new, interesting angle. Considering how quickly this disparate group of musicians assembled, there's still loads of potential here waiting to be tapped, and <em>Revenge</em> comes packed with more than enough avenues for the band to journey down. Until then, though, this band's merely relaxing under the massive shade of their touchstones.

After the 2004 release of their excellent, career-spanning singles compilation <em>Inches</em> (which featured ""Meet Me in the Dollar Bin"" as its lead track), Les Savy Fav fans feared the band was ready to call it a day.  Band members moved apart, live shows became infrequent, and the chances of a proper follow-up to the 2001 full-length <em>Go Forth</em> seemed slim-to-none.  So when Les Savy Fav announced that they'd be releasing a new album this year, I was pleasantly surprised; when they revealed <em>Let's Stay Friends</em>' solicitous and slyly breakup-referencing title and formidable roster of famous guests... I wasn't as sure.  Les Savy Fav are nothing if not smart and self-aware-- could <em>Let's Stay Friends</em> be an expertly plotted careerist cash-in?</p><p>
    Thankfully not.  Les Savy Fav have had numerous opportunities to cast themselves as trendsetters and reap the subsequent rewards, and they've always known better.  Their gritty, angular guitar-punk opus <em>Rome (Written Upside Down)</em> was released a year before the Liars' <em>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument On Top</em>.  The more refined, disco-inflected <em>Go Forth</em> was released two years before the Rapture's <em>Echoes</em>.  Les Savy Fav never stuck around to pillage any of the bandwagons they may have set in motion, and they have a stunningly consistent and bullshit-free discography to show for it.</p><p>
    So what more can you expect from a band that's done everything they said they would?  On album opener ""Pots and Pans"", Harrington answers this question in no uncertain terms: ""Let's tear this whole place down and build it up again/ This band's a beating heart and it's nowhere near its end.""  Rather than listlessly rehashing their past achievements or attempting a superficial overhaul, Les Savy Fav are doing something much riskier: They're trying to become a better band.</p><p>
    ""The Equestrian"" fulfills Harrington's promise in both its intensity and its ingenuity, building from a rough-and-tumble verse to a fluid, slinky chorus.  While Les Savy Fav once relished in the abrupt and the discontinuous, <em>Let's Stay Friends</em> reveals a surprising amount of elegance.  It also shows the band more interested than ever in playing at contrasts and exploring their own range.  Harrington always seemed to focus more on rhythm than on melody, but here he proves himself a capable and versatile vocalist.  On album standout ""Patty Lee"", Harrington sings the first verse in a playful falsetto and the second in a gravelly yelp.  Guitarist Seth Jabour matches him hook for hook, spinning out inventive and melodic guitar lines that owe as much to Archers of Loaf as they do to oft-referenced influence Gang of Four.</p><p>
    Les Savy Fav have always covered a lot of stylistic ground, but in an effort to further diversify, <em>Let's Stay Friends</em> sometimes finds them focusing on material that doesn't always play to their strengths. The effort is commendable, but the results are mixed: The album's biggest gamble-- and, unfortunately, biggest flop-- is ""Comes and Goes"", a largely drumless duet with Fiery Furnaces frontwoman Eleanor Friedberger. While the prospect of a full-on Les Savy Fav ballad is intriguing, ""Comes and Goes"" sees them struggling to incorporate too many unfamiliar elements and winding up with an uncharacteristically dull experiment not far removed from the Fiery Furnaces' less schizophrenic material.</p><p>
    As its title cleverly suggests, <em>Let's Stay Friends</em> rewards long-term interest; it's not Les Savy Fav's most immediate record, nor is it their best. It's the product of a band willing to sacrifice the ""holy shit!"" moment for the fully formed song, to be ambitious without necessarily sounding ambitious, and to become better at the things they don't do best.  If Les Savy Fav are as far ahead of the curve here as they've been in the past, the next couple of years seem to be shaping up well.</p></div>"|10678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10678-lets-stay-friends/|8.3|Matt LeMay

By the tail end     of the 1960s, something was already in the air (and water) marking a     radical cultural shift; recreational drugs were just one part of the     anti-establishment equation. By 1967, year of the Summer of Love, the     counterculture made a valiant bid to supplant the dominant culture, and in     retrospect a strong case can be made that the counter-culture won.</p>
<p>At the forefront of this battle, in Britain, were acts like Pink     Floyd, fixtures of the nascent underground psychedelic scene. Granted, they were fixtures of the infamous     UFO Club and the toast of no less than Paul McCartney (allegedly a recent     convert to the powers of psychotropic drugs), but the band never claimed to be     spokespersons for the revolution. They weren't leaders but fellow travelers-- at least until their epochal debut, <i>The Piper at the Gates     of Dawn</i>.</p>
<p><i>Piper</i> was recorded at Abbey Road at the same time the Beatles were     there recording <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, but the results     couldn't have been more at odds with one another. Where the Beatles exerted     complete control over the tools of the studio, Pink Floyd used the studio to     lose control. It didn't hurt that the band's primary songwriter and visionary     Syd Barrett was on the verge of permanently losing control himself. Less than a     year after the release of <i>Piper</i>, in 1967, Barrett was out of the band, one of     the most prominent and tragic casualties of the rock era. Of course, while     Barrett lived out the remainder of his life as one of the psychedelic age's     walking wounded, Pink Floyd went on to much bigger (if not necessarily) better     things. Their catalog remains an AOR goldmine, the gift that keeps on giving     for the band's principals, who, all said and done, released relatively few     records during their heyday, but who have benefited a thousand fold from their     efforts.</p>
<p>The 40th anniversary edition of <i>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i>--     overseen by producer James Guthrie, who engineered and co-produced <i>The Wall </i>and     who first cleaned up <i>Piper</i> for its 1994 reissue-- is now available as either a     2xCD or 3xCD set, but don't get your hopes up for a bounty of rarities or other goodies. The former includes both the     stereo version of the album as well as the mono version (which many Floyd     fanatics find superior). The 3xCD edition includes an extra disc covering the group's classic 1967 singles     ""Arnold Layne"" and ""Apples and Oranges"", their respective     B-sides ""Candy and a Currant Bun"" and ""Paintbox"", an     alternate take of ""Matilda Mother"", two alternate versions of     ""Interstellar Overdrive"", and a stereo version of ""Apples and     Oranges"". Only ""Matilda Mother"" and one take on     ""Interstellar Overdrive"" are previously unreleased.</p>
<p>A special edition of <i>Piper</i> was inevitable, but so was     the failure of any reissue as incomprehensive as     this one: This new edition underscores the reality that EMI and/or the surviving members     of Pink Floyd-- especially since they shifted from band to de facto     corporation-- have been either downright stingy with their unreleased archives     or hopelessly coy about what may lie in there, leaving fans to settle for second-hand scraps like those on <i>A Treeful of Secrets</i>, a 17xCD fan-made rarities compilation.     From a fan's perspective, Pink Floyd, Inc. has been either indifferent at best     (or hostile at worst) to the notion of managing its legacy-- especially its     formative years-- and has only reluctantly taken up caretaking duties as part     and parcel of cordoning it off.</p>
<p>Few would criticize the merits of <i>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i> itself (as reflected in the rating above)-- it's an essential album. While     so many other products of the Summer of Love were positive and unifying, <i>Piper</i> was fractured and scary. Songs like ""Astronomy Domine"" and     ""Interstellar Overdrive"" captured the sustained improvisational freakouts of     the band's live shows, but did so in more concise form. Other songs, like     ""Lucifer Sam,"" ""Bike"", and ""The Gnome"", split the difference between quirky pop     songs and explorations of the nightmarish found-sound fringe, setting a     twisted template for countless acts to come. By 1980's <i>The Wall</i>, Pink Floyd had     become sterile and solipsistic. At this auspicious start, Pink Floyd were     thrilling. Anything was possible.</p>
<p>Those aforementioned singles, ""Arnold Layne"" (produced     by early Floyd booster Joe Boyd) and ""See Emily Play"", probably remain the     best distillations of early Pink Floyd, and in particular the pop genius of Syd     Barrett. They set the stage not only for the more sustained vision of <i>Piper</i>,     but also Barrett's all-too-brief subsequent solo output, before he receded into     the background. In fact, it's the presence of Barrett (who wrote all but one     song on <i>Piper</i>) that accounts for the album's influence as more than just a     psychedelic relic. As a lyricist, his stream-of-conscious nonsense verses are     every bit the match of Lewis Carroll. As a vocalist, often singing with     keyboardist Rick Wright, his languid delivery lends the album a dreamy quality     at odds with its menace. You can catch glimpses of Barrett's subconscious in a     12-page reproduction of one of his notebooks, hanging as bait for ardent fans     to shell out for the deluxe 3xCD version (selling for around $40), but at least     the tactile document is something you can't get anywhere else.</p>
<p>That's not the case for the rest of this anniversary set. Even taking into     account the remastering, the long-available stereo edition of <i>Piper</i> can now be     discounted as little more than a novelty. Yet you can only buy the mono version on its own through iTunes. Double-dipping is     one thing; compelling fans to double-dip is another, and the unavailability of     the mono version as a stand-alone CD purchase is the kind of move that all     but goads downloaders to do exactly what their gut tells them to do. Maybe Pink Floyd can't be bothered to troll through the BBC archives for live material, footage or lost tapes, or bake old masters to their sonic     satisfaction, but certainly they can hire someone to do it for them. The appetite     is there, which makes such a banal celebration of this psychedelic masterwork     so disappointing.</p></div>"|10643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10643-the-piper-at-the-gates-of-dawn-40th-anniversary-edition/|9.4|Joshua Klein

Gee, you think so? Polyvinyl might as well sell shotguns and say ""this product, when pointed at the face and fired, may cause slight dizziness and nausea."" You see, this Torontonian group isn't just bummed; their sickly, sparse acoustic/string arrangements are where sappy ballads and uplifting paeans go to die. They mine music from the most extreme intersection of beauty and melancholy.</p><p>
    Thanks to some auspicious festival slots and favorable internet buzz, <em>Whore</em> <em>Luck</em> finds Picastro getting called up from the rookie leagues to indie's AA level. Fittingly, their third album features chic cameos from Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart and ex-member Owen Pallett of Final Fantasy fame, along with covers of Roky Erickson and the Fall tunes. However, frontwoman Liz Hysen hardly curbs her fragile dementia in the face of this newfound exposure, instead sounding just as terrified of the world as ever. Thanks to the additions of cellist Nick Storring and drummer Brandon Valdivia, Hysen's dark ballads can explore even deeper and more labyrinthine caverns, and <em>Whore</em> <em>Luck</em> often finds itself, for better or worse, getting lost in these sonic regions.</p><p>
    Early on <em>Whore Luck</em>, the difference is marginal. As opening tracks ""Hortur"" and ""Car Sleep"" demonstrate, creepy acoustic strumming still drives Picastro's songs, with timely cymbal crashes and moaning strings picking up the dramatic slack for Hysen's signature listless vocals. Not to be confused with My Brightest Diamond or Cat Power though, the lush arrangements quickly vaporize into a paranormal haze, Hysen's zombie-like delivery eschewing melodic delicacy in favor of soulless experimentation and-- for all we know-- feasting on human brains. Her take on Roky Erickson's ""If You Have Ghosts"" sucks out the song's flower power, replacing Erickson's pysch framework with a pump organ-led haunted house ambiance that very literally interprets the track's title. Brief ditties ""Towtruck"" and ""Stair Keeper"" follow, relying on the same pizzicato plucking and tape hissing used to frighten trick-or-treaters approaching your front porch.</p><p>
    Despite these bells and whistles, the band gels enough here to produce its most syncretic material yet. When Picastro co-opt the Fall's early gem ""An Older Lover Etc."" (titled ""Older Lover"" on <em>Whore Luck</em>), Hysen boils the song's melody down to a ritualistic chant, fading in and out of the spotlight amidst Stewart's trembling croons and Storring's schizo arrangements. Although Picastro still struggle to justify their maddening paucity as a stylistic choice versus their paucity as cover for lack of ideas, <em>Whore Luck</em>'s growing pains appear as proof that the band still has room to grow and is headed in the right direction.</p></div>"|10657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10657-whore-luck/|7.0|Adam Moerder

    When it comes to hip-hop, North Carolina's latitude, which puts it squarely between the genre's temples in the Northeast and the Deep South, makes it tough to align with a Billboard-proven aesthetic. You can almost see the map, part of a PowerPoint slideshow in some major label conference room. But Brother Reade-- aka Jimmy Jamz and producer Bobby Evans, a DJ-MC partnership in the mold of Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince-- don't believe it's so black and white. After joining forces in Winston-Salem under the banner of punk rock, they later traded rowdiness, on 2005's <em>The Illustrated Guide To: 9 to 5</em> EP, for ragged warmth and an unassumingly witty, everyman charm. But after programming beats in the land of Nascar, Jamz and Evans eventually fled to Los Angeles.</p><p>
    ""Like Duh"", the first single off <em>Rap Music</em>, their full-length debut, sticks it to their adopted home. A typical couplet: ""Nobody walks in L.A./ Nobody got a job in L.A."" Laziness is a target in their caricature of the city-- equal parts ""Entourage"" and <em>Annie Hall</em>-- but so is attitude. Jamz counsels a starry-eyed youngster that, in this glitzy anti-utopia, he doesn't need to be rich or cool: he simply has to ""be the fuck-you."" His message of low-key rebelliousness calmly rehashes their old punk ethos: under the glare of Tinseltown, to be yourself, you have to incarnate subversion.</p><p>
    The tap-tap-tap of an organ keeps the mood, with the lyrics, far below the boiling point. Evans' mesmerizing work behind the boards quietly steals the show. He glides serenely between eerie, hallucinatory atmospherics-- the foundation of El-P's work-- and a bare-bones, Deep South take on boom-bap. And it suits the material. For example, ""Let's Go"" sits on top of a spartan, bleak pattern of thuds, a beat that suggests bricks banging around in a dryer. Somehow, its strangeness calls attention to itself without turning obnoxious, self-deprecating and self-aggrandizing at the same time, like Jamz's paradox of the middle-class MC: ""No trap fame, no crack cocaine/ But the world needs a Kurt Cobain with a chain.""
    </p>
<p>
    Yet unlike El-P, Evans lets the tracks breathe, and never succumbs to the former's fondness for nervous and suffocating density. Using a minimum of tools, he creates a glum grandeur without sacrificing clearness and capaciousness. It makes sense: this duo doesn't have El-P's acid and anger. They tell small stories. Apart from Eminem, whose hardscrabble Detroit origin myth was colorfully vindicated in <em>Eight Mile</em>, the white rapper seems de facto barred from overly gritty subjects. So they resort to the less sensational odysseys of everyday life, as Brother Reade does on ""Life Ain't Easy for Ya'll"" and ""The Marcie Song"", which tells a former sexist's Byzantine story of conversion from macho artist to feminist. Unfortunately the latter suffers from Jamz' rushing monotone, which outpaces the sleek, undulating synthesizer pulse.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Rap Music</em>: so standoffishly humble, so extravagantly matter-of-fact. But the duo made a very conscious decision with this title, and they bring the right attitude: respect. White guilt plays a complicated role, as usual. Hip-hop has a grand history, beyond just rapping, and naturally opportunists grind the term's meaning away when they use it as an easy stamp of authenticity. Radiating their usual mixture of entitlement and deference, in a Stop Smiling interview, Brother Reade elaborated. ""The authenticity of our music is not in question to me,"" they said. ""Our music is rap music.""

    Red Krayola's Mayo Thompson is classically pretentious-- ""We want to be dissidents of the people to whom we should most propitiously belong,"" he told Richie Unterberger in 1993-- but he's always been smart enough to realize that rock is an essentially dumb medium. When hippies ascended the throne in 1967, his response was called ""War Sucks"". <em>Kangaroo?</em>, a 1981 collaboration with conceptual artists Art &amp; Language about Marxism and creativity, pointed out that art didn't kill Jackson Pollock, a car crash did. Mayo Thompson, like Dan Bejar of Destroyer, doesn't take the poetry of counterculture lying down, damn it. Some bands are proud to buck trends, but Mayo's death drive is that he can't stop until he <em>challenges hegemony</em>, which is usually several steps after he's stopped making sense.</p><p>
    So call <em>Sighs Trapped by Liars</em> another exercise in hypothetical revolution. The lingua franca here is waifish folk-rock with a hint of psych-- Thompson's version of indie-pop, maybe. (There are are no less than five songs about the power of mirrors, and indie-pop is nothing without its propensity to reflect.) The band sometimes sounds a little too lax to be rebels, but they have moments, particularly the Byrdsian ""Fairest of All"" or the dissonant lounge-bossa of ""The Big Vacation"". Thompson has stepped down from the mic for the first time, leaving vocals to the sweet-sounding Elisa Randazzo and Sandy Yang. The swap makes Red Krayola softer on the ears, but washes out the charm Thompson's voice used to bring the recordings-- an aloof-sounding near-falsetto that fumbled through lines like they were going by too fast on a teleprompter. Lyrically, there's some inanity for spice (""Fuck the fucking cat"") and acid for levity (""There are 40,000 words on a chair""), but most of the liner notes scan with all the charm of a textbook. Of course, you could call the gap between Art &amp; Language's words and Thompson's childishly simple songs funny-- clever, even-- and it is. But you could also call it exhausting, which it can be after 45 minutes.</p><p>
    Either way, it's one of the band's more accessible releases, and it's better than Red Krayola's album from 2006, <em>Introduction</em>. Mayo Thompson's problem will never be relevance. He jumped into post-punk after years of silence and ended up playing with members of the Raincoats and Essential Logic; for a while, he played with Pere Ubu. In the 90s, he joined up with the avant-rock scene centered around Chicago, absorbing people like David Grubbs, John McEntire, and Jim O'Rourke (the latter two play here). Granted, that Chicago scene isn't exactly <em>au courant</em> anymore, but Thompson's kept up his quiet protest long enough to turn it into a kind of insular world, a cottage industry. (I sometimes wonder if his increasing solitude isn't just a sign that underground rock has lost a unifying drive.) He's been more focused in the past, but no doubt he'll find a world to define himself in opposition to again soon.<br/>

    its shaggy grace, love-is-life proclamations, and lengthy guest list (23 people,
    mostly BSS regulars, play or sing on the record), <em>Spirit If…</em> could pass
    for a relatively low-key follow-up to 2005's blown-out <em>Broken Social Scene</em>. But with Drew taking sole songwriting credit for half of the album's toned-down
    tracks and covering lead vocal duties on nearly every song, there's also a strong
    solo vibe. So, in essence, we get Kevin Drew's break-up record, as played by Broken Social Scene; it's a savvy compromise only a collective as familial as BSS could

    While the popularity of Broken Social Scene skyrocketed over the past four
    years, Drew remained something of an unknown thanks to the group's all-for-one

    during shows, and once described his band's objective to the<em> New York Times Magazine</em> with all
    the quixotic wonder of a wide-eyed Bono: ""We want to affect audiences' hearts
    and minds with honesty."" He's
    not afraid to include ""the kiss in Winnipeg""
    and ""the man who taught me love is free"" in his album's laundry list
    of thank you's. He's a modern hippie, though instead of
    growing up listening to the Grateful Dead and the Doors, Drew worshiped idols that fall
    squarely within the classic-rock-subverting indie canon: Sonic Youth,
    Pavement, and Dinosaur Jr. Consequently, <em>Spirit If…</em> offers jams that don't really
    jam, acoustic ballads about fights and lies, and lushly orchestrated songs that
    come together effortlessly while cracking up hopelessly. <span> </span><span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Toying with the idea of stops and starts, the record begins
    with a send-off and ends with a beginning. Alarm-clock opener ""Farewell to the Pressure
    Kids"" is a red herring: At first, its blasting intro (stuffed with vibes,
    avalanche drum fills, stacked guitars, and unintelligible vocals), seems to pick
    up right where <em>Broken Social Scene</em>'s epic closer ""It's All Gonna Break""
    left off. But, after two minutes of organized chaos, the song-- a cryptic
    exorcism decrying those who ""love to hate""-- settles into a homely,
    quiet groove more indicative of the record's unplugged ambiance. It's the sound of
    Drew deflating his own bombast in favor of a style that's more personal and direct.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The singer once said 2002's <em>You Forgot It In People</em>
    ""was made with hope"" while <em>Broken Social Scene</em> ""was made with
    fear."" <em>Spirit If…</em> was seemingly made with pained desperation. On the album, when Drew isn't pining
    over a ""fucked up kid"" amidst images of violence and death,
    he's confessing his sins while lamenting someone who's ""too beautiful
    to fuck."" His words can be frustratingly obtuse: ""Cats and Christ put you
    in a tiny box that's filled with all victims,"" goes one especially head-scratching
    line. But Drew's random imagery is often translated through straightforward
    hooks that wisely cut through the dense murk. So while the enlightenment-themed
    stand-out ""Bodhi Sappy Weekend"" includes boggling lyrics like,
    ""With our clothes on fire/ I guess we both can wait/ I built an ark for
    sure,"" the pleading refrain (""please don't scratch me out"") is
    crushing in its bluntness as it ties the tune together.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The lucidity of Drew's musical influences also lend <em>Spirit
    If…</em> an understood universality (within indie rock circles, at least): Much of the
    album could double as an early 90s our-band-could-be-your-life cassette mix. But there's a
    key difference to, say, <em>Spirit If...</em>'s Dinosaur Jr. tribute ""Backed Out on
    the…"" compared to every other Dino-aping rip-off out there: Drew actually
    recruited J Mascis to spew scalding distortion all over the track. The same first-hand method is employed on the
    album's only other out-and-out rocker, ""Lucky Ones"", which boasts
    some twisting Spiral Stairs-style guitar work from (yep) Spiral Stairs. The indie-star
    guests are just another example of Drew making the anything-goes BSS collective philosophy
    work for him-- and a great way to beat name-that-influence critics at their own
    game.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""The whole idea of starting or finishing something is
    one of the scariest things in the world to me,"" Drew told Pitchfork in
    2005. Recorded in a hotel room in Norway,
    the country-style ditty ""When It Begins"" is a fitting, clear-headed
    capper to the album that finds Drew facing his fears head-on. ""It's
    gonna be really hard when we get to the end/ Well, you love the start but
    really it's just to begin,"" he sings, accompanied by a little strumming
    and just a few singing Scene-sters. The song's circlular logic is an apt
    summation of it all-- the album, relationships, bands, tours, etc.-- at once almost
    naively common and, within the context of the record, disarmingly personal. Then there's the tattooed-heart kicker: ""But don't forget what you felt.""
    Confounding yet emotionally bare, derivative yet singular, profane yet
    child-like, solo yet not so solo, Kevin Drew doesn't shy away from his
    contradictions on <em>Spirit If…</em>. He revels in them.<span> </span><span> </span>

    Better on paper than in
    practice, glitch-hop was semi-hot around the turn of
    the decade, when hordes of electronic music listeners realized
    that IDM probably couldn't survive on sonic sculptury and naval-gazing alone.
    <span> </span>Musical Darwinism eventually won out,
    though, and after a few years' worth of dud records and even dudder MCing,
    glitch-hop eventually went the way of your garden variety Scott Herren
    pseudonym, never to be awkwardly nodded along to again.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    If you remember any of that, or worse yet, happened to be
    one of those gullible enough to part with your hard-earned money in exchange
    for some of those records (I'm
    fairly certain nobody more did than yours truly), the standard
    logline on Berlin's Modeselektor (""electronic + hip-hop fusion"") might be
    enough to give you the involuntary shivers. <span> </span>Truth is, though, these guys have moments
    where they're so good at what they do that they practically redeem the concept
    altogether.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span> </span>Modeselektor are Gernot
    Bronsert and Sebastian Szary. Although <em>Happy
    Birthday!</em> is only their second full-length, they've been recording together
    in various capacities for almost 15 years, a period during which they've taken
    a number of different detours ranging from acid to glitch-hop to IDM to offbeat
    electro. In Modeselektor, all of those influences have come to rest and congeal
    into a well-articulated and slightly sinister-sounding whole. But what's
    interesting about <em>Happy Birthday!</em>
    isn't just that it fuses together the most unfashionable or discarded elements of
    electronic music's recent history, but that it manages to sound so fresh in
    doing so. </p><p>
    Longer and less twitchy than its superb 2005 predecessor <em>Hello Mom!</em>, <em>Happy Birthday!</em>
    finds the duo stretching out its legs a little more. Where that fidgety debut
    was a minor triumph of ADD-addled production, the songs on <em>Happy Birthday!</em> are
    allowed to breathe and settle into a groove. The unrushed tone means that some of
    them end up working as mini-genre exercises. Tracks like ""BMI"" and ""Edgar"", for
    example, bear all of IDM's finely articulated sonic details. Elsewhere, hip-hop
    tracks like the TTC-aided ""200000"" and the Puppetmastaz-aided ""The Dark Side of the Sun"" throw back to glitch's digitally blenderized vocals. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Ultimately, it's Modeselektor's fidelity to the low end that
    ties this record together. Where a lot of that old school glitch and IDM stuff was
    traditionally terrible with unimportant things like, you know, basslines and
    rhythms, <em>Happy Birthday!</em> pretty much
    bangs. From the stuttering almost-booty beat of ""Hyper Hyper"" to ""Godspeed""s grinding
    synths to the fluttering ragga of resurrected oldie <span> </span>""Let Your Love Grow"", this is a record made
    with the dancefloor as much in mind as the bedroom. (And, speaking of the
    bedroom, it's also worth mentioning that vociferous Modeselektor fan Thom Yorke
    turns up to calmly and casually outdo at least half of <em>The Eraser</em> with the lovely penultimate ballad ""The White Light"".)
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    If there's one criticism to be made of <em>Happy Birthday!</em>, it's to do with its length. 70+ minute records are
    increasingly difficult to justify in the mp3 age, and, of course, this one isn't
    without its lulls either. You also have to wonder how such a heroic show of
    ranginess will position Modeselektor in techno's increasingly specialized and
    splintered landscape. (One local London zine recently described them as ""bassbin-blowing
    techno hop dubstep core"" which is scenester for ""fine, <em>you</em> file this"" if I've ever heard it.) Ultimately, though, I guess those
    concerns are for Bpitch's marketing department. So much of this record sounds utterly
    thrilling coming out of the speakers that it seems silly to quibble over
    something as boring as taxonomy.

<em>Allure</em> is the third and final installment in Fovea Hex's <em>Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent</em> trilogy, and it closes the captivating series with an impressive balance and symmetry. For this EP, the self-described ""ensemble of associates"" has undergone further cast changes, making the project's cohesion all the more remarkable. The primary constant, however, remains former Mellow Candle vocalist Clodagh Simonds, whose voice and koan-like songs anchor Fovea Hex's ambient drones with a deceptive simplicity and frequently breath-taking beauty.</p><p>
    The two previous EPs in the <em>Neither Speak</em> series, <em>Bloom</em> and <em>Huge</em>, had featured appearances by such luminaries as Brian Eno, the Hafler Trio's Andrew McKenzie, and film composer Carter Burwell. This time around, Simonds is joined by guitarist Robert Fripp, Nurse With Wound's Colin Potter, an assortment of Dublin-based improvisers, and-- perhaps most tellingly-- musician and wildlife author Geoff Sample who contributes field recordings of Moorland birds and lakewater. As with the earlier EPs, this rotating ensemble ensures a constant evolution of activity and texture within <em>Allure</em>'s three pieces, and yet each sound source is incorporated with such elegance that the whole eclectic group can appear to perform with a single, indivisible voice.</p><p>
    A palpable sense of loss and displacement has informed Simonds' songs throughout the <em>Neither Speak</em> recordings, and never more so than on <em>Allure</em>. ""I'm like a fish that's breathing sand, so longing"" she sings on the album's centerpiece ""Long Distance"", the stark emotion of her voice mirrored by Fripp's shimmering guitar figures and Michael Begg's piano treatments and ""melancholia implants."" As with her previous songs, the object of Simonds' longing is never given a specific name or identity, so ""Long Distance"" and the opening title track might be addressed to a missing lover, or they could be hymns from a disillusioned believer to an absent God. 
    </p>
<p>
    Throughout <em>Allure</em>, the various members of Fovea Hex continually bolster Simonds' songs with unexpected instrumental flourishes, as with Donal Lunny's exotic bodhrán on ""Long Distance"" or with the tasteful Celtic strings on ""Allure"". Intriguingly, Simonds and company have chosen to close out the album, and hence the entire trilogy, with the instrumental ""Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent"". Counterbalanced with Percy Jones' subaquatic bass and Sample's nature recordings, Simonds concludes this series with a prolonged, enigmatic whisper, one that can seem an alternately soothing and vaguely disquieting finale to Fovea Hex's adventure. 
    </p>
<p>
    Limited editions of <em>Allure </em>come packaged with the bonus disc <em>An Answer</em>, which features the EP's material re-mixed by Andrew McKenzie into a luminous, hour-length meditation. And now that the <em>Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent</em> series is finished, Fovea Hex also offers the three EPs together in a handsome boxed edition. Given the project's unified vision, this box set seems the best way to experience Fovea Hex, and putting these three EPs on in hypnotic succession can quite quickly become an addictive procedure. And though it might now appear that the group's work is complete, one can certainly hope that Simonds can someday find further alluring ways to put the Fovea Hex associates to use.

    From the Decemberists' belly-of-the-whale epics to Modest
    Mouse's existential oceans, from Alela Diane's yo-ho-ho choruses to Oh No! Oh
    My!'s pirate anthem, nautical themes have become so prevalent in current indie
    mythology that it's enough to make you seasick. But Port O'Brien has earned the
    right to the salt-crusted imagery adorning its first full-length, <em>The Wind and the Swell</em>, as well as to the
    numerous mentions of seas and oceans and fishing boats and puffins in these
    jagged, intelligent indie-folk songs. Port O'Brien mainstay Van Pierszalowski,
    a California native and son of a
    commercial fisherman, spends his summers aboard an Alaskan salmon schooner, either
    fighting the seas or bored in port if the weather's bad. He named the band
    after an Alaskan port, uses photos of his father's crew as album art, and keeps
    a detailed ship's blog on the group's web site.</p><p>
    But <em>The Wind and the
    Swell</em>, which collects the group's first two out-of-print releases on one
    disc, sounds like a much better journal of days at sea. Like most tracks, opener
    ""I Woke Up Today"" could be a sea-legs lament: ""Yes I understand I cannot live
    on this land,"" Pierszalowski sings, ""but does that truly mean I have seen all
    that can be seen?"" The song is all windworn surfaces: the guitars sound rough
    and creaky, the voices cracked but resolute. These same lyrics repeat on the
    sparse closer ""Simple Way"",
    which slows the tempo and pares down the music: instead of a stormy passage, the
    song fades gradually, like land disappearing on the horizon.</p><p>
    Port O'Brien's first LP, <em>When
    the Rain Comes,</em> from 2005, was a set of mostly acoustic songs featuring
    Pierszalowski on acoustic guitar, reflecting the outfit's more-or-less solo
    origins. The recording is blunt and primitive, perfect for Pierszalowski's
    then-unrefined songwriting. ""Five and Dime"", his wordiest composition, reckons
    with his own wanderlust: ""It kills me to think that straight lines have taken
    over the life I've led,"" he sings as the song veers suddenly into a relentless
    road-trip strum. The band's 2006 EP <em>Nowhere
    to Run</em> keeps the rough aesthetic and unflinching self-examination in place,
    but elaborates on them in intriguing musical ways: adding new sounds and more instruments,
    honing the lyrics to be more teasingly indirect, and benefiting greatly from
    the presence of Cambria Goodwin, whose sharp vocals and percussive banjo color ""I
    Woke Up Today"" and her own ""Tree Bones"". 
    </p>
<p>
    On <em>The Wind and the
    Swell,</em> instead of presenting each release in its original tracklist order,
    as if they're two sides of the same album, Pierszalowski resequences the songs
    to highlight the contrasts between the two sets. This tack, despite its minor limitations
    (gone are the scraps of stray song interspersed between the ""real"" tracks from <em>Nowhere to Run</em>), distracts from the
    weaknesses of early tracks and emphasizes the seaworthiness of later songs like
    ""Tree Bones"" and ""A Bird Flies By"". In the process, <em>The Wind and the Swell</em> builds and fades, suggesting a landlocked
    anomie that only the ocean can assuage: ""And I just wanna be floating on the
    sea,"" Pierszalowski sings on ""Anchor"", ""with my anchor tied to land."" The
    product of days and days at sea, <em>The Wind
    and the Swell</em> retains the songs' original documentary impact, even as it shows
    that Pierszalowski's music is less about seafaring summers than simple
    remoteness, both geographical and emotional.

    It's hard to question someone's judgement when they've been responsible for a pretty good run of quality material, especially when he's giving some shine to his friends. Raekwon hasn't had the extended streak of holy-shit greatness that fellow Wu-Tang members Ghostface and GZA have, but he started a legacy with <em>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</em>-- a coke-rap catalyst so widely revered that people are still fiending for the long-delayed sequel-- and if later solo records <em>Immobilarity </em>and <em>The Lex Diamond Story</em> aren't nearly as acclaimed, they're at least good enough to keep the Chef from staining his rep. So when he says in interviews that the Ice Water crew are on his level, another dynasty, that no big-name stars would be seen collaborating with them if they weren't real on some level...shit, he had enough faith in these dudes to mentor them, tutor them, even let 'em share a name with one of the sickest tracks from <em>Cuban Linx</em>; better give him benefit of the doubt.</p><p>
    Don't strain yourself too hard, because the doubt will set in about four tracks in to <em>Polluted Water</em>. Ice Water has kicked around Staten Island spitting thug raps for a while, with one of the members, Raekwon's longtime friend Polite, having ricocheted through assorted Wu-family offshoots. Polite could've theoretically joined the Wu at the beginning if he wasn't in prison at the time the group was formed, but he went on to pay dues in American Cream Team and an early version of Ghostface Killah's Theodore Unit, so he's got some mileage. It's easy to recognize Polite amongst the other members of Ice Water, not necessarily because of his voice-- which is authoritative in a fairly indistinct way--  but because he's the member that isn't in over his head.</p><p>
    The other three MCs debuted on <em>The Lex Diamond Story</em> and proved to be less memorable than the skit where the dude gets killed by chimpanzees. They've hardly improved here: Stomach starts hitching for breath by the end of his verses, apparently a sign that dumb punchlines (""They said I'm wylin'/ Plus I'm from the Island, somethin' like Gilligan"") and uncreative threats (""I'm spittin' ammunition, now your man is missin'/ And your body gets found by an old man fishin'"") can be a heftier workout than previously thought. The crew is rounded out by Paulie Caskets and Donnie Cash, who go by the helpful abbreviations P.C. and D.C. (as if they weren't interchangeable enough) and generally jockey for position as to who can spend more time being an indistinct third-verse tough guy. (P.C. at least gets points for his what-the-fuck ambush-job verse in ""Click Click"": ""Everybody in the spot thought that I was a chick, I played it so cool/ Sippin' a martini with a wig on."")</p><p>
    And they rarely have anything illuminating to say: Ice Water have exact same hey-didja-remember-when BDP/Kane/MC Shan rap nostalgia as everyone else (""Hip-Hop Tribute""), the same complaints about golddiggers (""Love Don't Cost [A Thing]""), the same I-push-weight swagger (the entire middle third of the album). Their ordinariness is thrown into greater relief when the guests come filing in, Raekwon himself chief among them. Rae's got seven guest spots on a 17-track album, and he's consistently good, not just compared to the headliners but in keeping with his typical material; when he spits status raps on ""Do It Big"" alongside a grimy Busta Rhymes or cases a joint in ""Click Click"", it lends weight to an overlong record that desperately needs it.</p><p>
    But it's impossible to pin everything that goes wrong during this album on Ice Water themselves. The production is scattershot and almost uniformly irritating, with the soulful, Marvin Gaye-derived ""Mercy Me"" and the grindhouse funk of ""Let's Get It"" the closest the album comes to any sort of Wu atmosphere. Everything else sounds like mercenary club music, indecisive as to whether it wants to be Dirty South or thugged-out NYC. Most of the production pushes towards straight-up annoyance (re ""I'm a Boss"": Oh, so <em>that's</em> why some people hate Rick Ross) when, like the quarter-assed g-funk of ""Actin' Fly"" or the tinkly Jim Henson's G-Unit Babies non-bump of ""Gangsta"", it isn't busy being too perfunctory to even register as anything other than a half-step above a click track. Still, while you can't blame all the bad beats and the lyrical dullness on Raekwon himself, it's pretty obvious that Ice Water's mentor still has a whole lot of lessons to teach them.

    History's pegged Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers as proto-punk, but it's only been with the benefit of hindsight that his music has found a place at all. Like fellow ships at sea the Stooges, the New York Dolls, or the Velvet Underground, there was no precedent for what Richman was up to, nor was there much of a declared intent behind it. The Modern Lovers, like all of those other acts, were a rock band first and foremost. They played rock'n'roll.  How others defined them was out of their hands.</p><p>
    Punk's rallying cry remains the ""1-2-3-4!"" count-off, but it's obvious that there's more to Richman when he gleefully keeps counting up to six on ""Roadrunner"". That track kicks off the Modern Lovers' self-titled debut, the impact of which has rippled through the work of fans as diverse as the Sex Pistols, Brian Eno, NPR fixture Sarah Vowell, sly subversives Art Brut, and lovesick crooner Jens Lekman. Back at the beginning, though, it was all about Richman, his insular world, and specifically his own obsession with the then-novel Velvet Underground, an appreciation he brought back home to Massachusetts after a trip to New York in the late 1960s.</p><p>
    You can hear the Velvets coursing though the Modern Lovers' debut-- impossibly out of print in the U.S. for nearly 20 years-- and not just because most of it was produced by John Cale (notorious impresario Kim Fowley gets credited with a couple of tracks, too). Richman had an innate knack for the Velvets' chugging drones, except rather than explore the dark stuff as Lou Reed did, Richman aims (mostly) for a certain innocence and naivete that's often at odds with the music itself. Indeed, Richman would switch gears before the album's belated release, and he all but disowned the harsher original sound of the Modern Lovers after shifting to softer, gentler sounds. 
    </p>
<p>
    That belated release originally came in 1976 through the Beserkley label-- three years after most of the material had been recorded and two years after the original Lovers had broken up-- and these songs have been released in several forms since. Ratifying Richman's role as some sort of pioneer, what sounded revolutionary in the early 70s still worked in the late 70s, and endures as something special to this day. In fact, ""Roadrunner"" alone would have been enough to solidify his legacy: Its rinky-dink organ, Richman's stuffed-up nasal delivery and rudimentary ""Sister Ray"" guitars remain the perfect synthesis of garage rock sensibilities and nascent punk rule-breaking.
    </p>
<p>
    ""I'm in love with the radio on/ It helps me from being alone at night!"" exhorts Richman in his half spoken/have sung voice as he hurtles down the highway like the titular bird (or at least its Looney Tunes equivalent). ""I'm in love with rock'n'roll and I'll be out all night!"" It's the perfect encapsulation of rock's romance and power, captured in a compact song so great it could honestly go on forever and keep you in the car until it's run its course (or at least until you've run out of gas).
    </p>
<p>
    The rest of <em>The Modern Lovers</em> is just as good, if slightly less eternal (the same goes for the alternate version included as a bonus track). ""Pablo Picasso"" is a hilarious take on the notorious painter's womanizing ways and their unsuitableness for the real world (""Some people try to pick up girls and get called an asshole/ This never happened to Pablo Picasso""), with Richman mixing envy, pity and disdain. ""I'm Straight"" is nervous nice-guy geek-rock that presages the Talking Heads (who, of course, eventually enlisted Modern Lover Jerry Harrison), and finds Richman touting his squareness the way others play up their bad-boy cool. On ""Girl Friend"", he innocently but earnestly craves companionship for his walks through the Fenway and the Museum of Fine Arts.
    </p>
<p>
    During the ""Old World"", Richman extols the virtues of his parents' generation and pledges to maintain those bygone ways in the present. But on ""Modern World"", he's just as enthusiastic about 1970s America: ""Well, the modern world is not so bad/ Not like the students say,"" he sings. ""In fact, I'd be in heaven/ If you'd share the modern world with me."" Even when he's trying to get some in ""Astral Plane"" (""I know we've been together just this week!""), his desperation comes off charming, especially when it's paired with his ""Someone I Care About"" confession: ""What I want is a girl that I care about/ Or I want nothing at all."" </p><p>
    What reads as contradiction is simply one effect of Richman's irresistible inclusiveness. It's what sets him apart from the Velvets, the Ramones, the Stooges and the like-- acts attracted to themes that matched their ragged sounds. Richman's music is tough, but he is not. He loves the old world, he loves the modern world. He loves rock'n'roll, he loves girls, he loves America, and most importantly, he loves you. Leave the anomie of ""1969"", the sleaze of ""Waiting for the Man"", or the mean streets of ""53rd &amp; 3rd"" to the tough guys. Richman wants to rock you just like all the others, but he also wants to give you a big hug when he's done.

    By now, Rogue Wave has had some time to get used to being a band. The quartet didn't actually debut until Rogue Wave's second album-- Zach Rogue
    recorded the first one, 2004's <em>Out of the
    Shadow</em>, mostly on his own. In the two years since <em>Descended Like Vultures</em>, the group has seemingly worked on honing a
    consistent sound for itself, and the result, <em>Asleep at Heaven's Gate</em>, is their dreamiest
    and loudest LP yet. The album has some sonic parallels with vintage Built to
    Spill, especially in the way the vocals are layered, but it's not quite as
    direct as that band's more classic rock-derived songwriting.</p><p>
<em>Asleep at Heaven's Gate</em> has a different, more pointedly ascendant feel
    from the outset. ""Harmonium"" is over six minutes of alternately drifting and
    pounding space-pop. The verses slip quietly along on Patrick Abernethy's
    echoing piano part, and the surrounding passages take a descending guitar motif
    to the rafters, with Pat Spurgeon hammering every beat with his kick drum, then
    later on the snare as Rogue and Gram LeBron lay down sheets of astral guitar. Those
    glittering passages are the blueprint for ""Chicago x 12,"" which ends with a cut-tempo coda
    featuring whale-song guitars and gets there with guitar- and keyboard-soaked
    verses powered by snares on every beat.</p><p>
    The album's highlight comes with the vigorously
    strummed waltz ""Lake Michigan"", featuring
    Rogue's layered vocals singing a tumbling melody over an acoustic guitar and
    forcefully recorded drums. Clouds of clean-toned electric guitar and Wurlitzer
    float in the background, dripping with reverb. ""Christians in Black"", one of
    the album's two spare, pared-back tracks, brings the album's first half to a
    captivating, almost bucolic close, featuring little more than Rogue and some
    richly toned acoustic guitar. 
    </p>
<p>
    The problem with <em>Asleep at Heaven's Gate</em> is that the second
    half isn't nearly as strong as the first. ""Own Your Own Home"" sounds like
    it's working toward a big, majestic passage on its chorus, but instead of
    following through on the crescendo, the muscular drums and piano just drop back
    into the two-stepping verse, and ultimately, an unresolved coda. Closer ""Cheaper Than Therapy"" does
    manage to showcase some inspired guitar work, but the vocal melody goes nowhere.
    </p>
<p>
    It's a shame the record falls off like it does, because <em>Asleep at Heaven's Gate</em> opens by promising a
    truly excellent album featuring a couple of Rogue Wave's best songs to date. It's
    not even that any of the tracks in the second half are bad-- just mostly
    unremarkable. Still, even taking the late fade into account, those who appreciated the
    first two Rogue Wave albums will find something here to like, and the best
    songs are worth anyone's while.

    ""I Just Called to Say I Love You""-- not the saccharine
    Stevie Wonder hit, but the track from Pelle Carlberg's second solo album, <em>In a Nutshell</em>-- is the rare song that
    seems to perfectly encapsulate the mindset of a striving indie musician, which is
    another way of saying that it's just like any other Carlberg song. The Swedish
    pop artist, who formerly fronted the band Edson, writes imaginatively and
    wittily about his own career travails as well as the predicaments that accompany life in the pop trenches. But ""I Just
    Called to Say I Love You"", which does in fact reference the Wonder song, is
    particularly trenchant, in Carlberg's typically humorous way: ""If I ever get
    happy, my songs will start to suck,"" he sings over chipper folk-pop accompaniment.
    ""But if I ever get happy, I won't give a fuck."" He'd sell out if he could find
    someone to buy in, but in the meantime, he realizes his struggles are pretty
    funny, which only makes them sadder. Which only makes them funnier.</p><p>
    It's not for lack of trying. Just as he did on his previous
    solo effort, 2005's <em>Everything. Now!</em>
    (which has the excellent critic takedown ""Go to Hell, Miss Rydell""), Carlberg
    not only wrote all the songs, but also played most of the instruments,
    recorded the damn thing, produced it, mixed it, posed for the photos, and
    probably burned the files to disc with his eyeball lasers. Even with help from
    fellow Swede Henrik Nilsson, that's no small feat considering the busyness of
    most of these songs. Opener ""Pamplona""
    involves a choir and members of the Academic Orchestra of Stockholm, even
    though he apparently runs with the bulls to prove he's not twee. ""I Love You,
    You Imbecile"" features a charming duet with Norwegian singer Ida Maria, and Carlberg
    is gentleman enough to let her steal the show-- although she sounds like she'd
    take it from him anyway. On the other hand, Carlberg is not averse to dialing
    everything down to just him and a piano or a guitar, as he does on ""Why Do
    Today What You Can Put Off Until Tomorrow?"" or the title track. Despite the
    threadbare cliché of its title (and Carlberg is careful enough to realize that
    bareness), ""Even a Broken Clock (is Right Twice a Day)"" makes his observations
    about his aging mother sound completely devastating.</p><p>
    That's one of the few tracks that doesn't address some
    aspect of his musical life, which he frets is sending him to the poorhouse: ""If
    I couldn't sing, I'd probably make decent money,"" he sings on ""Crying All the
    Way to the Pawnshop"", which strikes the best balance between tremendously funny
    and tremendously sad, even if the title gives away the punchline. ""Middleclass
    Kid"" is a Peter Paul &amp; Mary-style folk-pop number that describes his
    middle-class upbringing (""My mother was a housewife/ My dad worked for a
    bank""), then admits mock-proudly that his music can only appeal to middle-class
    kids like himself: ""I can hear you in the first row/ I can hear you in the
    second row/ Tell me! Do you feel it too?"" Probably great live, too.
    </p>
<p>
    These worries are no less real for being so well-expressed.
    ""Showercream and Onions"" details the hostility in his marriage, most likely
    fueled by his financial unfeasibility: ""We're trying to lose some of that
    hatred/ But maybe it is way too late."" <em>In
    a Nutshell </em>suggests his choice is obvious: music or happiness. If only it
    were that easy.

    Tujiko Noriko's songs have an origami-like quality: cute and delicate, with a sense of flatness given shape. After hopping from label to label, and dabbling in filmmaking, she has come to Editions Mego, the reconfigured version of the Viennese label that released her gorgeous 2001 album <em>Shojo Toshi</em>, to put out the aptly titled <em>Solo</em>. Mellower than her past two Mego releases, her new record finds Noriko going it alone, contorting the level planes of pop with her mobile, avant-garde imagination.</p><p>
    Sounding like a patchwork of radio static, outdoor sounds, snippets of recorded strums, and the naked human voice, her music might be captured transmissions from the id, an amalgam of airwave junk reconstituted as art. Earthly nature sneaks in: The synthesizers approximate birds chirping and insects skittering (""Sun!""), burps and bowel movements (""Gift""). Add the warm rushes of melody, and you have Noriko's brand of Rabelaisian science fiction for the ears: a warble that softly grades into a dirty, otherworldly terrain.</p><p>
    Not that the city lights of her native Japan and adopted France, past and present, don't spill through the haze. There's a sultry, moonlit glimmer to ""Spot"" that would fit nicely inside French chanson, but that's it for one-to-one parallels. When asked by Japanese magazine Shift how Paris has shaped her music, Noriko free-associated a better answer: ""Desolation, lassitude, reactionary."" Copyrighted, potentially, as Mitt Romney's campaign slogan, the three enigmatic nouns capture the breeze of post-riot, Chirac-era pessimism blowing through her album's happy textures.
    </p>
<p>
    If France imparts mood, Japan lends order. Unlike Björk, whose glacier-shattering contralto tends to tyrannize her tracks, Noriko's humbler voice melts discreetly into a democracy of sound. Both women use their voices as instruments, but Noriko views her own merely as one among many: first among equals. So, you might say, she shares more with her fellow Japanese artists, the generation that includes Sachiko M, the onkyo queen of texture, ambient idol Miharu Sochi, and After Dinner's Haco, the rock star turned sound bricoleur.
    </p>
<p>
    There is a healthy amount of disorder, too: As Noriko's fans would expect, <em>Solo</em> avoids the schematic here-to-there, beeline routes of Japanese pop. ""Spot"" may come the closest. Flickering inside these songs are the surreal motions of mental wanderlust, a weighty randomness that suggests the dislocations and spasms of reverie. Like the paper crane, like a dream, the wonders of <em>Solo</em> are rooted in metamorphosis.
    </p>
<p>
    By turns tender and abstract, tracks like ""Ending Kiss"" (where she teams up with Hideki Ataka) and ""In a Chinese Restaurant"" seem to endlessly outpace expectations. They begin roughly as ballads, before off-time drums, thundering like distant artillery, rattle the pop scaffolding loose. We try to predict the next twist, how Noriko will dynamite whatever ornate façade she's been hand-crafting carefully before us.
    </p>
<p>
    With the opening track's overlapping evolutions-- from whispery sing-speak into delicate coos into multitracked echoes, from clicks and knocks into shakers and rewound samples-- we should have been prepared for the zigzagged road ahead. Noriko is too inventive, too capricious, or simply too short on concentration, for our sluggish brains to catch up.

    Hopefully this won't confuse anyone, but that 5.5 up there needs an asterisk. Not that it isn't a suitable final score-- it is if you listen to and consume previously-unheard records on a throw-on-and-play basis, especially if you spend a lot of time paying pinpoint attention to everything the record does and eventually wind up disassembling everything to its component parts to try and figure out what makes it tick. And what makes the new album by Montreal producer Sixtoo tick is an elusive, scattershot bucket of parts-- a collection of live-show instrumentation detritus sewn together via sampling into a serviceable noir-beat record that, being voiceless and largely nameless (track titles go from ""Part 1"" to ""Part 13""), comes across as vague and incomplete.</p><p>
    The thing is, <em>Jackals and Vipers in Envy of Man</em> is the kind of vague and incomplete music that, instead of immediately boring and/or frustrating you, has just enough intrigue to serve as what would seem to be reasonably unobtrusive background music. And there's where the asterisk comes in: to fully appreciate <em>Jackals and Vipers</em>, your mind needs to be elsewhere. It might help a little to consider Sixtoo's possible aesthetic mindset beforehand: the first five influences listed on his MySpace page refer to 1960s and 70s experimental rock, Yakuza films, the biker gang-fueled ""North American lower-middle class hustle,"" muscle cars, and Italian scooters-- which simultaneously says nothing and everything about his musical philosophy. But those kind of background details might work a bit too much towards coloring expectations, and the less detail that goes with listening to this album, the better.</p><p>
    While the main ingredients sometimes come together to form an obvious sonic shorthand-- a few of the basslines and drum breaks are right out of a dozen-year-old My First Tricky Knockoff Starter Kit-- the stuff that sneaks in through the margins while you're not paying attention (or at least paying attention to the wrong thing) is what actually maintains interest. Tune out ""Part 4""'s beat and its try-too-hard attempts to sound gloomily intense, and you can catch the glimmers of hypnotic piano (provided by Belgian jazz composer Jef Neve) and a quivering, distorted sound like some sort of string instrument being run through a paint shaker. 
    </p>
<p>
    The unremarkable faux-""Levee"" break in ""Part 2"" dominates just enough to make the mid-song manipulation of the thumb piano that opened it into a subtle undercurrent of a hook. And even if it's frequently in the service of beats that do little to actually ramp up dynamics or drop in any real surprises, the production and atmosphere have the ideal level of haze, incorporating unobtrusive elements of dub and coating everything with a layer of grit that makes everything from ""Part 1""'s bombed-out jukebox acid-soul to ""Part 13""'s baroquely psychedelic electric piano refractions sound like some resurrected ephemera that just clawed its way out of a coffin. (It's not entirely clear how pristine the source material may have sounded, but given its live-show origins, there's a chance that this album is one of those rare works to benefit from a poor soundboard recording.)
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, whatever flaws lie in <em>Jackals and Vipers</em> are inextricably tied into the circumstances in which you listen to it-- if you're drunk or stoned or playing video games or otherwise half-listening with an uncritical ear (which, let's be honest, is how most writers consume music when they're not reviewing it), it'll range somewhere between inoffensive and mildly alluring. It's the kind of soundtrack that could make movies more suspenseful, late night drives moodier and walks brisker-- just don't bring it to the foreground, or it'll lose everything.<br/>

And earlier this year, when British advertising firm Saatchi + Saatchi appropriated his image for a controversial Doc Martens campaign, the ensuing uproar-- and subsequent withdrawal of the ads-- showed that Cobain's non-conformist ideals could still redeem him from beyond the grave.</p><p>
    Of course, as the legacies of Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix have shown, it's inevitable that a brief superstar music career will be transformed into a sustainable, posthumous cottage industry that sells myth as merch. But in Cobain's case that process has been particularly accelerated: In the past decade we've already seen a hackneyed conspiracy-theory documentary (Nick Broomfield's <em>Kurt and Courtney</em>), a thorough, sensitive biography (Charles Cross' <em>Heavier Than Heaven</em>), the 2002 publication of Cobain's journals and a demo-saturated three-CD Nirvana box set (2004's <em>With the Lights Out</em>) that felt more like an invasive, archeological excavation than a definitive overview of a band's work.</p><p>
    So what can AJ Schnack's new Cobain documentary, <em>About a Son</em>, contribute to this hagiography? Unlike the aforementioned works, it has the uncanny effect of making its subject seem like he's still alive. By setting revelatory audio interviews with Cobain-- conducted by writer Michael Azerrad for his 1993 Nirvana book, <em>Come as You Are</em>-- to contemporary, serene images of the cities he inhabited (Aberdeen, Olympia and Seattle), the film relates Cobain's experiences in those places to the faces of those who live there today, suggesting a history that's still in the process of being written. And it does this without ever showing Cobain's face (at least not till the credits) or using a note of his music on the soundtrack.</p><p>
    Following a suitably melancholic acoustic overture by Steve Fisk and Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard, <em>About a Son</em> itemizes the significant phases in Cobain's life with the songs that soundtracked them: his blue-collar background (Arlo Guthrie's ""Motorcylce Song"", CCR's ""Up Around the Bend""), his punk-rock epiphanies (the Melvins' ""Eye Flys"" and Bad Brains' ""Banned in DC""), his equally fervent embrace of K Records-style naïve-pop (Half Japanese's ""Put Some Sugar On It"" and future Nirvana cover ""Son of a Gun"" by the Vaselines) and his idealized notion of fusing post-hardcore dissonance with classic-rock conventions (epitomized here by Butthole Surfers' ""Graveyard"" and Scratch Acid's ""Owner's Lament"", the latter of which Cobain describes as ""like an Aerosmith song, but really fucked up."") Mixed with excerpted conversations from the film, the overall effect is essentially that of a Cobain-curated edition of <em>Late Night Tales</em> or <em>Back to Mine</em>-- and makes for a handy crash course in 1980s underground rock for new Nirvana fans who've never filled out a Touch &amp; Go mail-order form.</p><p>
    But as the storyline progresses toward Nirvana's major-label courtship and post-<em>Nevermind</em> success, the song selection becomes more symbolic than biographical, and the relationship between the film and soundtrack album becomes more muddled, due to a lack of explanatory commentary. Though the soundtrack features various Cobain quotes about fame and media scrutiny, it skips over key, candid conversations about falling in love with Courtney (perfectly soundtracked in the film by Teenage Fanclub's ""Star Sign"", which isn't featured here), his heroin use and disillusionment with Nirvana.</p><p>
    The inclusion of David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"" and Leadbelly's ""Bourgeois Blues"" speak for themselves as narrative devices, but the appearance of Iggy Pop's outsider anthem ""The Passenger"" feels random when heard without Cobain's accompanying story about an awkward meeting with Capitol Records. And while Mark Lanegan's 1990 ballad ""Museum"" makes for a fitting credit-roll hymn, the album is appended with a campfire singalong from Gibbard, a cover of Beat Happening's ""Indian Summer"". Its appearance here seems almost incongruous given its unabashedly sentimental presentation, and the fact that other, more representative songs from the film (Queen's ""It's Late"", the Breeders' ""Iris"") didn't make the album cut. It's not always a soundtrack's job to tell the exact same story of its film, but with a more considered use of contextual quotes and a slightly more expanded song selection, <em>About a Son</em> could've achieved that ultimate ideal of a soundtrack that makes those who haven't seen the film feel like they have.</p></div>"|10599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10599-kurt-cobain-about-a-son/|7.0|Stuart Berman

    Musically speaking, there was never anything separating Hot Hot Heat from a mainstream audience.  Their excellent debut album, <em>Make Up the Breakdown</em>, was slick by design, danceable and melodic, tightly wound and exciting. It also showed a band pushing up against the limits of its own talent and experience, not afraid to write a verse with one too many rhyming couplets or to risk a potentially embarrassing affectation.  The record had its share of clunky moments for sure, but they never interfered with its accessibility.  If anything, Hot Hot Heat's enthusiastic and unapologetic overreaching helped cement their charms.</p><p>
    On their major label debut, <em>Elevator</em>, Hot Hot Heat backed off the adventurousness, and the results were slicker but far less inviting. Though more ostensibly ""commercial,"" the album failed to differentiate the band from any other fresh-faced new-new wavers crowding the marketplace.  It'd be easy to write off Hot Hot Heat using the ""used to sound like indie band X and now sounds like mainstream band Y"" formula, but that's not the problem: Indie, mainstream, or otherwise, Hot Hot Heat came onto the scene as a band willing to sacrifice personal cool to make their contagiously spazzy musical vision a reality, but compromised their appeal in the name of broader accessibility.</p><p>
    Album number three, <em>Happiness, Ltd.</em>, unfortunately continues that trend. The chiming guitars and steady, propulsive drumming of the record's opening title track brings to mind the Walkmen-- a far cry from the brainy pop of their original influences, Elvis Costello and XTC. Doe-eyed singer Steve Bays can still write a hooky melody, but where his voice was once brash and uninhibited, it now sounds coldly detached from the monolithic instrumentation of his talented bandmates. The tense, engaging interplay of <em>Make Up the Breakdown</em> has left the band completely, likely owing in part to the departure of Dante DeCaro (later of Wolf Parade and Johnny &amp; the Moon) and his deft, spiky guitar parts.  Lead single ""Let Me In"" builds to an energetic chorus, but it's a rote, one-dimensional energy-- predictable and overdetermined to the point of total inanity. Indeed, much of <em>Happiness Ltd.</em> suffers from one of the cardinal sins of radio-ready rock: stuffing unmemorable verses between overblown choruses.</p><p>
    In a sense, <em>Happiness Ltd.</em> is Hot Hot Heat's most ambitious record, full of string sections and expensive production tricks. The multitracked drums on ""Harmonicas and Tambourines"" sound particularly massive and forceful, and the fuzzed-out ambience of ""Outta Heart"" evokes the slinky dourness of Marc Bolan's ballads.  But while bands like Spoon use studio wizardry to expose and enhance different facets of their songs, the bells and whistles here never reveal anything about the music itself: ""Harmonicas and Tambourines"" still tries to fills out bland verses with big choruses, and ""Outta Heart"" is still aimless and overlong.</p><p>
    A re-recorded version of ""5 Times out of 100""-- originally from the band's debut EP, <em>Knock Knock Knock</em>-- speaks to the ups and downs of their new direction.  While the new version is rhythmically steadier than its predecessor, and works in a wider spectrum of sounds and textures, it lacks the unhinged urgency that made the song so irresistible in the first place.  Without the band charging ahead at full-blast, the song's structural awkwardness is all the more pronounced, and the playful swagger that carried Hot Hot Heat through their warts-and-all early work is sorely missed. While it's nice to hear them aiming for something so far-reaching and fully formed, <em>Happiness Ltd.</em> is ultimately a hollow facsimile of what they're really capable of.

    Though it has always been her pet project, Marie Daulne started Zap Mama as an a capella group of five women. Fifteen years later, it's become essentially a solo show for this Belgian-Congolese auteur. For Daulne's first album on Heads Up International, she sets out to topple false idols-- the forces of celebrity and late capitalism that are keeping many from, you know, being themselves. She even invented a word for the few rebels--and for her album's title. To the club of crunchy descriptors that includes ""free spirit"" and ""unique snowflake,"" Daulne lobbies to add ""supermoon.""</p><p>
    Even those without a Fox News paycheck may cringe at all this hippie-dippie preciousness, but <em>Supermoon</em>, unlike certain talk-show personalities, never sinks to hectoring. There's not a note of negativity for miles. Instead, the listener is borne aloft on good old-fashioned polyrhythms and Saturday night exuberance. Whether Daulne's coaxing a funky vibe out of a children's game (""Kwenda"") or leading a simmering bout of call and response (""Hey Brotha""), she seems to draw from a bottomless well of party-starting energy.</p><p>
    Which is not to say this a completely zero-gravity affair. Daulne just tucks her serious themes under a glaze of cheer, almost too well on ""Affection"", an effervescent, sensual piece that happens to be a eulogy for a recently departed friend. Based on an African song, ""Toma Taboo"" celebrates rituals for their power to yoke us to our pasts. It's a heavy subject turned joyously weightless by Arno's vocals, Me'shell Ndegeocello's bass, and a strutting, stuttering riff lifted from James Brown's ""The Payback"". Daulne's acrobatic, acidic voice, multitracked into a soothing harmony, holds the crowd together.
    </p>
<p>
    Wrapping together Daulne's rich juxtapositions-- high-wattage method and high-minded motivation, the personal and the universal-- ""Gati"" pays homage to the pygmies who rescued her. ""They saved my family and many others during the Congolese rebellion,"" she explains in the press materials, ""and they deserve recognition for that."" A chant characteristically heavy on call and response, buzzing with howls and whistles, the song melds a feather-light reggae bounce into a deeper, funkier groove all in the space of four minutes.
    </p>
<p>
    None of the songs breaks the five-minute mark, in fact. Yet each manages to cram a rainbow of color onto its small canvas-- while never coming off as busy. The bluesy, piano-driven ""Where Are You?"", to take another example, boasts both the smolder of a torch song and the upbeat pulse of a salsa number. Listening to Daulne cross so elegantly, so seamlessly over the length of an entire album, from genre to genre and emotion to emotion, leaves nothing to doubt: Zap Mama has never been better.

    While it's been disproportionately hyped by folks in and around the dance music community, Thomas Bullock (Rub 'N Tug, A.R.E. Weapons) and DJ Harvey's Map of Africa really doesn't have much in common sonically with dance music at all. Variously described as ""proto-disco"" (mildly defensible) and ""beardo house"" (more wrong than right), this full-length debut is still miles away from those. So before anything else, try to forget what it says on the ""file under"" tab; if this qualifies as disco or house, its only under their most tangential and gracious definitions, i.e. those of the much less splintered 1970s, when stoner riffs and 4/4s routinely rubbed up against each other on DJ playlists.</p><p>
    What does that leave us with? Basically, a classic rock record. More than anything else, <em>Map of Africa</em> is evidence for rock's increasing movement back towards 70s-inflected psychedelia. But where bands like Sweden's Studio have furnished that overall sound with spacier, more modern sonics, MoA prefer to keep it close to the bone. With the exception of a few of the more straightforward blues-rock tracks, which pop in a way that only rock recorded on digital can, the production here remains studiously faithful to the source material that inspired it. In that sense, this slots in comfortably with contemporaries like Arbouretum and A Mountain of One, in that all of them feel like they're on personal missions to engineer the 70s rock record they couldn't find secondhand.</p><p>
    Of the 14 tracks here, it's the simple, skanky,  meat'n'potatoes material that has the largest potential to polarize and rankle. From the inferior cover of the Equals' ""Black Skin Blue Eyed Boy"" to the sleazy, bar-room rock of ""Gonna Ride"", Map of Africa are at their most facile when they attempt-- as they do for roughly half the record-- to locate themselves somewhere near, say, Thin Lizzy or Motörhead. Combined with Bullock's puffed-out vocal delivery and his purposefully ludicrous lyrics (""Once or maybe twice a day/ Dirty lovin baby it's okay/ I like it straight around the bend/ Enough for me and both my friends"" goes ""Dirty Lovin""), it's often hard to see beyond this as a slightly self-indulgent genre exercise.</p><p>
    It's not all so hard-charging, though. With its gurgling analog synths, churning rhythms, and slow, spacey builds, ""Ely Cathedral"" begs comparisons to vintage-period Can. Elsewhere, the short drone piece ""Creation Myth"", the ragged psychedelia of ""Plastic Surgery"", and the woozy, almost-pretty title track prove that it's the more psychedelic, kraut-inspired moments in which Map of Africa shine. In the end, though, what you get out of this debut will depend mostly on your appetite for tongue-in-cheek, guitar-in-hand and cock-stuffed-proudly-under-leather. One man's mustachio sweat is another man's treasure-- your mileage may vary.<br/>

    The tour-<em>dóttirs</em> of Sigur Rós, Amiina (formerly Amina) is the string quartet that has accompanied the band on the road since <em>Ágætis Byrjun</em>. They also toured and arranged for Sigur Rós' <em>()</em> in its entirety and contributed to a couple of tracks on <em>Takk...</em> Solo efforts began in 2004 when they gathered all the instruments in their possession and began recording, though on this full-length debut the strings-- two violins, a viola and a cello-- remain at the forefront. Indeed, when the strings are given the spotlight, the strongest songs are created; ditherings with Theremin, xylophone, and scuttling drum machine are less impressive.</p><p>
    In the tradition of their male forebears, tonal variation created by the mix of acoustics and electrics, at least on paper, aids the process. But again, the most variation and intricacy comes from the strings, which sound plugged in, giving the production a honeyed, intimate atmosphere, as the instruments are more accessible to the ear and can be bowed less forcefully. On ""Rugla"", the group introduces a round of a melody with a warm electric guitar, which is complemented by a xylophone's complex approximation of its makeshift bassline. Soon violin and viola join in, adding a sprightly energy. They are there only to add support to the melody, really, but end up taking it over, their tones standing out so distinctly from the rather predictable plunks and plucks of the xylophone. The latter instrument is a staple of Sigur Rós and is here mimicked right down to the leaden adagio tempo, which reappears on the rustles of ""Seoul"", a theremin smoothing the variegated percussive tapestry with soaring, drawn-out notes.</p><p>
    On many tracks, including ""Seoul"" and ""Sexfaldur"", the group utilizes guitars as percussion, tapping what can be tapped, plucking what can't-- meaning all strings on deck. This is a strength that's seen on some of Björk's work, like <em>Vespertine</em>'s ""Frosti"". ""Sexfaldur"" is one of the prettiest tracks, its loops of twinkling incandescence standing effectively as a beat, the entire composition hinged, like many of the songs on <em>()</em>, on the most delicate instruments fused into strong, sure polyphony. But importantly, the performance retains an unstructured, organic quality-- uncomputerized, unfettered. Alternating these more upbeat numbers with floating lilies like ""Kolapot"" only emphasizes the plasmic, impromptu nature of the album. Still, the effect of such tracks doesn't match up to their events; ""Kolapot"", which evolves into a slow dance of xylophone, pizzicato, and non-verbal vocal choral calls, is too understated, yet not enmeshed enough in its own atmosphere; it seems to require either more layers, more vocals, or a more robust rhythm section.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Lóri"" introduces a harpsichord, marching drum, and the usual fare of xylophone and strings. Reminiscent of Efterklang's work, the song undulates in a looped pattern of winds and strings, but never resolves or evolves, simply floating in close variations of its original pattern. The force of the song is promising, but its melody is dull. The antidotal softness of ""Hilli"" and the final track, ""Boga"", brings similar skeletal structures to the mix, and here the lack of drums or bassline fits this improvisational bent. ""Hilli"" is a wandering, climbing piece bolstered by a pretty female chorus, but as with many of the songs, the reflexive meanderings of the players could benefit from more structure, playing less like accompanists and more like a fully-fledged group.

After a couple of hundred shows and radio sets, these adjustments can become part of the artist's musical DNA, redirecting all future work away from those lonely, antisocial earlier days, and towards a crowd-pleasing, stage-translatable compromise.</p><p>
    The Go! Team know this challenge well: After <em>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</em> became a surprise hit on both sides of the Atlantic, auteur Ian Parton found himself with a demand for a live version of his kitchen-sink project. By the end of 2006, he'd played every festival from Austin to Australia with his merry crew, slowly evolving from shy, nervous rookies to seasoned party-rock veterans, with the multimedia backdrop and headbands to prove it. When Parton found himself ready to record album #2, he likely discovered that his band was nothing like where he'd left it on his debut; for one, there were a lot more people in it.</p><p>
    In reaction, Parton seems to have overcompensated for these changes, turning <em>Proof of Youth</em> into more of a sequel that replays the <em>Thunder, Lightning, Strike </em>formula rather than allowing the new personnel to push the Go! Team mission in a new or different direction. That decision brings both pros and cons with it: On one hand, the Go! Team sound remains a pretty singular blend of unlikely sonic companions, but revisisting that approach risks hitting the bottom of the creative well.
    </p><p>
    First single ""Grip Like a Vice"" is the thesis statement to <em>Proof of Youth</em>'s copycat philosophy: It instant-replays the template of ""The Power Is On"", staccato playground chants and roller-rink organ building to sports-highlight fanfare and caustic guitar peaks. It's a relief, at least, to hear that the addition of non-sampled vocals-- most courtesy of rapper Ninja-- hasn't changed Parton's approach to production: Her words are still low and faded in the mix, as if he recorded her, pressed it to vinyl, and then sampled it just to maintain his aesthetic. ""Grip Like a Vice"" isn't the only ""Power"" clone, though it's probably the best: ""Titanic Vandalism"" and ""Keys to the City"" find diminishing returns as the novelty of the approach wears thin.
    </p>
<p>
    The other welcome news is that the guest-star buddies that the Go! Team have accumulated don't do much to break up the gameplan either, as appearances by Bonde do Role's Marina Ribatski, the Rapper's Delight Club kids, and the Double Dutch Divas fade right into the grainy mix. Only Chuck D stands out: ""Flashlight Fight""'s paranoid sirens and clattering drums hearken back to the Bomb Squad's urgent soundscapes.
    </p>
<p>
    While the kid-chants-as-hip-hop-maneuver bit starts to show signs of staleness on <em>Proof of Youth</em>-- even in spite of the album's guests-- other aspects of the Go! Team's philosophy provide more replayable highlights. ""Fake ID"" is less old-school rap pastiche than twee indie-pop given a supercharged engine, with glockenspiel and child-like vocals propelled by fuzz bass and Parton's voluminous drums. ""Doing It Right"" shuffles those poppier elements into the jump-rope rhyming and horns template, intercutting the proto-rap with a dreamy chorus. But would it kill the band to include a few more instrumental interludes like the Alan Parker cover ""My World"", which offer a welcome relief from the frenetic pace while sucker-punching memories of Sesame Street Super-8 interludes and weird Morricone-knockoff cartoon scores?
    </p>
<p>
    Those quieter moments may have been the necessary sacrifice to the Go! Team's new extrovert status, and if so, it's a fair but troubling tradeoff. <em>Proof of Youth</em> mostly recaptures the enthusiasm and unique sensibility of <em>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</em>, further filling that niche for lo-fi sample-based old-school-noise-rap we never knew we needed filling. But in retracing his earlier steps, Parton is beginning to flirt with the dangerous point where a thrilling new sound becomes a one-trick pony, allowing the band to drift more towards exclusively making the kind of music that plays big on stage.

    While Pinback never shied away from using drum machines, the quiet electronic percussion that introduces ""How We Breathe"" sounds much like the mark of a grandfather clock-- apt for a band long built from the Swiss-watch-slick rhythms and the sophisticated interplay between the strings of Armistead B. Smith IV and Rob Crow. If the band has curveballs to throw, they've saved them for EPs, and otherwise tucked them almost invisibly into elaborately constructed pop songs that somehow make all the weird twists and turns into something homogeneously ""pretty."" If there's a gripe to be had with them, it's that a surface listen reveals a whole lot of lovely tones and not much else, and <em>Autumn of the Seraphs</em> is just as uniformly gorgeous and tasteful as any Pinback record. Consistency is a bitch sometimes.</p><p>
<em>Seraphs</em> lacks the some of the depth and organic detail that made Pinback's <em>Summer in Abaddon</em> a standout, but if that record had a fault, it was trading atmosphere for any sort of catharsis (even if it fit the record's theme). <em>Autumn of the Seraphs</em>, on the other hand, returns to warmer, more familiar tones, including the busy, gently funky interplay and wide hooks that fans have come to expect. The quick and bubbling beat of the first song and lead-off single, ""From Nothing to Nowhere"", plays Smith's gentle warnings off of Crow's staccato dismissals, and has an insistence that proves all their quiet class could use a boot in the crack from their punk side. It's a reassuring three minutes that seems nearly epic, but if you're looking for that kind of energy on the rest of the album, you'll be disappointed-- <em>Seraphs</em> lacks the same jolt in tempo on the whole, and probably could have benefited from it.</p><p>
    But there's no point in begrudging Pinback for something they've never really done to begin with. That <em>Seraphs</em> happens to be a more satisfying front-to-back listen than any of their previous records shouldn't be overlooked. ""Barnes"" juxtaposes the relaxing, wide-open reverberating strum of the chorus with the mesmerizing math-influenced interplay that leads up to it. ""Good to Sea"" skips by on a reverberating tone like a video game reward leading the listener through the cascading electronic percussion and calmly-delivered dark lyrics (""Oh no, I hit rock bottom""). The deliberate pacing of ""How We Breathe"" could have slid easily into the drowsy middle of <em>Abaddon</em>, but the similarly slow ""Walters"" announces its intentions early with a few faraway distorted notes, then preceding-- and earning-- the final release with a lulling, hypnotic group pulse.</p><p>
    The sluggish end of the album's first half does pay off, first with the deliberate ""Subbing for Eden"" with a sharp vocal hook from Crow tossed as a lifeline, then with ""Devil You Know"", a convenient capsule of Pinback's appeal: palm-muted guitars dance through the intro, sing-song vocals sprout harmonies and become a round, and a simple descending piano figure opens up the tension before a sour guitar line soon tears through all that accumulated grace. The song ends up somewhere totally different, but equally evocative. Latter tracks like ""Torch"" and ""Bouquet"" lean on the familiar electronic beats of the group's material, but benefit from bolder vocals (from Smith especially, whose solo spots command more attention than on previous outings) and the layering that they've learned from <em>Abaddon.</em></p><p>
    I can't blame anyone who finds it relentlessly pretty, but I could never call them lacking in ideas-- just committed to using the same ones and varying them ever so slightly. If the evidence isn't in the two principals' long and varied resumes, it's in the corners of songs like ""Devil You Know"" or ""Blue Harvest"", gently stretching the formula to just the point of tearing by layering little incongruous details that still fit perfectly into the context of the song. I'll grant that their records can be fatiguing, but take any of these songs on its own, listen to it three times consecutively, and guaranteed you'll hear something different each time. Odd that <em>Abaddon</em> was titled as a summer record and this one autumn, as <em>Abaddon</em> sounded drawn inward from the burn of frost, and the resilient charm of <em>Autumn of the Seraphs</em> evokes all we can get away with during the last dimly lit late evenings of summer.

<span class=""q"">Some albums stride, some sulk, but David Dondero's
    seventh LP shuffles around, hands in pockets.
    It's easy to like <em>Simple Love</em> despite its 
    faux-shucks posturing. </span><span class=""q"">Love is another thing, though: Despite </span><span class=""q"">Dondero's wry, self-deprecating lyrics, fresh touches of piano, and bare instrumentation,</span><span class=""q""> <em>Simple Love'</em>s simple drumming and lackadaisical
    strumming make some songs interchangeable.</span></p><p>
Bright Eyes has named Dondero as an influence, and though
    Conor Oberst has evolved into a broader artist, he still approximates
    Dondero's vocal style. Those quavering vocals inject emotion into
    <em>Simple Love</em>, but compulsory vocal tremors start to grate
    after awhile here, just as they often do with Oberst's work. Dondero aims for a sincerity that
    Oberst sometimes lacks, though. And, as on his last album, <em>South of the
    South</em>, Dondero sometimes forces a clever line between the joints of
    his songs, disrupting their natural flow for a moment of
    self-satisfaction (another trait he shares with Oberst). <span class=""q""></span></p><p>
    Unlike that last LP, however, Dondero has added tinges of jazz to enliven his plaintive songs. Next to the
    lyrical references (he quotes Charlie Parker and claims to worship at
    the Church of John Coltrane-- a real place-- on standout track ""Rothko
    Chapel"", also real), pianist Eddy Hobizal dusts tracks with
    jazz runs. Hobizal quotes Dizzy Gillespie's ""Salt Peanuts"" as he enters
    ""Double Murder Ballad Suicide"" and his fleet bop runs snake through the
    rest of the track. </p><p>
Dondero's detailed descriptions are still the best
    thing about him. He's able to evoke a complete experiential landscape:
    suicide bridges, dark, cool churches, muddy rivers. Still, he sometimes
    seems at odds with his own cleverness. On ""Simple Love"" he asks, ""How
    can you say that you trust him/ You don't even like his music"" and his
    smirk's audible.  ""Rothko Chapel"" is partially about love, but
    mostly about authenticity-- of churches, of music, and of people-- though
    the title track finds that the latter two are one in the same.
    </p>
<p>
    ""You
    Don't Love Anyone"" is on the same topic but doesn't work as
    well-- Dondero complains about a siliconed and collegened woman who ends
    up not even loving him because he doesn't have any cash. Such trite
    observations don't work-- Dondero's insistence on painting his target
    in such broad strokes undercuts any narrative interest the song has
    going for it. More nuanced laments, such as ""When the Heart Breaks
    Deep"", are much better, though he is still singing about fake, lying
    women. Thematically, musically, and lyrically all of Dondero's songs
    are easy to place within the continuum of traditional American music-- country, blues, bebop, and ""Sister Ray"" are all concatenated here. For
    all his ability to recombine these sounds, though, Dondero sometimes
    sounds hard put to add anything of his own.

    Although never explicitly stated, the Robert Pollard promise has always been that, no matter how many noise barrages or half-sung, half-howled spoken word passages the listener has to endure, there's always a catchy, harrowing mini-anthem waiting around the next corner. Circus Devils, one of Pollard's Fading Captain pet projects, stand as one of the few exceptions to this promise. Teamed with multi-instrumentalist/producer and former GbV producer Todd Tobias, Pollard cedes much of the duo's songwriting to his more sonically dark and experimental buddy.</p><p>
    At this point, Pollard's catalogue has grown so voraciously that putting each album into some sort of context seems impossible and, at best, pointless. However, many parts of <em>Sgt. Disco</em> sound like direct reactions against 2005's gawky Devils release <em>Five</em>, an album particularly harsh on Pollard's melodic allure. While we're still light years from a pop album in the GbV sense, Pollard's vocals inch closer to center stage than before, his bizarre tics evolving into more palatable grotesques of various rock genres. The vague, bristly sound collages of <em>Five</em> appear to have gelled to form more straightforward pseudo-grunge tracks. Power chord stompers like ""George Took a Shovel"" and ""Outlasting Girafalo"" capture the early 90s Pearl Jam/Stone Temple Pilots aesthetic, with Pollard's comically deep Vedder growl justified by clever songwriting.</p><p>
    In fact, for any Pollard project, GbV or otherwise, <em>Sgt. Disco</em> sports a surprisingly high number of verse-chorus-verse structures. Tracks like ""In Madonna's Gazebo"" harness the power of skewed noise rock riffs within a pretty conventional format, and even the avant-garde film score synths of ""The Constable's Headscape"" settle into a hummable chorus. In fact, excepting two lengthy blocks of shapeless experimentation on the album, one never has to suffer through more than a few minutes before hitting a coherent rock hook.
    </p>
<p>
    For brief moments, the duo even scrapes away enough muck to let some heart shine through. Psych ballad ""Rose In Paradise"", the album's penultimate track, feels like a breath of fresh air after an hour-plus of overdrive assault. The three-minute centerpiece (if such a thing exists on a 32-track album) ""Swing Shift"" especially harkens back to the GbV days of poignant albeit oblique pop gems, the familiar guitar and bass setup simply replaced with synth and sound effects. These bright spots considered, though, I'm not going to lie; the Circus Devils still make records that are taxing to listen straight through. However, with strategic skipping and a stomach for Pollard's beefiest rock posturing to date, <em>Sgt. Disco</em> proves much less a shitshow than its predecessors, but rather a pocket of sanity in Pollard's otherwise mind-boggling oeuvre.<br/>

The duo's most noteworthy stop: Serving as the rhythm section for Metric. Emily Haines' group isn't especially innovative, but after sitting through several passes of <em>Best Friends in Love</em>, its creative core comes into sharp relief (it's the other two, by the way).  This record is profoundly conservative, comprised of dirty post-post-punk pastiche, clichéd sentiment, and barely disguised amateurism.  Bang Lime make the sort of music that might find its way on to a blanket-license production music compilation, to be used by editors looking to score a low-budget, straight-to-DVD film scene in a Brooklyn club.  In 2004.</p><p>
    Julian Casablancas and Paul Banks themselves have proffered some of the past decade's clunkiest lyrical sentiment, but they're still palatable at least, enmeshed as they are in clouds of glassy, authentic-seeming disillusion.  Winstead has no such excuse, though: His simplistic urban-existence narratives not only neglect any semblance of nuance in favor of thuddingly boring couplets, they register as completely unironic.  ""Kings and Queens"" has ""Get a little bit closer/ It's your spell that I'm under,"" and ""The Death of Death"" opens with ""Oh, do you ride on the subway/ And wait all night for the love train.""  ""Angie thinks she's 17 years old,"" we learn on ""Fly Paper"", before finding out she's ""a small insect, soon to rule the world.""  Oh wait, one more, from ""Equator"":  ""Follow your fingers/ Touch leather/ Unbuckle his belt line/ A foreign pleasure.""  Effective subtitles for a poorly-translated eastern-European escort service? Sure.</p><p>
    Both ""Sailing"", about the slave trade, and ""Free White &amp; 21"", which is about, um, being that, ostensibly allow Winstead, an African-American, to address the issue of race.  A dicey proposition, given his propensity to avoid subtlety at every turn.  On ""21"" Winstead repeats the phrase ""innocent and free,"" sounding so much like a stock Jack Black character mugging for the camera.  ""Sailing"", the guitars of which very closely resemble Ministry's ""Breathe"", is probably the closest thing <em>Best Friends in Love</em> comes to a success, the lyric ""Three-fifths of a man!  That don't add up to much!"" notwithstanding.  Winstead's feelings for the song, expressed in a recently published interview, probably reveal the truth about his own investment in his work:  ""It's basically about the slave trade...I think it's hilarious.""

Handpicked by Air for their Record Makers label, where Turzi released their <i>Made Under Authority</i> EP in 2005, the band shares little in common with its more prominent compatriots. You won't find the techno bombast of Daft Punk or Justice, the sultry bedroom orchestrations of Air, or even the coke-dusted 1980s electro of Kavinsky. Instead, Turzi infuse <i>A</i> with a litany of austere, cerebral European sounds meant to accompany primary songwriter Romain Turzi's vision quest through history.</p>
<p>Attila the Hun, Mozart, and Jesus Christ, among other historical celebs, receive shout-outs amidst a sensory overload of krautrock, psych, and shoegaze. Says Turzi in the band's press release, ""Music, whether you are initiated in it or not, should make you have the same sensations as doing drugs,"" and despite the homogenized tracklist (every song begins with the letter ""a""), the album strives to keep the listener chemically out of whack. Unlike the gradual, ecstasy-friendly build of techno, Turzi's heady motorik establishes steady beats and chants that burn hot but briefly. On ""Are You Thinking About Jesus?"", Turzi muses that ""Jesus had never seen a dancefloor,"" yet he prematurely pulls the plug on this swelling maxim as if he never has either.</p>
<p>While <i>A</i> flaunts a cultured blend of musical genres, Turzi's penchant for kitschy film score tropes serves as the glue holding the whole thing together. Besides the obvious Can or Silver Apples references, Turzi cites Hollywood composers like Ennio Morricone as major influences, a connection that quickly becomes apparent just a few tracks in. Tracks like ""Alpes"" or ""Afghanistan"" open according to the stoic German template, with subtle but skull-piercing guitar droning over a rudimentary drum part on the verge of Chinese water torture, the whole system immaculately interlocked and seemingly interminable. Quickly, though, the ascetic loses out to the aesthetic, the taut kraut drones slouch into dark surf-guitar riffs, and Turzi's deep vocals inject a James Dean-like coolness into the song's unfeeling machinery.</p>
<p>However, <i>A</i> proves more than the extra butter on your action movie's popcorn. Just as any of these obsessive numbers can simultaneously explode into scene-stealing theatrics, so too can they get caught in a mind-melting feedback loop. ""Attila Blues"" starts eerily similar to <i>A</i>'s more dramatic tracks, though Turzi reins in his breathy vocals, emulating Suicide's ability to reconcile clanging, anti-climactic repetition with warm-blooded Elvis crooning. Ironically, a topographically-challenged track like this adds more entertainment value than a dozen show-stopping themes strung together ever could. Nowhere on <i>A</i> does Turzi craft something wholly original or unpredictable on its own, but sequentially each track puts enough of a twist on its predecessor to keep this strung-out blockbuster score intriguing.</p></div>"|10622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10622-a/|7.1|Adam Moerder

    While rap music famously thrives on the kind of drama surrounding this week's 50 vs. Kanye record-sales standoff, even this showdown's closest followers would probably admit there's
    something faintly procedural about it. Maybe it's because
    album sales don't really work as a precise measure of absolute
    popularity anymore. Maybe it's because 50's a shadow of his former self
    and no longer considered among the best, biggest, or most
    anything. Or maybe it's because
    Universal labelmates 50 and West seem more like they're doing this for
    us than for themselves. This is a prize fight between two heavyweight boxers moving in polar-opposite directions; the
    former weakly flailing through a creative crisis and a serious absence of
    hunger, the latter trying to transcend America by setting
    his sights on nothing less than the entire world.</p><p>
    For all the pageantry, the most substantial takeaway from Kanye's new album is the
    realization that he might actually deserve the legendary status he constantly ascribes to himself. Though it doesn't quite match <em>College Dropout</em> or <em>Late Registration</em>
    in pleasure-center overload, West's
    third
    album in four years is both his most
    consistent and most enterprising yet. It also caps off an incredible (maybe even unprecedented) run: In
    terms of consistency, prolificness, and
    general all-around ability,
    it's hard to find anyone in mainstream rap who can touch what he's
    achieved within the same timeframe.</p><p>
    Where <em>College Dropout</em> and <em>Late Registration</em> mostly functioned as contagious nostaglia trips, <em>Graduation</em>
    finds him settling into the pocket; instead of
    looking inside for answers, he's looking out to the world. When he raps ""I shop so much I can speak Italian"" on ""Champion"",
    it's obvious he's holding up worldliness as a point of pride. His
    production choices reinforce that belief: Here, Kanye splices his well-articulated production style with
    a brand new set of
    influences-- most of them European. What he ends up with is a record that splits the difference between two distinctive styles: his familiar strings and brass, helium vocal samples, and warm
    soul samples on one side; corroded rave stabs, vinegary synth
    patches, and weirdly modulated electronic noises on the other. (Ironically, the latter all have roots in West's hometown of Chicago.)  
    </p>
<p>
    While <em>Graduation</em> is
    far from the electro-house record some fans predicted when the Daft
    Punk-sampling ""Stronger"" first leaked, Kanye's interest in French house and rave extend beyond that one track. The stunning ""I Wonder"" combines a gentlemanly, piano-led sample (courtesy of 70s folk/jazz artist Labi Siffre) with a frizzy synth lead and alien-sounding keys,
    only to drown it all out with a massive swoop of strings; the weirdly
    dystopian club track ""Drunk and Hot Girls"" lurches along at a snail's
    pace, mixing Can's ""Sing Swan Song"" with a blend of gypsy music and
    detuned electronics for maximum queasiness; and the string-led ""Flashing
    Lights"" marries a Bond-worthy coda to staccato sounds and
    cut-up vocal samples. 
    Where lesser producers have tried to bridge this gap only to wind up with beats that sound like bad mashups, West and co-producer DJ
    Toomp (T.I., ""What You Know"") make the
    juxapositions feel utterly natural.  Combined with some other familiar source
    material (""Champion"", for example, nicks from Steely Dan), that
    undercurrent of experimentation puts Kanye's talents to good use.
    </p>
    And that's barely scratching the surface. Aside from the patchy ""Barry
    Bonds"" (on which an inspired West confounds the odds by drastically
    outsmarting an uncharacteristically lazy Lil Wayne on the mic), nearly
    everything here feels tight and inventive. The aforementioned ""I
    Wonder"" and ""Flashing Lights"" are immediate highlights, as is the old-school
    gospel rave-up of ""The Glory"" and future smash ""Good Life"", which
    features T-Pain pitting his autotuned hooks against a bed of
    summery, squealing synths. Previous singles ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"" and
    ""Stronger"" somehow take on new life in context of the record, and even
    the Chris Martin-aided ""Homecoming"" feels like it hits the right notes.
    <p>
    Lyrically,
    West is magnanimous, corny, self-aggrandizing, and
    likeable in the all the usual ways. The difference here is
    that he's dialed down his inner conflict.
    The
    neurotic inner monologues of his most engaging verses are virtually absent here. If there's one criticism to be made of
    <em>Graduation</em>, it's that in striving for universality, he's
    sacrificed a more personal dimension of himself. The only time we even
    really get close to the mental hand-wringing of his early albums is on the closing ""Big Brother"", where he details his lifelong admiration
    for Jay-Z and hints at the post-<em>Dropout</em> turbulence between the two,
    before riffing on his own chorus to conclude: ""My big brother was Big's brother/ So here's a few words from ya kid brother/ If you admire somebody you should go head and tell 'em/ People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em"". </p><p>
    Of course, West's true
    genius has always come out in his production work, and hearing him find natural ways of fitting these disparate elements together is worth the increased number of Louis Vee
    brags. While it might not be as substantial a record as we're used to hearing from him, it is  his greatest leap forward, and further proof that few are as skilled at tracing out the complicated contours of pride, success and ambition as he is.</p></div>"|10658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10658-graduation/|8.7|Mark Pytlik

    Machiavellian handbook, <em>The 48 Laws of Power</em>. Not only has the
    muscle-bound hip-hop colossus modeled his career after the cutthroat guide,
    he's working with Greene on a street-flavored addendum called <em>The 50th
    Law</em>. So far, the four dozen over-the-top credos have worked swimmingly for 50: He's sold
    more than 20 million albums worldwide since 2003 while pulling in
    auxiliary profits with Vitamin Water and other less amusing side hustles.
    But these days, when it comes to music, 50 Cent looks vulnerable; most of the advance
    singles from <em>Curtis</em> underperformed, and the Queens
    rapper has a good chance of losing this week's transparent SoundScan battle to Kanye West (if not country bumpkin Kenny Chesney). What's a power-starved,
    protein-shaking egomaniac to do? Well, re-reading his personal Bible would be a
    good start … <span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<em>Law 46: Never Appear Too Perfect-- It is smart to
    occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to appear
    more human and approachable.</em></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    In this week's <em>Rolling Stone</em> feature on 50 Cent, the rapper
    claims, ""I'm King Kong. Kanye is human. Humans run when they see King
    Kong, because they're scared."" He's right.
    Hulking, inelegant, and hopelessly primitive, 50 Cent is hip-hop's doomed beast.
    On <em>Curtis</em>, he sets out to re-energize his base by reminding us of his strengths: He
    fucks and kills with ease, he needs five deposit envelopes every time he hits up an ATM, and he's a hit with the ladies. But, as Greene makes clear,
    there's no depth or dynamic to that kind of perfection-- it's like watching a big
    dildo machine make big dildos all day. While 50 never made a habit of
    flaunting his faults like Kanye (or Em or Big or 2Pac…), he could usually
    back up his tales with indelible beats, swaggering hooks, and a flow that
    slithered like original sin. But those once-bountiful gifts are all heavily downgraded--
    or altogether absent-- on <em>Curtis</em>.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    50 should be
    able to work with producers who could conjure his hit-making abilities, but instead the MC mostly sticks with tried-and-failed G-Unit stalwarts and
    Dre-aping up-and-comers that do him few favors. Nearly every instrumental--
    from the cartoon menace of ""My Gun Go Off"" to the assembly-line funk of
    ""Touch the Sky""-- plods with the same unending gangster greys that
    tanked recent albums from Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and Mobb Deep. On the surface, the
    tracks display a factory-sealed freshness, but that machine-made precision quickly becomes monotonous, begging for something more raw and excitable.
    <em>Curtis</em> nails this sweet-spot only once, on the stadium-status ""I Get Money"", an adrenaline rush so pure it manages to revive 50's weary id for three and a half booming minutes. Unfortunately, it's not nearly enough. <span> </span><span> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<em>Law 25: Re-Create Yourself-- Forge a new identity, one that
    commands attention and never bores the audience.</em>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    With soul-flecked hits like ""Hate It or Love It"",
    ""Window Shopper"", and ""Hustler's Ambition"", there was some
    hope that 50 would divert from his hard-charging style toward something more
    shadowy and sampled-based for this new album. That switch would allow him to age gracefully and
    give him a sympathetic platform to air out the real Curtis instead of his exhausted superhero guise. But naturally, the laid-back style that
    characterized <em>Massacre</em> highlights like ""Ski Mask
    Way"" and ""Ryder Music"" is almost
    nowhere to be found on <em>Curtis</em>. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The reflective poise that characterized his killer ""Hate It or Love It"" verse is constantly pushed aside for a
    repetitive nihilism best summed up by the self-explanatory ""I'll Still Kill"",
    one of the very few Akon-assisted tracks in existence that fails to stick. The
    album's only concession to modern pop trends-- the Timbaland-produced,
    Timberlake-hooked ""Ayo Technology""-- flies off the rails as 50, ripped from his comfort zone, falls behind the gurgling, video-game-blipping beat. Though he
    tries to force the track into more familiar territory with a cyborg-stripper theme,
    Justin nabs the spotlight without even trying. The closest 50 comes to the silky
    maturity that once seemed so promising is on ""Follow My Lead"", a love ballad with
    everyone's second-favorite white-boy crooner, Robin Thicke, singing back-up.
    While the track's supper-club twinkle is a welcome oasis amidst <em>Curtis</em>'s Michael
    Bay brutishness, 50 relies on
    played-out, faceless pick-up lines: ""You could be my Beyonce, I could be
    your Jay."" Thing is, even Jay famously reinvented himself on <em>The Blueprint</em>, shedding
    his icy exterior for something close to human emotion. Here, 50 misses an opportunity for reinvention, relying on the same useless 9mm Viagra
    formula. <span> </span><span> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<em>Law 18: Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself--
    Isolation is Dangerous: Isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects
    you from-- it cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you conspicuous
    and an easy target.</em>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    50 Cent currently lives in a 50,000 square foot house in Farmington,
    Connecticut. The former Mike Tyson abode has<span class=""mainarttxt""> five Jacuzzis, 25 full baths, 18 bedrooms, an
    elevator, two billiard rooms, a movie theater, a locker room, and several stripper poles. Especially for
    a man known for his reclusive reputation, the house is a
    fortress of the highest order. It's also an apt symbol for his isolation
    and detachment from the modern rap landscape. In direct opposition to Kanye's fearless, risk-taking <em>Graduation</em>, 50's new album is
    a blatant rehash-- a bottom-line sequel that insults the same audience it
    mindlessly panders to. Once again, from <em>Rolling Stone</em>: </span>""'Kanye
    receives trophies because he's safe,' 50 Cent says, punctuating the word 'safe'
    with a lisp and a limp wrist."" At this point, those grandstanding put-downs
    aren't just wildly off-the-mark, but genuinely sad; like <em>Curtis</em>, such remarks are too pathetic to be taken seriously and too stupid to
    be funny. <span class=""mainarttxt"">In his insular quest to recapture the king-sized
    popularity of his massive debut, 50 is sacrificing the same thing that Kanye
    (and Jay and Nas...) has so tirelessly worked to cultivate: an engaging music career worth remembering.<span> </span></span>

If anything, Russell's music-- whether it was disco, classical, or avant-garde folk--was always a distillation of all these elements. On this website in 2004, Andy Beta suggested the collection <i>The World of Arthur Russell</i> add an ""s"" to the word ""world,"" but that would rob Russell of his quiet brilliance--the harmony of disparate ideas.</p>
<p>Dinosaur L was a band produced and directed by Russell. In 1978, they released ""Kiss Me Again"", one of the first disco singles released on Sire records. The opening gambit was unambiguous, even by meat-market standards: ""I want you inside me/ Yes, that is the plan."" But this was Russell: trenchant and immediate, but with manners to his syntax. He was a peacenik. He wrote a song called ""You Can Make Me Feel Bad""; he wrote about going swimming and treehouses-- a city youth lusting for country peace-- and once quipped that ""grown-ups are crazy."" The poet Allen Ginsberg, who Russell accompanied on cello for some readings, remembered the singer as saying he wanted to make ""Buddhist bubblegum music.""</p>
<p>Both play into <i>24-&gt;24 Music</i>, Dinosaur L's one full-length album. Recorded in 1979 and released in 82 on Russell and colleague William Socolov's Sleeping Bag Records, it's disco at its loosest, warmest, and weirdest. The band, a no-brow, no-context hash of veteran session men like the Ingram Brothers and avant-garde voyagers like Jill Kroesen, fumble with disco like it was a third language. Most of it's alluringly ugly and unkempt, not traditionally virtues on the dance floor. And dance music's paradoxical ideal-- infinity, but, you know, with more climaxes--is abandoned for something more aimless and continual. The random punctuations in lines like ""I wanna go bang"" or interruptive keyboard clusters have more to do with John Cage than disco's repetition. Then again, not going anywhere in particular while sustaining motion is a possibility monks consider for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Call it disco (not disco), to borrow a phrase from Strut records. Or, call it one ideal of disco. Like how Russell manged to retain his roots and seem New York (not New York). His classic is still 1986's <i>World of Echo</i>, a swirl of voice, cello, and electronics, made solo. The goal was simple: to erase the borders between interior and exterior by making a record that sounded like the whispers in someone's head, refracted through the city. He never reached the same heights of spirit in his disco work (and incidentally, <i>The World of Arthur Russell</i> is almost a better place to start for neophytes to his disco side, collecting not only the best Dinosaur stuff, but sides recorded as Loose Joints and under his own name). Russell's legacy seems more formidable the more prolific and expansive it is, and <i>24-&gt;24 Music</i> falls in a long line of deserved reissues of the most ambitiously scattered music brains of his short time.</p></div>"|10597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10597-24-24-music/|7.5|Mike Powell

    MySpace success only to criticize comparisons of the two London
    singers as ""lazy journalism."" But why compare when you can contrast: If
    Lily Allen is the plainspoken wiseass chick all the guys love to hang around, Kate Nash is the plainspoken piano geek who
    simultaneously loves Lily Allen and is also a little bit jealous of her social
    prowess. Nash is coy and neurotic-- instead of tossing a deadbeat
    boyfriend and laughing at his tears, she can't help but wallow in a crumbling
    relationship. And, leading up to this LP, her rotating quartet of mostly humble, quiet MySpace tracks offered canny scenes of young love-- tiny romantic comedies that could affect even the snobbiest art-house connoisseur. Too bad, then, that <em>Made of Bricks</em> is a rushed,
    glossed-over misfire that almost trips over itself to hide the reasons why Nash
    became such a web phenom in the first place.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Instead of allowing Nash to simply clean-up the homey demos
    early fans knew and loved, many songs are completely made over in seemingly
    random styles that emphasize hot shit producer Paul Epworth's studio expertise more
    than Nash's natural warmth. ""Birds"", originally an acoustic guitar
    stunner about an inarticulate, bird-obsessed dude and his perplexed girlfriend,
    is remade as a faux-country farce that seeps away the
    song's naïve appeal with a novelty cowboy hat and a wink. ""We Get
    On"" is transformed from a crushingly self-conscious diary entry backed only
    by Nash's careful piano plinks into a goofy, roller-rink trifle that
    undermines the songwriter's nuanced heartbreak. Then there's the
    album's shameless filler; instead of allowing Nash the time to craft enough real-life
    pop songs to fill out an LP, the internet opportunists behind <em>Made of Bricks</em> try to
    cover-up obvious non-starters like ""Play"", ""Dickhead"", and
    ""Shit Song"" with knob-twirling nonsense and gratuitous instrumentation. Considering
    reckless moves like these, this debut full-length can be viewed as cautionary case of
    too many friends too soon. <span> </span><span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    After one listen to her UK
    hit ""Foundations"", it becomes obvious Kate Nash has a gift for communicating
    confusing romance with a keen eye for detail and scene-stealing turns of phrase.
    The single-- along with just-a-girl power-pop blast ""Mouthwash"" and sex-not-love big-beat bouncer ""Pumpkin Soup""-- is one of the few <em>Made of Bricks</em> tracks that finds Nash's acutely enunciated
    words complimented with just the right amount of swirling sonic accoutrements.
    ""My fingertips are holding onto the cracks in our foundation/ I know that
    I should let go but I can't,"" she sings. <em>Made of Bricks</em> too often tries to
    smooth over the emotional cracks, breaks and fissures that happen to be Kate
    Nash's distinguishing hallmark. Without them, she may as well be any other London
    newcomer in a bright dress and matching trainers. <span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p></div>"|10605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10605-made-of-bricks/|5.5|Ryan Dombal

    In March, Animal Collective's Panda Bear (aka Noah Lennox) had his breakout moment with the release of <em>Person Pitch</em>. It was his first solo album that didn't sound like what we'd previously heard from Animal Collective; sample-heavy and based on loops, the album's songwriting devices favored expansion and contraction over conventional chord changes. <em>Person Pitch</em> reflected Panda's interest in dance music-- even when it veered toward the angelic pop innocence forever associated with the harmony-drenched hits of the 1960s and 70s. Both the album and its transcendent centerpiece, ""Bros"", are deservedly being widely considered among the year's best.</p><p>
    On <em>Strawberry Jam</em>, the new album from Animal Collective, it's Avey Tare's turn. It's not that <em>Strawberry Jam</em> resembles a solo album, or that Avey (aka Dave Portner) seems to dominate to an unusual degree-- Panda Bear is unmistakably present too, along with sound processor Geologist (aka Brian Weitz) and guitarist Deakin (aka Josh Dibb). But the specifics of who's doing what have been shuffled, and the members' respective contributions-- including who's singing at any given moment-- aren't always easy to single out. The story of this record for me, though, is the strength of Avey Tare's voice, and how his singing anchors these songs, invigorates the band's idiosyncratic melodies, and offers a clear portal into Animal Collective's utopian dreamworld.</p><p>
    Avey Tare's tone has never been as aching and pure as Panda Bear's, but his is the more versatile instrument. Wild intervallic leaps-- jumping up and down full octaves, or going from a full-throated howl to a piercing shriek-- have long been his trademark, and it's something that bugs a lot of people. That makes sense: His vocal style is peculiar, and could easily strike some as affected. But the way he negotiates a song like the fourth track here, ""For Reverend Green"", shows just how well he can adapt his singing to fit the needs of the song. 
    </p>
<p>
    Over a repeating guitar delay that sounds a little like the Smiths' ""How Soon Is Now?"" and an organ seemingly pulled from the midway of a county fair, Avey follows the contours of ""For Revered Green""'s sing-song melody but never seems bound by it. He explodes with a scream every line or two for emphasis-- not to highlight a word, but to convey the idea of feelings spilling over the edges of the song's expansive container. It's a sound and point-of-view associated now with only one band. A backing of ""whoo-oo-oo"" vocals working in counterpart to the main melody only reinforce how distinctive Animal Collective's sound has become. Here, more than on any record yet, they own that sound completely. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""For Reverend Green"" fades into the structurally similar but tonally different ""Fireworks"", arguably forming the greatest back-to-back in the Animal Collective's catalog. ""Fireworks"" is about the pleasure of simple things, but also about how hard they can be to appreciate: ""A sacred night where we'll watch the fireworks/ The frightened babies poo/ They've got two flashing eyes and they're colored why/ They make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Animal Collective are never a band I listened to for lyrics-- on those early records, they were pretty hard to make out-- but the words in ""Fireworks"" match perfectly the song's complex mood: There's a romantic sense of longing, an air of celebration, but also tinges of doubt, loss, and acceptance. That it's all rendered so beautifully, with tempered banshee vocals, some spacey dub elements to kick off the middle break, and one of the band's best melodies-- and layered and varied enough to have had two or three good songs built from it-- reveals the band's mastery of complex, experimental pop songcraft.
    </p>
<p>
    The galloping opener ""Peacebone"" sets the scene; Animal Collective don't seem exactly like a rock band on <em>Strawberry Jam</em>. There are odd sounds of indeterminate origin, and textures vaguely associated with circus music crop up regularly. Here, the melodic buoyancy and junk-shop keyboards stomping along behind Avey Tare's voice create a ramshackle backdrop for a story of a monster in a maze, strange fossils in a natural history museum, and plenty of other stuff (when Avey gets rolling, he's pretty verbose).  
    </p>
<p>
    The only thing expected from an Animal Collective record that's never quite delivered on <em>Strawberry Jam</em> is the long, dreamy, droney builder. The album's second half is slightly more abstract than the catchy pop that precedes it, but these moments are tempered, causing the record to feel more focused. ""#1"" opens with a repeating Terry Riley-esque pattern on what sounds like an early-70s synth, but this is a cleaner, simpler sort of experiment for Animal Collective. The lead vocal is pitched down and vaguely eerie, but Panda's bright backing vocals really carry the piece, which seems happy to drift along without going any place in particular. The track's lack of momentum differentiates it from, say, the songs on the looser second half of <em>Feels</em>, but it's got its own vibe and it works. 
    </p>
<p>
    The record culminates with the thunderous ""Cuckoo Cuckoo"", its most explosive track, shifting between lyrical piano bits (not a lot of those on past Animal Collective records) to in-the-red surges of drums, guitar, and noisemakers. And then, after so many great Avey-fronted songs, <em>Strawberry Jam</em> closes with the folk-like ""Derek"", sung by Panda. The song begins with some lightly strummed guitar and water sounds and ends with crashing percussion and a refrain that sounds like a West African pop tune (a quality also present on the Panda-sung ""Chores"") merging with a Phil Spector-produced instrumental single. The sound is huge, but the song is a simple ode to being needed, about the pleasure in caring for something, whether a child or family pet (""Derek never woke up at night/ And in the morning he's ready to go/ And he never had a voice like you/ To scream when he wanted something""). In other words, it's about accepting responsibility and most of all about growing up, which is something Animal Collective seem to be doing brilliantly, with their creativity and adventurous spirit intact.

She asked me if I needed anything.  I said, 'I think I spilled my drink.'"" The year of the record's title, and its toll on one particular relationship, was <em>AotY</em>'s narrative frame; its 12 tracks flipped by like a time-lapse calendar, from April to April. Gimmicky?  Sure. But it worked, by playing to Kasher's interpretive strengths: magnifying the heartrending minutae of romantic relationships, and rendering them gracefully and with a sense of humor.</p><p>
    Compare <em>AotY</em>'s opening to that of Kasher's latest Good Life excursion, <em>Help Wanted Nights</em>: ""Things are good/ We should take a Polaroid/ A memento, before the moment's destroyed.""  The preservationist similarities show that Kasher's still interested in examining fleeting, fictional moments and crafting big stories from varying narrational perspectives. But this time, he's trying to capture a world of others' lives in vignette form, fostered by a screenplay he's written that gives the album its title and inspiration.  Last April, <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/42347-tim-kasher-talks-good-life-screenplay-move-to-la""><u>Kasher told Pitchfork</u></a> that the film documents ""roughly a week in a bar in a small town where a stranger's car breaks down... he fraternizes with the regulars, getting too wrapped up in their sordid lives.""</p><p>
    Two consecutive concept albums dealing with boozers and their second homes isn't anything new for Hold Steady fans, but Kasher's mode of storytelling diverges from Craig Finn's in at least one way: He's less concerned with creating character archetypes that allow listeners to fill in the gaps with their own experiences than he is in playing with language.  Or, as Kasher himself said, ""I tried to focus less on narrative and more on those big ideas.""</p><p>
    In keeping with another well-established narrative, Kasher's finished screenplay took him from Omaha to Los Angeles, and <em>Help Wanted Nights</em> often trades in the countrypolitan indie-folk toward which Kasher's pal Conor also moved, especially on the slick, brushed-drum amble of ""Picket Fence"", ""Your Share of Men"", and ""Playing Dumb"".  Elsewhere, the sleek, echoing guitars and spacious arrangements lend the record a shimmering lilt not too dissimilar from Rilo Kiley's sole Saddle Creek spin <em>The Execution of All Things</em>.  ""Keely Aimee"", in particular, breezes past with brisk guitars and a gently funky pulse augmenting Kasher's cautious optimism:  ""Keely, I love your suffering/ Like gravity loves a stumbling drunk.""</p><p>
    An authentic move toward country also means that lyrical puns and extended metaphors dealing with love gone wrong are in full bloom.  <em>Help</em>'s title is explained in ""A Little Bit More"", when Kasher inquires: ""You flipped the sign in your window/ But baby, are you really closed?"".  During ""Share"" he offers the solicitation, ""You're a fool for the wounded/ I'm a man in need of bandages/ So wrap me up and take me home,"" and on ""You Don't Feel Like Home to Me"", he indulges in melancholy: ""He sees her face/ In the highway signs/ In the traffic lights/ And she's turning red.""</p><p>
    Often referred to as Kasher's side project, and initiated as a dumping ground for his non-Cursive material, The Good Life has taken on an independent existence as an outlet for his more ambitious ideas.   <em>Help Wanted Nights </em>finally finds him challenging himself again, imposing constraints and seeing how well he can work within them.</p></div>"|10648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10648-help-wanted-nights/|7.0|Eric Harvey

    In 1969, Berry Gordy gave an instrumental track that had originally been intended for Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips to the Jackson 5. His new writing team of Alphonso Mizell, Deke Richards, Freddie Perren, and Gordy himself, officially christened The Corporation<sup>TM</sup>, wrote ""I Want You Back"" for the Jackson brothers to sing over the track. It was the first of four straight number one hits for the group and is pretty easily the greatest kid soul tune ever recorded. The sight of those four straight number ones set off light bulbs in the heads of controlling fathers, gangsters, housewives, DJs, and opportunists across the country, who were convinced that they had the next Jackson 5 playing hopscotch down the block.</p><p>
    There are thousands of records out there featuring soul kids, from the somewhat obscure, like Foster Sylvers, to the totally unknown, which is where this compilation comes in. This is a tough compilation to judge relative to other soul anthologies, or even other kids' music anthologies. For one thing, though these songs are sung by children ranging from pre-K all the way through high school, they are in no way intended for children. It's a bizarre world where kids who still believe in cooties are handed songs by adult composers who think nothing of projecting their romantic troubles and the sexual tension of their relationships onto their pintsize scions.</p><p>
    The tension between childhood naïveté and sexual awakening is what makes this music compelling. In terms of technique and listening enjoyment, these tracks are all over the place, but they all have a special, even faintly tragic sense of misplaced hope and hijacked innocence that makes them affecting. There are a couple of minor masterpieces here. ""I'm Not Ready For Love"", by a quartet of teenaged Maryland girls named Promise by their producer, is a tightly arranged number with a stellar vocal arrangement, a captivating melody and amazing lyrics like, ""I'm not ready to fuss and fight/ I'm not ready to cry all night/ Waiting by the phone,"" certainly not a glass-half-full view of adult love.
    </p>
<p>
    Tampa's Triads appear with an astounding track called ""If You're Looking For Love"" that features great close harmonies and a walloping funk backing-- the vocalists sound reasonably mature, and this could have been a small hit if it had received any distribution at all. Cindy &amp; the Playmates look forward to summer vacation on ""Now That School Is Through"", but the backing vocals have an initially incongruous noir vibe that takes the song to another level. The conversation that pops up over the fade is priceless: ""What are you doing this summer?"" Cindy asks her boyfriend. ""I'm just gonna lay around and take it easy,"" he replies, and naturally, she asks, ""Can I come too?""
    </p>
<p>
    Some of the material is less directly grabbing, and more interesting from an intellectual standpoint. The 3 Stars' ""Jersey Slide, Pt. 1"" is a would-be dance craze track ambitiously written so that the three extremely young singers trade off rapid-fire lines, but for all their effort, the kids can't pull it off with authority. Altyrone Deno Brown, previously heard on the second volume of Numero Group's Eccentric Soul series, sounds like he has a head cold, and while nine-year-old Jack of Jack &amp; the Mods has incredible control over his voice, he still doesn't sound like he knows what he's singing about on ""One Is Enough For One"".
    </p>
<p>
    The Atons' ""Yellow Ribbon"" is just bizarre, opening with a teenaged guy chatting with his friends over a funk instrumental and kicking into a high-tempo, slightly keyless cover of ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree"" that defies the imagination. Even odder is Jr. &amp; the Soulettes' instrumental ""2009 Cherry Soul Sound"", not because it features an eleven-year-old shredding through a wah-wah pedal, but because almost no child groups made instrumentals-- the market for the music was built around voices. Patrizia &amp; Jimmy open the compilation with an astonishing track from 1974 that is essentially hip-hop. ""Trust Your Child, pt. 1"" rides a sharp mid-tempo funk beat while Patrizia authoritatively raps out a lecture to parents admonishing them to respect their children.
    </p>
<p>
    Different people will listen to this music for different reasons. Some are voyeurs looking for the garish train wreck, some are drawn to the fragile hope and sense of possibility in the recordings, others are just looking for a good drum break or even something genuinely great. You get a little of all of that here. The eclectic range of the material is remarkable, but the big draw is the confluence of innocence and experience we've all lived through. Think about it another way: when the Beatles got all starry-eyed about holding hands, they were faking or remembering innocence to a degree. These kids actually have it.

    A serious contender for the dubious Most Overlooked
    Rap Album of the Millennium Award, Kano's
    <em>Home Sweet Home</em> introduced us to a British MC gifted with the dexterity of a young
    Jay-Z, the heady pathos of a young Nas, and the baby-faced charm of a young LL
    Cool J. The album sounded distinctly UK while offering an alternative to grime's
    all-systems-go formula, thanks in large part to beats that ranged from
    Kanye West-style speed soul to Rick Rubin-esque Marshall stack bap. And at the
    center was Kano, a naturally alluring
    vocalist smooth enough to calm nerves and smart enough to act like himself in a genre
    teeming with poseurs and hucksters. ""I can't be bothered with bars or
    weed/ I'd rather spit 16 bars for P's,"" he admitted on one of the album's many
    nerdy and honest lines about his superior work ethic.</p><p>
    But the CD didn't quite
    break through to the British mainstream and it was never granted a release in
    the U.S., the
    home of most of Kano's musical
    heroes. On the recent mixtape cut ""Layer Cake"", the rapper bemoaned
    his slept-on plot: ""I'm in the in-dust-ry, man/ In Eng-a-land/ Where I
    never sell more than an indie band."" He tries to remedy his ho-hum sales and
    bolster his rep with <em>London Town</em>,
    a scattershot sophomore record that replaces his appealing self-conscious
    anxiety and innocence with hollow angst, slackened intensity, and Damon Albarn.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Opener ""The Product of My Environment"", with its C-side beat and typical allusions to dead bodies makes <em>London Town</em>'s
    chief dilemma clear: Kano is confused as to whether he should rap about what he
    knows or what he thinks the masses want to hear. While <em>Home Sweet Home</em> found an exceptional balance between
    the Brit's street and pop sides, Kano
    decided to separate his split personality this year, relegating his harder edge-- and several high-quality original beats-- to a recent, vastly superior mixtape. This leaves his commercial side to run
    rampant on the new album,
    and it makes for an infinitely frustrating mash.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    While the girl at the center of ""Bad Boy"" might be
    a bit more reserved than your typical hip-hop club-dweller (""I know you
    ain't easy,"" raps Kano), the song eventually dissolves into an inanity
    that once seemed below this MC: ""I'm strictly on chicks,
    chicks, chicks/ In the back of the taxi or in the bedroom I give 'em the dick,
    dick, dick.""  Ugh. This stands in crass contrast to <em>Home</em>'s brilliant ballads,
    ""Nite Nite"" and ""Brown Eyes"", which bypassed mere
    dick waving for surprisingly mature ambiguities and vulnerability. This subtler, wiser Kano
    shows up briefly on single ""This Is the Girl"", a massive,
    synth-driven rap&amp;b ode to not having sex with groupies. On the song, forgotten
    two-stepper Craig David fits perfectly in between the rapper's monogamy
    tribulations, helping ""Girl"" become one of <em>London
    Town</em>'s few fan-grabs that truly
    connects. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Located in the dead center of the album, ""Fightin' the
    Nation"" and ""Feel Free"" bring things to a disconcerting halt
    with their gasbag morality screeds. A corny, acoustic guitar-driven
    interpolation of Junior Murvin's ""Police and Thieves"",
    ""Nation"" sets up a manipulative tale of urban strife that could
    offer only specks of originality to those completely unfamiliar with hip-hop.
    ""Daddy don't exist-- such a cliché these days,"" rhymes Kano,
    basically calling out his own bullshit mid-verse. ""If I ain't usin' my
    status to make a change I ain't ever makin' hits,"" he claims later, but the line comes off as insincere from an MC so obviously flailing for a hit of any sort, no matter its moral standing. If nothing else, it proves once again that using faux-conscious, sample-heavy
    tracks as a chart bid is a lose-lose. ""Feel Free"" might be even less
    effective. On it, Kano rides a
    sub-Gorillaz instrumental and emptily blathers about cleaning up communities
    while Damon Albarn picks his brain for a placeholder ""la la la"" hook. Bottom line:
    One Talib Kweli is (more than) enough. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""I need to find some inspiration before I'm fed up with
    this,"" says Kano near the end
    of the album, referring to the business of making music. On <em>London
    Town</em>, he sounds frighteningly
    uninspired and shoulder-shrug fed-up. At 22, he's already looking back to the
    days when rapping was fun on ""Me &amp; My Microphone"". Now, though,
    as songs like ""Over &amp; Over"" and ""Sleep Tight"" attest, Kano
    doesn't sound like he's enjoying himself too much. It's a shame. When I talked
    to the rapper before his debut was released two years ago, he all but predicted
    his current predicament: ""You can never really top the first time, but we'll
    see how it goes."" Somewhere between Most Overlooked and Most Disappointing
    lies a man trying to sell records by turning into a stretched-thin schizo.
    ""Write my own bars so if I flop it's on me,"" he says. At least we
    know whom to blame.<span> </span>

In the late 1970s, the scourge of all God-fearing long-hairs was the specter of their favorite rock bands going disco-- which, regardless of whether it resulted in a swaggering Stones classic or a turgid Rod Stewart atrocity, was a seen as horrific compromise of the band's integrity. VHS or Beta, meanwhile, seem interested in charting the opposite path. The band came out of Louisville five years back with an EP that practically hemorrhaged gleeful disco-house exuberance; even the title, <em>Le Funk</em>, seemed calculated to push the buttons of any Daft Punk nerd with latent rock inclinations. But each successive record has pushed them further towards a more commercially viable (and more familiar) status-quo identity.  2004's <em>Night on Fire</em> was a decent-enough Duran Duranish indie-dance record dropped at a time when decent-enough Duran Duranish indie-dance records were given away free in boxes of Count Chocula, and <em>Bring on the Comets</em> compromises their groove even more with further awkward excursions into over-earnest nu-wave.</p><p>
    Asking a rock band with a good rhythm section to play dance music's a lot more natural than taking a dance act and nudging them towards college-via-arena rock, and most of <em>Bring on the Comet</em>s hews pretty closely to the predictable outcome: pile on the synths and the bass and you get an endearing if unadventurous type of pop, but the further out front the guitars are, the more rote the song actually sounds. It goes downhill fast after the Thin Lizzy-guitar-augmented house throb of 68-second red herring opener ""Euglama"" fades out: ""Love in My Pocket"" churns along bloodlessly, banking on its skittery, skinny-tie twitch-rhythm to maintain a song that feels inert everywhere else, lyrics included (""I got whatcha want, if you want/ Come and get it"" isn't a line just anyone can pull off). Too bad it diverts all its energy to a tepid indie-pop jangle instead of cultivating any actual bass in the backbeat. The title track has similar problems, draining all the low end out and gambling everything it has on a guitar that soars just about high enough to brush against the stratospheric heights of, say, post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd. And despite the dampened 4/4 beat that opens it, ""The Stars Where We Came From"" isn't so much a dance track as it is a holding hands and swaying slightly while staring upwards track, especially when it disintegrates its groove to let an overproduced steel guitar-and-piano interlude barrel through like a big pompous freight train.</p><p>
    The album also happens to be tied together by all kinds of ostentatious spot-the-influence moments most retro-leaning hey-remember-the-80s bands are smart enough to dial down a bit. There's not much to do besides deconstruct the blueprint of a track when all you're really left with are clearly-labeled moments marked ""U2 riff"" or ""Cure melody"" or ""Depeche mode vocal affectation."" The latter's especially egregious: on ""Burn it All Down"" and ""Time Stands Still"", Craig Pfunder's vocals resemble the Muppet version of Dave Gahan. Or at least the Brandon Flowers version. Same difference, I guess. Not like Gahan or Flowers or most of the Muppets would sound right singing emptily edgy non-statements like ""We'll burn their flags, burn their house, burn the churches/ Burn it all down"" anyhow. (Apologies if that transcript's inaccurate; Pfunder's throaty faux-Brit mumblings make ""we'll"" indistinguishable from ""well"" and ""their"" sound exactly like ""the"".) And here's everything else you need to know about the lyrics: they were put together using an incomplete Ric Ocasek magnetic poetry kit.</p><p>
    It was a mistake for VHS or Beta to subjugate their dance beat into a perfunctory structure for the guitars to smash against;  the riffs sound like they're there for their own sake, biding their time and waiting for a moment of catchiness that never really arrives. (Where's Nile Rodgers when you need him?) They're still a rhythmically sound band, and every once in a while a chorus pops up that actually sounds a bit exciting-- even if, as in ""She Says"", it largely hinges on the phrase ""doo doo doo doo doo"". But the good bits are hard to define through the arena-rock interference, sort of like the scrambled cable porn evoked by the cover art. <em>Bring on the Comets</em> doesn't prove that good rock is harder to make than good disco, just that it's a lot easier to make boring.</p></div>"|10637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10637-bring-on-the-comets/|4.6|Nate Patrin

    Dave Longstreth, like a lot of visionaries, is so full of bright ideas he can barely keep his shit together. Part of the problem is that he's indiscriminate about what he eats: Gustav Mahler, reggaetón, Malian guitar music, Cole Porter, band members. He's helmed a different roster of musicians for each Dirty Projectors album, and each album has had its own agenda.  ""Jolly Jolly Jolly Ego"", from 2005's <em>The Getty Address</em>, plays like a parade of his fetishes: dissonant folk, looped bassoons, a rhythm track sounding like it was lifted from an R. Kelly record, and Longstreth in the middle, throttling his poor falsetto with vibrations violent enough to knock a drinking glass off a table.</p><p>
    After five or so years of cherrypicking from large groups of musicians, he's streamlined to a rock quartet, and they actually seem to matter to him in ways he can't shake: touring guitarist Amber Coffman and drummer Brian McOmber play on <em>Rise Above</em>; bassist and vocalist Angel Deradoorian hadn't joined yet, but has since been filling the parts played here by Nat Baldwin and Susanna Waiche. Hearing the band rip through material from last year's <em>New Attitude</em> EP on a recent <strong><a href=""http://www.daytrotter.com/daytrotterSessions/728/free-songs-dirty-projectors"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daytrotter session</a></strong> was like watching the glass slipper slide on.</p><p>
    While Longstreth's initial albums were mostly string-backed folk, he's now given himself up to rhythm-- in his words, his compositions have become more ""horizontal"" than ""vertical."" The horizontal's great for dancing-- an opportunity that arises a few times here-- but verticality is still the source of the songs' tensions. Coffman and Waiche's coos stack harmonies with Longstreth's bleat like little car wrecks, and even though the guitars move like a West African dance band or math rock, the songs seem propelled by the constant resolutions of notes rather than the beats themselves.
    </p>
<p>
    Then again, it's the combo-- a synthesis of heavy rhythms with an addiction to delicacy and ornament-- that makes Longstreth an innovative, paradoxical writer. ""Spray Paint (The Walls)"" is half-Soundgarden, half-Outkast. Some of this record sounds like Phish and some of it sounds like the Police. There's a verse in Esperanto. When Longstreth strides into the singer-songwriter spotlight, he's so determined to express himself he forgets the idea is to <em>share</em>, instead employing melisma that's so brutal it's almost embarrassing. And he sounds like he's having fun! And that's scary. <em>Rise Above</em> is serious, somewhat inhuman stuff, which is possibly why the band never smiles onstage: Longstreth, wide-eyed and focused, hair like wild grass; Deradoorian and Coffman looking eerily cornfed, as blank as backup singers in <em>Mullholland Drive</em>, their hands responsible for a completely different set of rhythms than their voices; McOmber a pair of arms occasionally rising above the wall. 
    </p>
<p>
    But newfound focus from the band brings newfound exhaustion for listeners. For all his supposed messiness, Longstreth is actually really brittle and anal-retentive. That the album has a concept-- a song-by-song ""reimagining"" of Black Flag's <em>Damaged</em>-- scarcely matters to the listener, although it seems good for Longstreth: It gives the illusion of an anchor. He recently told me that it was his attempt at making a ""New York album: angular, austere, obsessed with authenticity, like New York bands supposedly are."" The assumptions seem off, but he probably hit the mark. They're consumed with cultural appropriation and aesthetic polyamory-- a post-pop-art idea of authenticity. <em>Rise Above</em> is so concerned about its polyrhythmic arrangements and precision that it can be suffocating on full listens. And though Longstreth tries to find color and protest in a bunch of songs about hating everyone's face and wanting to die, it's almost an afterthought-- unsurprisingly, the album's most bracing moment comes during the break in ""Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie"", when Coffman and Waiche volley <em>oh</em>'s and <em>ah</em>'s without an English word in sight.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Rise Above</em> will drop plenty of jaws, and, like Deerhoof, Dirty Projectors are restructuring rock on a compositional level rather than a sonic one. To murder a cliché, whatever unfurls from Longstreth's brain next <em>isn't</em> anyone's guess-- <em>Rise Above</em>, for all its fastidiousness and minor drawbacks, finally displays the perfect counterargument to the portrait of him as another nutso college dropout: It displays a pattern. <br/></p></div>"|10577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10577-rise-above/|8.1|Mike Powell

Compiling a greatest hits collection must be something to squeeze in on a lazy Wednesday between lunch and a maybe a sweet post-lunch nap. An institution with vaults that comprise hundreds of records from the past 30 years, Greensleeves might not be as immediately beloved as Studio One or Trojan, or have the current cool kid cache Blood and Fire or Wackies, but its commercial dominance is continually assured thanks to its unerring A&amp;R ear and three decades' worth of Jamaica's biggest stars and their valuable back catalogs. And as <em>From Dubplate to Download</em> proves, the label's artistic dominance is inextricably tied up with its commercial acumen, presenting 30 sterling hits stretching from the fading cries and laments of the last days of roots reggae to the deviousness of the latest dancehall tune from the yard.</p><p>
    Even conceiving a one-stop introduction to Greensleeves would give anyone a migraine. Instead this is something even better: A greatest hits collection/label sampler without a single wack track and more than its share of entrants into the dancehall hall of fame. (Though there are at least a few problematic tunes, which we'll get to.) And if that seems improbable to you, or overstated, well, you'll just have to play it to be sure. The tracklist is a post-reggae marquee that's barely wide enough to hold all the lights: Beenie Man, Shabba Ranks, Gregory Issacs, Shaggy, Wayne Smith, Mr. Vegas, Yellowman. Listen start-to-finish and you find yourself inadvertently traversing many historical divides, from
    the bubbling analogue skank of the Wailing Souls' ""War"" to the bizarrely squished digital drum machine on Vybz Kartel's ""Tekk"", from Dr. Alimantado's quest for religious unity to Ward 21 and Bounty Killer's thrill-seeking lawlessness.</p><p>
    But the history lesson is almost incidental, a happy didactic byproduct of the record's organizing principle. ""Learning value"" be damned, <em>From Dubplate</em> is at heart a pure pop pleasure product to be replayed in full again and again, by turns robust and dashed off, rootsically warm and computer chilled, violent and mournful, hilarious and dead serious, sexy and secular, religious and righteous. It's a string of contradictions laid chronologically end to end and designed to play off dancehall's schizo style by placing a sweetly crooned love song that
    practically predicts the kind of sugary singjay territory Akon has made his own (Wayne Wonder's ""No Letting Go"") right next to a song that advocates bloody retribution as if it was a new dance craze (Elephant Man's ""Log On""). Tippa Irie sounds like he should be sporting a white top hat and tails on the ersatz Broadway shuffle of ""Hello Darling"", a cheeky courting song that comes just before J.C. Lodge's panting and sweating lover's rock ode to the joys of phone sex. And then Gregory Issacs pleads his innocence to the Kingston police over the exact same riddim on the very next track. Needless to say I'd need another 600 words just to catalog the various shifts in vocal pitch, timbre, grain, and groove, from blackhearted and gruff to eyelash kiss gentle.</p><p>
    Despite the flip-flop between tempo and mood and all the contradictory talk of love of Jah and love of guns and sexual love and love of sweet smoke, the compilation works better as an end-to-end listening experience (and a great party mix for lazy selectors) than most other highly touted pop records I've heard this year. Points inevitably have to be deducted for including trash like ""Log On"", a call to anti-homosexual violence only made more indefensible by its great groove. (Just because homophobic tripe was a hit doesn't mean it needs to be enshrined.) But
    to overlook the collection as a whole because it contains occasionally offensive sentiments would be throwing the party out with the ignorant bathwater. This is one of the year's best unmixed corporate mixtapes, and those who claim the well-worn choices make the record a snore are being boorish. If you can deny the power of tunes like ""Under Mi Sleng Teng"", ""Oh Carolina"", and ""Who Am I"", even on the hundreth listen, I and I certainly won't be letting your non-irie ass DJ at my house any time soon.</p></div>"|10636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10636-from-dubplate-to-download-the-best-of-greensleeves-records/|9.0|Jess Harvell

    Shel Silverstein is a master of the aabb rhyme scheme, which is too often abused by unimaginative or naïve musicians. In his poetry and his songwriting-- not that there's that much distinction between the two-- he uses seemingly simplistic line-ending rhymes to underscore his fanciful ideas, whimsical humor, and gentle subversion. For example, the colloquial cadence and limerick line rhythms in this description of Paul Bunyan's sexual appetite downplay the bawdy and emphasize the comic:</p><p>
<em>
    Well, you talk about women, that man's so lusty<br>
    Needs a woman every hour just to keep from gettin' rusty<br>
    And the young ones run and the old ones crawl...<br>
    To Paul</br></br></br></em></p><p>
    That song, unassumingly titled ""Paul"", first appeared on Silverstein's 1968 album <em>Dirty Feet</em>, but the definitive take comes from the best-selling 1973 album <em>Bobby Bare Sings Lullabys, Legends &amp; Lies</em>, the first of several collaborations between the two musicians, recently reissued in a 2xCD Legacy Edition. Despite the absence of his name on the spine, Silverstein is as much a presence on this album as Bare, for he provides everything in the title but ""Bare"" and ""Sings"" (and ""&amp;"", if you want to get technical). The title track supplies a pretty matter-of-fact introduction to this concept album: ""Gather 'round ladies, come sit at my feet/ I'll sing about warm sunny skies/ There's mermaids and beans and lovin' machines/ In my lullabys, legends, and lies.""
    </p>
<p>
    Of course that song ends in a sing-along, and of course the lyrics are true to their word: the baker's dozen tracks that follow-- all penned by Silverstein-- tell of voodoo witches, mermaid lovers, mechanical women, barroom brawlers, and, of course, gigantic lumberjacks. The tone alternates persuasively between the gleefully silly (""The Mermaid"", ""True Story"") and the gently mournful (""Rosalie's Good Eats Café""), which has as much to do with Bare's vocals as Silverstein's words. His singularly laidback singing style, at once relaxed and expressive, fits these songs perfectly, never overselling their childlike appeal nor diluting their emotional weight. Even 34 years after its release, it still plays like the best hippie redneck adult children's album ever made.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Daddy What If"" is the aural equivalent of <a href=""http://cuteoverload.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>cuteoverload.com</strong></a>, with five-year-old Bobby Bare Jr. (making his recording debut) subbing for snuggly animals. Both Silverstein and Bare seem to have realized that at the time country music was one of the few genres that could traffic in such unabashed sentimentality and not come across as mawkish or condescending. In this context, songs like ""Daddy What If"" or ""In the Hills of Shiloh"" (about Civil War widows) or ""The Wonderful Soup Stone"" (about imagination as a salve for hard times) are all the more poignant for having no ulterior ironies or subtext of any kind. As a result, they are able to address the child in every adult while respecting the adult in every child.
    </p>
<p>
    A second disc collects the duo's later collaborations, culling mostly from Bare's subsequent albums and striking the same balance between humorous and ruminative. ""Singin' in the Kitchen"" features Bare, his wife, and their children banging on pots and pans; ""$100,000 in Pennies"" recounts the travails of the world's unluckiest bank robber. By contrast, ""Sylvia's Mother"", a hit for Bare as well as for Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show, is a conversation between Sylvia's mother and Sylvia's heartbroken ex-lover, and the confines of the concept-- the he-said, she-said structure, the pre-chorus announcement from the operator-- keep the emotions immediate but understated.
    </p>
<p>
    Inspired by the local hullabaloo following Lester Flatt's death, but now relevant to any country singer older than 60, ""Rough on the Living"" is one of the most powerful examinations of Music Row's curious disdain for and veneration of its legends: ""They didn't want him around when he's livin',"" Bare sings achingly and accusingly, ""but he's sure a good friend when he's dead."" It's hard not to miss the irony the song has accrued over the years: Despite the successes of <em>Lullabys, Legends &amp; Lies</em> and subsequent hit albums, both Silverstein, who died in 1999, and Bare are better known outside of Nashville, as a children's author and an alt-country icon, respectively. But this reissue is a good reminder that they once charmed the city with complex compositions that still sound like the simplest of pleasures.

    The Budos Band's second album, much like their first one, is
    practically an archeological dig. They've broken down through all the strata of
    the post-punk/post-disco era to uncover the fertile soil of late 1960s and early
    70s Afrofunk and soul-jazz, not to mention funky 70s blaxploitation soundtracks,
    60s Now Sound LPs, Ethio-jazz and plain old superbad funk. The end result is
    something so hip it could kill you in large doses-in the right doses it just
    plain kills.</p><p>
    The Budos crew hails from Brooklyn, but their outlook is
    definitely global-- they somewhat restrictively term what they do ""Afro-soul,""
    which works well as a basic distillation of what they do and probably at least
    tells the right people to listen. It's strictly instrumental, but never showy,
    and they avoid protracted compositions-- there are no twenty-minute Fela-inspired
    burners on here, just a ton of memorable, concise tracks stuffed with compact
    solos and big themes played by a big horn section.</p><p>
    The band's rhythm section is truly fantastic. The bass is
    right in the pocket, the drums keep everything steady and driving, the judiciously
    employed hand percussion adds a gritty texture, and the guitar does everything
    from wah'd-out scratching to playing snaky, surfy leads. Checking
    over the songwriting credits, I was initially surprised to see Smokey
    Robinson's name in the credit for ""His Girl"", but listening closely, it is, in
    fact, based very loosely on ""My Girl"". It's so thoroughly altered that they
    could have gotten away with calling it an original, especially at this
    breakneck tempo, but either way, I'd be willing to bet Smokey never imagined
    his tune being blasted out by a smoking horn section over a chunky Afrobeat
    groove. 
    </p>
<p>
    The band gets into Mulatu Astatke's Ethio-jazz territory on
    ""Origin of Man"", which cleverly references Mulatu's homeland of Ethiopia in its
    title. The dark, deliberate rhythm track is offset by a squealing organ and
    horns that have just a slight Latin tinge to them. There's not a bad track
    here, but my favorite might be ""King Cobra"", which opens with a cool, minor-key
    passage of film-noir guitar and busts into a crazed horror organ solo after the
    horns say their part. Opener ""Chicago Falcon"" has a wicked groove and excellent
    horn arrangement that pits legato passages against bursts of staccato. It's
    like the greatest library track DeWolfe never released in the 70s. 
    </p>
<p>
    This is a supremely entertaining record, perfect for
    dancing, driving or just providing a soundtrack when you want to nod your head
    in time to something. The true secret to the Budos Band's success is that they
    keep it short and to the point. Only a few songs even make it past four
    minutes, and those are that long because they're able to sustain it. When your
    whole sound is based on the groove, keeping your listener wanting more is
    essential, and this does that. While it doesn't really represent a change
    from their first album, <em>II</em> is proof
    that the Budos Band's formula is good for a lot of mileage. I know I'll be listening a lot.

    Mick Harvey is one of the many musicians few have heard of but most have heard. The Australian multi-instrumentalist has been Nick Cave's right-hand man for decades-- in the Boys Next Door, the Birthday Party, and the Bad Seeds-- and was also a member of Crime &amp; the City Solution in addition to scoring numerous films. This is his fourth solo album, and it follows right in the path of his previous three-- darkly tinged versions of other people's songs and a few originals, all engineered for closing time. His first two solo albums, 1995's <em>Intoxicated Man</em> and 1997's <em>Pink Elephants</em>, were English-language tributes to Serge Gainsbourg, and his last, 2005's <em>One Man's Treasure</em>, drew from the catalogs of Lee Hazlewood, Scott Walker, and other outsiders.</p><p>
    On <em>Two of Diamonds</em>, Harvey sandwiches three originals around a largely well selected batch of other people's tunes, primarily fellow Australians, including the Triffids, the Saints, the Loved Ones, and his own Crime &amp; the City Solution. As an interpreter, Harvey is also an unabashed stylist, and he brings everything he touches into his slow tempo, low-light world, making it his own. His voice is good for it, not overtly powerful, but still deep and commanding; he sometimes sounds like he's singing to himself, but with this music, that approach actually works.</p><p>
    One of his best selections here is the Triffids' ""Everything Is Fixed"", which he and his band turn into a burning, bluesy electro-acoustic number, with standup bass and acoustic slide guitar balanced against crunching electric guitar and organ. His take on Bill Withers' ""I Don't Want You on My Mind"" replaces the original's funky blues edge with droning menace, and James Johnston adds an excellent slide guitar solo in the middle. Perhaps the album's best cover, though, is the sharp, brooding version of Aussie rock pioneers the Loved Ones' ""Sad Dark Eyes"". He leans right into the song's triple meter, and while his vocal isn't as intense as the original's on the chorus, he makes up for it by layering on Yardbirdsy harmonies and building it up dramatically.
    </p>
<p>
    His three originals stand up next to the other material. ""Slow-Motion-Movie-Star"" is the best of the three, proceeding methodically along a static chord progression as guitars swell and drop, cutting like saws through the song's solid underlying texture. If there's a problem on the album, it's that outside of the numerous highlights, it does tend to blur a bit. Harvey relies heavily on his formidable skills as an arranger to differentiate tracks from each other-- this serves his ascendant, shuffling version of Manu Chao's ""Out of Time Man"" perfectly, but on tracks with built-in melodies that aren't quite as distinctive the result is more atmospheric than memorable. <em>Two of Diamonds</em> ultimately works best as a mood piece.

Given all that, the idea of them hitting anything outside of a niche audience seemed slim. They're a go-to band for filth-rock puritans, even as their unhinged live shows have helped them slowly gain a larger audience with each album's release.</p><p>
<em>Good Bad Not Evil</em>, however, is the record where naysayers, disinterested friends and acquaintances, and anyone else within earshot has to sit up, shut up, and listen. The ""garage rock"" tag will perpetually follow this band, and while I'm not saying it isn't sometimes apt, there's a difference between being a revival act and seeming blissfully out of time. Black Lips' idea of being topical is writing a jilted love song to a girl named Katrina from New Orleans, and their idea of diversity is writing a country song about breaking a death to children (and sounding terribly inconvenienced by doing so). It's as if they missed the past 30 years of rock history; perhaps they drank the memory away.</p><p>
    While it may not be as blistering as the band's early work, or even this year's ""live"" <em>Los Valientes del Mundo Nuevo</em>-- because where else could you really go after that?-- <em>Good Bad</em> nonetheless stands tall in their catalog for finding a way to turn it down without becoming tame. Here, Black Lips fold all of the bacchanalia into the corners of direct, vintage pop songs, so that the new tracks have taken on an ominous tone without being quite as off-the-rails as the band's reputation would suggest. Note the brief moments of backwards guitar in the otherwise, uh, lean ""Lean"", a twangy undistorted march with plenty of echo on the ragged vocals.</p><p>
    ""Veni Vidi Vici"" is the biggest and wariest step forward, with a drum loop somewhere between Motown and Madchester, replete with a vibra-slap that will forever evoke hot summer evenings and a chorus that's as irrepressible and arrogant as a soccer chant. Yet for the most part, Black Lips don't stray from their comfort zone, they just push that zone outward. Their spooky quasi-mystical element gets much spookier on ""Lock and Key"", a blues vamp slithering its way from an Indian burial ground, and their flower-punk gets more flowery on ""It Feels Alright"" (formerly ""Good Bad Not Evil""), where singer Cole Alexander varies his voice to evoke two singers-- a touch that's charming, almost comical, and completely punk.</p><p>
    The band is still preoccupied with its reckless bad-boy image, as ""Bad Kids"" is a country-inflected sing-along to the merits of irresponsibility that sounds so puerile it's almost self-deprecating. Still, they're hardly one-note here: ""Cold Hands"" is the record's lead-off single and probably its catchiest song, but it's more wounded than brash, lyrically occupied with trying the straight and narrow and failing rather than eschewing it entirely. It's a nice change of pace that hits a new emotional center-- for two-and-a-half minutes anyway.</p><p>
    Throwbacks to earlier albums-- such as ""Slime and Oxygen"", with its stomping circular rhythms, caterwauling guitar bends, and more-than-usual vocal echo-- already pale next to the braver material. Even the record's few missteps are at least adventurous, including colliding immaturity with more mysticism on the toy-piano-led ""Transcendental Light"". Were you to grab any of their older records-- which you really should-- you could hear a band out-freak the best of them. But <em>Good Bad Not Evil</em> is evidence that they want to do something more, which is heartening-- and here they've accomplished it.</p></div>"|10626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10626-good-bad-not-evil/|8.3|Jason Crock

He asked how it was going, and without thinking it over too much, I said although the writer's early sentences could get dense, it felt great returning to a difficult work once it's become almost second-nature familiar. The same could be said for this 20th Anniversary Edition of Napalm Death's <em>Scum</em>.</p><p>
    I just stopped short of writing ""Napalm Death's groundbreaking <em>Scum</em>."" The English band is rightfully credited with helping to invent grindcore, or at least mixing ingredients that bubbled to the surface and terming a sound that was happening to different degrees elsewhere as well, but <em>Scum</em>'s always felt most important to me for establishing a template later extreme metal bands could have fun smashing and expanding. So we could argue about whether this is ""seminal"" or not but dropping record-geek tropes glosses over the fact that these 28 raw, compelling, sometimes just okay
    songs are actually scruffy, crusty <em>tunes</em>.</p><p>
    This reissue finds the thrashing, guttural Birmingham trio (and then quartet and then...) new again, context properly reaffixed. 
    It was always there, sure, but as someone too young to get into <em>Scum</em> entirely in 1987 (physically or mentally), it's a treat to have a reason to stop taking it for granted and to really absorb it with its details in mind, instead of plopping it on during a standard death'n'grind listening session. The Napalm Death that exists now, and continues trucking (the 12th Napalm album <em>Smear Campaign</em> was released last year), isn't this band. Not at all. No original members remain. In fact, the folks who got together in 1981 under the Naplam banner were already gone by the second dozen tracks on <em>Scum</em>-- only drummer Mick Harris, who joined in 1985, plays on both sides. (It's a shame. I've always wished Justin Broadrick could somehow pair his scissoring/slashing guitars with Lee Dorrian's evil vocals. Was never a huge fan of Nicholas Bullen's deeper-but-not-deep enough growl.)
    </p><p>
    It's simple, super-fast music. No
    tracks live past two minutes. Most handle about three chords or knifing guitar wounds (though the seams feel like they're constantly ready to tear or split under the weight of those blast beats). When you hear the anomolous atmospheric lift-off and guttural chants of ""Multinational Corporations"" you already know what's coming next, but diving in's still exhilarating. 
    </p>
<p>
    The first dozen was put to tape in August 1986. The highlights remain Broadrick's slippery solos on ""Seige of Power"" and ""Polluted Minds"", the precipitous ""Caught...in a Dream"", the slower/groovier ""Human Garbage"", that skittering spacy patch in ""Sacrifice,"" and, of course, the second-and-change-long (1.316, to be exact) ""You Suffer"". But who am I kidding-- they're best experienced as a giant, fuzzed, angry whirl. 
    </p>
<p>
    To me the most exciting moment is still the way the sounds and gradations shift so thoroughly with ""Life?"". That's track 13, intrepid listener, the first of a dozen songs recorded in July 1987 by the different, four-man crew who put together the rest of the album. People quit Napalm Death often. Seriously, though, that tinny, helter skelter transition feels like a monumental sign of the band's ever-shifting future. This is where it gets really nasty. The highlight of these ""later songs"" is the overall claustrophobia and the withered, weathered voice of Lee Dorrian (who went on to form Cathedral). Check out the hellfire of ""Divine Death"", ""Pseudo Youth"", or the blistering ""M.A.D.""
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, the reissue comes with extras and hooks. Why get the new? Well, there's a 45-minute behind-the-music DVD, <em>The Scum Story</em>. On it, Mick Harris walks down memory lane (visiting olden-day practice spaces, Rich Bitch Studios, where the album was recorded, etc) and there are interviews with Earache founder Digby Pearson, Mark Titchner, <em>Kerrang!</em> writer Dom Lawson, and more.
    </p>
<p>
    In the end, DVD and history and all that shit aside, what's strangest about close listening to something you thought you knew by heart is how unfamiliar and un-extreme <em>Scum</em> sounds in light of the music it helped birth. Sure, it's kind of obvious, and that's just how it goes with these sorts of things, but kids who've never heard Napalm Death's salad days, and who've cut their teeth on Cephalic Carnage, Nile, Behemoth, or even Dillinger Escape Plan might find it, gulp, sorta tame. Dillinger Escape Plan? Right, time's a motherfucker.

    Manu Chao makes music that cuts across cultural lines. As
    though singing in seven languages (French, Spanish, Galician, Arabic, English,
    Portuguese, and Wolof) wasn't enough, he brings aspects of music from across
    Western Europe, North Africa, and the Americas into his sound. You could
    say he was destined to live a life between cultures from the start. He was born
    in Paris to
    Spanish parents who had fled Franco's regime. His mother was from Bilbao, in Basque country, while his father was a
    journalist from Galicia, a
    region in far northwestern Spain
    that, like Basque country, has its own unique language.</p><p>
    Chao isn't a big name in the U.S.,
    but American listeners shouldn't let that fool them-- he's immensely popular in
    Europe and Latin America, and he has ties to
    and fans within leftist organizations all over the globe. His second band, the
    Clash-influenced Mano Negra, was named for a Spanish anarchist organization,
    and these days he mixes his criticism of the Bush Administration with praise
    for the Zapatistas of Mexico's Chiapas
    state. This is all to say that behind that super-bright artwork and the smiling
    cover shot, there's a lot of multi-lingual political agitation on <em>La Radiolina</em>, his third internationally
    released solo album.</p><p>
    His last two LPs, 1998's <em>Clandestino</em> and 2001's <em>Proxima
    Estacion: Esperanza</em> (<em>Next Station:
    Hope</em>), both moved away from the heavily punk-influenced sound of his early
    bands, though not completely. It was just that the influence of reggae, salsa,
    dub, European and South American folk, and other things rose to equal the
    sounds that guided his music early on. As a result, those two albums were
    exciting journeys across continents that were essentially impossible to absorb
    fully on one or even two listens. They rewarded repeat listening richly,
    though, and <em>La Radiolina</em> does much
    the same.
    </p>
<p>
    Chao's albums tend to be fragmented affairs, and this record's 21 songs in 51 minutes certainly bear that out, but his
    fragmentation usually doesn't hinder the flow of his ideas. On a first pass, the most
    immediately noticeable thing about <em>La
    Radiolina</em> is how relatively rocked-up it is relative to its two
    predecessors. It's as though his old affiliation with the Latin Alternative
    movement and punk decided to reassert themselves. Mind you, it's not the kind
    of rock that's going to smack you around with its riffs and stomping drums-- this
    is more measured than that, and cut with so many global influences that it
    can't help sounding unique.
    </p>
<p>
    The surging lead single ""Rainin' in Paradize"" is about as straight-ahead with its rock as Chao
    gets here. It has a lead guitar that plays an insidiously catchy part low
    in the mix, a technique repeated elsewhere on the album, and Chao's nasal,
    double-tracked voice lends it an ingratiating vibe that a more growling or
    strident delivery might have wiped away. ""Me Llaman Calle"" has an acoustic,
    Cubano-Iberian feel, with claves and fluttering flamenco guitar. The album
    delves heavily and very successfully into a full-on Cuban passage at the
    beginning of its final third-- ""Mala Fama"" is the album's most haunting song
    with its swaying rhythms and snaking, muted horns.
    </p>
<p>
    In between, the album touches on a dizzying array of
    textures and rhythms, alternating acoustic set-ups with electric ones, bringing
    in horn sections and dispensing with them just as quickly. The overall feeling
    is that of a series of thoughts contained within songs, none of
    which is quite complete without those around them. It behaves almost as a
    suite, though there two or three short movements that could have been dropped
    without consequence. For instance, the sirens that form part of the texture of
    ""El Hoyo"" didn't need a loud reprise in ""Panik Panik"", which takes an
    interesting idea too far, marring the album's late flow. 
    </p>
<p>
    Manu Chao is living proof that you don't have to be big in
    the U.S.
    to be one of the world's most important and influential musicians, and <em>La Radiolina</em> provides a healthy reminder
    it's a big world out there beyond our borders. Plus, it's pretty much
    impossible not to pump your fist along to a charging track like the horn-soaked
    ""Tristeza Maleza."" The album is not as wholly satisfying as either <em>Clandestino</em> or <em>Esperanza</em>, mostly due to a handful of truncated, underdeveloped
    tracks toward the end, but it's still full of excellent songs and inspired
    collisions.

    Though Sarah Shannon's voice was the perfect thing to soften the edges of Velocity Girl's beloved bubblegrunge, there was always a sense that the songs didn't really suit her strengths. Now eleven years after the group went the way of Spent and Jenifer Convertible, that's not a problem. From the smart Sinatra-esque chapeau she sports on the <em>City Morning Song</em> cover, to the cover design (which, although appropriate, looks like someone turned the colored bars on the cover of V.G.'s <em>¡Simpatico!</em> 90 degrees and then barfed on them), Shannon has created the perfect package to accompany her newest collection of would-be standards. Her 2002 solo debut hinted at such a direction, while also keeping a toe dipped in familiar waters (thanks in part to Pedro the Lion's Blake Wescott co-writing half the album's tracks). If you're looking for more hints of her indie pop/rock past in <em>City Morning Song</em>, you'll have to be satisfied with the shout-outs in the press materials.</p><p>
    Most folks are probably playing the singer-songwriter card in pigeonholing this record (either Carole King or Norah Jones), but if you're looking for a more appropriate reference point, think of the great American songbook-- Irving Berlin, the Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, and so on. In her review of Shannon's eponymous debut, Pitchfork's Alison Fields wished that Shannon would lend her rich, warm voice to an album of Porter tunes. Though this record might not fulfill Alison's wish, Shannon's approximation of this sort of songcraft-- she has a songwriting credit on every track, and flies solo on six of them-- is the next best thing.</p><p>
    The album's chipper title track is the perfect opener, and it's not hard to imagine a video where Shannon dances down a city street like Gene Kelly. Elsewhere, she shows a knack for penning both conversational kiss-offs (""Near And Far"") and grandstanding showstoppers (""Sunlit Smile""). Ballads, like the forlorn ""Fading Heart"", or especially the hopeful ""Salton Sea"", are where she truly shines, her voice gliding soft and firm over the words. And the album's standout track, ""Watch Over You""-- which just so happens to be the one track that sounds most like something her previous group would do-- finds Shannon's measured croon perfectly matching the song's pensive, expectant tempo.
    </p>
<p>
    Sometimes, Shannon sounds a little too much like she's trying to sing, instead of simply singing (think of the difference between Madonna singing ""Material Girl"" and Madonna singing <em>Evita</em>), and sometimes Shannon's songs have her reaching for high notes that her voice can't quite get ahold of. But besides those minor quibbles, <em>City Morning Song</em> is probably the best thing Shannon's ever been associated with. And though the album may have hit the shelves all the way back in February, its warmth and splendor are perfect as summer gives way to fall.

    This exploration of drone, punk, and rock is Airiel's first full-length release after their <em>Winks and Kisses</em> series of EPs released in 2003 and 2004. <em>The Battle of Sealand</em> has obviously allowed the band to expand its vision, perhaps too widely. The flanging sustains of ""Introduction"", an immediate recollection of My Bloody Valentine, owe just as much to shoegazing pioneers Ride and even crossover radio acts like the Verve and Oasis-- if only because of Cory Osborne's vocal inflections, the band, based in Chicago, sounds undeniably British.</p><p>
    Many of the songs are too calculated, melodically speaking, and too emotive not to betray an indebtedness to punk, but the question is really not who's being referenced (a great slew), but to what degree this variety of songs can be enjoyed. It's a bit too soon to bring back the early 1990s, but this is what the band is unwittingly after, the pleasure being mostly derived from the moments when Airiel-- and we-- are carried away, somewhere in between the whiney slides of ""Thrown Idols"" and its guttural shreds and passionate falsettos. The production is a bonus-- well mastered, glossy, and clean, displaying every key change and genre shift, every piece in the nostalgic puzzle.</p><p>
    ""You Kids Should Know Better"" wants to get angry in a Kasabian kind of way, with howling, echoic, staccato vocal notes piercing an overstuffed atmosphere of what might be 35 layers of guitar-based noise, the effect being that either my volume is too high or the band made a little too much effort: ""Let's add a sixth bass track identical to the other five,"" and so forth. ""Mermaid in a Manhole"" is likable for its barebones reference to grunge and its title-- just one example of how the band appears to fret about the sweet stuff on the surface, but brutally masks any of the nonsense with their impressive command of a large hubbub of toiling instruments.
    </p>
<p>
    But there are eleven tracks on this album and a large number of them are the shy kids squeezed between the rambunctious bullies; the resulting disjuncture being, if you're in the mood for it, a kind of solace, but also a kind of joke. Just how were these tracks selected, and why? ""Stay"", perhaps inexplicably my favorite, is a sonic spinning of cotton candy, complete with smooth, aerated alto vocals from Osborne and the usual mix of guitar-drum-bass, here content to repeat essentially the same patterns: simple ascents in aurally pleasing key signatures. But they've made the crucial addition of strings, which suggests that the song is either an artifact of the band's early days or a new experiment that the thrashers weren't interested in exploring further. Here's where the instruments move more typically, guitars simply plucked, bows pulled from end to end, and vocal notes stretched. ""Stay"" is a far cry from the frothy shifts of a song like ""Peoria"", which is so interested in the wall of noise as to make the vocals a polyphony of churchy harmonies hanging out. The voices share a couple of notes with the instruments, but mainly hover in a porous, unresolved area of the scale, settling on a common note (or seven at once) for the final measure.
    </p>
<p>
    ""The Release"" is both a more sophisticated (dirtily produced, independently labeled) Good Charlotte track and a Drunken Boat throwback, with fierce, caffeinated drum work and a simpler, less-is-more melodic structure. The repeated line, ""I'm giving you up"" is the melodic essence of the song, the instruments bowing to its urgency instead of taking over the whole scene with a tidal wave of messy ceremony. This song, despite its slithery shifts and rather unpleasant ambiance, convinces us that it's doing what it set out to. Some of these tracks are so full of effort and pomp as to lose the listener's attention, while the successful ones immerse us in an awfully mired, tense, yet pretty world, where even recent contributions to musical history are savored and studied like fossils.

On his second proper full-length, <em>Night Falls Over Kortedala</em>-- out in Sweden now, and in the U.S. on <a href=""http://scdistribution.com/cat/sc_catalognew.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Secretly Canadian</strong></a> early next month-- Lekman's deadpan style of singing, sunny melodies, and wittily lovelorn lyrics are a lot like what he's been doing since 2004 debut LP <em>When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog</em>, and on the EPs compiled on 2005's <em>Oh You're So Silent Jens</em>.  ""So if you liked that, you'll love this,"" Jonathan Richman once wrote. Lekman quotes the phrase on his blog.</p><p>
    On the other hand, Jens Lekman isn't quite Jens Lekman anymore. He logged out of MySpace for the last time in February, dissatisfied with the impersonality of the medium. The <strong><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/jenslekman"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new Lekman</a></strong> is a 23-year-old American who so far has only one friend; he joins impostor Lekmans already populating Facebook and Friendster. The actual Lekman apparently finds something beautiful in these false copies of himself, and he's come to embrace them. ""Just like I've lately embraced all the misinterpretations in the media,"" he explains, again on his blog.</p><p>
    It all goes to show: Pop's true meaning is whatever we construct for it ourselves. Not just critics or obsessive music lovers, but you, me, and anyone to whom a song means anything. Lekman's stunning <em>Night Falls Over Kortedala</em> embraces this idea more fully than any release of the past few years-- more even than Girl Talk with his memory-pricking laptop references, Kanye West with his canny reuse of classic hooks from Curtis Mayfield and Daft Punk, or mash-up artists with their many one-trick tracks. Like the Avalanches if they sang their own tunes, Lekman borrows liberally from his memories and surroundings, then uses them to create a lush and romantic world worth misinterpreting again and again.
    </p><p>
    It's a world set mostly within the confines of a Gothenburg, Sweden neighborhood called Kortedala. For this, Lekman has called the album a failure; he'd intended to traverse more ambitious terrain. Whether through samples, stylistic appropriations, or simply lyrics, <em>Kortedala</em> is a globe-conquering record regardless. Its vinyl-crackling arrangements span the baroque pop of Scott Walker, the upbeat rhythms and bright harmonies of Northern soul, and the beach-party disco of fellow Swedish artists Air France, Studio, and the Tough Alliance. Along with wry, sometimes
    melancholic observations worthy of Richman or the Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt, these elements make for Lekman's best record, one likely to captivate even those who were skeptical of his previous releases.
    </p>
<p>
    The new album introduces Lekman draped in timpani, strings, and horns on ""And I Remember Every Kiss"", which samples classical violinist (and gatefold-sleeve inventor) Enoch Light. While recalling late-1960s Walker, the majestic opening also picks up where the Blueboy-sampled orchestration of <em>When I Said...</em> finale ""A Higher Power"" left off. ""I would never kiss anyone/ Who doesn't burn me like the sun,"" Lekman proclaims here. A track later, though, he admits to sometimes nearly regretting his first kiss: ""I see myself on my deathbed, saying, 'I wish I would have loved less.'"" But that's when Willie Rosario's orchestral cover of Jimmy Webb's ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix""-- also used by the Avalanches-- hits, in all its blissful glory. Love can lead to anguish and shame, but in ""Sipping on the Sweet Nectar"", the feeling is worth it.
    </p>
<p>
    With that, the voyage begins. Current single ""The Opposite of Hallelujah"" visits 1960s Motown by way of Glasgow chamber-pop; beats sampled from the Tough Alliance take the harp-twinkled melancholy of ""I'm Leaving You Because I Don't Love You"" to a club in the tropics. ""Shirin"" brings up the Iraq war as fact, not just political issue; it tells of an immigrant hairdresser at Kortedala Beauty Center (also the name of Lekman's home studio). On the slower ""It Was a Strange Time in My Life"", a portrait of the artist as a shy and self-loathing young man, a sample of an infant Lekman leads flute and chiming electric guitar into the not-so-distant past. ""I had a good time at the party when everyone had left,"" Lekman sings; throughout the album, backing vocals by El Perro del Mar's Sarah Assbring and Frida Hyvönen ensure his loneliness never overwhelms his charms.
    </p>
<p>
    And these are considerable. If rock'n'roll is ""the art of making the commonplace revelatory"", as critic Greil Marcus once wrote, this fey crooner is a rock'n'roller on par with the Streets' Mike Skinner. Lekman can sing about asthma inhalers, avocados, and a heart ""beating like Ringo""; on the aching standout ""A Postcard to Nina"", he describes an awkward conversation with a girl's stern father who makes clumsy jokes about lie detectors. All of it works. Over sampled a cappella doowop on ""Kanske Ar Jag Kar I Dig"" (Swedish for ""Maybe I'm In Love With You""), Lekman just rambles for a while about something stupid he saw on TV. ""This has of course nothing to do with anything/ I just get so nervous when talking with you,"" he finally admits.
    </p>
<p>
    Though not twee exactly, <em>Kortedala</em> may require an appetite for schmaltz-- another way Lekman makes ""the commonplace revelatory."" If his Four Seasons falsetto on ""Shirin"" sounds suddenly chic thanks to this year's <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvjRNYqV4ds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">great Pilooski re-edit</a></strong> of Frankie Valli's ""Beggin'"",<strong></strong><strong> </strong>then the unabashedly sentimental ""Your Arms Around Me"" might be the stumbling block for some listeners. (Its ukulele riff has already been compared to Hanson's ""MMMBop"".) It really doesn't matter; based on the Situationist concept of détournement, Lekman's song about an unfortunate kitchen mishap is a subversion of any bland source material. Besides, none of us can escape what's least cool about our past-- no matter what influences we list on our MySpace pages, it all informs our experience of pop. 
    Or I could just be misinterpreting again. 
    </p>
<p>
    Admittedly, no individual moment here quite rises to the heights of early single ""Maple Leaves"", which hinged on a mistake of its own: ""She said that we were just make believe, but I thought she said maple leaves."" As an album, however, <em>Kortedala</em> represents the most cohesive statement yet from an immensely talented artist whose early EPs once made him seem like a rebel against the LP form altogether. Like the Renaldo &amp; the Loaf-sampling ""Into Eternity"", it's a record about moments (and kisses) we take with us-- moments that we (or Lekman) may never have experienced: Our own Kortedala.
    </p>
<p>
    So, is ""Shirin"" the true story of Lekman's hairdresser? Is jaunty ""Friday Night at the Drive-in Bingo"" really inspired by Lekman's time working what he's described as ""the shittiest job in the world""? Did he even actually give up MySpace for good? Lekman takes great records down from their pedestal and reuses them in his art; it could be that he shows as little undue reverence for the facts of his own biography. Lekman follows an admonition from the Tough Alliance song sampled here, which they in turn lifted from 1980s UK left-wing skinhead band the Redskins: ""Take no heroes, only inspiration."" I can't wait until someone rips off this album.

    For a few years, Charles
    K. Thompson, better known as Frank Black or Black Francis, has been inching
    toward <em>Bluefinger</em>. Though he's been
    Frank Black on his records ever since the Pixies split in the early 1990s, signs
    that he was itching for a return to his rowdier, weirder, louder Black Francis
    persona have recently abounded. Most obviously, he's participated
    in a successful Pixies reunion, performing all the old favorites for new
    audiences, but more telling was his solo re-examination of Pixies
    material on his 2004 release <em>Frank Black
    Francis</em>.</p><p>
    He spent 2005 and 2006 in Nashville, making some of his quietest
    records, but in a lot of ways, those albums provided the perfect set-up for the
    return of Black Francis. Strangely, Black himself claims that the inspiration for resurrecting his old moniker had nothing to do with the Pixies or even himself, and
    everything to do with a deceased Dutch punk. According to Black, he was
    ""gripped by the spirit of Herman Brood"" while recording the bonus track for his
    <em>93-03</em> best of collection, released
    this summer.</p><p>
    Brood (it's pronounced ""Broat"") was a long-time fixture on
    the Netherlands
    music scene-- he played piano in the Nederbeat group Cuby &amp; the Blizzards in
    the 60s and later founded his own band. Brood was romantically linked to Nina
    Hagen in the 80s and achieved a great deal of prominence in his home country.
    He also had terrible problems with hard drugs for much of his life, and
    ultimately his health was so degraded that he committed suicide by leaping from
    the roof of the Amsterdam Hilton rather than wait for his ailments to take him. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's easy to get what Black sees in Brood-- they have a lot in
    common aesthetically. Brood's music ranges from loud, hard punk to cabaret and
    even a bit of bizarre swing pastiche-- another thing they have in common is that
    neither man has always stuck to his strengths. A great deal of <em>Bluefinger</em> was written with Brood in mind-- he's even directly named
    on one song, and there's a cover of his ""You Can't Break a Heart and Have It"".
    As the album gets going, it's clear we're in much different territory than any
    of the Nashville
    sessions ventured into. The lineup here is a simple trio of Black on guitar and
    vocals, Jason Carter on drums and Dan Schmid on bass, with backing vocals by
    Violet Clarke. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album opens with the nastiest rock blast we've had from
    Black in ages, with the charging one-two of ""Captain Pasty"" and ""Threshold
    Apprehension"", which was the bonus track on <em>93-03</em>.
    The bass and guitar sound on ""Captain Pasty"" harks back to ""Los Angeles"", but it's ""Threshold"" where the
    full, manic intensity implied by the switch back to the old name first comes
    out. The song is a ragged, pounding stomper, and Black's yelping, tweaked-out
    vocal performance is very nearly Pixies vintage. 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, Pixies weren't a one-note band, and a bunch
    of flailing punk songs with no variation wouldn't exactly reflect the Black
    Francis spirit Black is revisiting here. The album is varied, with a few songs
    that are closer in sound to his Catholics output and a couple that even reflect
    his time in Nashville,
    such as the harmonica-drenched ""Lolita"". The production is unfortunately dry
    and straightforward, with little in the way of post-production add-ons or reverb-- this has never served Black particularly well, and there are
    stretches where the music sounds bland because of the
    depthless recording approach. 
    </p>
<p>
    Black's partial tribute to Brood is
    good and bad-- Brood's personal travails provide good fodder for songs, but the homage gets downright awkward in places, none moreso than on ""Angels Come to
    Comfort You"", which almost reads as a congratulation to Brood for his suicide.
    Over a rockabilly-ish backing, Black retreats from the surreal imagery and
    abrupt juxtapositions that serve him well on the rest of the record in favor of
    lines like, ""He played piano really fucking good,"" and ""He was no saint/ But he
    was Dutch/ So he could paint."" The song is somewhat salvaged by a great coda
    featuring Clarke's wordless vocals layered into a choir of angels. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are only a few small points that actually sound like
    his work with the Pixies, so don't come in expecting a throwback to <em>Doolittle</em>-- besides, who's truly holding
    him to the standard of his old band these days? Frank Black solo will always be
    different no matter what he calls himself. <em>Bluefinger
    </em>is the best overall solo record Black has released in a long time, but it's
    still only good, not great. It will likely please a few fans who were getting
    sick of his ""Frank Black + Studio Giants"" phase, but we're also speaking
    relatively. Overall, this basically splits the difference between Frank Black
    and Black Francis, producing a few good songs but only rarely justifying the
    name switch.

    Occasionally mentioned in the pre-release press for Jesy Fortino's first LP as Tiny Vipers is her stage fright-- hands trembling while tuning her guitar, that sort of thing. Her trepidation, however, doesn't come from a lack of faith in her material as much as her avoidance of eye contact with the imminent indie inebriants impatiently waiting for a sort of music they're not going to get. Fortino, who included a 30-minute song on an early CD-R, distances herself from the confessional singer/songwriter idiom with more than just her serpentine bandonym, creating music more appropriate for gallery spaces than indie clubs. <em>Hands Across the Void</em> is, in the non-imbibing sense of the term, as sobering as folk music gets: patient, resonant, and perhaps most importantly, curious.</p><p>
    Early copy has also frequently mentioned two predecessors for Fortino's approach: early Cat Power and Joanna Newsom. Chan Marshall is the obvious mark in terms of <em>Void</em>'s spaciousness and solitude, and both women do well to push listeners out of their comfort zones, but Fortino's sense of yearning is less romantic and more spiritual. Newsom's <em>Ys</em> comes to mind through ""Shipwreck""'s madrigal melody, but the resemblance is superficial, evidenced most clearly in the song's refrain: ""We want to struggle and survive/ We want to live 'cause we know that life is beautiful/ Though surreal at times."" The distinction lies not in the simplicity of the lyrics, but their qualification-- instead of celebration-- of the world's occasional inexplicability.</p><p>
<em>Void</em>'s music is as gently inquisitive as the artwork that accompanies it. Across a series of six photographs in the packaging, Fortino explores various dimly illuminated locales, accompanied only by a lantern. The record's title most likely refers to the sort of reinforcement that helps with the imperceptible problems of life. Important in that description, however, is Fortino's personal journey. Her accompaniment throughout is deliberate and twilit: a self-taught guitar style foregrounding the metallic thrum of its strings; an ashen voice harmonizing with a younger version of itself, often simply with vocabled ""oh""s; inexplicable trills of sound filtering in from nowhere.

    On ""Campfire Resemblance"", Fortino draws an analogy between a campfire's function-- warmth first, then vision-- and that of a lantern, which illuminates only its most immediate surroundings, allowing the cold comfort of careful, measured exploration. The Gaelic-tinged ""On This Side"" follows, and she searches for the fortitude necessary to dig her way ""through the dust"": ""Ride on my sailors/ Deep in my mind/ I've always believed in you/ Now throw me a line.""
    </p>
<p>
    Untethered, fire's destructive potential can be devastating, and also transfixing to take in. ""Forest on Fire"", the first of <em>Void</em>'s two epics, traces the continuum of terror and captivation. The last four of the song's six minutes are wordless, occupied only by a simple, climbing and repeating guitar figure and a looming sense of disquiet. The acoustic guitar comes to resemble a resolutely flickering flame slowly morphing into, and eventually overtaken by, swirling, discordant noise. The song devours itself, and there's no good reason to turn away.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Void</em>'s liner notes thank ""the people of Tibet and their struggle against the Chinese occupation,"" and Fortino reclaims a Dharmic cultural icon on the nearly 11-minute album summit ""Swastika"". The symbol's earliest and most widespread incarnation was as a sign of good luck, and a sense of hope pervades the song, which is divided into two equal parts. The first half is a series of Zen-like koans: ""If dark were overthrown by the light/ Would the light turn to day/ Would it all turn to gray?"" During the second section, the guitar takes on a chiming timbre, accompanied by an otherworldly drone of indistinct purpose: is it a sign of transcendence, or an admonition to pay closer attention? ""You got a lot to carry,"" Fortino informs, ""but once you're there, you stay."" She refuses to offer any information as to whether that outcome is actually a good thing, but casts a blessing regardless.
    </p>
<p>
    Jesy Fortino's music is and will continue to be classified using adjectives like ""spare"" and ""haunting,"" but those terms fail in terms of its emotional content. The 24-year old is publicly coming to terms with her interpretive skills as well as her own demons, and is doing it through an intensely vulnerable medium to boot. In that regard, <em>Hands Across the Void</em>, in its myriad attempts at radiance, is actually quite inspirational.<br/>

    There's a twinkle of lore in <em>A Hawk and a Hacksaw and the Hun Hangár Ensemble</em>, the limited edition, eight-track EP that follows A Hawk and a Hacksaw's best album to date, last year's <em>The Way the Wind Blows</em>. As the band puts it, they ""walked into a music store in Budapest, Hungary and walked out with a score of four collaborators versed not only in Hungarian folk, but also...jazz and minimalism."" Béla Ágoston, Zsolt Kürtösi, Ferenc Kovács, and Balázs Unger became the ad hoc Hun Hangár Ensemble, sharing their ancestral repertoire with Hacksaw's Jeremy Barnes and Heather Trost and allowing the two younger musicians to add their own arrangements and ideas. Such obvious cultural immersion may sound disingenuous or self-serving, but it works here and on the accompanying tour diary DVD, finally allowing A Hawk and a Hacksaw the chance to bloom amid a parcel of the folk heritage from which they've long drawn.</p><p>
    A Hawk and a Hacksaw's growth has always been collaboration-dependent, so this EP, which takes the group's interest in Eastern European folk to more traditionally rooted depth, comes as little surprise. It actually feels natural in a reverse sort of way: The band's eponymous debut was all Barnes, the former Neutral Milk Hotel and Bright Eyes drummer. It was a hodgepodge of American and Eastern European folk-- parlor pianos, singing accordions, generous rhythms and rooster calls-- plied beneath experimentation with tape manipulation, vocal effects, and found sounds like telephone bells. Barnes had gone peripatetic by the second album, <em>Darkness at Noon</em>, dividing his time between his native New Mexico, England and Prague, picking up motifs and players along the way. Violinist and pianist Heather Trost was the one that stuck, joining Barnes for <em>Darkness</em> and <em>The Way The Wind Blows</em>. Those sessions somewhat foreshadowed the work with the Hun Hangár Ensemble, as Barnes traveled to the Romanian countryside to work with folk group Fanfare Ciocarlia. They accompanied Zach Condon on Beirut's <em>Gulag Orkestar</em>, too, and, though they went largely unrecognized for it, it was an indication that A Hawk and a Hacksaw was chipping back towards its source.</p><p>
    This latest collaboration excels in large part because it never tries to shoehorn a mood or sound into the pieces: It flows well, rocking back and forth between vibrant, danceable movements and somber, turgid instrumental numbers. The set's two horas-- a diverse class of Eastern European dances often associated with weddings-- reflect those poles. ""Romanian Hora and Bulgar"", recorded live last year, is spry, bells splashing out over the accordion's loping rhythm. Its second half is all frenzy, though, a heavy, exuberant, violin-led jump dashing to the audience's delight. But ""Oriental Hora"" shoots the same cadence through with a thick air of sobriety, a violin and viola doubling the melody until the rest of the band-- tuba, accordion, bouzouki, ukulele and Barnes' glockenspiel and steady foot percussion-- joins. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Oriental Hora"" is one of the EP's rare moments featuring more than a handful of instruments. Despite a core of six musicians and contributors including Zach Condon, the EP rarely attempts to impress with bulk sound or flashy parts. The best work here emphasizes quality not quantity, like the opening Trost composition, ""Kiraly Siratás"", a duet for bowed strings and the dulcimer-like cymbalom. The traditional Hungarian melodies of ""Dudanotak"" are played on the bagpipe by Ágoston, but Barnes lends a cantering boom-bap beat that's exuberant and charming. This music is older than both musicians, but in these hands it's got renewed swagger. Coming out of these spectacular sessions, it's more than reasonable to expect the same sort of reinvigorated vibrancy from A Hawk and a Hacksaw in the future.

In the 1980s, he released several elegant pop records for the short-lived él label alongside the likes of Momus, the Would Be Goods, and indie pop godheads Felt. After él folded in 1988, Philippe went on to record a series of solo albums drawing on such influences as, in his words, ""vintage pop, French chanson, Ravel, bossa nova, Duke Ellington, the Shirelles, or the Beach Boys.""<em> </em>He has worked with UK pop institution Saint Etienne, been hailed as an inspiration by Japanese pop savant Cornelius, and, earlier this year, collaborated with Young Marble Giants frontman Stuart Moxham. As a string arranger, Philippe oversaw London indie-pop group the Clientele's shift from
    their early sepia tones to the lush clarity of recent albums, including 2007's <em>God Save the Clientele.</em></p><p>
    On his first solo outing in three years, <em>An Unknown Spring</em>, Philippe again takes listeners to what él founder Mike Alway described as ""a pop fantasy world"", though it's also a world of classical sophistication. At a time when Scott Walker, Joanna Newsom, Sufjan Stevens, and Final Fantasy receive widespread critical acclaim, majestic orchestral confections like Philippe's sweetly romantic ""The Hill and the Valley"" or harmony-buttressed pop symphony ""Born Beautiful"" ought to find a properly appreciative audience. Along with bassoon, clavinet, horns, and all manner of organs, Philippe employs usual accomplices the Convent Garden String Quartet. But <em>An Unknown Spring</em> doesn't find beauty only in grandiose arrangements. The bare keyboards on much of broken-hearted ""Miss Lake"" or wide-eyed finale ""Wild-Eyed and Disheveled"" help showcase the indie-pop veteran's sinuous melodies, which are rarely constrained by typical pop song forms. The Clientele's Alasdair MacLean and Mel Draisey add backing vocals to some tracks, joined by Norwegian singer/violinist Mari Person.</p><p>
<em>An Unknown Spring</em> has no drums. ""We had great fun with shakers, maracas, claves, rainsticks and odd bits and bobs that could be hit or thrown about,"" Philippe reports on his MySpace page. An admirably idiosyncratic aesthetic challenge so many decades into the rock era, this decision nevertheless underscores what many fans of groups like the Clientele may find to be a key stumbling block to enjoying <em>An Unknown Spring</em>: for all their technical sophistication, the songs can seem a bit too proper, too ephemeral. Philippe's fey, theatrical vocals and vaguely pastoral lyrics-- ""Gray swept over England/ Shadows ran across the ground,"" starts downcast opener ""No Sun, No Sky At All""-- sometimes begin to blur into one another, like fuzzy memories of a pop fantasy world rather than the experience of one. ""Toi, Le Coeur de la Rose"" is a choral adaptation of Ravel, and to these ignorant, pop-weaned ears its lilting a cappella might benefit from a classical context.
    </p><p>
    For the uninitiated, Philippe maintains a generous online presence. Curious listeners should download the free mp3s from <strong><a href=""http://www.louisphilippe.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his site</a></strong> to catch up on the artist's previous work, particularly lavish 1998 album <em>Azure</em>. Philippe's early output for él seems also to have been especially unjustly overlooked. The closest <em>An Unknown Spring</em> comes to his 80s output-- work that should please fans of the Divine Comedy, the Postmarks, or little-known New Orleans duo Hercules-- is the bossa nova-tinged ""Fallen Snow"". Like the High Llamas' Sean O'Hagan, a superb string arranger in his own right, Philippe is a baroque-pop maestro with a firm grounding in the finest productions of the sun-kissed 60s. Self-indulgent because it has every right to be, <em>An Unknown Spring</em> isn't perfect. But it's a fine opportunity for pop lovers to start rediscovering the vast oeuvre of a cosmopolitan original.

    Eight albums in, Super Furry Animals have been around long enough for reviews to start out by saying how long they've been around. When the Welsh psych-pop band first played the main stage at the UK's Reading Festival in 1996, the headliners were Black Grape, the Prodigy, and the Stone Roses in their catastrophic last performance, sans guitarist John Squire. Of those groups, only the Prodigy have put out new music in this millennium-- and even that was too much.</p><p>
    Wrongly pigeonholed at first as a Welsh Britpop band, the Super Furries have lived forever by comparison. They're still releasing albums at a steady clip while their erstwhile contemporaries have either fallen silent (Radiohead), gone on hiatus (Blur), turned to dogshit (Oasis), or gone on hiatus, turned to dogshit, and then reunited (the Verve). Including side projects, B-sides, and other extras, the SFA catalogue is sprawling but rewarding, topped only by Damon Albarn among UK artists from that earlier period (Jarvis Cocker isn't prolific enough). Not even devotees can hope to memorize every nuance. Some of the best bits are sung in Welsh!</p><p>
    Aside from the excellent singles compilation <em>Songbook</em>, which shows some of the band's breadth (if only some of their depth), the best place to start with the Super Furries has traditionally been their latest album. <em>Hey Venus!</em>, the band's worthwhile Rough Trade debut, doesn't quite measure up to that standard-- it has to contend with frontman Gruff Rhys' Pitchfork-recommended <em>Candylion</em>, which hit the U.S. in March.  That record indulged Rhys' eccentricities within a basic, acoustic guitar-oriented setting; <em>Hey Venus!</em> broadens that instrumental palette for a set of a shiny (not necessarily happy) rock, pop, and country-rock songs that consolidate the band's pre-<em>Love Kraft</em> explorations. Broken Social Scene's David Newfeld is behind the album's clear-sounding production (as he was on the excellent EP by countryfolk Los Campesinos!), and the High Llamas' Sean O'Hagan again proves an immaculate string arranger.
    </p>
<p>
    First impressions of <em>Hey Venus!</em> may label it a retreat, but that isn't quite right. It's just that a group I've complimented for their sublime gimmickry focus more on songcraft here than stagecraft; as Rhys recently told Pitchfork, reports suggesting a ""concept album"" were greatly exaggerated. Spector-walled ""Run-Away"" does away with the previous album's ""no more romantic comedies"" brainstorm, to deviously swooning effect. The Zombies-esque orchestral pop of first single ""Show Your Hand"" and the falsetto-laden quiet storm of ""The Gift That Keeps Giving"" have more historical precedent than some SFA escapades, but they enchant even in such a broader context. Keyboardist Cian Ciarán might not bring as much of the techno influence he contributed to previous albums, except the electronic bleeps on explosively catchy ""Into the Night"" (which gives the album its title and features a Turkish electric saz) or punky ""Neo Consumer"". However, Ciaran's recent doowop obsession shows through on his majestic composition ""Carbon Dating""-- almost on par with the still-bowling-me-over ""Bowl Me Over"", from Ciaran's Acid Casuals project.
    </p>
<p>
    The Furries can't only write beaming melodies, deck them out with sparkling instrumentation and harmonies, and not also have a little fun. Too many people seem to have wrongly assumed that because <em>Love Kraft</em> had gloomy cover art and slower songs it was dead serious. It wasn't, and neither is <em>Hey Venus!</em>. ""Suckers!"" lives up to its punctuation (a Welsh trend?) with anthemic acoustic guitar strums and fuzzed-out lead guitar fills like on <em>Radiator</em>'s ""Demons"", plus hammer dulcimer and lyrics that give the almost-guiltily decadent arrangement the band's old Situationist bite: ""Suckers playing stadiums, filling them to the rafters, singing power-ballad songs,"" goes this stadium-ready power ballad, but there's a sucker born every line. Guitarist Huw ""Bunf"" Bunford's ""Battersea Odyssey"" takes a whimsical, horn-fronted trip to inner city London. His ambulance-siren vocals on ""Baby Ate My Eight Ball"" help make up a track weird enough for any SFA album since 1996 debut <em>Fuzzy Logic</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    It's fair to say the songs lack the epic sweep of the last couple of albums, but there's still little about <em>Hey Venus!</em> to fault beyond the faint whiff of musical conservatism (""Hey, this almost reminds me of a niche-marketable Super Furry Animals!""). While the pun underlying quick-hit opener ""Gateway Song"" is dated, it remains relevant and lively: ""It brings us up nicely to the harder stuff,"" Rhys brags. Finale ""Let the Wolves Howl at the Moon"" can't really add much to the Byrdsian twang SFA perfected on <em>Rings Around the World</em>'s ""Run! Christian, Run!"", but its more compact, yearning lyrics also recall Belle and Sebastian's dazzling <em>The Life Pursuit</em> closer ""Mornington Crescent"". 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Hey Venus!</em> concludes on a disturbing note for an album by such a long-running band: ""The end, it comes so soon,"" Rhys sings. On ""Suckers!"", though, he seems to clarify, ""It's over, but we've just begun."" Here's hoping for the latter. If the Super Furries can't keep coming along to baffle us a few times every couple of years, then the terrorists will have won. The headliners at this year's Reading and Leeds Festivals were Smashing Pumpkins, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Razorlight, so clearly, the Man don't give a fuck.

    It wouldn't be quite right to say the music on <em>Mantaray</em> is overshadowed by the story that comes with it; the truth, with an album like this, is that the two things are hardly separable. When well-known artists step out under new names and solo projects-- even artists a lot less iconic than Siouxsie Sioux-- we have a curious relationship with the results. We can pore over every second, but it's not just to hear where the melodies go or how the guitars are mixed: It's to read how those melodies and mixes stake out ground, how they place themselves within the pop landscape. We know what these artists are like, and what's expected of them, and so we're not just casually listening to them make music-- we're listening into a whole bunch decisions about how and why people choose to present themselves, and those decisions fall as often into the categories of ""marketing"" and ""branding"" and ""backstory"" as they do into the realm of aesthetics.</p><p>
    Siouxsie Sioux has been a star for some 30 years, straight from the first flare-up of punk to the present; this record is anything but a comeback. But the project she's best known for-- Siouxsie and the Banshees, who led the way from punk into goth-- is long finished. The Creatures, the group she started with her Banshee husband Budgie, is also finished-- as is (not coincidentally) their marriage, a fact Siouxsie has contextualized in interviews by talking about her discomfort with labels like ""lesbian"" or ""bisexual."" That leaves just Siouxsie this time, and that turns out to suggest a big shift. Siouxsie is the legend; Siouxsie is the beloved icon. She's a one-name star now, and she comes out of the gate on this record singing things that wouldn't be out of place on a teen-pop singer's ""This Is Me"" ballad: ""I'm on the verge of an awakening...Feeling so strong...Can't be ignored.""</p><p>
    And she really <em>is</em> pop, for the first movement of this record. For the first time in about a decade, Siouxsie's veering not toward her artiness or her sophistication, but her flat-out star power-- and in the service of a grand, glammy buzzing that manages to suggest cut-rate, guitarred-out Goldfrapp a lot less than you'd think. Any Siouxsie fan will tell you she has something special, and it's not just her punk pedigree: For a few tracks here, she's strident, commanding, witchy, and paler-than-thou in ways you'd laugh off coming from any fresh youngster, and she's still captivating enough that I'd be thoroughly unshocked if she picked up a healthy cult of new teenagers in her fan base. Three tracks in, she's doing a kind of Shirley Bassey strut on ""Here Comes That Day"", and yes, Siouxsie's coming-out party is going pretty well. 
    </p>
<p>
    But the part to commend, branding-wise, is the rest of it. There comes a point, early on, where that pop rush wears off: The point of dense, glammy tracks like these is to dominate and bully you, a kind of thrill that can only last so long. Excellent timing, then, for this record to settle comfortably back toward the more opaque and mysterious Siouxsie fans know: It's as if she's invited the public in through the front door amid blasts of pop confetti, but isn't afraid to trick them straight down to the basement. The machine-tooled precision of pop gives way to some of the chaotic punk rumble fans know from the Banshees and the Creatures, like the pounding toms and scrappy guitar accents on ""One Mile Below"". And that gives way to the kind of atmospheric spook that builds off Siouxsie's voice, with its imperious depths and its ominous quavers: Sequenced together, ""Drone Zone"" and ""Sea of Tranquility"" give you the kind of turbulent cabaret air that's been Siouxsie's signature contribution to each of her projects.
    </p>
<p>
    It's a success, without doubt. It absolutely doesn't embarrass itself-- if anything, it'll prod some of its buyers to be better, more engaged listeners, whether it's the pop <em>or</em> the art that takes some trying. Neither does it fall into that common trap, the one where new solo singers seem to be trying much too hard to make a case for their own relevance, or at least their potential popularity. But even in its clever, professional navigation of the territory of a Siouxsie solo record-- the solid bid at star-power pop, and the spooked hard edges for the truly devoted-- it has to let something fall by the wayside. Gone is the sense that Siouxsie Sioux is still working on music that might pushb hard in some new direction, music that's free to chase after any odd, scenic dream that occurs to her; for this album, at least, Siouxsie is on the clock, and has professional obligations to fulfill. She does it wonderfully, but if you weren't curious to begin with...

    Swizz Beatz is one of the most dependable big-name producers in rap. His clanging, anthemic keyboard-beats were one of the main forces behind the late-90s rise of the Ruff Ryders crew, and more recently he's kept buys churning out dense, furious club-bangers for the likes of Beyonce and T.I. But he's not a rapper. ""It's Me, Bitches"", the Swizz solo single that hit radio early in the year, is a total mess. On that track, he huffs and puffs, grunting a lot and saying absolutely nothing, repeating the same verses twice, attempting to make a hook out of ""chillin' in my Beamer, listening to 'Ether'"" despite the fact that ""Beamer"" doesn't even come close to rhyming with ""Ether."" And yet ""It's Me, Bitches"" is one of the best rap singles of the year. The song is a delirious burst of energy, oscillating synth-blips and churning martial strings hammering away while sirens scream and drums shatter. The track keeps interrupting itself, flying apart and then back together before ending in a great incendiary scratch-solo. Any actual rapper would have a hell of a time navigating this minefield, but Swizz just plays hypeman for himself, screaming catchphrases and adding to the clutter rather than trying to stay above it. ""It's Me, Bitches"" is a forceful and mindless dumb-out classic, and it feels like a glorious fluke, the sort of success that could not possibly repeat itself. As great as ""It's Me, Bitches"" might be, it doesn't exactly give the impression that Swizz Beatz would be capable of making a good album.</p><p>
    Somehow, though, <em>One Man Band</em> <em>Man</em> is a good album, though by no means a great one. The album works because Swizz for the most part internalizes the lessons of ""It's Me, Bitches"", camouflaging his weaknesses and sometimes even turning them into strengths. The album's best songs are meaningless shots of adrenaline built on the dizzy energy of that first single. Follow-up ""Money in the Bank"" is even busier and nearly as inspired; its tire-screeches, stadium-drums, finger-snaps, stadium-chants, bass-rumbles, and squeaky sped-up vocals somehow cohere into something simple and infectious. ""Top Down"", meanwhile, swirls riotous bursts of 70s-soul horns and strings around one another.</p><p>
    Best of all is ""Take a Picture"", which slightly slows the tempo without losing the album's sense of exhilaration. Built on top of a luminous sample of the joyous burlbing bass from Bill Withers' ""Take a Picture"", the song works as a loopy, euphoric grin, even if Swizz doesn't do much more than brag about his funny. In fact, Swizz's clumsy-ass rapping has a sort of goofily naive charm to it. He delivers all his lyrics in a breathless bark and repeats himself constantly: one song after ""chillin' in my Beamer, listening to 'Ether,'"" he's ""cruisin' in that Lambo, lookin' like Rambo."" He sounds utterly elated to be rapping, blissfully unaware that  virtually every line is a certifiable clunker.
    </p>
<p>
    The album is short: Ten songs, one obligatory all-star remix, and one pointless voicemail message from Snoop Dogg. It's over in roughly half and hour, which barely gives the energy any time to lag. Confusingly, the only rapping guest to appear on any track other than the all-star remix is Ruff Ryders refugee Drag-On, who turns up on ""Bust Ya Gunz"" and who's only barely a better rapper than Swizz. Even more confusingly, Swizz himself only produces about half the tracks, though the guest beatmakers mostly do a good job at recreating his antic aesthetic. Against all odds, <em>One Man Band Man</em> never wears out its welcome.</p><p>
    The album only falls to pieces when Swizz tries to get serious, which he does on tracks bad enough to cast a huge shadow over the whole thing. On ""The Funeral"", Swizz tries to sound haunted and paranoid, but he ends up with a handful of ridiculously dumb pseudo-goth images like ""it's been nothing but black clouds and black cats/ And every night I see an old man with black slacks."" Lyrically, the sleepy, downtrodden poverty-reminisce ""Part of the Plan"" may be even worse: ""I wish I could fly away on a unicorn/ I'm from the ghetto, and every day a human's born."" Confusingly, the track is billed as featuring Chris Martin, but that guest-appearance turns out to just be a sample from ""X&amp;Y"", which isn't even a good Coldplay song. If ""Part of the Plan"" manages to end the recent trend of rappers looking to Chris Martin for choruses, it'll justify its existence. Meanwhile, Swizz is a whole lot better off yelling over sirens and talking about his money.

    On <em>Down Below It's Chaos</em>, Kinski move further from the psychedelic marathons and space-rock they honed over seven years, taking an even bigger step than 2005's <em>Alpine Static</em> into more immediately familiar proto-metal and rock. That previous record balanced drone with endurance tests by way of metal riffs, but <em>Chaos</em> is far more melodic, rigid, and accessible. It could be the record that those put off by Kinski had always hoped they'd make, but I'm curious what the fan reaction will be.</p><p>
    Opening track ""Crybaby Blowout"" begins with a highwire guitar line that sounds anemic and meandering at first, but when the song makes an unexpected switch to straight power chords, it sounds like drummer Barrett Wilke has found the style he was born to play. It's a new niche for Kinski, but one they inhabit rather convincingly. They've even got vocals this time, though it's not exactly a breakthrough on par with, for instance, Mogwai's ""Cody"": on ""Passwords &amp; Alcohol"", Chris Martin's singing over the glistening chords and heavy-yet-graceful rhythm (they haven't kicked the Sonic Youth habit just yet) is unobtrusive at best, but perhaps he just knows when to stay out of the way.</p><p>
    Though the songs here remain mostly instrumental and there are still some moody detours (the foreboding extended intro to ""Boy, Was I Mad!"" almost sounds like an interpretation of ""Greensleeves""), Kinski sound like an entirely different band. ""Dayroom at Narita Int'l"" is a rather conventional fuzzed-out groove, slow and strutting, with Martin's biggest vocal spotlight about avoiding chaos in an airplane over Japan (yes, it's down below), while ""Punching Goodbye Out Front"" is vintage blues-scale hammering over a proto-punk rhythm with judicious delay on the vocals, and even comes in at under three minutes. Kinski do manage to stretch out a bit elsewhere without losing the sounding they're chasing: After over two minutes of beating around the bush with crisp guitar arpeggios and flutes, ""Boy, Was I Mad!"" becomes a screeching monotone stomp with an ominous bass drum that begs listeners to throw up their horns before leaping nimbly into one of their most melodic instrumentals. But the real stunning change-ups come in ""Plan, Steal, Drive"", from the calm drone to the Who-nodding layered guitar echo, and then, finally, the album's biggest (and most earned) full-band crescendo.
    </p>
<p>
    Only for a band like Kinski could a move to blustering hard rock sound conservative, but given their past penchant for drone and the riff-a-thons of <em>Alpine Static</em>, <em>Chaos</em> sounds relatively tame. Look past the crunch of the guitars, though, and there are gorgeous new textures, like the droning horns at the end of the largely forgettable ""Argentina Turner"" and the unexpected Hammond organ in ""Child Had to Catch a Train""-- moments that leave me wishing the band had stuck its neck out further. Some fans may very well appreciate the new direction-- hearing ""Plan, Steal, Drive"", I'm almost among them-- but I think Kinski are capable of even more.

    No, that title ain't some suave, sexy expression uttered by a devil-may-care tomcat fucking his way to garage-rock revival nirvana. It's the sort of ""mercy"" high school geeks and other torture victims beg for, the kind I'd love to grant to these star-crossed should've-beens who helped set the table for that turn-of-millenium retro explosion and then tasted little of its subsequent success. Their Columbia deal now seems like ancient history, and after grappling with label troubles coupled with the loss of guitarist Graham Tyler's father, a loyal Suzuki supporter and friend, the band's once mighty catcall has been reduced to a wistful sigh.</p><p>
    Beset by tragedy, Tyler nearly quit the band while <em>Have Mercy</em> was recorded, leaving frontman Sammy James Jr. to pick up the songwriting slack. Unfortunately, the increased workload pushes the envelope of James's animal magnetism, forcing him to operate outside the Jagger/Richards dynamic so finely established on the Suzuki's best work. As 2004's pristine <em>Alive &amp; Amplified</em> made clear, the band's sound no longer reflects their feral libido, and <em>Mercy</em>, rife with toothless acoustic ditties and wistful quasi-ballads, removes the last bits of swagger from their cocksure step.</p><p>
    Despite fulsome opener ""99%""'s best effort to hide it, <em>Mercy</em> suffers from a serious riffage deficiency, causing James to trade in his hardscrabble mod persona for that of a clean-cut 70s power-pop idol. The back-to-back centerpiece of ""Rock'n'Roller Girl"" and ""First Come Love"" flaunt cutesy guitar lines and lovestruck melodies, though most of the record putzes through playful mid-tempo tunes hellbent on asserting that the band's on the up-and-up. ""Ashes"" and ""The Prime of Life"" blatantly acknowledge the Suzuki's decline (""Ashes, ashes, we all fall down""), while closer ""Down But Not Out"" unconvincingly promises an eventual resurgence for the band.
    </p>
<p>
    Sadly, the Suzuki sound so sober and humbled here they have to spell out their debauched behavior on obligatory goofball track ""Good Ol' Alcohol"". A nightmare version of the Kurt Weill-via-Doors cabaret ""Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)"", James proudly rattles off every drug he's done before proclaiming the surefire efficacy of booze. And you know what, that's great, but doesn't he realize livelier, raunchier anthems like ""In a Young Man's Mind"" and ""A Simple Life"" conveyed the message much more effectively? Chalk it up to tragedy or music biz hardship or whatever you want, but <em>Have Mercy</em> finds the Suzuki once again fighting to save their own relevancy and sounding sorely passé in doing so. Once ahead of the young, exciting revival curve, these guys now sound like middle-aged classic rock dinosaurs who failed to evolve.

    Never underestimate the power of the perfect guitar effects unit. The Jesus and Mary Chain's landmark <em>Psychocandy</em> would have sounded vastly less godlike without its use of a discontinued (and allegedly broken) Japanese fuzz pedal. Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis dredged his mythic decibel levels from road-worn Marshall amps, but his stoner racket wouldn't have been the same if he hadn't funneled it through the grinding fury of a Big Muff. In the right hands, one little black box can mean the difference between pummeling and decimating.</p><p>
    Few people understand this better than Oliver Ackermann, frontman for thunderous Brooklyn three-piece A Place to Bury Strangers: Under his catch-all company name Death by Audio (it's also a music venue, recording studio, and collective), he custom-builds and designs his own hand-wired pedals, which are used by everyone from Lightning Bolt and Serena Maneesh to Wilco, Spoon, and TV on the Radio. Not coincidentally, anyone looking for a quick description of his own band can look to the names he gives these things: Interstellar Overdriver, Supersonic Fuzz Gun, Total Sonic Annihilation.</p><p>
    With a bandname that's linked to both the Gospel of Matthew and the writings of British occultist Aleister Crowley, A Place to Bury Strangers represents something of a second coming for Ackermann. He was previously a member of defunct Fredericksburg, Va., dream-pop revivalists Skywave, whose records were all but baptized in the drones of (don't jump out of your checkered Vans!) the JAMC and My Bloody Valentine. After their breakup, Skywave's remaining members formed the like-minded two-piece Ceremony, and Ackermann moved to New York where he hooked up with drummer Jay Space and bassist Jono Mofo, turned up the volume, and began masterminding the wrecking-crew colossus that would become this album.  
    </p>
<p>
    Compiling mastered versions of the band's early CD-Rs and mp3s, A Place to Bury Strangers' self-titled debut LP sets tinnitus-inducing noise-pop against a tension-wracked Joy Division-meets-Ministry backdrop. Plenty of
    bands have tapped the trebly, ecstatic side of shoegaze in
    recent years, but none have imbued it with this band's
    frustrated aggression or lacerating feedback. 
    </p>
<p>
    What hits first is the reverberating distortion: The brutal textures announce themselves in pangs of blown-out guitar, crunching against the propulsive bassline and distant, static-soaked drums of opening track ""Missing You"". Thirty seconds in, the tempest recedes, revealing the song's love-wasted verses and murky, chiming guitars (think the Chills' ""Pink Frost"" and you're close), only to sneak up again for a shattered, metal-twisting chorus. The
    group's versatile squall can crumble majestically, as on the
    slow-motion starfighter explosions of ""The Falling Sun"", or growl like
    a wounded mountain lion, as during the pitch-shifting tumult of ""My
    Weakness"". And on ""To Fix the Gash in Your Head"", it even evokes the late-80s peak of Wax Trax! industrial bands, fleshed out by treble-heavy synth, buzzsaw guitars, and primitive, pre-programmed drum loops.
    </p>
<p>
    For a dude creating such awesome bedlam, Ackermann's uneven monotone comes off Ian Curtis-bummed. The hammering, Factory Records-esque beats and blistering effects-pedal descent of ""She Dies"" take place on a ""white-letter day"" (""There's nothing for me now,"" Ackermann wearily intones). Finale ""Ocean"" barely glimpses its bassline's steady shore through waves of resigned heartbreak. But the epic atmospheres are rarely as dense as I might be letting on. What matters most is the substance behind the style, and here, even morose falling-out songs like ""Another Step Away"" are saturated with slender indie-pop melody, notwithstanding the occasional weak lyric about how there's ""no photograph that can capture who you are"" (totally rhymes with ""shooting star"").
    </p>
<p>
    A Place to Bury Strangers can pull beauty out of eardrum-puncturing bleakness, but the most tuneful offering here, ""Don't Think Lover"", is gentle and romantic-- when not exploding at the seams. ""Don't think lover/ Love lasts forever,"" Ackermann sings, and it's never quite clear whether the sentiment is optimistic or misanthropic. The stalking ""I Know I'll See You"" seems to play off the know-my-love-too-well urgency of the Smiths' ""Hand in Glove"", with Ackermann even warning, ""Don't take my hand/ 'Cause I'll take it away."" Like the Italians Do It Better label's similarly moody <em>After Dark</em> compilation, <em>A Place to Bury Strangers</em>
    may not be easy for would-be record buyers to find-- it's currently
    limited to 500 copies and put out by, um, Killer Pimp Records-- but it's worth every effort.

    As the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles was still reeling from the effects of the riots that tore it apart in 1966, a different epicenter of black culture was taking similar pains to recover and rebuild. Stax Records was hit with a series of events in the span of a year that would have sunk almost any other independent label: Warner Bros. bought Stax distributor Atlantic Records, swiping the Stax master tapes and distribution rights from label co-founder Jim Stewart. A December 1967 plane crash claimed the lives of marquee star Otis Redding and all but two members of session band the Bar-Kays. And five months afterwards, Martin Luther King-- a man who embodied the racially-integrated social philosophy that Stax couldn't exist without-- was assassinated in the same Memphis motel where Steve Cropper and Eddie Floyd co-wrote the #1 r&amp;b hit ""Knock on Wood"". But as Stax's fortunes changed in the early 70s-- bolstered by the success of artists like Isaac Hayes, the Staple Singers and Johnnie Taylor-- a combination of financial uninhibitedness and social goodwill drove the label to organize a concert that would both showcase the label's expanding roster and serve as an inspiration to a community that the outside world considered second-class.</p><p>
    Seven years after their first revue tour outside Memphis saw a number of their artists stranded in Los Angeles during the Watts riots, Stax returned to L.A. and put on one hell of a show. Some called it ""the Black Woodstock"", which isn't completely accurate; the cost was a dollar more than free, everyone on the bill was great (Albert King or Sha Na Na? Not a hard choice), and the attendees tended to dress a lot better. As a concert, film, and live recording, <em>Wattstax </em>is possibly the definitive r&amp;b festival; only James Brown's shows have packed more energy and showmanship into a live set, and every artist-- from the Oscar-winning Hayes to the no-hit wonders that gigged in clubs around town in the week before the main event at the Los Angeles Coliseum-- is either at the peak of their artistic powers or damn well plays like it. Stax's 3xCD box set commemorating the event, re-released in the general vicinity of its 35th anniversary (though this particular collection first appeared in 2003), isn't the most important document of  the show-- that'd be the concert film, directed by Mel Stuart (less than two years removed from <em>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</em>)--  but it's easy to get an idea of every extra moment that made the whole experience legendary: Kim Weston's rendition of black national anthem ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"", Richard Pryor's comic yet cutting interstitials, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson's legendary introduction, which incorporated his poem ""I Am - Somebody"" into a 100,000-strong call-and-response.</p><p>
    The concert proper is well-represented here, and it goes a long way toward showing how Stax was able to stay solvent in the early 70s even without longtime standbys like Sam &amp; Dave or Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s. Not that there isn't any of the old guard represented here: Eddie Floyd busts his ass during a forceful rendition of ""Knock on Wood"", where he spends just about every moment he's not singing urging the crowd to get up and clap their hands. Carla Thomas reaches even further back, peppering her extensive set with a roll call of r&amp;b's phases in the 60s, from 1960's post-doo-wop classic ""Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)"" (which gets an absolutely rapturous response from the first syllable) to 1966's slice of prime Hayes/Porter r&amp;b ""B-A-B-Y"" to the churning, Southern-fried soul-funk of 1969's ""I Like What You're Doing (To Me)"". And Carla's father Rufus, one of Stax's first hitmakers and a graying 55 at the time, commands the stage with a rapid-fire succession of his iconic dance-craze songs-- likeably dippy novelties on record, but live they were the catalyst for a glorious stage-rushing Funky Chicken contest.
    </p>
<p>
    The post-Atlantic hitmakers are just as powerful. The Bar-Kays hit the ground running with a medley of ""Son of Shaft"" and ""Feel It"": the former is a funk explosion that makes the original Isaac Hayes composition sound like an exercise in restraint, while the latter is a sick, organ-heavy extended vamp with a memorably lascivious monologue (""I'm told that havin' fun is like havin' <em>sex</em>: That is, the more you put in to it, the more you're gonna get out of it""). David Porter, who started coming into his own as a performer at the end of the 60s after years of songwriting, is featured in a 20-plus-minute orchestral soul suite that devotes ten and a half minutes to the heartbreak ballad ""Can't See You When I Want To"", the most epic and gut-wrenching performance included in the set. And Johnnie Taylor-- who had 12 r&amp;b top 10 singles for Stax from 1968 to 1974-- turns his slinky, sly love song ""Steal Away"" into smooth, upbeat proto-disco that sees Philadelphia International cresting over the horizon and fires right back.
    </p>
<p>
    Where the new box set differs greatly from previous records devoted to the concert is in its breadth, especially with unreleased performances. Over a third of the material here is previously unavailable, and much of it is devoted to the also-ran artists that never cracked the r&amp;b top ten but didn't fail for lack of trying: belter Lee Sain's gut-bucket contribution to the Great Hot Pants Frenzy of 1971, ""Them Hot Pants""; the Temprees' velvety falsetto showcase ""Explain it to Her Mama""; Louise McCord's raw, Aretha-esque ""Better Get a Move On"". You could come to the conclusion that a few of these come at the expense of a few crucial omissions, some more forgivable than others; Isaac Hayes is represented solely by ""Theme from Shaft"" (though a more complete set is available on the must-have <em>Isaac Hayes at Wattstax</em>), while Luther Ingram's smoldering infidelity ode ""If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want to Be Right)"" is only available on the <em>Wattstax: Highlights from the Soundtrack</em> comp that this set makes mostly redundant. But that's searching for complaints. The box set still captures the concert's spirit intact, and the Reverend Jackson's introduction delivers as precise a summary as you'd hope for: ""We know that music is music, all of our people got a soul, our experience determines the texture, the taste, and the sound of our soul...all of us are one people, singin' our music, popping our fingers and doing our thing.""<br/>

    Ellen Allien, Berlin's high priestess of
    techno, assembled <em>Fabric 34</em> as though she were taping photographs into
    an album. ""I can remember every record being played by myself in a
    club,"" she tells us. When she hears them again, the moments come
    rushing back. But <em>Fabric 34</em> also exercises memory in a less Proustian,
    more concrete way: Following a party in her flat, Allien mixed the
    entire set on vinyl, by hand. It was an old-school gesture for a city
    girl vividly aware of the past. She was there when the Berlin Wall
    fell, when techno began to take hold in warehouses on the east side,
    when revolt on the dance floor, against the old regime of acid-house,
    was bound up with real liberation.

    This
    enriched idea of music brings an alluring balance of wistfulness and
    energy to all of Allien's work. From the get-go, <em>Fabric 34</em> peers
    longingly backward. After jumping off with a chirpy, murky number, she
    summons the golden days through Larry Heard's acid classic ""The Sun
    Can't Compare"", which rides Mr. White's diva crooning, over vintage
    808's and handclaps, far into house territory. (Anyone who can't handle
    the manic-depressive flitting might exit here.) Jamie Jones rounds back
    with his version of Estroe's ""Driven"", fattening the Dutch source
    material with string-laden shimmer and 303 patter, an islander's
    translation of tech-house.

<div style=""margin: 0px"">
    Another
    ""progressive"" remix follows suit. Pilas, a Madrid-based DJ, pumps a
    regular flow of electricity into Damián Schwartz's ""Tú y Yo"". Before
    the regularity tips into monotony, clouds of tension gather on ""Orderly
    Kaos"", as Don Williams turns in a specimen of Detroit techno rippling
    with delayed organs and flourishes of Chain Reaction-style dub. These
    moments of not-quite-history stand out as the mix's most savory. Toward
    the end of the mix, Richie Hawtin (under his Plastikman nom de house)
    recasts Heartthrob's techno hit ""Baby Kate"" as an austere landscape of
    space-age noise, preserving a husk of the original motif-- a riff from
    the past, rather than William's riff on the past.

    Next
    comes a loose suite of three, wrapped in a sort of supernatural gloom: From the syncopated zaps of ""It Is Not Now Either"" into the haunting,
    Eastern-tinged psychedelia of ""India in Me 2"" to the ghostly rattle of
    bells, like a swaying buoy, on ""Mutter"". This tinge of rootlessness
    returns at the end, when Allien's frequent collaborator Apparat
    materializes in the utopian shape of ""Arcadia"" (from his recent <em>Walls</em>
    LP), and we're carried upward on dreamily reverberating guitars and
    vocals.

    This
    late into the mix, listeners might gravitate toward two carps. First,
    that Thom Yorke's politically charged ""Harrowdown Hill"" is out of
    place. Yet the track slopes into a serene, stately come-down, an island
    of calm floating between the anxious dark of<span> </span>the Finnish
    ""Aaltovaihe"" and Allien's own ""Just a Woman"". And the Radiohead
    frontman's famously dissipated squawk plays a perfect go-between,
    relaying pent-up anger behind the brittle façade. Second, that ""It
    Is Not Now Either"" phases messily into ""India in Me 2"".

    While
    this transition may not be a slick continuity edit, like the rest of
    her transitions, it's no catastrophe. This was not, after all, done on
    a laptop: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but we have to
    appreciate the faith she's placed in us. Allien's brave to
    experiment-- and to save the imperfections. ""My music isn't always
    easy,"" Allien confessed to an interviewer in 2004, ""but it's always
    happy and light-- like the sun."" Dazzlingly streaked with melancholy and

But in truth it's the ailment that sidelined folk rock legend Linda Thompson for much of the past two decades. When she opened her mouth to sing, sometimes nothing came out. The condition first manifested itself as her marriage to Richard Thompson was dissolving, and many suspected its effects were accelerated by the stress of their creative and romantic break-up.</p><p>
    That could have been the end, but of course, it wasn't. Linda Thompson remained mostly mum, yes, but it was partly by choice, as the pleasures of domestic life took precedent over the pressures of professional life. It took prodding from son Teddy to push her back into the spotlight, and when she returned with 2002's <em>Fashionably Late</em>, it wasn't as some wounded, withered old crone but as a funny and modest entertainer, still possessed of a beautiful voice.</p><p>
<em>Fashionably Late</em>, which followed almost 20 years of relative silence, was something of a family affair, featuring contributions from children Teddy and Kamila, and also a cameo from Richard (as well as from such folk-rock hall of famers as Danny Thompson and Dave Mattacks). While the album marked Linda's grand reintroduction, it also marked Teddy's coming out as a great songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote every song on the disc, and helped direct mom back to what Richard gleefully used to call ""doom and gloom.""</p><p>
<em>Versatile Heart</em>, released a mere five years after <em>Fashionably Late</em>, features some Linda Thompson originals, a few more from Teddy, and (like <em>Fashionably Late</em>) one from Teddy's fellow folk-rock scion Rufus Wainwright, ""Beauty"", a string-laden swoon of a song that features Antony Hegarty as duet partner and manages to namedrop both Oscar Wilde and Michael Jackson. It's a refreshingly light moment from a singer known for the heavy, and <em>Versatile Heart</em> features a few more of them. The slow and dusty country ditty ""Do Your Best for Rock'n'Roll"", for example, requests absolution from God but settles for his support of good music.</p><p>
    In fact, contrary to common perception, Thompson's proven herself quite lighthearted and funny, both on stage and in recently interviews-- she's said her children have taken to calling her ""Shozzy,"" because she looks like a bit like Sharon Osbourne and flakes out like Ozzy. But it's weary heartache she sells like a pro. Thompson's work may not be as hip or fashionable as such peers as, say, Bridget St. John or Vashti Bunyan, but she's still a force to be reckoned with, with nigh-infallible delivery and an instinct for selling old country weepers like few others.</p><p>
    ""I wish that you were here/ Running around my heels/ Only you and I know how this lonely feels,"" she sings in ""The Way I Love You"". In ""Nice Cars"" (written by daughter Kamila) she's about as unromantic as one can be about such an over-romanticized material possession (even if her Mercedes turns out to be a stand-in for a poorly chosen lover-- ""Ladies shouldn't drive nice cars/ they're only going to break our hearts"" indeed). ""Blue &amp; Gold"" (which supposedly dates somewhere back to her days with Richard, aka, per the liners, ''a little known but extremely useful guitarist.'') and ""Katy Cruel"" draw from traditional English folk, while a tender reading of Tom Waits' ""Day After Tomorrow"" demonstrates Thompson's transformative abilities with contemporary material as well.</p><p>
    Maybe it's the slow pace of her releases, or maybe it's just her good taste, but this continuation of Thompson's unlikely comeback finds her if not necessarily as strong in voice as she was in the 1970s (we apparently have Botox shots to the throat to thank for anything at all) then certainly equal in spirit. It captures the same ultimately warm and comforting old school vibes as the confluence of good times conveyed in her nostalgic tribute to England's folk patriarch Bob Copper, ""Whisky, Bob Copper and Me"": ""Davy's playing, Shirley's singing, it's the weekend, England's winning."" And if you want to keep the good (bad) times going, Linda's latest is streaming from the stereo.</p></div>"|10578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10578-versatile-heart/|7.5|Joshua Klein

Drumm and Menche's main tools here-- fuzzed-out distortion, insect-like drone, and chopping pulse-- rank among noise's oldest clichés. On the one hand, it's admirable that these two would even try to find any remaining drops of pigment in those faded colors. And to their credit, Drumm and Menche get pretty far-- there's much more interesting stuff happening here than almost anyone else could muster with this material.</p><p>
    But taken on its own, <em>Gauntlet</em> never quite crosses the line that divides deep drone from staid noise. That's not for lack of trying. With Drumm generating sandy textures with ""guitar and noise,"" and Menche adding low end through ""organ and noise,"" <em>Gauntlet </em>is busy and never boring. At times the pair reach some nice peaks: around six minutes in, their humming noise sounds like a march of cartoon bumblebees, and later they hit on a dense cacophony akin to a cicada symphony. But more often than not, the pair's sounds level off instead of escalating, and the incessant helicopter-like rhythms are always hackneyed, sometimes even grating.</p><p>
    One of the most interesting things about powerful noise and drone pieces is the deceptive way they slowly and organically progress. Listen to a great work by Phil Niblock or Tony Conrad in real time and it barely seems to change, but skip around and the actual sonic variety can be shocking. <em>Gauntlet </em>reverses that effect: it often sounds like it's headed somewhere, moving forward at an industrious clip. But jump to random sections and it's clear how narrow the piece is. Drumm and Menche put a lot of effort into their journey, and to say they tread water would be unfair. But wherever it is that they end up, you can still see the starting line pretty clearly.</p></div>"|10574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10574-gauntlet/|5.4|Marc Masters

    Do guilty pleasures even exist anymore? It
    seems like everything, no matter how reviled, can be
    argued as legitimate and meaningful with varying sincerity and irony ratios. After all, Justin ""N'Sync"" Timberlake (deservedly) scored Pitchfork's
    top single of 2006, and last week Chris Dahlen interviewed
    Daryl Hall. Maybe you scoff, but guilt is totally subjective:
    What shames one listener may be openly admired by another. Besides, pleasure
    is pleasure, whether you find it in Rock Plaza Central, New Young Pony Club, R.
    Kelly, or Sixpence None the Richer.</p><p>
    Maybe it's just a misnomer: A guilty pleasure might just be a song that doesn't conform to your typical listening
    habits, in which case it can become an important horizon expander. If that happens, though, the song also becomes an integral
    part of those same listening habits. My (admittedly anecdotal) evidence: Not too
    long ago, I read a blog entry on guilty pleasures, and the comments section
    quickly became a very intense game of one-upmanship as readers proudly announced
    their own guilty pleasures. Where was the guilt in all the grandstanding?</p><p>
    Into this forum steps New York City's Engine Room Recordings, which spent
    three years coaxing 15 indie artists into covering their own guilty
    pleasures. The long-in-the-making album is called <em>Guilt by Association,</em> and the covers are as dubious as that title.
    Either by design or by accident, the compilation seems to define the term as anything
    that is not white, male, hetero indie rock, revealing the casual elitism in the
    idea that one style of music is somehow more legitimate than another. Nobody's
    covering Har Mar Superstar here, although more than a few acts
    manage to turn 1970s rock or contemporary r&amp;b into white, male, hetero indie
    rock. Apologies to Superchunk, but is ""Say My Name"" really a guilty pleasure? Do
    we need a folksy ""sensitive"" reading of System of a Down's ""Chop Suey"" to convince
    us that headbangers might have something interesting to say?
    </p>
<p>
<em>Guilt by Association</em>
    is just a strange collection of songs, with curious highs and lows that make it
    sound like an update on early 90s comps like <em>Super Fantastic Mega Smash Hits</em> or <em>Star Power! </em>(on which artists rescued songs like ""I'm Not in Love""
    and ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia""
    from K-Tel obscurity). The highs include Goat's take on ""Sugar, We're Going Down"", the disc's
    most recent source material and emo's sole representative, even if his quieter, mock-serious arrangement
    manages to sap some of the self-satisfaction from Fall Out Boy's lyrics. Luna reinterprets Paula Abdul's ultimatum ""Straight Up"" as a
    desperately co-dependent anthem, and Devendra Banhart grafts bossa nova rhythms
    to Oasis' ""Don't Look Back in Anger"", making it so coyly seductive that the
    original seems comparatively hamfisted. Between this and his version of Antony's
    ""Fistful of Love"", Banhart might consider a covers album next. 
    </p>
<p>
    The comp's best track, though, is its first: Petra Haden's
    inventive reconsideration of Journey's ""Don't Stop
    Believin'"". ""The Sopranos"" may have
    forever lifted it out of a cheeseball ghetto it never deserved, but Haden's version, recorded
    before the series ended, joyfully re-creates the song through multi-tracked, a cappella vocalizations (her duel guitars are the clincher) that are downright affectionate, preserving the
    song's rock'n'roll romance even as she breaks into Wilson Phillips' ""Hold
    On"" during the outro. 
    </p>
<p>
    But amazingly, <em>Guilt by
    Association</em> <em>doesn't</em> hold onto that feeling and actually <em>stops</em> believin'.
    For every spirited rendition here, there's an uninspired run-through or an apathetic rehash. Mark Mulcahy makes ""From This Moment On""
    sound safe for Starbucks everywhere; Jim O'Rourke just makes the Spice Girls'
    ""Viva Forever"" sound dour; and the Mooney Suzuki's retread of ""Just Like Jesse
    James"" goes limp without Cher's theatricality.
    Eddie Money's ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" gets the folksy treatment
    from Karate frontman Geoff Farina, totally destroying the original's sense of ""speeding down the highway with the windows rolled down""
    freedom. Not even bothering to meet the song halfway, his version embodies the compilation's most discouraging problem: Risking so little adventurousness or unpredictability, too many of these artists really do sound like they feel guilty.

    Only 70% or so of Prinzhorn Dance School's debut
    album is made up of music. The rest is...well, it's hard to say. What do you call
    the space in a song that lingers between the guitar parts,
    vocals, and beats? It's not exactly empty space, since it takes on
    properties that change according to sounds in the surroundings. And it's not
    ""negative space"" as plied by sculptors, whose hold on nothingness
    needn't account for fluctuations in drama brought about by time.
    So what do we call this space, then? Is it material, immaterial? Is it music?</p><p>
    Questions like this rise out of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Prinzhorn Dance School</span><span> whether you want them to or not. For one thing, the
    album is extraordinarily sparse-- calling the instrumentation a simple mix of guitar,
    bass, and drums doesn't get to the half of it. In fact, ""half of"" the sound
    you might expect from such a lineup is more than transpires in a song like
    ""Black Bunker"". Centering on a simple two-note bass riff, the song lurches
    through a series of sudden guitar pricks and distended drums that materialize
    out of nowhere and vanish completely in a matter of seconds. It's a foreshortened blast of rock minimalism, more pent-up than </span><span>even </span><span>the Fall or Wire (two old bands who figure heavily in Prinzhorn Dance School's sound). And over it all, anxious vocals suggest that the ""Black Bunker""
    itself is nothing more than an apartment in which ""You're
    scratching and itching/ Trying to break on through?/ Or hanging round my
    kitchen?"" </span></p><p>
<span>A similar sense of confused routine creeps into ""Do You Know Your
    Butcher"", repeatedly raising its title question while </span><span>depicting a shop where
    ""There's blood on the hands/ Fur on the floor/ Meat/ The smell of fresh loaves
    and pennies."" It plays like a Don DeLillo supermarket scene as distilled in the
    language of Mark E. Smith. For all their debts to the Fall, though, the duo
    behind Prinzhorn Dance School traffic less in anger and indignation than in
    creepy evocations of the mundane: In their songs, everything simple is weird and conspicuous. One typical missive commands ""Don't Talk to Strangers"" for
    fear that ""they'll find out who you are."" Another fixates on ""Eat, Sleep""
    before declaring, with a chirpy, </span><span>deranged</span><span> certainty, ""there are
    monsters... in the deep.""
    </span></p><p>
    The name Prinzhorn Dance School alludes to Hans Prinzhorn, a
    German psychiatrist and art historian who published a book in 1922 called <em>Artistry
    of the Mentally Ill</em>. It's hard not to
    relate the elder Prinzhorn's work-- and the knowing analysis of ""outsider art""
    it fostered-- to songs so mannered and strange. But what could have been a mere
    exercise by a band angling to make a point plays out more as a sort of
    exorcism. Part of the album's power owes to the unerring discipline of the
    sound: Even in a comparatively busy song like ""You Are the Space Invader"",
    Prinzhorn Dance School rock hardest by way of restraint, with vocal
    interjections closely miked to capture chilling bits of mania and instrumental
    parts left dry and dark for the sake of atmosphere. The space in the mix owes
    to DFA producer/engineer James Murphy, whose work here falls closer to his past as a
    protégé of Steve Albini than to his present as a disco-rock don.</p><p>
    However meticulously arranged it sounds, <em>Prinzhorn
    Dance School </em>owes more of its effect to the
    moody interplay of the band itself. Coming off as both magically attuned and profoundly
    alone, Tobin Prinz and Suzi Horn-- a pair of artists from Brighton, England--
    bait each other like two sides of the same brain. It plays out as much in certain
    interlocking instrumental passages as it does in stripped-down vocal
    harmonies that allude to hooks without straining for them. Prinzhorn songs
    abound with the kind of scattered beauty that rises out of old classics by
    Young Marble Giants. But they're darker and more pointed-- manic flashes from a conflicted brain that keep the line between the perceptive and
    the unhinged obscure.

    This release is partly a letter of resignation, partly a
    grim going-away party. After 10 years and eight albums, Tim Bracy and
    Shannon McArdle, the couple who formed the core of the Mendoza Line, have split
    up both romantically and creatively; Bracy gets the band in the settlement,
    McArdle will move on to new projects. <em>30
    Year Low</em> is a mini-album of new material that doesn't just match their
    previous efforts for countrified cynicism, but throws in tabloid helpings of
    sex, politics, and murder. It's packaged with <em>Final Remarks of the Legendary Malcontent,</em> which traces their
    relationship through a dozen and a half covers, live tracks, alternate takes,
    and rarities.</p><p>
    Owen King's liner notes compare it to Bob Dylan's <em>Blood on the Tracks</em>, which seems like an
    unfairly high standard that few artists can match. <em>30 Year Low</em> is more akin to Beck's <em>Sea Change</em>, only less mopey. Still, the band's inner conflicts have
    produced some of their best work in years-- at least since <em>Fortune</em>. They've lost none of their political fervor, as opener
    ""Since I Came"" attests. That song, about an immigrant worker in a chicken
    factory, is, thank goodness, a character study rather than a screed. In general,
    however, <em>30 Year Low</em> stays close to
    the break-up action, chronicling the band's age (""31 Candles"") as well as what
    they perceive as a fruitless music career (""Stepping on My Heels""). Every song
    is deliciously dour, as if the band has embraced the artistic potential of
    failure. ""It's time we rode in separate cars and stayed in our own places,""
    McArdle sings on ""Stepping on My Heels"". ""I'm resigned to just speak my mind
    and then read what's on your face.""</p><p>
    Their caustic, candid wit-- especially in the face of such
    misery-- keeps <em>30 Year Low </em>from
    sounding too self-indulgent or self-pitying. Of course McArdle can sell
    anything: on ""Tell It to the Raven"" and ""31 Candles"" she offsets her honeyed
    voice with eye-rolling phrases that constantly undermines the songs' gravity,
    and she's a perfect foil for Will Sheff on ""Aspect of an Old Maid"", which builds
    steadily and surely into a raucous, nasty climax. Bracy, on the other hand,
    still sounds a lot like Dylan, but on ""I Lost My Taste"" and the title track,
    his sadsack vocals sound like self-loathing is his default setting. As he puts
    it on ""I Lost My Taste"", ""We have such terrible timing, to say nothing about
    taste.""
    </p>
<p>
    If <em>30 Year Low</em> is
    their letter of resignation, then <em>Final Remarks</em> is Bracy and McArdle splitting their possessions. Of course, the
    hard-not-to-laugh bile isn't as concentrated as on <em>30 Year Low</em> or any of their previous efforts, but it's a useful
    band history that argues the band's weaknesses (the goes-nowhere ""Angry
    Crafts"") as well as its strengths (""It Helps to Leave the House""). These resurrected tracks-- especially covers of Richard Thompson's ""Withered and Died"" (as in, ""My dreams have..."") and the Liquor Giants' ""Over the Hill""-- also foretell the Mendoza Line's unceremonious end. The world doesn't need another version
    of Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"", but Bracy instills it with an out-of-time
    curmudgeonliness that sounds particularly telling and makes the ""Sesame
    Street"" outro all the funnier. But it's Springsteen's
    ""Tougher than the Rest"" that stands out. Delivered by McArdle, the Boss's
    promises of determination and devotion sound bitterly ironic on a break-up
    record, a reminder that real life inconveniently impinges on rock'n'roll
    romance.

    It's a shame that most people will never hear the final 90
    seconds of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Hymn of the North Star</span><span>, a
    hybrid of two Loren Connors recordings from 2005 and 2006. Its first and likely
    only pressing-- 499 monolithic, black pieces of vinyl in a thick, gold-trimmed
    sleeve crowned by an apropos half-light, half-dark photo of Connors-- sold out
    soon after its release. Rightly so: Connors, now 57, makes music that pulls
    aged, cloudy film strips from minds, playing them at a tempo and in a setting
    he semaphores with six strings. His translations of the Delta blues and his
    more recent application of those spectral tones to pointillist atmospheres
    evoke things distant but uncomfortably familiar. Writing in the liner notes of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Night
    Through</span><span>, Connors' absolutely essential
    anthology released on Family Vineyard last year, Southern historian William
    Ferris said, ""His music moves like a butterfly that hovers over its blossom.""
    That's essential.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">North Star</span><span> is a
    cautiously romantic record, wide spaces floating between beautiful, sinister
    chords and torpid trickles of notes. For almost 28 minutes, Connors flirts with
    a verisimilar mix of hope and hell, painting scenes in improvised brushstrokes
    from his quiet electric guitar and onto a four-track in his Brooklyn apartment.
    Connors has often put notes and rests on the same pedestal, and </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">North
    Star </span><span>is no different: Instances during
    ""Part One"" bear properties of ""licks,"" but the right notes come broken with
    hesitation.<span> </span>Sweeping chords are
    succeeded by variations where a note is wrong or missing. Harmonics work
    sporadically. ""Part Four"", taken from a live collaboration with Alan Licht in Scotland, starts to feel light and springy. It eventually becomes a simple
    shadow. But during ""Part Five"", Connors gets loud and bright, stating and
    restating one sunny stroke, as if climbing towards something he can't see.
    Still, it stalls, his spirits settling to the low end of the guitar and
    relenting to a brief rumble. Even when he reaches for the same phrase near
    track's end, the notes don't have the same spirit, as though his joy has washed
    down a stream of steady decay.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""Part Six"" is the antithetical apex: Easily the shortest piece here, it is pure ascension. It's nothing if not
    beautiful, optimistic and perfect. This entire record sounds like self-doubt
    and negation, all of the bright spots overrun by an imperfect picture of
    sadness. But ""Part Six"" rises right off the vinyl, its notes the aubade score
    for a dawn at the edge of a treacherous night. Six dozen notes in as many
    seconds: ""Part Six"" is gentle, almost trustworthy. Much like triumphant Sigur
    Rós tracks, the lift it promises pulls the audience along.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Connors was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, a
    degenerative brain disorder that occurs when dopamine-generating cells in a
    specific brain region are damaged, in 1992. He's gradually lost some of his
    mobility and strength, but, according to Family Vineyard owner Eric Weddle, the
    case for how much it has affected his guitar playing is more myth than reality.
    It's just that Connors-- despite having recorded 9,000 hours of music by 2000, according
    to Byron Coley-- isn't finished yet, musically or thematically. ""Parts 1-5"" show
    him perpetually searching for resolution but always falling from the mark. But
    in this closing passage, we see a brief, hopefully arrival. If you're willing
    to look for it, this record and the turmoil that presages its victory are
    devastating. May your search mimic Connors' own, limited-edition metaphor.

What's especially funny is that, 10 years ago, things were quite different for Euros Childs: He was fronting Welsh psych-pop wonders Gorky's Zygotic Mynci who, for a brief spell, were major-label mates with Hanson. But when you gauge Childs' songwriting sensibility, things really haven't changed-- though their weirdo name and early flirtations with costumed performance suggested a band of hippie crackpots, Gorky's were always firmly rooted in a Beatles/Beach Boys melodic tradition. And in his post-Gorky's solo career, Childs has been more than happy to play the housebound McCartney, stripping the songs down to an acoustic/piano base, with analog-synth tones enhancing the warm'n'fuzzy feeling.</p><p>
    For Childs, the nostalgia trip goes beyond the 1970s-pop dressing-- pretty much every song on <em>The Miracle Inn</em> is centered around a wistful, coming-of-age remembrance. The lyrical images read like a ""Sesame Street"" script: red dresses, sunshine, trees, horses, bouncing balls. But while <em>The Miracle Inn</em>'s breezy opening trifecta (""Over You"", ""Horse Riding"" and ""Ali Day"") effectively captures the excitement of emergent puppy love, like all memories, the feeling is fleeting. If Childs now seems comfortably removed from the world of major-label hype-mongering that, back in 1996, had some people trumpeting Wales as the next Seattle, the solemn hymnal ""Outside My Window"" tells a different story. Backed by a slow-motion bass-drum/cymbal beat and an organ drone that's almost funereal in its sense of defeat, Childs contrasts the joy of buying your first record with the soul-crushing experience of making them: ""Write a song and send it off/ Sign a contract and get ripped off."" Though the song tacks on an optimistic denouement (""It took a long time for you/ For the sun to come shining through""), Childs effectively reminds us that nostalgia is not just a vehicle for remembering how great things were, but also for addressing how bad they've gotten now.</p><p>
    To emphasize that point, Childs gives over <em>The Miracle Inn</em>'s second side to a 15-minute, six-part title-track suite that celebrates and eulogizes his favorite (and, given his small-town upbringing, probably his only available) teenage hangout. But despite the song's prog parameters, the move is ultimately anti-climactic, the sections sounding more like discrete songs than complementary parts of a greater whole. The suite begins promisingly, introducing its sweet, ELO-like chorus and gradually increasing the rock-out factor, with Childs and crew having a blast playing the role of the Inn's in-house bar band. But the concept runs out of steam about halfway through as the mood shifts from frivolity to melancholy, partly because the predominant theme-- the impossibility of reliving the past-- has already been well covered by this point. Rather than serve as the album's triumphant climax, ""The Miracle Inn"" plays more like its summary.</p></div>"|10568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10568-the-miracle-inn/|6.2|Stuart Berman

But since new fans (i.e. most people reading this) will find it easy to look past the deficiencies that longtime jungle obsessives (including myself) have been complaining about on message boards and blogs-- the obviousness of the tracklisting, the deathly dry packaging, the deeply contentious liner notes, the preponderance of tracks by renegade hip-housers Shut Up and Dance-- <em>Rumble</em> may still one of the best (or at least easy to actually procure) old-school jungle comps for newbies that's currently out there. Even if it is deeply circumscribed from a stylistic standpoint, with a selection of tracks errs towards anthems, with a few deep pocket wild cards designed to prick the ears of the converted.</p><p>
    All of the tracks on <em>Rumble in the Jungle</em> are linked by their attempt to squeeze as much Jamaica into their brief running times as possible. Of course, the England of Caribbean immigrants already had plenty of reggae lying around, and as the story famously goes, its children demanded something new, with epochal cut-and-paste jobs like Shy FX's ""Original Nuttah"" and M-Beat's ""Incredible"" also being the place where those raw, digitally dusted breakbeats met dancehall and dub. Without that 21st century twist to the funk (instantly recognizable but still improbable over a decade later), that mutated input from New York and L.A., these tracks wouldn't be half so exhilarating or infectious. Like the witty, blubbery low-end of DJ Zinc's ""Super Sharp Shooter"" expanding hip-hop's waistline until it almost bursts--you can't hear it and not smile. This is ""futurism"" that makes you sweat and bounce, sensation-juiced tracks that are arguably closer to the dreaded ""Switch tune at +8"" or ""homemade Lil Mama breakbeat remix"" than modern techno or even dubstep.

But since new fans (i.e. most people reading this) will find it easy to look past the deficiencies that longtime jungle obsessives (including myself) have been complaining about on message boards and blogs-- the obviousness of the tracklisting, the deathly dry packaging, the deeply contentious liner notes, the preponderance of tracks by renegade hip-housers Shut Up and Dance-- <em>Rumble</em> may still one of the best (or at least easy to actually procure) old-school jungle comps for newbies that's currently out there. Even if it is deeply circumscribed from a stylistic standpoint, with a selection of tracks errs towards anthems, with a few deep pocket wild cards designed to prick the ears of the converted.</p><p>
    All of the tracks on <em>Rumble in the Jungle</em> are linked by their attempt to squeeze as much Jamaica into their brief running times as possible. Of course, the England of Caribbean immigrants already had plenty of reggae lying around, and as the story famously goes, its children demanded something new, with epochal cut-and-paste jobs like Shy FX's ""Original Nuttah"" and M-Beat's ""Incredible"" also being the place where those raw, digitally dusted breakbeats met dancehall and dub. Without that 21st century twist to the funk (instantly recognizable but still improbable over a decade later), that mutated input from New York and L.A., these tracks wouldn't be half so exhilarating or infectious. Like the witty, blubbery low-end of DJ Zinc's ""Super Sharp Shooter"" expanding hip-hop's waistline until it almost bursts--you can't hear it and not smile. This is ""futurism"" that makes you sweat and bounce, sensation-juiced tracks that are arguably closer to the dreaded ""Switch tune at +8"" or ""homemade Lil Mama breakbeat remix"" than modern techno or even dubstep. If <em>Rumble</em> rarely relaxes, explores beauty for its own sake, or fails to pay due deference to rave, jungle's emotional and sonic range always precluded an all-inclusive, one-disc introduction. Anyway, you should be jumping up and down too much to really give a shit about historicity.</p><p>

    On Talib Kweli's most recent studio album, 2004's uneven<em> The Beautiful Struggle</em>, he couldn't leave a bad idea alone. Every concept was weighed on triple beams, each line raked over with a fine-toothed comb, and each beat polished to the point of oblivion. But many of that album's tracks wouldn't have worked if Talib had spent a thousand years on them: The hooks weren't there, the themes felt forced, and the approach was off. He went from being the guy who was about to spark a revolution with <em>Reflection Eternal</em> and <em>Black Star</em> to sounding painfully generic amongst faux-street tracks and empty, cynical idealism.</p><p>
    The good news is that Talib rebounds on <em>Eardrum</em>, continuing a trend he began with <em>Liberation</em>, his net-only collaboration with Madlib. The BK MC here sounds confident and relaxed-- he doesn't try to knock it out of the park with every turn at bat, instead letting the album's themes and motifs slowly unfold over 20 tracks. He's also assembled an all-star cast of producers (Madlib, Kanye, Pete Rock, Just Blaze, Hi-Tek) who manage to make a cohesive album that points toward the gospel, soul, and hip-hop sounds that made the best of Kweli's solo work-- <em>Train of Thought</em> and <em>Quality</em>-- so enjoyable.</p><p>
    After experimenting with a harder persona on <em>Beautiful Struggle</em>, Talib seems to have accepted the fact that he's a nerd. The heartfelt, eager ""Eat to Live"" and appealing wispy ""Country Cousins"" recapture the quirky glory of early <em>Reflection</em> tracks, and fans will be pleased to hear there are no missteps such as ""Back Off Me"", where the conscious MC tried to affect a harder persona. There are also a handful of unapologetically pop songs, ones that are surprisingly good and (unlike <em>Struggle</em>'s ""I Try"") don't merely try to revisit 2002 hit ""Get By"". Single ""Hot Thing"", produced by Will.I.Am, comes across like Quincy via Pharrell, while Talib runs down all the little things about the ""sunshine of my life"" that get him ""stiff like a hieroglyph."" Yeah, it's corny, but it's also catchy. For the harder ""Listen!!!"", originally released to moderate success late last year, producer Kwame flips a Fred Williams sample beautifully, mixing it with back-masked voodoo, 808 interruptions, and dramatic string swells.</p><p>
    And while those songs are on opposing ends of hip-hop's stylistic spectrum, most of the production work on <em>Eardrum</em> mixes swooning gospel with carefully crafted r&amp;b drama that nods towards 70s soul mavens Gamble &amp; Huff or the stereo symphonic jazz of David Axelrod. The album's opening track, ""Everything Man"", has a simulated thunder clap, while Madlib's ""Soon the New Day"" offers a slinking, twilight soul anchored by a hook from Norah Jones (yes, that Norah Jones).</p><p>
    As with Common's <em>Finding Forever</em>, spirituality is a central theme on <em>Eardrum</em>. This focus, more than the anti-mainstream rap screeds sprinkled here and there, allows Talib to weave personal struggles into a universal narrative. ""Give 'Em Hell"" is probably the most nuanced and effective example of this, as Talib questions both the rigidity and cultural bias of modern religion. It's heady, abstract stuff, but Talib fills in details with memories of childhood confusion.</p><p>
    There are missteps: Modern hip-hop polemics have fallen out of favor in the light of this decade's faux-populism, and ""Hostile Gospel Pt. 1 (Deliver Us)"", despite an excellent turn by Just Blaze, is unlikely to convince anyone that we need a revolution with lines like, ""I call these rappers baby seals because they club you to death."" Another track, meanwhile, features various people remembering when they first heard Talib and is an exercise in self-absorption.</p><p>
    And though Talib switches up his flow (see his double time rap on ""Country Cousins"") more than ever, he's still prone to rhythmless rambling (see how he ruins Pete Rock's excellent flip of Elton John's ""Border Song"" on ""Holy Moly""). There's also the unforgivable ""The Nature"", with a thin, noiseome guest spot from Justin Timberlake, but Talib gets more right here than wrong. He's made a nice to return to form, crafting a mature album that nods to his past without being a retread.

Or beavering away in an office in the Brill Building in the 50s. Or maybe some place on that off-kilter middle of the road between Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb in the 60s. Almost anywhere, you might have thought, other than Britain in the mid-80s.</p>
<p>Some hard-hearted professors of pop would have it that 1985 was the absolute nadir of British music: all the fizz of new pop gone flat, the independent scene a twee shambles. Yet in records such as the Blue Nile's <i>A Walk Across The Rooftops</i>, the Pet Shop Boys' <i>Please</i>, Kate Bush's <i>Hounds of Love</i>, Scritti's <i>Cupid and Psyche 85</i>, and especially in Prefab Sprout's <i>Steve McQueen</i>, you have some of the most beautiful, enduring British pop music ever made. For a year or two, just before Live Aid and Q magazine, the challenge of making new pop for grown-ups without being dowdy, smug, or jaded was met, quite superbly. It's this guile and grace that bands like Stars and Junior Boys still yearn for.</p>
<p>The Sprout-- it's ironic that a writer so fleet-footed lumbered himself with such a clunking band name-- had debuted in 1984 with <i>Swoon</i>, a record that suggested they were post-graduates of the Glasgow School, taking the Postcard label template to new levels of cryptic wit and elliptical jangle. But as McAloon made plain, his ambitions were far grander. He aspired to the standards of Stephen Foster, Gershwin, Sondheim, Quincy Jones, McCartney; saw himself as a contemporary of Prince rather than Lloyd Cole. He had a grand sense of pop music, and in 1985, that kind of grandeur seemed to be available via producers like Thomas Dolby.</p>
<p>McAloon has said that <i>Steve McQueen</i> is Dolby's record-- he presented the producer with a vast archive of songs and asked him to choose his favorites. Yet
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
this is true most obviously in the profoundly 80s sonic palette. Rather wonderfully and typically, it seems that Dolby even chose to play the banjo on the opening track, the country pastiche ""Faron Young"", via a Fairlight sampler. And the presence on this new reissue of an additional disc of acoustic versions of the songs-- which took longer to record than the original-- suggests that McAloon now feels embarrassed, as though the production has dated or even damaged his songs.</p>
<p>I think he needn't be so bashful; one of the defining qualities of the record is its pop ambition, its willingness to engage with its times, precisely by not being a sullen singer-songwriter would-be timeless classic. Imagine if Sinatra had decided that Nelson Riddle's arrangements tied his albums to closely to the early 50s. According to this additional disc, <i>Steve McQueen</i> might have been some perfectly prim and pleasant Go-Betweeny acoustic curio, rather than how it ended up: the kind of record you imagine Elvis Costello might have made had he been signed to ZTT and been ensconced in a studio with Trevor Horn.</p>
<p>One thing the new versions do highlight is the astonishing maturity of the songs. Coincidentally, almost all of Dolby choices dated from 1979, when Paddy was 22. Yet they sound all the more appropriate sung by a man of 50. ""Life's not complete, 'til your heart's missed a beat,"" he sighed on ""Goodbye Lucille #1"", but now when he sings ""and you'll never get it back,"" his voice breaks with the wisdom of another two decades.</p>
<p>Ironically, considering the producer's name, it's a record in so many ways about infidelity. Or let's say about the consequences of romanticism. Take that cover: Paddy, looking like a dreamy young D.H. Lawrence, astride the kind of Triumph that would have carried the record's namesake to freedom. But the whole album rails against easy escapism: ""Appetite"", sung from the perspective of a girl left to bring up the baby of some young firebrand; ""Desire As"" seeing no escape from a lifetime of new flames; the rueful regrets of ""Bonny"".</p>
<p>And maybe I'm too much a child of those times myself, but it still sounds great to me: the glittering guitar that opens ""Goodbye Lucille"", the 10cc/ZTT moments of ""When Love Breaks Down"". Even Wendy Smith's gaseous backing vocals, haunting the record like the ghost of Hayley Mills.</p>
<p>In fact it seems to me that instead of stripping back the songs from their 80s incarnations, the additional disc could have more profitably commissioned some original covers. McAloon was, after all, the original Stephin Merritt, so there's no reason why he shouldn't have his own Sixths. You can imagine these songs performed by, oh, Marianne Faithfull, Bryan Ferry, Will Young, Kylie Minogue, Rufus Wainwright, or Antony Hegarty. A handful of these songs have the quality of standards: there's no reason why their real after-life shouldn't begin now.</p></div>"|10562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10562-steve-mcqueen-deluxe-edition/|8.6|Stephen Trouss

I would even go so far as to suspect this Renaissance dude of fattening up his résumé intentionally, as a misdirect masking his ambitious yet sloppy music. Considering his two biggest inspirational sources-- classic and noise rock-- this equivocation makes sense: On the surface, Hagerty and his most recent band Howling Hex qualify as your standard meat'n'potatoes rock outfit, yet the group takes great pains in shrouding their potentially accessible sound with disjointed songwriting, arcane lyrics, and other artistic fuckery. And oh yeah, he was in Pussy Galore, Royal Trux, and has written two books as well as an obsessive Howling Hex blog, among other pursuits.</p><p>
    2006's <em>Nightclub Version of the Eternal</em> marked an unprecedented level of button-pushing for the Hex, as a string of seven minute-plus masturbatory jams frustrated even the staunchest defenders of the band's idiosyncrasies. Thankfully, <em>XI</em>'s slicked-back tracks sound like reparations, Hagerty hedging his postmodern tics in favor of three-minute, riff-based rawk that reminds us this is the same rock zealot who convinced Pussy Galore to re-record <em>Exile on Main St.</em> back in the day. Hell, at some points, you might confuse this for a Spoon record. The meaty guitar/sax/horn trifecta on straightforward, swaggering pop rockers like ""Ambulance Across the Street"" and ""Everybody's Doing It"" avoids any protracted jams, the lyrics cogent enough to generate both pathos <em>and</em> a storyline in the latter: ""Broken heart, broken home/ Now you're lyin' there all alone,/ In an ambulance across the street.""</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Hagerty can't go completely cold turkey from the jam band stuff. Even with shorter songs, the ideas still remain fairly loose and unfocused, not to mention the spoken word diarrhea of ""Let Fridays Decide"", a pretentious intermission that undermines much of the album's unexpected edibility. Considering the punch of dirtier, nastier garage rock nuggets like ""Live Wire"" and ""Theme"", I wish Hagerty sought and destroyed more Stooge-isms on this record. Still, the consistent Fogerty shuffles here make <em>XI</em> the most worthwhile Hex release since 2005's <em>All-Night Fox</em>, and a nice little twilight-of-career album-- assuming the sun will ever set on Hagerty's rampaging career.</p></div>"|10567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10567-xi/|6.4|Adam Moerder

    With their alluring cover art and a bunch of song titles (""Open Up"", ""Geyser"", ""The Happy Minotaur"") that might also double as the names of exotic sex positions, it might appear that Artanker Convoy are actively courting the swank bachelor pad market. It can also occasionally sound that way on <em>Cozy Endings</em>, the Brooklyn instrumental sextet's second album for Social Registry, but typically with a lot else going on besides. Incorporating elements of jazz and dub, the eclectic group can recall some of the Beastie Boys' better homegrown funk instrumentals, as well as the dusky post-rock of Chicago's Tortoise / Isotope 217 contingent. Whatever it is they're up to, Artanker Convoy deliver it all with a laidback, cultured flair that seems specifically designed to complement your personal activities rather than compete with them.</p><p>
    Drummer/ band leader Artanker and bassist Joe Fiorentino played with LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy in the short-lived Jimi Clambake Explosion, and their easy chemistry anchors <em>Cozy Endings</em> with a graceful, self-assured authority. The rest of the players-- most notably saxophonist Jake Oas and multi-instrumentalist Chris Seeds-- all display considerable chops as well, but the emphasis here is less on soloing or individual voices than it is on joint exploration. Though the Convoy's sound can point in the direction of the electric 70s grooves of Miles Davis or Herbie Hancock, there is a hazy sense of restraint here that keeps noisier commotion at bay, as the musicians concentrate their energies on servicing the album's hypnotic, understated melodies.</p><p>
    This strategy works to near perfection on the first track ""Open Up"", which builds with exquisite patience from an extended intro of glassy drones and fluttering percussion into a loose-limbed Krautrock stride, with narcotic guitar figures joining Oas' sax in midair for some tranquil dialogue. Less ambitious, but no less pleasant, are the more funk-oriented likes of ""Geyser"" or ""Black Dauphin"", whose smoky organ flourishes and organic rhythms ride with a relaxed, cocktail-hour motion. Sturdy though these performances are, however, there's little here that'll likely leave the listener with more than a few residual traces of perfume or second-hand smoke, and one can soon begin to wish that Artanker Convoy had taken a few more wild chances with their production or arrangements. 
    </p>
<p>
    The only vocals to speak of are Artanker's indecipherable space-whispers on ""Ejector"", one of the few tracks here that threatens to come loose from its moorings. The addition of his voice does bring a welcome element of disorientation, with the song's trajectory aided by Jon Warren's extra percussion and an electronic shimmer that recalls the humid jazz-funk fusion of Herbie Hancock's <em>Sextant. </em>Even more surprising is the presence of pedal steel on ""The Happy Minotaur""; a brief exercise that illustrates how much more intriguing Artanker Convoy can be when they alter just one or two ingredients in their formula. <em>Cozy Endings </em>comes packaged with an extra DVD of visuals supplied by the art and dance collective MUX, whose members have also frequently performed with Artanker Convoy in concert. And though the addition of these videos does greatly enhance the appeal of the album, they also serve to accentuate the impression that this music might be best appreciated when there's other sensual stimulation available at the same time.

    Aesop Rock's most distinguishable characteristic, his relentless verbosity, shows no signs of slowing-- for the mainstream, the uninitiated, or even fans who couldn't keep up with <em>Bazooka Tooth</em>. If anything, his lyrics are harder to follow now, and even with the 80-page lyric booklet from his last EP or the transcription of ""Citronella"" on his myspace, having the words spelled out for you doesn't mean it's going to be easy. When you've got a delivery this dense, all that's left for the confused or the impatient is the tracks, and the Definitive Jux roster has often (if not always) served particular tastes on that front. Luckily, Aesop Rock's latest album, <em>None Shall Pass</em>, is a diverse
    collection of beats-- from his classical-sampling comfort zone courtesy
    of the invaluable Blockhead, to looser more traditional hip-hop, to
    more than a few things we haven't heard him try before. <em>None Shall
    Pass</em> even throws in some laid-back rock riffs, some futuristic funk, a
    generous dash of psychedelia, and, of course, Aes' favorite
    ingredient: paranoia.</p><p>
    That isn't to say Aesop Rock has become impenetrable; that would imply he's no fun. He's got
    enthusiasm, enunciation, and even hooks this time: The ""how
    alive/too alive"" call-and-response from opener ""Keep off the Lawn""
    is custom built for audience participation, and ""Catacomb Kids""
    begs listeners to follow the bouncing ball even if you can't make out every young, suburban misadventure he wedges into the lyrics. The title track quickly steals the show here,
    however, a stunning shake-up in both beat and delivery in Aesop
    Rock's oeuvre.</p><p>
    ""None Shall Pass"" itself slides
    past on a near-disco beat layered with eerie, broken children's
    keyboards and ominous clean guitar that Aes wraps his words around
    nimbly and capably in a way old-school nods like ""11:35"" only
    hinted at. The atmosphere is grim, certainly, but with generous
    bounce and a wry grimace, and it's a microcosm for the vibe of the
    whole record in addition to being its best track. I often miss the
    Aesop Rock who strolled through the grimy back alleys of his city
    just looking for a story to tell on old tracks like ""6B Panorama""
    and ""Skip Town"" (both from <em>Float)</em> but ""None Shall Pass""
    is like a quick drive through the same city years later when it's
    become too dangerous for anything more than a glance out the window.
    </p>
<p>
    Abstraction is an easy screen, however,
    and you may not notice the dark co-dependency tale of ""Fumes""
    move over the line from frank slice-of-drug-life narrative to
    insensitive and bitter through the hissing wet consonants of his
    delivery. Thankfully, it's overshadowed by songs that are straight-up
    playful: The bongo-augmented beat to ""Bring Black Pluto"" is a
    return to what Aesop and Blockhead do best, and while the connection
    between demoting Pluto as a planet and <em>Pee Wee's Big Adventure</em>
    are tenuous to me right now, anyone who fits in a reference to Large
    Marge and the eye of Cerberus in the same song surely earns extra
    points in heaven. Of course, there's guest spots from the Def Jux
    roster, and while Cage talks about his fucked-up childhood and El-P
    talks about his fucked-up adulthood, the former absolutely tears it
    over the irrepressible drumbeat of ""Getaway Car"", and El-P is
    still potent when he's just shouting a few choice words for a hook on
    ""39 Thieves"" and elevating""Gun for the Whole Family"" amongst the
    record's often sluggish second half.<em><br/>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>None Shall Pass</em> is a little
    longer than it needs to be; much as I like his slippery but assured
    flow on ""Five Fingers"", cutting everything from acidic groove of
    ""Citronella"" straight to closing track ""Coffee"" would have
    made the point just as easily. That final track is the biggest jump
    for Aes, with what's basically a live-band track of slippery bass and
    chiming guitar with shades of the Fixx, which he bounces merrily
    over. This is the one John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats guests on,
    and he serves as the sort of fat lady of the record: he speak-sings
    his strangely evocative verse in his pinched and equally distinctive
    voice, and then it's over. I applaud Aes' willing to experiment and
    his taste in songwriters, but it ends the record on an uncertain
    note, and sort of the wrong foot... that is, until you get to the
    hidden track, another seeming live track of gutbucket slide-guitar
    funk, once again darting sideways in the face of expectation.
    </p>
<p>
    What you can glean from a surface
    listening is an Aes who's still paranoid but almost loving it, grown
    somewhat bemused at the looming apocalypse. Part of the shine for
    <em>None Shall Pass</em> stems from goodwill earned by earlier albums
    that were more quotable and more focused, but another very large part
    is his artistic restlessness and his adaptable flow-- you know, the
    part that makes you want to listen to a record more than once.
    Beats-first, lyrics-second people have enough here to return to, and
    lyric freaks know there's plenty here to unpack. <em>None Shall Pass</em>
    is not a case to make him famous, but more a hyper-speed revision of

    debut album <em>All I Have</em> was
    so startlingly, sparklingly perfect that it was difficult to imagine that she
    could even make another album. <em>All I Have</em> simply didn't sound like the beginning of a
    particular artist's story: The album's irresistibility resided in its
    consummately generic take
    on r&amp;b at all levels, writer/producer Rich Harrison constructing
    familiar-sounding but astonishingly voluptuous soul-loop grooves, and lyrically
    wresting the most exquisite sensations from clichés and universalist
    platitudes, while Amerie's equivocations between sweet clarity and ragged soul
    conveyed an idealist snapshot of an entire genre's arsenal of affects.</p><p>
    Despite
    containing her breakout hit ""1 Thing"", 2005's follow-up <em>Touch</em> was a weaker affair: A handful of stunners
    and an ill-advised Lil' Jon collaboration aside, it felt like a retread of her
    debut in broader, less nuanced brushstrokes. Having now parted ways from
    Harrison, on the more successful <em>Because I Love It</em> Amerie attempts to fashion for herself an
    individual persona, a quest that carries her further away from the attractions
    of her debut. <em>Because I Love It'</em>s big, risky strategic manoeuvre is a plush, post-coital riposte to
    Ciara's recent electro-pop revivalism, with many of the songs here investing in
    a deliberately frothy eighties sound that smears together Prince, Jam &amp;
    Lewis, and the SOS Band.</p><p>
    As with Ciara,
    Amerie's tying herself so resolutely to the retro mast pays mixed dividends.
    She pulls off this gloriously inconsequential sound on ""Crush"" and ""Crazy
    Wonderful"", combining sugar-rush explosions of fizzy synth clouds with
    charmingly twee vocals. The danger for her is that in trying so hard to clinch
    this new style she leaves little room to assert her own individual qualities:
    most worryingly, the self-consciously fun ""Some Like It"" is a gruesome pastiche, assembling
    dozens of hooks and reference points, but with no heart to pump life into them.
    </p><p>
    This sense of
    making staged set-pieces rather than songs carries over into more familiar
    territory. The enjoyable but overrated ""Gotta Work"", an energetic funk
    number that liberally samples Sam &amp; Dave's ""Hold On I'm Coming"", verges on
    empty formalism: one senses that its signifiers have been pressed into service
    primarily to remind listeners of how much they enjoyed ""1 Thing"" or J Lo's ""Get Right"", and coalesce into a
    song only as an afterthought. She does better when she doesn't try so hard: The
    more clipped disco-funk of ""Take Control"" might be closer to ""anonymous"" r&amp;b (one could just as easily imagine it coming from Nicole Scherzinger or
    Christina Milian) but it's also a much better song; the enjoyment comes from
    listening to how Amerie still makes it her own, the song's own excitement
    strained through her expressive, almost hesitant phrasing.
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps the
    secret ingredient which enlivens Amerie's best work is her quality of
    earnestness: The best songs here are a trio of dead-serious ballads in the
    second half, all of which relinquish the urge to score points with savvy
    listeners. ""When Loving U Was Easy"" verges on Idol material, its sobbing
    accusations culminating in a gloriously indiscreet, almost painful climax
    worthy of Fantasia or Kelly Hudson. Meanwhile ""All Roads"" is garishly coloured,
    widescreen utopian wonder, somewhere between Mariah Carey and Journey's ""Don't
    Stop Believin'"".
    </p>
<p>
    Best of all is
    the fragile, frustrated ""Paint Me Over"", a contender for Amerie's finest track
    to date, and a timely reminder of her longstanding secret weapons: the
    interplay between the breathy delicacy of her solo lines and the accusatory
    perfection and strength of the multi-tracked chorus lines. ""Chorus"" in both
    senses of the word: Amerie's finest moments flow seamlessly between the lost
    and befuddled Amerie singing alone, overwhelmed by the mysteries of love, and
    the righteous auto-harmonizing Ameries, whose clarity of vision is accompanied
    by exuberance or vengefulness. I prefer the vengeful moments: no r&amp;b singer
    can make the listener feel as judged as Amerie can, like the world itself has risen up in
    anger against your uncaring ways.
    </p>
<p>
    All three of
    these songs extend the album's dominant palatial 80s sound, but in a subtler
    and less self-conscious fashion, more focused on being vehicles for Amerie's
    emoting. Sonic revivalism in r&amp;b usually works best when it sounds breezy
    and incidental-- think of the gorgeous effervescence of Cassie's sweet
    mid-tempo numbers, or Teedra Moses's own, less self-conscious evocations of
    Prince and Jam &amp; Lewis. Perhaps it's simply that you have to believe in these songs to take them into your
    heart, believe that the riotous drum breaks or frosty synthesisers being
    deployed are a true extension of the singer's own feelings. The balance between
    success and failure rests on the tension between the style, the singer and the
    song: Amerie is at her best when the three levels become indistinguishable.

    For a while there, nearly the entire Flying Nun stable made it all look so easy. Album after album of perfect antipodean indie-pop, the product of fertile imaginations and far too much free time in a country that hadn't really shown up on the Western radar since tiny New Zealand lost more fighter pilots per capita during World War II than any other nation in the British Commonwealth. For a minute even the major labels were interested, snatching up acts like the Bats, Straightjacket Fits, the Verlaines, and the Chills before realizing that signing them was a lot easier than selling them.</p><p>
    The Chills' Martin Phillipps was among the most idiosyncratic of the batch, capable of both rousing rock and breathtaking beauty. Maybe he understood that best of all, which explains why the 1990 album <em>Submarine Bells</em> led with the facetiously titled ""Heavenly Pop Hit"", which was certainly two of those things. As for being a hit, well, it never stood a chance. ""It's a heavenly pop hit, if anyone wants it,"" Phillipps sang almost offhandedly, over music so wonderful it's no wonder no radio station dared touch it: it would have made nearly everything else sound bad by comparison.</p><p>
    Still, as the closest thing Phillipps ever came to a hit, ""Heavenly Pop Hit"" was, of course, the track pegged to start this 1995 best-of, released on Flying Nun as a stopgap while Phillipps was between international record labels. But there was plenty more where that song came from-- Phillipps was full of them-- and <em>Heavenly Pop Hits: The Best of the Chills</em> rounds up many of them for those who may not have any of the band's previous albums or collections, and who may be dismayed at the difficulty of procuring said out of print or domestically unreleased albums in the States (as of this writing, the impeccable early singles comp <em>Kaleidoscope World</em> was going for nearly $70 on Amazon). 
    </p>
<p>
    Also from <em>Submarine Bells</em> there's the majestic ""Part Past Part Fiction"", while from the Chills' early days the set draws the irresistible shuffling tribute to a late friend ""I Love My Leather Jacket"", the piano-lead ""House with 100 Rooms"", the charming love letter ""Wet Blanket"", the catchy but bleak punch-the-clock welfare anti-anthem ""Doledrums"", and the ever-ghostly ""Pink Frost"". All these tracks feature Phillipps' uncanny instinct for chiming guitars, humming organ, beguiling melodies, and mournful lyrics often utterly at odds with all the former elements. Lest you forget Phillipps, like nearly every songwriter of his generation, was a punk at heart, this comp tosses in ""I'll Only See You Alone Again"", ""Look for the Good in Others and They'll See the Good in You"", and ""Never Never Go"", three pounding, fuzzy garage-psych nuggets. 
    </p>
<p>
    As for the inevitable missing stuff, where's ""Effloresce and Deliquesce"" and the gorgeous title track from <em>Submarine Bells</em>? Or ""Background Affair"", from <em>Soft Bomb</em>? Or, hell, where's that disc's ""Song for Randy Newman, etc."", which name-checks Brian Wilson, Syd Barrett, Scott Walker, and Nick Drake as Phillipps documents the trials of the cult artist who dares tilt at windmills. ""People take so much then leave you lean,"" Phillipps sings, wistfully, at once in awe of his idols and all too aware that he will likely share the same critics-darling fate. ""Patrons will not feed you longer than they need to/ Your all-consuming passion will leave you craving love."" 
    </p>
<p>
    OK, to be fair, Phillipps isn't entirely blameless when it comes to his own fate. He had trouble keeping the same band line-up intact from disc to disc, and drug problems played a recurrent role impairing his progress. But he had a point: music this perfect doesn't come for free, and seeing his heart and soul spilled out get him nowhere no doubt wore at Phillipps. Hopefully one day he'll get his due-- a new incarnation of the Chills has been up and running for a bit now-- but in the meantime, the best we'll get is documents like this one, sad reminders of what so many missed out on the first time around. Heavenly pop hits indeed.<br/>

    Some rappers have become notorious for waiting a while between dropping their debut single and coming out with an album, but only one of them has gone a full nineteen years. Percee P appeared on his first single with D-Nique as Top Priority for ""Let the Homicides Begin"" in 1988; for a bit of context, that's the same year De La Soul dropped their first single, Scarface and Willie D joined what was then still spelled the Ghetto Boys, and Tupac first moved to California. (DJ Shadow, who would later sample a verse from ""Homicides"" for <em>Endtroducing...</em> track ""Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain"", was 15.)</p><p>
    Perce continued to show up on a number of 12"" singles over the years, spending equal time on either end of the ""ft."" but still maintaining a relatively low profile, carefully building his back catalogue 16 bars at a time. Like most of his underground peers, his brief tenure on a major (Atlantic put out his classic single ""Lung Collapsing Lyrics"" in 1992) led nowhere, and eventually he began his own distribution hustle, standing outside NYC's Fat Beats record store hawking homemade copies of his self-compiled anthology <em>Now and Then</em>. (If he's still hanging out there, buy a copy.)</p><p>
    While that collection proved that the man could stay lyrically consistent even as underground rap mutated from D.I.T.C. to Aesop Rock, his actual full-length (uh) ""debut"" record <em>Perseverance</em> is the first example of what the man can (and can't) do with all-new material over the course of an hour. True to form, he brings his battle-rap show-off tendencies to the forefront, letting his assonant, gymnastic flow-- think Big Daddy Kane's ""Raw"" with even more velocity, or the relentlessness of Rakim's verses on ""Follow the Leader"" rendered grimier-- carry most of the weight.
    </p>
<p>
    Perce's been generally affiliated with Stones Throw over the last few years, showing up on both <em>Chrome Children</em> compilations and performing sets during the label's 10th anniversary tour, so it's not surprising that Madlib handles the production duties for a record this potentially momentous. And he keeps things afloat by deploying just about every trick in his book-- askew soundtrack-library fusion (""Who With Me?""), hazy Southern-fried funk (""Legendary Lyricist""), vodka-buzz soul jazz (""Ghetto Rhyme Stories""), even a bit of stoner metal (""The Dirt and the Filth""). He even hits Shadow with a bit of back-atcha for the ""Let the Homicides Begin"" sample: the break in ""BX (Interlude)"" comes from the same source that gave ""Mutual Slump"" its lead-heavy tom-toms. It's one of his most varied production jobs, unpredictable without being uncharacteristic, and his beats reach the perfect level of busy amplification to accompany Percee's flow.
    </p>
<p>
    That said, <em>Perseverance</em> is largely a one-note deal on the verbal end of things: Percee P's lyrical prowess tends to be in the service of, well, the prowess itself. Cuts like ""Legendary Lyricist"" and ""Throwback Rap Attack"" are, to put it in jazz terms, all solo and no riff-- leaning on a specific vocal or linguistic sound and taking it in every direction he simultaneously can while still speaking English; if the gist of things basically boils down to ""I can rock mics and/or crowds,"" at least Perce picks some uniquely circular ways of expressing it. And even when he's rattling off Möbius-strip syllables and stringing together verses that are too layered and elaborate to even scan as contiguous ideas, much less readily-transcribable quotes, there's something about his technique-- mush-mouthed as it can occasionally get-- that pins you to the back of your chair and makes the inevitable what-the-hell'd-he-say rewinds worthwhile. It's fun to hear him rhyme, even if there's not much insight outside his own sphere of fuck-shit-up braggadocio.
    </p>
<p>
    It's a tendency that's made even starker by the small handful of tracks where he serves as a more straightforward storyteller, like the name-dropping gratitude of career retrospective ""The Man to Praise"", the romantic tribute ""The Lady Behind Me"", or the self-explanatory ""Ghetto Rhyme Stories"". None of them has all the flash or technique of his mic-destruction cuts, but they sound a lot more human in comparison-- as do the wide range of guest MCs, including a fiery turn from Organized Konfusion vet Prince Po (""Last of the Greats""), Jedi Mind Tricks' Vinnie Paz going guttural (""Watch Your Step""), and a characteristic bout of impenetrable smartassery from Aesop Rock (""The Dirt and Filth""). While Percee can easily carry a cut further on his own than his history of guest spots and collaborative efforts might have indicated, it's a dosage best taken one track at a time, but with fifteen solid-to-great non-skit cuts on the record, spacing them out should extend <em>Perseverance</em>'s shelf life a bit-- and tide over hardcore fans until his sophomore album. It's dropping soon, right?

    Robbers on High Street's 2005 debut, <em>Tree City,</em> sounded rooted in urban spaces, specifically their
    adopted hometown of New York City, where they bore endless kneejerk comparisons
    first to local boys the Strokes and then to Austinites Spoon. With the latter
    ascendant and the Brooklyn scene puttering out, Robbers
    might have a chance of actually outliving their early press and building a
    fanbase beyond the bloggers who exalted <em>Tree
    City</em>. So, on their follow-up, <em>Grand
    Animals</em>, they go transatlantic, living up to their name by indulging their
    jones for the jaunty hooks and clever wordplay of anglophile pop. The Spoon-ish
    headlong grooves that stamped their debut remain as a guiding light, but
    Robbers have made this album their application to the Village Green
    Preservation Society, endorsed by Gnarls Barkley producer Daniele Luppi.</p><p>
    Their membership is still being debated. <em>Grand Animals</em> may jostle for more
    musical elbow room, but it sounds just as preening as their previous efforts. Opener
    ""Across Your Knee"" and ""Married Young"" are both parlor pop at its most desperately
    clever and chipper, although the latter at least has Ben Trokan's game falsetto
    to recommend it. ""Your Phantom Walks the Hall"" and ""Guard at Your Heel"" bear
    the mark of Luppi most clearly: On the former, a flamenco guitar plucks out a
    light rhythm, while keyboards create a cloudy backdrop for Trokan's airy
    melody. On the latter, a low, loose brass band gives the song a carnival feel
    that sounds like a late-career Joe Henry b-side. They're intriguing, if not
    always persuasive sidestreets that you wish the band would explore more
    thoroughly.</p><p>
    With Robbers coming across less like actual robbers and more
    like Dickensian street
    urchins picking pockets of passersby, <em>Grand
    Animals</em> switches sounds and styles like street disguises. The opening
    chords of ""The Ramp"" recall the huckleberry friend part of ""Moon
    River"", although the band's
    intentions remain nicely ambiguous, and ""Nasty Numbers"" ends with a credible
    soft-rock outro that could have fueled the whole song. On the other hand,
    Robbers' soul groove and Trokan's falsetto delivery never really click on ""You
    Don't Stand a Chance"", and the Queen guitar line on closer ""Keys to the
    Century"" sounds distracting, like a heckler interrupting a valedictory address.
    In general, these songs work way too hard to attract and sustain your interest.
    Instead of picking your pocket, Robbers overstuff it with bills. Even then,
    there's not much of a payoff.

    When Liars released <em>Drum's Not Dead</em> last year, 
    they convinced naysayers that their turn towards dank improvisation on 2004's critically reviled <em>They Were Wrong, So We Drowned</em> was part of some masterplan: It was seemingly the perfect refinement of <em>Drowned</em>'s experiments in noise and rhythm. A year later, they've taken another hard-left turn. With the band's expectation-defying back story, the surface way to read the new <em>Liars</em> is that it's the murky, art-damaged sound of their last few albums with the rock reattached. Here, the raw two- and three-chord rigor of punk, 1960s garage (and even pop), and early 70s hard rock reasserts itself over the haunted sound of <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>'s tricky, Kraut-ish polyrhythms.</p><p>
    Much of <em>Liars</em> is rhythmically simplistic-- even brutish-- giving it an unexpected caveman thrill after the more cerebral <em>Drum</em>. In some ways, it hearkens back to the beefy punk-funk of the band's earliest material, where they bulked up the skinny-legged skronk of the Gang of Four and James Chance on a meat-and-potatoes diet. But in other ways this heft feels totally new-- classic rock moves melted into a noisy reduction. ""Clear Island"" and ""Plaster Casts of Everything"" both throb to the kind of riffs and howling keyboards that go right for the American rock fan's lizard brain.</p><p>
    In essence, <em>Liars</em> is scorched-blacktop biker music played through the art-rock filter of a band that's spent the last few years steeped in the bleak sounds of German
    new wave and early industrial. The riffs may be shackled to just a few notes, or restrained to a shrieking
    drone, but these are undeniably songs about the Power of the Guitar, not songs colored by atmospheric flecks
    of fuzz and feedback. The rhythm section's Mo
    Tuckerish momentum moves with the muscle mass
    of ZZ Top and the artless abandon of an upstart punk
    band. Liars have always been mesmerizing on stage--
    even if that's often meant Angus Andrew flailing
    around in a soiled dress as much as the musicianship-- but <em>Liars</em> is the first time in a long time that live intensity has really come through on CD.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, this being a Liars record, unpredictability is a foregone conclusion, and the band's turn to heavy metal thunder only makes up a fraction of the album's songs. Elsewhere the group shows a flair for grotty pop pastiche that must have previously been buried under all that jagged percussion. ""Freak Out"" is such a dead ringer for the Spector-spooked feedback-pop of the Jesus and Mary Chain-- right down to winkingly dumb ""rock'n'roll"" song title-- that it's impossible to ignore and likewise no accident on the band's part. ""Pure Unevil"" is shoegaze/dream pop if it had been concocted in a damp nuclear bunker rather than a paisley hippie crash pad. The song reverberates with a sickly but seductive metallic echo, with the drums and Andrew's voice coming from the opposite ends of a mile-long sewer pipe and the lonesome guitar zigzagging off the slimy walls between them.
    </p>
<p>
    The inspiration behind ""Pure Unevil"" is less obvious than the outright homage of ""Freak Out"", but both offer newly tweaked takes on 80s British rock that are echoed in ""Houseclouds"", where the baggy funk rhythm and creaky organ sound like what might have resulted had the Happy Mondays set sail for Bowie's Berlin rather than the ill-fated Barbados trip that produced <em>Yes, Please</em>. It's these laconic, menacing, and almost pretty moments that leaven <em>Liars</em>, adding skewed hooks to a band more infamous (rightly or wrongly) for willful noise and studio jamming. The murk (dub by way of stoner rock) remains constant throughout and moments of past inscrutability occasionally stop the record dead in its tracks. (""Leather Prowler"" and ""The Dumb in the Rain"" go for that same kind of ethereal menace as ""Pure Unevil"" and get to the level of practice space dicking around.) But if <em>Liars</em> flowed smoothly, instead of stopping occasionally to worry at its scabs or piss all over the couch, it wouldn't be a Liars album.
    </p>
<p>
    Instead, hairy warts and all, the album is another script-flipping overhaul from a band that too often gets forgotten when folks start toting up 21st century rock's front line. Inevitably some will claim the album is a concession designed to appease those who ditched the band when the band ditched the rock. But if it doesn't quite confound like <em>They Were Wrong</em> or thrill like <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>, <em>Liars</em> still finds the band ignoring whatever you thought you wanted or needed from them, and doing what they damn well please. Just don't expect the next one to sound anything like it.

    When people think of West Coast indie, it's the Pacific Northwest-- Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, and lables like Sub Pop and Up!-- that first come to mind. The more characteristic melancholic folk-rock sound, derived from Los Angeles' notoriously bipolar 1970s singer-songwriters and best exemplified recently by Silver Lake's late, lamented Elliott Smith, is often overlooked in many circles, with only Rilo Kiley and Silversun Pickups carrying the aesthetic to the mainstream.</p><p>
    Or maybe that's not so much the case, and that West Coast indie sound has merely been transformed into the simpering soap opera soundtrack likes of Snow Patrol and John Mayer. It's easy to see how the mopey and melodic formula of people like Jeff Buckley and eels can be twisted into lite-listening melodrama. Fortunately, there are still bands like Earlimart, quietly chugging away in Los Angeles and preserving the West Coast sound with a spirit that's more than just curatorial, as <em>Mentor Tormentor</em> elegantly shows.</p><p>
    Earlimart have taken their time getting to this point, progressing from their origins as a raucous band with a song called ""Leprechauns Can Really Fuck You Up"" to the lush, romantic polish of a song like ""Answers &amp; Questions"". The transition is so complete on their fifth record, <em>Mentor Tormentor</em>, that the more upbeat tracks, like ""Everybody Knows Everybody"", come off more awkward than the chamberish piano-and-string compositions that dominate this record. Pared down to the core duo of Aaron Espinoza and Ariana Murray, Earlimart's focus is now on creating the rainy-day pop that is so strangely ubiquitous for Los Angeles bands, and it's a style shift that suits them, filling as it does a lately neglected niche. 
    </p>
<p>
    When the band leads with the piano, good things happen. ""Happy Alone"" starts off like a cover of ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", but with rich vocals from Murray and Beatlesesque guitar punctuations, it ends up sounding more like Jon Brion's collaborations with Aimee Mann-- classic rock touchpoints reshuffled into a brooding but contagious atmosphere. It's a shame that track is Murray's only lead vocal on the record aside from the sparse ""The World"", but her harmonies adds a shimmering glow to Espinoza's voice on tracks such as ""Nevermind the Phonecalls"" and ""Bloody Nose"", producing a soothing soft-rock effect from the studio gloss. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's a certain skill to skirting the dangerous territory between lush production and the elevator music adult-alternative of other West Coast sound pilferers, but Earlimart does it gracefully with the ladled-on cinematic strings of ""Don't Think About Me"" or the old-fashioned Rhodes and guitar build of ""Gonna Break Into Your Heart"". The uniformly melancholy mood of the record, cut as it is with Espinoza's fragile voice at the center, may account for the record seeming over-long; three years in the making, it feels about five songs too long, with one epic too many (""Just Because"") and the hokey singalong closer ""Cold Cold Heaven"". 
    </p>
<p>
    That density probably also explains the relative absence of West-Coast indie from the latest chart infiltration; when done properly, it's a bit bleak for the radio, a little heavy for a montage sequence. But Earlimart soldiers on, importing an overcast attitude to the relentlessly sunny environs of Southern California, as their singer-songwriter forefathers have been doing since the 70s. Mainstream success has a way of wearing down regional sounds, but Earlimart appear to be volunteering themselves to preserve the local breed until the fickle genre spotlight focuses elsewhere.

    Joan Wasser's splendidly slinky, slow burning debut record was first released in the UK last summer, but, like a dawdling pleasure cruiser, has taken a year to cross the Atlantic. In this time it's unexpectedly become one of my most frequently played albums. This kind of statistic, now casually available at the stroke of a mouse, can be disconcerting. As a critic you like to fancy yourself never resting in the quest for extreme sensation-- strictly Japanoise drum megacircles, coruscating digital darkwave, and the new Aly &amp; AJ single for me, pal-- so what to make of the fact that, strictly speaking, the most useful record you've heard all year is languidly more-ish AOR? Should we be ethically obliged to link to our last.fm profiles every time we file another esoteric end of year list? Maybe all records should only be reviewed a year after they come out.</p><p>
    One of the reasons <em>Real Life</em> has proved to be such a personal standby, and also why it's such a hard record to write about, is that, just as it slowly insinuates its way into your routine, it's a record about achieving commonplace happiness, taking a breather from drama-- the kind of thing that usually writes white, at least for a critic.</p><p>
    Joan as Police Woman, like Blondie, is a band-- also featuring the sterling Ben Perowsky and Rainy Orteca-- but, as with the inspirational Angie Dickinson, it's essentially a one-woman show. Wasser has a distinguished résumé: a teenage punk and Mahler freak, she trained as a classical musician, played Hendrixian five-string violin in early 90s Bostonians The Dambuilders, and has performed and arranged in both Antony's Johnsons and Rufus Wainwright's band.
    </p>
<p>
    Wasser was also Jeff Buckley's partner from 1994 up to his death, and though it's undoubtedly creepy to speculate about someone's private grief, this loss feels key to her subsequent development. Although she'd contributed to songs in the Dambuilders, it was only really in the wake of Buckley's death-- first performing alongside his band as Black Beetle, then on her own-- that she purposefully began songwriting.
    </p>
<p>
    You wouldn't have to know the biography to detect connections. This isn't to imply some simplistic one-way influence, but rather to suggest a more mysterious musical affinity. The very 6/8 and turbid harmonies of ""Eternal Flame"" conjure up ghosts of Buckley's own galloping ""Grace"". And when the lyric reaffirms ""I can't be the lighter of your eternal flame,"" you can't help but hear a response to one song we know Buckley wrote about her, ""Everybody Here Wants You"", and its line ""You're just the torch/ To put the flame to all our guilt and shame...""
    </p>
<p>
<em>Real Life</em>, as the title suggests, feels like a record about stepping back from the brink of that kind of conflagration, learning to live with the everyday consequences of romanticism. The gorgeous title track breathily pleads ""be reckless with me"", but only in the context of post office queues and spectacles and gentlemen called Jonathan. The deliberate way Wasser unfurls her voice around the simple chorus-- like a cat slowly stretching awake in a pool of sunlight-- is as stately and exquisite as a Bach minuet.
    </p>
<p>
    Buckley himself actually makes an appearance on ""Flushed Chest"", spied in dreamy twilight, like some modern-day Orpheus back from the underworld. But the song doesn't feel like a work of mourning. Wasser sings ""the waterfall was rushing through you"", and-- maybe it's just me?-- I'm put in mind of the grace of Rilke's concluding sonnet to another Orpheus: ""And though Earthliness forget you, To the stilled Earth say: I flow. To the rushing water speak: I am.""
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, on the brassy ""Anyone"", the record prowls with the randy Memphis languor of Dusty Springfield or Willie Mitchell. And Antony Hegarty shows up on ""I Defy"", elaborating on Wasser's marvelously knotty way with vocal harmony. Of course there are moments of drama: on the spooked ""Save Me"", or, especially, ""Christobel"", which trails sepulchral clouds of feedback like a Coleridge poem performed by a seething PJ Harvey.
    </p>
<p>
    But the record is at its best on tracks like ""The Ride""-- just a wash of electric piano and strings. You might mistake it as a mellow supperclub cabaret, world-weary resignation to routine, the kind of sumptuous melancholy you get from Mike Post's theme to ""Taxi"", even. But as Wasser sings ""Starting now, the wait is over-- as long as you jump the ride..."" you believe her. Emerging from grief, stepping into the light, <em>Real Life</em> feels like a wonderfully fresh start.<br/>

    It almost seems like the premise of some odd ""SCTV"" bit: Starting sometime in the late 1960s, Toronto began to develop its own reggae scene, built by a foundation of Jamaican ex-pats who operated just far enough under the radar to keep their music a local secret. When Light in the Attic began releasing a series of records devoted to these artists, including last year's essential compilation <em>Jamaica to Toronto: Soul Funk &amp; Reggae 1967-1974</em>, they brought some well-deserved attention on some of the pillars of that scene: Wayne McGhie, Johnnie Osbourne, Noel Ellis-- even Skatalites original and Studio One musical director Jackie Mittoo, Jamaica's Booker T., who spent much of his life cultivating the reggae community in Toronto. Despite the material largely skewing towards a sound more indebted to the soul and funk that the title hinted at than the day's Caribbean music, the <em>Jamaica to Toronto</em> comp was a good focus point for a resurrection and revival of the Toronto reggae sound.</p><p>
<em>Summer Records Anthology 1974-1988</em> takes things one step further: where reggae went in the 70s, dub was close to follow, typically only as far away as the other side of a 45. In Malton, Ontario, some 20 miles from Toronto, stood Jerry Brown's Summer Sound Studios, the source of a rich catalogue of dub and reggae records, many of which are collected here. If the timespan seems a bit broad-- starting around the same time Lee Perry began his Black Ark era and ranging to the late 80s, the crest of Prince Jammy's digital dancehall days-- it's also a good timeline of where Brown's stylistic flourishes tended to evolve, starting at simple bass-heavy frequencies and eventually expanding into concrete-dungeon echoes, synthesizer drones, and drums that sounded like rain hitting rubber. It's practically a microcosm of the same sort of evolution happening 1,800 miles to the South.</p><p>
    Like <em>Jamaica to Toronto</em>, <em>Summer Records Anthology</em> fixes its focus on a small but strong cross-section of artists. Four of the tracks are given over to Johnny Osbourne, who shows a bit of range with forays into lover's rock and roots Rastafarianism alike: ""Love Makes the World Go Round"", the B-side to Summer Records' first single ""Sun Rise"", is a harmonic duet with Bunny Brown, delicate and aching with a Junior Murvin-style falsetto, while later cuts like the booming ""Jah Jah Live Forever"" and the wounded, mournful ""Warrior"" make up for in raw emotion what they lack in melodic range. The best Osbourne cut, the tense, minimalist ""Right, Right Time"", also features Earth, Roots &amp; Water, a group that dominates the first half of the collection with their presence; as a house band of sorts they're pretty versatile, whether they're playing simple instrumentals (""Come Together"", with Bobby Gaynair, which sounds a bit like the Upsetters in their earlier, less outlandish <em>Clint Eastwood Rides Again</em>/<em>Cloak and Dagger</em> guise) or rattling, synth-heavy echo-chamber dub.
    </p>
<p>
    Though the first three years' worth of material on the record features solid approximations of prime ""Scratch"" Perry and King Tubby, it's the longest tracks, circa 1977-79, that represent the peak of this collection-- and, potentially, the Summer Sound Studios output. Noel Ellis, whose ""Memories"" was <em>Jamaica to Toronto</em>'s most dubbed-out and adventurous track, stands at the center of ""Reach My Destiny"", which pushes seven and a half minutes and spends most of it fusing bass, drums and electronics into a swampy coating of rhythmic atmosphere. Ellis' vocals, which occupy themselves with familiar Rasta exhortations (""God won't you break down this great wall of Babylon for me"") in a gently intense manner reminiscent of Horace Andy tweaked a pitch or two lower, eventually gives way to a staccato guitar that sounds like The Edge in zero gravity. Ranking's ""Chatty Chatty People"" is a bit more uptempo than most of the other songs here, nearly bordering on rocksteady, but the tinny cowbells and aluminum-pipe acoustics eventually give way to a mile-deep piano and the occasional peculiar electronic hiccup that sounds swiped from George Lucas' foley room. And Jerry Brown's own ""Dreadlock Lady"" assembles a tight horn ensemble-- throwing in a flute for good measure-- that he then manipulates into a sort of burbling undersea chorus.
    </p>
<p>
    There is a bit of a hitch at the end of the record, as the material suddenly jumps from 1979 to 1988 and endless-reverb atmosphere and oil drum-meets-shotgun percussion makes way for inexpensive keyboards. The tinny-sounding synthesized horn section on Willi Williams' ""Run Them a Run"" distracts from his mellow rasp, while the digital dancehall of Unique Madoo's ""Call Me Nobody Else"", wonderfully-sung as it is, sticks out as a bit of an anachronistic oddity on an album that's largely half its pace and trends towards live backing bands. (That said, put those two songs on a 7"" and you're in business.) A bonus DVD, featuring a documentary with twenty-plus minutes of late 70s-vintage footage, rounds out the package, and the video is illuminating-- featuring clips of Brown singing superbly as he cruises through the suburbs on a ten-speed, running through a version of ""Armagideon Time"" with Williams, and knocking the dents out of a powder-blue land yacht in his day job at an auto body shop. The latter scene provides a funny little juxtaposition between the sound of his hammer against metal and the percussive ricochets of the track playing beneath-- in its own way, the synopsis of all the ideas on this record, steel hitting steel and striking things into shape.<br/>

    Mavado is very good at one particular thing, and he does that one thing so many times on debut full-length <em>Gangsta for Life</em> that the album gets boring quickly. That's something of an unavoidable flaw. As with most dancehall long-players, <em>Gangsta for Life</em> is essentially a singles compilation, an hour straight of tracks that Movado's been flooding Jamaica's market with for the past couple of years. He favors a very specific type of backing track: grim martial dirges with rolling snares and shuddering strings, war-movie soundtrack fare. Tracks like that make a great showcase for his persona, and that persona is the main reason he's risen so quickly to become a major dancehall star.</p><p>
    Movado plays the part of a remorseful, weary thug, someone who's dug himself so deep into a life of violence that he can't see a way out. His threats are violent and explicit (""cut your fucking tongue out,"" that sort of thing), but he delivers them with a sort of inconsolable sadness. His voice is a weathered, ground-down mumble-moan, and he spends about the same amount of time singing ruefully as he does rapping forbiddingly. His scarred-up visage has certainly done plenty to strengthen the impression that his voice makes, and it's not hard to see why so many people love this guy. He's romantically compelling in a Tupac sort of way, and when he spreads his haunted cry slowly over a stomping track, the effect is powerful. Or, to clarify, it's powerful the first couple of times. Around the tenth, it loses some of its luster.</p><p>
    There's great stuff to be found on <em>Gangsta for Life</em>, but it's also something of a frustrating listen, since it's so painfully evident that Mavado has a much better album in him. More care should've been given to the album's sequencing; of twenty-five tracks, eight are momentum-sapping skits, and many of the songs barely break the two-minute barrier. And when they're all lined up one after another, Mavado's forlorn, violent laments get repetitive quickly. There's something perversely admirable about his refusal to gear his album toward an American crossover audience, but the resulting sonic uniformity is a problem. He may have a far more interesting character than, say, Bermudan cracker Collie Buddz, but Collie's recent debut covers a whole lot more stylistic ground and ends up making for a more satisfying end-to-end listen. 
    </p>
<p>
    Only near the album's end does Mavado even begin to branch out. ""Sadness"", a dedication to his late father, is a bleak and bleary slice of one-drop trad-reggae, a style that fits Mavado's voice particularly well. The quiet-storm synths and wind chimes on the love song ""Heart Beat"" are hackneyed as hell, but his vocal turns it into an affecting exercise anyway. And on ""Squeeze Breast"" Mavado sounds like his soul is being torn apart even when he's singing about fucking; the contrast is fascinating. The last five songs on the record wrench Mavado out of his comfort zone, and they end up sounding way more alive as a result.
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe it's admirable how stubbornly Mavado stays in his lane, but a full-length demands more variation. So the best way to hear these tracks is probably in discrete chunks, as the singles were originally intended. On, say, my iPod's shuffle function, the songs from the album work as short, powerful blurts of darkness and pain. Heard all in a row, they add up to less than the sum of their parts.</p></div>"|10552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10552-gangsta-for-life-the-symphony-of-david-brooks/|6.3|Tom Breihan

    Some 2007 records I was cautiously
    looking forward to: <em>Planet Earth</em>, <em>The Mix-Up, The
    Weirdness, Reformation Post TLC</em>, and <em>All Y'all</em>.</p><p>
    Is it them, or is it me? Or is it all of us? Do we as music fans hold our heroes in too-high regard, forcing them to live up to arbitrary standards that we decided they've met and can never really accomplish again? Is it fair to beat up on Travis Morrison for breaking up his former band and then daring to try something different? Morrison, if anything, is assuredly a musical masochist. His self-admitted heroes, often worshipped via the D-Plan's website (years before the word ""blog"" crept into popular discourse), were Neil Young and Prince-- two musicians who mangle the expectations of their numerous fans almost yearly. It shouldn't have been a surprise when Morrison, free of the checks and balances of his old band, followed his muse to wherever it would go, even when those ideas were embarrassingly toothless or undercooked on his first solo record (which was either about 9/11 or getting a beatdown in front of the Gap; you pick). But trainwreck that it was, he followed through on it, and as with Young and Prince, fans who don't hate themselves outright might learn to let go of expectation and be prepared to ""sit one out,"" so to speak, and see where the next record takes them.</p><p>
    But is asking fans
    for that benefit of the doubt too much? <em>All
    Y'all</em> returns to some of the proud moments and familiar touchstones
    of the Dismemberment Plan-- the glistening chorus of ""As We Proceed"" recalls
    the mellower moods of songs like ""The Face of the Earth"", and that
    song's finale as well as many others betray a more rhythmic, layered
    approach-- and yet, it sounds like the fire has gone out of those
    ideas. Is it any different than before, really, or have I changed as
    a listener? The D-Plan were a near-constant soundtrack to my years
    around the turn of the century--  would anything Morrison ever does
    afterward hold up?
    </p>
<p>
    Not
    that <em>All Y'all</em> sounds all that much like the Plan, or even
    like <em>Travistan</em>. Morrison toured behind his first solo record
    with a three-keyboard band and it shows here. From the subdued
    three-note groove of ""I'm Not Supposed to Like You (But)"" to the
    irascible keyboard burps of ""I Do"" and ""Churchgoer"",
    this is definitely not Morrison's guitar hero record. But if <em>All
    Y'all</em> fails, it's not for lack of ideas. ""As We Proceed""
    strains to make bongos sound angular in its verses, and while the
    vocals are assured and the chorus almost charms, the jittery rhythms
    and hiccup noises wedged in at the end erase much of the goodwill
    built. It's nice to see him return to a more rhythmic approach, but
    it's in a song already crammed with ideas that barely gel. Elsewhere,
    I admire his effort to be frank about sexuality without being
    predatory or apologetic, and yet I never want to hear the demented
    Knack-like groove or desperate panting of ""You Make Me Feel Like a
    Freak"" ever, ever again.
    </p>
<p>
    If only he could
    hold back a bit: ""East Side of the River"" has lyrics that start
    out evocative, but quickly lose focus. Fumbles aside, it's the one
    of the album's simplest tracks-- a creepy slow jam with a few
    unexpected percussive sound effects, and that simplicity makes it
    that much more memorable. Likewise with the very different mood of
    ""Churchgoer"", featuring a giddy pre-new jack keyboard line that
    no one else would dare try, but only someone like Morrison could pull
    off. It's just that <em>All Y'all</em> sounds terribly disjointed when
    many of these concepts collide, if not just inane. (""I Do""
    manages to sound both.) The showy, stuttering rhythms are supposed to
    make up for the banal high school sentiment of ""I'm Not Supposed to
    Like You (But)"", and ""Catch Up"" is a brave mess of a track: It
    was only a matter of time until Morrison called in a guest rapper,
    and while his few contributions on the chorus aren't too distracting,
    it's still rather incongruous with the fey organ chords and windmill
    guitar strums. Plus, Morrison's lyrics about unwilling voyeurism
    coupled with the speed-up and sudden slow-down at the end make for a
    fairly lame extended metaphor.
    </p>
<p>
    It's a bleeding-heart fan's paradox: We keep giving favorite artists more chances because their music meant so much to us at one point in time, even though it gets increasingly less likely it ever will again. If we could listen to this record in a total vacuum, maybe we'd see <em>All Y'all</em> shows a lot of promising ideas with sometimes hoary execution, which is miles of improvement over the inadvisable <em>Travistan</em>. For what it's worth, Morrison still has my benefit of the doubt after <em>All Y'all</em>. It's only eroded just slightly. But what does that say about me...?

    A couple of years ago, <em>Wired</em> magazine tapped Jeff Tweedy to
    curate a night of their ""Next Fest"", the idea being that the Wilco frontman
    would select some innovative act as the future of music. Ever the pragmatist,
    Tweedy picked Joanna Newsom, not for aesthetic reasons but practical ones: in
    the future, he surmised, we'll all be living in a post-apocalyptic world
    without electricity, so he wisely selected a singer who can go without.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    From the start, the Mekons have been making post-apocalyptic
    music, albeit of the wry and electric sort. But <em>Natural</em>, the latest in the group's long line of records, is, per Tweedy's dictum, truly post-apocalyptic folk, music for
    when the lights go out and hope burns only dimly.<span> </span>It's the Mekons unlikely ""unplugged"" bid.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Of course, like most unplugged sets, it's really nothing of
    the sort, and as folk it won't exactly have the purist set nodding in approval.
    In fact, <em>Natural</em>, is only folk in the sense that the Mekons were ever truly
    punk, at least in the standard parlance. Indeed, the semi-legendary Leeds group
    is about as punk as any act that would cheekily title a record <em>Punk Rock</em>.
    Which is to say, for most of their 30 years, the group has been just as closely
    associated with the communal aspects of folk as they have been with any other
    style of music, punk included. The Mekons shifted idioms to fit their shifting
    tastes, but they never abandoning the earnest ideals and outrage that fueled
    the band through decades of Margaret Thatcher, miner strikes and major label
    snafus. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    So, folk, reggae, punk, whatever: <em>Natural</em> is first and
    foremost Mekons disc, of a thematic piece with 2000's mournful <em>Journey to the
    End of the Night</em>, and as such it's important to take note of what the band is
    saying as much as how they're saying it. ""The twisted trees sing,"" go the opening lines of ""Dark,
    Dark Dark"". ""The trees stare back/ And we burn in smoke/ Reflecting in the water
    like ghosts/ Drifting this way and that."" This is Thoreau's nightmare,
    transcendentalism flipped on its side, the forces of nature recoiling at the
    sight of man's folly and fighting back, then sifting through the wreckage of
    civilization. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Or so we might surmise. Thoreau gets a shout out in
    ""Cockermouth"", and the rest of the album is filled with imagery both
    environmental and elemental, with an emphasis on blood and fire. ""Cockermouth""
    introduces the not very bucolic observation of ""jet fighters swooping loud and
    low"" but the song may be a wasteland flashback
    driven by an echoing mantra of defeat: ""You'd don't have to believe in the
    end/ You have to believe this is the end."" 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    A few months back, speaking in his Chicago studio, Langford
    declared his love of classic UK folk, and revealed how much of <em>Natural</em> was
    written and composed in a room of a hired house. That might explain why so much
    of the album sounds like what might come of a band of survivors convening after
    the end of the world, setting their stories to music to be passed on to future
    generations. The instrumentation is largely spare, the lyrics showcasing little
    of the rage or sardonic humor for which the band is known. Rather, this is
    pretty relentlessly bleak stuff, and even the pagan poetry of ""White Stone
    Door"" is played straight: ""Dance the toes right off your feet/ Making up the
    story as you go,"" sings Sally Timms. ""The dancers are all dead we know/ Behind
    the white stone door."" 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The shuffling ""Give Us Wine or Money"" features an agrarian
    scenario played not as Communist utopia but as cutthroat reality where ""on the
    earth where blood is spilt/ The few must feed the many."" The incredible
    ""Diamonds"", with its trademark collective vocals, likens the potential to do
    right in the world to unpolished gems, but success is still tempered by death,
    with salmon lost at sea miraculously finding their way back to fresh water and
    ""the inevitable slaughter."" Even the more rollicking country blues of ""Shocking
    Curse Bird"" features the central metaphor nesting ""in Goya's nightmare."" 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    On 2002's rousing <em>OOOH!</em> the Mekons were pissed and
    fighting back. Here the battle is already lost, the band resigned and, all
    options exercised, waiting for what comes next. The power's out. The lights are off. <em>Natural</em> is the end of
    the world as cautionary campfire tale, the Mekons akin to T.S. Eliot's dejected
    hollow men (whose world ended ""not with a bang but with a whimper""),
    waiting for the sun to rise and wishing the new day will reveal the path
    forward.

    If you've clicked here, you know Robert
    Pollard has written many songs. However, discontinuing the Fading
    Captain series (just to start another vanity label, Prom Is Coming)
    begs for some kind of benchmark tallying, so let's crunch a few
    numbers: <em>Crickets</em> compiles material from some 20 albums (and a
    smattering of compilations, singles, and EPs), many of which were
    released as Pollard was recording, writing, and touring with Guided by
    Voices. Just how many songs that amounts to from Fading Captain #1

    you're curious, he's registered 926 songs with BMI, and the
    exhaustive and very helpful gbvdb.com lists the grand total of those
    which were ever released at 1,242 (13 are cover versions). Starting
    with the first Guided by Voices album (1987's <em>Devil Between My
    Toes</em>), that's putting out forty to sixty songs a year. Just going
    on the hours it took me to finish this review, relatively speaking, I
    am a failure in life.</p><p>
    But here's some simpler math: The long
    and storied career of Pollard's best-known and best-loved band was
    expertly distilled down to the near-perfect compilation <em>Human
    Amusements at Hourly Rates</em> by Pollard himself, and it all fit on
    just one disc. <em>Crickets</em> is two. I assume Fading Captain
    requires twice the space because... actually, I have no idea. Because
    they had to fit that seventh Circus Devils track on?  They had to
    include the a track from the painfully forgettable soundtrack to
    <em>Bubble</em>? Sure, Fading Captain releases were often spotty, but
    there were always one or two gems on even the least essential records
    that should really sustain an album's worth of consistent listening.
    I can barely make it through the first disc.<em><br/>
</em></p><p>
<em>Crickets</em> does the listener the
    favor of ""rescuing"" certain tracks from albums which didn't live
    up to their finest moments, like the impatient and blistering bile of
    the Circus Devils' ""Bull Spears"", or ""Sensational Gravity Boy""
    from the completist-baiting <em>Briefcase</em> compilation, an abridged
    version of GbV's first four-disc <em>Suitcase</em> box with a few extra
    unreleased tracks tucked in. But as with almost any compilation, there are songs that should have been rescued that weren't, which is
    especially frustrating given how much mediocre material they did
    choose. Omitting ""I Drove a Tank"" is a serious head-scratcher, a
    GbV live staple that towers over the other Soft Rock Renegades
    material included here. Same with ""Circle of Trim"" when compared
    to the middling ""Feathering Clueless (The Exotic Freebird)"" from the first Airport 5
    album with former GbV guitarist Tobin Sprout, or taking two tracks from the <em>Motel of Fools</em>  mini-album and somehow neglecting ""Red Ink Superman"".<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Still, prolific as he was, no one should be treated as a human
    jukebox. One of the small, unexpectedly rewarding pleasures of the
    Fading Captain series was hearing Pollard try to fit himself into new
    contexts. Free of the sifting necessary on the albums, many of those
    tracks shine here, like the surprisingly chipper ""Soldiers of June""
    snatched from the more keyboard-based and often creepy ambiance of
    the Circus Devils, or breezier, gentle songs like The Takeovers'
    ""Island of Lost Lucys"" or Pollard's ""Zoom (It Happens All Over
    the World)"", recorded with Doug Gillard mere months after GbV
    played their final show. Moreover, each disc ends with three
    heretofore unreleased songs, but aside from naming one of them ""I'm
    Gonna Miss My Horse"", none of them are very memorable. To be
    completely fair (maybe fairer than much of this material deserves), a
    back-to-back parade of hits would be misrepresenting what Fading
    Captain was all about.
    </p>
<p>
    With its thoughtful, charming packaging, stuffed with photos
    collages and compiling album artwork for every last Fading Captain
    release, <em>Crickets</em> is more like one of the monolithic GbV
    <em>Suitcase</em> sets than a best-of, just half as long and with a
    (slightly) better hit-or-miss ratio. The easy thing to say would be
    that this is a great introduction to material that's as strong as
    Pollard's former day job, and that might be half true. His earliest
    solo material for Matador is as strong as anything Guided By Voices
    ever put out, and under the umbrella of Fading Captain, Lexo and the
    Leapers' <em>Ask Them</em> ranks with Pollard's finest work, as does <em>Speak Kindly of Your Volunteer Fire Department</em> and even the
    first Airport 5 record. <em>Crickets</em>, however, lacks adequate bait
    for completists and will confuse and likely put off neophytes. It's
    simply cleaning house.

Post-rock was indie rockers who didn't want to be indie rockers, it's been said. Avant-rock, a term thrown around more often these days, usually seems like indie rockers who can't really be called indie rockers but debuted at the wrong time to be called post-rock. If you accept that mild oversimplification (and there's $20 in it for you in the future if you do*), then ""future rock"" is as good a place as any to file the latest release by Paul Dickow, aka Strategy.</p><p>
    On Dickow's second Kranky full-length as Strategy, the Portland, Ore., multi-instrumentalist is a laptop savant who sounds like he wants to be techno, ambient, dub, post-rock, krautrock, shoegaze, and psych-pop all at once. Dickow brings to<em> Future Rock</em> a history of straddling genres, whether with his Community Library electronic label, as one-third of electronically enhanced improv group Nudge, on the keyboard for now-defunct post-rock outfit Fontanelle, or as drummer for the late art-punks Emergency. Retro-futurism has its pleasures, sure, but it's satisfying to hear artists melding genres in search of the real deal, especially when the combination is as exquisitely constructed as it can be here.</p><p>
    Like fellow technophilic dilettante Matthew Dear, Dickow divides his latest album between forward-looking pop songs and atmospheric instrumentals. On <em>Future Rock</em>, even the few songs with words rely on textures as much as tunes to fire up your crystal ball (bong?). ""Can't Roll Back"" comes out of a staticky fog for looped hand percussion, funky blaxploitation-film guitars, Fender Rhodes improv, and soothing synth sighs. It's the kind of extended rhythmic trip Arthur Russell might have gone on to take, but first, a vocoded mission statement: ""You can't go forward/ looking over your shoulder."" Through a dubby electronic haze of its own, ""Stops Spinning"" tries to put the world on pause through sheer force of bass. ""Running on Empty"" downplays its vocals in favor of tinny beats, photon zaps, and another bass groove. ""Red Screen"" impressively stacks keyboards, glitchy spoken-word samples, and additional breathy synths up into an electrified holodeck cacophony.</p><p>
    The instrumentals-- and there are fewer of them than you might think on first listen-- imagine an even more broadly encompassing future. Whistling noises over the ambient waves and minimalist beat of the title track briefly bring to mind a Reason-savvy Ennio Morricone-- <em>The Good, the Bad, and the Looks-OK-on-Facebook</em>. The first in a pair of brief ""interludes"" is as ephemeral as a solar wind, but the second has the wobbly shoegazer pitch-bending of My Blood Valentine or perhaps Seefeel.</p><p>
    The ease with which we can now listen to DJ mixes and mash-ups on the Web, or even just different track juxtapositions on an iPod, has helped inure us to genre barriers-- making this possibly as exciting a time as the years when then-nascent scenes like house, hip-hop, disco, punk, post-punk, and even rock'n'roll or jazz were still in their anything-goes phases, before they quite solidified into genres. At the same time, this album's greatest weakness is that it can occasionally sound unfocused next to more conventional ""song"" records, while Swedish group Studio's <em>Yearbook 1</em> is already a looser, more sun-kissed journey into similar space. The genres of tomorrow might not sound like <em>Future Rock</em>, but the exploration is worthwhile, the execution laudable.</p><p>

<em>Twilight of the Innocents</em> is Ash's last album, according to the band. They're not breaking up; they've simply looked at the music marketplace and decided that singles are the way to go in the future. I wonder what their record company will have to say about that, but it's not a terrible idea, financially. If it does come to pass, though, something will be lost, namely the convenient signposting of a band's career that the album format provides.</p><p>
    From album to album, Ash has always been a band that seemingly reacted to itself. They followed up their messy teen-punk debut, <em>Trailer</em>, with a stately, pop-fueled second album, <em>1977</em>, still their best. From there, they've bounced back and forth between their two sides, though a little of each has always been present. This being their sixth album, it would be reasonable to look at their pattern and expect the pop half of the pop-rock hyphenate to come out on top. It does, though this isn't as direct a turn away from the sound of 2004's rocked-up <em>Meltdown</em> as some of their albums have been from their respective predecessors.</p><p>
    They're back to the original three-piece line-up after the departure of second guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, who released a fine solo album earlier this year. As such, there are a few songs that seem to be attempts to prove they haven't gotten any less muscular amidst the sweeping mid-tempo tracks and brain candy blasts of power pop. Bizarrely, the first two songs sound very much like Supergrass-- the chorus melody of opener ""I Started a Fire"", with its long, drawn-out phrases laid over charging guitars, is uncannily like something Gaz Coombes would have written. This isn't a bad thing, just odd.
    </p>
<p>
    But after those two tracks, you couldn't mistake this for anybody but Ash. They don't always come up in discussions of 1990s pop from the British Isles, but they've actually made quite a career for themselves, consistently releasing good and even great albums, and proving to have improbable staying power. They've always had the melodies to make truly memorable songs, which has certainly helped their cause. <em>Twilight</em> contains three excellent ballads in ""Polaris"", ""End of the World"", and ""Shadows"", all of which fall into a lineage that stretches all the way back to <em>1977</em>'s ""Oh Yeah"". ""Polaris"" in particular captures the melancholy feeling of teen anxiety giving way to adult anxiety, but the piano and strings backing Tim Wheeler as he sings ""The innocence you've lost will not return"" on the chorus don't sound soft. Rick McMurray's aggressive drumbeat is simply too high in the mix for it to ever grow limp.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Ritual"" is cut from the same cloth, but puts a more propulsive spin on it-- the chorus is just gigantic, sweeping the listener clear away from the pensive verses. ""Dark and Stormy"" is something new for the band; it's more jangly than punky, with a chunky bass line from Mark Hamilton that nicely complements Wheeler's calmly haunting vocal, which makes him sound like he's been listening to Colin Blunstone. There are a couple of strong rockers-- ""Blacklisted"" especially kicks ass, with massive bass and drums pummeling Wheeler's vocal melody right into your memory.
    </p>
<p>
    A few songs go a little too far with the crunching stop-start bits and displays of power, at the expense of songwriting, and the closing title track reaches too hard for a grandiosity it doesn't achieve, but otherwise, this is a good album from a band whose ability to make good albums has long been underappreciated. Is this the last time they'll make one? Time will tell, but on the evidence of the six they've made so far, that would be a shame.

    Dan Snaith's Caribou project, to borrow a line from another Canadian songwriter, has been a zigzagging journey through the past. He was most entrenched in the present moment on his 2001 debut <em>Start Breaking My Heart</em>, but even that record's soft-focus, post-Aphex Twin electronica seemed pulled from two or three years earlier. By 2003's <em>Up in Flames</em> he began glancing at psychedelia, but through a distinctly 1990s lens, mixing the cracked sensibility of <em>Boces</em>-era Mercury Rev with the ecstatic come-together crescendos of big beat. <em>Milk of Human Kindness</em> from 2005 was connected closely to its predecessor, but it added the unblinking rhythms and tidy instrumental efficiency of 70s krautrock. And now, with his latest album <em>Andorra</em>, Snaith finally and fully inhabits the 1960s, specifically the branch of sun-kissed pop that was aware of psychedelia but chose not to abandon the pillow-soft pleasures of AM radio, of the Zombies, Free Design, the Mamas &amp; Papas, and, of course, the Beach Boys.</p><p>
    The significant factor in Snaith's transformation from his instrumental beginnings is his increased confidence as a singer. On <em>Up in Flames</em>, the voice was another sound to be fed into the computer, a way to reference the idea of songs rather than actually sing them. From there, it's been an unsteady trajectory pointing toward songwriting proper, and with <em>Andorra</em>, Snaith seems to be paying attention to chords and melodic progression first. He may have even titled a song to commemorate the new development: ""Melody Day"", Andorra's first track and lead single, is the most tuneful of the bunch, with Snaith's high tenor sitting squarely in the center of the rolling drums, sleigh bells, flute, and what sound like vintage synths.</p><p>
    ""Melody Day"" is also significant for being the only track to fully embrace what has become a Caribou trademark: the brief pause at the end of a bar which explodes into an enormous volley of percussion. The album as a whole is a touch more subdued; these ""big"" moments-- which were at risk of becoming a cliché, anyway-- appear sporadically, and generally with less intensity. Instead, in <em>Andorra</em>'s more song-oriented first half, Snaith creates tracks that startle with their lightness of touch and joyous evocation of honeyed late-60s guitar pop. A half-decade after the Elephant 6 movement first started to fade, Snaith's move can be seen as risky, but it succeeds, oddly enough, in part because of the one-man-band nature of his project. He still works essentially alone, playing and sampling instruments and building tracks with a computer, and his music, with its loops and thick production, retains the markers of his process. He's also not aiming his music at any sort of radio; the mid-range is jammed full, distortion pops up regularly without apology, and weird sounds appear from nowhere and zoom between the speakers.   
    </p>
<p>
    The sunshine daydream reaches peak intensity five songs in with ""Desiree"", whose very title dates it perfectly: we know from her name that this girl might trip down the streets with the Association's Windy, perhaps looking for kicks or waiting for Mary to come along. There's barely any percussion to speak of, just swells of synthetic strings, bits of flute, zooming harp runs, and chiming guitar leading to a big chorus that's all Snaith's multi-layered voice. Then there's ""Sandy"" and ""Irene"", also names more likely in 2007 to belong to grandmothers. The former is a <em>Andorra</em>'s most dynamic track aside from ""Melody Day"", and also has the most interesting vocal arrangement, its highly reverbed streaks of harmony suggesting of a pop-minded church choir. It hints that Snaith might also be taking lyrical inspiration from a earlier time: ""Sometimes in her eyes I see forever/ I can't believe what we've found."" The words here are not always intelligible-- there's often a lot going on, so they're easy to miss-- but it's safe to say that the music carries the bulk of the emotional meaning.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Andorra</em> takes an odd detour over its final three songs. ""Sundialing"" returns to the repetitious Neu!-isms of <em>Milk of Human Kindness</em> but dresses up the steady rhythm with Day-Glo swirls. ""Irene"" is a short mid-tempo ballad that is instrumental through its first half, and even then the only sound is essentially a drum machine. The tune in its second half is vague, suggesting a more fleshed-out song sitting somewhere else that's never quite articulated. The eight-minute closer ""Niobe"" builds from bubbling, acidic synths and folds in tightly sequenced, Orb-like pulses, an extended slow-burn that occasionally threatens a big climax with a sampled drum fill but never quite goes there. 
    </p>
<p>
    Considering its length and placement at the end of the record, ""Niobe"" is a tad disappointing, never quite acquiring the momentum its structure would seem to suggest. Still, it's also an encouraging sign that Snaith is thinking in these more open-ended terms, that's he's not confining himself to the retro pop explosion that, as he demonstrates here, he has essentially mastered. <em>Andorra</em> will undoubtedly win Caribou a lot of new fans and rightfully so; it's a big, bold, tuneful collection that impresses with its ambition and meticulous arrangement. But it's also nice to think that Caribou's course is not fixed, that the future might hold a few more surprises than what's found here. <br/>

    Having a spacious and loaded musical toybox is a good thing for a band, as Architecture in Helsinki definitely know. The Australian assemblage has a diverse range of identities and is able to appear at various times as a blippy dance-punk outfit, a marching band, an a cappella group, a children's musical troupe, or a psychedelic commune-- sometimes all within the confines of one three-minute song. This shapeshifting ability, and the attention span to match, can be dangerously volatile, though it was corralled impressively on 2005's delightfully manic <em>In Case We Die</em>. But having too many toys can also lead to nothing but chaos, the kind of messy room that ends up in severe punishment when Dad steps on a stray Lego...er, or so I've heard.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <em>Places Like This</em> more resembles that messy room than the barely contained creativity of <em>In Case We Die</em>, which I guess makes me the angry Dad with the sore foot in this scenario. It's no joy to say that this third full-length from AiH often misses the mark; the band clearly has a surplus of ideas and energy, which is the opposite problem to the majority of indie mopesters churning out the same album over and over again. But whereas <em>In Case We Die</em> had at least a smidgen of restraint and pacing to keep the song-suites in some semblance of order, <em>Places Like This</em> hits the throttle like it can't wait to reach the end of the record, pushing the needle into the red a few too many times along the way.</p><p>
    It's a promising start, at least. The electro beats that start of ""Red Turned White"" are slowly joined by a succession of slick keyboards, and while the vocals are a bit on the strident side, there's a nice coda that actually breaks down rather than overwhelmingly layering on the effects. ""Heart It Races"" also finds AiH playing to their strengths, throwing the shrill-along lead vocals against <em>Graceland</em>-esque vocal basslines and tropical percussion, before cresting on a glittery keyboard wash. I can even buy into the <em>Remain in Light</em> shimmy that's the starting point of ""Hold Music"", and the B-52s-impression vocals, until the 2:00 mark, when the singer apparently takes a boomerang to the groin, and it all turns sour. 
    </p>
<p>
    I have no illusions about <em>In Case We Die</em> not being a showcase of overly theatrical and twee vocalizations, but <em>Places Like This</em> takes, um, impassioned singing to a whole new level, that level being Muppets On Crack. It's a singing approach that mars the surprisingly convincing funk (complete with snazzy horn breaks) of ""Debbie"", while a chorus made up of wah-wah baby noises sinks the otherwise straightforward acoustic pep of ""Like It or Not"". They may all be errors borne of excess enthusiasm, but nonetheless they're stylistic choices unlikely to endear Architecture in Helsinki to anyone over the age of four.
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, the band's unorthodox arrangements lead to dead-ends more than usual. While the mid-song detours may be AiH's signature, they remain a risky move, and <em>Places Like This</em> spotlights a couple moments where it backfires on the band. ""Lazy (Lazy)"" is remarkably and pleasingly subdued, until it launches into a disjointed mid-song break of pep-rally yelling and bashing from which the song's micro-groove never recovers. Meanwhile, ""Feather in a Baseball Cap"" can't muster up more than a weak, brief riff breakdown, and ""Underwater"" doesn't ever go beyond its somewhat flimsy aquatic concept.
    </p>
<p>
    The vocal relay race of ""Nothing's Wrong"" and the simple synth-pop of ""Same Old Innocence"" save some face at the end, but on a record that's barely a half-hour, it's not quite enough heft. It almost seems contrary to the Architecture in Helsinki aesthetic to ask them to slow down and stretch out, but the abbreviated runtime of <em>Places Like This</em> makes it seem as though they could have given their ideas more space to breathe, rather than piling them up like a stack of pancakes. As a wise man once said, possibly while peeling a Lego off the bottom of his foot, you don't have to play with all your goddamn toys at once, kid.

And on some level, <em>KMH</em>'s value is in its virtuosity-- Melnyk plays for about 50 minutes without interruption, sounding not like one pianist in one key, but about four in eight.</p><p>
    Melnyk's ""theory"" of performance was called ""continuous music,"" which is a pretentious way of saying he really loved the sustain pedal. Not to slag his Big Idea at work-- which is pretty remarkable to listen to-- but in essence, he took the slow-changing repetitions and broad compositional structure of minimalism and made them busier, foggier, more imprecise.</p><p>
    Though anything with a lot of repetitive internal movement and no distinct melodic impetus can draw comparisons to Steve Reich, 1979's <em>KMH</em> is probably better understood next to other minimalist piano totems: Charlemagne Palestine's fierce, strobe-like ""Strumming Music"", any of La Monte Young's conceptual marathons, or even some of Satie's knottier, more abstract pieces. But ""Strumming Music"" had a monolithic feel to it-- huge, open harmonies hammered without ambiguity. Melnyk's weave is denser, his harmonies more casually dissonant-- the result of two keys passing each other in open space-- and his syncopations much more rocky.</p><p>
<em>KMH</em>, like any of its decent comparisons, is for active listening. In a way, its greatest triumph is to expose the intense concentration minimalist art requires. The Museum of Modern Art recently opened a retrospective of the sculptor Richard Serra, best known for his large-scale works in sheet metal. One of the rooms featured huge, snaking walls of steel. People wove through them like it was a garden maze. Though the detail in <em>KMH</em> is much more obvious, the essence is comparable: minimalism is about being impassive on the most fundamental level. It's about getting in Your Way. A Serra sculpture dictates how people have to move around the room. It's a visceral experience. Similarly, <em>KMH</em> is consuming; it doesn't let you relax. Melnyk's playing is less about composition and more about the physicality required to play it-- he compares the continuous mode to Tai Chi. Minimalism has always been about presence and focus. Minimalist music is ­not ambient music.</p><p>
    Credit due to new Texan reissue label Unseen Worlds for their work on <em>KMH</em>, especially after their great work on ""Blue"" Gene Tyranny's <em>Out of the Blue</em> earlier this year. And it features all of Melnyk's original liner notes, which means neo-spiritualist barking of the highest order-- he didn't even want to make the record, fastidiously explaining the use of six microphones, criticizing machines for their insensitivity to the piano's true ""sound-curtains,"" ending with the florid and patently nonsensical entreaty to ""let them come hear the music only if they want to."" But if you do, don't expect it to fade into your carpet-- <em>KMH</em> isn't cold steel and hard angles; it's minimalism at its most lush, ornate, and taxing.</p></div>"|10545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10545-kmh/|7.8|Mike Powell

The Go's <em>Whatcha Doin'</em> was brutally simple, kinda dumb and fairly inexplicable: how could an album be so guiltlessly enjoyable when it sounded like a caricature of everything goofy about boozy muttonchop-rock, an uncanny simulation of a circa-'66 <em>Nuggets </em>garage band schlepping through the malaise era in a Boris Vallejo-airbrushed, waterbed-equipped Econoline van? The question only became more pervasive when their self-titled second album-- released four years later, after they split with Sub Pop and the long-departed Jack was on White Stripes album #4-- made their previously-reliable formula sound a bit lifeless. Considering the label-scotched fate of their unreleased intended sophomore release <em>Free Electricity</em>, which has gained a small but mythic following as a lost classic of sorts, they could've just lost momentum.</p><p>
    If that's the case, then <em>Howl on the Haunted Beat You Ride</em> is where the Go gain it back. And how they do it is an interesting surprise: Instead of going back to the well of lead-footed, high-powered scuzz-rock that gave them their original swagger, they've retrofitted themselves as a versatile psych-pop outfit that reveals their once-covert tendencies towards romanticism and harmonizing. As great as <em>Whatcha Doin'</em> was, both it and <em>The Go</em> were relatively one-note riff-crunch deals, while <em>Haunted Beat</em> runs through a good span of ideas that, albeit gently-used secondhand (get ready to be sporadically reminded of the Apple Records catalog circa 1971), all come across as the work of a band that's smarter than it's let on.</p><p>
    It does take some chutzpah to start off an album with a song that sounds not unlike solo Ringo Starr, but ""You Go Bangin' On"" is a likeably arch piece of work-- all cane-twirling piano and loose-jointed, stoop-shouldered rhythms and a vocal from frontman Bobby Harlow that injects his gut-deep voice with a casual chortle. Harlow's voice has evolved from his earlier two-mode setting (buttery proto-Casablancas murmur and venomous <em>aw-yeah </em>snarl) into a rogue's gallery of style: teen bubblegum heartthrob on ""Invisible Friends""; Kinks-ian pastoral crooner on ""Mercurial Girl""; doo-wop Anglophile on ""Caroline"". And the other vocalists (which, at various points, include the other three core members of the band) follow suit with a flourish; the way ""Mary Ann"" shifts from the plaintive greaser lead vocal on the verses to a flat but close harmony on the chorus is a nifty trick. Those harmonies benefit from the tight, fluid instrumentation that back them, especially the rhythm section of bassist John Krautner and drummer Marc Fellis: They make malleable funk out of ""Yer Stoned Italian Cowboy"" and roll out a rhythm on ""So Long Johnny"" that smoothly snaps from a jaw-clenching march reminiscent of the Doors' ""Five to One"" to a beat that captures the yearning intensity of turn-of-the-60s r&amp;b. The guitar of James McConnell, meanwhile, is subtle when it needs to be, and imposing when he lashes out-- tense and hornetlike on ""Down a Spiral"", cranking out keening Buck Dharma-isms on closer ""Smile"".</p><p>
    If there are faults to <em>Haunted Beat</em>, they lie mostly in the fact that a band as historically minded as the Go occasionally struggles to find their own identity, and even with the versatility on display, it'll probably take a few listens before it sounds evocative of itself instead of a collection of vaugely-remembered 60s and 70s pop relics. It doesn't help that lyrics are often rote exercises, albeit endearingly-sung ones; clichés are clichés because they work, but there are few real surprises in the songwriting department. The half-poetic doggerel on ""Refrain"" is a bit egregious (""Every shadow has a name/ When I think of mine, I moan/ I hear rumors of such fame/ not for pride, but only shame""), but most of the album coasts well enough on simple hooks-- ""why don't'cha tell me what you're lookin' for/ maybe I can help you out""; ""down a spiral reelin', yeah/ [backmasked gibberish]""; a couple instances of resonant ""la la la""s-- that let most of the profundity come through in the delivery. It's more Sunday afternoon than Friday night, and if you're looking for the big stoopid thrill that made <em>Whatcha Doin' </em>a condensed dose of raw power, you might be disappointed, but as gradual reinventions go this one's a long-awaited reward.<br/></p></div>"|10547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10547-howl-on-the-haunted-beat-you-ride/|6.8|Nate Patrin

    The cover image of Basia Bulat's debut record tells you all you need to know about what's contained inside. Then again, maybe it doesn't tell you anything. Bulat is starkly front and center, donning a floppy hat and a youthful Mona Lisa expression, the sort onto which one might project any number of emotions, feelings, or personalities. A sense of aloof confidence is present, butting up against a naïve cuteness. The music on the disc under the picture shape-shifts as much, at times offering a neo-madrigal folkie or a muted soul whisperer; elsewhere, a lavender-colored soft-folk puree-blender shows up. Bulat further vacillates, like her countrywoman Feist, between little-girl sweetness and womanly wisdom, yet her specific blend of the two sensibilities more closely recalls Lilith Fair than <em>Let it Die</em>.</p><p>
    Bulat's voice is a soft, smoky coffeeshop flutter, most prominently recalling mid-Nineties AAA queens Natalie Merchant and Sarah McLachlan. Ergo, much of <em>Oh, My Darling</em> rings with the same sort of baroque femininity those women mastered. Several songs are coated in a thick lacquer of piano and bowed strings, most prominently ""Snakes and Ladders"", an attractive admixture of aristocratic lilt and snapping rhythm which rates as one of this year's most soundtrack-ready singles. The song's anxious piano motif and string section combination could score a melodramatic montage where a woman's integrity remains intact despite the numerous obstacles in her way.  Within the current atmosphere of music promotion, that equates to ""radio-friendly.""</p><p>
    On occasion, however, Bulat's tunes rely a bit too much on ambience, with a couple of <em>Darling'</em>s songs falling back into a billowing, wispy pastiche-- ""Bulat With Butterfly Wings"", as it were. ""December"", for instance, relies too much on a watery melody to carry the song's wordless middle. Its hopeful refrain, ""I'll hang on/ Even though you're gone,"" doesn't resonate as especially original, either. ""Little One"" also treads dangerously close to MOR territory, a firm drumbeat doing its best to tether the song's generic flutter.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Darling'</em>s most memorable moments come when the frippery is most restrained, and the romantic sentiment follows suit. The timorous ""Little Waltz"" (""I learned how to dance, but I never showed it to you"") only allows its string quartet to enter after the first verse, without chewing much scenery. ""I Was A Daughter"", which starts out with droplets of piano and ""Sinnerman""-style handclaps before blossoming into a gentle torrent of violins and rapid-fire drumming, then recedes and reappears, is another example of Bulat's knack for curious and surprising arrangements.
    </p>
<p>
    She's keen with the folky minimalism, as well; the title track is simple, unadorned feeling, escorted by only acoustic guitar, some multi-tracked harmonies, and eventually a harmonica. The too-short stage-setter ""Before I Knew"" is <em>Darling'</em>s best moment: handclaps, a ukulele, and some luxuriant harmonies surround Bulat, inching toward a folksy recollection of the Concretes' or El Perro del Mar's tranquil melodicism. It's gone, just like ""Darling"", in just over a minute-- simple, beguiling, and hopefully a sign of what's to come from this promising songwriter in the future.</p></div>"|10538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10538-oh-my-darling/|6.5|Eric Harvey

Residual Echoes, Mammatus, Zodiacs, and the masterful Davis Redford Triad all have an insatiable jones for psych's extreme edges: raging, feedback-drenched guitar, jazzy drums, and stair-climbing bass. But instead of ramping up to those heights, they often bypass song structures and tear straight into endless climaxes and elongated tangents.</p>
<p>Measured by that template, California trio the Shining Path sound like they were created expressly to join the Holy Mountain lineup. Each of the four tracks on their self-titled debut starts smack in the middle of crashing crescendos and freak-outs, and keeps rising. But the band is actually an outgrowth of Monosov/Swirnoff (the duo of guitarist Ilya Monosov and multi-instrumentalist Preston Swirnoff), who have crafted two LPs of wide-ranging sound for the Eclipse label. When that pair adds drummer Brandon Relf, their path shines but also narrows, hewing to chugging beats and sky-seeking guitar wank.</p>
<p>That formula works pretty spectacularly on the opening cut, which bears the humble title ""I Think I Am Becoming God"". Fading up to a hurtling jam, the band teems through ten minutes of dive-bombing guitar and propulsive rhythm. Monosov's feedback massaging has a strong Jimi Hendrix bent, and Reif's rolling drums evoke the spastics of Keith Moon. But together the trio most recalls Japanese explorers like High Rise, Fushitsusha, and Kousokuya. That's especially clear in the closer, ""The Day When He Himself Shall Wipe Away My Tears"", which gets jolts of adrenaline from Swirnoff's whirring synth and droning organ.</p>
<p>On the album's middle two tracks, the band slips off course a bit. The plodding bass and drums of ""Hadiku Ner"" never pay off, as they meander around for somewhere to land. ""Moroccan Summer"" is more productive, with spilling noise that piles into nice peaks. But the track mostly sounds like an outtake from the end of Hendrix's Woodstock set-- a fine moment to mimic, for sure, but not exactly the most surprising note for a noisy psych band to strike.</p>
<p>Ultimately, such predictability keeps the Shining Path from greatness. Though impressively executed, their debut is hard to recommend to any non-psych-freak, or even anyone who likes their psych cut with verses, choruses, or just an occasional pause. Not that guys in the Shining Path should necessarily care-- even if they never trod down fresher turf, there are tons of heads out there who will be happy to nod out to their gleaming trips.</p></div>"|10534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10534-the-shining-path/|6.3|Marc Masters

    ""Indie's Biggest Hits""? ""Volume 1""? ""NOW that's what I call indie!"" jokes aside, <em>This Is Next</em> is a baffling artifact of music biz cluelessness. Drawing one track each from 15 recent high-profile indie releases, <em>This Is Next</em> seeks to exploit indie's recent surge in popularity while entirely ignoring the cultural and technological shifts that have made this surge possible. I'm hard pressed to think of who the audience for this would be. Anyone with a cursory interest in the music featured on <em>This Is Next</em> would have no problem freely and legally downloading or streaming most of these songs. And, if you've never heard any of these artists, I can't imagine what about <em>this</em> compilation would compel you to take notice and suddenly drop 14 bucks at your local Wal-Mart (certainly not the cover art). Even if <em>This Is Next</em> racks up plays at a clothing store or boutique or Starbucks, it would largely be competing with the latest releases from Sufjan Stevens, the Decemberists, or Feist-- not to mention every artist featured on <em>This Is Next</em>.</p><p>
    So the more interesting question is, why does this exist? In many ways, <em>This Is Next</em> is a glorified promo sampler from Warner-owned indie distributor Alternative Distributor Alliance, which distributes every artist featured here. Unlike many comparable mid-90s ""alternative"" samplers-- think the excellent <em>DGC Rarities Volume 1</em>-- <em>This Is Next</em> makes no gestures towards unearthing rare or hard-to find material. On the contrary, <em>This Is Next</em> compiles the most popular tracks (often the singles) from 15 well-promoted releases, many of which already saw high chart placement on Billboard (Spoon's latest album, the most recently released record represented here, debuted at #10). For each of its artists, <em>This Is Next</em> offers the single track that a casual fan is most likely to already know and own. Thus, ADA's promotional strategy is at odds with that of the labels they distribute; while imprints like Merge and Sub Pop (the latter of which owns a 5% stake in ADA) often makes its artists' strongest tracks freely and easily available, <em>This Is Next</em> assumes a collection of those tracks will move units. While this strategy might have made sense in the 90s, when even major label-signed ""alternative"" bands couldn't count on widespread promotion, it seems almost comically ill-suited to this moment.</p><p>
    As a listening experience, <em>This Is Next</em> is predictably lazy and disjointed, like the most nondescript college radio show imaginable. The sequencing is hardly revelatory, but how could it be? Would Neko Case into Bright Eyes into Of Montreal make more sense than Neko Case into Of Montreal into Deerhoof?

It's hard to imagine a Spoon fan picking up this CD and discovering Sonic Youth for the first time; in fact, it's hard to imagine a Spoon fan-- or a fan of any of these artists-- picking up this CD at all.</p><p>
    In a sense, <em>This Is Next</em> is totally dispensible; a silly and ill-advised compendium of material freely available to anyone with the initiative to seek it out. But there's also something ominous about it. You don't need to look far to find the stated goal of <em>This Is Next</em>: To ""reach beyond the core album consumer and toward the casual buyer."" This rhetoric is not new, and doesn't bode well for the tenuously symbiotic relationship between major and independent labels.  As the retail market for independent music shifts from mom and pop stores to big box stores like Wal-Mart and Best Buy, major label-owned distributors such as ADA are growing in size and influence.  In a sense, it's a coup for independent labels, who can now get their music into some of the world's largest non-specialty retailers.  But ADA's half-assed and disingenuous attempt to bring indie rock to the ""casual consumer"" reeks of all-too-familiar unrealistic expectations, and conjures unpleasant memories of the music industry's myriad failed attempts to engineer a ""breakthrough"" for independent music.  Historically speaking, bad things tend to happen when major labels seek to impose their own promotional strategies on their independent partners.  With independent music now bringing in money on a major-label scale, the possibility of such intervention (no Arcade Fire joke intended) looms large, and it usually doesn't end well for anybody.</p><p>
    None of which is to say that indie rock shouldn't be reaching a large audience. Nobody wants good bands to fail, just as nobody wants to be that insufferable asshole fruitlessly trying to protect his favorite music from the uncool masses. Even so, as a shoddy, transparent, and poorly packaged ploy to sell indie rock
    cachet to the ""casual"" consumer, this compilation is far more
    condescending than some dude who gets pissed off when he sees a Shins
    CD at Starbucks. Not every attempt to bring underground music to a wider audience is praiseworthy, and the recent popular emergence of indie music is a product of circumstances that can't really be corralled or replicated.  Ironically, these very circumstances stand to thoroughly undermine <em>This Is Next</em>. If nothing else, this album is a reminder that it's not the bands that sell out, it's the business.

    privilege of any pop act to change direction. It's one of the things that makes
    pop music so exciting. But change always carries a degree of risk, and in the
    case of Rilo Kiley's fourth album <em>Under the Blacklight</em>, it manifests a
    wonderful sense of irony: <em>Under the Blacklight</em> is Rilo Kiley's riskiest album
    because it's their album that takes the least risks.</p><p>
    Finding the band's music polished to an almost blinding sheen, <em>Blacklight</em> is not a
    commercial album so much as Rilo Kiley's conception (or misconception) of what
    a commercial album is. It's their ""Project Mersh"", an alternate-universe
    sell-out move. But beneath that surface-- and <em>Under the Blacklight</em> is at
    first listen almost overwhelmingly surface-- Rilo Kiley must know they're full
    of shit. Either they're utterly serious about their flirtation with the
    mainstream or they're taking the piss with a wink. In both cases, the songs suffer
    a smothering slow death by context.</p><p>
    At the same time, the fun-- or maybe ""fun""-- disc stresses how humorless and full of shit Rilo
    Kiley's former indie brethren remain, scared stiff of the prospect of unabashed
    pop in the true please-the-masses sense. But it's still an audacious,
    fascinating exploration of banality, almost to a patronizing point. Perhaps it's no
    coincidence that the big, straight down the middle-sounding first single
    is called ""The Moneymaker"".
    </p><p>
    From note one, the album's
    musical allusions and the references come fast and furious, and are often
    strikingly specific. The mock swagger of ""Moneymaker"", for instance,
    sounds like Heart doing Foreigner's ""Juke Box Hero"", and the rest of the disc
    revels in similar oddball but specific collisions. The title track sounds like
    Aimee Mann writing a song for Mandy Moore. ""Dejalo"" is Rilo Kiley's take on
    Miami Sound Machine. ""Dreamworld"" is <em>Mirage-</em>era Fleetwood Mac. ""Smoke Detector"" is Blondie by way of the Beatles.
    ""15"" does blue-eyed soul like Dusty Springfield. And so on.
    </p>
<p>
    The saving grace for something
    so shallow is, as usual, Jenny Lewis, a strikingly direct singer and an even
    better lyricist. Especially following the verbose <em>More Adventurous</em>, she's
    almost ruthlessly efficient with her words here, making the most of a few
    choice lines. ""Smoke Detector"" demonstrates nearly as many
    derivations and variations in meaning of the word ""smoke"" as there are of the
    word ""fuck,"" including ""to fuck."" ""I took a man back to my room,"" she
    coos. ""I was smoking him in bed/ Yeah, I was smoking in bed.""
    </p>
    In ""Close Call"" Lewis wryly observes ""funny thing about
    money for sex/ You might get rich but you'll die by it,"" while the title track features
    the withering pun of an aphorism ""even dead men
    lie in their coffins."" ""15"" tracks the seduction of a wounded and
    vulnerable young woman, ripe like a peach and ""down for almost anything.""
    <p>
    Many of Lewis's other
    character-study lyrics plum the sexual, too, not like a cop-out coy pop
    princess (even though someone like, say, Hilary Duff could do a fine job with
    the obvious cell phone metaphor of ""Breakin' Up"")  but in a grown up sort of way. Or at least a distorted,
    corrupted, grown-up-in-L.A. sort of way. 
    </p>
<p>
    Ah, L.A., where there's a
    thrift shop on every corner, the breakfast spots bustle well into the night,
    the lines at clubland bathroom stalls snake to early 1980s lengths, acts get
    signed at karaoke bars, and the plastic surgeons know just the thing to do with
    all those rough edges. Forget that Rilo Kiley's songs namedrop Brighton, New
    York, and Laredo: <em>Under the Blacklight</em> 
    adds up to the familiar headline ""California Band Makes California
    Album."" Were all the AOR indulgences at least tied together into a concept they
    might have been more easily forgiven. And were any of those lyrics a little
    more pointed and less generalized, like they were in the anomalously
    galvanizing anti-Bush protest ""It's a Hit"", they'd add up to more than just a
    40-minute short story collection on tape (with incidental music).
    </p>
<p>
    For the relative few who
    really, really care, debates may rage over whether <em>Under the Blacklight</em> marks
    some sort of progress, though what's just as likely is that Rilo Kiley's
    earlier output was artificially regressive in a bid for some sort of cred. But
    leave that stuff to the conspiracy theorists. To be fair, most everyone would
    be well served giving in and enjoying Rilo Kiley's pop for pop's sake, smart,
    dumb and especially smug in equal measure. Song by song it goes down awfully
    easy, but be warned. The band sure cleans up well, but there's a fair amount of
    guilty washing and  hand-scrubbing
    to be done afterwards.

    ""River of Gold"" is the expertly crafted opener of this Toronto band's fourth album, third with Sonic Unyon; it's produced by Ian Blurton, who has previously worked with the Weakerthans, Amy Millan, and others. A mainstream rock contribution to ambient, the song is a stolid, Doves-ish trawl through the elegant muck of bass, soaring electric guitars, and relentless drums. What starts as a potential nod to the National leaves its mark as Explosions in the Sky at a slightly lower altitude, immersed in a haze of dark clouds.</p><p>
    On ""Two Wives"", the band hints at something completely different: prettifying the ugly and tarnishing the pretty, bandleader John Crossingham creating complex major/minor shifts of acoustic guitar and porous vocals. Is there any repetition in this song's melody whatsoever? The notes wander on forever, an example of what the fewest number of music tools (in this case two) can do. Unlike the overstuffed opener, ""Wives"" is sparse, almost barren, a crumpled little post-it note with a lot, emotively, to say. Similarly, ""Focusfocusfocus"" explores the highest ranges of the male voice set to the clock-tick regularity of a simple, tinselly drum machine's beat. Ruminative guitar and bass are drawn in during the wordless interlude for sonar pulses of long, drawn-out notes, a minimal little reminder of Prince (by tone) or early TV on the Radio (by harmony).</p><p>
    This is a far cry from the exit track, the eight-plus-minute ""A Lion in Winter"", yet the saunters and slouches of this sexy, engrossing, bass-driven number have much in common with the meanderings of ""Focus"" and suggest a little of ""Silver Rider"" by Low, another band that dozily flits between awfully depressing and awfully gorgeous. Still, like a number of Blur songs, this treble-free tirade gets boring, the pitchy, hollow vocals carrying no weight over the slow and plodding rhythm commanded by the guitar. With the help of an a cappella interlude the song stays afloat, but its pace wears the patience after the long set of passionate séances that preceded it. This finale almost tries to sum up the rest of the album by moving through several moody scenes, rhythmic structures, and melodies. The song's final minutes are a strangely pop-infused jam session, yet it's welcome for embracing standard prettiness-- which the rest of the album tries to avoid-- and its pick-me-up rhythm.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Cypress Fields"" tries its hand at country-tinged hard rock, which gives way to predictable sashays and nasal vocal yelps. Yet the band still constructs labyrinthine melodies around this more accessible and playful ambiance. It's often the case here that long songs are too long and short ones too brief, like a shoddily edited film. Why is the perfectly understated marching band percussion on ""Palace Gates"", accompanied by lovely, simply vocal harmonies, cut short at 2:44, while the tirade of ""Cypress Fields"" stretched on to 5:10? In any case, ""Palace Gates"" is mesmerizing, its two drums and three vocal parts carrying the whole thing as well as the guitar and voice did on ""Two Wives"". What's darkest here is best-- engrossing, imaginative, dramatic, and yet seldom overdone. The songs leave a strange imprint, being the kind of addictive pieces that one returns to, simply to try to nail the melodies in the mind's ear. The hazily recalled atmosphere leads you there and the intricacies of it keep you.

    Call him a wimp, call him a feeb, call him a hopeless heart-on-sleever, but from the Field Mice through Trembling Blue Stars, few have wrung quite as much beauty from heartache and misery as Bob Wratten. To be fair, not every song Wratten has written is about heartache and misery, but they may as well be. He has a way with minor-key melancholy, albeit not much of a way with anything else. His is a one-note world, and a better one for it. Still, romantic misery is a young man's game, and as the somewhat lackluster <em>The Seven Autumn Flowers</em> demonstrated, this far down the line, a little bit of Wratten goes a long way.</p><p>
    To his credit, though, Trembling Blue Stars' sixth album <em>The Last Holy Writer</em> is rarely mushy. Sappy, maybe, but rarely mushy. The production is sharp, the synth flourishes sympathetic, Wratten's points of reference too high-class and hip to hurt him. In fact, all the highpoints of <em>The Last Holy Writer</em> are especially high, as far as music meant to make you feel low goes; Wratten is nothing if not consistent.</p><p>
    But pulling off any disc this relentlessly focused on the morose is a tough job, and even a writer as talented as Wratten has a time slogging it out from start to finish. As hard as it is to complain about music that aims for loveliness above all else, too many songs are so melodically simple, their tempos glacial and their sound icy and cold, that they threaten to drag the rest of the disc down with them.
    </p>
<p>
    The drifting ""By False Lights"", for example, takes forever (well, nearly three of its five minutes) before it hits much of a modest melodic payoff. ""Schnee Gletscher Glas"" is similarly an exercise in mood setting and not much more. The slow-jam gaits of ""Sacred Music"" and ""The Coldest Sky"" are pretty but boilerplate, and sound a lot like one of Robert Smith's recently unearthed home demos. The would-be epic album closer ""A Statue to Wilde"" is such an earnest slog it's hard to take as seriously as current Wratten foil Beth Arzy sings it.
    </p>
<p>
    Fortunately, the rest of the disc is packed with wonderful (if predictable) highpoints, doled out strategically, and when they come around, all is forgiven. ""November Starlings"", with its ringing guitar pattern and perfect bridge, is as good as any Field Mice song, while ""Idyllwild"" uses Arzy to better effect as it shifts from typically twee to (relatively) forceful. ""This Once Was an Island"" is, along with ""November Starlings"", one of the few faster forays, its hiccupy neo-electro programming and murky synths the perfect bed for Wratten's environmentally themed ennui. ""Say Goodbye to the Sea"" lives up to its name as a strummy folk waltz, and ""The Tenth of Always"" plays like a Motown track at dreamy half-speed, sweet northern soul for the sad and downtrodden; when the tremolo guitar enters the picture your heart practically wobbles with it.
    </p>
<p>
    ""It's just the way your heart beats,"" sings Wratten, by way of explanation for what draws him back again and again to the ones who hurt him most. ""If you think you've gone too far, just keep going,"" he adds, in a sense answering to all who have stuck with his downs and downers for the better part of two decades. Like a moth to a flame, the guy can't help it. The vicarious romantic in all of us should be thankful Wratten's been there for the past 20 years, taking one for the team again and again while our record collections and emotional playlists benefit.

Sure, <i>Arular</i>-- which has quietly sold 130,000 copies in the U.S.-- ultimately didn't seem to make much of an impact on the public at large, but the bountiful texts woven into its rich backstory worked like so much rockcrit catnip; momentarily setting aside the problem of M.I.A.'s own hazily defined personal politics, that album had the effect of nudging the critical forum back towards the kinds of issues it doesn't grapple with nearly enough. Issues that feel more important than ever as our traditional notions of genre and geography melt away, namely: How we square our desire for freshness and fun with the ugly politics of cultural tourism, or whether we bother at all; how the internet works like a hall of mirrors on identity and meaning; whether there's really any such thing as an empty visceral gesture.</p>
<p>If <i>Arular</i> provided a platform to discuss those things, <i>Kala</i> certainly invites us to continue the conversation. For all the scrutiny and cynicism aimed at her in the past 18 months, M.I.A. hasn't dialed herself down in the slightest. If anything, <i>Kala</i> finds her puffing out her chest and asserting herself more strenuously than ever, half-baked agit-prop and all. When she boasts on the stomping, Bollywood-sampling opener ""Bamboo Banga"" that she's ""coming back with power/ Power,"" you get the sense that by ""power"" she means ""courage of conviction."" Regardless of how you square with her politics, her willingness to continue the muckracking is admirable, if not dimension-adding. Don't forget, she's rubbing elbows with the likes of Interscope and Timbaland now; for all the choices she might have made and the audiences she might have aimed at, the fresh-sounding, adventurous, and not-exactly-accessible <i>Kala</i> is the kind of record that obviously demanded a defined personal vision. Taken in concert with her <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/44529-mia-confronts-the-haters"">understandable blasting of Pitchfork</a> for perpetuating the male-led ingenue myth a few weeks ago, this campaign's single biggest revelation is turning out to be M.I.A. herself.</p>
<p>In contrast to her comparatively sparkly and streamlined debut, <i>Kala</i> is clattering, buzzy, and sonically audacious. While it still sounds, for lack of a better word, as <i>digital</i> as its predecessor, the primarily Switch-produced album paradoxically reaches further than the produced-by-committee <i>Arular</i> in terms of its overall palette of sounds. From the disco bassline and gloopy Eurovision strings of the swimmy Bollywood cover ""Jimmy"" to the hairy didgeridoos and pitched-up elementary school raps (courtesy of Aboriginal schoolboy crew Wilcannia Mob) of ""Mango Pickle Down River"" to the bubbling synths of the gloriously woozy ""20 Dollar"", this represents a significant expansion of M.I.A.'s already big tent of sounds. It also signifies her expansion as a performer. Where <i>Arular</i> saw her make the best of her fairly limited vocal abilities, <i>Kala</i> finds her reaching further outward, either by singing sweetly, as she does capably on ""Jimmy"", by peppering her chatter with sudden, free-floating melodies (""20 Dollar""), or by simply putting even more emphasis on the elastic qualities of her usual sing-songy delivery, as she does on the pinched-nose baile funk of ""World Town"" and the celebratory first single ""Boyz""-- a triumph of her rhythmic patter if there ever was one.</p>
<p>On paper, M.I.A.'s politics still register as conflicted as ever. She's as enamoured with her own empty sloganeering as she is disapproving of the western world's, and as likely to remind us that AK47s cost $20 apiece in Africa (""20 Dollar"") as she is to adorn the chorus of her summer songs with cash register ch-chings and gunfire clatter (""Paper Planes""). An easy hybrid of island patois and Westernized slang, most of her lyrics register as being primarily in service of their rhythms, anyway; as with <i>Arular</i>, the things M.I.A. insinuates are often more rewarding than those she actually says. For example, bits and pieces of standard whitebread indie rock tunes turn up like whack-a-moles all throughout <i>Kala</i>. ""Bamboo Banga"" pinches a verse from Jonathan Richman's 1976 middle American driving anthem ""Roadrunner"" only to flip the metaphor from cars to desert animals; ""20 Dollar"" knowingly pilfers the bassline to New Order's ""Blue Monday"" before throwing in a lyrical nod to Pixies; even the island-tinged nursery rhyme of ""Paper Planes"" borrows from the Clash's ""Straight to Hell"".  Whether we're meant to infer anything larger (perhaps about colonization and cultural re-appropriation) from these little morsels is, of course, entirely up to us. But at the very least, it tells us that M.I.A.'s intuition always leads her to interesting places.</p>
<p>And make no mistake, she's in here. While there was a time when you might have been able to argue that <i>Arular</i> wasn't the product of a singular vision, this album makes it     increasingly difficult, if not outright impossible, to say that about     her output anymore. Even more interesting than how an artist acquires a listenership is what they do once they have it. With <i>Kala</i>, M.I.A.'s made it abundantly obvious where her interests lie, and it's not in toppling 130k. Who dares call her an opportunist now?</p></div>"|10564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10564-kala/|8.9|Mark Pytlik

A figurine, meanwhile, is typically frozen into a single pose. It might enjoy an exquisite level of detail, might be nice to look at for awhile. But in the end, it isn't meant to be engaged with-- it sits idly on the mantle, gathering dust, its inflexibility limiting its imaginative potential.</p><p>
    So it goes with the Danish indie band Figurines' third effort. For an album that ostensibly covers so many styles-- from garage psychedelia to pastoral pop to blues-rock-- it's remarkably static. Tempos and structures change, but the mood-- like a bright but overcast day, hard and flat-- is so unremitting as to render these various styles homogeneous. Christian Hjelm's reedy vocals don't spice things up; while winning in spurts, they sag over the course of the album. And its pillaging of influences, most egregiously Brian Wilson and the Zombies, makes it even harder to find anything that feels fresh amid the nostalgia.</p><p>
    Figurines still falls somewhere between Built to Spill's indie/classic rock and Modest Mouse's glassy sheen (or maybe Rogue Wave doing garage rock instead of soft rock), but the smoothing process that unfolded over the first two is still in progress. While it still contains its share of the angles and edges on which the band made their name, a lot of the twangs and yelps are spitted down like errant hairs, making for a largely frictionless glide. The album's ceramic frangibility is sometimes lovely, especially on more retiring songs like ""Good Old Friends"", but doesn't invite excessive handling.
    </p><p>
    These criticisms are tempered by the album's handful of captivating moments and overall pleasantness: Nothing about it inspires hostility, only boredom. A few bits stand up next to most anything from <em>Skeleton</em>, Figurines' widely praised sophomore album. ""Let's Head Out"", wreathed in a fog of spectral harmonies, manages to float and swing simultaneously (the swing is especially important for breaking up the album's overarching stride). Hjelm tends to move between his natural singing voice and falsetto in broad arcs, which doesn't help to make the music dynamic, but here he nimbly condenses the distance between the two, making it more engaging and less belabored. 
    </p>
<p>
    The haunting ""Good Old Friends"" rides minimal percussion and humming synths toward a terse shimmy, flecked with piano and guitar. It's quiet and distinctive, decked out with some neat lyrics (""It arrived when the deer wore blue,"" sings Hjelm, presumably concocting a striking ESL metaphor for nighttime). And ""Drunkard's Dream"", while perhaps overly long at seven and a half minutes, is a tangle of tight, whizzing blues-rock licks that sound inspired, vocals climbing them like a ladder. 
    </p>
<p>
    But elsewhere, <em>When the Deer Wore Blue</em> suffers from a case of the doldrums. ""Childhood Verse"" keeps interrupting its rolling harmonies and twinkling breaks with crunchy garage bits that are unpleasantly antic. ""The Air We Breathe"" is an loving paean to Brian Wilson, replete with bang-on wafting harmonies and falsetto lead vocals-- it improves when Hjelm abandons this deeply derivative sound and sings naturalistically over dreamy piano. The twinkling rock creeper ""Drove You Miles"" is inoffensive but profoundly <em>whatevs</em>. So is ""Half Awake, Half Aware"", which lacks a remotely memorable melody-- and memorable melody is where this band lives or dies. A meandering vocal line fails to make much of the garage psych licks of ""Angels of the Bayou"", and another whizzy blues-rocker, ""Bee Dee"", is too manic to engage with the raucous precision of ""Drunkard's Dream"".
    </p>
<p>
<em>Pitchfork</em>'s review of <em>Skeleton</em> went out of its way to make something special of its hooks, which were in fact its best quality. This is a tough sell, though, because every pop song has hooks, and the difference between a good hook and a bad one is tough to pin down. It seems to have more to do with the hook's context than its actual content-- how it explodes from, settles into, or otherwise complicates the arrangement-- that makes it burn into our memories. Hookiness is still Figurines' defining quality, and there are some good ones here, but in couched in music that doesn't stray outside of the borders of its influences, it's a case of diminishing returns. Unless you're a diehard retro-rock fan, you might want to leave this figurine in its natural environment: on the shelf.

    As much as we love our grandiose anthem bands, it's hard reminiscing about their humble beginnings. Sure, you can watch grainy videos of old-school U2 with their mullets and almost embarrassingly simple technical skill, but it's impossible to retrospectively enjoy them as a simple four-piece band rather than the global tour de force they've become. Fast forward a generation, and you can observe the same ex post facto effect with the Arcade Fire's awkward yet endearing debut EP, which was first received tepidly but now possesses a prodigal quality after two monster full-lengths.</p><p>
    If someday Los Angeles' Foreign Born conquer Earth and devote their time aiding third-world countries, I'm betting <em>On the Wing Now</em> enjoys a similar treatment. Full of vast, powerful tunes that take an earnest aim at the human condition, the band's full-length debut builds on the potential of their previous two EPs while tapping a more varied array of musical influences. Nearly any band with a penchant for the dramatic and/or life-affirming can be heard somewhere on this album, from the Arcade Fire-influenced wall of ""oh's"" on opener ""Union Hall"" to ""The Nights Tall"" crossing jangly guitars and brainy basslines à la R.E.M.</p><p>
    Foreign Born is much more than a pastiche of your nearest and dearest bands, however. Lead singer Matt Popieluch possesses a unique emotive voice that transmogrifies even the most nondescript turns of phrases into climactic profundities. On the wistful ""Trial Wall"", he solemnly croons, ""We've got five years/ To float on by,"" the pathos eerily reminiscent of David Bowie's classic <em>Ziggy Stardust</em> opener. Even with his shrillest of yelps, Popieluch's tone always contains a glimmer of hope, a trick no doubt borrowed from rock's guardian angel laureate, Bono.
    </p>
<p>
    Wielding the expertise of guitarist/producer Lewis Pesacov, a composition major in college, the band squeezes every last histrionic drop out of their cut-and-dry songwriting. Concert hall reverb and dense harmonies mask potentially ho-hum pop chord sequences, and, as the slow, captivating build of ""Letter of Inclusion"" proves, these guys have a great grasp on dynamics and dramatic timing. At times there's a tendency for the songwriting to shirk responsibilities onto this production, in particular on the cold feet pseudo-psych rock of ""Into Your Dream"" or ""Don't Take Back Your Time"", two relatively uninspired tracks. Still, for the most part the studio hot-dogging helps more than hurts, especially in elevating the modest instrumentation to Popieluch's awesome level.
    </p>
<p>
    If there's one problem with Foreign Born as an anthem band, it's that they don't quite yet have a show-stealing anthem. Sure, you have the aforementioned emotional peaks and valleys, but they don't oscillate as wildly as desired, and too many consecutive upbeat numbers tend to flatten their emotional efficacy. ""Holy Splinter"" and ""Union Hall"" hint at the band's ability to write massive songs with an added visceral punch, a more intense psychological kick. Still, the band might as well keep reaching for the stars since their ""failures"" still make for an engaging album, and hopefully this baby U2 someday grows into an anthemic monolith of its own.

    Mexican diabolical duo Hacavitz specialize in blasting aural warfare of the utterly ""troo"" and ""cult"" variety. In fact, so much so that they're signed to the über-undie inner-circle of evilus metallicus, Moribund Records. Last year's debut <em>Venganza</em> was a well-received slab of hell sounds specializing in blackened death metal (aka black/death metal). To the uninitiated, that may only translate as two different kinds of screaming: the death version with Cookie Monster-styled shout-barking, and the black version with high-pitched and guttural raw hamburger-throated shrieking. There are also as key differentiations in guitar riffs: death metal tends to be more angular, dissonant and technical, while black metal can translate from grinding punk chainsaw rips to minor-keyed, often melodic and ""evil"" sounding passages.</p><p>
    Death metal has made a serious come back as of late-- many bands have dabbled in the dark arts of mixing its knuckle-dragging troglodyte-stomping sounds with the witchy and arcane styles of Scandinavian-flavored black metal. Some of the more notable acts would be Akercocke, Angel Corpse, Dissection, Zyklon, and current rising, uh, death stars, Behemoth. Since you've read this far, we'll assume you're initiated in the micro genres of extreme metal and forego the nomenclature hand-holding, but please do watch your head for any low-hanging stalactites and be advised not to rub any loose-laying pentagrams on your forehead or private parts.</p><p>
    For Hacavitz's latest <em>Katun</em> the band lost its bassist and drummer and found itself existing as a terrible twosome, but the lack of members seems to have only increased their focus, and fierceness. Splitting the album down the middle, <em>Katun</em> starts out with five blistering tracks that lean heavily on the mantle of black, and much like another famed cult duo-- black metal gods Darkthrone-- it samples all of the subtle varieties of witch's brew. 
    </p>
<p>
    On the hilariously-named opening track ""Regnum Satani (In League With Satan We Ride)"", blistering hardcore guitar attacks with stabbing staccato accents get steamrolled by blastbeat drum fury that disintegrates into spooky chanting, moaning, waking-up-in-chains bummer-isms. These creepy bits morph into song two, and the album's best track, ""Tinieblas-Tenochtitlan"", a mid-to-slow tempoed apocalyptic smasher that blends bendy rapidly-chugged ax craft atop slow drums, with slowly picked out funereal chord progressions. Cool, dark stuff, but even better when the haunting shaman flute starts blowing its dreamtime plumes about the place. 
    </p>
<p>
    By the time ""From Sin To Honour"" arrives, the tunes switch so that the accent seems to falls more on the death metal-- though the Count Chocula nuggets and the Frankenberry bits remain sprinkled throughout. It could just be a matter of taste, but to these ears, things get less interesting once the BPMs are constantly kicked into the red such as the manic battery found on tracks like ""Ride Thee Nebulah"" and ""Rex Funebre"". The dark, but discernible (even when whizzing by) six-string hand grenades thrown about earlier in the record, get swapped out for full-on grinding, blurring mayhem-- but kudos for the cover of thrash/proto-black legends Dark Angel that closes the disc. Fans of the meat-and-potatoes-thrown-through-an-industrial-fan variety of BM/DM like the previously mentioned Angel Corpse or Hate Eternal should find a pleasant ride though out, otherwise, for this hellish descent hop off around flaming, soul-sucking circle number six.

Take the Coral, who emerged in 2002 amid a torrent of UK critical hysteria that suggested any band of 20-year-olds who displayed a passing knowledge of the Captain Beefheart catalogue could be instantly lauded as the saviours of music. But as the Coral's increasingly reserved five-album catalogue has shown, the flipside of being a band that's wise beyond its years is that that band can sound a little too eager to sound like geezers.</p><p>
    For all the spot-the-influence 1960s sources heard on the Coral's self-titled 2002 debut, there was a restless energy and surfeit of genre-blurring experimentation that liberated the material from being a mere retro exercise; even when they veered toward pastoral folk for 2003's <em>Magic and Medicine</em>, there was a disquieting <em>Wicker Man</em> aura that lent the more serene material a sinister edge. But <em>Roots &amp; Echoes</em> feels locked on an AM-radio dial in 1966, when soul music and paisley pop rotated alongside one another without incident.</p><p>
    With his early gruffness buffed away, vocalist James Skelly has settled into a comfort zone somewhere between Love and The La's-- just call him Arthur Lee Mavers-- his lyrical concerns now entirely consumed by matters of romance and regret. And that shouldn't come as a surprise given that the Coral's most enduring songs (""Dreaming of You"", ""Don't Think You're the First"") are some of their most candid, and the melancholic, bongo-tapped break-up ballad ""Not So Lonely"" counts as another worthy addition to this canon. But in <em>Roots &amp; Echoes</em>' more pedestrian turns, Skelly's sentimentality often feels devoid of passionate intent: ""Put the Sun Back"" is a Sunday-afternoon stroll of a song in which nothing particularly eventful occurs, and while ""Jacqueline"" boasts a beautiful jangly melody line, the tossed-off chorus (""Oh Jacqueline/ I know"") feels anti-climactic. Even opening single ""Who's Gonna Find Me"", which surges forth with controlled bursts of acid-washed guitar, feels lacking, as its foreboding bridge sets you up for a chorus that doesn't really elevate the song above its standard Motown stomp.</p><p>
    Sadly, <em>Roots &amp; Echoes</em>' air of studious refinement sullies even its more cerebral material with schmaltzy gestures; ""Fireflies"" is a sub-Scott Walker mood piece whose title lyric is punctuated by garishly grooooovy organ fluttering, and slow-galloping closer ""Music at Night"" veers perilously close to Dire Straits dad-rock. So in this context, the mid-album rave-up ""In the Rain"" feels all the more urgent and vital, a double-timed northern-soul jaunt that's given an eerie undercurrent by its incessant, spidery guitar line; the fiery, interstellar-overdriven finale of ""She's Got a Reason"" also provides some too-little/too-late psych-rock salvation. But when you've got a young man of 27 already singing wistfully about the ""cobwebs of my mind,"" it's clear you're dealing with a band consumed by the belief that old age is wasted on the elderly.</p></div>"|10529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10529-roots-echoes/|5.2|Stuart Berman

Sorry, bros, no dice. Putting aside that ""supergroup"" is a much easier term than ""band made up of people from other notable bands,"" it also has certain connotations about the way a band operates that fits the New Porns snugly, from how they tour in various iterations depending on the schedules of the primary figures to how the albums have allotted space for each songwriter or singer (i.e. the Bejar-Triad Rule). Whether due to evil, lazy media folk like me or their own early press kits, the New Pornographers will never be seen as just a regular group, especially as the profile of Neko Case, Destroyer, and Carl Newman grows concurrent with the band's success.</p><p>
    But maybe the reluctance to accept the term is wise; after all, supergroups aren't known for their longevity. That's especially been a worry for the New Pornographers, whose first record, <em>Mass Romantic</em>, sounded like the giddy, breathless product of a few collaborative weekends snuck between other commitments, a brilliantly spontaneous all-star one-off. Those kinds of records are the hardest to replicate, and the band struggled to find its legs through the inconsistent and tentative <em>Electric Version</em>. It took 2005's <em>Twin Cinema</em> to confirm them as more than a side project, in part by successfully establishing a group identity beyond the three stars-- Kurt Dahle's drumming was as crucial as any vocal turn on the record.</p><p>
    You'd expect <em>Challengers</em> to build on that momentum, as the New Pornographers get used to touring without Case or Bejar and members like Dahle and Kathryn Calder continue to step up their game. But at the same time, the increasing ""guest-star"" status of Case/Bejar has made the Pornographers even more firmly Newman's show to run. Of course, Newman's always had his hands on the steering wheel, but <em>Challengers</em> asserts his dominance; with its mellow mood and baritone guitar obsession, it's more a sequel to his solo record <em>The Slow Wonder</em> than <em>Twin Cinema</em>.
    </p><p>
    That's not entirely a bad thing, as <em>The Slow Wonder</em> is like the great lost New Pornographers record. But the determination of <em>Challengers</em> to sound mature and not get too crazy is frustrating in the context of the Pornographers catalog. With its string sections and French horns and four different vocalists, it's on a larger scope than the intimate <em>Wonder</em>, and thus is less pleasant evening pop than widescreen midtempo power ballad territory. The Pornographers have dallied with this sound-- ""The Bones of an Idol,"" for instance-- but only as contrast betwixt the power-pop sugar-highs. Now those up-beat moments are themselves the contrast, rather than the focus, and <em>Challengers</em> sags because of it.
    </p>
<p>
    Those first three songs set this agenda: ""My Rights Versus Yours"" resembling a <em>Slow Wonder </em>outtake with its chugging <em>Pet Sounds </em>baritone foundation and awkward refrain, the repetitive, teasingly flat ""All the Old Showstoppers"", and the title track, which squanders Case's pipes on a meandering ballad with no peaks. Even Bejar appears to have gotten the memo, as his ""Myriad Harbour"" contains plenty of characteristic vocal jokes-- intrusive, impatient backing singers, lyrics directed at fellow Pornographers-- but doesn't even touch the sprawl of his anthemic <em>Rubies</em> work. 
    </p>
<p>
    Finally, 15 minutes in, the Pornographers deign to give us the throwback of ""All of the Things that Go to Make Heaven and Earth"", the first spike of genuine pop enthusiasm to cut through the ruminative fog. Yet it's only a brief flash, its energy quickly absorbed by Calder's uninspiring vocal debut ""Failsafe,"" and the lumbering six-and-a-half minutes of ""Unguided,"" as schmaltzy as the usually nonsensical Newman has ever gotten. Sadly, the album never recovers: there's another Neko-wasting tune (""Go Places""), two forgettable Bejar C-sides, and only one more track that attempts to recapture the old pep (""Mutiny, I Promise You"").
    </p>
<p>
    But the problem isn't so much the pace of the record as the topography; <em>Twin Cinema</em> ballads like ""Bleeding Heart Show"" and ""These Are the Fables"" built to euphoric payoffs, while <em>Challengers</em> tracks end with uncharacteristic whimpers instead of bangs. Newman, as the undisputed leader at this point, has to take most of the blame, but it's possible to cite the other primaries as well, as Neko and Bejar show up just to go through the motions. Perhaps it's just impossible for a supergroup-- sorry, band made up of people in other notable bands-- to properly mature, but <em>Challengers</em> is the first to suggest that the spark of creative collaboration may be gone from the New Pornographers, and that settling into being just a regular band is more challenging than they might have thought.

    On their first LP in over five years, power-poppers Imperial Teen vie with Sonic Youth for the title of ""most ironic band name."" Barreling toward middle age, they've managed to keep the teenaged enthusiasm that defines their music intact. But it hasn't been easy for them. <em>The Hair the TV the Baby and the Band</em> is a meta-album that downplays the pansexual exuberance with which Imperial Teen are most closely associated. Instead, it focuses on growing old with grace, and the difficulties of continuing to rock out against the depredations of age.</p><p>
    Despite the fact that only two of Imperial Teen's four albums came out in the 1990s-- the mid-to-late 1990s, at that-- they epitomize the sound and style of that decade's alterna-rock boom. Roddy Bottum is a 90s double-threat, having been the keyboardist for Faith No More before starting Imperial Teen. IT's hit single ""Yoo-Hoo"" was a staple on MTV's <em>120 Minutes</em>, that pacesetter of  all things alternative, just before the program slipped into the backwaters of MTV2 as alternative's cultural relevance waned.</p><p>
    The indelible panting that rhythmically undergirded ""Yoo-Hoo"" is scattered about the new album, including the song ""Shim Sham"" (and wasn't ""Shim Sham"" one of the fake U.S. states that Bob Odenkirk attempted to name in seven seconds on another 90s staple, HBO's ""Mr. Show""?), which also name-checks the Rock*A*Teens. Imperial Teen have always had this bald-faced eagerness, which makes their music appealing while threatening to push it toward the silliness that occasionally plagues this comeback album. Regardless, <em>The Hair the TV</em> is a musical time capsule; Imperial Teen have done little to change their B-52s-redolent formula. It brims with delirious male/female harmonies, turbocharged garage-pop guitars and jangly indie-pop ones, rollicking rhythms, boisterous count-offs, bratty exclamations, and saccharine melodies. 
    </p>
<p>
    If the album's sound roots it in a bygone time, its lyrical themes date it firmly in the present. But it's a present that exists conditionally, always battling against the black hole suction of the past, as befits a fortysomething band obsessed with youth. <em>Hair</em> finds Imperial Teen in full-bore navel gazing mode, talking both obliquely and directly about where they are and, more importantly, how they got there. On the latter score, they seem mostly mystified, not bitter-- Imperial Teen don't go for self-pity.
    </p>
<p>
    The album's title is a précis of how the band members have spent the time between 2002's <em>On</em> and now. Roddy Bottum's been composing music for film and television; Jone Stebbins ran a hairstyling business; Lynn Truell (formerly Perko) has been popping out kids; Will Schwartz worked on his own band, Hey Willpower. The song ""Baby and the Band"" is one of the handful of unpleasantly precious tracks, but it's crucial to the album's theme. ""Wake on the shores of a distant land,"" goes a the most telling refrain, ""the hair, the TV, the baby and the band."" This land is adulthood, and Imperial Teen seem astonished to find themselves there. 
    </p>
<p>
    Such ruminations flare up throughout the album. ""Do It Better"" is a sweet indie pop swooner leavened by a crunchy rock chorus, and one of the more overtly elegiac songs on the album-- ""Got a watch that's made of gold/ But I think it's getting old""-- along with the whizzing, sultry fuzz-stomper ""Shim Sham"", a heyday revival with a distorto-oh-oh chorus: ""Now and then seems like a different scene."" And ""Room with a View"" lays it all on the line: ""We're working so hard/ And we're betting the farm/ Charge it all to the card..."" Bottum and co. are trying hard to ""pretend we'll be twenty for life,"" and this is a point where other bands might turn depressive. But Imperial Teen aren't cowed by the determinism of age: According to ""One Two"", a harmony-laden fuzz buzz that repeatedly crash lands and lifts off again, at least one band member ""hasn't finished sleeping around."" 
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Hair the TV the Baby and the Band</em> sometimes steps out of this introspective mode. ""It's Now"" is a winner, bouncing back and forth between a shuffle and a crunch, with great slice-of-life lyrics in Belle and Sebastian's fey style: ""You've got mirrors on the ceiling/ You're serving Darjeeling/ And your art nouveau seems so logical to me."" Opening track ""Everything"" is less charming; its cascading guitars and hammy lyrical conceit (""Everything  _____,"" from ""judicious"" to ""hypocrisy,"" over and over) make it overbearing. But maybe that's beside the point-- after all, being who you are, silly or otherwise, is the privilege of adulthood. If the album's self-indulgent moments aren't satisfying, at least they feel hard-earned.

It feels important, this moment, to the extent that any pinpoint coalescence of a new phase in a random indie band's musical development can be. Where before one sensed that for Piano Magic the song was simply a framework notion in which other, perhaps more interesting things could be achieved, on the gentle ""The Unwritten Law"" it's like the two levels, sound and song, merged and became indistinguishable: For better or worse, Piano Magic were now songwriters, rock performers.</p><p>
    And yet, even though it was done with a typically measured grace, Piano Magic's transformation from their original status as Glen Johnson's revolving-door avant-indie ""project"" into a full-fledged rock band still surprises, and perplexes a bit, four years on. Perhaps it's simply that, whatever story it was that earlier, amorphous pieces such as ""I Am the Sub-Librarian"" were meant to be telling, it surely couldn't end in glove-sniffing guitar dynamics. But here we are with <em>Part-Monster</em>, the group's loudest and most straightforwardly songful effort yet. For the first time, a new album from Piano Magic heralds no new stylistic shifts (even 2005's <em>Disaffected</em> included a few winsome homages to Be Music's electro-pop), instead building on the controlled riffs and moody post-punk songforms that dominated <em>Disaffected</em>, interspersing them with quiet moments that could come from any stage of the group's evolution.</p><p>
    It would make sense for the group's embrace of post-punk revivalism to recall the chilly sparseness of Joy Division or Wire circa <em>154</em>, but instead <em>Part-Monster</em>'s rock songs are voluptuously thick, coloured in with ethereal keyboards but giving full reign to a guitar sound whose fuzzy raggedness recalls The Cure and The Comsat Angels in its baroque prettiness and ember-like smoulder. This thickness works admirably: the arrangements on the throbbing album owner ""The Last Engineer"" or the careening ""Great Escapes"" are vast and stormy enough to add a certain grandeur to Johnson's plaintively murmured apocalyptic visions. It's on the sprinkling of softer tracks that Johnson's camp miserablism (in the Morrissey sense) becomes wearisome: ""England's Always Better (As You're Pulling Away)"", sounds exactly as you'd expect, its melodramatic melancholy only saved by a charmingly dolorous extended detour into a spoken word piece courtesy of The Bitter Springs' Simon Rivers, over a funereal horn arrangement kidnapped from old Mogwai records (it's better than that makes it sound though). No such luck for the acoustic whimpers of the title track, which offers no relief from Johnson's carefully staged self-pity.</p><p>
    Perhaps Johnson's art is more compelling when he keeps it at arm's length from himself, giving breath to an idea of something (or someone) else else rather than infusing the song with his own persona. <em>Part-Monster</em> works best when he lets his guitars speak for him, or when he shares around vocal duties: David-Guillou's shimmering, partly electronic ""Soldier Song"" harks back to the antiquarian stiffness of <em>Artists' Rifles</em>, and is a powerful reminder that Johnson's songs are often best performed as if staring through a window at something occurring off-stage, their chilly reserve giving shape to some emotional content by carefully observing and tracing its outline.<br/>
<em><br/>
    Part-Monster</em>'s mild drop-off relative to its preceding albums is not yet cause for concern: Piano Magic have stumbled before, only to right themselves marvellously. It's arguable, in fact, that there's no drop-off at all: Song-for-song this is as strong as they've ever been. But there's a nagging sense that they may finally have tiptoed into redundancy, that the noise and motion of this album is designed to conceal either a failure to find new ideas or complacency about searching in the first place. Perhaps I'm simply concerned that ""a strong collection of new songs"" is all that the new Piano Magic have to offer these days: it's an idea the old Piano Magic probably would have scorned.</p></div>"|10543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10543-part-monster/|6.2|Tim Finney

    The members of the High Strung don't seem content with just being a rock band-- they seem to want to be a legendary rock band. They've made a habit over the years of touring public libraries, and pointedly drove their bus onto the steps of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and left it as though it were an exhibit. It's a novel idea. After all, why work and booze and drug your way into rock history when you can simply drive there?</p><p>
<em>Get the Guests</em> is the band's third album, their second since co-vocalist Mark Owen left in 2004, and their best to date. The garage rock roughness that characterized their early work as a quartet still pops up here and there, but as a trio they've turned into something different, more of a ragged power pop band than anything. They've chosen to work again with producer Jim Diamond, who's also recorded the White Stripes and the Electric Six, and he keeps the sound raw even as the band honeys up its melodies and writes more nuanced songs. It's a juxtaposition that supplies a lot of the album's tension, but also robs certain moments of the sweetness they might otherwise possess.</p><p>
    Last year, Canadian power pop veterans Sloan discovered with  <em>Never Hear the End of It </em>that you can simply jump ship when a song has done what it needs to do, no matter how much time has passed. The result was their best album since the 1990s. The High Strung seem to be in the midst of learning this same lesson-- there are seventeen tracks on this album, most under three minutes. This is a mixed blessing. It ensures a certain amount of variety and forces them to keep most of the songs well within sensible time constraints, but it also makes it harder to get involved with individual songs right away because you're being hit with so much at once. So the tracks that don't end when they need to stand out for the wrong reasons.
    </p>
<p>
    Guitarist Josh Malerman has a strange voice-- high and extremely nasal, it's an instrument I can see some people reacting sharply against. But it works on most of these songs. He sounds especially good when he hangs a melody in the middle of his range, as on ""There Was No One Before You, There Was No One Before Me"", where he's doubled in the mix singing slow phrases over a quick, steady rhythm. He's at his sharpest on perhaps the album's best song, opener ""What a Meddler!"", which has pretty much everything a great pop song should: a drum part that shifts to reflect the sentiment in the lyrics, a grabbing instrumental hook played on horns, and a great melody that tumbles and bends around well-formed lines like ""Gossip for some is a real event/ They strap on and button up their Sunday best.""
    </p>
<p>
    At their best, these guys make instantly memorable music, such as on ""Maybe You're Coming Down With It"", which intertwines Chad Stocker's melodic bass line and the verse vocal around a one-note guitar part, or ""Childhood"", which changes up the band's formula for a ballad with nothing but voice, organ, and acoustic guitar. ""I believe in childhood/ I believe it still exists,"" sings Malerman in a wistful tone that suggests he's maybe not so sure. It almost has the same effect as REM's <em>Automatic for the People</em> ballad ""Sweetness Follows"" in terms of how it fits on the album.
    </p>
<p>
    At their worst, the High Strung try to cram psych-tinged instrumental breaks into songs that don't have room for them. ""He's Got No Soul"" needs to die after two minutes, but instead goes off on a bland, pounding tangent dominating by an excessive, unshapely guitar solo. These bits crop up on several songs-- a bit of sax chaos here, a bashing bridge there-- but they're never quite enough to sink the whole enterprise.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Get the Guests</em> isn't perfect, but it's enjoyable and at its peaks is flat-out great. The High Strung have their sound, and have their funky little history. At this point, it's mostly a matter of refining, streamlining, and finding a greater degree of consistency.<br/>

    Oh, you little devil, you. Chill man, we're not derogatorily speaking of the diminutive devilman Glenn Danzig, but rather those ""little devil"" triads that so cleverly, in a poof of brimstone, seem to magically appear any time a dark-leaning rock and/or metal artist churns out a diabolical jam. Ever since Tony Iommi branded the world with his ominous tritone three-note riff at the front of the Satan-summoning ""Black Sabbath"", you find those same ""evil sounding"" progressions all throughout the bedrock of heavy-metal-- and quite notably sprinkled all about the pop-metal arcana of Danzig.</p><p>
    Glenn Danzig needs no introduction, the dude is legend: From his origins as the devil-locked Undead Elvis frontman for the Misfits and Samhain up through his blues-metal, hellish comic book romps under his given name, the dude has been the one-man soundtrack to outsider-teen angst and cartoon occult flirtations for three decades. One explanation for his durability may be that the sixteen-year-old brain responds obediently to demon and devil talk. This new double album features a collection of lost tracks and outtakes-- or tracks that Glenn felt didn't fit thematically-- from throughout his entire career: From his classic first four strobe-lit, stripper-pole grinding, titanium-blues strutting albums, through his mid-to-late 90s missteps into industrial and electronica territories, all the various styles are represented-- warts and all.</p><p>
    The warts would be OK, if there just weren't so many of 'em. A carefully chosen single album that would've had the devil-locked denizens drooling 'til the cracking of the seventh seal winds up being a flabby, overstuffed warehouse of unnecessary not-as-good-as-the-original tunes. Those who worship epic fist-pumping headbangers like ""Twist of Cain"", ""Her Black Wings"", ""Brand New God"", and ""Dirty Black Summer"" from the first four records will experience ear-to-ear-smiling déjà vu when they hear previously-unreleased counterparts such as the awesome boogie bashin' ""Pain Is Like An Animal"" or the killer dirgey, blues-y swaying ""When Death Had No Name"". 
    </p>
<p>
    But when a bloated cavalcade of PVC corset/meshed half-shirt/Herman Munster-boot wearing goth-metal-industrial whatzits sizzle past, followed by the useless cover of Bowie's ""Cat People"", one might be fully bummed if they'd paid the full cover charge. Thankfully, a few Zeppelin-y, classic Danzig bluesy ballads (""Dying Seraph"" and ""Crawl Across Your Killing Floor""), a groovin' T-Rex cover (""Buick Mackane""), and a catchy dark-pop tune called ""Warlok"" help split the difference between the great and the stinky. Overall, a good argument for iTunes. But seriously, the keepers are down right essential!</p></div>"|10539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10539-the-lost-tracks-of-danzig/|7.0|D. Shawn Bosler

    Even when they were scrappy newcomers from a town no one in rap cared about, UGK's Bun B and Pimp C sounded like wizened old veterans. Pimp's beats were slow, organic country-funk instrumentals; they could've passed for Stax backing tracks if they didn't have so much bass. Bun's matter-of-fact, virtuoso, baritone flow exuded weariness and authority. Fifteen years later, the Texas duo sound like eternal, immovable features on rap's landscape, and their style has hardened into a blueprint; an album like T.I.'s <em>Trap Muzik</em>, say, would've been near-unthinkable without UGK's precedent.</p><p>
    But it's been a while since we've heard from UGK. <em>Dirty Money</em>, their last album, came out in 2001. Since that time, Pimp spent four years in prison for violating his probation on an aggravated assault charge. During Pimp's imprisonment, the South became rap's dominant region, and Bun kept the group's name alive by going on an absolute guest-appearance tear, popping up on tracks with virtually every major rapper working. Even after Pimp's release, UGK's label pushed back the release of this album for nearly a year. And so now the album's release makes for a weirdly bittersweet moment: <em>Underground Kingz</em> is an equally frustrated and vindicated album. Pimp hasn't forgotten what it was like to rot in a cell while his region exploded, and Bun hasn't forgotten that he had to keep his group above water by himself. Neither has forgotten a decade-and-a-half of record-label drama and elusive success, and neither seems particularly happy with a rap climate that they helped to shape. On album opener ""Swishas &amp; Dosha"", Pimp sneers at his successors: ""I remember when a rapper was a go-getter/ Now all these rappers is some ho niggas."" Bun agrees: ""You MySpacing and Facebooking, playing games with them toys/ I'm in the streets where gangstas meet while you online with them boys.""</p><p>
    Throughout <em>Underground Kingz</em>, Pimp and Bun wield their legacy like a club. They repurpose two rap classics, Too Short's ""Life Is...Too Short"" and Scarface's ""The Fix"" on ""Life Is 2009"" and ""Still Ridin Dirty"", songs that feature Too Short and Scarface, respectively. (The latter doesn't rap; he just shows up singing histrionic fake-gospel on the hook. It's awesome.) Other rap legends show up as well: Geto Boys bulldog Willie D snaps at region-dismissers on ""Quit Hatin' the South"". Houston depressive Z-Ro waxes elegiac on ""Trill Niggas Don't Die"". Big Daddy Kane and Kool G Rap, both old-school New York royalty, spit weathered threats all over Marley Marl's hard, simple track on ""Next Up"", and Pimp and (especially) Bun sound perfectly at-home alongside them. Most transcendently, the two trade verses with another legendary Southern duo, Outkast, on the gorgeous single ""Int'l Players Anthem"". Three 6 Mafia's DJ Paul and Juicy J throw enormous drums under a joyous loop of Willie Hutch's classic blaxploitation ballad ""I Choose You"", and Andre 3000's tender, lovestruck verse perfectly offsets Pimp C's megaton sneer. ""Int'l Players Anthem"" finds UGK in an uncharacteristically euphoric mood, and it just might by my favorite song of the year.</p><p>
    Most of <em>Underground Kingz</em>, though, is anything but upbeat. It's the first UGK album where Pimp doesn't handle the lion's share of the production, though most of the album's producers make sure to make their tracks fit the slow, woozy aesthetic that the duo established long ago. On ""Cocaine"", the Blackout Movement curl blues-guitar around minimal drum-thumps while Pimp moans the title over and over on the chorus and Bun gives a quick lesson in the drug's history: ""It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich/ They even used to put it in Coca-Cola; ain't that a bitch?"" On ""Two Types of Bitches"", Momo's nasty blues-guitar and blurting organs lazily circle each other while guest Dizzee Rascal turns up to spit some paranoid misogyny. Elsewhere, the duo absorbs the newer trends in Southern rap, showing the kids how to attack them: Lil Jon's jacked-up bass on ""Like That"", the Runners' epic synth-churn on ""Take tha Hood Back"".
    </p>
<p>
    The album really hits its stride, though, when Pimp takes over the controls and brings back the sad, heavy country-rap that he does better than anyone else. ""The Game Belongs to Me"" is an irrefutable declaration of supremacy, so warm and effortless that Bun and Pimp's voices sound like they're bubbling up from the track. ""How Long Can It Last"" winds seven minutes of emotional self-torture around screaming blues-guitars and gut-rumbling bass. Even a song as formulaic as ""Chrome Plated Woman"", which works the ancient car-as-girl concept, is executed with masterly panache.</p><p>
    The two discs of <em>Underground Kingz</em> run well over two hours, and plenty of fat could easily have been trimmed. Nobody needs another two tinny synth-beats from Jazze Pha, to say nothing of the man's abysmal verse on ""Stop-N-Go"". The warm sentiment of ""Real Women"" is much-appreciated after the bile of ""Two Types of Bitches,"" the lite-jazz Fender Rhodes less so. As great as ""Int'l Players Anthem"" is, the album would be fine without its two remixes; the ugly screwed-and-chopped version practically kills the album's momentum right at the end. Still, these aren't complaints; they're quibbles. <em>Underground Kingz</em> is the first UGK album in six years, and it's just an enormous relief to hear that these two can still weave a cohesive long-form tapestry of an album better than almost anyone else in rap.

That's disappointing, in a way: The Seattle band might have released something awful instead of this exercise in competency. They have the potential to make some interesting mistakes, and a weighed risk might have produced something amazing. Instead <em>Planet of Ice</em> is better than its predecessor, <em>Menos el Oso</em>, but only slightly so.</p><p>
    Let the title fool you: The most striking thing here is how serious the band has become since its days of song titles such as ""Thanks for the Killer Game of Crisco® Twister"". They're still likable guys, but they've gone moody. The tone is ominous, particularl ""Burying the Luck"", when Jake Snider sings about feverish dreams and ends on foreboding questions (""Will his hands know what mine did?/ Will your body like the fit?""). Words like these need tension. The band responds with athletic arrangements that mimic the first-person action. On love/sex song ""White Mystery"", guitars crash around the line ""lay under bright lights,"" announcing release to the song's sexual encounter, breaking from quieter passages of observation.</p><p>
    The title ""Part 2"" seems like it's announcing a clear break in the album, but it's a red herring and doesn't mark any thematic or sonic turns. Instead, Minus the Bear sound adrift, in a good way-- their directionlessness opens some much-needed breathing room. On an album that's too on-message, ""Part 2""'s instrumental swathes expand and contract just right. They return to the program on ""Throwing Shapes"", though Alex Rose wedges some bubbly, squirming synthesizer into their full instrumental mix. Here Snider sings about a girl getting more ""passionate,"" but he doesn't inject any of his own passion here, or anywhere else, really. His voice is smooth but bland, covering the already-slick production with an impenetrable patina that closes off the song to the possibility of the sort of emotional resonance that they want to make. Snider should steel his jaw a little more, or maybe loosen it. These are funny guys, and that shouldn't be sacrificed for ""growth"" or ""maturity."" ""I'm becoming a casual business man/ On matters of the heart,"" he intones on ""Dr. L'Ling"". He could have just as easily said ""scientist""-- some of the encounters on <em>Planet of Ice</em> are written in second person, but even in first person these mathematical songs feel detached and observational.
    </p><p>
    Is this what they want? On ""Ice Monster"", Snider sings about craving ""safety"" so he can stop ""knocking on wood."" Then the track demonstrates so: The band tries to slip into prog territory, but it never sacrifices musicality for technical display, and its melodies stay intact. But even on this side of prog, those passages can feel inhibited, modulating aimlessly and petering out. It's on this song that their sense of humor disappears most completely, and the song's two second-handclap part (the one part that sounds like it was made by humans) is too good and over too fast.

Some ventured above ground (Pavement, Sebadoh), some followed unbeaten paths (Sun City Girls, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282), and some ended up frozen in time (Trumans Water, Fly Ashtray). A rare few left behind music that remains inextricably tied to the era, yet is somehow transcendent too.</p><p>
    Virginia's Wingtip Sloat were that kind of band. Their brainy brand of indie/punk/grunge/math, married as it was to pre-computer recording and pre-dot-com slackdom, could only have happened in the early 90s. Yet it sounds uncannily fresh today, as if high-rises and strip malls shot up around the group's basement studio without tarnishing the beer-drenched walls and tobacco-stained bathroom, leaving their fantastic sound echoing there, perfectly preserved and surprisingly undated. You can hear that decently on the band's two later albums, 1995's <em>Chewyfoot</em> and 1998's <em>If Only For the Hatchery</em>. But the most convincing proof has up to now gathered dust on early, out-of-print 7""'s and cassettes.</p><p>
<em>Add This to Rhetoric</em> collects those artifacts, forging a kind of living, sweating time capsule. As for what it actually sounds like, that's best left to Sloat's Patrick Foster, who in his liner notes calls the perfectly-titled ""I Wish I'd Been There to Make It a Cliché"" the prototypical Sloat song. ""It's all there,"" he rightly boasts. ""Arch/true/ironic song title, stop-start nervous discharge, chaos, self-referencing lyrics, kick-axe drumming, a gut-punching bass, a guitar hanging on for dear life and a ridiculous coda that even made us laugh most of the time."" To which I'd add a proggy use of shifting tempos, an affinity for overlapping vocals, and a snarling energy more openly indebted to punk than anything Pavement would've ever copped to.</p><p>
    Otherwise, Wingtip Sloat and Pavement's influences were pretty similar, from the Velvet Underground across to the Fall and Wire and up through the Swell Maps, the Clean and Tall Dwarfs. But in contrast to Pavement's sly dodges, Wingtip Sloat owned up to their borrowings. Hence the inclusion here of their irresistible takes on the Swell Maps' ""Read About Seymour"", the Clean's ""Anything Could Happen"", Tall Dwarfs' ""Beauty"", and, in a nice show of team loyalty, Sun City Girls' drunken ""Kill the Klansmen"".</p><p>
    But Wingtip Sloat's originals burn most brightly through the haze of intervening years. Their 1991 debut 7"", which opens the album, is basically perfect, four tracks full of rhythmic turns, spilling guitars, and savvy vocals. Sloat followed that up in 1992 with a 12-track double 7"". Here the band's manic three-minute songs sit snugly next to one-minute toss-offs, much the way a stoned conversation turns profound musings and fleeting babble into sides of the same coin. (Such wordplay was a skill the group honed through their ""pre-blog post-punk racing form"" <em>Sweet Portable You</em>, which printed stories, rants, and other oblique ramblings under the guise of record reviews).</p><p>
    The rest of <em>Add This to Rhetoric </em>doesn't quite hit the same highs, but it's never less than compelling. The band continually finds the kind of mini-epiphanies that can only come from basement music made outside the sterilizing light of pro studios and promo budgets. That effect is summed perfectly by the album's back cover, a track listing made simply by piling up the individual, hand-decorated cassettes each song was recorded on. It's enough to transport you back to a time when cassettes and handwriting still mattered. But <em>Add This to Rhetoric </em>is no nostalgic reverie; it's less like faded ink than wet paint, still dripping with vivid sounds and ideas.<br/></p></div>"|10504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10504-add-this-to-rhetoric/|8.3|Marc Masters

    The work of Sacramento-based composer and musician Christian Kiefer has covered more musical and human geography in just the past couple of years than more land-locked artists might see in a lifetime. In 2006, Kiefer released <em>Czar Nicholas Is Dead</em>, an album-length meditation on the 1918 assassination of Russia's Czar Nicholas Romanov, as well as <em>The Black Dove</em>, a collection of more folk-based material with UK singer Sharron Kraus. Earlier this year, Kiefer began another fruitful collaboration with Charalambides' Tom Carter, and the duo released <em>A Rather Solemn Promise</em>, a set of spectral blues instrumentals. In each case, Kiefer has shown an uncanny ability to fully engage the character of his various collaborators while maintaining a distinctive voice of his own.</p><p>
    Kiefer's latest album <em>Dogs &amp; Donkeys</em> might be his most ambitious and accessible work to date, and boasts another impressive roster of guest musicians. The album includes extended appearances by Wilco's Nels Cline, Low's Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker, and the Band's Garth Hudson (!), and none of their expert contributions are wasted. The influence of Sparhawk and Parker, in particular, seems to have rubbed off on Kiefer, as several of the pieces here attain something of the atmospheric, slow-pulse intensity of Low's early records, refracted through the dusky Americana of such previous Kiefer albums as 2003's <em>Medicine Show</em> or 2000's <em>Welcome to Hard Times</em>.</p><p>
    With a Ph.D. in literature, Kiefer has always been prone to compose his albums around a single prolonged narrative, and <em>Dogs &amp; Donkeys</em> is no exception. In fact, these 13 songs simultaneously interweave two distinct narratives, drawing inspiration from novelist Saul Bellow, poets T.S. Eliot and James Wright, and an assortment of economics texts. (This is one of the few albums I can think of that comes handily equipped with a bibliography.) Unlike the relatively straightforward narratives of <em>Czar Nicholas</em> or <em>The Black Dove</em>, however, the basic plot of <em>Dogs &amp; Donkeys</em> is oblique enough that even careful listeners might not fully realize it is there, nor will that fact necessarily ruin the album for anybody. Yet like his previous work, <em>Dogs &amp; Donkeys</em> portrays characters caught up by forces-be they historical, romantic, or in this case, economic-quite outside their full control, and the ensuing, frequently tragic aftermath. 
    </p>
<p>
    Kiefer sets his two separate scenes on two exquisite early tracks; the deceptive ""Pretty White Clouds"" is all sunny surfaces and Jayhawks harmonies, while the impoverished protagonists of ""The Lovers"" hunker down in tougher circumstances, hoping to ride things out surrounded by ""seven bridges over seven muddy rivers."" Before the listener is able to get too much further in this plot, however, Nels Cline makes his electrifying entrance on the pivotal ""Economic Theory"", his guitar reducing the quiet scenery to splinters. 
    </p>
<p>
    From that point on, Kiefer and company ably mirror his characters' shifting fortunes with their fitful, dramatic music. The joined voices of Sparhawk and Parker help make ""Coronation Day"" a hypnotic standout, while Garth Hudson lends his unmistakable accordion to ""Fisher King"", which draws heavily from Eliot's <em>The Wasteland</em> as Kiefer delivers what is almost surely his most impassioned vocal on record. And though Kiefer falls short of spelling out the exact fates of his characters, all those bridges and rivers seem to have an almost unshakable pull, and the defeated cries of ""Lie Still"" and ""Slow Rivers"" point to an unhappy ending at the water's edge. The finer details of its narrative notwithstanding, <em>Dogs &amp; Donkeys</em> again shows Kiefer's willingness to tackle wide-scale, novelistic themes, and to do so with an uncommonly sympathetic ear pitched towards both his material and his collaborators.

Some of this comes from the variety of     topics the band sings about, including being     stoned, getting stoned, not having the drugs one would use to get     stoned and, naturally, Pop Tarts.  The less frenetic approach the     group takes in zipping through their two-minute songs also helps.  But     this vibe starts and ends with the can't-get-out-of-bed croaking of     guitarist/vocalist Jonas Stein.</p>
<p>When     he's excited (like on the spastic album opener, ""No Drugs To Use""),     Stein sounds like a hoarse Henry Rollins.  When he's feeling mellow     (as on the proto-grunge ""Volcano""), a hint of Mark Arm's     cultivated ennui creeps into his voice.  And when he reaches for     those high notes, he sounds like he should've known better.      Regardless of whether he's shouting about the Iraqi conflict (""Fight     This!""), getting the ""I just want to be friends"" talk (""20th     I Was Blue""), or pitching woo to a Devo girl (in the song with the     same name), Stein exudes an anti-charismatic charm that's just as     appealing as the spastic screaming of BYOP's Jemina Pearl.</p>
<p>While     Stein's frenetic guitar playing is usually more in line with Pearl's     antics, on this record he strikes a pose more befitting his own vocal     tact.  There's still a fair amount of thrashing and slashing to be     had, but it's abetted by some unexpected turns towards more     traditional rocking and rolling.  Compared to everything else on the     album, the twangy strumming in ""The Run Around"" practically     makes the song a country standard (and perfectly fits the song's     ""Girl, don't treat me bad"" / ""Girl, why don't you treat me bad""     narrative).  ""The Ballad"" and ""Pocket Full of Thistles"" are     less successful takes on this rootsier turn, but the tracks are so     short and spry it doesn't matter.  ""The Ballad"" is one of only     three tracks that makes it past the three minute mark, and with     drummer John Eatherly doing his best approximation of Animal, the     album just flies right by.   So if you're down with thirty-plus     minutes of three dudes dropping trou and lighting farts on fire in a     garage rock fashion, <i>Turbo Fruits</i> is definitely     for you.</p></div>"|10524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10524-turbo-fruits/|6.3|David Raposa

    In many ways, 1967 was year zero for the world we live in
    today. From Detroit to Nigeria to Jerusalem
    to Paris to Southeast Asia,
    it was a year of cataclysms and upheaval. Dozens of American cities burned that
    summer, the
    United States of America lost more than 11,000 soldiers in Vietnam, the draft was in
    full force, and protestors showed up at the Pentagon in October, chanting ""Hey,
    hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?"" Israel
    seized the West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan Heights in the Six Days' War, and we're still reading
    the consequences in headlines every day.</p><p>
    It was the year that most fully embodied what we think of
    today when we say ""the 60s."" It can be represented by a photo of a hippie
    dancing to the music in his head on the San Francisco Presidio during the
    Summer of Love, or a photo of an F-105 Thunderchief unloading bombs on North
    Vietnam, of Hendrix kneeling over a burning guitar at Monterey Pop, of race
    riots and fire hoses, of corpses in Biafra, of flowers in gun barrels, of the
    Beatles in their <em>Sgt. Pepper's</em> costumes. It could be a lithographed swirl of
    color that on closer inspection informs you that the Grateful Dead and five
    other bands will be playing at the Fillmore West on Saturday. Pop music changed
    that year, the trickle of new ideas that cropped up in the mid-60s growing to a
    flood. 1967 saw <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
    Hearts' Club Band, Piper at the Gate of Dawn, The Doors,
    Velvet Underground &amp; Nico, Are You Experienced?</em>, ""Cold Sweat"", and dozens of other
    records that were filled with sounds no one had heard or even imagined before.</p><p>
    Funny, I didn't mention Motown or anything affiliated with
    it there, did I? The label was in some ways unequipped for 1967 when the year
    came along. The world was exploding around it-- in July of that year, 2,000
    buildings burned to the ground in Detroit
    during the 12<sup>th</sup> Street
    riot. Forty-three people died and more than 7,000 were arrested. The National Guard and
    the 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne were sent in to bring some semblance of order back
    to the city. The 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne kept its weapons unloaded, but the
    Guard units didn't, with predictable results. For the first time since
    1959, Hitsville, U.S.A., was quiet. 
    </p>
<p>
    Berry Gordy's operating philosophy had always been to create
    a disciplined environment in which creativity could thrive, and part of
    creating that environment meant that Motown was essentially an
    around-the-clock, 24-7 operation. There was almost never a time when something
    wasn't happening in the Snake Pit studio or one of the ever-growing number of cubbyholes that passed for offices in the Hitsville complex. But
    during the riots, the studio and offices closed for six whole days. As with the
    automobile factories that by this time had mostly moved out of the Motor City
    limits to the Detroit
    suburbs, lost days meant lost productivity, which meant a financial hit as
    well. 
    </p>
<p>
    Given the context, it's something to listen to the music
    that the company produced that year. <a href=""http://www.hip-oselect.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Hip-O Select</strong></a>'s ongoing series of
    comprehensive singles collections gathers all the released A- and B-sides, as well as a
    few that were scheduled for release but never pressed. Where earlier
    volumes were liberally sprinkled with musical outliers, this one is almost
    terrifyingly focused on the Motown Sound, a certifiable and unmistakable
    aesthetic for a couple of years by this point. The music and lyrics seem oddly immune to the global paroxysm that everyone at Motown was fully aware
    of-- these aren't songs of protest. They're songs of longing and love and love
    lost that come from a wholesome America
    that never existed. And people bought most of them in droves.
    </p>
<p>
    It's blindingly obvious why people bought and loved and
    danced to these songs, but I'll say it anyway: They're great songs, social
    context be damned. The sophistication of the arrangements, the voices, the
    rhythms, the big, open sound, the lyrics that anyone can understand and get
    behind-- this is why Motown, a black company in a blindingly white world,
    originally crashed the pop charts, and all of this is what kept them there even
    as everything else changed. Partly thanks to Motown, by 1967, anything could
    hit the pop charts, and just about any kind of thing you could imagine did, by
    artists of all races. 
    </p>
<p>
    The label's biggest act, the Supremes, opened the year smack
    in the middle of a run of four straight number one singles, and the
    Holland-Dozier-Holland production and writing team was so deep in its groove
    that they could essentially do no wrong. Everything they wrote at this point
    was great, and little innovations spilled into songs seemingly as a matter of
    course. The closest Motown got to psychedelia that year was an H-D-H job for
    the Supremes: The sublime ""Reflections"", which opens with a few whirs from a
    tone generator before sliding into its tambourine-augmented beat. The lyrics
    are a kaleidoscope of reflections: memories, regrets, and literal reflections in
    teardrops, mirrors and window panes.
    </p>
<p>
    H-D-H also had the Four Tops firing on all cylinders in 67.
    ""Bernadette"" is nearly unbelievable, with Levi Stubbs' crazed, heavily
    syncopated vocal falling everywhere you expect it not to, and its B-side is an
    amazing Northern stomper called ""I Got a Feeling"" that could stop a
    mod's heart in mid-beat. Later in the set, another Tops B-side, ""I'll Turn to
    Stone"", actually outdoes it for sheer, wonderful danceability. But if the music
    was hot, the H-D-H team's relationship with Berry Gordy was hotter. They, the
    three men arguably most responsible for developing the true, signature Motown
    Sound, felt their compensation wasn't commensurate with their contribution, and
    they left Hitsville to form the Hot Wax and Invictus labels that year.
    </p>
<p>
    Several other familiar faces were out the door by the end of
    the year as well. Mickey Stevenson, Kim Weston, and Clarence
    Paul, some of whom had been there since the beginning, all left. The Contours
    made their last recording for the label, with Dennis Edwards on lead vocals,
    passing through the group's ranks on his way to taking David Ruffin's place in
    the Temptations the following year. Flo Ballard was edged out of the Supremes
    in favor of Cindy Birdsong, and by the end of the year they were officially
    Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes. 
    </p>
<p>
    Where Lamont Dozier and the Holland brothers created a vacuum, Norman
    Whitfield moved quickly to fill it. He was using the Temptations as his
    personal laboratory with fantastic results. He kicked up the tempo on ""All I
    Need"", a rocket made of harmony, brought in majestic strings on the fluttering
    slow-burner ""You're My Everything"" and made one of pop music's all-time sad
    masterpieces in ""I Wish it Would Rain"". On the latter, Ruffin takes the genuine
    anguish of Rodger Penzabene's lyrics and gives them the delivery they deserve-- rough,
    wounded and fragile. Penzabene, who lived that song every day, took his own
    life soon after the single was released. Whitfield, along with frequent
    co-writer Barrett Strong, was also responsible for ""I Heard It Through the
    Grapevine"", recorded by Marvin Gaye early in the year. This version was shelved
    by Berry Gordy, though, and Whitfield took it to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips,
    who in turn took it to #2 pop, #1 r&amp;b. 
    </p>
<p>
    Also stepping in to fill the production vacuum were
    newcomers Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. The two clearly understood the
    Motown aesthetic, but they brought their own spin to it, a spin that was
    perfect for the dueting talents of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. In 1967, they
    gave Gaye and Terrell two of the most powerful duets in pop history: ""Ain't No
    Mountain High Enough"" and ""Your Precious Love"". The seamless blend of the two
    voices and the effortless smoothness of the Ashford/Simpson production combined
    to make something magical, but it wasn't to last: Terrell collapsed into Gaye's
    arms at a concert and wound up in a hospital, diagnosed with a  brain tumor that would ultimately take her
    life in 1970 at the age of 24. 
    </p>
<p>
    Others came to the label in different ways. Edwin Starr, a
    bona fide hitmaker, ended up on the roster when Gordy bought Ric-Tic, the label
    Starr was signed to. It took a couple of years for Motown to fully tap Starr's
    potential, but his debut for the Gordy imprint, ""I Want My Baby Back"", was
    spectacular even if it wasn't a hit. As much as the label had finally found
    true focus, there were still a few anomalies. The Underdogs, a raw, talented
    garage rock band, lead off the entire set with ""Love's Gone Bad"", easily the
    roughest, toughest rock track the label had put out to that point. Some of the
    Funk Brothers, including bassist James Jamerson, are on the track, but you
    wouldn't guess that from the sound of it-singer Dave Whitehouse's powerful lead
    is backed by a thrashing beat that's different from anything else here.
    </p>
<p>
    Other musical tangents are tamer. Gordy was still messing
    around with crooners Billy Eckstine and Barbara McNair, though neither ever
    went anywhere on his label. The Messengers were kind of a jangly pop-rock band
    in a West Coast vein-oddly, the b-side of their single was the first recording
    of the Ashford &amp; Simpson classic ""California Soul"", much-covered by Motown
    artists in the coming years. The Messengers' A-side was written by R. Dean
    Taylor, who had released perhaps Motown's greatest rock song, ""There's a Ghost
    in My House"", earlier in 67. That song has a relentless rhythm track, some
    perfectly placed fuzz guitar and a suitably frantic, haunted vocal. 
    </p>
<p>
    Several Motown mainstays quietly had good years. Smokey
    Robinson &amp; the Miracles' ""I Second That Emotion"" is practically weightless,
    while Stevie Wonder wills himself off the ground on ""I Was Made to Love Her""
    and the great, levitating B-side ""Hey Love"". Brenda Holloway cut the original
    version of ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"", but it pales next to ""Just Look What
    You've Done"", which may have the fastest tempo on the set but still
    features a poised and powerful vocal. 
    </p>
<p>
    The year 1967 was Muhammed Ali refusing to serve after being drafted,
    acid in San Francisco,
    400 million viewers around the world tuning in via satellite as the Beatles
    performed ""All You Need Is Love"", and Thurgood Marshall taking his seat as the
    first African-American on the Supreme Court, a court that had just ruled state
    laws prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional. It was Operation <em>Rolling Thunder</em> and the Six Days' War
    and Biafra and student demonstration time. But
    it was also Martha &amp; the Vandellas in vinyl skirts with mod designs on the
    front, the dignified sadness of Roger Penzabene, the amazing sound of Tammi
    Terrell's voice blended with Marvin Gaye's, Uriel Jones and Pistol Allen on the
    drum kit, James Jamerson on the bass and a few dozen perfect melodies offered
    up by a gathering of talent quite unlike anything assembled before or since.
    You'd never guess 1967 was Motown's year until you listen to the year Motown
    had in 1967. The music is hard to beat.

    A couple of years back, nobody had an inkling our favorite drone duo would become <em>Artforum</em> regulars. Yet <em>Black One</em>, Sunn O)))'s crowning achievement, initiated a fascinating crossover, and Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley's subsequent stream of releases-- both Sunn O))) and non-- along with O'Malley's ongoing art and theatre collaborations, solidified and extended things beyond the influence of a <em>New York Times Magazine</em> piece. (The 2005 album also provided U.S. black metal ""outfits"" Xasthur and
    Leviathan/Lurker of Chalice with their biggest audience to date, leading to a number of other, very different tremors in the
    underground. Note, for instance, that Xasthur's forthcoming <em>Defective Epitaph</em> will be Malefic's second for Hydra Head.)</p><p>
    Of all of Sunn O)))'s work with visual artists, the most important and ongoing is O'Malley's collaborations with ""bad boy"" NYC sculptor Banks Violette, which recently culminated, for the time at least, in concurrent shows at Team and Gladstone galleries. Pretty big deal. A precursor took place at Maureen Paley in London last June. <em>Oracle</em>, described as an EP, was birthed directly from that piece: Violette cast salt'n'resin reproductions of Sunn O)))'s amplifiers, instruments, and effects (i.e. the backline); he also built, in his signature black lacquered style, a stage platform, as well as sound panels, for Sunn O)))'s actual set up. <em>Oracle</em>'s first half is comprised of the 18-minute ""Orakulum"" and the 16-minute ""experiment"" ""Belürol
    Pusztít"", which are described as ""Sunn
    O)))'s interpretation"" of that Maureen Paley show.</p><p>
    The live lineup of Mark Deutrom (on bass), Mayhem vocalist Attila
    Csihar, Tos Nieuwenhuizen (Beaver, God) on moog, and the Sunn O)))
    core performed on the Violette-built stage at the opening. Much like
    Malefic's claustrophobic performance on ""Báthory Erzsébet<font size=""-1""><strong></strong></font>"", Csihar
    was sealed in a coffin, incanting tracts in old Hungarian, sort of
    speeches for the dead.  The big twist at the peformance-- much to curiosity seekers'
    chagrin-- was that the gallery goers
    weren't allowed to see it. The band, decked in robes et al, were in a sealed part of
    the gallery, basically trapped within their own coffin. As stated
    in the liner notes, they hoped this style of staging would create, ""a
    feeling of
    absence, loss and a phantom of what once was."" (Judging from some art rag reviews, it also pissed folks off...) 
    </p>
<p>
    The resulting CD  was sold (in an edition of 2,000) during
    live shows-- Sunn O)))'s 2007 ""Pacific Rim"" tour and the Southern
    Lord ""West Coast 777"" tour. The vinyl version was released in July in an
    addition of 7,777 copies. (Very 07/07.) As the liner notes detail, the <em>Oracle</em>
    recordings are <em>not</em> a recording of the live performance. O'Malley explained to me
    via email: ""There is no live recording of the action, although the
    tracks were written and sketch recorded (mixes were done later)
    beforehand for the collaboration."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Instead, the recorded versions are Sunn O))) proper
    along with Boris' Atsuo, Csihar, and Joe Preston. On the brittle, angular ""Belürol Pusztít""--
    ""destroys from the inside,"" or thereabouts, in Hungarian-- Preston puts his back into a
    jackhammer solo and Atsuo rattles some cymbals/smashes drums, but Csihar's low, throaty, scowling/growling and then instantly high-pitch/nails-on-a-chalkboard vocals are the
    focus (check the tiny tinkling at times from from beneath the drone). ""Orakulum"", the composition that was played at the opening, is a more sumptuous, standard Sunn O))) affair: Lots of slow, heavy guitar resonances and Csihar's anguished tones emerging from the background like an echo-chambered Hobbit (or, really, the dude from Inquisition). Eventually he's multi-tracked, consuming the notes around him. 
    </p>
<p>
    For the CD version of <em>Oracle</em>, a second disc is given over to the 46-minute ""Helio)))Sophist"", ""an audial collage of performances in Europe from July 2005."" The performers here are Anderson, O'Malley, Oren Ambarchi, Csihar, and Nieuwenhuizen. It builds and intensifies with Csihar's vocals, which are at first a low growl and eventually turn crackling, witchy, rumbling until they temporarily cut-out or are subsumed at the 20-something minute mark, making room for the milky drone of the instrumentalists, all <em>GrimmRobe </em>style. Occasionally the crowd cheers, reminding you that the shit's live, that Sunn remains especially important and effective (to say the least) in the live realm. 
    </p>
<p>
    So yeah, Sunn O)))'s work with Violette has led to interesting material; it also raises age-old questions about the art world dealing with and fetishizing ""outsiders."" Interesting, for instance,  to see Violette's fascination with black metal described as a fascination with ""death metal,"" that folks think (or wish?) Snorre Ruch from Thorns is still in prison (I visited his Norway home last year; dude's definitely not behind bars...but it makes a juicier story). These seem like minor slips, but hint at a larger misunderstanding (willful? confusion? disinterest?) in the subculture from which Violette's pulling some of his ideas. This sort of uneasy, half-baked relationship isn't new, but Sunn O))) have managed a level of art-realm success/integration that's currently unparalleled even by Gang Gang Dance, Forcefield, Lightning Bolt, Matmos, Japanther, etc. Congrats to 'em, I say: <em>Oracle</em> includes some excellent Sunn O))) material, and for all my obsessive detailing above and below, as long as you get what dudes are doing, who really cares how the fuck it came about?

    Ever since man learned to crane his neck and look up we've
    been staring at the stars, wondering how to get up there and, that goal
    achieved, wondering how to travel even further. So maybe it's not a coincidence
    that the dawn of the space age overlapped with the dawn of the psychedelic age,
    as millions of people without a science degree or NASA credentials realized
    they could travel just as far, only inwardly. Space became a state of mind, an
    alternate dimension accessible to anyone willing to open the door.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Or Pandora's Box, as the case may be, since the last thing
    any rock act needed was a culturally encouraged license for self-indulgence.
    After all, the perils of traveling toward inner space were practical: As
    amazing as the place may be, it's awfully hard to bring someone along with you.
    Not that Pink Floyd, Sun Ra, or any other ambitious interstellar travelers
    didn't try their best to lead the way, but more often than not their music
    provided the soundtrack for people already there, not people hoping to tag
    along.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Hailing from Ipswich, the Future Kings of England are the
    ultimate tag-along, coasting on the 40-year old jetstream left by Pink Floyd's
    trailblazing freakouts. It's a familiar space-prog universe populated by
    pulsing minor-key drones, alternately shimmering and sinewy guitars, Mellotrons
    and languid vocals beamed from some far off place, floating through the sonic
    ether in uncanny approximation of a bygone era, in search of a midnight laser
    show. But from their flare for grandiose dynamics to an instinct for the epic,
    the Future Kings of England also get just about every period detail right.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The cymbal and organ swells, dreamy guitar melody and wobbly
    bass line pulling<span> </span>along the opener
    ""Dunwich"" and leading to the first of many surprise explosions is just a taste
    of things to come. The hypnotic hum of phased guitars and diligent drums of
    ""Mustard Men"" cross the melodic mysticism of <em>Meddle</em>-era Floyd with the menace
    of early King Crimson, hitting a furious double-time peak four minutes in
    before resolving itself with an acoustic reverie overlaid with a chiming
    electric solo.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""Bartholomew's Merman"" makes great use of space, in every
    sense, the dull rumble of its close the perfect lead into ""Children of the
    Crown"", at nearly 10 minutes a proud-to-be-prog epic that starts off with
    hints of droning English folk and found sound before, as all prog-epics do,
    morphing into something else. Gothic, ghostly (or, for that matter, Ghost-ly)
    effects soon envelope the strumming and the sound of laughing children brings
    us to a portentous pause followed by sleepy organ, stately Gilmour-esque guitar
    and ultimately drums driving the song to what might have been, in another era,
    the end of Side One. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Side two, as any progger knows, is where the real action is,
    and the Future Kings of England don't disappoint. ""A Meeting at the Red Barn""
    is just a tease, a set-up, for the nearly 20 minutes of the title track, ""The
    Fate of Old Mother Orvis"", which begins auspiciously with the sound of birds
    cawing as if clearing their throats at the start of a new day. Brushed drums,
    organ and a lilting straight-forward melody introduce more spooky sound bites
    (keen ears might pick out such buzzwords as ""Satan,"" ""witches,"" ""sacrifices,""
    and ""dead"") before the trio drifts off into another transitional realm.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    No doubt anyone making up a plot as the song goes along will
    find the increasingly imposing cyclical guitar pattern and massed vocals that
    eventually appear perfect fuel for fertile imaginations, and the turn to
    near-tribal psych freakout immensely fulfilling. By the time it reaches its
    mysterious musical endpoint, we've arrived on the sidelines of the court of the
    Crimson King, triumphant and exultant, with ringing church bells sounding out
    as if to underscore the point. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    No, not everyone's taking the same trip, and the journey may
    lead to different destinations. But there's no question the Future Kings of
    England are quite adept at if not taking you along then certainly pointing you
    in the right direction. If that direction at first seems to be backwards, give
    it another chance. Playing with the very fabric of time and space has a way of
    turning things topsy turvey, and once you get settled in it becomes clear the
    band may be traveling forward after all, just on another plane, in a parallel
    dimension, where dinosaurs still walk the earth, the sun rises in the west,
    dogs sit at the dinner table and the UFO Club never shut its doors.

When in a sentimental mood, Russo resorts to a helium-high timbre that's highly reminiscent of his former boss Jonathan Donahue, while Hopewell, much like the Rev, are fond of using grandiose gestures to punctuate very simple emotions: namely, love and fear. And both bands operate according to the firm belief that the only way to follow up a massive, orchestro-rock crescendo is with another crescendo.</p><p>
    No doubt Russo is probably getting a little tired of reading Hopewell reviews that immediately revert to discussion of a band he left before Bush's first presidency. But he doesn't do much to dissuade the comparisons by opening <em>Beautiful Targets</em> with ""In Full Bloom"", a sweet, symphonic lullaby that could've been lifted off side two of Mercury Rev's <em>All Is Dream</em>: pensive, vulnerable verses alternate with a bright, swooning chorus, while a chirpy string section sets the moonlit scene. But as much as the melody and arrangement reinforce the Rev connection, the song's acoustic/percussion-less base signals a shift away from the stargazing psychedelic splendor of 2005's <em>Hopewell &amp; The Birds of Appetite</em> towards a more grounded sound.</p><p>
    And with that comes the realization that the nervous energy in Russo's piercing voice can adapt just as easily to herky-jerky, post-punky rock: With its shouted vocal hook, spiky guitar riff and four-to-the-floor drumbeat, ""All Angels Road"" is a few white-belt notches away from Hot Hot Heat, though its rumbling piano backbone keeps the new-wave affectations in check. The dry, unfussy production-- with the vocals upfront and instruments clearly separated in the mix-- can sometimes expose the limitations of Russo's voice (see: the cloying ""Bethlehem""), but for the most part, Hopewell benefits greatly from a more direct approach, particularly on the breathless power-pop stomp ""Echo &amp; His Brother"" and the excellent centerpiece track ""Monolith"", which patiently uses its four-minute run time to build a finger-picked acoustic foundation into a surging, piano-powered rocker.</p><p>
    But in spite of these promising developments, <em>Beautiful Targets</em> still represents more a tentative transition than a major transformation, its tracklist alternating regularly between the concise pop songs mentioned above and drawn-out, space-bound ballads more typical to the Hopewell canon. The latter camp is best represented by ""Tree"", a stoner serenade in the tradition of The Velvet Underground's ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin'"" that yields a volcanic eruption of symphonic swirls, blaring brass and wailing, wah-wahed guitars. It's a hell of a finale-- except it appears just four songs into the album, and effectively plays Hopewell's crescendo card way too early; by the time similarly-structured epics like ""Afterglow"" and ""To the Slaughter"" turn up in <em>Beautiful Targets</em>' home stretch, you can pretty much set your watch to when the strings come in. That's the funny thing about excess: it's most effective in small doses.</p></div>"|10519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10519-beautiful-targets/|6.6|Stuart Berman

    All respect to Northern State, the three-piece white-girl rap group named after Long Island's Northern State Parkway, which runs through their hometown. Half Hollow Hills High School West schoolmates, they became Northern State via a 2003 demo that became an EP that became the full-length <em>Dying in Stereo</em>. They garnered Beastie Boys comparisons for being Jewish, New Yawk, and white, and for jacking the same freeform, call-and-response sense of rhythm (and humor) from the Funky Four plus One. But where the early Beastie Boys were barely-educated teenagers more interested in Led Zeppelin's groupies than they were their fellow man, Northern State followed the lead of their fellow Nassau County natives Public Enemy and rapped about who they voted for in the 2000 presidential election. They did not have mic skills as skills have been defined in hip-hop post-Rakim; and you got the acute sense they didn't listen to much hip-hop post-Beastie Boys. To this site, their combination of liberal university politics and retrograde microphone technique was so obvious as to be offensive, and in response reviewer Michael Idov gave <em>Dying in Stereo</em> a score two tenths of a point less than one.</p><p>
    Like Luscious Jackson, their 1990s predecessors as New York's designated female Beastie Boys protégées, Northern State exposed hip-hop as a form as adaptable to whiteness and the suburbs as it was to countrywide worsening urban conditions and rising rates of black incarceration. This is something people who've grown up with rap music know without being told. That Northern State were basically bad rappers-- as were Luscious Jackson when they tried, and as is, say, Uffie or any number of other downtown-affiliated mic testers-- was only one of the many signs that they weren't really rappers at all.</p><p>
    On the four-tracked <em>Hip-Hop You Haven't Heard</em> demo/EP/album teaser, there was the shock of them spitting so sincere (""Twice they boast about their 'optimism,' and I love them for putting it so literally,"" wrote Robert Christgau) and the pleasure of parsing the personas: the ringleader Hesta Prynn; Spero, gently foulmouthed; Sprout, DJ and chief beatrider. Major label leap <em>All City</em> toned everything but the sincerity down, including the punchlines, and the hyper-audible enthusiasm that carried the whole enterprise sounded more like queasy confidence. They copped more expensive production and as a result didn't really sound like themselves, and they were the ones everyone liked in the first place.
    </p>
<p>
    Three years later they're out of their Columbia contract, Adrock's behind the boards (alongside Shitake Monkey's Chuck Brody), and their third full-length is titled <em>Can I Keep This Pen?</em> The phrase comes from posse-cut ""Mother May I?"", on which the three MCs trade lines and smack syllables, nodding at the proto-rap that birthed them. ""Complex times call for complex rhymes ya'll,"" says Prynn, ""A lime to a lemon yo a lemon to lime."" Elsewhere Sprout raps ""Forget the thruway, cause we rep the parkway."" On ""Sucka Mothafucker"" they shout out global warming: ""Got a brand new car shoulda bought the hybrid/ Cause you could afford it and I wish that I did/ Change your mind and all that you stand for/ Put Obama in your life and bring back Al Gore."" Not clear enough for you? Try ""Mothatfucka""'s massively off-key bridge, where the three of them warble ""This one's going out the Dem-o-crats/ 2004 ya'll came real wack/ But now that we got some real can-di-dates/ Can we please come correct in 2008?""
    </p>
<p>
    That Northern State will interrupt a beatdown on malt-liquor drinking fake-gangsters from Weehawken in order to endorse political aspirants is not news. More startling is the fact that nearly a full half of their tracks-- ""Better Already"", a Bloodhound Gang-sounding anthem about how much they like each other, and ""Good Distance"", a Breeders-esque seether-- take Luscious Jackson's eclectic indie-alt template as their own, sinking the beat amid pulses of synthy guitar. And they sing more than ever: on single ""Away Away"", on the electro-clash bouncer ""Cold War"", and on the slow-jammed ""Run of the Road"", which could have been written by TLC.
    </p>
<p>
    A lot of things going on here, then, often at the same time. No coincidence that Northern State's profile has been highest in New York and in rock critic circles-- elsewhere, people can't relate. And anyone with a stake in hip-hop over the last twenty years will notice how rarely Northern State do right by a genre from which they borrow so freely. Calling them wack MCs isn't saying much though-- they're the only MCs of their kind, competing only against themselves. No wonder they make music that sounds like it was made in a void: heart in the right place, perforated with off-key singing and C-grade rapping. Who could do their thing better?<br/>

    Upon hearing about Life Without Buildings' posthumous live album (which, given its total lack of press, probably happened just seconds ago), you either said ""who?"" or fell sideways out of your chair. The Glasgow-based band, which released a handful of singles and the cult-classic LP <em>Any Other </em>City around the turn of the millennium, is legendary among critics, DJs, and post-punk completists, but far from an indie household name. Of course, if you're someone who collects songs like Pokemons, part of LWB's appeal lies in that obscurity, as well as in their meager catalog-- they're the archetypal band who broke up too soon to tarnish their legacy. But mostly, Life Without Buildings are beloved because they were <em>freaking incredible</em>, inhabiting a personality-driven idiom with more charisma and originality than most anyone else.</p><p>
    LWB's spiky rock instrumentation and talky vocals place them in a lineage that begins with classic Rough Trade post-punk bands such as the Fall (aptly, Rough Trade affiliate Tugboat originally released <em>Any Other City</em> in 2001) and continues today with bands like Love Is All, Kiss Me Deadly, and Art Brut. As such, the band's one-of-a-kind aura isn't the product of inventing a new style. It stems largely from the vocal prowess and boundless personal magnetism of singer Sue Tompkins. Tompkins emerged suddenly from the visual art world-- LWB formed while studying at the Glasgow School of Art-- and vanished just as suddenly back into it (she warned us on ""Love Trinity"": ""I'm not willing to leave the visual world""). But in reality, she never left it-- her singing is painterly, mirroring the typographical emphasis of her collage-based visual art.</p><p>
    Tompkins' style seems descended from the look, if not the political content, of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's seminal Futurist text <em>Zang Tumb Tumb</em>, with its onomatopoeias, contrasting font sizes, anarchic typography, and jumbled cases. She translates this page-bound aesthetic into seductively coded lyrics where meaning is sometimes ambiguous, but feeling never is, and internal logic is always apparent. Tompkins stretches words like taffy or bites them off like fingernails (often in tight contrast: ""Liberty Feeeeeeeeel-<em>up</em>!""), shuffles letters and syllables like a card sharp (as on ""The Leanover"": ""b-b-b-b-baby, g g g, so g g g, you you,"" later repeating ""MBV"" in a rollercoaster cadence that probably refers to everyone's favorite shoegazers), breathes into the beats, abruptly shouts out numbers, jukes, hiccups and chirps. She circles her limber tongue-twisters, feints, and attacks from unexpected angles, dicing and rearranging them with the superhuman brio of an anime ninja and a telegraphic sense of lexical rhythm. 
    </p>
<p>
    Attributing LWB's appeal solely to Tompkins does a disservice to the rest of the band, particularly to guitarist Robert Johnson, whose style is just as strikingly colorful: Cool green and ice blue, spangled with quicksilver curlicues, the elegant lattices of his fretwork are never taken for granted by Tompkins' verbal espaliers. But Life Without Buildings were always a band who overshadowed themselves. Just as Tompkins' <em>sui generis </em>vocals made it easy to take their musical surroundings for granted, one song, ""The Leanover"", seemed so miraculous as to make the rest of their consistently fantastic music pale by comparison. As Johnson's guitar spews clouds of billowing glitter, Tompkins, with a tonal mixture of wonder, belligerence, sentimentality, and petulance, achieves the single most inspired rendition of her inimitable style. Dense with fractured refrains, seamless glides between melodious notes and spoken syllables, supple nursery rhyme cadences, peremptory vernacular, and mutating imagery (""Kiss me, break my mind, close the door/ Black steel, break my mind, close the door/ Black steel, the sight of you, falling out""), it sounded at once spontaneous and intricately composed, flirting with poetic structures (the aforementioned example resembles a corrupted pantoum). The melting elegy ""Sorrow"" shows that Tompkins could stunningly adapt this style for more pensive effects, but the wide-eyed effervescence of ""The Leanover"" remains the band's signature sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    What's truly remarkable is that ""The Leanover"", as well as all the other LWB songs, appear fully intact on <em>Live at the Annandale Hotel</em>, with every vocal strobe and chirrup, if not carbon-copied, faithful to the complex spirit of the studio version. Recorded at the venerable Sydney venue in December 2002, near the end of LWB's career, the album finds the band experienced enough to recreate their music with confidence, yet green enough to be ecstatic about doing so. The driving ""PS Exclusive"" cycles through its asymmetrical refrains (""the right stuff,"" ""the red villa,"" ""tonio, tonio"") without faltering; the fluidly hitching ""Juno"" keeps its dizzy flocks of pronouns in order; the plangent anthem ""New Town"" enlivens its chant of ""I forgot"" with studio-caliber tonal nuance. Unreleased track ""Liberty Feelup"", one of the last LWB wrote before disbanding, features an inspired performance by Johnson: a bright and rolling jangle that remains melodious even when corkscrewing into dissonance or bottoming out into feedback glides.
    </p>
<p>
    Tompkins' is breathlessly giddy for the duration. Glib but earnest, she's hard-pressed to make it through a sentence without breaking down into giggles. Even more than the excellent musicianship, her enthusiasm and genuine quirkiness carry the set. Typical banter goes something like this: ""That was a funny ending. [<em>Laughs nervously</em>] Well that was our first song. [<em>Sort of wheezes</em>] <em>Whoo</em>! I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that."" While Tompkins is charming and clearly having a blast, it's possible to read a burgeoning dissatisfaction with the predetermination of band life in her ongoing meta-narration. ""If I look over, it's because of the set list thing,"" she tells someone in the audience after ""Let's Get Out"". And later: ""We're here tomorrow, so we're gonna do the same songs in a different order,"" adding, ""that's cheeky."" 
    </p>
<p>
    It's as if the platitudes of touring (""[insert town name] is our favorite place to play!"") are too much artifice for the ingenuous singer to muster-- ""We haven't seen anything of Sydney yet, so we can't even say what we think of it,"" she says, acknowledging the tacit contract she's too honest to honor-- compelling her back to the more remote artistic sphere of visual representation. We, the fans, are left with one irreplaceable album, one equally amazing live document, and the lingering hope that, in this day of unexpected reunions, we might yet get to see Life Without Buildings for ourselves. C'mon guys, if Slint and Dinosaur Jr can do it...

A good chill comp is like a featherweight mixtape from a friend with an ear for laidback grooves; a bad chill mix is just muzak that's been tagged ""eclectic"" in iTunes. Likewise the recent trendlet where rockers and ravers have been scraping the layer of mold off of forgotten hunks of 1970s and 80s mellow gold can sometimes feel like trying to dress up cheesy listening and weak beats as ""lost gems."" But mp3 blog scavengers (and producer/artists like the Studio, Quiet Village Project, Map of Africa, and others) have also managed to unearth singles that were unforgivably banished to the bargain bins when punk and new wave trimmed rock back to pop and house shaved away disco's hairy excesses.</p><p>
    The officially licensed chill comp meets the underground's current fascination with yacht rock, space disco, pastoral prog, Pacific Coast synth-pop, fairy folk, and perennially feted Krautrock on Hans-Peter Lindstrøm's new edition of the popular <em>LateNightTales</em> series. Even the tracks recorded a few months ago sound like they could have been heard floating from the window of a young German's flat in 1975--or maybe 1985. As a producer and DJ, Lindstrøm is known for his ProTool-ed upgrades on the cosmic swooshes of Italo disco and the regimented bliss of Giorgio Mororder's mechanistic funk. Though little on his <em>Late Night Tales</em> reaches house's 120 bpm tempo, it's still of a piece with his vision of a world where kids hung Vangelis posters in their lockers and Ralf und Florian got mobbed by <em>Tiger Beat</em> readers.</p><p>
    Hell, Lindstrøm's taste in African-American soul, here represented Sly Stone's ""In Time"", also burbles to a drum machine beat. Other Yankee inclusions range from
    the ludicrously slick electronic skank of Carly Simon's ""Why"" (love the proto-house piano and multi-tracked big harmonies that indelibly date stamp it ""mid-'80s"") to an electro-disco hoedown from Dusty Springfield (hambone rhythms meet the spotless production of a Donna Summer record). Two future shock novelty tunes from Todd Rundgren and George Benson treat synthesizers like the space age instruments they once were, sounding like a cardboard UFO strafing a small town in a '50s B-movie soundtrack and a slightly new age-y sound FX record respectively. And we should point out that Lindstrom also includes a track from Pitchfork's own Dominique Leone which, even accounting for nepotism, ranks as the compilation's prettiest moment, a fuzzed-out lullaby where Brian Wilson invites Roedelius over for a play date to splash around in his sandbox.</p><p>
    But mostly this <em>Late Night Tales</em> is a European show, whether Lindstrøm is drawing from relics of the era of arpeggiated basslines or young bucks attempting to ape their style. Usually the relics come out ahead. The cod cinematic grandeur of Klaus Schulze associate Rainer Bloss' moistly melancholy synth strings, ""Chariots of Fire"" piano, and hissing '80s gated drums will bring a tear to anyone of a certain age with warm memories of the era's synth schlock, but the wheedling harmonica (or its computer equivalent) and lite-funk rhythm of Terje and Thomas' ""Regnbagn"" just sounds like the limp instrumental/dub b-side to a Lionel Richie single.</p><p>
    It's uncomfortable realizations like that where you suddenly remember that much of this era's castoffs were not necessarily forgotten by accident. It also makes you question why modern producers like Terje and Thomas would want to imitate or pay homage to such toothless fare. Unlike Rub-N-Tug's sour riposte to the chill out market, <em>Better With a Spoonful of Leather</em>, where the New York duo slowed down and processed the same sort of raw material that Lindstrøm is working with until it turned downright eerie, <em>Late Night Tales</em> is a straightforward trawl through laidback/featherweight music that often edges too close to muzak. Lindstrøm's ear gets the balance right about half the time, but he's occasionally too proud of showing off his taste in records that should have been left in dad's basement.</p></div>"|10537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10537-late-night-tales/|6.2|Jess Harvell

    English dance music hasn't had the best couple of years. Once sitting comfortably at the top of the heap, reinforced by imperial brands like <em>Global Underground</em> and colonial dominance of outposts like Ibiza, entrenched UK styles like progressive house have seen their cultural capital waning throughout the decade. Ibiza's hippest clubs have fallen to the techno anschluss; a Fabric headliner stands as good a chance of being French or German as local. Even Kompakt now has a London residency-- at Plastic People, a club better known for dubstep and broken beat parties. UK-oriented dance music media has shifted as well: <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Resident Advisor</strong></a>, once a comfortably Anglocentric publication, has become increasingly Continental in scope in recent years, and even Mixmag, the UK clubbers' bible, has gradually adopted a more cosmopolitan approach.</p><p>
    I'm ambivalent about the shift: shed no tears for progressive house, but a monoculture is a monoculture, after all, and the increasing ubiquity of German-inspired minimal house and techno (or French-inspired ""blog-house"") is feeling increasingly like a cul-de-sac as copycats and wildcatters flood the market. But the implosion has had positive fallout: indeed, one need look no farther than Mixmag's April ""Best of British"" issue to see how the decommissioning of the old guard has made room for an eclectic array of emerging voices: boldface names included Optimo, Shackleton, Klaxons, grime, and the ""techno nu breed"" as well as more predictably commercial propositions like Seamus Haji.</p><p>
    Enter London's Rekids label. Helmed by Matt Edwards, better known as Radio Slave (and, occasionally, Rekid), it might be the UK's strongest label at the moment, precisely for the way it's made overtures to Continental dancefloors while preserving a more traditionally British sensibility via echoes of acid house. Rekids completes its tripod footing by planting itself firmly-- if at a somewhat odd angle-- in Chicago and Detroit, electronic music's most hallowed stomping grounds. And it does all this without seeming either too clever or too reverent: it simply churns out banger after reliable banger. Rekids' approach to the 4/4 format is as populist as it is experimental: even DJMag.com, hardly the most progressive of publications, nominated Edwards and Rekids in three categories in its own ""<a href=""http://www.djmag.com/index.php?op=bestofbritish"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Best of British</strong></a>"" campaign.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Rekids Compilation One</em> celebrates the label's first year of operation with a double-CD collection of the best tracks and remixes from Rekids' first 17 vinyl-only releases. Disc one, which highlights the A-sides, opens with Rekid's ""Next Stop Chicago"", but the reference is far from purist. Rather than a tracky, by-the-numbers house cut, ""Chicago"" is a slowly grinding cycle of ringing guitars, tightly looped strings, jazz flute, and truncated soul vocals; a sluggish 110bpm at the very most, it underscores the extent that Rekids' music, if not its buzz, flirts with the intentional misreadings of revivalist disco like Lindstrøm, Prins Thomas, and DJ Harvey. It also highlights the unlikelihood that Rekids' songs have become bona fide hits in underground and middleground clubs: with its hypnotic churn and folky overtones, ""Chicago"" is undeniably (and addictively) odd, and the rest of the selections follow suit.
    </p>
<p>
    Toby Tobias' ""A Close Shave"", with its clockwork cowbell, jaunty arpeggios, and overtones of Metro Area, is one of the comp's more straightforward cuts; likewise, Audiofly &amp; Paul Harris' beefy ""Miscalate"" doesn't veer too far from the melodic electro-house template of Booka Shade or Patrick Chardronnet. But the rest of disc one is more esoteric. An understated sense of humor abounds, from the jokily spooky synth lead on Luke Solomon's ""Ghouls"" to the drunken breakdown of Radio Slave's ""Secret Base"", which features frequencies high-pitched enough to scatter a pack of dogs. If there's a single defining characteristic here, it's probably the bleep-- unsurprising, perhaps, given that the label's first release was Radio Slave's ""My Bleep"". The track slathers an insistent square-wave melody over mid-range synths with the feel of shirred sandpaper. It's just this side of strident, but Edwards' command of techno dynamics keeps it bracing throughout. Likewise, Mr. G's twitchy ""E.C.G.'ed"", Discemi's shredded-acid ""Von Wright Code"", and Spencer Parker's ring-mod-crazy ""Beautiful Noise"" underscore the impression that many of Rekids' melodies are cribbed from the Intergalactic Robot Songbook.
    </p>
<p>
    If the mark of a good A&amp;R strategy is a catalogue full of strong tracks, then the mark of a great one is a series of remixes that might be even better, and disc two doesn't disappoint on this front: Radio Slave, Quiet Village, Brontosaurus, Jesse Rose, Claude VonStroke, Alter Ego's Roman Flügel, and Ewan Pearson and Al Usher's Partial Arts all turn in remixes that are at least equal to the originals. Again, disco turns out to be one of the cornerstones of Rekids' sound. (I have always tended to think of the label as focusing principally on house and techno, but one of the joys of <em>Rekids Compilation One</em> is the way it shows how the imprint can mean different things to different people.) Prins Thomas and Brontosaurus both offer chunky, wonky versions of ""A Close Shave"", while Quiet Village's mix of ""Dave's Sex Bits"" is so achingly slow it sounds like a chopped and screwed take on cosmic disco.
    </p>
<p>
    The best of the rest showcase Rekids in club-conquering mode. If you've been to a nightclub in the last year-- whether in Berlin, London, or New York, and whether sponsored by the Fader or Resident Advisor-- you've probably heard these cuts. Jesse Rose, often mentioned in the same breath as ""fidget-house"" proponents like Switch and Sinden, tackles Rekid's ""Next Stop Chicago"", which feels appropriate: the original owes more than a moderate debt to Rose's own soul-sampling house numbers for the Dubsided label. Likewise, given the Bay Area's historic ties to the UK house scene, it makes sense for Claude VonStroke to give Solomon's ""Ghouls"" an aggressive, shoomping beat-down, stray blips and jungle-inspired bass drops zooming hither and yon.
    </p>
<p>
    One of Rekids' strengths in terms of creating its reputation-- its aura, if you will-- turns out to be its uncanny knack for playing with dance music's hidden narratives. So Roman Flügel turns Radio Slave's ""My Bleep"" into an old-school trance epic suffused with cathedral-sized reverb, exactly the kind of thing that Edwards does when he gets a remix commission. Edwards' own reworks here prove him to be one of dance music's best remixers of the moment (no matter that he borrows a fair bit of his strategy from Carl Craig). Radio Slave's ""Panorama Garage Remix"" of Matt O'Brien's aptly titled ""Serotone"" makes explicit the connection between New York's house history and Berlin's techno present by dropping an easy, jacking beat, drawing out the tension and teasing the brain and body's most hedonism-prone pleasure receptors with a synth lead that zigzags like cartoon lightning. And his shuffling, bleepy-- there's that word again-- update of Mr. G's ""E.C.G.'ed"" takes its emotional cues from a spool of live electrical wire, stretching out towards the horizon in a gesture of unmitigated yearning, hissing and spitting all the while.<br/></p></div>"|10506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10506-rekids-compilation-one/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

Over the three years since the group's sole release to date, U.S.E. contributor Jason Holstrom has bided his time taking that suggestion to heart.  Inspired by a trip to the Hawaiian islands followed by a few years in the studio (appropriately dubbed ""The Cabana""), Holstrom's latest flight of fancy is <em>The Thieves of Kailua</em>, a musicological experiment as socks-and-sandals 50th state getaway, told with the instrumental precision of a native session man.</p><p>
    Although arguments could be made for <em>Kailua</em>'s precursors in smart, luxuriant flip-flop-pop-- the Beach Boys' languid, sun-blanched harmonies, Ry Cooder's indigenous guitar-rock, the High Llamas' pith-helmet ethnography <em>Hawaii</em>-- Holstrom's songwriting and engineering keep the record from becoming a well-accompanied post-holiday slide-show.  The tale is basic (love, Hawaiian-style) but as any travel agent or sunburned weekender will tell you, it's the journey itself that counts.  ""Crystal Green"" opens the record with Holstrom gazing out of his plane window, noting the ocean's color.  His weightless, echoed voice meshes with the thick swells of richly-recorded instrumentation around it: rolling bass drums, a guitar twanging a melody that recalls a TV Western, a whip-crack vocal effect straight from a Martin Denny or Esquivel record fade as the sound of a two-prop plane (a ""real"" plane, the liners indicate) fades into the horizon.  A lap-steel guitar provides the atmosphere for ""Hawaii She Calls"", a late-album track that marks Holstrom's island conversion, and closer ""Hula-Bye"" is wordless acapella recalling the <em>Pet Sounds</em> box set extras.</p><p>
    In between, however, Holstrom recalls with verve a pretty eventful vacation: he's mugged, falls in love with a girl, and does significant amounts of lounging about.  We hear what sounds like the resort concierge on ""Welcome-Clouds Roll in"", informing us ""the ukelele band is gonna play, just like they do it every single day."" Later, the sax-accompanied <em>Grease</em>-style ""Under Setting Sun"" is a lovers' duet, on which Holstrom is accompanied by his paramour (""All there is to do is sit and dream of her/ And I'll dream of him too""), but sings alone the chorus, the giddy realization that ""I'm falling in love.""  The five-minute title suite contains <em>Kailua</em>'s other significant occurrrence: after experiencing the opposite of hospitality, and describing the perpetrators, Holstrom laments: ""Now do I look like the purist tourist/ Look at my skin so white/ To the thieves of the island I ain't no native, but that don't make it right.""  </p><p>
    Holstrom's wayfaring status on <em>Kailua</em> highlights the most significant connection between U.S.E. and his current conceit.  Both aesthetically-divergent ventures rely on precisely-executed high-concept fantasy: <em>U.S.E.</em> was the work of some mashed-together Seattleite indie rockers pretending to be a German electro-outfit, and <em>Kailua</em> is a personal travelogue with a regionalized soundtrack.  The fact that both records start sounding a bit samey after a few listens (the vocoder and uke have one thing in common: they both grate in large doses) indicates that Holstrom might just have a career here:  making one-off, pleasure-seeking concept albums between production sessions for other artists.  If his subsequent safaris are the enjoyable diversions the last two have been, why stop?<br/></p></div>"|10507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10507-the-thieves-of-kailua/|6.5|Eric Harvey

    The third recording from Githead, a collaboration between
    Wire's Colin Newman, Robin Rimbaud (aka Scanner), and Minimal Compact's Malka
    Spigel, signals a change in direction even before you play it. The cover
    completes the trio of primary colors that have adorned their releases, but it's
    also the first to include images of any kind, though the image is somewhat
    ambiguous. On the disc itself, the music is less spare and more
    diverse than it was on <em>Profile</em> or the
    <em>Headgit</em> EP.</p><p>
    The title of the album is an obvious label for the type of
    music it contains-- it's sort of like putting a sticker that says ""apple"" on a
    granny Smith. There's a portion of the album where the ""pop"" half wins out
    considerably, and those songs tend to be the most satisfying all around. For
    opener ""On Your Own"", Newman largely leaves his usual Githead monotone behind
    in favor of the kind of gentle, harmony-friendly singing we first heard from
    him on Wire's <em>Chairs Missing</em> almost 30 years ago. In fact, later in the album, the chorus melody of ""All Set
    Up"" flirts directly with the chorus melody of ""Outdoor Miner"". Rimbaud and
    Spigel sometimes double Newman, giving certain songs a melodically layered
    effect that wears quite well.</p><p>
    Spigel is a bit more prominent, taking the lead on
    ""Lifeloops"" and ""Space Life"", two of the most divergent tracks on the album.
    ""Lifeloops"" is built around an acoustic guitar figure,
    distinguishing it from the sleek, electronic guitar tones on the rest of the album.
    The lyrics are no less abstract than any of Newman's image salads, though, and Spigel's deadpan delivery never really takes it anywhere. ""Space Life"" is quite a
    bit better, a swirling, stomping slice of future funk that features Spigel's
    intonations at the beginning and end-neither track is quite as good as her
    showcase from <em>Profile</em>, ""My LCA
    (Little Box of Magic)"", which was the best song on that album. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album's lowest point comes smack dab in the middle. ""Jet
    Ear Game"" is a synthesized soundscape that houses a voice (probably Spigel's)
    heavily coated in electronic processing, to the point of near unintelligibility
    (it's reading bits of Githead-related criticism, so take from that what you
    will). It sounds like it would have been interesting to put together, but it
    isn't very interesting to listen to. ""Drop"" and ""Darkest Star"" have decent
    beats but do little with them, producing surprisingly static final tracks. 
    </p>
<p>
    It all makes the sublime pop of tracks like ""These Days""
    stand out more-Newman really stretches himself as a songwriter and singer on
    these songs, and what he comes up with is truly excellent. Ultimately, though, <em>Art Pop</em> has a similar problem to its
    predecessor in that outside of a core of outstanding tracks it's fairly thin.
    It is, however, nice to hear the band evolving and experimenting and generally
    being treated like a major project by the participants.

The most telling question and answer refer to ""Simon Is Stronger Than Us"", a playful song with Akron/Family, then Gira's backing band, teasing his broad baritone with yelps for harmonies. Hell inquired if the line ""And Francis did that, too, though Francis drawed London and made no excuse"" was a reference to Irish painter Francis Bacon: ""Well yes, I am referring to Francis Bacon there, very astute of you,"" the singer replied.</p><p>
    Of course Gira would reference Bacon, call him by name even: Articulating with screams, something Bacon specialized in while painting, has been paramount to Gira's aesthetic for a quarter century now. On <em>We Are Him</em>-- his sixth and arguably most engaging album as Angels of Light-- he lands some of the best of those complete releases. Gira seems more empowered and commanding than he has in a decade, the emotions he's conveying coming in huge fits that, like Bacon's, are as powerful as they are draining. He's backed by one of the most impressive guest lists of the year (Akron/Family providing the basic tracks, plus new friends or longtime collaborators Larkin Grimm, David Garland, and Bill Rieflin), but one must understand that this is Gira's album. He lets it all out and wastes little time: Four seconds into the colossal opening track, ""Black River Song"", for instance, a thick electric bass knock pumps against every heavy drum hit and compacted guitar sinew: ""Black river runs/ beneath this ground/ Black river flows forever/ But he makes no sound."" The chorus-- some variation of the series, ""Fading, growing, breathing, flowing,"" sung by Gira and female voices-- is sinister, challenging and almost sexy.</p><p>
    A track later, a rocking-chair rhythm moans beneath Gira's snarl. He's rarely sounded this foreboding: Prodded by a scathing, raw violin drone and a daring chorus of sirens, it's an escalating dirge for the collapse of society, full of floods, blood and mouths too stupid to scream. Beneath an electric guitar twitter, heavy drums and furious strings on ""My Brother's Man"", Gira hands down these imprecations: ""I walk through the thick black mud. I walk with my brother's blood. I see with my brother's eye. I scream at my brother's sky."" Swans, anyone?
    </p><p>
    But this record isn't so simple. ""My Brother's Man"" notes that the brother is capable of murder and so is Gira. But it embraces the relationship, vowing to crush god ""in my fucking hand"" for the sake of fraternal legacy. It's protective, triumphant. The subsequent ""This Is Not Here""-- a dark duet with Gira's wife, Siobhan Duffy-- offers the lovers choices and endings: Will the world steal the sun, or will the lovers touch the light? ""Will you dream that we breathe?"" It's not about anger or fatalism. In 1984, Gira screamed about burning and eating hearts on ""Raping a Slave""; in 1995, he sang about supplication to God while witnessing the fragility of the world during ""Our Love Lies"". <em>We Are Him</em> is a near-perfect, totally committed summation hammering at the same unresolved archetypes from someone who's now a father.
    </p>
<p>
    That's not to say that this album is without its share of misses, or at least the occasional artistic anomie that has, by now, become a requisite of Gira's work. Those songs aren't better left unsung: ""Goodbye Mary Lou"" has a purpose, its rhythm an uneasy country twitter that leaves Gira little room to do much but say exactly what he's feeling. The first verse ends ""Mary Lou, I renounce you""; the second, ""Mary Lou, fuck you""; and in closing, the indiscretions of young anger that have been boiling for a lifetime come crashing down with a wink: ""Oh Mary Lou, I forgive you.""
    </p>
<p>
<em>We Are Him</em> is ultimately about getting by, about trying to survive with a family and a faith at a time when ""the dogs...howl as the street fills with blood."" Gira, at 53, continues to evolve, to challenge himself, to question his beliefs. As long as he does that, every song won't roar like the perfect first two tracks of <em>We Are Him</em> or have the brilliant gospel insistence of the title track. The slight, charming chamber pop he tries won't always work as it does on ""Sunflower's Here to Stay"", a song that pushes for persistence. Luckily, doing otherwise has never been an option for Gira.

    Nina Nastasia has a knack for singing about talking.  Of the 10 excellent songs on <em>You Follow Me</em>, eight of them cite, narrate, or allude to conversation.  It's fitting, then, that her latest album-- a deeply communicative collaboration with virtuoso drummer Jim White-- is among the most solid and striking things she's ever released. White's nuanced drumming makes a perfect foil for Nastasia's sturdy voice, and the interaction between the two is entrancing.<br/></p><p>
    White and Nastasia wrote and arranged <em>You Follow Me</em> together, and the depth and caliber of their collaboration is immediately apparent.  Every chord, note, and drum hit seems perfectly arranged for maximum impact; a well-placed kick or snare drum often feels like a punch in the chest.  White masterfully teeters between order and chaos, pushing Nastasia into previously unexplored expressive territory.  And though the album is arranged solely for vocal, guitar, and drums, it never feels stale or samey.  If anything, the record's economy makes it all the more arresting.</p><p>
    Steve Albini's stark and sinewy production further highlights the album's dynamic range.  From the skittering shuffle of ""Our Discussion"" to the authoritative boom of ""Late Night"", nothing on <em>You Follow Me</em> is half-baked or half-assed.  ""The Day I Would Bury You"" brings to mind Will Oldham's ""Nomadic Reverie"", gradually building in intensity before dying down to a haunting murmur.  By the song's end Nastasia is barely audible, perfectly expressing the song's confusion and devastation.</p><p>
    As with the music, Nastasia's lyrics here never seem haphazard or tossed off.  Over the course of the record, dry observations and lyrical metaphors are deployed strategically and purposefully, evoking the sober ease of the early evening and the vivid horror of the late night.  The feverish naturalistic imagery of ""I've Been Out Walking"" seems just as comfortable and well-placed as the more pensive narration of ""Our Discussion"".  On album closer ""I Come After You"", White's decisive and muscular drumming weaponizes Nastasia's lyrical indictments (""Don't think you are exceptional / Don't dream you're better than anyone else"").</p><p>
    Clocking in at just over a half-hour, <em>You Follow Me</em> avoids the aimless indulgence that musicians communicating at this level often succumb to; it's clear that Nastasia and White made pains to ensure that every second of You Follow Me is indispensable.  And, sure enough, not a single sound on this record falls outside of the album's unending and all-encompassing dialog. These songs are built like a Jenga game; it's hard to imagine subtracting a single piece without the whole thing falling apart.  At a time when piling on wacky instruments often passes an excuse for lackluster songwriting, <em>You Follow Me</em> is incredibly refreshing.  Like the best conversation partners it doesn't talk a lot, but it says a lot.<br/>

    Though the timing and connections that made it happen are pretty clear, it's still hard to fathom how a band as sonically prickly as Black Dice got so popular. Their music has always been stubborn and hard to pin down, full of curious dodges and spiky resistance. Often they slyly skirt some elusive sweet spot, hovering around the place you think they're headed without ever arriving there. As Dominique Leone wrote in his Pitchfork review of <em>Broken Ear Record</em>, ""there's always something a little uncomfortable about Black Dice-- but then they wouldn't be as interesting otherwise."" Even the band's least successful tracks hold a fascinating tension-- but they aren't exactly crowd-pleasing.</p><p>
    It may be misleading to say that <em>Hermaphrodite</em>, the first solo album by Black Dice's Eric Copeland, is catchier than anything his band has done. After all, it's a noisy, predominantly abstract record. But there's a joyful swing and pleasant ease to Copeland's work here that no Black Dice album has quite caught. Rather that darting around implied destinations, Copeland is happy to settle into grooves, picking simple patterns and letting them blissfully churn away. The result is music that you can actually nod your head to, even when it challenges your grey matter.<em></em></p><p>
<em>Hermaphrodite'</em>s accessibility comes not just from its simplicity, but also its playfulness. Through bouncy rhythmic loops, sprightly vocal chants, and child-like melodies, Copeland crafts pieces that feel sunny and breezy even at their roughest. In that sense Hermaphrodite evokes Gang Gang Dance's early séances and Animal Collective's brighter rain dances. But it's even closer to the wide-eyed art loops of the Residents. Copeland captures that seminal outfit's primal beauty on tracks like ""Wash Up"", with its warped vocals and bubbly synths, and ""FKD"", with sneaky whines so Residents-like you can practically follow the bouncing eyeball.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, Copeland has an understated humor all his own.  On ""La Booly Boo"", he melts tribal field recordings into a stoned, gleeful mush. Later, the ping-pong percussion of ""Tree Aliens"" sounds like cartoon sound effects in an echo chamber, and the goofy hook of ""Spacehead"" hypnotizes. One could perhaps fault <em>Hermaphrodite</em> for a slight sameness, as adjoining tracks sometimes blur together. But maybe that's just a testament to the subtlety of Copeland's work. As simple and bright as many of these pieces are, none of them scream at you, instead approaching at off-angles and sloping curves. And besides, this is only Copeland's first solo record, and the forthcoming Black Dice album will be only their fourth. Both have plenty of time to diversify, and <em>Hermaphrodite</em> is a decidedly strong shot in that direction.

    Ba Da Bing, which has shown a recent tendency toward the young and retro-dignified (Beirut, Essie Jain), finds its next constituent in 22-year old Lawrence, Kansas expat and Bobby Darin aspirant Patrick Cleandenim.  His first LP under this moniker (his parents named him Patrick Clendenin Roberts), <em>Baby Comes Home</em>, was recorded throughout 2005 with significant help from enrollees in the University of Kansas' music department. Cleandenim recruited dozens of Jayhawks to serve as his backing band, and <em>Baby</em>'s lush brass and strings reflect it.  Studio time was tight, with recording sessions taking place during the graveyard shift-- only appropriate for a record with several songs that lurk through the darker side of the high life.</p><p>
    The album opens in grand fashion, with the title track's cinematic fanfare-- shrill, rising strings, a vibraphone, the thwack of a snare drum-- giving way to the cocky brass that carries the song.  Sitting down his martini to sing, Cleandemin cuts right to the lyrical chase:  ""I saw you walkin' with a vampire last night."" Two songs later, ""Cognac and Caviar"" matches that portentous extravagance-- ""Mack the Knife"" from the first person perspective-- its chorus recommending with all due nonchalance to ""put poison in his Cognac and carry on.""</p><p>
    That last song's verse melody is worthy of a separate mention; it highlights <em>Baby</em>'s slight-but-attractive musical range, which thankfully pushes out further from the Squirrel Nut Zippers retread suggested early on.  Simply put, ""Cognac"" (and later, ""Until You Said I'm Gone"" and the wonderful, classic-Hollywood number ""Days Without Rain"") is dinner-theatre soul of the 5th Dimension variety, its melody sung in the crisp, tight harmonic style of the 1960s vocal group.  But with the capriciousness of a kid with endless options at his command, the song temporarily switches gears for its chorus-to a peppy romp that would make the Scissor Sisters' Jake Shears take notice, as would the sashaying ""Rocket to the Moon"".  It's over-the-top camp that finds the overlap between burlesque and elevator pop, and damn if Cleandenim doesn't pull it off with verve to spare.</p><p>
    Cleandemin brushes up against classic soul throughout <em>Baby</em>. ""So You Think You're Gonna Live Forever"" feels like a it could have been written by Burt Bacharach for Dionne Warwick, and the deeply-echoed ""Whispers Only Hurt Them"" recalls the Velvelettes' 1964 Motown single ""He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'"". Most impressively, the piano shuffle from ""Gone"" is lifted from the Dramatics' 1972 Stax hit ""What You See Is What You Get"" (itself a Temptations cop), and injected with a Bossa Nova flair.  </p><p>
    These songs, and <em>Baby</em> on the whole, owe a clear debt to an earlier age of refined crooner pop and elegant soul, yet Cleandenim performs them with the ramshackle ease of, well, a kid with a bunch of talent and a massive supporting cast.  He's also skillful enough to introduce a palpable sense of disquiet to even the record's most graceful passages, indicating an aptitude not only for adapation, but also unforced drama.  Odds are, he'll adopt a different guise for his next outing-- his current incarnation follows a stint in an indie band and another as a singer-songwriter-- and it wouldn't be at all surprising to see this musical method-actor nail another role.</p></div>"|10510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10510-baby-comes-home/|6.9|Eric Harvey

    Scissors for Lefty are one of those unfortunate bands primarily identified as underground, though not by choice. There's nothing about the San Franciscan quintet that doesn't scream out heavy FM airplay, and on sophomore album <em>Underhanded Romance</em>, the band further revs up the music-for-masses tropes present on their 2005 debut <em>Bruno</em>. While the carrot on a stick remains close thanks to primo touring gigs with bands like Arctic Monkeys and Dirty Pretty Things, most of <em>Romance</em> features the group hesitantly picking their poison, whether it be revived new wave partying or affected Britpop.</p><p>
    A quick glance at Scissors' soundalikes signals plenty of red flags. The Killers, Ok Go, The Bravery, and boring, latter-day Hot Hot Heat crop up in many tracks here, mostly due to frontman Bryan Garza's excitable vocal tics. Whether croaking a nasally mouthful of lyrics à la Steve Bays or putting on the sexy crooning airs of Jarvis Cocker, his proactive melodies grab the reigns on every track, bloating most of them into anthems. Occasionally the band successfully summons these big moments, like ""Save it Cory""'s sunny splash of ""whoa's"" or the palm-muted power pop frustration of ""Next to Argyle"". However, the good times can't keep rolling throughout <em>Romance</em>, and the super-sized party tricks quickly wear thin.</p><p>
    The band spends most of this album trying to get you on the dancefloor, shoving inane basslines and happy-go-lucky, out-of-breath maxims in your face. Still sitting? Fine, these guys can get sleazier. A new, needlessly jacked-up version of Bruno's ""Ghetto Ways"" annoys with its half-hatched electro come-ons, making the listener wish the band never purchased a synthesizer, while opener ""Nickels &amp; Dimes"" strikes glam rock poses with disappointingly flaccid riffs.
    </p>
<p>
    Ideally these guys should cut their dance-rock shtick and embrace their more wistful, melodic side. ""Marsha"" apes Cocker's love-struck sighs pretty impressively, with Garza attempting to remain wry and catchy in spite of his own sentimentality: ""Christ, I wish to find someone for sunsets.../ Every holiday I wish for that."" Our party animal even turns a bit sour on moody mid-tempo track ""X's Are Forever"", bemoaning an ex over a languishing bassline. In <em>Romance</em>'s dance/dour dichotomy, Garza sounds more appropriate throwing stones at bedroom windows than throwing down on the dancefloor as a cocksure, testosterone-addled lothario. Fortunately, the album's second-half pathos restores the charisma-- albeit charisma borrowed from indie's biggest cults of personality-- that the initial post-punk-dance-revival-hyphenated bullshit nearly pisses away.</p></div>"|10503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10503-underhanded-romance/|5.8|Adam Moerder

    For Canadian romantics Stars, love is war. And their
    modern love is strikingly similar to the world's modern war: confusion and anxiety
    topped with a sense of semi-staged dread. The presentation is great-- clean production, fine instrumentation, and careful arrangements-- but its undercurrent is pure self-doubt and
    longing. So while the quintet pushes its passion-based politics to the fore
    and includes the phrase ""after the war"" in the title of its fourth
    album, the emphasis is still ""in our bedroom."" Assuming you can dodge
    enough bullets to make it there.</p><p>
    Of course, the intricacies of relationships have always been
    Stars' specialty. ""I am trying to say what I want to say without having to
    say I love you,"" chirped co-leads Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan on
    2004's minor masterpiece <em>Set Yourself on Fire</em>, and the line's roundabout Valentine's Day logic
    could double as a band mantra. What sets their new album apart from previous
    material is setting, scope, and a newly inflated theatrical bent. Considering his
    decade-spanning IMDb resume-- not to mention an award nomination for 1983's
    boy-meets-sea creature drama <em>The Golden Seal</em>-- Campbell's mannered, Moz-y vocal
    delivery is hardly surprising. He's a ham, plain and simple. The singer's over-the-top
    preening is Stars' most divisive characteristic but, instead of toning things
    down, his acting chops and sense of Broadway pomp permeate <em>Bedroom</em>'s high-gloss
    pop more than before. And, as any Hollywood-type will tell you, an actor is
    only as good as his script.</p><p>
    Playing a pill-popping whore looking to shatter his dead-end
    existence on the U2-style ""Take Me to the Riot"", Campbell
    brings his pitiful role to life with compassion. Backed by smashing
    cymbals and chiming tones, his ad-libbed plea to ""let me stay, let me, let me
    stay!"" erases the distance between the performer and his character. The <em>Les
    Mis</em>-esque weeper ""Barricade"" doesn't fare as well: Its storyline is
    trite (a couple brought together-- then torn apart-- by a common, radical
    cause!) and, accompanied by a lone piano, there's nothing for Campbell
    to hide behind. But even if it approaches cheeseball bluster, at least it's sorta ballsy. Muddled by forced postmodern
    nonsense and an oddly lifeless narrative, ""Life 2: The Unhappy
    Ending"" is about as boring as its title. Ironically, though she might
    not possess a SAG card, Millan's dramatic abilities often trump her partner's on
    <em>Bedroom</em>-- she's more subtle and natural whether nailing the album's straight-ahead
    pop songs on her own or bringing out Campbell's best on a couple stand-out
    duets. 
    </p>
<p>
    Both ""My Favourite Book"" and ""Bitches in Tokyo""
    find Millan pining for affection in unequivocal terms. ""Book"" runs with
    the blind optimism of the group's indie-hit ""Ageless Beauty""-- a rare
    moment of guilelessness buoyed by an easy listening backdrop that would
    make Burt Bacharach giddy. The
    song provides a brief but welcome respite from the hurt and rejection surrounding it. (As if to immediately deflate the cheeriness, Millan snaps out of her rose-pedal haze with the first words
    of the following track: ""Sweetness never suits me.""
    Never say never.) ""Bitches"" isn't as dizzy-- after a plethora of
    ""mistakes,"" ""lying"" and ""sabotage,"" Millan can't help but beg
    an ex to take her back. But even with all that baggage, the singer makes a
    convincing case with the help of some blistering girl-group drums, piano and
    horns. Short and without reservation, the song avoids some of the indulgent
    outros and solos that tank <em>Bedroom</em>'s lesser Millan-sung tracks including the
    guitar-grinding ""Window Bird"" and lethargic pep talk ""Today Will
    Be Better, I Swear!""  
    </p>
<p>
    As on <em>Set Yourself on Fire</em>'s incredible ""Your Ex-Lover
    Is Dead"", which had Campbell and Millan not just backing each other up but
    interacting and playing off each other in a bittersweet boy-girl tale,
    <em>Bedroom</em>'s ""Midnight Coward"" and ""Personal"" take full
    advantage of the band's unique two-headed attack. The former is a neurotic
    internal analysis of that oh-so-important first-date question: Should I stay or
    should I go? ""I don't want to say too much,"" whispers Millan, rifling
    through the night's possibilities before finally joining Campbell
    into the unknown: ""I can see what's coming, but I'm not saying it.""
    On the surface, ""Personal"" is a gimmick-- a
    song written in personal ad parlance (""Wanted single F/ Under 33/ Must
    enjoy the sun/ Must enjoy the sea""). But both vocalists give the song their most
    impressive performances-- Campbell distant and cold, Millan vulnerable and
    pained-- turning its showy conceit into something genuinely wrenching.
    The ambiguously antiquated details emphasize its timeless central struggle: Stamped missive or Match.com, the face-to-face (dis)connection's the thing. 
    </p>
<p>
    Growing more staged, warier, and a little less playful
    with age, Stars don't quite match the wily rush of <em>Set Yourself on Fire</em> here.
    After three albums of artistic quantum leaps, they slow down gracefully on
    <em>Bedroom</em>, replacing <em>Fire</em>'s indie-symphony twists and turns with
    more overt dramatic airs that can fall into blubbering melodrama, e.g., the title
    track, which suffocates under its own ticker-tape parade epic-ness. But when they're
    on, Stars are one of only a few current bands that can make war seem so appealing.

    compilation series-- where the Cologne, Germany
    techno label annually collects a late-summer clutch of
    new and previously released tunes-- were an agreeable
    jumble of different flavors. Each offered a menu where
    you might find outright electro-pop sharing space with
    a techno anthem made up of just a hammering kick drum
    and a gnarled synth patch or a blissed-out ambient track.
    But few longtime fans expect that sort of diversity
    from the label now; much of what's been written about
    Kompakt in the past few years, whether positive or

    house cover of Brian Eno's ""Baby's on Fire.""</p><p>
    That's not to say <em>Total 8</em> is a
    letdown within its own slightly constrictive
    parameters. Tracks like Kompakt mainstay Jörg Burger's
    ""Polyform"" set the template for much of <em>Total
    8</em>'s two discs: An opening ripple of Chain
    Reaction-style echo, a circular drum pattern built on
    thin high-hats and a metronomic kick, and a swirl of
    glassy bleeps, making your enjoyment of its clockwork
    groove dependent on how lost you can get within
    Burger's minimal matrix. The rest of the compilation's
    sparer tracks pass or fail, as with most minimal dance
    music, on the basis of their sonic accessories. DJ
    Koze's ""Mariposa"" grinds and splutters through a long
    outro that sounds like a prop airplane's engine about
    to burst into flames, and Jürgen Paape and Echo Club
    both seem to have gotten their eerie, alien hooks from
    the insect kingdom. But pro forma inclusions from
    Herve AK and Steadycam blur so unobtrusively that you
    wonder if even their creators could pick them out of
    the middle of a DJ set.</p><p>
    Elsewhere <em>Total 8</em> explores terra cognita like
    the kind of tactile, grotty ambience first popularized
    by Basic Channel (Superpitcher's crepuscular crackles
    and Nightcats' fizzing overlays), and tracks from the
    Rice Twins and Thomas/Mayer exhibit the odd restraint
    that Kompakt brings to the template of ""cheesy""
    trance. With their teardrop pianos and sighing synth
    pads-- Ibiza anthems that have been tranquilized and
    shackled with leg irons-- Kompakt's almost aggressive,
    campy melodic wistfulness remains firmly intact. Even
    <em>Total 8</em>'s clutch of disco tunes-- like the
    delay-swathed shuffle of Burger/Voigt, the
    short-circuiting disco-trance of Gui Boratto, Partial
    Arts' mournful strings, or the playfully downcast 1980s
    boogie of Justus Köhncke-- seem best suited to a
    lonely, late night taxi ride home from the club.
    </p><p>
    But whereas the label's love of heavily accented
    English vocals once leavened the heavy (or heavenly)
    atmosphere of Kompakt's tracks, familiarity can now
    make them feel like a labored attempt at being cute.
    Just listen to tracks like Paape's flimsy
    come-on ""We Love"" or Broke's Teutonic take on the Jon
    Spencer Blues Explosion's version of ""funkiness"" on
    ""Cola Dancer"" (which has, in its favor, the closest
    thing to a proper bassline on the whole record). You
    get the impression that a belted diva hook from
    somebody with a decent pair of lungs and a grounding
    in the blues might send all these European sons
    scurrying right under their beds. It's doubly a shame,
    because a few decent vocals might have spiced the
    record's occasionally starchy instrumentals. But
    <em>Total 8</em> does reaffirm, as with the last few
    volumes, that listeners can rely on Kompakt to crank
    out a few dozen good-to-great cuts a year-- at least if
    they're not so worried about challenging their
    tastebuds.

    Charles Mingus-- ornery, incendiary, and quick-tempered-- was a mountain of a man who produced a mountain of vital music. More than perhaps any other artist, Mingus embodied the past, present and future of jazz all at once, finding the threads that led from the Cotton Club to the avant-garde through everything that came between.</p><p>
    It's a favorite jazzhead pastime to sit around debating which was the best of so-and-so's many bands, and Mingus comes up often in those discussions-- he led bands of every size, shape, and instrumentation over the course of more than three decades. While several of his many masterpieces featured large bands, and he's known as a brilliant composer and arranger with a special gift for texture, he was also one of jazz's greatest bass players and a fine pianist who excelled in small group settings. As to which was his best band, his mid-60s sextet is a serious contender.</p><p>
    The sextet was fairly heavily documented in its day on the stage-- <em>The Great Concert of Charles Mingus</em>, recorded in Paris in April of 1964 and finally reissued in 2004 with the full set list, features this band minus trumpeter Johnny Coles, who was incapacitated at the time with a stomach ailment, and it's one of his strongest recordings. Going back in time a few months from that Paris date, the sextet (Dolphy gets billing on this disc mostly because he was too amazing not to) was coming off a residency at the Five Spot where they honed their interaction and discovered each other's tendencies. They played a one-off show at Cornell, which was lost to the ages until Mingus' widow Sue found a tape.
    </p>
<p>
    As a document of the sextet, it's arguably even better than the <em>Great Concert</em>. Unfortunately, there's no mind-blowing version of the latter's ""Parkeriana"" in this set, but it makes up for that loss elsewhere. For something that was apparently never considered for release, this has pristine recording quality, and it includes all of both sets, nearly filling two CDs with just ten different songs. This set captures the band in an expansive mood, exploring the possibilities of Mingus' ingenious compositions (and a few old favorites as well), and for any fan of 60s jazz, it's a wonder to behold.
    </p>
<p>
    The first thing you hear on disc one actually isn't the sextet. It's pianist Jaki Byard playing ""ATFW You"" (ATFW stands for Art Tatum Fats Waller) on his own to begin the set. The perennially underrated Byard, who was born in the same year as Mingus, 1922, could play deftly in virtually any style. He'd sometimes jump from one idiom to another in the middle of a chorus, stringing together quotes from throughout popular music (such as on this version of ""Fables of Faubus"" where in his solo he goes from ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" to ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" to Chopin's ""Funeral March"" with the ease of someone twirling a radio dial).
    </p>
<p>
    Mingus does his own solo thing on Duke Ellington's ""Sophisticated Lady"". Rock-oriented music fans might hear ""five-minute bass solo"" and cringe, but this is a truly lyrical reading of the tune that swings effortlessly. The band of Mingus, Coles, Byard, tenor saxophonist Clifford Jordan, drummer Dannie Richmond, and Dolphy on flute, alto sax, and bass clarinet practically plays with one mind on the rest of the tracks, a few of which are truly gargantuan. Their seventeen-minute charge through Billy Strayhorn's ""Take the A Train"" is like an exploded diagram of the tune, as the band carves it up, the arrangement constantly shifting. Dolphy's trademark extramusical noises make an appearance as he snorts, grunts and audibly breathes his way through the central climax, singing through his sax.
    </p>
<p>
    The centerpiece of the entire performance, though, is ""Meditations"", more commonly known as ""Meditations on Integration"". The sextet takes you on a half-hour trip through some of Mingus' finest themes, opening with a haunting figure played on arco bass and flute that sounds like something out of a half-remembered dream of Claude Debussy. ""So Long Eric"", conceived as a temporary goodbye letter for the woodwind player, who had decided to stay in Europe indefinitely after the band's upcoming tour there, would unexpectedly acquire the air of a sad tribute only months later, when Dolphy lapsed into a sudden diabetic coma in Berlin and passed away at the age of 36. The impact of the loss of Dolphy so early is incalculable-- he was a truly original voice on any instrument he touched and cut precious few sessions as a leader.
    </p>
<p>
    And that's a part of what made the sextet so special-- it was a band full of distinctive instrumentalists who together made something on the borderline of magic. This set captures them at their finest, still caught in the adventure of learning, but sure enough to make every note count.<br/>

    It's startling to hear Judee Sill speak on <em>Live in London</em>. She's been gone nearly 30 years, and the circumstances of her death-- an overdose that may or may not have been accidental-- play into her cult as surely as do the circumstances of her life. She had an unsettled upbringing, turned to prostitution to feed her drug habit, and then went to jail, where she experienced a type of epiphany and so began writing songs and living up to her vast musical talent. She wrote for the Turtles, signed to David Geffen's Asylum Records, and became something of a legend in the Los Angeles of the late 1960s and early 70s. Her redemption through music would seem too easy and too pat were it not for the fact that she wrote luminous folk-gospel songs whose intricacies never lessen their impact. Nevertheless, today she lives on almost solely through her music, thanks largely to Water Records' reissues of her two proper albums, the odds-and-ends <em>Dreams Come True</em> (with its ecstatic opener ""That's the Spirit""), and now <em>Live in London: The BBC Recordings 1972-1973</em>, a compilation of three live radio performances.</p><p>
    Sill speaks so differently than she sings. Explaining the origins and meanings of her songs, she rambles and peppers her speech with ""um's"" and awkward pauses; her jokes rarely hit their mark, which she seems to foresee about halfway through, so that the conclusions are rushed and self-conscious. She sounds like neither a star nor a cult figure, but simply a woman who is a little nervous in front of an audience or perhaps a little too self-serious. In her interview with the BBC's Bob Harris, she consistently misinterprets his questions, giving half-answers or taking off on barely relevant tangents. When she sings and plays guitar or piano, however, that unease falls away. She's perfectly at home in song.</p><p>
    For her contemporary audience, however, this is one of very few opportunities to hear her speak. Furthermore, it's one of the few opportunities to hear her talk about herself. Despite her tumultuous life, which could have fueled countless autobiographical songs, Sill rarely wrote confessionals, instead penning spiritual inquisitions. ""Jesus Was a Cross Maker"" and ""The Kiss"" both consider the intersections between holy love and worldly love, and ""Enchanted Sky Machines"", she explains, is about flying saucers rescuing the sensitive people at the end of the world. Appropriately, she sounds liveliest when she's at her piano (which she learned at reform school), pounding out galloping gospel licks for ""The Donor"" and 50s r&amp;b rhythms on all three versions of ""Down Where the Valleys Are Low"".
    </p>
<p>
    Sill's three appearances on the BBC were recorded within a year of each other, which meant she was pulling from the same pool of songs. As a result, <em>Live in London</em> is heavily repetitive: of the seventeen tracks (not counting the interview), there are only ten different songs. This might have made historical sense if the compilers had kept each set distinct and chronological, especially given that Sill's mood seems to change dramatically from one appearance to another. Instead, the sequencing is out of order, interrupting one set with songs from another even as it enables the strong opening of ""Jesus Was a Cross Maker"" (from her first appearance) and ""Lady-O"" (from her second). This might seem like a negligible matter, but in blurring the timeline, it takes the timid, endearing Sill out of her true context and muddies what could have been a truly revealing artifact.

    There really ought to be more bands like Young Marble Giants, which doesn't mean that there ought to be more bands that <em>sound</em> like Young Marble Giants. They came out of the nowheresville of Cardiff, Wales; they didn't particularly have a local scene to buoy them up, or a niche to fit into. What they had was an aesthetic that was totally theirs, a sound and style that essentially had no antecedents. Play any six seconds of any YMG song and you'll know exactly who you're listening to, and probably be thunderstruck by its unsentimental beauty of tone.</p><p>
    In a year when everyone was trying to make a big noise-- but isn't that every year?-- YMG switched tactics, forcing their audience to lean in to hear them. It's not simply that they were quiet, although substituting a drum machine that sounded like it had a thick quilt on top of it for a human drummer was a radical move at the time. They weren't even all <em>that</em> quiet-- they were just in love with negative space, and their lyrics were so much about things unsaid that the space was formally appropriate. Stuart Moxham flicks at his guitar like a card-shark snapping out an ace, amplifying the impact of his pick on the strings as much as the notes themselves; his brother Philip Moxham bangs at his bass, then lets the sound decay. Alison Statton's not an affectless singer, exactly, but her chief weapon is understatement. She knows how angry Stuart's songs are, and just barely hints at that fury, in a voice that suggests someone finding the courage to say something she's needed to say for a while and has only one chance to get right.</p><p>
    What's sort of shocking about their sole album, actually, is how full of rage it is, and how many ways the band manages to translate that rage into something that's not the way the rock idiom usually expresses it. <em>Colossal Youth</em> ticks like a not-yet-exploded bomb. In theory, ""Include Me Out"" is a mighty garage-rocker, something the Stones or Count Five could've played with a sneer and a great big beat; the Giants strip it of virtually all its audible violence, reducing its rhythm to a muffled thump. ""Credit in the Straight World"" is a vicious little song about the relationship between subculture and mass culture, and it's all tension, no release, with a riff that keeps landing a half-step above where it should resolve. (The caterwauling Hole cover of it, from <em>Live Through This</em>, demonstrates that you could fill in all the space in Stuart Moxham's songs and still have something impressive.)</p><p>
    There's another space in the center of these songs, though: a pervasive sense of lost youth, toward which most of their fury is directed. ""Young"" and ""youth"" turn up in the band name and album title (both were taken from a description of a classical statue), and Statton was only 20 when they got together. But Stuart Moxham's fixation on a moment of perfection he could feel slipping away-- ""Salad Days"" is another song title-- is the reason it's poetically apt that the band only made one, exquisite record.</p><p>
    The poetic version, of course, doesn't quite fit the facts. This latest reissue-- we also reviewed the <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/23346-colossal-youth"">previous one</a></strong>-- is a 3xCD model, augmented with the other extant YMG studio recordings (and fascinating Simon Reynolds liner notes). There's not much else in the vault-- two singles (one of them instrumental), a compilation track, a five-song BBC session and a bunch of demos and rehearsal tapes originally issued in 2000 as <em>Salad Days</em>. Aside from the vocal single's apocalyptic fantasy ""Final Day"" and cryptic lament ""Cakewalking"", they add almost nothing of substance to the band's legacy. <em>Colossal Youth</em> is such a bracing artifact, even now, that it begs for context; the other two discs demonstrate that the album is really all the band had to say, and the way they said it best.</p><p>
    Which isn't quite true either. Statton and the Moxhams, fortunately, didn't give up music after Young Marble Giants split up, and there are worthwhile passages in all of their later discographies. (Start by hunting down Weekend's <em>'81 Demos</em> EP.) The five days when <em>Colossal Youth</em> was recorded, though, were the moment when they were sailing painfully and angrily into maturity, staring into a darkness illuminated a flicker at a time by a fire behind them that they knew couldn't last.

    The Brunettes may or may not have more fun than such recent peroxide victims as Posh Spice, Pete Doherty, or Gavin Rossdale (um, surely you remember Mr. Gwen Stefani?), but on their first two, import-only albums, the New Zealand indie pop outfit showed themselves to be indisputably cuter. Led by founding duo Jonathan Bree and Heather Mansfield, the Auckland-based group first brought their Beach Boys- and Phil Spector-influenced songs to the U.S. in support of the Shins in 2005, and return trips have followed with Rilo Kiley and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. The Brunettes' Sub Pop debut, <em>Structure &amp; Cosmetics</em>, downplays the sugary sweetness of its predecessors. It's also one of the year's more accomplished, sonically detailed works of baroque pop.</p><p>
    This is an elaborate studio concoction, bursting with marimba, glockenspiel, banjo, trumpet, woodwinds, and keyboards in addition to the usual guitar, bass and drums. Handclap-happy opener ""Brunettes Against Bubblegum Youth"" (i.e., ""B.A.B.Y."") flaunts its nearly Polyphonic Spree-size arrangement, beginning with eerie synths, guitar harmonics, horns, and a choral ""ahh"" before morphing into a sunshine shout-along with a go-for-broke <em>Abbey Road</em> guitar riff. For a song ostensibly championing bubblegum clichés, it's also subtly offbeat: ""When we're in the spaceship, I know it must be kismet,"" Mansfield cheers. The track merges gradually into ""Stereo (Mono Mono)"", which split-pans Bree and Mansfield's voices and lets them playfully bemoan their separation. Here, the odd acoustic guitar changes, disjointed piano, and cartoonish background voices could've come from Paul McCartney's eccentric 1971 album <em>Ram</em>.</p><p>
    Bree and Mansfield formed the Brunettes in 1998, reputedly from the ashes of a short-lived romance, and much of the band's music plays off the chemistry between the two. Where their previous albums might lean toward <em>Grease</em>-style boy-girl interplay, <em>Structure &amp; Cosmetics</em> more often evokes the cowboy-psych duets of Lee Hazelwood and Nancy Sinatra. Excellent first single ""Her Hairagami Set"" self-referentially epitomizes the band's mix of kid's stuff and rococo; as detective-show piano and additional instrumentation fold up into their own kind of origami, Bree and Mansfield trade lyrics about a girl who buys a QVC-pushed hair makeover kit that supposedly applies the Japanese art to coiffure. The closing title track hearkens back to Hazelwood and Sinatra again, though its tumbleweed spaciousness and rusty harmonica owe a bigger debt to Ennio Morricone. </p><p>
    ""When I sing, I like to sound American,"" Bree explains on 2002 debut <em>Holding Hands, Feeding Ducks</em>-- words he continues to live by on the latest album. Like seminal Kiwi bands the Clean or the Bats, the Brunettes are steeped in U.S. pop and rock. Bree's plainspoken vocal on ""Credit Card Mail Order"" splits the difference between Lou Reed and Jonathan Richman, while moving from ""Crimson and Clover"" guitars to schmaltzy '50s harmonies. The Brunettes make the anxiety of influence into inconspicuous jokes: ""Stop acting like some modern Don Juan, drawling lines out of rock'n'roll songs,"" Mansfield teases on ""Wall Poster Star"". It's also easy to hear where the Brunettes fit in beside their Sub Pop brethren. ""Small Town Crew"" begins with unassuming acoustic guitar that could twist into a Shins song, though here we get Scientology references and lush, reverb-drenched orchestration.</p><p>
    The Brunettes don't yet stack up to their well-worn influences, but the ornate studio production and knotty lyrics on <em>Structure &amp; Cosmetics</em> make it an impressive entry nonetheless. Still, it's a little disappointing that the band didn't let more of their past cutesiness shine through, even if that might've resulted in a more divisive full-length. Where 2004 album <em>Mars Loves Venus </em>quoted the Spice Girls and talked of killing Cupid, the latest does that pesky ""maturing"" thing, avoiding outright dorkiness except on cutesy intergalactic love song ""If You Were Alien"". The band's last U.S. tour included an unreleased number dedicated to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, which the band played wearing masks of the <em>Full House</em> twins. The album makes us work a lot harder for our fun. It'll be a shame if the Brunettes finally catch on in America at the expense of what makes them unique; it'll be an even bigger shame if they get lost in the indie-pop crowd. Darlings, don't you go and bleach your hair.

Then the listener remembers that Mirah's new record is with Spectratone International, and that its deadpanfully educational take on insect life makes the listener regret wishing that more bands would attempt pedagogy-jams. Los Angeles' Bodies of Water pummels past many more obvious/awesome points of comparison during the course of this preachtastic album-- their reverent throat-throng approach evokes a Monotheistic Spree, their anthemic exponential subchoruses harken back to that first New Pornographers record, and their rousing, art-pop-rock-alyptic ambition suggests an Arcade Fire sparked by a burning bush. And after you accept the wall of vocals into your heart, you've still got to deal with arrangements equal parts Ennio Morricone, <em>Godspell</em>, classic punk, and <em>Ben-Hur</em> soundtrack. Pretty much relentless, this stuff, helped along in tone by a sleeve photo of a celebrant accidentally busting someone in the face while throwing out a joyous arm.</p><p>
    And lo, this act piles on the 'tude. They won't guarantee what tee-shirt color you'll get if you order from their web site, which instructs you to ""deal with it."" Bandleader David Metcalf also offers an online quiz called ""What is wrong with you"" that asks you to ""choose"" a picture each from four pairs. The results section assigns respondents a damning ""type."" For example: ""Type 10-- You are a reactionary. You have limited understanding of issues and make snap judgements based on the vaguest of malformed impressions. You've found that although you cannot make a cogent, rational case for your opinions, people listen to you because you are so emphatic."" That emphaticness reminds me of a certain band's music. Or ""Type 13-- You are bored and listless, yet have neither the courage nor cleverness to change the current state of your life. You have become accustomed to a certain standard of comfort and affluence, and the prospect of frittering this away in pursuit of a future whose grass (you fear) only seems greener is terrible to you.""</p><p>
    Also terrible, to most freethinking folks, is the import of what their MySpace page used to say: The band ""believe(s) that the purpose of life is to align one's individual will with that of God in both thought and deed."" Now their page quotes soap-saint Dr. Bronner and proclaims that, ""Comfort engenders complacency and neglect, while dissatisfaction/ingratitude begets cruelty and self-absorption."" Hey folks, while you're acting like highlanders whose souls never itch or stink, you might consider abandoning Rupert Murdoch's ""place for friends,"" which reeks of mortality. As the ghost of Judas wails in <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>, the lamb itself sidestepped hype machines: ""Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication!""
    </p><p>
    But what a cycle of songs. Throughout, the female vox vary from Go! Team yippeeism to a gloriously bent/oversung mode that approximates Cars/Rentals synths. ""Our Friends Appear Like The Dawn"" sweeps through seven major bible happenings in the first four verses as it uses the plight of Moses to curiously beg the ""Lord"" for an swift end to humanity, which is presented as a kind of botched narrative thread. ""These Are The Eyes"" is an e.e. cummings-quoting basher that'll have you chanting a line you do not at all understand (""Nature forgave but I cannot forget"") with military seriousness. ""I Turned My Face"" could be about a husband choosing his wife (Metcalf's spouse Meredith sings and plays organ) over his faith, or about Christ protecting his (according to scripture) bride, the church, from God's unbearable light, and it ends with a triumphant eleven-bandmember swoon that may as well be soundtracking a Western about the Pixies. ""Roar, Roar, Roar"" succeeds with the same trick; its speakers ""trudge,"" adorned with ""filth and grime,"" as they await a ""dude""-- it works as a chronicle of dreading both monogamy and messiah. The subsequent ""Here Comes My Hand"" continues expounding on this idea that William Butler Yeats and the Christopher Walken <em>Prophecy</em> movies got most right: if you honestly lend your imagination to this mythology, it'd be fucking awful to meet an eternal being from heaven, to whom you'd be like a gnat they couldn't flick for fear of squishing. 
    </p>
<p>
    While the majestic <em>Ears Will Pop &amp; </em><em>Eyes Will Blink</em> is overtly ideologically orthodox enough to appeal to your fundie friend who answers the phone, ""Heaven-o,"" it is less sane and reasonable than, say, the work of Sufjan Stevens. At points it seems to be attempting to reconcile transcendentalism with Christianity, while at other points it argues (via the words and their explosive speak-power-to-power delivery/accompaniment) for further radicalizing. ""We Are Co-Existors"" sounds like a Lennon-esque peaceful protest at its utopian outset (""living here below together/ straining against our worldly tethers"") but erupts into resonant, infectious, separatist dogma (""all resisting Satan's fingers...Holding hands while in the furnace""). 
    </p>
<p>
    Eros even dips an earthy toe into the proceedings. Though ""boots that are knocking"" get presented as a bad thing on an early track, the hottest line of the year (unless you're vegan) is this bit from ""It Is Familiar"": ""When you bend over into the fridge/ And try to grab some Tupperware/ I'll surprise you and pour the half and half/ Onto your newly sunburned neck."" This builds to lotion and ""slick arms"" and ""coming soft down,"" only to suckerpunch with the sermonizing ""You were tricked at some point/ And stopped becoming/ The way that you've been all along."" The listener too feels duped, but by a truth? This rampagingly assured disc is humiliating to merely discuss via laptop, but nothing can prevent its slouch toward Bethlehem to be blogged.

    You hear about an album with guests on nearly every track and expectations usually drop a bit. Variety is good and teamwork is a virtue; still, not many all-timers have ""featuring"" after every song title, and sometimes having more people around seems like a compensation for a lack of ideas. On his third album, <em>Going Places</em>, French-Canadian producer Antoine Bédard, the creative engine driving Montag, makes serial collaboration sound like a good thing. Bédard is working in an area of music-- ambitious twee-leaning laptop pop-- that seems made for smaller doses. Even when the songs are good, you don't necessarily expect to listen to a record like <em>Going Places</em> all the way through. So having new voices and a different texture or two cropping up helps to differentiate the tracks. And the guests are carefully integrated into Montag's production framework, so the end result is never haphazard.</p><p>
    The guest-heavy record could also be up to Bédard knowing his limitations. He records his quiet, sometimes whispered voice well, imparting enough reverb to disguise its limited range. But still, the expressive possibilities <em>are</em> limited, which is why it's nice to see what others can do with Bédard's often-clever production. And the record certainly sounds nice. He's previously arranged strings for M83, so he has a good understanding of how pieces fit together, and a sense of what to leave out. There's no feeling here that however many dozen tracks available on computer need necessarily be used; the music has room the breathe.</p><p>
    Speaking of M83, that project's Anthony Gonzales guests on the grand opening statement ""I Have Sound"", which sounds like a Who title and happens to be one of the album's better tracks. Blending his voice with Bédard's to create a pillow-soft texture with a cathedral's reverberations, Gonzales also adds his characteristic spacey keyboards to the an acoustic guitar-heavy mix. The blending of natural and electronic instruments, along with the lush soundstage, call to mind Air, though of course it doesn't come over like it was mixed and mastered in a high-end studio. Still, ""I Have Sound"" holds its own as a sonic treat, and Gonzales' contributions are key. 
    </p>
<p>
    Other collaborators include Owen Pallett of Final Fantasy (vocals on the wanna-be Bacharach ""Softness, I Forgot Your Name""), Victoria Legrand of Beach House (her voice swirled through loping psych-ballad ""&gt;[Plus Grand Que]""), and Au Revoir Simone, with a cameo on electro-pop-leaning ""No One Else"". The latter two spots are pretty minimal-- you can barely hear Legrand, and Au Revoir Simone only stick around for a verse-- which unfortunately allows the songs to retreat to a pleasant but bland place. But enough moments like the sweetly busy, mini-Caribou confection ""Mechanical Kids"", with backing vocals by Amy Millan of Stars, keep the record on the right course. The closing title track allegedly features music from 70 musicians spanning 15 countries, submitted in response to general call-out for sound from Bédard. That it doesn't sound appreciably different from one of his solo productions says something about his discipline as a producer, and also how tightly he clings to his vision. </p></div>"|10526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10526-going-places/|6.8|Mark Richardson

    King Wilkie are young vets of the bluegrass circuit, proud purveyors of a tradition that until relatively recently was primarily the province of hippies, NPR listeners, and Civil War reenactors. But the Charlottesville, Va., band isn't strictly a bluegrass outfit. At least not anymore. You could belatedly credit the success of Alison Krauss or <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em> or generally cite long-simmering trends, but the gates have been opened and an entire legion of bluegrass bands have emerged squinting into the light, blinded not just by the wide array of music out there but the number of acts who have enlisted the traits of bluegrass to serve their various purposes, not least some modicum of commercial gain.</p><p>
    Yet only a myopic bluegrass shut-in would consider King Wilkie's second disc <em>Low Country Suite</em> any sort of radical statement. There's not a single note, tone, or sentiment here that you haven't heard a hundred times before. There's nothing particularly ""new"" to the group's blend of folk, bluegrass, blues, and country that you haven't encountered. It's comfort music to the core, not meant to stir so much as soothe in its familiarity.</p><p>
    These truths in and of themselves don't necessarily peg the disc as safe, though, especially in a day and age when it's probably easier (and certainly more fashionable) to shake things up a bit and revel in post-modern play-acting or appropriation. That <em>Low Country Suite</em> does none of this, and indeed aims for earnest authenticity, constitutes a great deal of its welcome charm. If some read that charm as tedium, well, then so be it. Put yourself in the mindset of one of those bluegrass shut-ins, however, and you can better appreciate what King Wilkie are trying to do with and within one of the most conservative musical forms.
    </p>
<p>
    For starters, the tempos are slower, more subdued and resigned, a respite from the flashy, oft frantic picking of bluegrass. Beyond that, the band's more or less standard bluegrass instrumentation-- guitar, violin, banjo, upright bass, mandolin, etc.-- is enlisted in service of a stylistic palette a tad broader and more subtle than the usual bluegrass suspects, too. ""The Raising of the Patriarchs"" is hushed, pure, molasses-slow melancholia, replete with spare organ and wistful piano plinks. ""Millie's Song"", like a few other tracks, is just a backbeat away from a 1970s country-rock song. Elsewhere the album nods to such hybrid predecessors as the Band (""Angeline"", ""Crazy Daisy"") and Lyle Lovett (""Ms. Peabody"").
    </p>
<p>
    Singers John McDonald and Reid Burgess swap lead duties and, when they sing together, stick to close harmonies. But neither is a vocal showoff. In fact, their relatively modest voices help keep the disc honest, along with simple, melodic playing that leaves little room for soloing.
    </p>
<p>
    All the same, what's missing from the music is any sort of grit. The almost crystalline clarity of <em>Low Country Suite</em> is something to relish on a good stereo, but Jim Scott's production nonetheless comes off a little sterile. It's a bit like a window polished so clear the glass may as well not be there. Had King Wilkie instead kept some of the dirt, dust, and grime on there, their incessantly downbeat dusk-music may indeed have come off as radical as intended, straddling generations instead of sticking comfortably to the sound of the here and now.

After playing the definitive slacker role in <em>Reality Bites</em>, Hawke went on to branch out into the type of diverse résumé that earns an actor equal amounts scorn and neglect: quitting the biz to go back to college Rivers Cuomo-style, penning a novel, and getting into directing. Hawke indulged so many side interests that I was downright shocked not to find a band in his Wikipedia entry; I guess I had conflated him with fellow travelers Keanu Reeves and Jared Leto. But now, with the soundtrack of the film version of his first novel, <em>The Hottest State</em>, Hawke is finally living up to the last part of the bargain, putting his music taste on public display.</p><p>
    And...it's terrible. <em>The Hottest State</em> soundtrack features a roster of acts old and newish that would draw the envy of Cmdr. Braff: Bright Eyes, Feist, Cat Power, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, etc. But rather than culling the castaway B-sides from this posse, Hawke organizes a tribute session to none other than Jesse Harris-- that's right, <em>the</em> Jesse Harris. You may best know Harris as Norah Jones' guitar player, but he has a solo career in his own right, playing exceptionally harmless jazzy folk/folky jazz in the vein of James Taylor. So basically, Ethan Hawke (and all these other artists, apparently) have all the cutting-edge and adventurous preferences of, say, my Mom's bunko group.</p><p>
    I mean, Jesus Christ Superstar, this music is boring. I've always found it hard to hate on the phenomenon of Norah Jones, because dentists' offices need new cuts too. But to find people I respect, like Chan Marshall or Brad Mehldau or M. Ward, sinking to this milquetoast level is a bit of a wet willy, even if I shouldn't be that shocked. Nothing about the material covered on this OST suggests why Harris is worthy of such in-depth love: Every song is sparse and languid, with no distinctive melodies or memorable lyrics or really anything to distinguish itself. Like Jones, Harris (who has three tracks of his own on the disc) seems best at merely establishing a mood, one that's mellow and pleasant but wallflowery through and through-- perfect for a dinner party or a book club, where you want to fill the awkward silences with the musical equivalent of a screensaver.
    </p><p>
    Whether it's perfect for Hawke's film, I don't know; full disclosure, I haven't seen it, and don't really plan to. I mean: ""A young actor from Texas tries to make it in New York while struggling in his relationship with a beautiful singer/songwriter?"" Yeah...no. But apropos of the title, there is something humid and warm about the entire record, though it's entirely possible that reaction is due to writing this review in a Chicago August. Things are pretty hazy and acoustic and whispery throughout, with only Bright Eyes and the Black Keys bothering with drums and amps. Bright Eyes' track, ""Big Old House"", is the standout here, stretching the song to a quavering Arcade Fire scope that's only lacking a string section for true liftoff. 
    </p>
<p>
    Far less enthralling are contributions from Feist, M. Ward, Cat Power, and other indie folksters, most of which are merely vocal exercises over spare piano or guitar that come off either intimate or tossed-off, depending on your mood. That their efforts cozy up so seamlessly with the smooth-soft tones of Norah Jones and Argentinean singer Rocha is a bit disconcerting, putting the lie once again to the idea that there's really any significant sonic walls between Nu-Verve/Grammy-certified Charmin and the preeminent singer-songwriters of the indie world. As such, it's an act of unintentional indie-fan bubble-bursting as effective as a <em>Music from the O.C. </em>collection or Braff's most notorious soundtrack efforts, maybe even more <em>Garden State</em> than <em>Garden State</em> in its senseless damage to the forces of elitism. Way to go, Hawke, show that pretender who occupied the lovably rumpled renaissance slacker throne first.

Slightly meatier than her work for Azure Ray, <em>Set the Woods on Fire</em> still retains an acoustic-based, cotton-puff delicacy, with a country tinge to the ballads and the pleasant, sultry effect of Fink's voice. But the content itself, both lyrically and melodically, ranges from catchy to drab to vaguely revelatory to overly earnest. To create atmosphere is one thing, but too often it's foggy and merely suggestive.</p><p>
    The album's title track boasts hefty guitar hooks and a strong, supportive percussion section, but the kick-drum heartbeat at the start gives way to a crash of cymbals and a dull chorus-- a recurring climax that tries too hard to slam its meaning home (""Set the woods on fire,"" repeat). Similarly, opener ""Time Gets Us All"" is monotonous in message and melody, the lazy, pulsating piano begging the question, Yes, time gets us all, so what? More successful is ""Our Addictions"", which adds electric guitar and trickling piano to soaring back-up vocals and a generally softer approach to singing, which crops up occasionally elsewhere. But as is the case with many of these songs, they start strong and energetic but topple at the chorus. Verse and bridge conspire to build us up, but the chorus's riffs, particularly on ""Addictions"", are underdeveloped and rote.</p><p>
    Balladic waltz ""Anything You Love"" has the haunting, smoky room quality of the other tracks, but drops much of the electricity for what's essentially a vocal-driven<em></em> performance-- shakers, acoustic guitar, slide, and a bit of accordion never steal the show or adding any distracting weight to the mix. Fink's strength is in the higher ranges, where her voice is at its most porous yet most affecting, conducting the melody for the other instruments to simply sink into. Creepy harmonies in fourths and a wash of electric guitar on ""Spirit, Run"" attempts to add a dank, droning Neko Case-like element only hinted at on the other tracks, but there is a cloying passion to the vocals here that is better used on the mournful, pared-down ""Precious Pearl"", which-- with its climbing, wandering vocals-- shows how a swooning musical understatement can work. To hear Fink's voice alone with shy, tinselly percussion in the shadows is to see the fog of this album lift, if only momentarily.<br/></p></div>"|10514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10514-set-the-woods-on-fire/|5.4|Liz Colville

But it was a golden age for sci-fi in pop music: Between the unbridled creativity of Sun Ra's Philadelphia years, the development of Parliament's intergalactic mythos, and David Bowie being David Bowie, there were plenty of artists who saw something promising outside the bounds of Earth.</p><p>
    And aside from Sun Ra, few artists captured that sense of mind-warping, my-God-it's-full-of-stars astronomical mysticism in their music like Hawkwind. With their tendency towards extended jams full of disorienting electronic drones and drummer Simon King's motorik rhythms, they had a certain creative kinship with their Krautrock contemporaries. But their racket could also be as unrelentingly punchy and violent as anything from the Stooges'<em> Fun House</em>, especially considering guitarist Dave Brock's Ron Asheton-esque affinity for blistering, wah-wah-drenched riffs and Nik Turner's freeform sax outbursts, which were more Steve MacKay than John Gilmore. It was all put to good use by their lyrics and their philosophy, much of which was inspired by the writing of sci-fi author and sometime collaborator Michael Moorcock, and typically themed around interstellar travel, metaphysics and Pythagoras' theory of celestial-mathematical ""music of the spheres.""</p><p>
    If this all seems a bit dense and weird and impenetrable, rest assured that Hawkwind's arcanum isn't too difficult to get caught up in, especially via their circa-1972 lineup-- which delivered plenty of straightforward rock riffage amidst all the special effects and featured, amongst the aforementioned personnel, a former rhythm guitarist turned bassist named Lemmy Kilmister. <em>Space Ritual</em>, recorded over two separate concert dates in London and Liverpool in December 1972, is a solid effort at capturing what made Hawkwind a cult favorite, and the Collector's Edition pads it out just enough to keep things from being too overwhelming. The set has been expanded from its original ""88 minutes of brain damage"" (as a 1973 print ad hilariously put it) to just over two hours, with most of the added material devoted to a few alternate takes and the restoration of a few minutes here and there that had to be cut for the original United Artists double LP. (A bonus DVD includes the whole shebang in Dolby, and despite it being in PAL format, North American viewers should be able to hear it on their PCs or DVD players.) The flow of the concert typically alternates between spoken-word passages about time, space and the future, delivered with ominous camp by resident poet Robert Calvert, and extended, high-velocity performances of material from their '72 album <em>Doremi Fasol Latido</em>, with a handful of non-album tracks thrown in for good measure. Everything you need to glean from this album can be heard in the first 20 minutes: The <em>Electric Ladyland</em>-esque hue and cry of the distortion-heavy opening cut ""Earth Calling"", the 10-minute ""T.V. Eye""-gone-starfighting assault of  ""Born to Go"", the rumbling vortex of bass in ""Down Through the Night"" and the Calvert space-voyage poem ""The Awakening"" (""Landing itself was nothing/We touched upon a shelf of rock/selected by the automind/And left a galaxy of dreams behind..."").</p><p>
    But stopping after there would be a waste, and while it takes a certain dedication to see this album through in its entirety-- if no drugs are immediately available, <em>Space Ritual</em> also works as background music while you read Jack Kirby comics-- its singleminded, ceaseless momentum is too powerful to become tedious. Lemmy and King provide a lot of that force: Kilmister was a recent convert to bass about a year previous to the album's recording, and his tendency to play it like a blunt instrument suits the material well, especially when he sets about on one of his trademark idling-dragster solos. (His sparring with Turner's sax on ""Lord of Light"" is especially impressive, and serves as an early sign of things to come with Motörhead a few years down the line.) King has one real nifty trick on the drums-- a machine-gun roll that he hammers out at least a dozen times in every song-- and even though it starts to stick out as a bit of a crutch, the fact that it sounds exhilarating every single time attests to his sense of knowing just where to drop that crescendo, and it helps the nearly ten minutes of ""Brainstorm"" fly by quickly. Brock's guitar, meanwhile, holds the odd position of  transforming over the course of a song into a sort of ambient noise, since its riffs are typically doubled up and sometimes overwhelmed by Lemmy's bass; the moments where it sounds like his wah-wah's congealing into Dik Mik's whirring, searing electronic effects are some of the most captivatingly strange sounds on the record.</p><p>
    There's a couple detours from their full-speed-ahead acid-punk-- the catchy Wilhelm Reich tribute/Canned Heat knockoff ""Orgone Accumulator"", the cro-mag vertigo doom-blues of ""Upside Down"", the slow, zero-G boil of ""Space Is Deep""-- but none of it seems like digression for its own sake. Even Calvert's poems, which skew a little portentous sometimes (""Welcome to the oceans in a labeled can/ Welcome to the dehydrated lands/ Welcome to the south police parade/ Welcome to the neo-golden age""), add a bit of linguistic substance to an album more memorable for its riffs than its simple, usually flatly-sung lyrics. <em>Space Ritual</em> isn't a prog-rock showcase-- most of its best moments come from intensity rather than chops-- but it's one of rock's greatest attempts to connect with the rest of the universe. Steppenwolf sang about how it would feel to ""fire all of your guns at once and explode into space""; this album actually gives a good idea of what that would truly sound like.<br/></p></div>"|10512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10512-space-ritual-collectors-edition/|8.6|Nate Patrin

    It doesn't take much to make a great rock'n'roll record, but to succeed at getting the most out of not a lot, an act's got to have guts. That's what fueled such self-styled 1960s primitives as the Stooges and the VU through the Jesus and Mary Chain. Not technical innovation, per se, not instrumental skills, not necessarily even melodies, but guts. Guts to play like the music you're making is the greatest the world has ever heard even if deep down you suspect it'll take a few decades for everyone to catch on, if they ever do at all.</p><p>
    Like countless others, Miss Alex White &amp; the Red Orchestra owe a debt to all of the above; needless to say, like those countless others, they don't come close to their idols, either. But <em>Space &amp; Time</em> propels itself along with such heart, such swagger, and such, yes, guts that its shortcomings don't really matter. For a tidy half hour or so, it's the greatest thing in the world.</p><p>
    As befits White's placement on the In The Red roster, <em>Space &amp; Time</em> begins pushing the limits of comfortable fidelity and rarely lets up for a breather for its duration. At a little over a minute long, ""In the Snow"" is all overdriven guitars, steady rumbling drums, pounding piano, and White's own attitude-drenched wail, dropping you right into the middle of the maelstrom, an audacious start to any record. As if to punctuate the point, the disc quickly continues with ""I Dig History"", just a few well chosen chords, repetitive bass, and enough of a racket (including some buried maracas) to make it a perfect set closer instead moved up front and shoved in your face.
    </p>
<p>
    Horns appear on ""Future Talk"", like the Stones at their most stoned with Jagger's vocals replaced with White's sweet but tough girl-group styled bark and an overdriven guitar solo that ultimately steamrolls over the brass honks and blurts. ""I'm not sure I understand/ What it takes to be a man,"" White shouts out from the murk. ""I don't know why you can't try,"" goes the withering payoff.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Submarine"" slows things down to a mere trot, Velvet Underground-style, the four-minute length downright epic compared to the bubblegum garage fuzz of ""She Wanna"", the galloping ""Trash Bag"", and the concentrated raw power of ""Candy"". Lest you think the pretty chords and opening tremolo of ""Poison Arrow"" will evince a change of pace, don't worry. Thirty seconds in it erupts into a more familiar squall.
    </p>
<p>
    The downside of such a gleefully abrasive back-to-basics devil-may-care parade is that any deviation from form, like the comparatively leisurely ""Lips &amp; Crime"", comes off a relative drag. But those tiny little moments pass quickly. With 33 minutes to work with there's not a lot of room to mess around. Hell, keeping things so to the point while maintaining an over-the-top approach underscores that messing around is the last thing White and crew are up to.
    </p>
<p>
    Indeed, this is Delta Force rock delivered with a smile: In and out before you even know it, inflicting maximum damage and satisfaction while it's there before fading out. Your ears will hate you for it, but your heart will love you. And your guts, well, they'll churn in appreciation at the fun slash and burn guitar violence of it all.

Steeped in France's chanson tradition of forlorn radio poetry, they also revealed a quirky, world-traveler sensibility, shaped by German cabaret and British trip-hop. Worldliness aside, all of the songs felt like love songs. But their drowsy pessimism, thick in every verse and chord, threw back to psychedelia's dark side, the slow-dance of heroin chic, winding from Mazzy Star back to the Velvet Underground.</p><p>
    On her self-titled fifth album, Keren Ann crafts this spirit-- or spiritlessness-- into a ragged, shadowy baroque, where songs may tumble in over harmonicas or drift off with a choir. It's a dark brand of nostalgia that isn't suited to feel-good arrangements. This hints at why the sprightly organs of ""Between the Flatland and the Caspian Sea"" seem like empty gestures of homage, half-hearted flourishes on a watery epic: she doesn't do uplift.</p><p>
    Gloom, midnight ennui, heartache: That's her domain. Here, the best stretches of dusky, heartland noir stay within these emotional borders, finding an unmistakably American blend of the shabby and the genteel. Witness the thick hunk of ornery Delta sass, ""It Ain't No Crime"", go for  tattered elegance, decorating filthy blues riffs with Keren Ann's smoldering, breathy accents. No less defiant, ""Lay Your Head Down"" takes cues from Lou Reed's troupe of Manhattan anti-hippies, reenacting  Nico's fallen-angel delivery and the subway chug of ""I'm Waiting for the Man"". </p><p>
    Keren Ann, of course, doesn't traffic in drug stories. Her big theme, if she has one, is the agony after ecstasy, the post-love story. That's where the numbness, the languor, the trancelike lassitude comes from: wreckage. Steadfastly hostile to love stories, she deluges listeners instead with snapshots of hearts pronounced dead on arrival (""It's All a Lie"") and, in ""The Harder Ships of the World"", the charms of a cold-shouldered ex. Healthy hearts might tire of Keren Ann's pitch-black take on romance-- her discography feels like one merciless siege of the concept-- but that's just one tile in the mosaic. She's not quite Catherine Breillat.</p><p>
    Outside the bittersweet standouts, Keren Ann's sweet nothings begin to rot the teeth, as they slide dangerously close to coffee-shop Americana, as sketched by Slate's Jody Rosen. Who wouldn't prefer their urbane joe, after all, with a shot of soft-strummed languor (""In Your Back"") or shoegaze inspired by the <em>Good Will Hunting</em> soundtrack (""Liberty"")?

    Names don't seem to be terribly important to Jason Molina.
    He began recording under various guises during the mid-1990s and released his
    first album as Songs: Ohia in 1997. Earlier this decade, he unceremoniously
    changed the band's name to the Magnolia Electric Company (such that Songs: Ohia's
    final album, called <em>The Magnolia Electric
    Company,</em> is often filed under both S and M). Recently, whether by choice or
    by common usage, both the <em>The</em> and the
    <em>mpany</em> have been dropped, leaving only
    Magnolia Electric Co. It's not as drastic as the moniker-shifting of Will
    Oldham, but it is interesting
    considering that Molina (who also releases under his own name) is the
    sole long-term member of Magnolia Electric Co.</p><p>
    That most recent incarnation of the name appears on every
    piece of the <em>Sojourner</em> box set-- the
    wooden container, the five discs, their popcorn-bag-style sleeves, the postcard
    tracklists, even the pewter medallion. Only the fold-out map of the stars
    carries no insignia, which seems vaguely appropriate. This branding implies a
    more rooted identity, but Molina apparently knows that names changes as easily
    and as quickly as the scenery, and one assumes that for him it's never the same
    from one day to the next. It's difficult to tell whether his nomadic lifestyle
    (he tours nearly constantly) is the impetus behind his music, which obsesses
    over displacement through lunar and celestial imagery, as if he's constantly
    navigating by the stars. Or perhaps it's the other way around: Maybe his
    musical fascinations demand displacement and rootlessness. Like Isaac Brock in
    the 1990s, Molina is concerned with constant motion through an American
    landscape. His albums, and especially <em>Sojourner</em>,
    are postmillennial road-trip art-rock, albeit in a very traditionalist, rather
    than an existential, vein.</p><p>
    Molina's view of the country has more in common with Dust
    Bowl itinerants or even nineteenth-century landscape painters than with most current
    touring acts. <em>Sojourner</em> is his
    largest canvas yet, and perhaps his most detailed and deliberate. The
    4xCD/1xDVD set culls tracks from the four recording sessions that fed his 2006
    album, <em>Fading Trails,</em> and yet, these
    generous odds and ends make for a better listening experience than the release
    for which they were intended. Perhaps it's the length: Molina's musings sound
    like products of long drives spent looking at barren scenery, and it often
    seems like that's how they're best consumed and considered. <em>Sojourner</em> will get you pretty far. 
    </p>
<p>
    So let's start in Memphis:
    <em>Sun Sessions</em> is the shortest disc in the
    set, with only four patiently paced songs forming a solid EP. With its full
    sound that plays into the local mood without trying to re-create Bluff City
    sounds, ""Talk to Me Devil, Again"" goes down to the crossroads, but ""Hold on
    Magnolia"" and the traditional ""Trouble in Mind"" extol the virtues of strength,
    perseverance, and hard-won hope-- the last a rarity for Molina. ""I won't be
    blue always,"" he sings on ""Trouble in Mind"", finding solace in the century-old
    words. ""You know the sun is going to shine in my backdoor someday.""
    </p>
<p>
    Not everything is so rosy: ""Everything in its place,"" Molina
    sings on ""Steady Now"", the opening track on <em>Shohola</em>.
    ""The world does have to end in pain."" Featuring Molina accompanied only by his
    guitar and the roomy hiss of the recorder, <em>Shohola</em>
    is lonely and quiet like his 2006 vinyl-only album <em>Let Me Go Let Me Go Let Me Go,</em> although never quite as intense.
    It's a perfect setting for his off-kilter vocals, which are often compared to
    Neil Young despite not sounding very much like that grizzled Canadian. On
    ""Spanish Moon Fall and Rise"" and ""The Lamb's Song"" he sounds just barely on
    key, with a steeliness in his voice that is often mistaken for detachment. But
    here even his breaths are audible as he tentatively picks his way through
    ""Night Country"" and ""Shiloh Temple Bell"", as if driving down some dark road. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Nashville Moon</em> and
    <em>The Black Ram</em> both return Molina to a
    full-band setting. The former, produced by Steve Albini, emphasizes his
    classic-rock chops on ""Lonesome Valley""
    and ""Texas 71"", allowing for
    jammy passages, short guitar solos, and underlinable declarations like ""I make
    my mistakes on my own time."" The band is especially solid, most notably Mark
    Rice's drums and Mike ""Slo-Mo"" Brenner's stately pedal and lap steel, but
    there's an almost self-consciously workmanlike spirit to these dozen road hymns,
    as if Albini is highlighting a blue-collar ethos in Molina's words. The
    straightforward arrangements on ""Hammer Down"" and ""Don't Fade on Me"" strengthen
    their impact, however, and the clear, clean melodic lines tie all the songs
    together, almost too neatly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Black Ram</em> is
    something weirder altogether, and the most satisfying disc in the set. David
    Lowery's production highlights the odd and the atmospheric in Molina's music,
    creating a weary travelogue that strives to pinpoint the epic in the everyday. The
    title track clamors dramatically, the guitars on ""What's Broken Becomes Better""
    churn tensely, and ""Will-O-the-Wisp"" sounds like a Morricone soundtrack for
    some unfilmed Western. It's a long drive for someone with too much to think
    about.
    </p>
<p>
    The DVD, titled <em>The
    Road Becomes What You Leave</em>, wraps all these disparate approaches together
    as Molina and his road band travel through cold, rural Canada and play a few of
    these compositions. But it only points out how different these four discs are
    and how multifaceted and expandable Molina's seemingly limited artistry can be.
    Spanning multiple styles and states as it maps out both a personal and a
    national landscape, the set is perhaps accidentally one of the strongest
    releases of his career, despite its catch-all organization. Molina still sounds
    rootless and displaced, but <em>Sojourner</em>
    triangulates a place that's as close to home as he ever seems to get.

    Between 1976 and 1978,
    Lee Perry was at the
    peak of his creative powers-- and his acid consumption. This is when
    the apocrypha was born-- Perry might've burned down his
    Black Ark studio after liberally pooping in it for years; he might've
    walked backwards and hit the ground with a hammer. He definitely put
    mirrors all over his clothing, claimed to have extraterrestrial help
    at the mixing board, and made a bunch of records. Despite reputation
    for general whacked-outness, the Black Ark classics-- Max Romeo's
    <em>War Inna Babylon</em>, Junior Murvin's falsetto textbook
    <em>Police and Thieves</em>, and The Congos' <em>Heart of the
    Congos</em>, Perry's own <em>Roast Fish, Collie Weed &amp;
    Cornbread</em>-- weren't sound-qua-sound adventures, they
    were strong songs smeared by a fearless, extremely stoned hand.</p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
<em>Ape-ology</em>
    reissues <em>Roast Fish</em> (originally rejected by Island Records'
    Chris Blackwell), along with 1976's <em>Super Ape</em> and 1978's
    <em>Return of the Super Ape</em> (also rejected, somewhat less
    surprisingly). <em>Super Ape </em>is a common gateway for the Perry
    experience because it's overtly badass: A friend recently told
    me about discovering the album as an adolescent, saying, ""I
    wasn't sure which was the best one, so I just bought the one
    with the comic-book gorilla smoking a gigantic joint on the cover.""
    A stoned gorilla is a workable analogy: <em>Super Ape</em> is heavy,
    hairy, slow, warm, pulsing, and only part human. Nothing takes
    precedence in a Perry mix; each sound seems to disappear into
    another. The psychedelic tension here is rhythmic; the literal,
    locked groove of the bass and drums bounce under a swirling mess of
    sounds overhead. Even the vocal chants by Full Experience and the
    Heptones (whose <em>Party Time </em>is unfairly overlooked in the roll
    of Perry's Black Ark work) drift off into, apparently, nothing.
    Not to be unfair to the spookier cutting-room treats of <em>Return</em>,
    but a better title would've been, I dunno, <em>Footprints of the
    Super Ape</em> or <em>Bugs Picked Off Super Ape's Back </em>or
    something. Shove it to the second disc. It's alright.</p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    What needs more love is
    <em>Roast Fish. </em>Lee Perry is not an awesome singer. He makes this
    apparent within thirty seconds. But nobody-- not Junior Murvin,
    not Max Romeo, not Bob Marley-- could make ""Soul Fire""
    sound as haywire as Perry does. And because he's free from the responsibility of wrapping his crooners in velvet, he can cover his own record in grunts and hissing noises. And babies crying. What might be a cow. He
    can use auto maintenance as a metaphor for personal hygiene and
    fitness. This is sort of like when Brian Wilson got fat and started
    singing about vegetables. Perry either says ""drink some
    whiskey"" or ""drink some fishy,"" neither of which
    sounds like good advice. But like any diligent stoner, he falls
    quickly from the ecstatic to the fearful-- ""Evil
    Tongue"" is overtly paranoid; the title track is practically
    screwed and chopped. This is where the myths sound real.
    </p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    The problems with
    <em>Ape-ology</em> are the problems with pretty much every Trojan
    collection: It's a sloppy, economical job in an already glutted
    market. The liner notes are bursting with typos. There's no
    roster of musicians, which is just embarrasing-- in the rush to
    fetishize Perry as a producer, someone must've assumed the
    music made itself (doubly galling given that Perry regularly hired
    the best in the country: Bassist Boris Gardiner, drummer Sly Dunbar,
    and guitarist Earl Smith among them-- guys who might warrant
    their own compilations). Also, these albums are all still available
    on CD. But, sigh, not for 20 bucks in one case. A more considered package would've been nice--and worth another five bucks at least-- but in a way, a half-hearted package keeps the myth and context at bay and lets the music bleat, cackle, and fart for itself.

    Blossom Toes were the twee-est band of all
    time-- twice as twee as the Dukes of Stratosphear covering ""(Listen to
    the) Flower People"" in front of an audience of animated chipmunks,
    thrice as twee as a Keane painting magically brought to life by a
    sprinkling of fairy dust and singing the Fluff Fluff Fluff Fluff and
    Cuddleyness catalogue. Originally the Ingoes, one of ten million
    British blues bands who desperately wanted to be the Yardbirds, they
    hooked up with their idols' manager Giorgio Gomelsky; just as flower
    power was taking off, they were directed to become psychedelicists and
    change their name, for reasons having less to do with LSD than
    pounds-shillings-pence.

    In
    the new reissue's liner notes, the Toes claim their songs were all
    written by the time somebody played them an acetate of <em>Sgt. Pepper's</em> in
    the studio. If so, ""Penny Lane""/""Strawberry Fields Forever"" seems to
    have hit them like an acid bomb, because virtually every song here can
    trace its DNA to the Beatles' psychedelic moment, from the harmonies to
    Kevin Westlake's Ringofied drumming to the quick-changing
    orchestrations accompanying the chime of their twelve-string guitars to
    their general sense of persistently tuneful music-hall whimsy as the
    corridor behind the doors of perception.

    They
    don't waste time getting around to it, either: The opening track begins
    with a backwards-guitar fade-in before singer/guitarist Brian Godding
    exclaims ""Look at me I'm you! Look at me I'm you!"" Godding was the
    band's main songwriter, although guitarist Jim Cregan also gets in a
    couple of good ones, especially ""When the Alarm Clock Rings"" (later
    recycled as the closing track of the <em>Nuggets II</em> compilation), and
    Westlake contributes a song called ""The Remarkable Saga of the Frozen
    Dog"", which is as look-at-me-I'm-high as you'd guess.

<div style=""margin: 0px; min-height: 14px"">

<div style=""margin: 0px"">
    And
    virtually everything on the original album works beautifully-- they'd
    spent years streamlining their attack on stage, including a stint
    backing up Sonny Boy Williamson, so the spaced-out playfulness of their
    lyrics and singing is balanced out by fine, tough musicianship. ""Hurry
    up, sleep, take me/Or I'll be late for tea,"" they croon, but even as an
    overdubbed French horn paraphrases the ""Penny Lane"" coda, Westlake and
    bassist Brian Belshaw are playing crushingly hard.

    The
    ten bonus tracks appended here mostly just demonstrate how quickly the
    bloom came off the blossom: a few demos and live tracks meant to
    suggest what the ""real"" Toes sounded like without the album's ludicrous
    overdubs (not nearly as much fun), and a forced-sounding cover of Bob
    Dylan's ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight"" from a 1968 A-side. Two years
    later, they made a heavy, dull second and final album, <em>If Only for a
    Moment</em>, which has also just been reissued; the new edition includes the
    single ""Postcard"", the only trace of whimsy that remained in them after
    <em>Clean</em>.

    The
    summer of 1967 produced lots of phenomena, and the historical condition
    for the Blossom Toes to be not just twee but wonderful might have been
    one of them. The only reasonable response in 2007 to hearing them chirp
    ""I will bring you plastic flowers/You can play with them for hours"" in
    druggy harmony is to conclude that they're a brilliant put-on. But they
    were for real-- or at least not wholly fictional-- and, for a few
    gorgeous, candy-colored months, they kicked ass up and down the Royal

    Despite having former Quasi, Mudhoney, and Guided by Voices members among their numbers, The Takeovers' first record <em>Turn to Red</em> was a little lost in the deluge of Robert Pollard's post-GbV material. It had something to do with the hit-or-miss ratio of its tunes, of course, but it didn't help that Pollard released it with two other albums on the same day. We're hearing even less noise about the band's second record, despite the added support of Stephen Malkmus and members of the Decemberists and Tad Doyle this time out. And though it may get shoved aside again in light of the new two-disc ""best-of"" from the Fading Captain series of Pollard ephemera (culling songs from nearly everything but this record), <em>Bad Football<span id=""__firefox-findbar-search-id"" style=""padding: 0pt; background-color: yellow; color: black; display: inline; font-size: inherit""></span></em> is one of his strongest releases since disbanding his former band. Not only does it return him to the unpredictable tape experiments and lo-fi scruff of his most-loved period with GbV, it revels in something long missed in all his ensuing solo work: spontaneity.</p><p>
    I'm not calling it a ""return to form,"" and I'm not saying there aren't some dogs-- ""Kicks at the Gym"" is fucking odious, with Pollard adopting a red-faced bleat while aping the jocks the way he savaged liberal arts kids on <em>Turn to Red</em>'s ""Fairly Blacking Out"", and it's not half as clever as you'd imagine it. But if you've found yourself missing ""old Bob,"" he's here, somewhere. He's almost defiant about the transparency of his process, turning the ready-made anthem ""Pretty Not Bad"" into a rousing ode to adequacy (""Wrote a song and I like it 'cuz it's pretty not bad""), and even deflates all the sneer in his vocal by calling attention to his long-abused fake English accent. Pollard could probably write songs like these in his sleep, and maybe that's why he pokes holes in some of their tires along the way, as tracks like ""Smokestacks Bellowing Stars"" and ""My Will"" have halting tape-recorded dialog interludes that diffuse their melodies and momentum.</p><p>
    Yet most of them can't be stopped: the tender vocal turn of ""I Can See My Dog"" will poke your tear ducts with evocative homespun detail, and a song from a quinquagenarian indie rocker (as of later this year, anyway) about settling accounts (""My Will"") sounds like another ageless cousin to ""Motor Away"" or ""Teenage FBI"". Elsewhere, the band veers from brief spurts of bumpkin rock on ""Father's Favorite Temperature"" to Brit-folk story-songs on ""Molly &amp; Zack"", while ""You're At It"" returns to small-town ennui about ""blackboard Mondays"" and, between a reassuringly shambling rhythm section and some confident guitar licks, is as convincingly hedonistic as Pollard's sounded (""This form of suicide's not quick enough, what else you got?"").
    </p>
<p>
    Part of the appeal for hardcore fans is sifting for these moments, certainly. But for everyone else, there's much less filtering than usual to do here, and even the near-misses and the not-even-aiming tracks have a returned glimmer of inspiration and insanity nicked from Pollard's old basement Frankensteins. ""The Jester of Helpmeat"" is wholly inexplicable, but at a minute's runtime is still palatable with some curious carnivalesque production tricks. ""Music For Us"" must mean music for estranged uncles drunk at 2:00 p.m. who mumble over claw-handed piano chords, and when it almost gets normal, an announcer's voice shouts about the new ""smash sensation"" (and, I believe, ""smashusations"") midway through, never to be heard from again.
    </p>
<p>
    No one would put up with these tracks on their own (unless you're one of the few buying Circus Devils albums), and yet, the golden moments wouldn't be the same if they weren't a spoonful of sugar to make Pollard's whole kooky, kaleidoscopic persona go down. GbV records used to have all these weird detours next to the pop perfection before Pollard figured out what a side project was; <em>Bad Football<span id=""__firefox-findbar-search-id"" style=""padding: 0pt; background-color: yellow; color: black; display: inline; font-size: inherit""></span></em> marks the first occasion in years where they all crowd into the same Chevy again. It's not a greatest hits record, and it's not even a GbV record, but we've got plenty of those. Whatever the name on the front or the pedigree of its members, it is a Robert Pollard record and one worth owning, as its winners and warts all gush with the same charm as they once did.<br/>

Zipping to fame with ""Taken for Granted"", an unlikely Prokofiev nod, and 2002's <em>Healing Is Difficult</em>, she appeared securely on track to pop stardom. But success left as suddenly as it came, driving her to rethink herself and her art. The result was <em>Colour the Small One</em>, a fragile and introspective song cycle inspired, in part, by the loss of an old beau in London to a car accident. When someone at HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" picked one of the album's tracks, ""Breathe Me"", to soundtrack the series' devastating last moments, Sia faced another jolt of celebrity.</p><p>
    Judging solely from her latest release, <em>Lady Croissant</em>, which gathers material from a show at New York's Bowery Ballroom, lasting celebrity may not be in the cards. Her fate seems tied to her vocal style, whether her Adelaide drawl is an asset or a liability. The studio work argues for the former, but these live recordings-- especially of Zero 7's ""Destiny"" and ""Distractions""-- build a case for the latter. Innocent nouns like ""mister"" are reborn as ""mizzu-ah-uh-ahh,"" translated into the mystic pidgin dream-language first discovered in Lindsay Lohan's correspondence. The studio version of ""Distraction"" includes the clear, clever plea to ""Make Ms. Me, Mrs. You."" But singing live, as a sort of public execution, Sia hangs, draws, and quarters the poor line. Again and again, the original sultriness is siphoned out. She covers Cher's ""I Go To Sleep,"" written by Ray Davies and famously rendered by the Pretenders. Sia recreates the Pretenders' classy arrangements, but once again, she yanks apart Davies' poetry with her slurred, bathetic pronunciation.</p><p>
    Throughout the once-moving ""Blow It All Away"" and ""Don't Bring Me Down"", Sia's delivery seesaws between Rich Boy and Gregorian monks (""I don't wanna chuh-ah-eh-ay-unnnge""), on a continuum that never should have existed. As Sia confessed to an interviewer, this isn't her finest hour. The Bowery Ballroom show offered a starstruck (Michael Moore had pledged to attend), wine-drunk (she was starstruck), and lightly bloodied (an Easter egg hunt went awry, honestly) version of the woman. It just happened to be the one show they recorded. </p><p>
    Mercifully, two songs rescue this record from outright catastrophe. ""Pictures"", the single studio track here, was bankrolled by American Eagle, who saw Sia as the next Aryan face of collegiate abandon. The song is deceptively sunny, a great fit for the franchise's philosophy, but better still for Sia, whose strongest ballads wend between against-the-odds joy and an almost gothic fatalism. We get the sense we're hearing the real Sia, properly agonized. In the album's other success, ""Lentil"" sets quiet harmonies behind Sia's shy sing-speak and anguished outpourings. Amazingly, through the fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants, the story's wounded soul shines through. That these two songs are both new, and that these are the two that truly work, is the silver lining here. It's still distressing that <em>Lady Croissant</em> offers only a glimpse of Sia's abundant talent, a faded memory, instead of the widescreen vista fans were waiting for. <br/></p></div>"|10500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10500-lady-croissant/|5.2|Roque Strew

    The album is more like <em>To All We Stretch the Open Arm</em>, the collection of traditional folk Mirah recorded with Seattle's Black Cat Orchestra, than her beloved <em>C'mon Miracle</em>. Forgoing that album's sketches, snippets, and snapshots, which were of a piece with the naively ramshackle twee for which her label is renowned, <em>Share This Place</em> employs a decidedly more adult, historically rooted method of songwriting and performing. These full-bodied songs, sturdily played by Spectratone International, draw from a variety of Asian and European folk idioms for their torch-lit, supple swoon. Kyle Hanson's drunkenly reeling accordion and Lori Goldston's weepy cello betray a strong Klezmer influence, while Kane Mathis's flickering oud (similar to a lute) injects Middle Eastern strains. Sympathetic production by Phil Elvrum and Steve Fisk amplifies Mirah's idiosyncrasies-- her non-sexual sensuality, her scenery-chewing vocal projection.</p><p>
<em>Share This Place</em> takes these concepts as givens: Since moving indoors, humankind has forgotten its symbiotic relationship with nature, viewing it instead as something essentially <em>other</em>. We designate some flora as desirable, other flora as weeds, and wreak destruction accordingly. Shirking the hard work and sacrifice of genuine preservation, we build natural preserves where we can absorb the bounty of wilderness, then rocket back to the industrial lifestyle that is inexorably devouring it. We regard the enclosures in which we live as interstices in the natural continuum, and woe be to any insect-- those stinging, buzzing pests-- that trespass our domain.
    </p><p>
    Mirah understands that in a world where we'd rather let corporations build windmill farms in exchange for permission to pollute than to vote, with our dollars, against them polluting so damn much, humankind's sense of empathy is more direly in need of rejuvenation than EPA policy, and she begins the work on a resounding note with album opener and stand-out ""Community"". Singing with an arch lilt over a cursive scrawl of acoustic guitar, Mirah seems to choose an unambiguous side in the phylogenic war: ""You have but two, we have six/ We can use them to such great accomplishment."" 
    </p>
<p>
    She goes on to sing praises to the collaborative societies of insects, and humanity takes its fair share of knocks. But her mechanistic view of insect life-- ""we communicate with chemicals""-- is tempered by an acknowledgement that the exchange of pheromones is infinitely mysterious, despite science's handy explanations: ""It's an expressive art, instinctually smart/ Secretions quiet and dependable."" In an era when we've chosen to understand our feelings as nothing more than the emulsion of certain chemical balances in our brains, couldn't she just as easily be singing about human existence? The song isn't, as it might seem on the surface, anti-human; it's pro-community, looking to egoless activity of the insect kingdom for inspiration. 
    </p>
<p>
    This is the album's most explicit salvo-- for the remainder, insects flit, often so symbolically as to be imperceptible, through Mirah's kaleidoscopic imagery. Because she often sings in the first person when she sings directly about critters, as on the languorous ""Emergence of the Primary Larva"", it's easy to forget that they're involved at all, reading the album instead as a metaphorical series of captivities, infatuations, and transformations. Like Colin Meloy of the Decemberists, she's fond of period-pieces, bombastic polysyllables, antique grammar, and mythological melodrama: ""Song of Psyche"" narrates the tale of Cupid's beloved, and it's worth noting that Mirah sounds much more anthropological here than when she's singing about bugs. 
    </p>
<p>
    A penchant for words like ""numinous"" and ""proboscis"" is liable to produce awkward syntax, but Mirah skirts this danger by treating each syllable like a discrete unit, parceling them out fluidly across the music's oompah fanfare. And like Joanna Newsom, whose fans should find plenty to admire here, she tends to let her narratives shuck off their literal focus and shimmer out into symbolically dense metaphysics. But unlike Newsom's <em>Ys</em>, which traversed majestic peaks and shadowy vales of ambiance, <em>Share This Place </em>is tonally flatter-- after awhile, the listener might feel bludgeoned by the pageantry, as more retiring songs that let us catch our breath, like the aforementioned ""Community"" or the vanishing ballad ""Luminescence"", are few and far between.
    </p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, it's a rewarding album provided you've a high threshold for pomp. Recurring motifs circle and dart through dense thickets of imagery and verbiage. Magnificent solar events are as common as chrysalises and larvae, as are feasts and surfeit (""I will grow to eat my share/ of pastry rich beyond compare"" she sings on the wheezy ""Gestation of the Sacred Beetle""). While citing Wikipedia is always a sketchy business, one contextless tidbit it offers-- that Mirah was born on a kitchen table-- is too tantalizing to ignore. Whether the factoid is true or apocryphal, it strikes a resonant note, imbuing the singer's life with the same tall-tale proportions that animate her songs. 
    </p>
<p>
    In the end, the story of the insects <em>is</em> Mirah's own: ""In 1975,"" she sings amid the smoky swirls of ""Following the Sun"", citing the year of her birth, ""discovery arrived."" And her story, in turn, abstracted through the lens of mechanistic behavior, is all of ours. <em>Share This Place</em> emanates from a microcosmic level, but fans out to encompass all of being, shredding through mental compartments like a termite and restoring, for its 48 minute duration, the continuum of life. Listening closely to this record, with its prodigious intelligence and sugar-coated polemics, might make stepping on an ant feel uncomfortably like stepping on yourself.

Just like with rock bands, there are always plenty of artists with sounds accessible enough for broad appeal-- it's just impossible to guess what arcane combination of style, timing, marketing, magic, and luck will actually send one into people's attention.</p><p>
    Whatever the secret is, Berlin's Sascha Ring, aka Apparat, seems to be aiming for it. The weird thing is, though, that he seems a much more likely candidate when he's not trying. In and around the few dutiful pop tracks on <em>Walls</em>, his third full-length, Ring has made one of the best electronic dream-pop records in a while, somewhere in the tradition of M83, Slowdive, Junior Boys, Schneider TM, and every other act to trip out on dense, blissy echoes and thinky, under-the-covers slowness-- not the kind of album that asks for your attention, but the kind that seduces you into it.</p><p>
    For most of his career, Ring has been a favorite in a specialized niche: As a producer, he has a reputation as a digital-processing wizard. The guy can chew up drums into alien machines, stretch strings out into hazy pillows, and stitch the resulting parts together in space like a dream; it's made him a hero to that cognoscenti that's less interested in the actual dancefloor and more interested in the sophistication of the techniques behind it. And on last year's <em>Orchestra of Bubbles</em>, Ring shared billing with Ellen Allien, an artist with enough name recognition-- and enough of a pop sensibility-- to introduce his work to a lot of new headphones.</p><p>
<em>Walls </em>is certainly trying to follow up that line: There's a lot of the same seamless blending of electronic notions and pop ones, with small bits of production genius gathering themselves up into big, melodic, vocal-friendly sweeps. Thing is, Ring doesn't actually seem suited for the kind of pop that, you know, <em>pops</em>: His style is too subtle, too relaxed, too head-in-the-clouds. His collaborations with Allien would always veer back to some kind of big, gritty thump-- on his own, Ring stays gentle and dreamy, too lost in the rich stew of his sounds to ever grab you by the throat and demand attention.</p><p>
    So it's the squinty-eyed pop tracks toward the beginning that don't entirely hold up. ""Hailin' from the Edge"" and ""Holdon"" both sound good on first listen, Ring setting up muted, futuristic r&amp;b thumps and clicks behind pop vocals from Raz Ohara-- a few times through, though, and you can sense a self-consciousness in them, a certain awkwardness. Push through to tracks like the two-part ""Fractales"" and the gorgeous ""Arcadia"", and you feel like you're getting into the territory where Ring would rather be: The sound of a guy who's gone just a little tired out on dance music, who's as interested in string quartets as kick drums, who just wants to escape to the studio and stretch sounds out into blurry clouds and the hiss of escaping steam.</p><p>
    You hit ""Arcadia"", in fact, and this turns into a dream-pop triumph. ""Arcadia"" might start out with a mechanical, Allien-esque beat, but Ring uses it to push little wisps of synth around like watercolors, while a falsetto vocal glides and wanders through. On ""You Don't Know Me"", he does the same with strings, shepherding them through tight harmonic changes and up into a grand, stately climax. ""Headup"" has him singing softly against an ocean of reverberating voices that seems like a direct nod to the shoegazer band Slowdive-- even before a spacy guitar line comes in to punctuate the changes. </p><p>
    It's a shame Ring didn't set out to construct his entire record along these lines, because they're where he finds his greatest successes; the urge to strike while the pop iron is still hot may have painted him into a few strange corners. But as a path to follow after <em>Orchestra of Bubbles</em>-- a path for listeners even more than for Ring-- this is a terrific one: The best of these tracks combine the mechanized pulse and sonic possibilities of techno with good old bliss-out dreams better than anything in a while.</p></div>"|10515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10515-walls/|8.1|Nitsuh Abebe

    On their Load debut, L.A.'s Silver Daggers bear a striking resemblance to fellow Californian post-hardcore outfit XBXRX. Both groups use screaming one-note singers, fat Mike Watt-ish bass lines, and raging punk beats dotted with jazzy syncopations. And both stick religiously to relentless overdrive, making their songs impressive individually but tiring in long doses.</p><p>
    XBXRX battled that fatigue pretty successfully on their last album, <em>Wars</em>, by expanding their songwriting chops. By contrast, Silver Daggers fight the sonic bends by widening their palette, adding the squirting saxophone of Jenna Thornhill and the jolting synth of William Menchaca. When that pair's fiery commentary takes over, Silver Daggers are at their most intriguing. On tracks like the pounding ""The Five Food Groups"" (a hilarious diet lesson) and the hyper-chaotic ""Run to Fear"", the group sounds like a skewed version of James Chance's Contortions, had that band been weaned on the SST and Dischord catalogues.</p><p>
    Even when sax and synth aren't out front, Silver Daggers craft exhilarating sonic sprints, made more urgent by blunt politics. ""The future is ending now/ The war is getting cold"" they scream during the stomping ""Ghosted"", while on ""Real Neat Flag"", scraping guitar and a head-cracking beat underscore protest-march slogans. ""We do not need you congressman if you are going to let that act pass,"" they yell without irony. ""We do not need your protection, and we do not need your flag."" Such polemics may seem heavy-handed on paper, but like the Minutemen's crystal-clear rants, they're oddly effective when married to intelligent punk. Still, the music itself could use more subtlety, and all the repetition and speed are a challenge to endure in one sitting.
    </p>
<p>
    But there are signs that Silver Daggers' tonal range could widen. At the end of the title track, they break into a funky, keyboard-driven passage akin to a hardcore Talking Heads. Even more surprising is the conclusion of ""Burn the World"", a series of dramatic crescendos that could pass for a Glenn Branca guitar symphony. Rumor has it that the band is more unpredictable live, so the smart money says Silver Daggers' next step will be the leap forward you can hear them gearing up for on <em>New High &amp; Ord</em>.

While Helium's music grew in leaps and bounds between Timony's early chunky chugging and the more-pronounced medieval flourishes on the group's last album, it's safe to say Shawn Devlin's methodical drumming wasn't setting any BPM records.  Going it alone the first two times, Timony was more likely to use a clavinet, harpsichord, or drum machine than an honest-to-goodness drumkit (which was a shame for Christina Files, the sporadically-used drummer on those two albums).  In contrast, 2005's <em>Ex Hex</em>, Timony's first collaboration with Ocampo, featured a rock-like substance Helium fans knew and loved, but with an added boost of nitrous.  His fluid polyrhythmic flourishes meshed nicely with Timony's newfound guitar heroism-- see, all that Ren-Faire noodling you whiners bitched about did some good for her after all!-- and the album itself turned out to be a pleasant synthesis of Timony's career-to-date.</p><p>
    This time around, Timony and Ocampo are joined by Ocampo's Medications bandmate Chad Molter on bass, and are rightfully calling themselves The Mary Timony Band-- Timony's still the one driving the car, of course, but the other two are paying for their fair share of gasoline.  It's their gentle pitter-patter that keeps ""Pink Clouds'"" talk about pink clouds from evaporating, and they're definitely no slouch when it comes to rocking out (""Curious Minds"" and the appropriately titled ""Rockman"" be proof).  On one track-- ""Pause / Off""-- the trio even manages to pull off a fair impersonation of Sleater-Kinney, with Timony vocally channeling her former Spells cohort Carrie Brownstein as she laconically zings lamestains ""hanging out in the CVS parking lot"" and ""Supreme Court misters"" trying to mess around ""with me and my sisters.""</p><p>
    Refreshing lyrical moments like those noted above are few and far between, unfortunately.  The woman whose incisive words once cross-pollinated grrlish gender politics with alluring imagery ripped straight out of Kristin Hersh's songbook is now alternating hippie-dippy musings on nature's endless bounty (clouds, trees, bunnies, etc.) with lazy go-nowhere couplets like ""We can't go back/ It's a natural fact.""  Timony tries to shoot off more one-liners in the semi-topical spirit of ""Pause / Off,"" but they don't work as well-- ""Ted Nugent, hey, what you gonna do?/ What you gonna do when they come for you?/ White tails gonna hunt you down/ Do unto you as they've been done.""  But whatever lack of effort seems evident in the words, the music more than makes up for it.    Just before the WTF Nuge shout-out in ""Sharpshooter,"" there's a rip-roaring bridge that displays the band's ample strengths.  It's not the only example-- ""Rockman"" eventually lives up to its name when Timony stops going on about the dude the song's supposedly about, and the winsome waltz in ""Window"" (decorated with pretty strings and piano twinklings) works best when Timony's voice gets subsumed by the song's gentle melody.  It's a shame she's doesn't seem to be saying much of anything nowadays, but as long as she has music this strong doing the talking for her, Mary Timony will do just fine.</p></div>"|10499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10499-the-shapes-we-make/|6.6|David Raposa

    The pretty cover art of <em>Fascinating Tininess</em>, Georgia-reared duo Leyode's debut, sketches a sort of brand identity in the same watercolor hues as the songs, balladic bits of Piaf and 1990s ambient streamed together with aged instrumental remnants, piano cascades, and violin ascents looped, lopped, and severed. The songs-- wispy, whimsical, yet acerbic and beat-driven-- are often too patchy and piecemeal. ""Isabelle"" takes Laurel Wells' unique vocals and pours them into a vertiginous, murky waterslide of stock drumbeats and backward-traveling string arrangements. In this messy attempt at accessible ambience the vocals get lost, and the man at the decks, Yusuke Hama, appears impatient, choking gorgeous piano parts before their resolution, forcing all his bold colors into one cloying bouquet.</p><p>
    Other songs have more promise: ""Clementine"" incorporates the brassy female vocal harmonies the Dirty Projectors have lately been using, but in Leyode's case, Wells is dragged through more beat-slapping muck and the sound of, perhaps, malfunctioning Energizer bunnies. Still, the vocals are lovely enough to carry the whole thing-- an a capella part pealing through a hubbub of rabid electronics. ""Dominique"", which follows with no break, sees this jarring tapestry through, borrowing a male chorus for an even more full-bodied gust of polyphony. This time, the rhythm creatively skirts around the voices, using more of the tinselly industrial effects of Aphex Twin and inserting a couple of twinkling keyboard notes. But at the close of the track are evermore lady-vocal loops, a flavorless ingredient tossed in needlessly.</p><p>
    On many songs, beneath thick layers of chords are hints of interesting sounds-- bitcrushed noodlings and delicate reverbed drumbeats-- but nothing much comes of these, giving the tracks an improvisational feel; it's only the vocals that are elegantly timed and rehearsed, and half the time, when they're given room to breathe, they carry their own weight as well as the heft of words hummed, mumbled, or merely thought. ""Soft or Gentle?"" once again brings us flashes of ornate melodic lines from voice and violin, but again these fade into repetition and dull, dizzying loop.
    </p>
<p>
    The concoctions are often just too confusing, such as the nice little key peddlings of ""Elizabeth Chateau"", with its distorted voicemail messages and weak, airy vocals. The surprising gem of ""Eilene"", an (I would hope) accidental Sneaker Pimps tribute, pushes and shoves its rhythm and string samples against the ear, persevering until the pointless interlude of flutes that almost ruins things, but for the eventual benighted close of analog synth and the return of the sticky, leaden beat. The songs too often make light of pretty/ugly coincidences, hoping they work when in fact it's hard to hear them together. Dissonances fight for ear time and the vocals, more often than not, are left to be a fruity, floral perfume, which quickly dissipates if it's not first overpowered.

    Despite biopics like <em>Walk the Line</em> and <em>Ray</em>, musicians' lives don't naturally translate to compelling movies. The
    relentless repetition of touring, the fleeting nature of creativity,
    the mundane conflicts between bandmates and hangers-on-- none of it seems all that visually or narratively interesting.</p><p>
    Fortunately, in the right hands, that life can make for a
    powerful album-- like <em>The Stage Names,</em>
    the fourth full-length from Austin
    group Okkervil River.
    This sort of self-reflection should come as no surprise from the band
    responsible for both ""There Is No Hidden Track"" from 2004's <em>Sleep and Wake-Up Songs</em> EP<span> </span>and especially <em>Black Sheep Boy</em>, an album based loosely on the exploits of doomed
    folk musician Tim Hardin; what <em>does</em> surprise is how much they can accomplish with this confessionalism, which is at its most potent on opener ""Our
    Life Is Not a Movie or Maybe"".</p><p>
    As frontman Will Sheff howls hysterically about the lack of plot contrivances, epic endings, and dramatic
    camera angles in daily routine, the band becomes increasingly unhinged and aggressive, careening wildly from
    pent-up verses to explosive something-like-choruses-- an unexpected turn for an
    ensemble more associated with brains than brawn. Near the end, it all finally and artfully falls
    apart, leaving Sheff to close with the clincher about ""a calm clicking, like
    a pro at his editing suite takes two weeks stitching up some bad movie."" Life gets
    two thumbs way, way down.
    </p>
<p>
    Interestingly, Okkervil
    River's career is in the midst of a
    trajectory that perfectly mirrors a traditional narrative arc. Their first
    two albums, <em>Stars Too Small to Use </em>and
    <em>Don't Fall in Love with Everyone You Meet</em>, formed the introduction; <em>Down the River of
    Golden Dreams</em> was the exposition; and <em>Black
    Sheep Boy</em> initiated the rising action. <em>The
    Stage Names</em>, if not the climax itself, at least significantly thickens the plot, seeming just as artistically unsurpassable as <em>Black Sheep Boy </em>did in 2005, and even more
    emotionally devastating.
    </p>
<p>
    With his fondness for dizzying wordplay (who else writes in
    parenthetical asides?) and lyrical ambiguity, Sheff may seem like the
    ultimate indie pessimist on the rollicking r&amp;b number ""A Hand to Take Hold
    of the Scene"" or the caustic relationship deconstruction ""Plus Ones"", but actually, he's just a realist who captures scene conventions and rock'n'roll
    marginalia even as he sees the void beyond them. The mercurial River sound
    looser and louder than they did on <em>Black Sheep Boy</em>, especially on the dramatic ebb and flow of ""Title
    Track"", and the tenderly rootsy ""A Girl in Port"". In fact, Travis Nelsen's explosive drumwork and Jonathan
    Meiburg's backing vocals often lend<em> The Stage Names</em> the immediacy and recklessness of a live recording. Their energetic imprecision-- one of their most commanding features-- coils effortlessly into
    Sheff's self-reflexive lyrics; few groups can so nimbly or inventively use
    music as an extension of lyrical themes or vice versa.
    </p>
<p>
    Fittingly, <em>The Stage Names</em> ends with ""John Allyn Smith Sails"", a document of
    failure so complete that the main character can't even succeed in killing himself: ""I was
    breaking in a case of suds at the Brass Rail, a fall-down drunk with his tongue
    torn out and his balls removed,"" Sheff sings, embodying doomed
    poet John Berryman (his birthname gives the song its title). ""And I
    knew that my last lines were gone, while, stupidly, I lingered on."" Berryman
    seems to be indie's new romantic failure-- he also inspired the
    Hold Steady's ""Stuck Between Stations"". Craig Finn had the Minneapolis
    connection; Okkervil River
    essentially rewrite the Beach Boys' ""Sloop John B"" as a suicide note, turning
    the song into a joke so grim it's hard not to laugh.
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, <em>The Stage
    Names</em> shows how a vastly talented ""mid-level band"" (Sheff's words) sees itself, but there's no bitterness here, just overwhelming self-doubt and
    perseverance. Despite its density (they fit worlds into just nine songs), the
    album remains exciting and accessible, albeit highly sobering. It's about the
    folly of popular music and its attendant lifestyles, but these songs are so
    good and so moving that they only give us stupid, stubborn hope.

    The only people in the music business successfully marketing sounds like the once fervently hyped Magic Numbers'-- that is, unassumingly sentimental folk-pop even an
    exhausted Baby Boomer could love-- are in the coffee business. Almost as remarkable as
    the songs on the Magic Numbers' self-titled 2005 debut was their indifference
    to fashion, both underground and mainstream.</p><p>
    More than eight months after the UK
    edition hit well-stocked import aisles, this slimmed-down domestic release of <em>Those the Brokes </em>won't bring commercial
    success to the band any more readily. At least, not unless the sort of people who don't
    usually seek out new music somehow discover the disc's best tracks. If they do, they'll hear several solid-to-excellent songs
    that extend the rootsy trajectory of the Magic Numbers' fine  first outing, making up in winsome intensity what
    they lack as far as edginess or sex appeal.</p><p>
    First UK single ""Take a Chance""
    encourages us to risk our pride for love. The burnished harmonies of the group's two sibling
    pairs--  Trinidad natives Romeo and
    Michele Stodart along with London-born duo Angela and Sean Gannon-- make it easy to
    overlook any risks the cheery power-pop arrangement declines to take itself. The video
    for second single ""This Is a Song"" shows the band playing to a slowly
    growing assemblage of cross-legged young people, a real sleeper hit. Despite the apparent obviousness of the title, this is a song
    against itself-- as broken-hearted as it is upbeat and catchy. (""Don't wanna
    hear it,"" comes a backing vocal.) The questioning ""Let Somebody
    In"" and comparatively muscular ""You Never Had It"" each glide by
    on the kind of inchoate magic that in more credulous days used to be called ""soul"".
    </p>
<p>
    Although primary lead singer Romeo Stodart's wimpy vocal
    style may owe something to '80s and '90s indie-pop, such comparisons are
    recipes for disappointment. There's nothing shambling or insular about the
    Magic Numbers' approach. And as with Irish rockers the Thrills, this bunch can sometimes
    carry their '60s-rooted sunshine populism to unfortunately bland extremes. The
    worst offender here is Jack Johnson-chillaxing ""Undecided"", which wastes a brassy lead vocal from multi-instrumentalist Angela
    Gannon. Stodart's plainspoken lyrics are, like their constant focus on love, a
    crucial part of the band's identity, but weaker tunes make the
    words seem threadbare. ""I can't get over you,"" Michele Stodart sighs to
    string arrangements by Nick Drake orchestrator Robert Kirby on ""Take Me or Leave Me"", a plodding
    composition that tends toward the banal where the late folkie would've been elemental. The seven minutes of aptly titled
    ""Slow Down (The Way It Goes)"" drag
    the way <em>The Magic Numbers</em>' longest
    compositions didn't. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Such shortcomings aside, this release remains a modest improvement on
    last year's UK pressing. The new track list elides dreadful ""Most of the Time"",
    which was too similar to the far superior Dylan tune of the same name. Also gone is near-miss ""Carl's Song"". Their replacement, ""Keep It in the Pocket"", started life as a 2005 B-side; its breezy
    enthusiasm exhibits confidence if not transcendence. On <em>Those the Brokes</em>, the Magic Numbers have yet to
    shape their middlebrow yearning into a masterpiece on par with those of influences
    the Mamas and the Papas or the Band. Let's hope Astralwerks keeps letting them try.

    ""from and inspired by"" a motion picture are really just cash grabs, full of
    cast-off tracks from artists who could spare them, often from a label owned by
    the same company that owns the studio that made the movie. The soundtrack for <em>The Trials of Darryl Hunt</em> is different.
    Sure, it features almost entirely tracks that weren't in the documentary, and
    it's a hodgepodge of new tracks, live performances, and even an album
    track or two, but it's also a benefit compilation for the Darryl Hunt
    Foundation, which works for wrongfully convicted prisoners.</p><p>
    The motivation for putting it out doesn't change the quality
    of the music, of course, but everyone involved is to be commended for
    contributing to the cause. Quickly, Hunt, a young black man, was arrested
    under, at best, dubious circumstances for the rape and murder of a young
    newspaper copy editor in <span class=""postbody"">Winston-Salem</span>, North Carolina, and subsequently convicted
    by an all-white jury in spite an overwhelming lack of compelling evidence
    against him. There was a simple reason there was no good evidenced-Hunt was
    completely innocent. That didn't keep him from being re-convicted after his
    original conviction was overturned, though, nor did it secure him a speedy
    release from prison after his second conviction. Even evidence directly
    contrary to the state's case against him was ignored.</p><p>
    Hunt's case became a cause celebre for people fighting against
    flaws in our justice system, and in his own community, served as evidence that
    attitudes among authorities in North
    Carolina had changed little since segregation.
    Stories like Hunt's are not nearly as uncommon as we might think or like to
    hope, and the film does an excellent job of showing just how senseless and
    avoidable his 20-year ordeal was.
    </p><p>
    It's not surprising that the four new hip-hop tracks-- the
    only tracks by black musicians on the disc-- are the most outraged here. Each one
    directly takes on racism and corruption with fluid eloquence, and as such
    they're the most bracing songs on the soundtrack, though the indie rock that
    surrounds them is mostly fine on its own. Ras Kass blazes away at
    institutionalized racism and public indifference on ""Guilty Until Proven Innocent"", mentioning
    Hunt by name, and spitting furious line like ""You know what it takes/ To not
    hate police?"" in his trademark syncopated flow.
    </p>
<p>
    Dead Prez's Sticman interpolates his rap comparing American
    justice to a shell game on ""The Hunt Is On"" with a lullaby that features the
    decidedly un-lullaby-like line ""the hunt is always on for us."" G-Unit's Spider
    Loc offers up a prison narrative brimming with details of life behind bars on
    ""Behind Bars"", shying away from direct attacks on the police and courts. The
    guys who have been at it longest, the Last Poets, team up with Dälek for the
    darkest of the four tracks. The Last Poets pre-date hip-hop as a true genre,
    and their sense of vocal rhythm is exciting and different from just about
    anything else. The lyrics take a broader perspective on the black condition,
    addressing institutional problems alongside intracommunity ones with virtuosic
    poetry like this: ""Even the depth in their faces does not seem to belong to
    them/ It seems borrowed/ On loan/ Consigned!/ To them by too many Blood and Crip fantasies dripping in dead tributes/ Dedicated to the eagerness of
    self-destruction.""
    </p>
<p>
    Exclusive tracks from Portastatic and Califone have less to
    do with the film, but are nonetheless excellent songs their fans will want to
    hear. Mark Kozelek's solo rendition of the Red House Painters' ""Have You
    Forgotten"" is haunting and beautiful, and Andrew Bird's similarly spare
    violin-and-voice performance of ""Happy Day"" positively soars. Other
    contributions are more puzzling or just plain unwelcome. Starsailor's ""Good
    Souls"" was boring enough without stripping it down to a bare acoustic
    arrangement, while Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's ""Yankee Go Home"" just sounds
    garish next to everything else here. 
    </p>
<p>
    Three pieces of music on the disc actually do come from the
    film-Paul Brill's score is by turns droning and desolate, then feverishly
    animated, emotional sketches made mostly of electronic sound. ""Prison Theme"" is
    the most memorable, a forbidding descent into hell that puts the drums as high
    in the mix as everything else. Brill also contributes a lovely song called
    ""Powerlines"", an electro-acoustic meditation that sounds a bit like the ghost
    of Grandaddy. It's not cohesive, and it has a few forgettable songs on it, but <em>The Trials of Darryl Hunt</em> is ultimately
    a worthy disc assembled for a worthwhile cause.

    Daunting when you don't know but engrossing once you start to spy light in the dark, the secret to making sense of dance music hinges on the distinction you draw between house and techno. Here's mine: House responds to a source of gravity that hovers above the music, while techno reacts to mass whose weight remains below. It's the difference between up and down-- an easy metric whose simplicity proves all the more useful when complexity enters in.</p><p>
    Complexity enters in a lot, as anybody invested in dance music will be quick to point out. But complexity only counts when you can recognize the parts in play. Bodies are better at this than brains: Dance to house or techno, and you'll find yourself rising to hi-hats like a marionette or stomping on bass-kicks like a machine without stopping to register the difference. Making actual sense of it, though-- that's another project.</p><p>
    Sebo K doesn't sound the least bit academic about this on <em>Back Up Vol. 01</em>, but the meaning of it all seethes in the subtext of a DJ mix devoted to house, techno, and strategically articulated points in between. As a matter of course, the set surveys the resurgence of house modes in the realm of German minimal-techno, where a fixation on negation has turned toward a reverence for the pregnant pause. House is hot these days, in part for the way its atmospheres (full of sweat, sex, and spirituality) make house scan almost literally as ""hot"" music.
    </p>
<p>
    That's not to say the cool mechanistic twitch of techno doesn't play a role. <em>Back Up</em>'s opening track, by Kerri Chandler, features a voice singing about a ""digital love affair"" over a spell of haunted beats gone to grey. The stoic aural tone and downward drizzle of synths lean toward techno, but the onset of writhing moans and hisses splayed out in sticky air-- that's house all the way. There's no question of provenance once Sascha Dive's ""Deep in Rhythm"" wanders in and backs down to the funky shudders and claps of John Daly's ""Do It"", which derives its swing mostly from economical high-end accents that sound like a thin stick of pencil lead scratching spotty code on parchment.
    </p>
<p>
    One of the most interesting aspects of the current house music swell is the sense of history it puts into play. Sebo K and his label Mobilee stand in as signs of Berlin in the present day, but <em>Back Up</em> traffics in sounds-- or at least the spirit of sounds-- that could have come from Chicago or New York 20 years ago. The best tracks are the ones that conflate devotion and deviation, like Efdemin's ""Just a Track"" (replete with a dumb/brilliant a cappella speech from an aspiring President of the House Nation) and Jimpster's ""Seventh Wave"" (a tightly coiled banger that eyes the minimal prize of Melchior Productions more than anything tied to soiled cities in America). The historical loop cinches in the middle with a new track by Larry Heard, the fabled Chicago producer who helped define house in its early days as Mr. Fingers: Blown over with soulful vocals and a maniacal synth figure from way back when, ""The Sun Can't Compare"" trails a history of ""acid"" house that recoils and relaxes in a steely state of self-possession.
    </p>
<p>
    The second half of <em>Back Up</em> focuses on sounds more closely linked to Sebo K's milieu, with fidgets and tweaks attuned to the times. GummiHz and Marco Resmann represent the Mobilee sound with deep, busy tracks devoted to house more as a guiding principle than as a prescriptive form, and an Âme remix (of Ferrer &amp; Sydenham Inc.) closes with a sumptuous run of hand-drums and synthesized sighs given to expansion more than extraction. It's house that sounds perfectly at home wandering through new provinces.<br/>

    In the course of their almost ten-year run, Botch would cover Carl Orff's ""O Fortuna"", from the opera <em>Carmina Burana</em>, and the B-52's 1978 debut single ""Rock Lobster"", an untouchably weird ode to surf guitar and faked animal noises. In return, Botch would gain a kind of novelty calling card-- something to remember them by. This 10-cent devil's bargain-- or trivia joke, I guess-- has paid off: <em>American Nervoso</em> is the second of three Botch reissues Hydra Head has slated, a stunningly kind treatment for a post-hardcore outfit from the Northwest corner of the country that put out only two full-lengths between 1993 and their demise in 2002.</p><p>
    No one who has heard either of Botch's two covers will be shocked to learn that <em>American Nervoso</em>, when originally released in 1998, sounded less like opera or surf-pop than noisy post-hardcore. It's a sound they shared at the time with label-mates Converge, Cave In, and Isis. Botch listened to more metal than the latter two and less than the former, and so they skipped both Cave In's scrappy emotional martyrdom and Isis's doom canter in favor of a vaguely math-y roar-- more mosh parts, and fewer blast beats. Think contemporaries the Locust, but slower, or descendents in Some Girls, Daughters, the Now, or even Pissed Jeans--confrontational, noise proficient.</p><p>
    Botch formed just after the year punk broke, which was also the time crossover died, and though it took them another few years to release their Hydra Head debut, <em>American Nervoso</em>'s original slate of nine songs is a kind of primer for any number of sounds underway in the decade. If the opener ""Hutton's Great Heat Engine"" was a Born Against update, a reintegration of that band's ironic hardcore with the tough guy metal it had been created in reaction to, ""John Woo"" was of a piece with the California-based disquiet coined by the Swing Kids or Drive Like Jehu. The portentously-named ""Dali's Praying Mantis"" acknowledged the art-rock side of things, sounded like the VSS or Shotmaker, and flashed the pretentiousness that also led the band to cover ""O Fortuna"" and include a maudlin piano outro to the otherwise on-fire ""Oma"". Add the breakdown from ""Dead for a Minute"" and the Moss Icon spoken-word self pity from the bridge of ""Spitting Black"" and there's no important strain of post-Minor Threat hardcore Botch didn't get around to.
    </p>
<p>
    Hard not to wonder why Botch is being reissued so soon after their demise, or why them as opposed to any number of bands they played shows with, stole riffs from, or vice versa. If they had more catholic tastes than their peers, they were also more scattershot and, if recollection serves, less loved in the fanatical way that Cave In or Converge were. The inclusion of four alternate versions-- three of them demos-- and one song available elsewhere (""Stupid Me"") doesn't exactly swing things one way or another. But there are worse places to start or end than with <em>American Nervoso</em>-- like, say, ""Rock Lobster"". Try ""Hives,"" the record's original last song: a new part<br/>
    spinning in every ten seconds, the riffs stacking up like nine years of practice tapes. One thing Botch were never short on was ideas.

    Alf Clausen, you will be avenged! Clausen, the longtime composer of all original music for ""The Simpsons"", has long had to suffer the indignity of being responsible for all tunes Groening <em>except</em> for the theme, which Danny Elfman receives exactly one giant money bag per day for. That theme is almost universally known and loved, but Clausen's work is in a way much more impressive; given the far-flung range of satire ""The Simpsons"" has reached in its 20 years, Clausen has had to be as versatile as any television/movie composer in the industry. Plus, he had absolutely nothing to do with <em>The Simpsons Sing the Blues</em>, which is definitely worth some points.</p><p>
    And yet, producers of <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> (you may have seen a commercial or two for it) chose to snub Clausen and go with former Ultravox/Buggles keyboardist Hans Zimmer. Well, okay, Zimmer's also done Oscar-nominated scores for stuff like <em>The Lion King </em>and <em>Gladiator</em>, but c'mon, who saw those? Clearly the idea was to give the movie a more cinematic feel via the score, an understandable priority for creators faced with making (as the opening sequence points out) a film version of a TV show you can watch for free 12 times a day. But as far as Simpsons loyalists are concerned, Zimmer could be one of the German guys who took over the Springfield Power Plant in ""Burns Verkaufen Der Kraftwerk"", inspiring Homer's fantasy about the Land of Chocolate (music by A. Clausen).</p><p>
    The thing is, scoring the music for a Simpsons story, be it episode or feature, is no easy task. Thick with one-liners, subtle sight gags, and (in the case of the movie) flashy animation tricks, the music has to fight for limited space. Even after seeing the flick, the only pieces I recognize on replay are the surf-guitar spy-theme of ""Release the Hounds"" and the Elfmanish choral treatment of trailer gag ""Spider Pig"". The rest of the soundtrack is filled with stock orchestral scoring that befits the film's extra-wide aspect ratio without being intrusive, the only thing marking it as particularly Simpsons being the repeated appearance of variations on the central theme. 
    </p>
<p>
    Granted, it's unfair to compare this collection with Clausen's magnum opus <em>Go Simpsonic With the Simpsons</em>, given the several dozen episodes that disc pulls from. Perhaps a better comparison is another TV-to-film conversion, 1999's <em>South Park: Bigger Longer &amp; Uncut</em>, wherein Hollywood vet Marc Shaiman (from such classics as <em>Sister Act</em> and <em>Hot Shots!</em>) gleefully skewered the conventions of cartoon musicals with the show's creators. Miraculously and thankfully, <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> is not a musical (it's even less musical than several recent seasons), but the chance to add a level of orchestral parody to the joke-filled mix is flubbed.
    </p>
<p>
    But, then again, <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> isn't as good as the <em>South Park</em> movie either-- though it was surprisingly satisfying. More than any comedic failings (is the techno version of the theme, ""Recklessly Impulsive"", supposed to be a joke?), Zimmer's score is a snooze just because it's so bland and generic, with the only memorable bits coming from the 11-note theme that was already written for him. Who knows if Clausen would've done much better, but it's worth speculating that keeping things in-house, and using someone experienced at keeping up with the show's frenetic joke pace, would've run truer to the Simpsons spirit, or at least been more fun to listen to at home.

Many of the original breaks that hip-hop's sonic style was built on were already almost a decade old by the time the first rap songs were being put on wax, and in the 30-plus years since, both traditionalists and experimentalists alike have tended to turn towards that same span of the 1960s and 70s for their muse, with constantly-shifting results. Combine that with the cratedigger's tendency to search for the obscure and the underheard, and it gives rise to an unusual form of revivalism that feels largely free of historical entropy and canonical stasis-- can it really be nostalgia if it's for something everybody else forgot?</p><p>
    So it'd only make sense that Stones Throw, indie rap's most retro-future-minded label, would have its own archival imprint. Now-Again Records, the brainchild of onetime vinyl hoarder/Stones Throw manager/<em>Funky 16 Corners</em> compiler Eothen ""Egon"" Alapatt, has been kicking around for over five years, and in that time the label's given rare groove addicts a substantial fix, ranging from solid regional overviews (like <em>Texas Funk: Black Gold from the Lone Star State 1968-1975</em>) to a steady parade of 7"" funk and soul jazz singles that fall in line with Madlib and Peanut Butter Wolf's West Coast indie leanings. <em>Now-Again Re:Sounds Vol. 1</em>, however, lets the funk-rap continuum swing the other way: Many of the artists who appeared on the label's reissue compilations and limited-edition 45s a few years back are reintroduced back into the hip-hop arena that allowed for their unearthing in the first place.</p><p>
    Most of the ideas here are obvious but effective: Producer Koushik fuses together fragments of several tracks from the 2005 comp <em>Cold Heat: Heavy Funk Rarities 1968-1974</em>, taking about a dozen different horn riffs and twanging guitars and what sounds like about three concurrent drum breaks to deliver a blown-out wall of funk bass for Percee P to blaze over. J.Rocc's ""Cold Heat Funk Mix Pt. 1"" has essentially the same idea, but avoids redundancy by foregoing rap vocals for a King Tubby dub-funk approach, and his other contributions-- including a jittery but velvet-lush rework of Kashmere Stage Band's ""Ain't No Sunshine"" and a gritty splice of Detroit Sex Machines' ""Rap It Together"" and ""Funky Crawl""-- make fine work of turning their source material's shoestring-budget production and garage-band feel into hazy, psychedelic sample-soul. And Cut Chemist's remix of L.A. Carnival's melancholy, psychedelic soul classic ""Blind Man"" gives it a brisk downhill push, upping the tempo and bridging the gap between the two versions most heads know-- the acid-rock freakout from the obscurantist Memphix comp <em>Chains and Black Exhaust</em> and the Hammond-heavy revision Now-Again included on <em>Would Like to Pose a Question</em>-- by swapping out the former's fuzz guitar and the latter's organ riffs for a straightforward bass-and-horns groove. With Lester Abrams' simple but effectively plaintive vocals at the forefront, it hits a bit closer emotionally than the subsequent ""Rap Version,"" which features M.E.D. making like a flatter-voiced Mos Def, but they both bump like nobody's business.</p><p>
    As much shine as the craft of hip-hop gets on this comp, there's a brief but intriguing flash of house music crossover right at Re:Sounds' epicenter, as Todd Terry and Kenny Dope both take their shots at remixing Kashmere Stage Band. Given the source material-- an adept but often raw 1970s high school funk band from Texas-- it's almost a given that neither track is going to sound slick enough for most modern house-friendly dancefloors. But while neither of them are radically transformative, there's no shortage of movement in either track; Terry's take on the band's version of Stevie Wonder's ""I Wish"" rides an opening monster disco-funk break into a blast of manic chase-scene horns, and Kenny's mix of ""Super Strut Pt. 1"" underscores the original's borderline-Latin groove (though it does tend to get rhythmically hitched up in a couple places).</p><p>
    Most of the prime stuff on <em>Re:Sounds Vol. 1 </em>has already been parceled out here and there, but it's largely been available only on 7"", which makes this comp useful for just about anyone without a turntable. Just don't expect most of the previously unreleased material to be all that spectacular: Aloe Blacc's ""Blind World"" is the first of three consecutive tracks to riff off ""Blind Man"", and his demi-Nas rhymes place it in the ""solid enough"" category, but Edan's hippie-dip priapism (""sex is the reason that we all exist/ see, the stars made love in primordial mist"") sinks ""Sagittarius Rapp"", the Heliocentrics-augmented trip-hop of ""Before I Die"" suffers from a sleepy-sounding, rudimentary-rhyming turn from Guilty Simpson, and Sound in Light's tinkly fuzak disemboweling of Amnesty's ""Free Your Mind"" sounds like a Holiday Inn version of Morcheeba. Still, they're scarce missteps on a compilation largely filled with interesting reinterpretations, and <em>Re:Sounds Vol. 1</em> adds a postscript to the old cliche: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it, but those who remember it have their ways of making it sound a bit weirder.</p></div>"|10436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10436-now-again-resounds-vol-1/|6.9|Nate Patrin

    White Noise's landmark 1969 album <em>An Electric Storm</em> might not the first thing most people think of when considering 1960s music, but there are few records anywhere tied more intrinsically to the moment of their creation. Recorded in the months immediately prior to the widespread availability of keyboard-based synthesizers, <em>An Electric Storm</em> might be one of the most painstakingly crafted electronic recordings of all time. Pieced together on improvised equipment via innumerable tape edits, this remarkable album is at once futuristic and unavoidably date-stamped, serving as a fascinating audio snapshot of a bygone era in sound generation and recording technology.</p><p>
    One of the few acts in pop music history able to trace their origins to the lecture hall, White Noise were first conceived when American electronic engineer David Vorhaus-- following a lecture by BBC Radiophonic Workshop veteran Delia Derbyshire-- enlisted Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson to integrate their experimental electronics with more pop-oriented material. (Derbyshire, of course, was by this point already responsible for the classic theme song from ""Dr. Who""<em> </em>and other music for BBC TV and radio programs.) Commissioned by Island Records' Chris Blackwell, the three musical scientists soon holed themselves up for months in their Camden Town studio, fastidiously assembling what Vorhaus later surmised to be the most heavily tape-spliced album in history.</p><p>
    Yet knowledge of White Noise's academic or technical background does little to prepare the listener for the widescale psychedelic mayhem of <em>An Electric Storm</em>. Despite its brief 35-minute running length, the album covers an enormous amount of stylistic ground, as White Noise overlay their fractured pop songcraft with musique concrète effects, weird bits of radio theater, and long stretches of gothic horror. While other groups of the period--such as Silver Apples or The United States of America--made use of similarly primitive electronic equipment, <em>An Electric Storm</em> was a separate beast entirely, and its singular textures have been a primary influence on such subsequent acts as Stereolab, Broadcast and Belbury Poly. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not originally issued in the U.S. until 1973, the album has seldom stayed in print for long, and surely owes at least a portion of its peculiar mystique to its rarity. With their latest reissue, Universal has kept the original tracklist intact, without unearthing any additional alternate or bonus material. The album has been splendidly re-mastered, however, and <em>An Electric Storm</em> remains a virtually requisite headphone experience with an otherworldly appeal that transcends its considerable influence. 
    </p>
<p>
    Like so many ambitious albums of the time, <em>An Electric Storm</em> is consciously split into two distinct sides, the first half dubbed ""Phase In"" and the second ""Phase Out"". On the first side, White Noise indulge their daffy pop appetites with such bizarre trinkets as the cartoonish ""Here Come the Fleas"" and ""Love Without Sound"", the sensuous track which first encouraged Blackwell to pony up the cash for the full album. With the aid of rotating vocalists Annie Bird, Val Shaw, and John Whitman, the songs on the album's first half are melodic and memorable, and often infused with a cheeky sense of humor. The group's quirky wit is perhaps best witnessed on ""My Game of Loving""; the album's notorious ""orgy"" track that follows an ecstatic bit of sexual frenzy with the sound of contented snoring. 
    </p>
<p>
    Things get considerably scarier during the lengthy ""Phase Out"" segment, which begins with the group's 11-minute ambient centerpiece ""The Visitations"". This death-defying piece, which reportedly took over 3 months in the studio to assemble, ostensibly tells the tale of a motorcycle accident and its supernatural aftermath. Packed dense with disembodied noises and eerie panning effects, this intense track can become addictively engrossing, a perfect slice of audio theater that one can't help but ride through to the very end.

<p>
    Vorhaus, Derbyshire and Hodgson took so long in recording <em>An Electric Storm</em> that Island started to get antsy, and well before completion the label began to demand the finished product. Presented with the challenge of such a time crunch, many groups might panic and fall back upon more conventional material. But true to their iconoclastic nature, White Noise instead improvised the still-astonishing ""The Black Mass- An Electric Storm in Hell"", a spirited cacophony layered thick with percussion, funereal chanting, and the tormented screams of the damned. Like the rest of <em>An Electric Storm</em>, this dark finale sounds quite unlike anything recorded before or since, and stubbornly refuses to ever settle in as background music. 
    </p>
<p>
    And this unrehearsed episode of grotesquerie provides <em>An Electric Storm</em> with a strangely appropriate ending, as it stands as one final monument to White Noise's unique inspiration and eccentric approach to technical problem-solving. Theoretically, with the benefit of all the ensuing advances in recording technology, it should be easier than ever for today's musicians to duplicate such a production. Perhaps this deceptive sense of ease is precisely why no one has ever really been able to do so.

High Places sing about dreaming. They sing about dreaming and evolution and writing letters-- to Mars, I think!-- and even though they sing about the haze of falling in love on ""Head Spins"", the closest they come to sex is watching hermaphroditic banana slugs swap sperm while clouds roll overhead.</p>
<p>This all happens in about nine minutes. Sure, they have a handful of other songs that they play live, but High Places are a relatively small, embryonic band, literally and metaphorically. There are only two members, Rob Barber and Mary Pearson. (Full disclosure: Pearson is the sister of a former Pitchfork employee.) They clink on glasses and hit hand drums and adorn them with spare guitar figures before sending everything through basic effects processors. In a recent interview I did with them, Barber explained, ""I got to a point with visual art where I just wanted to draw. And so, with music, I just thought, well, there's delay, and that's awesome. And you can pitch things down, and that's awesome. And you can position things in weird places around the room, and that's awesome. So that's all we did.""</p>
<p>So, think of the <i>High Places</i> EP as four short studies in escaping urban claustrophobia. Tripping out in your living room for a dollar a day. Without drugs. Barber has said that they feel like they're a very un-New York band, which seems off-- if anything, High Places' heavy-lidded sweetness and positivity are the kind of attitudes that make city life fresh, almost quietly surreal. Of course, they risk potshots from people too afraid-- too evolved?-- to appreciate, say, the way a leaf falls. Oh well. High Places are unflappable. They don't smile. These songs-- they're intimate enough to sleep in, rhythmic enough to dance to; lo-fi and simple, but strange enough to get lost in.</p>
<p>Gertrude Stein's long-form poem ""Tender Buttons"" was, prosody and etymological spurting aside, a book about warping the domestic into the unfamiliar. ""Table: A table means necessary places and a revision a revision of a little thing it means it does mean that there has been a stand, a stand where it did shake."" Yes! Yes. I can't reason it, but I can feel it-- it's a redefinition. High Places aren't modernist geniuses. Nobody will write books about them. But the effect is similar: take this small, ignorable, crappy thing and make it something else, something greener and more distant. Touch it, it's okay-- did you even realize it could feel like that?</p></div>"|10474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10474-high-places-ep/|8.2|Mike Powell

    second record from Missouri's Warhammer 48K and first for new Chicago label
    and store Permanent Records-- is every bit an apocalypse record. On ""Track One"",
    American general Ludwig Voninski speaks from and for ""what was once called the
    United States Midwest"": ""At this time, we are unsure whether we've been hit by
    bombs or ultra-violet rays...At this time, we ask everyone to pray as if there
    were a god,"" Voninski says flatly. He signs off; zombie moans mix with the
    blood-curdling cries of the living; a warped bass line and piercing guitar
    noise smother Karp-heavy drums. Two minutes later, everything collapses. If the
    end of the world is this frazzled, fucked-up, and fun, where's the dotted line?</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Despite its art-punk undercurrents and political
    overtones, though, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">An Ethereal Oracle</span><span>-- largely
    for the better-- doesn't take its explorations of the end too seriously. In fact,
    it sounds much like the record Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar might have made
    this decade had they found the right picture books about apocalyptic
    prophecies, the right influences (Hawkwind, a scratched and warped Crass LP,
    Abruptum), the right friends, and a revelatory strain of pot in the late 1990s.
    Five total dudes with names like Ram Shackle, Juan Turbulance, and SLAG, Warhammer
    48K gets to the apocalypse talk early: ""Save the last rave/ For the year 2012,""
    they chant over ghost chords and ritualistic drums on the second track,
    referencing the year of predicted Mayan ruin. They leave it alone. Rather, much
    of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">An Etheral Oracle</span><span> feels like
    psychedelic escapism, or about pursuing the slipstream of a song until the
    promise of demise fades like a fable. These forays occasionally tighten into
    perfect instrumental anthems, as with ""Track Three"". A bit like Shellac and
    Polvo, the riffs are big but the rhythms are bigger, setting up a sort of nocturnal
    high-speed chase that drops suddenly into silence, as though from an unseen
    cliff.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    That's part of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Oracle</span><span>'s
    ostensible attention-deficit disorder, which is both its blessing and its
    curse: On one hand, Warhammer 48K never gets mired in its own conceits, and
    this ""apocalypse record""-- musically varied, flipping from improvised doom quakes
    reminiscent of Spain's Orthodox on ""Knife Hits"" to the dancing days acidic
    acoustics of ""Track Five""-- feels much too adventurous to be defeatist or
    resigned to destruction. When the end comes, as it does when the instruments on
    ""Track Nine"" get so loud they start to crackle, it sucks only because it interrupts
    a crucial jam. Remember, after the first two tracks, there's no explicit
    mention of the apocalypse, even if there is a constant sense of teetering on a
    brink. The field recordings that close number two-- crickets chirping, birds warbling,
    a mammal maybe moving in the distance-- are slowly invaded and, eventually, smothered
    altogether.</span>
</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Just don't be surprised if, given so many ideas in a
    44-minute space, you sometimes want Warhammer 48K to hit you a bit harder, to
    take more shape, to come with a little more finesse. Lightning quick ""Knife Hits""
    has a lithe midsection lifted by two guitars scraping past one another,
    skipping over the cracks in the rhythm like survivors making haste. With
    another take, the grooves could be tighter, and the action would be tenser. As
    is, though, it's just a preparation for the track's perfect, brutal ending.
    Thankfully, that's an exception to the rule: Like the world or not, one hopes <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">An

And while some of his routines do lay judgement on Middle America (Republicans, overweight fast food consumers), he doesn't spare hipsters either. He never sinks into sneering condescension as David Cross so frequently does. And his careful timing eliminates the non-sequitur flights of fancy that labelmate Eugene Mirman's jokes become. This CD should be Patton Oswalt's biggest achievement this year, but it's not: He's the lead voice role in Disney's <em>Ratatouille</em> (which through last weekend had already grossed north of $175 million domestic).</p><p>
<em>
    Ratatouille</em>, the animated feature to which Oswalt lent his voice-over talents, was in the process of becoming a huge hit just as I received this album, so it's difficult for me to describe Patton Oswalt as an ""alternative"" comedian. Not that it was an appropriate label before. Years spent against the stand-up circuit's red-brick walls have given his act the perfectly measured timing and dynamic variation (one joke is ""like a Pixies song"") lacking in many ""alternative"" comedians. Even in the middle of what sounds like a drunken rant, Oswalt exhibits a masterful control over the tone and pacing of his material. Which isn't to say that <em>Werewolves and Lollipops</em> is an evening at the Improv. Fed up with the standard comedy clubs and two-drink minimums, Oswalt co-founded the Comedians of Comedy, a series of tours that bring stand-up comedians (usually Oswalt, Mirman, and Brian Posehn, among others) to small-to-moderately sized rock venues around the country.<br/>
<em><br/>
    Werewolves and Lollipops</em> conquers the big problem with most comedy CDs which is that they're often disposable after one or two listens. But when you recall one of Oswalt's jokes-- in particular, his bits about KFC bowls, his ""Physics for Poets"" class, and his deft handling of a show heckler-- you want to hear him deliver it, you don't just need to hear it again in your head, or repeat it to someone else.  His jokes about geriatric childbirth, birthdays, marriage, and expensive restaurants-- which sound way more like ""observational"" comedy than they actually are-- don't rely on pop culture knowledge, which will add to its life span as well. One way he packs so much in here is that he ignores transitions, sometimes blowing a raspberry as signal that a new bit's on deck. Oswalt's comedy isn't self-pitying either: After jokes about his weight (in photos he appears to be 5'1"", and made out of spent Bubblicious), he points out later that he used to get laid quite a bit. He laments that his ""geekiness is getting in the way of [his] nerdiness,"" but kicks off the show with a Dane Cook-style ""I'm drunk, here we go!""</p><p>
    The allusions to literature work well with Oswalt's  effortless, hyperbolic verbal dexterity.  It's obvious during his rant at the heckler, where he moves from stilted mock-serious phrases  (""when the cities are but dust... necromancers walking the wastelands..."") to plainer taunts (""you stupid douchenozzle"") to make fun of the interrupter. He never turns mean. Later he compares his worship of GG Allin and Harlan Ellison  to his current love of four-star chefs-- another moment that reveals his geekiness and, I think, the reason why his jokes stay well between David Cross-malicious and Demetri Martin-milquetoast. He softens many punchlines by singing them. All of this translates to an unpretentious likability, which may
    reflect Patton Oswalt as a person, but is most likely traceable, again,
    to an unrelenting professionalism. When much alternative comedy
    consists of clever tricks and YouTube videos, it's a relief just to
    hear someone tell a joke.</p></div>"|10494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10494-werewolves-and-lollipops/|8.0|Jessica Suarez

    Town Hall in New York City,"" writes Laurie Anderson in the liner notes to her
    newly reissued <em>Big Science</em>. ""The show was one week after 9/11, and as I sang, 'Here come the planes/ They're American planes,' I suddenly realized I was
    singing about the present.""</p><p>
    ""Suddenly?""<span>
</span>Methinks Anderson is being a touch disingenuous. On the night of
    September 11<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px""></span>, 2001, Anderson was performing at the Park West in
    Chicago. The air was heavy with dread, confusion, and anger. Waiting for the
    show to begin, the crowd was talking amongst itself, conversations running the
    gamut between those three poles. Anderson herself had allegedly spent much of
    the morning on the phone with her partner Lou Reed, who was back in New York--
    and supposedly sitting on the roof of their building watching the Twin Towers
    burn-- though she made nary a mention of the day's events once she started
    performing.</p><p>
    The crowd was dead silent throughout, but when Anderson
    began ""O Superman"" you could hear the room shift as the already menacing song
    took on new layers of eerily contemporary meaning. ""Hello? Is anybody home? Well, you don't know me, but I know
    you. And I've got a message to give to you. Here come the planes. So you better
    get ready."" The lyrics chimed out like an answering machine message sent to the
    future, picked up several decades too late.
    </p><p>
    That song's mix of politics, Zen-like aphorism, and sentimentalism
    hit like a punch to the gut as the nation stood on the precipice of the
    unknown, and the toll the collapse of the Twin Towers would truly take on this
    country-- and the world-- hadn't quite settled in. So: ""suddenly?"" No, surely Anderson recognized the renewed
    power of her (sole) unlikely hit well before she made it home to New York City.
    Then again, the almost mystically timeless song was in a way always about the
    shifting ""present."" Anderson writes that ""O Superman (For Massenet)"" was
    inspired by a composition from Jules Massenet's opera <em>Le Cid</em>, ""O Souverain"",
    which in turn reminded Anderson of Napoleon's fall at Waterloo. She had also
    taken into account the bungled U.S. rescue mission in Tehran. It's a song of
    military arrogance, failure and the price we all pay, recorded for a modest
    $500 with an NEA grant. In 1981, it went to No. 2 in the UK.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Big Science</em> comprises songs from Anderson's also quite
    prescient <em>United States</em> project, a multimedia performance art piece cum
    opera (""It seemed like everyone I knew was working on an opera,"" she recalls)
    that depicted America on the brink of digital revolution and capitalist
    nirvana, where the dollar trumped tradition and the apocalypse-- cultural,
    political, technological-- loomed large. In fact, given its themes and
    presentation, much of <em>Big Science</em> sounds every bit about ""the present"" as ""O
    Superman"" does, and its idiosyncratic execution (with stylistic nods to the
    minimalists and pal William S. Burroughs) has helped the disc weather the passage
    of time remarkably well. It's less a document of the early 1980s than it is a
    dark glimpse of the future recorded at the dawn of the Reagan era.
    </p>
<p>
    Anderson's ingenious move, musically, was utilizing the
    vocoder not as a trick but as a melodic tool. It's the first thing you hear on <em>Big Science,</em> looped in ""From the Air"" like some bizarre man-machine synth.
    The rest of the track revolves around a circular pattern of blurted sax figures
    and hypnotic drums. There's virtually nothing about it that screams its age as
    Anderson intones a wry announcement from a (caveman) pilot of a plummeting
    flight. ""There is no pilot,"" she speaks. ""You are not alone. Standby. This is
    the time. And this is the record of the time.""<span> </span>It's a metaphor for every frightening thing about 20<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px"">th</span>
    (and now 21<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px"">st</span> century) living you can think of, and in its spare way
    it's enough to scare you silly.
    </p>
<p>
    The gloomy ghost town future-music of the title track sounds
    like the rueful ruminations of someone who sees the end of the world on the
    horizon and can't help but to chuckle a little at their impending doom. The
    austere soundscapes of ""Walking &amp; Falling"" and ""Born, Never Asked"" convey a
    similar chilliness laced with a despair at once aloof and oddly wistful.
    ""Example #22"" is like a Can/Yoko/Eno chop-shop, its funky wordless denouement
    part chant, part celebration of the absurd.
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, one of the elements that makes <em>Big Science</em> so
    special is Anderson's sense of humor. In ""Let X=X"", Anderson offers, with a
    wink, ""I can see the future, and it's a place-- about 70 miles east of here.""
    It's a perverse punchline to some cosmic joke, and the human element back and
    forth of ""It Tango"" does little to dissipate the feeling that on <em>Big Science</em>
    it's the machines that are getting the last laugh at the expense of their
    masters. The
    future was yesterday. The future is now. Welcome to the future.

Richard Bishop, still best known for his work alongside his brother Alan and the recently departed Charles Gocher in the pan-ethnic garage-rock group Sun City Girls, has weathered all these comparisons-- and not without reason.</p><p>
    Thing about the Sun City Girls was each of their records was different, each a new challenge in shredding the comforts of American folk idioms with non-Western sounds, of beating out ornaments with aggression rather than manners. The No-Fi label recently released a 7"" of Bishop playing two SCG classics, <em>Torch of the Mystics</em>' ""Esoterica of Abyssynia"" and ""Space Prophet Dogon"". Bishop's playing is astonishing; he makes more clatter and bliss with an acoustic guitar than the trio did on the originals, plugged in. But SCG's actual songs were unclassifiable like John Fahey's were, which is why people compared him to avant-garde composers like Bela Bartok and bluesmen like Charley Patton in the same stroke, while everyone in his wake was just compared to <em>him</em>.</p><p>
    Bishop's solo stuff, though, has focused more on craft than on innovation, assimilating styles he's already gone over in his past, showing his ability to wander through a guitar with confidence and direction even when he's improvising. More and more, he's playing in idioms: <em>While My Guitar Violently Bleeds</em> doesn't sound like nothing you've ever heard before, it sounds like good things you've already heard plenty of times played with an impressive amount of skill.</p><p>
    But ""impressive amount of skill"" is one of those phrases employed to skirt a sore spot: Sometimes, Bishop's music sounds almost sterile in how archetypal it is. ""Here is my Middle Eastern fire,"" Bishop whispers with ""Zurvan""; ""Let me paint you a desiccated landscape from muffled feedback and reverb,"" he implores with ""Smashana"". And yes, Bishop can connote mystical shit even when he's just spinning his wheels, but these trips lose their dazzle the more we take them. Consider them utility players, not Gnostic texts or totems.</p><p>
    ""Mahavidya"", the 25-minute raga that fills out the album, is when Bishop lands his blow: He rumbles, he makes shapes, he hisses. Halfway in, he starts smacking the varnish off his guitar, and lo, it's not just for the sake of showing his plumage, but for the grace of musical idea-- it feels like it has to be there, even if it's hard to discern what that might mean for thirty seconds from now.</p><p>
    Massive wounds don't flow the way they do in movies. They look a little like John Fahey sounded: sudden, unpredictable, oddly without drama. <em>While My Guitar Violently Bleeds</em> has the same problems and charms all Bishop's do: Most of the time, it's smeared stage blood-- it looks more classically beautiful than the real thing, but it doesn't always chill the marrow.</p></div>"|10468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10468-while-my-guitar-violently-bleeds/|7.5|Mike Powell

While the Clean, the Chills, the Bats, and others made nearly-perfect garage-pop for Flying Nun, below ground a stream of more primal rock flowed freely, courtesy of Bruce Russell's Xpressway label. This Kind of Punishment, Alastair Galbraith, and the Dead C. (along with non-Xpressway cohorts like Tall Dwarfs and Cake Kitchen) created rough, impulsive music, equally interested in simple melody and spilling noise. With their distorted guitars, droning keyboards, and subdued singing, they eschewed polish in favor of raw sounds and ideas.</p><p>
    Though some of those bands have soldiered on, the Xpressway sound mostly dissolved with the label's mid-90s demise. So even though Pumice's <em>Pebbles</em> is essentially an Xpressway tribute album, for any fan of the style, it's a welcome knock-off. When New Zealander Stefan Neville (the one man behind Pumice) moans like Galbraith on ""Bold/Old"", duets with himself in Tall Dwarfs fashion on ""Stopover"", or rips out plodding Dead C. noise on ""Onion Union"", it's enough to make you dig out an old Ajax mailorder catalog and fantasize about filling the gaps in your Xpressway collection.</p><p>
    Which is not to say that Neville doesn't add his own ideas to <em>Pebbles</em> along the way. Though fully devoted to simple songs and raw sound, he sometimes applies those tenets to unexpected styles. On opener ""Eyebath"", his reddened guitar cuts out a rockabilly swing, while on the ""Spike/Spear"" he patiently builds a reverential, hymn-like drone.  Later, Neville's semi-falsetto and ukulele-like strums on ""Both Beasts"" create a mini-lullaby.</p><p>
    Despite that variety, <em>Pebbles</em> runs dry at times due to Neville's relentless distortion. His fuzzy edges can veer into overly-harsh abrasion, and his off-key tones can melt into mush, creating a kind of sonic nausea. Such moments beg for the more gentle, spacious acoustics of Pumice's previous Soft Abuse album, <em>Yeahnahvienna</em>. But Neville's varied track record suggests he'll someday fuse those styles; until then, Pebbles sits well in his growing catalogue-- a nice salute to a sound that not just anyone could replicate.</p></div>"|10481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10481-pebbles/|7.0|Marc Masters

The Australian quartet owed Bomp! Records big time when the label released their 2002 debut and generated a decent buzz for the group, but espousing themselves to Bomp!'s de facto popular kid the Brian Jonestown Massacre wasn't necessary in repaying the favor. The Lovetones, a band that's shared studios and tour buses with the BJM, now apparently shares their cohorts' disappointing ability to tap the Summer of Love's most mediocre aspects. However, Lovetones frontman Matthew Tow's finely honed singer-songwriter sensibilities differ him from BJM head Anton Newcombe. Whereas Newcombe tries to commandeer faux-Stones or faux-MC5 tunes far more fitting for a synergetic group, Tow takes aim at more singular inspirations. David Bowie, John Lennon, Lou Reed, and their more modern soundalikes permeate this album, though Tow's limited vocal presence keeps expectations in check.</p><p>
    To their credit, the Lovetones make a marked effort to steer away from obvious touchstones on Axiom, a change from the heavy-handed homages on 2005's <em>Meditations</em>. <em>Axiom</em> begs the question though of whether or not the band's chops pack enough punch to stand without the crutch of instantly recognizable and likable classic rock accouterments. Stripped down, melody-driven tracks like ""Wintertime in Hollywood"", ""Say You Will"", and ""Alone"" dabble in the margins of classic and indie rock, taking a little Beatles there, a little Matthew Sweet or R.E.M. there, and topping the whole thing off with the nasally drawl of Britpop. Originality aside though, these numbers lack the memorability of <em>Axiom</em>'s more heavily stylized songs. ""Pieces of Me""'s space-age chord changes and showtune grandeur nods to Ziggy Stardust, and the band's obviously not trying to hide ""Please Don't Break My Heart Tonight,"" an 8-minute centerpiece of Pink Floyd-style conscience-bending.</p><p>
    Despite these exceptions, <em>Axiom</em> will most likely leave your heartstrings taut and your mind not blown. The band hardly gets worked up over one mid-tempo pop song after another, so why should listeners? While critics rail against the BJM for their self-mythologizing and self-important songwriting, the Lovetones could stand to curb the modesty and risk making mistakes. Sure, visions of reaching rock heaven alongside their favorite icons would be foolish, but these guys shouldn't stay caged in <em>Axiom</em>'s sobering reality.</p></div>"|10472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10472-axiom/|5.3|Adam Moerder

    first to receive the commemorative 10th anniversary treatment. That's not to suggest the album is superior to Dave Grohl's 1995 Foos debut (it's not), but its double-platinum sales did mark the band's permanent
    transformation from humble hobby project into the grunge Wings: i.e., a band
    that could never claim the same cultural impact as its antecedent, but that
    can at least get played just as much on KROQ. And that was to be expected--
    <em>The Colour and the Shape</em>'s 1997 release was perfectly timed to herald
    modern rock radio's shift from grunge's roar to emo's wail.</p><p>
    More so than the Foo Fighters' debut-- a homemade, self-recorded collection
    of demos Grohl had accumulated while manning Nirvana's drum stool-- <em>The
    Colour and the Shape</em> presented a true picture of the kind of group Grohl
    wanted to be in, had he not been sidetracked by the job of drumming for the
    biggest American rock band of the early 1990s. But despite Grohl's
    dream-team assembly-- Pixies producer Gil Norton, Germs guitarist Pat Smear,
    Sunny Day Real Estate bassist Nate Mendel, and former Alanis Morrissette
    drummer Taylor Hawkins (who joined after the album's recording)-- that band
    would turn out to be much more formulaically mall-punk than the Foos' torn
    'n' frayed debut suggested.</p><p>
    On that first album, Grohl displayed a remarkable deftness for balancing
    melody and menace-- even as the rocket-launcher riffs of ""This Is a Call""
    and ""I'll Stick Around"" shot into the red, he never lost his cool. On <em>The
    Colour and the Shape</em>, the noise/pop relationship feels more forced, like Grohl's trying too hard to grind down his sweet tooth into a
    fang, dressing up virtually every song in a chrome-plated guitar gilding
    that boosts the volume and fidelity, but ultimately dulls the impact. Maybe he's overcompensating for being a softie at heart: the gentlest turns
    are either presented as brief teasers (the 84-second opener ""Doll""),
    are appended with portentous, power-ballad choruses (""February Stars""), or are muted
    into a blur (""Walking After You"", which reappeared in improved, revised form
    on <em>The X-Files</em> movie soundtrack). Or just contrast the first album's
    standout single ""Big Me"" with <em>The Colour</em>'s ""Up in Arms"", two melodically
    similar songs in vastly different packaging: Where the former is content to
    coast as a simple, gentle jangle, the latter resorts to a soft/loud
    about-face that feels like nudge-wink schtick.</p><p>
    Listening to the album a decade later, it's clear the singles were singles for
    a reason: ""Monkey Wrench"" romps like a typical Grant Hart Hüsker Dü
    number but is given a massive kick by Grohl's climactic,
    hoarse-throated third verse, and ""My Hero"" strikes the uncharted middle
    ground between sensitive-guy vulnerability and Super Bowl pre-game show
    soundtrack. And then, of course, there's the song that's kept me from
    unloading this disc at the used-record store: ""Everlong"", one the most
    affecting, passionate rock songs of the 1990s-- Sonic Youth's ""Teenage Riot""
    recast as Weezer's ""Say It Ain't So"". (And yet, not even this pensive ode to
    blossoming romance is immune from the Foos' jokester tendencies-- thanks
    to its horror-spoof video, every time I hear this song I picture Taylor
    Hawkins in a Goldilocks outfit.)</p><p>
    The six B-sides tacked onto this anniversary edition-- four of them covers--
    would seemingly serve as little more than excuse for the Foos to goof off, but in effect they lend the '97 Foos more, well, color and shape.
    On the album proper, Grohl shrieks that he doesn't get ""enough space,"" but
    the robo-punk redux of Vanity 6's ""Drive Me Wild"" and the dub-metal prowl
    through Gary Numan's ""Down in the Park"" give the Foos room to explore the
    outer edges of their pop-punk parameters. Even the song most susceptible
    to the vagaries of kitsch, Gerry Rafferty's smooth-rock standard ""Baker
    Street"", is played with a straight face, and proves an ideal complement to
    Grohl's voice (though it also proves you shouldn't send a guitar to do a
    sax's job). The final bonus cut is the caterwauling, feedback-screeched
    title track, which was left off the original tracklist yet provides the only
    real evidence on this whole album that one of the Foo Fighters used to be in
    The Germs.</p><p>
    Then again, this album was always about severing ties to the past, with Grohl's
    post-relationship purging (""I was always caged and now I'm freeeee!"")
    doubling as a metaphor for his promotion from drummer to camera-ready
    frontman. At the time of <em>The Colour and the Shape</em>'s release, many
    interpreted ""My Hero"" as a requiem for Kurt Cobain. But if there's a
    conversation going on between Grohl and his fallen friend here, it's in the
    arena-sized chorus of ""Hey, Johnny Park"", when he wonders, ""Am I selling you
    out?"" As the subsequent 10-year string of radio hits has shown, it's a
    question Grohl would never have to ask again.</p></div>"|10473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10473-the-colour-and-the-shape-10th-anniversary-special-edition/|5.8|Stuart Berman

    There's a reason the Concretes' latest album title comes in
    the form of a greeting, and it's not that they've secretly guessed Ryan
    Schreiber's middle name. The Swedish septet's recent woes have been well-documented:
    <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/36397-the-concretes-latest-victims-of-gear-theft"">gear
    theft</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/36401-concretes-cant-catch-a-break-cancel-rest-of-us-tour"">canceled
    tour</a></strong>, lead singer Victoria Bergsman <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/37547-victoria-bergsman-leaves-the-concretes"">taking
    off</a></strong> for Taken By Trees. But the group's third proper album, <em>Hey Trouble</em>-- their first without Bergsman--
    doesn't wallow in all the shit hitting the fan (that'd be gross). Instead,
    the new record greets head-on the group's legacy of Jesus &amp; Mary Chain swirl
    and sashaying girl-group sweetness.</p><p>
    As far as that's a step back from the piano-led schmaltz of
    2006's <em>In Color</em>, it's actually a step forward for the group. At the
    same time, any similarities to the Concretes' 2004 self-titled breakthrough
    only underscore the ways the current effort falls short. Pop gets tangled up
    with memory on <em>Hey Trouble</em>, sometimes
    in a far more overt way than on the group's previous releases (which, like much
    Swedish pop, have demonstrated a deep knowledge of classic records).
    Drummer-turned-frontwoman Lisa Milberg gives the new Concretes a wobbly,
    Bergsman-like center, and backing singer Maria Eriksson has already proved her
    chops with little-known side project Heikki. Neither, however, can match the former
    singer's distinctive charms.</p><p>
    The songs on <em>Hey
    Trouble </em>talk about pop's ineffable magic more often than they conjure it.
    All too aware of post-departure success stories like Fleetwood Mac's transformation after the exit of Peter
    Green, the Concretes make their biggest sonic leap on first single
    ""Kids"", opting for a forgettable lap-pop sheen. The song recounts
    Milberg and Eriksson's long-shared love of music, with a chorus suggesting
    life is but a song (""Let's go back to the part/ We still know by heart"").
    Second single ""Oh Boy"" fares better, as longtime producer Jari
    Haapalainen brings back the dramatic gestures and reverb-heavy shuffle of the
    Concretes' best songs. Milberg's voice is more exposed on slower tracks like
    finale ""Simple Song"", which takes the pop referentiality of past
    singles like the exquisite ""You Can't Hurry Love"" to an uncomfortable
    conclusion: ""I just walk away like Renee,"" Milberg sings, and then the horns
    quote John Denver's ""Annie's Song"". 
    </p>
<p>
    The Concretes and Bergsman may have gone their separate
    ways, but both are at times sounding more and more like the same band: Camera
    Obscura. The Scottish group's Tracyanne Campbell wrote perhaps the best song on
    Taken By Trees' new <em>Open Field</em>, and <em>Hey Trouble </em>producer Haapalainen was also behind Camera Obscura's latest, 2006's <em>Let's Get
    Out of This Country</em>. Here, ""A Whale's Heart"" comes too close to JAMC
    for Campbell &amp; co., but the melancholic sway of ""Didion"" or Motown
    bounce of ""Are You Prepared"" would seem just as at home on either
    indie-pop group's albums.
    </p>
<p>
    Even as Haapalainen's contributions continue to bolster the Concretes, other collaborations on <em>Hey
    Trouble </em>bear less fruit. Labelmate Frida Hyvönen provides an extra set of
    vocals on round-style opener ""Hey Trouble"", a fragment that sounds
    like A Sunny Day in Glasgow
    without the psychedelic haze. ""If We're Lucky We Don't Get There on Time"", a
    duet with Little Wings' Kyle Field, is a travel song at a tortoise's pace.
    The Concretes should be commended for bouncing back, but <em>Hey Trouble</em> won't knock you over the way <em>The Concretes</em> did. It was a pleasure, then.

    Marmoset's previous full-length, 2001's 13-song, 33-minute exercise in Anglophilic indie <em>Record in Red</em>, quietly ranks among the best albums released by Secretly Canadian. The Indianapolis natives, one of the label's first discoveries in 1997, have been fairly compared to fellow corn-belters Guided by Voices, yet the core songwriting duo of Jorma Whittaker and Dave Jablonski err more toward Syd Barrett than the Who. The subsequent release of just one EP, 2002's <em>Mishawaka</em>, has resulted in Marmoset's public persona-- or more appropriately, its complete lack thereof-- adopting the withdrawn disposition of its music.<em></em></p><p>
<em>Florist Fired</em>, 16 songs from sessions dating back to late 2003, is the result of that quiet patience. The record locates a middle ground between <em>Red</em> and its predecessor, the more experimental <em>Today It's You</em>, with the duo still traversing the spectrum of sub-three minute lo-fi indie rock. There aren't quite the bonafide indie-rock earworms here like ""Forever We Ignite"" or ""Lost Days for Ways"", but there is plenty that could still only come from this particular band, a claim few groups of their ilk can make. Marmoset still sounds like a lot of other bands (Beat Happening, Swell Maps, Sebadoh, Velvet Underground are usually cited) but their twisted amalgam of psychedelia, sexuality, and off-kilter melodicism remains undeniably unique.</p><p>
    As indicated in the refrain of <em>Florist</em>'s furiously fuzzed title track, ""Please go away/ There's nothing I can say,"" the band's most recognizable attribute here is Whittaker and Jablonski's shared interest in the frequent weirdness of human contact.  With the type of curious deadpan shared by Donovan and Lou Reed, Whittaker's voice can suggest ambivalence, but his intentions are often anything but.  For two <em>Florist</em> songs the mordant, avant-sinister persona of <em>Red</em>'s ""Art-Maker"" (chorus: ""Art maker/ Strangulator"") reappears, stressing the sexual and ghoulish attributes of his whisper.  The creepy come-on ""Eat Me Out"" is asking exactly what you think it is, in a baleful dialect akin to ""Gouge Away"".  Later, ""Butterknife"" veers into gothic/camp territory of a different culinary stripe, querying ""I want you to cut my food/ To make it safe to chew"".
    </p>
<p>
    Jablonski's contributions here veer toward detail-driven meditations on antisociality as well, apparently inspired by a soured partnership. The atonal, heavily-echoed ""I Saw Your Shadow"" is a chilly stream-of-consciousness that could have come from Jandek-- after knocking, he sees a shadow appear under the door, then disappear. Instead of knocking again, he chooses the path of intense rumination. The dour, elegant ""Dropping Dimes"" is wearily attuned to the exhaustion of a expiring romance, affirmed by the sapped realization that ""there's no future in making a fuss about coffee in the morning"".<em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Florist</em>'s best moments come when the duo lighten up a bit; for Jablonski, it's the hopeful acoustic cadence of ""Missing Man"" (""you could be free, or become a missing person, a missing man"").  Whittaker's playful side is the real recommendation, though-- it's only a short slip from his earlier grim propositions into dotty Skip Spence territory.  ""Apples"", co-written with Casey Tennis of fellow Indianapolites Margot &amp; the Nuclear So &amp; So's, once more indulges Whittaker's inner epicure, and closer ""Personality Candyspots"" seems to be a tenderly transmitted skin affliction.  The langorous ""Pass it Along"" is <em>Florist</em>'s highlight, however: circulating confusion seldom sounds as enticing as when Whittaker rhymes that recommendation with the line ""everybody's wrong when they're singing this song.""  It's more than a little devious, yet strangely soothing at the same time; resistance isn't quite futile, but you know you want to give in for a few.<br/>

In the intervening span, Gut became practically a thread unto herself in Berlin's underground art and music scenes. She explored cross-sections of new wave, techno, spoken word, multimedia art, and experimental rock in bands like Mania D, Malaria!, Matador, and Project Miasma. There have been film scores, radio plays, videos projects, gallery exhibitions, remixes, a record label, DJ gigs, and the eclectic, collective radio show ""The Ocean Club"". It seems as if Gut has tried just about everything except the obvious-- making a proper solo album.</p><p>
    Now she can tick that off her list as well. It's surprising that it's taken her so long to get around to it, even more so that the album is ingenuous and approachable at a career point when Gut could get away with being as pretentious as she liked. Her zigzagging trajectory through Berlin music is certainly compressed in <em>I Put a Record On</em>, but to interpret her solo album as a career-capping statement is to miss the point. As its title so simply declares, it is a straightforward appreciation-- a record about liking records.</p><p>
    While Gut's solo debut has certain overarching qualities-- her Marlene Dietrich-style purr, which implies a good-humored Teutonic chic; smeary, grayscale hazes of techno and dub; and a dark, crackling energy-- its stylistic divagations can be mapped only along the ley lines of Gut's musical honorees. The liner notes of the vinyl LP link each song to an artist, place, or concept that inspired it, and many of Gut's more predictable influences are present. ""Cry Easy"" pays homage to ESG with stiff, percolating funk, building bar by looped bar toward an itchy canter. ""Blätterwald"" leavens New Order's anthemic new wave with power-tool synths, and ""The Land"" is lambent, minimal techno in The Field's vein, couched in Gut's proclivity for detuned shimmy.
    </p><p>
    But some of the best tracks here find Gut dovetailing more surprising influences with her playful, rough-hewn electro. Nowhere is her mischievous spirit more apparent than on ""Rock Bottom Riser"", the only actual cover on the album. Remaking Smog's folk dirge as a galumphing seether sounds like an awful idea on paper, but Gut pulls it off with aplomb, singing all around the beat and breaking into giggles near the end. She completely overhauls the song while remaining true to its spirit, making the impish energy undergirding all of Smog's music explicit. 
    </p>
<p>
    She also has an affinity for adventurous undie-hop: the shadowy, dubby billows of ""Sweet"" takes their cue from Dabrye, and cLOUDDEAD inspired the sweetly fractured nursery song ""The Wheel"".  And album standout ""Move Me"", where snatches of polka are caught up in a scintillating web of swirling synths and ice-blue vocals, is dedicated simply to ""Buenos Aires"". Gut seems to understand that being able to get away with anything doesn't make it a good idea, and, paired with the confidence to wear her influences, quite literally, on her sleeve, she's produced an album that's charmingly humble and musically satisfying in equal measure.

If <em>Underground Communication</em> is any indication, his preferred method for fighting the system and tearing down the artificial plastic robot assembly-line spoon-fed plugged-into-the-Matrix horrors of mainstream commercial radio pop is to sound about 10 years out of date. The record comes across like the end result of that weird period in the late 90s when boutique labels and 2 a.m. MTV programs tried to cram disparate genres of electronic music into the same slot and maybe use the resulting ill-defined generic digital gunk to remix Redman or something. The overall sound feels like a mixture of jungle with all the bass but none of the ferocity or unpredictability, big beat with all the obviousness and none of the fun, gabber's punchiness drained of velocity and rage, and a largely funkless simulation of hip-hop that couldn't recognize the Apache break after 16 bars.</p><p>
    Most of the parts don't fit because they seem largely secondary to Ashton's main musical fetish, which consists of bass drops and plenty of'‘em. They're almost uniformly identical-sounding-- a guttural series of blorps and blurps that sound like the low-end from Roots Manuva's ""Witness (1 Hope)"" forced to ceaselessly toil in Bassnectar's underground beat mines. And while he sometimes changes up the gimmickry (a  Shakey's Pizza honky-tonk piano in ""Carried Away""; new age tinkle-synths in ""Impossible and Overwhelming""), practically the entire first half of the album and most of the second rides on an overwhelmingly repetitive approach to laying down actual beats. The drum programming beneath all that bass tends to sound undeveloped and perfunctory, using the same stock sounds and superficially switching them up just enough that it doesn't feel like listening to the hippie-rave equivalent of a Wesley Willis album.</p><p>
    As an instrumental record, <em>Underground Communication</em> would merely be a dull, half-remembered rehash of breaktronica circa 1999, but it's a ""rap"" record, albeit one where the most famous participant comes from <em>ego trip's The (White) Rapper Show</em>. Persia does attempt to hold it down for two tracks-- the irritating pseudo-glitch of ""Bomb the Blocks"" and the flatulent ""Kick It Complex""-- but it's kind of hard to make a judgment call on anything but the general timbre of her voice when half the words and most of the nuances are buried under all those Missile Command explosion SFX. Less undecipherable is Seasunz, who appears on three tracks and has a way of making relatable sentiments like ""everybody party"" or ""this beat is sick"" or ""stop global genocide now"" sound like fatuous bullshit; the title track's condemnation of ""greedy illegitimates, Democratic and Republican/sell guns for funds, indigenous exterminants"" might resonate a bit more clearly without such a forcibly highfalutin' attempt at assonance.</p><p>
    If tall bikes had subwoofers, this is the kind of music they'd bump during Critical Mass: A showy obstacle that claims it's resisting merely by existing but doesn't integrate itself into any sort of flow-- traffic, musical or otherwise. Ashton still thinks he can use it to combat the gloss of mainstream rap, as he put it to the <em>East Bay Express</em> earlier this year: ""When you think about this music based on this African beat, and it's not this silly white beat, it's a heavy, disturbing, sexual beat, and then over that you have not singing, not making melody, but rhythmic, aggressive yelling. That genre could have done anything, but instead it's become so goofy."" Funny-- you'd think a dude like this would hate cultural imperialism.</p></div>"|10485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10485-underground-communication/|2.8|Nate Patrin

    Having made the leap in just three albums from four-track lo-fi recordings to stunning mid-fi, the Thermals aren't exactly prized for innovation. Cracking open their vaults doesn't promise a whole lot of surprises. But consistency remains a virtue even for groups that can count their releases on one hand, and Hutch Harris and co. don't even break their streak on a promotional live record. Previous Insound tour support outings held a lot of hidden gems for fans, and while there's only one new song here to speak of, they've picked a sure bet to kickstart the series again. The fidelity here moves from live-in-the-studio radio shows to homespun demos, but thankfully, the Thermals write simple, effective songs that sound great in any cast, whether it's a rough live recording or a quick acoustic sketch.</p><p>
    The disc begins with a recent radio session for KEXP, picking four tracks from their latest, <em>The Body, the Blood, the Machine</em>. Opening on ""Returning to the Fold"" is particularly inspired, as it's an overlooked highlight whose lyrics added a note of hesitation and ambiguity to what could have been an album of one-note Bush-bashing and conservative baiting, given its loose concept. It sounds like the session was recorded when they band were still just three members strong (before touring with an added guitarist), and the guitars don't suffer or drop out while Harris hits all his notes and his vocals retain the same ranting drama and bile. Still, these versions aren't much different from their album counterparts: Guitars still chug out the changes, Harris' cutting yelp still hovers above the fray somewhere while singing melodies indelible by the second listen, the rhythm section still bounds like a hyperactive child, and it's still hilarious in when Harris rhymes ""bill"" with ""feel"" on  ""I Might Need You to Kill.""</p><p>
    More live tracks follow, with the bulk of the disc coming from a concert at Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco, featuring songs culled from their previous two albums and much more spirited performances. ""Back to the Sea"" is only <em>Body</em> track here, and while it does mark a change in the relentless tempo, it sounds sluggish and out of place amongst the older material. ""A Passing Feeling"" shines out in particular, as its brief voice-and-drum break seems to gain more charm the faster it's played. 
    </p>
<p>
    The unreleased song ""Welcome to the Planet"" introduces the acoustic segment that closes the record, and unfortunately it's a disappointment, too long by half and one of the only instances where Harris' lyrics are so inane they sink the irrepressible melody. It's redeemed by acoustic versions of ""I Know the Pattern"" and ""A Pillar of Salt"", slightly cleaned up and refined in their stripped-down form, but whatever they've lost in urgency they gain in poignancy.  So God bless the Thermals for keeping it simple, for writing a political album whose greatest conceit is rhyming ""tornadoes"" and ""nazi halos,"" and for not losing sight of what made them great in the first place. If they'd simply made three albums that proved three- or four-chord punk-pop still has life in it, that would have been plenty. The high note they're still riding makes this particular barrel worth scraping, for fans or anyone else.

While it was admirably cohesive for an impulsive collaboration, it didn't achieve a complete synthesis of aesthetics-- the elongated, coruscating drones sounded like pure Larsen, while the eruptive shards of dissonance and electro workouts were pure Stewart.</p><p>
    The even more ponderously titled <em>¿Spicchiology?</em> doesn't feel radically different than <em>Ciautistico!</em>, but it does feel more developed, and winds up leaving a stronger impression in the bargain. This time, Stewart brought his Xiu Xiu partner Caralee McElroy along on his Italian adventure, with counterintuitive results. Rather than sounding more like Xiu Xiu than <em>Ciautistico!</em>, the influence is less apparent: Vocals are sparse, and splattery electro-pop seldom interrupts the album's slow, shadowy undulation. The perkier side of XXL has been severely quashed here, leaving a vast armature of obsidian sound in its place. If it favors either band's style, it's Larsen's diaphanous post-rock. But it's really a full-bodied amalgamation, Xiu Xiu's nightmarish austerity infiltrating every corner of their collaborators' usual varicolored washes.</p><p>
    But let's zero in on that ""vast armature,"" because it is the most immediate and evocative impression the album conveys, and it couldn't have happened if it weren't so formally harmonized. There's nothing metaphorical about discussing music and architecture in similar terms, as the same transaction-- the imposition of the human will on space (one conceptual, one physical)-- undergirds both. Despite the disparity of the media, we think about music and buildings in similar terms of structure, volume, harmony, and style (where functionality dissolves into pure aesthetic form). So the intuitive leap between the dilapidated grandeur of <em>¿Spicchiology?</em> and a moldering mansion is a small one.
    </p><p>
    Funerary ranks of Farfisa and electric viola stretch out like dank, drafty hallways, impossibly long, periodically sweeping up into great spiral staircases. Gongs and glockenspiels flicker from the dimness like recessed sconces. These gloomy passages are shot through with a gilt scrollwork of metallurgical electronics and decorative banjo. Distorted protuberances jut from the corners like stone gargoyles. All the while, shimmering pianos, guitars, and synthesizers filter weakly through the overriding roar, like late-day light through lace curtains. Stewart and McElroy wander these endless halls, occasionally bursting into abstracted song that puts oblique words to the abiding <em>tristezza </em>embodied in the music.
    </p>
<p>
    And like the manor it sketches out, the album contains a multiplicity of detail within the tumbledown order of its form. The fat, rubbery tones of ""So Easy, So Cheap"" are sunk in a morass of monkish harmonies that shrill out infernally, and the tense creepshow organ that organizes ""Daydrinking"" is flecked with broken glass. The crystalline arrangements of ""The Green Count Tapes"" and ""...Nothing About Dwarves?"" are wracked by hordes of malevolent machines. Stewart spends most of his scant vocal time in the aching, syrupy mode familiar from Xiu Xiu songs like ""Fabulous Muscles (Mama Black Widow Version)"", as on the slow-burning weeper ""Little Mouse of the Favelas"" or the sidewinding electro-pop of ""King of Koalas"", which threatens to disrupt the album's mesmerizing thrall. But it quickly settles back into its dark groove, climaxing with epic closer ""The Tale of Brother Cakes and Sugar Dust""-- an archetypal version of post-rock's slo-mo mushroom cloud on Godspeed's dwarfing scale. 
    </p>
<p>
    For all of its majestic instrumentation and its gradual kneading of musical themes, it's tempting to regard <em>¿Spicchiology?</em> as symphonic. But commanding structure and flutes alone do not a symphony make. Lacking a fuller range of emotional and mimetic expressivity, the album is closer to a series of fugues. As such, it has a sense of grinding persistence, orderly yet shifting, like the spectral houses so many of us wander in our dreams, with just as little discernible meaning.
    </p>
<p>
    Is ""Spicchiology"" a religion, as the pie chart printed on the CD, which measures it against ""Other Religions"" and ""Non-Religious"", suggests? Is the band's preoccupation with in-title punctuation conceptual, or is it a diabolical scheme to make bloggers surf through fifty windows to find their system's character map? Are the characters of the Green Count and the Brother Cakes, which are pictured as silverware-and-food sculptures on the album's package, significant, or red herrings? While <em>¿Spicchiology? </em>is presented as a work in code, nothing about it suggests the code might have a solution. In XXL's house of tarot cards, interpretation fails, replaced by a simpler interface: You go up the stairs, and then you go down, catching whatever unseen gusts fall along the way.

    Not too many people can make maturity and mundanity sound attractive or, god forbid, sexy, but Harlan T. Bobo, age unknown, certainly can. <em>I'm Your Man</em> is only his second album, but already he manages to sound genuinely world-weary, if not (he'll admit) particularly wise. On the jauntily strummy title track, he seduces a woman by saying he'll treat her kids like his own-- an almost comic understatement of a traditional blues come-on. Bobo doesn't even try to pass himself off as anything but a fixer-upper: ""I skip parties and dodge all your friends,"" he sings candidly, the line evoking a scene of desperate passes and lowered expectations. Likewise, the remark ""A pragmatic woman is the only kinda woman can make a good man outta me,"" from ""Pragmatic Woman"", implies overdrawn checking accounts, messy rooms, and a woman with a big job on her hands.</p><p>
    Singing in a grainy barroom tenor that barely suppresses his ironies, irritations, and mannish-boy insecurities, Bobo sees the humor in these lyrics, but never plays his songs strictly for laughs. The album suggests that he knows he's been wasting his time and has fewer opportunities because of it: ""I don't do what I should,"" he sings on ""My Life"", ""to make my life good."" As his opportunities dwindle, he sees death looming just beyond the reach of his lyrics. ""My Life"" and ""Last Step"" worry over the inevitable end, but such gravity bumps elbows with winking levity. ""Baptist Memorial"", with its doo-wop backing vocals and organ pulsing like a heart monitor, finds him hospitalized; as his doctors warn against strenuous movement or overexcitement, all he can think of is the hot RN and ""a time when you dressed as my nurse/ It really turned us on.""</p><p>
    Bobo may be trying to settle down, but musically he's still playing the field. <em>I'm Your Man</em> is all over the place: muddy guitar rock, acoustic folk in the Leonard Cohen vein (of course), hell-bent country that pours some out for Townes Van Zandt. There are some specifically Memphis notes as well, such as the Reigning Sound guitars on the chorus of ""My Life"" and the slightly-higher-than-lo-fi Grifters scuzz on ""God's Lamb"" and ""Sick of It"". That's appropriate considering the local who's who that guests on the album: there's a Grifter (Dave Shouse), two Reigning Sounds (Alex Greene and Jeremy Scott), and a former Afghan Whig (Paul Buchignani), as well as Doug Easley, Alicja Trout, and local horn players Jim Spake and Scott Thompson. Bobo seems game for any direction they want to take him, amiably presiding over the crowded proceedings as if holding court at the P&amp;H. The result is a homegrown album that ably exploits Bobo's local connections, his musical eccentricities, his grim self-reflective humor, and his painfully heightened sense of irony.
    </p>
<p>
    After he finally pledges his loyalty to that pragmatic single mom, she promptly dumps him. The final two songs allow him to vent his resentment and lick his wounds: ""One of These Days"" might sound particularly nasty without his resigned vocals and the song's airy Morricone vibe, and closer ""Pretty Foolish Things"", recorded live at local indie station WEVL, is the lesson learned: ""I can't be trusted with cash,"" he sings, then later: ""I can't be trusted with love/ I always throw away my love on pretty foolish things... like you.""

So many of the diabolical genre's trappings were disgorged by one-man-band visionary and scene godfather Quorthon, the mastermind behind Bathory: the guttural screamy vocals, the lo-fi production style, and especially the whole Satan/viking paganism stuff. Fellow Swede, Pär Gustafsson, is the one-man black metalworker known as Bergraven.</p><p>
    On <em>Dödsvisioner</em>, his second album and first for his U.S. label Hydra Head, one can easily trace Gustafsson's evilosity to his fellow shrieking countryman Quorthon, but being signed to the indie metal imprint connotes a discernible difference: For one, Bergraven shows a definite influence from the increasingly influential U.S.-variety of one-man-alone-in-the-basement misanthropes such as Xasthur (helmed by Malefic), Leviathan (brainchild of Wrest), and most notably, Wrest's more ambient and arty project Lurker of Chalice. But also, and pretty rare for hard-core undie BM, Bergraven displays an obvious influence from the American metalgaze school such as Isis. (Sorta taboo for a genre known for it's slavish loyalty to ""true"" underground sounds.)</p><p>
    The varied influences here is what clearly works best, taking you on an ever-shifting journey of dark-- <em>Dödsvisioner</em> does mean ""death visions""-- and rhythmically morphing jams: On opener ""Döende"" a long-silence fades into barely audible choral-singing and wind-sounds rolling in like storm clouds to block the sun for Damien Thorn's (sixth, natch) birthday party right before the nanny hangs herself. The neck-snappin' moment would probably correspond to what happens nearly three minutes in when a Tom G. (Celtic Frost) Warrior-- like ""ergh!"" grunt cues the start up for the badass creepy-crawly groove guitar, the mid-tempo plodding drums, the bloody larnyx shrieks, and the weird clunky xylophone sounds-- this is not your grandpappy's Darkthrone or Mayhem variety of extreme Scandinavian metal.</p><p>
    ""Känsla Av Livets Nästa Skede"" is a chunky midtempo stomper that keeps taking levitational time-outs via post-rocked atmospherics (think Isis) and proggy ax lines that <em>most definitely</em> copies some necromancy from forward-thinking BM Norwegians Enslaved. Like Enslaved, Gustafsson knows how to add twisted, yet melancolic six-string action-- often evocative of bad acid-eating experimental Frenchies Blut Aus Nord-- and how to bumper his strange and spooky fixations with crafty riffalicous rock. But Bergraven's rock flirtations shuttle-off too quickly revisiting the shadowy bits instead: ""Den Svarta Angstens Essens"" and ""Det Man Med Själen..."" spend way too much time in spider-webbed chorus-guitar haze-- similar to fellow Swedes Opeth's prog-goth forest romps.</p><p>
    For a BM record it's produced superbly (guitars and drums sound huge and heavy), there's lots of color (besides black and grey), and the frequent scenery changes (especially the modern BM rock nuggets) work great, but by the time ""Ekot Av Bikt"" arrives (song seven), the third in a row (and about fifth on the record) with the slow paced, noodling watery clean guitar weaves, things get same-y and beg for editorial guidance (most songs come in around seven minutes). If the dude can keep read up on the copious incantations he's collected in his spellbook and learn to write songs as adroitly as he crafts riffs and textures, Bergraven will be an unbeatable adversary.</p></div>"|10467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10467-dodsvisioner/|7.1|D.

But that's not Client's style: They're one of few synth acts I've heard who seem to lack personality mostly by accident. It's hard to even pinpoint where that sensation comes from. It's not in their music, which is certainly up (one of) my alley(s): chilly, elegant electro-pop, poised and businesslike, full of hooks. It's not in their image, which is a good match for the sound-- first two and now three women, semi-anonymous, dressed up in sleek 80s businesswear and flight-attendant uniforms that go perfectly with the luxury and efficiency they're trying to conjure. <em>Heartland</em>, their third album, is the kind of full-on solid record I barely even expect to hear these days, every track as concise and hook-filled as the last. Apart from the lyrics, they have all the bases covered: Anyone looking for reliable synth-pop thrills will find something to enjoy in just about every song.</p><p>
    The vagueness of those lyrics might be a clue to the problem, though: Client don't seem to have much that they're actually trying to get across to us. It's not just a matter of electro detachment, either. This, after all, is music that descends in large part from Depeche Mode, whose Andy Fletcher was the first to sign Client-- and god knows <em>those </em>guys are big enough drama queens to inspire deep personal attachment, fervent teenage under-the-covers listening. The band Ladytron, Client's closest English peers, have been learning to pack their tracks with the same kind of emotion; Goldfrapp, probably the next closest, just ramp up their glitter and physicality to the point of decadence. The problem with Client is that they're offering...what? It's strangely hard to find an angle in there, the right aesthetic particulars to give the band a face and a feel. And if you've located it, feel free to write in and tell me where.</p><p>
    The funny part is that <em>Heartland </em>really is awfully well-made-- great hooks, structure, production, the works. The introduction of a new member on bass gives their sound a new smoothness, which they use to cruise beautifully up to any number of great hooks. There's one on ""Drive"" with the casual cool of Elastica. There's one in ""Monkey on My Back"", with beautifully scripted pulsing and call-and-response chants. There's a Goldfrapp-style glam shuffle on ""Lights Go Out"", the most fetching of several songs that all might as well be singles-- I'll bet anything you'll hear it in a commercial one day, get it stuck in your head, and wind up thinking it sounds great. It's probably telling, though, that the big fun surprise comes from one of the band's old tricks, bringing in guest musicians to inject some personality. Simon Tong adds guitar to a cover of Adam Ant's ""Zerox Machine"", and while it's not quite the record's most memorable tack, the band suddenly seems to muster up some of the verve and spark that's oddly absent elsewhere.</p><p>
    What's really strange is that Client seem to think of their faceless, uniformed image as some kind of commentary on ""manufactured"" mainstream pop. Weird, given that that's actually the context where these songs work best-- as tight, stylish singles, the sort you can love hearing on the radio or the dance floor for a few months, all without stressing over what the band as a whole is all about. It's when you bring this stuff home, at LP length, that you start wondering: excellent craftsmanship, but what's your <em>thing</em>? Other bands are doing this too, after all-- and even when they're not as consistent, a lot of them have something in their music that we stand more of a chance of really falling for.</p></div>"|10470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10470-heartland/|6.0|Nitsuh Abebe

It's accurate in more ways than the idea that <em>Resurrection </em>is the Midwest's <em>Illmatic</em>: Both MCs have spent the past 13 years struggling with artistic detours, shifting audiences, and diminishing returns,  Nas taking the cash-in route with the commercial-skewing (and subsequently underrated) <em>It Was Written</em> while Common's street-level bohemianism gradually and inadvertently narrowcasted him towards an audience of, as he infamously put it, ""coffee shop chicks and white dudes."" Both of them came back later in their careers with fires lit under their asses, though there's a difference between being called out by Jay-Z for being washed-up and being called out by your fans for turning into a flat-out freak (see: <em>Electric Circus</em>).</p><p>
    Seeing as how <em>Be </em>was a commercial, critical, and fanbase success that restored Common's rep, it's weird that its successor follows its winning formula to the letter yet somehow sounds comparatively lead-footed and tired. Although the Kanye West partnership that flourished in Common's 2005 return to form felt like something that could reap a lot of creative dividends over the course of subsequent albums, <em>Finding Forever</em> is a turn toward going through the motions, weighed down by an adult-contemporary atmosphere that mistakes fatigue for relaxation. There's screw albums with more liveliness than this.</p><p>
    Common may not have gotten more confident as he's matured-- he didn't really need to, already having developed an authoritative voice by age 22, and at 35 he's still as comfortable taking the pulpit as any MC his age-- but his street wisdom and his man-of-the-people rhetoric have developed a cynical tone that too often turns his tales of humanistic living and tragedy into joyless scolding. The righteousness worked well on <em>Be</em> since Common tended to leave the self- out of it, and there's a few moments on <em>Finding Forever</em> that succeed for the same reason; his intricately delivered insights into the vicious cycle of ghetto life in ""Black Maybe"" (""We leanin' on a wall that ain't, that ain't stable/ It's hard to turn on the hood that made you/ To leave, be afraid to, the same streets that raised you can aid you"") and his barbed fury on ""Start the Show"" (""With 12 monkeys on the stage it's hard to see who's a guerilla/ You was better as a drug dealer"") don't just hit hard, they hit precisely. But the narrative in ""Misunderstood"" about the loosely defined street hustler and the college girl turned drug-addict stripper seem more distant than the more firsthand-feeling observations in <em>Be</em>'s closing track ""It's Your World"", and the first verse of ""The Game"" has so many disconnected talking points (global warming, spoiled rich teenagers, black power, the greatness of Big Daddy Kane) over the course of 40 seconds that it feels like a suffocating avalanche of conscious-rap clichés.</p><p>
    And sometimes it gets borderline-Mencia ignorant: Describing white people's supposed unfamiliarity with day-to-day struggles on ""The People"" requires a lot more insight than claiming they prefer to ""focus on dogs and yoga"" (is that how Jeremy Piven lived on the set of <em>Smokin' Aces</em>?), and if the flirtation in ""Break My Heart"" was a real-life conversation, it'd probably wind up being mocked on Overheard in Chicago: ""It was a dream day/ Met her on Spring Break/ Look like the type that be like 'no habla Ingles'/ She said 'you look like you rap, where's your bling-ay/ And your clothes are tight but you don't seem gay'/ I said 'naw, that's dude from N-Sync-ay.'"" At least when he griped about black men dating white women, he tried reminding himself to go beyond the surface. And he didn't lace it with a series of warmed-over pop-culture wisecracks, either: Between the references to OK Go's treadmill video, the crazy astronaut lady, and gossip-rag celebrity couples (Kimora Lee and Russell Simmons, sure, but Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon?) on the Lily Allen-augmented ""Drivin' Me Wild,"" he's more VH-1 than KRS-One.</p><p>
    But while it's easy to pick and choose the goofiest shit Common says on a record, the lyrics aren't necessarily what makes <em>Finding Forever</em> so tedious. Kanye West, who once again produces the majority of the album, has tried making a tribute to Common's Jay Dee-fueled Soulquarian-era sound, and he doesn't fit it well at all, managing half of its vibe and none of its energy. ""Southside"" features a guitar riff that sounds like a rote impersonation of the bugged-out synth on <em>Donuts</em>' ""Da Factory""; ""Forever Begins"" relies too heavily on a washed-out supper-club piano and an obvious break from Paul Simon's ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover""; and even the fairly close approximations-- particularly the 70s Hancock/Wonder soul-jazz of ""The People"" and ""Break My Heart""-- lack Dilla's knack for immaculate drum programming and thick, rich bass. (The first time I heard ""The People"" was in a taxi with the windows slightly cracked, and once we hit the freeway all I could hear under the wind was a weak snare shot.) It doesn't help that the inclusion of a genuine Jay Dee beat on the album-- the lush ""So Far to Go,"" which already appeared on last year's Dilla elegy <em>The Shining</em> with different lyrics-- makes Kanye's shit sound even more ersatz.</p><p>
    It could just be a matter of an album needing the right audience: Its over-earnest soul-rap production and righteous indignation might strike a nerve with anyone who's under the impression that ""real rap"" needs to be saved from some evil influence (like, I don't know, Southern tracks with hooks or whatever). The problem is, Common already brought this ""real"" hip hop back two years ago, and by presenting a weaker, more frivolous and significantly duller version of it, he's risking falling into the same routine of formulaic coasting as the white-tee strawmen older heads gripe about. Call it <em>Be Minus</em>, and let me know when he's found his spark again.</p></div>"|10483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10483-finding-forever/|5.6|Nate Patrin

    Despite the hopeful title of Bishop Allen's 2003 debut <em>Charm School</em>, a formal education wasn't enough to ingratiate these Harvard grads to the wider public. Forced to choose the autodidactic route instead, the band appealed to the marketing potential of the online indie rock fan-o-sphere.  During 2006, the group released one EP per month, both to keep their name afloat in blogs and trend pieces, and also as a Web 2.0 version of the Beatles' Hamburg residency-- honing their chops through consistent production and performance.  A bit more than seven months after completing that project, the band offers <em>Bishop Allen and the Broken String</em>, featuring nine reworked EP tracks and three new songs, with more than a bit of studio polish to boot.</p><p>
    The songs chosen for <em>String</em> reveal Paul Simon as Bishop Allen's patron saint, at times to a degree that makes the record feel like an homage. The paean to photography ""Click Click Click Click"" (from the <em>July</em> EP) is a first-cousin to Simon's winsome ""Kodachrome"", and ""Corazon"" (<em>January</em>) is another ode to an anthropomorphized tool of creativity, in this case a discarded piano.   <em>String</em>'s colorful narratives of naïve sightseeing represent the band's debt to the singer/songwriter most clearly, however.  ""Like Castanets"" (<em>September</em>) takes the vantage point of a traveler making sense of his Chilean surroundings; one need not know what Assumption Day is (or, for that matter, ""Armistice Day"") to revel in the ambience that comes with it.  On ""The Chinatown Bus"", a bit of Greyhound flanerie directly drawn from Simon's ""America"", Justin Rice's lyrical cadence closely resembles ""The Boxer"".</p><p>
    For a record bound with such dog-eared nostalgia, ""The Monitor"" is an appropriate preamble.  Situating the monstrous Civil War sea battle the titular ship fought with the Merrimac in relation to his own vocation,  Rice marvels at the soldiers' occupational devotion: ""And none of them knew or none of them cared how much had just changed right then and right there. They just carried on.""  Relying on the repetition of day-to-day labor to outpace external obstacles is indeed a fitting (if not a bit glossed) conceit for a band that punched the clock for a solid year to gain some stability of its own.  Once they'd righted the ship, ""Monitor"", originally a drum and bass brood from the <em>March</em> <em>EP</em>, was rewarded with its own dynamic ironsides in the studio; the multiple layers of rolling, echoed piano on the <em>String</em> version result in a much stronger and dramatic work.  
    </p>
<p>
    Yet while a bit of sheen works fine for some of <em>String</em>, the band gets a bit carried away at points, reaching a point of diminishing returns on the lovely ""Corazon"", for instance, on which the addition of a slick, punchy bassline and handclaps detracts from the original's sense of unguarded wonder.  ""Flight 180"", which parallels the deterioration of a relationship through a slowly-rendered plane crash, replaces the <em>April EP</em> version's unadorned, nervous strings with sheets of cascading orchestration, a big-budget remake of that song's bleak simplicity.</p><p>
    The most obvious remnants of Bishop's power-pop past are the new songs ""Rain"" and ""Middle Managegment"", both of which have been floating around in demo and live form for a few years.  An amalgam of handclaps, limber guitar lines, toy piano and time-worn silver-lining lyricism (""Cause if it's ever gonna get any better, it's gotta get worse for a day""), ""Rain"" is an strutting reminder of Wilco's ""War on War"", and evidence of a possible strong suit for the band.   The inclusion of ""Management"" is less successful, however; the band is more suited to the piano pop of closer ""The News from Your Bed"" than what sounds like a banged-out pop-punk sitcom theme.
    </p>
<p>
    Like Voxtrot's full-length May debut, <em>The Broken String</em> is an attempt to introduce a band mostly known for a run of EPs to a wider audience, by showcasing the breadth of their abilities with the benefit of label support and production sparkle.  While the record is far from a failure, Bishop Allen's studio revisionism also falls short of offering anything substantially new to much of the EP material.   As with <em>Voxtrot, String</em> is packed with the sort of potential that might result in something substantial down the line, once the group wrangles its outsize ambition and fleshes out its innate charisma.  Bishop Allen's popularity thus far has resulted from an excess  of patience; give them a bit more time to show what they've really got.<br/>

    Just ask Dave Davies, Freddie Stone, or Catfish Collins: Whenever you get two brothers simultaneously making their way into the music business, there's often only enough room in the spotlight for one of them. Unlike that other musical-family member with the same name, Michael ""Oh No"" Jackson has spent much of his career trying to live up to the standards of his older brother, Otis Jackson Jr.-- better known as Madlib. And while Oh No's first two albums-- 2004's <em>The Disrupt</em> and 2006's <em>Exodus Into Unheard Rhythms</em>-- were solid enough to rule out nepotism as a reason for his Stones Throw roster slot, the perception that his commonplace rhymes couldn't match the creativity of his production tended to put him a couple steps behind Madlib's breakneck artistic pace.</p><p>
    Not that you can really get any substantial psychological motivations from <em>Dr. No's Oxperiment</em>, Oh No's newest and best record, but there's a vague sense of sibling rivalry beneath the surface: it plays as if he heard big brother Madlib's instrumental stream-of-consciousness bumper-music concoction <em>Beat Konducta</em> and immediately set about one-upping it. Like <em>Exodus Into Unheard Rhythms</em>, which was pieced together entirely from samples of music by <em>Hair</em> composer and film score funk maestro Galt MacDermot, <em>Dr. No's Oxperiment </em>draws from a limited thematic palette: psychedelic pop from Europe and the Middle East, particularly Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Lebanon. It's perilous turf, since both acid rock and Mediterranean music can sound gimmicky and exploitative when reassembled carelessly into some semblance of hip-hop. But Oh No avoids falling into embarrassing exotica clichés by reworking the beats to the point where their exact point of origin becomes unclear-- not just the region, but the genre, as shards of intricate prog, rural folk music, and raucous garage rock all melt into a sort of junkyard jazz-funk.</p><p>
    The tone of the record is set with opening track ""Heavy"": At 1:54, the longest cut on the whole album, it takes little time to establish the psychedelic breakbeat motif and even less time to prove it successful, a stinging fuzz guitar riff and a trilling Middle Eastern vocal accenting taut, clipped drums. From there it segues into ""Gladius"", which skirts Madlib territory with rubbery boom-clap percussion and a caterwauling Moog, ""Higher"", with a halting stop-start groove that stitches together abruptly-interrupted guitar and snare loops with thick, prominent seams, and ""Breakout"", which conjures up fistfight rhythms from fragments of spy-flick strings, corroded funk riffs, and panic-attack percussion with bass so blown-out it could turn tweeters into woofers.
    </p>
<p>
    You could get the general sense of how the whole album might play out just from those first four tracks, which total about six-and-a-quarter minutes in all. But <em>Dr. No's Oxperiment</em> practically demands you listen to it front-to-back; shuffling it amidst a list of thousands might make its tracks' occasional appearances seem a little fleeting and more than a little abrupt, but played beginning-to-end it ebbs and flows and develops naturally over the course of just under 40 minutes. Mid-album tracks like ""Exp Out the Ox"" (a 61-second burst of twangy elastic bass, snakecharmer guitar, and a bumblebee synthesizer that sounds like it's being played by a thimble-sized Bernie Worrell) and ""Emergency"" (a harpsichord slap-boxes a drum machine to a pop-and-lock cadence) feel like the first of multiple culminations, and the three late cuts-- ""Cassette"", ""Down Under"", and ""Smokey Winds""-- save some of the album's most forceful beats for the home stretch. The only real flaw about the record's flow is that it doesn't exactly know how to end: the muggy ""Slow Down"" fuses a clanking aluminum woodblock beat to the subdued wail of an indeterminate horn, but it simply snaps off after a brief, inconclusive-sounding loop of Arabesque strings.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Dr. No's Oxperiment </em>is one of the most fulfilling beat-driven instrumental hip-hop records since J Dilla's <em>Donuts</em>, and the fact that he pulled it off solely by turning to a rarely-tapped vein of psych that few hip-hop producers have even approached is proof enough that talent runs rampant in the family. Hopefully Oh No isn't sick of hearing comparisons to his brother-- after putting together a record filled with occasionally surreal and frequently hard-hitting beats that rank up there with some of the best moments on <em>Madvillainy</em> and <em>The Unseen</em>, he'll probably be getting a lot more of them.<br/>

    Listening to someone rap or sing in a language you don't understand affords an opportunity to experience the human voice as pure sound. This is different from hearing someone sing wordlessly, intending to use the voice as just another instrument, because the rhythm of syntax and syllables is very much in play, yet free of the baggage of meaning. Portuguese is a language that sounds like it was invented by singers, and Brazilian dialects seem to highlight its natural musicality.</p><p>
    Brazil's music industry is very nearly as large as that of the U.S., and extremely diverse-- the country has produced many unique styles of its own, from batucada and samba to bossa nova, MPB and Tropicália-- and it's usually pretty easy to pick a Brazilian record out of the crowd regardless of its genre. There's just a certain Brazilian edge, a distinctive melodic warmth that's unmistakable.</p><p>
    Today, Brazilian society is marked by a disparity in living standards easily as bad as at any point in history. The mansions of the country's great cities are balanced by teeming, violent slums where opportunity can seem like a very distant dream. Rio de Janeiro isn't the largest Brazilian city, but it's the most mythical, with its dramatic harbor, imposing mountains, massive statue of Christ, and white, curving beaches, but its modern realities are like those of any other city, with crime and poverty a part of the landscape. The favelas of Brazil have produced huge quantities of music, and the recent baile funk craze is just a part of the story. Verge Records' <em>Inspiring New Sounds of Rio de Janeiro</em> compilation, while burdened with a pretty lousy title, nevertheless does a fine job of collecting a handful of interesting artists and showcasing some excellent tracks.
    </p>
<p>
    The disc's 13 songs are split between five different artists, and they range all over the map from twitching hip-hop to sunny funk-rock, crazed dub, and driving neo-samba. Verge records founder Emmanuel Zunz founded the label after hearing the funky rock group Movimento Na Rua while working in a Rio favela for a Canadian NGO called Schools Without Borders, and a portion of sales benefit the organization. The ultimate goal is to build a state-of-the-art recording studio in Rio with the specific mission of developing new artists.
    </p>
<p>
    The band that opens and closes the disc, A Filial, is tough to describe-- they have a chilled-out vibe to their sound, with casual guitar riffs, funky rhythms and an overall feel that recalls classic Brazilian popular music updated for the hip-hop era. Lead MC Edu Lopes seems to have picked up some of his technique from De La Soul. On ""Cartilha"", he trades verses with a jazzy, muted trumpet, while ""Camila"" is more fractured, with motor-mouthed verses traded back and forth by multiple MCs-- at one point, it sounds like they're trading verses over the phone.
    </p>
<p>
    Gabriel Moura, who once played in a band called Farofa Carioca with Seu Jorge, turns in two wildly divergent tracks that recall Brazil's musical past. ""Brasis"", with its big brass arrangement, frenetic rhythm and frantic vocal, reminds me of Wilson Simonal's late-60s pilantragem phase and, more distantly, the carnavál music of Agostinho dos Santos. ""O Perfume da Nega"" is more closely related to Bebeto's late-70s MPB records. That couldn't be more different from the two Digitaldubs tracks, one of which features deep, gravelly vocals from baile funk rapper Mister Catra, while the other is straight-up roots reggae with dub production and pounding, modern reggae rhythm tracks full of programmed drums and electronic bass lines.
    </p>
<p>
    Bnegao e os Seletores de Frequencia offer an electro-acoustic pop/hip-hop hybrid that makes it clear how far ahead of his time Tom Zé has been throughout his career-- he's anticipated this sound for decades. This sound's time has clearly arrived, and it deserves a prominent place on our hip-hop planet. The mix of harmony singing, rapping, live, acoustic instrumentation, and programming has few genuine parallels anywhere. That brings us back to the band most responsible for this compilation's existence: Movimento Na Rua. Their ""Soldados Nunca Mais"" flips back and forth between funk and rock, balancing intricate vocal arrangements on the funky verses with flat-out riffing on the chorus. They embrace reggae and hip-hop on ""Periferia de Jah"", and outer space groove on ""Realidade,"" and it's not hard to see what Zunz saw in them that inspired him.
    </p>
<p>
    At its core, this is all music born of struggle, even if its sunny disposition doesn't always let on. And that's where the language question comes in. I have no doubt that being able to understand the vocalists on this compilation would deepen my appreciation for what they're doing and open my eyes to certain realities I'm not aware of. But at the same time, I don't need that extra layer of meaning to listen to this and know that it's vital, exciting music produced by people who have kept their art and culture vibrant against heavy odds.

Things are a little different these days, especially with the initial bliss and ensuing oversaturation of the Postal Service now over, but Namelessnumberheadman are far from stuck in that same rut. As before, they hold onto some of the hallmarks of their Midwestern peers: In not just the lilting drawl of vocalists Chuck Whittington and Andrew Sallee, but also the titanic drums that almost overbear their gentler tendencies, Namelessnumberheadman recall Flaming Lips, but there's also a similar strain between this three-man group and the Minus Story, Doris Henson, and even Sparklehorse, with impassioned, effeminate melodies struggling against waves of washed-out keyboards and clamoring percussion.</p><p>
    The crashing Steve Drozd-like drums are still present and accounted for, but the melodies more pronounced, the acoustic guitars take more focus, and the gentle drum pads quietly putter behind them. There's nothing like the cascading sonics of the chorus of ""Going to Breathe Again"" or ""(At Least) Three Cheers for Cause and Effect"" (both from <em>Your Voice Repeating</em>) here, but there's also a lot less genre sidestepping and more honest-to-god synthesis of folk and electronic elements. It's apparent from the very beginning of opener ""Animal Kingdom"", where the drums quickly recede to a speedy strum and a paean to more earthly preoccupations from Sallee, concerning ""cicada's wings,"" ""wet worms,"" and ""leaf's veins"", all leading to a slower, more organic pulse. Likewise, ""The Beginning"" puts all its faith in a hook that has little to do with electronics, but climbing guitars and Sallee's croon, and breaks for an almost campfire-appropriate respite of only guitar-and-voice. More mechanical percussion pokes its head out behind the plucking of ""Branches of Branches of Branches"" or fluttering extraneous samples on ""An Argument to Stand On"", but its always just another texture making up a seamless whole. Some of the record's most arresting moments aren't wrested from a keyboard, but a pedal steel guitar, as on the Whittington-led late-album highlight ""Lesser Fates"".</p><p>
    Both vocalists get more adventurous and try out a larger range, while guitars climb, they simper, they proclaim, they insinuate, but they don't always assert themselves. Those big, crashing drums often undermine the peaks and valleys of the songs like a house of cards, and otherwise sharp melodies like ""Opposable Thumbs"" aren't as dynamic as they could be because of it. Still, that's a minor complaint compared to the evolution of the band, who sat out the lap-pop hangover to develop more of their own identity as swooning folk artists for the next century.</p></div>"|10461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10461-wires-reply/|7.1|Jason Crock

<em>""The most powerful weapon to conquer the devil is humility. For, as he does not know at all how to employ it, neither does he know how to defend himself from it.""</em></p><p>
    -Saint Vincent de Paul (b. 1581 - d. 1660)</p><p>
    Maybe that explains it. Maybe that quote from the real Saint Vincent, namesake of multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark's nom du rock, explains why, rather than step right into the spotlight, Clark instead chose to spend so much of her time as an oft-befrocked member of both Sufjan Stevens and the Polyphonic Spree's flock.
    </p>
<p>
    One might have assumed that, hey, maybe she was just more comfortable as a group utility player, but like most assumptions it's simply not borne out by the imposing reality of her various talents. As her St. Vincent debut immediately asserts, Clark's more than ready to be out front. In fact, it's amazing she didn't step into the spotlight sooner, considering the countless ideas swirling about <em>Marry Me</em>, an art-rock album at times redolent of prime Kate Bush and <em>Lodger</em>-era David Bowie.
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe ""humility"" isn't the first word that springs to mind when you read the liners crediting Clark with ""voices, guitars, bass, piano, organ, Moog, synthesizers, clavieta, xylophone, vibraphone, dulcimer, drum programming, triangle, percussion."" Triangle? Is that really something to boast about? Then again, with its brilliant production flourishes and impeccably left-field arrangements, false modesty does not behoove the disc.
    </p>
<p>
    In the case of music like this, the devil to conquer is preciousness and indulgence. No doubt, in lesser hands Clark's quirks and eccentricities would mark the St. Vincent project a no-go from the start. But at every turn <em>Marry Me</em> takes the more challenging route of twisting already twisted structures and unusual instrumentation to make them sound perfectly natural and, most importantly, easy to listen to as she overdubs her thrillingly sui generis vision into vibrant life.
    </p>
<p>
    Clark's hardly alone in the endeavor. Not to be out-Spreed, <em>Marry Me</em> features, among other helpers, a chorus (used mostly as melodic and rhythmic counterpoint), Bowie pianist Mike Garson, and Polyphonic Spree/Man Or Astro-Man? drummer Brian Teasley, a wiz at picking the right beats for all the perfectly wrong places. But from the frenetic first half of the disc, where the ideas are coming fast and furious and Clark lets her inner prog run wild, to the mellow second, <em>Marry Me </em>is clearly the product of one person's fertile-- and clearly very well organized-- subconscious.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Now, Now"" dances around a tricky little guitar pattern and Clark's sweet vocal melodies-- her big-girl voice a welcome respite from indie rock's lame habit of faux naivety-- as bass and drums push and pull the song taut then loose again. The grace of the track suddenly gives way to explosive guitar, the previous precision dissolved into distorted passion. ""Jesus Saves, I Spend"" bounds along in 6/8, with the chorus and sped-up vocals countering Clark's own coo. ""Your Lips Are Red"" mutates from throb to tribal freakout, a croaking, scraping guitar and sinewy lead hinting at the chaos that never quite comes. ""Apocalypse Song"" features a polyrhythmic voice, drum and handclap breakdown that vies with strings and more skronking noise.
    </p>
<p>
    The war-is-not-over ""Paris is Burning"" is a woozy Weimar-esque waltz filled out by phased effects, a martial groove and sneaking, cynical lines like the Shakespeare allusion ""Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear."" Elsewhere Clark slips in a few other memorable lyrics as well. In ""Your Lips Are Red"" she complains, ""Your skin so fair it's not fair."" In the title track, Clark gets off the lasciviously blasphemous come-on ""we'll do what Mary and Joseph did...without the kid.""
    </p>
<p>
    The slower vibe of the last few tracks isn't as immediate as what came before it, but that doesn't make it any less impressive. ""Landmines"" is like ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" redone as a torch song. ""All the Stars Aligned"" plods along like a pleasant Beatles outtake, at least until Clark's mini-orchestra briefly (and curiously) quotes John Barry's ""James Bond Theme"". ""Human Racing"" begins as a gentle bossa nova before blossoming into a hypnotic pulse for its fade-out. The jazzy final song, ""What Me Worry?"" is as traditional as the disc gets, except for the fact that Clark picked it to end an album that spends most of its previous minutes exploring the unconventional.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Love is just a bloodmatch to see who endures lash after lash with panache,"" Clark sings, without coming across nearly as precociously as she could have. ""Have I fooled you, dear? The time is coming near when I'll give you my hand and I'll say, 'It's been grand, but...I'm out of here.'"" And then she's gone.
    </p>
<p>
    Oh, and the final sound you hear before you inevitably press play and listen to the whole beguiling thing again? A triangle. Guess those lessons paid off after all.

Now the 26-year-olds have much more in common with 1980s power-pop, rounded with bubbly keyboard squeals, and they do this sound better than either Avril Lavigne or, say, Liz Phair. Some weird choices, however-- vocally, instrumentally, and otherwise-- mar their latest album, <em>The Con</em>. Yet the record's most interesting bits-- a keen sense of melody-- disappear too quickly and can't carry the album over its production bumps. The edgiest thing about the sisters Quin continues to be their haircuts.</p><p>
    The duo's 2004 album <em>So Jealous</em> had great moments, too. ""Walking with a Ghost"", a song later covered by the White Stripes, was perhaps its finest, if only because it showed how Tegan and Sara can add depth to heartache through keen observation. Such examples are everywhere on <em>The Con</em>: ""When I jerk away from holding hands with you/ I know these habits hurt important parts of you,"" they sing on ""Back in Your Head"", a song that boasts the album's best keyboard lines. Lyrically, there are as many turds as gems though, and they usually appear within five words of the word ""heart."" ""I want to draw you a floorplan of my head and heart/ I want to give directions, helpful hints, what you’ll be looking for,"" Sara pleads on ""Floorplan"". Maybe they should have called it ""No Exit"". It sounds like a rush of emotion, but flows awkwardly. There's an earnestness they'd do well to drop-- if they know love's a sham, and know the sham's a sham, then sing about that already-- but they don't. I can only imagine that co-producer Chris Walla (Death Cab for Cutie) contributed to the problem.</p><p>
    Tegan's songs are conventional, so they rely on embellishment-- like the Phil Collins-esque drums on ""Are You Ten Years Ago""-- to make them more interesting. Her lyrical indugences can also be difficult to swallow. ""Hop a Plane"" does better for Tegan, because the line she repeats here is catchy enough to stay pleasurable over each iteration. Sara, who has the more strident voice of the two, writes their more complex songs. ""Knife Going In""'s instruments drift out of tune, which gives it a seasick, disconnected quality. ""Relief Next to Me"" thumps like wet newspaper though, her weak similes never building up to a satisfying payoff: a big chorus, a cute melody. ""Relief"" gets one thing right though: When Sara sings about things ""in the dark"", you get the feeling that, for much of their young, female audience anyway, they can serve as a beacon.<br/></p></div>"|10476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10476-the-con/|6.6|Jessica Suarez

    Does John McKeown qualify as a cult icon? Better yet, is the title of his new trio 1990s an ode to his brief time in the UK indie spotlight? More specifically, is ""Cult Status"", from <em>Cookies</em>, his first effort with his new trio, as autobiographical as it is sarcastic? Those familiar with the past 15 or so years of Glaswegian indie pop no doubt remember McKeown as the frontman for the provincially popular and gleefully acerbic Yummy Fur, a group whose ranks once boasted two current members of Franz Ferdinand. After tiring of all things guitar, though, McKeown disbanded the Fur as the 90s wound down, tried some electronic side-projects for a bit, and as of 2005 was keeping a low profile by Glasgow party-hopping. All the while his cult status-- the sort created by the fervent fans who loved the band's early 7"" singles and wonderful capstone <em>Sexy World</em>-- keeping him, or at least his minor legend, alive. Enough so that at an early gig, despite McKeown only wanting 1990s to serve as a fun diversion, the band was spotted, recruited, and signed by Rough Trade's Geoff Travis.</p><p>
    Fur-followers know McKeown's musical lineage:  borderline genius/recluse Alex Chilton, sunny 60s American pop, and the cockiest stuff CBGB's had to offer.  Suitably, then, 1990s bring hooks, sneers and, well, intoxicants to spare, with the punched-up sheen of a production budget to boot (helmed by ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler). Combine with the druggy glee of Supergrass' <em>I Should Coco</em> and the Streets' <em>Original Pirate Material</em>, bake thoroughly, and you have <em>Cookies</em>.
    The record is also the sound of a reveler reinvigorated, shoved into a decidedly larger public eye and loving every minute of it, in his own way. How else to explain the refrain from ""Enjoying Myself"": ""I'm just enjoying myself/ And maybe, you can enjoy me too""?  The irresistible T. Rex bubblegum of the Norman Blake-produced first single ""You Made Me Like It"", a genuinely grateful ode to music recommendations, is more evidence.  <em>Cookies</em>' glittering apex, however, is the slyly passionate ""Meet Me At the Lights"", which stamps toward its wordless chorus with abandon (""Get out/ To a bar""), and still stops briefly, protracting the last word of the elaboration ""Get out like a blonde gets out of a car.""</p><p>
    Well, as might be expected with a record made by a relentless partier and non-stop sin-indulger, much of <em>Cookies</em> also contains a sort of confused bitterness. To the band's (and no doubt Butler's) credit, though, even the acrimonious anthem ""You're Supposed to Be My Friend"" inspires more foot stomping than frowning. The guitars are the key, quickly changing from an irritated scratch to, on the chorus, the rousing axe-uniformity of the Undertones' ""Teenage Kicks"". ""Switch"" also solicits an attitude change to cease a buzz-kill (""Is there a switch for that?/ Switch it back""), buffering it with the swagger of pompadoured Bowery dweller Mink DeVille. 
    </p>
<p>
    And then the dope kicks in, leading to McKeown's probably unavoidable advice: ""Why don't you start taking drugs again/ You were never funnier/ Than you were back then."" It's the sort of occurrence that leads to an uncomfortable late-night pub silence, broken when he falls off his stool and is dragged to the car by his mates. The same effect happens when the brooding ""Weed"" begins <em>Cookies</em>' last quarter.
    With the non-sequitor flair of someone who's had too much, the always well-intentioned McKeown then segues into a bit of paranoid self-loathing: ""I'm even scared of the telephone/ And I don't even got one."" That's McKeown's central charm, and that of <em>Cookies</em> on the whole: even at his lowest moments, he's willing to crack a joke at his own expense. ""Weed"" is followed by the punchier ""Thinking of Not Going"", essentially two fondly remembered vignettes of getting high, and then ""Situation"", the closest the band comes to actually making drug music. 1990s' early existence involved playing as the backing band for a solo Damo Suzuki (!), and the five-minute closer is rife with gurgling bass and, in the middle, an extended krautrock-style jam. A strange change of pace? Sure. An appropriately outré finale for a record devoted to having fun at all costs? Definitely.

    For a band that emerged with such a deeply ingrained reverence for
    pre-rock 'n' roll tradition and authenticity, the Boggs managed to
    instantly date themselves on the cover of their 2002 debut album, <em>We Are The Boggs We Are</em>,
    by having a member hold up a prop magazine with the Strokes on the
    front. Of course, the real joke was that the music on the album sounded
    less the product of New York 2002 than Mississippi 1932. But now, five
    years and three albums later, that cheeky gesture seems doubly ironic: With <em>Forts</em>, the Boggs sound
    like a band that's finally made peace with the modern world-- and
    they've even got the Liars connections and Hot Chip remix to prove it.</p><p>
    The ultimate irony is that Boggs mainman Jason Friedman-- the group's lone constant-- had to move to Berlin to sound more like a Brooklynite. But where his fellow Brooklyn-to-Berlin émigrés
    Liars have taken a turn toward the insular since their 2005 relocation,
    Friedman's songwriting-- once tethered to a marble-mouthed drawl and
    droning resonator-guitar slides-- has become more approachable, and
    more open to influences beyond Harry Smith box sets. You could hear the
    tentative first steps toward transformation on 2003's uneven (and, due
    to label woes, hard-to-find) <em>Stitches</em>,
    but it seemingly took a move overseas to completely shake Friedman of
    his aesthetic purism. Recorded with assistance from Liars' Julian Gross
    and SchneiderTM's Christian Obermaier,  <em>Forts</em> scrapes away the Boggs' surface grime and puts the emphasis-- as all good rock 'n' roll should-- on rhythm.</p><p>
    But these are not the double-time dust-ups that defined the early Boggs: <em>Forts</em>
    is a combustible concoction of hand-claps, knee-slaps, Bo
    Diddley beats, shuffling feet, clinking cowbells, and chain-gang chants
    that suggests a band perpetually on the verge of breaking down but
    having too good a time to notice the smoke seeping out from under the
    hood. On the opening title track, a tapped-out hand-jive pulse is
    echoed by a click-and-cut techno-dub backtrack-- effectively condensing
    60 years of dance-music history into 20 seconds-- while the song's
    crystalline acoustic guitar riff almost sounds computer-triggered. But
    where the Boggs' current live incarnation features two drummers to give
    a song like ""Forts"" the extra wallop it seems to demand, on record,
    Friedman prefers to twitch in the tension, shouting above the din and
    nudging the song along like he's trying to get off a crowded subway.
    </p>
<p>
    The Boggs' earlier efforts sometimes blurred the line between aesthetic purity and monotony, but <em>Forts</em>
    shifts gears frequently and effectively enough to avoid any such accusations.
    Freed from the affected drawl he once relied upon, Friedman's voice is
    something of a blank slate-- and not always in the
    cool-Lou-Reed-monotone kinda way-- so he was wise to enlist vocalist
    foil Karen Sharky, who ably plays the Exene to his John Doe, and who
    lends ample color to a band that once existed in grainy black and
    white. It's nigh impossible to imagine the Boggs of 2002 attempting a
    B-52s-styled call-and-response like ""Remember the Orphans"", a cheeky
    Buddy Holly cop like ""Little Windows"", or the Gary Glittered swing of
    ""Arm in Arm"" (recent recipient of the aforementioned Hot Chip
    makeover), but <em>Forts</em> is less a
    slide-show of genre tourism than a natural reflection of roots music's
    historic evolution through jump blues (""Bookends""), rockabilly (""So I
    So You"") and punk (""If We Want (We Can)"", a clattering noise-blues
    outburst that shows Liars aren't just friends, but inspirations).
    </p>
<p>
    Beyond the rhythmic ticks, what keeps the Boggs from degenerating into
    standard-issue blues-rock is Friedman's unconventional approach to
    rock's defining instrument: He beats on his acoustic guitar like it's
    electric, while plucking his electric guitar strings as if they were
    acoustic. <em>Forts</em> succeeds so
    long as the Boggs stay busy; Friedman isn't commanding enough a singer
    to carry more relaxed, unadorned folky fare like ""After the Day"" on his
    own, and the ominous, dirgey ballad ""The Passage"" threatens to cross
    the line from mid-album breather to buzz-kill. Like Dylan before him--
    another folk adherent who eventually stopped worrying and learned to
    love the rock-- Friedman sounds most comfortable playing the role of
    song-and-dance man.

No talk of techno past or present can forego his standing within it all, but Hawtin's gravity doesn't exactly square with the genre's fetish for the new and the unknown. How can a sound that prizes progressivism so proudly account for the enduring presence of a guy who started making his name in 1987?</p><p>
    Anyone eager to write off Hawtin as a holdout of history, however, runs into a problem with Minus. Started as an outgrowth of his storied label Plus 8, Hawtin's surging Minus imprint has situated itself among the elite enterprises that regard techno as more than a mere style. No label maintains a more faithful devotion to ""minimalism"" as an idea, and certainly no label works as much to marry ideology to the functionalism that techno holds dear. Watch the Hawtin documentary DVD <em>Pioneers of Electronic Music Vol. 1</em>, and you'll be hard-pressed to hear a more convincing argument for minimal-techno's place within the whole of 20th-century art; ask anyone about the illicit party culture of contemporary Berlin, and you won't go long without hearing about Minus as a bellwether.</p><p>
<em>Nothing Much</em> compiles 11 tracks from the tight Minus roster, with diverging interests met in kind. Studiousness and salaciousness abound from the start: In ""48 Hour Crack in Your Bass"" by Magda, a constrained mood gives over to a mess of druggy back-and-forth noise when the tick of a beat fattens in time with an ominous throb. The same goes for ""Fed on Youth"" by False (another alias, along with Audion, for Matthew Dear), which moves from desiccated syncopation to a weighted mass of sirens and bangs. Both are characteristic examples of furrow-browed severity evolving into a sound that makes eyes go wide-- a phenomenon that marks Minus in its prime.</p><p>
    The knock against Minus is that it hews toward the portentous and the dry, with the mandate for minimalism precluding the kind of release that long, slow builds promise. That applies to Gaiser's ""Egress"", which fidgets nicely but fails to live up to the Detroit native's sublime Minus 12"" from last year. But then there's a counterpoint like JPLS' ""Green01 (Skoozbot's Twilite Remix)"", which plays like a study but summons a rise of energy in its steady gait. Heartthrob's ""Baby Kate"" goes the other way, trading energy for mystery summoned by the melodic rise and fall of a synth riff that sounds like it's tired or dying.</p><p>
    The knock against <em>Nothing Much</em> is the degree to which it overlaps with the recent Minus compilations <em>Minimize to Maximize</em> and <em>Min2Max</em>. It's valuable to hear some of the label's well-worn tracks in context on a bonus disc mixed into a continuous set by Troy Pierce, but both of the previous collections feature tracks that are the same or an awful lot like the ones held out for attention here. Familiarity can be an asset, though-- especially when a label that prioritizes small surprises lines them all up in a row and lets angles against them go at cross purposes.</p></div>"|10462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10462-nothing-much-and-something-more/|7.0|Andy Battaglia

    Dälek don't do concessions: For the past nine years, the
    New Jersey duo has done its will alone, label-hopping from tiny local Gern
    Blandsten to the free-range Ipecac to the predominantly metal Hydra Head with
    intervening stops at a half-dozen international experimental outlets for
    collaborations, splits, and remixes. They count Faust, the Last Poets, and
    Godflesh's Justin Broadrick as partners and pit virulent, unflinching free
    verse against a production sense mostly indebted to 20th century art music
    (Robert Ashley, Merzbow, Tony Conrad) and very loud rock (My Bloody Valentine,
    the Mute usuals).<span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Indeed, the ultimate question for Dälek remains one of
    audience: Even though we often hear from Will ""MC Dälek"" Brooks that this is
    hip-hop, who is this the hip-hop of, or for? And on what level(s) should it be
    approached? Sure, Dälek's standard boom-bap beats are potent head-nodders, and
    Brooks' lyrics offer social barbs, race repudiations, and a tetanic middle
    finger to the culture industry. But the stuff drifting above and between the
    beats is something else entirely, less inner-city streets and more record-store
    abstraction. Some love the production and hate the rhymes (see Tom Breihan's review of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Abandoned Language</span><span>: ""stodgy
    old-man battle-rap...not really a rap group...industrial-shoegaze IDM""), while
    others find the clamor a redundant distraction to Brooks' unguarded lyrical
    fire. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Language</span><span>'s 10-minute
    titular track, for instance, begins with Brooks leaning on lines like, ""It's
    easier to start wars than it is to feed kids."" By the six-minute mark, those
    words wash under violin drones and heavy electronic noise, the beat persevering
    just beneath. You'll know what ""we"" are meant to get from this, but who is we,
    exactly?</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    On that level, Dälek's first collection of rarities and
    remixes, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Deadverse Massive</span><span>, is
    fascinating. Functionally, it does what it should do, reaching across six years
    of Dälek's catalogue to place two unreleased cuts alongside material from five
    out-of-print splits and a remix from Enon's </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">In This City EP</span><span>. And it points to the vaulted echelon from which
    Dälek's long been working: Between opening cut ""Megaton"" (a 2001 collaboration
    with Broadrick's Techno Animal) and the final-third ""Maintain"" (from the 2006 </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Streets
    All Amped</span><span> EP,</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span><span>included in entirety here), Dälek is consistently
    titan and bold. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Deadverse </span><span>doesn't
    get chronologically better or worse, more brave or more meek. It just keeps
    working: Dälek turn a 2002 Kid606 beat into a menace, the music stretched and
    screeching beneath Brooks' flow. They drench the metropolitan anxiety and
    naiveté of Enon's ""In This City"" with ounces of Lithium, letting the ugly city
    sound like it will swallow Toko Yasuda. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Deadverse</span><span> is a
    rarified collection, partially answering its subject's prevailing question-- the
    one of audience-- while posing it anew with 13 pieces that master the Dälek gamut
    from different angles. Here, the production wing peels away from the
    rhyming/songmaking controls: The 17-minute instrumental ""Music for ASM"" is a
    collage-heavy marathon of 1,000 glitches bouncing off corroded long tones. With
    this separation, it becomes clear that Dälek are testing every limit, exploring every
    boundary, not taking any answers easily. When the duo's two sides come back together,
    as on the remarkable ""3:46"", force and impact peak in exponents. ""Here's your
    fucking three minute pop song,"" Brooks screams at track's end, his voice irate
    against Oktopus' swarm of harsh noise. Above the track's upheaval, the point of
    Dälek-- pieces united-- seems clear: At their best, they lock form to function and
    claw at a cause-- in this case, cheap fucking beats and rhymes. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    It's not impossible to love one side of Dälek while
    abhorring the other. In fact, it's too easy. That fault has less to do with two
    musicians from New Jersey making the music they want to hear than it does with
    audiences on both sides of the spectrum too queasy to admit that hip-hop and
    experimental music should question their own borders and see what they can
    share. Who says a rap group from New Jersey rhyming about American poor buying
    empty stock in expensive religion can't hand those verses to an electronic pop
    group from Switzerland called Velma for remixing? And that the same rap group
    can't take one of that group's pop songs and make it sound as sinister and
    suggestively unsettling as a man hiding his face beneath the halogen glow of a
    street lamp in New Jersey at night? Take the inverse of that answer, and Dälek
    should have the crowd they've long deserved.

    When exactly does a genre graduate from the fickle roller coaster of hibernations and revivals to the permanent pantheon of musical style choices? While some sounds come and go, accumulating new names from the critical taxonomy each time, others become gracefully perennial and stable. Only the most myopic among us can claim that genres like metal or psych or garage-rock actually ever go away, rather than momentarily exit the indie stage for a costume change every couple years. But other sounds are given a Welcome Back party, complete with banner and <em>NME</em> feature, whenever their frequency takes a small uptick.</p><p>
    Post-punk is one of these latter characters, celebrated as returning so often it never leaves. Given that it has been being revived for pretty much all of the 00s, it's time to start thinking of it less as a houseguest than as a roommate. One sign of this permanence is when bands start making just plain really good competent examples of the genre that don't herald any kind of resurgence we need to get suitably jacked up for. <em>Fantastic Playroom</em> is one of these albums; though saddled with the latest tagline for 1981 nostalgia, new-rave, New Young Pony Club turn out a record that is meticulous and comfortable in its genre-specific craft, and excellent for it.</p><p>
    While the full length's thunder is somewhat dampened by the almost three-year blog/single/EP ramp-up, it's still an impressive collection of single-worthy tracks. We've all heard and become lactose-intolerant to ""Ice Cream"" by now, thanks to Intel, but it's not the only bullet in NYPC's gun: The barb-wire guitar of ""Get Lucky"" and the slot-machine punk-funk of ""The Bomb"" measure up well to the jingle's stature. ""The Get Go"" doesn't sound quite as forceful without Trillville mixed over it (cf. A-Trak's <em>Dirty South Dance</em>) but instead floats and skitters simultaneously. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are enough post-punk touchpoints here to keep the Musical Shoplifting Police busy for hours, right before stamping them as frauds exploiting their audience's history blind spots. But even those who lived it the first time (or, you know, read books about the first time) should be able to hand NYPC credit for getting the sound right. ""Hiding on the Staircase"", irritatingly snide vocals aside, is a further reassurance that the kids keep studying their <em>Remain in Light</em> for an escape hatch out of the old slashing-guitars and hi-hat dead-end, while ""Grey"" feints a hi-NRG ringtone beginning before retreating to the first pages of the Cure discography. Thrill as ""Get Lucky"" morphs from tired old Gang of Four to less-tapped Depeche Mode. Even early Madonna gets a reference whirl on closer ""Tight Fit"", which mimes her post-disco sound.
    </p>
<p>
    Credit Tahita Bulmer for adding enough personality to keep <em>Fantastic Playroom </em>from being just a meticulous period piece. Though the hard-to-get, disinterested come-ons of ""Ice Cream"" would become unbearably cloying stretched over an entire record, Bulmer shows off a deeper playbook, hopping easily back and forth between dreamy-pop singing and shouted tough-talk on ""The Bomb"" or drifting gently over the last-call of ""The Get Go"". Only toward the end of the album, when Bulmer slips into the fashionably-bored delivery of electroclash on ""Fan"" and ""Talking, Talking"", does she slip up, before making a nice, versatile recovery on the slinky ""Tight Fit"".
    </p>
<p>
    The danger with <em>Fantastic Playroom</em> is that there's nothing new, or even re-polished here; even the most casual indie fans have become used to the strip-mining of the early 80s and know all the maneuvers. Consider NYPC a revival act, and the reaction is that they're late to the party, settling on the same reference territory as others before them. But if post-punk has finally earned tenure on the genre faculty, digging up some yet-to-be-unearthed obscurity to mime or adding new technology to a 25-year-old sound is less a priority. <em>Fantastic Playroom</em> puts the emphasis on the content, not the trend, and in so doing makes a damn good case for post-punk's matriculation.

    Oslo's Smalltown Supersound recently released a lovely and (so far) overlooked label sampler/mix CD called <em>Sunkissed</em>. In addition to tracks from Pitchfork favorites like Lindstrøm and Serena-Maneesh, the set features two tracks from Bergen, Norway's Bjørn Torske, both of which can be found here on his first full-length album since 2003's<em> Trobbel</em>. Of all the possible names for a compilation on which to find Torske, it'd be hard to think of one better than <em>Sunkissed</em>;
    though he has range as a producer and works in a fair number of
    different moods, everything here is crisp, bright, airy, and shot
    through with light.</p><p>
    Torske is obviously in love with dub, and has a fondness for understatement. His music is often danceable and clubby, but there's never a sense of menace and it never seems like a soundtrack to hedonism. Instead, throughout <em>Feil Knapp</em>, Torske
    seem concerned with spaciness and warmth, and, above all, on creating a
    subtle but palpable sense of uplift. There's also a consistently
    engaging and playful sense of musical humor at work. ""Spelunker"" begins
    with some squeals and blips from a vaguely familiar video game--
    8-bits, maybe not even-- and then uses the sound effects to build a
    melody for deep, bottom-heavy, but still nimble dub. It's goofy but
    also terrific fun, as he essentially uses the game noises as
    high-pitched focus place of, say, Augustus Pablo's melodica. ""Kapteinens Skjegg""
    is another dub excursion, but more driven and heavier, its insistent
    1-3 upstrokes providing the foundation for all manner of echo and
    flange-laden percussion fills. Torske's palette retains roots reggae's earthiness while remaining happily unconcerned with any sense of authenticity.</p><p>
    When Torske ups the speed, he keeps the dubby bass out front but adds jazzy chords and all manner of organic percussion untethered to the 4/4 grid. The snappy ""Tur I Maskinparken"" almost has a post-rock cast-- like a <em>TNT</em>-era Tortoise remix, say--<em> </em>the way it blends elements  like a quickly tapping drum machine with electric piano vamping. ""Loe Bar"" is much more danceable, as easy on the ears as mellow retail-ready house but far more engaging, incorporating drama with some yearning new wave synth chords and combining a hypnotic bounce with a striking tunefulness. The eight-minute ""God Kveld"", which was also on <em>Sunkissed </em>in abbreviated form, has a Miami-to-Brooklyn electro feel, with a synth
    melody ready to drive a Jan Hammer instrumental wedded to congas,
    acidic bass, and loose, rubbery drum percussion with the timbre of
    hand-claps. The breakdown in the song's middle is wonderfully odd and
    unpredictable, as Torske (or his digital proxy) seems content to bang on things just for the joy of hearing them make noise.
    </p>
<p>
    A little while ago we <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/43270-bjrn-torske-mljekalas-mp3""><strong>highlighted</strong></a> ""Møljekalas"", the relaxed mid-tempo cut here that is both uncommonly
    blissful and clear-headed. On days when the sun is bright but
    the mercury is still reasonable and the humidity remains in check, not
    a whole lot from this year sounds better. <em>Feil Knapp</em>
    is a sense an easy record to overlook, since it contains little grit,
    zero angst, and next to no dark shading. It is, then, the perfect album for a certain kind of mood, a mood one hopes to find oneself in
    now and then as July turns to August here in the Northern Hemisphere.

    Like members of any good scene, the bands in Baltimore's Wham City collective and satellite friends-- Dan Deacon, Ponytail, Lizz King, Lexie Mountain Boys, Santa Dads, Videohippos,
    to name a few-- approach a similar aesthetic from different angles.
    Common ground: the exclamation point (everything is invariably rad! or
    free! or awesome! or something you can yell), indulgence in rebellion
    and art-school regression (warehouse squalor, communal everything),
    and, relatedly, a warped sense of nostalgia. This last point, though,
    is where the bands part ways: Lexie Mountain Boys sound like a playpen
    getting knocked over, Dan Deacon has encouraged audiences to imagine
    themselves in the rec rooms of their parents' houses scarfing pizza,
    and Videohippos-- well, Videohippos took me longer to parse.</p><p>
    It wouldn't be fair to call them the scene's melancholics, but let's propose a dichotomy: Dan Deacon makes kiddie overstimulation sound like fun. Relentless, ga-ga fun. Call the doctor! because I'm choking on fun. Videohippos' approach of wrapping simple, melodic pop-punk and Blondie riffs in toylike synths and effects pedals is that feeling's underbelly: numb, slate. <em>Unbeast the Leash</em> is 13 terse theme songs for an eight-hour day of cartoons and video games. And pre-adolescent
    boredom, lest you forget, is a rigorous bitch. Of course, the effect
    isn't just to retrieve that queasy, socked-out feeling from childhood,
    but-- and this is abundantly obvious from drummer Kevin O'Meara's video
    projections that blare during the band's performances-- to remind you
    that, yeah, media is still crammed down our throats, Bush Jr.'s smiling face is burned into our eager eyes, America eats its young, civilization is doomed, and so forth.</p><p>
    In that sense, <em>Unbeast the Leash</em> is a uniquely sad record, one that reminded me at first of the way New Order made dance music for clubgoers and downcast eyes alike-- at a Videohippos
    show in mid-July, I was among only a few people dancing, and the
    dancing was more like swaying. Photographs subsequently revealed Smiths
    fans quarantined in suburban bedrooms. O'Meara's kit faces away
    from the audience. He could be replaced by a drum machine (and often
    plays along with one), but the irony of letting a human do a machine's
    job is too rich to pass up. Guitarist and vocalist Jim Triplett stands
    motionless, staring at nothing in particular. He lets would-be rallying
    cries fizzle into statements of resignation. He swallows his words, and
    whatever comes out, comes out faint.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Unbeast the Leash</em>
    hits the same emotional note for about 30 minutes, but a) That's part
    of the point, and b) It's a note that most bands aren't able to hit:
    the deep comfort of a true bummer. In that sense, they're Baltimore's
    shoegazers. They turn the garage-party aesthetic into a faded
    photograph the way My Bloody Valentine suffocated eros with a pillow.
    It's not that <em>Unbeast the Leash</em> is a triumph on the scale of <em>Loveless</em>
    by any stretch, but like that album, it sounds at once a part of its
    scene and completely contrary to it, the warm crash as the sugar wears

    The Gourds are perhaps best known-- or most notorious-- for
    their bluegrass cover of Snoop Dogg's ""Gin and Juice"". Still better than Dynamite Hack's
    ""Boyz-N-The Hood"" or (gulp) Barenaked Ladies' ""Fight the Power"", the cover was
    a live show stunt, and the Austin-based quintet are lyrically and musically
    above such hokey novelty. On the other hand, their tenth album, <em>Noble Creatures</em>, shows they're perfectly
    suited to the more, um, substantial novelty of the buoyant horns on ""How Will
    You Shine?"" and the tensely thrumming organ on ""Kicks in the Sun""-- two of the
    album's most inventive and catchiest hooks.</p><p>
    Besides, the Gourds have also moved past bluegrass as an
    endpoint and have begun using it as a base for forays into other
    sounds and styles. Distinguishing them from one-time peers like the Hackensaw
    Boys and labelmates Chatham County Line, this new direction, as well as their punky
    restlessness and ongoing good humor, places them somewhere between the homespun
    artiness of Lambchop, the down-home exuberance of the Avett Brothers, and the
    give-'em-what-they-want chops of the Fabulous Thunderbirds.</p><p>
    Between these three nodes, they cover a lot of territory:
    the jamband harmonies of ""The Gyroscopic"", the slight country swing of ""Red
    Letter Day"", the Cajun dance party that is ""Cranky Mulatto"" and ""All in the
    Pack"", the swamp blues of ""Spivey"". The band contains not one, but two singer-songwriters-- Kevin ""Shinyribs""
    Russell and Jimmy Smith-- whose voices have a similar country texture and whose
    lyrics tend toward smart-aleck non sequiturs. ""Take all the guts of the middle
    ages/ And the confessions from the glass cages/ Tie it all together on four
    stages,"" Smith sings on ""A Few Extra Kilos"", then wraps it all up with a <em>Dr.
    Strangelove </em>quote: ""Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good time with all that in
    Vegas.""
    </p>
<p>
    Just when <em>Noble
    Creatures</em> begins to sound too wry for its own good, the Gourds offset the
    bouncy cleverness-- which likely plays well to excitable live audiences-- with
    slower, earnestly mournful songs like ""Last Letter"" and ""Promenade"". The latter
    is the album's best and most emotionally raw track, with a brutally rueful
    chorus: ""I traded yer sweetness for my loneliness/ Yer confidence for my own
    regrets/ Yer simple grace for this disarray."" Even the song's joke sounds
    knowingly pathetic, a chuckle that turns into a catch in the throat: ""Somehow
    my losing just comes natural/ Like a Southern democrat."" That they sound best
    on these soulful numbers proves the Gourds have more than a few tricks up their
    sleeves. For them, being underestimated just means they can surprise you more.

EP|4930.0|Emily Haines & the Soft Skeleton|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Last Gang']|2007-07-25 00:00:00|2007|2016-06-11 19:36:23.895348|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".24impzenh1c.1.6:0.1.0.$10452/=1$10452.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Turns out the predecessor to the new EP from Emily Haines and her assembled band the Soft Skeleton was one of the more overlooked records of last year.  With hindsight, <em>Knives Don't Have Your Back</em> was a comparatively grown-up whisper in the company of Haines' louder, more slickly aggressive work as the frontwoman of Metric.  In this scenario, it was easy to superficially dismiss <em>Knives</em> at face value: A one-off vanity project from an artist very familiar with collaboration.  Yet that appraisal couldn't be further from the truth; both <em>Knives</em>, as well as its five-song followup <em>What Is Free to a Good Home?</em>, are wonderfully singular works themselves, quite possibly representative of Haines' primary musical strength all along.<br/></p><p>
    Like much of the music from the Broken Social Scene cooperative, <em>Home</em> is forged with a muted eccentricity, rendering Haines' soft piano/voice jazz compositions woozy enough to complement the exhaustion in her voice. For example, the sighing brass that opens ""Rowboat"" and accompanies ""Telethon"" doesn't feel too far removed from the 3 a.m. trip-hop behind the remixed version of ""Mostly Waving"" that closes the record.  Lyrically, <em>Home</em> is as lonesome as <em>Knives</em>, yet the songs here are tuned to the specific type of weary solitude that gradually coalesces after successive nights of public socializing. In the song that takes its name from her unfortunate afterhours destination, she bemoans to a clique, ""you left me in a bar at the bottom of the world,"" and on ""Telethon"", she's reached the point at which ""daylight's like fluorescent light."" She's both worn and reaching out, but in a language leftover from last night's jukebox, or perhaps a late-night VH1 Classic binge. ""Telethon"" finds her in a ""bruised, Billy Joel New York State of Mind,"" and on ""The Bank"", she asks, ""Just like Huey Lewis, I need a new drug...that does what it should.""</p><p>
<em>Home</em>'s spirit isn't strictly devoted to pop-culture coated ruminations, however. Those with keen visual memories and/or an interest in the Canadian avant-garde might notice a similarity between its cover art (and <em>Knives'</em>) and that of the 1971 record <em>Escalator Over the Hill</em>, a collaboration between pianist/composer Carla Bley and poet Paul Haines, Emily's late father. His 2003 passing cast a pall over much of <em>Knives</em>, and this EP's release coincides with that of his first poetry compilation, <em>Secret Carnival Workers</em>. Of <em>Home</em>, Haines admitted in in a May interview with Pitchfork's Matthew Solarski, ""It's kind of like the final installment of my homage to my freaky, avant upbringing."" The record shares its title with a poem Paul wrote for the guitarist Robert Wyatt (who wrote the liner notes for <em>Knives</em>), and also features a light-headed treatment of his poem ""Sprig"". Especially when considering the heavy-lidded sentiment preceding it, Emily singing Paul's line ""falling asleep for the fifth time early in the morning,"" is much too appropriate to be anything but familial.</p></div>"|10452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10452-what-is-free-to-a-good-home-ep/|7.5|Eric Harvey

    Lavelle's UNKLE project has always hinted at a nebulous future realm. After
    all, UNKLE's DJ Shadow-assisted 1998 debut was dubbed <em>Psyence Fiction</em> and the
    first words heard on the record are ""somewhere in space, this may all be
    happening right now""-- a sample taken from the original <em>Star Wars</em> trailer. Lavelle's
    splintered media persona-- part clothing designer, part musician, part DJ, part
    label owner, part graphic designer-- lived up to this voyager ideal as well. And,
    with his penchant for throwing hip-hop, rock, dance and movie music into a zero
    gravity blender, Lavelle's intention seemed clear: Along with poorly-drawn, conehead-like
    aliens, the future will be marked by an über-genre mish-mash soundtrack. It's a
    nice idea.</p><p>
<em>
    Psyence Fiction</em> was an inconsistent affair, but
    even its failures were intriguing for either their
    flourishing pomp or overreaching ambition. Plus, how many albums do you know
    that feature original vocals from both Kool G Rap and Thom Yorke? With producer
    Richard File replacing Shadow as Lavelle's sonic point-man, 2004's <em>Never, Never
    Land</em> traded-in hip-hop rhythms for dance beats, but the LP lacked A-list talent and largely went unheard
    (no big loss there). And, by the time of <em>Never Land</em>'s release, the explosion of
    internet mash-ups and the proliferation of cross-genre mixers like Diplo and 2
    Many DJs were threatening to put Lavelle and his home-grown UNKLE mix-ups out
    to pasture. Skip ahead to the present and artists like Girl Talk and the Ed
    Banger crew are mastering Lavelle's one-time sonic utopia, cut and paste style.
    What's an intrepid dilettante with a brand new label and clothing line to do?
    Give up and start looking to the past, apparently.</p><p>
<em>
    War Stories</em> is the most unadventurous, most typically rock
    UNKLE release to date. With drums turned down and layers upon layers of fuzzy
    guitars and nonsensical hippie-isms turned up, it comes off like a castrated
    version of Primal Scream's searing <em>XTRMNTR</em>. Much of the new direction can be
    attributed to the addition of desert rock mastermind Chris Goss (Queens
    of the Stone Age, Masters of Reality), who helped out on production this time
    around. While Goss is undoubtedly a maverick when it comes to sunstroke sludge
    rock, his blurry style brings out Lavelle's lack of focus, resulting in several
    five-minute-plus mystical marathons that ride one mediocre riff all the way to
    glam-stomp oblivion. As for the guest list, either Lavelle misplaced a lot of
    phone numbers over the last decade or he's getting used to hearing
    ""no"" more often. Queens
    leader Josh Homme is joined by increasingly ancient Cult singer (and sometime
    Jim Morrison stand-in) Ian Astbury and Massive Attack's 3D. Elsewhere, second
    (third?) tier British garage rockers Duke Spirit, whiny folkie Gavin Clark, and
    producer File pop-up, too. It's even gotten to the point where Lavelle himself
    gets on the mic and does his best blank shoegazer on two tracks. Somewhere,
    Thom Yorke is not listening to <em>War Stories</em>.
    </p><p>
    The album's few salvageable moments are also the most
    rhythmic. ""Burn My Shadow"", with its pinpoint, stop-start snares and
    Astbury's wilting croon is close to harrowing and, like ""Rabbit in Your
    Headlights"" and ""Eye for an Eye"" before it, the song's
    exceptional video gives its new-age lyrics some much needed context. The
    Homme-sung ""Restless"" is an industrial-funk high that takes advantage
    of the singer's lofty falsetto...even if it's nearly over by the time it fully
    kicks in. Hazy L.A. rockers Autolux's ""Persons &amp; Machinery"" drags
    its ticky-tack metronome beat out about two minutes too long, but the song's
    central lyric-- a mix of apathy and anger aimed at Blair-Bush-- is one of the few
    that lives up to the album's provocative title: ""Please just follow your
    great plan through/ We've had it with you."" Elsewhere, moody epics
    ""Twilight"" and ""Price You Pay"" are so ethereal they quickly
    evaporate into nothing. The string-laden chug-a-lug scuzz rockers aren't worth
    mentioning by name.    
    </p>
    So, after trying to move things forward for so long-- first
    with his Mo' Wax label and then with UNKLE's early incarnations-- James Lavelle
    takes it back to a Britpop B-side wasteland filled with has-beens and
    never-will-be's. Such willful nostalgia doesn't do him many
    favors. While Lavelle's previous work can still be looked upon as visionary,
    his latest is anything but. Even with its repeatable tracks
    sounding instantly dated, <em>War Stories</em> marks the official end of this one-time
    progressive's soothsaying days.</div>"|10463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10463-war-stories/|4.5|Ryan Dombal

    One look at the etymology of the word ""gypsy"" and it becomes
    immediately clear why the Romani people, their descendants and distant
    cousins, often find the generalized term so distasteful, if not
    outright derogatory. The word ""gypsy"" stems from a mistaken early
    belief that the Roma came from Egypt, and was long invoked as a
    pejorative to impugn their trustworthiness. Relatively recently,
    historians have more accurately traced Roma roots back to India, but
    they somehow wound up dispersed throughout the Middle East, what used
    to be the Soviet Union, Africa, the Americas and, of course, Europe and
    the Balkans.</p><p>
    New
    York is the ultimate mixing pot and one of the few places on earth
    where you'll find people from all of those disparate places. New York
    is also, in essence, a city of gypsies, packed with people at once
    proud of their roots and their rootlessness. Gogol Bordello leader
    Eugene Hutz hails from the Ukraine, but from his brash appropriation of
    the word ""gypsy"" to the way his band (composed of a polyglot crew of
    diverse origins) incorporates just about every style of music that fits
    in the busy mix, he's a New Yorker to the core. Traditional Roma music
    draws from countless strains of folk. Gogol Bordello tosses in punk
    guitars and tempos, reggae, dance music, and whatever else strikes
    their fancy. It's the sound of the world, the West via the East, and
    from Beirut to Balkan Beat Box and even Basement Jaxx, it's become a
    full-on trend.</p><p>
    Yet you know a trend has not just fully arrived
    but may actually be on the wane when Madonna finally co-opts it.
    Indeed, seeing members of self-proclaimed ""gypsy punks"" Gogol Bordello
    on stage with the Material Matron during the naval gazing Live Earth
    festival hints that Eastern European folk-influenced rock acts may have
    reached maximum visibility. Really, how much accordion, horn, and
    fiddle kitsch can we take?
    </p>
<p>
    Apparently a lot, especially if done
    right. The gypsy-rock subgenre has thrived for decades. Wedding Present
    guitarist Peter Solowka did it with the frantic John Peel faves the
    Ukrainians. Camper Van Beethoven did it, and those Santa Cruz goofballs
    cited 1960s worldly psychedelic folk antecedents Kaleidoscope as one of
    their key inspirations. Maybe, rather than fade, the field will never
    shrink and only continue to grow, as more and more residents of the
    diffuse global village identify themselves-- both literally and
    figuratively-- as gypsy.
    </p>
<p>
    But as the novelty of bands like Gogol
    Bordello wears off, its music, ironically enough, begins to sound more
    and more like a novelty. While I was playing the group's new album <em>Super Taranta!</em>
    my mother-in-law walked into the room and asked me if I was listening
    to Weird Al. I shrugged off the query, but she had a point. Gogol
    Bordello is an exceedingly silly band, and even if it's not
    laugh-out-loud ha ha funny, there's more than a little ridiculousness
    to its self-consciously eclectic kitchen-sink approach.
    </p>
<p>
    Sure,
    the band knows how to entertain-- its breathless, breakneck live sets
    are the stuff of legend. But unlike the rough and ready Steve Albini-helmed
    <em>Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike</em>, <em>Super Taranta!</em>
    adds little to the group's musical vocabulary-- to be fair, perhaps an
    impossibility. When you start out with everything and anything, where
    do you go next?
    </p>
<p>
    The closest relative to the group is the
    oft-cited Pogues, but the Pogues-- with their marriage of the
    traditional and the iconoclastic-- pulled off the trick with poetry and
    craft. Gogol Bordello, on the other hand, is more crass, all about the
    superficial rush, but without much going on beneath the surface;
    consequently, the rush grows exhausting. The music is spirited, but
    lacks soul, and after you've heard the insane three and a half minutes
    of the first track ""Ultimate"", you pretty much get the point.
    </p>
<p>
    That's
    not to dismiss the pleasures of ""Harem in Tuscany (Taranta)"", the party
    crashing thrash of ""American Wedding"", or the adenoidal reggae of
    ""Tribal Connection"". But just as you can't listen to a light show,
    music this theatrical demands a stage. On disc it plays a bit like a
    conversation-starting party favor: colorful and bright, but no
    substitute for actually being there.

    Last
    spring at Coachella, the reunited Crowded House was given the thankless task of preceding
    the reunited Rage Against the Machine on the very same stage. Needless to say,
    reports were mixed as to how well the crowd, swelled by Rage fans staking out
    an early spot during Crowded House's set, responded to the band's comeback. But
    despite the antipodean group's intermittent success around the globe, there's
    never been a clear place for a songwriter like Neil Finn.</p><p>
    Finn
    may lack the hip bona fides that Coachella thrives on, but he easily outclasses
    most of the competition across the board. When asked on a radio show several
    years ago to name a songwriter who sounded like the Beatles but didn't simply
    rip them off, Steve Earle quickly named Finn. Finn has fans in several other
    perhaps unlikely corners of the pop and rock world as well. His 2001 live album <em>7 Worlds Collide</em> featured a band comprising Johnny Marr, Lisa Germano, two
    members of Radiohead, and Eddie Vedder.</p><p>
    While
    Finn's perhaps best known for Crowded House, he's never been the type to coast
    on the Crowded House name. After all, the first signs of his pop genius came
    when he joined his big brother Tim in Split Enz at a mere 19 and immediately
    established himself as a pop wunderkind. Crowded House came next, finding great
    success first in America before conquering the rest of the world. Cult fame
    followed, as Crowded House was put on permanent hiatus and Finn's solo career
    showed him taking several idiosyncratic steps that further burnished his
    reputation as a pop songwriter par excellence perennially averse to clichés.
    </p>
<p>
    Reuniting
    Crowded House, honestly, may be the ultimate cliché, but hey, Finn's always
    been the sentimental sort. Despite a sometimes contentious relationship with
    brother Tim in both Split Enz and, briefly, in Crowded House, he has
    occasionally re-teamed with him in the Enz and as the Finn Brothers, a
    celebration of their filial bond; despite Neil's solo career in progress, the
    Finns just did it again in 2004 after their mother died. As for Crowded House,
    the idea to dust off the name came after the 2005 suicide of founding drummer
    Paul Hester, who had left the band while touring behind its fourth and (then)
    final album, 1993's <em>Together Alone</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    The
    absence of Hester is in part what makes <em>Time on Earth</em> such an initially
    dubious reunion. Yes, bassist Nick Seymour is back in the fold, but Hester's by
    necessity been replaced by a new drummer, Matt Sherrod, a veteran of Beck's band. Filling out
    the ranks is Mark Hart (a one-time Supertramp hired gun), who had joined
    Crowded House in time for <em>Together Alone</em>. As usual, it's Finn in control,
    so Seymour or not, why call it Crowded House at all?
    </p>
<p>
    Yet
    just a few tracks into <em>Time on Earth</em> and there's no question how much the
    disc sounds not like Split Enz, not the Finn Brothers or solo Neil Finn, but,
    yes, like Crowded House. The economy of Ethan Johns' and Steve Lillywhite's production helps, as do
    the straightforward arrangements and, most important of all, Finn's most
    commercial and least quirky set of songs since 1991's <em>Woodface</em>, or even the
    group's self-titled 1986 debut. 
    The mood is still often melancholic and dark, but the no muss four-piece
    interplay showcases Finn's gift, as demonstrated by ""Don't Dream It's Over"" on
    down, for finding optimism on the outskirts of defeat.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Nobody
    Wants To"", with its atmospheric guitar and backing vocals, eases the transition
    from <em>Together Alone</em>, but by the first single ""Don't Stop Now"" the mood has
    perked. ""She Called Up"" crosses
    the manic glee of ""Something So Strong"" with a quirky nyah-nyah bridge worthy
    of prime Madness. Or Spilt Enz, for that matter. The lyrics are essentially
    Finn's take on making lemonade from lemons: ""The hurt
    that you have so close,"" he sings, ""is something better now.""
    </p>
<p>
    ""Even a Child"" bears the unmistakable chiming stamp of Finn buddy
    (and co-writer) Johnny Marr,
    back for more, while the album elsewhere allows
    Finn to retool and reclaim ""Silent House"", his contribution to the
    Dixie Chicks'  albm <em>Taking The Long Way</em>, as a tribute to Hester. As always,
    Finn's ballads
    shine, with the piano-led anti-war ""Pour Le Monde"" and the electric-piano and
    strings waltz ""You Are The One to Make Me Cry"" weepy without being wimpy
    (even if neither quite holds a candle to the hypnotic and graceful ""Gentle Hum""
    from the last Finn Brothers disc). Then again, the perfectly named ""A Sigh""
    sounds like just that, a gorgeous daydream of a song.
    </p>
<p>
    All is not perfect. Like <em>Woodface</em>, at nearly an hour long and
    weighed down by a few too many mid-tempo tracks, <em>Time on Earth</em> gets a little
    out of the band's control. ""Transit Lounge"" features a distracting turn from
    singer Beth Rowley, while the nostalgic Old Country tribute ""English Trees""
    probably would have worked better with brother Tim.
    </p>
<p>
    These are minor quibbles, though, as Finn's forte has always been
    as a songwriter first and foremost, not a pretentious album-length crafter of
    grand cohesive statements or conveyor of didactic meaning. He writes deeply
    personal pop songs with oblique lyrics and deceptively tricky melodies, but no
    matter who (or what) Finn is mourning, he leaves it up to the listener to make
    it all fit. As easy as it may be for some to dismiss Crowded House as easy
    listening, it's the band's open-ended quality, its dedication to both bare
    emotion and ambiguity, that in some ways make it the most difficult kind of
    listen of all.

    The Kenyan octet Kenge Kenge makes music that sounds
    thrillingly new, but it's really as old as the hills of Kenya, or at
    least the people who live in those hills, the Luo. The band's name is a Luo
    expression that roughly means ""fusion of small, exhilarating instruments,"" and
    you have to love any language that has a colloquial expression for something
    like that.  This music sounds for all the
    world as though it's being created at least partially by electronic means, but
    there's actually not an electric instrument in earshot
    on the band's debut album (apart from a bit of bass), which finds them plying a style similar to the
    driving <em>benga</em> sound that's dominated
    Kenyan pop music since Daniel Owino Misiani's Shirati Jazz band brought it to
    national prominence in the late 1960s.</p><p>
    The twist here, though, is that <em>benga</em>, which developed over a roughly twenty-year period before
    becoming a mainstream force, is an electric form centered on the guitar. What
    the members of Kenge Kenge have done is look at <em>benga</em>, which is still a very popular style in East
    Africa, and subtract many of the foreign elements that influenced
    its evolution, including Congolese soukous and South African kwela. That means
    no electric guitars, or even acoustic guitars. Kenge Kenge have brought out the genre's
    Luo cultural roots by playing it on traditional regional instruments, including an
    eight-stringed lyre, a ""sound box,"" a small gong called a <em>nyangile</em>, assorted tuned percussion instruments, and a one-stringed
    fiddle.</p><p>
    The driving rhythm of <em>benga</em>,
    with all four beats of the measure fully accented, is very much here, but the
    implication is that the pulse is one part of the overall <em>benga</em> sound that was supplied by traditional Kenyan styles. The
    lyrics, all in Luo, frequently deal with the subject of dancing, but love songs
    and praise songs (for both people and animals) are also on tap, and ""Piny
    Agonda"" is social commentary to dance to. If the great African styles-- benga,
    highlife, soukous, kwela, mbalax, juju, apala, Afrobeat, mbaqanga, local
    hip-hop subgenres, and others-- have much in common, it's probably the tendency
    to get people dancing to music that tells a story or comments on a the social
    condition, a descendant of oral history traditions such as West African griots
    and Ethiopian azmari. This music follows that tendency.
    </p>
<p>
    The disc's opener, ""Kenge Kenge"", begins with a modal flute
    solo before the percussion enters; when the drums do arrive, it's like
    aliens
    landing in your Western ears. These drums have extremely distinct pitch
    and
    musical tone-- the underlying rhythm of the song is as much a melody as
    what the
    fiddle snaking around the vocals plays. The ""sound box,"" as it's
    credited,
    produces a piercing tone similar to striking metal with a mallet-- it
    also calls to mind the amplification of the thumb piano with which DR
    Congo's Konono
    No. 1 stormed the world a couple years ago. Lead singer George Achieng sings
    a series of cascading, fluid phrases over the beat, backed by a constantly
    repeating, three-part harmony recitation of the title.
    </p>
<p>
    The beat on ""Anyango Mbeo"" sounds like a slow drum machine
    program until you listen closely and realize the subtle differences in each
    percussive sound and the spaciousness of the recording. Audio illusions such as
    this abound to tease our rock 'n' roll-trained ears. ""Otenga""
    is a surging
    dance track that uses the flute as a rhythm instrument and features an
    odd horn that resembles a distorted percussion instrument.
    </p>
<p>
    Western listeners accustomed to deliberate variety and song
    structures shaped by recording formats and commercial radio airplay concerns
    may find it somewhat difficult to sit still through the disc's full 70 minutes,
    but it's important to realize that Kenge Kenge are working with a completely
    different paradigm. With no
    verse/chorus structure and a tendency toward hypnotic stasis, this is somehow
    simultaneously folk music and melodic pop music that functions in much the same
    way that a lot of club music does: It aims to move you and keep you
    moving, and wants to tell you a story in the bargain. Whatever its musicological
    place, it does its job well, returning a popular style to its roots and making
    something new and fresh in the process.

    Karen O has a curious range. She possesses a low, clear,
    expressive voice that communicates tender-hearted vulnerability easily and
    evocatively. But she also effortlessly reaches upper registers of grotesquerie,
    brazenly barking and blasting wordless sounds at her audience. It's easy to
    take this range for granted or simply to disregard it as another element in O's
    high-fashion stage show, but it's a critical factor of her performance and
    identity. One style is tender and pretty, the other ugly and visceral. They're
    often considered the flipsides of the same complicated woman, but more likely they
    arise from the same confessional impulse: On ""Maps"", ""Cheated Hearts"", and ""Turn
    Into"" (the best songs she's written), she exposes her fears, needs, and
    insecurities in a straightforward and fairly conventional way, but on ""Black
    Tongue"", ""Art Star"", and ""Tick"", she turns herself inside out for her audience,
    showing her bones as well as her blood, guts, and organs.</p><p>
    O tends towards the latter-- in concentrated form-- on <em>Is Is</em>, an EP collecting newly recorded songs written in 2004 between their 2003 debut <em>Fever
    to Tell</em> and their 2006 follow-up, <em>Show
    Your Bones</em>. With its martial beat and start-stop momentum, opener ""Rockers
    to Swallow"" is full of empty, threatening spaces, which O half-fills with
    barked commands that sound alternately like Ozzy on ""Crazy Train"" and a
    maniacal drill sergeant. Nick Zinner and Brian Chase-- who have just
    as much range as their bandmate-- sound like they're playing against each other.
    It's a shoot-out, with the audience caught in the crossfire.</p><p>
    In fact, there's barely a song there. ""Rockers to Swallow""
    is all performance. This is what they do best. Their self-titled debut and the
    follow-up <em>Fever to Tell</em> sounded like
    the band had cobbled the songs together from frayed scraps found in skuzzy
    alleyways, bars, dives, cheap walk-ups, and vacant lots-- in other words, from
    real experiences in New York-- which
    made them a compelling alternative to their club-bound peers. In contrast to <em>Fever</em>, <em>Show Your Bones</em> felt written, as if O deliberately sat down to put
    her feelings onto paper and the band booked studio time to turn those
    scribblings into songs. 
    </p>
<p>
    Produced by Australian Nick Launay (who recorded Gang of
    Four, Killing Joke, and Public Image Ltd), <em>Is Is</em> stands somewhere between the two albums: It never feels as fully lived-in as <em>Fever</em>, but sounds looser and
    more off-the-cuff than <em>Bones</em>. Like
    ""Rockers to Swallow"", the title track is an elaboration of grunts and riffs,
    with O growling to the rafters in other buildings and Zinner's aggressive
    guitar spiraling psychedelically around Chase's high-hat-riding beat. But the
    remaining three tracks are songs in a more traditional sense-- and good ones at
    that. ""Kiss Kiss"" achieves a throbbing forward motion, with Zinner's guitar
    churning a bass riff that propels O's tense, terse vocal melodies and sexually
    conflicted lyrics. 
    </p>
<p>
    Even when she's singing, she still punctuates her words with
    an arsenal of onomatopoeia: the girlish ah-ahs on ""10x10"" contrasting the
    wounded, nearly spoken intro; the yowls that precede the chorus on ""Down Boy"";
    the throat-scraping growl on the title track. Each aspect of her stage identity
    finds equal expression on these songs, which only makes them sound more
    immediate and affecting. In fact, <em>Is Is</em> may be their most instantly accessible release,
    which is not a critical dig but just a way of saying it finds a good balance
    between alienating and inviting, between song and performance. This dynamic
    could sustain an entire album, but the EP's brevity is the key to its appeal:
    the Yeah Yeah Yeahs know enough to leave you wanting more.

    After a two-year wait, John Vanderslice follows 2005's <em>Pixel Revolt</em>, an album waist-deep in post-9/11 dread and despair, with 2007's <em>Emerald City</em>, an album waist-deep in post-9/11 dread and despair.  If the previous sentence makes the new album sound like it's a carbon copy of its predecessor, then you see what I'm getting at.  Vanderslice reportedly wrote most of the album while trying to resolve some visa issues concerning his French girlfriend entering the U.S.  The album's concluding track, ""Central Booking"", is the one song that directly addresses this issue, though its concluding thesis-- ""looks like September won once again""-- hangs over the entire album.</p><p>
    As with <em>Pixel Revolt</em>, nearly half of the tracks make mention of, or allude to, the World Trade Center attacks, while the rest of the songs are awash in the debris and carnage from the tragedy and its aftermath.  Even the album's title is a pointed reference, the ""Emerald City"" being a derogatory nickname for the ""Green Zone"" in downtown Baghdad.  However, while Vanderslice's observations and commentary sounded fresh and fierce two years ago, the same essential message run through similarly sounding songs this time around rings hollow.</p><p>
    Musically, Vanderslice is on top of his game, deftly walking the line between tasteful and ostentatious, but even his skill in this regard can't soften the heavy-handed rhetoric.  The queasy acoustic guitars on ""Kookaburra"" lend the song (which details the apocalyptic power of  ""lightning shot from the sky"", a recurring theme) an unsettling air, while the lilting piano figure of ""The Parade"" sets a happy scene for what turns out to be another ironically bittersweet paean to the collapse of the towers (never mind an awful case of synthesizer flatulence in the bridge).  Throughout the album, Vanderslice chooses to use amplified acoustic guitars, similar to what you'd hear on Spoon albums.  They lend the more aggressive tracks (like ""Time to Go"" and ""White Dove"") a percussive propulsion, but these gains are undercut by the lyrics' lack of oomph.  
    </p>
<p>
    In the past, Vanderslice could infuse both his fictional and non-fictional songs with a convincing emotional heft.  This time around, he's as eloquent as he's ever been, refining and strengthening his short-story songwriting style.  However, the constant referral to ""lighting from the sky"" and towers and drones flying by becomes as cloying and ineffective as the multiple references to 9/11 utilized by political hopefuls and pundits.  Only on the album's concluding track does Vanderslice snap out of his insightful ennui and involve the listeners in what he's saying.  The brief verses of ""Central Booking"" concerning the plight of his girlfriend and him being separated by distance and bureaucratic red tape ring truer than the purporetedly heady rush of imagery concerning a woman's dead daughter (""White Dove"") or a Cindy Sheehan-esque war protester (""Tablespoon of Codeine"").  The worst offender is ""Time to Go"", the portentous story of a wagon-train trying desperately to cross the country (""Burn the wagon wheels for heat"").
    </p>
<p>
    Even on a short-and-sweet track like ""Numbered Lithograph""-- a song that sounds an awful lot like something his last album's co-conspirator, the Mountain Goats' John Darnielle, would put to tape-- there's something missing.  The idiosyncratic references that would ground the lyric sound forced, and the more immediate details (""Your cellphone shuddered and blinked/ It was your boyfriend again"") don't resonate.  Maybe the album falls short because of what Vanderslice claims at the end of ""The Minaret"": ""I can see both sides, and it paralyzed me.""

    Chromeo's Dave 1 keeps his cool, even in the middle of a domestic
    scrap. ""Let's keep the screaming and the fighting and the crying to a
    minimum,"" he says on ""My Girl is Calling Me (A Liar)"", ""and if the
    kitchen don't work we can fight in the living room,"" biting off that
    last syllable sharply enough to force the rhyme. Before the household
    battles, presumably, comes the pick-up, and he's good at that too: ""Let
    me tell you that I saw your boyfriend, walking down the street,""
    goes ""Bonafied Lovin' (Tough Guys)"". ""He was standing all shaky, hands
    all sweaty, and he could hardly speak/ I might as well take a minute or
    two to put you on to some game: You got a boy like him, a man like me,
    and that's just not the same.""</p><p>
    Best friends Dave 1 (aka David Macklovitch, A-Trak's older brother)
    and P-Thugg, who give one another common sense advice as part of their
    tracks, don't self-edit much. ""Just take her to movies and you're bound
    to work it out,"" interjects P-Thugg, via telephone, on ""My Girl Is
    Calling Me"". The band's self-consciously limited palette-- an
    electrofunk-by-numbers mélange of talk boxes, 808s, canned percussion,
    and Prince-style atmospherics-- is just another manifestation of their
    inability to tell a lie. If a song's called ""Fancy Footwork"", it's
    going to be about fancy footwork.</p><p>
    Cocksmen they may be, but it's a thing they've got to talk themselves
    into. Faux-ballad ""Momma's Boy"" is a mashed-out keyboard confessional
    about a romance between a girl in love with her dad and a boy equally
    in love with his mom. A novelty song with a happy ending, the two of
    them figure something out: The girl looks like his mom, and he looks
    like her dad, so they're all set. On the 1980s throwback ""Opening Up (Ce Soir On Danse)"",
    Macklovitch is in the middle of baring his soul to a new girlfriend
    when he loses her number. He's got to ask her, ""Tell me what numbers to
    dial, 'cause I've been strung out for a while."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Going over the top here is just part of the package. The skin flick sax
    on ""100%"", the ripping, non sequitur guitar solo on ""Momma's Boy"", the
    straight ""1999""-rip that is ""Outta Sight"": These are the consequences
    of getting in the mood. Better that than the cynical grab at pop star detachment that is ""Tenderoni"", <em>Fancy Footwork</em>'s
    first single and far and away worst song. Built around a bad bit of
    slang that fell out of favor years ago, Macklovitch utters platitudes
    like ""You and I/ Baby we go side by side"" before rapping about getting
    in those pants over some slap bass. All you need to save songs like
    these is to not blink in the face of the irony, the shtick,
    whatever-- just don't break the frame, right?
    </p>
<p>
    More lovable is their ""Intro"", where over some tinnily epic synths the
    two Chromeos get a girl to chant their name, over and over, the three
    syllables ascending like stadium entrance music. This is surely what
    they come out to when they play live. And though it may hype a crowd
    it's obvious it's there for them too. Nerdy guys in sunglasses, they've
    got to convince themselves of their cool before they go to work on us.

Olausson, a sugar beet farmer from Landskrona, Sweden, appeared to be particularly well situated to craft the sort of insular, deeply personalized outsider statement that has proven increasingly elusive in recent years. And true to its promise, <i>Moonlight Farm</i> beautifully evokes the best of the acid-folk private press, yet still manages to set itself apart with the deceptive elegance of its design. Now issued on CD for the first time, the album has lost nothing of its disquieting allure, as Olausson's deliberate, unhurried performances and gnomic songs serve to ensnare the listener again and again.      <span class=""productName""> </span></p>
<p>On repeated listens, of course, it becomes clear that the music on <i>Moonlight Farm</i> is considerably less hermetic than it might initially appear. Though the album owes little to any easily tagged folk traditions, there are hints that Olausson has a comfortable working knowledge of his international loner-folk ancestry. With its hazy, swirling atmospherics and dim fidelity, <i>Moonlight Farm</i> at once conjures the afterimages of such self-documenting pioneers as Jandek or Skip Spence, as well as the work of 4-track luminaries ranging from Scotland's Richard Youngs to New Zealand's Graeme Jefferies. Though Olausson's homespun arrangements are filled with surprising touches-- a flourish of sitar, a momentary burst of flute-- they're all treated with such an organic, understated character that it often takes several listens for their presence to even register.</p>
<p>Unlike such troubled figures as Spence, however, Olausson here sounds clear-eyed and direct beneath his surface mysticism, cautioning ""Don't hide your head in the sand/ for God's sake, don't run away to Neverland"" at one point on ""Silhouette V"". Yet thanks largely to his decision to double-track all his vocals, even relatively straightforward tracks like ""Welcome Traveler"" are delivered with a disorienting wobble, while the bent notes of the brief instrumental ""The Wind Combs Her Hair"" can sound almost South Asian in origin, as though they've strayed from some as yet uncompiled Sublime Frequencies collection.</p>
<p>On such pieces as ""Napalm Sky"" or ""Live to Tell"", Olausson shows an admirable willingness to lapse into atonality and dissonance, but without ever fully abandoning the song's essential melodic aims. In contrast, tracks like the irresistible, violin-traced opener ""What Will Tomorrow Bring"" or the intimate ""Listen Sister"" are wholly hummable, and the electric guitar lead on ""At the Citadel"" sounds like it could soon to carry him into a far more conventional, rock-centric climate.</p>
<p>As is often the case with such hushed bedroom broadcasts, <i>Moonlight Farm</i> leaves the listener with the tantalizing question of what might happen if Olausson were to ever find his way into a proper studio, ready to attack his song-based material with an adventurous group of musicians behind him. For the moment, he seems perfectly willing to let us wonder. His more recent projects have found him moving outward in several directions simultaneously, exploring homespun free jazz in his duo Sus &amp; Jakob and heavier space rock with his group Renegade Scanners. The wayfaring nature of these outside projects only serves to reinforce the idea of <i>Moonlight Farm</i> as an especially happy accident, the brilliant labor of an enlightened mind captured at precisely the right place and in the right time.</p></div>"|10447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10447-moonlight-farm/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

    Reminiscent of the disheveled, gravelly properties of Electrelane, L.A.-based Midnight Movies' second album converges the vitreous vocals of singer Gena Olivier with the boat rudder effects of the band's instrumentation: grumbling organ, guitar, bass, and dutiful drums. These murky 11 tracks, produced by Steve Fisk of Soundgarden and Nirvana fame, mingle the listless, ruminative qualities of punk with, dare I say, a woman's touch. Bolstered by original guitarist Larry Schemel and the recent additions of bassist Ryan Wood and drummer Sandra Vu, Olivier's clear, often reverberated vocals are the sweet voice of reason behind the instruments' punch and the guitars' acerbic blows. On ""Hide Away"" her refrain, ""I will find you,"" is as flatly delivered and monotonous as any number of post-punk vocalists, yet it's still awfully effective and charming.<br/></p><p>
    ""Ribbons"", which follows, is a glittery, girly affair dressed in the moping heartache of the Cure, or better yet, a 1950s prom sendoff, full of plush, waltzing percussion, and a wide range of soulful, strong vocal notes. Here Olivier flirts with Becky Stark's impressive soprano work. But with her backup pumping out a weak pulse in the heavily echoed background, the effect is subtler and wins us over with the warm organ and bow-out lyric, ""You're all I want to know."" The song, in the end, has more feeling than a mirrorball'd high school gym, the last line bearing the weight of experience.</p><p>
    Even if we leave aside imaginative, other-worldly titles like ""Coral Den"", ""Ribbons"", and ""Bell Tower,"" the Movies, here and there, show glimmers of the fleeting, ghostly structures of Beach House's 2006 debut. ""Bell Tower"" is the hung over, washed out, pretty vitriol to ""Coral Den""'s boisterous acceleration. ""Den"" only differs from the pervasive guitar monologues found on Electrelane's latest because it contains more lyrics, and while the Movies' little vertiginous cameos can hold sway on their own, this band is considerably more dependent on its lead singer. And what a minor key can do to suggest lyrical profundity that may not actually be there: ""Parallel Paramour"" possesses many of the decorations this album wants to show off: fingers-on-chalkboard acid guitar solos, undulating or piercing organ, and a slew of dark melodic moments that drag us into a damp fog of emotion, if only we could hear its verbal meaning.  </p><p>
    But on the punchy Doors throwback ""24 Hour Dream"" it suffices to nod in slow-mo head-bang to the heaving rainstorm of a chorus, a downtrodden yet ardent sticky-note about the end of time, or so the musical notes suggest. Creeping keyboards and wobbly effects pedals keep up the pleasant Zombies vibes through to the end, but never abandoning rock. ""Dawn"" may be an entire intro-- an ice-cream truck song remixed for the soundtrack of <em>Blue Velvet</em>, perhaps-- but ""Two Years"" insists on the oddly triumphant heft of sheer noise, both the sunny, shortlived intro and energetic chorus making a piece that goes from strength to strength, historical chapter to chapter.

    We
    always expect too much of Prince, because it's difficult to accept that
    somebody who made records as astonishing as he did in the 1980s could repeat himself as
    egregiously as he has for the past 15 years or so. He hasn't been doing r&amp;b-by-numbers or rock-by-numbers, which is why he gets away with
    it; he's just been doing Prince-by-numbers. And yes, he still brings it
    live. But
    his albums used to send everyone scrambling to catch up; now

    Princeophiles
    always have a few great recent songs we can trot out as evidence he
    hasn't <em>really</em> lost it. Last time, it was ""Black Sweat""; this
    time, it's ""Mr. Goodnight"", a sticky-hot seduction rap that all but
    acknowledges the genre's latter-day debt to Smoove B. He rhymes ""Moët""
    with ""private jet,"" namechecks 3121 (maybe the album, maybe the club),
    shouts out ""mp3!"" and offers to lay out three dresses (so you can pick
    the one you like) and call you to find out which you've picked so he
    can wear a matching suit.

    Most of <em>Planet Earth</em>, though, is textbook bad Prince. It's one thing to work
    from the assumption that he's the hottest thing on two legs, because
    he's never lost that. But when he works from the assumption that his
    political thoughts are deep and meaningful, he bricks. The title track
    is an ecological anthem so dopey it makes saving the world sound like a
    questionable idea; the closer, ""Resolution"", is an antiwar anthem so
    self-righteous it makes peace sound smug. ""The main problem with war is
    that nobody ever wins,"" goes the first line, and as
    above-all-you-mortals as prime-period Prince's politics could get
    (remember ""Hello""?), at least he never tried to tell us what the main
    problem with war was.

    The
    rest of the album is stuff he's done before and better. ""The One U
    Wanna C"" is a blatant rewrite of ""I Could Never Take the Place of Your
    Man"" (right down to the declaration that ""you ain't no one night
    stand"") without the emotional depth, subtlety, or musical
    eccentricities. ""Guitar"", a reminder that he plays guitar, doesn't even have
    much of a riff. ""Chelsea Rodgers"" is an incoherently moralistic
    disco jam that squashes its groove between big, dangling quotation
    marks, as if it came to the West End Records sound by way of an Of

    Well,
    he's not entirely gone-- that's why we keep listening. There are always
    flashes of him, as at the end of the pedestrian slow jam ""Future Baby
    Mama"", where he goes into a purring little recitative, ending ""deep
    down, I know what you want-- you want your girlfriends to hate you.""
    Then he harmonizes with himself in one of his thick, layered
    harmony-clusters: ""'Cause they can't get your man!"" ""Somewhere Here on
    Earth"" is the kind of bedroom-eyed ballad he used to knock out
    one-handed in the <em>Parade</em> days, enlivened by his freaky but kind of
    fantastic Billie Holiday impression, but tragically oversold by witless
    jazz piano and an overdubbed ""crackly record"" sound. The album's cameo
    appearances by Wendy &amp; Lisa and Sheila E. are overt signals that this
    is supposed to be a new manifestation of the prodigal Prince, the one
    who had all the hits; that he's going to spray us all down with his
    magical ejaculating guitar, just like the old days.

    And,
    you know, he might. He doesn't this time, but he might yet; if this
    were his first album, it'd be really promising. It's entirely possible
    that Prince's problem isn't sputtering talent but QC on the fritz. A
    whack to the right part of the machine, and his next whole album could
    be as hot as ""Mr. Goodnight"" and ""Black Sweat"" and, I don't know,
    ""Cinnamon Girl"". As it is, though, he's firmly settled in a stylistic
    niche that's delivering diminishing returns-- and what made him great in
    the first place is that he never settled down anywhere for long.</p></div>"|10450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10450-planet-earth/|4.8|Douglas Wolk

In 1994, artists like R.E.M., Morrissey, Beck, and Nirvana topped Billboard's Modern Rock Track charts for a significant number of weeks. Then, just one year later, walking time capsules like Live, Better Than Ezra, Goo Goo Dolls, and Silverchair supplanted them. Armed with three producer-musicians and a jaw-dropping frontwoman, Garbage hatched from that aesthetic fall-out, poised to lay claim to the rock-radio vacuum. <em>Absolute Garbage</em> neatly documents their attempted coup, reminding us that, for better or worse, Garbage were one of the most memorable rock bands in the initial post-grunge years.</p><p>
    Despite the number of grunge/goth markers they flaunted-- circles under the eyes, grainy, psychologically 'disturbing' videos, a self-flagellating ethos-- Garbage was undeniably pop from the onset. <em>Absolute Garbage</em>'s tracklist and accompanying DVD attest to this, displaying how the band often milked five or six singles from an album and made the right music videos to sell them. Adhering strictly to chronological order, the album kicks off with the band's debut and best material. Techno-rock hybrids like ""Milk"" and ""Vow"" don't sound so novel today in a world Pro-Tooled to perfection, but the band's production troika, led by <em>Nevermind </em>and <em>Siamese Dream</em> svengali Butch Vig, deftly manipulated simple, catchy melodies  and chord progressions to maximize their cross-genre fanbase. Bereaved Cobain apostles could rally behind ""Only Happy When It Rains"" for its woe-is-me irony and fuzzy bassline, while MTV-crazed teeny boppers simply couldn't get enough of Shirley Manson's girl group-friendly hooks.</p><p>
    Validated by their debut's success, Garbage cranked up the hit machine to 11 with <em>Version 2.0</em>, a blockbuster of an album that contributes five solid tracks here. Feeding off the late-90s success of the Chemical Brothers and Daft Punk, the band's pop songs received a house injection with ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Push It"" soaring over newfound glitchy percussion and robotic guitar effects. However, the real apex here is ""Special"", an infectious Pretenders ode able to stand on its own without the studio bells and whistles.
    </p><p>
    The turn of the century wasn't kind to the band, and the compilation's  final third reminds us of this all too painfully. Creative juices  clearly were in short supply by the 1999 Bond theme ""The World Is Not Enough"", a predictable ""Goldfinger"" permutation signaling the band's limitless  affinity for big budget theatrics. When 2001's <em>beautifulgarbage </em>took a stab at more ""experimental"" territory-- a move Garbage weren't equipped for-- Manson ended up sounding as bubblegum as the girly-girl late 90s singers she distinguished herself from on earlier releases. ""Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)"" and ""Shut Your Mouth"" ape Gwen Stefani hella bad, while ""Bleed Like Me""'s boring acoustic guitar and sarcastic lyrics scream out Sheryl Crow.
    </p>
<p>
    Spanking new single ""Tell Me Where It Hurts"", swollen with canned strings and Manson's Chrissie Hynde affectations, provides little hope for a Garbage rebound. The band's seemingly desperate to reinvigorate their cultural cachet, but <em>Absolute Garbage</em>'s latter half emphasizes the depths they've fallen. Even on the enclosed DVD documentary, the band never appears as profound or engaging as the peripheral artists (c.f. Dave Grohl, Trent Reznor) they bump elbows with. Still, even the most hardened underground scenester may be surprised at how many quality hits they'll recognize on this collection. Whether classified as an extremely accessible grunge band or an extremely demented S&amp;M pop outfit, the band left an indelible mark on mainstream rock in an era when boy bands, latin pop explosions, swing revivals and other cringe-worthy fads were gobbling rock bands up. It's just a shame Garbage had to outlive their usefulness to such an aesthetically displeasing degree.

    In 2004, when Numero Group inaugurated its ambitious, by now
    essential <em>Eccentric Soul</em> series, it
    did so with a volume devoted to Bill Moss' Columbus, Ohio,
    label Capsoul. It was a disc that spoke to the enormous promise of such a
    project, and the imprint has since released five more excellent volumes in the series,
    excavating labels from Detroit, Chicago,
    Florida and Arizona. Perhaps it was just all the
    tantalizing names or references to the scene dropped in the liners of the
    Capsoul comp, but there was a sense of unfinished business regarding the world
    of Columbus small-label soul after that volume,
    and sure enough, Numero has returned to central Ohio for its latest.</p><p>
    It would have been hard for a label to experience less sales
    success than Capsoul, but Prix Records, the distribution arm of the Harmonic Sounds
    studio, managed the trick. It was virtually unknown even in its day, serving
    more as a laboratory for musicians than a factory for hit 45s. In business for
    an eye-blink
    from 1969 to 1971, the studio and label nonetheless churned out a
    bonanza of killer funk and soul cuts, all of which went nowhere. And
    that's just what got released. Thirty years after the label closed its
    doors, a mostly
    unmarked box of demo recordings and a few finished masters showed up at
    an
    estate sale, waiting to be heard for the first time outside of Harmonic
    Sounds.</p><p>
    Enter Numero, whose compilation mixes the released 45s with
    the unreleased stuff to tell the story of a remarkable assemblage of talent
    that was, alas, destined to toil in obscurity. Prix Records was founded by an
    unlikely duo: Mississippi-born Clem Price, a veteran who worked much of his
    life for a defense contractor, and George Beter, a floundering West Virginian
    lawyer whose brother introduced him to Price. The first group signed to Prix,
    the Royal Esquires, was drafted in its entirety after recording just one
    single, as apt an omen for the fate of the label overall as any.
    </p>
<p>
    Both sides of that single are here, both of them fantastic
    vocal harmony numbers that blend doo-wop
    techniques with then-modern r&amp;b
    production. The members do some nice lead-trading in the faster of the
    two, ""Ain't Gonna Run"", and both songs were co-written by member Ron
    Farthing,
    a talented multi-instrumentalist who worked at a studio across town.
    ""Melon
    Jelly"", credited to the Soul Ensemble, is actually Farthing in the
    studio by
    himself, doing everything from playing drums to singing harmony,
    playing lead
    guitar, and making himself into an entire horn section.
    </p>
<p>
    Farthing was part of the Soul Partners, one of hundreds of
    extraordinary and completely unknown backing bands across the country who
    soundtracked the youths of an entire generation without anyone even realizing
    it. The Partners later had some small-scale success as the Buckeye Politicians,
    but that was after Prix was long-gone. Prix's central singing talent was the
    luckless Eddie Ray, who stopped performing alongside Sam &amp; Dave just before
    they signed with Atlantic and started churning
    out hits under the guidance of Isaac Hayes.
    </p>
<p>
    Ray's three tracks here are bolstered by two demos in the
    ""Extended Play"" section of the disc, and his voice is the first thing that
    stands out-- he was right up there with the best Stax had to offer, including Sam
    &amp; Dave, gritty but melodic, and capable of powering his way over any
    backing track. His released singles, ""You Got Me"" and ""Glad I Found You"", were
    good, but it's the one that stayed on the shelf until now that's truly
    eye-opening. ""Wait a Minute"" is a breakneck stormer of a soul tune, draping a
    slow vocal melody over a whipping beat and billowing horns. I just get this
    picture of the drummer slowly melting into a salty puddle as the song
    progresses and he has to keep up this ridiculous rhythm. The horns alternate
    between jumping in the pocket created by the drums and playing against the
    rhythm with soft, open chords, and there's even a nasty psychedelic guitar part
    played by Joe King that crops up in the middle.
    </p>
<p>
    King got his own crack at record-making, and, despite
    preferring to remain in the background, he sings his ass off on his two solo
    tracks. Had he chosen to, he could have held his own with classic soul singers like Billy Paul and
    Al Wilson. His ""You're My Everything"" is a stunning slow jam, his
    own wah-wah-soaked guitar stoking his soaring vocal on to ever greater heights of
    passion. Elsewhere, an old Eccentric Soul friend resurfaces: Marion Black had
    one of my favorite Capsoul tracks with the masterful ""Who Knows"", and he nearly
    equals it on ""Listen, Black Brother"", a slow-burning ballad on which he spills
    out all of his frustration over black-on-black crime as a flute screams away in
    the bluesy, beaten-down backing track. Capsoul's Ronnie Taylor also returns,
    this time at the helm of instrumental funk band OFS Unlimited.
    </p>
<p>
    Prix had all the ingredients for success: talented lead
    performers, a stable of excellent backing musicians, solid financial backing
    and a studio of its own, and yet here we are three and a half decades, hearing
    some of this music for the first time, and most of the rest of it for what may
    as well be the first time. Like so many of its counterparts, the label simply
    petered out and dried up when success proved elusive, leaving behind a tiny but
    artistically memorable legacy that's thankfully been resuscitated years after
    it all went down. It's still worth hearing.

The legendary, bountifully bearded Lungfish leader's swift follow-up to last year's <em>Ancestral Songs</em> continues the earlier's outer-space crunk transmissions (see, especially, the earlier ""Are You of the Body"" and ""Time-Ship of the Demogorgon""), but on these ""psychic loops of praise,"" his ambled, chanting vocal raga's passed over for pure instrumentalism.</p><p>
    The six pieces are lo-fi stretches of piano drone (fingers, mallets, etc.) and banjos/guitars loaded with swift Eastern/Sun City scales, zoning static, eschatological subtexts, and spectral/emotional ambiance. Despite the absence of a sustained human voice or <em>Ancestral Songs</em>' apocalyptic incantations, bird chirps, incidental hums, and the hints of a bigger outdoors flesh-out Higgs' playing. Hell, 2005's jaw harp extravaganza <em>Magic Alphabet</em> was plenty full with even fewer puzzle pieces. Here ""Hems and Seams"" crams submerged jaw harp twang and simple, sharp, rat-a-tat percussion into a streaming haze; the opening mist of ""Cocoon on the Cross"" parts for a plaintive 11-minute guitar solo that sprouts craggy branches and speedy tributaries; ""Spectral Hues"" slips between whirring piano cuts, rapid taps, sustain, and Higgs' exhalations; the title track and sweltering ""Creation Moan"" birth sitars from raging, overloaded guitars.</p><p>
    Higgs only opens his mouth to breath, but <em>Atomic Yggdrasil</em> isn't without lyrics. As any proper druid with Wikipedia knows, in Norse mythology, Yggdrasil, aka the World Tree, connects the nine cosmological worlds. Fittingly, Higgs connects half a dozen songs to a gorgeous 48-page hardcover book depicting a series of his totemic paintings and acrostics-- which delineate themes he's intoned about in the past-- including a climactic centerfold with two facing emblems after which the order of art/word shifts.</p><p>
    After 20 years in Lungfish (plus earlier work with Reptile House) and his assorted side projects, it's fascinating to see Higgs traveling into such complex quarters with his solo material. (In terms of artists making the most of second or third-legs, he ranks with ex-Swan, current-Angel of Light Michael Gira.) As a continuum, it really feels like each dispatch depends on the others before and after it. <em>Atomic Yggdrasil</em> is truly heady stuff, but pair it with <em>Ancestral</em>'s talking songs for the strongest results and clearest path. Higgs himself nails it in the acrostic for ""music"": ""Mighty / Undulations / Synchronize / Into / Cosmoses.""</p></div>"|10442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10442-atomic-yggdrasil-tarot/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

AM! filtered folk, country, and reggae through the veneer of anthemic punk rock; with no rhythm section to speak of, their songs shot forward on the rough engine of Tom Gabel's voice and the headlong disorder of the band's ragtag instrumentation. They sounded, basically, like glorified spoken word pieces, set to a tune.  The band's refusal to do anything resembling a second take hit a kind of DIY nerve so precisely that within a few months of the record's emergence, it was on its way to becoming No Idea's all-time best-selling release.</p><p>
    This was in 2002. Within a year there were hundreds of bands that sounded like them (check the excellent Plan-It-X label) and skeptics gritted their teeth, recognized a trend when they saw one, and waited for things to pass.  Among these skeptics, it turned out, was the band itself.  Against Me! saw the end long before most of their fans did-- it didn't help that their most popular song, ""Baby, I'm an Anarchist!"", was exactly the novelty it appears to be--  and this fact might explain how they ended up, five years later, on a major label, with Butch Vig at the controls, and seeking their third or fourth or tenth new audience in as many years.</p><p>
    For a bunch of self-professed anarchists and DIY devotees, the jump to pop-punk haven and Warped Tour affiliate Fat Wreck Chords only a year after they'd talked thousands of kids into believing what they ostensibly did was about as a jarring and contradictory as it sounds.  Two records later, they finished the job of demolishing their own fans' newly learned anti-capitalist ethic by signing to Sire, after making an MTV video and a documentary about how extremely they were courted by besuited guys with way more money to burn than Fat Mike.  In a post indie-rock world where the Decemberists and Death Cab for Cutie and even Mastodon were cheered for making the major label leap, Against Me! became the first band of the 21st Century to actually succeed at selling out.</p><p>
    ""We can control the medium"" are the first words you hear listening to <em>New Wave</em>: ""We can control the context of presentation."" Fan expectations aside, Against Me! built their sound in reaction to big-chorus guitar-rock, and this track, ""New Wave"", is almost exactly that: big jangly chorus, vague topicality (""Come on and wash these shores away!""), vocal overdubs by the scores.  ""No signs of original thought in the mainstream,"" sings Gabel, and the anxiety is palpable.  It's also, as far as these things go, an immaculately stirring song, a sing-a-long on the first pass kind of confection.</p><p>
    This is comfortable territory on the Warped Tour axis, Against Me!'s adopted home.  ""Trash Unreal"" is a Rancid-esque ode about a girl who gets mixed up with the wrong drugs and the wrong guys and the wrong crowd, dances to ""Rebel Yell,"" ages out of the scene, and wakes up a thirty-something junkie.  ""Americans Abroad"" is an anti- cultural imperialism anthem. Tegan of Tegan and Sara guests on ""Borne on the FM Waves of the Heart"", an emo duet. ""White People for Peace"" concerns the desire of white people for peace; it's also the first single, and with its ""protest songs"" refrain you'd have to be a pretty lousy guy not to like it.  These are longstanding punk tropes boiled down and Vig-ed up, removed of their typical dirt sheen and bolstered by a couple extra guitar tracks.</p><p>
    Of course, the need to <em>say something</em> is a double-edged sword at this level, where Gabel's tasked with ways of making his standard stiff and excessive syllables-- ""East and West could not agree, so their Generals gave call and gathered troops at the border""-- sound like something you'd buy a ticket to see.  Earnest self-importance of the Bad Religion school rear-ends latter day Green Day we-are-the-worlditude, and the next thing you know you're shouting ""civilian casualties had been a cost that was predetermined/when interviewed for report victims pleaded in frustration"" and wondering what the hell happened.  </p><p>
    For one thing, who even knows to whom this band is speaking anymore?  ""Up the Cuts"", an agonized look at the failing record industry, is a song nobody thought Against Me! would write.  ""All the insiders rumor over the decline in sales, all the buzz is happening in the new digital marketplace"" Gabel sings, or tries to anyway, and one feels for him.  ""In MRR, someone asks the question...is the culture now a product that's disposable?"" Gabel asks, and on the lyric sheet, though not in the song, ""MRR"" is followed by a parenthesis: (Maximum Rock and Roll).  Against Me! have come a long way indeed, when they need to explain to their audience what they mean by that acronym.  And where they've arrived at, even they don't know.  As Gabel sings, finishing the track: ""All the punks still singing the same song, is there anybody thinking what I am?  Is there any other alternative?  Are you restless like me?""</p></div>"|10443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10443-new-wave/|5.5|Zach Baron

    Los Campesinos! aren't the first act to make a name for
    themselves on MySpace. They may, however, be one of the first guitar
    groups in the UK
    who really <em>sound like</em> products of Web
    2.0. The artists they idolize-- Pavement, Broken Social Scene, Yo La Tengo,
    Deerhoof, Destroyer-- are bands feverishly championed in blogs and online zines
    (yes, including Pitchfork), not the latest batch of tabloid-friendly lads who only
    listen to Oasis or the Clash. ""It's sad that you think that we're all just
    scenesters,"" Gareth Campesino! chimes in on MySpace hit ""You! Me!
    Dancing!"", then adds, ""Even if we were, it's not the scene you're
    thinking."" He's probably right.<br/></p><p>
    As it usually goes in the MySpace era, most of the songs on
    the young septet's jangly debut EP may already be familiar to you. Produced
    by one of the band's heroes, Broken Social Scene's David Newfeld, <em>Sticking Fingers Into Sockets</em> includes:
    (1) debut single ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/41379-los-campesinos-we-throw-parties-you-throw-knives-bw-dont-tell-me-to-do-the-maths"">We

    Tell Me to Do the Math(s)</a></strong>""; (3) the second single, a re-recorded
    ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/43366-los-campesinos-you-me-dancing"">You!
    Me! Dancing!</a></strong>""; (4) flip-side ""<strong><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/loscampesinos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It Started With a Mixx</a></strong>"";
    and (5) a cover of <em>Watery, Domestic</em>'s ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/forkcast/43044-los-campesinos-frontwards-pavement-cover-stream-we-throw-parties-you-throw-knives-video"">Frontwards</a></strong>"" that has the contagious enthusiasm of a first-rate music blogger. The only track on
    the EP you couldn't (legally) hear for free right now until recently was 30-second throwaway
    ""Clunk-Rewind-Clunk-Play-Clunk"", but now even that's <a href=""http://spinner.aol.com/artists/new-releases-full-cds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>streaming</strong></a>. And two respected indie labels
    expect people to <em>buy</em> this disc.</p><p>
    You might even want to. Silly names aside, Los Campesinos! play
    superbly crafted indie pop that bounces off walls like Love Is All, grins
    with the childlike exuberance of Bis, and throws the
    toy chest into its arrangements like Architecture in Helsinki. Glockenspiels and pizzicato violin
    veer into reckless guitar riffs and full-bodied handclaps-- or fizz over, like
    Mentos and Coke, into happy-stupid crescendos. Gareth shares lead vocal duties
    with the similarly pseudonymous Aleksandra Campesino!, and their boy-girl
    exchanges give the music an extra, sweet frisson. Newfeld's treatment turns
    ""You! Me! Dancing!"" from a lo-fi rallying cry into an unstoppable
    force for converting spindly legs into dancefloor blurs.
    </p>
<p>
    Some music should not be
    enjoyed sitting down in front of a computer.
    </p>
<p>
    Beneath all the exclamation points, Los Campesinos! sneak in
    charming lyrics that range from the everyday to the absurd. In the tradition of
    mixtape songs since Bow Wow Wow's ""C30, C60, C90, Go!"", the band's
    ""It Started With a Mixx"" finds Gareth ""trying to find the
    perfect match between pretentious and pop."" While the Lesley
    Gore-referencing ""We Throw Parties, You Throw Knives"" could be
    anything from a political statement to another assault against lunkheaded
    Libertines wannabes, ""Don't Tell Me to Do the Math(s)"" imagines bookworms
    gone wild, spewing potential MySpace quotes: ""Don't read Jane Eyre!"" or the too-clever ""I will throw you high-fives if you keep your own secrets!"" You actually don't need ""Clunk-Rewind-Clunk-Play-Clunk""-- a tease with more shouts, glockenspiels, and vitamin-gobbling guitar
    hooks, but, most importantly for this paragraph, no real lyrics.

    ""Arctic Monkeys were an end,"" Simon Taylor-Thomas
    of UK
    dance-rockers Klaxons <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/42986-interview-klaxons"">told
    Pitchfork</a></strong>, suggesting the Arctics
    are simply the best of a knackered bunch. They may have been made huge
    by MySpace, but they're also an example of the UK
    press giving the kids what they <em>thought</em> the kids should want; <em>NME</em> editor Conor McNicholas famously
    described his target reader as a 17-year-old who hates being stuck in Doncaster. The promise of the internet, however, is that
    no one is stuck. Los Campesinos! came up worshiping bands from America and
    Canada, and young people as far away as Chicago have posted YouTube videos of
    themselves dancing to ""You! Me! Dancing!"" As the song comes apart,
    like a roomful of revelers when the lights go on, Gareth falls into a speaking
    voice that recalls Scotland's
    Ballboy: ""We're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're
    happy."" And if your friends don't dance, then they ain't no
    friends of mine.

Those lines open Lou Barlow's wonderfully warbled love ballad ""Soulmate""-- on which, in less than two minutes, the gently tapping troubadour collapses into a hyper-strummed folk implosion. It's what I remembered most from Sebadoh's <i>The Freed Man</i>. I played the cassette version obsessively when it was released by Homestead; until recently, I hadn't heard it in close to a decade. It's weird what you forget.</p>
<p>When the expanded reissue of Sebadoh's debut outing arrived on the doorstep, I dug through the boxes in my closet containing seriously musty Shrimper, Union Pole, Search For Terrestrial Intelligence, Eldest Son, and Catsup Plate cassettes. Beside two coffee-stained copies of Sentridoh's <i>Lou B's Wasted Pieces '87-'93</i>, I uncovered a very worn <i>The Freed Man</i> Homestead original. The newbie has the same photo of Barlow and Eric Gaffney smiling and waving on the front. Listening to the oldie beside this expanded edition, though, is an entirely different experience.</p>
<p>For starters, Lou and Eric's original pre-Homestead cassette has more than doubled in length. That first version is an incredibly rare self-released edition of 25 or so copies -- 30 minutes with two 15-minute sides, as Gaffney told me via email. He explained, ""I duped copies and sold those at Main Street Records, Northampton, MA for $1.00 in a box I made with Dr. Seuss art."" I have the Homestead cassette (32 songs), but was too cheap to splurge on the Homestead vinyl (which Gaffney told me was ""muddy, botched, redone a 2nd time""). It's kind of like detective work piecing together all these drafts. Gaffney noted that this new 52-song reissue is actually the fourth version: ""The reissue contains songs and versions (one each, not multiple) from the orignal cassette release... from the LP version [i.e. the Homestead version], a few of my songs, re-recorded, off <i>The Freed Weed</i> CD, and unreleased tracks, along with the 2nd and 3rd 'singles' and part of the first split."" Got it? Probably not. Whatever the math, the extras and different mixes/takes shift something once familiar into a gargantuan 79-minute lo-fi opera. It's fascinating from an archival standpoint, and I love that Gaffney painstakingly organized a brand new collage.</p>
<p>This <i>Freed Man</i> is overstuffed and weird, studded with some duds, and entirely fitting. Part of the joy of early Sebadoh-- this collection through <i>Bubble and Scrape</i>, aka the Gaffney years-- is the clash of egos and brilliant songwriters. It's totally evident on this new version: 25 songs by Lou, 25 by Eric, and two covers, including a garage-punk take on the Beatles ""Yellow Submarine"". Pretty telling, right? To take it even further, the cassette was re-mastered at Abbey Road Studios.</p>
<p>It's a lot of fun reading the separate notes provided by each player and figuring out the different histories. Gaffney's liners provide background about the record and trivia about his songs. Barlow's are briefer, but still historical: He mentions his favorite song of the bunch (""Jealous Evil""), and includes the totally dead-on statement that ""this record was intended to be a mess, a stinking garden of delights."" Hence the swamp-side photo on the cover (also mentioned by Barlow). Contextual shit aside, it's just great to hear Lou's downer folk countered by Eric's noise-punk-- that massive push and pull.</p>
<p>Fittingly, random feedback invades even the album's prettiest ballads. Chaotic cut-and-paste cassette noise tramples ambling pop songs. Fragments are held together by 4-track tape experiments, thorny acoustic bits, psychedelic hardcore, samples of television and family time. After Gaffney left, the band felt emasculated and boring, so for a fan of the old shit, this is a rare treat. I remember certain days as a kid fast-forwarding through some of the noisier pieces to get to ""Soulmate"", Barlow's gently tapping ""True Hardcore"" (""True hardcore is forever young""), and ""Healthy Sick"", or cringing at the dorky ""Lou Rap."" Other days you stuck to Gaffney's amazing fuzzcore, like the bottomed out, phased ""Nest"".</p>
<p>In the extras it's amazing to find skeletons: The patterns of ""Elements"" reborn as <i>III</i>'s manic finale, ""As the World Dies the Eyes of God Grow Bigger"". Or to remember the things that were there all along like the forgotten brass on ""Punch in the Nose"", the crazed screaming and bleeding sounds turning into the harmonizing pop nugget, ""K-Sensa-My"" (Barlow, '86). So many new discoveries, too: ""Oak Street Raga"", ""Dance,"" ""Fire of July"", ""Jaundice"", ""The Lorax"". The earliest material is Barlow circa 1984 (""Pig"", not yet freed) and the newest, a live version of Gaffney's ""Attention"" (Hadley, MA, 1990).</p>
<p>Of course, the irony of releasing <i>The Freed Man</i> <i>now</i> is pretty huge. The title was partly a response to Barlow's recent freedom from Dinosaur and his control-freak nemesis, J Mascis (his thoughts, not mine). At this point he's not only back with Dinosaur J, they managed to record a new record. It sounds great, sure, but it's divorced from the time that made it essential. This shit, though, is so of its time and place. It's necessary for anyone who prefers the Mountain Goats on cassette or likes noise with their morning breakfast and summertime poetry. It breathes gorgeous dope-smoking breaths all over the place. (Crazy to remember this was going on alongside <i>Dinosaur</i>, <i>You're Living All Over Me</i>, <i>Bug</i>...all so amazing, but so amazingly different).</p>
<p>Okay, before listening, consider this set-up: A DJ and zine editor who delivers pizza for the Pizza Factory and collaborates with the late Charles Ondras (who went on to become Unsane's amazing drummer, RIP) joins his Sentridoh pal, Dinosaur's bassist, who comes armed with a cheap, parent-purchased 4-track. The two start smoking pot (""things sounded better slow...""), experimenting, feeling giddy with the results. This is a history I actually care about. It's gorgeous on so many levels.</p></div>"|10448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10448-the-freed-man/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

    One night not long ago, lying in bed and listening to the September Collective's mesmerizing new album <em>All the Birds Were Anarchists</em>,
    the image of a snowglobe filled with swirling flecks of gold leaf
    flashed into my mind, at which point my mental camera slowly zoomed out
    to reveal the orb sitting on a shiny black grand piano, surrounded by
    velvet curtains even blacker than the lacquer on the Steinway. It was
    only one of a thousand such images I've enjoyed while listening to <em>All the Birds</em>
    over and over and over these past few months. Should you listen to the
    disc-- and I urge you to-- you will doubtlessly have wildly different
    visions, but I promise you that you will see <em>something</em>. It simply is that kind of record.</p><p>
    September Collective is the trio of Barbara Morgenstern, Stefan
    Schneider, and Paul Wirkus. If you know any of those names you'll have
    some idea of what to expect, as each artist's voice rings through true
    and clear. Morgenstern has recorded a number of releases, principally
    for Monika Enterprise and Leaf, featuring her pellucid voice and
    delicate arrangements of piano and synthesizer that convey a drifting pop
    sensibility, in the broadest possible sense. Stefan Schneider is best
    known as a member of To Rococo Rot and for his solo work as the ambient
    dub outfit Mapstation. And Paul Wirkus is an improvising laptop artist
    working with a library of chamber music samples and a small kit of
    analog synthesizers and effects. The group says that the project was
    born out of a shared 2002 tour in which each artist had solo billing.
    ""After we played our sets we found it senseless to end up a concert
    just like this and we started to improvise in the end of our show,""
    writes the group in its bio. ""Although everyone of us works with loops
    and computers it worked out perfectly. So we continued after this tour
    and founded September Collective-- a project which is based on
    improvisation and trying out new things.""</p><p>
    Their nonchalant, even naïve approach to group dynamics is all over <em>All the Birds</em>,
    but they're no dabblers: The album offers an engrossing and profoundly
    confident mélange of styles and timbres. Two levels predominate: one an
    improvisational scrim of shirred textures and intermittent sequining
    via brilliant sonic details, and the other a more robust structure of
    composed melody and songcraft. The two run parallel throughout the
    disc, swapping places and playing games, both within individual songs
    and throughout the album's entire arc.
    </p>
<p>
    The first track, ""Out of Intention"", opens with a whir of out-of-time
    loops: cardiac thuds, insect skitter, intermittent hi-hats, a dusky
    blue unfolding that might once have been a keyboard, or maybe a
    saxophone. A rudimentary bass line enters, shrugging its shoulders, and
    a delicate counterpoint blossoms in the piano's treble register. Far in
    the back, an unadorned drum machine keeps time-- with its MIDI cables
    apparently disconnected. (I love the way September Collective
    appropriates dance music's most basic tool to use pedestrian sounds in
    mercurial ways.) Against this nodding pulse, Morgenstern embroiders
    free, filigreed piano riffs that hang just this side of George
    Winston's property line before disappearing in the whir of Oval's hard
    drive. Beginning in the same shimmering approximation of key, ""Das
    Meer"" (""The Sea"") muddles its loops into an arrhythmic whirlpool. An
    electronic sound like a bassoon, a higher muted reed line, and an almost
    imperceptible Rhodes fuse into an inseparable three-part structure that
    sounds uncannily like something from Talk Talk's <em>Laughing Stock</em>.
    Haphazardly brushed drums suggest that everything could fall apart at
    any second-- until that piano returns, almost certainly Morgenstern's,
    stitching everything lovingly back together. From chaos, pop--
    and in a rush of hummingbird's wings and fingered stemware, it all
    dissolves back into ether again-- again, a whole lot like late period
    Talk Talk.
    </p>
<p>
    And that's just the record's first 10 minutes. ""Natura"", opening with
    looped and fizzed piano reverb, finds the players staking out their
    spaces in a three-cornered room, with what sounds like Morgenstern
    drifting into a melodic right-hand reverie, Schneider laying down
    dub-inspired sub-bass and melodica, and Wirkus doing his damnedest to
    untether his colleagues' steadfast mooring, letting a loop of
    close-miked piano clatter go flapping into the red. The same trick
    appears three tracks later, on ""Pausenband"", suggesting a box of ghosts
    hell-bent on breaking the locks, while the clacking percussion of ""Our
    Cat"" leads seamlessly into ""Essentially Unchanged"", where it plays
    out-- yes, essentially unchanged-- beneath limpid keyboards. Such
    recycled loops and recurring themes, far from suggesting meager
    hard-drive holdings, help not only to bind the record tightly together,
    but also to weave it into your very consciousness. I suspect that's one
    of the main reasons <em>All the Birds</em>
    has become one of my preferred bedtime listens of late. It's not simply
    that the record's palette is generally subdued and, well, mellow; but
    when the body is at rest and the brain slipping into hypnagogic drift,
    that's precisely when September Collective's quiet anarchy reassembles
    itself into such improbable, impossibly beautiful forms. Sometimes,
    it's better when music doesn't make sense, but like the iconography of
    dreams, simply runs free, making its own haphazard associations as it
    goes.

This is training."" Because practice is what bands do to stop sucking, and if Excepter stopped sucking in the vernacular sense, they'd also stop being interesting. Excepter have made an art out of never actually playing a song, and in the interim, sort of turning around and facing the possibility of a song, sniffing it, chewing it, and throwing up on it. Practice implies a goal, and if Excepter has one, it's to never let sound capitulate into coherent music.</p><p>
    So, training. Training takes place in a vacuum-- it's for athletes or soldiers whose terrain hasn't been fully revealed. Excepter's sterling history of reluctance and success in not playing a single pleasant note is captured, in jumbled time-lapse phonography, on <em>Streams</em>, a two-disc set distilling 30-odd hours of 36 podcasts the band recorded and released for free between 2003 and 2006.</p><p>
    Give the title room to breathe and it's a pun on at least three levels-- streaming audio, water's perpetual motion, and Excepter's own stream of consciousness. And yet, <em>Streams</em> reveals an evolution of impetus: Excepter's soft, queasy abstractions have drifted further from the model of electro-acoustic improv set forth by tribes like the No-Neck Blues Band (who used to count Excepter's John Fell Ryan as a member) to something more rhythm-based, influenced by reggae's casual bounce and a corrosive, amateurish take on dub. 2005's <em>Self Destruction</em> was even pitched as a ""house record,"" which it wasn't, unless dancing requires a concussion. The devastation Excepter has wrought is not only in being either the laziest and most intense band in America, or the most enchanting and most repulsive, but in transposing the noncommittal stoner gunk of drone and head music into something we're supposed to move to. As mouthpiece, Ryan has coalesced: Where he once moaned at nothing in particular, he's managed to forge a hybrid of Jamaican toaster, Jim Morrison, and a homeless man. And make it a comedy routine. Sort of.</p><p>
    But <em>Streams</em>, curated by superfan Robert Girardin (a task more trying than listening to Excepter or probably even being in Excepter), is only one person's perspective on the band's powers. The streams are still being <strong><a href=""http://www.excepter.podomatic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">consistently released</a></strong>; between those and last year's excellent <em>Alternation</em>, perspective travelers have better holes to fall in. Einstein said that ""the only reason for time is so everything doesn't happen at once,"" and I'm pretty sure he was anticipating <em>Streams</em>: for some bands, a compilation can be a gleaming sum; with Excepter, it feels better-- worse, sicker, more disorienting, in this case-- to be mired in the bog, crawling to no certain light, training for the void.</p></div>"|10433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10433-streams/|7.1|Mike Powell

Klaxons, LCD Soundsystem, and Pissed Jeans lead the way in responsible nomenclature, giving listeners an accurate sense of what to expect from the music. But the majority of band names are either meaningless or blatantly misleading. We could dispense with two of the most egregious offenders right off the bat by having Germany's Tied &amp; Tickled Trio swap names with Australia's Architecture in Helsinki. The former's associations (giddy, quirky, spastic) attach seamlessly to AinH's disjointed pep-squad rock, while the latter's (stately, austere, glacial) handily summarize the sterile geometrical architecture Tied &amp; Tickled Trio erect on <em>Aelita</em>, a quickie album (recorded in a handful of days) that abandons the group's usual electronic jazz (no horns) in favor of mechanically exact, interstellar wallpaper.</p><p>
    Tied &amp; Tickled Trio's recordings generally begin in improvisation and end in careful arrangement, and <em>Aelita </em>is no exception, although you'd never know it from the music's rigor mortised strains. Unlike the group's excellent 2003 album <em>Observing Systems</em>, no trace of the moment's lyricism or joyous serendipity has survived the composition stage. Instead, heavy-handed ranks of xylophone, glockenspiel, and mellotron plod turgidly toward foregone conclusions, and the album feels like some quiet, remote place where dub and trip-hop slink off to die.</p><p>
    The three incarnations of ""Aelita"" are gauzy music-box minuets, variously obscured by mellotron hazes and ancillary harmonics. ""You Said Tomorrow Yesterday"" features a telegraphic rhythm track and Badalamentian chimes incrementally ramping up toward a post-apocalyptic shush. For bloggers, the following tags will be useful: Russia, sci-fi, 1920s. The brisk, splintery dub of ""Tamaghis"" is named for one of William Burroughs' Cities of the Red Night; the eerie ripples of ""Chlebnikov"" are an homage to Russian sound poet Velemir Chlebnikov, who died in 1922; the album's title might derive from Alexei Tolstoy's 1923 sci-fi novel about an expedition to Mars or the planned Soviet spacecraft named after it.
    </p><p>
    Given all of this movement, suspense, and heady atmosphere, the album's feeling of deep stagnancy is hard to fathom. Maybe <em>Aelita</em> does too good a job of capturing that ""arcing through endless space in an escape pod"" feeling, with its lugubrious pacing, constrained interplay, and limited palette: After the initial wonder wears off, the endlessness of space becomes rather dull. Maybe it's too monolithic in this mood of starry abstraction, which dominates every chamber of the album, and too inflexibly linear in its execution-- each song's dynamics ratchet up with such surgical precision that the listener begins to feel like a musical Nostradamus, able to predict with pinpoint accuracy when the drum track is about to sprout an extra shimmy or the xylophone fugue an extra kink.
    </p>
<p>
    Or maybe it's because we know, from previous Tied &amp; Tickled Trio albums, Lali Puna's lively electro-pop, and especially the Notwist's still-stunning <em>Neon Golden</em>, that Markus Acher &amp; co. are capable of doing more with less than they're doing here. At any rate, <em>Aelita</em> is perfect for art gallery openings, dinner parties, and scoring silent sci-fi films. But beyond its utility as a backdrop, it's an awfully cold, blank, and directionless void to trawl alone.

What's more discouraging is the slow realization that the music on <i>Death of the Sun</i> isn't even quite as intriguing as Baim's descriptive red herring implies. Instead, the first album from the non-CocoRosie half of Metallic Falcons continues with some of that project's more spacious and atmospheric lullabies, but relies too often on wispy songs and melodies that appear to evaporate before reaching the ground.</p>
<p>CocoRosie's Sierra Casady--Baim's befeathered cohort in Metallic Falcons--makes no appearance here, but several other artists from the duo's shared orbit make contributions, including Devendra Banhart, Jana Hunter, and Pit Er Pat's Rob Doran. As with the Falcons' mesmeric 2006 debut <i>Desert Doughnuts</i>, however, <i>Death of the Sun</i> seems to have far fewer fingerprints on it than it actually does. On these nine tracks, Baim frequently sets her rich, transfixing vocals adrift into an uncertain near-silence, with the assembled musicians playing their instruments so lightly it can seem as though they're attempting to not startle a skittish herd of antelope. Despite the album's brief 30-minute running length, this ethereal production and somnambulant performance leaves the listener with the unshakable impression that Baim simply didn't have enough top-shelf material to yet sustain a full-length album.</p>
<p>As it stands, <i>Death of the Sun</i> is two songs and nearly ten minutes finished before Baim conjures her first truly memorable melodic turn on ""Wounded Whale"", a hushed (natch) ecological lament that empties into the restrained psych-folk of the title track. Before the album can build upon this cautious momentum, Baim then digresses into a narcoleptic and completely superfluous version of the traditional ""Michael Row the Boat Ashore"", which is the type of performance that might work magic when actually gathered around the fire at a desert campsite-- maybe-- but almost certainly nowhere else. Baim recovers nicely with the spooky, flittering vocal harmonies of ""Seven Stars"" and ""Who Loves"", yet even these lovely pieces can seem half-finished and almost weightlessly ephemeral, their gauzy melodies always tantalizingly out of reach.</p>
<p>Baim and her group finally take the shackles off and turn the volume up slightly on the album closing ""Up is North"". Though it's still a far cry from grunge of any variant, the drums do at last provide a satisfying punch while reverberant acid guitar figures encircle Baim's wraith-like vocals, punctuating the album's submerged themes of loss and recovery. And while the moment lasts, <i>Death of the Sun </i>seems a valuable new refraction of the Metallic Falcons' ""soft metal"" soundscapes, one that perhaps can eventually inspire Matteah Baim to truly develop new genres worth naming.</p></div>"|10426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10426-death-of-the-sun/|5.5|Matthew Murphy

But Dreijer's crude palette of old-school electro/techno sounds managed to exert a feeling of anxiety all on their own, picking under the scab of never-ending 1980s retro-kitsch until pus bubbled up from underneath. Now a little more than a year later, Mute repackages the album with a DVD featuring a spectacle of a live performance from Stockholm in 2006, where the visual aesthetic mines a similar vein of nostalgia for the heebie-jeebies that out-of-date technology can induce, plus 11 music videos and an extra CD containing the audio track from said live performance. For those of us who bought the record the first time around, it's basically your chance to buy a new Knife DVD, and if you're a fan, it's pretty much worth owning two copies of the same CD.</p>
<p>The DVD, <i>Silent Shout: An Audio Visual Experience</i>, begins in an inky blankness broken by audience screams, as the emergency alarm bleeps and astringent arpeggios of ""Pass This On"" are slowly assembled. When the duo are finally revealed-- androgynous in what look like janitor's uniforms and bathed in cerulean light, with Olof jerking at his machinery and Karin pulling nervous mime moves-- they come off like a sinister cross between Devo's unsatisfied twitches and Daft Punk's studied roboticisms. Backed by exploding neon lights and arena-sized video projections, when Karin begins snapping her fingers and awkwardly swaying during ""You Make Me Like Charity"", she looks like an android go-go dancer or a space alien who has intercepted transmissions of late 80s episodes of ""Club MTV"". Even the human element of the Knife's performance feels artificial, some approximation of humanity knocked together by machines that's as intensely unnerving as their records.</p>
<p><i>An Audio Visual Experience</i> isn't so much a concert film as a 50-minute music video that's been extensively edited and tarted up after the fact, with enough quick cuts at jarring angles to feel as epileptic as the video games you can hear in the band's music. Orchestrated by Andreas Nilsson and Ossian Ekman, it's as decadent as cyberpunk Weimar cabaret. Rough-hewn digital imagery blurs into repurposed Super-8 home video, simple geometric paterns flare into life and spin across the screen like a perverted planetarium's laser light show, and throughout there's that pervasive unease. Like Boards of Canada with the queasiness cranked to 10, all those smudgy faces from someone else's home movies, pixilated effects from the days of 8-bit computers, and other visual tropes you half-remember from growing up mingle with the band's sour, often operatic black forest overhaul of synth-pop to radiate discomfort. <i>An Audio Visual Experience</i> isn't wholly successful; parts of it veer uncomfortably toward the feeling that you could be watching old Nine Inch Nails performances with the sepia-tinting replaced by deep blues and purples. But there are enough indelible images-- the Atari snowflakes that begin falling during ""Heartbeats"" for instance-- to give it more replay value than your average multi-angle concert film.</p>
<p>The 11 music videos (and one short film) included on the DVD have a broader range and a lighter touch than the concert's unrelenting Grand Guignol. Culled from across the band's discography, they flit from the whimsical domestic scene (literally) sketched out in ""N.Y. Hotel"", to more crude CGI and home movies for ""Heartbeats"", to a heavily eyeliner-ed take on ""You Take My Breath Away"" that would almost feel like a parody of 80s revivalism if the band didn't really sell those leather jackets with ostentatious shoulder pads. ""Handy Man"", with its hyperreal colors and talking hammers, likewise feels like a loving pisstake of the pounding cheese that Euro-pop has been crapping out for decades and that you can still see weekly in U.S. gay clubs, and the dancing skeletons of a second take on ""You Take My Breath Away"" are so bargain basement that they briefly made me nostalgic for those charmingly crappy ""psychedelic"" computer animations of early 90s rave videos.</p>
<p>And despite its forward-thinking rep, the Knife is clearly a pretty nostalgic band, too. As two twentysomething Swedes, these 80s and 90s visual signifiers are the broth their brains were boiled in while growing up. The siblings' enduring fascination with the evocative powers of primitive electronics, whether musical or visual, combined with the florid gothic streak that bloomed on <i>Silent Shout</i>, has resulted in a pretty rich stew. While the inclusion of the original album is superfluous and the second disc capturing the music of the live Stockholm performance is pointless, <i>Silent Shout Deluxe Edition</i> is worth picking up for its near pitch-perfect visual rendering of the band's appeal-- creepy but seductive images from the decade's most unexpected purveyors of bad dreams.</p></div>"|10439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10439-silent-shout-deluxe-edition/|8.0|Jess Harvell

But instead of distancing the Yorkshire trio from the striped-shirt/black-jeaned plebes, it left you wondering: If these guys hate the scene so much, why do they seem so eager to join it by giving themselves a just-another-The-band name and pumping out standard-issue student-disco fare? That the band namedrop indie iconoclasts like Calvin Johnson and Bobby Conn in their bio while sounding like their record collection begins with <em>Is This It</em> and ends with <em>Up the Bracket</em> only makes the gesture seem more misguided.</p><p>
    Well the lads are nothing if not tenacious, opening their new album with another meta-missive-- albeit this one's directed at the herd-like masses. But the smug self-satisfaction of ""Hey Scenesters!"" has been displaced by the more sobering realization that the only way to rise above indie insularity is ""to impress our bovine public."" And so <em>Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever</em> spares no expense in making sure the cows come home: The Cribs' major-label debut was helmed by Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos (who assumes the famous-Scottish-producer role filled by Edwyn Collins on 2005's <em>The New Fellas</em>), mixed by alt-rock heavyweight Andy Wallace, and features perhaps the unlikeliest indie-celeb cameo since Laetitia Sadier showed up on a Common album.</p><p>
    But all the marquee names in the world wouldn't mean a thing if the Cribs didn't step up in the songwriting department, and the trio answer Kapranos' ready-for-prime-time production with chart-gazing tunes. In contrast to <em>The New Fellas</em>' rough-sketch pub-rock slop, there's a marked increase in passion and precision-- it would appear Kapranos has taught frontman Ryan Jarman a thing or two about projecting his voice to the back rows. Opening trifecta ""Our Bovine Public"", ""Girls Like Mystery"", and ""Men's Needs"" charge out of the gate brandishing a familiar arsenal of morse-code guitar riffs, new-waved drumbeats and thick-accented shout-speak, but like the Futureheads on their first album (and unlike the Futureheads on their second), the Cribs have found a way to translate their twitchy tension into compact, exciting pop songs where the  bridges are sturdy enough to be choruses.</p><p>
    Though ""Men's Needs"" is answered later on by the Pixies-pinching ""Women's Needs"", the ""Whatever"" in the album title ultimately sums up the half-hearted attempt at conceptual narrative. And that's probably for the best, as the Cribs don't provide any probing insights into the mysteries of gender politics (in case you haven't heard: men are selfish pricks). And besides, Jarman's more charismatic when pointing the finger at himself: ""I'm a realist/ I'm a romantic,"" he sings on ""I'm a Realist"", before drawing attention to that admission's inherent contradiction: ""I'm an indecisive piece of shit.""</p><p>
    But the lyrics are ultimately secondary to the album's spirited momentum, which maintains a steady clip until being derailed by the late-game curveball of ""Be Safe"", featuring a surprising, spoken-word appearance from Lee Ranaldo (though his past production work with You Am I suggests a certain soft spot for fledgling power-pop bands). But rather than running wild with his patented sci-fi/beat-poet spiel, Ranaldo narrates this lugubrious power ballad with a trite, anti-consumerist screed that could've been ripped straight from the diary of one of the Cribs' more depressed 16-year-old fans; Jarman's climactic, emo-kid chorus confirms the song's status as a second-rate knock-off of Nada Surf's ""Popular"". It's an unnecessary incongruity on a record that had already done well to fulfill its loftier ambitions, and the Cribs seem to know it-- is it a coincidence that the album closes with a humbling acoustic ballad called ""Shoot the Poets""?</p></div>"|10438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10438-mens-needs-womens-needs-whatever/|6.7|Stuart Berman

    Sufjan Stevens, Lee Ranaldo, Devendra Banhart, Howe Gelb, Calexico, and a half-dozen others will forever be linked through the waste that is <em>I Am the Resurrection</em>, the 2006 tribute to late, great guitarist and composer John Fahey produced by M. Ward and Steve Brower. <em>I Am the Resurrection</em> is the first of four Fahey tributes released in the last 16 months, and, with the biggest names and the most opportunity to expose a new crowd to the man's work, it's the biggest failure. Sure, it's good-hearted enough, and some of the covers-- Banhart's cloudy, menacing spin on ""Sligo River Blues"" and Howe Gelb's clunky, grinning piano interpretation of ""My Grandfather's Clock""-- are convincing. But to think that <em>I Am the Resurrection</em>'s alternately self-involved (Stevens) or irreverently unimaginative (Peter Case) interpretations gave newcomers invalid impressions of Fahey's catalogue is, really, a bit frightening.</p><p>
    If <em>Resurrection</em> is the first and worst tribute to Fahey released since his 2001 death, <em>The Great Koonaklaster Speaks</em> is the newest and best, the clearest and most brazen picture of the onus and inspiration Fahey has left for modern music. Importantly, this is a tribute record, but it's not a covers record: Instead, it collects unreleased work from 11 current experimental acts that feel Fahey's influence and attempt to offer a glimpse of it here. Alternately humorous, solemn, grounded, and neoteric, the rangy work on <em>Koonaklaster</em> asserts that Fahey wasn't perfect or filtered, and that his legacy is at once challenging and lifting. It's not about critical doublespeak or who can pick the best six-string. Instead, its liner notes are a fictional mythology of Fahey's life written in his style, and the playing recasts the characteristics that fired his legacy. Bravo.</p><p>
<em>Koonaklaster</em> wastes no time: Jack Rose-- who appeared on one of <em>Resurrection</em>'s better moments with Pelt-- opens with ""Since I've Been a Full Grown Man"", an 11-minute lament painted in layered motion by Rose's steel-on-steel slide moans dotted by the wonderfully expressive, wide chords Fahey wrangled so well. Rose is a guitarist of the highest order, and, from Fahey, he's not only borrowed technique but also extreme gravitas. Fahey once said, ""I can make syncopation sound like death""; ""Since I've Been a Full Grown Man"", then, is an ample weight for new shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
    The disc's other bookend, a 12-minute closing piece in three parts from David Daniell, embodies the seeking, hybridizing nature of Fahey's best work. As a young guitarist, Fahey treated classical music, blues, country &amp; western 78s, and pop fare as one body of music and attempted to feed it all through six steel strings. Later in life, Fahey married new interests in musique concrète and slower, almost droning pieces with this well-established, polyglot dexterity. Daniell gets this right with guitar motifs at the top and bottom, but-- between those poles-- the piece grinds through six minutes of menacing noise and drone. In doing so, Daniell encapsulates the best qualities of several other <em>Koonaklaster</em> contributions, like the loping comfort in music that Greg Malcolm references or the range of feeling that Ben Vida's theme-and-variation approach intimates. It speaks well of Fahey and those who've studied his moves.
    </p>
<p>
    In these sorts of tributes, the artist baking in the spotlight of reverence is often parched of his personality: Fahey wasn't entirely morose or stoic, despite having Blind Joe Death as an alter ego. His collection of essays and short fictions, <em>How Bluegrass Music Destroyed My Life</em>, spills over with tiny jokes about the eternal war between cars and turtles; during the live set <em>The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick</em>, he laughs with delight after a fawning crowd cheers as he blows his nose. Pumice communicate hints of this levity with ""Ceremonial Knives"", a simple, repetitive figure beset by noise-makers and toy keyboards, their agility poking fun at the slow-moving guitar. In a more subtle move, Lichens-- who surprises with one of the best, most thoughtful tracks here-- begins with a beautiful, perfectly-paced acoustic, slowly peeling the guitar away to fill its void with a humming drone based on the tonic note. Later, flickers of the guitar dance around the pure tone, winking at it, teasing its unflinching devotion.
    </p>
<p>
    Fahey wasn't a strict perfectionist, either. There was always a human risk (and sometimes error) involved in his music, and <em>Koonaklaster</em> communicates that as well. Near collection's end, Kentucky disciple R. Keenan Lawler fusses with time, tone, and tuning as he plays his resonator guitar, the overrunning phrases and uncertain rhythmic shifts communicating the challenges and rewards Fahey, his heroes, and his followers face by refusing to play too much too straight. It's a piece with personality, warts and quirks embedded among immense skill and imagination. After all, ""Fahey formed his vernacular through recordings,"" writes Nick Schillace, a Fahey student not included here, in his master's thesis, ""John Fahey and American Primitivism"". ""He took his basic technique and created an idiosyncratic cultivated style."" He didn't do it necessarily so that others could do the same. But <em>Koonaklaster</em>, at last a mighty tribute to a worthy subject, proves that he might as well have.<br/>

    Though we'll be getting under the hood and taking a look at some individual tracks on these Portland, Oregon instrumentalists' newest dose of chakra-realigning rock-- their third full-length, not counting a bunch of EPs and 12-inches-- there really ain't much of a need. Not because these densely packed astral-traveling psych- and Arabic-spiced jams aren't worthy, but because the Grails craft sprawling long players to be digested in one long gobble, much like the old-school lava-lamp-dripping and incense-burning albums of yesteryear. Songs subtly and dynamically build, flow, spiral, and explode-- following a similar formula as the band's most-likely signature influence Godspeed You! Black Emperor-- but unless one is paying close attention and is able to fight off the warm and fuzzy mistiness, one is unlikely to notice when the seven-minute-long tunes morph into a new jam. It's all about the LP, the kaleidoscope-turning ride-- and in this age of digital music, you don't even have to get up outta the beanbag to flip the side!</p><p>
    If they haven't already, as the most excellent opening track, ""Soft Temple"" signifies, Grails really need to do soundtracks: light tribal drums introduce a Middle Eastern-sounding something-or-other (sounds like a banjo, but probably ain't) that gets hazed out by random percussion clouds and swirling guitar vapors; things chill in the opium den for awhile until galloping drums and a triumphant, melodic electric six-string signals the charge for higher ground. Another track to riff on world music modalities is the stormy, and-- gotta say it again, quite GY!BE-y-- ""Silk Rd"" that bellows out Indian drone (most likely from a sruti box) with serpentine sitar lines and electric axes that once again swell into an epic, tide-is-turning attack. Both numbers are totally cinematic, smartly layered, and quite unusual in that-- as California public radio station KFJC once perfectly coined-- ""Tibetan crime jazz"" sorta way.</p><p>
    Keeping up the wide-screen vista themes, I'm guessing the Grails are intentionally aiming for such highly visual and ambient fare, but most notably because several pieces seem to vibe film score maestro Ennio Morricone. There's the title track, where piano and sun-drenched desert standoff guitars flip between the Western and the Middle-Eastern and then hit a crescendo with Bolero-blazing Spanish horns and <em>Zeppelin III</em> folky fretboard jangles. Or ""Origin-ing"", once again, tumbleweed-rolling via spaghetti-western accents and harmonica, but sounding like Morricone signed on one of the several atmospheric hovercraft rockers found on the Temporary Residence roster (Mono, Explosions in the Sky, Envy) for super-charged pick-me ups. Fans of Mogwai, Grails collaborators Red Sparowes, and the whole mostly non-metallic side of the instrumental-gaze school should freak on <em>Burning Off Impurities</em>, but considering their high-minded (both meanings) multi-instrumentation and multi-cultural scope, this Portland five-piece just may be the best, or at least most novel.</p></div>"|10425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10425-burning-off-impurities/|7.7|D.

The band's crooked path to alternative rock almost-stardom is well-documented, but their stylistic singularity and influence still remain largely underacknowledged.  No other records before or since sound exactly like <em>II</em> or <em>Up on the Sun</em>; hazy and laid back but staggeringly tight and impeccably arranged.  Guitarist Curt Kirkwood's intricate, handpicked style can be heard today in the multilayered playing of Oxford Collapse's Mike Pace, among many others.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the Meat Puppets have been best known as of late for the tragic misadventures of erstwhile Kirkwood brother Cris.  The fact that this record was made at all is pretty amazing; the fact that it's not half bad even more so.  The Meat Puppets have never been a band to stray too far from what they do best; with the exception of the sea change between their eponymous debut and their masterpiece <em>II</em>, the band's stylistic development has been gradual, sometimes to the point of stagnation.  <em>Rise to Your Knees</em> strikes a fairly comfortable balance between the spare, spritely Meat Puppets of yore and the more polished and forceful Meat Puppets of the mid-1990s.</p><p>
    The most pleasing moments on <em>Rise to Your Knees</em> often arise from the simple charm of its melodies; the instrumentation here is far from the propulsive intricacy of the Puppets' best work.  Generally speaking, the choruses on <em>Rise</em> far outshine the meandering verses, as the band snaps into a more simple and straightforward groove that highlights the trademark Kirkwood drawl.  And sure enough, time has proven surprisingly flattering to the brothers' voices, which come through rich and satisfying throughout.  By the first chorus of standout track ""On the Rise"", it's clear that the Puppets' charms have remained intact, even if their new songs come up a bit short.</p><p>
    With the exception of the baffling 311-esque ""Enemy Love Song"", there are very clunkers to be found here.  On songs like the excellent ""Disappear"", the brothers Kirkwood actually find their way back some of the tight and propulsive guitar and bass interplay that marks the Puppets' best work.  For the most part, though, the songs on <em>Rise</em> are hazy and unremarkable. As with most of the Meat Puppets' lesser records, this one is easy to space out to-- all dense harmonies, psychedelic guitars and unwavering drum beats-- but often fails to really capitalize on the band's unique strengths.</p><p>
    As was the case with Dinosaur Jr's recent <em>Beyond</em>, <em>Rise to Your Knees</em> is an interesting reminder that the specific musical thread started by this band hasn't been fully picked up since; though a far cry from their strongest records, <em>Rise</em> finds the Meat Puppets thereofre sounding somewhat fresh.  It follows, then, that this doesn't quite come off as a ""comeback"" album, but rather a middling addition to a prolific and distinctive catalog.  As the title suggests, <em>Rise to Your Knees</em> isn't so much a glorious resurgence as a humble but definitive step towards recovery.<br/></p></div>"|10440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10440-rise-to-your-knees/|6.5|Matt LeMay

    Somehow, despite shilling hand-me-down post-punk in platinum-selling
    quantities to both Europe and the U.S., Birmingham's Editors have kept
    a low profile throughout indie's revivalist witch hunt. While the mere
    mention of the Killers, Kaiser Chiefs, or the Bravery incites your average
    post-punk/New Wave purists to grab their torches and pitchforks (pun
    intended), Editors' widespread fame and genre piggybacking is often met
    with a sigh and shrugged shoulders, an odd moment of
    tolerance and civility amidst the <em>Lord of the Flies</em> behavioral patterns exhibited towards their contemporaries.</p><p>
    So I insert <em>An End Has a Start</em> into my computer, ready to
    expose their failings to cyberspace,
    pausing only to giggle at the LP's cornball title, when a funny thing
    happens: their songs don't totally suck. Like their debut <em>The Back Room</em>,
    the band's sophomore effort gets good mileage out of worn-out ideas,
    hoping to fiddle with heartstrings effectively enough to distract
    listeners from its myriad shortcomings. Frontman Tom Smith still
    channels Ian Curtis' dour spirit pretty shamelessly, but on songs
    like ""Bones"" or the title track he manages the occasional hook to
    raise up the crumbling wall of sound erected by his bandmates.</p><p>
    A theatrical streak runs through <em>An End</em>,
    and it's about the only distinguishing quality between their two
    albums-- a pretty amazing feat considering how bloated Editors
    already sounded on <em>The Back Room</em>. If Smith could dislodge the
    frog in his throat, he'd be a dead ringer for Bono on life-affirming
    motivational numbers like ""Push Your Head Towards the Air"" and single
    ""Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors"", a stark contrast to their more
    fidgety (and less wordy) previous singles ""Bullets"" and ""Munich"". 
    </p>
<p>
    If only the band could better foster the instrumental bite heard in
    ""Escape the Nest""'s stratospheric guitar riff or the ""I Will
    Follow""-inspired lick that kicks off ""Bones"", the heaps of sap would be
    easier to stomach. Instead, Smith's emoting tells but doesn't show,
    eschewing the impressionism of his favorite bands
    in favor of protracted ballads and heart-on-sleeve lyrics crammed
    asses-to-elbows in choruses too small to hold them. On ""The Weight of
    the World"", perhaps the album's histrionic pinnacle, Smith resorts to
    the sort of sweet nothings found in a prom's closing song: ""There are
    tears in my eyes/ Love replaces fear/ Every little piece in your life/
    Will add up to one/ Every little piece in your life/ Will mean
    something to someone.""
    </p>
<p>
    It's a shame that premature commercial success has sullied Editors' creativity, because <em>An End</em>
    contains its share of bright spots. However, that ""weight"" Smith is
    feeling probably stems from a sudden need to bolster the band's sound
    proportionately with their massive fame, a move that a group like the
    Arcade Fire could pull off on a follow-up album, but not a Joy
    Division/Interpol/U2 cut-and-paste effort like Editors. In a perfect
    world, these guys would never escape the shadow cast
    over them by their predecessors, but they could at least do more than
    compromise them with mass-marketable bombast and arena
    posturing.

The bigger the label, the more divisive the celebration, and Get Physical are bigger than most: The label that held dancers' hands on the journey from electro-house to minimal was facing a backlash long before its fifth birthday party arrived.</p><p>
    Nonetheless it's difficult not to conclude that the roster that once could do no wrong (and by ""once"" I mean about two years ago) is inviting criticism with its latest double disc release. The first disc is devoted solely to a collection of (mostly) new remixes of past classics, with the interveners usually chosen on a favor-returning basis. This leads to some counter-intuitive results, like Hot Chip trying and inevitably failing to enhance one of M.A.N.D.Y.'s best electro-house stormers ""No Stoppin""-- someone should explain to Hot Chip that dancefloor destruction is not as easy as their own remixers make it seem. With ring-ins such as Herbert, the Rapture, Moby, Señor Coconut, and Fujiya &amp; Miyagi, the remix disc resembles a friends list on a MySpace page, more intent on demonstrating the label's diverse following and interconnectedness than on actually delivering results. In fact the collection isn't as painful as that list might suggest (even Moby only manages to bore with his wafting prog-house take on Djuma Soundsystem's ""Les Djinns"") but the often ridiculously eclectic transformations (Tropicália! Post-punk! Indie-rock!) of formerly streamlined instrumental dancefloor tracks seems at once calculating and ill-considered-- who could possibly want to hear all of them?</p><p>
    The Larry Gold String Version of Booka Shade's ""Night Falls"" forms the disc's hubristic peak: a strings-only reproduction, its Faze Action-style disco classicism is undermined by a pervading air of pointlessness. The mistake being made here is to assume that, because Get Physical are feted for their anthems, it's the tunes that are important, and that listeners will want to hear the key melodic motifs of these tracks in a dozen different styles. In fact, what has always made Get Physical appealing is the music's superlative sound design, transforming rather conventional grooves into dazzling, widescreen soundscapes-- and at least initially this was largely due to the sonic fingerprints of in-house producers Booka Shade, who ensured that nearly every release shared the same full-bodied, luminescent glow. By outsourcing the grooves to such a disparate array of producers, this remix collection's main achievement is to ensure that this sound design, this aura of luxuriant perfection, is rarely in evidence (ironically, Henrik Schwarz, one of a very few artists whose baroque production touches could have worked magic on Get Physical's sonic blueprint, offers the disc's most understated and loyal remix, a murky dub of Booka Shade's ""Vertigo"").</p><p>
    The second disc of exclusive new tracks is better, but surprisingly strives for understatement. Most of the inclusions cleave to a muted sound somewhere between electro, minimal and deep house: a fertile valley to be sure, but one which is left curiously uncultivated despite the artists' high production values, with lush house warmth or melodic melodrama largely jettisoned in favor of insectile production nuances, grayscale synth pads and self-conscious old skool signifiers. At its best, this approach produces quietly compelling grooves such as Audiofly X's ""Don't Panic 'Til I Said So"", a softly shuddering piece somewhere between the glistening dub-house of early Force Tracks and the Berlin-Detroit rendezvous of recent Mobilee releases. Elsewhere, on tracks like Riton vs Heidi's ""To The Gum"" or DJ T's ""Once in a Lifetime"", the effect is a slightly grim sense of restraint. Even the reliable Chelonis R. Jones marries his excellent Sartre-in-drag monologue to an unnecessarily dry house groove.</p><p>
    The album's most inviting moments are a reminder of just how great this label can be: Lopazz's paranoid ""The Fact"" is gorgeously dark, endlessly hummable italo-techno that is unafraid to seize the pop jugular, perhaps because its cruel bass heft would silence any accusations of selling out. Even more radically, M.A.N.D.Y vs Booka Shade's ""Oh Superman"" is a gloriously straightforward and ecstatic remix of the Laurie Anderson classic, its key insight being that Laurie's repeated ""Huh huh huh"" makes for a fantastic dancefloor riff. The remix dates back to 2004, back when the sonic superiority of the label's aesthetic was so self-evident that there was no need not to be obvious. By contrast, the diversity of this collection's remixes, together with the terse self-containment of so many of its exclusives, suggest that the label is suffering from a momentary lapse of confidence in its own identity, chasing after stylistic rainbows while simultaneously sucking in its stomach in a bid to appear cutting edge.</p><p>
    But the endless quest for relevance is not really Get Physical's main challenge at this stage. Having parked itself firmly on the invisible line between house and techno, the label can easily latch onto whichever trend flits closest, like a spider at the center of a vast web of interwoven scenes and sounds. The real challenge is for these artists to live up to their own past: Having been responsible for so many groundbreaking anthems in such a short timespan, it would be ignominious for the label to simply become a second Poker Flat, each year churning out a healthy modicum of quality product in the form of ""this year's model,"" but never sounding hungry, let alone dangerous. Surprise and excitement, rather than relevance, is what we loved them for: Let's hope that these aren't set aside along with other childish things.</p></div>"|10419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10419-5-years-get-physical/|5.9|Tim Finney

    Cities, he sings a lyric that seems ironic when considering his own
    grandiosity: ""You got a bad case of the big ideas."" <em>Lucas</em> is,
    on its own terms, a colossal-feeling record, teeming with crowds of
    instrumentation and refusing to settle on any particular musical idea
    for more than a minute or so. Its source of inspiration, however,
    should clear things up a bit. The record is named for the small town of
    Lucas, Kansas, which is home to the Garden of Eden. No, Mehlan's not a
    Mormon with an off-kilter sense of geography-- this Garden is a purely
    American tourist attraction, an eccentric bit of outsider art built in the early 1900s and devoted to
    one man's screwy vision of Biblical lore. Some have said the Garden's creator Samuel
    Dinsmoor had ""dementia concretia,"" an affliction suffered by
    those who've worked all their lives, and, upon retirement, can't shake
    the itch to create, but don't have the occupational structure to rein
    themselves in. It's a ""sickness,"" sure, but one that occasionally
    results in some extraordinary work.</p><p>
    As far as I can tell, Mehlan's not one of the afflicted, but that
    hasn't stopped him from welding together an impressive musical
    contraption of his own, bound by anecdotal tales of an awkward life
    apart. Through <em>Lucas</em>'
    tangled narrative, Dinsmoor and his creation feel like tangential
    characters, the equally misunderstood later-life counterparts of the
    unique-looking boy posing for the album cover. A lyric from ""Hay
    W'happns"" could come from either: ""I got pockets full of gravel, my
    knuckles are skinned/ I got a wall made outta marbles and you're not
    allowed in.""</p><p>
    Later, the vertigo-inducing strings and squelches of ""Like it or Not""
    underscore the record's trend toward the stifled sexuality of the
    teenage unconscious: ""Every day he falls in love with the gorgeous
    backsides of every girl he sets his eyes on/ Follows them home to catch
    a glimpse/ But they never, they never, they never turn around."" ""Fake
    Tits"" is one example of <em>Lucas</em>
    mapping inner turmoil on the body's exterior, explained at the
    beginning of the song when its instrumentation mirrors the unnerving
    clamor of an overactive and nervous imagination: ""I don't have that
    much trust in my body/ It's down deep on th' insides but worn like a
    novelty tee shirt.""
    </p>
<p>
    The slick urbanity of <em>Git</em> (recorded with the now retired
    suffix ""and the Girl-Faced Boys"") is largely gone, yet the
    experimental spirit remains. Like OOIOO's <em>Taiga</em>, Lucas is an
    outsize global-a-go-go mélange of unceasing polyrhythms, Afrobeat
    guitars, free jazz, and Timbaland's approach to kitchen-sink
    percussion. On ""W'happns"", a skronky opening segment suggesting a
    prehistoric diorama roaring to life gives way to a loping rumble.
    Opener ""What They Said"" starts as a disquieting, hollow church revival
    of clapping and stomping-- an uptempo version of Radiohead's ""The
    Gloaming""-- before a luminous guitar emerges to guide the song to its
    conclusion, as the choir revels in the anachronistic provincial maxim
    to solitude ""It's different o'er there, they keeps it to themsel's.""
    The nearly soulful, soft ""Let it Out"" is the record's emotional
    reprieve, as Mehlan's distant quaver gives way to a falsetto: ""Hope
    needs you to believe in it, sugar/ Ain't no other way out"".
    </p>
<p>
    The band clearly knows its strengths, and the record's highlight is
    smack in the middle. The opening fanfare of the 11-minute ""Don't Worry""
    marries guitars that recall both Frank Zappa's and the Grateful Dead's
    mid-Seventies output with a clacking tribal rhythm and punchy brass,
    which wanes and reappears with Mehlan's vocals, growing more and more
    restless and frenetic as it progresses. The lyrics mark a turning point
    on <em>Lucas</em>
    as well-- the moment when the internal negotiations start to realize
    themselves tangibly. The chorus is a note of pragmatic hope, on the way
    to fulfilling the promise of the band's new name: ""Don't worry, we can
    pump water to anywhere/ Electricity, too"". Skeletons never really make
    clear whether <em>Lucas</em>' Garden is one created through aged
    anxiety, adolescent escape, or something somewhere in the middle. They
    shouldn't have to, of course, and the record benefits from an approach
    that performs the intriguing disobedience of both.<br/>

    That colorful jumble of instruments new and ancient, parachuting camels, Martian dirt, and bright banners on the cover of Nu-Med,
    the second album from Balkan Beat Box, is, to be perfectly honest, a
    really cheesy Photoshop job. But it is also apropos for an album that
    sounds like this: the band stirs klezmer, gypsy horns, surf, dub, Arab taqsim, hip-hop, funk, jazz, electro, circus music, and a few dozen other things together to make a raucous ethno/electro-acoustic gumbo that highlights the increasing inadequacy of the generic ""world music"" tag.</p><p>
    Founded by drummer/programmer Tamir Muskat and woodwind player and former Gogol Bordello member Ori Kaplan,
    both originally from Israel, the band gleefully adds its name to the
    ever-lengthening list of groups drawing inspiration from Eastern
    European sounds while rigorously avoiding sounding traditional. The
    lyrics, on the songs that have them, are in several languages,
    reflecting the music's transcendence of borders. The instrumentals
    simply revel in the collision of genres, and are played with a jazzy
    looseness in spite of their programmed undercarriages. ""Quand Est-ce Qu'on
    Arrive?"" even includes a sly quotation from Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant
    Song"" that brings the album's primary theme to the fore without saying
    a word.</p><p>
    The album's opening track, a collage of crowd noise, rhythmic
    vocalizations, and muffled beats, sends the listener in a few
    directions at once, with snatches of hip-hop and dancehall reggae
    ultimately getting overwhelmed by klezmer horns. ""Hermetico"" follows this up with an elastic beat, a strangely elegiac horn part, and MC Tamer Yosef robo-rapping through a processor, his flow clearly influenced by Jamaican dancehall.
    </p>
<p>
    The band makes interesting use of most of the vocals on the album. ""Joro Boro"" pairs surf guitar with gypsy horns and Bulgarian vocalist Dessislava Stefanova, who is multi-tracked singing microtonal harmony with herself in the tradition of her country's women's choirs. Guest Dunia is also multi-tracked, as she sing-raps over dubbed-out horns on ""Habibi Min Zaman"", mixing straight flow with Middle Eastern melisma and fluttering ululations.
    </p>
<p>
    The show is largely stolen from the vocals by the horns, though.
    The horn section on these songs includes as many as seven members on
    certain tracks, with a full complement of tubas, trumpets, flugelhorns,
    as well as woodwinds including saxophones and the occasional clarinet.
    It can be light and fluttering one moment, then thunderous and
    commanding the next. One could be forgiven for thinking that a big pile
    of different sounds from around the world would amount to nothing more
    than a mess, but in the uniting embrace of well-executed beats, it all
    comes together to form an enjoyable spectacle. The biggest problem with
    the album is its somewhat excessive length-- there are passages that
    are too repetitive that could have been trimmed-- but it amounts only
    to a small portion of a few songs. At it's best, it's a brilliant
    collision that connects-- and in some cases, as with Jewish music and
    surf, re-connects-- genres in a distinctly 21<sup>st</sup> Century way.

Most bands build up to this sort of explosive spectacle, but for the     Lips, it's a starting point. Their shows are as much about spectacle as they     are about music, which explains the hybrid technology on <i>UFOs at the Zoo: The Legendary Concert in Oklahoma City</i>. This     document, which is neither simply an album nor simply a concert film, is being     issued as an MVI album, which means it plays on DVD players but not CD players,     and contains bonus digital material. In other words, it presents the visual and     the musical with equal emphasis, but will likely be outdated before the     second-gen iPhone is out.</p>
<p>But for now, <i>UFOs at     the Zoo</i> is about as close as you can get to the controlled chaos of a Lips     show without actually buying tickets. The opening segment features shots of     fans in a bacchanalian frenzy intercut with clips of zoo animals looking     curious, dignified, and quiet. It's a nifty joke that goes on about a minute     too long, creating a you-are-there mix of suspense and impatience. Pretty soon     Steve Drozd, Michael Ivins, and surrogate drummer Kliph Scurlock descend from     underneath the UFO, and Wayne Coyne appears in a giant bubble, which he takes     into the crowd for a tremendous feat of crowd-surfing. What follows is half-party,     half-rave, half-freak-out-- which is one too many halves but speaks to the     maximalism of the show. There's the by-now traditional nun puppet, the     mechanical bird that Coyne flies around stage like he's a child making airplane     noises, a megaphone that spews dense smoke, and a mic-mounted camera that gets     you a little <i>too</i> close to his beard.</p>
<p>Of course, this would all be obnoxious if the music wasn't     part of the equation, if it suffered even the slightest. But the Lips are in     their element on stage, and even the creakiest musical idea sounds persuasive     broadcasting across a sea of spastic bodies. Songs from the lackluster <i>At War With the Mystics</i> sound good in     this setting: ""The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song"" might have been written explicitly for     the sort of crowd participation Coyne uses it for, and ""Vein of Stars""     possesses a cosmic curiosity under the dark Oklahoma     sky. Still, the old material got the band and the crowd moving more happily,     especially ""Love Yer Brain"" (from 1987's <i>Oh     My Gawd!!!...the Flaming Lips</i>), which makes an especially triumphant     closer.</p>
<p>There's an enthusiastic DIY quality to these proceedings:     all the effects, whether musical or visual, are homemade, usually held together     by duct tape and crossed fingers. Drozd's arsenal of instruments and equipment     looks like he built everything himself, and to his credit, he probably did. The     gigantic spaceship, which Coyne allegedly built in his backyard and which rises     vertically to form a stage backdrop, is obviously a tinkered-with contraption,     and in between-song footage, several stagehands wonder aloud whether it will     fall and kill the band. This is a homegrown version of the arena rock show,     slyly subversive of mainstream pyrotechnics and much more invested. The     band-- especially Coyne-- appear genuinely pleased with their gimcrackery and     excited to watch the crowd's reaction to each and every balloon burst and     confetti explosion. When Coyne tells the crowd they're the best audience in the     world and then explains that he <i>really</i> means it, it's obvious he <i>really</i> means it.</p>
<p>The Lips' affection for their fans comes across as neither     forced nor commercially motivated, and <i>UFOs     at the Zoo</i> is the endearing chronicle of the obsessiveness of the musicians     as well as of their fans. Short documentary-style interstitials interview     hardcore fans who have traveled from all over the country, some in full costume     (my favorite was the girl in the nun costume, who needed a Wayne Coyne puppet),     others trying to check fake blood in their carry-ons (3-oz. containers, dude),     and one working out ""The Sound of Failure"" on acoustic guitar. They comprise a     joyous throng whose excitement seems barely contained, even when it's     intensified by dope or booze. And Coyne presides over it with a kind of hippie     benevolence that allows room for some realistic-to-the-point-of-pessimistic     philosophies about life and music. When he and the band finally leave the     stage, the camera settles on the crowd, who mill about the amphitheatre,     reluctant to leave the spectacle behind.</p></div>"|10437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10437-ufos-at-the-zoo-the-legendary-concert-in-oklahoma-city/|8.0|Stephen M.

    As useful as completist
    reissue projects are, they inevitably run into some stuff that
    shouldn't have been issued in the first place. James Brown spent the
    better part of 1964 and 1965 playing chicken with King
    Records-- trying to get out of his contract, recording for rival label
    Smash, and continuing to tour on the back of his older hits and the
    random crap from the vaults that King kept tossing onto the market as
    singles. This will almost certainly be the weakest volume of Hip-O's
    mail-order-only complete-JB-singles series, just because its
    historical context yielded so much barrel-scraping. It also includes
    three of Brown's biggest hits, including at least one song that
    pretty much transformed all pop music after it, so that weakness is
    relative.</p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Still, of the 36 A- and
    B-sides here, more than half actually predate 1964: Brown didn't hand
    over any new material to King for the first year and a half of the
    two years this two-disc set covers. Four tracks are edited, sometimes
    drastically, from the epochal 1962 gig that became the hit <em>Live at
    the Apollo</em> LP-- ""Think"" is slowed down almost 20% in
    order to hit the two-minute mark, an unfortunate antecedent of the
    chopped-and-screwed sound--and the eight-year-old ""Please,
    Please, Please"" is (totally unconvincingly) overdubbed with
    screaming fans to sound live. So is a lackadaisical cover of Louis
    Jordan's ""Caldonia"" that became Brown's first single on
    Smash; discovering that it ran only 2:07, Brown apparently decided to
    make it more radio-worthy by appending a little more crowd noise,
    then repeating its final 30 seconds.</p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    He scored one solid hit
    on Smash: the double A-side ""Out of Sight"" and ""Maybe
    the Last Time"", a proto-funk look toward the future and a
    hard-gospel wave toward the past. (The title of ""Maybe the Last
    Time"" was fitting: it was the final big single to prominently
    feature the Famous Flames on backing vocals, even though they weren't
    credited.) In response, King's boss Syd Nathan sued his star for
    breach of contract. The legal resolution was that Brown was still
    under contract to King for vocal recordings, but could record
    instrumentals for Smash. That gave Brown an excuse to cut a bunch of
    instrumentals that featured him playing organ with his band. He's
    legendary for his self-regard, of course, but releasing his organ
    solos as singles actually crossed the line into vanity. 
    </p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Fortunately, in
    mid-1965, King and Brown settled their differences, and Soul Brother
    #1, in turn, finally stopped dicking around. ""Papa's Got a Brand
    New Bag"", the first fruit of the détente, singlehandedly
    invented funk: it's more space than sound. (It's hard to beat Dave
    Marsh's description: ""The only way ['Papa'] could be more
    bone-rattling would be if James Brown himself leaped from your
    speakers, grabbed you tight by the shoulders and danced you around
    the room, all the while screaming straight into your face."") He
    followed that up with ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"", and as
    hard as it is to hear that song now that it's become the soundtrack
    to an audio-animatronic James Brown doll, the single grinning tune
    that stands in for a raging 50-year career, it's still a hell of a
    record. With that left-right combination, his career pulled out of
    its two-year mire, and his mightiest decade got underway.

    Henning Fürst and Eric Berglund aren't ""real"" pop
    stars; they just play them in Sweden.
    As electronic pop duo the Tough Alliance, Fürst and Berglund perform their live
    shows without instruments, committing the ultimate rock heresy of dancing and
    miming to pre-recorded tracks. (Just ask the Knife. Or Milli Vanilli.) The
    tracks themselves seem to aspire to platinum status, matching
    shiny digital beats to vaguely tropical synths, sugar-sweet melodies, and
    cryptic yet simple lyrics that often involve romance. If you weren't paying
    attention, you might think they had more in common with Ace of Base than with
    other Gothenburg-born groups such as the Knife or Love Is All.</p><p>
    Like Malcolm McLaren or the KLF, though, the Tough Alliance
    spike their pop with Situationist politics, sometimes to a point where it's
    difficult to separate the music from the group's broader arsenal of cultural
    weaponry.  Fürst and Berglund certainly
    don't; as with Tony Wilson's Factory Records, their Sincerely Yours imprint (Air
    France, the Honeydrips) assigns a catalog number to everything from promo
    videos to bottles of wine. ""A way to escape or a way to wage war?"" they
    asked in Yours000, the first post on the label's website. The <em>New Waves </em>EP-- released last year in
    Europe and now finally available in North America
    via Summer Lovers Unlimited-- is probably both.</p><p>
    The disc represents a step forward from the inexperienced
    shoutiness of neverthelesss promising 2005 debut <em>The
    New School</em>, though at only four tracks <em>New Waves </em>inevitably feels slight next to new
    full-length <em>A New Chance</em> (which
    Summer Lovers Unlimited also hopes to bring to these shores eventually). The
    bright synths, dubby drum loops, and wistful lyrics of ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/42676-the-tough-alliance-first-class-riot-video-silly-crimes-video-mp3"">Silly Crimes</a></strong>"" make it a clear standout-- the kind
    of track it's hard to believe isn't on a proper album. With just a
    few words and a cheesy spring break vibe, the song manages to be fragile and
    emotionally rewarding without affecting the trappings of seriousness, as so
    many current indie spoilsports do. Even a rare precious line like ""wasting
    love, ennobling hate"" is surrounded by those purring bird-call synth
    noises.   
    </p>
<p>
    The EP begins on a more confrontational note: ""Kill this
    compromise,"" a voice repeats through Daft Punk-like vocoder on ""Kill
    Kill Kill"", basically a song fragment. The lyric will recur on <em>The New School'</em>s ""Babylon"". A more
    substantial testament to the Tough Alliance's unique vision is ""25 Years
    and Runnin'"", which imagines a life spent looking for a home while forever unable to
    shake some deep-seated inner woe. Vivid melodies and globetrotting lyrics pull
    a yearning pop victory from the jaws of Eurodance synths, 4x4 beats, some oddly
    Caribbean-style percussion, and crazed sound effects: ""Now I know that New
    York is where a boy can have some fun/ If I only could change where I came
    from."" Cheeky finale ""Mine Was Real"" covers the heartbreaking
    1970 soul classic by Rozetta Johnson, adding the duo's wall-of-can-sound
    production but seeming to lose none of the original's sincerity. Now that's what I call détournement.
    </p>
<p>
    In keeping with the Tough Alliance's multimedia tactics, <em>New Waves</em> comes with a pair of videos.
    The clip for ""Silly Crimes"", called ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn5D3msfAUk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Simple Games</strong></a>"", shows
    girls jumping rope in the sun-dappled outdoors and in front of a film
    projection (a recurring visual motif of theirs) of splashing waves; its
    unbridled innocence leaves me wondering what darker subtext might or might not
    be lurking beneath. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDjcC14Z5W4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>25 Summers and Runnin'</strong></a>"", the video for ""25
    Years and Runnin'"", also encourages further scrutiny despite a somewhat
    more jumbled appearance, as a simple negative image of a running man is
    superimposed above shots of tennis players, migrating geese, and Tough Alliance
    gigs. If the duo's full political intentions aren't necessarily clear at the
    end of the EP, their musical ones are: Fürst and Berglund are a couple of
    punk-minded provocateurs who play pop not for camp value or hipster irony, but
    because it's the purest form of expression a boy has left.

    My knee-jerk reaction to the music on <em>Keep Reachin' Up</em> is to call it retro soul, and to a degree, that's
    quite accurate. It's soul music with classic-sounding arrangements and
    production, but the maturity of the compositions and the ingenuity of the
    string orchestrations that adorn several of the songs make the retro tag feel
    unnecessary. Really, this is just plain good soul music that touches signposts
    from New Orleans to Memphis
    to Philly to Detroit.</p><p>
    This is solo joint #3 for Willis, who spent much of the 90s
    dropping guest vocals for The The, Deee-lite, Leftfield and other acts. She has
    a classic soul voice, sweet and cool but capable of rising up for a good wail
    when the song needs it. Where, for me, her first two records suffered a bit
    from their sound, this move to raw, funky immediacy and old-school economy
    works beautifully and lets her voice fulfill its potential. The Soul
    Investigators, who are largely responsible for the shift, hail from the soul
    Mecca of Finland, as does the Pekka Kuusisto String Orchestra, which injects a
    flash of silver into some of the records' darkest corners.</p><p>
    The Soul Investigators must live and breathe old soul and
    funk 45s, because they've internalized all of the tropes and elements of the
    music to the point where they're able to invent new things with them. Drummer
    Jukka Sarapää holds a steady groove the whole way through, and the guitar, bass,
    and organ leave lots of room for Willis and the horn section, which includes
    Willis' husband, Jimi Tenor, on several songs. The record's opening salvo, the
    exuberant ""Feeling Free"", is sublime, building a driving beat
    around a repeated pizzicato string figure. ""I'm lovin' this music/ I'm feelin'
    free,"" sings Willis on the swirling chorus-it's a well-traveled ""weekend is for
    parties"" theme, but Willis, who writes all her own lyrics, puts a nice spin on
    it. 
    </p>
<p>
    The opener's ebullience is miles away from the epic waltz
    that lies near the album's other end. ""No One's Gonna Love You"" kicks off with
    a tipsy, palm-muted guitar part that drags you down into a sweaty, organ-soaked
    underworld, where Willis is menaced by the orchestra, which stalks the
    arrangement like her estranged lover haunts her thoughts. The chorus splits the
    song wide open with thunderclap drums, dramatic backing vocals and swelling
    horns. The song sounds like romantic turmoil feels.
    </p>
<p>
    Most of the rest of the record is more in tune with its
    free-spirited beginning. ""If This Ain't Love (Don't Know What Is)"" strips the Motown
    sound to its essential elements, with the snare drum hitting every beat, but
    the heavily echoplexed flute solo, played by Tenor, injects a dose of
    psychedelia when you least expect it. Willis forms her own vocal jazz ensemble
    through overdubs on ""Blues Downtown"", while the horns get down with the slinky
    groove and slashing, noir guitar. Engineer/producer Didier Selin deserved a lot
    of credit for getting such a rich, three-dimensional sound out of the band.
    </p>
<p>
    There are a few low ebbs: The instrumental ""Soul
    Investigators Theme"" plays like a backing track without the vocal, and the
    title track sacrifices the tune in favor of a funky groove, and hits one
    passage where it sounds like a skipping record-dig the drum break and horn
    arrangement, though. These minor transgressions are hardly worth talking about
    in light of how strong the record is on the whole, however, and Willis has
    snatched a solid position in the soul revival world. If I were to make a direct
    comparison, I might position her as the Martha Reeves to Sharon Jones' Irma
    Thomas, though that comparison is a bit too facile. In the end, it goes back to
    what I said at the top: This is just good soul music.

The guy practically tells the online music scene to fuck itself with <em>Kelp Monthly</em>, a service in which every 30 days, via snail mail, subscribers receive another eclectic nugget of Blau's creativity, ranging from collaborations with fellow D+ (and ex-Beat Happening) members Bret Lunsford and Phil Elvrum to 12"" field recordings of crickets chirping. Give one of his releases a spin, and you'll appreciate more than just his grass-roots ethos. Picking up where his previous full-length <em>Beneath Waves</em> left off, <em>Dance Positive</em> features Blau putting his unique spin on 10 D+ songs penned by Lunsford, running them through a gauntlet of stylistic and experimental mettle.</p><p>
    While here Blau alludes to dance music both in the album's title and its heightened sense of rhythm, these Lunsford ditties carry too much of Blau's lo-fi, Pacific Northwest musk to constitute a full-blown reinvention--especially for a guy so typically all over the map like Blau. While his vocals still possess that signature sylvan stoicism, Blau isn't afraid to put down the granola and venture onto the dance floor. ""Put Me Back"" glides over a pulsating synth line that overpowers its hissy accompaniment, while ""What's Not To Fall in Love With"" backs up its cocksure title with spastic drum machine blips and a suave delivery.</p><p>
    The newfound swing in Blau's step espouses him with similarly glitchy, yet catchy, genre-hoppers like Caribou or Four Tet, as opposed to the poor man's <em>Odelay </em>some of his prior records settled for. ""The Business"" renders any presumable music industry commentary moot as silky power chords and tinny harmonics drown out Blau's near-whisper. Although heady psyche sprinkles every track here to some extent, ""Heatherwood"" blows the lid off, jamming on a space-age Hawkwind bassline and eerie horn parts.</p><p>
    However, as the voracious music epicurean he is, Blau tends to snack so quickly through genres that the listener sometimes can't appreciate the flavor. <em>Dance Positive</em> lacks a stud track, just as Blau's discography lacks a landmark album conveniently encapsulating his canon, and there's really nothing wrong with that. Basically, the guy writes songs from the brain, not the gut, and while nothing here elicits a tear or two-step, <em>Dance Positive</em> is a nearly unlimited supply of cerebral candy you never grow sick on.</p></div>"|10430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10430-dance-positive/|7.1|Adam Moerder

    Over the past few years, They Might Be Giants made such a smooth transition to children's rock that one would speculate becoming Raffi for the hipster-parent set was their ultimate destiny all along. But reducing their legacy to Wiggles-alternatives does injustice to a now quarter-century (!!!) run that has snaked its way through a variety of phases: sampler pranksters, full-band genre decathletes, frightfully prolific TV soundtrackers, and meta-lit accompaniment. Poll any segment of music fandom on their favorite TMBG era (we've all got one, don't even deny it), and the tallest bar will inevitably fall in the region of <em>Lincoln</em> &gt; <em>Apollo 18</em>. It's no great mystery why; as with most bands, this early era contained all the seeds of the above-listed later TMBG phases in relatively equal amounts.</p><p>
    But one seed apparently fell on rocky ground, being somewhat neglected as the Johns got a real band and bigger ambitions: The band's long-forgotten post-punk upbringing. Gasp if you must, but don't forget they started in 1982 and that early singles ""Don't Let's Start"" and ""Ana Ng"" could almost pass for the twitchy, catchy work of crit-faves like the dB's or the Feelies, bands too high on dork factor to have fit into the more fashionable environs of post-punk's cool cousin new-wave. No, really, listen to them again.</p><p>
    Fortunately, as Johns Linnell and Flansburgh go somewhat gracefully into their middle ages, they seem to be recalling some of those tighter, tauter early days, when they were closer to Devo than Elmo. The creepy Marcel Dzama art of <em>The Else</em> would suggest so, as would the wonderfully stiff beat of ""I'm Impressed"", an anthem for beta-males with music as nervous as its message, not jokingly wrapped in big rock production like so much latter-day TMBG. That one's a Linnell, but Flansburgh is usually the one game for a power-pop throwback a la ""Twisting"", throwing together barre chords with some self-entertaining clever lyrics for the simple charms of ""The Shadow Government"" and ""Feign Amnesia"".
    </p>
<p>
    Oh, but if only they had stopped there. For a band that could probably deal with a mild break from ambition, recruiting the Dust Brothers as producers is not a promising sign, though their presence isn't as blatant as it could have been. The fuzz-bass backbeat on ""Take Out the Trash"" may sound a bit like <em>Odelay</em>, but Flansburgh's (hopefully) unintentional biting of Smash Mouth is what ultimately sinks the song. And surely the siblings Dust can't be blamed for the train wreck that is ""With the Dark"", some sort of mini-epic, maybe about pirates, that can't stay in one genre for more than 20 seconds. 
    </p>
<p>
    As is becoming more and more common, TMBG are failed by their soft spot for musical humor and gimmickry, tendencies they used to keep in fine balance, but which have increasingly gotten away from them as their palette got wider. I mean, Christ, I'm a neurobiologist, and even I only got a one-time chuckle out of ""Contrecoup"", which filters a love song through traumatic brain injury terminology. Same goes for ""The Mesopotamians"" and ""Bee of the Bird of the Moth"", songs with words like ""mesopotamish"" and ""bugness"" that don't help the cause of anyone arguing that the band is more than a (particularly long-lived) novelty act.
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps TMBG are just happier making kid's music-- even when they try to grapple with adult situations on ""Upside Down Frown"" or ""Climbing Up the Walls"" it still comes out G-rated. Or maybe they just like being in a child's ideal of a rock band, with their addictions to needless guitar solos and brass parts, long overdue for an intervention. But if they could just concentrate on what it was like to be young, but not <em>that</em> young, for longer than the 2:39 of ""I'm Impressed"", they could remind people that they were once more than just licensing geniuses and rugrat headliners, they were nervy, high-strung, geek-rock kings. I don't want the world, I just want that half.

    Disco's most popular document was, at the time of its release, also one of its least
    representative: <em>Saturday Night Fever </em>is
    disco for straight, white males. A phenomenon 30 years ago, John Badham's B-movie and its accompanying 2xLP soundtrack not only made John
    Travolta a star, but escorted the music out of gay
    discotheques and black nightclubs and into the glare of the mainstream.
    However, it did so by diluting disco's more extreme elements to create a safer,
    more marketable package. Even then, conservative audiences saw disco culture
    as a Sodom and Gomorrah
    rather than an alternative Eden.
    The recent surge of interest in the era-- specifically in Peter Shapiro's
    excellent history <em>Turn the Beat Around</em>,
    but also demonstrated by groups like Scissor Sisters and Franz Ferdinand-- only
    sets disco's outsider nature, as well as this collection's shortcomings, in
    sharper relief.</p><p>
    The movie itself is seedy in a different way (rape, bigotry,
    death), but as film critic David Thompson writes, ""Children ignored its...sordid suburban context. That film only existed when Travolta danced."" In
    addition to his extraordinary dance moves, the actor's edgy, preening presence
    holds the camera's attention as it juxtaposes him with the lifeless neighborhood around him. Similarly, the soundtrack, which Rhino is reissuing on its
    30th anniversary, is a showcase for hetero heartthrobs the Bee Gees, who
    contribute a third of the tracklist, get a writing credit for Yvonne Elliman's
    ""If I Can't Have You"", and even grace the cover as some sort of mirrorball Holy
    Trinity. It makes cynical sense: The Bee Gees played their own instruments; had
    a dubious history in sub-Beatles pop; and were white and handsome-- all of
    which made them more marketable to new audiences than their black, female, or
    homosexual peers. As such, they should be critical pariahs on par with Stone Temple Pilots or the Killers, but their six tracks on <em>Saturday Night Fever</em>
    are frequently brilliant and redemptively fun. With its snaking
    instrumental melody and sneaking beat, opener ""Stayin' Alive"" is all
    cocksure strut, even separated from Travolta's stroll through the
    credits, and ""Night Fever"" and ""You Should Be Dancin'"" have an urgency
    that makes dancin' seem like a life-or-death imperative. Their portion
    of the soundtrack forms a condensed hits package that few bands of the
    era can rival.</p><p>
<em>Saturday Night Fever</em>
    is by no means the definitive compilation of disco-- Rhino's 4xCD <em>Disco Box</em>, for example, is obviously
    more comprehensive, and Strut's <em>Disco (Not Disco)</em> comps and Tommy Boy's <em>The Perfect Beats </em>help capture proto-, post-, and underground disco-- but even beyond the contributions of the Bee Gees, it does
    have the potential to be a gateway comp, exposing listeners to a small range of
    disco subgenres. There's funk: ""Open Sesame"" doesn't rank among Kool &amp; the
    Gang's absolute best cuts, but its silly vocals and breakneck horns are
    nevertheless impressive. There's soul: The Trammps' 10-story ""Disco Inferno""--
    the extended cut, no less-- provides both the soundtrack's climax and its
    denouement. And of course there's novelty: Walter Murphy's ""Fifth of Beethoven""
    is not just the height of disco-geek cheese, but also the precursor to
    ""serious"" undertakings by contemporary artists like Mirwais and Moby. Surprisingly,
    there are even Latin rhythms on <em>Saturday
    Night Fever</em>, most notably on M.F.S.B.'s ""K-Jee"" but also consigned to the
    souped-up incidental music by David Shire and Ralph McDonald.
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, <em>Saturday
    Night Fever</em> doesn't disregard disco's underground origins so much as it simply
    sublimates them to the mainstream white experience. As a soundtrack, it works
    perfectly well, immersing listeners in the music (and therefore the spirit) of
    the film while selling more tickets. But as a pop-cultural document, it is
    significantly flawed, not only linked to a midlevel movie but also unable to
    fully capture the movement with which it has been so strongly identified. Thirty
    years later, after the ugly DISCO SUCKS trend and countless revivals both
    sincere and ironic, the appeal of <em>Saturday
    Night Fever</em> seems squarely nostalgic, but whatever its impact then or now,
    there is some amazing music on here-- and even more beyond.

By this logic, Hamburg must be thick with bell towers, because virtually every release on the city's Dial label-best known until now for anchor tenants Lawrence and Pantha du Prince-thrums with brassy clangor.</p><p>
    The debut album from Efdemin-- aka Phillip Sollmann, who is also a member of the duo Pigon-- takes this tendency further than ever, reveling in the swift attack, fat decay, and lingering tail of struck instruments, whether real or synthesized. (It's strange and somehow charming that a record so subtle and, in many places, so soothing, could depend so heavily on such relentless percussive battery-- but then, the piano is a percussive instrument as well, and Erik Satie, whose fondness for blurry aftermath is all over this lush, resonant album, didn't exactly make heavy music.) Suffusing nimble, minimal-house constructions with melancholic melodies and counterpoints, Efdemin hammers on virtually every chime on the rack: glockenspiel, vibraphone, church bell, doorbell, squelchy 303 clone and other, more fanciful and definitely synthetic sounds, like the subaquatic anvil and the Berghain alarm clock.</p><p>
    I'd assumed that most of Efdemin's sounds were the products of FM synthesis, a form of digital synthesis that throws off overtone halos around every note. (The Knife made quite a big deal about FM synthesis when they released <em>Silent Shout</em>; you can hear its telltale shimmer in the steel drums of ""The Captain"" and the mallet-like chimes of ""From Off to On"", both from that record.) But it turns out that that's not the case: Sollmann told me that the opening track is sourced from field recordings in Vienna, where the MUMOK (Museum of Modern Art Ludwig Foundation Vienna) is covered in grey basalt tiles that make a muted sound when struck. With that in mind, the track's title, ""Knocking at the Grand"", makes perfect sense: he's literally knocking at what must be the grandest mallet instrument in the world.</p><p>
    Seventy-two minutes long, the album never strains; it passes in a rose-tinted blur. That Sollmann plies many of the same ideas again and again is no criticism. Just as a rock band in the pocket settles upon its ideal means of treating, voicing and arranging a lineup of guitar, bass, drums, vox and whatever else they might throw into the mix, Sollmann has figured out a format that works time and again, offering plenty of opportunity for both timbral experiments and plain-old songwriting panache. Two tracks in particular prove highlights, however. ""Lohn und Brot"", first released as part of a split 12-inch single by the Liebe*Detail label (and previously covered in <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/43131-efdemin-lohn-und-brot-stream""><strong>Forkcast</strong></a>), is an expansive, eight-minute wonder, slathered in shimmering chimes and as moody as your life. Acting like a perpetual motion machine, it seems to generate its own energy from the friction between its many contrapuntal melodies, and when the synths flare up at the song's climax, it feels like the heavens themselves are opening wide. ""Acid Bells"" is something else entirely: practically goth in its brooding, the song layers syncopated bell tones over an understated pulse of kick drum, brushed hi-hats and little else. Sollmann spends the first half of the song winding up a crescendo of sturm und klang; for the second half, everything unwinds as modulating delay snaps the real-time tethers and sends everything spinning into a dizzy, detuned din. Urgent and angry, it maps a space precisely opposite ""Knocking at the Grand"", knocking over that tune's architectural grounding and giving itself up to tempests from on high. Even moreso than the Field's recent album for Kompakt, Efdemin's debut album is a one-way ticket to the sublime.<br/></p></div>"|10411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10411-efdemin/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

    It's funny how casually some dudes still dismiss the house-rock hybrids
    filed under stupid but catchy genre tags ""nu rave"" and ""blog house"".
    Especially since acclaimed outfits like
    Soulwax, the DFA, Teifschwarz, and Vitalic-- not to mention the entire
    electroclash scene-- have already for years propagated some of the same
    ideas now championed by Daft Punk-loving dance labels Kitsuné and Ed
    Banger. This shit
    isn't supposed to be novel, just really fucking good.</p><p>
    A quick recap: Justice show no mercy;
    Simian Mobile Disco aim to please; and on the summer's third
    high-profile
    indie-dance debut, Hamburg
    duo Digitalism turn out to be the artists probably most dedicated of
    all to the idea of merging rock and electronic dance music.
    Unfortunately, such purity of vision works better in concept than on
    the group's first full-length, <em>Idealism</em>.</p><p>
    Digitalism's first actual release, a re-edit of the White
    Stripes' ""Seven Nation Army"", helped them become the inaugural Kitsuné
    signees. A series of 12"" singles followed, and the A-sides recur here
    in slightly edited form. Choked with heavy compression, these tracks
    show
    Digitalism making their Korg synthesizers and 900-MHz PC act like rock
    instruments, though without Justice's violent distortion.
    ""Zdarlight"" spreads repetitive filter-disco synths over nearly
    six minutes, climaxing after the beat drops out nearly halfway through
    (and the
    Air-y bass drops in). ""Idealistic"" puts lo-fi, Rapture-esque vocals--
    ""I had the idea that you were near""-- atop similar electro-house
    pulses and guitar-like squiggles. ""Jupiter Room"", issued on <em>Kitsuné Maison 3 </em>in a ""Martian
    Assault"" version, sends French touch to Europa. Or is it Io, the one with the
    volcanoes?<em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Idealism</em>'s house-rock cross-fertilization goes both ways.
    Overcoming their rudimentary instrumental skills via sampler,
    Digitalism give
    newest single (and album highlight) ""Pogo"" a New Order-worthy guitar
    riff, live drums, and whirring pop-ambient loops recalling Swedish
    savant the
    Field. ""Digitalism in Cairo"" dismembers
    the Cure's ""Fire in Cairo"" for a dizzying, bass-heavy almost-banger.
    But other rock-leaning tracks such as
    ""I Want I Want"" or ""Anything New"" wind up sounding like Brooklyn
    dance-punk fallout given a haphazard Klaxons remix. Even unabashed
    softies the Postal Service would blush at the
    heart-on-sleeve lap-pop of ""Apollo-Gize"".
    </p>
<p>
    Despite strong if not earth-shattering singles, <em>Idealism</em> falters when expanding its house-rock,
    rock-house devotion to 15-track album. There's a tenuous story involving
    trips to Cairo
    and outer space, but that can't justify weak
    interludes like ""Departure from Cairo""
    or ""Jupiter Approach"". The robot romance of ""Moonlight"" and
    ""Echoes"" falls flat beside the better tracks here-- or elsewhere in
    their burgeoning genre, whatever you want to call it. ""I have the biggest
    party ever at home,"" Digitalism brag over malevolent synths on ""Home
    Zone"". They're totally joking, but that doesn't make it true.

    There's usually not much point in spending a lot of time trying to
    deconstruct a musician's alias, but seriously: ""DJ Mayonnaise""? Really?
    There has to be some sort of self-aware unrealness quotient behind the
    choice of that name, in which the palest of condiments (to the extent
    it was a punchline on ego trip's ""The (White) Rapper Show"") is
    slathered over decades of hip-hop tradition. You might be relieved to
    know that the Anticon producer and ostensible wheels-of-steelsman
    doesn't get that shticky, but his lack of a shtick is precluded by
    the lack of anything else in his music that might be considered a
    personality or a vision. <em></em></p><p>
<em>Still Alive</em> is Mayo's first solo record since 1999's <em>55 Stories</em>,
    and time's progressed a lot more than his aesthetic has. You ever heard
    any indie rap that doesn't crib its production template directly from
    Pete Rock? Good, there won't be any need to talk you down from what
    might otherwise be a severe panic attack. After all, some of the beats
    on <em>Still Alive</em> are a bit eerie and downtempo and have static crackling over them, so you might feel a little creeped
    out if you somehow missed DJ Shadow and Massive Attack and
    Boards of Canada and Tricky and the 1990s in general. The warmed-over
    atmosphere of <em>Still Alive</em> is going to be familiar-- maybe
    painfully so-- to anyone who ever came within squinting distance of a
    MoWax comp or knows at least two Luke Vibert aliases, and if there's
    anything here that works, it works in the exact same way every
    aforementioned artist (except, OK, maybe Pete Rock) has worked in the
    past.</p><p>
    So: opener ""Post Reformat"" galumphs along with flatulent synth-bass
    and
    Blue Man Group percussion, with the only vibrant element-- a brief,
    solitary pair of guitar notes-- coming at just past the three-minute
    mark. (Enjoy them while you can; they're immediately followed by some
    muddy, scraped-up vocal hook that sounds like Bugs Bunny imitating Milk
    D from Audio Two; what he's actually saying is anyone's guess.) ""The
    Windham Song"" is a promising idea gone sour, Southwestern desert noir
    funk with neon hums and a Robert Rodriguez-ready guitar undercut by an
    unfocused rhythmic momentum and a goopy Skinemax saxophone. ""Munjoy
    Moments"" is the requisite slab of indie-pop-meets-electro mush,
    with tinkling synthetic chimes that make it too precious to
    pop/lock/roll and a crusty, pigeonshit bassline rendering it too
    abrasive to be beautiful. And the one track with actual rapping on it,
    ""Strateegery"", features K-the-I??? cracking Dubya snaps too hackneyed
    for ""Lil' Bush"" and dropping first-draft bumper sticker phrases (""I
    salute the brave new world order""; ""Not me voting for the lesser of two
    evils"") that Mr. Lif would've tossed out at age 16.
    </p>
<p>
    DJ Mayonnaise's website features a telling origin story, where the
    Anticon member later known as Alias shames a school-age Mayo for being
    big into Guy. That could be why <em>Still Alive</em>
    doesn't have any life in its rhythm -- even if Mayo spent the
    subsequent years learning the benefits of hip-hop, his music shows that
    he's spent even more time worrying about how to avoid the temptations
    of pop futurism. If the price you pay for ditching new jack swing is a
    discography filled with grooveless stasis, make mine Teddy Riley. And
    hold the Miracle Whip.

    with <em>Mojo</em> magazine, Nick Drake's longtime producer, Joe
    Boyd, assured fans that ""Everything releasable has been
    released."" Boyd's pledge seems almost laughable now: As
    Drake's tombstone famously, presciently reads, ""Now we
    rise and we are everywhere.""</p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    The bulk of the
    material on the 28-track <em>Family Tree</em>-- a new
    collection of lo-fi home recordings produced on a reel-to-reel at
    Drake's parent's estate, Far Leys, plus eight tracks
    recorded on cassette while Drake was studying in Aix En Provence,
    France, one duet with his sister, Gabrielle, and two songs written
    and performed by his mother, Molly-- has already circulated
    widely on bootlegs, traded, and cherished by Drake completists, many
    of whom acquired the cuts by making a pilgrimage to Far Leys and
    requesting music from Drake's parents, who once welcomed their
    son's grieving fans.</p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Even though some of
    these tracks have been around for years, posthumously publicizing
    Drake's private home recordings still feels a bit like an
    ethical landmine-- already, a glut of releases (compilations,
    unreleased recordings, greatest hits) is marring an
    otherwise-pristine three LP legacy, and dipping into something as
    personal and unfinished as home demos can seem a bit opportunistic,
    vaguely unnecessary, and maybe even a tiny bit cruel: Although his
    music is eerily ubiquitous in 2007, Nick Drake was a commercial
    failure in his lifetime, selling only a middling number of records
    before overdosing in 1974, at age 26.
    </p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Still: Compiled by
    Drake's sister, Gabrielle, produced by his estate manager,
    Cally, and mixed by beloved engineer John Wood (who also produced
    <em>Pink Moon</em>, and recorded Drake's first two records), it
    seems likely that <em>Family Tree</em> was created and realized with
    the very best intentions. In the liner notes,
    Gabrielle, addressing her brother in an open-ended letter, is
    cautious, apologetic: ""Up till now, every decision I have taken-- I have been allowed to take-- on your behalf about your
    music has been guided by what I<em> believe</em> might have met with
    your approval...But now, I am endorsing the publication of an
    album that I am not at all sure you would have sanctioned.""
    </p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Most cuts feel
    unfinished-- four are clearly sketches, clocking in at under
    one minute – and nothing here is particularly revelatory, but
    <em>Family Tree</em> is still worth snatching up if you're
    interested in hearing how Drake's patented coo-and-strum
    developed: All tracks pre-date Drake's 1969 debut, <em>Five
    Leaves Left</em> (early versions of ""Way to Blue"" and ""Day Is Done"" both appear here), and it's not difficult to
    hear the budding folksinger's style build and expand. 
    </p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Nick and Gabrielle pair
    up for a cover of traditional cut ""All My Trials""; based
    on a Bahamian lullaby, the cut was an omnipresent protest song in the
    early 1960s, and its closing couplet-- ""All my trials,
    Lord/ Soon be over""-- is typically read as optimistic,
    but given the gruesome ending of Nick Drake's story, the line
    (and Drake's muted delivery) suddenly seems ominous,
    foreboding. ""All My Trials"" is arguably the most riveting
    track here: Drake strums gently, and he and his sister harmonize (in
    the otherworldly way only siblings can), their voices naturally
    congruent, curling together, building on shared DNA. 
    </p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Drake covers a handful
    of Jackson C. Frank songs (""Here Come The Blues"", ""Blues
    Run the Game"", ""Milk and Honey""), Robin Frederick's
    ""Been Smoking Too Long"" (which also appears on <em>Time of
    No Reply</em>), the traditional ""My Baby's So
    Sweet"", Bert Jansch's ""Strolling Down the Highway"",
    and Bob Dylan's ""Tomorrow is a Long Time"", but it's
    ultimately his own work that shines brightest-- now and, in all
    likelihood, forever.
