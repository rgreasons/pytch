    It's nothing personal.  Chances are, it's just the color of your skin.  Sure, the group has historical
    evidence to back up some of their disdain for the other white meat, but in stark contrast to the creative
    narrative-based style of The Coup's Boots Riley and the abrasive, loudspeaker soundclash of Public Enemy,
    Dead Prez's music fails by sounding purely conventional and presenting their cause in the most ignorant
    manner possible.</p><p>
    
    m1 and stic.man are the emcees behind the most popular anti-establishment, pro-black militant rap group
    today and they draw their lyrical fury from a history of drug dealing, dropping out of high school, and
    traditional ghetto upbringings.  Their songs span a vast array of subject matter: disdain for the police,
    revolutions, drugs, depressed mothers, black power, the hood, revolutions, black power, dead homies,
    revolutions and black power.  This in mind, there are only eight full-length songs and the best track is
    a remake.</p><p>
    
    ""Last Days Reloaded"" is an exercise in how a new style of soundscape and limited exposure can help a group.
    Fredro Starr's dusty windsong production harkens back to Marley Marl, while the Dead Prez duo make good
    use of the backing (and original rhyme schemes of the Onyx classic) for the best song on the album. Most
    impressively is Sticky Fingaz returning to form in the face of one of his older great works, with ridiculously
    raw lines like, ""I done broke every rule in the good book/ Trust me, I've memorized the anarchist cookbook,""
    and, ""Fuck it, throw me in jail, I need a vacation!""</p><p>
    
    The caveats of the Dead Prez movement are plentiful: The subject matter is underdeveloped and narrow, their
    guest emcees are less than sharp, and the album structure is made for abbreviated listening, yet comes off
    more loosely constructed than urgent. Most importantly, even though the artists speak about news reporters
    ""making scapegoats of every black youth on the corner"" and the death of Tupac with fervid emotion, they
    still manage to bore with their meandering song structure and lazy neo-soul choruses.</p><p>
    
    The production is vastly disappointing when compared to their work with Kanye West and others on their
    near-classic debut. Most of the beats are skewed towards an embarrassingly dated Tupac bootleg album feel,
    while a scant few are reduced to tone-deaf bounce tracks that make Lil' Jon look like a platinum-clad
    Prefuse 73.  Particularly unfortunate are Tahir's ""Paper, Paper"", sporting a melody that could easily pass
    for a child's first experiment with <i>Mario Paint</i>'s music editor, and the fake piano and flat bass of
    ""Scared to Die"" by Askari X.</p><p>
    
    m1 is currently dating Erykah Badu, and her influence is fresh in his sudden penchant for song. If Badu is
    responsible for Andre 3000's creative renaissance and Common's bad rapping/knitted hats, m1 will be rocking
    shows with red, green and black parachute pants, writing ballads about how his love for Badu is like a
    shotgun in a white man's mouth. Regardless of their good intentions, if Dead Prez were in place of Malcolm
    X in front of the pedestal, the shooters would be aiming for the mics and not their heads.</p></div>"|2530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2530-turn-off-the-radio-mixtape-vol-2-get-free-or-die-tryin/|4.1|Rollie Pemberton

There's the constant balancing of your own preferences with those of
    your bandmates, the occasional spat, and intrusive friends, family members and Yoko-esque boy/girlfriends
    are like built-in in-laws.  An onerous recording contract supplants the mortgage; fussy equipment replaces
    four-legged pets and (hopefully) two-legged babies; solo albums sit in for the ""I need some space"" weekend
    getaway to the spa.  And bands, of course, splinter for all kinds of reasons financial, creative, and
    egoistic, just like half of all modern American marriages.</p><p>
    
    So imagine playing in a band with your spouse.  It takes a certain kind of couple to enter into an artistic
    partnership without letting the conflict of marriage seep into the creative process.  And when you make your
    music the way Portland, Oregon's Kevin and Anita Robinson do-- that is, without ever leaving your living
    room-- it's hard to imagine disagreements over which songs are garbage not impacting an overdubbing session
    just a little.  Amazingly, though, the Robinsons rise above it all to pull together some ambitious and
    affecting indie pop, and <i>Lovers, Lead the Way!</i>, their second album in five years, is a relaxed,
    cohesive statement.</p><p>
    
    Though the duo does all of their own recording and production at home-- the album art features one
    especially telling shot of a mic'd amp next to the toilet-- this is not your traditional bedroom pop
    record.  Indeed, it opens with an epic swell or piano, organ and Mellotron, carried along on
    Bonham-by-way-of-the-picket-fence drumming, finally paring back to the skittering programmed drums and
    analog synths of ""Fashionably Lonely"", which features Anita's pretty, understated alto bobbing amongst
    the hazy atmospherics.</p><p>
    
    The fuzzy bass and boy/girl harmonies of ""One in Every Crowd"" are going to get Viva Voce compared to Mates
    of State on many a critic's page, and the comparison's not too far off, though the Robinsons place much
    greater emphasis on texture and layering-- not to mention Anita's exquisite guitar playing.  She reels off
    a frazzled, passionate solo on the Kevin-sung ""Red D-Lish"" over his ""Strawberry Pet Sounds Forever"" backing
    of Mellotron and clip-clopping percussion.  Kevin's other showcase, ""Brightest Part of Everyone"", is
    incredible, his chilled-out double-tracked vocal easing through a shuffling mass of electric piano, fuzz
    bass and keyboards.  The dense instrumentation gives way to nothing but Anita's angelic backing harmonies
    on the chorus, a brilliant dynamic shift that makes it one of several peaks on the album.</p><p>
    
    These two are clearly full of ideas, and they don't shy from exploring them, touching on new wave in the
    ping-ponging Moogs of ""Wrecking Ball"", prog pomposity in the towering, wah-bathed intro to ""The Tiger &amp;
    How We Tamed It"", and the morphing post-rock textures on the instrumental ""Yr Epic Heart"", which features
    busy drumming, slightly out-of-tune bells, gurgling keys and some noisy, Ira Kaplan-ish fret fireworks
    from Anita.  Closer ""Let's Bend Light"" is a noir thriller smothered in vibraphone tone clusters and ride
    cymbal, with Anita's vocals strutting through the shadows, offering impressionistic lines like, ""All that
    we wasted is time/ When we could bend light/ And shape the room.""
    
    So give credit where it's due.  The Robinsons have navigated all the potential pratfalls of making music
    with one's mate with a deft, unified hand.  <i>Lovers, Lead the Way!</i> is a fine slice of kitchen sink
    indie pop with atmosphere to spare-- this marriage begat one quiet stunner of an album.</p></div>"|8519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8519-lovers-lead-the-way/|7.6|Joe Tangari

It's possible to be both
    spontaneous and reverent.  After beginning his recording career with the intensely focused <i>Given You
    Nothing</i>, which consisted mostly of solo piano, Flim's Enrico Wuttke has loosened up and started to
    experiment. Most of the limited edition <i>Holiday Diary</i> (500 copies were pressed) was recorded in
    a single day, pieced together from field recordings and melodic fragments played by Wuttke on guitar,
    organ, piano and accordion. By definition, <i>Holiday Diary</i> was thrown together, perhaps, but there's
    something interesting at work. Wuttke has a knack for making seemingly incongruent sounds work together.</p><p>
    
    The opening ""Murmer Room"" is built around a loop of a plucked acoustic guitar, and Wuttke layers keyboard
    and percussive sounds, the random banging of a drunk navigating a darkened room. The following ""Lime"", one
    of two tracks recorded in 2001, opens with shifting chords on what sounds like a pipe organ, eerily
    evocative of Popul Vuh, and then a massive, distorted power chord shatters the meditative mood until the
    organ eventually resurfaces. ""Current Description"" is a dark and sad piano solo with just a faint wisp of
    processing, and here Wuttke's 25 years of training are apparent, as he squeezes every drop of feeling from
    the gulf-like spaces between the notes.</p><p>
<i>Holiday Diary</i> is a back-and-forth kind of record that jumps between sounds and styles, but it works.
    Shifting gears yet again, ""Above Seagulls"" displays Wuttke's oft-stated love for Talk Talk's <i>Laughing
    Stock</i>, with loose, booming drums and a circular chord structure ribbed with tension.  Then it's back
    to piano for ""Home"", a minimalist piece that could have come from Philip Glass' solo piano record. ""No
    Guitars Please"" is a short piece for accordion, and then ""Ecstatic Brown"" is a return to field recordings,
    piling identifiable scrapes and bumps with throbbing organ chords in the manner of C-Schulz &amp; Hajsch before
    releasing the tension by folding in a delicate piano melody.</p><p>
    
    Kid606 and his ilk brag of being able to make an album in one night, but <i>Holiday Diary</i> is different.
    It feels like a backlog of ideas assembled quickly for posterity, yes, but somehow the slapdash nature of
    the project seems perfect. It feels organic, simultaneously random and unified. I'm not going to call Wuttke
    a genius, but after hearing three albums I will say that his music is unusually fresh and unique. Who else
    is combining the most trad acoustic sound possible (untreated piano) with heavy electronics?  His music
    is generally serious with a faint whiff of academia, but Wuttke keeps his eye on the ball and moves to
    maximize the effectiveness of each individual track.  And most importantly, he sounds like no one else,
    which, these days, counts for a lot.</p></div>"|3102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3102-holiday-diary/|7.3|Mark Richardson

Lead vocalist/principal     songwriter Chris Barth channels an austere lyrical sensibility that harkens back to the best of England's     Romantic Period poets, and <i>We Like It Wild</i>, the more cohesive and accomplished statement of the two     records, finds the band running their psychedelic-to-folk-pop gamut in effortless stride; the sound often     bleeds true British Invasion. Previous releases have drawn comparisons to the Elephant 6 collective,     Pavement, and Robert Pollard, but their sound has yet to remain stagnant long enough to really pin it     down to any map or timetable.  If anything, their closest contemporaries range from the quirky indie-smart     jangle pop of Versus to the sweeping pastoral and rustic tones of the Fruit Bats.</p>
<p>The Shapes' continued evolution is manifest in the disparity between the shifty <i>Bless the Headless</i> and the conditioned <i>We Like It Wild</i>; the first finding release in March and the latter in October.     Perhaps the only connective ligaments are the band's reluctance to settle into any scripted role, and     Barth's affinity for serene, vernal poetics and autumnal imagery.  Both albums are rife with lyrical     references to rolling hills, trees, creeks, dirty knees and breezes, and delivered in direct couplets or     simply rhymed tercets.  A spiritual, almost ritual, awareness of mortality along with meditative accounts     of pastoral tranquility bedaub the Spartan narratives-- though the fairy-tale fever that sweats through     <i>Bless the Headless</i> is a bit shiftier, paralleling the less vigilant song structures of the album.</p>
<p>""Play with Me"" restlessly jerks its way through an octagonal pop structure, epitomizing the band's quirky     and amorphous arrangements.  As playful as its namesake, the song shifts and spins through several     enchanting melodies and polyrhythmic beats.  Either a subdued rocker or an ambitious dirge, carried by     subtly propulsive drum timings and rhythmic guitars, it manages to center itself with a unique immediacy     and vision. ""Bathing Swans"", with a bit more of a jam-bent, comes in with ""Love is here and hope is gone/     We must cry for the bathing swans."" It's distinctively Wordsworthian (or even Blake-like) in tone, as are     much of both albums' lyrical stylings.  Album highlights include the multiplicities of ""Good to Lie"" and     ""A Final Feast Forever"", a daring carnivalesque pop number with a beautiful crescendo of melody, keys and     percussion.  Also, ""Always the Way"" turns on a dime from pinpoint melody to aimless meandering, and     succeeds unqualifiably in the process.  However, their more spacey and digressive numbers (""Kids Need     Clerks"", ""The Line So Flexible"") too often recall a basement-jam band.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>We Like It Wild</i> are more focused and fully realized. ""Give Me a Note"" limps in with a     Velvet Underground-flavored murky, rain-soaked serenity.  ""The Perfect Timing"", host to a guitar line     similar to post-millennial Built to Spill, begins a set of expertly crafted pop songs, sometimes riding     bareback galloping rhythms, and sometimes toeing the line with crisp, jangled guitar lines.  ""Sharing Our     Space"" delightfully showcases Barth's fey voice over a lively rhythm on a multitracked vocal melody and     lines such as, ""I turn away glad, glory be/ And be blessed to befriend a sugar tree/ Sharing our space     aligned,"" before giving way to a tastefully key-adorned instrumental outro.  ""Two Be Wild"", a more subdued     song with serene acoustics, sits patiently in the middle of the album with understatement as an anchor,     and finally, ""Lovers Living Uphill"", the closer, lets loose but reigns itself back in with a gorgeous     propulsive melody that settles from a dust cloud of instrumental indulgence.  The rest of the record is     mostly fit with variegated structures within any single track, but the songs rarely lose control as they     sometimes did on <i>Bless the Headless</i>. Shifty, nervous, and relentless, each track packs its own     reward, and many are carried on the strength of the aforementioned British Invasion guitar-driven bent.</p>
<p>In all, <i>We Like It Wild</i> better frames The Impossible Shapes' structural wanderlust, and pockets     several more linear arrangements to buoy the end result.  Truly, selecting a weak track could prove     relatively laborious.  If the band has a weakness, it's likely the lack of true depth or grit: the album     runs a similar course to The Shins' <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i> but can't carry an emotional load as heavy.     Though all finely balanced, their mercurial song structures rarely claw deep enough to grow roots; a     gentle breeze, a quick sneeze, a lit match, and they're gone.  But despite its ephemeral beauty, <i>We     Like It Wild</i> is a formidable accomplishment and solid effort throughout.  If you smoke Indie-Lites,     and have a taste for this sort of thing, you might consider switching brands.</p></div>"|11759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11759-bless-the-headless-we-like-it-wild/|6.7|William Morris

    Black Keys when I proclaim: there is a white blues. Its distinguishing characteristic: tinny anxiety. David
    Dondero stands a good chance of being canonized by the white-blues scholarbots of the next fiscal millennium,
    though he's currently just one of the genre's migrant laborers, helping to polish the statues of several of
    his agitated ancestors and impatient contemporaries (Townes Van Zandt, Gordon Gano, and Simon Joyner, for
    starters).</p><p>
    
    STANDARD: White blues boasts its own possessed forefather: Daniel Johnston fills the Robert Johnson role.
    FULFILLMENT: Dondero can shiver on a Johnstonian scale.  STANDARD: White blues requires frantically scraped
    chords alienated from their folk, gospel, and rump-shaking roots.  FULFILLMENT: Dondero's uptempo work
    suggests a one-man Sebadoh (that's heyday Sebadoh) and holds him a spot in the alphabetized archives after
    Billy Bragg and Chickasaw Mudd Puppies. STANDARD: White blues self-consciously meta-acknowledges its newbie
    fraudulence as a genre. FULFILLMENT: Dondero poses about journeyman posturing and sings about the woe-joys
    of songwriting.</p><p>
    
    Aware that he's working in what can be a prestigeless idiom, Dondero performs with the who-wants-some aplomb
    of a masochistic busker. Aware that the sensitive vagabond songwriter shtick can devolve into an embarrassing
    piss-contest (during which the acousti-messiahs may as well claim total elephantitis of the heart: ""I can
    feel the suffering of a jaundiced stepchild three states away"" versus ""I was sensing disturbances in the
    force back when Alec Guinness was Ewan McGregor playing paddycake on Liam Neeson's lap""), Dondero is careful
    (on ""Less Than the Air"") to offer an invective against such wallowing: ""You're not the only one who got
    caught in the rain/ This whole world don't revolve around your pain.""</p><p>
    
    As smart and as likable and as good at maintaining white-blues tumultuousness as Dondero is, the listener
    will still have difficulty pinpointing what makes this collection singular, despite its all-star supporting
    cast, including producer Mike Mogis, keys by Wolf Colonel, backup vocals by Conor Oberst, and Tiffany Kowalski's
    violin lending gypsy tinges of Desire (except for the exuberant ""The Stars Are My Chandelier"", which she
    helps to launch into Tall Dwarfs-land). Maybe this guy ought to hire outside lyricists, because his
    arrangements pack so much more wallop than his words, which are often too explanatory, as if Dondero
    didn't trust the strength of his images and observations. Do we need to be told on the first song that
    he plays ""the skinny indie white boy blues"" when the third song conjures such blinding shades of pale?
    I will think, sympathetically, of Dondero whenever I pass an abandoned minivan on the interstate.</p></div>"|2528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2528-the-transient/|6.6|William Bowers

    was a fragile triumph effectively mixing brooding melodrama and frantic rock bombast, but while the album's
    music was inspiring, it was no match for the ensuing mythology.  Yes, a band named Explosions in the Sky
    did release a record the day before there were, quite literally, explosions in the sky on September 11th.
    Yes, the album did have a track called ""This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow"".  However, it also came as a
    devastating obstacle for Explosion's music, as even music-snob bastards like myself needed something a

    Place</i>, comes as quite a revelation.  While the album still exhibits the ominous melodrama of <i>Those
    Who Tell the Truth</i>, <i>The Earth</i> is a much warmer affair.  Even the title, with its emphasis on the word ""not,"" seems
    laced with an intense yearning for optimism in the face of horrific circumstance.  The inside sleeve of the
    outstanding album art depicts a sketch of lifeless autumnal leaf wistfully tumbling in the air, only to
    transform into the body of a fluttering dove.  In other words, this is about as close as indie rock gets
    to an intentionally ""post-9/11"" album.</p><p>
    
    One of the most impressive aspects of <i>The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place</i> is that it feels constantly
    in flux, growing and transforming with every note.  While this achievement would be notable in any genre,
    in the ceaselessly masturbatory realm of post/indie/prog-rock (really folks, let's just call it ""music""),
    where bands either take far too long to arrive anywhere (Godspeed You! Black Emperor), or just don't have
    anyplace special to go (Mogwai), bands that avoid both seem increasingly rare finds.</p><p>
    
    The record's opening track, the aptly titled ""First Breath After Coma"", serves as the perfect testament to
    this art-rock mastery.  It begins with a single lilting electric guitar note, miming the incessant nerve-wracking
    electrical beeps of a hospital heart monitor.  As the shimmering guitar note settles into a steady groove,
    the echoing thump of a bass drum organically rises out of the shadowy mix, playing the pensive ""lub-dub""
    rhythm of a human heart.  Each rhythmic line of the guitar and the drums gently coerce one another, cautiously
    teasing and intertwining until each one explodes into their own new forms; the electric guitar note gives
    birth to an incessant army of sparkling guitar melodies, while the calming bass drum motif morphs into the
    rollicking snare attack of a traditional marching beat; and this is all within the first four minutes!</p><p>
    
    The only disappointing aspect of <i>The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place</i> is its lack of more diversified
    instrumentation.  While each of the record's five tracks is given its own title, trying to pick one out
    from another can be difficult.  The tumbling meditative guitar melody that opens ""Six Days at the Bottom
    of the Ocean"", for instance, seems so reliant upon the feverish guitar freakout that closes ""The Only
    Moment We Were Alone"" that any track separation would spoil the spotless evolutionary vibe.  The band
    themselves had to have realized this fact, as they list the tracks on the back of the album buried within
    a blurry din of verbiage having their lengthy album title spelled out ad-nauseum.  In this context, by its
    tail end, Explosion's limiting bass, drums, and double guitar line-up becomes an increasing hindrance.</p><p>
    
    With this album, Explosions in the Sky have constructed a sweetly melodic, inspirationally hopeful album
    for a genre whose trademark is tragedy.  For the astute listener, under the CD tray, amongst the illustrated
    scattered leaves, lies the answer to the album's desperately optimistic title; it reads ""Because You Are
    Listening.""  It serves as a poignant parting sentiment from a band whose music is as dramatic as finding
    hope.</p></div>"|2879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2879-the-earth-is-not-a-cold-dead-place/|7.7|Hartley Goldstein

I lived there for four years, just like hundreds of thousands of student-aged people,
    and suffice to say I became attached to the city.  There's something about the way the sports fans were
    still fanatical about teams that never won championships, the way you can walk pretty much anywhere, the
    uneven streets that don't conform to a grid pattern in the slightest, the bridge measured in Smoots, and
    the relatively short buildings that just made me feel at home.</p><p>
    And then there was the music scene.  I've heard the whole range of comments on the music scene in Boston,
    from ""it's awful"" to ""it's wicked good,"" and I fall somewhere toward the latter opinion.  Boston gets tons
    of good shows, all reliably falling in a few choice venues, the <i>Phoenix</i> gets the word out admirably
    (for free, no less), and there are about a hundred hardcore scenesters you can bet will be at any show you
    turn up at (I knew most of them by sight, none of them by name).  And of course, Boston turns out crop
    after crop of great leftfield bands, going back to The Standells in the 60s, The Modern Lovers and The Cars
    in the 70s, Mission of Burma, The Pixies and Treat Her Right in the 80s, and Morphine and The Dambuilders
    (Hawaiian transplants though they were) in the 90s.</p><p>
    Maybe it's just all the academics in the air, but the Boston/Cambridge area produces a hugely disproportionate
    number of artsy pop bands for its population.  I always tried to show up early to shows so I could catch
    locals like The Fly Seville, Baby Ray, Apollo Sunshine, and these guys, Hip Tanaka.  I first caught them
    on a local bill with a couple bands I've forgotten about, and their spiky blender pop hooked me right as
    I was walking in the door.</p><p>
    Their debut album, <i>The Sky Is Smaller Than the Sea</i>, had them coming off like a punkier They Might Be
    Giants, and it's kept its place on my shelves after a couple of moves.  <i>Splinter</i> is the band's third
    full-length, and it actually shows their attention spans getting shorter, smashing most of its songs into
    durations of well under three minutes.</p><p>
    Oddly, they kick the album off with the weakest track, the nebulous warm-up of ""Ready or Not"", but slide
    into their groove nicely on the second song, the spastic explosion of melody called ""Heart Attacks &amp;
    Autographs"".  The songs get gradually better as the disc spins on, too, and by the time you get past the
    halfway point and into the rubber rhythms of ""6,000,000,000 (And Counting)"", they're pounding out the tight,
    layered pop with seemingly little effort.  ""Dr. Highway"" splashes loose harmonies over chunky riffs and
    melodic bass, occasionally slipping into a beat that wants to be disco, but never takes the full plunge.
    They manage to cram a lot into the song's three minutes and change, including a slamming electronic bridge
    full of buzzing sawtooth waves and bleeping noises.</p><p>
    ""Heyday"" is the true highlight, though, with its stacks of vocals and careening guitar parts.  The a capella
    break in the middle is full of claustrophobic tension, but the chorus smashes down the walls and insinuates
    itself into the very fiber of your being before the layers peel back for the exposed denouement.  It's 3\xBD
    minutes of freakish pop perfection that's just as challenging as it is catchy.  And that's really the
    strength of Hip Tanaka-- their music approaches you on what seem like your terms, and then abruptly pelts
    you with a hail of curve balls.  With <i>Splinter</i>, Hip Tanaka provide just enough of a pop furnace
    blast to keep you wanting more.  Things look as good as ever in Boston.</p></div>"|3876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3876-splinter/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    from library shelves and re-copying whole paragraphs in their own wobbly hands, desperate to make the
    prose seem more accessible, more indigenous, more possible.  Or see them as liberators, granting dusty,
    half-functional songs a contemporary glow, revising and updating and bestowing precious relevance, digging
    through the past for muddy, uncut gems.  Or understand them as stubbornly embryonic garage trios that just
    didn't feel like writing anymore of their own stuff last weekend, proudly rolling out Zeppelin tracks and
    Radiohead B-sides and sixteen stupid, confounded versions of ""All Along The Watchtower"".  But, however you
    choose to interpret these bands, do not deride the cover song: yes, they <i>can</i> be underwhelming and
    lazily executed, but mediocrity is not inherent to the form.</p><p>
    
    On the smugly titled <i>Songs We Should Have Written</i>, ever-clever NYC ensemble Firewater sponge
    brilliant songs from brilliant songwriters (Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black"", Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison
    Blues"", Tom Waits' ""Diamonds and Gold"", The Beatles' ""Hey Bulldog""), and crib other cuts originally written
    specifically for non-songwriters (the mostly spoken ""Is That All There Is?"", immortalized by Peggy Lee, or
    ""Some Velvet Morning"", long owned by Nancy Sinatra). The band's approach is classic admiration-marred-by-envy:
    most of these versions are instantly recognizable, despite being slowed down, sped up, or re-arranged, and
    Firewater's renditions are faithful, if a little caustic-- re-imagined but not always more convincing.</p><p>
    
    As a band, Firewater consists of musicians who, generally, are better known for their previous projects:
    former Cop Shoot Cop bassist Tod Ashley leads the collective, which has, at various points, also featured
    Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion multi-instrumentalist Kurt Hoffman, and
    Elysian Fields vocalist Jennifer Charles.  Given the members' own echoing reputations, Firewater's decision
    to release a record featuring exclusively cover songs is sorta funny.  Still, <i>Songs We Should Have
    Written</i> is an interesting hop forward for the band, whose last full-length, 2003's <i>The Man on the
    Burning Tightrope</i>, was mucked up by its calliope-riddled burlesque theatrics, a throbbing, Waits-ian
    stew of accordion-heavy Mexploitation excess.</p><p>
    
    Here, the broth is thinned out: ""Folsom Prison Blues"" opens with a clip of Cash bellowing ""Hello!"" and
    slips into warbling organ and honking guitars, Ashley's wildman holler keeping Cash's spirit afloat.
    ""Paint It Black"" is laboriously decelerated (a trick the Stones themselves occasionally employed) and
    haunted by sitar, with Ashley's low, loping chant eventually becoming starkly menacing.  ""The Beat Goes
    On"" maintains playful Sonny &amp; Cher flirtation, with Ashley and Charles trading off on vocals, whispering
    and cooing at each other over a thick foundation of keyboard and drums.  Indeed, no matter how you finally
    decide to quantify the artistic merit of performing a cover, <i>Songs We Should Have Written</i> proves
    Firewater perfectly adept at the game of masquerade.</p></div>"|3072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3072-songs-we-should-have-written/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

When she plays drums or guitar, or
    worst of all, when she breaks out the ukulele, she persists with mechanical patience, switching chords
    like she's just getting the knack, and rendering some pretty decent lyrics in either a sing-song or a
    monotone.  The plainness of it all is disarming, and not in a good way: it's like a child who's just
    stopped being cute.  And that's not even counting the crayon-and-marker-colored liner notes.</p><p>
<i>""Gimme a T!  Gimme an R!  Gimme a U!  Gimme a C!  Gimme a K!  For truckers!""</i></p><p>
    
    Around the eighth time she sings, ""I am an emergency vehicle,"" you wonder if anything's wrong, yet nothing
    here points to a crisis or problem-- in fact, this is some of the most transparently confident music around.
    Instead of giving us a mystery or asking us to psychoanalyze her, she seems to be striking out boldly,
    expecting us to take her as-is.  Or, as she puts it in the liner notes: ""I'm not a dreamer. I make things
    happen.  I also coach.""</p><p>
    
    What seems so weird may just be the simplicity of her style, how ur-punk her tools are-- the lack of colors,
    the bare singing, and the use of repetition all suggest that any additional instrumentation or melody or
    anything other than the most starkly minimal elements would be an excess.  Granted, Niblett occasionally
    receives some support from another guitarist and drummer, but even they seem to value sparseness, and more
    often than not, they're nowhere to be found anyway: most of <i>I Am</i> consists simply of Scout alone with
    an instrument, singing in that folky-dry British voice that has mostly been commended for how American it
    sounds.  And Steve Albini-- the perfect engineer for this project-- captures her in perfect, quiet solitude.</p><p>
<i>I Am</i>, though more settled than her crazed singing and amateur drum-bashing on the <i>I Conjure
    Series</i> EP, is still pretty far from the minimal but warmly bluesy <i>Sweet Heart Fever</i>.  On
    ""Drummer Boy"", the guitars fall like an avalanche, but other tracks are so focused they become faintly
    desperate: she gets some yearning tones from her ukulele, buried under the annoying ones.  As for the
    lyrics, they reveal more subtlety than you infer from her singing.  ""Texas"", for one, is rather elegant
    with its ""postcard from an art school girlfriend"" language: ""And Texas is hot/ Even when driving at night/
    And Texas is sci-fi/ And Texas is plain/ And Texas is alright"", each verse punctuated by a whomp on the
    drums.</p><p>
    
    This record is definitely an acquired taste, but what you get is an appreciation for a difficult but
    ultimately honest artist, stripped out of the ""rock"" or ""country"" labels into a private cave of her own--
    like anything that wasn't 100% Scout got cut and thrown away, and whether you like what's left, at least
    you know it's hers.  This kind of record is no fun to rate, because where I'd want a little more <i>anything</i>
    (more developed songs, maybe, or a little more emotional range in these parched-earth vocals), I know that
    others will be hit in the gut by every weird little tune on this album.  Like any kind of nakedness, it's
    up to you how to take it.</p></div>"|5786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5786-i-am/|6.8|Chris Dahlen

With underground rap constantly evolving and splintering
    into immediately intriguing subgenres, the formerly ultra-popular white spoken-word rap movement has lost
    itself in a less than constructive manner. The lackluster nature of recent releases from previous vanguards
    Dose One and Sole have proven to cement the negative stigma inherent in the scattershot abstract indie rap
    arena. Having such strikes against his character from the outset, The Listener's debut solo record,
    <i>Whispermoon</i>, begins fighting against preconception at its outset and closes with less than
    satisfactory results.</p><p>
    
    Comparisons to his influences are obvious from his opening prose. Standing as a vocal amalgam of MacLethal
    and Alias, instant issues arise from his monotone delivery and a low vocal mix reminiscent of early Qwel
    on most tracks. Lyrically, The Listener is Sole without the charisma, hurling word salad manifestos about
    conversation with train station vagrants, underground financial hierarchy and the importance of metaphorical
    doors with little variation or impressive metaphors. His delivery tends to be a little dry and awkward, but
    his conceptual balance helps to equalize any issues you may have with his vocals. Simply put, The Listener
    is more slam poet than emcee.</p><p>
    
    The saving grace of <i>Whispermoon</i> is its varied production. Instead of struggling over abstract drum
    arrangements or harsh synth lines, The Listener gets his message across best through rock-solid mid-90s
    boom-bap and modern sample tricks.  Handled mainly by Dust and Gruntwork, the production varies from the
    distant horn and stuttered strings of ""You're So Underground"" to the sunny guitar, high vocal sample and
    curled bassline of ""Train Song"" to the wind chimes, whirling synth and lonely piano of ""Ways of the Wind"",
    utilizing a dark palette of sounds for both ambient and diamond-hard purposes.</p><p>
    
    While housing a couple poorly sequenced beats and several pointlessly esoteric displays of poetic lyricism,
    The Listener manages to entertain on many levels, displaying obvious talent that, if centered across a
    similar style of incredibly subtle backdrops with more focused verse structure and a deeper portfolio of
    rhyme schemes, he could be held in the highest esteem of a relatively uninteresting facet of underground
    hip-hop.  It's his potential to develop a sound that attracts artists from various schools of hip-hop that
    makes for a bright future in the world of abstract introspective rap.</p></div>"|4956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4956-whispermoon/|6.6|Rollie Pemberton

He's fashioned as a forlorn knight of yore on this record's cover,
    brandishing a three-foot iron sword, and shrouded in medieval battle armor.  But this image misleads:
    <i>Want One</i> is more a drove casting of arrows than any detailed fencing bout with mythical demons
    and fire-breathing dragons.  The record is something of cinematic effort, composed of roughly half of
    the material recorded over the course of six months' studio time that yielded thirty-odd products of
    his unique musical vision. A follow-up, <i>Want Two</i>, is scheduled for future release, and is said
    to boast the set's more adventurous and cumbersome confections.</p><p>
    
    A Renaissance man in modern application, Wainwright's grand scope here covers a great deal of space and
    unwittingly mines the ground dug out by many a contemporary artist.  With multitracked vocals and lush,
    complex arrangements (both, Wainwright staples), the ghost of Brian Wilson seems a ubiquitous presence--
    especially on numbers such as ""Vicious World"", where Rufus' plaintive, appealing croon takes center stage,
    backed by a chorus of his own likeness and a finely tuned, direct arrangement.  ""Movies of Myself"", with
    its straight-ahead bounce, drum-led clip, and aberrant guitar crunch, recalls Jason Faulkner.  ""14th
    Street"" is a Jim Croce chorus-line cabaret burlesque, and ""Natasha"" loosely tunes in to early Paul
    Simon-inflected tribute-narratives.</p><p>
    
    But to say Wainwright is following anything but his own vision would be a misconception.  His footsteps
    mostly lead him back to his earlier cabaret-infused theatre pop and maudlin, hushed anti-ballads. The
    result is a top-heavy album, with his best material-- the more operatic and unconstrained works-- all
    unfolded within the album's first half hour.  ""Oh What a World"" opens the album with a tuba's reluctant
    elephant steps and some acoustic plucks, and slowly trickles in a full concert's worth of accompaniment
    before deploying a string rendition of Ravel's <i>Bolero</i> behind Wainwright's plaintive warble.</p><p>
    
    ""I Don't Know What It Is"" follows in with a slow building, twinkling pop sensibility, carrying his most
    melodic vocal punch.  ""Go or Go Ahead"", the album's most compelling portrait, falls in like fine China
    crashing to the ground in slow motion, reaching an epic chorus that carries the song just shy of the
    seven-minute mark. The lyrics carry mythological grandeur, but as with the rest of this album, they're
    shot through with vulnerability and emotional nudity.</p><p>
    
    ""Vibrate"", then, marks the album's low water mark, taking his stream-of-consciousness, take-me-as-I-am
    drama too far: Over thin instrumental accompaniment and languished tones he sings, ""My phone's on vibrate
    for you/ Electroclash is karaoke, too/ I try to dance Britney Spears/ I guess I'm getting on in years.""
    This, along with ""Natasha"", ""Pretty Things"", and ""Want"" are simply too sparse to offer any real substance.
    But then ""Beautiful Child"" cuts in, sounding, before the mix becomes too cluttered, like Wainwright fronting
    an inspired, experimental U2.  Perhaps there is a battle going on here: It sometimes feels like Wainwright
    is merely fighting his way through inspiration, unable to put anything aside.  And between the scrambling
    and shifty vulnerability, he stumbles onto something that is uniquely his own.  But if there's any momentum
    to speak of leading into this album's sequel, it's the anchoring weight of <i>Want One</i>'s second half,
    without which the record could survive itself.</p></div>"|8558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8558-want-one/|6.9|William Morris

    incoherence, and abominable analogies.  The body beneath Portishead, Smith DJs with the passion and naivete
    of someone who covets popular music like it's about to marry his son and cruelly tempt him for the rest of
    eternity. When someone loves pop culture this much, quality is an afterthought, an extravagance that can
    only be afforded to imaginary people who have heard everything.</p><p>
    
    Smith knows the number of pop songs you can filter over krush grooves and plush pop is infinite, and
    goddamn it, he's going to get in as many of those sprightly lunatic anthems as he can.  As a result, he
    also balefully refuses to discern the appalling from the appealing. If there are flaws here, they're the
    flaws of ceaseless ambition.  Smith reaches dizzying heights of Top 40 splendor and underground abysses--
    and he keeps on going, without respite, handling, or guidance. The enthusiasm is infectious. We might
    almost call it cute if we weren't afraid Rakim and Kool Keith would come strangle us with our own
    backhanded compliments.</p><p>
    
    There are two ways to understand this mix.  Both are inaccurate and reconciliation is impossible.  First,
    it's fundamentally a hip-hop album, suffused with rolling, reverberating funk guitars and its fuzz keyboards
    always supplemented by riotous, exasperating shouts and clamors, like a Pentecostal church built on lunar
    breaks.  The selections range from Mr. Lif's sordid ""The Unorthodox"" to Black Sheep's goof-hop bass-in-the-attic
    classic ""The Choice Is Yours"".  The second way is to realize that this is an album that starts with Kate
    Bush and romps through blue-eyed soul, grandfather swing and prog before plummeting straight into what could
    be the worst version of ""Fire"" I've ever heard.  It also concludes with the most beguiling, tumultuous,
    archetypal, somewhat pathetic pop song of the 60s, Barbara Acklin's ""Am I the Same Girl?"", including
    everything that title would assume: anticipatory love lyrics occasionally delivered in a queasy falsetto,
    distracting background vocals, and the passion of the singer without any of the passion of the song itself.
    Needless to say, a far cry from a critical breakdown.</p><p>
    
    Don't even try to figure this out; you'll only hurt yourself in the process. Just ascribe it to some sort
    of ironic or ""kitsch"" intention and we can all go home, right? This isn't new territory at all for Smith,
    or for DJ mixes in general. Portishead fashioned their sound by rolling torch songs and jazz ballads into
    fragile gutter-soaked blunts. But whereas on 1998's <i>The Document</i> swinging from Marvin Gaye to Tom
    Jones just felt manipulative and contemptible to everyone involved, the new album sounds like someone who
    quite honestly thinks Mr. Lif could segue into Three Dog Night, a band so antithetical to hip-hop their
    last ""rap battle"" was with Neil Diamond. Or from the toasters, screeches, and epileptogenic bop of DJ
    Bombjack's ""Big Beat No. 3"" to the greatest jungle-noir French pop song ever, Serge Gainsbourg's ""Requiem
    Pour un Con"".  It's a persuasive argument that all music was hip-hop, whether a particular genre knew it
    or not.</p><p>
    
    Of course, this should all be predicated on quality to begin with. If you're mixing James Brown, Kate Bush,
    and Rakim, it's almost scandalous to make people suffer through Boca 45, Sugarman 3, and other bands so
    unoriginal they had to plagiarize the names of integers. It's not particularly terrible, but if a mix is
    all about momentum, these guys are a station wagon's break system.  Five by Five's ""Fire"" has got to be the
    only recorded version known to replace the guitar solos with kazoo. Within the context of the album, it's
    a bit like seeing Woodstock open for the neighborhood garage band.</p><p>
    
    But then, I just compared half the album to Woodstock, which is about as tenuous and exciting an analogy as
    anything Smith tries to (or succeeds in) drawing up musically. Smith's actual DJ skills are impeccable and,
    like all good DJs and governments, virtually imperceptible. He thinks the girth and grit of hip-hop can
    accommodate the sorrow and sanguinity of old soul 45s without the imposition of irrelevant scratching or
    vain attempts to show why a DJ can be permitted his vanity. Pop music is the bounteous land of elfin

    by the excess, a martyr to the street and the sublime stupidity of pop history.</p></div>"|2349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2349-the-document-ii/|7.0|Andy Linhardt

    revival when it finally comes back around.  Sort of a J Mascis type (he even has the hair!), the British
    multi-instrumentalist writes all The Bevis Frond's material; he sings and plays just about every instrument
    on his albums, engineers and produces them, and then releases them on his and Adrian Shaw's Woronzow label,
    named after a street near where he grew up. Which, for rock history's sake, was close to Abbey Road.</p><p>
    
    Despite his control-freak tendencies, Saloman comes off as an affable guy without the stoner ego of a guy
    like Mascis.  For starters, he's got major collaborators and not paint-by-numbers cronies feeding off his
    aura. Most notable is Adrian Shaw (ex-Hawkwind, Magic Muscle, Tom Rapp, etc), who's stuck by Saloman since
    The Bevis Frond's 1984 inception.  In concert, Saloman handles guitar and vocals while Shaw takes the bass;
    a rotating lineup of drummers-- which on any given day might include Andy Ward (ex-Camel and Marillion) or
    Joe Propatire (The Silver Apples)-- expand the percussion outward.</p><p>
    
    As of deadline, Saloman's released 16 albums, plus innumerable collaborations, singles, and one-offs.  One
    of his earlier works, <i>New River Head</i>, was first issued in edited form in 1991. This reissued version
    takes the opposite route: It includes 30 songs spanning two hours and two CDs, restores the six tracks cut
    from the 1991 version, and tacks on nine new bonus tracks.</p><p>
    
    Beginning with the prerecorded sounds of an old-school British announcer, <i>New River Head</i> wastes no
    time shifting from ho-hum sampling to blistering guitar work. The first proper track, an instrumental called
    ""White Sun"", includes the saxophone of Cyke Bancroft (who's illustrated some of The Bevis Frond's album
    sleeves) alongside Nick Saloman's nuanced riff. The same style comes up in ""Solar Marmalade"", a studio jam
    that hits a peak early and remains at that level until the end of its eight-minute run.</p><p>
    
    ""He'd Be a Diamond"", a pop song about guys treating girls like shit, has been covered by everyone from Mary
    Lou Lord (well, obviously) to Juliana Hatfield and Teenage Fanclub.  Here, on the original, Saloman croons
    like Elvis Costello: his voice has often resembled old Four Eyes, but here the structure also follows
    Costello's pop path.  The protracted ""God Speed You to Earth"" is a dramatic landscape of echoey vocals and
    gentle strums culminating as pure rock bliss, while ""Thankless Task"" serves as Saloman's attempt at writing
    a traditional folk song with more contemporary themes: ""I felt the image of a damaged hippie chick was more
    identifiable than, say, a wronged milkmaid.""  The result?  An upbeat tale that would sound at home on an
    Incredible String Band album.</p><p>
    
    With a band this expansive and virtuosic, it's interesting to chart the interactions on the inevitable
    lengthy freakout. ""The Miskatonic Variations II"" weighs in at a mind-altering 16:23, but it sure makes
    an adequate bridge to the bonus tracks.  The dozy atmospheric includes Adrian Shaw, Bari Watts, Current
    93's David Tibet, Cyke Bancroft, and Barry Dransfield.  Almost new age in its arrested entrance, piano,
    violin, horn and Tibet's creepy chants lead into Carlos Santana-esque guitars, rock-out drums, and, yeah,
    a full-on mind-melt.  Structurally, it's the songs that came before joining together for a final bow.</p><p>
    
    I was a youngster when <i>New River Head</i> first dropped, and though I wouldn't consider myself a manic
    fan of The Frond, the other day I tallied nine of the band's records in my collection. Some are less
    interesting than others, sure, but each is at least somewhat compelling due to Saloman's inclination to
    forever fuck with psychedelic conventions and tackle diverse genres without a hitch.  Within such an
    impressive body of work, <i>New River Head</i> is certainly the crown jewel.  One of the headier
    agglomerations of the past decade, its non-grasping pace and epic palette issue the breezy confidence
    of an unmistakable classic.</p></div>"|685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/685-new-river-head/|9.1|Brandon Stosuy

    the awful, novelty-loaded <i>Fight Test</i> EP.  But while <i>Ego Tripping</i> doesn't correct all of
    <i>Fight Test</i>'s misgivings (would somebody please convince these guys to include the damn <i>Yoshimi</i>
    outtakes already?), it does contain four inspired new originals.  One of these, ""Assassination of the Sun"",
    opens the album with the Lips sounding the loosest they have since <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>.  As Wayne
    Coyne's earnest tenor sings of millions of stars forming into a sun and machines that churn out pain, a
    breezy rolling drum break drives the song forward alongside floating piano chords and wiry bucolic guitar
    lines.</p><p>
    
    The track proves not to be a fluke: the two originals that follow it, the interestingly titled instrumental
    ""I'm a Fly in a Sunbeam (Following the Funeral Procession of a Stranger)"" and the interstellar sex romp
    ""Sunship Balloons"" equally make good on the meticulously layered, languid atmospherics and anime-inspired,
    metaphysical pop promise of their last two full-lengths.  ""I'm a Fly in a Sunbeam"" sets a serene horn
    solo against a pulsating backbeat, mellow piano chords and organ drone, drenched in a bath of aquatic
    reverb.  ""Sunship Balloons"" is even better: over an insistently bouncy chopped-up drum break and
    sparkling electric guitars, Coyne gives up the first Flaming Lips R&amp;B; slow jam, spitting come-ons like,
    ""Let's do it once/ Let's do it twice/ Let's do it alllll niiiiight until the sunrise comes too soon.""</p><p>
    
    Following the strength of the leading triplet of originals, the middle section of the EP all-too-predictably
    consists of filler.  The remix of ""Do You Realize?"" is the most disappointing, given that it's produced by
    Jimmy Tamborello of Dntel and Postal Service fame.  He takes the original vocal melody of the song and
    centers it atop a jerky IDM synth beat while laying a straightforwardly boring drum-n-bass break over the
    chorus.  The first remix for ""Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell"", produced by Jason Bentley, would be right
    at home on <i>Fight Test</i>, stripping the introspective planetary pop of the original and recasting the
    track as a 1994 chillout track.  The second ""Ego Tripping"" remix, by Blow-Up Aka Paolo Cilione and Claudio
    Camaione, fares only slightly better (though it would've had to have been a total catastrophe to not) with
    its pounding bass drum pulse, laconic rimshot clicks, and wandering tinny electronic pings and pangs giving
    way to irrepressibly motivating electro-rhythms.</p><p>
    
    The EP closes with Wayne Coyne's frank plea for world peace via protest-song-cum-Christmas-ditty, ""A Change
    at Christmas (Say It Isn't So)"".  And it's not as bad as you might expect-- if anyone can pull sentimental
    rubbish like this off in 2003 without sounding like a total jackass it's Coyne, who quixotically asserts:
    ""If I could stop time it would be for a moment just around Christmas, when mankind reveals its truest
    potential.""  Okay, it's a <i>bit</i> Miss America Pageant, but Coyne's hopeful daydreams are clearly
    sincere, and dipped in fantastical accompaniment by his fellow bandmates; sparkling triangle and xylophone
    notes drizzle down from above the optimistic ring of hefty piano chords, all held together by a mischievous
    drumbreak.</p><p>
    
    Granted, the new material on <i>Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell</i> doesn't exactly show the band's sound
    evolving, but then, they've pretty much perfected it: ""Assassination of the Sun"" and ""I'm a Fly in the
    Sunbeam"" in particular would have added another substantial round to <i>Yoshimi</i>'s dreampop arsenal,
    and the others, despite their slightly oddball lyrics, show the band in top form musically.  Put simply:
    Any fan would be thrilled if their next record sounded like this.  Still, I'm not sure why the Lips feel
    obligated to toss in substandard remixes (it's certainly not going to get them club play).  Had they cut
    those from the disc-- or seen fit to include the <i>Yoshimi</i> originals available only on the newly
    released $20+ Deluxe Edition &amp; DVD version of the album-- it would have made a much more fluid listen.
    But with the record degenerating into anonymous techno halfway through, it feels less like a unified
    piece than an overpriced just-in-time-for-the-holidays moneymaker.</p></div>"|3085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3085-ego-tripping-at-the-gates-of-hell-ep/|7.0|Hartley Goldstein

    Usually packed fat with studio scraps, bits of live shows, dubious band experiments, covers, and a mess of
    other shit that doesn't quite fit anywhere else, outtakes discs are typically devised as a boon for completists,
    assembled without the internal and temporal cohesion of an album, and delivered to the public with minimal
    ceremony.  Check the outtakes disc as the musical equivalent of a Sunday morning yard sale: a row of rickety
    folding tables overstocked with dusty, aging crap that was deemed too valuable to toss blindly, but not
    considered functional enough to keep around.  Staple a construction paper sign to the nearest telephone
    pole, drag a rusty plastic lawn chair out from the garage, and sell every last thing for a dollar.</p><p>
    
    Irish folk-rockers The Frames have been fractured and reassembled a ridiculous number of times since their
    original formation in 1990, and their latest release, <i>The Roads Outgrown</i>, features selected
    non-pieces and leftovers from their last three years as a performing unit: a Will Oldham cover (""Tomorrow's
    Too Long""), a Mic Christopher song (""Listen Girl""), an outtake from their 2000 Albini sessions (""Rise""), a
    handful of reworked tracks from their last full-length (2001's <i>For the Birds</i>) and a fiery, ten-minute
    live version of a cut from their second record (""Fitzcarraldo"").  It's classic outtakes-collage, cobbled
    together from disparate sessions/periods/albums, but, surprisingly, <i>The Roads Outgrown</i> plays more
    like a cohesive project, its seemingly unrelated cuts assembled with an artful sense of unity.</p><p>
<i>The Roads Outgrown</i> also functions as an oddly convincing introduction to the band, showing how their
    different methods/lineups always reach the same earthy conclusion: earnest, vaguely melancholic folk songs
    punctuated by quivering violins and frontman Glen Hansard's shaky country croon.  Excellent opener ""Lay
    Me Down"" (reworked and re-recorded at ""Joan's house"" before being selected for inclusion here) layers a
    light acoustic guitar melody over heavy bass-drum thumping, easing out in a haze of violin pulls, Hansard's
    voice flitting from whisper to coo. ""Headlong"" follows, sounding a bit like a Radiohead circa-<i>The Bends</i>
    B-side, as Hansard howls and strums with welcome intensity.  The Oldham cover, meanwhile, is plumped up
    with whining fiddles and half-whispered vocals, The Frames' delicate instrumentation breathing new warmth
    into Will's obtuse poetics.</p><p>
    
    The Frames' understanding of their own discography seems to have informed the fluidity of this collection,
    and its song-to-song coherence is both impressive and perplexing; while boldly varied in tempo, volume,
    and style, <i>The Roads Outgrown</i> is always concerned with its implicit mission-- namely, offering
    sincere, cerebral folk-pop crafted with the quiet confidence of a thirteen-year career.</p></div>"|3173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3173-the-roads-outgrown/|7.4|Amanda Petrusich

    start with a rock ballad, mix in lyrics about restless hearts and rolling
    meadows sung in a lilting falsetto by a northern golden boy, add layer upon
    layer of symphonic string arrangements, a sprinkle of piano here, a dash of
    plucked guitar there, and voila!  See you at the Reading Festival, mate!
    Starsailor (the name comes from the Tim Buckley LP) revels in all of these
    romantic pretensions on <i>Silence Is Easy</i>, their melodramatic, overproduced,
    but not altogether unpleasant sophomore release.</p><p>
    
    The new album covers a lot of the same territory as their platinum-selling 2001
    debut, <i>Love Is Here</i>: Like any self-respecting English bard, singer/guitarist
    James Walsh piles-on references to clear skies, sunshine, cafes, rising seas,
    and a-love-that-will-somehow-find-a-way, which compliment the maudlin orchestral
    overtones on much of the album.  Defiantly sappy, <i>Silence Is Easy</i> survives
    mostly on Walsh's oddly graceful singing.  Unfortunately, the music on the whole
    is prosaic, even boring at times.  It just sweeps right past you, like an
    unnoticed breeze.</p><p>
    
    The release of the un-Spectorized <i>Let It Be...Naked</i> on Tuesday made
    abundantly clear the sort of havoc that Phil Spector can wreak on an album.
    And while only two of the tracks on <i>Silence Is Easy</i> were produced by
    the gun-toting maniac, his presence is palpable on the entire record.  The
    song ""Telling Them"", for instance, starts out decently enough, with Walsh
    sounding like a young Robert Plant over Barry Westhead's piano playing and
    Ben Byrne's punctual drumming.  But, thanks no doubt to Spector's influence,
    the band is quickly overtaken by a cello and some accompanying strings that
    work themselves into a sentimental lather worthy of a Rob Reiner film.
    ""Fidelity"", too, has the makings of a nice rock song, with cutting, tumultuous
    guitars and a catchy chorus.  But it also feels too careful, too deliberate
    and fussed over to have a genuinely cathartic effect, and the overwrought
    harmonies bury the track before it's had a chance to live.</p><p>
    
    Walsh sounds alternately like Thom Yorke, Neil Young, Chris Martin and Jeff
    Buckley, though he isn't a smidgen of the songwriter that any of them are
    (or were).  His lyrics prove him incapable of understatement (a problem that
    apparently doesn't afflict him in conversation: ""I think some of the last
    record sounded overwrought in parts,"" he said recently about <i>Love Is
    Here</i>).  On <i>Silence Is Easy</i>, Walsh recycles truisms about love,
    sex, hate and co-dependance without any insights or significant lessons to
    add.  Of course, few songwriters have anything consistently new to say,
    but in the course of an album, a song or two should catch you in a way
    that makes you sit up and say, ""Yep.""  Walsh isn't quite there yet.</p><p>
    
    ""Four to the Floor"" opens with a hip-hop beat and a funk bassline, but is
    soon engulfed by more strings, which promptly crowd out the other instruments.
    What at first sounds like the soundtrack to a 70s film car chase is instead
    a pathetically crafted metaphor for, what else, but the thrill of new love.
    ""Four to the Floor, I was sure that you would be my girl,"" Walsh sings
    lamely.  This is the point in the album where you might start thinking,
    ""C'mon, man, fucking pull yourself together!  Enough with the chicks
    already!""</p><p>
    
    Despite these myriad complaints, <i>Silence Is Easy</i> actually has its
    share of tolerable moments.  Walsh is undoubtedly talented and his songs
    can be endearing even in their shameless mushiness.  Give him some time
    to shake off this Phil Spector phase (he'll ruin you like a diseased whore,
    Walsh!) and who knows how he'll develop musically.  For now, silence would
    be better.</p></div>"|7480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7480-silence-is-easy/|4.9|John O'Connor

    ...Or some such convoluted story.  All these years after the fact, what is clear is that The Beatles were
    special mainly because they were dedicated to producing things nobody else could.  These songs, the band's
    persona, the stances they took and lessons learned in front of the camera weren't just the exploits of a
    popular band, but live memoirs of the spiritual, artistic and disciplined Ideal.  For each word written
    and photo taken of all manner of celebrities, they are still arguably the only group of musicians worth
    talking about with the same significance as any world leader or religious icon you care to name-- at least
    in the West.  Bigger than Jesus?  All you need is love, and there is nothing I could write about them that
    isn't a cliché a hundred times over.</p><p>
    Because of this, most folks with a half a brain refuse to write about them in the same boundless way fans
    and journalists did in the 60s.  I suppose this is a wise choice; after all, I'm about as interested in
    sifting through their complete story right now as I am in reading the dictionary cover-to-cover.  Sure,
    it's ""important,"" if music and people and getting swept up in a minor revolution of love and change is
    important, but it's too fucking much.  Collectively, The Beatles had so many ideas, made so much music,
    affected so many people, inspired so much good (and bad) that they were necessarily bigger than life.
    Thus, we're necessarily stuck with tackling this stuff bit by bit.  It's a story of looking at things
    under a microscope, taking things slowly and trying to remember why we were so interested in the first
    place; it's a story of uncovering some small kernel of their legacy and watching it wind its way back
    to the center.  Everything worthwhile gets back eventually.</p><p>
    ""Phase one in which Doris gets her oats.""</p><p>
    Paul McCartney is a smug, charmless fuck.  Ahem: ""The great thing now about the remixed versions is that,
    with today's technology, they sound better than ever.""  If he had any humility, he'd insert a joke about
    receiving a bonus CD of outtakes when you ordered now; let's see some testimonials from satisfied customers
    as they pump their Beatles-themed parties, and claim, ""Listening to this stuff brings back so many memories!""
    If his reasons for bringing you the ""real"" <i>Let It Be</i> seem cribbed from an infomercial, one can hardly
    fault his timing.  George Harrison did, in fact, sign off on this release before his death, but given that
    he actually quit the band during the original sessions, one can only hope McCartney is reaping all his
    karmic just desserts for this ""naked"" edition.</p><p>
    In January 1969, about six weeks after <i>The White Album</i> was released, the band more-or-less agreed
    that their next project would involve being filmed as they performed their music.  Well, at least they
    agreed they should be filmed; or, they had certainly been open to the idea of all being in the same place
    at the same time, working on music, possibly making a movie (but ""no movies,"" as Harrison protested) and
    maybe eventually playing live somewhere in an Arabic desert.  Or France.  Or maybe on the rooftop of their
    studios.  Oh, and, ""Any of us can do separate things as well and that way it also preserves The Beatles bit.""
    Hmm, but, ""What we're doing is still rehearsing and we'll get it together."" ""We'll collect our thoughts and
    you collect yours.""</p><p>
    The sessions and rehearsals that eventually produced the original issue of <i>Let It Be</i> have been
    rightfully documented as disorganized and tension-filled.  After spending a month being filmed by Michael
    Lindsay-Hogg (who they'd already worked with on videos for ""Hey Jude"" and ""Revolution"", among others) as
    they rehearsed new material, and having put so much sound to tape that no one could be bothered to sift
    through it all when the time came to deliver an actual product, the band, realizing their defeat, handed
    it all off to engineer Glyn Johns and moved on to their next project.  One original idea for these sessions
    was merely to be filmed performing songs from <i>The White Album</i>; another was that they should get back
    to their roots of performing raving rock 'n' roll in front of an audience.  Typically, The Beatles' ideas
    and ambitions far outreached what they could possibly have achieved on their own-- and for the first time
    since they'd been together, most of them were too tired, distracted or otherwise uninspired to make sure
    all those ridiculous ideas actually materialized.</p><p>
    Johns compiled his version of what the record should be: studio chatter, adlibs, many rough takes of new
    songs and even off-the-cuff covers.  He was chosen because of his work with The Rolling Stones, but only
    too soon discovered that his new employers operated differently.  Even after several modifications and
    release dates, his compilation was rejected.  The tapes were shelved until the band agreed to let legendary
    producer Phil Spector have a go at squeezing a good record out of them.  It should be noted that while The
    Beatles were only too happy to rid themselves of the burden of <i>Let It Be</i>, they were working with
    George Martin on <i>Abbey Road</i> in exactly the same way they always had: If perfectionism and pride were
    forgotten in the winter of '69, apparently they could make amends on a ""proper"" LP.  Of course, when the
    band actually heard what Spector had produced, they balked (well, most of the time, depending on who was
    arguing with who).  Nevertheless, <i>Let It Be</i> was released in January 1970, after <i>Abbey Road</i>,
    and despite considerable differences of opinion on its ""greatness"" at the time, it has become yet another
    canonical set of Beatle music.</p><p>
    So what did Spector produce?  First, he added a couple of songs, including an old throwaway by Lennon
    called ""Across the Universe"", which was originally from 1968 and had recently been released on a charity
    compilation called <i>No One's Gonna Change Our World</i>.  Secondly, he beefed up some of the rather
    sparse arrangements with ersatz orchestral and choral parts-- much to the fury of McCartney after hearing
    his ""The Long and Winding Road"" turned into a Hallmark commercial.  Never mind that Spector had at least
    given the band a releasable record, including managing to turn a minute-and-a-half Harrison song fragment
    into ""I Me Mine"".  Given McCartney's famed disgust over the resulting LP, his enthusiasm to issue his idea
    of how this music should sound shouldn't surprise anyone.  <i>Let It Be... Naked</i> is a remixed,
    resequenced presentation of the most maligned Beatles album, and for better or for worse, will wrap no
    loose ends whatsoever.</p><p>
    ""Don't Let Me Down""</p><p>
    The best news about this record is that the songs themselves have not changed much in 33 years.  Those of
    you who love ""Across the Universe"" and ""Two of Us"" for their elegant simplicity and overwhelming beauty
    will be happy to know they haven't changed, even if these performances are not the ones to which we've
    become accustomed.  By the same token, I don't think I can ever love ""The Long and Winding Road""; sure,
    the choirs were a bit much, but then, McCartney didn't really need them to lay on some pretty thick drama.
    In any case, once over the initial shock of the new song order, <i>Naked</i> will seem very familiar to
    fans.</p><p>
    The sound is perfect, of course.  If anything, <i>Naked</i> serves as a great argument for a project to
    remaster all of the original Beatle albums.  Producers Paul Hicks, Guy Massey and Allan Rouse have done
    an excellent job cleaning up whatever warts were on the original tapes, and presenting these songs in a
    fresh way without resorting to making them sound overly ""modern.""  They've also somehow found a way to
    make McCartney play in tune, so I can only be grateful for that.</p><p>
    Now I must ask: Why?  In 2003, there are few people clamoring for an alternate version of <i>Let It Be</i>,
    and those that are have almost certainly discovered the myriad bootlegs offering every possible combination
    of halfway-finished covers and studio banter.  There is Beatle music yet to be released that should be: My
    pick would have been a legit issue of their sessions at George's house playing <i>The White Album</i> songs
    unplugged before recording them.  This is music that lends a considerably different light to their music
    than any remix ever could, and also has the advantage of not being horrifically over-analyzed for the past
    30 years.  Conversely, <i>Naked</i> is really only interesting as a mild curio, for fighting the boots and
    for the strangeness of reading a lecture on the wrongs of music-sharing placed within the cover of a Beatles
    record.</p><p>
    ""Riffs are the only thing that will help all of us.""</p><p>
    So then, the tunes.  To my ears, ""Get Back"" and ""For You Blue"" are unchanged.  The difference is that
    ""Get Back"" now leads off the record, and ""For You Blue"" is slotted third, suggesting McCartney thinks
    more of it than Spector did.  Likewise, ""I Me Mine"" features the same familiar Harrison vocals and guitar
    lines, but is completely stripped of the cinematic Spector backing arrangement.  ""The Long and Winding
    Road"" also seems mostly the same, minus the orchestra and choir.  However, listening more closely, I'm
    sure this is a different performance; McCartney's vocal wavers slightly and Billy Preston's organ solo
    gives it a subtle, soulful feel, reminiscent of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" (one of McCartney's favorite
    songs).  However, what's immediately noticeable is the marked clarity of all of these songs.  Ringo's
    hi-hat is crisp, Harrison's Leslie'd asides are in plain sight, rather than being buried by excitable
    sopranos.</p><p>
    Lennon's ""Don't Let Me Down"" wasn't on the original LP but was rehearsed at the same sessions.  The band
    performs it here more uptempo than on the released ""Get Back"" B-side, and generally more ragged-- as is
    to be expected, given that this was pulled from their famous rooftop performance.  Lennon lets loose with
    some wailing falsetto near the end, and even though they weren't the tightest outfit ever to play, few
    can deny the contagious enthusiasm they mustered onstage.  ""I've Got a Feeling"" and ""One After 909"" are
    also pulled from the roof concert, and are similarly raw.  Still, they're hardly bad recordings and I
    wonder why the band was so reluctant to release them at the time.</p><p>
    The tracks that struck me most on <i>Naked</i> were ""Let It Be"" and ""Across the Universe"".  The former
    because it seems very much improved with this remix; the Harrison guitar solo is new, so this is likely
    a different version than was released originally, and the hymnal-esque backing vocals are gorgeously
    placed across the aural plane in the mix.  These are the kinds of changes that make <i>Naked</i> an
    interesting listen for longtime fans, and raise the question of the powers that be possibly issuing a
    full-length project of Beatles remixes wherein drastic changes are made to songs without the obligation
    of placing the project alongside the rest of their proper LPs, as if this is the way they were ""meant""
    to be.  That said, ""Across the Universe"" is the same (slowed-down) vocal and guitar from <i>Let It Be</i>,
    but with more reverb and soft sitar-like sounds.  Though there's already a beautiful, lesser-known version
    of this track available (an elaborate George Martin-produced studio version with a background children's
    choir and bird chirps), this take eclipses the already beautiful original <i>Let It Be</i> version as the
    second-best performance of the song.</p><p>
<i>Let It Be... Naked</i> also comes with a second disc entitled <i>Fly on the Wall</i>, consisting of
    several short fragments of studio conversation and song rehearsals, amounting to approximately 21 minutes
    of bonus material.  This disc will doubtless be fascinating to fans, and in particular the snippets of
    John performing a very early version of ""Imagine"" (here referenced as ""John's Piano Piece""), and a short,
    striking version of Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass"", obviously influenced by his time spent with Bob
    Dylan and The Band in America the previous year.  However, given that the entire two-disc set runs less
    than an hour, I wonder why it wasn't condensed to a single disc.  Furthermore, if a 21-minute outtakes
    collection deserves its own bonus disc, why not expand this material to fill the rest of the CD?
    Apparently, releasing two versions of <i>Let It Be</i> make more sense to the remaining Beatles than
    giving fans something new.</p><p>
    ""Let It Be""</p><p>
    Ultimately, <i>Naked</i> is not essential.  Unlike scattered moments in the <i>Anthology</i> series, this
    music, though immaculately presented, doesn't really expand on either the music of <i>Let It Be</i>, or
    The Beatles' legacy.  At this point, I'm not sure many people are prepared to accept a new take on the
    band anyway, but I might at least be happy knowing they didn't take me for a raving completist.  And yet,
    I stood in line for this, just like millions of other like-minded fans will, merely for the chance to hear
    some small kernel leading me back to the reason I started listening in the first place.  The albums will
    always be there, and the legend will forever be imprinted on the hearts of anyone believing in the affirming
    power of their music.  In the end, regardless of what I write, this is The Beatles, and you already know
    what that means.</p></div>"|1093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1093-let-it-be-naked/|7.0|Dominique Leone

    numerous inglorious reasons that many a rock and roll band has decided to call it quits.  However, among
    this ignoble collection of excuses, not one reason has dispassionately slain as many of your favorite
    rockers, and been called out with more misguided sincerity than the proclamation of ""artistic differences;""
    otherwise known as the reason Rob Zombie has a solo career.  The most continuously baffling aspect of what
    I will dub, for the purposes of this review, ""Rob Zombie Syndrome"", is that nine times out of ten these
    ""differences"" only lead an artist to embark on a solo venture where they make music that sounds, for all
    intents and purposes, exactly the same as the music they had performed with their previous band.  Thing
    is, most of the time this material is bereft of all the frenetic energy and inspiration of their prior
    group.</p><p>
    
    In light of this gloomy context, Sun Kil Moon, the new solo project from Red House Painters virtuoso Mark
    Kozelek, can be understood as a miraculous unforeseen godsend for his listening audience. Instead of the
    album simply serving as a coda to all of Kozelek's previous incarnations, this new batch of material
    displays him putting to use a variety of wondrous subtle sonic touches that mark unbelievable artistic
    growth, unraveling unexplored harmonic territory while staying faithful to his trademark brand of languid
    folk-rock introspection.</p><p>
    
    With Sun Kil Moon, whose members include fellow Red House Painters cohort Anthony Koutsos on drums,
    American Music Club's Tim Mooney (also on drums), and ex-Black Lab bassist Geoff Stanfield, Kozelek
    has finally taken the time to fully indulge his own artistic vision.  For instance, all of the numbers
    on <i>Ghosts of the Great Highway</i> are Kozelek originals; in other words, no more AC/DC covers!
    Furthermore, it seems that, for the first time, Kozelek has put out an album whose meticulous sequencing
    yields more than just a random scattershot collection of great songs, but rather a complete cohesive
    musical statement.</p><p>
<i>Ghost of the Great Highway</i> is the sonic equivalent of a tightly woven patchwork quilt, a sprawling
    aesthetic manifesto overflowing with empathy, warmth, nostalgia, and an intensely resigned anger and
    yearning to reclaim those who time has taken.  The album's wistful opener, ""Glenn Tipton"", serves as a
    testament to this desire to recover the most modest of moments from one's past.  In the song, Kozelek
    reminisces about debating over boxing legends (""Cassius Clay was hit more than Sonny Liston"") and Judas
    Priest guitarists (""Some like K.K. Downing and some Glenn Tipton""), while mirroring these discussions to
    memories of his own dad watching Clark Gable movies on TV.</p><p>
    
    On the stately Neil Young-influenced rocker ""Salvador Sanchez"", Kozelek tells the story of Sanchez, a
    boxer who died in a fatal car accident at 23; whose story is told, yet again, on the acoustic string-laden
    stomp of the album's closure, ""Pancho Villa"".  The effect of this repeated conflation of iconic ghosts
    from the past with Kozelek's own personal narratives is remarkably moving.  All sense of time and
    stability are lost; <i>Ghost of the Great Highway</i> comes to symbolize the mechanics of actual memories,
    where people, places, discussions, events, and disarmingly ordinary and average moments are jumbled
    longingly together with little sense of any historic time-line outside of one's own experiences.</p><p>
    
    While Kozelek's albums with the Red House Painters never seemed quite colorful enough to sustain for their
    entire 70-odd-minute lengths, <i>Ghosts of the Great Highway</i> wholeheartedly avoids this same grim fate.
    The record achieves this vibrancy largely through balancing Kozelek's retrospective vocals, and penchant
    for acoustic and electric guitar noodling, with dazzlingly exotic arrangements, and inspirationally subtle
    instrumentation.   On the blissfully tender ""Gentle Moon"", the calming strum of acoustic guitars is
    blanketed within the shimmer of a brilliant electric guitar melody, all the while twinkling xylophone
    notes sparkle and luscious sweeping strings color Kozelek's frail tenor. While on the obligatory 14-minute
    psych-rock epic, ""Duk Koo Kim"", a fuzzy pensive electric guitar motif gives way to the valiant insistent
    strums of an army of mandolins, only to be draped by a rainstorm of solitary acoustic guitar notes.</p><p>
    
    Sun Kil Moon's <i>Ghost of the Great Highway</i> is a modest win for great music everywhere: it is the
    triumphant sound of an industry underdog finally making good on his past potential, and consequently
    demanding some long unappreciated due.  The fact that it wasn't with Red House Painters is an irony that
    only makes this victory of an album that much sweeter.</p></div>"|7722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7722-ghosts-of-the-great-highway/|8.3|Hartley Goldstein

    because space-time doesn't bend ""that way""; the speed of light, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the
    Event Horizon.  Don't cross the particle beams, but more importantly, as realized by noted physicist
    Robert Zemeckis, under no circumstances should you go back in time to make a sequel (or two).  That
    said, we stand at the threshold-- nay, the edge of a precipice-- looking out into the unknowable abyss,
    preparing to shatter one such limitation of the universe-at-large; this is the final frontier (but for
    real this time), and our guide is none other than Yo La Tengo.  Ladies and gentlemen, Yo La Tengo have
    covered themselves.</p><p>
    
    Years of pledge drives spent taking requests-- not of their own material, but of nearly any song that can
    be conceivably recreated with guitar, drum, and bass-- in benefit of their local radio station WFMU should
    leave Yo La Tengo's dominance of ""the cover"" incontestable.  With more than fifty years of rock and roll
    history as fair game, that YLT can even be so consistently competent is nothing short of remarkable, but
    the truth is, imperfect or not, they do a hell of a lot better than mere competence.  To reinterpret
    themselves is the last stone unturned; it was only a matter of time.  Today is the day, folks; here, they
    revisit the improbably homogenous <i>Summer Sun</i>'s most fully-realized track, and ""Cherry Chapstick"",
    a rare pop standout among the wintry 'scapes of <i>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</i>.  The
    concept alone is uniquely impressive in its sheer simplicity, but in execution, it's absolutely sublime; actually, YLT has reworked songs in the past (""Tom Courtenay"", among others), but never before have they seemed so not only fundamental, but immediately relevant as well.</p><p>
    
    It's unlikely that YLT set out with any intentions of silencing some of the critical dissent surrounding
    either of their last two albums, but it so happens that by turning these tunes inside-out, and exposing the
    vibrance beneath their docile veneer (and vice versa), the most pressing flaws disappear.  Whereas the
    warm breeze and sun-swept beaches of the original ""Today Is the Day"" concealed only the slightest hint of
    rain in a single, plaintive riff; the version contained here is a downpour of distorted guitar.  Hissing
    drones and cymbal crashes sweep away any memory of the former's dulcet overtones.  The only constant is
    Georgia Hubley's lovely vocal, which still carries the melancholy air of someone shut inside missing a
    sunny day; but where she once sounded disappointed in spite of her musical surroundings, she's re-cast here
    as the subtle, reserved heart amidst the thrashing guitar.</p><p>
    
    Reinterpreting another artist's material is a feat to do well, but still fairly common; to so effectively
    seek out another angle to a song Yo La Tengo know every facet of as their own, though, while technically
    no more difficult, is made more impressive given their presumed familiarity with the source material.
    Enjoying the result of such acute self-awareness is decidedly more uncommon.  ""Cherry Chapstick"" doesn't
    fare quite as well as ""Today Is the Day"" in its translation, but is equally revelatory, in its way, this
    time envisioned in step with the rest of <i>And Then Nothing</i> as a minimal acoustic number.  By reining
    the tune in considerably, it becomes an even more natural fit with its old host, albeit at the loss of
    some needed diversity.  In and of itself, it drags in its sparseness, but still bookends this EP near-perfectly.</p><p>
    
    It should also be noted that there are also vital signs in Yo La Tengo's new material following <i>Summer
    Sun</i>.  If the long-absent hum of ""Today Is the Day"" stirs recollection of an earlier YLT, back to <i>I
    Can Hear the Heart Beating as One</i>, or even <i>Painful</i>, then ""Styles of the Times"" and ""Outsmartener""
    see those thoughts to their logical conclusion, bringing back the pop guitar dynamics of old without seeming
    complete throwbacks.  ""Styles of the Times"" is particularly infectious, sounding as bouncy and aggressive
    as one of Wire's sawing <i>Pink Flag</i> assaults, with an equal measure of anthemic melody.  This sort of
    passion has been sorely missed in some quarters, and shows that the band can still, despite worry to the
    contrary, tap into their old-fashioned ampbuzz seemingly at will, and without even looking over their shoulder.
    The ""covers"" (not to confuse them with the actual cover of folk singer Bert Jansch's ""Needle of Death"")
    on the <i>Today Is the Day</i> EP make explicit what should have been obvious: Yo La Tengo are still one
    of the most talented acts going, and whether they're maturing or simply cooling off these days, they're
    still evolving.</p></div>"|8871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8871-today-is-the-day-ep/|7.6|Eric Carr

    producer/multi-instrumentalists, folksy female singer/songwriters, reclusive genius frontmen, and the dude
    who's always selling the merch, lurks another none-too-rare breed of indie rock royalty: the earnest male
    singer/songwriter.  Yes, we've all seen them, usually pathologically clutching their browbeaten acoustic
    guitars while gently emoting nostalgic notes of heartbreak.  In fact, they're most likely spotted conveniently
    serving as a handy opening act for your favorite label's marquee band; which, if you're really lucky, this
    broken-hearted rebel may also serve as a member of.  Such is the case with Broken Social Scene guitarist/songwriter
    Jason Collett.  His debut solo album for the ever-expanding Canadian all-star label, Arts &amp; Crafts, is
    titled <i>Motor Motel Love Songs</i>, and predictably features a selection of his finest moments from off
    of his earlier self-released discs.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, this record bears three strikes against it even before we're able to get the album out of
    its shrinkwrap.  With a title as yearningly cliched as <i>Motor Motel Love Songs</i>, and a tracklist that
    reads sappier than Hugh Grant's film canon (sample track titles: ""Bitter Beauty"", ""Tiny Ocean of Tears""
    and ""All I've Ever Known""), it looks bleak for the originality of the music within; and, for the record,
    I'll just let the numbingly pastoral cover art speak for itself.  However, the real obstacle this record
    faces is the dazzling modest beauty of one of this year's most outstanding releases, Broken Social Scene's
    <i>You Forgot It in People</i>.  It is a resounding disappointment that Collett's run-of-the-mill solo work
    bears little in common with the epic fractured subtleties of his focal band's sound, and anyone left searching
    for lingering elements of Broken Social Scene's music will undoubtedly be left disappointed.</p><p>
    In spite of all of this, one of the most surprising elements of <i>Motor Motel Love Songs</i> is that, while
    the album fails to break any new musical territory, Collett is incredibly adept at recreating the melodic
    sunny ambience, and California strum of 70s-era AM pop.  Despite featuring a lyric as banal as ""I know it's
    complicated, but don't you think giving up is so overrated,"" the sparkly telecaster rock of ""Tiny Ocean of
    Tears"" is melodically charming.  The mid-tempo muted hum of ""Choke Cherry"" and the Woody Guthrie-inspired
    litany of ""Honey I Don't Know"", both seem to serve as perfect musical canvases for the self-introspection
    of the protagonists in each of the numbers.  Furthermore, a disarmingly offhand song like ""Gabe"", which
    drives along on an empathetically understated melodic line three times removed from Pete Yorn, Eddie Vedder,
    and The Eagles, seems to become more insistently catchy with each listen.</p><p>
    The real saving grace of <i>Motor Motel Love Songs</i>, though, is Andrew Cash's flawlessly restrained
    production.  Despite reaching success on his own with the obscure 80s alternative group, L'etranger,
    fellow Toronto stalwarts Cash and Collett have had a long history of collaboration together including
    serving as fellow band members in The Andrew Cash Band, Ursula, and Bird.  On a number like the memorably
    idyllic ""Blue Sky"", Cash supplies Collett's rambling bucolic melody with a gleaming, stripped-down
    accompaniment, made up of a snaky bassline, choppy reverb-drenched guitars, and a mellow organ refrain
    played by fellow Broken Social Scene cohort Brendan Canning.  And on the countrified midtempo rocker
    that serves as the album's opener, ""Bitter Beauty"", Cash uses all these same elements and adds a
    brilliant layer of sun-drenched vocal harmonies as a perfect accent to the already rootsy mix.</p><p>
<i>Motor Motel Love Songs</i> will likely have Collett's listening audience despondently frustrated with
    his trite cliché hopping and swooning after his timeless rustic melodies all at the same time. While he
    may not appear much different from the legions of other singer/songwriter hopefuls, resigning to sing
    their proverbial musical diaries to indifferent chatty audiences at dive bar venues across the globe,
    he adequately gets by with a little help from his friends.</p></div>"|1736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1736-motor-motel-love-songs/|6.9|Hartley Goldstein

Some
    appreciate pure, raw sample building, some praise sharp, calculated synthetic melodies and others simply
    opt for a position that can create tension or atmosphere. In the case of Mush Records' latest upstart,
    Omid tries everything on his debut LP, <i>Monolith</i>, but never quite creates an identity.</p><p>
    
    The first comparison to be made is that his style of production stands as an admittedly intriguing amalgam
    of Anticon lo-fi and West Coast underground bombast. His focus is utterly scattered, making it difficult to
    define his approach: ""Live from Tokyo"" is Rick Rubin minimalism, a display of stutter crunk with horns and
    boardwalk bass thump, ""Double Header"" is an idiosyncratic, heavy-drummed carnival whistle bounce, while
    ""Ripple Study"" is fuzz-synth shimmer with popping, clicking drums and analog noises. Unfortunately, it's
    never as interesting as it sounds-- the concepts sound ethereal, but the actual composition leaves much to
    be desired. Instead of being concise like Prefuse 73 or adding various phaseshifts like Rjd2, Omid is
    content to let his compositions drift stationary or shift to less than interesting directions. In the most
    basic terms, Omid's a decent producer with no idea how to pace an instrumental.</p><p>
    
    As with many modern instrumentalist showcases, Omid has called in a few of his subterranean friends to
    bless his soundscapes, with varying degrees of success. While Hyminal comes off like a fake Saul Williams
    (that is to say, faker), Busdriver never utilizes his mastery of speed rap or melody, instead opting to
    cover his voice in radio feedback while screaming anti-Bush rhetoric over jagged Alec Empire-styled noise
    synth, and even Buck 65 sounds uninspired, retreading tired baseball metaphors and sleepwalking through
    what sounds like a series of unrelated outtakes.</p><p>
    
    ""Live from Tokyo"", though, is the biggest disappointment by some distance.  Featuring Slug, Aceyalone,
    MURS, and Luckyiam.PSC, the track seemed to bear incredible promise.  The retro pause-funk of the beat
    could've easily inspired better performances from each artist, but it seems as if Omid's production purely
    draws mediocrity from rappers, regardless of his obvious talent.  Aceyalone lets us (and the friends he's
    obviously now writing verses to) know that he's ""not Japanese,"" but rather ""Nigganese,"" while Slug manages
    once again to provide a verse with stunningly elaborate depth that means absolutely nothing: he esoterically
    insults MC No One and focuses on a woman's facial features in a single verse.</p><p>
    
    Less sprawling than the Anticon production team, yet too unpolished to hope for commercial viability, Omid
    is caught in a production paradox. His work is never <i>bad</i>, but he rarely takes his beats far enough
    to carry an album based solely around an artist's background musical talent. If Omid can manage to master
    a single style, instead of haphazardly attempting several approaches, he might yet carve his niche in the
    turbulent underground.</p></div>"|6091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6091-monolith/|6.2|Rollie Pemberton

Last year,     Montreal's Scott Monteith, who records as Deadbeat, released <em>Wildlife Documentaries</em>. Solid record,     but the extreme influence of Stefan Betke (aka Pole) was what stood out most. Deadbeat adopted the     glitched-out dub and ghosted synths wholesale, without adding much of his own personality to the mix--     and the fact that <em>Wildlife Documentaries</em> was released on Betke's ~scape made the similarities that     much more glaring.</p><p>Now Deadbeat returns in collaboration with fellow Montreal resident Stephen Beaupré to make ""crackhaus""     for Stuttgart's Onitor label.  Catchy new genre name, to be sure, but it wasn't necessary: The two claim     to have been ""inspired"" by Akufen (Marc Leclair from, yes, Montreal), and in fact, they're working     completely in the realm of what Leclair called ""microsampling."" The Montreal crew share a technique,     processing tiny fragments of sound into bubbling, funky, minimal house music. Akufen pulled his material     from the radio exclusively on <em>My Way</em>, where the Crackheadz use additional sound sources a la     Matthew Herbert, another acknowledged inspiration. House producer Todd Edwards predated all these guys     with this business, for those keeping score at home.</p><p>So originality is out, but that's all right. Monteith and Beaupré are completely open about where their     ideas come from, and most important, they do great things with them. To my ears, <em>It's a Crackhaus Thing</em> beats the pants off the enjoyable but overrated <em>My Way</em> and dances happily away with Leclair's     trousers on its head. The key for Monteith and Beaupré is their restraint with their samples. They keep     their sequences short and simple, playing up the hook when it's there and letting it slink to the background     when it's not. And then throughout, their massively satisfying basslines pick up the slack. Their approach     to sound, despite the glitches, is clean and welcoming. All the sharp digital edges have been sanded out     to allow more room for movement. And there should be movement.</p>
<p>Though house is the centerpoint, there are twists to the beats.  ""Shine Your Light"", which builds a riff     from a sampled gospel moan and a harmonica blast, has a pogo effect on the upbeat that gives the 4/4 beat     a bit more bounce. ""Little Cosmonaut"" and ""Single.mtl"" organize the tiny sound hacks (percussive taps,     half-syllables, a doorslam) into a loping gait, a sort of rounded shuffle under and around the bass drum,     all bolstered by the snaking bass. Like Herbert, Monteith and Beaupré have a skill for turning the everyday     noise into funky percussion that blends with the soundfield of the individual track. So when a squeaky motor     is sampled and looped to form the beat for ""Who Says"", it doesn't draw attention to itself.  It sounds like     the right instrument for the rhythm, not some shoehorned fragment that sounded too cool not to be used     somewhere.</p>
<p>Monteith and Beaupré know their strengths with <em>Crackhaus</em> and play to them.  There are no extended     builds here, no allusions to a peak they cannot reach; rather, the nine tracks range from 5\xBD to 7\xBD minutes,     just long enough to let the groove build but never outstaying their welcome. If the dynamic range is a bit     flat, this accentuates the functional nature of this physical music, where emotion is muted in favor of     more reptilian pleasures.

Jay Dee asks on the ""The Mission"", a standout track on his
    new collaboration with ultra-prolific producer Otis Jackson, Jr. (aka Madlib).  It's not so much a hard-fast
    rule as it is an unfortunate trend that producers rarely get in front of a mic-- producers like Kanye West
    and El-P have frequently proven themselves capable of holding their own with heavyweight emcee.  Fortunately,
    these two haven't had much trouble making time for rhymes: Jay Dee's appeared prominently with Slum Village
    on 2000's <i>Fantastic Vol. II</i> and solo on the 2001 BBE release of <i>Welcome 2 Detroit</i>, while
    Madlib has put down lyrics with the legendary Oxnard, California-based underground collective Lootpack
    and on his own solo records as himself (this year's Blue Note-sampling <i>Shades of Blue</i>) and Quasimoto
    (2001's <i>The Unseen</i>).  The concept behind the Jaylib project, then, seems a logical conclusion: each
    provide beats for the other's rhymes.</p><p>
    
    As expected, <i>Champion Sound</i> is unquestionably one of the most exciting and inventive hip-hop
    productions this year: Jay Dee's characteristically bass-heavy breaks and Madlib's wonderfully off-kilter
    quasi-organic dutchery compliment each other perfectly, and their best moments here easily rank among their
    personal highs.  But call it a self-fulfilling prophecy: the lyrics are its Achilles' heel.  Jay Dee and
    Madlib change places with each successive track, but their message-- mostly that ""Jay Dee and Madlib are
    collabin',"" that they ""are in this mothafucka,"" and ""live bitches is what [we] need""-- rarely butterflies
    into much else.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the record's focus doesn't rest on its lyrics: Madlib-produced ""McNasty Filth"" assume's the
    role of party track and just kills, alternately flaunting organ and baritone sax drones before upshifting
    into some vaguely Prefusian cut-ups and a hi-hat's violent treble attacks. Title-track ""Champion Sound"",
    also produced by Madlib, comes peppered with ample fuzz and an offbeat chorus of ""Wah!"" while orbiting a
    sultry female vocal sample. ""Strip Club"" is the album's most amusing track, a quirky steel drum sample
    reminiscent of <i>Super Mario 2</i> backing a brilliant dialogue between the duo in which Quasimoto plays
    a stripper offering deeper intimacy: ""I can touch you and you can touch me.""</p><p>
    
    Three ""The"" tracks-- single ""The Red"", B-side ""The Official"", and above-mentioned ""The Mission""-- make for
    <i>Champion Sound</i>'s best moments. Pulling no punches, ""The Red"" packs a spooky piano vamp and female
    chorus sample into a characteristically minimal Jay Dee backbeat, over which Madlib throws out a host of
    shoutouts and the occasional Quasimoto-ism. Madlib's muted trumpets on ""The Official"" recall Miles Davis'
    late 50s work with Gil Evans (particularly <i>Miles Ahead</i> or 1960's <i>Sketches of Spain</i>), and its
    understatement is answered in opposite by the fast-paced sampling, boastful string vamp and Philly soul-style
    horns of ""The Mission"".</p><p>
    
    If there were a scorecard for <i>Champion Sound</i>, Madlib would undoubtedly receive higher marks than J
    Dilla on both sides of the beat, but both far exceed the buffoonery of guest rapper Talib Kweli on ""Raw
    Shit"", the album's abysmal low-point. Lazy production, lame tropes like, ""Everybody say I love/ That
    bullshit/ I like it/ I love it,"" and, ""Everybody just gather 'round / 'Cause all we want to do/ Is get
    on down,"" and Kweli's incongruously deadpan delivery make this track pretty much unlistenable.  The
    disjointed ""React"", while interesting, becomes grating before it finally closes out, and Madlib's initially
    promising revolver-like beat on ""Strapped"" is a similar headache.  Fortunately, slip-ups like these are
    few and far between.</p><p>
<i>Champion Sound</i> in theory is a remarkable proposition, and for the most part the Jaylib team deliver
    the ridiculous beats expected of them while, perhaps ironically, acknowledging in verse the album's lyrical
    shortcomings.  The tracks floating around from the Madvillain sessions, a similar Stones Throw collaboration
    between MF Doom and Madlib, seem more promising both lyrically and musically, but in the end, <i>Champion
    Sound</i> is itself certainly no lightweight.</p></div>"|4341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4341-champion-sound/|7.4|Nick Sylvester

    me like a giant pair of shit-stained undies, they made me feel a little better about life.  Later that day
    I told a female acquaintance (someone who'd had the misfortune of being educated in Northeastern private
    schools and naturally had no idea of who Waylon Jennings was) about Waylon and she thought I meant Peter
    Jennings, the newscaster.  ""Oh noooo,"" she said slowly, cupping her hand to her mouth, ""Not Peee-ter.  He
    was soooo great.""  We were at a barbecue eating shish kabobs, and I credit The Kills with preventing me
    from plunging my metal poker straight through that girl's black heart.</p><p>
    
    One-half of The Kills is Alison ""VV"" Mosshart, a Floridian who, along with Sam Beam of Iron &amp; Wine, may
    eventually rehabilitate the sullied name of that near-forgotten state.  She sings like Joan Jett, though
    initially, you might recall <i>Happy Days</i>' Pinky Tuscadero, whose coquettish growl stood in poetic
    juxtaposition to the leather body suit, kerchief and biker gloves that she sashayed in onstage.  Remember
    the episode where Pinky battles the Malachi brothers in a demolition derby and gets righteously mangled?
    When the Fonz lifts her limp body from the wreckage he has this implacable look in his eyes-- a look he
    wore only once before, if memory serves me correctly, when Al's restaurant burned down-- and you just
    <i>know</i> some beatdowns are imminent.  Man!  That still gives me goose bumps.  The point being, VV
    puts the melodrama to good use.  Her voice has a frenetic, indignant quality much like Karen O's, and
    it's the foundation of four out of the five songs on their freshly reissued <i>Black Rooster</i> EP.</p><p>
    
    The other half of The Kills is Londoner Jamie ""Hotel"" Hince.  Aside from having the coolest nickname on
    the other side of the Big Drink, Hotel plays a furious, unwieldy guitar that provides the perfect
    accompaniment to VV's vengeance-minded crooning. Their transatlantic collaboration has a peculiar
    resonance on the song ""Cat Claw"", which sounds something like if The Stooges cut a single with Boss Hog.
    The drumming is relentless but understated, and the lyrics (some of which are inscrutable) are violently
    lustful: ""Never know who comes it might easily be me/ You don't give a fuck for my love 'cause that's too
    much.""  On the title track, Hotel and VV trade come-ons in a call-and-response chorus: ""You wanna fuck and
    fight?/ In the basement/ The kid gotta rattlesnake gun/ In the basement.""  Both songs bring to mind a
    softcore version of <i>Backyard Wrestling</i> with Sean Connery versus he-woman Jennifer Capriati.</p><p>
    
    The Kills have earned comparisons to Captain Beefheart (which is sorta fucked), but they owe more of a
    debt to Sonic Youth and Royal Trux-- though <i>Black Rooster</i> is neither as self-indulgent or
    drug-obsessed as Herrema and Hagerty in their prime. Aside from the last track, an experimental throwaway
    titled ""Gum"", the songs on this EP make for an extraordinary debut.</p></div>"|4426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4426-black-rooster-ep/|7.4|John O'Connor

I
    thought the book was mostly a manual for baby-boomer self-importance, but one passage about how the author
    thought his friend was refusing to accept technology because it wasn't cool stuck with me.  There is a
    whole culture of people out there who don't seem to exist on the same plane as the rest of us.  I don't
    really believe these people are getting into holistic medicine and going back to the country because they
    think it's ""cool,"" but there is certainly something they're tapping into (consciously or not), in direct
    opposition to the information overloaded M.O. we're supposed to be all about.</p><p>
    
    There are artists in music, like Six Organs of Admittance, Charalambides, and Richard Youngs, who reflect
    this mindstate.  While they've hardly cracked the mainstream, they have all participated in some strange
    continuum of space-folk that goes back some 40 years-- probably not coincidentally when the 60s counterculture
    really got going.  In particular, Ben Chasny's Six Organs project is the statement of someone in tune with
    the history of underground folk and psychedelic music, and only too willing to ignore the conventions of
    his own time to bring them further back into the collective experience, as he did so well on last year's
    <i>Dark Noontide</i>.</p><p>
    
    And I guess that's my complaint with Six Organs' latest, <i>Compathia</i>: rather than expand on the strange,
    rustic eccentricity of <i>Dark Noontide</i>, Chasny has opted to emphasize his singer/songwriter tendencies.
    Not that <i>Compathia</i> is a pop record, but its roots are much nearer here to early Marc Bolan or even
    Donovan.  The melodies don't necessarily guide a narrative as drift through loose arrangements (which usually
    consist only of multiple acoustic guitars), but there is significance in the notion that those melodies are
    the heart of this music.  In many ways, Chasny is traveling down a similar path to Devendra Banhart, except
    that Banhart is able to make his songs sound as bizarre and unique as most other peoples' freakouts.  The
    music of this record is hardly so out there, and that wouldn't be so much a criticism if Chasny's songs had
    a bit more meat to them.</p><p>
    
    ""Only the Sun Knows"" encapsulates the sound of <i>Compathia</i>, illuminating the simplistic, elongated
    melodic phrasing Chasny prefers, as well as revealing the nearly omnipresent drone still very close to his
    music.  It isn't likely his modest tune you'll remember, though-- it's Comets on Fire multi-instrumentalist
    Ethan Miller's searing, completely on-the-mark guitar solo.  What I'd always hoped Six Organs would deliver
    was a kind of apocalyptic, epic-strength acid-folk, and when Miller blasts off and Chasny injects the
    odd layer of wheezing electronic mush, my hope is realized.  Of course, it's a far cry from most of the
    low-key balladry of the rest of the album, and when the final verse appears, this fiery, chaotic vision
    suddenly seems distant.</p><p>
    
    More typical for the album are songs like ""Close to the Sky"", ""Run!"" and the instrumental title track.
    These are short, sweet examples of folk informed by psychedelic music (and lifestyle), but still grounded
    enough to work in non-chemically enhanced states.  The first tune in particular even approaches the
    almost-catchy acoustic pop of the Elephant 6 bands, if they'd been more in love with Donovan than The
    Beatles.  The tambourine and handclaps (?!!) tighten up his arrangement, but for some reason, it seems
    strange to hear a Six Organs' song with something like a chorus.  Chasny's vocals are much more out in
    front on <i>Compathia</i>, and but for a slight warble-- and a slighter detour into space-guitar at the
    end-- ""Close to the Sky"" could very much pass for straightforward folk-pop.</p><p>
    
    Not everything is so cut and dry: ""Somewhere Between"" (perfect title) begins as a dark, calm-before-the-storm
    lament but gradually transforms into Eastern-tinged repeated mantra, featuring droned guitars and all manner
    of jingling percussion.  It's a very cool sound, and one that I wish Six Organs would explore more in the
    future.  Ultimately, <i>Compathia</i> is an accomplished, heartfelt record, if not necessarily the one to
    define Chasny's artistic voice.  I get the feeling he's either taking it easy or making a transition to an
    altogether smoother plane; in either case, an appreciation for pastoral, lightly burnt acoustic pop is what
    you really need to enjoy his stuff.</p></div>"|7200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7200-compathia/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    his mythically bootlegged, classic debut, <i>The Best Part</i>, from hitting record store shelves years
    after its inception.  Thankfully, the fiasco of music business politics didn't put J-Live off from recording,
    and subsequently, he came back fresher than ever with 2002's matured sophomore triumph, <i>All of the Above</i>.
    The album, which was largely an effective mix of J-Live's own cerebral word games, inspired flow, and candid
    introspection, not only served as a well-earned sign of endurance in the face of the hip-hop community and
    music industry at large, but also marked a colossal evolution in J-Live's own sound.  In this light, J-Live's
    new EP, <i>Always Will Be</i> (a companion piece to his <i>Always Has Been</i> EP, featuring fresh material)
    comes as something of a disappointment.  The album has a surprisingly lighthearted and indifferent quality
    to it; it serves as neither a substantial aesthetic devolution nor a marked progression either.</p><p>
    
    While J-Live has always worn his old-school influences on his sleeve, never before have they eclipsed his
    artistic growth as much as they do here.  Part of the reason for this is the fact that J-Live chose to
    self-produce all of the EP's eight tracks; and while J-Live makes for a wondrously impassioned and
    well-spoken emcee, his production skills rarely match his verbal cunning.  DJ Spinna and Usef Dinero's
    esoteric, soulful instrumentals are resoundingly missing. Tracks like the Sugar-Hill Gang homage ""Add-a-Cipher""
    and the tediously ironic ""Get Live"" bounce by on monotonously minimal drum programming, bland keyboard
    sounds, and lackluster horn samples.  While this kind of stripped production does leave more room for
    J-Live's intricate wordplay and rousing delivery to reap the spotlight, it also unfortunately makes him
    sound inexpressively derivative; instead of innovating the past, J-Live now sounds trapped in it.</p><p>
    
    This realization is particularly frustrating since many of the tracks off <i>Always Will Be</i> are
    conceptually inspired, and feature remarkable performances from J-Live on the mic.  J-Live, who himself
    is an ex-schoolteacher, has always demonstrated an overt passion for language; his unrelenting flow weaves
    an intricate web of verbiage, spinning words into every possible rhythmic and thematic context before
    moving on to the next line.  On the older-school ""Add-a-Cipher"", J-Live boasts, ""There is no simile that's
    similar enough to capture the imagery of my syllabic symmetry."" It's a mouthful, but one would never know
    it hearing J-Live deliver the line in such an unfussy manner.  On the closing track ""Skip Proof"", which
    addresses that while he's a fixture in ""underground"" hip-hop he has yet to go gold, he muses, ""the only
    plaques I got is on top my bathroom sink in a bottle I use to fight plaque.""  While on the concept-driven
    track, ""Car Trouble"", J-Live schools Wordsworth (of Lyricist Lounge infamy) on the pitfalls and perils of
    getting a record contract, using shopping for a new automobile as an extended metaphor for the whole ordeal;
    J-Live wittily queries, ""Are you a soloist or down with a band, 'cause six in a two-seater's not a good
    plan.""</p><p>
    
    Still, despite showcasing J-Live's abundant talent, <i>Always Will Be</i> will likely just leave most fans
    hoping he'll turn back to outside producers.  Towards the record's end, on the undulating track ""9000 Miles"",
    J-Live asserts his aesthetic manifesto: ""I can't spit that old rhetoric, I gotta spit ten steps ahead of
    it.""  And he's right: his wordplay's hovering off into the future; but next time his instrumentals will
    need to catch up with him.</p></div>"|4180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4180-always-will-be-ep/|6.4|Hartley Goldstein

    often just plain overpowering: suddenly, all the latent indie elitism buried deep inside their collective
    bones bubbles up, springing each member directly into the throes of a hearty group snicker.  Some bands
    manage to eschew the temptation-- The Flaming Lips' cover of Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head""
    was wound down and slathered generously with organ, a re-arrangement that only emphasized the track's
    freaked-out, sighing hopelessness (and Wayne Coyne's willingness to acknowledge its dynamic). But while
    the Lips nobly avoided condescension in favor of ingenuity, their approach is far from standardized: the
    bit-lip, determinably ironic cover remains an alarmingly popular vehicle for loads of artless wanking.</p><p>
    
    On the five-track <i>A Beautiful EP</i>, Brooklyn country-folkers Clem Snide dig their bloody claws into
    Christina Aguilera's empowerment-pushing ""Beautiful"", stripping down the original's histrionic instrumentation
    and replacing it with spare electric guitar riffing and a sped-up backbeat.  But while their intentions may
    have been glowing, the results are still stupidly underwhelming.  For Aguilera, ""Beautiful"" was primarily
    a platform for strutting her pipes, with a peripheral, stop-making-fun-of-my-outfits plea for magnanimous
    self-acceptance.  Snide vocalist Eef Barzelay, who boasts, thankfully, neither Aguilera's sprawling vocal
    range nor her familiarity with the burn of the public's knife, spends the entire three minutes sounding
    like he's stifling a big, raucous giggle-- which might be okay if the song didn't continually reveal itself
    as awkwardly one-dimensional and (still!) unbearably maudlin.</p><p>
    
    The album version of <i>Soft Spot</i>'s lead single, the gushy ""Al Green"", hits next, and the difference
    in tone is palpable from the start.  Barzelay proudly owns his grinning prose, and each lyric drips
    peaceably into place, as soft and lush as the story itself (""Summer will come/ With Al Green and sweetened
    iced tea/ Summer will come/ And be all green with the sweetness of thee""), languid guitar and chiming keys
    rolling into one lazy, languorous flow.</p><p>
    
    ""Mike Kalinsky"", the only previously unreleased original included here, is more prototypically Snide,
    flaunting their now-patented blend of purposefully clever vocal-folk (see Mountain Goats) and careful
    alt-country strumming. The studio difference is noticeable (gone is the golden gloss of the Soft Spot
    sessions), and ""Mike Kalinsky"" sees Barzelay returning to his snarkier roots, sidestepping the super-sweet
    lamentations of Soft Spot in favor of rambling barbs (""He had difficulty breathing so he couldn't participate
    in sports/ And all the jocks said he was gay.../ Mike Kalinsky spent high school alone in his bedroom
    listening to Joy Division and The Misfits/ And going nowhere"").  When it comes time for Mike Kalinsky
    himself to seize control of the story, the song tumbles from placid acoustic strums into 30 seconds of
    storming garage bangs, a funny-the-first-time explosion of noise designed to stubbornly define the
    narrative shift.</p><p>
    
    The final two tracks on <i>A Beautiful EP</i> were recorded live on WFUV; the first, a striking cover of
    The Velvet Underground's ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", sits in wild contrast to the band's take on Aguilera--
    the crinkled-nose sneer is gone, replaced by loads of sincere, held-breath reverence and persuasive
    conviction.  Unlike ""Beautiful"", ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" earns aping: Clem Snide expertly stretch the song
    out to a bit over three minutes (skillfully harmonizing where Nico and Reed just doubled-up), threading in
    some melancholic cello lines and acoustic finger-flourishes, Barzelay's wobbly croak providing a warm
    alternative to Nico's brisk, disembodied warble.  The disc closes out with ""Nick Drake Tape"", plucked
    from their sparse 1998 debut <i>You Were a Diamond</i>, and rendered faithfully on-air; the song is a
    perfectly breathy finish to an EP that's, ultimately, just as light.</p></div>"|1502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1502-a-beautiful-ep/|6.7|Amanda Petrusich

    rankings, Soul-Junk would be perched in the upper echelon, if not at the very top. That means they'd be
    ahead of the Bush Administration (with its oil-anointed, hymn-composing, boob-fearing Attorney General,
    its Security Adviser seeking counsel from a pompadour'd televangelist, and its Deputy Undersecretary of
    Defense for Intelligence seeing Satan over Mogadishu), ahead of great management books such as Laurie
    Beth Jones' <i>Jesus CEO</i> (with chapters titled ""He Kept in Constant Contact with His Boss"", ""He Owned
    It"", and ""He Did Not Kick the Donkey""), and ahead of the film adaptations of the <i>Left Behind</i> books
    (still waiting for a porn studio to unveil <i>From Behind</i>, starring Kirk Rameron).</p><p>
    
    Seriously, folks: American Christianity has lead to a lot of fascinating art. Consider the untrained
    scribble-painting of Howard Finster, James Hampton's garbage sculpture, or the judgmental fiction of
    Flannery O'Connor. Raving campus preachers always seemed more anthropologically interesting than the
    nervous Asians cycling past them or the stoned malingerers flicking bird-poop at them. Check out the
    documentary <i>Chase the Devil: Religious Music of the Appalachians</i> to be floored by wild, sincere
    Christian music and its accompanying spectacle (get ready for ""No Blacklung in Heaven"", for Vernon Oxford's
    heartbreaking ""Lord, I've Tried Everything But You"", for gospel that sounds like punk colliding with John
    Lee Hooker's <i>Endless Boogie</i>, and for the ""leper"" who talks to Jesus through a wobbling car antenna).</p><p>
    
    This creative tradition could never have seen Soul-Junk coming.  With some engineering help from friend
    Sufjan Stevens, and some sounds lent by a seven-guest roster that includes free-jazzers and vinyl-""users"",
    Galaxalag and Sloro have made an at-times unlistenable masterpiece.  I crap you negative: <i>1958</i>
    contains hip-hop so out-there, so deconstructed, so avant-garde, so every-other-term-for-radically-pioneering
    that all geeks seeking that sacred ""next level"" will consider it a harbinger of rapture deserving Pitchfork's
    sacred 10.0.</p><p>
    
    And yet, and yet: The huge step forward in experimentation results in too big a step back in grooves. The
    micromanaged haphazardness is impressive, even overwhelmingly so, but must every track pause, capsize,
    collapse, get pregnant, get spliced, and undergo sundry transubstantiations?  I certainly wouldn't want
    this band to compromise their Ziplocalypse vibe by ""going club,"" but the few accessibly bumping tracks
    end up feeling like teasers of how Soul-Junk possesses the production chops to sway the multitudes. I
    mean, the awesome ""World's Loudest Ventriloquist"" samples ducks and elephants to go with its synthesizer
    squeals!</p><p>
    
    Free-formity is their ethos: Like many of its neighbors, ""Nerve and Gall"" sees no need to make up its mind
    about how much to echo, or multi-track, or pitch-shift, or overlap, its vox. Like several of its brethren,
    ""Sabor"" suggests a digital Beefheart leading a Bible-camp Boredoms. ""Hogging All the Islands"" ends with a
    panic-attack simulation of manipulated gasps (no faxlung in heaven?).  Your CD rack will wonder aloud if
    you are listening to Raymond Scott's audition to join the Bomb Squad.</p><p>
    
    When I reviewed <i>1957</i>, Junkheads came out of yon woods to tell me I got their discography scheme
    wrong (the albums start at 1950 and go forward while EPs and singles go backward to 1938-- how you like
    me now?) and to warn me that their concerts were preachier than their platters (ah, but the duo is known
    to wear cardboard costumes like an orphanage Halloween party). The sermonizing on <i>1958</i> shouldn't
    ruffle anybody's tolerance or leave any Puritan blisters, as it is subtle, interspersed with anarchic
    wordplay, or just ill (""let the son of God give the spit-blood-dirt Visine between cracked lids""). On
    the flowchart, Galaxalag remains the king of the funky stutter and the baked slur, while Sloro is hilarious
    and charming as a kind of confidently awful eunuch-Eminem.</p><p>
    
    Computer-havoc beguilingly collides with Eastern/ancient elements throughout <i>1958</i>, as if Soul-Junk
    is conjuring the logic of the scene in <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> during which the resurrected Judas
    wonders why Christ chose to visit when he did, since there was no mass communication then. And scholars
    are abuzz examining the functional similarities between hypertexts and ancient religious scrolls. Meanwhile,
    I hold out hope that Soul-Junk gets conscripted to soundtrack a <i>Terminator 4: Terry Gilliam Debugs Pixar</i>.

Whereas most geniuses only have to maintain one momentous
    reputation at a time, Vibert has gotten himself embroiled in the renown of Plug, Wagon Christ, Amen Andrews,
    and himself. When this guy dies, he's going to receive ten obituaries on the front page of the <i>Times</i>.
    On <i>YosepH</i>, his first album for Warp, Vibert is torn between the traditional and the modern, pure
    nostalgia and the removed eddying of experimentation.  The album makes a conscious attempt to burrow into
    the glitzy, wondrous world of classic acid house and the infamously resonant and bouncy modulations of the
    Roland TB-303, a machine basically responsible for most of the house and electro of the last twenty years.
    This is, of course, not necessarily a positive attribute.</p><p>
    The problems with reminiscences in techno have been distributed as copiously drawn 700-page schematic tomes
    elsewhere. For now, it will suffice to say that: 1) Acid house has not existed long enough for us to feel
    any nostalgia yet; and 2) Anyone who's ever heard anything from The Belleville 3 knows this is like being
    nostalgic for industrialized hyper-android flying-trains Futureland 2100.  There are a lot of things to be
    nostalgic for; the future is not one of them.  Navigating these predicaments, Vibert gets caught up in the
    303 mentality: the record is named after acid tests, the track titles are ""Synthax"", ""Countdown"", and
    ""ILoveAcid"", and the record sounds like, well... it does not sound like the neighborhood church's youth
    organization.</p><p>
    Much of the album seems to have been entirely composed of snorting, spitting, and dehydrating.
    ""ILoveAcid"", the album's <i>pièce de résistance</i> (for better or worse), accumulates patches of sirens
    and robo-bong hits to underscore a vocoder that, none too subtly, relates its analytically derived position
    on lysergic acid diethylamide (or maybe just music): ""I love acid and the way it makes me move... I love
    acid. I can feel it in my dreams."" ""Countdown"" is all brushing and salivating, hocking gobs of crystal meth
    out over fizzling mission launches and at least four full tracks of clapping. The countdown, pricelessly
    hilarious, goes from ""Ten. Nine. Eight."" to ""Zinc. Blacnh. Redweke. Six. Six. Easy.""</p><p>
    For all Vibert's work on sedatives and therapeutic madcap acid flashbacks, <i>YosepH</i> also contains some
    of his most debauched and bewitching hip-hop since Wagon Christ's <i>Tally Ho!</i>-- gat-brandishing,
    ice-shoveling beats that are more imperturbably confident than MTV's <i>Rich Girls</i> and twice as dangerous.
    On ""Noktup"", the album's standout track, atmospheric clanging abruptly merges into a 24-hour hip-hop factory,
    a mechanical lever imprinting the heaviest beat of our times straight onto our foreheads. Two melodic synths
    are running the operation, and then they start falling behind, Lucy-in-a-Chocolate-Factory style, until the
    track submits to what sounds like a bunch of gun clips being loaded. All in all, the finest techno song to
    ever faithfully express the impetus behind Communism.</p><p>
    Throughout, the sensation is of a flawless incorporation of Vibert's patented vertiginous melodies and
    crisp rhythms into the soul of acid house and early hip-hop.  Still, it's not imperceptible.  Your enjoyment
    of <i>YosepH</i> is fundamentally related to how much you can stand those two genres or Vibert's earlier
    work. There's not enough here to sway you one way or the other, nor enough endeavoring to want to make acid
    house palatable to someone senselessly resistant to it. However, there is one track (""Slowfast"") that
    suggests a reason as to why Vibert has found refuge in the past. Disconcerting at first, it becomes
    apparent that the part where the beat skips <i>is the beat</i>; the rhythm consists entirely of that
    rhythm being interrupted.  It leaves one with the impression that, on the rest of the album, Vibert is
    so far ahead of the game that he's back to where he started.</p></div>"|8463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8463-yoseph/|7.3|Alex Linhardt

Ryan Schreiber]</b><br/>
    For Shawn Carter, the last seven years have been ridiculous.  In 1996, he came up from an impoverished
    childhood in New York's Marcy projects to record a debut that would eventually come to be considered
    one of hip-hop's landmark albums, and spent the succeeding six years dominating <i>Billboard</i> charts,
    filling the East Coast void left by Biggie's death, and building a hip-hop empire to rival Puffy's Bad
    Boy Entertainment.  In that time, he's seen as many failures as successes-- critics panned him for selling
    out after the critical reverence of <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>, <i>La Roc Familia</i> was a disaster from any
    angle, and, by Jay's standards, last year's <i>The Blueprint 2</i> couldn't even claim to be a commercial
    success.  Still, he's come out on top time and again: Today, he's reclaimed the title as hip-hop's reigning
    emcee, and his Rocafella record label, clothing line, and film company together are said to be valued at
    more than $4.4 billion.</p><p>
    So why would he want out now, at the peak of his popularity?  <i>The Black Album</i>, touted as his final
    release, offers some answers, though none as clear-cut as what may or may not be the truth: that it's all
    an elaborate publicity stunt.  Or maybe it's not: Jay has cut an album every year for the past seven years;
    that he'd want a break of some sort now is understandable.  Certain lyrics hint that this isn't the last
    record he'll cut, but if that's true, will his game still be as tight when gets around to the comeback?
    It's anyone's guess, and that mystery is part of what makes this album such an intriguing listen.</p><p>
    The prospect of hip-hop's finest producers laying down tracks for the final LP from the rap world's
    brightest talent has made <i>The Black Album</i> one of the most anticipated rap records of the decade.
    What's stunning is that it delivers rap's greatest career-ender since Outkast's <i>Stankonia</i>.  Even
    in falling short of Jay's classics, <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> and 2001's <i>The Blueprint</i>, it manages
    to eclipse 1999's brilliant <i>Vol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter</i> as his third-best album-- which
    in itself makes it one of the year's best.</p><p>
    In light of the hype this record's received for its choice of beatmakers, we egomaniacally matched the
    personalities of our staff writers to Jay's producers.  (However, we regret that we could not take the
    concept to its logical extreme and cease operations after publishing it.)</p><p>
<b>02 December 4th [p. Just Blaze; w. Rollie Pemberton]</b><br/>
    In this game of stick-and-move with triumphantly spiraling Chi-Lites strings, Hova's mother Gloria narrates
    a dizzying tale of growth through adversity, unusual childhood circumstances, and the catalysts for our
    protagonist's career.  The victorious overtone gives Carter the opportunity to apply his unwavering flow
    and powerful control of conceptual direction to his own personal experiences: When he details that he ""had
    demons deep inside that would raise when confronted"" and that ""this is the life I chose, or rather, the
    life that chose me,"" the emotional context of the lines quickly turns to dumbstruck awe.  Regardless of
    the reasonably simple <i>Blueprint</i>-tempered backing and familiar topical terrain, ""December 4th"" stands
    not just as one of Jay's finest performances to date, but Blaze's, too.</p><p>
<b>03 What More Can I Say [p. The Buchannans; w. Hartley Goldstein]</b><br/>
    ""What More Can I Say"" is the sprawling pinnacle of every element that makes <i>The Black Album</i> an
    unrelentingly inspired future classic.  Buchannans, one of two unknown producers featured here, supplies
    a triumphant instrumental that serves as a perfect counterpoint to Jay's trademark hubris and incendiary
    braggadocio.  I mean, the track is introduced by a sample of dialogue from <i>Gladiator</i>: It doesn't
    get more epic than that, people!  Merciless horn blasts, tender guitar licks, and turbulent string
    crescendos distract you when he identifies Martha Stewart as ""Jewish,"" but the one element that makes
    ""What More Can I Say"" a true marvel is that, despite it serving as Jay-Z's alleged last hurrah, it manages
    to sound more like a celebratory changing of the guard than a self-penned elegy by one of hip-hop's
    greatest emcees.</p><p>
<b>04 Encore [p. Kanye West; w. Rob Mitchum]</b><br/>
    It's a little hard to take Jay's claims of retirement at face value when <i>The Black Album</i>'s first
    three songs all claim to be his last and this one makes reference to ""when I come back like Jordan wearing
    the 45.""  But the concept of ""Encore"" makes such nitpicking irrelevant-- a track like this leaves you waiting
    for the comeback.  Kanye West whips up a soul revue backing band complete with melancholy trumpet line and
    miasma-happy backup singers (""Hooo-woahhh-WOAHHH-ohvveee"") for an imaginary mini-gig, while Jay contributes
    a very live-sounding performance.  A posse chants for the hook while an emcee encourages crowd participation
    and the band idles between verses two and three.  Sure, it sounds gimmicky on paper, but if anyone can pull
    it off it's ""rap's Grateful Dead""... whatever that's supposed to mean.  Keep on truckin', Jay.</p><p>
<b>05 Change Clothes [p. Neptunes; w. Ryan Schreiber]</b><br/>
    The first single!  And you know it's a hit already 'cause it's rocking the world's most reliable (and
    expensive) hip-hop production team.  But no, and here's why not: The Neptunes, talented though they may
    be, have spread themselves a bit thin lately, coasting on Neptunes-by-numbers beats and Pharrell's
    by-now-goddamn-insidious falsetto.  ""Change Clothes"" is, unfortunately, one of their worst productions
    since Busta's ""Pass the Courvoisier""-- the vapid, forgettable chorus and cheesy piano loop are the obvious
    product of an off day in the studio.  Jay fares no better, like he almost <i>knows</i> it's subpar-- just
    spits out a couple recycled lines, and forgoes his visual style to make room for crap like, ""Young Hov in
    the house it's so necessary/ No bra with the blouse it's so necessary/ No panties and jeans that's so
    necessary.""  If they could afford to cut the Dre-produced ""The Theater"", surely this-- one of two Neptunes
    productions on a 14-track album-- could have been scrapped, too.</p><p>
<b>06 Dirt Off Your Shoulder [p. Timbaland; w. William Bowers]</b><br/>
    If you're old, you probably macked in a maroon Fiero ten years ago, listening to Timbaland ""get sticky""
    with Jodeci.  If you're young, you could still spot him behind the curtain of this anthem's anti-syncopation
    and arcade-shogun keyboard coils.  Don't be fooled by the title; the song is not a cave-in to Charlotte Beers
    (the dandruff-shampoo ad-exec who was until recently Bush's Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy
    and Public Affairs), but that doesn't stop it from being a commercial for itself and its brand.  Recapping
    the story of how Jay clambered from shooting birds at God while holding his testicles to being synonymous
    with overexposure, the song lives and dies by Timbaland's battering-ram beat and laser-tag riff.  ""Dirt"" is
    gregarious but exclusive: It's meant to shake balcony barstools, but it coyly congratulates only those who
    have been beaten down.  The chorus is about shedding a stigma, about the actualization of a capitalist dream,
    about legitimacy, about arrival-- for a guy ending his career, Jay's tone is suspiciously akin to pre-game
    smack.  Because I'm old, I hear the Joeski Love (""Pee Wee's Dance"") in Jay-Z's obtuse voice.  Because I'm
    young, I acknowledge that he's larger than, er, life.</p><p>
<b>07 The Threat [p. 9th Wonder; w. Sam Chennault]</b><br/>
    I can't decide what's stranger: that Little Brother producer 9th Wonder contributed a track on Jay-Z's final
    album, or that he's flipping a sample of R. Kelly.  But it's 2003, and the entire underground/mainstream
    divide has been so flipped and conflated that it should come as no surprise.  Nor should 9th's tendency to
    sound both hopelessly derivative and endlessly enjoyable; the track's rolling piano line and classic boom-bap
    breakbeat recall a smoother Primo, or a Pete Rock on autopilot.</p><p>
    Given a title like ""The Threat"" and Jigga's infamous street credentials, you'd expect a fairly macabre
    affair, but remember: This is a post-therapy Jigga (who dates Beyoncé and listens to Coldplay), not the
    crack slinger <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> introduced us to in '96.  As such, the tone of the track is more
    comical than maudlin, and Cedric the Entertainer's guest spot won't let you forget it.  Here, Jigga puts
    Larry King on his ass and namedrops Christina Aguilera, Bill O'Reilly, George Bush, Halle Berry, Warren
    Buffet, Joe Pesci, Sammy Davis Jr., Jet Li, David Blaine, and Frank Sinatra, and, in the second verse,
    even tries (only half-successfully) to twist them into verbs a la GZA's ""Fame"".  The song is a disappointment,
    unfortunately-- an easy concept lazily executed.  There are a couple of decent lines (e.g. ""I will kill you,
    commit suicide, and kill you again""), but it's far from Jay's finest hour.</p><p>
<b>08 Moment of Clarity [p. Eminem; w. Ryan Schreiber, c/o Mullah Omar]</b><br/>
    We asked Mullah Omar to write this part but he wanted all kinds of special treatment.  Man, you should
    have seen his rider, it was totally nuts!  It just proves Mullah makes the perfect Eminem: he's got his
    gimmick (""I WILL NOT BE EDITED!!!"") and he just keeps beating you with it over and over.  But for his
    outrageous demands, he still hits it out of the park; the same can't be said for Em, whose shit is all
    just the same these days: You get your minor-chord, downtempo horror-esque piano sample (a white boy
    copping a white boy-- where's Shadow's kickback on that shit?), your loping/plodding canned beat, some
    ominous strings, and you're done.  The only difference between this and his <i>Blueprint</i> track,
    ""Renagade"", is that his sound was slightly less tired two years ago.  Jay, fortunately, delivers a
    determined verse about his father's death, and one for Beanie Sigel.  But saying he wants to ""rhyme like
    Common Sense""?  I cannot express my disappointment.</p><p>
<b>09 99 Problems [p. Rick Rubin; w. Brent DiCrescenzo]</b><br/>
    Ain't-It-Cool rumor has it Hollywood plans for a live-action <i>Transformers</i> film.  Feasibility of
    visual effects aside, the true question of the production is how to modernize Soundwave, the behemoth
    audio cassette ""ghetto blaster"" Transformer, for the MP3 generation.  To the director, take a note from
    Rick Rubin's Jay-Z soundbomb: Keep it old school.  Some studio suit surely wants a giant robot iPod
    smashing trucks, but the original concept still slays.  Likewise, ""99 Problems"" towers over <i>The Black
    Album</i>'s supposedly forward-looking tracks.  Carrying the Decepticon analogy: The 808 kick quakes like
    Rumble's pistons.  As the back of his toy box boasts, Frenzy's ""screaming voice and belligerent manner
    alone could shake up an opponent, but he can enhance this effect by spinning the drum-like devices in his
    torso.""  So, too, does Rubin eject seismic, metallic blasts from his deck's chest like tornado-thrown
    telephone poles taking out a, um, transformer.</p><p>
    After years of intimate, acoustic productions for Johnny Cash and Tom Petty and his sawing work with Slayer
    and System of a Down, ""99 Problems"" re-establishes Rubin as THE mutherfucker with a swami's beard who
    invented this minimalist trunk rumble.  And unlike any other track on this record, it can be said that
    Jay's vocals matter little.  Close inspection reveals dubious claims such as, ""Got beef with radio/ If I
    don't play their show/ They don't play my hits/ Well, I don't give a shit.""  His lips rip like Lazerbeak,
    but the meaning is inconsequential.  Do Jay's problems run deeper than Rocawear inseam durability or
    Bentley electrical recalls?  His self-aware braggadocio goes back to those days of comedic Jamaican
    toasts, which potentially amuse if you're ever tempted to turn down the volume.</p><p>
<b>10 Public Service Announcement [p. Just Blaze; w. Rollie Pemberton]</b><br/>
    Dictating to a labored ringing piano roll and a thunderously high-toned extended organ riff, Jay-Z once
    again decimates his peers in their own game, handling the school of violent hubris in a manner that
    embodies not just mere lyrical supremacy but actual metaphorical depth.  Hova is one of few artists who
    can ask his listenership to follow his fashion sense while simultaneously schooling the talent pool on
    rhyming style in a single line: ""I got a hustler's spirit, nigga, period/ Check out my hat, yo, peep the
    way I wear it.""  It's also a way of saying that the genre's old hat to him these days, even while it was
    his style that so ridiculously raised the bar.  A bold statement among bold statements, this track is
    mastery of a style, regardless of brevity, repetition, or random use of quotations.</p><p>
<b>11 Justify My Thug [p. DJ Quik; w. Chris Dahlen]</b><br/>
    The big story behind this track is that Madonna was supposed to give it live vocals but couldn't make
    the deadline.  Instead, they went with Sharlotte Gibson, a longtime backup vocalist for Whitney Houston,
    who pulls off an adequate impression.  The track is all about DJ Quik's electro beat, though, which starts
    out whomping and wears itself out through repetition.  Sadly, not much else happens.  It's easy to tag
    this as the simplest, weakest moment on the record-- I don't think anyone could reasonably contest that--
    but on the other hand, it is nice 'n' nasty, and hilarious for how it makes Jay's thug life lyrics so
    unromantic and just-for-show.  The lyrics moan on about gangsta code and social ills, but over that beat,
    he just sounds like he wants to get some ass on his face.</p><p>
<b>12 Lucifer [p. Kanye West; w. Rob Mitchum]</b><br/>
    On first listen, ""Lucifer"" comes off a bit too close to flavor-of-the-month material for an album that
    promised to avoid easy singles: The accelerated Max Romeo sample could be construed as pandering to the
    Jamaican influences back in favor with hip-hop, and the refrain, ""I'm from the murder capitol where we
    murder for capital,"" is wordplay a little too beginner's-level for Hov.  Fortunately, his verses make up
    for these slights by following an incredibly intricate structure, somehow managing to land on religious
    imagery every time the sample comes up, while Kanye's beat retains a snaky bounce without going down the
    obvious ragga route.  If it does indeed end up a single, like ""Beware of the Boys"" it'll still be jagged
    enough to stand out in the trend-pile.</p><p>
<b>13 Allure [p. Neptunes; w. Ryan Schreiber]</b><br/>
    This is more like it.  The Neptunes come back hard from their substandard earlier offering, riding a string
    section slick enough to rival Love Unlimited, a pulsing kick/snare combo, and gunshots for percussive effect
    and good measure.  Jay is particularly on point, killing line after line like a <i>Blueprint</i> standout.
    It's the penultimate Jay-Z track ever, and buoyed on that stormy, oceanic orchestra, Hov comes damn close
    to teary-eyed: ""Shit, I know how this movie ends/ Still I play/ The starring role in <i>Hovito's Way</i>.""
    ""Allure"" is Jay in eternal struggle with his vices, confident as ever he can give up the game, but even the
    title forebodes.  He knows, and when the Neptunes downshift and the chorus kicks in, reality strikes: ""But
    every time I felt that was that, it called me right back/ OHHH NOOOO!""  This is the sound of a career high.</p><p>
<b>14 My 1st Song [p. Aqua and Joe ""3H"" Weinberger; w. Scott Plagenhoef]</b><br/>
    After spending most of the record summing up his life and career, Jay thankfully doesn't try to end it
    with the Cliff's Notes version.  He instead handles his ""second major breakup"" by coupling his typically
    self-celebratory language with avuncular advice-- from himself and Biggie, who drops in from the afterlife--
    and a rare display of humility.  Throughout the sentimental closer, Jay keeps his chin up and makes the
    song cry with emotive, bolero-tinged production from the previously unknown team of Aqua and Joe ""3H""
    Weinberger.  Always the entrepreneur, Hova abdicates his throne and slips into his full-time CEO role with
    a series of almost memoir-like shoutouts that double as teasers for his upcoming bio, <i>The Black Book</i>--
    in stores soon!</p></div>"|4219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4219-the-black-album/|8.0|The Pitchfork Staff

    war in pursuit of unclear goals, the Palestinians and Israelis were at each others' throats, and Bob Barker
    was hosting <i>The Price Is Right</i>.  Just a coincidence, I guess, but I couldn't help noticing just how
    resolutely the same these and many other things have remained over the decades as Communism collapsed, the
    cost of living exploded, and computers took over our lives.  Mark the Three 4 Tens up as yet another thread
    to the past-- the Philly trio has been all over this <i>Nuggets</i> thing for seven years now, and damned
    if they don't bring 1969 right back to life in the comfort of your living room.</p><p>
    
    They've got the requisite fuzztones and harmonized whoo-hoo-hoo's for the job, and they're newly signed to
    Rainbow Quartz, which is, like, the Lord-God-King of retro 60s revivalism in the post-Elephant 6 world.
    Their first full-length, 2001's rather ironically titled <i>Change Is On Its Way</i>, evoked the early
    years of experimentation and excess in rock better than a <i>Wonder Years</i> box set, and <i>Taking Northern
    Liberties</i> follows up with basically more of the same.  Things skew a little darker this time around,
    though, as if the band's finally skid straight into drug paranoia.</p><p>
    
    The gaggle of ladies on the cover fiddling with bottles and handfuls of prescription drugs is the first
    indication of this, though the sharpest example is definitely the crunching riffage and muffled screaming
    of ""Whore House and Suicide"", which juxtaposes extremely unintelligible lyrics about just that with spirited
    backing vocals and a bruising drum assault.  ""I Believe"" is a weirdly buoyant acoustic song on which two
    members (I'm not sure which ones) swap verses-- one in a Nick Cave-ish monotone and the other in an amateurish
    yelp.  ""I believe past the clouds/ There's a Heaven floating 'round"" becomes ""I believe past the stars/ It's
    all strip clubs and bars"" just a few seconds later, and sparsely timed wah pedal dribblings keep things
    feeling uneasy as the song stays afloat by clinging to a brightly melodic keyboard.</p><p>
    
    Other songs don't dwell so much on the negative: opener ""Philly Blues"" is all thick harmonies and son-of-the-blues
    guitar hooks; ""Jack the Tripper"" is a bouncy tribute to altered states replete with harmonica and fuzz bass,
    and ""Ride in Style"" catches the glint of chrome on a passing muscle car in its circular guitar riff.  But
    nothing quite tops the slow-burning psych of ""My Stoned Ass"" for sheer escapist thrill.  It starts as a
    slow build of pick slides and cymbals, but finally grows impatient and, after about a minute, takes that
    elevator straight to the thirteenth floor, drums crashing, guitars digging in and maniacally chanted verses
    alternating with big, chunky choruses.  The band slides into an old-fashioned freakout from there, a reverse
    build that pares back from guitar solos and violent drumming to heaving bass and creaking organs, decaying
    into something like a lost take of Pink Floyd's ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene"" before growling back for
    one last chorus.</p><p>
    
    There's really only one head-scratcher here, and that's the closer (though it's listed on the sleeve as
    the penultimate track), ""Manned Space Flight"".  It's not necessarily bad, just totally incongruous-- rather
    than plunking me down a few minutes after LBJ left office, this bleepy instrumental sounds like what'll
    probably be on the radio while I'm vertical parking my hover car outside the Social Security office in
    2064.  It's like K-Tel closing out a garage-rock comp with a St. Etienne song, and makes no sense in this
    context.  But aside from the confusion that move causes, the Three 4 Tens have once again managed to play

    inexplicably produce bands whose music has risen to monumentally epic heights. Throughout the 90s, benchmark
    indie groups like Pavement, Archers of Loaf, Sebadoh, and Guided by Voices all adopted an unapologetically
    lo-fi aesthetic in order to not only combat the monotony of the mainstream with inexorable layers of
    distortion and healthy doses of irony, but to also create an entirely new language of sonic possibility
    for music as a whole.  However, while in 2003 many of indie's founding fathers are either off chasing
    classic rock fantasies, trading in their distortion pedals for Sun Ra records, or releasing greatest hits
    collections, an inevitable new breed seems hard at work.</p><p>
    
    Take, for instance, the enigmatic new duo, Parsley Sound: Sounding like the vibrant lovechild of Badly Drawn
    Boy's melodic lo-fi folk, The Beta Band's beat-conscious noodling, and the Suppy Furry Animals' penchant for
    60s psychedelia, <i>Parsley Sounds</i> is one of those rare records that manage to sound modest while
    frequently pushing the sonic envelope.  This realization comes as quite a surprise, given that Danny
    Sargassa and Preston Mead, the brainchildren behind Parsley Sound, have only released a handful of EPs
    (one of which being under their alter-ego, Slum) prior to recording this glorious debut for James Lavelle's
    Mo'Wax label.</p><p>
    
    From the melodic boho strum of the aptly titled opener, ""Ease Yourself and Glide"", to the pensive suave
    soul of ""Candlemice"", each song here seems to organically unfold layer by layer like budding pedals,
    revealing subtle sonic nuances.  Rather than fracturing the landscape of each song with maniacal floods
    of distortion, Parsley Sound script a new sonic vocabulary by merging fundamental elements from disparate
    genres, and in turn construct new contexts for these sounds to flourish. For instance, on the Technicolor
    wonder of ""YoYo"", a meditative Rhodes piano motif gives way to a choppy insistent drum loop, only to be
    followed by crashes of rolling pastoral acoustic guitars, hushed vocal harmonies, irrepressible bursts of
    flute, and the blissful shimmer of it all interweaving together.  While on the tripped-out melancholy of
    ""Twilight Mushrooms"", the group immerses the lyrics, ""Dream, that's all I do,"" within a dreamy accompaniment
    all its own; gloomy Wurlitzer chords rub shoulders with the breezy muted bop of brush drum sticks,
    syncopated guitar strums, and layers of tape-hiss.</p><p>
    
    The most impressive aspect of Parsley Sounds, though, is the fact that despite the group's own diverse
    aspirations, the album never comes across as simply an exercise in studio trickery, two producers just
    trying to unify dissimilar elements for the sake of doing so.  <i>Parsley Sounds</i>, rather, overflows
    with memorable melodies and inspired songcraft.  The meditative psychedelia of ""Ocean House"", with its
    shimmering electric guitars, and wandering harpsichord lines, sounds like a brilliant 2003 remix of The
    Beatles' classic, ""For No One"", while the unrelenting catchiness of ""Ease Yourself and Glide"", which
    imparts a leading melody straight out of the Elliott Smith songbook, is a beautifully hushed forestal
    ode with clanging, playworn percussion-- just the kind of lushly orchestrated, lo-fi pop expedition with
    which this album is packed tight.  Debut albums rarely come this fully realized, but with <i>Parsley
    Sounds</i>, this Watford-based duo have stumbled onto the kind of uniquely inspired sound that could
    influence tomorrow's indie rock as deeply as yesterday's has inspired them.</p></div>"|6530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6530-parsley-sounds/|8.8|Hartley Goldstein

    identity.  Unless your crew has a fresh face, new sound or interesting persona, they'll sink instantly into
    the pop culture quagmire folks call independent obscurity.  Such is the hurdle now facing Embedded's new
    Brooklyn protégés, Babbletron.</p><p>
    Consisting of Jaymanila, Calm-Pete and producer DJ Pre, the Babbletron team take their no-frills boom-bap
    to various platitudes, from regrets about the nature of time (""The Clock Song"") to discontent with the
    artificial aspects of life (""SpecialFX"") to an idiosyncratic (yet unfortunately corny) trip into outer
    space (""Space Tech Banana Clip""). Issues arise with personal taste regarding the vocalists: Jaymanila
    comes off like a smoke-free LoDeck, while Calm-Pete has a relaxed droll that recalls a more serious,
    introspective, and possibly sedated Edan.</p><p>
    While most of the album stands purely solid, ""Birds"" is the obvious triumph on <i>Mechanical Royalty</i>,
    and it may be one of the best songs of the year.  An extended metaphor for promiscuous women, the boys
    play devil's advocate to her irresistible whoredom while Calm-Pete, rapping with a pleasantly slow, light
    cadence reminiscent of Slick Rick, warns, ""Beware of the succubus, out to belittle us/ She's a perfect
    stranger, don't be ridiculous!"" Over a xylophone and hard drum display, Jaymanila also hops into the fray,
    detailing how ""you want her to want you, but she's just a cheap trick"" and ""the roles that she play don't
    have hit points or Bilbo."" It isn't often that a song about such a common topic can end up so cleverly
    distinct.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the production here is largely inconsistent.  The crew's producer and scratch handler DJ
    Pre has a traditional beat approach that often seems to lack any kind of pulse, with few change-ups or
    even interesting samples.  Ese and Hipsta, saviors of LoDeck's fantastic debut EP <i>Bash It!</i>, also
    appear, but fail to bring quite enough talent to distract from the lackluster production.  Luckily, Rjd2
    comes by to drop lounge piano, swirling windy cavern choir and entangled guitar lines on ""The Clock Song"",
    while MF Doom swings his way through theme show horns and a speedy break on ""Space Tech Banana Clip"" for
    a massive payoff.</p><p>
    Although they occasionally drop clever lines (""Sometimes I spit it so raw, the Japanese think I'm edible/
    Oedipal, it ain't complex to see why you cry mommy""), Babbletron's song structures and lyrics come off as
    run-of-the-mill intelligent boom-bap, among the most vanilla offerings of the underground, regardless of
    their obviously noble intentions. The beats are weak, the record's too short, and the songs kind of blend
    together in a monotonous mash.  While still a remotely interesting debut full-length, it leaves far too
    much to be desired.</p></div>"|1092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1092-mechanical-royalty/|5.9|Rollie Pemberton

    nor the music categorized as such (i.e. 99% of the populace), you could do
    worse than to put on a Plaid record. With a history stretching back to the
    formative days of post-techno, including a contribution Warp Records' seminal
    <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> compilation (the duo was then working with
    Ken Downie as Black Dog Productions, but their track was released under the
    name I.A.O.), Plaid strikes me as the prototypical IDM act.  Aphex Twin and
    Autechre, both of whom were also featured on <em>AI</em>, have developed too
    unpredictably; their records can go anywhere.  Plaid, on the other hand,
    continue to refine and develop their early sound.</p><p>
    But back to the hapless no-IDM-knowin' subject of our experiment: What would
    he call Plaid if we were to throw on a record?  My guess is ""techno.""  ""Techno""
    is in its widespread usage among casual music fans is a catchall term for any
    danceable electronic music.  Depeche Mode were called techno when I was in
    college, back before anyone had heard of Derrick May, and when Eminem dismissed
    Moby because ""nobody listens to techno"" only serious music heads questioned the
    accuracy of his label.  That someone without an interest in electronic music
    subgenres (which, again, is almost everybody) might describe Plaid as such is
    ironic because, in fact, they <em>are</em> much closer to the ideal of sleek
    Detroit techno of the Belleville Three than most of their Warp roster brethren.
    Unlike Aphex or Ae, Plaid have never been particularly interested in texture
    in the micro sense; they're quite content to let their synths sound the way
    ""futuristic"" synths sounded in the late 80s and early 90s. Plaid has always
    been more about the rhythmic and arrangement possibilities of digital music,
    which puts them closer to where the music started.</p><p>
    In the past Plaid sprinkled their sober post-techno with playful experiments
    and excursions into the rhythms and sonic signifiers of cultures not usually
    associated with their kind of music (Latin America, the Far East); with
    <em>Spokes</em>, Plaid offers their most focused vision yet. A consistent mood
    is carried through most of these ten tracks, and it can be characterized with
    words familiar to people who listen to a lot of IDM: reflective and mysterious,
    with an occasional tension verging on paranoia. Beats are everywhere, but
    they're never danceable nor do they seem to be the focus of any specific
    track. Instead, percussion here mostly serves the traditional function of
    marking time while the swirl of synths builds and develops.
    </p><p>
    The interplay of the sounds on <em>Spokes</em> is occasionally striking. The
    rapid, overlapping sequences of ""Crumax Rins"" lock together to form a
    constantly shifting tapestry of sound, the sonic equivalent to a vibrating
    field of colors that transforms completely every time you blink. The acid
    arpeggios that mark the lead-in to ""Upona"" have a similar effect, introducing
    the world of the track as a place of speed and random twitches, where the
    vibrations just beneath the surface of awareness are disorienting.  The opening
    bass throbs of ""Marry"" suggest a celestial scene-- some sort of deep space
    docking station, perhaps.  But then the peppy (if malnourished) drums kick
    in, and the focus turns to the swirl of synths that lag behind the beat and
    coagulate into a bland but pretty melody that, unfortunately, doesn't seem
    a galaxy away from Mannheim Steamroller.
    </p>
<p>
    Indeed, there are some dull moments on <em>Spokes</em>, but plucking tracks
    from the record and turning them around under the magnifying glass probably
    misses what Plaid intended (this one seems meant to be listened to in succession).
    For my money, the highlights on the album come during the tracks that depart
    from the album's script. ""Get What You Gave"" has pads that sound like an
    electronic steel drum carrying the melody, and that combined with the
    polyrhythmic stop/start beat evoke a light, airy Latin feel. And then ""B
    Born Droid"" is like a cyborg waltz, with a patient, shuffling gait and a
    minor key synth lead. These standouts are open and full of possibility
    amid tracks that seem content to work within narrowly defined parameters
    established years ago. Plaid do both very well, mind you, but I find myself
    wishing the ratios were reversed.

May cause loss of patience in otherwise open-minded listeners.</i></p><p>
    
    If you're already a fan of 23 Skidoo, you're probably wont to ignore that warning.  You already know that,
    throughout their brief existence in the early 1980s, 23 Skidoo were an exceedingly inaccessible outfit,
    offering their clattering, mostly undanceable brand of noise-blighted funk in strictly linear doses.  They
    rarely stuck with a groove for long, preferring instead to tease their audience with five-second bursts of
    straightforward rhythm and melody and shred expectations mere moments later.  But even if you're intimately
    familiar with a record like their 1982 debut <i>Seven Songs</i>, you're not likely prepared for what's on
    this disc.</p><p>
<i>Seven Songs</i> has justifiably been hailed lately as something of a classic of the post-punk era, a
    concise, pointed attack on the senses that contains most of the band's easiest listening in tightly
    governed chunks of collapsing funk.  Their final album (discounting a 2000 reunion LP), 1984's <i>Urban
    Gamelan</i>, largely eschewed the harmonic elements of <i>Seven Songs</i> for a more bare-bones,
    percussion-focused approach to the sound, accented by the occasional relapse to white noise or sputtering
    bass.  It's a far more abstract final product, and a difficult listen for those seeking some sort of
    immediate payoff.</p><p>
    
    As uncompromising and abrasive as <i>Urban Gamelan</i> is, though, <i>The Culling Is Coming</i> makes it
    look like a hippie drum circle by comparison.  Originally released between their other two albums, <i>The
    Culling</i> was never meant to embody a statement of purpose by the band, but instead to merely document
    a pair of live experiments in industrial noise-making (this reissue appends a third) for posterity.  This
    helps explain why it's just now reaching CD for the first time, but it also helps explain why it's the one
    23 Skidoo recording nobody ever really talks about.</p><p>
    
    The performances themselves are entirely freeform explorations of pure sound, with no real sense of build
    or release, which is really where the disc falters as a listening experience.  The first performance, given
    the over-arching name ""A Winter Ritual"", was performed at Dartington Music College by brothers Johnny and
    Alex Turnbull, the band's two key members, using Gamelan, gongs, flute, and kendang drums, and it's the
    most straightforward section of the disc.  The duo moves through a series of loose improvisations built on
    repetitive patterns performed on the Gamelan and Kendang, hanging snatches of nearly melodic flute just
    out of the listener's reach.  Unfortunately, rather than use the intriguing textures they develop as
    building blocks for something bigger, only once do they actually choose to develop them, on ""G-3
    Insemination"", wherein some sort of tambourine-like percussion instrument is used to lend a sense of
    urgency to certain passages, thus giving at least a sense of development.</p><p>
    
    ""A Summer Rite"" is much darker, inhabiting the same headspace as dark ambient pioneers Current 93 and Nurse
    with Wound.  The Turnbulls are joined by Fritz Catlin, and all three are credited with ""Metal Percussion"".
    Most of the sounds seems to be coming from tape manipulations, though, as crunching, buzzing, scraping and
    animalesque human utterances dominate the proceedings.  The fact that this was recorded at the 1982 W.O.M.A.D.
    World Music Festival is almost funny-- I can't imagine what a W.O.M.A.D. audience must have thought of
    these guys, heads shaven clean, faces painted with camouflage patterns, assaulting them with a minimalist
    collage of inscrutable sound.</p><p>
    
    ""Move Back - Bite Harder"", the bonus offering on this reissue, is perhaps the most interesting, featuring
    a series of heavily manipulated looping vocal samples and fleeting snatches of squealing and incidental
    noise, but as it drags on for 27 minutes, it's hard to stay focused on it.  <i>The Culling Is Coming</i>
    is of primary interest for devoted noiseniks, people with huge amounts of shelf space devoted to Throbbing
    Gristle, Clock DVA, Nurse with Wound, and the like.  As a fan of 23 Skidoo and an admitted dabbler in
    the world of dark ambient and noise, I can't recommend <i>The Culling Is Coming</i> to anyone else, really,
    though it is an interesting document of a challenging band at their most confrontational.</p></div>"|8245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8245-the-culling-is-coming/|6.1|Joe Tangari

The lesson today concerns the issue of paradox,
    'cause this record unfolds like a case fresh out of Webster's: Despite its show of technical proficiency,
    <i>Muted</i>, the latest full-length outing from Anticon producer Alias, suffers for lack of sentiment or
    expressive accomplishment.  The album's desolate, downbeat production provides the album with a sense of
    internal subversion, and also represents a pinnacle of craftsmanship, but the tracks are sterile and
    underdeveloped, suffocating and slumbering through a heavy-handed hour of dirty industrial drum rhythms
    and distorted glitchwork.</p><p>
    
    Breaking almost completely from Alias' hip-hop backlog, <i>Muted</i> is largely instrumental, with the
    exception of one rhyme-laden track near the record's end, and the unfortunate ""Unseen Sights"", where The
    Notwist's Markus Acher lends his tender vocals in a potentially perfect fit-- one which at least had the
    barebones makings to parallel his own work in tone and vibrancy. Unfortunately, Acher's insouciant mastery
    of crestfallen sobriety is dredged from a metallic sea of mercurial and wandering breakbeats.  Even his own
    lyrics, which clumsily allude to American media hiding the bigger picture and abstracting the truth, fail
    to make a positive impact, and instead freeze him as a caricature of anti-war/anti-consumer backlash.  The
    track's structure and application are too sterile to play on Acher's emotive prowess, and the near-miss
    collaboration stings, feeling at best like a Notwist demo.</p><p>
    
    Much of the album rides a rocky terrain of wandering breakbeats and ambient under/overtones, but a handful
    of well-realized moments thankfully save the record from infamy.  ""Full Circle Blues"" is a windy, sensual
    breath on a metal playground full of robots.  ""Am I Cool Now?"", a moment of self-conscious reflection,
    features the vocal snippet, ""Anticon ain't hip-hop yo/ They try to hard to be weird/ They're only popular
    on the Internet/ It's just stupid nerd rap,"" amidst a slaughtering barrage of drums and heavy beats. ""Chew
    the Fat"", the record's standout, then slides in with an echoing, searching, teeter-totter affair of lively
    electronic manipulations and release/relapse drumwork.  Additionally, the closer (with the exception of
    the 15-minute break to hide the hidden track) carries the torch of capability with a nice use of space and
    a more focused compositional design.</p><p>
    
    Of course, I'm not out to deprive anyone of their sole sanctuary, being that I might fall into the category
    of Internet-nerd-critic-- and, as <i>Muted</i> loudly proclaims, Alias is too well informed and knows the
    game too well to succumb to pressure-- but if he turned some of the knobs down just a bit, and turned up
    the heat, maybe I could hear a little better.</p></div>"|409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/409-muted/|6.0|William Morris

The ten <em>Fishtank</em> albums released so far-- featuring bands like June of 44, Low + Dirty Three,     Tortoise + The Ex, and Willard Grant Conspiracy + Telefunk-- all follow the same template: the label grabs     bands that are touring through Holland, sticks them in a studio for a couple of days (most don't even     rehearse) and persuades them to cut records that are more experimental, offbeat and, critically, more     casual than they would ever make in their normal studio time.  Although strict jazz and improv artists     toss out live records and unrehearsed meet-ups as a matter of course-- <em>Some Guys That Showed Up at the     Velvet Lounge, Vol. 3</em> or what have you-- it's rarer for avant-rock, post-rock and jazz-informed bands     to just scribble out an album and release it: LPs are events, and even EPs are policy statements.</p><p>It's telling that even with bands as adventurous as Norway's Motorpsycho and Jaga Jazzist, it's hard to     imagine any of their albums coming out as loose or random as this thrown-together EP.  Jaga Jazzist--     represented here by their horn section-- is the jazz/fusion/techno nonet known for their densely pancaked     instrumentals and gymnastic arrangements.  Motorpsycho is a long-running psych-rock band, extremely popular     in their home country, whose work jumps from classic rock jams and pastoral acoustics to hypercatchy     psychedelia.  (Their latest record, <em>It's a Love Cult</em>, serves as a great introduction.)</p><p>The Jaga Jazzist horns have tagged along on a few Motorpsycho tours and done session work on their records,     but <em>In the Fishtank</em> is their first real two-way collaboration.  On the Mingus-referencing ""Doffen Ah     Um"", a typically knotty Jazzist instrumental rubs against Motorpsycho's rock drums and grungy rhythm guitar;     the soft psych-folk song ""Pills, Powders and Passion Play"" gets an extended instrumental break, highlighted     by Mathias Eick's muted trumpet.</p>
<p>These horn players are so identified by their tight ensemble work that it's a revelation to hear them play     slow, almost drifting passages-- like when Jørgen Munkeby takes extended flute solos that evoke the dry     desert sound of Julius Hemphill.  And they come to the rescue when Motorpsycho ham their way through the     Art Ensemble of Chicago's ""Theme de Yoyo"": while the singers go for a ""you had to be there"" delivery of     the loopy lyrics, the horns' punchy funk salvages the song.</p>
<p>But the clincher here is the last track, the twenty-minute ""Tristano"": building on a repeated motif that     crackles with energy, the ensemble plinks and clatters up a mammoth arc, climbing with the nervous     deliberateness of a rollercoaster until the theme comes in at minute thirteen and the band careens through     the denouement.  A free jazz structure tempered by pop urges, it does nothing more nor less than show off     how well the bands spark off each other, in a setting that's more open than you may ever get from these     guys again.  And it's just the culmination of the ""anything goes"" aesthetic that makes this whole record     so enjoyable-- that in a setting like this, the musicians can reveal themselves in ways that you never     get from their normal work.  It's one of the strongest records in the <em>Fishtank</em> series to date, and     at times, it's damn near definitive.</p></div>"|5560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5560-in-the-fishtank/|7.5|Chris Dahlen

    Boys, Vitalic and, most of all, Michael Mayer.  Whenever a new Mayer project is announced, it serves as a
    reminder of how few of his productions have been released.  Yet whenever I hear these projects-- whether
    they be remixes, another release on his peerless tech-house label, Kompakt, or his ground-shifting mixes--
    I'm reminded how thankful I am that he's at least out there doing what he does.</p><p>
    The latest work from Mayer is his contribution to one of London club/label Fabric's mix series. Fabric's
    label division has been spoiling us recently with outstanding contributions from Swayzak (<i>Fabric 11</i>)
    and Jacques Lu Cont (<i>Fabrclive.9</i>), among others, but this is arguably the strongest release in its
    history. Incredibly, it also challenges 2000's <i>Immer</i> as the best release in Mayer's catalog,
    effortlessly drawing from his own Kompakt pool as well as eight other labels, including Playhouse, Plong,
    and Volt.</p><p>
    Like most of Fabric's releases, Mayer's record is made with the dancefloor in mind so it's more ferocious
    than <i>Immer</i>, but like that dissection of the blissed-out end of German microhouse, it retains a Big
    Picture overview. In the past, Mayer's mixes have often seemed to be an attempt at taking a definitive
    snapshot of a particular sound from <i>Neuhouse</i>'s mission statement, from the effortlessly blended,
    almost soothing and silken <i>Immer</i> to the schaffelfieber of Mayer's recent Peel Session (which is
    available only on mp3, not that we endorse that sort of thing, etc.) to the collection of Kompakt's more
    banging 12\xA5\xA5 sounds on <i>Speciher</i>. Instead, <i>Fabric 13</i> is a more eclectic set, blending the
    differences between the seductive warmth and melody-- and increasingly pop and nu-glam-- sounds of Kompakt
    and adding underlying tones of menace and melancholy.</p><p>
    Connecting the dots between elements of not only his own label but of German tech-house as a whole, Mayer
    offers a panoramic view of the scene. He even steps overground on a couple of occasions, utilizing both
    Jackson's Midnight Fuck remix of ""Run into Flowers"" by French nu-shoegazers and Pitchfork faves M83 and
    a remix of Westban's German hit ""Oldschool, Baby"". With vocals by Nena (of ""99 Luftballoons"" fame), who
    wields her retro charm as a weapon, ""Oldschool, Baby"" flits between quoting small elements of Italo-piano
    and acid house and 80s electro, drawing on the charms of the past without ever rooting itself in one place
    and time. ""We are the moment/ Here to last,"" Nena claims on a track that even outdoes the set's other great
    pop moments, the pair of mixes of Heiko Voss' contagious ""I Think About You"" that bookend the mix. (Voss'
    oftentimes partner Thomas Schaeben appears twice, including a collaboration with Geiger and Schad Privat
    called ""Really Real"", a swoon song whose superfluous title fits its overflowing sound.)</p><p>
    Elsewhere, the always thrilling Superpitcher is represented by his <i>Total 5</i> glam-shuffle track
    ""Mushroom"", and a newer Mayer favorite, Richard Davis, is tossed into the mix a couple of times-- most
    memorably on ""Bring Me Closer"", a nightmare filled with haunting skips and jumps, baroque strings that
    seem to move in multiple directions at once, and an uneasy central pulse.</p><p>
    The central pulse on <i>Fabric 13</i>, Villalobos' ""Easy Lee"", is more of a solemn, battered lub. One of
    the highlights of his <i>Alcachofa</i> album, the Chilean ex-pat's woozy, weak vocodered voice sounds even
    more ominous and mournful among the near-gothic tones of Mayer's mix. Villalobos' work is a fitting
    foundation for this record, a mix of surging, sharp dance rhythms which never build to any of the kind
    of overpowering peaks that could keep home listeners and/or tech-house novices at arm's length.</p><p>
    Every so often Mayer will get the odd criticism that he's simply an excellent ringleader and idea man,
    sort of the Dave Eggers of tech-house. Well, that line of talk is frankly wrong. He expertly scouts and
    attracts the talent, sequences the tracks, and sets the tone for the entire sound-- despite his own
    productions remaining sadly few and far between.  Michael Mayer's two mixes and his Peel Session mark
    him as one of the year's most vital artists, a sort of weatherman who determines which way the wind
    blows in Berlin, Cologne, and any place where ears are cocked.</p></div>"|5551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5551-fabric-13/|8.5|Scott Plagenhoef

    quirky boy/girl rapport, a preoccupation with 1950s, noir-heavy American kitsch, The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's
    discography memorized in full, and a 20-minute debut EP recorded exclusively in B-flat minor, without a
    single track eeking over three minutes long.  It was late 2002, and (kudos, <i>NME</i>!) the public's
    interest in consuming a boundless barrage of backstory-hype had been waning for months; <i>Whip It On!</i>
    was a tiring proposition, both sonically and contextually, its thick, repetitive post-punk guitars and
    yawning, aimless vocals making its brief playtime feel like a whole shitload longer.</p><p>
<i>Chain Gang of Love</i>, The Raveonettes' shiny major label debut, is a far less off-putting introduction:
    they've kept up the pop posturing (check founding members Sherin Foo and Sune Rose Wagner bedecked in black
    leather and perched atop motorcycles on their retro film-poster cover, or the fact that this one is played
    exclusively in B-flat <i>major</i>), but all the peripheral jigging is, finally, apropos to something real--
    trading in the dark J&amp;MC; theatrics for bubblegum harmonies and pleasantly saccharine coos, <i>Chain Gang of
    Love</i> is blatantly inspired by coifed, mid-century American pop, with thick, Phil Spector-esque
    production and tightly controlled melodies, each mesmeric hook sufficiently roughed up but still intact.</p><p>
    
    The Raveonettes' reigning aesthetic principle seems to be density, and the heavy, concentrated bulk of
    these songs can occasionally seem impenetrable, a characteristic that's only aggravated by their doubled-up
    vocals, ever-rushing feedback, and ringing, distorted guitars.  Still, if your ears are freshly cleaned,
    it can also be a glorious buzz: now with Manjos Ramdas on guitar and Jakob Hoyer on drums, The Raveonettes'
    incessant B-flat majoring pits scratchy garage effects against sweet, copasetic songwriting, creating an
    internal tension that's curiously compelling.</p><p>
    
    ""Noisy Summer"" opens with handclaps and impeccable harmonies; soon, distorted guitars crash in, throbbing
    until the very end, blanketing everything in an opaque layer of hum.  ""Remember"" is <i>Chain Gang</i>'s
    best, an atmospheric, billowy track with chiming guitar and frothy vocals, a breathless exhalation as full
    as it is weightless.</p><p>
    
    The Raveonettes' rote reinterpretations inevitably grow a little tiresome (closer ""New York Was Great"" is
    imminently forgettable), especially after you've patiently swallowed ten or eleven fizzy versions of the
    exact same thing.  But sweet/sour juxtaposition is their bag, and, lyrically, they've splattered these
    otherwise innocent songs with just enough disjointed teenage sex-drama to stretch interest for a few seconds
    longer than expected: the cloudy bedroom entendres and veiled invitations that haunted the bubblegum tracks
    of the 50s and 60s are suddenly transformed into explicit admissions and/or requests, like ""Little Animal""'s
    honest proclamation that ""My girl is a little animal/ She always wants to fuck/ I can't find a reason why/
    I guess it's just my luck,"" or ""The Love Gang""'s astute observation: ""Chains, black leather, and sex/ Yeah,
    it's not that complex.""</p><p>
    
    The kick is that their quips are still delivered with wide-eyed, <i>Leave It to Beaver</i> earnestness--
    ""Dirty Eyes (Sex Don't Sell)"" sees Wagner and Foo whispering, ""Jimmy says that sex don't sell/ I think
    he's just..."" right before a blissfully sighed, overwhelmingly innocent ""oh well"" swells up.  Blame The
    Raveonettes' questionable grasp of the English language, or their self-imposed key limits, but this is
    the kind of content/delivery, virgin/whore dichotomy that should make Britney Spears quake with envy.</p><p>
    
    At thirty-three minutes long, <i>Chain Gang of Love</i> cuts off right before you start getting up to flip
    off the stereo, proving that The Raveonettes have finally learned how to bow out before their game gets
    unbearable.  Ultimately, <i>Chain Gang</i> suffers from a lack of depth, but it's not so painfully hollow
    that listening isn't kinda fun.</p></div>"|6698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6698-chain-gang-of-love/|7.1|Amanda Petrusich

    of Cambridge's American Repertory Theatre to see the cult-rock musical <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i>,
    the transatlantic, transgender spectacle that took off-Broadway by surprise in 1997 (and Hollywood, to
    a lesser degree, two years later).  Our production of <i>Hedwig</i> has been in planning for a few months
    now, so when Off Records announced earlier this year that they were putting together a <i>Hedwig</i>
    tribute album featuring takes from The Breeders and Yo La Tengo, one producer's pipedream was to get
    these bands to perform in our show-- to be our Angry Inch-- and (this was my idea) to charge $1,000
    a ticket, maybe even $2,000, and buy a couple Camaros.</p><p>
    
    It never happened, of course; there are no Camaros, tickets are actually free, and the tribute, despite
    its initial hype, came out with surprisingly little fanfare.  Entitled <i>Wig in a Box</i>, the entire
    project is pretty straightforward: a rag-tag team of indie rockers and b-rate musical celebrities take
    on the <i>Hedwig</i> songbook of John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask. Musically, the featured acts
    differ in approach to the original songs-- some, like Rufus Wainwright, remain fairly conservative; some,
    like Bob Mould, chance with bombastic trance; and most others hedge their bets somewhere in between the two
    extremes, such as having a woman sing what was originally a man's song as a subtle performatization of
    the title character's gender conflicts.  That said, the best songs on <i>Wig in a Box</i> are the best
    songs from the musical itself; in the end most <i>Hedwig</i> anthems can't mask their true rock musical
    colors, and this compilation, for all its star power, comes off largely as cult novelty.</p><p>
    
    After Rufus Wainwright's decountrification of ""The Origin of Love"", Sleater-Kinney recreate the quirky
    punk fervor of the original ""Angry Inch"", aided by the trademark nasal wail of B-52's co-vocalist Fred
    Schneider whose delivery renews lines like ""when I woke up from the operation I was bleeding down there""
    with unspeakable creepiness. Frank Black adds teeth to the once tongue-in-cheek ""Sugar Daddy"", transforming
    it into a terrifying maniacal rant, while The Polyphonic Spree maintain the Bowie glamour of ""Wig in a Box"",
    but tastefully infuse it with flat-out awesome horn parts, harp and piano lines, and a barrage of E6-like
    sound effects.</p><p>
    
    There seems for <i>Wig in a Box</i> contributors a great challenge of liberating the songs from the musical's
    shackles, and providing them some semblance of autonomy.  Spoon, however, are the only group here to truly
    succeed at this, stripping ""Tear Me Down"" of its boisterous theatricality, butt-rock guitar and lyrical
    symbolism in lines like, ""I made it over the great divide.""  What remains is much more reserved, the guitar
    strumming clean straight eighths over non-confrontational tom work, as Britt Daniel effortlessly delivers
    the song's now-orphaned lyrics.</p><p>
<i>Wig in a Box</i> has its share of lackluster offerings, too: both new songs-- Mitchell and Trask's
    ""Milford Lake"" and Robyn Hitchcock's ""City of Women""-- are largely forgettable.  Jonathan Richman's ""Origin
    of Love Reprise"" degenerates into faux-ska by its end, and Cyndi Lauper and The Minus 5's take on ""Midnight
    Radio"" finds the wash-up drenched in 80s reverb, indulging unconvincing glam tropes and, perhaps most egregiously,
    swallowing the song's lyrics, which could have comprised the delicate original's most interesting element.
    ""Hedwig's Lament/Exquisite Corpse"", the much-discussed collaboration of a noticeably louder Yo La Tengo
    with Yoko Ono, is at first endearing, but ultimately chokes on its incongruity.  And while the original
    ""Nailed"" wasn't the best of songs, Bob Mould just slaughters it here, replacing whatever life it had with
    mindless pre-programmed trance beats and hackneyed Oakenfold through-the-matrix zoomers.</p><p>
    
    This compilation doesn't pretend to be a primer or introduction to <i>Hedwig</i> the musical; the very
    notion of a tribute album demands to some extent knowledge of that to which it pays tribute.  That said,
    anything that keeps this compelling musical in the foreground of popular consciousness is worth something,
    and if a fan of <i>Hedwig</i> happens to be an indie rocker as well, this compilation is a delightful
    wedding.</p></div>"|2027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2027-wig-in-a-box-songs-from-and-inspired-by-hedwig-and-the-angry-inch/|6.8|Nick Sylvester

    patches it seems what was passing for sharp dance music a couple of years
    ago suddenly seemed very far from the dancefloor.  It turns out glitch
    wasn't the future of electronica after all, and being that few had expressed
    a desire for a greater abundance of convulsions at the club prior to 1995, I
    guess it's not surprising.</p><p>
    What's surprising is the lay of the land in 2003;
    the rocket scientists and bedroom punks have gone their way-- Squarepusher,
    Aphex, \xB5-Ziq and 808 State now seem either hopelessly in their own worlds,
    or consciously at odds with what hipster electro-heads are pumping.
    Second-generation comers ranging from Boards of Canada to Lali Puna to
    Hrvatski exhibit varying degrees of familiarity with dance music that
    actually promotes happy movement, but if anything have evolved along a
    path born directly of their immediate predecessors rather than connecting
    the dots to some grand, electronic funk party.</p><p>
    UK techno duo LFO began life as many of their contemporaries, labeled the
    future of dance; the fallacy being that back then, most electronic music
    with a beat was ""dance"" music, for lack of a better non-industrial umbrella.
    The funny thing was, LFO was the real thing.  Gez Varley and Mark Bell's
    1991 debut <i>Frequencies</i> is one of the truly seminal documents for
    IDM, not just because it united electro, house, hip-hop breakbeats, and Detroit
    and UK techno in a vaguely experimental bent, but because it was one of the
    few records everyone had access to.  Pre-Internet, and before the dawn of
    filesharing, this was as important a factor as any for young ""intelligent""
    dance music.</p><p>
    So, here we are many years later, and wouldn't you know, those very qualities
    practically brand LFO as an oldies act.  Of course, this is all relatively
    speaking (the only kind of speak that makes much sense anymore), but Bell's
    tunes on <i>Sheath</i>-- his first record as LFO in seven years, and first
    without Varley-- are close to quaint.  This is not to say he sounds behind
    the times necessarily, but possibly that he's no longer proceeding at the same
    velocity as many of the people he must have inspired.  <i>Sheath</i> is a friendly,
    playful record-- one that will likely return as much joy as you're willing
    to afford it in listening time-- but it's decidedly lonely, in the same way
    your parents are lonely after you've left home forever.  Life and LFO go on,
    and doubtlessly still have adventures left to uncover, though the days of
    having to prove themselves are probably gone.</p><p>
    Bell's most promising work sounds as if related to his tenure working with
    Björk.  ""Blown"", ""Monkeylips"", ""Moistly"", ""Sleepy Chicken"" and ""Premacy"" not
    only sound as if they might have been backing tracks for <i>Vespertine</i> at
    some point, most of them sound better!  ""Sleepy Chicken"" is especially wonderful,
    a model of slinky grace, despite its goofy title.  Bell sprinkles an arrangement
    of repeating jazz bassline and blurry piano with mildly distorted static-pulse,
    giving the song an unearthly, pixie-dust ambience, then injects a strange,
    elastically prone pogo-synth loop about halfway in.  If ever trip-hop had a
    future, it is this song.</p><p>
    The first single from the album is ""Freak"", a very straightforward take on
    the bouncy electro LFO helped define at the outset of the 90s.  Unless
    you're not listening to any other new electro, it probably won't sound
    terribly distinctive, though there's hardly anything inherently unpleasant
    about it.  However, when the chorus promises that ""this is going to make you
    freak,"" perhaps something hotter than <i>Inside Edition</i>-assimilated bass
    hits should be going off.  Fending a little better is ""Snot"" (another less than
    becoming title); yes, it's probably only going to sound fresh to the Fatboy
    Slim crowd, though it's hard to hate something so vibrantly spaz-joyous.
    The uptempo, big-beat motorik serves Bell's fiendishly simple, but very
    effective bassline well.</p><p>
    Since LFO hardly need to be innovators to produce a good record, I don't
    have much problem recommending <i>Sheath</i>, with the caveat that when
    pleasant, easy-going atmospheres set in, sometimes amiable disinterest on
    listeners' parts follow shortly.  Perhaps it's merely the fact that Bell's
    strength seems to reside in his softer sides that fools me into thinking
    his more extroverted outings are lacking.  In any case, even after the
    wait, he's probably as close to a sure, comfortable thing as you'll find.</p></div>"|4955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4955-sheath/|7.3|Dominique Leone

Having spent a large portion of my life residing in punk
    houses, I've taken part in plenty of these sweaty, multi-person freakouts.
    We tried our damnedest not to call them drum circles, but the logistics
    couldn't lie: five crusts with more than five sticks bang like crazy on one
    rickety kit. While barely any of these events were successful musically, the
    overall catharsis was always the more attainable (and certainly more noble)
    goal.</p><p>
    
    Hammering out a wall of skittering percussion, Nervous Cop's assault by
    tom-tom conjures these late-night exercises in caffeinated stamina.  On the
    debut release from the side project of Hella's Zach Hill and Deerhoof's Greg
    Saunier, Nervous Cop beat out a William Hooker impersonation for a little over
    a half hour then call it a day.  The clashing/smashing smackdown pauses once
    or twice to allow a plucked or ringing harp jam from Joanna Newsom of The
    Please (who after two beautifully countrified self-released solo discs, has
    something coming out on Drag City sometime in 2004) and run-of-the-mill digital
    twiddling from electro-acoustic composer John Dieterich, also of Deerhoof.</p><p>
    
    To place Nervous Cop somewhere within the context of the main players' history,
    the stuff is more interesting than Hella, less compelling than Deerhoof.  I
    never cared much for Don Caballero or math rock in general, so Hella's
    post-Breadwinner intricacy doesn't move me. Deerhoof, though, have impressively
    notched a genre of their own.  With this album, Hill and Saunier certainly
    rock an admirable barrage, eschewing lazy-boy fills for flat-out pounding,
    but it never gels enough to stand-up as anything other than a pleasant,
    albeit thin, excursion by two guys who don't usually play much music like
    this. All in all, the compositions, if not strong, are gleefully sporadic.</p><p>
    
    Per the law of dynamics, the avalanche begins sedately with ""Setting the
    Bushes on Fire"", a 33-second clip of classical harp and incidental tones.
    Then comes 36 seconds of manic, rattling hardware percussion arbitrarily
    titled ""Rice Precipitation"". A similar sound gathers swells of electronics
    on ""Nonrum Nonproblem"" and ""Get Wolf Boy and Get in Context"". While continuing
    the patterns of the album as a whole, the newly beaten drums work a pulsation
    into the overall palate. The spare electronics-- little gurgles, a random
    computerized raindrop-- don't shift much either.  Throughout, you get that
    sense that this was one long solo chopped into parts, layered later.</p><p>
    
    The first long piece, ""III Pearls"", borrows the electronics of the prior
    bits, and the drums continue in same patterning, but an introduction of a
    distorted sound-wave musses things up a bit. Eventually the drums grow
    frantic and satisfyingly overlap. Another epic, ""Frank vs. Frank"", includes
    an airy harp solo: the mix shifts, the drums are distanced, a pretty
    disjunction arises, sounds operate singularly in a weird collective path. In
    time, of course, the insistent drums overtake the harp, an assault of cymbal
    crashes and rides. This ravenous rock 'n' roll give-and-take continues
    through the finale.</p><p>
    
    Though I imagine a real-life anxious policeman sounding a bit more shrill,
    Nervous Cop do a good job locating a rhythm and sticking to it.  Still,
    while the set offers a partially satisfying dose of chaos, in the realm of
    drum-based maniacs I'd rather take an unguided tour through grindcore, Harry
    Pussy, William Hooker and Art Blakey.  Or the nearest Sam Ash, actually.</p></div>"|5884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5884-nervous-cop/|6.6|Brandon Stosuy

    operandi: ""Find a craze that fits and stay there for a while."" Unfortunately for the faceless masses never
    exposed to Teenage Fanclub's tantalizingly classic power-pop, the band never found a craze, particularly
    not one that fit anywhere. Like all verifiable Glasgow bands, Teenage Fanclub write seductive shrines to
    love and disenchantment, love and wanderlust, sometimes just love and more love. Needless to say, at some
    point soon after 1991's heralded masterpiece <i>Bandwagonesque</i>, the 90s had to make their choice: rock
    songs about Scottish sunsets or rock songs about antichrists and bad sarcasm. In retrospect, we made the
    wrong decision.</p><p>
    
    In the modern age, the only time you'll hear of Teenage Fanclub is in a sentence explaining how back in
    the early 90s, this music was somehow eroded by <i>Nevermind</i>. That's just lazy musical genealogy. The
    roots of this band stretch deep into the soil of Britpop and indie rock as we now know it.  Witness ""The
    Concept"", the first song on both <i>Bandwagonesque</i> and this new best-of. The wry, affably pretentious,
    pseudo-anti-satirironic first line alone (""She wears denim wherever she goes/ Says she's going to get some
    records by the Status Quo"") was as influential for 90s indie rock as any of the great songs of its time.
    There's just enough feedback here to keep you from getting slammed against a locker when playing it too
    loud outside gym class; the twinkling ""oh yeah"" chorus draws equally upon The Beatles and bands mocking
    The Beatles; and the drawling two-minute guitar solo enjoins the world to call it the Scottish ""November
    Rain"".</p><p>
    
    On <i>Bandwagonesque</i>, the band's three strong songwriters (Norman Blake, Gerard Love, and Raymond
    McGinley) formed like a genteel, slightly nebbish Voltron and rocked more Big Star allusions than a Texas
    patriot. ""What You Do to Me"" would be indistinguishable from some of the songs on <i>Radio City</i> except
    Fanclub churns them out more melodically and cheerfully, and at a volume that would decapitate Alex Chilton.
    By 1993's <i>Thirteen</i>, the band would attempt nth-wave grunge and find that they were simply too
    brilliant to pull it off: ""Hang On"" opens like some rip-off of a Stone Temple Pilots hit before an
    uncomfortably inevitable slide into flakes of white noise and scaling strings.  1995's <i>Grand Prix</i>
    was slightly better, but even while the acoustic ballad ""Mellow Doubt"" featured lyrics as dumb and endearing
    as the best Big Star track, much of the record felt like weaker material from <i>Bandwagonesque</i>, with
    impotent songwriting and dismal performances.</p><p>
    
    Their last two albums, <i>Songs from Northern Britain</i> and <i>Howdy!</i>, have been fairly hit-or-miss,
    and <i>Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds</i> does an admirable job of compiling the best
    of these: ""I Don't Want Control of You"" is a brass rendition of a theme to an imaginary 60s sitcom. ""Planets""
    is a bizarrely dispiriting and hopeful space anthem with silly lyrics and orchestral crescendos. And, though
    this is a band clearly indebted to several major influences, there's always a song like ""My Uptight Life"",
    which idiosyncratically pairs what sounds like a phosphorescent theremin with backup harmonies that cynically
    say, ""Cynicism's a box I don't want to be in."" There are three new songs as well, all comparable in quality
    to the ""hits."" The band is softer here, more interested in song structure than feedback or atmosphere. The
    standout is ""The World'll Be OK"", a dance number that brings oscillating chords to drums, handclaps, and a
    dejected performance that belies the song's optimism.</p><p>
    
    There are, of course, complaints that the compilers neglected ""Alcoholiday"" or ""Ret Liv Dead"", but with 21
    tracks in 80 minutes, this is probably the first and last Teenage Fanclub record you're likely to need.

    of ba-ba-buh's and sing about how Stacey's mom ""has got it goin' on,"" or some other such timeless verse,
    they're valued as somehow above the fray.  It seems even the most venomous rock elitists can be defanged by
    a few simple hooks, turned endlessly forgiving by some easy harmonies.  If Stalin himself had ruled with
    less of an iron fist and more Beach Boys-style harmonies, he might be remembered as much for his keen
    songwriting chops as for the wholesale slaughter of millions of his own people; such is the inexplicably
    titanic redemptive power of pop.  That self-same blinding power is also why it takes a band as innovative
    as The Unicorns to throw the complacencies of pop into stark relief, to finally hold it accountable for
    such casual abuses.</p><p>
    
    When it's so easy for bands to stay behind the indie-pop curve that you'd think someone's handing out ice
    cream back there, The Unicorns are ahead.  In fact, they're so <i>far</i> ahead that superficial distinction
    becomes virtually unnecessary; they're striking at the most fundamental structure of the pop song itself.
    Without scrutiny, <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?</i>, their debut album for the otherwise
    experimental Canadian label Alien8, can pass for the same sort of sugar-glazed jangle-pop that's been done
    to death, but has nevertheless been beloved for years in indie circles; all the elements I just derided are
    present in abundance, right down to a rare few instances of smarmy lyrics.  The band traffics in the
    occasional oooh's and aaah's, and relies on retro-basic keyboards for the requisite flourish above and
    beyond the standard guitar fuzz.  And yet, The Unicorns toe the line of bedroom intimacy and heart-swelling
    wonder as perfectly as any of the modern masters of the form.</p><p>
    
    In that sense, they rival The Shins, or The Magnetic Fields, or any of the innumerable indie touchstones,
    but what truly sets <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair</i> apart is the near-total absence of traditional verse/chorus/verse
    framework in their songs; to nail beautiful, memorable lines with such remarkable ease is a feat unto itself,
    but to do so in essentially formless compositions is a different class of achievement entirely.  Songs shift
    effortlessly from segment to segment, never relying upon the crutch of repetitive composition to create the
    illusion of a powerful hook.  That's not to say that motifs aren't revisited throughout a song, but elementary
    concepts of A-B-A structure are abandoned in favor of brilliant, sprawling whole-song compositions.</p><p>
    
    These days, when ""epic"" describes a line at the bank, it doesn't seem adequate to describe the scope of
    some of these tunes, but it'll have to suffice.  ""Jellybones"" is a titanic wreck of styles and forms,
    offering glimpses of hooks that would serve other bands as whole songs like so many kittens; ""Tuff Ghost""
    builds around two simple rhythmic shifts and never looks back, burning through a dozen variations of the
    song's central keyboard line.  And the intricate plucking to open ""I Was Born (A Unicorn)"" gives way to a
    bizarre fiction: ""I was born a unicorn/ I missed the ark, but I could've sworn/ You'd wait for me,"" then,
    ""So how come all the other unicorns are dead?""  This hilariously morbid variation on a typical theme of
    loss or abandonment is par for the course on <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair</i>, exemplifying how The Unicorns
    continually and effortlessly sap the drama from rock's favorite, most maudlin topics, and transform them
    into simple, charming, light-hearted <i>fun</i>.  It's a big part of what separates them from all those
    careerist indie rockers getting by on everyday hooks and affected disinterest; even at their goofiest, The
    Unicorns' level of comfort with their material-- and the obvious confidence that engenders-- makes it all
    seem totally natural and new.</p></div>"|8380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8380-who-will-cut-our-hair-when-were-gone/|8.9|Eric Carr

More recently, people
    made the shift to the clean air, open space, and lack of humidity of Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern
    California for improved health.  But whatever the reasons that The Handsome Family, the avant-country
    husband/wife duo of Rennie and Brett Sparks, had for picking up stakes in Chicago and relocating to
    Albuquerque, it hasn't seemed to affect the dark humor or morbidity of their gothic Americana music.
    Like most of their work, <i>Signing Bones</i>, the band's sixth album, is another collection of tales
    of madness, thoughts of suicide, and acts of brutality and murder.</p><p>
    
    Which isn't to say that <i>Singing Bones</i> doesn't sound as if it was informed by their change in
    geography. Like their best album to date, 1998's <i>Through the Trees</i>-- which was peppered by lyrical
    references to Chicago's stool bums, long, wide avenues, and Wisconsin weekend ""getaways""-- <i>Signing
    Bones</i> seems to echo the wide-open space and endless skies of the Southwest.</p><p>
    
    In a way, then, this is the band's most beautiful record, an expertly arranged blend of their acoustic old
    school country augmented by pedal steel guitar and bowed saws and sometimes colored by elements of mariachi,
    gospel, and rural folk. Rather than the airy, light sounds of their recent <i>In the Air</i> and <i>Twilight</i>,
    the new record has a spacious, almost minimalist sound that seems to echo with the sound of the nominal
    ghosts.  Departed friends and lovers, the weight of history, and personal demons all seem channeled by the
    Sparks.  From the apparitions that haunt the aisles of the ""24-Hour Store"" to the stench of death in ""Far
    From the Road"" to the sense of resignation that accompanies loss in both ""The Bottomless Hole"" and ""Gail
    with the Golden Hair"", ruin and decay-- spiritual, mental, and physical-- are central themes of the record.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's the clean air, but the Sparks are in better voice than ever before, too. Brett's rich baritone--
    which also shined while voicing feelings of claustrophobia, personal insignificance, and mental breakdown
    on <i>Through The Trees</i> and <i>Milk and Scissors</i>-- is better suited for these lush, spacious arrangements
    than it was for the band's most recent work or its roots-rock beginnings. Their harmonies, too, have improved
    dramatically, with Rennie now favoring a wavering falsetto rather than her typical affected, sometimes
    abrasive, and potentially off-putting growl.</p><p>
    
    Morbid but still melodic, the sharp imagery and deft storytelling of Rennie's lyrics set her apart from
    most of the depressive, post-Plath acoustic pluckers and bores with which the band often is lumped in.
    And both her sense of fractured romanticism and tangible grasp of loss and consequence make her writing
    effortlessly better than the emotive types parading in the punk dives for whom pain and discomfort seems
    bandied about as fashion or a calling card. It's not, of course-- it's private and difficult to grasp,
    an unseen specter like the ghosts that haunt this record.</p></div>"|3729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3729-singing-bones/|7.4|Scott Plagenhoef

    name Lovely Midget.  Her music career began with two self-released CDs which soon caught the ear of Sonic
    Youth's Thurston Moore, who promptly reissued her <i>Sings the Lost Chord</i> EP as a 10-inch on his Ecstatic
    Peace! label.  Her first proper album followed in 2002 on Corpus Hermeticum.  Prior to her largely solo
    project, she played in the Xpressway-sanctioned Angelhead (with Michael Morley of the legendary Wreck Small
    Speakers on Expensive Stereos, Dead C, Gate, et al.) and the all-girl rock quartet Queen Meanie Puss, who
    released singles on Flying Nun and Siltbreeze.  Later, she worked on sound design for feature films and
    the cartoonish bluster of syndicated television, adding to her production arsenal.</p><p>
    
    And now there's <i>North Head</i>, a dense sonic landscape brimming with interwoven, minute abstractions.
    A distillation of two years worth of recording, the gothic-tinged <i>North Head</i> resembles the incidental
    crumble of fellow New Zealander Peter Jefferies, especially the kitchen-sink aura of his <i>Last Great
    Challenge in a Dull World</i> or Michael Morley's noisy, protracted solo work with Gate.  The influence of
    some non-New Zealanders is detectable as well: electronic music pioneer and composer Pauline Oliveros'
    notions of deep listening are also apparent in Shearer's sustained interweaving of keyboards, guitar, flute,
    vocals, and digital processing.  Moments of <i>North Head</i> invoke a tenser, more saturated take on
    <i>Primordial Lift</i>, a field of long notes bolstered by Oliveros' accordion, electronics, and vocals;
    fattened with the electronic violin of Tony Conrad, the harmonium of David Grubbs, and a sea of cellos and
    low frequency oscillations.</p><p>
    
    In this vein, the album's opening title track floats by in a deep freeze. Not as successful as some of the
    other pieces, it hinges awkwardly on the jarring sound of distant female voices. Not singing so much as
    vocalizing, these women were recorded in caves and their echoing shouts remain below the level of the
    music. A beautiful track in some respects, the too-pronounced humanity removes the aura of the more
    mysterious, organically anonymous works. Likewise, ""Dolphin"" ends the album abruptly, with the sound of
    voices sped and slowed, intermixed with string reverb, picking, scraping. Bolstering and assisting the
    title track, though, is any accompanying visual loop of falling snow and falling pedals. Shearer filmed
    these frenetic landscapes then re-sampled and looped them, exploiting generation loss and magnifying the
    grain of both the water, trees, and the medium itself.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album this swarm of multi-layered sonic information remains fairly continuous.  The best
    tracks are positioned within a foreshortened field: layers appear homogenous but drip nuance. ""Swollen
    Dusk"" and ""Heavy Weather"" gloriously sound every bit their namesake. ""Squall"" is an undulating muffle,
    a submerged microphone enacting a nautical drift. Its fog and distant ghosts bring to mind Nurse with
    Wound's <i>Salt Marie Celeste</i>, but remain more interior, a frozen chunk of claustrophobia, the
    inside of an anchor. ""Fading"" locates a similar tension, but explores outwardly with guitars that fly
    off like violins whittling the air. These tones are supported by the vaguest impression of intermittent
    percussion. Here, I thought of a microphone charting the decomposition of dry ice or, quite differently,
    bugs caught alive in amber attempting a strenuous escape.</p><p>
    
    On <i>North Head</i>, the occasional fragment dislodges itself from the pack and begs for your attention,
    but then it's gone. Unfortunately, the seven tracks are relatively brief. Ranging from three to seven and
    a half minutes, these environments warrant a lengthier stay; then the teeming landscapes could then last
    as long as they demand, clattering rivers pushing towards a distant location, endless.</p></div>"|4954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4954-north-head/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

That's why they've stuck together for more than
    ten years, I'm sure; because the crowd doesn't exactly part down the middle for this type of stuff anymore.
    At least, together and still ""truckin',"" this Boise trio can travel the country plugging in and rocking out,
    sharing joints, beers, and stories about playing with Built to Spill.  On their own they'd be, well: they'd
    be J Mascis.</p><p>
    
    So dig this crazy tripped out mindfuck: Caustic Resin find a way to strip the splinters away from Pink Floyd,
    Neil Young, and Dinosaur Jr and drive them into your ears with unabashed relentlessness and seeming disregard
    for cohesion, melody, or any discernible eye for restraint.   Sometimes, as in the opening moments of ""Wizard
    of the Upper Snake River"", you get a little taste of the mid 90s in its anthemic tone and undulating dynamics
    (at best a loose echo of Modest Mouse at their most digressive and angst-led moments), but this is as current
    as it gets-- not to mention as palatable.</p><p>
    
    The opening two tracks immediately go about harshing my mellow with abrasive guitar romps, open-ended song
    structures, and spacy freak-out psychedelia.  Netson's vocals are of the Axl/Wayne Coyne hybrid variety,
    only sans any semblance of charm or melody.  ""Fry Like Ace Jones"" chills out the mix a bit, but the band's
    patience quickly wanes, and over the next three tracks, we're subjected to nearly thirty minutes of impenetrable
    crunch and burn reverb, guitar solos, and feedback.  The whole mess, laced with pleas to ""Keep freakin'/
    Keep on freakin' out,"" amounts to a suffocating Wall of displaced apathetic aggression and slacker languishment.</p><p>
    
    Some of the darker moments sound a bit like Tool on GHB-- dense, stomping, and maniacal, but with sloppy
    undertones of ambivalence constantly pulling the bottom out from underneath them.  The entire affair, for
    as heavy handed and metallic it is, washes clean and leaves no mark.  You'd think the enlistment of Phil
    Ek and a return to Go would stifle their recidivist crimes, but Caustic Resin are too unaffected and
    backward-looking to care.  This is unapologetic, hazy-eyed, shirtless bar-rock at its most vulnerable, so
    don't come looking for a fight-- you'll just leave with stinging eyes, ringing ears and no memory of what
    brought you there in the first place.  Which, given what went down inside, is a good thing.</p></div>"|1360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1360-keep-on-truckin/|3.9|William Morris

    disoriented, punchdrunk, and a little thirsty.  Featuring five new tracks and three alternate takes of
    previously released songs, Single Frame's <i>Burn Radio Airtest</i> EP is the clipped and burnt follow-up
    to their prodigious full-length, <i>Wetheads Come Running</i>.  That album offered as much in the way of
    promise as it did in tangible payoff, but exactly what direction their future work would take remained to
    be seen.  With this EP, that future sound is beginning to take shape, and it seems to be leaning much more
    conspicuously towards East Coast dance-punk flavors, electro freakouts, and darkwave discord.</p><p>
    
    The title track most closely follows the blueprint rolled out on <i>Wetheads</i>; warbled synth lines,
    choppy drum work, and Isaac Brock-like squawking, all bookended by found sound and reverb. It's one of
    several great tracks here, even if the tastes are a bit fleeting to feel substantive-- it's the same pleasure
    derived from all of their work to date, a sort of blustery slap and sinking afterglow of indulgence.
    ""Clipper Ship"", too, is easily recognizable as Single Frame material, only grimier and more linear.
    ""Dry Lips Usually Crack"" and ""Without Pens"", meanwhile, are pure unbridled energy carted in with electric
    distortion and an apocalyptic sense of immediacy, the latter song employing 30 seconds of digitized vocals
    before giving way to a few furiously intermittent rockouts.</p><p>
    
    As for the remixes, none stand up to their originals in terms of temperament, but some trip into a newfound
    atmospheric success. ""Eavesdropper (Insomniatronic Mix)"" could easily be dubbed ""the <i>Kid A</i> version.""
    It pushes the evocative vocals to the back of the mix, distorting them almost unintelligibly, slows down
    the keys, and deploys a drum machine breakdown in the middle.  It's more harrowing but decidedly less
    hedonic.  The other two are mixes of ""New Car"" and ""Been to a Party at this House"", the latter altered
    very frivolously-- perhaps simply more electro-tinged and distorted-- and the former reduced to a
    drone-session utilizing the borrowed guitar lick from the original.  The record concludes with ""100,000
    Troops"", a two-minute smattering of feedback, vocal samples, and persistent drums, all the while evoking
    the ghost of societal displeasure.</p><p>
    
    As is, the first half of the record takes an aggressive route, pushing the envelope the band sealed earlier
    this year, while its second half mostly wanders and kicks ponderously at stones in the road.   To say where
    they're headed next is anyone's guess, but it seems to me this might have been more of an off-the-cuff
    sprouting than a sprinkling of planted seeds.  Either way, I'm eager to see what happens next.</p></div>"|7181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7181-burn-radio-airtest-ep/|7.4|William Morris

    instrumental hip-hop albums, stripping away the vocals and selling rappers' souls to throngs of incompetent
    DJs. That's why the new Daedelus album is a little perplexing: It's a ""rethinking"" of this year's The Weather,
    an album that found Busdriver and Radioinactive unleashing arrhythmic non-sequiturs and product placement
    over Daedelus' harp-filling, beat-killing wingtip hip-hop. The first sound on the new album is a sample:
    ""We broke up because there were intergroup pressures and it was an experiment"" (okay, it was on the original
    album, too, but still-- the first thing you hear?!). We should probably take this with a grain of salt, as
    Daedelus is more a sardonic Santa Monica loafer than a 50 Cent, but we can probably safely assume someone's
    a little bitter.</p><p>
    
    To ignore this possibly fictional animosity for a moment, The Weather's beats were actually pretty inspired,
    especially given that Daedelus was an IDM artist sampling ultra-vintage 78s for the Plug Research label long
    before he ever attempted a project like this one.  In retrospect, though, The Weather seems a cage, wherein a
    dejected Daedelus was enslaved in order to prevent overshadowing the vocalists.  ""Rethinking"" is when a
    loophole in the hip-hop bureaucracy accidentally let loose a lunatic whose only munitions are his attention
    deficit disorder and a vast reservoir of every type of pop music since 1920.</p><p>
    
    I have neither the patience nor intelligence to compare every new version of The Weather with the <i>Rethinking</i>
    version. Suffice to say, the ""rethinks"" are basically little more than extravagant versions of the old ones
    (which means on the remix album, there's great music and starving tedium in roughly equal proportions). The
    music consists of little kids' playground games, 60s saccharine pop, and those harp-and-strings passages that
    always mean Jimmy Stewart's about to have yet another bad dream. ""Chorus, Verse, Chorus"" is a full Japanese
    torch song protected by the sort of blaxploitation sword-funk that RZA would be proud of. ""Dark Days"" is a
    60s girl band interspersed with the kind of silly jams those kids from <i>Peanuts</i> would always stumble
    around to. These kinds of songs are simultaneously bizarre, obscene, and pretty damn stupid, together forming
    my definition of ""mildly amusing.""  But sometimes the formula lunges into ""masterpiece"" status: the classic
    ""Greatly Exaggerated, Our Demise"" layers reggae, James Brown-style yelps, children's jump-rope rhymes, and
    50s easy listening, ending up somewhere between a Jamaican prison's carousel and the appliance section at
    Sears.</p><p>
    
    While even this kind of music is a little grittier than Daedelus' 2002 solo release <i>Invention</i>, if not
    as complex, elsewhere Daedelus vigorously fights the power like a homeless Def Jux producer. Hip-hop doesn't
    get much more abrasive than ""Missing"", which is about as dirty as shuffling across a freeway wearing nothing
    but soup cans. Unfortunately, on more traditional hip-hop tracks, like ""Robotic Girls Are Hard"", everything
    is tempered by his patented toy pianos and orchestration-- and by the time it rolls around, it no long seems
    either innovative or particularly affecting.</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, the musical jokes don't exactly pay off: ""Name Game""'s potion of mentally challenged children
    samples and dense, claustrophobic rhythm ain't exactly gonna frighten DJ Shadow's ""The Number Song"". This
    is an exception, though. Usually the jokes are actually more entertaining than the music they produce.
    ""Bright Stars"" commences with a paralyzing rocket launch and all manner of crazy sci-fi samples until the
    whole track gets whisked away into whistling, charming exotica, far more appropriate for your grandfather's
    shuffleboard club than a psychedelic journey into the cosmos. Conversely, in ""Hardly Hip-Hop"", a middle-class
    family encounters an unexpected dinner guest who just happens to be a gale of shattering static in a French
    police state. Monty Python didn't even take the joke that far.</p><p>
    
    There isn't really much of a comparison between this and The Weather; one is intended as a sort of supplement
    to the rappers (maybe a complement in the perfect rapocracy), while the other has nothing to rely on but itself.
    At the same time, there's enough overlap that you should probably pick one or the other.  Basically it comes
    down to which you like more: lyrics or rule-breaking polyphony.</p></div>"|2130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2130-rethinking-the-weather/|6.9|Alex Linhardt

His epic
    discography seems to dutifully cover virtually every genre (excluding hip-hop, thankfully): From the
    ska-inflected wit of his debut, <i>My Aim Is True</i>, to the Byrdsian rock bombast of <i>Armed Forces</i>,
    to <i>King of America</i>'s stripped down Americana, Costello has painted himself as something of a
    reclusive, embittered Bowie-- a songwriting chameleon given more to political discourse than grandiose,
    caricatured personas.  Unfortunately, with each passing year, his wide-ranging ambitions seem to become
    more of a nuisance than an inspirational creative light.</p><p>
    
    Costello has always seemed to have a difficult time reconciling the critic in him with the artist, and it
    speaks volumes that one of his most inspired moments of late took place not in the studio, but at a desk:
    His <i>Vanity Fair</i> article <i>Rocking Around the Clock</i> was an immensely enjoyable, meticulously
    documented, hour-by-hour blueprint for an ideal full day of binge music listening.  In a rare moment,
    Costello flashed his true inner manically-obsessive-music-dork nature.  Of course, he's taken the time to
    entertain many of his inner music critic's fantasies over the years, as well, and while some of these
    indulgences have struck musical paydirt, his diverse ambitions have often come at the cost of his music's
    consistency, and have largely muddied the proverbial waters of his aesthetic voice over the years.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, <i>North</i>, Elvis Costello's 24th (yes, 24th) album is among his least inspiring to date.
    Conceptually, the album should have been a knockout.  Costello's music has always fared best when its
    arrangements were stripped to their bare essentials, creating an intimate space for his wry voice, witty
    narratives and poignant melodies.  And while Costello saw success with his landmark ""intimate"" guitar
    album, 1985's <i>King of America</i>, he'd never before made a sister album for it, of piano-based material.
    Costello's piano songs, like the pensive, yearning ""Almost Blue"" (from 1982's abstract pop masterpiece
    <i>Imperial Bedroom</i>) and the gently heroic ""Shipbuilding"" (off 1983's <i>Punch the Clock</i>) have
    accounted for some of the most moving and inspired moments of his career.</p><p>
    
    The only catch with <i>North</i> is that Costello seems less concerned with presenting a collection of
    melodically clever and empathetic songs filled with his trademark sense of irony and double-entendre
    than with recording an album for the classical and jazz elites.  In other words, it looks like the result
    of self-conscious pandering to his inner music critic.  Note that Costello inexplicably released the album
    on the acclaimed classical label, Deutsche Grammophon (the beaming yellow of the label's logo jumps out
    ridiculously against the sharp gray contrasts of the album art), and while he might gain ""street cred""
    amongst the classical music in-crowd with this move, the result makes for his least compelling work yet.</p><p>
<i>North</i> may be better understood as a stylistic experience than as a musical one: Costello has eschewed
    all sense of melody and humor in favor of rambling, mock-jazz noodling.  Where Costello matched the sparse
    arrangements of his jazz-influenced classic ""Almost Blue"" with the nuanced simplicity of standards like
    ""Body and Soul"", <i>North</i> defies this simple beauty as one long drab exercise.  Fortunately, the album
    does find some saving grace in the iconic marvel of Costello's voice.  His delivery here sounds like a
    rich, thick slab of wet red paint, adding rich texture and depth to the dim gray backdrop of his
    accompaniment.  Also, touches of classic Costello rear their head every now and again; especially on the
    yearning nostalgia of ""Fallen"" (""I believed that life was wonderful, right up to the moment when love went
    wrong"") and ""I'm in the Mood Again"", the elegant, wondrous love song set amidst New York City which closes
    the album.</p><p>
    
    Still, from the melodramatic opener ""You Left Me in the Dark"" (sample lyric: ""You left me standing alone/
    Although I thought that we could not be parted""), notes tumble on ad infinitum, leading nowhere and standing
    in direct contrast to their meticulously crafted maudlin surroundings.  The sentimental ""When Did I Stop
    Dreaming"" offers a possible excuse for the album's unrelentingly dim mood: If Costello has indeed become
    paralyzed with cynicism as signified by the lyric, ""Pardon me, if I seem distant and strange/ Just tell me
    when did I stop dreaming?"", it makes sense that this batch of songs reeks of such icy indifference.</p><p>
    
    It could be said that part of what makes Elvis Costello such a shape-shifting artist is his unrelenting
    determination to capture the everlasting beauty he sees within the material of his favorite songwriters.
    It's a cruel irony that, as he grows older and aims higher, he only falls further away from himself and
    fails more profoundly at grasping that elusive quality.</p></div>"|1623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1623-north/|3.9|Hartley Goldstein

    there's something so wonderfully quaint about the whole notion.  What was it like to search so hard to
    find music during this time, when economy of scale meant investing in a dual-well deck and dubbing a
    run of tapes in your spare time?  It really wasn't so long ago that such tapes were a path to a genuine
    underground, but it feels like another lifetime.  I was there, I guess, but somehow it seems like something
    my parents told me about.</p><p>
    
    In this marginal world of indie cassette releases, a world that has never registered even the slightest
    blip on the radar of the average pop culture consumer, Lou Barlow was king.  Barlow first released cheaply
    recorded and mastered four-track material as Sebadoh, chose the name Sentridoh for his solo material once
    Sebadoh became a proper band, and also dabbled under his given name.  All told, Barlow released <em>a lot</em>
    of material on cassettes and singles in the late 80s and early 90s, during the time before he obtained any
    kind of profile with The Folk Implosion or Sebadoh after it became a proper indie rock band.</p><p>
    
    I'm only now starting to get a handle on how prolific Barlow was. I consider myself a fan, but after listening
    to <i>Lou B's Wasted Pieces '87-'93</i>, a collection of stray tracks and the previously released <i>Wasted
    Pieces</i> cassette, I realize I don't know the half of it. I was amazed to find zero overlap with either
    <i>The Original Losing Losers</i> or <i>Lou Barlow and His Sentridoh</i>, two long albums that have something
    like 55 songs between them.  All this Sentridoh material is in addition to the four-track stuff Lou released
    as the pre-rock Sebadoh-- and to think that there are at least two other full-length Sentridoh CDs out there
    somewhere.</p><p>
    
    How did Barlow do it? Well, the trick was, most of what he released wasn't very good. A significant portion
    of the songs that found release during this time were either unformed, one-take songs, or dippy tape
    experiments. The usual method for putting together records, this idea of combing through a stack of
    recordings, working to find the quality tracks, and mulling how they might best be presented, was of
    no interest to Barlow whatsoever with Sentridoh. His four-track aesthetic during this time was the musical
    equivalent of automatic writing: just fling every last scrap out into zineland and let the listener do the
    work of making sense of it.</p><p>
    
    It might sound careless and indulgent, but it was an aesthetic that happened to yield some oddly arresting
    artifacts.  There's a ""1 + 1 = 3"" kind of thing happening with Lou Barlow's home recorded music, and I've
    always enjoyed this stuff more than I should. Part of it is the powerful melancholy mood that floats through
    the recordings. No matter what sort of songs Barlow is doing-- joke tracks, misguided attempts at avant-garde
    sound manipulation, heartfelt confessional ballads-- they wind up sounding like the work of a lonely,
    depressive guy who smokes entirely too much weed.  Barlow was obsessed with bodily fluids and disgusted
    with himself, and the records tended to have the dank, poorly lit atmosphere of a lived-in room in need of
    care. If you've ever spent a sad evening alone and thought to yourself, ""Maybe I'll feel better if I take
    a hit and put on some music,"" you can understand the world of Lou Barlow.</p><p>
<i>Lou B's Wasted Pieces '87-'93</i> has the cotton-mouthed, blunted folk vibe that Barlow essentially
    perfected, but the ratio of memorable songs to failed experiments is even lower than usual. There are
    31 tracks here, but you would have to live with this CD for a hell of a long time before you could pick
    more than a couple out of a lineup. ""Nitemare"" is a great little song, the kind of simple acoustic pop
    that shows Barlow really did listen closely to Joni Mitchell's <em>Blue</em>. And I honestly think the
    shockingly effective ""Organ"", which later found release on the <i>Kids</i> soundtrack as ""Raise the Bells""
    (there is a different song here with the same title), is a brilliant piece of drone music as dreamy and
    potent as any Boards of Canada instrumental. There are a few other highlights, but mixed between are too
    many mangled tape collages, too many spoken word interludes, and too many songs that don't so much go
    nowhere as not ""go"" period. <i>Lou B's Wasted Pieces</i> is an interesting time capsule, perhaps, but it's
    well down the list of Barlow's four-track product.</p></div>"|7072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7072-lou-bs-wasted-pieces-87-93/|4.6|Mark Richardson

It rains too much and the coffee's too strong and the sirens are too loud,
    too often.  People aren't as pretty as they used to seem, and on top of that they're gradually electing the
    entire cast of the movie <i>Predator</i> to significant governorships.  Minnesota, California: I think I
    saw Carl Weathers in Central Park yesterday with a stack of leaflets.  When late November rolls around and
    someone asks what I'm thankful for, I might just give up and say Ellen Allien's <i>Berlinette</i>, which
    has made the past six or seven months a lot nicer.</p><p>
    That's the kind of love she inspires.  Another Pitchforker came back from Berlin a few months ago, having
    seen her DJ at a party for her label, Bpitch Control, and said faux-hawked German boys had been lined up
    around the deck to bring her drinks.  Thom Yorke's been going around talking about how great the label is,
    the cheat: yes, yet another cadre of ultra-fine German electronics.  And earlier this year she released
    <i>Berlinette</i>, which is ""serious,"" and ""pop,"" and beautiful, and which I've had more success
    recommending to people than anything in years.  It's a record that German techno enthusiasts and Björk fans
    can agree on; it tweaks and thumps and then pulls gorgeous ghostly pop out of it; it's big and solid and
    lovely.</p><p>
    How so?  The truth is that it's just enchanting, in a way that has to do with something much more than the
    sonic inventiveness and precision engineering that I'll have to settle for discussing here.  It's rare for
    artists to manage what Allien does-- to take the tweaky cutting edges of techno and IDM and electro and
    draw from them pop music evocative enough to entrance even people who are usually turned off by electronics
    and ""repetitive beats.""  It's even rarer for an artist to manage that with anything like <i>Berlinette</i>'s
    sense of mood and personality, which mostly transcends the mechanics of the sound.  But Allien manages all
    of this, in about eleven different ways.</p><p>
    Just try one track: ""Trashscapes"".  Her beats are like tiny hypercomplicated machines, with lots of pistons
    and articulated limbs; ""Trashscapes"" kicks in with a stiff, daunting one, one that pounds and then hangs in
    the air for a second before flipping over and starting again.  Then come bursts of gnarled guitar, processed
    into a grim, extra-terrestrial chug-- the same way Allien's vocals are always processed into what feel like
    departure announcements from a spaceport on Mercury.  At first we can't hear her: just micro-second clips
    and stutters popping over the mech-beat.  Then she's singing and it feels heavy but it hasn't quite gelled
    into sense: ""Wo is where/ What is when/ Why we are here.""  But when the guitars speed into an evil blur she
    comes out all steely-eyed with the record's mantra: ""The past is a lighttrain to unknown trashscapes.""</p><p>
    That's what she does, on the face of it: She blurs the line between ""real"" sounds and ""fake"" ones, weaving
    processed patches of voice and guitar directly into the laptopped complexity of her rhythms; on ""Abstract
    Pictures"" it's the clang of a sequencer that rings out clear and natural.  On ""Push"" she indulges in the
    half-crazy tweakery of some of her labelmates, toying with stompy synth blurts and calling, ""Push/ Push/
    Kick your ass.""  When she goes pop it's not by watering down the beats and crooning seductively or anything
    like that; it's just by gathering her steady tech throb up into gorgeous sweeps of melody. ""Sehnsucht"", one
    of the record's other standouts, has a compositional swell that's like the best days of Orbital, another act
    that always had the same ghostly, personal sheen Allien conjures: the beat here is her second-best machine
    (see ""Wish""), and the vocal is just another micro-processed blip, a half-syllable ""Ah.""  It stutters in and
    takes its shape, and by the time the song draws up, roaring, there's no lyric that could be more right than
    the electronically pitched melody of those half-syllables.</p><p>
    But all that's only technical.  If it were just that, <i>Berlinette</i> would be an outstanding record, but
    not so outstanding as this.  No, <i>Berlinette</i> has something extra-- the sort of mood and magic that
    makes you want to bring Allien as many drinks as she'll let you buy her. It's in the hyper-pretty, otherworldly
    electro-funk of ""Secret"", in the almost Cure-like cerebral throb of ""Open"", and even in the embarrassingly
    bald, maybe even naïve lyric of ""Wish"", which, like any good moment of vulnerability, makes you like Allien
    that much more.  ""Need a planet without cars and wars/ I wish it could be true,"" she sings-- an almost
    strange thing to hear on a record full of alien machines.</p><p>
    So that's the thrill: realizing all over again just how evocative and gorgeous the stiff clatter of technology
    can be.  You sit calmly listening, drifting off to somewhere else, and then you notice that the little people
    dancing inside your head could almost be jacking their limbs off to certain points, or that the sounds of
    power tools are peeking out between the sounds of androids singing arias.  Oh, maybe it's not that amazing:
    It's just a record, after all, and one of plenty of great ones released this year.  But I've spent half the
    year with it, and it only gets better, and I can't wait to hear how it sounds in a few months, when the
    Predator itself announces a dark-horse independent bid for the presidency.</p></div>"|411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/411-berlinette/|8.9|Nitsuh Abebe

Individual
    artists, realizing their greatest assets, split for side projects with other seemingly disparate artists,
    and while the results obviously vary, it's surprising how often they find success.  From The Weather (in
    which underground emcees Busdriver and Radioinactive paired up with sample-crazy IDM artist Daedelus), to
    Non-Prophets (introspective lyricist Sage Francis teamed with harder-edged producer Joe Beats), to this
    unlikely duo, which matches low-profile, self-producing lyricist Blueprint with official Ohio soul machine
    Rjd2, these bizarre side projects are quickly becoming some of the underground's best bets.</p><p>
    
    Those unfamiliar with Blueprint's previous work with acts like Illogic and Aesop Rock may be taken aback by
    his ability to exude unusual confidence, charisma and emotionally powerful delivery in conjunction with his
    nasal voice and sharp, educated pronunciation. Essentially escaping comparison, his diverse subject matter
    spans topics like disdain for occupational hierarchy (""Fuckajob"") and the trials and tribulations of hot-headed
    female companions (""The Jerry Springer Episode"").</p><p>
    
    One of his most gripping outings here appears in ""Run"".  With a beat, chorus and concept recalling <i>Book of
    Human Language</i>-era Aceyalone, Blueprint glides around Rjd2's ethereal bobbing string-guided beat with an
    urgency that lends well to the topic at hand.  Print examines the bleak state of mind inherent in the ghetto
    environment he grew up in, from gestation to age of majority: ""I learned how to walk at age 1/ And wasn't
    satisfied until I learned how to run/ At age 18, I didn't wanna run/ But I had to run from the shots fired
    by a gun.""  His focus later changes to the escapist philosophies of his fellow project purveyors, finding
    that they're better off when not ""running from responsibilities.""  Print's fresh take on the relatively
    common ghetto life theme is a powerful example of his wordplay capabilities.</p><p>
    
    Rjd2 typically plays the background when laying down beats for emcees, trusting traditionalism over his
    obvious strength in experimentation, but here he makes several advances to match Blueprint's radicalism.
    From the trickle-down skank and blaxploitation recoil of ""Fuckajob"" to the ""clumsy ghost"" piano hammer
    smash of ""Look of Pain"" and the stuttered orchestral horror film crescendo, subtle piano, and gorgeous
    panning electric guitar of ""Survival"", RJ manages to dominate independent beatmaking.  Even his simpler
    offerings (""Right Place, Wrong Time"", ""Printmatic"") are tastefully executed: they not only serve their
    purpose of enhancing lyrical focus, but also expose the more colorful tracks on the disc.</p><p>
    
    Some missed opportunities remain: the beat on the three ""Candyland"" interludes is strong enough to rescue
    the track from its alphabetic retro dalliance, while ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" seems largely pointless with
    the same verse being dropped twice (and lacking resonance, development or purpose both times).  Also, despite
    his preference for darker beats, Blueprint could easily have benefited from more upbeat production.  Still,
    with these minor complaints pending, it's obvious that this amalgam between one of the most promising
    rappers in the underground and the most in-demand producer in the industry is a winning combination.</p></div>"|7369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7369-8000000-stories/|7.5|Rollie Pemberton

    trip, but you could do a lot worse for yours than to let them in.  There are scores of bands out there only
    too willing to let the tidal wave of fashion, bullshit trends and other cons of daily life niche them into
    your world.  There are millions of CDs and MP3s out there to consume.  At any given moment, you have access
    to so much music willing to play along to a numbing, corporate tune, and when I notice a band of minstrels
    so obviously anachronistic as this Texas trio, our mighty, muddy society's river seems all the more
    intimidating.</p><p>
    
    Not that Tom and Christina Carter and Heather Leigh Murray are necessarily performing in protest.  In fact,
    since 1991 their exploratory (or possibly just open-minded) brand of free-folk has been closer to the domain
    of daydreams than political statements, so maybe I'm just living vicariously through their utter refusal to
    embrace most aspects of the music business or consumer culture in general.  Kranky's reissue of last year's
    <i>Unknown Spin</i>-- originally available as a split with Scorces (a Murray/Christina Carter duo project)
    via a limited pressing CD-R on their summer 2002 tour-- is like a lighthouse beacon for anyone sick of
    overkill in any respect.</p><p>
    
    Improvisation plays a major role in Charalambides' music.  Christina Carter's ghostly vocals drift through
    pieces like an autumn wind, without any particular place to go; Tom Carter and Murray's guitars draw from
    other notable non-scenesters like John Fahey and Richard Youngs, though Murray's steel keeps the music on
    <i>Unknown Spin</i> ever tied to classic blues and traditional American folk music.  Despite having a knack
    for constructing bizarre tape collage experiments (as on parts of 1999's <i>Houston</i>) and psych-raga
    drone (1995's <i>Market Square</i>), their music seems tied to the magic of the moment-- that is, they're
    able to make massive statements in minimal folk seem like the offhanded storytelling of an ancient, knowing
    local.  In both cases, simple pleasures rely on your willingness to sit back, listen and pay no mind to the
    distractions of the modern world.</p><p>
    
    The title track is a very lengthy excursion into just the kind of rootless, rural escapism described above.
    Beginning with a faint, minor chord strumming from Tom Carter and Murray's discordant, distant pedal steel,
    I get the feeling that, for better or worse, I'm in it for the long haul.  Sometimes, the steel guitar is
    content to moan in the background, other times it lapses into the front via tense, dissonant figures.  When
    Tom's arpeggio figure picks up steam, Christina enters with a simple, repeated vocal tone.  Murray occasionally
    echoes her calls with a similarly passive plea in the left channel.  The trio is a model of spacious, free
    co-existence, and you'd do pretty well to avoid the charms of their hypnosis.  ""Unknown Spin"" progresses
    like a drop of milk in water; expanding slowly into countless intricate patterns, each a fascinating exercise
    in the holy schemata of nature.  However, when the piece ends and I back away, it all seems one large, cloudy
    memory; the thrill of the moment as distant as a hundred year-old photograph.</p><p>
    
    If there's one problematic aspect of Charalambides' sound, it's that some of their songs blend together so
    well that they run a risk of being indistinct from one another.  Moments on <i>Unknown Spin</i>-- such as
    ""Magnolia"", which begins similarly to ""Unknown Spin"", with Tom's laidback electric guitar strum and Murray
    again entering on the left with delicate, deep single-note pedal steel lines-- could be interchanged from
    song to song.  Of course, when the results are so consistently spellbinding, I'm not likely to complain.</p><p>
    
    ""Skin of Rivers"" does distinguish itself very nicely with the vocals of Christina Carter and Murray, sounding
    eerily like witches long since removed from casting curses, and content to fade away in the mist.  For about
    five minutes, only the two female voices sound against each other-- though often so perfectly in unison as
    to simulate sine waves.  When Tom Carter's guitar appears from the center, trembling restlessly, the effect
    is almost that of elation, despite the overall volume never rising above a whisper.</p><p>
<i>Unknown Spin</i> was recorded live in the studio, and as such, is a more straightforwardly folky sound
    for Charalambides than some of their other releases (most notably, the spooky, majestic <i>Houston</i>).
    I'm tempted to say it isn't necessarily the best starting place for the uninitiated because of its rather
    Spartan arrangement.  However, I also get the feeling that its journeys are essentially the heart of
    Charalambides' music under any guise, and the real key is in your willingness to see them through.  I
    wonder how many CDs ask so much of a listener, and if fewer still are able to deliver as much solemn
    resonance.  In this case, patience and clarity pay in weightless shards of beauty.</p></div>"|1733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1733-unknown-spin/|8.3|Dominique Leone

As if filing albums by bands like +/-, !!!, and Sunn O))) wasn't confusing
    enough, there are also more subtly deceptive bandnames out there lying in ambush.  By now, everyone knows
    not to file Pink Floyd under ""F,"" but one could hardly be blamed heading to the ""Misc. E"" card with this
    disc, unaware that Winfred E. Eye is actually a band fronted by a guy named Aaron Calvert.  I suppose it
    would be too perfect for music like this to be made by one person with such a fitting, sideshow-appropriate
    name, anyway.  And I guess it's better (or at least less obvious) than any number of other suitable names,
    like, say, Tom Waits &amp; The Bad Seeds.</p><p>
    
    Calvert and his seven-man support corps camp out somewhere between the circus side tent, the witch trials,
    and the Mississippi Delta, and it winds up sounding something like what one imagines Mr. Waits might sound
    like with Blixa Bargeld, Kid Congo Powers, Mick Harvey and Warren Ellis backing him up.  Calvert's voice
    isn't as grotesquely grizzled as Waits', but he works hard to get it there.  Opener ""Run Along"", with its
    bone-room percussion and spookhouse organ, could practically pass for an outtake from <i>Bone Machine</i>
    if not for the lyrics, which steer far from Waits' twisted <i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>-esque surrealism
    and nighthawk poetry and instead come across like a homeless guy's diary entry.</p><p>
    
    The title track lurches along on junkyard percussion and a slow and nasty blues lick that never changes once,
    while Calvert yowls like a dying smoker, wailing lines like, ""The germs all get eaten by the earthworms
    sitting on the dirt tier.""  His lyrics are strange snapshots of ugliness, at times oppressively blunt.
    The gentle acoustic guitar and accordion arrangement of ""Grey Ghosts"" is counteracted with brutal lines
    like, ""Your tongue's in trouble for running your mouth/ Proof in your hands/ Fists in your mouth.""</p><p>
    
    As good the music can be, <i>The Dirt Tier</i> suffers from a relentlessly slow pacing that only highlights
    the cartoonish violence of the lyrics, and its insistence on grit and filth too often feels affected.  The
    reason Tom Waits gets away with stuff like this is that he sees the humor in it, and he plays his persona
    to the hilt, with delight, and that's one step this band will need to take if they're ever going to step
    out from under his shadow.  For now, <i>The Dirt Tier</i> is the eccentricity without the personality to
    put it in context.</p></div>"|8704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8704-the-dirt-tier/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    Def Jam-produced minfomerical in which mainstream rap stars make a case for Tony Montana's sainthood,
    claiming him as the street equivalent of a traditional comic book hero. Jean Grae may traffic in ""gangsta""
    tropes, but she also subverts them by taking a galactic (as opposed to merely earth- or hood-bound) view
    of materialism and depression.  Born in South Africa, but raised in New York by her musician parents,

    suicide. Grey was assumed dead, but she busted out of the womb-thing and got married, only to have to
    cope with her husband's being killed by a heavy heel named Apocalypse. The character's a fine match for
    Grae (though she threatens to change her name to Crystal Meth) because her material is obsessed with
    battling, mourning, self-murder, mind-weapons, alienation, and armageddon.</p><p>
    
    Mr. Lif's labyrinthine concept album <i>I, Phantom</i> ended with an all-star, nuclear-devastation-hindsight
    jam entitled ""Post Mortem"" on which Grae upstages Lif, El-P, and Akrobatik: she regrets dying with a deficit
    of malice. If she'd known she was going to perish in a corporate-sponsored holocaust, she says she'd have
    taken pills, stolen guns, and assaulted women, concluding, ""I wish I'd done more sin.../ Let the devil come
    for me."" That darkness and despair continues throughout much of this ""EP"" (which, at 66 minutes, trumps
    My Morning Jacket's previous length record). Leadoff cut ""Hater's Anthem"" is unfortunate, with the dumb
    chorus, ""Fuck you fuck you fuck you hold up/ Fuck you fuck you fuck you wait nah/ Fuck you fuck you fuck
    you okay/ fuck you fuck you fuck you everybody."" Even the aping of Tony Montana by Scarface on the Geto
    Boys' ""Fuck 'Em"" was less creatively bankrupt, partially due to its propulsive samples; Grae, meanwhile,
    is hampered by soundscapes that recall the GZA/Genius formula: plodding beats matched with classical or
    keyboard-demo loops that never change.</p><p>
    
    A last-will-and-testament song is guaranteed on Grae's releases, and her current entry, ""Take Me"", almost
    constitutes a self-read last-rites: though praying and using King Jamesian diction, Grae still begs to die
    (and yes, Notorious B.I.G. haunts the whole project, and is even overtly channeled). Don't fear the rapper:
    On ""Code Red"", love is dead. On ""My Crew"", rap is dead. On ""Swing Blades"", God is dead. The megamix ""Chapter
    One: Destiny"" begins with a choose-your-own-adventure killing spree, before spiraling into a cut-n-paste
    showcase of loose-style party grinds, older works (Natural Resource's ""Negro League Baseball""), and
    reappropriated (resurrected?) beats by such artists as Mobb Deep, Jay-Z, and Nas.  This cavalcade dares
    to have fun.</p><p>
    
    The previously-noted production limitations (man, some of this percussion is straight off the generic <i>Drum
    Crazy</i> series-- <i>I've</i> even dropped mad wackness over it!) are occasionally transcended by piercing
    soul samples that could provoke the listener to purchase all vinyl in sleeves that feature reclining
    Afro-sporters. The tension of the Wu-tro stuff serves Grae's unsettling vibe well, though, as she decries
    terrorism, militarism, commodity fetishism and nicotine, as well as her own masochism and schizophrenia,
    cramming more logos into a line than Bad Religion, all the while out-alluding MF Doom (reffing entities as
    disparate as Steve Buscemi, <i>Born on the Fourth of July</i>, and a crass spiritual cocktail that summons
    both Pascal's wager and Ned Flanders' scattershot approach).</p><p>
    
    She knows she's impossible. In a rebuttal to critic Oliver Wang (whom she also disses in her liner notes,
    along with Northern State), she disqualifies herself from the roster of hip-hop gamepieces: ""Not a thug,
    not a drugseller, not a gunshooter/ Not a stripper, sex symbol or anything you're used to/ Marketing
    nightmare, I don't fit into categories/ I just rap, make beats, and shit and sleep all these stories.""
    This anxious rapper brags and then requests therapy; her closest historical complement would be the
    no-frills MC Lyte (because Grae has little in common with the regal poses of Miss Melodie and Queen
    Latifah, and even less to do with contemporary or old-school good-time girls).  Grae's videos should
    feature refugees breakdancing while an Escalade outfitted with a weedeater plows through Gethsemane.
    These confrontational cries for help are worried woman blues.</p></div>"|3539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3539-the-bootleg-of-the-bootleg-ep/|7.1|William Bowers

    cockiness, big mouth bravado, and exasperated recordings: his churlish, fuck-off swagger was silly from the
    start, but Adams' self-satisfied smirk has got nothing on his newfound capacity to eschew every last one of
    his songwriter's instincts.  Now, with a discography that's wiggling towards infamy, Adams shoots up one
    last middle finger to the slowly dispersing crowd.</p><p>
    
    It's admittedly unfair that Ryan Adams has been forced to spend most of his songwriting career cowering in
    the shadow of his much-beloved solo debut, enduring loads of (unfavorable) critical comparisons to his
    younger, more inspired self.  Adams' spiral into self-indulgence has triggered plenty of sputtering,
    red-faced indignation, and if it weren't for the lingering resonance of 2000's <i>Heartbreaker</i>, chances
    are nobody would care that each of Adams' subsequent efforts has lacked a certain quiet grace.  Ultimately,
    the problem isn't knee-jerk alt-country purists getting pissed about Adams' penchant for electric guitars,
    or cred-obsessed indie kids hollering about Gap commercials, it's Adams' newfound incapacity (or refusal)
    to write a song with any acceptable degree of sincerity-- and knowing that he probably could really stings.</p><p>
    
    Adams' latest, <i>Rock N Roll</i>, feels sloppy and stupidly rushed; recorded in less than two weeks, the
    record is so blatantly dismissive of both itself and its audience that it insults nearly everyone who
    attempts to interact with it.  Adams' original scheduled-for-2003 release, the largely anticipated <i>Love
    Is Hell</i>, was clumsily manhandled by Lost Highway labelheads before finally being split into two
    separate EPs (respectively subtitled <i>Part I</i> and <i>Part II</i>; <i>Part I</i> was released
    simultaneously with this album), leaving Adams a comparably small window of time in which to record the
    proper follow-up to 2001's bloated-but-redeemable <i>Gold</i>.  Still: it didn't have to be this way.</p><p>
    
    Here, Adams stuffs the contemporary radio-rock cannon with more overblown, riff-heavy regurgitation, most
    of which is either painfully generic or preposterously derivative (the buoyant ""Anybody Wanna Take Me Home""
    cops loosely from The Smiths; ""So Alive"" is karaoke U2; ""1974"" is an uncomfortable Bon-Jovi-meets-The-Stooges
    homage).  The entire record reeks of late new-wave/80s rock cribbing, and consequently, it's difficult to
    write about without duly repeating a laundry list of influences: Adams' muses range from predictable (see
    Joy Division, Paul Westerberg) to bizarre (Adams quasi-mimics the prog diddlings of Rush on the forensically
    titled ""Luminol"", and ends up with a song that sounds a lot like rehashed Oasis).  Suddenly, the record's
    opening couplet-- ""Let me sing a song for you/ That's never been sung before""-- seems vaguely humiliating.</p><p>
    
    It's not so much that <i>Rock N Roll</i> is incorrigibly written as that the record is unforgivably careless,
    unwilling to commit to anything including itself.  Each phoned-in track boasts a new kind of lame production
    (including plenty of weird vocal echoes), tired lyrics (""You're taking me higher than I've been before""),
    overstated guitar-rock noodling, and unbearably repetitive amp assaults-- combined, they successfully obscure
    any kernels of ingenuity that might have been buried beneath the buzz.  Adams' definition of rock and roll
    has always been cartoonish (jean jackets, American flags, bar flitting, surly public appearances), but
    <i>Rock N Roll</i>'s interpretation of its namesake officially approaches ridiculous.</p><p>
    
    In all likelihood, Adams would like for you to think his flippancy is intentional, and for everybody to grin
    and chalk up his cocky half-assing to more authentic rock and roll behavior.  In this, Adams is insistent:
    just as he did with <i>Gold</i>, Adams includes liner note photos of tattoos and cigarettes to remind us
    that he's badass, confirming the characterization with a handful of lazily sprung expletives (including the
    unconvincing ""It's all a bunch of shit.../ It's totally fucked up"" of ""Wish You Were Here""), some clever
    allusions to chemical abuse (""And if I could have my way/ We'd take some drugs""), and an embarrassingly
    obvious I'm-friends-with-The-Strokes aside (booming opener ""This Is It"").  Possibly the best thing about
    ""Rock N Roll"" is how girlfriend Parker Posey is credited in the liner notes as ""Exe'cute'ive Producer,""
    appearing ""courtesy of her bad self.""  At least being precious is being honest.</p><p>
    
    There are some curious guest turns (Billie Joe Armstrong inexplicably pops up, and Melissa Auf Der Maur
    provides background vocals on a handful of tracks, as does Posey), but Adams is almost always at his best
    when he's on his own and thinks no one else is looking: the album's title track is a sweet piano ballad,
    his plaintive wail layered nicely over fuzzy snippets of found sound.  Lasting less than two minutes,
    ""Rock N Roll"" is (check the glaring irony!) also the record's least self-conscious song, a flash of
    earnestness that disappears almost before you notice its arrival.</p><p>
    
    You have to angle <i>Rock N Roll</i> up to a mirror in order to read the cover text properly, and, in a
    way, the inherent fallacy of a mirror image is also the very best metaphor for this record: <i>Rock N Roll</i>
    is backwards Ryan Adams, one-dimensional, vain, and entirely lifeless.</p></div>"|40.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/40-rock-n-roll/|2.9|Amanda Petrusich

Well, they could
    form a band and call it Thunderbirds Are Now!; they could record an album and call it <i>Doctor, Lawyer,
    Indian Chief; they could open said album with a 19-second skit entitled ""KGB Phone Sexxx"", with a girl
    named Jane speaking what is purported to be Russian; and/or they could spend more time composing song titles
    than songs themselves, coming up with non-hilarities like ""Not Witherspoon, but Silverstone"" and ""When It
    Comes to Elements, Hydrogen Is Titz"".</i></p><p>
    
    The songs are spaz-punk shot through with bouncy synths. The musicians wear their attention deficit on their
    sleeves, picking up and discarding riffs and rhythms as they please. Ironically, they end up sounding
    monotonous: almost every song crescendos into the same jackrabbit epiphany, teeters for a while at 200+
    bpm, and topples.</p><p>
    
    I'm aware of a certain nu-spaz scene out there, and some of it sounds pretty potent. Sick Lipstick, for
    instance, make silly-squally thrash in time signatures even <i>they don't know,  and An Albatross are
    to Zappa what grappa is to wine (which is to say, a terse essence).  At best, this sort of stuff has an
    ability to leave you dizzy and panting-- unsure what the fuck's just happened.  Thunderbirds-- on this
    record, at least-- are not nearly unhinged enough to pull this off; far from dangerous, they simply come
    across as unpleasantly mathy.</i></p><p>
    
    Here's what they don't know about themselves: they're actually unintentionally a fantastic new wave band
    stuck in a twitching spazcore body.  Disregard the time-change madness and consider their Action Driver
    labelmates (which include unapologetic new wavers Radio Berlin), and Thunderbirds almost begin to sound
    different by proxy.  ""Pink Motorcycle Helmet"" could, for all intents and purposes, be the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,
    down to resident screamer Ryan Allen's voice.  Elsewhere, ""Party A.R.M."" plays it relatively straight for
    2:08, and ""Who Wants to Fight?"" is 70s glam strut ripped apart and randomly stapled back together.</p><p>
    
    Every other guitar- and synth-line these guys toss about so nonchalantly would be enough to build a single
    around, and if it's not ADD that's keeping Thunderbirds from doing just that, I guess it's the misplaced
    integrity or sheer delight in musicianship. I never thought I would emphatically advice a punk band to dumb
    it down, but Thunderbirds Are Now! could use a lobotomy, a Zen retreat, a major-label deal, or Meg White on
    drums.</p></div>"|8243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8243-doctor-lawyer-indian-chief/|5.9|Michael Idov

We     know she has it in her, because she's let her cards show once-- with ""Cold Cold Water"", an unhinged,     vertiginous, epic single that easily one-upped The Flaming Lips in orchestral bombast and yet remained     intimate as a whisper. That song was a revelation; I feel reasonably safe claiming that it sounded like     nothing anyone had recorded before, save Ennio Morricone as the obvious influence.  Shockingly, Mirah and     her producer-cum-Microphones-bandmate Phil Elvrum blew right past their own brilliance-- the rest of that     album (2002's <em>Advisory Committee</em>) ping-ponged listlessly from coffeehouse folk to rickety lo-fi     electro and back.</p><p>So, does this new offering from Mirah deliver on that semi-accidental promise?  As you can probably glean     from its somewhat unwieldy billing and workmanlike title, it's not meant to.  It's a 28-minute sound collage     that nestles five or six songs among freeform instrumentals, unprocessed ideas and found sounds. <em>Songs     from the Black Mountain</em> comes weighted with tons of extraneous circumstance-- Mirah recorded it with     her friend Ginger Brooks Takahashi during a 30-day stay in a mountain town, presumably on portable equipment;     its proceeds go to charities like the Rock'n'Roll Camp for Girls. In short, this record all but begs not     to be judged as a proper album.</p><p>I don't know what's at the root of this need to bury songs in ephemera, but it's beginning to look a lot     like fear of responsibility. I hated wading through the muck of The Microphones' <em>Song Islands</em> for     morsels of Elvrum's wan songwriting; solo Mirah at her best is so much better than Elvrum that it makes     her worst that much more frustrating.  To demonstrate what I mean, let's just get it over with and divide     the album in two segments which, for easier reference, we'll call ""songs"" and ""other shit.""</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Songs:</span></p>
<p>""The Knife Thrower"": a gently perverse torch ballad reminiscent of <em>Advisory Committee</em>'s ""The Garden""     and ""Light the Match"", wonderfully packed with such antique locutions as ""lark"" and ""asunder.""</p>
<p>""Life You Love"": a surprisingly straight-faced bluegrass number, with stuttering banjo on a bed of languid     lap steel, and both women on vocals.</p>
<p>""Pure"": a minimal yet powerful melody built around one heartbreaking chord change, a whispery incantation     of ""give in"" and precisely applied touches of ambiance both natural and industrial. The album's tentpole.</p>
<p>""Rock of Ages"": sung a capella, aside from a couple of fleeting piano chords, with the friends' voices     double- and triple-tracked into a complicated choral arrangement.</p>
<p>""Oh! September"": pure fun, with doo-wop vocals that actually go ""doo-wop,"" and an honest-to-goodness surf     guitar.  Somewhat reminiscent of her recent brilliant <em>Ragazza Pop</em> compilation contribution, ""Don't"".     A special bonus for rhyming ""baby"" with ""ukulele.""</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Other Shit:</span></p>
<p>""Lil' Bit"": a minute of guitar noodling.</p>
<p>""Birdy Noises"": noises akin to those made by birds.</p>
<p>""Plink Plink Plink"": as advertised.</p>
<p>""The Red Curtain"": actually quite decent, with Eastern chimes and a jerky accordion.</p>
<p>""The Party"": steel drums over a static cello riff.</p>
<p>""Noisy Groove"": 21 seconds of backwards noise.</p>
<p>""Plink Plink"": not to be confused with ""Plink Plink Plink"".  Actually, go ahead.</p>
<p>""Broken Mirah"": a tape loop.</p>
<p>""Acoustic Groove"": guitar, timidly plucked.</p>
<p>""Horny Groove"": alas, a pun on ""horns.""</p>
<p>""Squocky Groove"": a blaring sax.</p>
<p>""Buggy Noises"": noises akin to those made by bugs.</p>
<p>I believe it goes without saying that, for Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn, coming up with that great album will be     a matter of subtraction, not addition.</p>

    as music.  However, the physics and natural mathematical relationships in music can apply to a lot more than
    just the time it takes for you to hear a tree crashing.  In fact, music theory is largely based on math
    principals developed by old Greek guys like Pythagoras, who most of us probably only ever heard about in
    math or physics class.  Yes, I expect intervallic relationships and the origin of a major scale are
    probably old hat and yesterday's cup of tea for all of the dinner table intellectuals out there, and I
    won't bore you with my hilarious retrograde and inversion anecdote-- but I will let you in on a little
    secret: there's more to music than ancient Greek postulates.  Bam!!</p><p>
    
    Since I know you're still getting over that and not really taking this part of the sentence in, I'll start
    the real idea here; chiefly, music, you see, takes advantage of many scenarios that math and physics can
    explain, but not necessarily create.  That part requires a human element, and in our case, it's a very
    good thing (as anyone unfortunate enough to sit through one of those PBS specials about symphony writing
    robots can attest).  That said, some folks like American composer Milton Babbitt have done some pretty
    amazing things with music using theories previously best suited for the biochemistry lab (as distinct from
    Rob Mitchum doing the same thing with music reviews).  Grab some popcorn and prepare for his tale of
    mystery and intrigue!  (And math.)</p><p>
    
    Babbitt was born in Philadelphia in 1916, son of a mathematician.  He'd originally gone to college to study
    math himself, but soon switched to composition.  However, doubtlessly influenced by a very numerically
    informed upbringing, he soon discovered the marvelous world of Arnold Schoenberg's 12-tone music, a kind
    of beast that attempted to do away with the idea of traditional major and minor tonality and basically
    just get all out there with numbers, arrays and rows.  The birth of the 12-tone system meant the birth of
    atonal music as a viable mode of performance-- anyone questioning the relevance of this stuff might need
    to chuck their Sonic Youth records out the window.  Anyway, Babbitt was fascinated by it so much that he
    not only applied its logic to notes, but also to rhythms and duration.  Truly, he so crazy.</p><p>
    
    Babbitt is also quite the music nerd (in the best possible sense) via his contributions to electronic
    music.  Possibly due to the fact that his stuff was becoming too damn hard to play by actual people,
    Babbitt was attracted to the possibilities of the synthesizer and programmed music very early on.  His
    <i>Philomel</i> (1964) is one of the pioneering works for tape and voice, and should be of interest to
    anyone who thought what The Beatles were doing on ""Tomorrow Never Knows""-- or for that matter, what The
    Books are doing now-- was groundbreaking.</p><p>
<i>The Music of Milton Babbitt</i> doesn't really hit on the electronic stuff, but is a fine introduction
    for folks curious about his general modus operandi.  The selections are all from his chamber music (i.e.,
    small ensemble) repertoire, as well as one piece for organ.  Of special interest to Babbitt fans is the
    inclusion of his recently completed ""Swan Song No. 1"", featuring flute, oboe, mandolin, guitar, violin and
    cello.  This generally delicate (but hardly soothing) piece finds Babbitt's usual flair for angular
    ""melodic"" sequences and intimidating, complex rhythmic figures present.  Still, newcomers with a penchant
    for following a zigzag path could probably spend a year chasing the jet trail left by just one of the
    instruments here.  It's not chaos (Babbitt doubtlessly could give mad lectures on the structure of this
    thing)-- in fact, if you listen close enough, he has a curious tendency to repeat things; the violin mocks
    the flute, the cello hands the mandolin his part upside down.  The important thing to remember about
    Babbitt (and many other atonal music composers) is that he isn't trying to scare you, but he might get
    a kick out of tricking you for a bit.</p><p>
    
    ""Quatrains"" is a short episode for voice and two clarinets.  Soprano Tony Arnold (it's a girl) is pretty
    famous for performances of modern classical works, and she's typically impressive here, singing what have
    been extremely challenging lines with impressive delicacy and accuracy.  More than that, the piece itself
    is practically amicable, as Babbitt goes.  Arnold sings of awaking from a dream as the clarinets scamper
    up, around and below her, perhaps imitating the butterflies she notices on her flowerpots.  Allen Blustine's
    clarinet on the three-part ""My Ends Are My Beginnings"" exhibits just as much ease with flighty figures,
    but taken over the duration of the piece, more closely resemble the inner dialogue of a particularly
    stimulated intellectual rather than insects.  Even though it might have been the result of a convoluted
    system of equations, I wonder if it isn't just as clear a picture of what's going on in old Babbitt's
    head.</p><p>
    
    ""Soli e Duettini"" (1989) for two guitars proceeds with similar interplay as the clarinets on ""Quatrains"",
    but with a subtle flamenco aftertaste.  Again, the performance is elegant, but the mood is hardly dainty.
    Babbitt's music often has a way of provoking conflicting emotions from listeners, and not just because
    it's atonal.  His music never really comes out and tells you what to think, and because of its rather
    experimental origins, some people have a tough time making out anything but anything but a bunch of
    ""wrong"" notes.  Still, Bridge has done a nice job of compiling pieces that are relatively easy on the
    ears, yet manage to reward anyone in need of a challenge-- especially with that cover art!  Babbitt is
    one of our greatest living composers, so here's hoping his bandwagon gets a boost.</p></div>"|1091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1091-the-music-of-milton-babbitt/|8.0|Dominique Leone

As the first signing to Depeche Mode keyboardist and founding member Andy
    Fletcher's Toast Hawaii label, the two-woman band bill themselves as Client A and Client B and limit
    promotional photos to shots of their torsos and legs, decked out in matching outfits.  They claim it's
    an attempt to place emphasis solely on their music-- which makes it just another in a series of anti-image
    images.  It's sort of amusing that an up-and-coming synth-pop band on an indie label fashions itself as an
    alternative to what it sees as manufactured pop. I'm not sure that either Led Zeppelin spent a lot of time
    worrying about The Partridge Family, or that Client should be worried about poaching Jessica and Nick's
    potential fanbase, but we won't hold any of that against them.</p><p>
    
    If you must know, Client are Kate Holmes (no, not that one) and Sarah Blackwood (yes, that one). Holmes
    is the musical brain, a former member of both Frasier Chorus and Technique, and the wife of former Creation
    Records boss Alan McGee. Blackwood is the Yorkshire-accented former singer from Dubstar, who scored a few
    minor hits in the mid-1990s, most notably ""Stars"" and ""Not So Manic Now"". (Ironically, considering all of
    Client's pop hand-wringing, the musical half of Dubstar, Steve Hiller, has moved into songwriting, recently
    penning a top five UK single with ex-Take That member Mark Owen.)</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, that anonymity that the members of Client are aiming for-- they're going to get it, because
    their nondescript, evasive approach to promotion spills over into their music. Neither off-putting nor
    engaging, Client's debut occupies a rather uninteresting place in electropop's soft middle. At its best,
    it hums along with a sort of detached glacial sheen, skipping along on pleasant beats and tones, a healthy
    dose of attitude, and a bed of charming, jaunty singles. Too much of the time it comes off as a bit
    waterlogged because of its lack of sonic or vocal range.</p><p>
    
    Blackwood's still-charming vocals are at their best when Client walk the fine line of detailing the life
    out on the dark, unsettling underbelly of cityscapes, like a less floral, more feminized Brett Anderson.
    In album opener/mission statement ""Client"", the band warns lays out their <i>raison d'etre</i>, intoning
    a series of catchphrases such as ""We never say no"" and ""Satisfaction guaranteed."" This sort of erotic
    cabaret act doesn't encroach on Peaches' shock-jock territory-- it explores eroticism rather than wields
    it as a weapon.</p><p>
    
    At their best, Client explore sex (""Price of Love""), drugs (""Pills""), and rock and roll (""Rock and Roll
    Machine"") with cool, calculated precision. Some critics may sneer at Blackwood's coming ""late"" to the
    electropop game, but her warm Northern vocals suit the sound. Comparisons to Ladytron and Adult. may be
    inevitable, but Client aren't as biting or melodically thrilling as either group. Still, this is a decent
    start-- both for the band and Fletcher's label.</p></div>"|1731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1731-client/|6.0|Scott Plagenhoef

    before I listened to this album. I understand this is the most grievous sin a reviewer can wallow in.
    Tricky Woo, Andrew Dickson's old band, was one of the great maestros of Canadian nostalgaragic rock,
    shredding out dimebags of scalding calamity with the attention and maturity of guitar-wreathed
    pre-adolescents. So I was understandably frothing out of my pores when his new band, Soft Canyon, got
    signed to Alien8 Recordings, a triumphantly experimental label that's released everything from Keiji
    Haino to Francisco Lopez. This was truly going to be a melding of minds, my generation's version of the
    Yalta Convention, reassembling post-war Europe with the fury only experimental rock can muster! Basically,
    I fully expected the first track to be called ""Rock 'N Roll Lunar Orbit 89 dash Armageddon<hr/>""  It is
    actually called ""For You"". I believe my response, if this transcript I'm holding is accurate, was, ""Oh.""</p><p>
    
    Rather than impart any negative words to my cherished Alien8, I'm going to put the rest of this review in
    brackets so it will never hurt anyone ever again. Freud called this ""lying."" I call it ""a terrible idea.""</p><p>
    
    [""For You"" starts with a zestful beat, drowsy back-up harmonies, and braiding guitar lines. Unfortunately,
    the chorus is one note pretending it's ten, with a brainless heavy-handedness that would be more appropriate
    on a Train (maybe Green Day) album, one of those songs written for imaginary bands in movies influenced by
    better bands. It's hardly even worth mentioning that the song is about ""magenta planes"" and ""ocean music
    from strings that never end."" (Apparently this is the indie rock version of rap songs professing their own
    potency. Please, bands, stop critiquing yourselves and taking away my money!)  The one compelling aspect of
    the song is the looming guitar solos, occasionally venturing into a sonic unruliness somewhere between
    Tricky Woo and Kim Thayil.</p><p>
    
    Later, ""Hope's Great Divide"" replicates an <i>Abbey Road</i> bridge that wasn't interesting enough for me
    to figure out which specific song it came from. ""Sunflight"" begins as two girthed chords as produced by
    Willie Mitchell, but unexpectedly develops into a subdued anthem. Discouragingly, that anthem seems to be
    ""Sunflight, stay with me tonight.""  Dickson's vocals are either irksomely whiny or in a growl better suited
    to a fifth-wave jam band than these tight pop melodies.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, though, these vagrant genres coagulate into a mighty devilish genre-meld. On ""Kaleidoscope
    Mountain"", evaporating surf-guitar, stiff drums, and exasperatingly childish keyboards bounce over
    rockabilly ska.  I dislike pseudo-surrealistic lyrics and I dislike love lyrics even more, but I have
    been bombarded with enough Johnny Cash articles recently that I have found room in my cancerous heart
    for the chorus, ""I walked into a lake of fire... and washed my hands."" Of course, about halfway through
    it spontaneously decides it would rather be a Pink Floyd tune (and little more).  They might not be engendering
    new avant-garde circles, but, come on, Pink Floyd was a pretty damn good band-- but not good enough that I
    could reasonably be expected to sit through seven minutes of ""We Threw Our Love into the Universe"", a song
    so utterly indebted to Pink Floyd (to the exclusion of all else, including other Floyd plagiarizers) that
    I have little incentive to finish this sentence.</p><p>
    
    Soft Canyon make no attempts to deceive anyone. From the cover to the song titles, the aim of the album
    quite clearly seems to be to serve only as an assortment of rip-offs and homages (indistinguishable ones,
    at that) to Beach Boys-inflected sunshine-pop and doomed surrealistic spaz-metal.  Admittedly, I'm very
    amenable to such combinations, but there's simply not enough here to differentiate Soft Canyon from the
    innumerable minions of Elephant 6-derived progeny.]</p></div>"|7721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7721-broken-spirit-i-will-mend-your-wings/|6.0|Alex Linhardt

CH-CHUNK.</i> When Radiohead burst into British and American living rooms in 1993 with their
    now infamous ode to alienation, ""Creep"", it was only Jonny Greenwood's frenetic guitar stabs that hinted
    at the inspired musical legacy of the band that would soon follow.  They were two jagged electric spasms
    of sonic sledge that not only foreshadowed the majesty of the anthemic guitar-drenched chorus to come, but
    also marvelously served to heighten the emotional content of the song; in this case, the unbearable and
    mounting anger of the self-defeated and alienated.  It was with those two bursts of distorted beauty
    that Jonny Greenwood scripted himself into the vocabulary of rock, and left his first mark on music
    history.</p><p>
    
    It's no shock that Greenwood would become the first member of Radiohead to release solo work.  Anyone who's
    witnessed the band's meticulous career-spanning live show could see that the Jonny Greenwood of 2003 is far
    more peripatetic than his early 90s counterpart. On stage, Greenwood jeers back and forth, alternating
    between crouching in front of his varied arsenal of effects (which includes a transistor radio, a vintage
    patchbay, a laptop, and a number of guitar pedals), to gently lilting in front of his Ondes-Martenot, to
    heroically pounding notes out of his trademark telecaster.  Greenwood is the consummate rock multi-instrumentalist,
    and the music he has composed for <i>Bodysong</i> perfectly reflects this heterogeneous ambition.</p><p>
    
    If Radiohead's <i>Hail to the Thief</i> suffered from being too scatterbrained, Greenwood's <i>Bodysong</i>--
    composed for the nominal British documentary which details the ""experience of being human""-- strikes a
    perfect balance, channeling all his diverse influences into a single multifarious recording.  The album's
    opener, ""Moon Trills"", marries pensive and melancholy piano chords reminiscent of Radiohead's ""Pyramid
    Song"" with swarming frenetic string swells, and weepy Ondes-Martenot accompaniment suggestive of the late
    French composer Olivier Messiaen's Ondes pieces, while ""Splatter"" comfortably melds together a frenzied
    Charles Mingus-inspired bass riff, a DJ Shadow-esque funk break, and Ornette Coleman-styled horn blurts.</p><p>
    
    The movements that comprise <i>Bodysong</i>, despite having their own specific sonic identities, also possess
    an overwhelmingly organic presence; they seem to bleed into and alter one another. The meditative twilight
    of ""Moon Trills"", and its minute-long epilogue ""Moon Mall"", gives birth to the insistent reversed hi-hat
    loop which makes up ""Trench"".  The polyrhythmic chaotic clatter of ""Convergence"", meanwhile, gives way to
    the casual bop of ""Nudnik Headache"", with its lazy drunken drum break, and queasy piano loop.</p><p>
    
    The only aspect of <i>Bodysong</i> that's somewhat disappointing is the inconspicuous lack of guitar work.
    While guitars do show up on two of the tracks (the dubbed-out hallucinatory ""Clockwork Tin Soldiers"" and
    the fractured gloom of ""24 Hour Charleston""), most of <i>Bodysong</i> is made up of lushly ambient strings
    courtesy of The Emperor Quartet, and elaborate webs of percussion. This fact may be of little surprise
    given that Radiohead themselves have infamously eschewed guitars in favor of other musical approaches.
    However, those majestic guitar stabs still linger on: They're in the rolling electric fog of ""Clockwork
    Tin Soldiers"", the disjointed electronic pings of ""Moon Mall"", the frantically wailing horns of ""Splitter"",
    and the uneasy midnight shuffle of ""Nudnik Headache"".  You just have to listen more closely to find them.</p></div>"|3630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3630-bodysong/|7.7|Hartley Goldstein

    noise scene.  At its epicenter is Pee Wee's Pudhouse.  No more than a cramped house serving as a venue
    (but still by all accounts Charlottesville's Hacienda), the Pudhouse puts on donation-only shows, feeds
    performers home-cooked meals, and even allows bands who just happen to show up unexpectedly a place in
    that night's line-up-- the likes of which have included Quintron, Neon Hunk, and Lightning Bolt.</p><p>
    
    USAISAMONSTER's Colin Matthews and Tom Hohmann, both former Bostonians, are among the most responsible
    for planting the demon seeds of Charlottesville's noise scene. The two were the first to rent out the space
    that would become the Pudhouse, and were the venue's biggest promoters and most frequent performers. Various
    lineups of the band (at one point numbering seven people) quickly cut four albums, the first one within
    weeks of the band merely existing. For whatever reason-- perhaps it was the incident when drunk beardclashers
    nearly set the venue ablaze-- USAISAMONSTER decided it was time to leave town, and soon relocated to Brooklyn,
    playing and recording their brand of jerky, often melodic noise-rock, and eventually landing on the radar
    of genre heavyweights Load Records.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to <i>Tasheyana Compost</i>.  Now a duo, USAISAMONSTER's most recent effort is a varied
    ten-song collection that can at times recall the spasm and quirky melodicism of Deerhoof, the heavy-handed
    drumwork of Sightings, and the riffcentricity of Pink &amp; Brown.  The band is at its best when these elements
    interact effortlessly, affording songs a curious tinge of edgy, mournful Americana that ultimately defines
    the overall tone of the record.</p><p>
    
    ""Reservation treaties no longer stand"" in opener and standout track ""Somehow"", a passionate battle cry on
    behalf of Native Americans whose ""home cannot be returned."" A reverent guitar line and snare drum roll
    accompany thoughts on the rift between modern and tribal culture and our respective interactions with
    nature: ""Run and get a wrench.  Let's get the hell out of here.""  Thoughts become fragmented alongside
    more spastic rhythmic figures in the second part of the song, bridged to the first and the third by a
    Deerhoofian duet of Casio keyboard and guitar. The band returns once more to unhinged jumpy narrative,
    concluding in quirk with, ""In light of native history the progress looks like cancer cells to me somehow,""
    an unsettling finale if only because it's couched in such precocious melody.</p><p>
    
    While not possessing the ambition of ""Somehow"", ""No More Forever"" is similarly jerky, the Casio keyboard
    reappearing as part of a guitar duet behind steadily intensifying drumwork, rapid-fire guitar octaves, and
    a close-harmony rendition of Nez Perce Chief Joseph's famous last words, ""I will fight no more forever.""
    ""Ruin"" blends noisy Sightings-like territory, discordant DC mathematica, and Tom Waits-ish vocal delivery.
    Album closer ""Crumble"" recalls Deerhoof once more musically and thematically, a compelling ballad on man's
    environmental disrespect: ""Painted symbol marks the hidden place overgrown pile of robotic waste."" The song
    ebbs in and out of rolling torrents of rabid strummed guitar, reverting back to its relatively clean
    folk-like setting for conscious lyrics that somehow never grate, and finishing itself in octave-jangling
    bravado.</p><p>
    
    For all these unusually human moments in a genre not known for its sanguinity, USAISAMONSTER occasionally
    give too much precedent to riffage at the expense of any discernable or cohesive song structure. In these
    instances, what results is an unfocused, poorly considered parade of butt guitar; it's loud, but hardly
    interesting or much of anything else. ""Screaming Bloody Murder"" is perhaps the biggest offender, further
    weighed down by its downright awful free association word plays: ""Next hot glue gun karaoke duck bill
    platypus wack pretending alien sabertooth hippy punk ham hock soup."" ""Anal Lies"" takes second place, and
    ""Poison Snake"", which opens promisingly, degenerates into mindless riffage.</p><p>
    
    It's rash, though, to count the penultimate track ""Love"" among USAISAMONSTER's failed musical experiments
    on <i>Tasheyana Compost</i>-- indeed, its last minute of discord fearlessly bubbling over soulless garage-rock
    and 80s hair-metal theatricality poses an enormous question: can the genre accommodate other musical
    traditions? Is this something it even wants? Noise-rock has proven it can be loud, but now what? Is song
    structure its next point of refinement? <i>Tasheyana Compost</i> hints at possible directions for the
    genre, and, while not fully realized itself, the album promises much in store.</p></div>"|8378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8378-tasheyana-compost/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

    ex-Company Flow DJ Mr. Len and Masterminds producer/emcee Kimani Rogers-- have a sense of humor.  They
    also, in representing a disenchanted sect of the hip-hop underground, have a fresh message, fractured and
    unpolished though it may be.</p><p>
    
    Vocalist Kimani is the most important variable in determining your reaction to the group's full-length
    debut, <i>Something's Gotta Give</i>.  His style here is no-frills, mixing a steady, monotonous delivery
    with straightforward lyrics that-- at least until his content hits you-- give him the presence of any
    generic indie emcee.  His tendency to opt for either idiosyncratic humor or emotional poignancy gives
    his flow an immediacy that lends itself to a more identifiable persona, and recalls more introspective
    artists like MURS and Slug.  His topical breadth, meanwhile, runs the gamut from tales of the infamous
    friendship zone (""The Line""), to dealing with depression and sleeping issues (""Insomnia 411"" with Jean
    Grae and Slug), to the various problems inherent in society (""Troublearth"").  Suffice to say: those expecting
    a verbal firestorm will want to turn elsewhere.</p><p>
    
    But one attribute that separates Kimani's character from others is his obvious rock influences. ""Timmy""
    lifts its chorus from Primus' ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver""; ""A Meditation on Why Love Sucks"" opens with
    Kimani crooning lines from Leadbelly's ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night"", and the skit ""I Am So Rich""
    samples ""Art Star"" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Most overt are the consistent Nirvana references: Kimani speaks
    of ""nightmares with wrists slit, smashed through the windowpanes/ I woke up in cold sweats with visions of
    Kurt Cobain,"" gets robbed at an ATM by Kurt Loder over a loop of ""Scentless Apprentice"", and, most
    interestingly, happens to be a depressed Pisces, disillusioned with the most popular pillars of his genre.
    It's a parallel that adds an interesting dimension to otherwise uninspired music.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of some issues with his less-than-spectacular flow, Kimani is still one to bring a burner when
    it comes to more trad-rap issues.  ""New Jack City"" melds the production sensibilities of Little Johnny from
    the Hospitul with Kimani's pleasant drone for one of the most addictive tracks of the year.  Sporting a
    jagged railroad blues smasher, he admonishes the new guard of underground hip-hop, claiming to be ""from a
    time when cats wore hats that fit/ And when beef would ever kettle, it gets settled with fists.""  He also
    manages to hold a spotlight on artists: ""Dr. Seuss raps/ <i>Cat in the Hat</i>/ Where you just fill in the
    blanks and get a pat on the back/ Then a platinum plaque.""</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, there are some inconsistencies with the production.  Although the liners say it comes
    courtesy of both members (mostly Mr. Len), Kimani's hit-and-miss traditional loop style is radically
    disparate with Mr. Len's ruggedly eccentric, electronic beat masonry. Some triumphs show through the
    lo-fi Buddy Slim-esque dreamscape of ""Troublearth"", the raw keyboard catwalk of ""The Line"" and the warped
    synth and distorted screams of ""Maybe"", but the majority of the album's production is either too convoluted
    (the dry piano sample and corny drum arrangement of ""Insomnia 411"") or unpleasantly arrhythmic (the jagged,
    awkward keyboard nodes and offbeat drums of ""Lately"").</p><p>
    
    Despite their questionable production choices, uninspired topics, and spotty sound quality, Roosevelt
    Franklin's future remains bright. If Kimani can tilt his delivery to more varied cadences and Mr. Len
    can contain his desire for innovation that too often results in awkward tracks, this young New York duo
    shows the potential of channeling their obvious talents into a more accessible product.</p></div>"|6901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6901-somethings-gotta-give/|6.8|Rollie Pemberton

I got all the shit you need right here, all the fresh
    tracks you need to know about to impress that record store chick with the Chan-hair and Loeb-glasses.  I
    got all the finest mixes of all the latest genres: carport, kaleidocore, lapelgaze-- hell, if you want,
    I'll give you the entire contents of my iPod-knockoff on shuffle: that'll last you six days or so.</p><p>
    
    What, you say a playlist isn't worth any money?  You say who the hell am I that you would want to squander
    a hard-earned paycheck percentage on a mix disc of my making?  Well, then, explain to me why you just
    cashed in a peach twenty on Ladytron's <i>Softcore Jukebox</i>!  Sure, they may be big shots in the highly
    dubious world of ""electropop,"" what with their fancy blinking-light keyboards and Roxy Music tribute
    cover art.  But in the era of the file-sharing speakeasy, when the distance between recommendation and
    listening is covered as fast as your DSL runs, pause-between-tracks compilations of this sort don't fulfill
    the role they used to.</p><p>
    
    Okay, okay, <i>Softcore Jukebox</i> is such an excellent grab-bag I can cut it some slack.  Turns out when
    Ladytron slice themselves open for some gross anatomy, their keyboard-spangle sound disassociates into
    equal parts critic's-pet rock, white-label 12's, and electrotrash.  Slammed together, it's an hour-twenty
    set of danceability without the usual preconceptions about what's ""acceptable"" dance music.  It's just a
    shame they couldn't have at least downloaded that crossfader plugin for Winamp.</p><p>
    
    Starting out with the ambassadorial move of slotting My Bloody Valentine, Wire, and The Fall within the
    first five tracks, Ladytron quickly get to the core of why they're the one group under the electroclash
    banner that gets spun on indie-rock dance night.  A new version of their own ""Blue Jeans"" that almost seems
    to accommodate a sample of ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" (Sonic Youth's version, at least) and space allotted to
    an ancient song from dance-punk procrastinators !!! are yet more beat connections to the arms-crossed
    crowd.</p><p>
    
    Though I'm not sure how many head-nod loyalists are willing to embrace a comp that connects the dots
    between <i>Loveless</i> and Fannypack, I salute Ladytron for the attempt.  ""Hey Mami"" is the best of the
    tracks that reflect Ladytron's coy, flirtatious side, unabashed fun alongside ooo-dirty-me! crude-beat
    like Xtina's ""What's a Girl to Do"" or, um, Fat Truckers' ""Teenage Daughter"".  More classical tropes of
    dance music are highlighted by the updated disco of Dondolo's ""Peng"" and MIDI diva-anthem ""You Got the
    Love"", while Snap Ant's ""Saviour Piece"" cuts and dices acoustic guitar like an audition to produce for
    Madonna.</p><p>
    
    All these disparate elements are most emphatically wadded-up in Ladytron's sole completely-new contribution
    to the disc, a wonderfully twisted reworking of Tweet's ""Oops Oh My"" built on ""National Anthem"" fuzzbass
    and flanging keyboard assaults.  No fronting on the original, but Ladytron's darker take drops a Roofie
    into the single's keg cup, morphing the tune from swept-away swoon into date-rape you can dance to (and
    feel appropriately filthy about afterwards).  It's a cover with something to say, miles away from the
    usual indie-band-covering-radio-hit irony-jerkoff.</p><p>
    
    A segue from ""Oops Oh My"" to the Big Brother &amp; The Holding Company clone Shocking Blue to Beach Boys-ambient
    Pop Levi to echobox-cowboy Lee Hazlewood's ""Some Velvet Morning"" closes out <i>Softcore Jukebox</i> with a
    bang-- yet they're not really segues at all.  And that's the frustrating thing: with the continued,
    mystifying dearth of DJ mixes incorporating rockist leanings (does nobody realize the appeal of 2 Many
    DJ's was less mashup gimmickry and more the excitement of hearing rock placed back into a dance context?),
    Ladytron comes a couple dozen easy beat-matched transitions away from filling a gaping hole.  In missing
    this opportunity, they've created a fantastic dance-party playlist, but one that could just as easily have
    been posted on their website as a guide-map through the Soulseek wilderness.</p></div>"|4634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4634-softcore-jukebox/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

You could argue that these last four have seen quite a bit more change
    than most similar spans-- the years all start with a 2 now, television networks have just stopped trying
    and resorted to shoveling unscripted emotional manipulation in front of their viewers, and the entire
    American complex of invulnerability came down in a horrible hail of debris two Septembers ago, changing
    our collective view of the world for the foreseeable future.  It was four years ago, in 1999, that we last
    heard from the guys in Wheat, and mercy, what the time hasn't done to them.</p><p>
    
    Back when the 90s were drawing to a close, Wheat sounded pretty well at home plying a brand of melancholic,
    slightly lo-fi mope-rock.  For all intents, they were an indie rock archetype for their era, filling in
    while Guided by Voices seemed to be aiming arenaward and Sebadoh were falling apart.  But as much as they
    captured the era on their sophomore LP, <i>Hope and Adams</i>, most music has since moved on to brighter,
    more rhythmic pastures, and this apparently wasn't lost on Wheat.  <i>Per Second Per Second Per Second...
    Every Second</i> is Wheat's third full-length and first for a major, and the difference is huge from the
    first note to the last.</p><p>
    
    Wheat always had a whiff of the suburban anthem in them (see: ""Raised Ranch Revolution"" from <i>Hope and
    Adams</i>), but they take a whole-hearted leap into huge, airwave-friendly shoes here that you'd hardly
    even recognize them.  Producer Dave Fridmann, who also worked with the band four years ago, might as well
    be Dave Eringa as far as the sound of the thing is concerned-- it's punchy, and packed full of big riffs,
    tight harmonies and sharp, close-mic'd drumming, half a world removed from his work with Mercury Rev,
    The Flaming Lips and The Delgados.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, the band is up to the challenge of turning up the spotlights and the volume, and they crank
    out a solid batch of insanely catchy, pristine pop songs that'll crawl inside your brain and die there,
    only to come back and haunt you at the oddest times.  ""Closer to Mercury"" is bursting with guitar riffs and
    harmonized leads, occupying a strange place between Thin Lizzy and U2.  Principle vocalist Scott Levesque
    breaks out in a big way on this album, verging on (rock) operatic at times-- he even tiptoes around the
    ghost of Jeff Buckley on ""Life Still Applies""-- but always with his signature hint of grit and resignation
    holding it down to earth.</p><p>
    
    Wheat don't waste any time announcing how much they've changed, kicking off with the choppy rhythms of ""I
    Met a Girl"" and Levesque's chorus of ""I met a girl I'd like to know better/ But I'm already with someone""
    bypassing everything for the jugular.  The song's bridge smooths out, almost getting lost under a wave of
    vocal processing, but the chorus roars back for a final go-round just in time.  ""Breathe"" nods to George
    Harrison with its lead guitar part over a bubbling bassline and wordless backing vocals, one of several
    songs that ought to keep college DJs busy for a few weeks.</p><p>
    
    Wheat have made a bold move here by stepping out entirely from behind whatever lo-fi shield remained on
    their last album and hurling themselves completely into no-holds-barred pop.  <i>Per Second</i> has an
    immediacy that it once seemed unlikely we'd ever hear from this band, to the point where some of Wheat's
    old fans may not be willing to follow them down their new path.  It's their loss, really.  <i>Per Second
    Per Second Per Second... Every Second</i> is an expertly crafted great time.</p></div>"|8641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8641-per-second-per-second-per-second-every-second/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    the appropriately epic metaphor, or fervently combing your memories for an applicable landscape: fiercely
    organic, Crescent's spare, throbbing soundscapes are hard to link up to anything other than large, natural
    formations.  It's unsurprising, then, that Crescent, along with Movietone and Flying Saucer Attack, are
    the byproduct of Bristol's quasi-legendary space-rock scene.</p><p>
<i>By the Roads and the Fields</i>, the band's fourth record (and first since 1999's <i>Collected Songs</i>)
    is still lodged firmly in the goo of post-rock drone-- its hazy, sprawling tracks pour on an avalanche of
    slow, spectral structures that often recall onetime labelmates Third-Eye Foundation.  Punctuating their
    percussive tracks with tiny, hidden melodies, Crescent seem far less concerned with capturing anyone's
    attention than slowly seeping into their audience's collective subconscious, and as a result, <i>By the
    Roads</i> plays more like a long-term installation than a transient collection of songs.</p><p>
    
    Supposedly conjured with ""no budget,"" <i>By the Roads and the Fields</i> is a brilliant exercise in
    empty-pocket resourcefulness: recorded on eight-track tape, the album boasts the unpredictable stylings
    of a self-made double bass, a stack of metal bowls, clips of found sound, prepared piano, copycat tape
    delays, bowed wine glasses, and loads of atmospheric tape hiss.  Ultimately, Crescent's shoestring studio
    setup is evident in both its feats and foils: although meticulously arranged, there's an element of
    scrappiness inherent to these songs, a kind of palpable fragility that suggests that everything here
    could fall apart if shaken too hard, dissembling onto the floor in a fit of clatters and pings.  Piano
    bits and meandering saxophone melodies wander in and out of the forefront, snippets of Melodica and organ
    pop up unannounced, and sparse, careful percussion strings everything together-- just barely.</p><p>
    
    Matt Jones' monotone, straight-faced chant/sing is hypnotic in its redundancy, but not especially engaging;
    even if you hug your eyes shut and mentally strip Jones' voice of its bloody red origins, it still doesn't
    add much to the wispy instrumentation, remaining too deliberately detached and lethargic to justify the
    distraction it inspires.  Consequently, ""Mica"", the album's lone instrumental, is also its most compelling:
    a series of metal bowl-banging pings orchestrated (interrupted by the chirps of birds) and arranged,
    ""Mica"" is both weird and warm, a stark, metallic composition that's also surprisingly innovative.</p><p>
    
    But even while <i>By the Roads and the Fields</i> is, at times, a compelling sonic experiment, it's one
    with no discernable resolution-- at just over 45 minutes, the record is short enough that it can easily be
    fully absorbed in one sitting, but it can also be unbearably tiring, too misleading and smoky to feel like
    a particularly honest or persuasive offering.</p></div>"|1730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1730-by-the-roads-and-the-fields/|6.0|Amanda Petrusich

Recorded in New York and mixed in Michigan, this record is no exception.  Here, the two bands' frequency     cruelties overlap-- all five tracks are untitled, and even the bandnames on the sleeve are obscured by the     invigorating tagline: ""The Lord Helps You.""</p>
<p>The two groups forgo percussion through almost the entire first half of the album, instead setting their     sights to stringing up sine waves and static electricity gurgles.  The cumulative effect of such moves     slowly conjures up a sinister stasis merging with the lost echoes of the other tetchy elements as they     sink below in the soupy mix, giving the early goings a murky undertow that threatens to keep the proceedings     too still. On the choppy surface of the waves, a tugboat churns through the fog, but little is discernible     beyond obfuscated shapes, and I keep waiting for the monsters to finally show themselves amongst all the     primitive test signals and squeals.</p>
<p>By track number three, the wintry winds of Aaron Dilloway and John Olson blow the doors wide open, letting     in Hisham Bharoocha's corpse-thudding kickdrum and Eric Copeland's high shrieks. The beastly beat flings     guts at the walls and the homemade circuits scream bloody murder before the track's throat gets slashed     altogether, guaranteeing inclusion on your next haunted house mix.  The remainder of the side is a slow     slur of star hums and open-mouthed ghosts being twisted into tiny knots.</p>
<p>Side B is given over to what could pass as a long-lost purgatorial landscape left off last year's     <i>Beaches &amp; Canyons</i> or a John Carpenter score for a Tylenol Cluster Headache Gelcaps commercial.     A CD skips along in the underworld, slowly intertwining Wolf Eyes' menacing ghost machines with Black     Dice's bass-heavy boiling. Around such a pulse, the remaining players pull noisy chunks right off the     humming bone, picking the skeleton clean with saw-toothed oscillations and beaked stabs of hotwires     before the side finally melts down into a single telltale heart pulsing against the floorboards. The     seven players never quite reach the kinds of catharsis and climax that each separate entity produces,     instead wallowing in the sort of dreaded ambience that, even when tossed off, offers a shivering sort     of ebb and flow.</p>

In 2003 alone, he's
    released a pair of EPs on Spectral Sound (the more house-oriented arm of Ann Arbor's Ghostly International
    label), recorded for Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 imprint (as False) and Markus Nikolai's Berlin-based Perlon
    label (as Jabberjaw), and now finally delivers his debut full-length, <i>Leave Luck to Heaven</i>. It's
    no wonder that Dear allows his work to be represented by a wide range of labels, from Ghostly's electro-pop,
    to Plus 8's minimal techno, to Perlon's tech-house-- his music blends elements of each of those genres.</p><p>
    
    So, yeah, more eclecticism, then?  Not really, <i>Leave Luck to Heaven</i> is more like alchemy. Instead
    of genre-hopping from track to track-- substituting some sort of focused vision and sound for a lack of
    ideas dressed up as a surfeit of them-- Dear boils down his wide-ranging influences and combines elements
    of his own more catagorizable work.  The result is his most satisfying release to date and (along with
    Ricardo Villalobos' <i>Alcachofa</i>) another techno-dub record that deftly straddles the line between
    home listening and the dancefloor.</p><p>
    
    Comparisons to Hawtin and Villalobos arguably flatter to deceive at this point in Dear's career, but
    they're far from unfounded.  In a sense, Dear is creating sounds that blend the same elements that Hawtin
    used as building blocks on his Final Scratch-assisted mix CD <i>Decks, EFX &amp; 909</i>. And, like the Chilean
    Villalobos, Dear takes cues from the Teutonic trends toward mixing the spatial qualities of dub with
    traditional house beats while retaining an outsider's ear.</p><p>
    
    As a result, <i>Leave Luck to Heaven</i> is an attractive listen for causal electronic listeners.  Its ebb
    and flow of soothing melodies and lubbing beats-- and its blend of vocal and instrumental tracks-- keeps
    things lively and creates a sense of balance and dynamics. When the record peaks it's often when Dear stays
    closer to Detroit techno roots such as the invigorating stripped-and-clipped jaunt of ""Just Us Now"" or
    minimal second-wave melody of ""The Crush"".  Elsewhere, gently snapping beats and gracious stabs and eerie
    washes of synths color Dear's deceptively complex rhythms, creating palpable sensations of tension and
    release on tracks such as ""An Unending"" and ""You're Fucking Crazy"", each of which twitch and hum with
    hollowed-out nervous energy.</p><p>
    
    The vocal tracks, sung in gentle falsetto, veer closest to machine-age electro and the deep, rolling
    basslines of Detroit's second-wave techno. They also provide the highlights of the record: ""It's Over Now""
    and ""Dog Days"".  The former brings life during wartime to the disco. It takes the infectious repetition
    and sense of communality of the dancefloor, and alternates between sarcastically joining calls to arms
    (""I don't want to feel left out"") and hoping that that isn't the bomb that brings us together (""Why can't
    we work it out?"").  ""Dog Days"" is better still, a flat-out infectious electro-pop gem, a rope-skipping
    sing-song of synthetic horns, Dear's cyclical vocals and a see-saw of pulsating tones and beats. ""Tell
    another story,"" Dear repeats, enthusing the beat to go on and on-- which it does for six head-bobbing
    minutes. It could have gone on for another six.  In a year in which Dear has written his share of stories,
    ""Dog Days"" is the standout chapter.</p></div>"|2526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2526-leave-luck-to-heaven/|7.8|Scott Plagenhoef

Frustrated by the music I was hearing
    on the radio, and lacking the guidance of a knowledgeable older sibling or a hip college radio station, my
    interest in music gradually devolved into belligerent apathy.  Turning what little hope I had left towards
    the Internet, I happened upon a group whose bandname interested me: Guided by Voices.  In what, for me,
    seemed an incredibly defiant gesture at the time, I ordered <i>Mag Earwhig!</i> without having heard a
    note of it, and five-to-seven business days later, I had a new favorite band.</p><p>
    
    A year later, my new favorite band put out a new album.  <i>Do the Collapse</i> was host to a few great
    tracks, but the cheesier moments sprinkled liberally over Robert Pollard's songs proved tremendously
    disheartening.  For the first time, I took to reading reviews of Guided by Voices' records, each one
    fortifying my belief that the quality of their output had been spiraling downward since the glory days
    of <i>Bee Thousand</i> and <i>Alien Lanes</i>.  Over the course of Guided by Voices' next few albums,
    my excitement began to wane, and by the time <i>Earthquake Glue</i> was released this year, I had all
    but lost interest in Guided by Voices.</p><p>
    
    Up until recently, I'd never have thought that a one of these collections could rekindle my interest in a
    long-neglected band-- it's just hard to shake the feeling that enjoying a best-of album is like beating a
    video game with all the cheat codes on.  But listening to <i>Human Amusements at Hourly Rates</i>, it
    becomes immediately clear that Guided by Voices' vast and uneven catalog is perfectly suited for this
    treatment.  Over the course of fifteen records, two (going on three) box sets, and countless singles and
    EPs, Robert Pollard has written more than enough brilliant songs to carry five of these things.  But those
    great songs have always been broken up by weaker tracks on GBV full-lengths, putting a damper on the
    momentum that could be generated by an uninterrupted sequence of near-perfect rock tracks.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Human Amusements</i>, this unadulterated flow of excellence is fully realized, and the results are
    absolutely glorious.  Best-of records are frequently criticized for robbing songs of the context created
    by their respective albums, but <i>Human Amusements</i> succeeds largely for this very reason, collecting
    material from the most seemingly disparate eras of Guided by Voices' output, and reconstructing them into
    a surprisingly cohesive whole.  The shallow and misleading ""lo-fi"" tag has led many to construct an
    impregnable descriptive barrier between ""early"" and ""late"" Guided by Voices, but <i>Human Amusements</i>
    is an alarmingly seamless listen.  Indeed, the way the album is sequenced often serves to draw attention
    away from discrepancies in production, and towards the uniformly excellent quality of Pollard's songwriting.</p><p>
    
    Many of the songs on <i>Human Amusements</i> actually come across much better here than they did on their
    respective albums.  The synth-whispers of ""Things I Will Keep"", which seemed so insincere and cheesy on
    <i>Do the Collapse</i>, now appear utterly insignificant when compared to the song's gorgeous melody and
    subtle rhythmic variations.  The languid melancholy of ""To Remake the Young Flyer"", which got slightly
    lost in the submerged early sections of <i>Under the Bushes Under the Stars</i>, is twice as affecting
    immediately following the crisp, upbeat pop of ""Game of Pricks"".  The few selections chosen from Pollard's
    pre-<i>Propeller</i> era are top notch, and much easier to stomach outside of the generally mediocre albums
    from which they were drawn.</p><p>
    
    As with any best-of album from a band with such a vast output, the final tracklist is bound to be the
    subject of debate.  Personally, I don't see how ""Smothered in Hugs"", what I would consider to be the best
    song on <i>Bee Thousand</i> and a perennial fan favorite, could have been omitted from an otherwise
    well-considered tracklist.  I was also disappointed to see that ""Weed King"" from <i>Propeller</i> and ""Don't
    Stop Now"" and ""Drag Days"" from <i>Under the Bushes</i> were left out.  Ultimately, though, it's hard to
    register much of any disappointment with the tracks that Pollard did choose.  Rather than simply picking
    his favorite tracks, Pollard seems to have put a lot of thought into selecting a sequence of songs that
    holds together incredibly well as an album.</p><p>
    
    Aside from an album cover that looks like a 12-year-old's first Photoshop project, there are plenty of
    reasons to be skeptical of <i>Human Amusements at Hourly Rates</i>.  Best-of albums are generally disjointed
    and disappointing, especially if you're already familiar with the band's output, and Robert Pollard hasn't
    exactly shown himself to be the most adept person at judging his own work.  But the momentum and contrast
    worked into <i>Human Amusements</i> is so staggering that it far exceeds any Guided by Voices mix CD I've
    ever put together or heard.  Listening to this album now, I can feel echoes of the same giddy excitement
    that I haven't been able to fully recapture since I listened to <i>Mag Earwhig!</i> for the very first
    time.  I may have heard them all a hundred times before, but these are my 32 new favorite songs.</p></div>"|3597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3597-human-amusement-at-hourly-rates-the-best-of-guided-by-voices/|9.5|Matt LeMay

I could almost use it in a sentence to correlate my previous experiences
    with the music of Portuguese guitarist/composer Rafael Toral. I was able to use his second solo album of
    extreme/gentle <i>Loveless</i>-washes, 1995's <i>Wave Field</i>, to both fall asleep to (at a low volume)
    and wake up with (at a higher level). Seeing him twice in a live setting never failed to put me to sleep,
    though, and with his latest outing, <i>Electric Babyland/Lullabies</i>, it seems as if he's come to terms
    with the Sandman and decided to indulge in the creation of some legitimately sleep-inducing tunes.</p><p>
    
    Toral's concentration on each of his records has always been on isolated sound objects and the process of
    making long-form pieces out of them. Albums like <i>Wave Field</i>-- or his last album for the prestigious
    experimental label Touch, <i>Violence of Discovery and Calm of Acceptance</i>-- focused on his Fender Jaguar
    for most of the coaxed sounds, while his <i>Aeriola Frequency</i> was composed from the non-sounds of two
    delay pedals with no inputs.</p><p>
    
    The first five tracks of this new album are sourced from a little music box,
    comprising almost a half hour of clean rings and distorted metallic melodies either glitched up or left to
    make a slowly solidifying sustain of held tones. The first half of the record tinkers around without much
    success, not quite settling to sleep as much as turning restlessly, without a satisfying position of rest.
    The disc starts to wind up (or perhaps down) with the third piece, ""Rdm"", plunking the tongs in its most
    straightforward way.  It twinkles like Sun Ra's ""Medicine for a Nightmare"" melody, the speeds tweaked in
    the middle as it both warps fast and then slows before finally reaching a shimmering stasis.</p><p>
    
    ""Dne"", at nearly ten minutes, is more methodical in its gleaning of the music box melody. It starts off
    steadfastly, as Toral builds up an incessant plucking.  The physical motion almost crackles as the underlying
    vibration slowly wakens into itself, soon blanketing the track with a very warm dreamscape that seems to
    embody the deepest stage of beatific sleep.</p><p>
    
    ""My Head on Your Shoulders Feels Like Home"" opens the <i>Lullabies</i> section of the album, continuing the
    music box theme as its foundation.  Here, the tinny melody becomes heavily distorted, but its gurgling only
    coos briefly at a minute or so, and it never has a chance to sink deeper. ""Little Stars"" recreates the
    instrument's soft twangs on guitar, approaching the lilt of a lullaby for an indifferent two minutes. The
    final track, though, ""Bodyjoya Mix Pt. 12: Dreaming into the Locked Groove"", takes the fuzzy notes of the
    guitar and rocks them into a low-level hum, and then keeps it on that almost imperceptible plane for a good
    13 minutes of dreamy effervescence. It seems less ironic than intentional that the two sleepiest movements
    of the disc are what keep it interesting in the end.</p></div>"|11850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11850-electric-babylandlullabies/|6.9|Andy Beta

    takes more money and effort to sound ""bad""-- in that specific, tightly regimented, Four-Track-Demos-on-a-Two-Dollar-Guitar
    way-- than it does to sound produced.  With the advent of ProTools and its sundry cheaper alternatives,
    the PC has become the real weapon of the proletariat, resigning the Tascam to the kind of wanker nostalgia
    John Vanderslice spoofs in ""Me and My 424"".  Now that cutting, pasting and tweaking material at the touch
    of a button has become the soundest and most cost-effective recording method, the current purveyors of
    lo-fi must practice stoicism that borders on narcissism.</p><p>
    
    This, mind you, is a major breakthrough for me-- sort of like the time I realized that the average goth
    spends more time in front of the mirror than the average cheerleader-- and I've got Party of One to thank.
    They sound like absolute shit, which I'm sure they'd take as a compliment: every note produced by every
    instrument on <i>Caught the Blast has been meticulously designed to suck.  You know precisely what
    I'm talking about: dry, tinny, not-quite-tuned guitars, castrated bass, hissy cymbals, a snare drum that
    sounds like somebody left a half-eaten sandwich in it.  Add a male vocalist who trades in sub-Malkmusian
    yelps an octave over his natural range, and his female associate who whispers as if embarrassed to be
    there, and we've got the perfect end result of everything bands like Sebadoh and the Swirlies have wrought,
    handily doubling as a parody.</i></p><p>
<i>Caught the Blast opens with ""Snap You Like a Twig"", addressed to ""all you pricks in the present and
    all you pigs in the past."" Of course, it's not really ""addressed"" to anyone or anything-- singer/songwriter
    Eric Fifteen is far too clever to rely on actual subjects; his lyrics consist mostly of unrelated idioms
    culled from the white noise of the American media (although signed to a British label, the band hails from
    Minnesota), usually repeated ad nauseam. Since his verbiage betrays a number of nights spent in the company
    of Fox News and a joint, Party of One will inevitably mistaken for a ""political"" band; well, yeah, they do
    have a song called ""Baghdad Boogie"", an unpleasantly Ween-like number sung from the point of view of a
    caricatured fedayeen: ""Bring your boys home in a box/ You got an army that really sucks rocks."" Look: real
    dissent, real provocation, real satire would come in really handy right about now.  This is none of those
    things; Saddam Hussein seems to occupy roughly the same cultural space in this ironist's brain as Scooby-Doo.</i></p><p>
    
    Party of One also have a song called ""Six Million Anonymous Deceased"", the chorus of which goes (prepare
    yourselves): ""Six million anonymous deceased, six million anonymous deceased"" about 16 times in a row, and
    none of these times does the incantation mean shit to Eric Fifteen. Is he an intuitive Situationist? Nah,
    he clearly can't be bothered. It's an intellectual equivalent of lo-fi, and in 2003, it's just as dishonest.
    A pose of bemused ineptitude is a pose first and foremost, and Party of One are nothing if not poseurs.
    This band's entire <em>raison d'etre</em> is to demonstrate how suavely they go about the business of not
    giving a fuck. It would be the ultimate hubris to assume that we'll react with anything other than a
    yawn to match.</p></div>"|6529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6529-caught-the-blast/|3.0|Michael Idov

Granted, as
    the evil genius behind some of the most inventive and unsettling hip-hop ever made, he's set the bar for
    rap producers to stratospheric heights-- it's a lot to live up to.  But when he followed his early
    masterpieces with a long torrent of trifling, sluggish and insufferably narcissistic material, the fans
    started wondering: What the hell happened?   The clearest explanation I've heard so far is that the RZA
    quite possibly went insane sometime around late '98, the year his superhero alter-ego Bobby Digital first
    appeared as the basis for a poorly conceptualized solo project.  The decline since then has been painful
    to witness, like a careening school bus plummeting over a precipice with screaming children inside.</p><p>
    
    When <i>Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers</i> appeared in '93, I was an instant, fanatical devotee.  I felt
    like I'd found in the RZA a kindred spirit who shared my love of dark, angry beats, Kung-Fu films, 40s,
    and hos with equal zest and abandon.  That I was a funny-looking white kid from the midwest made no
    difference.  GZA's <i>Liquid Swords</i>, Raekwon's <i>Only Built for Cuban Links</i>, ODB's <i>Return to
    the 36 Chambers</i>; for a couple of years the RZA could do no wrong.  But inevitably, he started slipping.
    Though still a strong release, <i>Wu-Tang Forever</i> had its share of question marks (""Black Shampoo""?),
    and <i>The Swarm</i>, a collection of songs featuring rappers mostly outside of the original <i>Enter</i>
    nucleus, was mostly a disaster with a few bright spots.  That, of course, was five years ago now, and by
    my count, seven albums.  And though there have been glimpses of his early genius and visionary lyrical
    style since (particularly songs like ""Lab Drunk"" and ""Brooklyn Babies"" on the otherwise dire Bobby Digital
    albums), they've always seemed like the last dying gasps of a wounded giant.</p><p>
    
    As if teasing us with the possibility of a dramatic rebirth, <i>Birth of a Prince</i> opens with a quiet,
    soulful sample of a woman singing, ""It's a new dawn/ It's a new day/ It's a new life for me.""  If only
    this were an appropriate precursor to the album and not just wishful thinking.  Still mired in the tired
    blaxploitation-era pathos of his most previous work, RZA adopts any number of interchangeable personas on
    the album-- from gun-toting revolutionary thug, to erudite religious humanist, to champion satisfier of
    female loins-- and sorting them all out quickly becomes tedious.  In direct contrast to these workalike
    personalities, the music is schizophrenically uneven.  Isaac Hayes-laden soul and funk riffs collide with
    80s hip-hop minimalism and 60s R&amp;B; crooning to create a fragmented, disorienting landscape of sound.  Add
    to that the RZA's dated off-tempo drums, deranged keyboards and slurred rhymes, and you come up just short
    of a muddled catastrophe.</p><p>
    
    ""Fast Cars"" offers a taste of the mind-numbing narcissism and affected gangsta banality to which the RZA
    has succumbed.  Over a dull, relentless beat, scattershot horns and what sounds like a squeaky toy piano,
    he warns, ""Gats burst off, thugs take their shirts off/ Five niggaz drop off before I got the verse off/
    Pop go the glock, wipe the fucking smirk off.""  As the chorus demonstrates, this is also the most inane
    homage ever recorded: ""We be ridin' fast cars/ Weed all in the glass jar/ Chrome on my crash bar.""  Even
    Ghostface can't help, as he recycles the same tired lines about Clark Wallabies, ice jewelry and brand
    new jeans we've heard since day one.</p><p>
    
    Ol' Dirty Bastard appears on ""We Pop"", yet another song about shooting glocks (the RZA's last solo album,
    <i>Digital Bullit</i>, featured an almost identical one called ""Glocko Pop""), but only sparingly on the
    chorus.  It has the same bass-laden beats and floating electronic strings of a 50 Cent song, but with none
    of the playful wit on its sing-songy chorus, ""We pop/ We brawl/ Get money to the day we fall/ My glock/
    My four/ Go shot through your bedroom door.""  And it goes on like that.  The 80s-infected ""Bob 'N I""
    recalls the minimal old-school production of Audio Two and early Marley Marl, but serves mainly as a
    forum for the RZA's nifty rhyme couplings, like ""cannon"" and ""Michael Landon,"" or ""defrost 'em"" and
    ""proceed with caution/ You'll get your beans baked in Boston.""  Which means nothing.</p><p>
    
    ""A Day to God Is 1000 Years"" is the RZA's obligatory per-album summing up of his confusing hodgepodge of
    pseudo-religious philosophies and political views.  Over a deep soul sample, he raps, ""Time couldn't end
    me/ Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me.../ I face my worldly challenge/ In the scale of
    justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral/ My respect for all men is mutual.""  Sometimes when I'm
    listening to the RZA's lyrics a line from Spinal Tap pops into my head: ""It's a thin line between clever
    and stupid.""  I wonder whether he could actually explain in non-illusory terms what, exactly, he believes
    in.</p><p>
    
    The RZA, with so much experience under his belt and insane expectations from his audience, carries the
    hulking burden of his past awkwardly.  But if nothing else-- and maybe this is denial, but-- <i>Birth of
    a Prince</i>, while a career low, doesn't feel like the last word.  RZA has yet to bounce back from his
    post-Wu slump, but I have the distinct feeling that, sooner or later, he will.  I just hope that when that
    time comes, I haven't completely lost interest.</p></div>"|6888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6888-birth-of-a-prince/|3.1|John O'Connor

    cigarettes; the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, chewing gum; Reggie &amp; The Full Effect, a slurpee doused with Skittles,
    Starbursts, and sugar packets.  For the uninitiated, Reggie is the, ahem, schizophrenic twin of Get Up
    Kids' piano man James DeWees.  He's surrounded by indie folklore and a suitable cloud of hype, which,
    like Reggie's earlier use of lo-fi recording techniques, attempts to obscure the shortcomings of previous
    efforts.  Not to worry: <i>Under the Tray</i> producer Ed Rose strips away that fuzz like a roofer in the
    Kansas City sun.</p><p>
    
    What's underneath?  Pure indulgence.  Whether it's the driving synth juice that kicks off ""Congratulations
    Smack + Katy"" or the Sprockets-esque bounce of ""Mood 4 Luv"", <i>Under the Tray</i> remains, for its entire
    duration, a bottomless fountain spewing the thickest imaginable cheese-pop.  Indeed, the physical need to
    stop Reggie from plodding past the two-minute mark, as he does on most of these songs, is difficult to
    ignore.  As novelty, this music is momentarily intriguing, but it quickly becomes monotonous, and its
    sonic intensity results in a dizzying sensory overload on all but a few songs.</p><p>
    
    Rose ups the ante on production of <i>Under the Tray</i>, as it slips out of the lo-fi sheath that covered
    <i>Promotional Copy</i>.  If DeWees and the 'Kids had responded with improved songwriting, <i>Under the
    Tray</i> might have emerged as a more captivating pop album; alas, Reggie is capable of no such effect.
    The guitars sound meaty, the drums spacey, and the keyboards twinkly, but the band's running on Equal,
    and when they finally burn out, it's not a pretty scene.  It actually only took two or three seconds for
    ""Apocalypse WOW!"" to begin pruning away my dendrites, and as ""Megan 2K2"" rolled through 2K3 and beyond,
    I began to wonder why Vagrant even keeps them on the roster-- and this is <i>Vagrant</i>, you guys.</p><p>
<i>Under the Tray</i>'s lyrics pull all the punches you'd expect: love, roses and ""posers.""  There are a
    few jokes floating around in the syrup, but I can't say I'd be caught dead dropping $14 to find them in
    this dreck.  I suppose one wouldn't expect The Get Up Kids to break out of their saccharine mold with
    this particular side-outing, but it's depressing to see such a dearth of inventiveness even after a band
    achieves instrumental competence-- if only through the accident of age.  I have a feeling Reggie and his
    mythic cabal will one day look back on this whole affair and wish they'd just stopped.</p></div>"|6742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6742-under-the-tray/|3.7|Noah Sutcliffe

    though time has stood still.  Since he let his folk jones shine through the gauze of guitar that enshrouded
    Slowdive's music, frontman Neil Halstead has drawn a steady stream of comparisons to everyone from Bob
    Dylan to Nick Drake.  Purely in terms of mood and atmosphere, Drake's more baroque work (think <i>Bryter
    Layter</i>) isn't that far off the mark, but beyond that, things get sticky.  Halstead simply isn't a
    singer/songwriter in the conventional sense: rather than relying on lyrics as a focal point, his music
    remains essentially texture-based, putting arrangements at the fore.</p><p>
    
    Halstead's knack for stunning arrangements is in top form on <i>Spoon &amp; Rafter</i>, and in this capacity,
    his music remains compelling, if no more or less than on any of his previous trilogy of Mojave 3 releases.
    As usual, Halstead's vocals remain calm and measured throughout the record, his sleepy tenor rarely ever
    rising above a murmur-- in fact, he more often recedes to a mere whisper. ""Billoddity"", as with any of the
    rest of the album's tracks, spotlights his relaxed vocal, but the song's arrangement is what makes this
    track pop: it's an upbeat number (by Mojave 3's standards, anyway), trotting on strummed guitars and a
    beat that calls to mind <i>Stoned &amp; Dethroned</i>-era Jesus &amp; Mary Chain.  But ""Battle of the Broken
    Hearts"" is the true centerpiece and standout, with quiet glockenspiel- and Theremin-adorned verses and
    head-bobbing choruses that bounce on piano and cello accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    One unfortunate change that does separate <i>Spoon &amp; Rafter</i> from other Mojave 3 albums is that
    angel-voiced bassist Rachel Goswell doesn't sing lead on a single track-- she's instead relegated entirely
    to background harmonies.  This has the adverse effect of highlighting the band's monochromaticity, though
    they do their best to make up for it with little flourishes like the Moogs that populate ""Tinker's Blues""
    or the banjo that turns up on closer ""Between the Bars"".  That last song has the most overt country feel
    of any song here, with a loping two-step, lonely harmonica and swelling pedal steel surrounding Goswell
    and Halstead's <i>Prairie Home Companion</i>-style harmonies.</p><p>
    
    Of course, at the end of the day, Mojave 3, while an appealing band, aren't so appealing that owning more
    than one of their albums is at all necessary.  If you're interested-- and any fan of Mazzy Star, Acetone,
    the Cowboy Junkies or others of that ilk probably has reason to be-- you're best off choosing one and
    ending it there.  <i>Spoon &amp; Rafter</i>, if mainly because of Rachel Goswell's decreased presence, isn't
    that album, although if you find it cheap, it's unlikely you'd be disappointed.</p></div>"|5378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5378-spoon-rafter/|6.6|Joe Tangari

    spin, I'm biting my nails, looking at Iggy's outstretched tongue in the liners to his latest, and wondering
    what happened to the guy.  To forestall the inevitable, I figure I ought to at least get my good friend
    Lou on the phone, get his opinion on the elder Mr. Pop; very few people know Ig better, after all.  I hit
    the speed-dial and wait; eventually the ringing stops, and with no word of greeting, only the icy breath
    coming through the receiver tells me he's on the line.</p><p>
    ""Howdy, Lou.""</p><p>
    ""What.""  Should be a question, sounds like a statement.</p><p>
    ""Just wondering if maybe you had a chance to listen to Iggy's latest album.  He probably sent you an
    advance, right?""</p><p>
    ""Iggy who?""</p><p>
    ""Pop.""</p><p>
    A pause.  ""Isn't he dead?""</p><p>
    ""Doctors tell me he's not.""</p><p>
    ""Have you listened to <i>Beat 'Em Up</i>?""  Clever guy, that Lou.  ""Naw, man, if he's still hangin' on, I guess
    I didn't get a copy of <i>Mood Ring</i>, but I struggled through his last couple, and I'll say again what I
    told Bangs about Iggy: If he'd listened to David [Bowie] or Me, if he'd asked questions every once in a
    while... I'd say, 'Man, just make a one-five change, and I'll put it together for you, and you can take all
    the credit.  It's so simple, but the way you're doin' it now you're just makin' a fool out of yourself.
    And it's just gonna get worse and worse...'  And this was in 1975.  Stop calling.""  Lou walked away from
    the receiver; his contempt hung it up.</p><p>
    1975: still two years prior to <i>The Idiot</i> and <i>Lust for Life</i>; Lou sure had that call wrong.
    Of course, Bowie was still working with Iggy in Berlin for those, and if Lou was predicting a messy
    post-Stooges, post-Bowie end for the guy, he wasn't too far off.  Still, I don't think he expected it
    would be dragged out across a handful of decades.  Having listened to him languish since the release of
    the canned, thinly veiled jock jams of his 1990 ""comeback"" <i>Brick by Brick</i> (and even further back
    than that, if you ask me, though at least that one had ""Candy"") hasn't been easy for his fans, but after
    being sent to the mat hard-- twice in a row-- with the misplaced world-rock of 1999's <i>Avenue B</i> and
    the hard rock of 2001's <i>Beat 'Em Up</i>, you keep hoping he'll stay down, for chrissakes.  At least on
    <i>Avenue B</i>, he failed while making a concerted effort to branch out away from the so-very-tired power
    chord cliches he'd been riding for years; <i>Beat 'Em Up</i> showed him crawling back, making his old-school
    rock ""xFC"" again, and failing at that, too.  If he can't even pull off ""tough"" anymore, what's left?</p><p>
    If the recent Peaches collaboration on her <i>Fatherfucker</i> doesn't prove that Ig's grasping at straws
    to attach himself to someone who approximates the controversy-driven ""nothing's sacred"" attitude he used
    to be known for, her contributions to <i>Skull Ring</i> ought to drive the point home.  I don't care about
    any mutual admiration, or who asked who; this is simply embarrassing.  The hypno-robotic buzz of ""Motor
    Inn"" might get the adrenaline flowing, but Iggy's desperate attempts at innuendo (""Her booty's got a rise/
    Soon my hands will be/ Where I'm putting my eyes"") make it hard to take seriously.  Similarly, Pop's cover
    of Peaches' ""Rock Show""-- especially the core ""rap""-- sounds stilted and forced, even with her conviction
    backing him up.  His cool-by-association dalliance with the newest icon of image-over-talent is too hard
    to swallow given his recent falterings; a third trip to the canvas should be a T.K.O.</p><p>
    But one look at Pop's grizzled, life-wracked frame proves he's resilient and ready to go down swinging.
    In fact, his perseverance in the face of self-created adversity is one of his most endearing qualities;
    it's hard to listen to ""Dum Dum Boys"" without a sympathetic ear to the various excesses of his time with
    The Stooges.  Speaking of: You've probably already heard that Ron and Scotty Asheton contribute to a few
    songs on this record, making it as close to an official Stooges reunion as anyone's likely to see.  And
    you know, they might've lost some of the breakneck tempo they once possessed, but the thin, treble-heavy
    grind of Ron's strings is still nearly as vicious now as it was then.  Compared to the over-compensatory
    grandstanding of the other bands backing up Iggy here-- The Trolls, Green Day (!), and perhaps by the hand
    of Satan himself, Sum 41-- The Stooges get by with nothing but rattling, smoldering vitriol.  Green Day (!)
    turn in a few notably driving riffs on ""Private Hell"", but the rest falls flat as overproduced, under-written,
    swaggering nonsense, as basic as rubbing three chords together.</p><p>
    Of course, the one truth that's remained unchanged since 1977 is that The Stooges ain't nothin' without
    the Pop, and as misfortune would have it, he's nowhere to be found on <i>Skull Ring</i>.  Sure, there's
    a guy singing who calls himself Iggy, but the similarities end at the name; like the drowned rat that he
    is, Iggy's fled this sinking ship and left a cantankerous shell to captain the wreckage.  I believe Iggy
    himself is back walking the mean streets of Detroit, living on the edge of the night in a never-ending
    replay of his psychotic days hanging with the MC5, trading his body heroin for blood, and spraying the
    exchange on the walls; his replacement for now and ever more is James Osterberg, an aging approximation of
    one of history's greatest all-time rock stars.</p><p>
    As recently as last album, Pop at least turned in a righteous snarl or two; here Osterberg sounds distant
    and lost.  He nearly rips off his very own ""Search and Destroy"" with the line, ""I'm the kid that no one
    knows/ I live a life I never chose,"" and in doing so sounds utterly defeated.  Iggy had a heart full of
    napalm; Osterberg is just cranky.  People can moan about how it's unfair to hold artists up to the magnitude
    of past accomplishments, and they're right.  But Stooges or not, this is a dismal, unengaging rock record
    by any standards-- one that absolutely wilts in the light of such past brilliance.  It might not be fair,
    but you know what, Iggy?  I still miss you.</p></div>"|6409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6409-skull-ring/|4.1|Eric Carr

    of <i>Funfair</i>. Later that year, Thrill Jockey released the more abstract and difficult <i>Scope</i>,
    and, for better or worse, all the root ideas of the many, many Takemura records that followed can be found
    in these two albums. Listening to <i>Funfair</i> upon its reissue and having absorbed <i>Hoshi No Koe</i>,
    <i>Sign</i>, <i>Water Suite</i>, <i>10th</i>, <i>Songbook</i> and <i>Assembler/Assembler 2</i>, I have to
    wonder: What the hell happened? How did this inventive artist, a guy who borrowed from post-techno IDM,
    pop, minimalism and 90s glitch and fashioned a readily identifiable and emotionally potent music of his
    own, come to turn out such inconsistent records mired in tedium?</p><p>
    Takemura's oddly prolific artistic stagnation comes in part from his inability to move on once he's
    developed an interested technique. <i>Funfair</i> contains early recorded examples of several ideas he
    would go on to explore <em>ad nauseam</em>. The opening ""The Cradle of the Light"", for example, an achingly
    beautiful track that sounds like a skipping musicbox, works from essentially the same source material as
    <i>Scope</i>'s ""Icefall"". This particular example of recycling never bothered me because the feel of the
    two tracks is so different. Where ""Icefall"" changes direction with a randomness that approaches violence,
    ""The Cradle of the Light"" is calm and serene, like a busted carousel speaker that continues to cycle
    through the same predictable but fascinating patterns. ""After Image"" comes later on <i>Funfair</i> but
    explores similar territory in terms of texture, and this time Takemura runs the simple bells through the
    shredder, creating an aural equivalent to a film that's lost its synchronization and flickers uncontrollably.</p><p>
    Shifting gears, ""Saburé"" is one of Takemura's first and best stabs at tinkertoy electropop. Takemura
    emphasizes his synthetic vibe and mini-Moog melodies with cartoonish jungle breakbeats, which, five
    years on, impart a quaintness that only enhances the light and playful tone. That ""Saburé"" also closes
    the album in a successful live cover version by The Dylan Group underscores Takemura's songwriting skill
    during this period. Absent his masterfully patched synths and chopped rhythms, ""Saburé"" still makes for a
    captivating instrumental rock piece (no mean feat, that). The Dylan Group's acoustic guitars and simple
    keyboards demonstrate that Takemura was actually writing riffs, and it's great to hear his digitized vibes
    translated into the rich, extended tones of the real thing. Around this time The Dylan Group was also
    covering Aphex Twin, proving how well flexible well-crafted IDM with hints of pop could be translated
    into a live setting.</p><p>
    The centerpiece of <i>Funfair</i> is the 15-minute ""Pendulum"". As she did on <i>Scope</i>'s ""Kepler"" and
    the earlier ""Wax &amp; Wane"", frequent Takemura collaborator Aki Tsuyuko offers her childlike voice to be
    looped and manipulated inside a forest of hypnotic Reichian percussion. ""Pendulum"" is its own world,
    however, slow, blurry, drugged and dreamy where the others are crisp and bright. Xylophone, bass clarinet
    and organ provide the main instrumental accompaniment, but the various vocal loops are what make the track.
    I've heard some people describe ""Pendulum"" as a piece of crushing sadness, but I hear something else inside
    it, a sense of wonder tinged with danger because it all sounds a bit <em>too</em> open and defenseless.
    ""Pendulum"" is one of the best two or three tracks Takemura has recorded, and probably one of my twenty
    favorites by anybody in the last five years.</p><p>
    Finally, there's ""Assi Que Dodo"" a more tuneful piece that seems a direct forbear to Takemura's
    <i>Songbook</i> experiments. Unlike the majority of <i>Songbook</i>, the melody on ""Assi Que Dodo""
    is on point, even if it's not good enough to justify the song's 12 minutes.  Of course, that this
    is the worst track says a lot about the overall quality of <i>Funfair</i>.  While all the Takemura
    records since have a least flashes of brilliance (particularly <i>Hoshi No Koe</i>), they also have far
    too many skipable tracks, and some are downright painful to sit through in their entirety.  But once
    upon a time his records were different.  With <i>Funfair</i>, Takemura knew how to make an album work,
    and sadly, he hasn't made a consistently great full-length since.</p></div>"|1729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1729-funfair/|8.5|Mark Richardson

Why, in 2003, does he pander to the sickeningly ironic? Why even attempt the self-referential, in a format so attractive to the indolent and trend-hungry that it's already been done there a thousand times before? And why, for Christ's sake, on the very website where all the earlier Pitchfork scavengers at least reached postmodernism's corpse before it was just the dry, greasy bones being artlessly propped up here.  These supposed ""journeys"" into the writers creative mind (where, as even Joyce wrongly thought, we apparently think without correct punctuation) are as uninsightful and lame as diaryish writing-about-writing can be, and a truly awful dramatic exercise between forgotten early-90s novelty rappers ""Kid'N'Play"" comes off as wholly unmoving even under the low, ironic standards of this sort of dialogue. Honestly, why do it?? Is he flailing in the ultimate impotence of the worried music critic, cowardly preempting his own inevitable criticism?? Is he that much in love with the ugly mental voice of his own feeble writing process that he feels he must proudly share it with us all, instead of actually working to produce coherent journalism? Or, as I suspect is probably the case, is he simply incapable of any coherent product, unable to produce anything in the proper, accepted form, and so resorts to this self-satisfied mishmash of uninformed genre dabbling and faux-confession. Perhaps the author believes that in the present enviroment of near-inescapable postmodernist criticism he can provide some definitive statement by reheating that same old dish once more, but the horse having been long-dead already doesn't make one's self-conscious flogging any more interesting.

If you're reading now, and thinking about becoming a music writer for Pitchfork or anywhere else, my only advice (after ""just don't"") would be: Always Write About Yourself. Go on!! Write about how you're writing that review, about how your bitchy editor doesn't understand you, about the media format of the website or free weekly or whatever. If the article is due that night, write about the tail of the ""Q"" in the fucking font on your word processor. Make up terrible dialogues between characters and have them repeat discussions you had earlier that day. Why do I suggest this?  Because I'm not a real writer.</p><p>  P: Did I tell you I saw Marcus downtown today?<br/> K: No, oh...

    bands as Beulah and every band Sasha Bell ever joined, content to simply emulate those they admired.
    Dawdling in what heartier music fans might affectionately call ""puss-rock,"" Ashley Park doused their
    second album in barrelfuls of feyness, sullenness, aloofness, and non-alcoholic white wine.  Their new
    album, <i>The Secretariat Motor Hotel</i>, dispenses with those rather poorly advised excursions into
    baroque, synth, and general Kindercore pop, and makes a full-length out of <i>American Scene</i>'s ""The
    Last Day in the Life of Grand"".</p><p>
    What this means for the average listener can be easily summarized: This is the most startlingly stereotypical
    alt-country I've ever heard. So to felicitate this review, I decided to theorize a song representing every
    song on this album that, for the sake of convenience, I shall christen ""It Looks Like the Farm's Horses Are
    Mighty Solitary in the Cosmos, Old Man Tuckerson"" (this would not be the most ridiculous title on the album).
    I stole this paragraph from the rough draft of my <i>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</i> review. I apologize for
    not writing a new one, but I got a hot date:</p><p>
    ""It Looks Like..."" is a meandering ramble hidden in dewed bales of hay and rugged mounds of desert clay.
    Oaken guitars tortuously wrangle cattle, while the detached, conversational vocals circulate messages
    roughly equivalent to ""I am always alone, except when in a passionate embrace with the woman I love even
    when she occasionally leaves me."" The atmosphere of the production is a damp ditch in a trail leading to
    a snowy tavern. The songs are as exuberantly melodic as the performers are eerily disconsolate. It's the
    soundtrack to lives persecuted by society and befriended by airy pastures, families with straw on their
    backs, hail in their roofless bedrooms, sorrow in their consciences, and jubilance in their everyday lives.</p><p>
    I understand that sounds sarcastic, but that's more the fault of my inability to be sincere than any
    specific vindictiveness on my part. There's nothing inherently wrong with music that fits the above
    description.  Hell, that review might as well be applied to the state of Vermont.  It's one of those
    albums that's already present in everyone's consciousnesses, where you already know the direction of
    every chorus and the placement of every slide guitar solo. It adds and detracts nothing to the formula
    while being intended as little more than homage to a genre. The songs are rarely differentiated.
    Occasionally, some organs will slide under the dejected mood or Kelly Haigh's back-up vocals will become
    more prominent, but, for the most part, this may as well be one endearingly slothful 40-minute track.</p></div>"|316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/316-the-secretariat-motor-hotel/|7.1|Alex Linhardt

    Elevator is little more than an emancipated version of Benson's backing band, the Well-Fed Boys.  This
    is more than just another subtle experiment in power shifts, though-- the three-year old band is the
    product of Benson and songwriter Chris Plum's long-standing high school friendship, a rapport reignited
    in Detroit in 2000, on the heels of Benson's trying <i>One Mississippi</i> sessions.</p><p>
    
    With his own brand new home studio, built on Virgin Records advance dollars, Benson offered to record and
    produce a handful of Plum's songs; from this, Mood Elevator (with bassist Eric Potts, drummer Matt Aljian,
    and guitarist Zach Shipp) was born.   A few short months later, the group's debut LP, <i>Listen Up!</i>,
    was released. (Perpetuating pesky Detroit in-breeding, Shipp has since bowed out of Mood Elevator to
    become Electric Six bandmember ""The Colonel."")  When Benson was asked to select a backing band to accompany
    him on his <i>Lapalco</i> tour last year, Mood Elevator was his obvious choice, and the group took on a
    new name, performing behind Benson as the Well-Fed Boys.</p><p>
    
    With Mood Elevator proper, Benson chipped in rhythm guitar, percussion, and a few lilting vocal harmonies,
    but generously forked over the leading-man post to Plum, whose deep, clear coo functions kind of like a
    funhouse version of Benson's: a little more raucous, but still perpetually on-key and curiously adolescent.
    Over half of the album sees just Plum and Benson credited as players, and their balanced push/pull interplay
    instantly reveals the well-rooted relationship from which the project sprouted.</p><p>
    
    Mostly, <i>Married Alive</i> offers a slightly rowdier version of Benson's beloved pop/rock, a hybrid foot-tapper
    with more drum fills and distortion, but not quite as much beguiling charm. Whereas Benson's solo charisma
    has always been inextricably handcuffed to his genuine, sweet-faced whine, Mood Elevator's choice to skew
    a little rockier (read: big, Keith Moon-ish percussion and a splattering of expletives) has also cost the
    band its potentially appealing innocence.  Still, Benson and Plum are both skilled songwriters, and each
    of this album's eleven tracks are carefully scribed, hook-riddled pop shouts, occasionally generic but
    always well-accessorized.</p><p>
    
    As its title suggests, <i>Married Alive</i> is also full of goofy, locker-room heartbreak, with loads of
    exasperating lyrics about doing dumb shit in the name of love: looking the word ""baby"" up in the dictionary
    (""It always seemed to me/ A baby is supposed to be someone/ Who really loves you"") or nobly lamenting your
    shortcomings (""Anxious, anxious kind of guy/ I'm no longer cool/ I no longer rule"").  The instrumentation
    follows suit: the Beach Boys-inspired summertime slinger ""Long Hard Look"" ties golden keyboard lines to
    singalong harmonies and rolling guitars, while ""Something I Need"" offers even more vocal frolicking, with
    Benson and Plum vigorously trading off sunny witticisms.</p><p>
<i>Married Alive</i>'s liner notes feature a capitalized decree laid out in big gray letters: ""Love Breaks
    Your Heart.""  It's age-old pop sentiment, true but irksomely familiar, unspecific, and ultimately unaffecting.
    This record is a testament to Plum and Benson's obvious capacity (see any of Benson's work with the Well-Fed
    Boys) for melody and harmony, but in the end, its songs are about as earth-shattering as its lyrical agenda.</p></div>"|5559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5559-married-alive/|6.4|Amanda Petrusich

This album is not a ""classic.""  As a
    member of that crucial demographic that has outlived Keats but not Jesus, I can understand why young'uns
    might consider <i>Logic Will Break Your Heart</i> poetic while the oldies find it miraculous. But those
    of us aged 27-32 have been thoroughly banged around by rock history revisions, fluctuations in irony,
    surrogate nostalgia, genre inbreeding, genre crossbreeding, and the pursuit of cool-- we've grown up
    inside a pasticheteria, so we know that The Stills are what The Posies were in their day, and what The
    Libertines were a few minutes ago: stuck in a phantom zone called ""not there yet,"" and possibly because
    the personalities of their influences eclipse any sense of identity they could muster. The Stills are a
    complicated case, though, inspiring equal amounts of pleasure and horror, like that dream in which everyone
    has mozzarella genitals.</p><p>
    
    Speaking of dreams, didn't you want to believe the hype that this would be the album equivalent of what
    the film <i>Donnie Darko</i> was, a thrilling amalgam of eightiesness?  The movie comprehensively homaged
    its forebears, dreaded its Republicans, and imaginatively conveyed the eerie and tragic. The Stills take
    some big cues from <i>Darko</i>'s soundtrack standouts Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, The Church, and Joy Division,
    but their retro arrangements, percussive guitar work, and ""big"" cavernous production have been beaten to
    the market by too many other bands, among them Interpol, The Organ, and several of those post-P.I.L.,
    disco-bassline-abusing, Sly-and-the-Family-Stroke ""dancepunks.""  The album does contain some fascinatingly
    elliptical ""political"" material, most notably ""Lola Stars and Stripes"" and ""Let's Roll"", which begins, if
    I can figure out Tim Fletcher's oversexed slur: ""Lie on the floor of the runway, babe, then/ Wait for the
    ride/ We'll have a comfortable flight/ Don't be afraid to be afraid here with me."" This post-boxcutter
    tune goes on to discuss plunging into wormholes, providing a ""fanciful"" take on the terror-war kickoff,
    and furthering the <i>Donnie Darko</i> connections. (The song definitely outperforms Neil Young's ""Let's
    Roll"", which is karmically funny, considering that a barrage of CSN&amp;Y; is what comes up when one seeks
    file-sharers for ""Stills."")</p><p>
    
    And about Tim Fletcher: he is the rare singer who is too proficient. This indie-rock Streisand is perfectly
    modulated throughout the album: guttural Bowie here, castrati Coldplay there, to the point that one never
    buys his band's rapturous lyrics. Straightjacketed by overproduction, no amount of Reagan-jangle lends him
    the requisite gone-daddy-gone-ness.</p><p>
    
    And about that hit single: ""Still in Love Song"" is, of course, protectively and cynically titled, since
    the song repeats ""still in love"" as many times as our gubmint barks ""weapons o' mass destruction"" in hopes
    that we memorize and internalize it (sigh, at the illogic of patriotism breaking ones' heart). This old
    Motown technique confirms that the song ""bumps,"" but denies it ""tha bomb"" status, especially since it's
    a bait-and-switch considering the rest of the album's non-club sound. What makes matters more desperate
    is that ""Still in Love Song"" was already released on the band's debut EP, and will probably appear on
    their sophomore LP as ""I Still Know You're in Love Last Summer"" and later it will be their only entry
    on <i>Cheney Beat!</i>, the future K-tel compilation of hits from our epoch. When the chorus goes from
    minor to major during the breakdown, you can hear God's hernia acting up.</p><p>
    
    In his recent book <i>The Middle Mind</i>, novelist Curtis White decries post-modern pluralism as the horny
    hypocrite that it is, and too often, The Stills try to commandeer a three-way between their savvy, their
    dopeyness, and their savvily dopey pop heritage. See their song titles: you get compelling poetry such
    as ""Gender Bombs"" and ""Yesterday Never Tomorrows"", cliches such as ""Ready for It"" and ""Love and Death"",
    and insider references such as ""Of Montreal"" and ""Allison Krausse"". (<i>The Middle Mind</i>'s perfect work
    of art: eighties pastiche <i>Blue Velvet</i>, about the banality of evil, the banality of good, and the
    banality of banality.)</p><p>
    
    BEST SONG: ""Animals and Insects"", by far. The only number that flirts with both lo-fi production and
    Schneider TM-style eclecto-rash, this track thanks The Cure for their <i>Seventeen Seconds</i> drum
    stylings and even lends a gorgeous melodrama to the sororitese mantra ""oh my god."" Did I mention that
    the ditty is about mass murder? When those drums explode, I'm like, brainwash me, you Canadian New
    Yorkers! Teach me to shoegaze, because this eye-level perspective shit is not working out!</p><p>
    
    CREEPINESS: Too many of these tracks would work in a fitness center, between Bon Jovi's ""It's My Life"" and
    The Fabulous Thunderbirds' ""Tuff Enuff"", as we vain flexers unwillingly act out slave-ship scenes from
    <i>Ben-Hur</i> on the cardio modules.</p><p>
    
    Haters hear pop/punk and decry The Stills as an Alkaline Quartet deserving of a slot on the Pizza Hut
    jukebox. The band's 9-11 stuff might be better than Portastatic's nasal wimpout <i>Summer of the Shark</i>,
    but I still say that liking The Stills would be like sleeping with a Frankenpartner made out of one's past
    lovers. Boo. Hiss. Give us Barabbas! Give us Dukakis! Damn, I hope this <i>Perfect Strangers</i> shirt is
    cool. Who you calling hipster, hipster?</p></div>"|7718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7718-logic-will-break-your-heart/|5.1|William Bowers

    southern folk aesthetic and kicking up a Tobacco Road dustcloud on the way. Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor's
    sterile, skeletal song structures are a little better fed and fleshed out this time around, chartering
    thin rays of hope like sacks of turnips enterprisingly stolen with desperation's iron grip. The carpenters
    of change are twofold: newly arresting manipulations of electronic elements interlock with the duo's
    traditional organic fare, as well as bolder and sharper production approaches by longtime producer Eric
    ""Crooked Fingers"" Bachmann.</p><p>
    
    The first three tracks slide in smoothly, showcasing drum programming, dexterous electronic measures, and
    textured arrangements-- all, of course, still very much shadowed by Fink and Taylor's sleepy harmonies.
    Their vocals remain the centerpiece of the mixture, tenderly wrapping around each other like weathered
    fingers on praying hands, and they retain the maudlin and enchanting tone of the duo's previous work even
    amongst more ambitious and adventurous routes.  Elements that were once relied upon solely-- gentle piano,
    lazy acoustic guitar, sparse percussion-- are now accompanied, and sometimes overshadowed, by Azure Ray's
    new evocative sonic conviction.  ""New Resolution"" even rocks a little, in a tiny electronic symphony sort
    of way, and the mid-album track ""If You Fall"" is downright animated, curiously parallel in tone to the
    work of labelmates Rilo Kiley.</p><p>
    
    The duo's strength, though, remains the plaintive, tearful moments they so longingly craft. ""We Are Mice"",
    ""The Drinks We Drank Last Night"", and ""Hold on Love"" are highlights-- serene, direct vehicles for the duo's
    vocal prowess, albeit with a little less murkiness and a sharp sense of innovation. ""Look to Me"" plays on
    delicate falling-rain acoustic guitar with uneasy resignation.  ""These Bright Lights Will Bend to Make
    Blue"" also creeps alluringly, perfectly cradling tones of cautious hope within.  The lyrics are a bit
    thin, but its rarely an issue given the beauty of the voices that carry them.  I could, of course, do
    without more than one song delineating ""pain inside,"" but if it came down to sacrificing the message or
    the messengers, the choice would be clear-cut.</p><p>
    
    This is a band best served by straight lines, as is perfectly exemplified on roughly half this album,
    when they allow quiet hints of hope to belie a simple deployment of sentiment.  Unfortunately, <i>Hold
    on Love</i>'s more serene moments only weaken the lure of their more intricate and involved songs,
    ultimately underscoring the group's true strengths.   As such, <i>Hold on Love</i> goes down in the
    books as their shiniest, though half-reflective, work to date.</p></div>"|401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/401-hold-on-love/|6.5|William Morris

Fashion rather curiously caught Andrew Bird in
    its current in the mid-90s, as he became erroneously linked to the regrettable neo-swing movement via his
    violin contributions to the Squirrel Nut Zippers, a band who I maintain were themselves unfairly lumped in
    with a movement that they largely transcended.  The fact is, Bird's music, both as an accomplice to the
    Zippers and with his own band, Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, has never really fit with any kind of trend,
    and he's better off for it-- what he winds up with on each of his albums is always hard to pinpoint and
    frequently possesses a timeless quality that only a select few recordings ever manage.</p><p>
    
    You have to appreciate novelty and cabaret humor to get into Bird's first two albums, <i>Thrills</i> and
    <i>Oh! The Grandeur!</i>  Those records channeled the parlor music of the 20s along with Berthold Brecht
    and Django Reinhardt to create a pastiche so effective it might as well have been the real thing.  But
    two years ago, Bird branched out on the stunning <i>Swimming Hour</i>, basically a sonic time capsule for
    the 20th century that loaded everything from American mountain folk and jump blues to straight-up rock and
    roll and orchestral pop into a single, masterful casing.  If there had ever been any doubt that Bird wasn't
    tied to the neo-swing scene, <i>The Swimming Hour</i> killed it swiftly.</p><p>
    
    With <i>Weather Systems</i>, Bird's first record without the Bowl of Fire moniker on the sleeve, he's
    managed to synthesize his myriad influences to the point where you can't hear any of them distinctly
    anymore.  These nine tracks, written at Bird's rural Illinois barn studio, hint at broad American musical
    traditions without being tied directly to any of them.  A stripped down backing band consisting of Nora
    O'Connor on backing vocals and guitar, Kevin O'Donnell on drums and Mark Nevers on ""space guitar"" keeps
    things fairly simple, allowing Bird to shape the sound with his vocals and truly amazing violin playing.</p><p>
    
    Bird is easily one of the best violinists ever to devote himself to popular music (as opposed to, say,
    Shostakovich), as his palette of sounds on the instrument is so broad here that it's sometimes slow to
    dawn that you're hearing a bow on strings.  He weaves intricate layers of pizzicato skittering and legato
    texture everywhere, turning himself into a small orchestra to create a series of beautiful, well-considered
    arrangements for his songs.  ""First Song"" rolls in like dust off the plains, with Bird whistling a loopy
    spaghetti-Western fanfare, while his fingerstyle violin plucking slowly creates a rich bed for his and
    O'Connor's harmonies.  The deliciously evil ""I"" shatters the pastoral mood, though, as Bird's dissonant
    violin arrangement includes some strings pitch-shifted to sound like demon cellos and O'Connor's guitar
    sputtering like a dying gunshot victim.  The vocal melody floats uneasily amidst the drones, and it takes
    a second to realize just how little Bird is using to create one of the most sinister songs I've heard all
    year.</p><p>
    
    ""Lull"" bobs on O'Donnell's brushed drums and Bird's lilting violin ostinatos, with verses that develop like
    something off of Paul Simon's <i>Graceland</i>, retaining the basic shape of the melody, but inserting
    subtle substitutions in phrasing to keep you surprised.  The loose male/female harmonies sound so natural
    and unstaged that this could be two people singing together anywhere, just passing time.  The barebones
    cover of The Handsome Family's ""Don't Be Scared"" is so full of ache and longing it sounds like he wrote
    it himself.</p><p>
    
    The disc closes its too-brief runtime (nine songs in just over half an hour) with an untitled instrumental
    that slyly reprises the violin undercarriage of ""Lull"" while spinning a brief keyboard melody nicked from
    the beginning of ""Don't Be Scared"" into a full-on rhapsody of swelling violin while O'Donnell pounds away
    on what sound like kettle drums in the background.  If you close your eyes and turn it up loud enough,
    it feels like you're levitating.  That Bird can stand this far out in leftfield and still make music so
    colossally affecting is what makes him one of my favorite current artists.  It's quite possible that
    neo-swing's flash-in-the-pan also constituted Bird's 15 minutes of fame, and that's a damn shame, because
    this is music for the ages that demands to be heard.</p></div>"|713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/713-weather-systems/|8.3|Joe Tangari

    is altogether lost on me, and though I'd rather not think too intently on where it would have registered
    with me at fourteen (I just flat out don't trust myself, to be honest), I'm wholly out of this band's target
    audience nearly ten years thereafter.  Not to mention, newly down on the hollow plight of today's pubescent
    youths-- or at least the sort of music they can get their hands on.</p><p>
    
    All ten songs from <i>Summer Fling</i> fall neatly within the confines of a Jimmy Eat World to Saves the
    Day enclave, with some synth-peppered Rentals textures looming portentously on the territorial outskirts.
    Crunchy three-chord pop/punk guitars ride kid-safe emotional rollercoaster dynamics through brimming-thick
    and baseline/vocal-thin.  The formula features a sort of sing-by-committee affair that sometimes forgivingly
    uses three-part harmonies to drown out the nasal lead vocal mewling.  ""Wishful Thinking"" adds a little more
    punch to the mix, and the requisite acoustic lamentation ""I Want To"" ventures into shallow Get Up Kids tide
    pools, but for the most part, these songs are unabashedly linear.</p><p>
    
    The packaging even features a notebook-styled lyric book, filled with playful and lovelorn margin doodling,
    Polaroid pics of the band making funny faces, and handwritten lyrics-- five pages of: ""I've got a pocket
    full of secrets/ No one knows what I keep in it,"" ""Are you that far away from me that you'd forget about
    the time we watched the sunrise from my car/ And you woke up in my arms?"" (Curfews?! Anyone?), ""Tell
    everyone I'm chasing the sun/ 'Cause I can't wait for summer.""  Everything above serves to remind me:
    There's a damn good reason I've conveniently/permanently misplaced my own high school poetry.</p><p>
    
    These fine young men may well be the sort guys you'd one day want your daughter to bring home from college;
    innocent, well-intentioned, and musically inclined-- but when I have kids I don't want to find this sort of
    album lying around the house, or, God forbid, hear it blaring from upstairs while I'm trying to organize my
    compact disc collection.</p></div>"|6900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6900-summer-fling/|3.0|William Morris

    assaulting record stores nationwide, the massive Hieroglyphics collective was busy helping to shape the
    lyric-intensive west coast underground style and rising to prominence on the independent circuit.  More
    than ten years on from their first recordings, the lineup still intimidates: Casual, Del Tha Funkee
    Homosapien, Souls of Mischief, Pep Love, and Domino.</p><p>
<i>Full Circle</i>, their first full-length together since 1998's <i>Third Eye Vision</i>, shows them
    still aggressively tackling concepts like the nature of their former and current sales capacity (""One
    Hundred Thousand Indi""), disenchantment with authority figures (""Powers That Be"") and the trials and
    tribulations of the typical Hiero tour date (""Chicago""). Most prominently, the boys elaborate on
    intellectual rap braggadocio (""Catch me with a group of babes, stunting like Super Dave"") and expound
    upon common rap clichés (money, cars, wack rappers, females, weed) with a street-smart looseness and
    rhyming proficiency reminiscent of late Freestyle Fellowship. Although it conflicts with their former
    anti-commercial mindstate, it still works due to the charismatic and lyrical status of the flow
    magistrates in question.</p><p>
    Where most emcees talk of women in the context of their groupies or trifling significant others, a stark
    moment on <i>Full Circle</i> comes with the masterful narrative ""Maggie May"". Over a subtle drum arrangement,
    light upright bass plucks and a depressive trumpet sample, the collective delivers a eulogy for a fallen
    friend, each Hiero head detailing their own connection to the nominal character with a verse about her
    descent in the face of drugs and prostitution. Their differing lyrical approaches apply variety to the
    topic, along with interesting views and tight rhyme schemes. Each rapper writes from a different time in
    her devolution, from Opio rooming with her during college to Del declining her sexual advances in the
    prime of her promiscuity to Tajai running into her as a strung-out cokehead. Narratives don't manage to
    work on both technical and conceptual levels very often, but in a stunning return to form, the triple-eyed
    alliance emerges with what could stand as a modern classic.</p><p>
    Those expecting the same basic sample piling that made <i>93 'Til Infinity</i> and <i>Fear Itself</i> such
    classics should be prepared for a shock. More along the lines of Del's production on his own <i>Both Sides
    of the Brain</i> (and to a lesser extent, Casual's on <i>He Think He Raw</i>), Domino, A-Plus and Casual
    have seemingly cleaned up their beats, opting for the sophisticated bombast of synthetic instrumentation
    and a far more subtle sampling style. Unexpectedly, their collective production prowess works admirably,
    from the sluggish Timbaland-esque glitch-hop of ""Heatish"" to the chopped Venice strings and tavern keys
    of ""Shift Shape"" to the frantic rattle-and-strum and funky drumming of ""Chicago"".</p><p>
    In the stone face of evolution, the Hiero crew do stagger somewhat with a lack of conceptual depth: the
    classic simplicity of beats that marked their previous outings has faded, there are a handful of repetitive
    tracks (""Fantasy Island"", ""Let It Roll""), and, with the exception of his strong conviction on ""7 Sixes"",
    former asset Del totally sleepwalks through the record.  But even in the presence of bad decision-making,
    the point is made: Hieroglyphics remain ever relevant in the rapidly changing world of underground rap.</p></div>"|3970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3970-full-circle/|7.2|Rollie Pemberton

    umbrella over ambient indie popsters who use delicate electronic melodies to convey the wistful yet
    wounded sensations that were once frequently articulated by jangly guitars and boy/girl vocals. Nitsuh
    gathered half of the Morr Music roster, Solvent, and Ulrich Schnauss, among others, and made them
    compatriots in a sort of un-named movement of bedroom electronica-- a marriage of indie sentiment and
    sensibility with sleepy laptop-driven melodies.</p><p>
    
    In one sense, the Junior Boys fit here as well. On the EP's two vocal tracks, ""Birthday"" and ""Last Exit"",
    singer Jeremy Greenspan's fragile vocals relay lovelorn lyrics soaked in indie's too-familiar, almost
    inevitable cycle of pain and resignation. ""Take all this weight behind me/ And let it go,"" he pleads on
    ""Birthday"", trying to come to grips with rejection and strip himself of some of its debilitating weight.
    And yet, in another more engaging and encouraging sense, Junior Boys don't fit that lap-pop model <i>at
    all</i>. Pigeonholing Junior Boys amongst most of those artists negates their considerable command of more
    complex rhythms, as well as their grasp of dance and avant-pop traditions.</p><p>
    
    Sonically, Junior Boys have condensed a large group of very apparent touchstones from (deep breath)
    Timbaland's icier more futurist production work to the texture and syncopation of two-step pioneers such
    as Todd Edwards and Dem 2 to the shimmer of early 80s synth-pop to Basic Channel's blissful tech-dub. In
    the process, they've created an alchemic sound that, after only one EP, is both identifiable and unique.</p><p>
    
    Of the EP's other three songs, the graceful romanticism of ""Birthday"" spills over to ""Last Exit"", seven
    minutes of swoon and sigh, dance grooves and bedsit mournfulness, in which Greenspan whispers things like
    ""you make me feel more than real"" over a heart-tugging shiver of sound. The instrumental ""Unbirthday""
    echoes the ghosts of a scrum between Herrmann &amp; Kleine's ""Kickboard Girl"", Rhythm &amp; Sound, and dubstep.
    And the EP closes with possibly its most immediately striking track, a Fennesz remix of ""Last Exit"". The
    Austrian star leaves the track's pop heart intact and offers it a series of trembling electroshocks.</p><p>
    
    Despite that accomplished second half of the record, it's those two vocal tracks that nicely highlight the
    band's strength: effortlessly bleeding their songcraft into groove and rhythm, creating a delicate sculpture
    of broken dreams and beats. Sure, plenty of glitch or tech-house pioneers have tried the same in recent
    years, but they've mostly rushed arms wide open to disco-pop, swinging swiftly from clicks and cuts to
    digital disco. Surprisingly-- until this EP-- only Coloma and Vladislav Delay's Luomo project have
    attempted to bridge that gulf and position themselves somewhere between those two poles with any success.
    In an odd way, then, it's those three (Junior Boys, Coloma, Luomo)-- each of whom sound far less like the
    most frequently resurrected memories of ""80s music""-- that best capture the elegance and sophistication
    in some of that decade's synth-pop.</p><p>
    
    I almost hesitate to even mention <i>that</i> decade because the inherently selective nature of revivalism
    already gives specific connotations to anything that is either electronic or reminiscent of the 1980s. But
    never mind the prevailing cycle of today's nostalgia. Junior Boys don't come across like the more synthetic,
    decadent end of electroclash. Instead, they trade in the slightly scuffed sheen of the decade's more
    heartfelt soundscapes, delivering tracks for the day after the disco-- soundtracks to mental slideshows
    of good times, the paradoxically cold reality of daylight, and the potential pain of wondering how soon
    is now.</p></div>"|4339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4339-birthday-ep/|8.5|Scott Plagenhoef

    appellation.  By referencing the Alaskan hinterland, the Richmond, Virginia quartet connects itself
    to 6,000,000+ acres of Denali National Park, a sub-arctic ecosystem that includes Mount McKinley along
    with a bunch of frostbitten grizzly bears. Like listening to the earliest Codeine while mired in a
    snowstorm, this vast chunk of ice, mountains, and large mammals is the apt environmental backdrop for
    the nine dramatically sweeping songs on <i>The Instinct</i>, Denali's follow-up to their self-titled debut.</p><p>
    
    In spite of these references to cold things, Denali are most addictive when gritting their collective teeth
    and churning out a tapestry of jarring guitars, heavy bass, complex percussion rhythms, and synthesizer
    harmonics.  The lynchpin operatic ballast of guitarist and keyboardist Maura Davis remains the critical
    focus, but her band solidly provides an ideal cushion for a vocal style that could grow obnoxious within
    a more staid or less fitting context. Evoking a cleaner PJ Harvey with zero Galas bluster (is that a female
    Thom Yorke?  A 4AD diva?), Davis hits the high notes and tackles her vocal lines with aplomb.  While her
    voice is impressive, she doesn't have much of a story to tell.  This works well enough if she's taken as
    another instrument in the dense sonic squall, but once the lyric sheet comes out of hiding, well, uh, um.</p><p>
    
    Including a fair share of these revved-up glacial formations, <i>The Instinct</i> shows a promising turn
    towards heavier, denser slices of chamber-rock.  Davis's older brother, bassist/keyboardist Keeley Davis,
    is in Engine Down with drummer Jonathan Fuller, who earlier played in old-school chaos makers Sleepytime
    Trio. Rounding out the lineup is journeyman guitarist Cam DiNunzio of Four Walls Falling and a dozen other
    east coast floor-punching acts. With these guys in tow, a certain heaviness lurks within the trip-hop:
    tracks like ""Hold Your Breath"" and ""Surface"" initiate insouciant percussive breaks and rock-up dynamics
    similar to the work of Girls Against Boys or old timey London-based Touch &amp; Go heavies, Silverfish (""Hips
    Tits Lips Power!"").</p><p>
    
    ""Surface"", meanwhile, fixates around a stealthy bassline, dual-channel percussion separations,
    and a multi-layered careening guitar: during the final distorted vocal exchange, Davis' not especially
    interesting lyrics come off like holy writ because of where they're placed in the mix. To his credit,
    Peter Katis, who recorded other frosted bands like Interpol and Mercury Rev, sustains this well-chosen
    lushness for the album's duration, creating a site in which dappled arpeggios and aquatic notes pulse and
    flow three-dimensionally.</p><p>
    
    When forging ahead with pretty disjunctions, Denali offer a solid take on a less traversed genre; as the
    band nods-off to dumbed-down Portishead-styled atmospherics, the propulsion dissipates. Bits like ""Run
    Through"", ""Nullaby"", and ""Welcome"" could make for fair-to-decent background music, but each lacks the
    payoff of the other work.  Despite the production and sonic sweep, this is a standard rock band working
    within an oft-stated, faux-experimental dream-pop realm. For actual extended grooves and smacked-out
    excursions, I'd rather tap the epic drones of the Kompakt roster, Ellen Allien, or maybe just record the
    wind at Mount McKinley and see if it sounds at all like I think it would.</p></div>"|2277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2277-the-instinct/|7.2|Brandon Stosuy

    excruciatingly well-documented rural roots.  Occasionally, though, a contemporary rock outfit will
    faithfully resurrect not just the now-ubiquitous 12-bar noodle, but also the coy, shifty-eyed spirit
    of the original blues, simultaneously employing skeleton cover art, cornbread mantras, and goofily
    enigmatic aliases.</p><p>
    
    The Black-Eyed Snakes, the unlikely side project of Low's Alan Sparhawk, have wisely shied away from
    the puttering, voodoo blues schtick that made their 2001 debut, <i>It's the Black-Eyed Snakes</i>, play
    like pure masquerade.  The members have, however, dutifully retained their cheeky blues pseudonyms (Alan
    Sparhawk continues to appear as ""Chicken-Bone George""), and a biography that reads like bad Toni Morrison
    (""OK, these ain't your mother and daddys Black-Eyed Snakes.  Best tell everyone: things changed."")  But
    <i>Rise Up!</i> is, at least sonically, a considerably less gimmicky effort than its predecessor, far
    more concerned with capturing the unquestionable ecstasy of riffing than with showcasing quasi-ironic
    posturing.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>Rise Up!</i> transgresses, rather than regurgitates, knee-jerk blues formula; The Black-Eyed
    Snakes' brand of ""blues"" is just as informed by the energy and ethos of punk and garage rock as it is by
    the infamous Delta triumvirate of God/whiskey/women. And while blues-meets-punk is exceptionally well-tread
    ground in 2003 (see: Jon Spencer, Black Keys, etc.), the Snakes' brew tends to skew a bit dirtier, incorporating
    a backwards folk ambiance that's less reminiscent of The White Stripes than Califone: check ""Soggy"" Tim
    Rutili manning the slide on three tracks, or notice how the deft maraca opening of ""Hillside Stomp"" makes
    you think Brian Deck is lurking in the back of the room.</p><p>
    
    There's also the issue of Sparhawk's alter-ego: If the experience of listening to Low approximates the
    aching sublimity of freezing to death, spinning the Black-Eyed Snakes is akin to bursting into flame.
    Sparhawk's vocals-- so peaceably docile when tumbling along with Low-- are painfully distorted here, and
    their new, dressed-up gurgle is deliberately misleading, much like Sparhawk's nickname; Sparhawk seems
    intent on keeping his respective projects wholly distinct (coyly cloaking both his real name and his real
    pipes), preemptively striking out at anyone eager to accuse him of wild Dr. Jeckylisms.  Consequently, the
    Black-Eyed Snakes and Low remain superficially incomparable.  Still, both employ an impressive sense of
    emancipation, of classic build-and-release structure, always see-sawing between the unlistenable and the
    sublime.</p><p>
    
    ""Rise Up!"" opens the record with an exclamation-pointed promise of insurgence, and promptly offers an
    appropriate soundtrack: unpolished, heavily distorted, and teeth-gnashing fierce, the track boasts plenty
    of lustful guitar solos and thick-headed bass drum pumping. ""Cornbread"" tumbles from uncontrolled,
    freewheeling riffs into a drunken ""Devil's in the cornbread, cornbread"" breakdown, complete with handclaps
    and multi-voiced chanting, while a cover of ""Bo Diddley"" references its namesake in both riff and force
    (Sparhawk's hollers of ""Hey Bo Diddley/ Said hey, Bo Biddley!"" form an oddly convincing incantations),
    eventually easing in some perfectly unexpected congas.</p><p>
    
    The Black-Eyed Snakes' version of the blues isn't always especially credible, but their evocation can still
    be transcendent: there are flashes of red on <i>Rise Up!</i> that are just fiery enough to manipulate
    listeners into instantly inking their own deals with the devil, even if it's just for the thrill of the
    burn.</p></div>"|756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/756-rise-up/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

    execs, massive mergers, treasonous KaZaA-crazy toddlers, and the aesthetic discomfort of the new $20 bill.
    As if those mattered. All those afflictions were dropped into Malibu and Bel-Air by the CIA in the mid-80s
    to distract them from the actual problem: Warp Records. When will people learn? Between Autechre and Aphex
    Twin alone, this simple and poorly worded aphorism should have been memorized by kindergartners: If you
    have a new song, DO NOT send it to Warp. Wave after wave of demos and masters are quickly deposited in the
    clammy hands of madmen. If the original artists are a song's parents, Warp remixers are those babysitters
    with gold eyepatches, tracks down their arms, fu-manchus, and babies speared on meat hooks in the basement.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, this new double-disc compilation of virtually every major Plaid remix since 1995 shows that
    those reliable IDM lobbyists, Ed Handley and Andy Turner, somehow wrangled a whopping eighteen artists into
    letting them defile, dismantle, deconstruct, and generally destroy every genre from splintering big beat to
    twinkling Parisian accordion jams. Plaid have always excelled at melding tuneful melodies, ever on the brink
    of collapse, and the tarry mechanical weight of drum-n-bass and Detroit techno.</p><p>
    This conjunction lends
    itself extraordinarily well to remixing as it effectively ensures that every track is filled out to its
    breaking point, balanced between immaterial and immolation. On a song like Reflection's ""Spiral Bits"" or
    Herbert's ""Foreign Bodies"", the sensation isn't clichéd popping, but volcanic romance: the release of an
    eruption surrounded by the weightlessness of ash. Witness how Gregory Fleckner Quartet's ""Juicy Jazz Girls""
    begins with brilliantly delicate melodies and is eventually subsumed by the scuttling vermin crawling
    underneath the song's floorboards until, seven minutes later, the melody wreaks havoc on the abrasiveness
    again. It's dance music that's very, um, intelligent.</p><p>
    The version of Dropshadow's ""Disease Fototienda"" is suffused with xylophonic scales, bent mandolins,
    military snares and sparkling orchestral pop, and bound with Velcro.  Plaid replace the sinisterly
    throbbing undercurrent of Björk's ""All Is Full of Love"" with a heightened fragility, and instate a
    subliminal scrape on the bass that's even more meditative than the <i>Homogenic</i> version. Unfortunately,
    this is an exception. The few remixes of more popular artists seem slightly overburdened by the originals.
    Goldfrapp's own handling of disarming choruses on ""Utopia"" seems to limit Plaid's opportunities. Grandmaster
    Flash's ""Scorpio"" sounds like a great idea on the tracklist, but neglects the original's playfulness for
    its own nostalgia.  Even worse, it's remarkably monotonous, throwing back to the decrepit second volume
    of MTV's <i>Amp</i> compilation series.</p><p>
    But of the material I take issue with here, the two Nicolette tracks, ""No Government"" and ""Wholesome"", are
    by far the most disheartening.  I have no fear of the ruling elite.  My opinion still stands: Nicolette is
    in a league of intolerability with Breakbeat Era's Leonie Laws or Lamb's Louise Rhodes.  And what's
    <i>really</i> frustrating?  They're two of the best tracks on the album, which wins them the dubious
    distinction of being perhaps the most stunning remixes of atrocious source material since Kruder &amp;
    Dorfmeister's ""Bug Powder Dust"".  ""Wholesome"", in particular, is transformed into one of the best Plaid
    songs ever, managing to litter pockets of orchestral pop amidst a tense dub, and even finding room for a
    quick sample of The Meters.  Why the hell did they have to put ""Love is wholesome/ Love makes babies"" at
    the beginning of it?</p><p>
    Although Plaid are far from ""difficult"" for their genre, this is perhaps the best place for beginners to
    set out. The panoply of different moods and tempos is even more diverse than the last major compilation,
    <i>Trainer</i>, and that album is primed to be one of the best releases of the decade. Plaid has never
    been boring, but on this album, the jumps from the monstrously webbed and bloating ""Wrong Ways"" and the
    affecting worldliness of Coba's ""After Dinner"", prove, like Aphex a few months ago, that a musician's
    finest work does not always need to be their work.</p></div>"|6336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6336-parts-in-the-post/|8.2|Alex Linhardt

Unfortunately, screaming ""I don't
    give a fuck"" at the top of your lungs over and over again isn't one of them.  It's hard to imagine anything
    sadder than someone expending such a huge amount of energy trying to prove that, no, really, she doesn't
    give a fuck-- except, of course, for this desperate plea for attention being followed by the very apathy
    and disaffection it promises.  Such is the case with Peaches' intensely disappointing second album
    <i>Fatherfucker</i>, which couples gratuitously ""shocking"" and embarrassingly unfunny lyrics with flat,
    lackluster instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    For all its sexed-up bravado, Peaches' debut, last year's <i>The Teaches of Peaches</i>, was in a class
    of its own, if nothing else: something about the way she approached her subject matter with such hilarious
    juvenility and unabashed, joyful conviction, while going to all possible extremes to make herself appear
    as unapproachably hideous as possible, struck me as irresistible.   Right from its frank opening line,
    ""Sucking on my titties,"" the album lived up to its name, providing a urgently needed collection of dirty
    schoolyard ditties for the immature and oversexed electroclash set.  One of its best attributes was its
    ability to leave you wondering whether Peaches took any of it seriously: was she actually promoting a
    lifestyle of canned drum machine beats and empty, gratuitous sex, or sending it up so masterfully that
    her songs could be embraced by the very people she mocked?</p><p>
    
    Either way, the joke's on Peaches here.  When <i>Fatherfucker</i> opens with ""I Don't Give a Fuck"", in
    which a sample of Joan Jett's ""Bad Reputation"" is answered, over the course of nearly two minutes, with
    a painfully drawn-out tantrum: <i>""I don't give a fuck!  I don't give a fuck!  Shit!  Fuck!  Shit!  Fuck!""</i>
    Yet, as outright terrible as this track is, <i>Fatherfucker</i>'s general mediocrity and sterility proves
    even more frustrating.  The gritty, overdriven 808 beats of <i>Teaches</i> were one of its greatest assets--
    a welcome respite from the glossy, platonic ideal percussion tracks employed by so many electroclash artists.</p><p>
    
    The beats on <i>Fatherfucker</i> are not only frustratingly simplistic, but the energy and surprising
    rhythmic complexity of the vocals on her debut are noticeably absent, too.  Songs like ""I U She"" and
    ""I'm the Kinda"" consist of little more than minimal and repetitive lyrics delivered dispassionately over
    cookie-cutter drum machine beats.  Whether she's singing about bitches, fucking, clits, threesomes, or
    porkbelly futures doesn't really matter; after a few songs, you, like Peaches, don't give a fuck-- and
    you don't have to fuck up a Joan Jett record to prove it.</p><p>
    
    Nor do you have to indulge in a miserable, stupidly self-referential duet with Iggy Pop.  In ""Tear It
    Up"", Iggy and Peaches throw back and forth snippets of each other's lyrics and references to their
    respective schticks.  ""I used to cut myself up!"" says Iggy.  ""Some people don't like my crotch!"" says
    Peaches.  ""Hey, guys, shut the fuck up!"" says the imaginary singer I hallucinated out of boredom, offering
    up a lyric far too honest and straightforward to have been worked into the original song.</p><p>
    
    Lame duets aside, there remain a lot of things I really like about Peaches.  With all the press coverage
    she's been receiving as of late, she continues to willfully defy all conventional notions of attractiveness
    in the way she chooses to be photographed, and her live shows remain entertaining, despite weaker source
    material.  Yes, <i>Fatherfucker</i> is a disaster, but it's a disaster that reveals just how unlikely its
    still-excellent predecessor was.  Here, the swollen charisma and balls-out energy of <i>Teaches</i> is
    given up in favor of mediocre songs about swollen balls.  Sorry, Peaches, but sometimes it pays to give a
    fuck.</p></div>"|6204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6204-fatherfucker/|3.5|Matt LeMay

On his first release, a self-titled 1996 debut
    under the alias Wabi Sabi, he took a dip into abstract computer-generated music.  Dense and impenetrable,
    the drone-heavy album showcased a few great tracks and anticipated later trends in digital microsound,
    but was ultimately the kind of record you listen to once or twice and file away.  He's also released,
    under his birthname, abstract electro-acoustic music built from collective improvisation.  But he's best
    known for his work as Pluramon.</p><p>
    
    Schmickler debuted his Pluramon project in 1996 with <i>Pick Up Canyon</i>, an album that, while featuring
    prominent digital drones on some tracks, was essentially an instrumental rock project: godlike Can drummer
    Jaki Leibezeit provided the rhythmic pulse while Schmickler added guitar and all manner of computer effects.
    Though the record evoked the sound of German rock's heyday, it was very much a studio project, with
    Schmickler meticulously arranging the tracks to sound like a live band.  (You might say that as Burnt
    Friedman is to dub, Markus Schmickler is to post-rock.)  I wouldn't call either <i>Pick Up Canyon</i>
    or its 1998 follow-up <i>Render Bandits</i> great, but both have scattered moments of angular guitar
    rock brilliance.</p><p>
    
    With Pluramon's new album, <i>Dreams Top Rock</i>, well, Schmickler is off in another direction entirely.
    Let's start by pointing out that Schmickler's primary collaborator this time out in not a Krautrock legend
    or a pointy-headed noisenik from the Mego camp, but rather, the versatile chanteuse Julee Cruise.  Cruise
    is most famous for her underrated 1989 album <i>Floating into the Night</i>, made in collaboration with
    Angelo Badalamenti and filmmaker David Lynch, on which she gave voice to the <i>Twin Peaks</i> theme
    ""Falling"".  She was also in the B-52's for a couple of years there.</p><p>
    
    So, yeah, <em>that</em> Julee Cruise holed up with Markus Schmickler to make an album of MBV-channeling
    <em>shoegaze</em> tunes, if you can believe it.  Then again, it's not surprising that rock's most
    texture-focused sound has turned out to be a serious influence on laptop musicians. As M83 established
    earlier this year, thickets of harmonic-rich drone can reach new levels of poignancy when channeled
    through a properly handled computer. Schmickler knows how to overdrive his guitar and then weave the
    resulting mess into a thick blanket to lay carefully over Cruise's delicate voice. These sounds together
    are what David Lynch likes to call a ""perfect combo.""</p><p>
    
    Since he's doing dreampop here, Schmickler edits wisely and lets his ten songs run for only 39 minutes.
    The centerpiece is ""Time For a Lie"", which is also reprised later in a different mix. It's clear from the
    first that there's a roughness to Schmickler's clouds of guitar distortion, as he lets a blocky,
    cheap-sounding noise linger at the edges. This dissonance throws Cruise's voice, which sounds like it
    was also run through a dozen delays and filters, into sharp relief. Schmickler ups the harshness
    considerably on the honestly titled ""Noise Academy"", sending random spikes of static through the center
    of Cruise's wordless moans. The beauty generated by the familiar blend of ethereality and brutal noise
    is breathtaking and makes me wonder how shoegaze ever fell out of fashion.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <i>Dreams Top Rock</i>, Julee Cruise's bravery in allowing Schmickler's level of vocal manipulation
    (one might even call it devastation) is admirable. She appears on most of the tracks, offering wordless
    chants to Schmickler's psychedelic swirl (""PS"") alongside articulated dirge-like ballads that could almost
    be called ""folky"" if they weren't so sonically fucked up. On ""Have You Seen Jill"", Cruise's phrasing reminds
    me of Harriet Wheeler which, coupled with the acoustic guitar at the song's center, brings to mind the
    phrase ""The Sundays Produced by Fennesz.""  In other words, the music of my dreams.</p><p>
    
    Every dense record needs a few tracks for the listener to come up for air.  ""Flagolea"" is a lazy,
    futuro-jazz shuffle that reminds me of something by Flanger, while ""Difference Machine"" is another ballad
    with acoustic strums, slide guitar and a strange monologue happening somewhere in the background. These
    pauses cleanse the palate between the pea-soup thick sheets of sound that are the record's norm. What an
    awesome surprise. As neo-shoegaze records go, <i>Dreams Top Rock</i> is fantastic, a leftfield experiment
    for Markus Schmickler that succeeded brilliantly.</p></div>"|6353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6353-dreams-top-rock/|8.5|Mark Richardson

    radio show.  For years, the legendary Detroit DJ piloted a mothership that descended on the Motor City with
    an eclectic cargo that included synth-pop, Kraftwerk, funk, Prince, new wave, and Philly Soul.  From time
    to time, I'd listen to the program late at night, relishing its exoticism and becoming a little more
    wide-eyed and -eared every time I tuned in. Of course, I didn't realize how unique or rare the show was
    at the time, and certainly could never have guessed its influence on the Belleville Three and how integral
    the show would therefore be to the development of techno.</p><p>
    
    The members of Midwest Product-- the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based trio of Ben Mullins (guitars, electronics),
    Chad Pratt (drums, electronics), and Drew Schmeding (bass, keyboards)-- may have grown up catching snatches
    of the same sounds and spirit.  Mixing electronics and live instrumentation, their second album sounds like
    my faded memories of the more European portions of those broadcasts-- or at least the way they're pieced
    together and romanticized in my mind.</p><p>
    
    On <i>World Series of Love</i>, the ghosts of those efficient, hook-filled synth-pop sounds dance with
    polished, crisp indie pop and experimental guitar as Midwest Product take a lateral step away their
    excellent, more electronic-based debut, <i>Specifics</i>. On their debut, the band occasionally droned
    on a bit long; here they leave everything short, trimming song lengths around the five-minute mark and
    delivering the album's seven tracks in around 30 minutes. The highs may not match either <i>Specifics</i>'
    ""Still Love in the Midwest"" or ""Laundry"", the highlight of Ghostly International's <i>Idol Tryouts</i>
    compilation, but the disc makes for a far more consistent listen.</p><p>
    
    The sense of humor displayed on the album's Salinger-aping design and Prince-quoting title is found on
    both the pulsating yet detached new wave-meets-funk of ""Bank"" and the avant-pop of ""Dead Cat"".  Where
    <i>World Series of Love</i> really hits its stride, however, is as it winds down, with a trio of nuanced,
    rich tunes that put the joke book back on the shelf. ""Duckpond"" best fuses the band's experimental nature
    and gift for melody, while the restless ""Motivator""-- fueled by arpeggio guitar and hollow vocals-- best
    displays the command of dynamics that Midwest Product boasted on their debut. The short, New Order-like
    ""Umbrella"" brings the record to elegant close.</p><p>
    
    Two albums into their career and Midwest Product's skillful live playing and deft use of electronics have
    placed them in a fraternity with ambient pop stars such as Markus Acher, Manual, Christian Kleine, and
    Ulrich Schnauss.  However, unlike the best of those, the band has yet to focus in on its strength and
    fully explore the limits of their songwriting. Instead, they're gleefully moving from one rewarding sound
    to another, relishing their range and honing their craft with a series of charming winks and nods.</p></div>"|5277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5277-world-series-of-love/|6.9|Scott Plagenhoef

    I'm no longer interested in.  And right on cue, there always seems to be a record waiting for me that wins
    me back-- at least for a few months.  By ""indie rock,"" I mean that bread-and-butter, classic formula that
    got you through high school or college or whatever other phase of your life during which you were obsessed
    with it: that old, reliable guitars/bass/drums setup with less-than-crystalline production and superchunks
    of memory-forming melody.</p><p>
    
    Lots of albums full of this stuff still see release every year, but it's a lamentable fact that the vast
    majority of them lack any melody factor working in their favor, be it for want of a distinctive vocalist
    or a simple lack of compositional imagination.  Over the years, I've heard too many of those albums to
    count, but it all feels worth it when you come across a record that really hits and makes the formula feel
    fresh again.  <i>Sing Me a Song</i>, the fourth full-length by Washington, DC's Hurricane Lamps is one of
    those albums.</p><p>
    
    The Lamps get more confident with each album they make, and on <i>Sing Me a Song</i>, they let their punk
    edge drop to reveal their pop heart more than ever, and the result is an adeptness at catching melodic
    lightning in a bottle and turning a phrase on a dime.  More importantly-- and this is what separates an
    album like this from the masses around it-- the band also has a knack for arrangements that feel just as
    substantive as the songs they support.  Rhythm guitarist Greg Bennett drops walking basslines while the
    band varies the rhythms and feels to better highlight the melody.  If the devil's in the details, they've
    got him pretty much slain.</p><p>
    
    The album lifts off slowly with the controlled burst of ""Listen"", with guitarist/vocalist Eric Tischler
    lying breathy harmonies over a thumping rhythm and phosphorescent guitar.  ""Turn Me On"" is a blast of
    high-octane pop built around an exultant shouted chorus.  Tischler's voice is a weirdly ingratiating
    tenor that muppets out completely when he really lets go (one of the few things I can foresee causing
    problems for more touchy listeners).  He also speaks plenty through his axe, tossing off some pretty
    decent guitar solos, particularly on ""Dive"", where he lets himself just wail for a couple of seconds
    before the band closes out the song.  Blessedly, though, he refrains from ever overdoing it-- only once
    does a whole song even top four minutes, much less a solo.</p><p>
    
    Tischler also gets off a few good lyrical volleys on ""Dive"", including these parting words from an estranged
    lover: ""She said, 'Leaving's all I'm ever good for/ And leaving's all that's good for me/ 'Cause leaving's
    always there when you want it/ And leaving's where I want to be.'""  Elsewhere, he helps keep the nerdish
    personal armor of the underground intact, imploring ""don't confuse me"" on the pop rollercoaster of ""For a
    Good Time..."" and serving up lines like, ""I saw you cringe behind your politesse,"" without so much as a
    smirk on ""Judge You All Night"".</p><p>
<i>Sing Me a Song</i> is a fine entry point into The Hurricane Lamps' catalog, though I have a hard time
    choosing between it and 2001's slightly rougher <i>Tilting at Windmills</i> when deciding which to pop in.
    Either way, it's a great record that's at least somewhat restored my faith in the power of indie rock for
    the time being.  I just wonder what will be there to pick me back up the next time I fall off the wagon.</p></div>"|3968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3968-sing-me-a-song/|7.4|Joe Tangari

    relationships with this band.  I am one of them.  As with any long-term engagement, there's a back catalog
    of injury: some of us felt slighted by R.E.M.'s eager dash to the big leagues; some can't get over ""Shiny
    Happy People""; still others considered the band officially defunct when Bill Berry quit (consider, for a
    moment, the integrity of a band that makes a drummer's departure seem catastrophic).  But now comes the
    ultimate challenge: helplessly watching R.E.M. sink into the classic-rock Lethe.</p><p>
    
    The symptoms came on fast: ""The One I Love"" gets a round of Clear Channel airplay on the flashback circuit,
    and the next thing you know there's a greatest hits package out there whose chronology <em>begins</em> with
    the band's seventh record.  They're old.  We're old.  The upside is that I'm less likely to receive any
    mail telling me SUCK IT YOU PIECE OF SHIT REM R0X0RZ.</p><p>
    
    Questionable though it may be for these paragons of rock rectitude to milk the vile ""two new songs"" format
    for their latter-day hits collection, <i>In Time, in its own safe way, logically picks up where
    </i><i>Eponymous left off.  So discuss the lopsided sequence and the strange curatorial choices (""The
    Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite"" but no ""Drive""?), but let's not forget that R.E.M.'s best tracks come pretty
    close to the pinnacle of what one can do with a riff, a verse and a chorus.</i></p><p>
    
    The obligatory Two New Songs included here are actually a song and a half: ""Bad Day"" spent about 15 years
    as a half-completed B-side famous for carrying the germ of ""It's the End of the World As We Know It"".  The
    lyrics are new-- angry and direct-- but you can still scream ""I feel fine"" over the chorus, which has
    retained the original chord progression. ""Animal"", the other new track, is one of those vaguely Middle
    Eastern stomps that Buck's Rickenbacker occasionally throws up (see also: ""I Could Turn You Inside Out"",
    ""You""), and has a great singalong hook, with Stipe gleefully yelping ""What's the big deal?"" as the harmony
    slides into a minor key.  It would have been right at home on R.E.M.'s most substantive 90s offering, <i>New
    Adventures in Hi-Fi.</i></p><p>
    
    As something of a commercial non-starter, <i>Adventures</i> is represented here by only two tracks: ""E-Bow
    the Letter"" and the cutie-pie ""Electrolite"" (whose space might have been more deserved by ""Bittersweet
    Me"").  <i>Monster is, wisely, all but erased from the band's discography-- only ""What's the Frequency,
    Kenneth?"" made the cut (although sadly not the live </i><i>Letterman</i> version with vocals by Dan Rather).
    <i>Up, the band's first album as a trio, is correctly represented by the majestic waltz ""Daysleeper""
    and ""At My Most Beautiful"", which marks the start of R.E.M.'s current Brian Wilson fixation. The inclusion
    of ""All the Right Friends"", off the </i><i>Vanilla Sky</i> soundtrack, severely stretches the definition of
    the word ""hit,"" but the song (written in 1979) is baggage-free fun that deserves another shot.  Of course,
    <i>Automatic for the People</i> is the clear winner here, at least by Warner's standards: this disc
    includes no less than <i>four</i> of its songs, which should make you feel pretty stupid if you a) own
    it, or b) don't.</p><p>
    
    The bonus disc on the album's pricier edition promises ""rarities and B-sides,"" but don't get your hopes
    up; it's long on live performances of hits and short on the kind of drunken studio fuckery that made
    <i>Dead Letter Office</i> such a blast.  The highlights here are a fantastic trip-hop version of ""Leave""
    (less a remix than a rescue operation, really), and a spare demo of <i>Reveal's ""The Lifting"" that
    shows the precise moment at which the producers should have stopped fiddling with the material.  There is
    one very welcome </i><i>Dead Letter Office</i>-esque track, though: ""Star Me Kitten"" narrated by W.S. Burroughs
    in a series of depraved howls.</p><p>
    
    And there you have it: a great album that you probably already own piecemeal, impossible to pan but even
    harder to endorse.  <i>In Time will make a handy proselytizing tool for weaning your niece off Matchbox
    20.  To you, it's an unintentional reminder that R.E.M. are a classic and still-relevant band not because
    of, but in spite of, their commercial success.</i></p></div>"|6751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6751-in-time-the-best-of-rem-1988-2003/|7.5|Michael Idov

    indiscernible at worst, there is a difference in mood.  If <i>The Perfect Prescription</i> often sounded
    extraterrestrial, it also just as often sounded like traditional Velvets-inspired indie rock.  On <i>Forged
    Prescriptions</i>, though, the stratifications of guitar are even further attenuated to stunning single
    tones, the basslines float even more subliminally under the psychedelic mind-spinning noodling, and...
    well, okay, the drums are pretty much the same.</p><p>
    
    The gateway drug on this collection is the alternative mix to ""Things'll Never Be the Same"".  If the
    original was a feedback dust-up, quenched in gravelly, occasionally Bob Mould-ish vocals and an abyssal
    thump, the new mix is so bombarded with combating guitar squeals, earthen drums, and Pierce's sustained
    tones it will excoriate your entire body. From the classic intro onwards, the guitars are played backwards,
    forwards, sidewards, epiphanywards.  The original was phenomenal strutting feedback stagnating in the void.
    This is a twirling tea kettle launched into orbit, feedback that goes somewhere, at a pressure that gives
    you the bends. By ""Call the Doctor"", the guitars are spewing their trajectories of cosmic refulgence farther
    than the ears can grasp.  At one point, I accompanied this euphony with the ""Rolling Fire"" setting on Windows
    Media Player and my computer restarted itself.  Truth.</p><p>
    
    The new ""Walking with Jesus"" is perhaps the most startling mix, taking the original into an even more
    incorporeal and immaculate sphere. The <i>Perfect Prescription</i> version used too many 80s-indie-rock
    guitars for my liking, and vaguely sardonic; this one is an anesthetic plunge into purgatory, equipped
    with a choir instead of rock 'n' roll, and it's positively cultish-- the anthem of a Polyphonic Spree
    crossed with Heaven's Gate. ""Come Down Easy (Demo Version)"" is a filthy atomic 100-bar blues, oscillating
    echoes of birdman Pierce, our acidhead savior.  You will bow down to him for his beatific benevolence and
    serenity. Except in this religion, the communion wafers are shrooms, the crucifix is the solar system, and
    the holy book is my hallucinations about Toad Demons: ""It's 1987/ All I wanna do is get stoned.""</p><p>
    
    But the second disc is the one that truly breathes new life into <i>Perfect Prescription</i>. The extended
    version of the Red Krayola cover ""Transparent Radiation"" replaces the angry muddle of the album version
    with light and clarity.  The demo version of ""Walking with Jesus"" is when the Son of God bought a shotgun,
    rockin' twine and fuzz battered by shivering engines.  The demo version of the heralded ""Starship"" and the
    previously unreleased cover of the MC5's ""I Want You Right Now"" are bone-implodingly dense, perfect tributes
    to 60s psych-metal, plasma ghosts emerging from Sabbath's grave.</p><p>
    
    To get pragmatic for a second (a little silly considering the only word this band knows is ""excess""), the
    differences between these tracks and their album version counterparts can seem innocuous enough if you're
    not listening closely.  Purists who've spent years memorizing every note of <i>The Perfect Prescription</i>
    are sure to think of it as little more than a curiosity.  Many of the mixes here, however, are more complex,
    harmonious and pulverizing than those on the original classic.  The second disc also acts as a sort of
    paltry best-of that combines some excellent covers with the most memorable songs from the original LP.
    As for those neophytes who ask if this album's any good if you're not on drugs, a better question might
    be whether drugs are any good without this album.</p></div>"|7720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7720-forged-prescriptions/|8.1|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    stand as evidence to the contrary.  Supergroups like Jets to Brazil and The Promise Ring rose to prominence
    as some of the last worthwhile pop bands of the decade, only to become the first great disappointments of
    the new millennium.  One heard whispers of a confused direction, and perhaps even (in TPR's case) a confused
    sexual orientation.  Either way, The Promise Ring went out with a sigh, and the odds of another good Jets
    to Brazil album are about as good as that dodo on the cover of <i>Four-Cornered Night</i> coming to life
    in your living room and shitting all over <i>Electric Pink</i>.</p><p>
    
    Enter Brand New, whose first album was the effective sum of Saves the Day and Dashboard Confessional.
    You guessed it: LIES.  LIES stands for L.ong I.sland E.mo with S.creams-- think Taking Back Sunday,
    Thursday, Wednesday, Friday, and any other group of emo-dandies that prance delicately through candylands
    of Orange Rhyming Dictionaries, New Nathan Detroits and Bells, Bells, Bells.  But S.O.S!  Very Emergency!
    Brand New's new album for Razor and Tie, <i>Deja Entendu</i>, is produced by Stephen Haigler, engineer of
    the Pixies' <i>Trompe le Monde</i>.  This and the album's postmodern cover art hint at something more
    substantial than 2001's <i>Your Favorite Weapon</i>.</p><p>
    
    While it was surely a treat for ninth and tenth-graders chomping at the bit for ""Jude Law and a Semester
    Abroad"", Brand New's debut did little for anyone with an interest in instrumentation or variety; it also
    had a bad case of self-consciousness, with singer Jesse Lacey spending more time thinking up crazy song
    titles than anyone in the band (himself included) spent on actual songcraft.  But <i>Deja Entendu</i>,
    while a football field short of groundbreaking, has an air of substance and maturity that, at its peaks,
    makes me forget a little of how Jade Tree once jaded me.</p><p>
<i>Deja Entendu</i> comes complete with its own share of ridiculous track names-- a few of which are funny
    if you can fit your tongue next to that lollipop in your cheek.  The opener, ""Tautou"", isn't the album's
    strongest, but it's significant in that it introduces the band's new sound with just over a minute of
    minimalist guitar arpeggio and sombre vocals.  Things pick up quickly with ""Sic Transit Gloria..."", as
    Lacey's layered whispering over the bass-driven verse breaks violently into an overdriven chorus.  In
    come harmonic shrieks and screams which fall in bassy stair-steps back to the verse.  This song rocks but
    it makes me wonder: Why would a band like this tour with Dashboard Confessional?  To score chicks?</p><p>
    
    ""Okay, I Believe You But My Tommygun Don't"" gives Brand New's formula away, but as the song progresses
    there are flashes of wit and maturity, even humor.  Lacey scoffs at the narcissistic pretentiousness of
    the emo scene with lines like, ""These are the words you wish you wrote down/ This is the way you wish your
    voice sounds/ Handsome and smart/ My tongue's the only muscle on my body that works harder than my heart.""
    As long as it stubbornly refuses to roll over and die, emo should at least develop this sense of humor.
    It could have come off a backpacker hip-hop record if it weren't pulled off with such searing sarcasm.</p><p>
    
    ""The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows"" is trite enough for radio play, which is frustrating as it opens
    promisingly.  Unfortunately, though, LIES overcome the band and the song mutates into an aberrant hybrid
    of Jimmy Eat World and The Used.  This burn is thankfully extinguished in favor of a Smiths-y ballad, ""The
    Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot"".  ""Jaws Theme Swimming"" is cool and controlled enough to be crafty, but ""Me
    vs. Maradona vs. Elvis"" is flat-out indulgent.  Fortunately, for the subsequent 3:25 seconds, ""Guernica""
    will make you forgive and forget.  It's a brilliant lament about the horrors of cancer that manages both
    desperation and confidence.  Still, at the end of the day, we're left with just an EP's worth of decent
    songs and a spark of interest where formerly there might've been a laugh of disgust.  Stephen Haigler may
    have aided Brand New in discovering a more mature approach to recording, but as far as breaking new ground,
    the album's title says it all.</p></div>"|1090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1090-deja-entendu/|6.9|Noah Sutcliffe

    verses on records by Lifesavas, Tommy Guerrero, and Poets of Rhythm, and blazing Blackalicious' underrated
    full-length, it's hardly surprising that high expectations would surround the solo debut from the lower
    voice of Latyrx.  What <i>is</i> surprising is that he's delivered as hoped: <i>Later That Day</i> shows
    him stepping out as the freshest driving force behind the less-than-vocal Quannum collective.</p><p>
    
    The most important thing about this record is to realize that Lyrics Born's greatest strength lies in the
    power of his voice. Along the lines of Gift of Gab with a smoke-scarred throat, his soulfully, raspy vocals
    are augmented by rapid cadence changes and an enjoyable cold funk delivery. His subject matter touches upon
    mostly pedestrian concepts, from anxiety towards tax collectors and neglectful parents (""Stop Complaining"")
    to his tribulations within various friendships (""Before and After"") to his discontent with the mediocrity
    of his opponents (""Pack Up""). He handles these topics with a mix of crisp raps and addictive singsong hooks
    that works on both levels attempted, while still seeming genuine within the everyman role.</p><p>
    
    But none of these tracks hold the emotional severity of the hammerhead mid-album chanter ""The Last Trumpet""
    with partner-in-crime Lateef The Truth Speaker. A thinly veiled 9/11 response at face value, the song thrives
    chiefly on the ridiculous chemistry between Latyrx.  Riding a barebones drum loop with rolling bass stabs
    and an orchestral hue, the duo trades off lines, with Lyrics Born detailing that the ""the harvest has no
    worth"" while Lateef vilifies a society wherein ""the people are the victims, sheep being led about."" The
    song reaches its apex with the criss-crossing choral ring that tightens around the rhymesayers in question,
    springing from a call-and-response game against the term ""right now,"" almost paying homage to Van Halen.
    It all amounts to the kind of positive rap rave-up you'd expect from Latyrx: fast, melodic and as far as
    you can get from rap without sounding too foreign.</p><p>
    
    The production develops the surprising crux of <i>Later That Day</i>. The aesthetic is clear from the outset:
    Lyrics Born takes late 70s/early 80s standards and soundscapes, mangles them into rap format and drops a
    lovely modern veneer over them. From the bouncing guitar and crushing vamp of ""Bad Dreams"" to the
    cowbell-infused, chopped-up <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> disco of Cut Chemist's ""Do That There"" to the floating
    Rick James synth and electronic fuzz bass of ""One Session"", Lyrics Born embraces the past without sounding
    like a tribute album.</p><p>
    
    Although the first solo from Lyrics Born has a dearth of lame skits (""Cold Call"" might feature Gift of Gab,
    but it's seriously just a four minute phone conversation with a beat that they never utilize) and a couple
    repetitive throwaway cuts (""Hello"", ""Rise and Shine""), but it still stands as a startling debut from an
    under-appreciated emcee in a steadily growing label.</p></div>"|4953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4953-later-that-day/|7.6|Rollie Pemberton

    indie rock quartet Cobra Verde's third full-length, <i>Easy Listening</i>.  Listening to this thing, I can
    see a scene from which the music originally sprung: sleeveless black t's, duck-taped bassdrum, microphone
    dangling from an overhead light, Stooges and Bowie posters pinned beside Dad's workbench.  Since <i>Viva La
    Muerte</i> was released a little less than ten years ago, Cobra Verde's sound has exuded this type of
    heavy-handed rock romanticism.  Full of thrashing guitars, pulverizing drums and tightly harmonized
    choruses, their songs mimic the feverish abandon and catchy intensity of the Buzzcocks, The Who and
    Hüsker Dü, while emulating more literate forebears like The Kinks and MC5.  It's an unapologetically
    hybridized sound that, for a very brief time, seemed on the verge of growing into something new.</p><p>
    While some people have characterized Cobra Verde's music as ""bombastic""-- a word that's usually taken to
    mean ""pompous"" (what I think they actually mean is ""incredibly loud"")-- I tend to think of it more as
    destructively melodic.  The pounding, relentless rhythms are baldly formulaic from song to song, but they
    have a cumulative effect that, by album's end, leaves nerve-endings satisfyingly rattled and arm hairs
    standing on end.  Depending on your temperament, this can be either a cathartic or disembodying experience,
    but regardless of how it hits you, Cobra Verde, to their great credit, never stand on ceremony.  Each song
    is skin-and-bones rock: unpretentious, fierce and insolent.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, about halfway through the album, the sound wears itself out, as the samey melodies edge
    towards the too-familiar, like the narrative arc of a Jerry Bruckheimer film, and, I hasten to add, the
    vocal harmonizing on the choruses borders on the diarrheic.  As the album slogs on, the songs seem to
    become battles of will between the individual musicians, with singer John Petkovic's already toned-down
    vocals getting pushed largely to the background.  The wall-of-sound of guitars and drums loses its
    frenetic, ardent profundity, and instead sounds merely like ornament to a lazily crafted song.</p><p>
    Despite these shortcomings, <i>Easy Listening</i> does showcase its share of surprises.  A memorable
    one comes during ""Til Sunrise"", where Petkovic's bleak, understated lyrics coalesce with the scratchy
    riffs from Frank Vazzano's guitar and Mark Klein's heavy-metal drumming into a luminous, Bob Mould-worthy
    hook.  In a song that radiates a less-than-happy feeling, Petkovic wails, ""Everything looks beautiful/
    With blurry eyes.../ You're not you/ I'm not me/ We're as good as we can be.""</p><p>
    ""To Your Pretty Face"" has a catchy, almost country rhythm, until a 60s psych-rock organ creeps in on the
    chorus and the track shifts gears into a Jefferson Airplane-meets-Sparklehorse mindfuck.  It's one of the
    better songs on the album, and the one on which Petkovic manages finally to get his voice out in front of
    the crashing cymbals and guitars.  On ""My Name is Nobody"", the drums again take precedence and Petkovic
    struggles to make himself heard.  But make no mistake, he <i>is</i> there, singing morosely, ""By the time
    I got to Phoenix/ I was halfway to hell.""  The hauntingly textured ""Throw It Away"" is a nod to Irish
    drinking ballads.  One can almost see Petkovic, equipped with tweed jacket and gravy-stained suspenders,
    toasting a long-gone bonny lass: ""Drink to what isn't here/ Raise a glass to the dead and gone.""</p><p>
    Cobra Verde has largely shirked the exposure of their Guided by Voices affiliation and publicity-obsessed
    peers.  They remain in Cleveland, where the various members teach, write, run a recording studio and
    practice juggling on the side.  Petkovic said in an interview recently, ""I have another job and I am
    reconciled to the fact that, whether [the record] sells or not, I'm just going to have fun.""  This is a
    refreshing departure from the self-satisfied ballyhoo typical of rockstars.  If he ever changes his mind,
    though, I have a pretty good feeling that Cobra Verde could hit it big in New York.</p></div>"|1727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1727-easy-listening/|6.5|John O'Connor

    a surreal head trip best described by Cerberus Shoal themselves: ""Our deepest investigation yet, of all
    thee swirling symbolisms buried in each our very own psyches', as they clink and clack upon thee others,
    each and all.""  That's right, a personal journey with few clear themes and a lot of resolutely unfiltered
    lyrics, and no matter how many times you spin it you've got that nagging fear that you're not ""getting it.""
    And maybe you never will: it ain't <i>your</i> subconscious that belched this up.</p><p>
<i>Chaiming the Knobblessone</i> continues the direction Cerberus Shoal took on their recent split EPs--
    for example, the abstract lyrics and obtuse sound collage of ""A Man Who Loved Holes"" (from the <i>Ducks
    and Drakes of Guapo and Cerberus Shoal</i>), or the intricate poetry and large-scale arrangements of ""Ding""
    (from <i>The Vim and Vigour of Alvarius B and Cerberus Shoal</i>).  Their wordless improvisations and clear
    world music influences have shattered, reconfigured and picked up lyrics, culminating in a sprawling album
    that comes off as some kind of art-damaged radio play.</p><p>
    
    A male lead-- presumably Chriss Sutherland-- sings and recites most of the lyrics, backed by female voices
    that breast-beat and wail or sing like the chorus at a hippie repertory theater.  The content shows a crazy
    wit as it switches from songs to dialogues: for example, in the mid-album intermission, ""A Paranoid Home
    Companion"", a futuristic interrogator grills a ""zek"" who has escaped from a communal hivemind.  This starts
    as a sci-fi cliche about individuality versus the collective consciousness, but the Shoal's made-up language
    and snarky tone bring it to life.  And exotic nonsense, holy and profane, drifts through the other epic-length
    songs-- dig the way ""Story #12 from the Invisible Mountain Archive"" sticks whack-off jokes and Christmas
    themes into its surreal adventure story.  (And if you want to know what the ""remote control brain"" looks
    like, check out the gorgeous hand-painted liner notes.)</p><p>
    
    The music is an intricate construction, coloring acoustic instruments and trumpet and accordion solos with
    collaged electronic sounds and grainy samples.  Some parts are denser than others-- like the noise pastiche
    in ""Mrs. Shakespeare's Torso""-- but the work progresses like a typical Cerberus Shoal album, in an even
    amble that rarely blows into a crescendo.  Just as they used to be mislabeled as a post-rock band, you
    can now lump them on the edge of the free-folk movement, with hints of the acoustic madness that's going
    on one state over in Vermont.  This makes it feel stream-of-consciousness even though the arrangements are
    serious, the extra quirks-- toy percussion and piano, a choppy Spanish guitar-- woven in with care.</p><p>
    
    There are a few reasons this isn't a masterpiece: some of the sections, like the closer ""Scaly Beast vs.
    Toy Piano"", run so long that they start to meander; and end-to-end, the seventy-seven minute runtime includes
    a lot of wandering.  But <i>Chaiming the Knobblessone</i> is too big a mess of ideas and imagination to be
    taut or ""perfect.""  What you get is an extraordinary triathlon of the id/ego/superego-- an album that's
    both crazy and calming, where no idea or image is too far-out to fit.  It's another milestone for the
    always-intriguing Cerberus Shoal.</p></div>"|1385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1385-chaiming-the-knobblessone/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

    devoted to the frivolous pursuit of happiness, nor a place where people mope in the gloom waiting for
    Death to challenge them to a game of backgammon.  To make such sweeping generalizations about a people
    as diverse or cold as the Swedes is crass and shortsighted; it betrays a shocking lack of cultural
    relativism.  National temperaments and temperatures aside, though, one thing must by now be certain-- and
    call this a gross generalization if you must, but: without American Rock and Roll, no Swedish bands would
    ever have been good at anything.</p><p>
    
    Last-year's models, The Hives, were just the latest in an evolving line of acts hell-bent on stealing some
    good ol' American thunder, copping a couple vintage licks, and giving them enough gas to make most of our
    own sleepyheaded retro flag-bearers look limp in comparison.  Beaten at our own game!  The day an American
    band can't rip-off The Ramones as well as some clean-shaven, well-dressed foreigners is a sad day indeed.
    If only they weren't so consistently damn good at it.</p><p>
    
    The latest installment in Sweden's rock 'n' roll clinic comes courtesy of the uniformly modded-out guys
    in Mando Diao, and they appear to have smash-and-grab routine down as well, if not better, than their
    forebears.  Technically, the origin of Mando Diao's pilfered sonics is probably closer to the likes of
    The Who, The Kinks, or Creation, but the British Invaders were just taking lessons from Motown, the Blues,
    and a little Chuck Berry anyway, so it's not like Mando Diao's more than one step removed from our musical
    ancestors.  And besides, no matter how many steps it took to get to their brand of soul-rock pastiche, on
    <i>Bring 'Em In</i>, their very first album, they absolutely nail it.  Organs and tambourines flutter just
    at the edges of classic, ""My Generation""-sized riffs, tapping into the awesome power of some of the most
    basic roots of 60s rock and executing it perfectly.  They even cultivate an air of being exactly 31%
    reckless and carefree in said execution-- the ideal, scientifically calculated percentage found to
    maximize the perception that they're somehow not borrowing shamelessly from their betters.</p><p>
    
    Knowing the ratio will not render you immune.  It's to Mando Diao's credit that, as easy as it is to rattle
    off a litany of easy influences, they come out sounding very much their own entity.  The guitar line central
    to ""Sheepdog"", <i>Bring 'Em In</i>'s opening track, wastes no time letting the listener that he or she is
    indeed about to be rocked into the ground, as immediately recognizable as some of Roger Daltrey's second-tier
    riffs, but bristling with the pent-up aggression that skipped his generation and went straight to the
    Heartbreakers.  The Kinks' maximum R&amp;B; rock gets a similar treatment: ""Paralyzed"" is descended from the
    genes of ""Sweet Lady Genevieve"", but trades that song's high-minded instrumental flourishes for a shot of
    pleasantly low-brow vitality.</p><p>
    
    The album is so casually frantic, in fact, that Mando Diao stumble briefly in transition, at times, from
    the maniacal bliss-outs like ""Motown Blood"" (check the name in case you think I'm making this stuff up)
    into slower, more somber moments like ""Mr. Moon"".  The deceleration between the two can cause whiplash,
    and ""Moon"" happens to be the album's weakest moment in and of itself, hampered by some unfortunately
    severe invocations to ""Mishtah Moo"" (or at least it sounds like it).  It's the only instance where Bjorn
    Dixgard's vocals fail him, though, and in all seriousness, the guy can't help an accent.  It's just unlucky
    that it sounds so momentarily out of place; he then proceeds to channel a hint of James Brown to kick off
    ""Lady"", and totally redeems that one false move.</p><p>
    
    In general, between Dixgard and Gustaf Noren, who trade vocal duties, these songs are sung with reverence,
    and sincerity, and passion, to a degree which is truly impressive, and the band's dynamic, classic roots
    match them at every turn.  It's convenient, I guess, to even imagine that this might be a posture,
    exacerbated by the passing similarity of tracks like ""Sheepdog"" to the leading revivalists on this side
    of the pond, The Strokes, but it's hard to listen to the entire album and still believe that.  It's just
    not easy to fake the evident enthusiasm here.  Mando Diao is stealing our rock 'n' roll thunder, but if
    we can't produce anyone to offer them some competition, I suppose they're welcome to it.</p></div>"|5557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5557-bring-em-in/|8.0|Eric Carr

    Jeremiah Green alongside a host of jewel-eyed indie vets.  But perhaps the most salient Shins affinity is
    the album's undeniable magical enchantment and deftness of touch. For twenty minutes, Tristan Marcum's
    ether-worldly rising harmonies conspire with shiny melodies and steadily bouncing meters to craft perfectly
    visceral pop songs.</p><p>
    
    It's clear from the start: These songs are about leaving clear-cut sonic impressions. ""Light on the Right""
    and ""Gun for Gun"" feel like sharing a London Christmas with The Kinks in July. The latter rings in with a
    few bell touches under Ryan Kraft's chiming guitar before craftily deploying a vibraphone to beef up a
    mid-track breakdown that pulls at your cheeks.  ""Blue, Blue Bones"" delivers a jangling Orbison-reminiscent
    melody with swiftly shuffling rhythms and vintage pop tones.  ""In Sunless Seas"", a two-minute-long,
    comparably dronish affair, adds some edge to the sound, but best serves the record by temporarily breaking
    its hypnotic spell and highlighting the impact of each singular song, which do flow almost imperceptibly
    into each other.</p><p>
    
    ""Starlights Our Way"" is as delightfully captivating as anything written this side of the New Pornographers,
    showcasing the band's ability to pen effortless yet substantive songs. In reaffirmation of the EP's
    stylistic design, Marcum's lyrics reflect vocal mastery of consonance, assonance, and inflection rather
    than any calculated message: ""Why-oh-why do skies come tumbling down/ Try we try but there's no wind to be
    bound/ Mild smiles and days may muddle the wild-eyed.""  It's a perfect formula, done with just enough
    sincerity so as not to come off as flaky and uncommunicative.  On the mid-tempo Hammond organ-adorned
    closer, ""The Very Scary Trees"", Marcum similarly stammers, ""If we can find the peaches in the very peary
    trees/ I'm on my sha-na-na-na knees.""  And it woa-woh-woh-works.</p><p>
    
    The Vells carve out a comfortable, if not wholly unfamiliar niche, but whether their future course will
    prove stagnant or expansive is uncertain: The question is whether the band needs to keep swimming in
    future releases in order to keep from sinking, or if a full-length of the same stuff will do.  For now,
    this remains a music for all seasons, past and future, no matter where it came from, or where it intends
    to go.</p></div>"|8518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8518-vells-ep/|7.8|William Morris

It's something like what a book critic would face if he reviewed
    a published screenplay. There's what the work was initially meant to do (a screenplay is a blueprint for
    a film, a soundtrack lends musical support to the drama), and then there's how you experience it on the
    consumer end (as a book or CD).  When one writes about a soundtrack, the task is to tell the reader how
    it works as a piece of music.  But the band, if they did their job right, created the music to work as
    part of a film first, and as a record second. So the soundtrack record is by definition an incomplete
    work of art.</p><p>
<i>The Strangler's Wife</i> is Cul de Sac's first attempt at a film soundtrack, and was written for the
    low-budget horror flick of the same name.  While at work on their latest release, <i>Death of the Sun</i>.
    the band was approached by Roger Corman's production company about scoring the film, and put their
    full-length on hold to dive into the project, often improvising live as clips of the film ran in the
    studio. I haven't seen the film (and probably won't), but the soundtrack to <i>The Strangler's Wife</i>
    is a worthwhile document that both shows what Cul de Sac does well and reveals the limitations of the
    soundtrack as record.</p><p>
    
    The first thing to point out is that <i>The Strangler's Wife</i> consists of 18 tracks over 42 minutes.
    These numbers are notable for Cul de Sac, a band that's never shied away form the epic and extended. In
    fulfilling their duties as soundtrack composers, many of the tracks are ""cues"" rather than fully realized
    compositions.  Since cues, by definition, are small bits of music meant to convey a single emotional idea
    and often play during interludes as one scene transitions into the next, half of this record's tracks
    range from around 30 seconds to just over two minutes, and each pretty much embodies one feeling or mood.</p><p>
    
    Similar in overall sound to <i>Death of the Sun</i>, Cul de Sac here leans away from their former
    guitar/bass/drums post-rock style toward a more electronically oriented sound. The 90-second ""Frustrated
    Seduction ('Wash it Off!')"" consists of some electric keyboard chords and drums cut and processed
    (presumably by the newest Cul de Sac member, turntablist Jake Trussell) to create a sense of anxious
    uncertainly, while the one-minute following track ""Fifth Victim (Aerobic)"" is pure aural violence, with
    frenetic drum-n-bass beats drowning in distortion. As befits a horror film, the mood throughout is
    generally foreboding, with the darkness reaching a pitch during the tracks composed for the murder
    scenes. That said, Cul de Sac do a nice job fleshing out the film's more reflective moments.</p><p>
    
    Taken together, the album's short tracks are an interesting demonstration of Cul de Sac's range. If you've
    listened to them for a while, for example, you'll get a kick out of hearing the band that backed Damo
    Suzuki on tour compose their ultimate Can tribute on ""Tailing the Strangler""-- and certainly the idea of
    using this ""You Doo Right"" motorik in a chase scene is inspired.  But these quickie moods are over so
    quick that there's a bit of a whiplash effect when listening to the entire record.  The constant shifts
    keep the listener skimming the surface of the music.</p><p>
    
    What redeems <i>The Strangler's Wife</i> as an album is the handful of excellent acoustic guitar
    instrumentals by Cul de Sac leader Glenn Jones. Despite the quick and improvisational nature of this
    project, there's nothing half-assed about Jones's melodies. While short, ""That's Great Then, Isn't It?""
    brilliantly combines harmonically rich plucked chords with grating scrapes of digital noise. The
    five-minute ""Mirror II (Mae and Elana)"" is positively gorgeous, as Jones channels the lyricism of
    the late John Fahey (a former Cul de Sac collaborator) in a duet with violinist Jonathan LaMaster.
    On this sampler plate of a record, this is the meat, and when I return to <i>The Strangler's Wife</i>
    soundtrack it will be to cherry pick highlights like ""Mirror II"".</p></div>"|1687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1687-the-stranglers-wife/|6.8|Mark Richardson

    Listening to <i>Is This It</i> last week had me scratching my head over how it managed to become the
    Roe vs. Wade of the rock crit world in 2001, with everyone forced to choose sides: ""saviors of rock!""
    or ""everything that's wrong with music today!""  At the time, I found myself in the latter category,
    ironically earning myself a spot on this very staff with a lengthy diatribe against the band's hype
    machine, socioeconomic background, and rampant influence-pilfering.  You know, basically everything
    but the music.</p><p>
    
    I feel pretty silly about such grandstanding nowadays, having finally listened to, and embraced, at least
    the show-stopping middle third of The Strokes' debut.  But with the release of <i>Room on Fire</i>, both
    sides of The Great Strokes Debate look a little foolish; NYC's finest have all but given birth to an
    identical twin.  In the interim, a perplexing flirtation with Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich (""you know,
    'Last Nite' was just a few lasers away from being <em>perfect!</em>"") was scrapped, and the band's relentless
    touring failed to lead them down the cockier, arena-rock path some suspected they'd travel.  Instead,
    <i>Room on Fire</i> is eleven songs sharing DNA with its predecessor, a follow-up of more sleepy,
    contagious mono-pop that doesn't sound diligently recorded so much as yawned out.</p><p>
    
    This is far from a bad thing, largely because The Strokes seem almost pathologically unable to write a
    song that isn't immediately catchy.  Tracks like ""Reptilia"", ""Meet Me in the Bathroom"", and ""Under Control""
    take their place alongside the highlights of the band's debut, all hitting that perfect contrast of woozy
    nonchalance and taut guitar work that appears to be the alpha and omega of their stylistic inventory.
    That there's nothing new or innovative to be found here is sure to be a common complaint, though only
    those who prize evolution over knowing one's strengths will cry fraud.</p><p>
    
    Speaking of the originality quotient-- and not to add more historical tinder to the fire of what bands The
    Strokes supposedly owe a debt to, but-- lead guitarist Nick Valensi is sweating The Pixies' Joey Santiago
    something fierce here.  His development is the only newish detail I can detect on <i>Room on Fire</i>, and
    it's an inspiration that lends improvement; Santiago's beautifully simple lead lines were The Pixies'
    secret weapon, and Valensi employs a similar humble style to lend a melodic counterpoint to the proceedings.
    Whether showing up at the Halloween party as The Cars' keyboard on ""12:51"" or contributing slow-hand solos
    to ""What Ever Happened?"" and ""You Talk Way Too Much"", it's an extra spritz of tuneship that only assists
    The Strokes' infectious ways.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Julian Casablancas is a far cry from Frank Black as vocalists go, but it can at least be said
    that he knows his place through <i>Room on Fire</i>.  Wisely avoiding the unbecoming screaminess of subpar
    <i>Is This It</i> tracks like ""Take It or Leave It"" and ""New York City Cops"", he instead applies a cough
    syrupy croon to ""Under Control"" and ""The End Is No End"", its bum notes smoothed out by his payphone vocal
    effect addiction.  Casablancas also appears to have moved beyond the smirking misogyny of his early lyrics,
    just as the cover art is sagely chosen to continue the abstract graphic theme of the Stateside edition of
    <i>Is This It</i> rather than the <i>Smell the Glove</i>-style UK version.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the rhythm section, the band's Achilles' heel, continues to miraculously scrape by, lending
    these tracks a vaguely new wave air despite slack-limp playing (hey guys, trade Godrich's number for the
    DFA's and you might be onto something).  Drummer Fabrizio Moretti has always tended to sound a bit like
    a drum machine, and here his best work happens when he shares the drummer's stool <i>with</i> a sampler--
    ""The Way It Is"" and ""Meet Me in the Bathroom"" shuffle with the best technology 1983 had to offer.  Bassman
    Nikolai Fraiture, mostly relegated to backbone status on this outing, carries less of the band's melodic
    weight than he did on <i>Is This It</i> but gets a front-of-stage moment on the perfectly choreographed
    breakdown of ""Reptilia"".</p><p>
    
    It remains to be seen whether old white men will continue to trumpet The Strokes as leading the cause of
    hiphopicide, and if young white idealists will stand firm on the opposite side, regarding the band as the
    Nike of indie rock (and no doubt fixating their conspiracy theories on Casablancas' sarcastic aside
    ""keepin' down the underground, oh no!""); what's clear is that The Fab(rizio) Five neither deserve, nor
    desire, either status-- their goals are about as unpretentious and uncomplicated as possible.  They may
    not be able to get away with milking this formula for many more albums, but for now, <i>Room on Fire</i>'s
    eleven songs find them drowsily getting away with what they do best.</p></div>"|7538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7538-room-on-fire/|8.0|Rob Mitchum

    Cameras.  His second solo album finds him fraternizing with Bry Webb, who contributes guitar to two songs
    on this record, and whose band The Constantines realized the anthem of the year with ""Young Lions"".  Nine
    of this album's songs also feature members of the Kindercore-y Royal City, whose recent plaintive cover
    of ""Is This It"" is more interesting than the attempts of fellow Stroke-tenders Vitamin C, Detroit Cobras,
    Ryan Adams, Los Hermanos and Starsailor.  Vermue's also found an able backup singer in painter Kit Malo,
    whose cover-art portrait of a featureless duo glowering at pastries sets up this album's twin tones of
    androgyny and sickening sweetness.</p><p>
    
    Vermue's stage name harks archly to the dozens of prissy wrestlers who were named Gentleman So-and-so.
    Though the word has also been cast as a euphemism for high-class homosexuals as well as male prostitutes,
    it could also simply mean ""gentle man"" in Vermue's case, since his music tests one's tolerance for the
    upper spectrum of fey wispiness. Nothing about Vermue's outing himself necessarily ghetto-izes his music
    (though he can sound like the gay-and-proud David McAlmont), because for every lisp, bit of lyrical
    shorthand, or overt reference to homosexuality, he aims for the universal elegance of hetero softies
    such as Stuart Murdoch and the late Elliott Smith (""Hard to Speak"" could have been gutted from the
    midsection of <i>Either/Or</i>).</p><p>
    
    At his best, Vermue's vocals suggest white soul: a funkless Prince here, the most effeminate moments of
    interchangeable D'Angelos there. Still others will hear less-depressed echoes of the disputed sexuality
    of Nick Drake (please remember to spare your urinal neighbor the ""Pink Moon"" and ""Fruit Tree"" jokes). In
    fact, what the listener might initially consider tee-hee-ness is often just a general seductive pose that
    Vermue's vocals strike, similar to that come-hither quality that makes Vince Vaughn seem gay on the cover
    of <i>Esquire</i> even though he's surely thinking of last night's acrobatic, girl-stacked, purgatorial
    sixsome.</p><p>
    
    A tremendous EP is buried inside this album, though I had to own the thing a year before I could sort it
    out (Vermue admits in interviews that his music requires a ""commitment""). ""Statement"" tiptoes around
    sexuality's relationship to identity, set to an if-Joan-of-Arc-were-optimistic arrangement. ""Give Me the
    Chance to Fall"" is a fine melodramatic crooner, complete with ""Brimful of Asha""-style chords and claps
    that beg the question of why the hell humans beat their hands together to show approval. ""Make Me Pretty""
    risks intimating a coy Cat Stevens, but the piano and the confident chorus save it. ""You're So Alone""
    bounces on Belle-Sab organ to its omnisexual conclusions. ""Heat"" is a damn fine slow-jam about seasonal
    modes of coupling, despite its <i>Dawson's Creek</i> aftertaste. ""Bless This Heart"" dips Hank Williams
    histrionics in Boy George daintitudes, resulting in a genre- and gender-bender on par with <i>Fargo</i>'s
    inversions of maternity and noir authority. ""Anthem for Self-Confidence"" wins with humor, as the speaker
    insists that he is his intended's destiny, despite his obvious insecurities and disbelief in that whole
    destiny charade.</p><p>
    
    Pity, then, that the album's six other tracks are a touch precious and adolescently hyper-self-referential.
    Failing to remember the Creative Writing 101 mandates of Ezra Pound (""make it new"") and Emily Dickinson
    (""tell it slant""), they sound too much like blog entries, reeking of fraudulent privation. Clarinets can't
    save their romanticism from <i>Sex and the City</i> superficiality. Reg Vermue has since recorded an
    anti-war tune (""Bombs in Baghdad""); one wishes that more songs on this album were so unfragile, or were
    at least as interesting as their author's frosted eyebrows.</p></div>"|3629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3629-make-me-pretty/|6.4|William Bowers

    consistently pull off Portastatic, his ever-self-modifying alter ego.  The guise has long provided him an
    outlet for his more experimental urges, offering shifting band lineups, quirky narrative devices, and an
    undemocratic opportunity for him to orchestrate loads of unpredicted blips.</p><p>
    
    McCaughan's latest release, <i>Autumn Was a Lark</i>, was initially conceived as a five-song companion EP
    to Portastatic's last full-length, April's <i>Summer of the Shark</i>, but has since been plumped up to
    include no less than <i>nine</i> live-and-acoustic ""bonus tracks.""  The result is a jumble of seemingly
    arbitrary Portastatic tracks: some are new, some are old, some were recorded on-air at college stations,
    some are covers, and some are just weird (e.g. the desperate early-morning voicemail left on McCaughan's
    machine).</p><p>
    
    Rounded out by a handful of tour-tested covers (Badfinger's ""Baby Blue"", Ronnie Lane's ""One for the Road"",
    and two Springsteen tracks, ""Bobby Jean"" from <i>Born in the USA</i> and <i>Asbury Park</i>'s ""Growin' Up"")
    alongside a full-band version of <i>Summer of the Shark</i>'s subdued ""In the Lines"", <i>Autumn</i>
    ultimately sports only one brand new Portastatic song: the surprisingly raucous ""Autumn Got Dark"".</p><p>
    
    Swallowed whole, <i>Autumn Was a Lark</i> can seem sonically disjointed, but it's also an apt representation
    of Portastatic's ever-roaming muse: the first five tracks see McCaughan ably backed by his touring band
    (which includes Aaron Oliva on bass and brother Matt on drums and vocals, plus a few guest players), while
    the closing set has McCaughan accompanied only by his own acoustic guitar strums (which may explain his
    insistence that this half of the record be called a ""bonus"").</p><p>
    
    The division is necessary: based solely on <i>Autumn</i>'s opening romp, it might seem like the once-evident
    aesthetic lines separating Superchunk from Portastatic have completely blurred-- gone are the quirky keyboards
    and string experiments that distinguished early Portastatic records from the more straightforward, guitar-heavy
    Superchunk-- but taken in the context of the album's latter half, it becomes clear that Portastatic is more
    about fiddling with all available methods than establishing aural consistency.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Autumn Got Dark"" hollers back to <i>Summer of the Shark</i>, both lyrically (""So much for the summer
    of the shark/ Autumn got dark so fast"") and thematically (as the band explains in the album's liner notes,
    both songs lament ""a place where just when you think the world's fallen apart, you realize that maybe
    everything's about to get even worse"").  With a distorted wallop of a guitar riff, ""Autumn Got Dark"" is
    an unexpected elegy to September 11th, easily Portastatic's most self-consciously ""rock"" song to date,
    and a cut that lacks, almost entirely, any explicit traces of melancholia. The results are compelling:
    chilling in its rowdiness, ""Autumn Got Dark"" reveals the kind of unfettered glee that goes hand-in-hand
    with having nothing left to lose.</p><p>
    
    The live radio cuts are effectively raw, McCaughan's impassioned caw rising and falling with his whims,
    and serve as a potent counterpart to the more heavily produced studio tracks (especially ""You Know Where
    to Find Me"") also available here. The covers are fairly faithful to their originals, and always
    enthusiastically rendered, if a little underwhelming.</p><p>
    
    Considered in conjunction with Superchunk's latest offering, August's B-sides, singles, and rarities
    double-disc extravaganza <i>Cup of Sand</i>, it might seem like McCaughan has spent the better part
    of his late summer and early fall hocking all the crap buried deep inside his closet.  Happily, this
    particular pile of clutter is worth keeping around.</p></div>"|6419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6419-autumn-was-a-lark/|7.3|Amanda Petrusich

There's the music, and then there's everything else.  The time of day,
    your mood, the room you're in, the person you're sitting with.  Sometimes the ""everything else"" can obscure
    what's happening with the music, other times it can clarify.  In either case, the how and wherefore matter.</p><p>
    
    I knew Twine's self-titled record was good the first time I put it on.  It was clear that Greg Malcolm
    and Chad Mossholder had refined their approach, found what was most interesting about their moody style,
    and amplified it.  But I didn't really <em>hear</em> it until a few weeks later, when hurricane Isabel tore
    through Richmond in late September and my apartment was without electricity for ten days. The night the
    storm hit, my wife and I plugged one of my computer speakers into her Walkman radio so we could listen
    to the news and follow what was happening.  Even as a passive transmitter (no batteries for its amp) the
    speakers made the headphone signal audible as long as we maxxed out the volume.</p><p>
    
    The next evening, after my wife went to bed and as I was reading by the light of a half-dozen candles,
    I plugged my CD Discman into the speaker and put on new Twine. With the Discman cranked to 10, the music
    was loud enough to be heard clearly, but having the internal headphone amp at that level imparted a faint
    halo of distortion.  Which, at that moment, was perfect.  It was completely dark except for the candles,
    even outside my window.  Every house on the block, the streetlights, the traffic light on the corner--
    all were without power.  And Twine sounded like they were being beamed in via shortwave from some place
    halfway around the world.</p><p>
    
    If only everyone could hear this album under those exact conditions (although you might want to skip the
    following morning's bone-chilling shower in a bathroom so dark you can't see your body to wash it), but
    it's not necessary.  All you really need is for the sun to go down.  <em>Twine</em> is a quintessential
    nighttime record, filled with broken transmissions and drones stretching into the vanishing horizon; it's
    the kind of night where an edge of paranoia is cut with flashes of comforting solitary bliss.  You curl up
    to this thing.</p><p>
    
    By customary definition, Twine is an IDM act, but the comparisons that stream through my head when I'm
    listening to this record come from elsewhere.  The beats are nothing alike and Twine haven't a lick of
    hip-hop in them, but I can't help thinking of DJ Shadow's <i>Endtroducing</i>, the way this record uses
    disembodied voices and builds spacious atmosphere brick by brick.  There's also a hint of Stars of the Lid
    in the drones that Twine favor this time out, and cinematic rock a la Godspeed seems somehow related,
    although Twine eschew extreme dynamics, and their only conventional instruments are guitar and piano,
    both of which are treated and looped.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, though, the thread holding <em>Twine</em> together is the voices.  About half the tracks contain
    wordless vocals by Shelly Gracon and Alison Scola, and their contributions are key.  On ""Plectrum"", which
    is built around slowing strummed guitar, the voice is clipped and percussive, where a word is snatched
    from meaning mid-syllable and set looping, giving a feel reminiscent of Laurie Anderson.  Furthering the
    modern music references, ""Plectrum"" combines the sharp punctuation with some Tehillim-style sacred howls.
    In contrast to this art music approach are the ethereal Middle Eastern vocal drones with Taj Mahal reverb
    that snake through the 12-minute ""Kalea Morning"".</p><p>
    
    There are the live vocals, and then there are the words, pinched and compressed by cheap radio transistors,
    which crackle in and fade out almost constantly.  Adding ""lost transmissions"" to brooding electronic
    soundscapes is nothing new, obviously, but there's a subtlety to Twine's approach that makes it work.
    The voices appear and dissolve unexpectedly and the meaning is unclear; what they're actually saying
    doesn't seem terribly important-- the words are another layer in the dark cloud of sound that drifts
    slowly across the record.  On ""Pendant"" an intercepted telephone conversation (an argument, maybe) is
    almost completely drowned out by the throb of electronic percussion.  The track wouldn't be complete
    without it.</p><p>
    
    Since forming in 1999, Twine have averaged a record a year, but their albums seem carefully laid out and
    constructed to work as individual pieces.  They're not tossing tracks willy-nilly at every compilation
    that comes along and then gathering them together as a new CD.  <em>Twine</em> has no killer must-hear

    country found themselves in abundance of the deadly Asiatic projectile, and, smitten with the anger bug,
    threw the stars at anyone and everyone within a Trapper Keeper's reach, thereby ""terrorizing the psyche
    of the free world.""  Perhaps you remember attending-- or being responsible for-- your fourth grade history
    teacher Mr. Colin Jost's untimely funeral.  More than likely, of course, you knew neither Mr. Jost nor
    this epidemic which Providence rockers The Chinese Stars, formed from ex-members of Arab on Radar and
    Six Finger Satellite, claim as their namesake; the only documentation of either's existence is on the
    band's website.
    
    There legitimately was, in 1980s China, a loose collective of radical artists known as The Chinese Stars,
    who subverted Mao's demand for political art by breaking from Chinese art tradition entirely, embracing
    more abstract Western modes, and reclaiming art for art's sake. If this band takes its name from any
    story, it's clearly this one, and yet, the band makes nary a mention of it. Which begs the question:
    are these guys fucking with us?</p><p>
    
    Yes, in every respect. Without even touching upon the music, it's clear that The Chinese Stars don't take
    no shit. Everything from the EP's scarce 14-minute length to the extravagant Chinese-star shape of the
    disc itself (undoubtedly incurring quite a cost to the modest Skin Graft label) is an enormous middle
    finger to standard music industry convention and simple cost efficiency. Like their nominal equivalents,
    The Chinese Stars agree to play by the industry's most basic rules, but beneath this appeasement is the
    most brilliant and passionate of sedition. Simply put, the <i>Turbo Mattress</i> EP is one of the most
    enjoyable and accessible fuck-yous from any musical act this year.</p><p>
<i>Turbo Mattress</i> is home to a relentless barrage of dark and energetic disco-punk hooks and grooves
    reminiscent of Brooklyn's Liars if fronted by a spacy lunatic (spacier than Angus Andrews, I mean). ""Sick
    Machine"" defines the ""balls-out opener,"" with guitarist Paul Vieira stabbing discordant lines atop drummer
    Craig Kureck's no-nonsense bashing.  Vocalist Eric Paul's quirky high sing/speak, meanwhile, sports all
    the rhythmic intensity of Hot Hot Heat's Steve Bays or Luke Jenner of The Rapture, infusing the song with
    convincing urgency when he spouts off such impenetrable gems as ""Don't forget to put that mouth into that
    pocket so we can maintain the evil of your diet."" The cowbells, spastic drumming, and guitar screams of
    ""Loose Traffic"" comprise the breakneck velvet backdrop for even more theatrics, and my favorite Providence
    anti-platitude, ""Your love tastes better with food stamps.""</p><p>
    
    Only twelve minutes have passed by the time The Chinese Stars close with ""The Fastest Horse Yet"", a vaguely
    bluesy downtempo number about growing up in a glue factory and, fittingly, gambling on horse races. It's
    here, at their quirkiest, that the band differentiates themselves from other disco-punk acts: while they
    take part in the scene's signature edginess and angularity, they are also, in contrast, oddly compelling
    lyricists.  It's a sign that this chimerical genre is making progress beyond its simple conflation of two
    musical traditions.  As critics left and right announce the death of rock, this progress is very encouraging.</p></div>"|1725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1725-turbo-mattress-ep/|8.1|Nick Sylvester

    to the constantly scrolling scenery outside.  Every blank stare and sleeping passenger seemed accounted
    for in the violin and piano counterpart, and even the monotonous, anonymous voice announcing ""now approaching...
    Western... Avenue..."" was invited to become a part of the music.  In fact, it almost made the music better.
    Everyone gets to have a few transcendental moments like this in their life, and mine was made possible by
    Rachel's, the Louisville collective some might call neo-classical, others might call post-rock, and I would
    call ambient.</p><p>
<i>Systems/Layers</i> is the band's fifth album, and it's a brilliant ambient musical experience-- you can
    tune it out if you choose and it'll still enhance your surroundings, or you can engage yourself fully and
    allow it to positively hypnotize you.  I had it running through my big, cheap Koss headphones on Chicago's
    Metra commuter rail one morning, and it did just that.  You might remember a Volkswagen commercial from a
    few years back where two people driving down a street notice everything synching up with the music they're
    listening to-- this was like that, only without such obvious signposts as a kickdrum and snare.</p><p>
    
    Though virtually all of <i>Systems/Layers</i> possesses Rachel's characteristic modern chamber ensemble
    sound, there are dozens of field recordings and sampled voices that seep in around the edges, mostly drawn
    from source material sent to the band by friends and fans, and they serve to heighten the immediacy of the
    music and increase its sense of place.  Virtually every song here conjures urban streets and dwellings,
    but each does so with a different set of sources: ""Wouldn't Live Anywhere Else"" takes the more obvious
    route, melding samples of ice cream trucks, children playing, people mumbling, birds, and sirens with the
    sparsest of drones, while ""Esperanza"", a gorgeous, entirely organic chamber piece, manages the same with
    strings and woodwinds.</p><p>
    
    Rachel's cover some new ground here, too, particularly on the strange, percussive ""Reflective Surfaces"",
    which mimics Gamelan music with its interlocking rhythms and semi-melodic contour.  It's odd how well it
    fits amongst the rest of the songs here, but sure enough, the hypnotic effect of the rhythms draws it
    together with the chamber pieces.  The band's singer/songwriter labelmate Shannon Wright lends her pipes
    to ""Last Things Last"", a snow-swept dirge built on Grimes' sparse piano and Eve Miller's rich cello sawing.
    Like any of the other songs on the album, it's impressionistic in intent, and as such, it hangs in the air
    more like a scent than like music.</p><p>
    
    Fans of Rachel's past work should make a concerted effort to hear this, as it stands easily next to any of
    their other albums, and depending on your exact mood, just might sound like their best.  Beyond those already
    initiated, <i>Systems/Layers</i> will appeal to just about anybody who likes beautiful sound or enjoys the
    way great ambient music helps to shape the environment.  Rachel's have crafted an album of undeniable power
    and grace, and if you fall under its spell, you may not want it to end.</p></div>"|11810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11810-systemslayers/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    and expanding within their own perimeters. There are those who rap about rapping, those who ponder the
    meaning of life, and those who pontificate on the finer points of baseball.  In the case of Atmosphere
    and their newest record, <i>Seven's Travels</i>, one thing is immediately apparent: Slug likes to rap
    about girls.</p><p>
    
    Though Slug started out as a rapper's rapper on Atmosphere's 1997 debut, <i>Overcast!</i> (then with
    fellow emcee Spawn), it wasn't until the Slug-centric <i>Lucy Ford</i> EPs that Sean Daley made a pivotal
    query: Why stress multi-syllabic rhymes and true-school sensibility when you can lazily rap about the same
    thing on every song, keep your existing fanbase and exponentially increase your stable of groupies?  It's
    worked well for him since-- at least from a short-term careerist standpoint-- but what remains to be seen
    is how long he can continue successfully milking the formula.</p><p>
    
    From the sound of <i>Seven's Travels</i>, probably not much longer.  Here, Slug tries to create the illusion
    of diverse subject matter by packaging each track differently.  Unfortunately, his shallow agenda couldn't
    be clearer: In personifying an escaped bird as both a girl and a symbol of the American government (""Bird
    Sings Why the Caged I Know""), dating girls with low self-esteem (""Good Times [Sick Pimpin']""), hitting up
    girls backstage on tour (""Cats Van Bags""), and trying to get with girls in unconventional places (""Shoes""),
    Slug plays the role of both the modern misogynist and the sensitive coffee date as a means of appealing to
    both sexual demographics.  It's through this hollow and obvious ploy for universal appreciation that Slug
    truly lives up to his alias.</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, though, Slug unearths his old cleverness; on ""Cats Van Bags"", he's ""navigating through a
    basement that masquerades as a nation/ Practicing [his] acetate masturbation,"" and effortlessly dropping
    elaborate disses: ""there's more said between the lines of your forehead/ Than they could ever try to fine
    print on the inside of that warhead."" But problems even crop up on the album's highlight, ""Always Coming
    Back Home to You"".  Slug opens the track people-watching, but loses control of the narrative when a
    nervous kid ditches a gun with him, and he jumps, from out of nowhere, to ""the clouds ran away, opened
    up the sky/ And one by one, I watched every constellation die.""  It doesn't help that he takes the song
    out singing like a stunted Everlast.</p><p>
    
    The production is a concern, too, since nothing says hit-or-miss better than the words ""produced by Ant.""
    Ant pulled off a masterful cascade of 70s soul sampling earlier this year with Brother Ali's <i>Shadows
    on the Sun</i> but very few beats here are on that level.  Maybe Slug is to blame for the beat selection,
    but instead of the smooth loops and hard, clean percussion of the Brother Ali record, we're treated to
    Ant's trademark abrasive snare drum and urgent, irritating sample chopping.  Beats like the lazy drum
    loop dub of ""Shoes"" and the incredibly lame didgeridoo and whistle show (somewhere, Prince Paul is crying)
    on ""National Disgrace"" make for a less than magnificent aural experience.  Some exceptions stand--
    particularly the fuzz-guitar funk/punk seesaw of ""Cats Van Bags"" and the sizzling 70s soul tidal wave
    of ""Denvemolorado""-- but even then they're on, there's usually something to bring them down: on
    ""Denvemolorado"", Slug raps for one minute and sings the same refrain for another, destroying what
    could've stood as one of his best songs.</p><p>
    
    The core problem with <i>Seven's Travels</i> is that Slug seems to have forgotten just what helped him
    lead his niche to begin with.  The subject matter here is repetitive, pseudo-intellectual pandering runs
    rampant, pointless skits and mid-song dialogue sessions interrupt the flow, and most importantly, wasted
    beats fall at the hands of Slug's newfound penchant for verse-long tracks and poorly realized singsong
    bridges.  At their worst, Slug's emotionally ""deep"" lyrics threaten Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba
    for the title of King of the Self-Important Youth.  He should seek the conceptual balance of labelmate
    Brother Ali and rediscover the highly playable discourse of his former incarnation.</p></div>"|342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/342-sevens-travels/|5.5|Rollie Pemberton

    and clarinetist Michel Mandel.  Fringe music lovers will recognize Chenevier from his infamous rock project
    Etron Fou Leloublan, one of the original RIO bands (Henry Cow, Univers Zero), and from appearing on Fred
    Frith's 1981 <i>Speechless</i> LP.  He also played on one of the first real post-rock records, Vidéo
    Aventures' <i>Musiques Pour Garçons et Filles</i> (1980), reissued on CD in the late 90s and of interest
    to anyone at all into experimental rock.  Chenevier's own work tends to feature angular, top-heavy riffs
    over his own precise, pitter-patter drumming and with a penchant for playful improvisation.  In Etron
    Fou, he worked with sax and guitar or organ in sort of a DIY avant-prog vein; with Volapük the emphasis
    is closer to European folk, albeit highly energetic and sharply dynamic.</p><p>
<i>Where Is Tamashii?</i> is Volapük's fourth record, and second to feature violinist and vocalist Takumi
    Fukushuma (formerly of the brilliant Japanese experimental ensemble After Dinner).  The band specializes
    in an expert fusion of folk, circus music, gypsy dances and sounding like something that would go very
    well over a silent film about murderous clowns.  Fukushuma's occasional vocals also bring a few of the
    songs into a realm similar to Czech vocalist Iva Bittova's eccentric avant-pop.  All of this happens
    without the slightest hint of ""Art,"" though the fact that Chenevier had to pull his musicians from
    classical conservatories should tell you something.  There aren't many bands playing this kind of music,
    but I can say without hyperbole that Volapük is by some measure the best.</p><p>
    Despite the distinctive ingredients that go into Volapük's songs, the best ones are those that aren't
    obviously tied to any particular style.  The title track begins as a cumbersome, yet sweet string-led
    ballad; when Fukushuma's vocals enter it becomes a very odd (and just as alluring) form of café J-pop.
    And just as soon, Mandel hits a deft, repeated figure on bass clarinet suggesting modest chaos is never
    far from this band's minds.  Likewise, ""Impro Cloche"" begins as a kinetic, repetitive math-rock vamp, but
    when the clarinet rears its head, and Chenevier drops his wind-up toy breakbeat, the whole mess transforms
    into a 21st Century version of Raymond Scott's powerhouse big band.  Midway through, a violin wails as if
    being tortured, the rest of the band sneaks out and Chenevier is left to pound out his way with what
    sounds like a can of soup and silverware.  Le awesome.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, Volapük's folk roots shine through, as on ""Boom Boom"" (classical Asian) and ""Pas de Panique""
    (tango/French chamber dance crossing).  On these tunes, their abilities to pull off less intense music are
    obvious, though Chenevier can hardly hide his restless figures for very long.  ""Mission"" begins as
    aggressive pouncing with drums and cello, and adds a fluttering violin to announce its lengthy mid-section
    development.  Chenevier's playing occasionally reminds me of Can's Jaki Liebezeit in the way he translates
    minimal flash into maximum pulse; during the solo section, his playing under Mandel's low-key, slightly
    Klezmer-influenced solo is admirably restrained.  The gradually work up an intense dialogue, even with
    Mandel doubling himself with another solo at the same time, yet never approaching anything close to
    skronk.</p><p>
    Volapük's previous three records were released on the Cuneiform imprint, which should give yet another
    idea of what to expect for anyone familiar with that label's roster.  As it happens, the band is much
    more accessible than their pedigree might lead one to believe, though that might come down to the
    crispness of their arrangements.   I can say that music at once as joyous, strange and accomplished is
    few and far between, so with any luck this catches on outside their small circle of fans.  Chenevier's
    projects can always stand more exposure, and <i>Where Is Tamashii?</i> is on par with the best of them.</p></div>"|8517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8517-where-is-tamashii/|8.2|Dominique Leone

When we're not calling them the
    Hendrixes of hip-hop, we're calling them the Van Halens. We, the Jealous Reviewers, have secluded them to
    the fringes of society while feigning to respect them as the bedrock of modern music. For me, and people
    like me, all DJs are, or should be, crazy block-rocking pyrotechnic experimental explosion collage artists,
    hellbent on throwing down flammable hardcore funkfests, and nothing but. For the hip-hop and indie rock
    elite, you're a good DJ if you can move the cueing lever with your tongue or light your fader on fire.
    This raises the question: Could there be an acoustic DJ?  A Simon and Garfunkel DJ?</p><p>
    
    No.  Anyway, here we are. Kid Koala's new album. Ever since he hit the streets on the vanguard of the
    ""DJ contortionists"" with his track on <i>Return of the DJ 2</i> in '97, Kid Koala has been at the forefront
    of instrumental DJ brilliance, with a sense of playfulness somewhere between the Invisibl Skratch Piklz and
    Cut Chemist. On his new rock-and-then-suddenly-stop half-hour album, <i>Some of My Best Friends Are DJs</i>,
    Koala sheds his former persona almost completely, with its tracks focusing more on structure, tone, and mood
    than how fast he can scratch.  <i>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</i> suggested this preoccupation, but there are
    virtually no discernible ""tick-a-tick-a"" sounds or mind-melting juggling here. It's a crackling, wooden
    excess of inebriated brass and meandering sideways bass. The predominant instruments are softly strummed
    ukulele and acoustic guitar. It's like a busking bossa nova Deltron 3030.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Basin Street Blues"", is a startling scramble of subtle moderation for a DJ.  First of all,
    it actually <i>is</i> the 1928 Spencer Williams standard ""Basin Street Blues"", which makes it one of the
    best (if not one of the <i>only</i>) DJ cover songs.  A languishing bass starts buzzing, percussive
    acoustic guitar drums up, and the melody is taken by a sleepy trombone that falls into dilapidated moaning.
    It's a speakeasy DJ, performing for cotton pennies minted in the flapper era, watching the grime, poverty,
    and a parade.  The beat keeps trying to jump into the morass only to shyly wander away.  There are the
    requisite goofy samples, of course, but it's all rather seamless; this is more a composition than a mix.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Skanky Panky"" is like Tom Waits doing ska using your mom's easy listening killing fields and
    some convulsive funk. ""Robochacha"" is a robot learning how to dance.  And I'm not just going David Fricke
    on the Pfork.  That's what the song <i>tells</i> us it's about.  Even my sordid heart and vexatious mind
    must surrender to a dancing robot song.</p><p>
    
    The problem is, if the songwriting falls flat on an enterprise like this, there's no turntable pummeling
    to entertain you in languid spots. ""Annie's Parlor"" and ""Vacation Island"" are far from boring or overtly
    gimmicky, but the jazzy piano riffs and brass solos don't seem to be quite as well placed or stretched.
    ""Stompin' at Le Savoi"" has a decent beat and some grunting horn, but it never evolves, merely tracing
    innumerable loops around its sample.</p><p>
    
    I might add in passing that rarely has a musician seemed less interested in his music than Kid Koala. This
    album comes with enhanced CD, a lengthy comic book, and a cut-out chess set, as well as a snide criticism
    of people like me (""free comic book + CD with this travel-size chess game""). In many ways, <i>Some of My
    Best Friends Are DJs</i> is little more than a brief comedy album, filled with strange samples of eccentric
    characters pontificating on their record collections and audio systems. You can either accept this as a
    sort of endearing (or perhaps sort of affably lazy) quality that shows he's in the game for fun, or you can
    wish he would stop jerking us around and fulfill his artistic potential. For some people, this tension will
    be a radical reinterpretation of turntable culture. Personally, I could do without coughing beatboxes and
    koala flatulence. Kid Koala is capable of making some of the best songs (and albums) in hip-hop.  He knows
    it.  We know it.  His liner notes know it.  The anticipation is abominable.  He's three-quarters there.</p></div>"|4415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4415-some-of-my-best-friends-are-djs/|7.4|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    Living Will Never Die</i>, though I've exfoliated triumphantly in a clawfoot tub to Don Cab's <i>American
    Don</i>, and though the post-hardcore fusion of Guinness-world-record hopefuls Hella astounds me, I can
    barely bring myself to spend money on the stuff, which makes being a promo-entitled critic pretty bitchin'.
    If you can't admit that a large proportion of vocal-less CDs wallow in Louisville/Chicago plodnamics, then
    you must live in a library or a sex lounge. Which is, of course, a way of saying that these albums best
    befit either studying or, as PG movies in the 80s would say, the making of whoopee.</p><p>
    
    The borderlands minimalism of Bexar Bexar seems to subvert the limitations of instru-pop via variety and
    hypnotic (but not numbing) repetition. Their sound is as urbane as it is provincial, equal parts Fennesz
    and Jay Farrar's score for <i>The Slaughter Rule</i>.  I'd normally flinch at how Bexar Bexar hints rather
    than goads, falling in line with instru-pop's creed of circuitousness, but they are the rare act that
    pulls off being scions of Mick Turner pedal-flexing and Martin Gore echo-sonics, and so subtly that they
    make Calexico's vocal-less numbers seem Limp Biskitesque.</p><p>
    
    ""Aidos"" forges a gorgeous Frankensong out of laptoppery and sentimental guitar, suggesting a sublimi-core
    U2. Any rookie Ghostbuster could detect Jeff Tweedy's desire to strum over the blip-loops and hesitant
    piano of ""Where She Lives Every Day"".  The Flintstones percussion of ""Esther's Vice"" entrances the listener
    as the plucking rises and fades in the mix, silencing anyone whose previous position on instru-pop was
    ""Hey mang, wake me when Cerberus Shoal is finished.""</p><p>
    
    Full truth-in-advertising legislation would require that Bexar Bexar label their disc with a warning that
    it might take people back to that one particular adolescent autumn when sports seemed spiritual and the
    prom seemed like performance art. Their whittled sound is a Battlefield:Earth between synthesizers and
    six-strings in which no winner is declared. Only their late-blooming, pokier compositions lend credence
    to the idea that instru-pop is a tad Cirque de Soleil, or for people bored with debating how Philip Glass'
    symphony of David Bowie's <i>Low</i> ripped off his own <i>Mishima</i> soundtrack. Consciously fending off
    instru-pop dismissals by flouting how much they are loved by NPR's <i>This American Life</i> may be a
    poncey-bunk move, but a quick consultation of Bexar Bexar's ""Red R.O.T"" and ""Blue R.O.T"" should qualify
    them to accompany the day that cancer is considered a natural cause.</p></div>"|1089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1089-haralambos/|7.8|William Bowers

    Though it's admittedly pretty difficult deciphering all the banality over the ""blistering"" harmonica, it
    seems likely that The Animals or Rolling Stones had a bigger influence on Shelverton's raucous approach
    to white-boy blues than Vollmann's dissection of traumatic desire.  With a boring EP on GSL and two similarly
    dull albums on Sub Pop, Vue haven't changed things up much for their RCA debut. Lacking the hooks or pop
    sensibility of labelmates The Strokes, the quintet is an undistinguished yawn with semi-expensive haircuts.
    (Maybe they should've mentioned Jackie Collins in the press kit?)</p><p>
    
    At this point, you'd figure a baker's dozen of Hives sound-alikes would be enough, right?  Nope: <i>Down
    for Whatever</i> proudly stands up and asks the listener to accept yet another. Dribbling out of the gate
    with ""She's Sweet"", an ""energetic"" three-minute pop song that could just as easily have been written by any
    other post-Estrus band haunting sartorial-linked labels like Dim Mak or Sympathy for the Record Industry,
    the comfy sameness of the attack continues for the album's remaining eleven tracks. In fact, the band never
    once steps outside the genre's most watered-down tropes-- not even to go to the bathroom.  To be fair, if
    you enjoy the other examples of this pre-fab genre, then I'm sure the Vue ransack the checklist adequately:
    the catchy ""Look Out for Traffic"" is the most <i>Is This It</i> of the batch, while the title track harnesses
    a snarky rock 'n' roll rebelliousness built on fuzzed-out braggadocio (""'Cause I'm down for whatevaaaah
    feels bad!""), and a wee smidgen of romantic new-wave seeps-in during ""Take Two Kisses"".</p><p>
    
    Thinking optimistically, as I'm wont to do, maybe the random mention of Vollmann will turn a bookish rocker
    kid onto one of America's most idiosyncratic and ambitious writers. If that's the case, <i>Down for Whatever</i>
    will prove a valuable tool, richer in use value than its lackluster merits would otherwise suggest. While
    a hack-job rarely adds up to much once the label's money's gone and a new trend lodges itself in the mind
    of tireless hipsters, Vollmann's repeatedly beautiful dissection of commerce, colonialism, and love should
    survive. And, yeah, he's so much more punk rock than these cats, regardless of his unintentionally geeky
    glasses and 5th-grade bowl haircut.</p></div>"|8505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8505-down-for-whatever/|4.4|Brandon Stosuy

    now inked to Los Angeles-based indie Big Wheel Recreation, the band have released <i>Don't Make Things</i>,
    a strikingly uneasy collection of songs that reflect, almost perfectly, the band's apparent distrust of
    the future.</p><p>
    
    The Pleased can be a surprisingly dark outfit, considering how many of these songs sound, at first listen,
    like perfectly danceable new-new-wave hits. A few additional spins, however, promptly reveal <i>Don't Make
    Things</i> as a record teeming with the threat of impending explosion: the album plays like a thick, vaguely
    melancholy exaltation of right now, wherein all glee is fleeting, tempered by a far grimmer appraisal of
    tomorrow. The Pleased's brand of joy is hinged, inextricably, on the notion that shit's gonna fall apart,
    and soon.  As opener ""Already Gone"" posits, ""I know it looked so nice in the evening/ But now that the
    sun's up again/ We're better off alone.""  The resulting work is palpably tense, with dodgy guitar, soulful
    vocals, and plenty of detached urban cool.</p><p>
    
    Before you start conjuring images of Interpol, know this: at least superficially, The Pleased seem to take
    a lot of same sonic cues as Coldplay (both bands have made careers out of channeling the moody theatrics
    of the Bunnymen, and vocalist Noah Georgeson's sweet, undulating howl is easily comparable to Chris Martin's
    round yelps). Still, The Pleased are far less earnest crusaders, avoiding Coldplay's open sentimentality in
    favor of sneaky whispering-- a trade which may be tied into their instrument choices: check the shifty
    keyboards sliding in where Coldplay's precious piano might have gone.  Ultimately, The Pleased end up
    being more accurately aligned with tourmates The Walkmen, and it's not surprising that the band are so
    often mistaken as members of the recent New York City influx-- they've got quite a bit of slink in their
    gait.</p><p>
    
    Vocalists Georgeson and Rich Good routinely trade mic duties, and the haunting, bass-heavy ""No Style"" sees
    them engaged in an especially compelling battle of wits, their call-and-response bellows skewing slightly
    confrontational.  ""We are the Doctor"" is a rich, sprawling guitar-rock song, reminiscent of <i>The Bends</i>-era
    Radiohead, while the album's title track (aside from hosting the remarkably cutting couplet, ""You don't
    try but I know why/ You don't make things"") is a taut jab, with mixed-down vocals and loads of jumpy
    percussion.  The Pleased are obviously convinced of their own righteousness, and appropriately so--
    <i>Don't Make Things</i> is an impressive offering, full of well-realized moments of panic and resignation.
    Be glad they make things.</p></div>"|6528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6528-dont-make-things/|7.7|Amanda Petrusich

    Aesop Rock is having trouble adjusting to fame.  Just a few short years ago, Ian Bavitz was still selling
    his own handmade CD-Rs on the streets of New York, but it didn't take long for him to find his way into the
    spotlight: his groundbreaking Def Jux album <i>Labor Days</i> was an instant underground smash.  Now, in the
    face of label inconsistency and heightened expectations, his new album, <i>Bazooka Tooth</i>, shows him
    struggling with the pressures of the media and a rapidly growing fanbase.</p><p>
    
    Aesop Rock's abstract lyricism and gravel throat have earned him critical acclaim and a rabid following,
    but he's no longer just a Long Island poet-cum-cipher slayer, and some of the changes he's made to his
    style on <i>Bazooka Tooth</i> are drawing attention.  Bavitz spent the early part of his career tied to
    a sluggish, steady delivery, but here, he's upgraded his style from a nicotine-tinged calm to a more
    natural, accessible flow.  Now attacking his beats with a mix of nervous energy and raw confidence, the
    new Aesop Rock cracks, lisps, bends his pitch, and most importantly, confronts his listeners rather than
    choosing to subtly persuade them.</p><p>
    
    His delivery isn't all that's changed; there's been a shift in subject matter, too, as this album sees
    Bavitz branching out from the singular topic of <i>Labor Days</i> to a variety of subjects, including the
    emergence of young killers (""Babies with Guns""), fondness for his home state (""N.Y. Electric"", ""No Jumper
    Cables""), and disillusionment with the media (""Bazooka Tooth"", ""Easy"")-- and all while offering his usual
    mix of hard-edged rhyme schemes (""Park your bets, sharks or jets/ It's bark marked targets where the
    barnacles nest"") and clever idioms (""They burrow deep under the carnivore's flesh, without a trace/
    Carnival games, like try to shoot the star out of his space"").</p><p>
    
    The track with the most buzz so far is also the one that has the least to do with Aesop's personal life:
    ""We're Famous"" features Def Jux CEO El-P in what serves as a company mission statement, Demigodz diss,
    and subterranean ""Grindin'"" response all in one.  Cycling through harsh jackhammer synth stabs, toy gun
    alien abduction crescendos, and a crunk funk handclap-assisted drum line, El-Producto lambasts critics
    claiming ""hip-hop's over,"" disses Esoteric (""You ain't a vet, you're just old""; ""Some of these faggots
    used to send me their demos/ Breeding their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels"") and closes the
    verse with, ""I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerd rap/ I'm making this money fist over fist,
    fuck what you heard.""  Aesop doesn't let the topic drop, claiming, ""The revolution will not be apologized
    for,"" and, ""B-boy, feed that to the needy/ Check your liquor hole, fuck you in 3-D, easy.""  The one-two
    combination makes for one of the most addictive diss tracks this side of Jay-Z's classic ""The Takeover"".</p><p>
    
    Most of the early disappointment regarding <i>Bazooka Tooth</i> came as a result of Aesop's decision to
    self-produce the record.  While the Blockhead and El-P compositions stand out as the work of professional,
    time-tested beatmakers, Aesop's production style has a loose, raw intensity of electronic emotion that
    hearkens back to Company Flow and early Tricky.  From the windy stadium synth-wave rocker ""No Jumper
    Cables"" to the city-stomping drum march and twisted gypsy vocal sample pan of ""Frijoles"" to the boogie
    synth, clanging staircase sample and (in the second movement) Atlanta hi-hat crunch of ""Mars Attacks"",
    Bavitz evolves from the one-dimensional sample work in which he once dabbled, and makes the step into
    the realm of mentionable producer.</p><p>
    
    The transition, however, isn't completely smooth, with some of the interludes adding dead weight, a couple
    of songs failing to stand out among the pack (""Super Fluke"", ""N.Y. Electric""), some unremarkable beats,
    and a few unrealized conceptual possibilities limiting the total ascension of neo-Rock.  Fortunately,
    the album has more than enough solid material to keep heads coming back again and again.  No big surprise:
    <i>Bazooka Tooth</i> is another strong outing from one of underground hip-hop's most talented, thanks in
    no small part to its unprecedented wealth of lyrical depth and individual production style.</p></div>"|66.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/66-bazooka-tooth/|8.2|Rollie Pemberton

My first exposure to the band came nearly seven years ago, and it's weird to have     that same 1998 debut album before me once again in a glossier, non-self-released edition.  With a slightly     separated remastering revealing the sharp edges of Cisco Ryder's restrained cymbals, Bill McCullough's     smoky and swooping pedal steel, and John Brewington's rumbling bass, the debut remains as breathtaking     as the first time I saw them, the solemn pacing of the disc as sure as a southern gentleman's gait, a     Texas Two-Step, or Leatherface's limp (which may all be the same walk).</p>
<p>From the opening breath of their epic signature song, ""One Sound"", the whispered vocals and lonesome     reverberations of guitarist Aaron Blount and the harmonic siren song and Baptist organ undertow of     girlfriend Laura Krause suck me under. Their voices lace together like star-crossed white trash to     stir up Blount's tales of the dark, silty bottom of the hick id. His tales drift between the honky-tonking     body choppery of ""I Sent You Up"", to the more nuanced and character-driven dirge of ""Married Woman"", and     back into more expansive moments of barren countryside dread for ""Norma"".</p>
<p>""Come on Cotton"" and ""Swallows"",     meanwhile, jangle just enough Galaxie 500 to keep the disc from slicing into the nearby wrist veins, but     the abandoning sneer of ""Muse"" is downright cruel, and even that pales next to the album's most chilling     track, ""Careening"", which reveals the band's oceanic depths. A haunting epic of bodily disintegration down     in the greasy Gulf of Mexico, the drowning mind of the narrator spins final memories of kitchenettes,     distant offspring, and spousal repugnance as the song drifts apart in waves of cymbal and the disembodied     groans of Laura Krause, the tom and single bass tones ebbing like the tides.</p>
<p>If anything, their debut reminds me of the Coen Brothers' <i>Blood Simple</i>, with just a few rough     elements sketching out the tragic folk and wronged lovers. Burning trailers, severed ears, hatchbacked     wrecks along the highway, taps of unhooked screen doors-- these gruesome images flicker along with the     entwined throats of the two singers.  This edition tacks on a single recorded for Western Vinyl, which     sounds lifted from the wax itself. ""Slavery"" is as standard as a Knife in the Water song can get, but     ""Redbird"" is stripped to barely touched guitar and rattle.  Here, the lovers assuage each other in the     burnt-out remnants of the mobile, caressing their betrothed with broken bottles of Lone Star.</p>
<p><i>Red River</i> somehow does their debut one better.  The increased maturity here permeates everything:     it's achingly slow Caesarian scars and bags under the eyes, and achingly slow movement; it's crow's feet     and Hepatitis C and night sweats in the August air.  A heavier drinking problem and taste for the harder     stuff.  The collated visions of the indescribable nights in South Texas are now recurring nightmare reruns     at 3:00 a.m., the mini-thins still going strong as the TV irradiates the apartment with a ghostly blue     light.</p>
<p>This time around the band sounds completely fleshed out; Bill McCullough's steel swells with feedback on     ""Watch Your Back"", bludgeon in hand, or else sketches out the spacious Hill Country on ""Machine to Tulsa"".     Cisco Ryder brushes the drums like swaying wheat from <i>Days of Heaven</i>, now crackling and snapping,     now burning bright like a blaze. Laura Krause's organ playing has greater elasticity, and her supporting     voice takes on more roles, from comforting nurse to hoary tranny-talk, along the way evoking Patsy Cline's     ""baum baums"" as well as Nancy Sinatra's velvety lines. (The latter, of course, isn't a surprising influence,     as the band make the Nancy and Lee Hazlewood gem ""Sundown, Sundown"" their own here.)</p>
<p>Blount's damned characters and purgatorial locales fall into even in sharper relief. ""Rene"" sits in a     topless bar parking lot on the South side of town, a handgun in her lap, while visions of shooting her     abusive lover in the face writhe before her eyes. A nameless transsexual washes up in ""Young Blood in     the River"". The woozy ""Party (for the People of the Open Wound)"" pops pills and chugs keg beer on the     east side of I-35 along with all the other revelers.  This bleary-eyed chem delirium, conveyed with the     sparsest of brush hits, string strokes, and breathless harmonizing, exemplifies what the band does best.</p>
<p>The last two songs, much as on the debut, serve as successive pinnacles of this sustained sound tension     and bare narrative vision. The narcotic effects of the music and swirls of steel only appear to alleviate     on ""Broad Daylight"", instead letting the ghastly images of botched amputations and sexual denigration     twist about in the song, between the multiple meanings of ""coming to/too."" Original album-ender ""Nightingales     for Evelyn"" involves box-cutter-sliced kids and splattered bird feathers lilting over a slow waltz,     drifting into a dark puddle of blood beneath as ""visions of glory collide.""</p>
<p>Besides a poetic blurt by Bowers' beloved David Berman, the label has added to this reissue another single     from around the period of the album's release: ""2 Spades"" and ""Sunset Motel"" are presented in reverse order,     presumably to make the disc more cohesive. The B-side leans into some jerky-meat rockabilly recounting     shallow graves and Russian roulette, while the latter is a pulpy seven minutes of organ gnashing, steel     slashing, and motel murder mystery.</p>
<p>This all sets the table for the latest from the group, <i>Cut the Cord</i>.  Five years on from their debut,     their country overtones are subdued, palpable more in the songs added for the U.S. release than in the     album proper. Aside from McCullough's continued steel contributions, only Blount and Krause remain intact,     the rhythm section completely overhauled. Perhaps that's what makes the songs feel somewhat more stiff at     the start, although as ""The Very Air"" plays through, it makes more sense. Reverberating thwacks and     trickling lines of pedal shift into drive with the bass and drums and the measures are more propulsive     and less lateral landscape. ""Village Fireworks"" mingles a booming bass drum with shimmering metallophones     and Doppler organs as the two singers whisper a curse for the city that's ""fucked itself."" ""Massacre""     feverishly strums a guitar and a snare-rattling march as yet another drowning occurs between the minute     details: ""No termites in the rafters/ Needles stay upon the trees/ And lilies on the water/ She doesn't     feel as heavy as she imagined.""</p>
<p>Blount's songwriting has taken a turn for the more abstract and less Nowhere, USA noir. The readily-evoked     highways and CrimeStopper scenes get replaced by temporal fireworks, sacrificial tigers, and lighthouses     to the blind. ""Biltmora Children"" sketches out a tale of three children abandoned to the elements where     ""bloodbait brings a strangeness to the wild.""  The meanings remain vague, but the menace below the     song-surface is still palpable, rippling like murder weapons in shallow water. The cello-kissed ""Warped     Pearls"" is uncrackable: ""Mother moth cocoon becomes a bloody mess/ Lights between the trees drinking     antifreeze."" All visual movement exists inside the heads of its characters now, filled with broken (and     non-sensical) hallucinations that no longer tell their tales from the outside.</p>
<p>""My Skin Covers the Waterfront"" wavers between images of Frankenstein and Ed Gein-stitched skin, but most     mysterious is ""Golden Calf Highway"", a road trip between <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> and <i>Badlands</i>.     It begins with a ""Wagon Wheel""-type of loping cowboy beat while the singer, in death throes, sees young     girls out the window ""running naked in the rain/ Sawed off blows buckshot through the hay.../ Air warped     by gasoline/ June bugs giving up in May/ Carcasses dot the golden calf highway."" The lights grow increasingly     dim as evil electronics and distorted blood drips rise up and overtake the disc in a bath of noise.</p>
<p>Pack 'em in as a band with that whole No Depression crowd, or other purveyors of Americana that dabble in     that other great folk form (country music), which can include The Mekons, Nick Cave, Low, Palace, Califone,     Calexico, The Handsome Family, Chicagoans and New Mexicans or whomever, their songs shine through like     switchblades in the bar neon. How long can it be till Willie or Steve Earle is singing ""I Sent You Up""?     Three albums in, the couple evoke country's great duos, be it George and Tammy or Gram Parsons and Emmylou     Harris, while also cutting a swath down South distinctly their own. Knife in the Water resonate with their     own Texas twang and taint, burying clues and loads of bloody evidence in their wake.</p></div>"|11770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11770-plays-one-sound-and-others-red-river-cut-the-cord/|8.4|Andy Beta

My first exposure to the band came nearly seven years ago, and it's weird to have     that same 1998 debut album before me once again in a glossier, non-self-released edition.  With a slightly     separated remastering revealing the sharp edges of Cisco Ryder's restrained cymbals, Bill McCullough's     smoky and swooping pedal steel, and John Brewington's rumbling bass, the debut remains as breathtaking     as the first time I saw them, the solemn pacing of the disc as sure as a southern gentleman's gait, a     Texas Two-Step, or Leatherface's limp (which may all be the same walk).</p>
<p>From the opening breath of their epic signature song, ""One Sound"", the whispered vocals and lonesome     reverberations of guitarist Aaron Blount and the harmonic siren song and Baptist organ undertow of     girlfriend Laura Krause suck me under. Their voices lace together like star-crossed white trash to     stir up Blount's tales of the dark, silty bottom of the hick id. His tales drift between the honky-tonking     body choppery of ""I Sent You Up"", to the more nuanced and character-driven dirge of ""Married Woman"", and     back into more expansive moments of barren countryside dread for ""Norma"".</p>
<p>""Come on Cotton"" and ""Swallows"",     meanwhile, jangle just enough Galaxie 500 to keep the disc from slicing into the nearby wrist veins, but     the abandoning sneer of ""Muse"" is downright cruel, and even that pales next to the album's most chilling     track, ""Careening"", which reveals the band's oceanic depths. A haunting epic of bodily disintegration down     in the greasy Gulf of Mexico, the drowning mind of the narrator spins final memories of kitchenettes,     distant offspring, and spousal repugnance as the song drifts apart in waves of cymbal and the disembodied     groans of Laura Krause, the tom and single bass tones ebbing like the tides.</p>
<p>If anything, their debut reminds me of the Coen Brothers' <i>Blood Simple</i>, with just a few rough     elements sketching out the tragic folk and wronged lovers. Burning trailers, severed ears, hatchbacked     wrecks along the highway, taps of unhooked screen doors-- these gruesome images flicker along with the     entwined throats of the two singers.  This edition tacks on a single recorded for Western Vinyl, which     sounds lifted from the wax itself. ""Slavery"" is as standard as a Knife in the Water song can get, but     ""Redbird"" is stripped to barely touched guitar and rattle.  Here, the lovers assuage each other in the     burnt-out remnants of the mobile, caressing their betrothed with broken bottles of Lone Star.</p>
<p><i>Red River</i> somehow does their debut one better.  The increased maturity here permeates everything:     it's achingly slow Caesarian scars and bags under the eyes, and achingly slow movement; it's crow's feet     and Hepatitis C and night sweats in the August air.  A heavier drinking problem and taste for the harder     stuff.  The collated visions of the indescribable nights in South Texas are now recurring nightmare reruns     at 3:00 a.m., the mini-thins still going strong as the TV irradiates the apartment with a ghostly blue     light.</p>
<p>This time around the band sounds completely fleshed out; Bill McCullough's steel swells with feedback on     ""Watch Your Back"", bludgeon in hand, or else sketches out the spacious Hill Country on ""Machine to Tulsa"".     Cisco Ryder brushes the drums like swaying wheat from <i>Days of Heaven</i>, now crackling and snapping,     now burning bright like a blaze. Laura Krause's organ playing has greater elasticity, and her supporting     voice takes on more roles, from comforting nurse to hoary tranny-talk, along the way evoking Patsy Cline's     ""baum baums"" as well as Nancy Sinatra's velvety lines. (The latter, of course, isn't a surprising influence,     as the band make the Nancy and Lee Hazlewood gem ""Sundown, Sundown"" their own here.)</p>
<p>Blount's damned characters and purgatorial locales fall into even in sharper relief. ""Rene"" sits in a     topless bar parking lot on the South side of town, a handgun in her lap, while visions of shooting her     abusive lover in the face writhe before her eyes. A nameless transsexual washes up in ""Young Blood in     the River"". The woozy ""Party (for the People of the Open Wound)"" pops pills and chugs keg beer on the     east side of I-35 along with all the other revelers.  This bleary-eyed chem delirium, conveyed with the     sparsest of brush hits, string strokes, and breathless harmonizing, exemplifies what the band does best.</p>
<p>The last two songs, much as on the debut, serve as successive pinnacles of this sustained sound tension     and bare narrative vision. The narcotic effects of the music and swirls of steel only appear to alleviate     on ""Broad Daylight"", instead letting the ghastly images of botched amputations and sexual denigration     twist about in the song, between the multiple meanings of ""coming to/too."" Original album-ender ""Nightingales     for Evelyn"" involves box-cutter-sliced kids and splattered bird feathers lilting over a slow waltz,     drifting into a dark puddle of blood beneath as ""visions of glory collide.""</p>
<p>Besides a poetic blurt by Bowers' beloved David Berman, the label has added to this reissue another single     from around the period of the album's release: ""2 Spades"" and ""Sunset Motel"" are presented in reverse order,     presumably to make the disc more cohesive. The B-side leans into some jerky-meat rockabilly recounting     shallow graves and Russian roulette, while the latter is a pulpy seven minutes of organ gnashing, steel     slashing, and motel murder mystery.</p>
<p>This all sets the table for the latest from the group, <i>Cut the Cord</i>.  Five years on from their debut,     their country overtones are subdued, palpable more in the songs added for the U.S. release than in the     album proper. Aside from McCullough's continued steel contributions, only Blount and Krause remain intact,     the rhythm section completely overhauled. Perhaps that's what makes the songs feel somewhat more stiff at     the start, although as ""The Very Air"" plays through, it makes more sense. Reverberating thwacks and     trickling lines of pedal shift into drive with the bass and drums and the measures are more propulsive     and less lateral landscape. ""Village Fireworks"" mingles a booming bass drum with shimmering metallophones     and Doppler organs as the two singers whisper a curse for the city that's ""fucked itself."" ""Massacre""     feverishly strums a guitar and a snare-rattling march as yet another drowning occurs between the minute     details: ""No termites in the rafters/ Needles stay upon the trees/ And lilies on the water/ She doesn't     feel as heavy as she imagined.""</p>
<p>Blount's songwriting has taken a turn for the more abstract and less Nowhere, USA noir. The readily-evoked     highways and CrimeStopper scenes get replaced by temporal fireworks, sacrificial tigers, and lighthouses     to the blind. ""Biltmora Children"" sketches out a tale of three children abandoned to the elements where     ""bloodbait brings a strangeness to the wild.""  The meanings remain vague, but the menace below the     song-surface is still palpable, rippling like murder weapons in shallow water. The cello-kissed ""Warped     Pearls"" is uncrackable: ""Mother moth cocoon becomes a bloody mess/ Lights between the trees drinking     antifreeze."" All visual movement exists inside the heads of its characters now, filled with broken (and     non-sensical) hallucinations that no longer tell their tales from the outside.</p>
<p>""My Skin Covers the Waterfront"" wavers between images of Frankenstein and Ed Gein-stitched skin, but most     mysterious is ""Golden Calf Highway"", a road trip between <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> and <i>Badlands</i>.     It begins with a ""Wagon Wheel""-type of loping cowboy beat while the singer, in death throes, sees young     girls out the window ""running naked in the rain/ Sawed off blows buckshot through the hay.../ Air warped     by gasoline/ June bugs giving up in May/ Carcasses dot the golden calf highway."" The lights grow increasingly     dim as evil electronics and distorted blood drips rise up and overtake the disc in a bath of noise.</p>

    to take Kenna aboard his inappropriately named Flawless imprint, anyway.  After Puddle of Mudd, I'd assumed
    Durst would be court-ordered to remain a minimum 500 feet away from music at all times (Limp Bizkit, of
    course, would be allowed to continue on the premise that they had transcended even the loosest definition
    of the word).</p><p>
    
    What?  Tired potshots at career punchlines like Durst not your idea of music criticism?  Then let me be
    more direct: the only other remarkable thing about Kenna's music is the inherent supposition that his
    audience has never heard Depeche Mode.  His stock 80s Casio beats may be updated with enough 21st Century
    stop/start glitchcraft to keep a tenuous hold on the present (the album cover itself proudly proclaims that
    The Neptunes' ""Chase"" Chad Hugo is responsible for the record's production), but <i>New Sacred Cow</i> is
    a retro love-letter all the way, with sparse, lurching synths rattling around inside hollowed-out
    arrangements and vocals infused with just enough heartfelt rubber soul to give the tunes some bounce when
    the repetitive backing electronics fall flat.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, that tends to happen a lot, and believe me, from the fifth track onwards, it's not a
    question of whether or not a track will break down to some theatrically soaring refrain, but simply when.
    It's a stretch that he might choking back emotion as he sings, ""Give me a ride on a Zephyr and rocket
    from here/ Give me all your affection and teach me how to feel,"" on ""Love/Hate Sensation"", but as he
    carries song after song with the same gasping investiture, it becomes a complete joke.  And that's to say
    nothing of the actual content, typified by the aforementioned profundity.   Of course, the vapidity of
    Kenna's outbursts isn't the problem; the issue is with how purely mechanical they become.  Uber-simplistic,
    characterless loops are the backbone of nearly every track here, with barely a hook between them; Kenna
    tries to shoulder the load, but inevitably tires beneath it.</p><p>
    
    There are a couple of minor standouts within the context of the album (""Man Fading"" capitalizes on the
    drama <i>New Sacred Cow</i> conjures up before it wears thin; ""Vexed and Glorious"" offers a slightly more
    subtle variation on the theme), but the only really great song present is the aptly chosen single,
    ""Freetime"".  As the first real song on the album, it nails Kenna's formula, and leaves it for the rest
    of the album to beat to death.  The difference between this and the album's other tracks lies entirely
    with the music.  The coiled tension of the verse's staccato riff is wrapped that much tighter, the
    cascading washes that elevate the chorus are that much more grand.  It's three minutes of the recent
    past as filtered through the near-future; the other forty-nine minutes just filter the past through the
    who-cares present, and for now you can pretty much find that anywhere.</p></div>"|4562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4562-new-sacred-cow/|5.5|Eric Carr

    raves on hold long enough to document the demise of the Superclubs (e.g. Ministry of Sound, Cream, Gatecrasher)
    and the continued splintering of music listeners.  Trotting out a series of ""Dance Music Is Dead"" pieces
    that amount to little more than lazy thinking and gleeful opportunism, many of these critics aim to deflate
    a music they never liked in the first place.</p><p>
    Here in America, we're slowly showing signs of shaking our deep-rooted discophobia.  In recent years,
    indieland has finally embraced the post-punk that makes you wind up your waist instead of just standing
    around full of righteous political anger.  In 2003, we're finally loose-limbed and non-puritanical enough
    to be able to bestow the Second Annual Gang of Four Award-- presented to the most overused musical
    touchstone of the year-- upon Prince.  At this rate, a revival fueled by re-writes of ""Can You Feel It?"",
    ""No Way Back"" and ""Voodoo Ray"" should hit American shores sometimes around 2043.</p><p>
    One problem with the typical dance rhetoric has been that it ignores most of the past thirty years of disco
    and its offshoots.  At disco's peak, its detractors and demolition crews resented what was seen as a culture
    of exclusivity and hedonism.  The haters put Bianca Jagger and the Studio 54's white horse in the crosshairs,
    ignored the communal and utopian nature of the dancefloor, and-- with at least a tinge of homophobia--
    associated the sound with being fake, evil, anti-human.</p><p>
    Since then, dance music's entry in the rock-crit history books has been limited to the late 70s when the
    music was inescapable: a few years when an industry-fed orgy of overspending and over-saturation and the
    shaky work of disco tourists clouded its quality.  But talking about American disco and ignoring Philly
    Soul, The Loft, Salsoul, disco (not disco) records and the dance end of post-punk, Arthur Russell, garage,
    electro and house is sort of like approaching the thirty-year history of American punk and forgetting
    The Stooges, New York Dolls, CBGB's, The Germs, Black Flag, and their L.A. cohorts, hardcore, emocore, and
    every underground band from K Street to Gilman Street to focus only on Green Day, Blink-182 and Good
    Charlotte.</p><p>
    And yet, the winner takes it all, so with the blessing of the rock press, that's exactly what's happened.</p><p>
    In recent years, the non-rock world is again slowly incorporating pop/rock structures into their sound
    with great success.  It was European dance DJs who made LCD Soundsystem, The Rapture, Radio 4, and the
    Electric Six names to drop.  Bootleg culture did as much for The Strokes as it did for Xtina.  Junior
    Senior's <i>D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat</i> is one of the best applications of the garage-rock revival.
    Outkast's Andre 3000 and the Luomo-versed Junior Boys have made two of 2003's best indie pop singles, and
    Bubba Sparxxx's ""Back in the Mud"" and Girls Aloud's ""No Good Advice"" rock as engagingly and forcefully as
    most guitar bands.  And now comes Basement Jaxx, who on their new record <i>Kish Kash</i> produce both some
    of the most propulsive, ferocious music of the year as well as some of the most poignant, and they do it in
    part with the sounds of the old-fangled geetar.</p><p>
<i>Kish Kash</i> may not have highs as glorious as ""Red Alert"" or ""Romeo"", but it's the most consistently
    entrancing record of Basement Jaxx's career, and one on which they largely turn their ear away from the
    dynamics and repetition of dance music.  For instance, of the tracks here, only ""Supersonic"" wouldn't have
    stood out on their debut, <i>Remedy</i>-- and even that track doesn't feature house's traditional 4/4 beat.
    (Plus, it has a guitar solo!)  A little darker and less playful than their previous efforts, the first half
    of the record takes the energy, velocity and thrust of ""Where's Yo Head At?"" and adds a head-swimming number
    of sonic details, resulting in a series of dense dance-pop gems; the second half is more placid, built on
    acoustic guitars and broken hearts more than electronic dreams and broken beats.</p><p>
    A pool of guest vocalists further enrich this material, adding an additional layer of variety to the album's
    already diverse palette.  The Bellrays' Lisa Kekaula opens the record in strong voice, riding a regal rave-up
    of guitar, strings and handclaps on ""Good Luck"", a defiant, acerbic nu-""I Will Survive"".  Siouxsie Sioux's
    pummeling anti-greed collaboration, ""Cish Cash"", knocks Fugazi back into Brent D.'s record box and sends
    most of electroclash back to Williamsburg or The Hague with its tail between it legs.  First single ""Lucky
    Star"" retains the peerless Dizzee Rascal's eastern vibe while he thrillingly explains why he needs music to
    make him grow ""dy-na-mi-tee.""  And ""Plug It In"" bathes J.C. Chasez in a tide of sighs, brutish synths and
    whipsmart drum breaks.  The most surprisingly successful collaborations, however, are from Me'shell NdegéOcello,
    whose ""Right Here's the Spot"" is a more striking P-Funk/Prince (dig the ""Delirious"" reference) amalgamation
    than most of <i>Speakerboxxx</i> and more deliciously carnal than <i>The Love Below</i>.  NdegéOcello also
    gives <i>Kish Kash</i> its tender close on the slow-burning ""Feels Like Home"", a fitting finale for its more
    stirring, introspective second half.</p><p>
    You'd have gotten some pretty good odds at the beginning of the year that a Prince-influenced duo would
    wind up making one of the most sonically thrilling, genre-hopping records of the year, but it wasn't either
    of the more likely pairs that managed to do it.  Pharrell and Chad treaded water, offering an album that
    consolidated their strengths but rarely approached their best work.  Then Big Boi did his part, but Andre
    3000 dropped the ball, creating a modern <i>Lovesexy</i> when a <i>Dirty Mind</i> would have been more
    rewarding.  On <i>Kish Kash</i>, Basement Jaxx recover Dre's fumble and move near the front of the 00s'
    crop of rock-dance crossovers, a growing group of Paradise Garage rockers who, with luck, are a sign of
    the times.</p></div>"|573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/573-kish-kash/|9.1|Scott Plagenhoef

    software specifically to aid your own distinctive compositional style.  This is what Brent Knopf did; his
    program is called Deeler, and it allows his band, Menomena, to improvise short ideas and use them as the
    building blocks for broad, loop-based compositions which they then learn to play live.  The method borrows
    most obviously from hip-hop and glitch, and you can pick up slight traces of both in the band's sound, but
    this music is distinctly pop-oriented, and reasonably traditional where its core melodies are concerned.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with an accelerated, processed drum roll and then busts out into the aggressive rhythmic
    assault of ""Cough Coughing"".  Drummer Danny Seim and bassist/guitarist Justin Harris can cut it up like
    nobody's business, and for some large portions of the song, it's just them sparsely making a groove happen,
    with vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Knopf's quivering piano occasionally rising like the ghost of an old
    ambient house record.  The song's midsection is a series of head-spinning leaps and cuts through myriad
    textures, with Knopf resting on a tense piano melody.</p><p>
    
    But it's not all highwire-act dynamics and ADD jams: <i>I Am the Fun Blame Monster</i> also brims with
    mood, a dark energy and sense of direction permeating every song.  ""The Late Great Libido"" is a perfect
    testament to this, with its rivers of bubbling piano, droning sax and frenetic drums.  The track is a
    not-too-distant cousin of Blur, but it does things in ways most bands would never dream of, bursting in
    the middle with thundering guitar melodies, building itself up in increments, snapping to silence and
    back, and sending each verse up differently than the one before.  Harmonies float in on beautiful beds
    of piano in one instant, chase away tinkling glockenspiels the next, and then retreat altogether, yielding
    the field to pianos and heavily delayed drums.  Elements you thought had disappeared for good resurface in
    new contexts with new meanings.  You'll never get it all on the first listen, but there'll be no shaking
    that melody; Menomena could have a huge hit on their hands-- at least at the college level-- if this track
    finds its way into the right mitts.</p><p>
    
    Surprises like the ones in ""The Late Great Libido"" are packed tightly into every song: guitars crash in
    only to anticipate silence, pianos weave through minefields of modular percussion, and Knopf's pleasing
    tenor runs a gauntlet of processing and fading to deliver what are fundamentally very basic melodies.
    ""E. Is Stable"" springs from a simple guitar line, repeatedly building up and breaking down, while ""Strongest
    Man in the World"" feels light until Knopf's hand reaches to the bottom octave of the piano and anchors the
    song to a sinister bass figure.</p><p>
    
    Essentially, the band's process of building from small blocks enables them to put endless variations on
    each basic section of their songs-- introducing a pulsing organ and a plaintive piano separately, for
    instance, and then heaving them together in multiple combinations later in the song.  Even the vocals
    are, by and large, just another module to be played with, disappearing for minutes at a time and reemerging
    with choruses just as you begin to grow accustomed to their absence.</p><p>
    
    Suffice to say, Menomena are a hugely creative band, and with <i>I Am the Fun Blame Monster</i>, they've
    managed to make an album that's extremely accessible yet entirely unconventional.  The thing that drew me
    to the album in the first place was the crazy artwork, which features a flipbook of four photos and very
    little other information, save that the disc's title is an anagram for ""the first Menomena album.""  It's
    just one more subtlety that exemplifies the depth of detail apparent on this record.</p></div>"|5555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5555-i-am-the-fun-blame-monster/|8.7|Joe Tangari

    waves and top ten countdowns hand-in-hand, on the strength of a few catchy singles.  Though always mentioned
    in the same breath-- even to this day-- I find myself wondering now whether the two bands were ever really
    that similar, or if lazy music journalists (ahem) just conspired to propel a nonexistent movement.  If
    the latter was the case, that movement died at ""Hello.""  The postmillennial Radiohead proved to be--
    sorry, boys-- Radiohead.</p><p>
    Travis have done little more on their past three releases than wade contentedly in the wake of all that
    passed: their music has remained formulaically consistent and oblivious to (probably unfounded) media
    expectations.  <i>12 Memories</i> finally finds Fran Healy and his Scottish chums deviating a bit from
    past bequests (and doing so less a few high tides of vigilant UK press or any true semblance of stateside
    hype), but never really breaking stride enough to chart deeper waters.  Mostly, they stumble, spin, and
    fall awkwardly into a middle ground too contemplative and, in the end, under-realized.  Recording this
    album after suffering through drummer Neil Primrose's near-death diving accident and awakening to the
    rancorous societal and cultural injustices of our humble globe circa ought-three, Travis have been slapped
    out of their cheeky levity for good, and have lost nearly all worthwhile traces of their blithe, sing-along
    balladry-- once their greatest asset.</p><p>
    Healy has an agenda this time around, and too frequently wields it like a cocksure amateur. Of the several
    anti-war-directed moments, the cumbersome lyrical bludgeoning that is ""The Beautiful Occupation"" stings
    the most.  Peppered with references to the United Nations, and lines like, ""Half a million civilians are
    going to die today/ So look the other way,"" the song obstinately shoots blanks.  Similarly minded, ""Peace
    the Fuck Out"" feels laughably more like a posturing cheerleader giving you the finger than a seriously
    reflective reminder, with ""Please don't give up/ You have a voice, don't lose it/ You have a choice so
    choose it/ You have a brain so use it.""  Even the melody lacks color of any kind; a problematic recurrence.</p><p>
    With the carefree, breezy melodies (or even lightly introspective moments) absent, such lyrical misfortunes
    take center stage, and lay waste to the potential windfall of Healy's falsetto.  Instead, we're left with
    conspicuous déjà-Thom pleas (on ""Re-Offender"": ""You're fooo-oo-lin' yahself"") and moth-eaten clichés.
    Seemingly aware of its bankrupt course, overtly attention-grabbing moments such as the floor stomping
    romp on ""How Many Hearts?"" bedaub the record with a new sonic adventurousness, but merely serve to spread
    the final product thin.</p><p>
    The album's best moments are crafted when the band plays within itself, and are mostly shuffled to the end
    of the deck.  ""Somewhere Else"" and ""Walking Down the Hill"" are benign enough, with nicely twisted melodies
    and some well-needed understatement. The latter shines, if in a brushed-silver sort of way, and harkens
    back to early-laid blueprints. ""Happy to Hang Around"" garnishes the mix with a little tastefully spun
    attitude.  But it all comes back to one central issue: each new direction leads into a wall or dies for
    lack of momentum.  In short, nothing here has any edge.  It's a problem Travis will need to resolve quickly
    if they intend on sticking around.</p></div>"|8146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8146-12-memories/|5.1|William Morris

    atmosphere illuminated solely by the fleeting pulses and fades of filtered sunlight that drift across a
    sandy forest floor. Originally released as a Jewelled Antler Collective CD-R and now reissued as a CD
    proper by Last Visible Dog, <i>Orchards &amp; Caravans</i> corrals fourteen of Glenn Donaldson's ethereal
    acid-folk compositions; it's the San Francisco shaman's strongest concoction to date, ranking with classic
    releases by such disparate but aesthetically connected groups as Ghost, Flying Saucer Attack, and
    International Harvester.</p><p>
    
    Much like his more droning work with Loren Chasse as The Blithe Sons, <i>Orchards &amp; Caravans</i> takes
    flight around delicate guitar melodies and pensive vocalizations, incorporating bowed oud, bells, toy
    accordion, Wurlitzer, harmonium, bouzouki, banjo, keyboards, and occasional drumming. Packaged in a highly
    saturated collage of birds and butterflies, a gaping Venus flytrap, distant trees, prehistoric flora, and
    the half-human birds found often in Egyptian mythology, the album combines experimental instrumentals,
    magisterial folk, and lengthy drones.</p><p>
    
    Evoking the delicate dance of pine needles when they catch a breeze and disappear over a horizon line,
    ""White Sundials Faced the Sun"" is a segment of subdued Loren Mazzacane-esque guitar noodle: Maintaining
    a slow-drip tempo, the carefully spaced guitar strums are held together with fragile vocal sighs. Assuming
    the properties of its title, ""Pillar of Clouds"" is a shimmering Middle-Eastern drone punctured with bells
    and the plucks and strums of various stringed instruments. The darkest excursion on the record, ""The Marsh""
    mucks Goosewind-styled noise with scuttling contusions that build to a distant drone; overlaid with birds,
    wind and hisses, the manmade sounds ultimately consume the silvan calls of its backdrop.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly poppy at times, Donaldson goes beyond these incidental bits, managing also to pen some solid
    folk hooks. In his hands (and without Bob Dylan's backup singers), the traditional ""Mary Ann"" emerges
    wrapped in hoarfrost, a stark ballad whittled to the high-gloss atmospherics of Galaxie 500.  Hopelessly
    catchy, and perhaps Donaldson's most straightforwardly appealing song to date, ""Everyone of Us a New Leaf""
    features rattling drums by Steven R. Smith, a minimal organ line, talk of ghosts, and a distant vocal
    intonation most reminiscent of Black Heart Procession.</p><p>
    
    Like Ben Chasny during his most patient work as Six Organs of Admittance, Donaldson is also adept at
    incorporating loose structures that allow for the creation of songs within songs and asymmetrical pieces
    that sprout into unexpected directions. Unlike its dreary name, ""Black Rainbows, Part 1 &amp; 2"" is the acid
    folk cousin of The Temptations' ""My Girl""; halfway through, the sweetness uncoils into a fractured organ
    rumble, a distant thunder or grayscale prism. Moving in an opposite direction, ""The Lost Sun"" emerges
    amid a noisy flight pattern but gives way to poignant strains of melodic guitar, half-shaken jingle bells,
    a lost war, and a lost sun. Here, the jangling instrumentation contrasts with the track's ingrained
    melancholy.</p><p>
    
    I've looked for holes in the armor but Donaldson's too fastidious. Prior to this, he came closest to
    reaching these heights on The Blithe Sons' <i>We Walk the Young Earth</i>.  Here, though, he manages to
    top that effort, distilling the best attributes of his naturalist psych and patiently building a fully
    realized dreaming hill, something that fellow Terrastock travelers, in even their most transcendent work,
    have only been able to hint at.</p></div>"|1088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1088-orchards-caravans/|8.8|Brandon Stosuy

    inside Benson's discography contains some sort of nod to a mangled or budding relationship, even if that
    allusion ends up sitting in the context of an entirely separate story.  Ladies are tied to chairs, or
    eating soft-serve ice cream from Dairy Queen, or helpfully pointing out to everyone that Benson's just
    ""not John Lennon.""  But no matter how tragic Benson's girl-trouble may occasionally seem, that ache has
    gotta be dwarfed by the devastation of his industry woes-- if profound major label distrust were
    to be given a dubious, heartbroken face, it would probably look an awful lot like Benson's sheepish mug.</p><p>
    
    After being pegged as pop/rock's new blonde hero by critics and college DJs in 1996, Benson's promising
    Virgin Records debut, the effusive <i>One Mississippi</i>, was promptly declared insignificant by label
    heads, denied a substantial promotional backing, and left to languish peaceably in relative obscurity
    (see: the vast warehouses of Amazon UK).  Virgin had signed Benson based on the strength of an untempered
    six-song demo, but their flippant dismissal of <i>One Mississippi</i> was preceded by loads of unsolicited
    meddling: the label had already asked Benson to shelve his original version of the record, produced by
    co-conspirator and one-time Jellyfish member Jason Falkner (who also co-wrote over half the songs), in
    order to work with Jane's Addiction/Minutemen producer Ethan James.</p><p>
    
    Benson succumbed to the label's request and dutifully re-recorded <i>One Mississippi</i> with James at the
    production helm.  As agreed, Virgin then shipped the record to radio stations, and Benson nobly attempted
    his first major support tour, opening for Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers.  But with little radio airplay
    and the still proscenium-shy Benson stumbling around awkwardly on stage, <i>One Mississippi</i> was largely
    ignored and Benson was dropped by Virgin; unsurprisingly, it took nearly five years for Benson to untangle
    himself and release a follow-up, 2002's comparably straightforward (but Jack White-endorsed!) <i>Lapalco</i>.
    Now with independent StarTime International, Benson has released a plumped-up, twenty-two track version of
    <i>One Mississippi</i> (including the six Falkner-produced tracks and two bonus songs, previously available
    only on the Japanese version of the LP), complete with gushing, masterpiece-declaring liner notes, thus
    priming the record for admission into the long-lost-classic canon.</p><p>
<i>One Mississippi</i> deserves much of its hyperbolic praise: showcasing Benson's indisputable songwriting
    prowess, it's packed with tight melodies, feisty guitar jabs, and some inescapably catchy harmonies, a
    pop/rock treasure chest that's both impossibly listenable and surprisingly complex; Benson's addictive
    hooks tend to conceal rich, oddly understated arrangements, and his guitar work can be both Townshend-abrasive
    and bubblegum easy.  For folks who've already managed to wrap their hands around an original copy of <i>One
    Mississippi</i>, there are enough extras here to justify the investment and satiate completists.</p><p>
    
    The Falkner-produced versions (""Crosseyed"", ""Me Just Purely"", ""Cherries"", ""I'm Blessed"", and ""Sittin'
    Pretty"" are all present in duplicate) of <i>One Mississippi</i>'s final cuts tend to be more stubbornly
    lo-fi and generally richer, while ""Christy"", which didn't make it onto the James-produced edition, is a
    gratifyingly aggressive addition.  Still, Brendan Benson's epic tale of major label wreckage is oddly
    inconclusive: he may have been waylaid and wearied by unsympathetic suits, but-- as if this story could
    get any more prototypically indie!-- Benson's earliest stuff still stands up as his best.</p></div>"|656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/656-one-mississippi/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

    the natural world for inspiration. What's interesting about this move is that it's the exact opposite of
    a ""retreat to simplicity.""  When computer artists incorporate nature into their work they're actually
    borrowing from the most complicated and unknowable patterns in the universe. The physical world is
    difficult to break down to 1's and 0's (imagine a CGI rendering of surf crashing on the rocks next to
    a view of the real thing), causing these artists put aside the silicon and kneel humbly before wood and
    stone.</p><p>
    The guitar is, among other things, a physical object with electrical properties. Each guitar is a series
    of tiny electrical fields-- strings, pickup, interior electronics-- that lends it a specific character,
    and this makes it a natural fit with computers. In the last few years it's become common in certain
    circles to use the guitar as a sound source for the creation of otherwise digital music. At least part
    of the reason this pairing has become popular is that it inserts the ""natural"" (which is, remember,
    complex) into an otherwise virtual world. <i>E*A*D*G*B*E</i>, on the always-interesting 12k label, compiles
    music from four artists working with these tools.</p><p>
    Earlier this year, Japan's Fonica released the sleeper <i>Ripple</i> on Tomlab (also home to The Books,
    Tujiko Noriko, and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone), a record with serious warmth and a vaguely pop
    sensibility.  The two tracks they contribute to <i>E*A*D*G*B*E</i> are more placid and a tad more academic.
    A cluster of quivering drones hover in the foreground of ""4:55"", and the melody is a punctuated series of
    bells that pop up at regular intervals. ""3:33"" is an overlapping series of groans that irregularly tumble
    through the sound field, creating new patterns with each passing second to nice effect. In contrast with
    Fonica's up-to-the-minute processing is Keith Fullerton Whitman's ""Lettera"". With its abrupt shifts in
    dynamics and texture and endless tweaks of simple sounds, ""Lettera"" sounds something like an early electronic
    tape piece, definitely much closer to 20th Century Classical than post-Eno ambient. Lacking the clarity
    and focus of <i>Playthroughs</i>, ""Lettera"" feels more like an experiment that didn't quite gel.</p><p>
<i>E*A*D*G*B*E</i> gets more interesting with three tracks by Sébastien Roux. With his focus on sonic
    detail, Roux's aesthetic comes closest to the 12k ideal of microsound. Roux's tiny sounds usually enter
    the scene painfully, with an accompanying halo of noise. His style tends to combine a shifting layer of
    buzzing drones with clearly articulated melodic crackles dancing in front. Tapped guitar harmonics are
    shaped into repeating patterns on ""Utaro"", while ""Toasa"" focuses on single string strums that emit showers
    of static. These three are wonderful tracks to crawl around in.</p><p>
    Fonica, Whitman and Roux are a gradual build to <i>E*A*D*G*B*E</i>'s stunning centerpiece, seven related
    and connected tracks by San Francisco composer Christopher Willits called ""Seven Machines for Summer"".
    Willits' technique is to sample a number of plucked single guitar notes and then arrange them into pieces
    with relatively light processing. ""The Baroque Machine"", for example, consists of computer-assisted guitar
    runs, Takemura-like clicks, and what sounds like organ but is probably processed feedback. His rapid and
    repetitious style owes something to classic minimalism (occasionally I'm reminded of the Reich piece
    ""Electric Counterpoint"", written for Pat Metheny), but Willits' method is more overtly melodic and pop
    oriented. It's immediately catchy and emotionally engaging.</p><p>
    Willits occasionally has a passage in ""Seven Machines for Summer"" that could have been played by a live
    guitarist, but that would have been boring.  Instead, there is a stiffness and slightly ""broken"" quality
    in his digital arrangements that inject a pang of melancholy to feelings of joy. His tracks move gradually
    to the climax that is the almost painfully gorgeous ""The Fall in Love Machine"". This finale reprises the
    theme of ""The Baroque Machine"" but fleshes it out into a chattering musicbox symphony. Finally, after his
    seven-track series, Willits closes the compilation an unrelated short piece called ""Champagne and Soda"",
    a darker piece with an almost industrial texture. Had Willits put ""Seven Machines for Summer"" on its own
    EP, it would have been one of my favorites of 2003. As it is, his work anchors this occasionally spotty
    but ultimately excellent compilation.</p></div>"|2026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2026-eadgbe/|8.0|Mark Richardson

    many things that elicit cynicism and offhand dismissal like a sophomore album on the heels of a hyped
    debut.  The dreaded ""sophomore slump"" is hardly a fictional pitfall fabricated by bitter music journalists
    and defensive cred-mongers; the pressures of turning out a second record can be crippling for bands who've
    encountered early success, and it often results in an album that pales in contrast to its predecessor.
    Yet, for every band that falters in the wake of initial success, there's another that puts their newfound
    experience to work for them, producing a second record-- a sophomore <i>hump</i>, if you will-- that
    delivers upon all the promise of their first.  And with <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i>, the second album from
    much-lauded Pacific Northwest popsters The Shins, that sophomore hump is in full effect.</p><p>
    
    Arriving on a wave of pre-release hype in 2001, The Shins' debut record, <i>Oh! Inverted World</i>,
    immediately established itself as one of the most uniformly and universally likeable records of that
    year.  Though not nearly the second coming of The Beach Boys as described by its most vocal proponents,
    the album was forged in melody and drenched in atmosphere, casting a thin but palpable haze over a
    beautifully arranged landscape of sincere hooks and sparse instrumentation.  It was an immediately
    inviting formula, if one that ultimately proved limiting; the blurred sonics that blanketed the record
    also often smothered it, dulling the focus and clarity that frontman James Mercer skirted during the
    album's most powerful passages.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i>, the blanket has been lifted, and the complexity and grace revealed underneath
    possess a surprisingly depth.  Every instrument is allowed to exist in its own space, no longer smoothed
    together by excessive reverb.  Mercer's voice resides comfortably at the front of the mix, revealing
    previously undiscovered layers of emotional subtlety and expressiveness.  Every sound and syllable is
    perfectly and distinctly articulated, granting the album a much greater capacity for detail and profundity.</p><p>
    
    And then there are the songs.  Dear god, <i>the songs!</i>  The uniqueness and inventiveness of James
    Mercer's melodic sensibility simply cannot be overstated.  On <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i>, as with its
    predecessor, Mercer makes brilliant use of his formidable vocal range, writing soaring melodies every bit
    as original as they are memorable.  ""Saint Simon"", one of two or three songs on the record that could
    easily contend for song of the year, sees Mercer exploring an almost Bacharach-ian level of melodic
    sophistication.  The track is host to an elegance of exposition and development not even hinted at on
    <i>Oh! Inverted World</i>, as it seamlessly segues from a straightforward pop hook to an ungodly gorgeous
    choral segment, replete with lush strings and chiming guitars.  By the time Mercer reenters with a
    perfectly aching vocal melody, it's almost unbearable-- this is the kind of song that overwhelms simply
    with the intricacy of its beauty.</p><p>
    
    The evolution of Mercer's songwriting extends wonderfully into the louder songs on <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i>,
    as well.  ""Kissing the Lipless"", the album's leadoff track, blissfully transgresses the restraint of
    <i>Oh! Inverted World</i>, building to an impossibly powerful chorus that slyly mirrors the melody of its
    verses.  Indeed, while many pop songwriters seem to use verses simply as something to kill time between
    anthemic choruses, Mercer manages to squeeze some of the album's most memorable moments into places most
    songwriters would neglect or ignore.  ""So Says I"", the album's first single, excels largely through the
    subtle variations worked into its verses, and enjoys its strongest moment in the transcendent harmonies
    that adorn a brief, seamless bridge.</p><p>
    
    The attention to detail on <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i> is truly impressive, but the way that these details
    combine to form music so effortless and emotionally rich is astounding.  <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i> is host
    to enough perfect moments to carry ten records, each one arising spontaneously from the multifaceted frame
    of a masterfully constructed song.  The album may alienate some listeners by eschewing the instant and
    consistent gratification of <i>Oh! Inverted World</i> for more involved, developed songs, but the clarity
    and intricacy of these songs renders the record a much more rewarding listen.  Not simply an excellent
    album, <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i> is also a powerful testament to pop music's capacity for depth, beauty and
    expressiveness.</p></div>"|7114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7114-chutes-too-narrow/|8.9|Matt LeMay

But then,     it's hard to capture ""now""-- and as any fan and follower of improvised music understands all too well, any     brief epiphanies grasped too often slither away into empty gestures or extended technique until that next     magical Moment occurs. Such moments, when experienced live, rarely reduce into words, and trying to nail     that ephemeral moment in a studio environment (much less attempt to re-create past times) is a thankless     endeavor, with lots of empty hands at the end of it.  Loren Connors and David Grubbs had one of those     Moments a few months ago out at the Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, turning in a fine set of duets.</p>
<p>In general, the two guitarists can be relied upon to skirt uninspired time-filling or the practice of     resorting to strange sounds for their own sake-- for better or for worse, their playing stays planted,     be it roots in a motel room blues or po-mo songster threads for theses.  On <i>Arborvitae</i>, the two     capture every dimension of the uncluttered room they usually evoke, but unfortunately, they also attempt     to capture the one-off feel of their cemetery performance, and, despite the fruitfulness of that initial     meeting, their results here are far too two-dimensional.</p>
<p>""Blossom Time"" opens with the sort of phrasing that Grubbs' elucidated to stunning effect on Palace Music's     <i>Arise Therefore</i> and his first solo album for Table of the Elements. The vibrant wood of the piano is     melodic-coat-rack enough for Connors to hang his notes and spectral overcoats, and he riddles the piece     with melancholy feedback.  Poignantly stated and played, the two guitarists spread out and cover the space.</p>
<p>But later, as the title track loses its harmonic framework at the halfway mark, the duo's tentative grip     gets lost for good.  Connors' once effervescent clouds reduce into flat puddles as he changes course-- he     goes from fumbling feedback to mere melody echoing into some numbed-lip wah, uncertain how exactly to     engage Grubbs' turgid piano plod. Grubbs can't keep it up, either, and his suspended piano goes pedestrian     before stopping altogether. He switches to electric guitar for a few more minutes of meandering duets.</p>
<p>""Hemlock Path"" wanders upon a sketch of melody, but prolonged exploration reveals the duo to be in separate     rooms altogether, their movements and habitual gestures noticed too late to be followed. Grubbs sits back     at the piano for ""The Highest Point in Brooklyn"", and I myself wonder where that might be. It's certainly     not here: banged-out chords clang free some fine tube-glow chains from Connors, the two sounds twining tightly     together for a moment before finally letting go. The phantom sounds remain insubstantial, and for momentary     music, it's flatter than a ghost sheet.</p></div>"|5173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5173-arborvitae/|6.4|Andy Beta

Since the mid-90s he's released
    almost nothing but live albums-- there are no studio recordings of his Bloodcount or Paraphrase bands-- and
    his success with this unpredictable medium reflects a knack for running his bands through long, knotty
    works where they can stretch out without derailing: there are no slow parts, no wandering through the
    forest, no sections where the guys ring little bells or recite poetry.  Of course, many great jazz albums
    have taken those risks, but Berne goes for reproducible results.</p><p>
    Some jazz musicians improvise off of chord changes, others improvise over modes; Berne sounds like he's
    fueled entirely by his own momentum.  Melodies fly across liquid ensemble passages that break into caustic
    soloing-- collisions between soloists, aggressive comping, drummers who knock around like they're ripping
    the floorboards out from under you.  Separate compositions roll into each other like merging traffic, and
    the musicians can shred and extrapolate without evading the incessant pulse that sent them on their way.
    And although not every live Berne album is so intense, <i>The Sublime And.</i> ranks as one of the most
    relentless.</p><p>
    The Science Friction band is an electronics-heavy four-piece that merges two of his trios: Hard Cell-- with
    the stupendous keyboardist and Fender Rhodes specialist Craig Taborn-- and Big Satan, with French post-Frisell
    guitar deconstructionist Marc Ducret.  Both trios included Tom Rainey on drums; known for his more standards-focused
    work in Fred Hersch's trio, Rainey has been Berne's drummer on call for years, as far back as Paraphrase.
    Berne recorded this quartet for the <i>Science Friction</i> album on his own Screwgun label last year, and
    this double-album captures a complete concert in Winterthur, Switzerland, crossing album tracks with new
    material.</p><p>
    As expected, this performance is louder, longer, and way more chaotic than the studio album; where that
    first record was intriguingly loopy and colorful, this set just smokes, propelling the band through longer
    sections and more frantic solos.  Berne rips off especially fluid leads on alto sax, and he's courageously
    linear against the fireworks from his sidemen.  When he's not adding color and effects with his laptop--
    playing blustery wind samples over a tense sax solo, or throwing echo on Berne's high notes on ""Mrs.
    Subliminal""-- Taborn plays fierce solos on his Fender Rhodes and synths, with an especially aggressive
    turn on ""Jalapeño Diplomacy"" that's bolstered by riveting accompaniment from Rainey, an intuitive (and
    disruptive) drummer who's both impeccable and propulsive, especially in his own terse, focused solo on
    ""The Shell Game"".</p><p>
    On this set, the best among equals may be Marc Ducret.  Ducret has long had the maturity to slather color
    from his effects without becoming amorphous, but I've rarely heard him solo with such sheer velocity.
    Distorting and fragmenting his lines without veering a degree off-course, Ducret seems to deconstruct and
    rearrange his instrument in mid-air like a cyborg in an especially violent Japanese anime.</p><p>
    There are a few shortcomings.  Even though the compositional material works for this band, the melodies
    end up sounding far more alike than usual.  And the album may actually be too busy: one of the only moments
    to reflect comes with Taborn's solo synth feature, ""Smallfry"", which is actually too ambient-- the hanging
    suspense in his sustained chords evokes images of a rock show, and you can almost picture Taborn in a
    silver cape in front of a smoke machine as he weaves a dramatic introduction to the next piece.</p><p>
    For these minor reasons, <i>The Sublime And.</i> feels less definitive than, say, <i>Unwound</i> (the
    more-than-comprehensive three-disc Bloodcount record), or Paraphrase's <i>Please Advise</i>.  But this is
    the strongest record he's made yet with an electric band-- and it's one of the fiercest and importantly,
    most inventive performances he's captured.  <i>The Sublime And.</i> is essential for anyone looking for
    exhilaratingly original jazz music.</p></div>"|664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/664-the-sublime-and/|8.5|Chris Dahlen

    The idea that misfortune specifically follows some isn't limited to pro sports: Theater has the Macbeth
    curse, Hollywood has the curse of Superman, and politics has the curse of the Kennedys. In music, Screamin'
    Jay Hawkins put a spell on you, Bark Psychosis produced one frequently brilliant <i>Hex</i>, and we've
    learned that incanting the alarmingly un-PC ""Ooo eee/ Ooo ah ah/ Ting tang/ Walla walla bing bang"" was the
    way to win a woman's heart, but the closest there's been to any sort of supposed curse is the one claimed
    to follow ""Helter Skelter"".</p><p>
    
    One band that could qualify as, at the very least, extremely unlucky is Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, who have the
    misfortune of holding the record for charting the most singles in the UK without reaching the top 40 (eight
    through this October). Gorky's just missed the mark by a few spots on three occasions and although, yeah,
    crashing it at #37 and dropping out the next week didn't make bands like Northern Uproar or Geneva household
    names, it couldn't have hurt for Gorky's to have gained the wide exposure that comes with breaking the seal
    of the top 40, and therefore appearing on the UK's nationally broadcast <i>Official Chart Show</i> and
    having the possibility of performing on <i>Top of the Pops</i>.</p><p>
    
    On the cusp of breaking through, Gorky's retreated from spotlight seeking, major labels, and the whimsical
    psychedelia of their past. (Highlights of the first half of the band's career was compiled earlier this
    year on <i>20</i>). The result has reaped some of their richest works-- <i>Spanish Dance Troupe</i>,
    <i>The Blue Trees</i>, and <i>How I Long to Feel That Summer</i>-- which together make a enchanting second
    act in the life of one of the most quietly satisfying bands of the past decade.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Sleep/Holiday</i>, Gorky's continue to explore delicate pastoralisms (piano and violin are increasingly
    pronounced and serve as the foundation of much of the band's sound), albeit with slightly more mixed results
    than usual.  Though still often warm and tender, <i>Sleep/Holiday</i> lacks the surprise or the diversity
    of some of their better work, and their one attempt to reconcile that (the single ""Mow the Lawn"") is
    stunted and forced, lacking the playful brisk smiles of previous rave-ups such as ""Spanish Dance Troupe""
    or ""Poodle Rockin'"". It's an anomaly, however, and not indicative of why or how this record-- too much
    of which drifts along making a lovely sound without really sticking its hooks in you-- falls short of
    the band's other recent efforts,. A couple of those moodier pieces (the reflective waltz ""Single to
    Fairwater"" and the droning, hymnal ""Pretty as a Bee"") work, but too often songs pass without incident or
    interest.</p><p>
    
    When things go right, Gorky's still make a positively lovely sound, particularly the gorgeous, plaintive
    opening pair, ""Happiness"" and ""Waking for Winter"", each of which-- along with the jaunty ""Eyes of Green,
    Green, Green""-- seems to chase and cast off the ghosts that haunted Gorky's on previous albums. The former
    is a soul-searching song about willing good things to happen to oneself after pain. On the latter, singer
    Euros Childs no longer longs for summer but becomes animated by the winter cold.</p><p>
    
    After the sense of tangible, deep loss of <i>Spanish Dance Troupe</i> and the desire for warmth and comfort
    on their two subsequent records, Gorky's conjures a very autumnal sound and a long-rejected willingness to
    accept pain, cursed luck, and changes for the worst. Childs braces for winter in his recollections of
    former lovers, the departed, and missed opportunities. As the title indicates, he still harbors hopes for
    escape-- into dreams, to the south of France, to the country-- but those desires seem, and sound,
    overwhelmed by feelings of exhaustion.</p></div>"|3531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3531-sleepholiday/|6.8|Scott Plagenhoef

From a purely theoretical
    stance, remixes of this sort are the most rudimentary, since the ""mix"" itself is defined as a crude binary:
    there are the vocals, and there are the non-vocals.  De-mixed, then simply matched, the remix's essential
    incongruity stands naked. There's no mediation, as, say, a body of water offers a safe view of the sun,
    which is too bright for our eyes to look upon directly, and for this reason, whether it shocks, disgusts,
    or makes us laugh momentarily, a simple, unadorned remix always has a blinding deal of potency.</p><p>
    
    By its very nature, then, the <i>Modern Hits</i> EP, a remix project in which Andrew Broder-- aka Minneapolis-based
    Ninja Tune artist Fog -- robs well-known hip-hop songs of their rhymes and resituates them before his musty
    lo-fi backdrops, at once surprises, delights, and disgusts the listener. Broder orphans six fierce rhymesayers--
    Jay-Z, Nas, MF Doom, Outkast, Edan, and Kool G. Rap-- and doordrops each into completely unfamiliar territory;
    willed or not, they become Marlows floating down the snaked rivers of dark indie-pop jungles, and both the
    invader and the invaded are equally affected.</p><p>
    
    Which is all well and good, but the ultimate question is this: Is there anything beyond the novelty? Are
    the remixes self-sufficient and interesting independent of their source material? Put crudely, is Broder's
    <i>Modern Hits</i> EP just a joke?  To a certain extent, it is.  All that actually makes these tracks
    interesting is that they very simply exploit the tension between testosterone-fueled rap boasts and Broder's
    quaint indie-folk instrumentation.  Like any joke, each track loses its replay luster as its cleverness is
    unpacked, with hardly any substance lying beyond the initial jolt.  But, that said, the jokes on <i>Modern
    Hits</i> are pretty brilliant, each remix unsettlingly clever for its apparent easiness, as Broder playfully
    subverts hip-hop's trademark taunt and confidence.</p><p>
    
    ""The Whole World"" pits Outkast's vocal jingle against a shuffle-beat of piano, held organ, and an unwieldy,
    Athens-like collected chorus that redeems the original's warbly melody. In the countrified ""Drop Some Smooth
    Lyrics"", Broder square-dances with Edan to a strummed acoustic guitar ditty, replete with cowbell spatters
    and an insistent on-beat bass drum. MF Doom's vitriol in ""Ain't Nothing"" is neutralized by a vaguely new
    age shaker-groove of auxiliary percussion, Wurlitzer reeds, and a masterfully awful trumpet.</p><p>
    
    Broder detours from the straightforward, too, indulging in an extreme abstraction of Kool G. Rap's ""On the
    Run"", in which film samples, guitar, and bass ""interpret"" the lyrics as they spew, reacting most notably
    to Kool's recounting of a drive-by with sampled bullet swipes and intense choral moans. While not the most
    enjoyable remix, it certainly comprises the album's most interesting and innovative, as Broder adds an
    unusual poignancy to lyrics that just as easily could have been parodied.</p><p>
    
    While the other tracks are decidedly lo-fi and, to an extent, rhythmically unadventurous, Broder's take on
    Jay-Z's ""The Takeover"" bursts with energy from the outset, infusing the original's cool confidence with a
    menacing big beat and a frequent recurrences of skittery quasi-ragtime pianos catfighting one another
    outside a Charlie Chaplin saloon. The duel oddly mirrors Jay-Z's lyrical spray against rapper Nas, whose
    own remixed track, ""One Mic"", follows to close out the album, slow and inwardly motivated like the original.
    Herein lies Broder's grandest conceit: not only has he humorously juxtaposed the tracks of two arch-nemeses,
    but, by remixing both of them with such drastically variant but equally quirky approaches, he's relegated
    the two and their differences to utter inconsequence-- Jay's lyric, ""I sampled your voice, you was
    usin' it wrong/ You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song,"" now boils with irony.  Call it hubris or
    just stupid; either way, it's pretty funny, and displays a sense of humor we rarely see in independent
    music.</p></div>"|1087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1087-modern-hits-ep/|7.3|Nick Sylvester

    CDs the webzines have arbitrarily deemed cool, and those frilled skirts that you have to keep tugging at
    in the frigid lines to get into Chelsea's Bungalow 8. I mean, goddamn, it's like thirty degrees out there.
    <i>The Hipster Handbook</i> helped a little, but not enough. The questions linger. Is it cooler to be
    metrosexual, or to pretend to be metrosexual while actually being homosexual? Is it cooler to be an actual
    hipster, an ironic hipster, or the oft-imitated ""fool on the hill"" hipster? For those answers, only deep
    meditation can help; on the musical side of things, Quentin Tarantino has graciously solved many of our
    problems.</p><p>
    
    The ramifications of this album on the young proto-hipster set will be incalculable. Simply for comparison,
    think about how you'd soundtrack <i>Kill Bill</i>. The best I can come up with is putting Genesis' ""I Know
    What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)"" over the climactic sword fight. Thank god, then, that the album, like the
    movie, was compiled by people who obviously have encyclopedic minds able to forge visual/musical puns and
    scorching contrasts between maddeningly obscure pop treasures. This is like a guidebook to the different
    genres needed to be cool. To quickly categorize:</p><p>
    
    Perverse torch songs, menacing revved-up rockabilly,
    ancient slasher scores, Wu-Tang allegiances, blaxploitation funk, swing, 70s disco, Japanese punk-pop,
    spy anthems. They even put on a quick excerpt of Neu! And all the rest consists of the best spaghetti
    western rip-offs of all time. At my screening, people were passing out in the aisles during the opening
    credits alone, clutching each other, finding the speed of sound insufficient, and hence feebly grasping
    at the sound emanating from the speakers, slamming their empty hands into their ears, trying to get even
    more music into their heads. If the <i>Pulp Fiction</i> soundtrack birthed a million surf-rock fanatics,
    this album is going to reinvigorate every genre simultaneously.</p><p>
    
    Whereas the <i>Jackie Brown</i> soundtrack occasionally felt hampered by songs that drew most of their
    interest from their relationship to the movie, these songs not only are able to exist independently from
    their cinematic representations, but, at their best, exceed even the sheer jaw-dropping coolness of the
    scenes they scored. The opener is Nancy Sinatra's enrapturing Hazlewood-produced gruesome breakup threnody,
    ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"". Next to a solitary guitar played by an underwater mortician, Sinatra
    sings the incomparable intro, ""I was five and he was six/ We rode on horses made of sticks..."" And these
    were written by Sonny Bono! If you're trying to make tedium, you can have John Williams; if you're trying
    to make a movie, you better make damn sure you have a Nancy Sinatra song in it.</p><p>
    
    Sun Records pioneer Charlie Feathers' ""That Certain Female"" is all warbling lasciviousness. In the lengthy
    history of country/blues/rock tunes that start with a god-defying ""Wellllllllll...,"" this is in the very
    top tier. Whether he ever found his woman or not, his concupiscence has been fulfilled. The eight-minute
    epic of Santa Esmeralda's ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" is the Animals classic via Latin disco, dissolving
    in an astonishingly complex string arrangement (well, for disco anyway). The Arctic reed-and-bells of Meiko
    Kaji's ""The Flower of Carnage"" ain't Baudelaire, but it gets the job done, Will Oldham-style: ""Begrieving
    snow falls in the dead morning/ Stray dog's howls and the footsteps of Geta pierce the air.""</p><p>
    
    The remainder, and far superior, material is instrumental music cribbed from other movies. The best piece,
    Luis Bacalov's ""The Grand Duel (Parte Prima)"" (which accompanies the film's well-publicized anime sequence)
    is all operatic poltergeist sirens and campfire acoustic guitar. It's unabashedly plagiarized Ennio Morricone
    and, even then, deserves to be in the same sentence with him. The Bernard Herrmann theme to <i>Twisted Nerve</i>
    (the whistling nurse one) begins with whistle-while-we-work conviviality and flourishes into a demented
    shock of orchestral dread. Al Hirt's version of the <i>Green Hornet</i> theme is what ""Flight of the
    Bumblebee"" always promised to be, bearing the most ridiculous trumpet line since the theme to <i>The Good,
    The Bad, and The Ugly</i>. Once the tortuous, dizzying riff ends, a strong sturdy tone emerges that, by
    the end, has started battling the initial trumpet for control of the song, concluding in a bop that grows
    dangerously close to free jazz.</p><p>
    
    There are two slight, avoidable problems. Many will probably decry the RZA's lyrics to ""Ode to Oren Ishii"".
    I will concede that he did indeed rhyme ""Ishii"" with ""Japaneseshi."" For a few years now, RZA has been
    adopting the unconvincingly out-of-control emotional delivery of Ghostface Killah with the lyrical inanity
    of ODB. It should be hilarious; it probably is. Secondly, a lot of music from the movie is missing, which
    I normally wouldn't deign to mention except that in the case of a soundtrack that is more or less dedicated
    to Morricone mood, it's just senseless to leave out ""Death Rides a Horse"". Perhaps even more significantly,
    I have no idea what depraved mind neglected to include the greatest garage-rock song of all time, The
    Human Beinz's ""Nobody But Me"". It would not be overreacting to murder the criminal. Still, who cares? As
    this review testifies, I am not qualified to critique music. However, if you dislike more than a third of
    these songs, you are not qualified to <i>listen</i> to music.</p></div>"|7887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7887-kill-bill-vol-1/|8.7|Alex Linhardt

    How Asteroid No. 4 avoided that fate is a mystery (though being from Philadelphia probably helped), for
    there's very little on <i>Honeyspot</i>, their third full-length album, that's even the least bit unique.
    In fact, the band exists almost entirely on the borrowed capital of the past.  Departing from the 60s
    psychedelia and Syd Barrett-inspired folk of their underachieving EP, <i>Apple Street</i>, they're now
    recycling the sounds of George Jones, early Dylan, Buffalo Springfield, The Flying Burrito Brothers and
    others into an inferior, one-dimensional, revivalist pastiche-- that is to say, Son Volt Redux.</p><p>
    
    All of the predictable elements are in place: banjo, steel guitar, mandolin, a harmonica that just will
    not shut up, female backing vocals, songs about preachers/booze/Godlessness, a Woody Guthrie re-arrangement,
    even blurry and luminescent band photos in the liner notes.  There's nothing inherently wrong with this
    type of nostalgia, but when it becomes as emulative and formulaic as it does on <i>Honeyspot</i>, it
    starts to seem like parody.  <i>Boring</i> parody.  Creativity, boldness, salience; all of these things
    are sacrificed to Asteroid No. 4's confused longings for the music of the past.</p><p>
    
    ""Runnin' Away,"" with its sun-shiny rhythm and distant piano plinks, is a nod to one of the band's many
    forebears, The Byrds, yet its repetitive chorus, ""Ooooo-eeeeee/ See me runnin' away,"" has all the forced,
    painful sentimentality of Boy scout camp sing-alongs.  Sure, it's catchy alright, but give it a few listens
    and you'll be looking for the nearest smore-poker on which to impale yourself.  ""Like Dogs"" is a blatant
    George Jones rip-off, complete with a weary, plodding drumbeat and mournful steel guitar.  Frontman Scott
    Vitt even imitates Jones' voice as he sings, ""Well, some people say I'm wrong to do this to her/ But they
    don't know, we just don't see eye to eye.../ I prayed to the Lord to make things better/ But every night/
    We bark and bite like dogs.""  Simply put, Jones deserves a better homage than this.</p><p>
    
    By far the best song on the album, ""It's All OK"", is a short, docile instrumental that could nearly pass
    for a <i>Nashville Skyline</i> outtake.  The delicate banjo finger-picking feels genuinely inspired,
    providing a warm backdrop for the harmonica and steel guitar.  Still, it's too indebted to its antecedents
    to amount to any more than a promising footnote.  To be fair, that's not the only brief glimpse of promise
    here, but none ever stand out enough to save this album from its affected ruralism and tired, countryfied
    stylings.  Explaining Asteroid No. 4's music, Vitt says, ""It's simple music for complicated times.""  Well,
    let it be said that simple music doesn't have to be this boring.</p></div>"|326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/326-honeyspot/|3.0|John O'Connor

    and Tickled Trio, Ms. John Soda's debut full-length presented a more sterilized, female adaptation of The
    Notwist's delicate pop compositions-- all skittering clicks and cuts urgently panning from speaker to
    speaker, purring electric synthtones and serene cyborg vocals, courtesy of singer Stefanie Böhm (a former
    member of the post-rock ensemble Couch).   Judging from the sound of their new EP, <i>While Talking</i>,
    they've switched gears.  Which isn't necessarily a bad idea in premise-- <i>No P. or D.</i>, at a scant
    eight tracks, seemed perfect in length, and another eight along the same lines could quickly grow tiring.
    It's their choice of direction that mystifies.</p><p>
    The most immediately detectable difference from Ms. John Soda's debut is that Böhm rarely sings-- rather,
    she adopts a breathy speaking approach clearly indebted to Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon.  Musically, there's
    not much difference; it's all in the production: the disc has shifted from luminescent neon glow into
    rougher-edged territory, liberally employing distortion and sharper instrumentation.  Though it's an
    interesting experiment, it rarely pays off.  Of course, it's difficult to tell whether that's due to the
    duo's lack of experience working with harsher sounds or to the general weakness of the tracks themselves.
    I might be able to see it working out if their forthcoming full-length is more focused.  <i>While Talking</i>,
    however, jumps erratically from straightforward rock-and-roll, to unmotivated post-rock, to aimless
    mood pieces, to fleeting reprises of the duo's original sound. In a sense, Ms. John Soda have masked their
    two strongest traits: Böhm's delicate alto and Micha Acher's pop sensibilities.</p><p>
    It's difficult to praise the lyrics of a non-native English-speaking songwriter-- the only recent possible
    exception being Norway's Sondre Lerche-- but often poor lyrical content can be redeemed by a strong voice
    and melody.  Böhm situated herself firmly in this territory on the duo's last record, and that's all too
    clear on songs like the opener, ""No. One,"" which have Böhm uttering such inanities as, ""The things you say
    are forgotten.  What did you say?"" without the support of her charming pop hooks.  The music backing her--
    a dynamic rock soundtrack stuffed with Weilheim organ whirls, bowed cello, moody electronics, and a
    percussive rattle that one might liken to the sound of a seashell necklace-- nearly makes up for it,
    but the juxtaposition of Böhm's vocal delivery and the gravelly rock textures is just too jarring.</p><p>
    ""Sometimes Stop, Sometimes Go"" nominally implies disjointedness, and as such, the track sees Ms. John Soda
    not intertwine, but sequence, one after another, an almost Interpol-ish guitar interval riff, and the
    gentle, and more familiar piano and vocals of <i>No P. or D.</i>  For better or worse, the song showcases
    how cosmic a difference there is between Böhm's singing and speaking voices.  ""If Someone Would Know"",
    meanwhile, is a self-indulgent, poorly considered drone experiment that poorly utilizes the faraway piano
    lines and skittery whirls it introduces, and ""I Think It Could Work, Marylin"" suspends guitar chords and
    floating organ tones behind the fantastically awful dialogue of its characters Elvis and Marylin, both
    speaking roles assumed by Böhm. The piece sounds much more like the soundtrack to an art student's
    introductory film class project than a proper song, possibly because it is: the duo have included a mostly
    vapid music video for the song on the EP.</p><p>
<i>While Talking</i>'s only non-original composition is ""I &amp; #8217"", a remix medley of tracks from <i>No
    P. or D.</i> by Anticon member Subtle. The opening moments pit typewriter clicks against accordion and
    cello retakes and Böhm's vocal from ""Technicolor"", inviting a rumbly bass from time to time and dropping
    into a dark verbal spar of ""I don't want to see you techni-nothing-colored."" It traverses typical Anticon
    terrain, with drawn-out vocals, saxophones, and looped cut-ups atop a molasses beat and beaten accordion.
    The possibilities for this undertaking were enormous, and while comprising the most interesting on the
    disc, ""I &amp; #8217"" is actually somewhat tame, especially considering Anticon's ear for the eerie.</p><p>
    Though EPs are a format well-suited to trial-and-error, Ms John Soda have entirely neglected their greatest
    attributes here.  <i>While Talking</i> can count a few successes-- one fairly good rock tune (""No. One""),
    one half-interesting remix, and one mostly entertaining music video for the one aforementioned fairly good
    rock tune-- but its bombs are tragic.  If all things Weilheim strike your fancy, including the scene's
    mediocrities and failures, <i>While Talking</i> should find a comfortable space on your CD shelf: right
    next to The Notwist's debut album.</p></div>"|5486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5486-while-talking-ep/|5.9|Nick Sylvester

They couldn't go to their local supermarket and pick out what to eat
    for dinner: there weren't any pre-packaged, sterile cuts of brontosaurus ribs.  Cavemen had to stalk the
    creatures that looked like they could be caught and eaten, and that wouldn't poison or infect them once
    consumed. Cavemen had to take a chance. Cavemen had to brave the little voice inside of their head,
    whispering: ""Throw spear at giant friend-eater? Get eaten like friend. Don't throw spear at giant
    friend-eater. Find easier food."" But some cavemen went out and killed that dangerous food anyway.</p><p>
    
    With that said, The Austerity Program have murdered the beast that is normalcy. By taking a guitar, a
    bass, and a drum machine, Justin Foley and Thad Calabrese have concocted a four-track EP that seethes
    lyrical belligerence and scrapes by on a minimal number of elements.  Recorded in a church basement--
    where the elders no doubt peeked on with trepidation as the duo beat on their instruments and wailed
    like Jesus must have when the nails were driven in-- this music perfects repetition: Soggy basslines
    drip from frozen fingers as notes find refuge against the drum machine's plodding kick and snare.  Feet
    stamp through puddles in time with the beat, canines gnashing into lips through the awkward strangling
    of the guitar.  Breath twists into a gasping scream as air is pushed thin of sound.</p><p>
    
    Each of <i>Terra Nova</i>'s untitled tracks last upwards of eight minutes, the band relentlessly dragging
    their victims around frozen tundra with jagged teeth: ""Black her out and drag her down the stairs/ Drag
    her out into the cold/ Blood is dripping on into the streets/ She's halfway gone to god.""  Each song
    writhes under its tormentors hands, giant crevasses of silence only procured by the slight popping of a
    bassline or the murmur of the guitar.  On the opening track, the cymbal picks monotonously for a brief
    moment until guitar and bass enter the room in a tussle, each side getting in equal damage. The cymbal
    returns, warning the two of dire consequences, but is immediately cut off with squabbling and a quick
    middle finger. Finally, a conflict ensues with all parties enraged, from which the vocals emerge triumphant.
    Parched from the frozen pipes, the voice lunges and cries with little care for the damage ultimately
    caused. Wavering at the top of the exhalation, the peak is reached only to come tumbling back down in
    a violent display of guitar-fucking action: as the members put their backs into it, the instruments thud
    from the dry humps received. Each thrust from the fingers and the pelvis wrench out disdain and ire:
    ""But what is blood without its oxygen/ But the water of death sick on its own disease.""</p><p>
    
    Gushing choruses melt from the dawdling lines of the bridges for a violent tumult of rapids the listener
    must ford. And it goes on like this throughout the EP: sparse snippets of guitar interplay with bluesy
    white boy vocals screeching like a puberty-riddled Steve Albini until they finally figure out what to
    do with an erection when no one's looking: start milking it to the good stuff for about twenty seconds,
    and once they can't take anymore: POP.  Time to clean up the chorus before Dad knocks on the door to see
    what all the ruckus is about.</p></div>"|410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/410-terra-nova-ep/|8.0|Craig Rostron

    a girl I had the heavy hots for riding shotgun, her long black hair flitting
    through the cracked window into the summer night.  We were headed to a keg
    party in the parking lot of a hockey arena.  Things looked promising.  I
    forget most of what happened at the party, only that the girl, who bore a
    striking resemblance to the actress Jami Gertz of <i>The Lost Boys</i>,
    disappeared with some other guy.  And that was the end of that.  The point
    in mentioning this is, it's precisely the type of nostalgia-- bittersweet,
    foggy, mythic-- that's elicited by The Stills, a four-piece Montreal band
    whose slithery, sentimental rock bridges the divide between post-punk and
    80s pop balladry.</p><p>
    
    The story goes like this (with some embellishments for narrative effect): a
    few years ago, young Tim and his erstwhile pal Dave happen upon a four-track,
    which they decide to buy.  Money is scarce, but they're auteurs, and so they
    make the sacrifice.  Tim and Dave agree to take turns using the machine,
    promising to listen to one another's music with a mind towards an eventual
    collaborative project.  Some time passes.  Tim and Dave both have doubts,
    but they soldier on, making music as true to the spirit of their stylistic
    forebears, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, as possible.  Slowly, they begin to realize
    that investing in the machine wasn't such a silly idea after all.  To their
    astonishment, ""a like-minded songwriting aesthetic"" develops.  After enlisting
    two buddies, Greg and Oliver, they form a band, play a few gigs in New York
    City, and before they know it, they're signed to Vice Records, home to
    Mancunian rapper The Streets.  Fame and snorting blow off a hooker's breasts
    lay just around the corner.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, The Stills have a way to go before realizing that last part
    of the story.  While the four songs on <i>Rememberese</i> (one song is a remix
    of another) are, for the most part, subtle, unpretentious pop odes that plunge
    the listener into a blissful, nostalgic revelry, they're far from the ear-catching,
    inventive material of a truly great band.  For example, the opener ""Still in
    Love Song"" is driven by an infectious hook and Tim Fletcher's solemn, Ian
    Curtis-like drone, but sounds all too familiar, simplistic, and ultimately
    leads nowhere.  Ditto for ""Killer Bees"", which veers dangerously close to
    becoming an Interpol sound-alike.  Same frenetic guitar, crashing cymbals
    and distorted vocals.</p><p>
    
    There's a lesson in this which, like most things, is found in Deuteronomy:
    Don't worship your idols; it violates the pursuit of innovation.  A recent
    analogy: On one side you got the people who say the Space Elevator (a 60,000
    mile elevator stretching into space, made of a fantastically light but
    durable material called nanotubes) is impossible to build, and on the other
    side you got the people who say ""screw it"" and just build the motherfucker.
    Point being, you have to leap off the path to reason in order to achieve the
    remarkable.</p><p>
    
    ""Talk to Me"", by far the best song on <i>Rememberese</i>, eschews the ornate,
    textbook 80s pop/rock and instead delivers an edgy, pants-around-the-ankles
    eulogy to a 900-number lover.  Fletcher intones, ""The bored person's
    nightmare/ Crying crocodile tears.../ Did I blow your mind tonight/ Did I
    make it alright.../ Be sure to call.../ Talk all you want.""  I've been there.
    Hey, who hasn't?  Greg Paquet's strumming and Dave Hamelin's drumming add
    balls to the rhythm, and a synthesizer carves out a nice place for itself on
    the chorus.  This song really grows on you.  With any luck, this is the
    direction that The Stills are headed.  Otherwise, the dream has ended before
    it really began.</p></div>"|7717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7717-rememberese-ep/|6.5|John O'Connor

Interested?  Glad to hear it.  So just sit tight while I tear a
    page from my riveting autobiography:</p><p>
<sub>
    (p. 147)<br/>
    Summer of '95.  A quorum of my closest adolescent friends travels to Orlando for a community-sponsored
    Youth Group excursion and summarily return home, one and all: Saved! Born Again! It was just supposed to
    be a quick ticket out of our one-stoplight cultural abyss, but as it turned out, I didn't know the meaning
    of the word ""insular.""  Next thing I know, it's Saturday night and I'm getting hauled to shuddersome
    teen-catered fireside Bible-socials and being told to trash my entire (!) record collection.  My recently
    recalibrated friends had already done it.  ""Christian waters never run tepid.""  It was all or nothing.
    And there, Tooth &amp; Nail, you were: steadfast and ice cold.  You held all the answers, didn't you?  Yep,
    for every successful and visionary secular band or movement, there was a carefully manicured response
    from the Christian music industry. I should know: I heard every one. (And by all means, feel free to put
    the test to any of the following suppositions.) For My Bloody Valentine there was Morella's Forrest; for
    Pavement: Sal Paradise; for Operation Ivy: Squad Five-0; and the sonic equivalent to the Mighty Mighty
    Bosstones?  Why, the skalvation offerings of The O.C. Supertones!  Naturally.</sub></p><p>

    
    In truth, listening in on this stuff wasn't a total waste of time.  Athens' own Summer Hymns supplanted
    the late, Zachary Gresham-led Joe Christmas, and I still spin each Damien Jurado record I own.  Furthermore,
    just last month I rediscovered one of T&amp;N;'s founding compatriots and venerable torchbearers: Jason Martin's
    Starflyer 59.  <i>Old</i>, his eighth studio album is both a celebratory nod to mid-90s shoegaze pop and
    a successful grasp of the current fiber-optic-sparkled baton.  Granted, he might not have a solitary death
    grip on any one industry spec, but he's definitely off and running in the right direction.</p><p>
    
    While his earliest releases were loosely wound, distorted MBV-tinged guitar-pop excursions, Martin's most
    recent recordings are sharper, more deeply melodic, and starkly atmospheric.  Each of the ten tracks on
    <i>Old</i> carry a heretic regality that counter-intuitively sharpens the vintage tones of mid-90s shoegaze
    rock while fabricating purebred vitality and ripened accruement within a familiar pop construct.  Most of
    the songs-- highlighted by the simpering and mid-paced (yet stellar) ""Passenger"", and the sterile luminosity
    of the piano-driven title track-- will leave a Grandaddy aftertaste in your mouth.  The songs are mortally
    aware, as evidenced both in the lyrics and epic, reaching tones, which, thankfully, never venture into
    postmortem deliverance territory or carry burdensome testimonial weight.</p><p>
    
    Midway, the album slowly eases into a comfortable, crystalline canter, sinking off the coast of the album's
    earlier successes.  The opener, ""Underneath"", brashly delivers campy yet self-assured guitar-rhythms and
    minor new-wave progressions laced with sweeping synths to great fortune.  The final third of the song
    interfaces earlier, jostling elements into a singularly grand swing of momentum and a perfectly executed
    outro, lush with rolling drums and a background chorus of devilish nirvana.  Martin's breathy, overcast
    vocals perfectly lace the song (the entire effort, really) with almost goth-like murkiness.  But perhaps
    the highlight of the album, rather than any specific moment, is its ability to retain a congruous vision
    without ever growing stale within the confines of its own sonic inclinations.  Each nuanced revelation has
    enough character to shine on its own, shuffling through spacious melodies and contracted moments of alloyed
    potency.</p><p>
    
    The biggest departure here comes with the flawless fusion of the closing track, ""First Heart Attack"", where
    a grandiose 70s Pink Floyd/Moody Blues stratospheric electric digression effortlessly retreats back into
    a lost Grandaddy acoustic ambit, in candid surrender to fate: ""It's when I have my first heart attack/ And
    I can't even breathe/ You tell the truth, I know you wouldn't lie/ That I'm on my last beat.""  For all its
    thematic resignation, though, <i>Old</i> is no response to any secular undertaking, past or present, or
    cool acceptance of systemic classification.  After ten years, the band surely isn't looking to break out--
    even if the notion is long overdue.  If you can overlook all the potential prefabricated pitfalls of such
    a release, sooner or later it'll hit you like it hit me: I'll be damned if this ain't a helluva solid record.</p></div>"|7463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7463-old/|7.9|William Morris

There's not going to be
    any stories of how I patronized the laundromat before I listened to this album. So, here, this is what you
    need to know: Café Tacuba is one of the best bands in the world.  When their eponymous debut saw release
    in 1992, there was certainly an overwhelming supposition that Café Tacuba was destined for greatness, but
    by 1999's double-disc <i>Reves/Yosoy</i>, it was incontestably clear that this band deserved accolades of
    the highest order. Their latest, <i>Cuatro Caminos</i>, is one of the best albums.  (That sentence was not
    missing a clause or specification.)</p><p>
    Although the band sprang to life from the same movement that spawned Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Maldita
    Vecindad, most of the guitar lines on <i>Cuatro Caminos</i> are spiraling, elegiac edges that sound like
    vintage Pavement and Calexico. ""Cero y Uno"" introduces this tone, but things don't heat up till the
    simmering hootenanny ""Eo""-- a euphoric approximation of The Clash's ""Brand New Cadillac"" if it spat up
    sound effects and circus music atop dense polyrhythms in a Vegas sex shop.  But Café Tacuba play two
    minutes of it and get out, switching instead to ""Mediodía"".  The song fully captures the expressive
    elasticity of frontman Élfego Buendía's voice, which can be abrasively mocking and tender in the same
    utterance, converting every punk song into a ballad and vice-versa. A sea shanty that swells to incorporate
    chimes and orchestration amidst the cracking and murmuring of the floorboards, ""Mediodía"" is a lamenting
    dirge that never begins to approach melodrama.  ""Qué Pasará"" creates a sort of ska-metal that sounds far
    better than my term for it.  I'm not going to deceive anyone; there's a lot of ska here.  But even The
    Clash had to play a few reggae songs now and then, and this ain't your father's third-wave; ""Recuerdo
    Prestado"" is a menacing bounce that erodes into a catastrophe of a solo.</p><p>
    There are two startling Indian-influenced breaks on the album (both of which, yes, employ tape loops and
    backwards guitars). The first is the chorus to ""Camino y Vereda""; the second is the Irish-Indian folksong
    ""Hola Adiós"" (the name is a clear allusion to ""Hello Goodbye""). ""Eres"" is unabashedly classic 70s rock,
    a sun-splattered villa with the best Spanish guitar line in a rock song since Naked Raygun's ""Vanilla Blue"".
    The epic centerpiece, ""Encantamiento IxFAtil"", begins with sparse, echoing piano and plaintive humming
    before Joselo Rangel unleashes a cuttingly frosty guitar line that, by itself, eclipses most of the last
    Godspeed album.  Indeed, Café Tacuba is a band that fully acknowledges its debt to other musical legacies
    while remaining true to their own wholly unique vision.</p><p>
    There are undoubtedly a few problems, or a potential for problems, on the album. ""Puntos Cardinales"" bends
    terrifyingly close to bad Björk territory, but is salvaged when the chorus turns into the strangest disco
    hit never to come out of 1979, and ""Soy o Estoy"" is too insignificant and cute to matter in the company of
    the rest of these songs.  The album's not terribly coherent, either, as a result of its diversity-- there
    are songs on here that make little to no sense upon first listen (""Tomar el Fresco,"" ""Eo""), but rarely any
    moment at which this iconoclasm undermines the group's melodiousness.  Yet, despite its minor flaws,
    <i>Cuatro Caminos</i> ranks among the most innovative and soulful full-lengths to see release this year,
    the rare albums on which a fantastically popular group with a firm grasp of their direction and sound is
    able to produce some of their most memorable and mesmerizing songs without sacrificing any of their
    experimentation and audacity.</p></div>"|1724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1724-cuatro-caminos/|8.7|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    thirds, each with its own distinct mood, thrust and pace.  It's a concept that works wonderfully in his
    own films, and the one I've seen that makes the best use of it is <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>, in which Al
    Pacino and an associate botch a bank robbery and wind up presiding over a hostage situation that grows
    gradually more intense as the film progresses.  You may not notice the way the film is broken down until
    reading about how Lumet used everything from lighting and lens filters to the pace of the action and the
    timing of plot twists in a very deliberate way to alter the way the scenario makes you feel.</p><p>
    
    This aesthetic can naturally be transposed onto other art forms, but until the late 1980s, recorded music
    by and large wasn't one of them.  Albums were split in half, divided into side A and side B-- and indeed,
    a lot of albums try to emulate that breakdown even in the CD age.  But if there's one thing CDs gave
    artists as a medium, it's greater flexibility in sequencing and flow, and every once in a while, I notice
    that same thirds phenomenon (though it stands to reason that most bands aren't quite as calculating about
    it as Lumet was).  A favorite example of mine is Blur's <i>13</i>, which I've always heard as three
    ""movements,"" for lack of a better term: the first third is boisterous and direct, the middle third is
    weird and obscure, and the final third is something of a meeting of the two, a sort of reconciliation of
    extremes.</p><p>
    
    Toronto collective Do Make Say Think (or as I enjoy calling them, The Action Verbs) have hit on this
    rather directly on their newly released fourth album, <i>Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn</i>.  The
    title and sequencing imply a series of three suites, each with its own prevailing mood and feel, and each
    third is subsequently subdivided into thirds again, with long, developed pieces flanking ambient interludes.
    It works perfectly, too, as it allows the band to corral the growing diversity of their sound into a format
    that makes a lot of sense.</p><p>
    
    Since the release of their dub-influenced self-titled debut, Do Make Say Think have dramatically varied
    their sound, increasingly utilizing deeper layers and more complex development with each subsequent release,
    and <i>Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn</i>'s first third is immediately more volatile than anything
    they've done yet: it unfurls chiming guitars over a strange, melting bass figure before bursting into a
    nearly joyful groove built on scattered drumming and elastic bass.  The track straightens out slowly, as
    horns and distortion build to a head and finally grind themselves to a halt, leaving space for a slow
    build back into dissonant mayhem, and ultimately turning full circle back to the chiming guitars that
    began things so calmly nearly ten minutes earlier.  ""War on Want"" serves as the pivot into ""Auberge le
    Mouton Noir"", a bed of quivering strings that the latter song buries under brilliant bursts of repetitive
    guitar before unexpectedly lurching forward into driving rhythms and whirling fragments of melody.</p><p>
    
    The middle of the album expands on the formula established in the first third, to very different effect.
    Rising from a freezer blast of icy texture on a pulsing bass, ""Outer &amp; Inner Secret"" is at first hushed
    and unhurried, but the band's collective swells can only be contained for so long, and at the five-minute
    mark, they slip into a morass of arguing guitars over a punk march drumbeat.  Unearthly slide guitars rise
    at the end to forecast ""107 Reasons Why"", a brief, velvety horn and guitar segue into ""Ontario Plates"", a
    staggering instrumental that sags under sax and horns, dragging along guitar parts that sound like some
    sort of post-rock Christmas carol.</p><p>
    
    But the final third is the most crushing. ""Horns of a Rabbit"" rises over cymbal, a looped guitar part,
    electronic squiggles, hymnal organ and a massive drum beat, and just when it feels like it's rising to
    another loud climax, it retreats to a quiet heartbeat and strummed guitar.   From there, the track builds
    in rhythm and volume, dragging along sharply distorted guitars blaring and violins until it glitches out,
    channels cutting, instruments bailing, and impassive noise overtaking everything.  The noise is called
    ""It's Gonna Rain"", and it from the sound and title of it, I'm guessing it was composed mostly of the
    processed sound of rain hitting a tin roof.  Finale ""Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!"" organizes slowly, finally
    coalescing into a pretty acoustic guitar and horn serenade brushed by distorted slide guitar and wavering
    synth.  The acoustic instruments beautify the noise that surrounds them, and the music is almost triumphant
    by the time it hits its closing decrescendo.</p><p>
    
    In <i>Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn</i>, Do Make Say Think have presented us with their best work
    yet, a varied and unpredictable album capable of imparting the chill of the winter and the warmth of
    celebratory joy to you without ever presenting you with a human voice.  The way the band breaks up the
    action makes the album equally digestible as a whole or in three discreet parts taken separately, which
    is especially nice when you're short on time to just sit and listen to the whole thing.  Here, Do Make
    Say Think have nearly perfected themselves, and made a fantastic album in the process.</p></div>"|2400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2400-winter-hymn-country-hymn-secret-hymn/|8.1|Joe Tangari

Indoctrinated by years of biased     textbooks, hippies' hyperbolic eulogies, and <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> features (a Johnny Knoxville/Christina     Applegate biopic currently entitled <i>Grand Theft Parsons</i> is due next year), I have venerated Parsons     to the point where, back in '91, my Parsons figurine necklace saved my life when I should have been shot     in the neck.  I know he was a narcissistic, condescending, uncontrollable malcontent, probably undeserving     of most of my praise. I don't care. Every martyr has his cross. Jesus' was made of wood; Parsons' was made     of morphine, booze, and Cosmic Morphoid Crazydust (or some such opiate).</p>
<p>A Harvard drop-out, Parsons met Byrds bassist Chris Hillman at an unromantic Hollywood bank, coerced him     into joining the Crosby-less band in Nashville, and, amidst quiet feuding with Roger McGuinn, made what     is deniably one of the Top 20 country records of all time. Today, no noteworthy reviewer is naïve enough     to claim <i>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</i> was the first country-rock album. Instead they'll tell you it was     Parsons' International Submarine Band's 1968 album <i>Safe at Home</i>, and maybe that they even have the     receipts to prove it.  But, while Parsons was more of a heroin addict than a pedagogue, if he's taught me     anything, it's that there was no ""first"" country-rock record. Country has always rocked. When Hank Williams     sang, ""I'll never get out of this world alive,"" he paved the way for Sid Vicious.  If anything, <i>Sweetheart</i> is vastly less rocking than Merle Haggard's late-60s albums-- Parsons was simply the first to disseminate     the rock to North Hollywood and Keith Richards' mansion.</p>
<p>The actual album is a blindingly rusty gait through parched weariness and dusted reverie. It's not the     natural sound of Death Valley or Utah, but rather, a false portrait by people who wished it was, which     makes it even more melancholy and charismatic. Between the shuffling and galloping are the astonishingly     doomed harmonies, McGuinn and Parson's hypnotic and enthusiastic vocals, and countless miles of Lloyd     Green's pedal steel. The songs, mostly covers, are equally saturated in sincerity and dedication. McGuinn     had originally conceived the album as a panorama of American genres from the turn of the century through     the synthesizer era until Parsons and Hillman convinced him to focus solely on country. Still, the diversity     is there: a plucking Woody Guthrie, a craggy, grisly Haggard, post-motorcycle Dylan, Stax/Volt genius     William Bell. But The Byrds have so totally captured a particular sound that the transitions are seamless.     The righteousness of ""The Christian Life"" is perfectly at home on an album with a song about murdering     your wife.</p>
<p>The crucial aspects of this particular release, however, are the extras-- especially since an expanded     edition already came out in 1997 highlighting some unreleased master tapes.  This new double-disc version     is about double the price, and somehow managed to miss a few tracks from the '97 version.  It also claims     everything's been remastered without sounding at all distinguishable from the last edition.  To be fair,     the second disc offers six International Submarine Band songs (three of which have never been available on     CD), but even these are valuable mainly for historians and best heard in the context of the entire <i>Safe     at Home</i> album.  Suffice to say, it's an underdeveloped band that can occasionally stun you into     submission (the steaming ""Luxury Liner"", or the waltzing tribute to monogamy and masculinity, ""Strong     Boy"") and other times sound like a disorderly, if endearing, garage-rock band with way too much emphasis     on tambourine.</p>
<p>Due to contractual obligations, Lee Hazlewood, founder of the LHI label, took all but three Parsons tracks     off the original album-- although, by all accounts, he was the auteur of the entire recording. Parsons has     come back here with a vengeance: For starters, 19 of the 28 supplementary tracks feature Parsons on lead     vocal. Whether you think this package is worthwhile is entirely dependent on whether you think Parsons     deserves this much credit.  On the album itself, McGuinn's belabored, satirical vocal on ""The Christian     Life"" is adequate, even beautiful, performed like a pop star who sings odes to woe while showering in     hundred-dollar bills.  Conversely, Parsons sounds like he's had a bloody nose for a week on the bonus     track presented here, giving the song a more sincere read than McGuinn's obvious pisstake.  He's also     drunk and has the stuttered, cracking delivery of someone who was self-schooled in a sand dune (which is     strange considering he was a spoilt egoist).  Of course, this begs the question of who exactly needs four     relatively-similar sounding versions of ""The Christian Life"" or ""One Hundred Years from Now"".  Well, I do.     I've been listening to those songs on repeat for years now. Finally, I can mix things up a bit.</p>
<p>While there are significant, if not epiphanic, variations in the second disc's working demos and rehearsals,     the causal Parsons fan will certainly be satiated by the '97 single disc. If you're a Gram man, on the other     hand, listening to the gradual development of the plaintiveness on ""One Hundred Years from Now"" or the     original sluggishness on ""Life in Prison"" is equivalent to bowing at Parsons' altar.

    listening to sine waves.  The sine wave is the cleanest, simplest tone possible-- just a pitch, no harmonics,
    no timbre.  It's the stuff of physics classes and test records, but for most of my life, it was not the
    stuff of music.  All that's changed.  I've spent many hours in the last couple years with at least a
    half-dozen records built primarily from sine waves.  Some of these I've listened to by choice (Ryoji
    Ikeda's <i>+/-</i>) some out of review obligation (So Takahashi's <i>30/30</i>); regardless, I've put
    in my time with the pure cycle.</p><p>
    I can't help but notice that most of the sine wave-based music I've heard comes from Japan. I'm sure it
    has something to do with the essentialism of the culture. I've seen Zen line drawings and I've read haiku,
    so I'm not surprised that Japanese musicians have an interest in the sine wave. For <i>Merge</i>, his
    second full-length album, Tokyo's Ken Ikeda claims to have constructed the record from a ""sound diary""
    he's kept since 1990. This stockpile of tapes consists of ""fragmental pieces of sound reflecting my
    everyday life over these years."" Only a Japanese musician would have a 12-year sound diary consisting
    primarily of sine wave tones.</p><p>
    ""Merge"" and ""Lightdark"", the first two tracks on the album, are the cleanest; both are essentially simple
    drones with just a faint hint of pitch and textural movement.  They're nice enough if you go for this sort
    of thing, but they ultimately serve as a prelude to better material. With ""Cityscape"", Ikeda delves into
    more interesting territory. Like the first two tracks, sine wave drones are the primary focus, but here
    they serve as what I can only describe as a sheer ""curtain"" that hangs in front of the primary melody.
    The pitch-perfect sounds draw your attention, but if you listen more deeply you can hear what is really
    the guts of the track taking shape in the background.</p><p>
    This obscuring effect is even more pronounced on ""No Beginning Nor End"". I doubt Ikeda designed this track
    with my physiology in mind, but ""No Beginning Nor End"" has a drone somewhere in the 1.5k range, which
    happens to establish a perfect standing wave in my ear canal. The air in my ear resonates loudly at this
    pitch no matter what volume I select, which artfully obscures a music-box melody and light drumming
    happening somewhere in the murky corners of the track. I'm reminded of Luis Buñuel's observation about
    film that every object in the frame obscures an object behind it.  Arranging material in space is the
    art of deciding what to obscure and how.  Ikeda uses his sine wave tones to arrange sound in a
    three-dimensional space, so that it lies behind (not just underneath) the primary tone in front.</p><p>
    As <i>Merge</i> progresses the character of the album shifts and sound become more complex. The cluster
    of tones that tumble about randomly in ""Gate"" have the chime of bells, and ""Usual Path"" inverts the
    special relationship of ""No Beginning Nor End"", putting the metallic percussion in the foreground and
    burying the drone. The changes are subtle, but after 11 tracks and 55 minutes, you do feel like you've
    been on a journey, even if you haven't traveled terribly far. Twenty feet is a long way if you're a
    snail.  (Who said that?  Basho?)  In any event, listen to <i>Merge</i> a few times and I'm sure you'll
    find a koan in there somewhere. It's that kind of music.</p></div>"|4148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4148-merge/|6.6|Mark Richardson

    quizzical glances began whizzing across record store floors almost immediately, as packs of perplexed fans
    attempted to reconcile Beam's gritty, unpretentious four-track folk to his thong-friendly, neon pink
    surroundings.  Luckily, neo-blues banjo-crooner William Elliott Whitmore's hometown address checks out
    alright: Whitmore was raised in a small Iowa locale dug deep into the banks of the mighty, cred-bestowing
    Mississippi, thereby making it forever safe to presume his banjo theatrics and whiskey-drenched mumble
    have been, um, authentically rendered.  Breathe easy.</p><p>
<i>Hymns for the Hopeless</i> is Whitmore's proper debut, but his relaxed, porch-singer poses suggest
    he'd been playing the bedroom-poet game long before these compositions were being officially documented:
    <i>Hymns</i> pairs Whitmore's deep, throaty vocals with scratchy banjo and skittering harmonica, and the
    subsequent songs seem both intensely indebted (see Leadbelly, Doc Watson, and the grisly, murder-and-redemption
    narratives of Johnny Cash) and oddly anachronistic-- an artful, evocative fusion of bellowed country,
    sheepish folk, and filthy blues, as unexpected as it is familiar.</p><p>
    
    Percussion (usually delivered via handclap, and provided by Lucas Tweedy or the fantastically named Michael
    Cornelius Lust) occasionally breaks in, as does organ, bass, and some acoustic and brass finger guitar,
    but for the most part, <i>Hymns</i> is a one-man show-- and Whitmore's thick, easier-than-Waits growl is,
    fortunately, dynamic enough to carry nearly all of that burden.  The record opens with an a capella lament
    to lifeless hearts (""Cold and Dead"") that might fare better had it been buried a little deeper in; Whitmore's
    concentrated voice takes time to acclimate to, and ""Cold and Dead"", with a little over three minutes of
    pure, uninterrupted warble, can be a sort of overwhelming introduction.</p><p>
    
    ""Sometimes Our Dreams Float Like Anchors"" is a lilting, bang-and-whimper parable (check Whitmore's
    prophesizing: ""I'll be free when I'm dead"") told by way of slinging hammers and completed by feisty drum
    rolls, well-timed bings, and Whitmore's persuasively sweet strumming.  ""From the Cell Door to the Gallows""
    is Whitmore at his best: spare banjo plucks and a meandering vocal melody showcase his soulful, honest
    intentions and proclivity for wearied sighs.</p><p>
    
    Authenticity, regardless of its relative worth, is bound to be a big issue for Whitmore, mostly because
    <i>Hymns</i> borrows so heavily from its Delta predecessors, and does so in a way that's not particularly
    apologetic. He tackles the proper poetic terrain-- slow, sad songs about drinking, loving, losing, devils,
    and shotguns-- letting his voice quiver, bend, and purr just like his backyard river, rushing in all the
    right spots.  So even if <i>Hymns</i> occasionally seems like paint-by-numbers blues, it's also an
    astoundingly well-rendered likeness, teeming with unmistakably genuine hollers and cries.</p></div>"|8762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8762-hymns-for-the-hopeless/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

    what critics and fans found so engaging in their out-of-leftfield successful self-titled debut.
    Initially seen mainly as purveyors of atmospheric psych-folk, the band has since studiously expanded
    its range, venturing into more conventional midtempo indie territory with a few flashes of more centralized
    alt-country inflections.  <i>Aztec Discipline</i>, brimming with nascent virtuosity, retains the spacious,
    creeping, melody-glutted sensibilities of their previous albums, but hints that their best material may
    yet be unrealized-- here, they retain all of their earlier strengths (intelligent, breathy vocals, lush
    harmonies, a certain vintage) while branching out into more frolicsome territory.</p><p>
    
    The album openers, ""Pelz Komet"" and ""Crowler in the Rumbleseat"", nearly skip off the CD with candid pop
    immediacy and adroit craftsmanship.  Both spring forward, showcasing several distinct melodies, which gives
    the impression that you've just heard four songs in eight minutes.  The prior glides into a steady acoustic
    rhythm before it spins off an angled electric guitar jam and discharges with a stuttered finale of piano
    driven buoyancy and recurrent utterances of, ""Time is all your own when go it alone and there's no one
    there to tell you when you're already home so don't wait another second/ Take a step in that direction.""
    The latter slides between similarly upbeat propulsion and a gorgeous sidestepped guitar progression coupled
    with Brian Wilson inflected layered harmonies.  Think of a hepped up Radar Brothers with an engaged sense
    of levity.</p><p>
    
    Familiar dreamy meditation and gentler affinities befall the middle third of the album.  Though no songs
    truly falter, none equally parallel the level of excellence established by the first two. ""Grape to Grains""
    finds the band wading in textured Brit-country waters, with slide and acoustic tones twinkling above placid,
    low-mix harmonies. The biggest departure is likewise the biggest speed bump; the aimless distortion of
    ""De-Da Dementia"" conspicuously finds the song playing the band, rather than the other way around.  The
    Kingsbury Manx's most realized moments are spun when the band is fully in control, playing with a confident,
    structured melodic discernment and clear-cut vision. Such is the case with tenth-frame ""Fixed Bayonets"", a
    laidback confluence of sleepy harmony, banjo and guitar.  This, along with a few other flares of effortless
    excellence, showcase the band's true potential.</p><p>
    
    Curiously, The Kingsbury Manx released a separate five-song effort, <i>Afternoon Owls</i>, a mere month
    before <i>Aztec Discipline</i>'s release, comprised of sturdy, well-seasoned and multi-textured efforts,
    with a near perfect pitch.  Though a commonly propagated conviction, if narrowed down to an EP's worth of
    material and collated with the best of <i>Afternoon Owls</i>, a near perfect album is quietly tucked away.
    As is, the mirth we're left to soak in is as high a yield as most efforts in this sonic realm: smooth,
    relaxed, and rustic music put together with tender lovin' care.</p></div>"|4453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4453-aztec-discipline/|7.1|William Morris

    Way</i> and <i>Bitches Brew</i>, and focusing on the development of his live show.  His band included
    some of the greatest session musicians in jazz at the time: bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea,
    and drummer Jack DeJohnette, and all were helping Miles to push the musical ideas he'd introduced on his
    records into uncharted territory in concert.  But he was also very much inspired by the concept of using
    recording studios as compositional instruments, and when he set out to create the soundtrack to an obscure
    documentary on boxing icon Jack Johnson, it turned out he had many more ideas than could possibly find
    their way onto two sides of a single LP.</p><p>
    
    Following in the vein of Miles' recently issued <i>Complete Sessions</i> box sets for <i>In a Silent
    Way</i> or <i>Bitches Brew</i> (and featuring more raw material than either), this new five-disc collection
    shows a man consumed with evaluating the arsenal at his disposal.  That meant recording countless takes on
    a theme, and, with assistance from producer Teo Macero, splicing those takes together into one coherent
    40-minute release: 1971's <i>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</i>.  But now, this compilation documents the
    sessions in their virtual entirety (there are a couple of missing takes, but nothing too essential),
    offering an incredible six hours of largely unheard material.  As with the previous boxes from this era,
    fans will delight in hearing just about everything the musicians put to tape, as well as paging through
    the invaluable session info, extensive liner notes, and unseen photos included in the extensive and
    beautiful packaging.  Obviously, though, anyone who hasn't heard and loved the original <i>Jack Johnson</i>
    album should check that out before dropping $60 on this exhaustive collection.</p><p>
    
    Disc one opens with several takes from a February 1970 session of the misleadingly titled ""Willie Nelson""
    (it is, in fact, a Miles Davis original)-- much of which was incorporated into the original LP's largely
    ambient piece ""Yesternow"".  The band, which here features Miles, Corea, Holland, DeJohnette, bass clarinetist
    Bernie Maupin, and guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, set up a downbeat-heavy groove that
    reminds me of Funkadelic's ""Music for Your Mother"", if much less drugged-out.  Davis enters about 40
    seconds into ""Willie Nelson (Take 2)"" with a typically elongated phrase before settling into his ""jab""
    motif with Maupin.  Each take of the song offered here center around melodies similar to this one-- the
    real differences lie in Sharrock's, Miles' and Maupin's solos.  It's a great way to kick off the set, if
    not quite as fiery a start as the original LP's ""Right Off"".</p><p>
    
    Later that month, Miles reconvened with a smaller band, keeping his rhythm section fully intact, but
    trading in Sharrock, Corea and Maupin for 19-year-old saxophonist Steve Grossman.  They recorded a couple
    of speedier takes of ""Willie Nelson"" that boast more colorful McLaughlin lines and Grossman's pleasantly
    spooky soprano.  Miles also gives some great solos, even sporting some of his bebop chops at times-- sax
    player Gary Bartz, a member of Charles Mingus' Jazz Workshop and soloist on Miles' <i>Live/Evil</i>, said
    that some of the most exciting moments during the shows that eventually comprised the 1974 live offering
    <i>Dark Magus</i> were when Miles would reach back into history to pull out some of his old runs, and
    they certainly shine here.  This band also tries out three versions of a tune called ""Johnny Bratton""
    (previously unreleased, and starting the run of songs titled after boxers), a very rock-centric piece
    that sounds a bit like they were unsure of how to really nail this style.  ""Johnny Bratton (Insert 1)""
    is basically straight-ahead rock pounding (something like a fusion approximation of ""Louie, Louie"")
    with McLauglin doing his best to ensure that any tonal center is wiped out, and Holland entering with
    some admirable fuzz-wah bass playing.</p><p>
    
    In early March, Miles again headed into the studio with this same band to cut ""Archie Moore"" and several
    versions of ""Go Ahead John"".  The former tune is a hard blues number with some very potent lines from
    McLaughlin-- in fact, Miles and Grossman sit this one out entirely, allowing the trio to bring it home
    like a seasoned rock band.  Five takes of ""Go Ahead John"" pop up on disc two, showcasing Miles' midnight
    cool melody.  The first part is a sparse, somber exercise in minimal blues, and features McLaughlin reeling
    off short, staccato statements similar to the ones played by Sharrock on the first disc.  The second part
    of the tune is an odd combination of jittery funk and acid-rock, with DeJohnette playing a prehistoric
    drum-n-bass pattern and Holland holding a single bass note while McLaughlin shreds on the right.  All
    five performances were later edited into a version released on 1974's <i>Big Fun</i>.</p><p>
    
    Mid-March saw Miles lay down two takes of the previously unissued ""Duran"" with McLaughlin, Holland, Maupin,
    soprano saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and drummer Billy Cobham.  Miles' band was certainly getting a better
    idea of how to construct ""simple"" funk, as the basic, syncopated groove here could have been played (though
    never written) by any number of funk bands at the time.  However, the robo-tight interplay of Cobham and
    Holland, along with McLaughlin's ever-edgy solos, make it much more interesting than just any ordinary
    breakdown.  Miles reports, ""that's some raunchy shit, y'all,"" and he's right.  These guys (exit Cobham,
    enter future Return to Forever drummer Lenny White) also did the stop-time, angular funk tune ""Sugar Ray"",
    which Bill Mulkowski's liner notes curiously describe as ""Devoesque"" and ""proto-punk.""  It sounds more
    like The Meters playing head games to me.</p><p>
    
    As April came around, Miles re-entered the studio with McLaughlin, Cobham, Grossman and Mike Henderson,
    a teenage bassist from Aretha Franklin's band, to record ""Right Off"" and the first half of ""Yesternow"".
    These two songs, of course, ended up serving as the tracklist on the original <i>Jack Johnson</i> LP,
    and anyone familiar with that record can attest to just how beautifully they pulled off ""Right Off""'s
    uptempo shuffle, with McLaughlin's aggressive outcomping transforming the track from a merely interesting
    jazz experiment to full-on streetwise fusion.  Herbie Hancock dropped by the studio as well (from the
    grocery store!) and got talked into laying down a fuzz-fried solo on Farfisa, a kind of organ he'd never
    played before.  The track ended up purely celebratory, and the four takes on disc three provide just about
    every solo angle you could want.  The two lengthy takes of ""Yesternow"" offered here are masterful runs
    into electric ambience, but inevitably not quite as interesting as Macero's final album edit.</p><p>
    
    In May, Miles added Keith Jarrett and percussionist Airto Moreira to the mix, cutting versions of ""Honky
    Tonk"" and ""Ali"".  A short excerpt of ""Honky Tonk"" ended up on <i>Live/Evil</i>, but until now, the track
    has never been released in its entirety.  Shame, too, because it's an excellent slice of blues-rock: Miles
    plays with confidence using an octave pedal while McLaughlin peals out still more spiky color for Jarrett
    to run rampant over.  Considering that <i>Jack Johnson</i> would be Miles' last studio recording until
    <i>On the Corner</i> over two years later, it's hard to believe this song wasn't issued somewhere along
    the line.</p><p>
    
    ""Ali"", leading off disc four, sees the same band (here including longtime Elvin Jones collaborator
    Gene Perla, who nicks a riff from Hendrix's ""Who Knows"") following a groove similar to that of ""Willie
    Nelson"", but with a much better idea of how to flesh it out.  And then there's ""Konda"", which the guys
    recorded without a bassist at all, and which didn't see release until 1981's <i>Directions</i> compilation.
    Jarrett's opening solo on electric piano perfectly sets up Miles' eerie, beautiful melody, and McLaughlin's
    harmonic work is practically unearthly, helping to make this track one of the box set's coolest pieces.
    Miles followed this muse a few days later for takes on Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal's ""Nem Um Talvez"".
    Neither of the versions here are the one from <i>Live/Evil</i>, though the second is remarkably close.</p><p>
    
    Miles wrapped recording in June, but not before taking most of the band from May's sessions (adding old
    friends Hancock and bassist Ron Carter) back into the studio for one last go at ""Nem Um Talvez"", three
    other Pascoal pieces (""Little High People"", ""Selim"", ""Little Church""), and another Davis original titled
    ""The Mask"".  All of Pascoal's ballads seem to advance the side of Miles' music best heard on <i>In a
    Silent Way</i>, and serve notice to anyone who thought he'd abandoned that style for good at the turn
    of the decade.  Unfortunately, ""Little High People"" is almost distractingly straightforward, at least in
    principal: The uptempo pop/rock groove brings Hancock's organ transmissions down to earth, and keeps Miles'
    wah-wah solos a bit too in check.  Meanwhile, ""Selim"" (really just ""Nem Um Talvez"" with a different title)
    ended up on <i>Live/Evil</i>, along with the two versions of ""Little Church"" found on this set's fifth
    disc.  Dave Holland came back to the fold to record both parts of the previously unreleased ""The Mask"":
    the first is a very out, keyboard-heavy free-jam with little assistance from Miles or McLaughlin, while
    the second-- hardly easy listening-- closes the sessions with an exhausted, punchdrunk swagger, finally
    collapsing after nearly 16 minutes.</p><p>
    
    The box, however, ends on a high note, with the original LP versions of ""Right Off"" and ""Yesternow"".  I
    hesitate to go through them blow by blow because anyone investing in this box will almost certainly have
    already heard them many times over.  Which, ultimately, is my only real caveat to <i>The Complete Jack
    Johnson Sessions</i>: there's more of interest here to fans; for a casual listener to tackle all five
    discs would be commendably ambitious, but an arduous challenge nonetheless.  This set ranks behind both
    the <i>Bitches Brew</i> and <i>In a Silent Way</i> boxes in terms of the amount of music I'd want to just
    let play, uninterrupted.  However, Miles Davis is one of those rare musicians who rarely failed to let a
    take pass without trying out something cool.  As usual, the deeper you dig, the more you find.</p></div>"|2200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2200-the-complete-jack-johnson-sessions/|8.6|Dominique Leone

    their frailties, frontman Matt Berninger staggers down side streets transcribing the language of his failed
    relationships.  What separates him from the throngs of sadsack superstars and raises his personal pity
    party to a less solipsistic melancholy isn't necessarily his lyrics, his image, or even that he's not
    actually a superstar, but rather, his ability to implicate himself in the fray.</p><p>
    
    Since The National's excellent self-titled debut in 2001, the Brooklyn-via-Cincinnati quintet has continued
    developing its hard-knock aesthetic, and lucky for the listener, Berninger's relationships don't appear to
    be getting any better. Bearing similarities to <i>Revolutionary Road</i>, Richard Yates' classic critique
    of dreamless suburban emptiness, <i>Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers</i> lives up to its blunt title-- Berninger's
    moribund tales are shot through with the rich beauty of a rotten sky glanced on the way home from an
    argument, his self-effacing barbs matched by the band's equally potent hooks. On the debut, Berninger was
    obsessed with nightingales, crows and rivers, and the vagaries of love's beauty. Here he whispers more
    bird metaphors (cardinals, doves, and hawks) and intones about the vast loneliness of being stuck inside
    your head.</p><p>
    
    Though it sometimes lacks the soft intimacy and hidden corners of the debut song cycle, the addition of
    viola, violin, piano, keyboards, french horn, and Wilco-styled electronics creates a bed of complex
    undertones that opens up the overall sound. Mining a newfound raucous vein, ""Available"" and ""Slipping
    Husband"" rock heavier than anything the band's released yet.  ""Available"", in particular, sounds more
    like something from the Interpol oeuvre than The National's barroom Americana. Barking questions like
    ""Did you clean yourself for me last night,""  ""Do you feel alone when I'm in my head?"" and ""Do you still
    feel clean when the only dirt is the dirt I left?"" beneath a wall of darkly jagged guitar incisions,
    the song climaxes with Berninger losing his grip, screaming himself hoarse. He wonders repeatedly, ""Why
    did you dress me down and liquor me up?"" as his perfect pace and phrasing explodes into the caustic
    shouts and coughs of a man losing his shit in public.</p><p>
    
    The most beguiling tracks, though, remain the hazy ballads. ""Cardinal Song"" cradles Berninger's advice to
    ""Never tell the one you want that you do/ Save it for the deathbed/ When you know you kept her wanting you""
    in a bed of echoed arpeggios, twangy chords, hushed backup vocals, cymbal washes, and brushed drums. During
    a jarring tempo shift played-out over a growling bass rumble and beautiful violin part he finishes off,
    ""Jesus Christ you have confused me/ Cornered, wasted, blessed and used me/ Forgive me, girls, I am
    confused/ Stiff and pissed and lost and loose."" Similarly paced, ""Patterns of Fairytales"" introduces
    electronics and drum machines as the soundtrack for a character obsessing over the mixtapes he gave his
    old girlfriends: ""I'm turning on the stereo/ And I'm lining up the names/ On the mixes I made before you/
    And I'm turning into fairytales/ With glitter and some glue/ Everything we ever planned to ever do."" The
    added bleeps, buzzes and quavering background sighs make it seem as though Berninger's doing karaoke,
    adding his vocal swagger to these remnants of his failed seductions, trying to transpose himself into
    the love songs he wishes he'd written.</p><p>
    
    Each of the dozen laments on <i>Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers</i> balance catchy choruses, exquisite
    instrumental interludes, and the complex words of a man's grieving. By the time you reach the final
    punch line of ""Lucky You"" you feel you know Berninger, want to offer him a coat, a smile, and some
    warmth to make it through another sleepless night.  But on second thought, with that added comfort

We gaze from our corduroy futons as a strange
    breed-- the photogenic-- entrench themselves around us. Numbed by our prioritization of hottie-dom, we
    fail to imagine the entertainment dawn ahead, when no ugly (or even homely or everyperson-looking) talents
    are left in the spotlight. Who among the current crop of shellacked chesthairs will inherit Christopher
    Walken's seat at the hall of goons? Will news anchors finally be replaced by seductobots, completing their
    ""evolution"" from those crusty-old-whitey beginnings? Will our children ask us to explain how Joey Ramone's
    visage ever escaped mandatory veiling? (The female version of this look-sharp arc is even more distressing...)</p><p>
    
    The acts on Saddle Creek Records are effervescently photogenic. Pictures of them are taken, and published,
    accordingly, to provide a record of how far inland the epidermal epidemic has spread. Before that strapping
    Conor Oberst belted his woes around the world, Omaha was considered by many outsiders as one of those zones
    in which no one could hear you scream.  Now, just as several eminent indie labels have done (Merge, Matador,
    etc), the Creek is celebrating itself and thanking its fans with a budget-priced, two-disc roster-showcase
    that balances the previously available with the unreleased, a self-consciously calmer election than the
    sometimes redundant or crass ""classics""/""rarities"" dichotomy. The compilation also reinforces the cultural
    significance of ten when it is multiplied by five.</p><p>
    
    Like the Drag City inbred buddy system, but cuter, Saddle Creek is rife with acts which are side-projects
    or recombinations of the label's key players: Now It's Overhead, whose two tracks showcase their shuffly
    R.E.Mism, contains Azure Ray, whose two tracks convey their evolution from gorgeous violin naifery to
    confident 4AD-caliber atmospherics. Desaparecidos is, of course, Bright Eyes with distortion; they include
    their album's most heartbreaking divorce anthem and a new song that actually benefits from the crap-scrapey
    production bonding its nuke-propaganda reels (""This explosion is one of the most beautiful sights ever seen
    by man""), its Tostito-crisp guitarvalanche (the chips are even featured backstage on one of this disc's 45
    tedious/harmless film clips), and Oberst's panic-attack stylings (""I don't want to fight in a war/ I don't
    want to fight in a war/ I don't want to fight in a war""). The lyrics don't offer anything newer than, say,
    that decade-old team-up between Slayer and Ice-T, but ""war sucks"" appears to have attained profound-banality
    status, and we are thusly obliged to favor its reiterations.</p><p>
    
    About the Bright Eyes song: Yes, it perpetuates Oberst's long ride atop a champion thoroughbred named Contradiction Shitstorm,
    as he auditions for the lead in <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Cobain and Mr. Sting</i>. The song's lyrics
    teeter from fascinatingly perceptive to idiotically obvious, from piercing to quaint (aww, who still says
    ""made love""?), from immediate to warmed-over. An ambitious screed about war-culture, ennui, eclipsed
    optimism, moodswings, and the weight of sex, the song flirts with its brilliant pop instincts but gets
    all complicated by the Saddle Creek soundalike syndrome, that tincture of Counting Crows-iness that is
    self-loving, but masochistically, reveling in the construction of altars to one's problems. At his best,
    Oberst is a conscientious and uninhibited examiner of manic yesterdays and corporate tomorrows; at his
    worst, he seems to be oversqueezing his teats to spray his audience with his precious soul-milk.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere: The Good Life remains a darker and often deliberately poppier reservoir for Cursive's emoid
    frontman-- the former's new song is an insidiously catchy Cure-homaging moper, and the latter's ""Nonsense""
    suffers from the risk it takes blending Bachmann-skronk with Smurf-scat. Mayday, whom you might know as
    Lullaby for the Working Class, don't outshine their hymnic already-available ""Captain"". Rilo Kiley
    includes her concert-closing chant-along ""With Arms Outstretched"", and an urgent femme-Pavement nugget
    either about depression or anorexia, or at least menstruation. Son, Ambulance won't escape ""mini-Bright-Eyes""
    dismissal, which is unfortunate because his arty-cruise-ship arrangements are so strong, and he's able to
    write and sing (though in a voice very similar to Oberst's) about a wider range of subjects. Sorry About
    Dresden prove that they deserve better than being considered the label's Cracker or Spin Doctors; see
    their Rousing Critique of the Superficiality of Hanging Out #345 entitled ""People Have Parties"".
    (Interestingly, The Faint side project Broken Spindles and Desaparecidos side project Statistics found
    homes on other labels.)</p><p>
    
    But my secret obsession, The Faint, own this comp's finest moments with their practice-space jam, ""Take Me
    to the Hospital"".  The Faint are much-reviled for being unnecessary arbiters of hump-me dystopia, but mang,
    they pretty much rule.  Their debut is embarrassing (ahem, see Fork-praised fadboys The Rapture's trajectory,
    cough, ahem), yet the synth overhaul of The Faint's 1999 sophomore effort beat a lot of the current
    keyboard/dance voguers to the punch.  ""Hospital"", for all its cheerleader nothingness (""Want you to take
    me the H/  Take me to the O/ want you take me to the S..."") is a booming, spiraling, handclapping,
    screeching, futro masterwork of a Various Artists toss-off. Perhaps The Faint's next full-length will
    tone down their concept-album inclinations as they embrace the fun of being frontrunners of a wave of,
    uh, re-runners, making the years between !!! and Sexual Harassment, or Ladytron and Romeo Void, seem like
    an instant.  Let's hope former skateboarder and frontman Todd Baechle doesn't end up singing to <i>Muppets
    in Labyrinth Reloaded</i>.</p><p>
    
    When I set out to follow The Faint for four days, bringing some brusque friends to annoy them and offset
    their borderline vapidity and nauseating photogenicness, I sent the band this fallacious letter, angry
    about The Faint's most recent ""anti-corporate"" album:</p><p>
    
    ""Why the fan-rape, you culture-juh-huh-hammers?  I just bought some tickets for The Faint, and was also
    forced to fuel an SUV for a Ticketmaster exec. WHAT THE FUCK? Why are you Total Jobbers with Ticketmaster?
    In case you don't know: THE FEES COST MORE THAN TWO TICKETS. For four tickets I paid 12 + 12 + 10 + 10 = 44.
    For the FUCKING ""convenience and processing"" fees I paid 4.25 + 4.25 +4.25 + 4.25 (convenience, to lubricate
    me) + 4.25 + 4.25 (processing, the actual ream) = 26 DOLLARS. FUCK YOU. I watched non-mall-punks have to
    shrug and go home, unable to buy tickets. I recommended they start swooning for Dischord bands. Rich kids,
    however, will be there for every subversive throb and squeal. Eddie Vedder's your outcredder. This seems
    cynical of you folks. Am I supposed to feel bad about the prospect of copying CDs for others from a fave
    label anymore? Am I supposed to get the same econo-critique rush from yer lyrics? Am I supposed to not
    chuck <i>Saddle Creek 50</i> into a landfill?""  Etc.</p><p>
    
    The Faint wrote back, noting with accuracy that I was a ""rude person,"" and that they'd try to make other
    arrangements in the future (some of their gear was stolen days later).  Anyway: My eternally drunken
    sidekick condemned <i>Saddle Creek 50</i> as ""the longest song I've ever heard,"" and I'll admit to being
    traumatized by a self-important soundman's mocking my status as the only person old enough to vote at a
    recent Cursive show. But The Faint's lovable fashion-dreck saves the Nebraska label's crew from sounding
    like children of the corn. I don't regret a minute of those consecutive days of being a pathetic Fainthead,
    even though I got so poisoned that I spray-painted my Mazda hot pink and ended up passed out on a faraway
    beach holding a hammer instead of my glasses. Police woke me to ask if I knew the naked woman in the water
    on PCP. My friends and I watched as the officers hauled her away. The scene would have made a perfect
    Faint video.</p></div>"|2025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2025-saddle-creek-50/|7.0|William Bowers

Like a lot of wholly original bands, they'd become ironically
    predictable: each album had the lurching start/stops, the grim ashen-throat vocals, and the jittery guitars
    that needled your ears like pipe cleaners.  In a world of stagey, contrived avant- and anti-rock, U.S.
    Maple were one of the few bands that didn't wink at you, and one of even fewer that could fairly claim
    to ""deconstruct"" rock music.  They'd honed a syntax that fused the obnoxiousness of no-wave and the
    methodical style of post-rock: the songs were willfully obtuse-- anytime you could make out the lyrics,
    the words made no sense-- and the pace was so uneven that they constantly threatened to lose all momentum
    and grind to a halt.</p><p>
    
    So there's a big surprise when <i>Purple on Time.</i> starts spinning: ""My L'il Shocker"" kicks off with a
    melody.  And there's a steady guitar line.  And the drums play a beat!  And then Al Johnson's singing
    verses!!  What?!  You're hearing it right: U.S. Maple are <i>actually rocking</i>.  It's odd, sure, but
    U.S. Maple's fifth disc is indeed their most conventional since their first: the one attribute it shares
    with <i>Talker</i> or <i>Acre Thrills</i> is its sparseness; otherwise, it's ridiculously straightforward,
    each track landing pretty much where you'd expect any rock song to, and each noisy break and anti-solo
    getting stuck in a bridge or an intro.  You know, where they ""belong.""</p><p>
    
    It's hard to guess why the band made this change.  You could point to new drummer Adam Vida, who's here
    on loan from run-of-the-mill alt-country act Central Falls-- he plays the way you'd want, say, some dude
    in Wilco to play, a solid timekeeper that can handle occasional disruptions, awkward silences, and abrupt
    returns-- but he could just as easily have come on board after the decision to switch things up (or down,
    as the case may be) was made.  Likewise, Mark Shippy and Todd Rittman's guitars still jerk and lurch,
    but they're less anxious; at times you even hear traces of slow, Zeppelin-like blues-- and what's with
    the ""Bron-Yr-Aur""-like acoustic interlude near the end?</p><p>
    
    The most obvious difference is a newfound sincerity, which you can hear in Johnson's singing.  He remains
    indecipherable, twisting, choking and curdling his lyrics, but there's more sentiment leaking out around
    the edges: sometimes hostile or cussed, he also sounds vulnerable, pleading on ""Oh Below"", or moaning
    through ""Touch Me Judge"" like he's crying at his ex-girlfriend's boarding house window.  That tone is
    even clearer on the band's cover of ""Lay Lady Lay"": instead of ripping it apart, U.S. Maple give Dylan's
    classic rock radio staple a shockingly straight reading.  The guitars are erratic, but rather than playing
    games with the song, U.S. Maple struggle like they're pushing a boulder, as if trying to figure out what
    to say with every note.  I swear Johnson's drawl sounds heartfelt, even when he's gibbering.  This is a
    U.S. Maple that's clearly changed their emphasis-- using their damaged syntax to sound honest, sad, and
    vaguely unreliable-- you know, the stuff you'd look for in ballads.</p><p>
    
    It's not all grim.  There's ""Tan Loves Blue"", after all, which trampolines ecstatically before wheezing
    down to the chorus.  But end-to-end, you get the idea that U.S. Maple just wants to reduce you to crying
    into your beer, and that may not be what you're looking for from them.  There's no question that this is
    their most genuine and (let's get it out of the way) ""accessible"" record to date, and while I doubt they'll
    ever do anything rote or boring, there's less to puzzle over here, and less of what makes their other work
    intriguing.  Naturally, after so many years of non-statements and hostility, there is something of a
    strange fascination that comes with hearing them in such an alien setting, but beyond that, I don't know
    that there's anything of real lasting impact.  Then again, transforming into an overqualified
    alt-country band could be the most hostile thing they've ever done.</p></div>"|8374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8374-purple-on-time/|6.6|Chris Dahlen

    it's monolithic.  That it all. Sounds. The. Same.  I can't remotely agree with the sentiment, but those
    who have this idea in their head don't often care to reconcile with the possibility that they may be
    mistaken. There's no such problem on <i>Pressure</i>, as The Bug skulks around the dancehall underground
    working with a variety of sounds and vocalists. He takes a distinctly outsider's view to the genre and
    scene, blending it with elements of his own dubby ambient work and other white-boy dancehall crossovers--
    German Basic Channel-esque minimalism, hard-edged beats, and ruff-in-the-jungle ragga.</p><p>
    
    Calling The Bug a Jamaican artist is, naturally, a fallacy in the first place. It's one of many pseudonyms
    for Kevin Martin, who also worked in Sonic Boom's space-rock collective EAR and who, with Justin K.
    Broadrick, creates ambient techno as Techno Animal and hip-hop as Ice, among other projects. Despite his
    restless genre-hopping, Martin has enjoyed his greatest successes working with elements of dub sounds and
    processes, most notably his first album as The Bug (1997's <i>Tapping the Conversation</i>-- yes, named
    for the Coppola film) and his work as the curator of the landmark <i>Macro Dub Infection</i> compilations.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Pressure</i>, Martin's exploration of the wildly creative and vital sounds of contemporary dancehall
    works best when he's at his most abrasive and least distant from its Jamaican progenitors. Tracks with
    ragamuffin hip-hop pioneer Daddy Freddy (""Run the Place Red"" and ""Politicians and Pedophiles""), longtime
    Martin collaborator Toastie Tailor (""Beats, Bass, Bombs, and Weapons""), and the Rootsman and He-Man
    (""Killer"") are the record's highlights, gruff and tumbling shards of sound system greatness.</p><p>
    
    When straying further from dancehall's frenetic, digital snap/crackle/pop, The Bug is less successful.
    Providing variety-- but with less interesting results-- are a handful of collaborations with London poet
    Roger Robinson, who offers spoken-word sentiments over sly ambient waves and rolling basslines, and former
    Rhythm &amp; Sound mate Paul St. Hilare, who chips in with some Horace Andy-like falsettos.</p><p>
<i>Pressure</i> is another blow to what I thought was an irreversible dislike of Tigerbeat6 Records and
    the juvenile, prankster-like approach to music that seemed to be the only feather in its creative cap.
    Then, after years of churning out sonic sludge-- often slathered over the works of far more creative
    artists-- dj/Rupture came along and had me at hello. <i>Pressure</i> (released on Rephlex in the UK)
    is another winner from the label. The more kinetic and abrasive the record gets the more it appeals to
    me, but its melange of elastic bass, distorted beats, and spacious pools of electronic dub offers a bit
    of something for everyone.</p></div>"|1086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1086-pressure/|7.2|Scott Plagenhoef

Schmidt and Drew Daniel simply assembled a bunch of
    tracks and called it an album.  Since then, the duo has placed concepts first, even while their execution
    has remained elastic: sometimes their overriding intent dominates a single track; sometimes the connection
    between a song and the whole is threadlike at best.  I'm partial to their last full-length, 2001's <i>A
    Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure</i>, but for some Matmos fans, their masterpiece remains 1999's <i>The
    West</i>, their least conceptually unified album since that first outing.  <i>The West</i> contains guitar
    and other stringed instruments that, in places, evoke the Sergio Leone ""big sky"" of the Western landscape,
    but it also has a fair amount of abstract electronic noise without any particular association.  Matmos had
    something in particular in mind for <i>The West</i> as a whole, but they weren't afraid to follow the
    tracks where they wanted to go.</p><p>
<i>The Civil War</i>, Matmos' latest, is cut from a similar cloth as <i>The West</i>, but with a more
    overt and unified concept. The through line this time is the martial music of war-- specifically the
    civil wars of America's north and south, and the British civil war of the 17th century.  Banjos, tubas,
    penny whistles, rolling snares, bagpipes-- sounds and textures from these conflicts are embedded in the
    folk music of the English-speaking world, and on <i>The Civil War</i>, Matmos create from them through
    sampling, processing, editing and arranging.</p><p>
    
    As a technical achievement and as a piece of pure sound, <i>The Civil War</i> is inarguably Matmos' best
    record.  Past Matmos albums have tried to create music from stranger sources and the results, while
    frequently brilliant and often amusing, sometimes lacked the sonic punch to put them over the top.  The
    raw materials here are things like piano, electric guitar, drums, and hurdy gurdy, so naturally this is
    far and the away the most <em>musical</em> Matmos we've heard.  The instrumental palette was beautifully
    designed, the layering and detail is amazing, and the computer often goes completely undetected-- in
    places, it really does sound like a credible string band arranged by someone from the 21st Century.</p><p>
    
    Another parallel between this album and <i>The West</i> lies in its lack of dancefloor accessibility: the
    loose-limbed funk that wormed its way through <i>A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure</i> is nowhere to be
    found here.  This is, of course, entirely appropriate considering <i>The Civil War</i>'s overriding theme.
    Instead, we get tracks like ""Y.T.T.E."", whose drums and bass swing hard, forming a groove that sounds
    something like a combination of ""Bo Diddley"" and ""You Can't Hurry Love"".  At nine minutes, it's one of
    the record's two centerpieces (the other being the equally long ""Reconstruction""), featuring Acetone
    frontman Mark Lightcap's guitar dancing nimbly above the beat.  As the percussion splinters and then
    fades, Lightcap codas with an effective bit of internal <i>Maggot Brain</i>-style soloing.</p><p>
    
    ""For the Trees"" slows things down with the kind of behind-the-beat shuffle that's become something of a
    Matmos trademark, and it works just right against the piano and violin, evoking a sepia-toned portrait of
    a lazy afternoon in the deep south.  The track's closing reprise strips away any trace of electronics and
    coasts into the horizon on an acoustic cloud.  The send-up of ""Stars and Stripes Forever"", meanwhile, is
    a sharp statement, skewering the pomposity of John Philip Sousa with dinky sounds and unsteady rhythms
    while secretly celebrating the spectacle of it all.</p><p>
    
    I have a feeling that Matmos' concepts serve mostly to constrict the limitless possibilities of sampling
    and sequencing-- deciding to use a fixed set of sounds necessarily limits choice, which has to feel good
    when you've mastered the computer and the world is your orchestra.  But sound and production aside,
    something isn't quite there. ""Reconstruction"", for example, follows a brilliant arc from a messy beginning
    of electronic squelches, reaches a jaunty middle with marching drums and a snappy guitar riff, then
    dissolves into a Reichian tremble of dense repeating keyboards before finally coming out the other side
    with a delicate banjo/steel guitar refrain. The construction of the thing is fantastic, the pacing just
    right, and yet, when that mournful banjo does its Bud Cort walk into the sunset, I just can't escape the
    feeling that there's less of an emotional core here than on previous offerings-- that the concept has
    perhaps taken too much precedence over the visceral delivery.  As such, <i>The Civil War</i>, while
    impossible not to like, is difficult to love.</p></div>"|5152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5152-the-civil-war/|7.3|Mark Richardson

At least that's how it seems sometimes.  After winning a Scribble Jam
    championship and releasing a series of incredible tour-only CDs, he was given the dubious honor of
    being recognized as an ""Internet superstar.""  2002 saw the release of his <i>Personal Journals</i>
    on Anticon's eponymous imprint, and while its emotional poignancy tapped a new vein in the hip-hop
    canon, valuing vulnerability over machismo façades, its detractors were brutal in their dismissal
    of its lyrics and style.  Now he's teamed up with longtime producer Joe Beats to develop <i>Hope</i>,
    and if the album isn't a direct response to anyone who ever dubbed him ""emo,"" it's proof he can play
    as hard in either arena.</p><p>
<i>Hope</i> shows a new Francis altogether, employing bouncy cadences, explosive deliveries and complex
    rhyme schemes.  The vast majority of the album references older hip-hop, including that of OC, Black Sheep,
    Beastie Boys, Audio Two, De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest, among others.  He even drops his own crit
    with lines like ""faker than Raekwon's stutter"" and ""Das EFX rocked that band-aid ten years before Nelly
    did!""  His writing focuses on lighter subjects here, from his disdain for rambunctious children (""Disasters"")
    to his views on commercial music (""Mainstream 307"") to his eccentric nature regarding different facets of
    existence (""Spaceman""), which all makes for a solid record that, in terms of both diversity and delivery,
    puts <i>Personal Journals</i> to shame.</p><p>
    The biggest testament to the looser nature of this album compared to his last is the inclusion of a fully
    developed song by his most popular alter ego.  Riding a bass-heavy doorknocker with a foreign vocal sample,
    ""Xaul Zan's Heart"" is one of Sage's funniest performances to date, as he plays the role of a misogynist
    pseudo-pimp that claims to be ""deeper than Sage Francis,"" ""the life of the search party,"" and a ""fairy
    godmotherfucker,"" closing the song with the rousing line, ""I am womanizer, hear me whore.""  If you've
    doubted Francis could be capable of diversifying, this track should change your mind.</p><p>
    Of course, Sage is still fully capable of the emotional style he built his name on.  Rapping over a swaying
    ambient track with lone trumpet salvos and subtle synths, ""The Cure"" closes the album with a tour-de-force,
    placing him in line as one of the best writers in hip-hop today: ""You're not the travelling type?/ Then
    hide your baggage better,"" he tells a significant other, while the repetition of, ""When a boy writes off
    the world, it's done with sloppy, misspelled words/ If a girl writes off the world, it's done in cursive,""
    stands as a powerful reminder to the inherent beauty of womankind.  Paired with a sharp rhyme scheme (""Now
    I look for air pockets to pick, walk with a stick/ Start picking locks with it, opening up heart-shaped
    lockets with little arguments/ Tawdry trinkets start to split and contradict/ Those who say one thing but
    think the opposite"") and a ridiculously tight flow, it stands as one of the year's most delicately and
    intricately written songs.</p><p>
    For a producer with such a low profile, Joe Beats makes an explosive splash in his first full-length effort.
    His chemistry with Sage Francis is apparent throughout the album, as their interplay is something many
    producer/emcee teams could benefit from further exploring.   Beats' use of beautifully raw drum programming
    hits like a more accessible Jel, and his mid-90s sampling style hearkens back to Pete Rock and Prince Paul,
    or the low-end proficiency of a young Ali Shaheed Mohammed.  From the floating, atmospheric keyboard of
    ""Spaceman"" to the triumphant horn-led acoustic guitar crisscross ""Tolerance Level"", Joe Beats easily
    manages to bridge the gap between forward thinking and traditionalism.</p><p>
    With <i>Hope</i>, Sage Francis and Joe Beats set out with an ambitious and impressive goal-- to create the
    ultimate 1994 record in 2003-- and they've succeeded admirably, paying tribute to the past while updating

Ice
    Cube's new compilation ignores these methods entirely. Gasp in wonderment: the album begins with a rambling
    pandemonium of tracks (brand new stuff, songs from the <i>War and Peace</i> fiasco, a couple of his classic
    early 90s songs, ""Bow Down"") and then, somewhere around the eleventh song, the album decides this was a bad
    idea and heads in reverse chronological order-- from 1993's <i>Lethal Injection</i> to his 1990 solo debut,
    <i>AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted</i>. The actual experience is like reading an anthology of unrelated essays and
    then watching them suddenly turn into a novel told backwards. It's either brilliant or idiotic, but I admit
    I doubt anyone thought Ice Cube would be the one to link gangsta rap and French avant-garde literature. I
    came into the CD just wanting to hear a few tales about some bitches, maybe some senseless claims of
    braggadocio, and I came out thinking about mobius strip sequences and reincarnation.</p><p>
    
    I only offer this flagrantly satirical critique of the album's arrangement because I know, from innumerable
    reviews, that there are apparently those who base their purchases on some minutiae like whether the most
    belligerent songs are saved for the middle of a collection like this or whether the <i>War and Peace</i>
    songs only occur at the end. I hate people like that. Go back to memorizing your index cards at that Vital
    Sounds store on Wilshire. Do you really think there's going to be some point where you sit on your chaise
    longue reading your <i>New Yorker</i> and sipping some cognac, considering the narrative arc and gradual
    characterization of a hits package?  It's <i>so</i> much more likely you'll be rolling on dubs, selling
    zooties out the trunk, driving your kid sister's twittering friends to a soccer meet, having never even
    heard the last half of the album because you were listening to ""We Be Clubbin'"" for the seventh time in
    an hour.</p><p>
    
    Besides, I sincerely doubt <i>Greatest Hits</i> will in any way disappoint your expectations. Every facet
    of Cube's career is at least partially represented: the ""Golden Age"" Bomb Squad-produced angry black man
    with an AK, a libido, a social conscience, and a penury of chivalry; the 70s funk-blasting lackadaisical
    stoner; the unconvincing <i>Chronic</i>-ripoff poseur; and the bizarre 21st-century white noise-and-bells
    godfather of gangsta, rhyming for image's sake and little else. There are, to be sure, modifications and
    breaches of these images, but, as a reviewer, I need to unfairly classify artists even if it detracts from
    their impact.</p><p>
    
    The actual songs obviously didn't require much forethought on the part of the compilers; the most casual
    MTV viewer should know most of these by heart: stripper-anthem ""Check Yo Self"", the g-funk <i>All in the
    Family</i> scenarios of ""Once Upon a Time in the Projects"", the deceitfully cynical strut ""It Was a Good
    Day"" (a good day because ""I didn't even have to use my A.K.""), and the emasculating shadowed thump of
    ""My Summer Vacation"".  Overall, it's pretty difficult to find fault with their selections.  While it's
    possible to wish Priority Records hadn't devoted about a third of the disc to Cube's post-Hollywood output,
    the singles from those admittedly mediocre albums are fairly resilient, even in the context of his best
    work.</p><p>
    
    There are some inspired, if not entirely revolutionary, choices here as well. I don't know how they were
    able to attenuate the original 10-minute Funkadelic homage ""Bop Gun (One Nation)"" down to a tight four
    minutes, but it's pretty successful at conveying this tribute amidst some of Cube's hardest-hitting lines.
    The rarely heard ""Jackin' for Beats"" off 1990's <i>Kill at Will</i> EP is what The Doors' ""The Changeling""
    would sound like if mixed by Santa Claus, L.A. riots, and copious and blatant references to ""Welcome to
    the Terrordome"".</p><p>
    
    There's also Westside Connection's ""Bow Down"", but this seems more like an acknowledgement of licensing
    limitations than a plea for the track to enter Ice Cube's canon. It's fairly irreconcilable to call this
    <i>Greatest Hits</i> while vaunting Westside Connection over the Dr. Dre collaboration ""Natural Born Killaz""
    or most of the songs from Cube's first two albums. There are also two new tracks which are far from ""great
    hits,"" and may not even make it to the <i>Miserable B-Sides</i> album: ""$100 Dollar Bill Y'All"" might
    contain the indestructible chorus, ""I'm in this bitch/ I've got a hundred dollar bill, y'all,"" but it
    offers very little else in its tepid delivery and hand-clap counterpoint, while ""Late Night Hour"" supplies
    overly melodramatic and creepily simple synths over unremarkable beats.</p><p>
    
    There isn't much else to say. Ice Cube deserves a best-of. This album contains most of the best of Ice
    Cube. Of course, <i>AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted</i> or <i>The Predator</i> are probably, in their entirety,
    better than this, but that's more a testament to the greatness of those albums; they're so good they're
    paradoxically better than Ice Cube's own greatest hits. To gather Cube's sound on his later releases,
    this is at least better than renting <i>The Player's Club</i> again, and acts as a certainly satisfactory
    introduction to one of the greatest American satirists since Mark Twain.</p></div>"|4147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4147-greatest-hits/|8.5|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

This Canadian band,
    fronted by Monstre (also known as ""(o)"", sometimes even known by his real name Phillipe Lambert) plays music admittedly influenced by Boredoms
    (and Can and Sun Ra, among others); right down to the colorful magic-marker sleeve design, it's obvious they aren't messing around with homage.
    Their sound takes elements of recent Boredoms, Beastie Boys-style rare-grooves funk, and what appears to be a love of Muppet-voices (I'm
    thinking Elmo), all in the name of an out-of-focus hodgepodge of beats and drone.  For the most part, I try not to get too hung up on similarities
    between bands, but in this case, it's something of a distraction.</p><p>
    
    ""Ah"" wastes no time in referencing sounds that Boredoms have recently made famous, as its primal, techno thud drums and filtered, major-chord synthoid
    arrangement reveal more than a passing fancy with Japan's finest punks turned hippies.  After the short introduction, hardcore drums crash through
    and the space-age cut-up strains of ""Biyah"" get their due.  Where this might have been garage trash in another era, here it's almost like an alien's idea
    of hip hop, with Monstre's ""vocals"" scratched and looped to the point where they cease being syllables and become percussive accents.  ""Chika"" slows the
    beat down, but keeps the turntable vox (which sound eerily close to Mike Patton's chik-chik exclamations on the last Bungle LP).  It also adds a
    church organ drone, and if you ever questioned Goa's will to pogo into trance, this tune will be happy to thrash you into submission.</p><p>
    
    The final track ""Ih"" stands to garner the most comparisons to Boredoms, as its tropical-themed ambience-- courtesy of beach sounds and noises from distant
    island fetes-- is coupled with German-imported communal trance; a chorus of shakers and bongos rage on like the younger, goofier cousin to Super Ae.  The
    extended outro sounds almost directly lifted from <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>, with plenty of electro-filter to blur the edges of their jungle bounce.
    Monstre's ever-present squeaks aren't quite the celebratory war cries that Eye used on his records, but then Goa isn't exactly on the same transcendent
    tip either.</p><p>
    
    Goa was named after a grotto in Bali (Goa Gajah), and it seems like there should be a way to make exotic, hypnotic music that doesn't necessarily have
    to make obvious connections to bands like Can or Boredoms.  Monstre speaks of the amazing Gamelan music he heard there, and I wonder if Goa wouldn't be
    more interesting taking an approach similar to another lauded tribal trance band, Vibracathedral Orchestra, and chase down their jams with a tad less
    emphasis on outright ""groove"", instead opting for less predictable terrain.  Surely, there's more than one way to get high.</p></div>"|3482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3482-goa/|5.8|Dominique Leone

    and fountain drink caps with straws still jabbed in them all rattling together in New York's rancid winds,
    fragments of trash and continuous street din, all mashed together as odors and noises both noxious and
    intoxicating.  It's the sound of years' worth of journal-like tapes made by Japanese improviser and
    current New York denizen Aki Onda.</p><p>
    Although his long history involves working with Boredoms' Yamatsuka Eye, Nick Cave collaborator Blixa
    Bargeld, Mego Records' pop deconstructionist Tujiko Noriko, and glitch pioneer Nobukazu Takemura, as
    well as releasing music under the name of Audio Sports, this is a highly personal work dealing with Onda's
    own memories, or rather, a trace of memories captured by a handheld tape recorder.  Through re-examining
    these lost moments of time spent wandering the labyrinthine cityscape, Onda has processed and tweaked
    aspects of the captured fragments and played them back in real time. Certain sounds rise out of the
    consommé, but they all get fed back into the mix, conjuring landscapes lost yet re-contextualized in
    the swirl of noise and wind.</p><p>
    For the uninitiated, I'd compare a piece like the opening ""One Day"" to the sort of psychedelia practiced
    by Austrian guitarist Christian Fennesz (circa <i>Instrument</i>), in that he takes the mundane sounds of
    a guitar and crafts something far greater as it loops and extends itself beyond its original shape. Onda
    spins a similar vortex from a forgotten lobe in the tapehead, taking in mechanistic clicks and sax honks
    from the street, along with an undertow of playground chatter, and twisting it together with a warped
    clatter of tinny percussion. ""Eclipse"" jumps around a bit more-- all ice cream trucks, cafe orders, and
    noisy jams cutting in and out-- before settling into a drony, indeterminate haze of sounds that flicker
    past like subway car windows under the street. The visual quality of French composer Luc Ferrari is a
    touchstone for these sounds, too. The opening burst of Tompkins Square Park percussion and bum hollers
    on ""Dream"" echoes the bongo fury that opens his <i>Danses Organiques</i>.</p><p>
    Cinema plays a great role in organizing the clamor. Onda openly acknowledges his debt to visionaries of
    the medium such as Stan Brakhage and Jonas Mekas. To that list I would add Chris Marker (an influence on
    Fennesz as well), as throughout this disc of ""cassette memories,"" he blends and blurs the audio fact with
    the subtle manipulations of the fictional and fanciful until it's impossible to separate the two extremes.
    ""Last"" has all the buzzy breath of prime Dead C stench, with tapes chirping backwards and gas pipes pinging
    about. The racket pushes and pulls with delirious speed, frames held for a second before blurring again.
    Even built from such cast-off garbage sounds, grimy and lo-fi, the residue of these hand-held tapes has a
    hypnotic and fascinating effect.  It's bits of fiery loft-jazz breath, yellow taxi traffic, rat death,
    Puerto Rican children in the streets, drunks yelling, pigeon shit, and the subway scrapes of raw brakes
    screaming in unified chorus.  Welcome to New York.</p></div>"|6090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6090-ancient-modern-cassette-memories-vol-1/|7.9|Andy Beta

    subsequent moment is heavy with the threat of total apocalypse: his face will start to crumple, tiny
    pink mouth stretching open, eyes fluttering and nostrils rearing, sticky fingers clamping down on blades
    of grass.  Onlookers will pause in thick silence, uneasy, leaning forward just a bit, waiting to see if
    what follows is a spit-riddled giggle or a belly-flipping scream.  Stellastarr frontman Shawn Christensen's
    voice has come to exist in that exact same purgatory, his deep, gut-borne howl flitting effortlessly from
    cautious whisper to full-on bellow, sometimes sinister, sometimes loving, always pulsing with the threat
    of complete breakdown.  The unpredictability of the situation is what makes it impossible; the prickly
    volatility is what makes it riveting.</p><p>
<i>Stellastarr</i> is the Brooklyn-born band's first full-length (duly preceded by 2002's three-song
    <i>Somewhere Across Forever</i> EP) and, with a dressed-in-black swagger reminiscent of fellow New York
    based art-punks Television and vocals reminiscent of 70s David Byrne, it's an apt portrait of what New
    York City has always been stupidly good at generating: thorny post-punk guitars, wild, undulating vocals,
    and plenty of cigarette-enhanced Lou Reed sneers.  Boston enters the picture as well: The Pixies serve as
    one of Stellastarr's more obvious parent figures; the hollow boy/girl vocal exchanges on ""Jenny"" are
    classic Francis/Deal.  Add this to the fact that this record was produced by Boston-based producer Tim
    O'Heir, who manned the decks for so many of the city's alterna-rock icons (Morphine, Juliana Hatfield,
    Dinosaur Jr.), and it's not too difficult to see how that early 90s college-rock aura could have seeped
    into these songs.</p><p>
    The band is young, though, and this being their debut album, they have some growing to do.  Their most
    noticeable weakness is the blatancy of their influences-- an easily acquitted misgiving, considering the
    disc's strengths.  In backing up Christensen's caterwauling, bassist Amanda Tannen, guitarist Michael
    Jurin, and drummer/keyboardist Arthur Kremer nobly transcend most art-school clichés (admirable, with
    three Pratt alumni present), pushing out dark, danceable new-wave that wiggles-in-neon like it's 1985.
    Opener ""In the Walls"" opens harmlessly enough, teaming pulsing video-game synths with Christensen's blank,
    creepy chanting; seconds later, the band kicks up and Christensen releases his open-mouthed howl, soaking
    the room with huge, dramatic screams.</p><p>
    The breathless, guitar-driven ""Jenny"" is the perfect opportunity to holler ""Jenny!"" as much as you ever
    wanted, a sinister homage to being screwed and screwed-up that showcases Christensen's peaceable-one-second,
    crackers-the-next vocal stylings (dude says ""motherfucker"" like he really means it!).  The bouncing,
    elastic ""My Coco"" is tough to follow, and Stellastarr starts to sag a bit in the middle before winding
    down, unceremoniously, with ""Pulp Song"", a track that-- cleverly?-- sounds kinda like a Pulp song.
    Stellastarr's bold, cinematic sprawl demands a certain kind of tolerance, and might require a few listens
    before you're able to fully adjust to its dramatics, but Christensen is, in the end, an oddly convincing
    leader, and, if nothing else, you'll at least be stuck to your headphones trying to guess his next move.</p></div>"|7715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7715-stellastarr/|7.4|Amanda Petrusich

    Neil Perry bobbed and swayed in basements everywhere to a cathartic strain of dark guitar chops, wisely
    calling it quits after four years while still at the top of their post-hardcore game. <i>Lineage Situation</i>
    is the child birthed from the band's tenure. Daunting in its inclusiveness, the retrospective graciously
    collects forty tracks as well as a 35-minute video hinting at exuberant sing-alongs and shoutouts to the
    kids and the crew.</p><p>
    
    Though 40 tracks and a rocker video may seem both Biblical and over-indulgent, the strongest pieces are
    four previously unreleased bits (that the scraps are this solid connotes an endless vault of hidden gems
    somewhere in the Garden State). In its four minutes ""Nine Minute of Non-Fiction"" features enough emotional
    guitar shifts for an entire short story; the instrumental ""Kicked"" tweaks the lush interiors of pretty
    head space with repetitious guitar lines that give the feel of an unresolved introduction; and ""What is
    in the Making"" is diligent in its melodramatic battle of soft/quiet, clean/distorted. As is often the
    case with late-stage hardcore, lyrics are secondary: the vocal lines exist as a layer of pestilence,
    something else to knock about in your ear while enact a beautifully parsed robotic conniption across
    the dancefloor.</p><p>
    
    Syllables do play a part, of course. Loud guys with chips on their shoulders often opt to distinguish
    themselves through the use of lengthy ""clever"" song titles. Not above this practice, Neil Perry totter
    behind smarmy bits like ""Igor, My Girlfriend Dumped Me... Let's Write Sad Songs"" and ""I Bought This
    Southern Rap Compilation and All I Got Was This Lousy Hi-Hat."" (Yeah, The Locust do it too, but because
    they eviscerate their compositions, the added fat makes sense structurally.)  Forget the sophomoric
    college-boy humor; <i>Lineage Situation</i> is best experienced as a strand of raucous and anonymous
    minimalism.  Taken as a vaguely frantic tapestry, the comp succeeds as some truly toe-tapping background
    music; song titles in place, I'm reminded of one too many phony phone calls and a pair of fart jokes.</p><p>
    
    Beneath the grunts and growls, Neil Perry are comfort food, a sonic security blanket. And though this
    set ends with the almost heartbreaking screaming whisper of the truncated ""I'm Sad for You"", with the
    band's participants playing now in Hot Cross, Welcome the Plague Year, and A Life Once Lost, it feels,
    really, like Neil Perry hasn't gone anywhere. I like retrospectives and contextualization, and yes,
    Neil Perry were definitely among a 90s hardcore elite, but the super cozy familiarity of this borrowed
    aesthetic makes even the topmost guns feel ultimately expendable. I miss my Minor Threat woobie.</p></div>"|5882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5882-lineage-situation/|6.6|Brandon Stosuy

Though best known for his eccentric, anxious
    vocals and tangential lyrics with Talking Heads, his body of work is one of the most diverse in rock,
    ranging from his groundbreaking projects with Brian Eno, to his music for stage and theater, to his
    compilations which made 60s tropicalia a universally recognized genre, to his screenwriting, directing
    and scoring for film and video projects, Byrne has pushed himself to invent and innovate in every possible
    medium.  But even as he's constantly evolved as an artist, he's held true to one consistent element, and
    that's rhythm.  Nearly all of his music-- and particularly his last solo work, <i>Look Into the Eyeball</i>--
    has held some connection to the motion of what most writers generically refer to as ""world music;"" in Byrne's
    case it's specifically the music of West Africa and Latin America.</p><p>
    
    Though rhythm is hardly absent from his latest work, <i>Lead Us Not into Temptation</i>, it's by no means
    a dominant force in the music-- for this and several other reasons, this album represents an entirely new
    chapter in Byrne's book (it's also the first in years not to sport his Luaka Bop label's logo).  The
    primary reason that this album is so different from anything he's done so far is probably that it's a
    soundtrack, and the mood of the film has to dictate the mood of the music.  Byrne has scored several films
    in the past-- he even won an Academy Award for his collaboration with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Cong Su on the
    score for <i>The Last Emperor</i> in 1988-- but the post-noir drama of Scottish filmmaker David MacKenzie's
    <i>Young Adam</i> presents a very different challenge for a composer than Byrne has faced in the past.</p><p>
    
    To say Byrne is up to the task doesn't do him justice; <i>Temptation</i> is strong enough to stand with any
    of Byrne's other solo work, that rare film score that works beautifully as an entirely separate record.
    With the exception of the <i>Twin Peaks</i> jazz-noir of ""Seaside Smokes"" and the fantastic, sax-heavy
    arrangement of Mingus' ""Haitian Fight Song"", the album is stuffed with glassy, stately, almost static
    music that feels closer to Rachel's or recent Friends of Dean Martinez than Talking Heads or <i>Feelings</i>.
    Most of the film is set on a Scottish river barge, and the music captures the damp chill of the Scottish
    air and the fog rolling off the moors and lochs of the Highland countryside in the morning.</p><p>
    
    Byrne reportedly employed Cage-ian techniques-- such as dictating which notes could be played, but not when--
    to develop the majority of these pieces.  The approach keeps things moving at a sharp clip, ensuring that
    virtually none of the disc's tracks become predictable or tired.  ""Sex on the Docks"" is decidedly unerotic,
    but it still has a sense of tension and climax that befits its title, as rushing piano figures and harshly
    strummed acoustic guitar chase heaving cellos and violas.  The mix of hurdy gurdy and accordion provided
    by John Somerville and Appendix Out's Alasdair Roberts in the middle of the song also make for an unsettling
    texture.</p><p>
    
    Several of the string-dominated pieces are just flat-out pretty, each nudged subtly by percussion and drum
    programming, and none of them sound overtly similar to each other, despite that some of them even share
    recurring melodic themes.  Byrne's guitar playing throughout the album is masterfully restrained, and it's
    enough to make you wonder why more people don't praise him for his playing.  His lap steel on ""The Lodger""
    is ghostly an ephemeral, another layer in the fog of a work that at first might be mistaken for one of
    Stars of the Lid's ambient drones, but is soon joined by swelling strings and a voluptuous cello motif.</p><p>
    
    There are two vocal songs placed at the very end of the album, and each fits beautifully with the candor
    of the album.  The first, ""Speechless"", is centered around a strange moan-- Byrne using his voice more
    like a violin than traditional vocals.  ""The Great Western Road"" is more straightforward, a precisely
    metered slow song with Byrne in top form vocally and lyrically.  The opening lines, ""A man sticks his
    fingers inside of his mouth/ The words are stuck in there/ He fishes them out,"" are the best glimpse of
    the Byrne we've known and loved.</p><p>
    
    It's a fair bet that the concept of using Scottish musicians to score a film set in the Scottish heartland
    (the record features contributions from members of Belle &amp; Sebastian, Mogwai, Snow Patrol, The Reindeer
    Section, Future Pilot AKA, and others) appealed to Byrne because of his own heritage-- he spent the first
    seven years of his life in Dumbarton before his family relocated to Baltimore.  The final result is nearly
    an hour of arresting music that we might not have exactly expected from him, but that nonetheless functions
    as a fitting tribute to his homeland, as well as an effective mood piece.  It seems a safe bet that this
    is more a detour for Byrne than a new direction, but it shouldn't be overlooked for that.  <i>Lead Us Not
    into Temptation</i> is a powerful recording, and yet another engrossing chapter in an inestimably great
    career.</p></div>"|1062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1062-lead-us-not-into-temptation/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    or you aren't), an attitude that often breeds complacency.  With songs
    averaging around two minutes, replete with gratuitous pop-culture references
    and illusory in-jokes, and devolving occasionally into inscrutable ramblings,
    Green seems to fit the mold of college-quadrangle-musician jamming ironic
    Bob Dylan covers for the Birkenstock literati.  His best work, though, is
    self-indulgent, redundant, and exasperating, and therein lay its charms.</p><p>
<i>Jessica</i>, a five-song EP of old and new material, contains dashes of 60s
    folk, country, lo-fi pop, and a recording of a child singing an anti-smoking
    commercial.  Two songs are from Green's recent full-length album, <i>Friends of
    Mine</i>, and one is a cover of The Beach Boys' ""Kokomo"", with Ben Kweller.
    The title song, ""Jessica"", is about pop icon/mammary-spectacle Jessica
    Simpson, whose nonsensical musings have been on painful display recently on
    MTV's <i>Newlyweds: Nick &amp; Jessica</i>.  Here, a resounding string arrangement
    (cello and violin, I think) lends a bigger-than-usual sound to the guitar,
    bass and drums trotting behind Green's mordant lyrics.  ""Jessica Simpson/
    You've got it all wrong/ Your fraudulent smile/ The way that you faked it
    the day that you died.../ My body's in a shambles/ Encrusted with brambles.""</p><p>
    
    A similar string arrangement frames ""Friends of Mine"" where Green flutters a
    ""Whoa-oh-oh-oh"" through the chorus in Sinatra-like fashion.  ""What a Waster""
    is vintage Green, strumming guitar and lamenting about the dysfunctional
    sad-sacks that somehow weasel their way into his life.  But my partiality
    to ""Kokomo"", the last song, is probably owed more to an awkward and deeply
    uncomfortable infatuation with the song itself than to Green and Kweller's
    version.  I'm not a fan of Kweller, but Green couldn't have dreamed of
    pulling this song off without Kweller there to hit the high notes.</p><p>
    
    These are simple-- and sometimes inspired-- songs.  But the lo-fi charm
    occasionally wears thin on <i>Jessica</i>, especially on the aforementioned
    child's ditty ""Don't Smoke/The Bronx Zoo 1989"", which brings me around to
    my biggest complaint about Green: he needs editing.  Being only ""medium-serious""
    about your music allows you freedom to experiment, to stumble clumsily into
    new territory, and to shirk accountability when you fail.  It's also an
    impediment to greatness-- Talking Heads, Wire, and The Pixies couldn't have
    reached such heights without risking potentially looking like jackasses--
    but with Green's greatness still in development, it remains to be seen what,
    if anything, all of this is leading to.</p></div>"|3626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3626-jessica-ep/|6.1|John O'Connor

    for all intents and purposes, comprised ""indie rock"" as I first came to know it.  The name Sunny Day Real
    Estate still triggers all sorts of fantastic images: I studied Latin every morning on the bus while
    listening to <i>Diary</i>; <i>LP2</i> was the first album I would buy at Philly's Spaceboy Records
    (which thereafter had a monopoly on my time and earnings until I moved out of the city); the review
    of <i>How It Feels to Be Something On</i>, for better or worse, was my first encounter with Pitchfork.
    And though I'd be unlikely to count any of that band's albums among my all-time favorites, I can't help
    but feel like Jeremy Enigk has a lot to do with my degree in Classics, my current writing projects, and
    the bulk of my record collection.</p><p>
    
    After Sunny Day's second (and final) demise in 2000, I assumed Enigk would release another pleasant solo
    album, or maybe regroup with a new cast entirely.  But in fact, Sunny Day simply regrouped <i>again</i>,
    as The Fire Theft, sans guitarist Dan Hoerner.  Fair enough!   This was good news, so far as I could tell,
    and I was positively thrilled to see what developments the sound of the band, now reunited with original
    bassist Nate Mendel, had undergone.  Maybe they'd even shake off their prog phase!</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, <i>The Fire Theft</i> actually sees the band indulging in ersatz approximations of Yes and
    Genesis' epic odysseys much more deeply.  The problem isn't so much in the band's decision to branch out--
    that, I respect-- but that their moody, foreboding ambient segues fail to translate into much of interest
    for the listener.  I can dig ambient preludes on rock records if they have a sense of direction, lend
    weight to album's overall mood, or merge nicely with the tracks they're sandwiched between, but these
    sorely lack originality-- all are nearly identical in mood and scope-- and seem to have little to do with
    the songs into which they inevitably segue.  The record opens on two of these: the first sounds ripped
    from one of the quieter moments of Moby's <i>Play</i>; the second (tellingly titled ""Waste Time Segue"")
    is a standard drone squeezed from a heavily reverbed piano.</p><p>
    
    The overuse of this ambient gimmick is also indicative of a larger problem, which is that the band
    seems terrified of personal conviction.  Even when The Fire Theft are purportedly kicking out the jams,
    the songs feel half-hearted and vaporous.  (To give you an idea, there are more songs in waltz-time here
    than I can ever remember hearing on any album, cross-genre.)  On tracks like ""Waste Time"", the band
    carefully regurgitates all the 80s rock tropes taught by local music store teachers, sporting all the
    traits of a wedding band ""stylizing"" a Police song.  ""Rubber Bands"" sounds most calculatedly young/hip,
    featuring a Braid-like b-section with diminished chords and pasty funk lines devoid of the rhythmic
    cleveries and emotional investment.</p><p>
    
    And it only gets worse.  The guitar solos-- of which there are more than a few-- are laden with the
    ostentatious bombast of any hair metal band you never liked, replacing sincerity with slick chops and
    bloodless effects. The drumming, whose consistency is both a virtue and a vice, is at all times precise
    but never inventive, content to stay predictably on the beat and bang a few toms for extra anthem power
    when necessary.  Going after Enigk's lyrics, meanwhile, is like playing an armless man in golf, but let
    it suffice that the following lyrics are wailed melodramatically: ""Lift back the veil that hides you from
    me""; ""How can you change your mind after all the dreams that we once shared?""; and my personal favorite,
    ""It's the simple things that are hard to grasp.""</p><p>
<i>The Fire Theft</i> is ultimately saved from total mediocrity by two songs.  One of them is ""Summertime"",
    a (surprise!) waltz which could draw comparison to Neutral Milk Hotel with a budget.  Here, Enigk gives one
    of the album's only convincing vocal performances over acoustic guitar, delicate string arrangements and
    an occasional breath of fresh electronic air.  And the closing ""Sinatra"" is The Fire Theft's most realized
    offering, showcasing the extent of Enigk's vocal range, tasteful dynamic changes, and the most integrated
    string arrangements on the album.  Sadly, the album fails to convince beyond these too-brief moments;
    worse, it never <i>tries</i> to, lazily substituting age-old gimmicks for actual, palpable spirit.
    Ironically, a desperate attempt to escape such listless vanity is what drove me to Sunny Day Real Estate
    in the first place.</p></div>"|3276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3276-fire-theft/|5.0|Nick Sylvester

My review for Ted Leo's fine <em>Hearts of Oak</em> was a telling example of this, as a number     of people wrote in to dispute some of my claims regarding their man and his music, despite my unbridled     enthusiasm for the LP.  Fortunately for my journo-cred, Leo just dropped this brief EP, conveniently timed     to remind all us crits to remember <em>Hearts of Oak</em> for our year-end lists.  In similar piggybacking     style, I'll go ahead and retract my previous erroneous statements here, so that the pristine fact-checking     reputation of Pitchforkmedia.com can be restored to its previous bowling-lane luster.</p><p><strong>Retraction #1:</strong> Ted Leo is not an incredibly short person.</p><p>Readers took issue with this characterization, though I distinctly remember all my close-up interactions     with the man being shoulder-height affairs.  Regardless, how could a scribe pass up the irresistible image     of the Little Man with the Big Voice?  It would, after all, come in handy for discussing <em>Tell Balgeary,     Balgury is Dead</em>, Leo's new take-home souvenir of his current solo tour.  Leo's recent one-man shows     have revealed him as the rare mod-punk that doesn't turn into a sensitive coffee-shop plucker when gotten     alone.  Resolutely plugged-in with blurred-hand strumming away and WD40 vocals blaring, his sans-Pharmacists     performances showed only a slight decrement in energy from the four-piece setup he usually tours with.     For easy comparison, feast on the version of ""The High Party"" included here, wherein Leo somehow manages     to navigate all the tempo complexities of the album version by himself, flying convincingly without a     rhythm section.</p>
<p><strong>Retraction #2:</strong> Ted Leo no longer lives in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I hadn't kept up on Leo's shifts in mailing address, and was unaware that he'd made the     move to New Jersey before the release of <em>Hearts of Oak</em>.  But can you blame me for wanting to claim     him as a District hero, given the slim pickings left in the wake of The Dismemberment Plan's dissolution?     For god's sake, that leaves us with nothing but El Guapo!  On recent tours, Leo's been celebrating his     return to Garden State residency with a version of ""Dancing in the Dark"" more spunky than The Boss ever     imagined, but sadly, <em>Tell Balgeary</em>'s budget apparently couldn't handle the royalties.  Instead,     Leo presents reverent, accelerated takes on tunes by The Jam, Split Enz, and Ewan McColl, whose ""Dirty Old     Town"" suits Leo's Irish tendencies like syrup on bacon.</p>
<p>Ted even tries to recreate McColl's pastoral reminiscences with his own ""Bleeding Powers"", which namedrops     South Bend (though not his ex-schoolpal Brent DiCrescenzo) alongside the pint-swinging sentiment ""the road     leads me somewhere/ But it's not yet to your door."" ""Bleeding Powers"" also features a tidbit of war     commentary, a topic Leo explores further (if not much more deeply) on ""Loyal to My Sorrowful Country"".     You can take the boy out of the District, but you can't take the politics out of the boy.  Top it off     with ""The Sword in the Stone"", a strong-popper in the traditional Leo style, and forecasts begin to look     pretty promising for LP #4.</p>
<p><strong>Retraction #3:</strong> The Pharmacists are not a transitory, revolving-door backing band.</p>
<p>Yeah, so apparently, The Pharmacists, which started out as a fictional entity for Leo's bedroom tape     experiments, have a lineup that's pretty locked in place now-- bassist David Lerner and Richard     Manuel-impersonating drummer Chris Wilson have provided the proverbial rock-solid rhythm for years     now.  I didn't realize how important they'd become on record until <em>Tell Balgeary</em>, though, because     it turns out that a faithful representation of Leo's superb solo live shows doesn't translate so well to     an ideal home listening experience.  Sure, this disc reflects the passion of Ted on stage, but it also     often sounds dashed-off, and not a little bit like listening to your roommate practice his punk band's     set in the next room.</p>
<p>The new songs offered on <em>Balgeary</em>, while promising, nevertheless appear in dehydrated form, demos     waiting for full-band arrangements that will hopefully capitalize on Leo's newfound grasp of keys and     dense percussion.  The covers are agreeable, but somewhat predictable, never revealing new angles on     his music like his live renditions of Curtis Mayfield's ""Keep on Pushin'"" do.  Two tracks of woah-dude     sound experimentation, hearkening back to the confused-dub of his immediate post-Chisel ""Tej"" days,     further decrease the EP's validity.  But <em>Tell Balgeary, Balgury is Dead</em> has that short-player     mentality, serving not just as tour merch, but also as reassurance that Leo's vocal cords all back in     order after the near-disastrous larynx cave-in he suffered on tour last spring.  That <em>Balgeary</em> isn't as indispensable a thin-slice as 2000's <em>Treble in Trouble</em> is a shame, but as a taste of     solo Leo for places his van never reaches, it's slightly more than a mere gap-stopper.</p>

    <i>Michigan Daily</i> offices reading copies of <i>Melody Maker</i>, I'd have learned that one rule in
    writing is that I should ""know my audience.""  And I'm pretty sure that, in this case, a large portion of
    my audience has already decided that they just might hate The Darkness.  I hope not, because making snap
    judgments-- especially ones based on anything except, y'know, what's coming out of your speakers and
    whether or not it engages you-- seems like a bit of a foolish thing to do.  If you're that convinced
    that The Darkness are a bad post-po-mo joke unfairly unleashed on the world, turn back now, listen to
    the new Books album, and feel safe in the knowledge that most of the Pitchfork staff probably thinks
    I'm nuts.</p><p>
    The Darkness are from England and they wear things like open-chested catsuits and tight trousers.  Sometimes
    these outfits are made of leather; sometimes they have animal prints.  The band members sport long hair and
    look like they stepped off the stage at Castle Donington circa 1980.  To a lot of people, this means The
    Darkness couldn't possibly be any good.  I wrote a one-act, one-man play about this idea titled <i>Proper
    Rock Fan: Pot Kettle Black</i>.  Take a look:</p><p>
<sub>
    SCENE: Virgin Megastore, Chicago.  A Proper Rock Fan scans the Top 40 albums wall.</sub></p><p>
    Proper Rock Fan: People are stupid for falling for music like The Darkness.  It looks phony, manufactured,
    and seems to take its image more seriously than its songs.  All music like that is shit.</p><p>
    [curtain]
    </p><p>
    Too often, music fans fall for marketing without realizing it.  For instance, by refusing to engage with
    a band like The Darkness on any level solely because of a preconceived notion of what they appear to be
    ""about,"" you'd actually be more swayed by marketing and image than the kids checking the disc out on
    the listening station.  Besides, looking silly-- or at least <i>risking</i> looking silly-- can only be
    good for a band like The Darkness.  Big Guitar Rock, after all, used to be silly.  It used to be pretty
    good, too.  AC/DC, Queen, Black Sabbath, KISS, and Led Zeppelin (have you seen <i>The Song Remains the
    Same</i>?) were all absurd.  Claiming any allegiance with the devil and buying Aleister Crowley's house
    are ridiculous prospects.  Smashing your instruments and lighting your guitar on fire are both pretty
    stupid-looking, too, when you get right down to it.  But that's the whole problem with rock right now:
    It doesn't do those things anymore.  There's nothing heroic about it, nothing demonstrative, nothing to
    capture the imagination.</p><p>
    So, then, what do The Darkness sound like?  Well, they're a blend of 70s pomp-rock, early 80s metal, and
    bombastic, shiny arena rock.  What they do well might be best exemplified by ""I Believe in a Thing Called
    Love"", which most effectively pairs their sense of theatricality and grandiosity with their penchant for
    great pop hooks.  Meanwhile, ""Black Shuck"" channels AC/DC (there really ought to be a lightning bolt key),
    ""Growing on Me"" throws back to David Lee Roth-era Van Halen, and ""Love Is a Only a Feeling"" invokes 70s
    rock ballad extravagance.  Elsewhere, ""Stuck in a Rut"", ""Get Your Hands Off of My Woman"" and ""Holding My
    Own"" demonstrate the range of singer Justin Hawkins' voice as it flits between all the classic rock modes:
    flamboyant, delicate, gravely.  They also have a delightful glam track called ""Friday Night"" that very
    nicely highlights his posh vowel sounds.</p><p>
    Granted, that's a lot of ""improper"" touchstones on the face of it, but American rock in recent years has
    included a clutch of updates on classic and arena rock-- from The White Stripes to Foo Fighters to Queens
    of the Stone Age to Smashing Pumpkins.  And truth told, The Darkness aren't even that different from these
    bands.  The Stripes' ""Black Math"" or ""There's No Home for You Here"", with their histrionic vocals and
    high-octane guitar solos, fit The Darkness' aesthetic to a tee.  (And ""Ball and Biscuit"" is winking conceit.
    Who's supposed to be the novelty act again?)  The difference is that The Darkness drop the tortured-artist
    shtick and write paeans to the unbridled joy of love where Jack White would be more inclined to grumble
    about the death of the sweetheart and chide a world that cares ""about nothing that is long term"" in the
    liner notes of a record he made with his ex-wife.</p><p>
    Tellingly, America's No. 1 movie at the moment, <i>School of Rock</i>, is built on the premise that rock
    is a relic relegated to history books as something kids need to be taught (after all, they're not learning
    about it in the streets).  It lovingly regurgitates classic 70s guitar-god clichés for examples.  When it
    comes down to it, the best youth culture is dangerous and offbeat and audacious, and currently, rock is
    none of those things.  It's no wonder that this week, for the first time, the Top 10 singles on the
    <i>Billboard</i> charts are all hip-hop and R&amp;B.;  By comparison, rock is middle-aged.  It has lost its
    youthful swagger and instead acquired the sheepish vanity that comes with expanding waistlines and thinning
    hair.  Perhaps it was inevitable, but if a mid-life crisis is in the cards, I can't think of a more
    entertaining one than The Darkness.</p></div>"|2524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2524-permission-to-land/|8.4|Scott Plagenhoef

    outside my window suddenly began to barrel and cry as it passed through. As if in sympathy, so did my stereo, as the disc
    began to echo this outside sound with its own glissando of trains pulling through washes of keyboards and pedal steel,
    while somewhere in the miasma Elvis mumbled through the floorboards. It was then I realized not only the power of ambient
    music, but what it meant to make a music that could adapt to any and all sounds outside itself, something amoebic that could
    also swallow everything else.</p><p>
    
    So when the coughs of my living room guest started to synch up with the fifth track of the first full-length from Swede Anders
    Ilar, I knew he must have been down with that early nineties school of thought, making his heavily-delayed electronics
    into something like a clear, deep golden broth that could hold all sorts of other sounds in suspension. A track like
    ""Rare Islands"" shows this connection to the decade previous, as Ilar lifts some of Aphex Twin's early wind chimes, and you can
    hear them mellifluously clang as he steals away ever so slowly. ""Coastline"" crackles to life with symphonic swells of bass, the
    crisp drums disappearing in rolling waves before coming back up to the surface. A lone strand of piano
    sustains throughout, vibrating beneath the radio static that surrounds it, keeping it afloat. ""Make Believe"" builds slowly,
    using a simple repeating pattern that scatters dubby debris about each step. Three minutes in, we happen upon a standard house
    beat, an odd discovery amid this snowy nowhere. In the distance, picturesque, grandiose melodies ring out, far enough away to be almost
    imagined, yet drawing your attention from the yawning thumps that stretch before you.</p><p>
    
    The mistitled ""Illusion of a Summerbreeze"" instead conjures up winter and stuffy heads, combining a soft-palate tickle with
    post-nasal drip percussion as an odd wheezing hack darts through the mix. It's slightly annoying, but as the
    cold medicine goes to work over its ten minutes, its codeine sway makes operating heavy machinery (like CD players) inadvisable,
    better left to run themselves. It collides with the similarly medicated ""December Haze"", downshifting soundforms to the point of
    pure, forelobe-fogging bass rumbles.</p><p>
    
    Closer ""Everlast"" moves into the present, drawing from modern purveyors of electronic dreams like Ekkehard Ehlers or Christian
    Fennesz.  ""Everlast"" makes a non-specific acoustic sound source shimmer on repeat, as each bit is elongated past the point
    of recognition, every pop and digital tear kept intact as it loops and melts. <i>Everdom</i> isn't exceptionally personalized,
    but Anders Ilar has obviously studied some of the masters, and will hopefully come with a more distinctly chilled ambient vision
    in the near future.</p></div>"|4071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4071-everdom/|6.1|Andy Beta

    for all those who ever found themselves earning enough for one, but working for two-- sick of leaving at
    eight, returning at six, and finding the leech still asleep on the couch, sick of watching that bastard
    roommate smoke your paycheck away, sick of managers who only manage to sit on their asses; a host is only as good as his or her parasites, but the day will always
    come when it's time to serve notice.  All the bitterness, sadness, sweetness and righteous wrath engendered
    by those confrontations is given voice in Mac McCaughan's call-to-arms, unifying every good-natured,
    put-upon innocent who's ever been torn by love and hate and made to feel like dirt for having no choice
    but to turn out a friend, co-worker, or loved one.  To anyone who can sympathize,
    the cathartic indignation of ""Slack Motherfucker"" is awe-inspiring.</p><p>
    
    That's what Superchunk have always done best; all the way back to their self-titled debut, these Chapel
    Hill overlords have crafted anthems for the ages by anyone's definition, fist-pumping scream-alongs of
    the highest order.  Conventional wisdom cheekily held that every 'Chunk song sounded the same, mostly
    due to their constant barrage of inhumanly massive power riffs and McCaughan's nasal, forever-thirteen
    conviction, but as often as not, sheer enthusiasm covered for any perceived lack of musical invention.
    Since those early days, they've gradually mellowed, trading anthemic peaks for pretty, sprawling pop
    landscapes.  And from fans who just wanted to jump up and down some more (myself included), it's caused
    endless brow-furrowing and grumbling about concepts like ""maturation"" and ""developing as artists.""</p><p>
    
    I fell in love with Superchunk because of their seemingly inexhaustible adolescence, I guess, or maybe
    just McCaughan's ability to sing lines like, ""I saw a robin's egg/ And it was blue,"" like they're the keys
    to world peace (if we would only listen, <i>don't you see?!</i>).  With that in mind, though, being the
    nearly one-dimensional, if extremely devout, fan that I am, I expected this two-disc, decade-spanning
    collection of B-sides and various rarities to be a somewhat hit-or-miss affair, and mostly miss.  Sometimes
    it's great to be wrong; the bunch of homeless tracks sheltered here hold up as well as many of their best
    albums and actually thrives on the diversity that I'd once been inclined to frown upon in Superchunk's
    canon.</p><p>
    
    The dramatic grind of ""The Mine Has Been Returned to Its Original Owner"" segues into the heart-tugging
    ""A Small Definition"", in turn sulking face-first into the towering ""Dance Lessons"", and it all sails
    through a storm of emotions so easily, you don't even have time to know if you ought to be happy, sad
    or angry at the mine's former owner.  ""Never Too Young to Smoke"" is a grim procession starkly at odds
    with the hopeful longing of the acoustic version of ""Detroit Has a Skyline"" off the <i>Hyper Enough</i>
    single.  McCaughan is momentarily stunned on the quiet ""shuffle"" (band's words, according to some hilarious
    liner commentary from the members) of ""Sexy Ankles"", and when he sings, ""You swing the truth around, and
    somebody gets hurt,"" the person wounded is him.  But it's not too bad-- ""White Noise"" is back to work the
    next day, rocking as happily and easily as a 'Chunk anthem on a casual Friday.</p><p>
    
    I hesitate to say that there isn't a downside to this collection, but even the few would-be clunkers
    included here (""With Bells On"", ""Reg"") are elevated by the carnival-esque tilt-a-whirl of moods on these
    discs.  Arguably, the consistency and simplicity of Superchunk's assembly line formula, even at its worst,
    produces songs that are individually fine, just too easily overshadowed by similar but improved sound and
    structure in their better work.  The theory is readily supported by <i>Cup of Sand</i>, where no track
    sounds out of place or unexpected because of the chaotic balance struck out of necessity, by sheer virtue
    of the dozens of releases and almost as many years from which these songs are culled.  Covers of Adam Ant's
    ""Beat My Guest"" and Bowie's classic ""Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)"" forcibly crammed into Superchunk's
    one-size-fits-all style just add to the gleeful confusion.</p><p>
    
    Despite it all, two discs' worth of jangly pop and McCaughan's exuberant tenor can defeat even the most
    steadfast listener (it really is a lot to take in at once), and as mentioned, not all of these tracks bear
    out the same level of quality.  Never let it be said that Superchunk ever turned in a poor excuse for a
    castoff, though-- the least that can be said of any one of these tracks is that it's formulaic, and that
    means <i>reliable</i>, folks.  It's hard to say if the brilliantly random shifts in mood and tempo that
    work so well here could even have been preserved had <i>Cup of Sand</i> been pared-down further.  Also,
    while I'm complaining about getting too much in this collection, I'd like to bitch about pretty girls,
    the sun, and free money.  Okay, here's to shutting up.</p></div>"|7620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7620-cup-of-sand/|8.4|Eric Carr

    signals a jump forward in time for him, despite its retrofitting.  His last effort, 2002's <i>Under Cold
    Blue Stars</i>, made a flailing attempt to paste together the story of a Midwestern couple's liaisons,
    circa 1950s, within the context of his straightforward, warm-blooded pop and permissive sensibilities.
    His latest is twice as cohesive and markedly easier on the intake.  Despite a few aberrant wince-worthy
    moments, which I'll generously chalk up as acceptable losses given that he's chosen throwback 70s strains
    as this album's vehicle of assault, <i>1972</i> finds Rouse winding a tight ball of earnest, insouciant
    pop balladry.  It just may be the most obvious-- even contemporarily fatuous-- listen I've encountered all
    year. But you know what: It works.</p><p>
    
    Rouse starts off in his lowest key with the title track.  Most akin to his early, late-90s material, the
    song tosses off a dreamy narrative of utopian imperfection about life in its titular year: marooned,
    unemployed, getting high, and shooting pool.  Comfortably sprinkled with subtle percussion and light
    strings, it's the most acoustic-based track on the record-- and though it might be aimed at a generation
    three or four removed from his own, it speaks in timeless divulgence.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the album is more exploratory, but also more compartmentalized within each of its sonic domains.
    The single, ""Love Vibration"", bounces a nostalgic eight-track beat with some synth work and light horn
    arrangements before giving way to a sax solo (!).  Which speaks to one of the record's best traits; In
    each song, 70s-tinged red flags (flute solos, vibraphones, background singers, disco string loops, etc)
    find a place to settle in, but Rouse minimizes any potential damage by using them sparingly, squeezing
    highly effective hints of earnestness and atmosphere from them before sending them hurtling back into
    whatever vintage hellhole spat them out.</p><p>
    
    ""Slaveship"" might be vintage Jackson Browne on his birthday,
    with sparkling piano and handclaps; the shoreline tango ""Flight Attendant"" fits somewhere between
    <i>Summerteeth</i>'s ""How to Fight Loneliness"" and something from former Rouse collaborators Lambchop;
    and ""Sparrows Over Birmingham"" employs a gospel choir to fill out its period soft soul swing.  ""James"",
    meanwhile, is a veritable lost 70s soft-rock relic, and one of the only tracks to showcase Rouse's mercurial
    falsetto.  Although not utilized to its fullest here, his voice transforms to fill the needs of the song,
    showing that, while sometimes the least compelling aspect of his songs, it can be made the centerpiece
    when necessary.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, Rouse takes it easy throughout the album, finding fortune mostly in his simple reel-to-reel
    personal sketches, though he does occasionally cause facial contortions when traversing groovier territory
    and crooning gory, anachronistic lyrics like, ""I wanna be your baby daddy.""  He ends the album on a fine
    note, though, with the symphonic ""Rise"", calling to mind early Damien Jurado (if he could sing) and some
    of the Pernice Brothers' more lightly conceptualized moments.  All told, it may be the best set of songs
    Rouse has yet to offer; I'd be curious to hear his take on my 1980s.</p></div>"|6842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6842-1972/|7.0|William Morris

I remember clearly the first time I
    listened to <i>Thought for Food</i>.  I was sitting on the sidewalk in front of my local laundromat, two
    loads in the washers, enjoying the shade underneath the green awning that hangs over the glass façade.
    Tucked into my shoulder bag I had a clutch of promo CDs that I dug out of my mailbox on the way over.
    My usual routine is to click through a track or two of each to get a sense of which records I want to
    listen to completely.  After breezing through and discarding several records I've now forgotten, I snapped
    <i>Thought for Food</i> into the discman and listened straight through.</p><p>
    It was different-- that was clear right away-- but it was an easy listen.  I put down whatever I was reading,
    settled into my plastic patio chair, and squinted through the sunlight at the Greek restaurant across the
    street, concentrating on what was coming through my headphones: the familiar sound of guitar and violin cut
    up and mixed with vocal samples. <i>Thought for Food</i> was easy to love but I realized that I'd have
    trouble describing what made it interesting.  It was too simple, too subtle; there was too much space.</p><p>
    Now comes <i>The Lemon of Pink</i>.  Having listened to The Books' debut god knows how many times since
    last summer and thoroughly absorbed its sound, the element of surprise has gone.  In fact, the first time
    I heard the six-minute title suite that opens this album it seemed eerily familiar.  In the first minute
    there's a repeating two-chord piano riff sourced from scratchy vinyl, a banjo, a collage of violin fragments,
    and a sample of a heavily accented woman intoning the nonsense phrase that gives the record its name.  But
    then comes a surprise: naked, unprocessed vocals by a woman named Anne Doerner, far too modern sounding to
    be pulled from an old record.</p><p>
    Indeed, the most apparent difference between <i>The Lemon of Pink</i> and <i>Thought for Food</i> is this
    record's greater use of original vocals.  The Books obviously have a lot of old records lying around, so
    it makes sense to insert a bit of structure into their finely wrought collages.  Some of the vocals find
    their way into tracks that are essentially proper songs, others are cut and pasted into glitched-up melodic
    configurations.  Doerner's contribution to the title track is one of the best examples of the former.  Her
    cracked, bluesy purr fits well with The Books' solid American roots core, and the melody is spare and
    understated, wisely remaining one of many elements rather than becoming the prime focus of the song.
    There's so much breathing room here, and her voice fills it perfectly.</p><p>
    Books co-founder Nick Zammuto sings on several of the other tracks that play with song structure.  ""Don't
    Even Sing About It"" is unusually dark and downcast, almost like an old Will Oldham dirge given The Books
    treatment, with unpredictable vocal samples cutting through the marching guitar plucking.  ""Get used
    to hanging if you hang long enough"" is the sum total of the original lyrics, but it's the sort of cryptic
    splinter that suits this essentially fragmented music.  ""The Future, Wouldn't That Be Nice?"" begins in
    typical Books fashion, with quick surges of crowd noise, vibraphone, guitar and bits of violin, but then
    the voice comes in, a flat sing-speak intoning Isaac Brockisms like ""the mind has a mind of its own.""
    I'm a little iffy on these two; where <i>Thought for Food</i>'s ""All Our Base Are Belong to Them"" was
    weird and otherworldly, these vocal tracks fit neatly into the experimental indie rock landscape.  Both
    are solid, but somehow the presence of this voice makes The Books sound just a little less special.</p><p>
    Contrast these more song-oriented bits with the sampled voice (I think it's Doerner's again) run through
    the shredder on ""There Is No There"".  The various instruments and samples fold in and then start to swirl
    into an aural kaleidoscope, and then the vocals flutter past, too quick and broken for rational comprehension
    but emotionally clear as glass.  You don't know <em>what</em> they're saying, but the feeling is immediate
    and intense.  The power of ""There Is No There"" makes me think that at this point The Books still work best
    as collage artists, assembling odds and ends into new and affecting compositions.</p><p>
<i>The Lemon of Pink</i> makes for an interesting contrast with <i>Thought for Food</i>, in part because
    the two records have so much in common.  Several of this record's tracks that closely follow the <i>Thought
    for Food</i> template are even better than their forbears, with more dynamic range and a greater sense of
    development.  The way the sample of a flight attendant from a Japanese airline forms the centerpiece of
    ""Tokyo"" is absolutely perfect, matching the editing brilliance of <i>Thought for Food</i>'s ""Aleatoric"",
    and ""Take Time"" is one of the more epic 3\xBD-minute instrumentals you'll come across, building from quiet,
    simple samples into a joyous cluster of words and acoustic sound.  <i>The Lemon of Pink</i> may sound a
    bit like this duo's debut, but it also sounds like nobody else.  The Books remain more or less a genre
    of one.</p></div>"|855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/855-the-lemon-of-pink/|8.4|Mark Richardson

    Days</i> and Cannibal Ox's <i>The Cold Vein</i>, Def Jux's C-Rayz Walz is, with his second release, only
    now entering the development stages of becoming an independent persona.  Far from your average punchline
    pugilist, he connects his slurry, erratic delivery with a voice like Pharoahe Monch meeting RZA in a
    darkened alley, and bases his song structures on metaphors, idioms and elaboration on his lifestyle.
    All of this creates a sound that seems curiously out of place on Def Jux, but could easily be confused
    with the traditional New York influences C-Rayz grew up listening to.</p><p>
    
    Despite Walz's technically proficiency, though, one issue you'll realize early on is the lack of variety
    inherent on this record. When C-Rayz isn't simply hitting the listener with a barrage of clever insults,
    he's either reminiscing about hip-hop's golden age, talking about his family, or discussing his distaste
    for the current state of commercial hip-hop.  Granted, he tackles these concepts quite handedly, but his
    lack of concern with a diverse array of topics is less than intriguing for the potential listener.
    And regardless of his anti-platinum rhyme campaign, <i>Ravipops</i> still seems to come off like a
    well-written commercial hustler album without the production values.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to the other major problem with <i>Ravipops</i>: Walz's choice of instrumental backdrops.
    The production is so incredibly fractured across the album that, if these tracks weren't all one disc,
    you might never realize they were intended as pieces of a greater whole.  There's a couple DJ Premier
    knockoffs, some guitar melodies, and some RZA-esque cuts, all of which work pretty well with C-Rayz's
    style; unfortunately, ""Battle Me"" sounds like a walk through a synthetic renaissance fair and ""The Essence""
    is a weak faux-jiggy organ waltz.  Worst of all, though, is ""Guns and Butter"" which rides an absolutely
    fucking pointless bassline that shifts north and south randomly, seemingly fighting the drumkit in a
    manner that makes it sound completely unsuitable for rapping, let alone listening.</p><p>
    
    Luckily, the album does have its highlights, most notably the aptly titled ""The Lineup"", which ropes in a
    mindblowing collection of underground artists. Incorporating Wordsworth, J-Treds and Vast Aire, among
    others, the rappers ride a light piano roll, clean bass and repeated female vocal samples with tales of
    childhood adventures. The standouts are the distinctive Breezly Bruin, who states that ""all crazed, I'm
    all day, get all A's in Ho's Economics,"" and the untouchable MF Doom, who secures a job as a school
    custodian and makes it known that he's ""not your man or your home team mascot.""</p><p>
    
    Of course, for as many problems as I have with <i>Ravipops</i>, Walz shows incredible promise.  If he can
    press himself to branch out topically and get some solid production to back him (Rjd2, where the fuck?),
    C-Rayz could easily spring to the fore of Def Jux's second wave.  But as long as he's pushing these
    mediocre beats, weak hooks, and repeatedly rehashing the same shit lyrically, he remains just another
    young up-and-comer on a label that, despite its unparalleled success, still boils over with unrealized
    potential.</p></div>"|8788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8788-ravipops-the-substance/|6.8|Rollie Pemberton

    indie pop ensemble-- or, if you're feeling charitable, an indie pop ensemble with unusually delicate
    arrangements and impressive longevity.  But the band's careful mastery of pop precision and 60s bubblegum
    swells demands a far more thorough assessment (even if it winds up leading to an inevitable
    Neil-Diamond-by-way-of-Crooked-Fingers comparison).  Since their 1996 debut, <i>Marlborough Farms</i>,
    The Ladybug Transistor have wed lush, rolling melodies to oddly somber lyrics, folding in a barnyard
    full of sounds (baritone harmonica, keyboards, flute, organs, flitting chamber-pop strings, horns,
    12-string guitar, and the soft, sliding background vocals of keyboardist Sasha Bell) and crafting a
    perfectly orchestrated whole.</p><p>
    
    Frontman Gary Olsen's voice-- a deep, steady warble as smooth as wet, worn pebbles, and just as cold and
    gray-- is so expertly controlled that it often borders on unnerving.  But he'll switch gears unexpectedly,
    too, as easily forcing out a jolly, disembodied coo, taunting and sinister, the perfect, chuckling counterpoint
    to whatever shit in your universe is currently falling apart.  Like the Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt,
    Olsen's lauded for his songwriting prowess more often than his creepy pipes, but the remnants of both are
    guaranteed to stick around long after the record has been shelved.</p><p>
    
    It might seem odd that The Ladybug Transistor waited until their unceremonious fifth studio album to go all
    eponymous, but it's an appropriate concession given the circumstances: <i>The Ladybug Transistor</i>,
    recorded in Tucson last spring with producer Craig Schumacher (Calexico, Neko Case), is the band's first
    album not recorded at Olsen's Brooklyn-based Malborough Farms studio.  The relocation, however, hasn't
    had much of an impact on their sound: their influences (see: The Left Banke, The Smiths) and their
    collaborative spirit remain at the fore, with noteworthy contributions from Calexico's Paul Niehaus
    (on pedal steel) and Lambchop's Dennis Cronin (trumpet).</p><p>
    
    Opener ""These Days in Flames"" pits a textured, upbeat piano and guitar melody against some unpredictably
    explicit laments: ""Every time it rains/ I'm running to my window/ To stare out at the same thing/ And cry.""
    ""3 = Wild"" is a bit more forthcoming with its melancholy-- its slow, meandering vocal melody (""Joked
    about the burns on your neck/ Laughed, our bodies in smoke"") drift in and out of pedal steel whines and
    shivering tambourines.  Much like Olsen's vocals, the instrumentation here is always impeccably rendered,
    each shift meticulously planned, every component expertly placed, each note purred in pitch-perfect harmony.</p><p>
    
    Consequently, The Ladybug Transistor might initially seem disarmingly untouchable here, their unfaltering
    movements too tweaked and controlled to ever be entirely accessible to folks in plain clothes.  But there's
    an undercurrent of darkness on this record-- particularly in Olsen's on-the-verge voice and lyrics-- that
    ultimately prevents the band from ever wheeling too far out of reach.</p></div>"|4629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4629-ladybug-transistor/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

    Brent D gets his cheers and jeers from the leering public, but for my money, he contributed one of the best
    reviews this site's ever seen.  It's not just that he found a way to out-pomo Stereolab and Jim O'Rourke,
    but that he did it in such a way that didn't necessarily insult anyone involved-- including fans of the
    record.  How should I know?  Because I was one of the few who actually liked <i>Cobra &amp; Phases</i>,
    despite its flat, obviously derivative easy-listening sounds, krautrock medleys and horns cribbed
    from ""Playboy After Dark"".  DiCrescenzo hit on all that stuff, but not below the belt.  I loved the
    Groop, but also recognized how completely relevant his points were.  Result: conundrum.</p><p>
    
    The thing about latter-day 'Lab that many detractors fail to realize is that this period, rather than
    everything they did prior to <i>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</i>, is ""their sound.""  Look at the progression
    of records from <i>Peng!</i> through <i>ETK</i>, and then notice the trend ever since.  As the band worked
    through their infatuations with smooth-yet-experimental sounds, awkward cool, and turning French into an
    actual rock 'n' roll tongue, it only seems right that they would settle down with a uniform approach.
    <i>Cobra &amp; Phases</i>, the <i>First of the Microbe Hunters</i> mini-LP, and 2001's underrated <i>Sound-Dust</i>
    might not have been the bloated, lazy lounge malingerers everyone makes them out to be.  Well, okay,
    <i>Microbe Hunters</i> wasn't that great and <i>Cobra</i> could've benefited from trimming 20 minutes
    of fat-- BUT: I still contend these are not nadirs, but apexes of Stereolab's development.  Brent called
    it ""stultifying""; of course, there's no accounting for taste.</p><p>
    
    So it's all the more dreadful to face the facts that have sprung up over the course of their past few
    albums, the most obvious of which is: even if you corner the market on cocktail space jazz, it doesn't
    <i>necessarily</i> mean anyone's going to give a shit for more than a couple of records.  Granted,
    Stereolab have a knack for making their extremely minimal song components feel greater than the sum
    of their parts, but that also means that they're always running the risk of crossing over into the
    indistinct.  Until now, they've generally avoided that, but <i>Instant 0 in the Universe</i> (Acid Mothers,
    they snagged your stash!) manages to ignore the essential art-rock flourishes of <i>Sound-Dust</i>, and
    in fact, has done away with anything even remotely interesting or new: these songs sound plucked straight
    from cutting room floor.  Which still doesn't make it terrible-- Stereolab, at this point in their career,
    hardly seem capable of producing any truly, offensively awful material-- but in a way, it's worse:
    <i>Instant 0</i> leaves about as much of an impression as its title indicates.</p><p>
    
    ""...Sudden Stars"" begins with a quaint Farfisa/guitar counterpoint and Laetitia Sadier's ever-distinct
    alto.  Her vocals have always been one of my favorite sounds in new rock, and it's sad to think that Mary
    Hansen's won't be there to add another layer of sophistication and complexity.  Nevertheless, the band's
    vision has survived: this is Stereolab to a tee.  Unfortunately, the familiar overwhelms-- right down
    to the propulsive drumming at the front of the mix and yet another chord progression descended from Yes'
    ""Starship Trooper"" (don't fight it)-- and even the most sympathetic ears may not be able to maintain
    interest for the song's whole duration.  ""Jaunty Monty and the Bubbles of Silence"", meanwhile, is a
    sprightly piece of... well, hell, I don't really need to say anything about it, do I?  You <i>know</i>
    what it sounds like!</p><p>
    
    All of this said, it isn't the similarities between these songs and so many others that disappoints, but
    that these seem so uninspired.  I love the idea of splicing motorik and Gainsbourg in ""Microclimate"", but
    Sadier's lilting vocal melody in the waltz section sounds maybe a bit <i>too</i> lilting, like she meant
    to just go back to bed.  Even their backing tracks, generally some of the most reliable in the biz, suffer
    from such a lack of color and energy that they could easily pass for demos.  Some might take that to mean
    <i>Instant 0</i> is a ""stripped down"" affair, that the band has simply returned to their roots.  Sadly,
    it really does just seem flat to me.</p><p>
    
    The worst part about this is that I'm wasting my chance to pump up the maligned Stereolab records on a
    not-necessarily-thrilling EP.  I don't know if the band will ever release a great record again, and
    truthfully, I don't much care.  They've given the indie kids and the record collector geeks theirs,
    and still put on a pretty tight live show; nothing much to prove these days.  Still, one can always hope
    for another retro-futuristic hurrah.  <i>Instant 0</i> is not that last exultation, but I'll assume it
    isn't final in any respect.</p></div>"|7501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7501-instant-0-in-the-universe-ep/|5.0|Dominique Leone

A lot of people are also wrong.  First, let's define     the term:</p>
<p><i>Vincebus Eruptum</i> (v.): to completely dispense with traditionally composed blues song by frantically     bending every string on a guitar, strumming without playing any actual notes, ramming your head against     the speakers, and generally inducing a psychotic thunderstorm of sound and fury signifying nothing.</p>
<p>There's only one reason anyone has ever been interested in <i>Eruptum</i>ing: Leigh Stephens.  In the     summer of 1967, Stephens heard the accumulations of blues and rock inside his head, and formed Blue     Cheer, situating himself between Cream's rhythmic tightness and Hendrix's flamboyant excess.  Fortunately     for us, Stephens was resolutely less experienced than either, and in the process of developing this     incompetence, he inadvertently birthed punk, heavy metal, and the most primal version of the inexorable     and inept guitar freak-out.  <i>Vincebus</i> essentially acts as the juncture of the lethally lethargic,     basement-murder morass of Sabbath and the vomit-spewing anxiety of early punk rock. There may be     occasional blues passages, but trust me, there's no overlap. When Stephens solos, there is nothing but     wind-howling terror.</p>
<p>Blue Cheer's signature song, ""Summertime Blues"", is a prime example of this bludgeoning.  The band makes     several attempts to get their instruments to sound like they're playing together, but whenever singer/bassist Dickie     Peterson and drummer Paul Whaley accidentally forget that they're in the same band, Stephens rushes into     the mix with a mind-expanding psychedelic gundown. Eddie Cochran's version actually sounded like summer;     this sounds like whatever kind of season they have in a coal mine with skeleton scaffolds. The production     is so lo-fi, it's practically transcendent.

<p>On ""Doctor Please"", a sort of less subtle ""Doctor Robert"", Peterson yelps, ""I need your pain killers!""     while Stephens unleashes undulations of deafening wreckage and turbulent reverb. The rhythm section is     barely audible, and when it is, it can barely stay ahead of Stephens.  This is the kind of music Lester     Bangs must have loved and Spinal Tap and Tenacious D must have mocked: musicians who, like the bands on     <i>Nuggets</i>, live not to perfect their technique, but to simply rock.  And while Blue Cheer, at this     early stage, have yet to work out their kinks, their songs are already stunning: ""Out of Focus"" croaks     tales of ""the magic madness"" and ""mystic dream,"" a prepubescent version of Zeppelin's bombast, while     ""Second Time Around"" is a grimier and more explosive predecessor to Yes' ""Heart of the Sunrise"".</p>
<p>Only eight months later, on <i>Outsideinside</i>, the songs not only contained Stephens' paroxysms, but     proved some of the best the 60s ever produced.  The opening track, ""Feathers from Your Tree"", begins with     a drowsy hush before escalating to a strikingly driving pop song, complete with tortured teenage vocals     and backup singers. When I first listened to it, I had no idea Blue Cheer had written it. Then I realized     the entire middle third is a direct duplication of ""Pinball Wizard""-- or at least that's what I thought     before I found out <i>Tommy</i> didn't come out till the next year.  The Who ripped these guys off! Of     course, once these acid queens get soloing, it's more like ""Speedball Wizard"" anyway: ""Sun Cycle"" is     a slow rotating blues that reigns in fuzzed and tangled guitars. The version of Booker T.'s ""The Hunter""     begins as a bluesy hobble until strains of piercing guitar raze through the dinginess. ""Just a Little     Bit"" and ""Come and Get It"" slow down the tempo and create the tense interaction between players that was     sorely absent on <i>Vincebus</i>. The result is vastly more atmospheric and fulfilling, if not quite as     stunningly anarchic. The one exception is the cover of ""Satisfaction"", perhaps the most exemplary version     ever recorded, focused less on the music than the energy. It's as if Stephens is torturing the original.</p>
<p>I didn't notice any remastering on any of the tracks on this two-for-one reissue, and if you already have     both, there's no reason to seek this out.  Putting both albums side by side, however, does contrast the     two sides of the band. <i>Vincebus</i> is all catharsis and psychedelic mayhem; <i>Outsideinside</i> converts their stylistic enthusiasm and leathery attitude into structured song.  If it doesn't sound as     influential as <i>Vincebus</i>'s cataclysmic insanity, it's because it defines ""classic"" rock.

A lot of people are also wrong.  First, let's define     the term:</p>
<p><i>Vincebus Eruptum</i> (v.): to completely dispense with traditionally composed blues song by frantically     bending every string on a guitar, strumming without playing any actual notes, ramming your head against     the speakers, and generally inducing a psychotic thunderstorm of sound and fury signifying nothing.</p>
<p>There's only one reason anyone has ever been interested in <i>Eruptum</i>ing: Leigh Stephens.  In the     summer of 1967, Stephens heard the accumulations of blues and rock inside his head, and formed Blue     Cheer, situating himself between Cream's rhythmic tightness and Hendrix's flamboyant excess.  Fortunately     for us, Stephens was resolutely less experienced than either, and in the process of developing this     incompetence, he inadvertently birthed punk, heavy metal, and the most primal version of the inexorable     and inept guitar freak-out.  <i>Vincebus</i> essentially acts as the juncture of the lethally lethargic,     basement-murder morass of Sabbath and the vomit-spewing anxiety of early punk rock. There may be     occasional blues passages, but trust me, there's no overlap. When Stephens solos, there is nothing but     wind-howling terror.</p>
<p>Blue Cheer's signature song, ""Summertime Blues"", is a prime example of this bludgeoning.  The band makes     several attempts to get their instruments to sound like they're playing together, but whenever singer/bassist Dickie     Peterson and drummer Paul Whaley accidentally forget that they're in the same band, Stephens rushes into     the mix with a mind-expanding psychedelic gundown. Eddie Cochran's version actually sounded like summer;     this sounds like whatever kind of season they have in a coal mine with skeleton scaffolds. The production     is so lo-fi, it's practically transcendent. Whereas psychedelic used to be all about the Grateful Dead and     Strawberry Alarm Clock (maybe ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" on a good day), Stephens was one of the progenitors     of those gloriously nauseating spaz-outs we now know was to be the future of rock.</p>
<p>On ""Doctor Please"", a sort of less subtle ""Doctor Robert"", Peterson yelps, ""I need your pain killers!""     while Stephens unleashes undulations of deafening wreckage and turbulent reverb. The rhythm section is     barely audible, and when it is, it can barely stay ahead of Stephens.  This is the kind of music Lester     Bangs must have loved and Spinal Tap and Tenacious D must have mocked: musicians who, like the bands on     <i>Nuggets</i>, live not to perfect their technique, but to simply rock.  And while Blue Cheer, at this     early stage, have yet to work out their kinks, their songs are already stunning: ""Out of Focus"" croaks     tales of ""the magic madness"" and ""mystic dream,"" a prepubescent version of Zeppelin's bombast, while     ""Second Time Around"" is a grimier and more explosive predecessor to Yes' ""Heart of the Sunrise"".</p>

    Ryan before first date to Olive Garden and The Rundown (9:50).]</p><p>
    
    I. INTRO -- (first decision: clever metaphor <u>or</u> witty personal narrative??)</p><p>
    
    A. (used to be one of favorite bands / accordingly: personal stuff has more depth/heart)<br/>
    start-shame on band, damn this record. makes me feel old and wise-- uh, but, yeah, am older (a little,
    SAA was only '99 (98?) in any case-- can say I had it right when it came out-- would give me more leeway
    (Ich bin expert)-- but, seriosuly <i>not</i> wiser-- shouldn't be made to feel wiser. Trans. decidedly makes
    me feel wise (see Roget's for new/better word for 'wise'), like i'm all of a sudden worldly and all-aware.
    Makes me feel like fucking Kerouac or something.  --used to pause the songs when playing for friends and
    read from the lyric book, made me feel so callow and sheltered and myopic and like I had so much more to
    see and learn w/ ""your wedding figurines: I'd melt so I could drink them in,"" and ""gravitated toward a
    taste for foreign film and modern plays,"" (find better lyrics) there was nuance and the possibility of
    discovery and growth and suggestive prowess even in the face of experience. It was so forward-looking/thinking
    but had already seen so much.-- with this album: the mystique is gone, these songs are heads turned back
    over shoulders in commentary and nostalgia: but the scenes are already diluted with age and the pictures
    aren't as sharp-- nowhere left to go, just idling.  Lyrical extension: Opening lines of cd: ""so this is
    the new year / and I don't feel any different.""  (further (farther?)develop later)</p><p>
    
    B.  possible INTRO 2? (<i>direct</i> metaphor route)(hell, first one got loose anyway..)<br/>
    This is the sound of a band not embarrassed to lounge around Sunday afternoons in a bathrobe and tube
    socks drinking milk from a straw.  <i>Transatlanticism</i> is ripe with indulgence and decidedly lacking in
    pretension or restraint.  (eh, bail for now)-- but does get at 'role acceptance' and complacency.</p><p>
    
    Transition in....<br/>
    ??(mention concurrent release of Super Hybrid Audio cd version, can only be heard on special player.
    avoid obvious, ""not worth buying just for this cd"" rip)<br/>
    ??(new drummer-- Jason McGerr-- Not the same energy, but DCFC more Gibbard's melodies and Walla's knobs
    anyway)</p><p>
    
    II. The songs:<br/>
    An exercise in scope: <i>Transatlanticism</i> dulls the edges of their usually acute divinations.  A towering
    mass of sound: it leans (mostly lyrically) more toward Postal Service inclinations than it does previous
    groundwork.   Case in point:<br/>
    -- sunny jingle jangle of ""Title and Registration"", a Gibbard-patented melody accompanied by clear,
    understated guitar work replete with a stop/start drum kit and ringing tones.  Will leave you singing
    about glove compartments.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere: anthems and super-produced moments of glory.<br/>
    ""The New Year"": pure arena rock. Direct and pandering. No distance between sound and receptor: play like
    they're running out of time, even sing about it, ""I wish the world was flat like the old days/ and I
    could travel just by folding the map/ no more airplanes or speed trains or freeways/ there'd be no distance
    that could hold us back.""  Used to be <i>Something <b>About</b> Airplanes</i> and coasting down the 405-- the
    journey was the reward. Now it's the destination.<br/>
    ""We Looked Like Giants""-- fully realized anthem, true rocker- 'bout sexual discovery (old-hat subject
    matter --again:  makes me feel experienced) a claustrophobic's nightmare.<br/>
    ""Expo '86"": a mini anthem that tests the waters, pulls away and then dives in headfirst before finally
    drying off to Gibbard's lonely plea.<br/>
    ""Tiny Vessels"": what could be the best moment of the album is tossed off due to lack of restraint, final
    third is mesmerizing.  Broken by an Uluru sized wall of distortion and thrashing. Worst moment- 8 min.
    of ""Transatlanticism"", akin to witnessing the reunion of high school sweethearts away for a field trip
    weekend across a 10 acre wheat field, -- builds and builds to no avail. too romanticized. too far-sighted.</p><p>
    
    Then, the old Death Cab:<br/>
    ""Lightness"", an updated ""Coney Island"".<br/>
    ""The Sound of Settling"", old mixed with new, middle <i>Photo Album</i> pop-sensibilities tuned in to the waning
    needs of maturation. But no hidden agenda (hand claps and ""bah baa/ this is the sound of settling"") talks
    about wanting to go grey-- it shows.<br/>
    finest moments: ""Passenger Seat"", bare, spacious understated beauty w/echoes of ""Lowell, MA"".<br/>
    ""Death of an Interior Decorator"", vintage stuff-- overlapping guitar tones folding in on each other and
    beautifully realized bridge. Showcases his ability to scriptwrite.<br/>
    --all together: a complete vision. A destination.</p><p>
    
    CONCLUSION: (III), <br/>
    Ends the album where the <i>Stability</i> EP left off, w/ ""A Lack of Color""-- a low-key ziplock on the
    freshest meal.  Record IS a meal, with all courses well thought out. Ingredients may be obvious-- final
    taste and chef's vision remain a family secret. Just have to taste for yourself.  Same cook-- bigger batch
    of sound.<br/>
    My comfort-- nothing affected.  Just sincere and honest. Can't disguise who you are-- or who you've become.
    And can't really complain-- not really. Just accept, Band already has.</p></div>"|2232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2232-transatlanticism/|6.4|William Morris

For the Wu-Tang Clan and Michael Jackson, it     led to exponential career declines.  For Biggie and Tupac, it led to grisly deaths.  Jay-Z has chosen his     own route: <i>The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; The Curse</i> lobbies for a position on top of the commercial     hip-hop market.  On his mid-to-late 90s <i>Volume</i> trilogy, Jay had steadily lost track of his confident     street corner philosophy, but a series of battles led him to re-evaluate his career, resulting in the     landmark album of his career: the prequel to this two-disc blowout was an inarguable masterwork of beautiful     soul-struck production and serrated bling 'n' sting street rhymes sharp enough to eclipse even the heralded,     barbs on 1996's world-memorized classic <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>.</p>
<p>There's no deep concept or surrounding purpose behind this record: it's just pure confidence.  Jay weaves     his way through every imaginable style and flavor with unyielding expertise-- from the natural repetition     of ""A Dream"" to the extreme assonance of ""The Bounce"" to the classic cocky confidence of ""2 Many Hoes""--     driving home clear evidence that his top-tier emcee ranking is deserved, and that few could be as entitled.     He's straight showing off on ""Hovi Baby"": somehow flowing effortlessly over Just Blaze's ridiculous 5/4     future-cop production, Jay's lyrics sound as if they were made on the will of God, with himself as the     conduit and his voice as the fluid, talking about ""chasin' the hi-hat all over the track"" to the point     that ""the snare is scared of the air in here.""</p>
<p>Equally thrilling is the varied subject matter Hova touches on.  Whether he's engaged in lucid conversation     with Biggie (""A Dream""), contemplating the nature of his maturation in regards to relationships (""Excuse Me     Miss"", ""Fuck All Nite""), his ever-present public issues (""I Did It My Way"", ""Diamond is Forever"") or discussing     the nature of his upbringing (""Some How Some Way""), even Jay's most exhausted subjects sound invigoratingly     fresh.  A powerful testament to Shawn Carter's underrated storytelling abilities, ""Meet the Parents"" unveils     a delicate tapestry of modern black archetypes and the flaws with the African-American family structure.     He begins with the family that created a thug and slowly shifts into the life that thug creates for himself     as a result of his fractured upbringing. It's a tale of death, parental absence and drug dealing that spirals     into a face-off between father and son, spun into a metaphor for the intense need for a solid patriarchal     bond.</p>
<p>As a premier rapper in the commercial spotlight, Carter's got a way of leveling his albums out with a     wide variety of beats. Ranging from the Cake-sampling guitar strum of ""Guns and Roses"" (produced by Heavy     D?!!) to the Hugo Williams connection's dark, squirt-bass stomper ""Nigga Please"" to Kanye West's anthemic     chopped EWF sampling firestorm ""As One"", Jay attempts to please everyone and very nearly succeeds. Although     the Tupac-flavored ambient keyboard beats aren't quite as sharp as they could be, and the uncharacteristically     pedestrian Timbaland collaborations disappoint, they do offer a solid pace to the album to that virtually     all other doubles lack.</p>
<p>And pace is one of many places that <i>Blueprint 2.1</i> fails.  Released six months after <i>The Gift and     the Curse</i> as a sampling of some of the album's more seemingly intriguing tracks and chart hits, it was     a transparent ploy to bank on increased record sales and create the illusion of cost-effectivity, when, in     fact, <i>Blueprint 2.1</i> ran about the same price as the original, and offered roughly half the tracks.     It's bad enough that its two bonus tracks aren't even worth talking about, but it omits nearly half the     standouts from the original, leaving as many as eight stronger tracks out in lieu of lesser collaborations     with dollar-winning names.  <i>2.1</i> doesn't even include the song ""Blueprint 2"", effectively contradicting     its purpose.</p>
<p>So, for the classic bloated double-album prototype, the filler helps more than it hinders, as evidenced by     the spectacular failure of the condensed version.  Truly, Carter's vision of the streets <i>had</i> to     stretch out over two discs, if only to handle the spectrum of influence he's drawn from and continues to     create.  With his final set, <i>The Black Album</i>, due next month under the tutelage of The Neptunes,     Rick Rubin, Timbaland, Kanye, Lil' Jon and seven others, all eyes are on Hov, hoping for-- and rightfully     expecting-- a classic last salvo to bookend his perfect debut.  <i>The Blueprint 2</i> may be less than     filler-free, but it stands regardless as a testament to Jay-Z's mastery of the written and spoken word:     the fortifying teaser to a pay-per-view-worthy finale.</p></div>"|11764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11764-the-blueprint-2-the-gift-and-the-curse-blueprint-21/|7.5|Rollie Pemberton

    SETTING: The Lactating Orchid, an independent business establishment</p><p>
    ASH: Feminist bookstores creep me out.  I sometimes worry that I'll get an inrection.</p><p>
    REESE: Being here shouldn't unnerve you any more than I'm freaked out by Foot Locker, or Colonel Rapehawk's
    Burrito Sports Satellite Steakhouse.</p><p>
    ASH: These places brim with so many contradictions.  The clientele range from pragmatic activists to
    tarot-addled goons, so the merchandise fittingly runs the gamut from useful political analyses to
    superstitious hokum.  And why are Gillian Welch CDs always playing?</p><p>
    REESE: Be charitable, patriarch.  Welch fascinatingly embodies modern feminism's slipperiness.  She should
    be a cliché within a cliché wrapped in a cliché with a side of clichéradish sauce, especially under the
    weight of those ""Southern,"" range-roaming, country-road tropes.  But her albums are weirdly fresh and
    weirdly, er, cool.</p><p>
    ASH: Especially this new album with its occasional-- and radical, for Welch-- ""full band"" approach
    (featuring contributors to albums by rural postureminders such as Beck and Son Volt).</p><p>
    REESE: Did you just speak in a parenthetical?  Or am I inside your mind?</p><p>
    ASH: Alls I'm saying is that points on this album have much more to do with the sparse, dolorous pop of
    Aimee Mann than they do with countresses like Emmylou Harris.</p><p>
    REESE: Hey wait, Emmylou Harris covered Gillian Welch.</p><p>
    ASH: Exactly my point. Harris is known as an expert arranger, while Mann and Welch are <i>songwriters</i>,
    even though-- ahem-- they compose with male partners.  Besides, Harris covered Welch's most popular tune,
    ""Orphan Girl"", which every self-dramatizing spaghetti-strapper over-lip-syncs in her Honda Civic.</p><p>
    REESE: I <i>love</i> that song.</p><p>
    ASH: The song is, like, the hokey pokey of familial absentia.  ""I have no mother, no father, no sister, no
    brother/ I am an orphan girl""?  I'm gonna write one called ""Multiple Amputee"" that goes ""I have no arms,
    no legs...""</p><p>
    REESE: Metallica already did that.  If you weren't stupid, you'd see that ""Orphan Girl"" is a formal
    eschewing of the matriarchal burdens associated with rural womanhood, just as the speaker on this album's
    ""Wrecking Ball"" appropriates the ""rolling stone"" stance usually romanticized by men.  You know, I can't
    help but notice that your own Southern-tropist swoon-tune gets covered here: wasn't ""I Had a Real Good
    Mother and Father"" popularized by Bonnie ""Prince"" Oldham back in his days as a Palace sibling?</p><p>
    ASH: What a tune. [ASH blushes and fingers his lip.] While we're dishing out penis-points, let's give some
    credit to the sweetly rendered song associated with Mississippi John Hurt, ""Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor"".
    Also note that the arrangement owes a dollar or two to the first disc of Dylan's ""bootleg"" threefer.
    Meanwhile, your precious ""Wrecking Ball"" is just an outtake from Jason Molina's <i>Magnolia Electric
    Co.</i> with fiddle overdubs.</p><p>
    REESE: Hmph.  I see what you mean about the crossroads of seriousness and blarney, though.  How can an
    album so reticent and measured bear a moniker as new-agey as <i>Soul Journey</i>?  That reeks of Shirley
    MacLaine and that star-chart-fondling crystal-culture.</p><p>
    ASH: A shame, because the songs are so no-nonsense, trafficking in classic idioms (riding with the ""top
    down"" is libertine, etc) and landscape metaphors (""lowlands"" and ""black highways"" mean trouble, etc).
    Except for ""One Monkey""?  What the hell?  ""One monkey don't stop the show""?</p><p>
    REESE: Is it about not being distracted from the big picture by an insulting fad, such as a Nashville
    whorelet or a dopey politico?  Is its punishing repetition purposeful, or a cave-in to Tracy Chapmanship?
    Maybe it's borrowing the language of pre-Civil Rights-era America, saying something about one uppity Negro
    not being a threat to the status quo?  That explanation would offset some of the cultural baggage that this
    ""throwback"" music totes around.</p><p>
    ASH: I don't know.  This album's most ""bluegrass"" song (""No One Knows My Name"") is just a refashioning of
    ""She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain When She Comes"".  Seems pretty harmless.</p><p>
    REESE: Hey, look, this store sells those bumper stickers that say THE BANJO IS AN AFRICAN INSTRUMENT!  Maybe
    I could include Welch in my doctoral thesis on Anglosimilitude.  It would fit with my bachelor's thesis,
    <i>King Kut: Castration Metaphors in Old-School Rap</i> and my master's thesis <i>I Am the Eighteenth Pale
    Descendant: Steven Patrick Morrissey and Whiteness as an Othering Force</i>.</p><p>
    ASH: I wish I were a turntablist. ""One Monkey"" would make a mean mash-up with Whodini's ""The Freaks Come
    Out at Night"".</p><p>
    REESE: Ugh. That kind of futurism, which debases art's factory-sealedness, is why I want to take refuge in
    pastoral works such as <i>Soul Journey</i>.  Lightning Bolt makes me feel seventy years old and addicted to
    painkillers and marathons of <i>Diagnosis: Murder</i>.</p><p>
    ASH: Fair enough. Welch is definitely the most relevant of the <i>O Brother Pluck Art Thou</i> gang of
    neo-yodelers.  And I reckon that if you find the bleats-n-beats of The Rapture soulless, then you might
    love this soft, warm, but still interestingly distant work.  Then again, <i>Soul Journey</i> remains a
    tad raptureless.</p></div>"|8623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8623-soul-journey/|7.1|William Bowers

    Voigt.  It at once legitimizes him an electronic artist-- as Voigt's Gas project is a hyper-subtle,
    quasi-ambient territory hardly traversed, let alone traversed well-- yet also relegates him to second
    fiddle: perhaps he's mentioned as a contributor to the genre, but possibly never without the connection
    to his predecessor.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there's no mistaking the similarity: both work within the context of slowly unraveling drone
    compositions with liberal flourishes of natural sound, conflating mid-range white-noise hiss with a
    heavy rhythmic pulse.  Both prefer drawn-out pieces, rarely settling for less than five minutes of
    (to over-generalize) a single looped figure, though each commands attention, be it with suddenly emergent
    melodies or the sheer hypnotic trance that skips past pop entirely. For lack of an <i>NME</i>-supplied
    genre categorization, Gas and Polmo Polpo share stock in ""orchestral noise.""</p><p>
<i>Like Hearts Swelling</i> shows Polmo Polpo in evolution from his 2002 Alien 8/Subtractif-released
    debut, <i>The Science of Breathing</i>; its updated modus operandi fits nicely with his switch to
    Montreal's Constellation label, where Perri shares poster space with similarly grandiose acts Do Make
    Say Think and A Silver Mt. Zion.  Here, delving barely nil into <i>The Science of Breathing</i>'s darker
    four-to-the-floor dominance (a progression in style that ironically draws him even closer to Gas), Perri
    now breaks through his loops with moody slide guitar.  The instrument's necessarily rustic attitude
    dramatically differentiates the album: the blankets of distrust and melancholy that beautifully asphyxiated
    his previous offering are all but completely absent; what remains is hope, unspoken at each track's silent
    beginning, burgeoning and empowering by each track's end.</p><p>
    
    ""Romeo Heart"" evokes an airplane on the runway, its cold engines spinning humbly but enough to manifest
    the cozy harmonics nestled inside the song's single-tone whirl.  Then Perri's siren-like slide guitar
    takes over controls, guiding the track through stratums after stratums of atmospheric noise. As the track
    closes, it expertly mimics the Doppler effect's drop in apparent pitch, bestowing the drone track--
    composed vertically-- with an unusually compelling forward motion.</p><p>
    
    The eleven-minute ""Requiem for a Fox"" finds Perri at his most versatile, indulging everything from typical
    drone exercises to more slide guitar overlays to, at its end, a Manitoba-like electro-acoustic psychedelia.
    There's less technical forward motion to the track, but the metamorphosis that takes place at its
    conclusion is among the album's most compelling: the echoed train-like pulse slowly gives way to a
    focused rhythmic punch as Perri treats his guitar to a delicious vibrato.  As the bass and pulse lock up
    for a tight driving finale, they cast the track in bronze as the album's clear standout.</p><p>
    
    ""Farewell"" carries over the acoustic infatuation heard at the end of ""Requiem"", but Perri slowly and
    deliberately undermines its bucolic hee-haw, subsuming its ashes into a drone of increasingly sputtering
    vibrato and the slide guitar's nightingale song.  It's only fitting that, having ended each drone so
    masterfully and completely, Perri ends the album with its title track, which summarizes the album's
    scope in instrumentation and approach, successfully incorporating accordion and proper stringed instruments
    into the album's established aesthetic as though they'd been there all along.  And so, what could have come
    off as <i>Like Heart Swelling</i>'s novelty track becomes instead its most properly integrated creation,
    a final memento of what Polmo Polpo has so carefully accomplished here: perfectly unstructured, structured
    sound.</p></div>"|6388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6388-like-hearts-swelling/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

Bamp-bam-bam, dobba-dobba-dat-da. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-dah. Oh, sorry, I didn't see you
    there. I was just trying to reach my word count as I write a review dooby-doo doot-doo of the new Erykah
    Badu disc.  Being a fan of nu-soul involves a superhuman amount of patience-- D'Angelo and Badu both
    routinely take 3+ years to drop new records-- and despite its fifty-minute length, <i>Worldwide Underground</i>
    is listed as an EP as a means of discerning it from a proper follow-up to 2000's <i>Mama Gun</i>.  Here,
    Badu scribbles-- in a nattering Fiona Apple style, no less-- ""Freakquency is born and neo-soul is dead.""
    Given that it's taken three years to drop on EP of purported idiom, does it mean even longer waits?
    This disc contains more filler and fluff than her fresh-picked fro can symbolize on the cover.</p><p>
    
    ""Bump It"" delineates the problem with time. The first half of its nine minutes is relaxed, comfy soul
    cushion, firmed by a hip-hop click and intonation of the title command.  That focus soon starts to slump
    in the seat, though, devolving into another five minutes of congas and croaked adlibs of boo-pee-doopy-doo's,
    some courtesy of Zap Mama's Marie Daulne.</p><p>
    
    Building slowly on a descending keyboard vamp and Badu's panned rhythmic coos, ""I Want You"" blossoms into
    percolating and passionate, high on smoldering lust.  But chugging holy water, picking up paperbacks, or
    toting yoga mats, nothing can quite touch that initial tingle.  Burning out like joints and crushes are
    wont to do, the vamp goes limp, lackadaisically slowing tape before punching in a... um, Lenny Kravitz
    guitar solo, which makes it easy to forget the earlier power of its eleven minutes.</p><p>
    
    Tighter tracks like ""The Grind"" and ""Love of My Life Worldwide"" ride the beats with soulful, vocal fringe
    looped ad infinitum, perfect as instrumental flips for hip-hop night at the Black Betty. Choruses of ""keep
    the glock on lock"" or ""ring-ding-dong"" and folks like Dead Prez, Queen Latifah, Angie Stone, and Bahamadia
    stepping to the mic carry that informal, if not consistently inspired, level of interplay.</p><p>
    
    Where scarcely sketched-out words and ideas have a tendency to fall into that painful <i>American Idol</i>
    vat of melismas, Badu keeps the proceedings here buoyant and relaxed with that supple-lipped scat of hers,
    stretching out scant syllables at her lounging, loopy leisure.  It's nonsensical (lacking Baduizms or
    pleas to kiss her neck), conveying instead that small, spacy joy of puffing in the back of the ride.
    Opening the music up and just letting the tape unfurl catches moments unattained otherwise, but as it
    stands, <i>Worldwide Underground</i> could use some tightening up.</p></div>"|1083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1083-worldwide-underground/|6.7|Andy Beta

In the summer, it's almost unbearably hot where I live, my rent's too high,
    and no offense family, but you're just not cutting it.  Furthermore, the Fins have the best music: in the last year I've been fortunate enough to jam
    to new records by Circle, Luomo, Varttina, Gjallarhorn, Pharaoh Overlord, Uzva and now Alamaailman Vasarat.  They say it's cold there.  They say
    people drink profusely and go for weeks without talking.  Never mind all that, I'll just stake out a Helsinki street corner somewhere, slip a
    Sibelius disc in the Walkman, and witness the magic.  I'm going to do that right now.</p><p>
    However, my love of all that Finnish music is only eclipsed by my tendency for procrastination: bringing you the details on AV's
    <i>Käärmelautakunta</i> will have to do.  This band (translated as ""The Hammers of the Underworld"") is an offshoot of the defunct avant-prog ensemble
    Höyry-Kone, who were as likely to break into Iron Maiden as they were to launch epic King Crimson-style rave-ups.  Drummer Teemu Hanninen and
    bassist-come-saxophone player Jarno Sarkula began AV as way to integrate more of an acoustic texture into their music, and the result is something of
    kick in the gut to traditional Finnish folk.  Chiefly, where their country's odd-meter dances and tart, minor-chord hymns seem like the music of a lost
    mythology, AV injects a forceful, metallic dread into the forms.  In addition to drums and sax, they feature pump organ and two cellos.  This
    instrumentation might lead you to believe they play chamber music-- and on occasion they do, though when the cellos hit the distortion pedal, things
    get heavy, heads bang and all Valhalla breaks out.</p><p>
<i>Käärmelautakunta</i> is AV's second record, and makes a great case for them being the pre-eminent proponents of the supposed
    ""ethnic brass punk"" tag they give themselves.  As far as I know, they're the only band actually playing this stuff, though in spirit at least, I can see
    valid comparisons to other European tricksters like Uz Jsme Doma or in their heavier moments, Scandinavian Black Metal.  Still, the somber beauty in
    tracks like ""Vanha Iapsuudenystäva"" makes clear these guys are no mere metal mongers.  Piano and cellos begin the slow waltz with lilted, moaning figures
    that might pass as straight gypsy funeral music.  One cello rises unto its upper register to take the melody, and when the percussion and saxophone
    enters, the tune's tragic, circus-orchestra melancholy is almost too much to take.  AV has done a little soundtrack work, and I can very easily see this
    tune during the closing credits to a movie about the death of a shoemaker who moonlit as a mime for the czar.</p><p>
    A subtle Klezmer influence works through some of the songs, such as the breakneck oompah of ""Lentävä Mato"" (or ""Flying Wyrm""), to which I dare
    anyone to attempt to dance.  The middle section is again reminiscent of some threepenny Eastern European melodrama best suited for sad clowns, but is
    quickly disintegrated by manic cymbal flares and the furious sax-led melody.   ""Vasaraaasialainen"" (""Vasar-Asian"") is at once elegant and raw, with its
    buoyant pump organ and razor-sharp cello bassline.  Sarkula's fanfare should sound familiar to anyone digging John Zorn's <i>Masada</i>, but rather than Semitic
    free jazz, the vibe here is pure Finnish ominous joy.  The band drops away in the middle for a surprisingly gentle soliloquy of organ and cello, and
    returns with a bang right back to the dance.  It's as celebratory, irresistible a moment of music as I've heard this year.</p><p>
    The harsher passages on <i>Käärmelautakunta</i>, such as the sludging menace of ""Kivitetty Saatana"" or relatively straightforward metal of ""Astiatehdas""
    (""Dish Factory"") are actually the least engaging, if only because AV doesn't get to investigate their more subtle strengths.  That said, just so you
    know, the closer ""Jää, Hyva Mieli"" will physically rip your neck from its shoulders if you get to close.  I still want to check out Finland at some
    point, if only to soak in some of the culture that produces this stuff.  Until then, AV comes very recommended.</p></div>"|95.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/95-kaarmelautakunta/|8.1|Dominique Leone

I did.  I wanted to be excited for the release of Minor Threat's first demo, recently unearthed
    after being buried alive in the dank recesses of Dischord's vault.  I listened to it at volume levels that
    made my brain beg my volume-hand for mercy.  I threw myself against the walls, broke my furniture, and got
    into fistfights with cops that I called over myself.  I got drunk and tried being ashamed to the tune of
    ""Straight Edge"", to no avail.  ""Golly, it's really hard to be excited over this semi-historic EP,"" I
    discovered.</p><p>
    
    First, before anybody gets their suspenders in a knot, I'm not implying that hardcore fans are self-destructive
    louts (just me) and I'm not demeaning a straight-edge lifestyle-- I generally prefer to stay sober so I can
    know when I'm having a good time rather than relying on the recollective ability of my associates.  By
    taking the time to explain this, do I secretly think that a lot of hardcore fans take themselves too
    seriously?  Uh... No comment.</p><p>
    
    But let me be serious about one thing, and do not let this album's silly numbers overhead fool you for
    even a second: Minor Threat may be the single most important band in the history of hardcore.  Although
    they lacked a fraction of the Bad Brains' soul-core musicianship, their riff-heavy attack was sharper,
    leaner, and at least as meaningful to the D.C. hardcore sound they helped forge; innovative enough to
    separate themselves from the heavier SoCal sound made famous, coincidentally, by their good friend Henry
    Rollins' Black Flag and scores of imitators.  And after claiming a sizeable plot of music history for
    their band before they were even old enough to drink (not that they wanted to), MacKaye and Nelson's
    Dischord label continued on to virtually pioneer D.I.Y. ethics and aesthetics raising a torch to light
    the way, in case anyone was brave enough to follow.</p><p>
    
    Again: they're maybe the most important band in hardcore-dom, and maybe it's not even a ""maybe.""  They
    took themselves seriously, too, and for good reason, but to many, Minor Threat is still shallowly
    criticized for the too-grim public demeanor sometimes cultivated by MacKaye and his old bandmates.
    So those ""jokes"" earlier?  I was just trying to break the ice; apparently, the estimable Mr. MacKaye
    has the same thing in mind, including some priceless photos from the recording sessions held in the
    playroom in Don Zientara's basement (aka Inner Ear Studios) along with the as-yet-undiscussed demo tape.
    As Fugazi's <i>Instrument</i> documentary pointed out, a band that champions meaningful ideals ought to
    treat them publicly with the gravity they deserve, but behind closed doors, they're occasionally known
    to almost smile for seconds at a time.  That, at least, hasn't changed, as these ancient photos of an
    eighteen-year old Ian MacKaye giving a trollish scowl while wearing plastic ears and Bozo the Clown's
    hairpiece or Henry Rollins bashfully modeling a makeshift adult diaper will readily document.</p><p>
    
    Whether due to simply romanticizing the past, or because of the obvious conviction behind Minor Threat's
    socio-political diatribes, it's awfully easy to forget that Minor Threat was also a group of teenagers
    having fun trying to (maybe not even naively) make a difference by doing something that mattered to them,
    and that's as awesome now as it was 22 years ago.  A few photos really help put that into perspective.
    But those photos are the best thing about this demo.</p><p>
    
    Not that the songs are at fault-- every last jagged burst of outrage against alcoholism, racism, and
    thoughtless violence just for the sake of proving nothing at all in ""Straight Edge"", ""Guilty of Being
    White"", and ""Small Man, Big Mouth"" rings with as much immediacy as it ever has.  These are the very same
    songs that have meant so much to impressionable, dissatisfied young people, inspiring them to look for
    more in the world, maybe emblazon the tell-tale X's on the backs of their hands, not just in 1981, but
    every year since.  Unfortunately, anything included here can be found on the much better and, as the name
    implies, more complete <i>Complete Discography</i>, almost to the note, which means even completists have
    little to gain.</p></div>"|5554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5554-first-demo-tape/|7.5|Eric Carr

    Danielson Famile's Sounds Familyre label), David Eugene Edwards has refined
    his revelatory vision, cramming inky atmospherics into the rusted-out gears
    of an apocalyptic music box. On <i>Blush Music</i>, this blue-eyed grandson
    of a Nazarene priest goes it alone again, serving up a meticulous fire-and-brimstone
    sermon that surpasses the work of the better known Denver-based trio he fronts,
    16 Horsepower.</p><p>
    
    Released initially as <i>Blush</i> in May 2003 on the German label Glitterhouse
    (who also release the debut before it found an American label), the album's
    ten tracks were composed by Edwards to accompany a modern dance performance
    choreographed by Wim Vandekeybus for his Belgian troupe, Ultima Vez.  More
    interestingly, though, in addition to a handful of previously unreleased
    tracks, <i>Blush Music</i> revamps and expands upon a number of backwoods
    dirges from the debut: the last record's brief cover of Bill Withers' ""Ain't
    No Sunshine"" emerges monumentally as the fourteen-minute ""Animalitos (Ain't
    No Sunshine)"", sounding like a moment from Current 93's <em>All the Pretty
    Little Horses, and including extended nonvocal passages, creepy children's
    voices, nocturnal bird sounds, bass drones, and the sharp rumble of burning wood.</em></p><p>
    
    Likewise, ""My Russia (Standing on Hands)"" and ""Your Russia (Without Hands)""--
    based on the significantly briefer ""My Russia""-- build momentum with shakers,
    simple percussion, organ wheezes, large doses of quivering feedback from a
    Gypsy caravan, and Edwards' deep bellow, a combination of Nick Cave shouts
    and Will Oldham's windswept bays. ""My Russia (Without Hands)"" is grounded by
    a heavy bassline and repeated high-pitched guitar note, and at times he sounds
    like a more literary, less soporific Black Heart Procession.</p><p>
    
    A denser take on ""Story and Pictures"" skips like a creaking pin-box coffin
    until the mess drips away for the clear sounds of a piano and Edwards' less
    gravely vocal track:  ""As a boy I drew too near/ To the love of dust."" The
    result of his patience and the compositional layering is a painful, almost
    unbelievably gorgeous madrigal: the incidental drone of Young Goodman Brown's
    midnight trek slowed to a crawl, the occult vapors seep in time-lapse to the
    most unfamiliar corners of a frightening forest.</p><p>
<i>Blush Music</i>'s new material is equally tangled in the rich soil and briar
    patches of the deep underbrush. With fiddles, mandolins, insects, accordions,
    whispers, nettles, walnut pews, and splattered green flies, ""Snake Bite"" and
    ""Another White Bird"" are epic <i>Rain Dogs</i> instrumentals tortured 'til they
    scream. Perhaps the creepiest bit on the record, ""Aeolian Harp (Under the World)""
    begins with whispers and creaking dock sounds that multiply until Edwards intones
    with a Bill Callahan lugubriousness: ""Now is the end of the gentile/ Pluck aeolian
    harp, my child/ beyond the lust of this moment/ Thin as a pine slat/ It does no
    good to call you mine."" His three-part prophecy-- a weird godless dream-quest--
    ends when language evaporates into the sounds of a southern chain gang of ghosts.</p><p>
    
    Though an avowed Christian, Edwards whittles a brutal seance, one-stepping
    to the pulpit with a Faulknerian soul-sickness that burrows beyond even Nick
    Cave's more recent Old Testament pontificating. Temporarily illuminating the
    opaque portions of a burnt-out interior, <i>Blush Music</i> is a transcendent
    call-and-response between a man and the variegated joy he's unearthed within
    the layers of his faith.</p></div>"|8760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8760-blush-music/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

    Plan were an undeniably forward-thinking band, innovative without sacrificing accessibility, and always
    looking to forge new ground.  It's possible that their tendency to continually transform themselves hastened
    their breakup, which, if you haven't been following the indie rock newswires, has been in progress for nearly
    a year now.  The band realized there was no point in repeating themselves, and once they reached the point
    where they might be in danger of it, they closed up shop, though they kept touring on their existing
    material for months after officially calling it quits last month.</p><p>
    
    As their final creative stroke, the Plan have left us with this: an album of remixes created by their
    fans (and a few by better-known colleagues).  Around this time last year, the band posted separate tracks
    for each of their songs on their official website so that anybody anywhere would be able to conveniently
    download and refashion them as they saw fit.  The band then sifted through the results and chose twelve
    of them for this final send-off, the appropriately titled <i>A People's History of The Dismemberment Plan</i>.
    It's an opportunity I think more bands should offer to their fans, as it has potential not just to yield
    interesting results, but to expose talent within their fanbases.</p><p>
    
    The only question that remains, then, is how much of this has the Plan's own remix project accomplished?
    There's not a simple answer to that, but I can say this: some of these remixes are truly excellent, and
    some of them are disastrous.  Certainly, it was inevitable that this project would yield mixed results,
    given the lack of guidelines for those involved, but it's a shame that the quality couldn't have been more
    uniformly high.</p><p>
    
    The disc, unfortunately, gets off on the wrong foot, with a strange remix of ""Face of the Earth"" by a guy
    calling himself Parae, who, according to the disc's liner notes, had never even heard the band before
    completing the track.  It's an interesting vocal cutup, but folks expecting finished results anywhere even
    remotely close to the original material will be immediately let down, and more importantly, Parae's
    rhythmic sequencing of Travis Morrison's breathing patterns and snatches of syllables wander for too
    long before he introduces his climax, a blast of frozen, sampled guitar and percussion.  That this was
    chosen for inclusion-- let alone to lead the record-- is a classic case of concept trumping execution.</p><p>
    
    There are a few fantastic reimaginings here, though.  Drop Dynasty's ""What Do You Want Me to Say?"" is
    squirmy, electro-damaged hip-hop that keeps the original's verses intact but steers way left of the
    anthemic chorus, approximating the effect instead with a backward sample of Morrison and dropping in
    choice vocal bits for rhythmic effect.  Cynyc takes one of the Plan's most openly poppy songs, ""Following
    Through"", and lays the vocals over a pumping breakbeat, shifting the vocals rhythmically so that the
    emphasis falls on different beats, completely recontextualizing the old melody.</p><p>
    
    Grandmaster Incongruous, meanwhile, executes a pretty brilliant mashup of ""Pay for the Piano"" and Elvis
    Costello's ""Pump It Up"", playing with tension by altering the intensity of his breakbeat and also wiring
    in samples of horn hits and synthesized basslines from songs I couldn't quite place.  ""Superpowers"" gets
    the mashup treatment as well, from Erik Gundel, who layers Morrison's voice and the song's quivering synth
    over the acoustic guitar from ""Ooh La La"" by The Faces (best known as the song that closes out <i>Rushmore</i>).
    It's an oddly affecting juxtaposition, and a fitting wrap-up.  But the best track on this whole deal has
    to be Quruli and Noise McCartney's tribal/aquatic take on ""A Life of Possibilities"", a hypnotic, beautiful
    drift that leaves the song's verses intact, but casts it in a whole new light.</p><p>
    
    There are, of course, as many misfires among the songs that finally made the cut-- most notably Cex's
    spastic IDM take on ""Academy Award"" (though he deserves credit for most interesting song choice).
    Virtually every other artist here takes a crack at something from either <i>Emergency &amp; I</i> or
    <i>Change</i>, and while there's plenty that's ripe for the picking on those two albums, it would have
    been fun to hear more interpretations of earlier material-- <i>The Dismemberment Plan is Terrified!</i>
    is such a wildly unique and rambunctious album it's almost inconceivable that more people wouldn't have
    tried their hand at building something new out of it.</p><p>
    
    Despite its flaws, <i>A People's History of The Dismemberment Plan</i> remains an interesting listen,
    borne of a great concept.  People who weren't interested in the Plan in the first place pretty obviously
    won't find much to love here, but it's safe to say that fans will probably be divided into two camps:
    those who'll think every last one of these remixes violates the corpse of one of their favorite bands,
    and those who'll find enough of interest in these reevaluations of the band's catalog to give it a few
    listens before filing it forever away on the record shelf.</p></div>"|2340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2340-a-peoples-history-of-the-dismemberment-plan/|6.0|Joe Tangari

The city's influence on these four indie rock expats is almost palpable: Here they are, a
    brand new band and their self-titled debut, and they've already got a logo.  See it there, on the chain--
    the shiny, streamlined Volkswagen Bug silhouette of a rabbit. Cool, huh?  It's all over everything,
    including the band's dot-net website, where you might even be able to order that smart little rabbit's
    foot trinket. (I didn't check.)</p><p>
    
    It's odd that this posturing group of Hoobastank-esque Becoming-the-Band dropouts would be led by Ken
    Andrews (late of Failure) and count Jeff Garber (Castor, National Skyline) among its members.  While
    those bands never struck as particularly humble, they did have an innate sense of indie ethics and pride.
    And even if you can't fault them for aiming for the commercial limelight after years of (undoubtedly)
    struggling to make rent, you'd think you could at least expect them not to autopilot through a full
    album's worth of incessant one-note whining.  Suffice to say, any Garber fans seeking more of the
    expansive, exploratory, unpretentious rock associated with Hum, the heralded 90s rock band from which
    he's but twice removed, will be sadly disappointed.</p><p>
    
    The band wastes no time showcasing their uninspired, formulaic, and oft-recycled sonic and lyrical
    propensities.  The opener, ""Rabbit Hole"", sets the tone for the record; radio-friendly power guitar
    with attitude and sturdy drumming molded into tight little rock songs with luminous production and
    machinelike craftsmanship.  But, technical proficiency aside, it's little more than a desperate Foo
    Fighters song.  The verisimilitude is actually striking, given Andrews' similarly angstful but disenchanted
    delivery of, ""Cause we can get high again/ We can get high, yeah/ We can just fly.""  And since Andrews
    himself has engineered for folks like B.R.M.C., Sense Field, and Pete Yorn, he's got that punchy corporate
    gloss down pat: his production is as vapid and sparkling as his music.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to the lyrics, which are platitudinally freighted in from a Los Angeles high school
    freshman's algebra notebook, replete with bourgeois drug references and fashionable apathetic musings.
    Who needs the third person?  Never YOTR.  ""I can't break out/ From this blanket of doubt/ Got me trapped
    in a maze of shadows."" ""If I'm trying to be hidden/ You still see me.../ If my whole world is crashing it
    won't matter/ I can keep it together when you are here.""  The latter lines are from ""Hold Me Up"", the
    record's requisite acoustic-with-strings moment, and break from open discourse on feeling down, getting
    picked up, not giving a fuck, and keeping it together amidst so much estrangement.  (I hope I didn't just
    inadvertently plagiarize anything from them.)  I'm still not sure which bear more of a striking resemblance
    to each other-- the songs or the band members.</p><p>
    
    Now, if you turn your brain off-- and I mean absolute suspension of conscious thought-- you might be fooled
    into thinking a few moments here genuinely rock.  Unfortunately, as soon as your attention is secured (which
    admittedly may be never), the moment is summarily lost.  After all, a gourmand in the Orient might salivate
    at the smell of roasted Dachshund, but it won't leave him any more prone to tolerance when realization hits
    home.  If you're hungry for this sort of thing, I know a great town for you.</p></div>"|8896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8896-year-of-the-rabbit/|3.0|William Morris

    well. In the UK, Dexys Midnight Runners had eight top 20 hits and, to some, their leader Kevin Rowland is
    a beloved icon. In the U.S., Dexys are essentially remembered as one-hit wonders.</p><p>
    If you're going to be remembered for a single track, you could do a lot worse than ""Come on Eileen"". From
    the instantly recognizable strings and thump tha-thump of its bassline through its manic finale, it's an
    infectious gem-- possibly the only song I've loved continuously for the past 20 years. And hidden in plain
    view beneath that familiar shell is one of the most brilliant odes to the invincibility of youth in rock
    history. Buoyed by his sexual awakening, Rowland announces an allegiance with each of his parent's youth
    culture and insists that he's ""far too young and clever"" to grow up and turn into those he sees in his
    town ""with their tired eyes sunk in smoke-dried faces/ Resigned to what their fate is."" As wonderful as
    ""Come on Eileen"" is, to say that's only part of the Dexys story is a gross understatement. <i>Let's Make
    This Precious</i>, an 18-track compilation released to coincide with Rowland's reformation of the band for
    a UK tour and to record two new tracks (both of which are included) makes a succinct argument for Dexys
    through the UK looking glass.</p><p>
    Over the course of the band's first lifetime, Dexys ran through a series of incarnations and looks. They
    started playing horn-driven soul and dressing first in proto-New Romantic lamé and then <i>Mean Streets</i>-inspired
    street gear, made Celtic- and fiddle-inflected music in dungarees and facial hair, and followed that with
    heartfelt, honest, piano-filled ballads and a Brooks Brothers/Ivy League motif. Through it all, Rowland
    retained a professional approach, an insistence on high standards that was coupled with a restless pursuit
    of individualism, a hunger for passion, elements of beauty, wit, and style, and a disdain for safe
    mediocrity and careerism.</p><p>
    Right from the Stax-like start it was a winning formula, best evidenced early on by the Northern Soul
    homage ""Geno"" and ""There, There My Dear"", an acerbic open letter to hipsterdom on which Rowland's vitriol
    overwhelms his ability to enunciate. Following the success of debut album <i>Searching for the Young Soul
    Rebels</i>, Rowland formed a muscular new version of Dexys and toured as the Project Passion Revue. That
    group never recorded a studio album but are thankfully represented here by a pair of scorching BBC
    performances (""Until I Believe in My Soul"" and ""Let's Make It Precious""), as well as the singles ""Plan B""
    and ""Show Me"" (both of which were later re-recorded in drastically different versions).</p><p>
    Over the course of Dexys final two albums-- the worldwide hit <i>Too-Rye-Ay</i> and the jarring,
    career-sinking <i>Don't Stand Me Down</i>-- Rowland engaged in courageous and sometimes painful
    self-examination with increasing lucidity and beauty. On <i>Don't Stand Me Down</i>, Rowland shifts
    between personal monologues and his expressive singing voice in an attempt to reconcile memories and
    articulate his identity. Perhaps aware of the disarming nature of honesty, Rowland repeatedly asks
    permission to speak his mind and heart (""May I be clear on this point?"" ""Can I reminisce?"" ""Let me put
    it another way"").</p><p>
    Rowland's lack of confidence was even evidenced in his waffling on his choice of song titles. Two of the
    three <i>Don't Stand Me Down</i> tracks included here underwent name changes in the time since their
    original release. The tribute to his Irish heritage once known as ""Knowledge of Beauty"" is now ""My National
    Pride"". What was once ""Listen to This"" is now ""I Love You (Listen to This)"". Rowland's failure to give that
    second song its intended title is particularly revealing because it's about the consequences of his
    inability to admit admiration for a woman. That's also a theme explored on the 12-minute opus ""This is
    What She's Like"", in which Rowland struggles to articulate the sensation and mystery of love and attraction.
    In the end, the best he can muster is letting the music do the talking.</p><p>
    With their two new tracks, Dexys manages the rare trick of picking up largely where they left off. ""My
    Life in England"" is a characteristic stroll through Rowland's childhood memories. Far better is ""Manhood"",
    so perfect and graceful a comeback that it at once threatens to make any other new songs superfluous and
    gives rise to the hope that there are yet more gems from Rowland to come. It's a confessional track on
    which Rowland admits his insecurities and dread, recounts his emotional failures, and even includes a
    call-and-response reminiscent of much of <i>Don't Stand Me Down</i>.</p><p>
    ""Manhood"" is all the more heartbreaking as it's followed here by the holding out for hope of ""Tell Me When
    My Light Turns Green"", an early Dexys soul track that illustrates Rowland's failings and fears as a young
    man and the belief that he'd grow out of disappointment and pain. ""I've seen quite a bit in my 23 years/
    I've been manic depressive/ And I've spat a few tears,"" he says, determined that he'd eventually get the
    go-ahead to find happiness.</p><p>
    The tracklist for <i>Let's Make This Precious</i>-- selected by Rowland himself-- isn't perfect, but it's
    a strong introduction. The band's covers of ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"" and
    ""Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache"" and the self-penned hit ""The Celtic Soul Brothers"" are all fine
    but are included at the expense of more unique, rewarding gems. (Most notably: ""Liars A to E"", ""Reminisce
    (Part 2)"", ""I'm Just Looking"", ""Keep It"", ""The Occasional Flicker"", and ""Dance Stance/Burn It Down"").</p><p>
    It's a minor issue in the grand scheme of both the return of Dexys and the opportunity to redress their
    relegation to the margins of pop's history books. That's fitting because Rowland has spent his career
    redressing his own past and voicing and airing his fears, yet his often confessional music doesn't
    typically afford him reconciliation with the details of his life. He rarely draws conclusions in his
    narratives and stories, demonstrating wisdom and strength often only in hindsight. Instead of clarity,
    he often bumps against continued confusion as he attempts to redraw the map of his life. Hopefully,
    this return will go a long way to redrawing the legacy of Dexys, giving people an opportunity to follow
    Rowland's lead and gain wisdom of his strength and beauty with the benefit of hindsight. He deserves to
    sing more than one song forever.</p></div>"|2522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2522-lets-make-this-precious-the-best-of-dexys-midnight-runners/|9.0|Scott Plagenhoef

    church catharsis.  And here I will give praises to the usually jazz-specific AUM Fidelity label (home to
    many William Parker projects), Lynn Abbott, Kevin Nutt, and 50 Miles of Elbow Room writer/editor Adam
    Lore for their efforts to bring to light these privately pressed singles of Southern gospel done by Fender
    Mustang-slinging preacher, The Reverend Charlie Jackson, from 1970 to 1978.</p><p>
    
    Picking up the guitar at age ten, and learning a few blues tunes, Jackson was given an ultimatum by his mother
    which turned him away from secular music and towards a career of preaching and playing for his church.
    Using donations collected from parishioners on Sunday, as well as some of his personal funds, Charlie
    Jackson performed and preached a 15-minute radio show, which in turn led him to recording sides for the
    tiny New Orleans label, Booker.</p><p>
    
    This collection's title track is true testament, formed from the simple sound of strummed strings and
    handclaps. The good Reverend belts over the din about the mighty benevolence that can never be depleted,
    and the three parishioners that clap along sound far more infinite than their ranks would hint. ""God's Got
    It""'s guitar tone lands somewhere between Sterling Morrison's late-period VU chug and the irresistible
    thrust of stomping and clapping that-- with a bit of open listening-- could easily mix into T.Rex's
    <i>Electric Warrior</i>, any sort of jangly garage thump, or even some Kompakt shuffle-step. All share
    a persuasive, percussive force that gets the body moving with ecstatic fervor, believer or no. Like all
    earthly pleasures, though, its three minute run is a bit too short.</p><p>
    
    The remaining sides follow that same raw sound pattern, of floorboard stomp, powerful yet gentle vocal
    testimony, and that ether-shimmying guitar. The sanctified, low key numbers like ""My Eternal Home"" and
    ""Lord You're So Good"" even show a glimmer of that cast-out blues. A bit of preacher hollering pushes and
    pulls the fine rural metaphor of ""Wrapped Up and Tangled Up in Jesus"". Starting out with the seemingly
    nondescript talk of fishing, every simple action of that relaxing sport turns to motions of overwhelming
    spiritual import, the preaching portion turning into a motivational musical stomp.</p><p>
    
    ""Testimony of Rev. Charlie Jackson"" is a tour de force, along the lines of Rev. Gary Davis' ""There Was a
    Time That I Went Blind"" in terms of debilitation as redemption. Detailing his first stroke (his second,
    in 2002, has left him unable to speak, although he still performs), the track goes into harrowing detail
    about how he could not speak, frequently interjecting-- along with his congregation-- a frightening
    wordless cry to the Lord that rattles the rafters. As he mentions his loss of speech, he turns to the
    guitar as an instrument of speech, voicing a vibrato-laced solo that's so intimate and spiritually
    satisfied as to be a bedside prayer by ""Pops"" Staples (or even Loren Mazzacane-Connors), an aural nimbus
    all about it.  A real hit in the soul.</p></div>"|6899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6899-gods-got-it-the-legendary-booker-and-jackson-singles/|8.0|Andy Beta

    Belle &amp; Sebastian did the near-impossible in the Internet era: They seemed to appear out of nowhere.
    Admittedly, there was also a time (recently, in fact) when I'd wished they'd have mysteriously vanished
    as well, exorcising the dark spots of their post-1998 output in order to keep their reputation-- or at
    least Stuart Murdoch's-- in respectable shape.</p><p>
    
    From their inauspicious beginnings in 1995, the collective emerged from Scotland with wistful,
    nostalgia-laden indie pop that examined sexual frustration, shiftlessness, loneliness, and isolation.
    Murdoch's songs-- often punctuated by proper and place names-- painted expressionist, detail-oriented
    worlds that, when they connected with a listener, often left an indelible, deep impression. What went
    wrong is typically chalked up to a split in songwriting duties, a practice that made their third and
    fourth albums, <i>The Boy With the Arab Strap</i> and <i>Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant</i>,
    disjointed, frustrating listens.  The band's choice to democratize, allowing a fair number of songs from
    each band member, negated the singularity of Murdoch's vision, often at the cost of his wit and charm.
    This all-inclusive measure also resulted in the band drifting toward a pastiche of too-familiar touchstones:
    60s baroque pop, Northern Soul/Motown, and folk-rock.</p><p>
    
    On their fifth proper album, <i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i>, Belle &amp; Sebastian continue their exploration
    of pastiche, diversifying their sonic palate to include 70s soft-rock, the irreverent pop of 10cc and Squeeze,
    and bubblegum.  Here, the band's once-misguided ambition is tailored and cut by famed producer (and founder
    of notorious 1980s art-pop groups The Buggles and The Art of Noise), Trevor Horn, who aids the band in making
    a complete 180-degree turn from wry, wistful folk-pop to sophisticated, tight, sometimes-complex arrangements
    with a keen attention to detail.  Horn's touch is most effective on ""Stay Loose"" and ""I'm a Cuckoo"", two
    ambitious classic AM pop gems that-- like the best of his past production work-- threaten to spill over
    into the absurd but instead remain delightfully audacious.</p><p>
    
    Ironically, with a new-found ability to rectify their once at-odds musical interests, Belle &amp; Sebastian
    have emerged as shiny happy people, becoming that of which they were always falsely accused: t*ee. That
    label was always more appropriate to the infantilism-obsessed, Sanrio-loving element in their fanbase,
    while the band itself traded in innuendo, sinisterism, anxiety, and sketches of unfulfilled childhoods.
    But here, songs such as ""Roy Walker"", ""You Don't Send Me"", and the semi-creepy <i>Godspell</i>ian ""If You
    Find Yourself Caught in Love"" are so bubblegum they could have been staples of any number of early 70s
    TV families, from the Bradys to the Osmonds to the Partridges.</p><p>
    
    That may sound dreadful but Belle &amp; Sebastian manage to do a lot of things right-- including ""You Don't
    Send Me"", whose strength lies in its effective application of aesthetic. ""Piazza, New York Catcher"" manages
    to come off like a woozy, drunken version of the Murdoch demo ""Rhoda"", and it's his most lyrically complex
    work here, reminiscent of highlights from the past couple of albums such as ""Sleep the Clock Around"",
    ""The Boy With the Arab Strap"", ""The Model"", and ""There's Too Much Love"".  Certain tracks do flirt with
    reminders of Belle &amp; Sebastian Mk I-- namely ""Lord Anthony"", finally given a proper release years after
    it was written, and ""Wrapped Up in Books""-- but these throwbacks are temporary, bones tossed to diehards
    unable to cope with the band's decision to trade their bedsit infamy for bouncy, pogo-pop.</p><p>
    
    On one hand, <i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i> ranks as one of the most delightful surprises of the year,
    although that's primarily because I'd completely given up on them.  On the other hand, it's a very flawed
    record that at its quirky worst features harmonies so brow-furringly cheery they'd be comfortable amidst
    a cruise-ship revue or one of <i>Up With People</i>'s halftime routines. It's not at all what one might
    call a ""return to form""; rather, it's a large step toward a new, more appealing direction than the band
    had otherwise been heading.  At present, they're almost a new entity entirely, which makes this the
    Belle &amp; Sebastian album for people who never really liked Belle &amp; Sebastian.</p><p>
    
    I realize that for a large portion of Belle &amp; Sebastian fans-- most of them young and American-- lots of
    elements of the band's past matter little. The myth, the shambolic performances, the radio sessions, the
    dubbed cassettes of <i>Tigermilk</i>, the band's refusal to talk to the press, releasing only non-LP
    tracks as singles, not featuring the band on its sleeves, Murdoch's place in a songwriting lineage that
    includes early Orange Juice, The Smiths, and Felt-- it's now all ancient history. If that's indicative
    to you of what's become problematic with the band, you may want to approach this album with caution. If,
    however, ""Legal Man"" is among your favorite Belle &amp; Sebastian songs, buy this immediately.</p></div>"|633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/633-dear-catastrophe-waitress/|7.5|Scott Plagenhoef

    field recordings placed within a half-improvised framework of guitar,
    cello and sundry accented glitches.  After piecing together a magnificent
    patchwork tent of bark, calico fabric, twisted vines, and fallen stars, the
    duo-- featuring ex-members of experimental folk troupe Iditarod-- sets up
    an austere camp in the enchanted psych-folk glen also inhabited by Ghost,
    Charalambides, Six Organs of Admittance, Fursaxa, and the Jewelled Antler
    Collective. In addition to Jeffrey Alexander's guitar (finger-picked and
    bowed) and Miriam Goldberg's cello (pitch-shifted and ring modulated), Black
    Forest/Black Sea incorporate hissing short-wave radio, omnichord, haunting
    vocal melodies, saxophone, rusty percussion, 8-rpm phonograph, reel-to-reel
    noise, drone, feedback, fireside crackles, and some general knob turning.</p><p>
    
    Catchier, darker, and less composed than their Iditarod forebears, Black
    Forest/Black Seas's diminutive freak-outs are surprisingly addictive.
    ""Sevastopol"", which reverences the Ukranian Black Sea fishing port, is an
    autumnal patch of creepy chamber-music woven with repetitious arpeggios,
    sturdy cello, backward loops, and the scent of a woodsy bacchanalia.  The
    heavily-plucked ""Blackbird on Gray Sky"" employs female vocals and swirling
    instrumentation to lock into its groove, a straightforward troubadour piece
    until the vocals double and crunchy percussion begins to accompany what
    sounds like a warped singing saw, bird calls, spectral voices, and shimmering
    electronics. ""Beautiful Here"", meanwhile, is more trebly and compressed, a
    muffled sonic effect like the strains of Medieval bards leaking to your eardrum
    from someone else's headphones. The lyrics capture the deceptively simple
    remembrance of a forestal epiphany: the song ends with a field recording of
    birds, breezes, trees. Here and elsewhere, Black Forest/Black Sea tweak a
    silvan melancholy; even when the players are happy, it's depressing.</p><p>
    
    Though each song is successful in its own small way, on ""Sunday Market"", the
    acid-folk finally explodes outward with a jangling astronomy. Locating the
    bedroom version of Magic Hour's transcendent density, a quick Casio beat and
    snowballing of layered sounds-- alto sax, jarring spring reverb, and
    caterwauling feedback pretending to be a pack of crows-- catapult the
    listener into quaking treetops. If every track reached these heights, this
    record would be required listening; triple the length of ""Sunday Market"" and
    godhead is not simple hyperbole. The finale, ""Lump in Throat"", neatly brings
    the vibe back down to earth; its organ drones and synthesized drum beat lay
    a foundation for end-time stargazing, intuitively capturing the fragile
    rhythms of cracked branches: place a pillow over your head, grab your
    water-damaged copy of <i>The House of The Seven Gables</i>, and await your
    next personal witch hunt.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of the modest earlier tracks and the brevity of the whole affair,
    there's plenty of beauty shot through this old-world sleepwalk. Especially
    impressive as a debut, at this point Black Forest/Black Sea offers a gorgeous
    snapshot of the free psych underground, one of the purest spaces of otherworldly
    terrain in the current musical landscape. I look forward to future incantations.</p></div>"|1081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1081-black-forestblack-sea/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

    seismically through spacious art-pop, patiently allowing bursts of pine-tar noise to emerge unannounced.
    Perhaps as the cookie-cutter hodgepodge of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs rightfully falls off the radar, more weary
    travelers will start tripping and shouting to the beautiful post-folk urban sprawl of <i>War Prayers</i>.
    Potentially excellent tour buddies for the equally ramshackle Baptist Generals, this coed trio (including
    ex-Pink &amp; Brown skins-crasher Jeff Rosenberg) has an admirable unwillingness to tidy their songscapes. The
    ad hoc pace allows their chilled, alt-country Bow Wow Wow to time-lapse bloom into a John Cale in-house
    experiment redirected by anonymous cowboy junkies obsessing over The Raincoats. Loose-hewn fragments like
    pitted stars, ""Rhumba"" and ""The Valley"" masticate into homegrown improvisations during doped-up power
    outages; the stuttering movement between the roundtable Susanne Vega folkie singalong ""Tammy Faye"" and
    the reverb in spring of ""Ne're Do Well"" are a cloudburst of black-magic pick scratching, Sabbath guitar
    accents, and vocalist Katie Eastburn's powerful lullaby of a sing/shout, shout/sing.</p><p>
    Stylistically, Eastburn acts-out as a less-fancy Björk on the wonderful ""Stagecoach"" where she manages to
    tread the line between on and off key while the factory-worker sounds her bandmates concoct rumble and hiss
    along the production line. She's also Chan Marshall's Wiccan sister moping through a slipshod buzz on ""El
    Paso"". Elsewhere, imagine an anonymous small-town jazz favorite awkwardly humming a meandering spiritual
    in a dive bar with ex-members of Pere Ubu and a drunken, bemused Richard Hell providing a strategic,
    sick-kid choir of burnouts and ill-sent bastards.</p><p>
    ""The Lord"" is a military/religious benchmark, exactly 60 seconds of bombastic celebratory pop riddled
    within horns, humming bees, and enough joyous cymbal splashes to loosen up even the most jaded of hipsters.
    It's one of many parade stoppers, a climactic grand finale in <i>Cat Power: The Musical</i>-- performed by
    nascent SpinArt stars Suddenly Tammy!-- when the young Amish woman playing a Dickensionian Chan Marshall
    unearths ultimate happiness in the self-mythologizing of her sadness during a crazed rollercoaster ride
    at nearby Hershey Park. She decides, in sotto vocco, at that very moment, to first buy some cotton candy
    and then take part in a vaguely understood, largely abstract music project she saw mentioned twenty years
    ago in a romantic pamphlet written by David Wojnarowicz.</p><p>
    As a whole, the eleven sprawling ragas on the <i>War Prayers</i> evoke high-school poetry, cool-ass
    soothsaying, dirty squats, Velvet Underground shadow puppets, and the hunger of John Fante. What's more
    important is that these really are prayers. The band's grubby tribal spirit may or may not supplant the
    sparkly succubus eyeliner dross regurgitated as porn-star-pabulum by the menagerie of Luxx regulars
    spoiling my local nightlife, but regardless the final results, Young People's contagious slow-core
    vibrancy and unwillingness to settle for an obvious post-punk narrative explodes their humble DIY into
    a wonderfully zealous act.</p></div>"|8846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8846-war-prayers/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

Brighton's British Sea
    Power consistently opt for prickly juxtapositions: they like their club stages littered with stuffed
    birds and bits of foliage, and their rock songs peppered with obtuse allusions and highbrow polemics.
    And the tension doesn't end there: BSP might sport World War I military uniforms for their notoriously
    weird live sets, but <i>The Decline of British Sea Power</i>, the band's proper full-length debut, is
    deliberately contemporary, a confident synthesis of punk, post-punk, and new-wave, the perfect fusion
    of contrived aesthetics (if you're not convinced, check the band members' curt, one-word names-- Yan,
    Hamilton, Noble, Wood-- or the fact that they periodically pipe in pre-recorded woodland sounds during
    their shows) and gut-borne energy.  Much like countrymen Clinic, the onstage gimmicks aren't intended
    to transcend the songs; rather, they comprise an equally compelling sideshow that seems, somehow, entirely
    appropriate to the music.</p><p>
<i>The Decline</i> boasts lyrical references that range from semi-accessible (""Something Wicked"" pulls
    expectedly from Macbeth) to the near-arcane (obscured nods to Russian literature, the British Empire,
    and imperialist ethics).  Majestic and blustery, <i>Decline</i>'s vaguely psychedelic goth-pop can,
    occasionally, also sway a bit little glam: Yan's cheeky self-comparisons to Liberace (""Just like
    Liberace/ I will return to haunt you with peculiar piano riffs"") and Casio name-dropping (""I'll drink
    all day and play all night/ On my Casio electric piano"") are purposefully campy, and his whisper-gone-yowl
    can be fiercely sexual, even predatory.  BSP repeatedly get swatted with overwrought comparisons to both
    Joy Division and the Pixies, but <i>The Decline</i> has a lot more ""Stardust""-era Bowie buried in it than
    anyone seems ready to admit.</p><p>
    
    The sinister and lusty ""Apologies to Insect Life"" sees Yan layering his brash, punkish wheezes (check the
    hiccuped, barely pronounced shouts of ""Yeah!"") over Noble's harried guitar riffing, hollering an
    introductory, ""Oh Fyodor, you are the most attractive man/ Oh Fyodor, you are the most attractive man
    I know.""  Presumably, it's all one big, freaky homage to Dostoyevsky (and no less ambiguous than one of
    the man's novels); what makes ""Apologies"" so intensely interesting is that it pits its super-cerebral
    strutting against straightforward, power-to-the-people punk beats.</p><p>
    
    Album opener ""Men Together Today"" is a sustained choral swell that lasts about a minute and a half--
    hauntingly resonant, ""Men"" is also almost painfully misplaced, essentially irrelevant to what follows,
    a freestanding climax denied a proper build.  Alternately, the sprawling epic ""Lately"" (which rolls on
    for nearly 14 minutes) packs in a few too many rises and collapses, shimmering on and on, a series of
    spectacular movements that never properly assemble into a cohesive (or coherent) whole.  The album's
    true apex is ""Fear of Drowning"", which begins, appropriately, with the muted whoosh of water crashing
    into shore.  Don't get too serene, though: what comes next is Yan cooing ""Jesus fucking Christ/ Oh,
    God, no"" over a whole mess of thick, wailing guitar. Wood's drums are the only thing staying consistent;
    vocals and guitars roll in and out, turbulent and jarring, a thrilling spin.</p><p>
    
    Some people are already gearing up to dismiss British Sea Power as uselessly derivative, prematurely
    rejecting the band as (yet another) batch of self-obsessed, post-post-punk wannabes wearing stupid
    outfits, a troop of hyper Echo &amp; The Bunnymen fans who spend far too much time prancing about, and
    not nearly enough time defining a sound of their own.  But BSP's performance art antics and throwback
    posturing come with a distinct set of innovations and surprises, and <i>The Decline of British Sea
    Power</i> proves that BSP have the song-power to back up their bullshit.  More than just a cheeky album
    title or bizarre live spectacle, British Sea Power can also stir up a perfectly chilling wave.</p></div>"|1079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1079-the-decline-of-british-sea-power/|7.7|Amanda Petrusich

This is what was occupying my mind: ""See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem/ I see a motherfuckin' cop, I don't dodge him."" Now, based on my limited experience with law enforcement, I've found most cops to be cordial, beneficent protectors of the law. Yet, at that moment, I didn't just want to fuck tha police, both physically and figuratively; I wanted them lynched, drenched in gasoline, and burnt alive. It's one thing to get a catchy couplet stuck in teenagers' heads; it's another to convert half the nation into murderous psychopaths hell-bent on riot and rape. N.W.A. accomplished the latter.</p>
<p><i>Straight Outta Compton</i> was not the first gangsta-rap album, nor was it the first album to use such disconcerting and scabrous blasts of sound, but the music was revolutionary for two reasons. First, Dre and Yella took the vitriolic, cacophonous rampage of Public Enemy and discarded all the motivation and history behind the anger; second, they sampled laid-back jazz, psychoastral-lovetron p-funk, sweetly romantic soul, naïve doo-wop, Martha Reeves, Charles Wright and Marvin Gaye, and proceeded to lay it under the most gruesome narratives imaginable, dead ho's and cop killers. This is tantamount to using a ""Happy B-Day, Grandma"" Hallmark card to inform a family you just slaughtered their grandmother. It's cruel, duplicitous, perverse, horrifying, hilarious.</p>
<p>In some ways, <i>Straight Outta Compton</i> is the archetypal rap album, the one you would send into space if you wanted to ignite a stellar holocaust. It unites the paranoia of <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions</i> with the chill of <i>The Chronic</i>, while still retaining an old-school, Run-DMC-style playfulness. The opening squall of ""Straight Outta Compton"", ""Fuck tha Police"", and ""Gangsta Gangsta"" is still as confrontational and decimating as it was at the dawn of the 1990s. The bass throttles, the funk combusts, and the sirens deafen as Eazy-E dispenses with tired romantic clichés: ""So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!/ You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't no sucker!"" And this is the least misogynistic of N.W.A.'s albums.</p>
<p>In the remaining ten tracks, the group depicts a paranoid, conspiratorial wasteland where faggot cops ""think every nigga is sellin' narcotics,"" where niggas often <i>are</i> selling narcotics to buy gats to kill cops, where bitches have two functions in life-- to suck dick and get shot when they stop-- and where there are two only professions: bein' a punk and shootin' punks. The mind itself is a ghetto, and the ghetto is universal. A lot of people, for whatever reason, take offense to such ideas. William S. Burroughs writes the same thing and gets hailed as the greatest writer of the twentieth century. There is no hope, no messages, no politics, rarely an explicit suggestion of irony. The only respite is ""Express Yourself"", the sweetest anti-drug song to ever take place in a correctional facility. Musically, the rhythm pummels and the scratches are strong but sparse; lyrically, Dre says it best: ""It gets funky when you got a subject and a predicate."" For all the genius, there are some tracks that simply can't compare to the classics. ""If It Ain't Ruff"", ""8 Ball"", and ""Dopeman"" are triumphant rap songs, but they consist of minimalist beats and the silly battle raps that N.W.A. helped eliminate.</p>
<p><i>Efil4Zaggin</i>, meanwhile, is about as close as you can come to a death metal/hip-hop hybrid. People will get hurt here. The group, sans-Cube, is simply trying to further their status as icons of shock-rap. Unlike someone like Alice Cooper or Marilyn Manson, though, N.W.A. sound like they've actually gone insane: The song titles alone (""To Kill a Hooker"", ""One Less Bitch"", ""Find 'Em, Fuck 'Em and Flee"") are enough to send some people into seizures. I have no idea what Eazy-E was doing between albums, but it clearly involved a lot of sadomasochism and PCP-- his lyrics are revoltingly unlistenable: ""Yo, I tied her to the bed/ I had to let my niggaz fuck her first/ Loaded up the 44, yo/ Then I straight smoked the ho/ 'Cause I'm a real nigga."" The main musical motif is the <i>Psycho</i> theme.</p>
<p>The songs here sound like the Bomb Squad in the graveyard Superfly got buried in. ""Approach to Danger"" is essentially rapping over a Halloween FX record. It's complexly debauched, fantastically jagged terror-hop that at its best challenges anything on <i>Fear of a Black Planet</i> and at its worst challenges anything off Dre's <i>2001</i>. It's also much funnier than <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>. Eazy-E's Ten Commandments on ""Appetite for Destruction"" set the bar so high on his first command that he can barely think of enough vices to finish it. In the skit ""Protest"", an N.W.A. concert turns into a scene from <i>Platoon</i>. Eazy also sings on two tracks, one of which (""Automobile"") may as well be titled ""With a Little Help from Your Pussy"". Ten seconds can barely pass before someone is murdered or raped. It's the sound of an expletive anger at its breaking point.</p>
<p>The reissues sounds pretty tight, but high-quality audio was never really the point. The supplementary tracks are a more interesting point of discussion. <i>Straight Outta Compton</i> adds extended mixes of ""Express Yourself"" and ""Straight Outta Compton"". The former may be a better song, but only because it uses more of the Wright sample, whereas the latter regrettably decides to disturb the propulsion of the original by inserting spoken dialogue. The B-side, ""A Bitch Iz a Bitch"", however, is one of Cube's finest moments, beginning as a specification of what he means when he curses, and ending with a tirade against a ""contact-wearin' bitch."" <i>Efil4Zaggin</i> just adds the <i>100 Miles and Runnin'</i> EP, which is fairly superfluous. The title track, though, is <i>easily</i> one of the best rap songs of all time-- N.W.A. if commissioned to write a <i>James Bond</i> theme.</p>
<p>Listening to these discs again just remind me how ludicrous the whole Eminem controversy was. More than a decade ago, N.W.A. was instructing suburbia to smash bitches' brains in with a cock in one hand and a glock in the other. In comparison, Eminem's harshest lyric ends up sounding like, ""I may slightly disagree with certain tenets of popular ideologies."" When Eminem rapes and kills his mom, it's because of a long-standing psychological disorder that relies on a complicated relationship with his family. When Eazy-E does it, it's because nothing good was on TV that night. These are the most nihilistic, apolitical recordings since the Nixon tapes. Anyone who disagrees is a cracka-loving faggot.</p></div>"|11791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11791-straight-outta-compton-efil4zaggin/|9.7|Ray Suzuki

    namesake duo, might be likened to an unplugged version of their Gooom Records labelmates M83: both groups
    share an affinity for arpeggios, sweeping orchestration, and deep, resonant atmospherics, but where M83
    drench their synth-centric shoegaze in bright electronic tones, Cyann &amp; Ben prefer a live approach, resting
    their hushed vocals against darker, more organic instrumentation.  The compositions on <i>Spring</i>, Cyann
    &amp; Ben's debut full-length, are tastefully restrained, yet often achieve epic heights through their cinematic,
    open-air production and full arrangements that sometimes recall the spacier efforts of Sigur Rós or the
    haunted, autumnal folk that lay beneath the layered feedback din on mid-period Flying Saucer Attack albums
    like <i>Further</i> and <i>Chorus</i>.</p><p>
    Opener ""Buick to the Moon"" pulses deliberately amidst garbled, crackling audio samples from David Lynch's
    <i>Wild at Heart</i>, fluctuating madly between speakers.  Two clean-toned electric guitars, floating on
    pillowy reverb, give shade to a ghostly melody.  Atop this mesmeric mist hovers a soft male tenor with a
    female partner wading in and out of accompaniment.  After a foreboding first few minutes, the song reaches
    its first climax on a surprisingly comforting melody spun out by a xylophone, guitar, and vocal trio. It's
    breathtaking, but just over the horizon, a darkness advances once again: Soon, drums enter the fray and
    renew the eerie conviction of the other instruments, which, now rhythmically unshackled, are free to
    challenge the tonal limitations of the song's first half.  It's an incredibly promising track with which
    to open a debut record, and incredibly, <i>Spring</i> only gets better.</p><p>
    ""I Can't Pretend Anymore"", perhaps the track that most inspired my earlier M83 comparison, launches into
    an intense 5/4 waltz after a beautiful female vocal solo noodles throughout an arpeggiated synthstring
    progression.  A guitar carries on the arpeggio, offering still more internal energy to an already
    overwhelming backbeat that threatens to topple over itself at any moment.  ""Siren Song"" drapes dangerously
    enchanting vocals over a whirlpool of cymbals, spelled-out guitar chords, and gorgeous synth tones, a
    guitar occasionally breaking free from the song's mysterious emotional vice grip.  Accordions haunt ""A
    Dance with the Devil"" as a female vocal desperately struggles to keep her focus, distracted by her
    whispering lothario.</p><p>
<i>Spring</i> is an immediately accessible sonic feat, which is particularly striking given its extreme
    self-restraint.  But its sweetest fruits are reaped only after repeated consideration, upon which one
    realizes the depth of complexity behind such initial immediacy. It's a rare strain of ""epic"" music, where
    bravado does not exceed the composition, but remains at all times within it. Cyann &amp; Ben are masters of
    this subtlety, and, along with similar efforts this year from England's George and the upcoming Books'

    <em>Gallowsbird's Bark</em> offers a handful of (supposedly) autobiographical clues to The Fiery Furnaces'
    raucous brother/sister gambol: ""Matthew encouraged Eleanor to come down in the basement to make their
    first Fiery Furnaces music together. Maybe he should have hit and stabbed and smashed her. But he just
    swore.""  Despite some implied tongue-in-cheekiness (and the obvious fact that relentless sibling posturing
    is an awfully exhausted conceit right now, even if these kids really are related), it's a surprisingly
    apt and insightful peep into the bright blue heart of The Fiery Furnaces' blaze: violence, dark rooms,
    boy/girl handholding, and big selfless compromises all vie for attention on this debut, a feisty blues-rock
    barn-dance with enough pings and yelps to keep everyone's little hands curled tightly into fists.</p><p>
    The Furnaces' electric guitar, drums, sparingly applied bass, and freewheeling piano riffs recollect
    everything from Muddy Waters to the Rolling Stones, and <em>Gallowsbird's Bark</em> plays like a big,
    half-drunken romp through golden-era rock 'n' roll-- airy and thrilling and shifty as hell. Lyrics
    mostly consist of quasi-rambling witticisms that somehow come together in the delivery; Eleanor
    Friedberger's brash, oddly assured warble (the evenly hollered ""I pierced my ears with a three-hole
    punch/ I ate three dozen donuts for lunch"") is lovingly reminiscent of the kinds of semi-absurdist
    snickers that Dylan got away with in the late 60s (check the baffling-but-somehow-not credo, ""The sun
    isn't yellow/ It's chicken,"" from ""Tombstone Blues"").  Likewise, the duo's spare, confrontational
    guitar riffing is grating only insofar as it jars; blues-driven, feral, and scribbling all over the page,
    <em>Bark</em>'s sixteen tracks house a mess of weird, undulating musical bits that are hugely intriguing
    despite not always making a whole shitload of sense.</p><p>
    ""South Is Only a Home"" opens the record in a sloppy downhill tumble.  It's a solid, foot-stomping burst,
    with honkytonk piano plonking out a declining scale and a wrestled guitar making a mess that's as thrilling
    as it is damaging.  Both ""Leaky Tunnel"" and ""Inca Rag/Name Game"" channel Lennon/McCartney melody-gone-weird
    (""Inca Rag"" has a piano opening that's awfully close to ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"") while ""I'm Gonna Run"" sees
    Eleanor's Jack White/Chrissie Hynde growl/coo suggestively noting, ""Saw my brother coming up the hill/ I
    tied a beach towel around my wrist.""  It's all muted violence and esoteric observations skidding across
    wily guitar foundations, bouncy piano hits, and puttering percussion.
    </p><p>
    Despite just now cutting their proper debut, the Furnaces have already burned through a pile of drummers
    (Ryan Sawyer bravely grips the sticks here), and the duo's brother/sister throwdown seems volatile enough
    to ignite just about anything seated directly in its blazing path.  They spew the best kinds of sparks,
    though: accessible, but skewed and peculiar enough to keep you peeking nervously over your shoulder every
    couple of minutes.

That's the best way
    I can think to sum up <i>Big Star Story</i>, a retrospective compilation so riddled with problems it's
    difficult to decide where to start talking about them.  It seems pretty obvious that the folks at Ryko
    were trying to come up with a set that could serve both as an introduction to the band's work and as a
    sort of capsule overview of a band whose status in the rock canon is nothing short of mythical.  The
    result, unfortunately, does the group's legacy a tremendous disservice.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the single greatest sin of this collection is that it's patently unnecessary.  Anyone who wants an
    introduction to Big Star should just pick up their first two albums, <i>#1 Record</i> and <i>Radio City</i>,
    which are still available as a two-for-one on a single disc from Ardent Records and usually list for around
    $13.99.  If you want more, track down Ryko's own reissue of the band's swansong, <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>,
    a release that gathers virtually every song cut during the chaotic sessions that birthed that album.
    Congratulations, you now own every piece of Big Star's essential output.  If you <i>really</i> want to go
    crazy, you can even shell out for <i>Big Star Live</i>, which catches the band near their peak in concert,
    and <i>Nobody Can Dance</i>, a compilation of some outtakes and sundry live performances (for the hardcore
    only).  After that, there's nothing left but the solo albums.</p><p>
<i>Big Star Story</i>'s superfluousness established, there's also the fact that it doesn't even live up
    to its name.  This is not the ""Big Star Story"" it claims to be-- the tracks aren't even in chronological
    order, and two of the selections, ""I Am the Cosmos"" and ""You &amp; Your Sister"", aren't Big Star songs at all.
    These last two are actually the A- and B-sides of a solo single Chris Bell single released on Chris
    Stamey's Car Records after Bell had left the band.  Suffice to say, you'll get a few scenes from Big
    Star's career here, but you'll never be able to glean the plot from the haphazard tracklist.</p><p>
    
    And about that tracklist: it <i>is</i> theoretically possible to compile a satisfying ""best of Big Star""
    release, but this doesn't even come close.  First, considering the formidable songwriting talents of
    Alex Chilton and Chris Bell (and even Andy Hummel), why on earth are there two covers on here?  Loudon
    Wainwright III's ""Motel Blues"" is a great song, and Chilton handles it well, but T.Rex's ""Baby Strange""
    just sounds creepy when Chilton warbles, ""I just wanna ball ya,"" and aside from the quality of the
    performances, they're just not Big Star songs-- nor are they essential enough pieces of the band's
    oeuvre to justify wasting the space on them.  They're not integral to the story, you might say.</p><p>
    
    Each album is fairly well-represented, with five tracks from <i>Third</i> and four each from <i>#1 Record</i>
    and <i>Radio City</i>, but the sequencing is jarring, highlighting just how drastically different <i>Third</i>
    is from its predecessors.  Further injustice is served by the fact that ""Mod Lang"", ""You Get What You
    Deserve"" (from <i>Radio City</i>) and ""Don't Lie to Me"", (from <i>#1 Record</i>) are each presented in
    inferior alternate versions culled from <i>Nobody Can Dance</i> instead of their definitive versions,
    while ""Thirteen"" (from <i>#1 Record</i>) is snatched from <i>Big Star Live</i> (an admittedly strong
    performance, but not as rending as the original).  The moment where the disc's inherent clumsiness comes
    into sharpest focus is the one where the crystalline, majestic harmonies of <i>#1 Record</i>'s ""Ballad of
    El Goodo"" give way to <i>Third</i>'s crumpled centerpiece, the haunting death whisper ""Holocaust"".  Though
    both are excellent songs, they don't share a state of mind, nor do they sit well next to each other.</p><p>
    
    The reason Big Star's first two albums work so well on a single disc together is that they're fundamentally
    similar-- each captures the sound of some anglophile kids from the American heartland perfecting a ragged
    brand of power-pop fit for the ages.  Those albums feel like the band knows they're destined to be huge--
    the strumming is confident, the hooks are punchy, the awkward, everyman vocals somehow swagger, and there's
    exuberance in even the most subdued songs.  That the feeling persists on <i>Radio City</i> is somewhat
    remarkable considering the public indifference that met <i>#1 Record</i> at the time, and the fact that
    Bell departed during the sessions, despondent at the band's lack of success.</p><p>
    
    Two years later, the band still hadn't made it, and you can hear it all over <i>Third</i>.  It's a recorded
    document of a band disintegrating while simultaneously trying to grow.  The expansive production and
    experimentation of that record are wholesale left turns from their earlier material, and the final result
    is a brilliant, timeless shambles.  Removed from their natural surroundings, ""Nightime"", ""Holocaust"",
    ""Thank You Friends"", ""Jesus Christ"", and ""O, Dana"" are all still good songs, but they carried more power
    as parts of a logical whole.  And, as mentioned before, Ryko's reissue of that album is everything a
    reissue should be-- informative, comprehensive, and brilliantly mastered.</p><p>
    
    Of course, I still haven't mentioned the most heinous aspect of this compilation: the bait track.  Yes,
    there's a song on this disc that has never been released before, called ""Hot Thing"".  Completists, beware:
    this is unquestionably the worst track to have ever been branded with the Big Star name-- worse, even,
    than the rotten <i>Third</i>-era outtake ""Downs"".  Recorded by the reunion lineup in the 90s, it's a
    lifeless, amelodic song that should have been better considering that Alex Chilton, Jody Stephens and
    Posies co-frontmen Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow all share its songwriting credit.  Even the horn part
    sucks.  And the worst part is that it's included in lieu of any of a dozen other fantastic songs.</p><p>
    
    If this compilation is truly trying to tell the Big Star story, where are important chapters like ""Watch
    the Sunrise"", ""Stroke It, Noel"", ""Way Out West"", ""You Can't Have Me"", ""I'm in Love with a Girl"", ""Kizza
    Me"", ""Kangaroo"", ""When My Baby's Beside Me"", ""What's Going Ahn"", and-- you get the point.  Seriously,
    even if you've never heard Big Star and have no idea where to start, you should still head straight to
    the albums.  They're available on a grand total of two discs, and both of those discs belong in the
    collection of anyone who ever loved the sound of pop songs played on guitars.  If you want to keep going
    from there, it's up to you, but for God's sake, don't trust this thing to start you off on the right foot.</p></div>"|1078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1078-big-star-story/|4.0|Joe Tangari

The obvious     question was asked first: When can we hear some new material?  Shields responded,     ""Definitely sometime this year or I'm dead,"" and then later, ""I really am dead     if I don't get my record out this year."" Six and a half years after that interview     there's still no follow-up to the landmark <em>Loveless</em>, but Shields is very     much alive, working with Primal Scream and doing the occasional remix.  He     recently admitted that the pressure of following what many consider to be a     perfect record is what did him in. He couldn't bear to put the My Bloody Valentine     name on something inferior to <em>Loveless</em>, and so he kept his tapes in the     vault. There was no next chapter and probably never will be; life continues.</p><p>Perhaps the enormous weight Kevin Shields has been living under has been     lifted. My Bloody Valentine exists only as history and now, on the     soundtrack to Sofia Coppola's <em>Lost in Translation</em>, Shields gives his     own name a try.  <em>Lost in Translation</em> contains four new Shields tracks,     his first original work in more than a decade, and though there are eleven     other songs here, the Shields material is the drawing card.</p><p>He first appears on the second track, ""City Girl"", his lone new vocal song.     On first listen it sounds like a demo of a pre-<em>Loveless</em> track,     possibly from the <em>You Made Me Realise</em> era. It's mid-tempo, with an     unusual repeating melody and a two-note chorus. The guitar is simple and     rough, a bit garage-rock, bouncing over characteristically buried drums that     seem an afterthought. This is Kevin Shields the pop songwriter, the guy     with a collection of rare Beatles bootlegs who puts on ""Strawberry Fields""     when he's feeling down. The <em>sound</em> of the thing could be anybody--     no exploration on that front-- but the melody and voice are familiar and     welcome.</p>
<p>The next two Shields tracks are pretty instrumentals that feel more like     film cues (which they are) than proper songs. ""Goodbye"" has a wispy synth     texture and a vaguely Celtic bent, and sounds somewhat Eno-esque but more     emotionally manipulative, like it must play in a scene geared to leave a     lump in your throat. The faint glide guitar textures gently snaking through     the drone offer evidence of its maker, but the signature is subtle. Then     there's the 98-second ""Ikebana"", which consists of lightly plucked electric     guitar over gentle synth washes. It's not boring, exactly, just nondescript.     If you <em>Invisible Jukebox</em>ed me, I might guess I might guess Mark     Knopfler's soundtrack to <em>The Princess Bride</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the odd ""Are You Awake?"" The most sonically interesting of     Shields' tracks, ""Are You Awake?"" combines the steady pulse of a cheap Casio     drum machine with some echoing, dubby guitar effects. It reminds a little of     pre-<em>Autobahn</em> Kraftwerk and the surprising motorik rhythm combines     wonderfully with his gauzy guitar texture, but it's painfully short at a     minute and a half. I get the sense that Shields is on the verge of tapping     into something deeper here, some combination of his guitar depth and cheap     instrumental overlays, but ""Are You Awake?"" doesn't give much to go on.</p>
<p>As to the rest of the soundtrack, Shields' presence extends beyond his new     songs. Maybe I'm just filling in blanks, but aspects of the sound he     perfected can be felt throughout. There's a My Bloody Valentine track     (""Sometimes""), a My Bloody Valentine forbear (Jesus and Mary Chain's     ""Just Like Honey"" closes), and an unexpectedly great My Bloody Valentine     impression (Death in Vegas' ethereal ""Girls""). Squarepusher's short ambient     ditty ""Tommib"" even seems vaguely connected somehow.</p>
<p>Other highlights include Air's mostly acoustic (guitar and piano) ""Alone in     Kyoto"", which echoes the competent mood music of their recent collaboration     with Italian author Alessandro Baricco (sans the narration), and Kaze Wo     Atsumete's ""Happy End"", which sounds like a fine Aluminum Group AM radio     tribute sung in Japanese. There are odd selections (Phoenix's ""Too Young""     sounds like an 80s power-pop track that might have soundtracked a Michael     J. Fox flick), but for the most part, the tracks hang together and flow     relatively well, orbiting the shimmering dreampop mass that serves as the     record's unstated inspiration. The man at the center of that universe sounds     unsteady, but a tentative first step back into the songwriting world is     better than nothing. Here's hoping he makes it a bit further next time.</p></div>"|7714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7714-lost-in-translation/|6.3|Mark Richardson

    broken-hearted court jester through a idiosyncratic and often daringly
    cheesy collection of minimal Casio pickup lines akin to a laser light show
    scored by The Cure and Orange Cake Mix.  One half of Montreal-based provocateurs
    Ro, Weiskopf forgoes the hamfisted Situationist jokes; instead, he tenderly
    enacts twenty-six bathetic scene changes in a wiry forty-nine minute pantomime.</p><p>
    
    Bravely drawing the curtains to the precious ""Chariots of Fire"" swells of
    ""Typecast as You Wish"", the saccharine tearjerker dares the listener to
    place these cloying theatrics within an ethereal soap opera landscape
    inhabited by sock monkeys blindly pirouetting with die-cast shadow puppets.
    The brief ""I Like It"" follows up the introduction with a hard drum machine,
    twisted cable connections, manufactured cricket chirps, and a distended
    conveyor belt issuing varying shots of fiddling feedback that bleed into the
    next bit, ""Rimming"", which seemingly extols the rectal-tonguing capabilities
    of a lover.  Here, Weiskopf whispers and pines growlingly beneath constant
    machine gun fire, piano arpeggios, and-- believe you me-- a Six Cents &amp;
    Natalie bass part.</p><p>
    
    Our master of ceremony's sense of dynamics continues throughout the entire
    collection, highlighted on the movement between the Lesser spaz attack of
    ""Isolation at Transport"" and the too-poignant-for-words ""Getting All Emo"".
    Following his patterns closely is an exercise in manic depression and any
    number of sight gags-- songs pause and skip, back beats turn into oddball,
    upfront solos that create sonic puns. Adept at pastiche, Weiskopf cogently
    directs a cast of abstract computer sounds, punk-rock answering machines,
    computerized vegetable chopping, <i>The Goldberg Variations</i> played by
    elves, low-tech dance tracks, splatter paint, and stately marches for
    malfunctioning robots at a luau. Now wrap it all in red velvet and pink
    champagne and ask it for a kiss.</p><p>
    
    Appended to <i>Immediate False Relief</i>'s twenty-one gun salute are five
    vocal tracks from the <i>Ohym</i> EP, which shift the tempo via a broke-ass
    Trent Reznor mooning through the Pet Shop Boys. Besides ""Skin Off"", a horny
    malfunctioning NIN bit about tight asses (the backing grind and sitar-styled
    breakdown are nice touches) and the really sweet closer, ""He Sells Music"", a
    music box rejoinder to The Magnetic Fields' ""Take Ecstasy with Me"", these
    bits lack the unspoken verve of the mostly instrumental works preceding
    them.</p><p>
    
    Weiskopf really hits his stride when he keeps quiet: playing the nail-biting
    Pierre Crube, a ghostly blue-boy swathed in a yellow glow, he's able to
    swivel mutely outside standard song structures, levitating in a precious
    space between <i>Hooked on Bach</i>, <i>The Charm of the Highway Strip</i>,
    and a taciturn Rod McKuen's airbrushed seductions.</p></div>"|1720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1720-immediate-false-relief/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    version of his true debut, <i>The Other Side of the Looking Glass</i>, it became exceedingly clear where
    his interests were heading-- and where his potential was greatest.  Though by no means an anemic MC, those
    instrumental tracks revealed Alias' inspired production and germinal compositional skill to be his leading
    endowment and most intriguing contemplative outlet.  <i>Eyes Closed</i> is his first, full-fledged
    instrumental-only release, and though a testament to why every member of his Anticon crew (in addition
    to other visionaries such as Atmosphere mastermind Slug, Sage Francis, and Markus Acher of, yep, The
    Notwist) has collaborated with him, it also fails to meet its own standards of compulsion for the entirety
    of its brief twenty minute junket, and rarely breaks form.</p><p>
    
    The album's recipe is familiar: drones, synths, skittish and contrasting percussion rhythms (typically
    intensified throughout the track or cascaded down after a calculated lull), and some TV or radio vocal
    overdubs all cooked into a spacious, moody concoction.  The first three songs file in dutifully after
    one another, each producing the same temperate effect and utilizing media snippets of vanilla anti-consumer
    flavoring.  Unfortunately, there's no real bite to the message, musically or philosophically. ""Must Consume"",
    in fact, sounds deceptively akin to the Dust Brothers' work on the <i>Fight Club</i> soundtrack, both in
    tone and anti-capitalist propagation, detracting from the piece's relevancy.  ""Eyes Closed"" is a little
    more sparsely produced, but the immediate ferrying in of the anti-Bush rider suffocates the track.</p><p>
    
    The finest work is done on ""Dec. 26th, 2002"", and while never fully stepping out of the (DJ) Shadow to
    shine on its own right, it does employ excellent mood manipulation and a fine release of tension, and
    winds up the only track that says something-- without, uh, saying anything. It's nervous and suspecting,
    reserved and taut, and manages to escape the fetters of parody.  Like each track, the production itself
    is sterling, retaining a gritty laptop personal touch without forfeiting sonic acuity.</p><p>
    
    None of the songs excavate new ground, and with each track clocking at under five minutes no single moment
    is able to breathe free long enough to truly sink in.  Perhaps with vocal textures these cuts would suffice,
    but on their own they're too naked to stand straight.  Previous Anticon releases such as Why's
    <i>Oaklandazulasylum</i>, or even Alias' early work in Deep Puddle Dynamics succeeded primarily on
    two counts: vision and balls.  <i>Eyes Closed</i> has one, but distinctly lacks the other.</p></div>"|408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/408-eyes-closed-ep/|6.0|William Morris

    Which struck me as pretty odd, as it should anyone who's heard North of America before.  And of course,
    it's <i>not</i> really danceable, but I'll give this person the benefit of the doubt and assume they
    were just using ""danceable"" in place of the more accurate ""rhythmic.""  You can kind of bob your head
    along awkwardly (mind those odd meters, though), but you'd likely wind up with contusions if you actually
    tried to move your body to the stuff.  Perhaps it's just the musical phase we're all going through that
    has folks crying ""dancepunk!"" every time a shouty band with a competent bassist comes along-- even when
    that band predates this new footloose phase rock is going through right now-- but on their third
    full-length, North of America, as ever, remain pretty firmly entrenched in Dischord-inspired post-hardcore.</p><p>
    
    The Nova Scotian quartet has always just barely managed to avoid that tag by reining in the vocals, but
    anyone who ever worshipped at the altar of the D.C. scene will wax nostalgic when they hear the interweaving
    guitars, stop/stop dynamics, sorta-melodic shouted choruses, and brow-beating rhythms that make up
    <i>Brothers, Sisters</i>.  The band has cleaned up some of the excess tempo changes that impeded last
    year's <i>The Sepultura</i> EP, but they still Drive Like Jehu from start to finish, and the relative
    sameness of their approach means that, despite their continued evolution, the new album still sounds
    mostly like a collection of variations on a single song, with little exception.</p><p>
    
    One of those little exceptions is unfortunately a formless noise swamp called ""You Want to Join My Cult"",
    but the other makes up for it.  ""All Actors Are Liars"" is stunningly poppy and melodic for these guys,
    replete with female backing vocals to smooth the band's own rough edges.  The song's spastic/melodic
    bipolar disorder makes it the first thing you'll remember when the laser sits idle in the stereo.  They
    almost repeat this success on ""Oh My God, Oh My God, Everybody, Oh My God"" (my vote for best song title),
    a song that begins slowly, with the band slipping into a vocal call-and-response round of ""thank you""s
    and ""you're welcome""s that builds beautifully, but the payoff is a little disjointed, leaving you wanting
    more.</p><p>
    
    The band keeps the mix drier than the Atacama throughout, and leans toward the high-end to a degree that
    could make Albini himself blush.  What I'm saying is, your subwoofer won't get much work here.  Yet, as
    dirty as things sound sometimes, the band never fully distorts their guitars, aiming more for skin-prickling
    semi-clean tones that sound good playing dissonant patterns.  ""Voting 'No' on the Warming of Antarctica""
    barrels along with so much activity that the cymbals overtake everything at points, drowning the grinding
    guitars and metallic bassline in a flooding wash.</p><p>
    
    The vocals (handled by several band members; each goes only by his last name and none are credited with
    specific duties) fall about halfway between the bark of Ian MacKaye and the slack of Stephen Malkmus--

Mix and link these together to form your own review of this album! The first 666 respondents
    get a faux-silkscreen Che Guavara t-shirt! The next 14 typists get a copy of R.E.M.'s homewreckin' <i>Monster</i>!</p><p>
<li> I got my third Tascam Portastudio today from an eBayer (sorry, dude, I don't do feedback, because
    ANARCHY) and on the toilet I was reading the hilarious manual <i>The Fast Track to Multi-Track</i>, with
    stuff about how <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> was made on a four-track. Whoo doggie. Inspiring.<p>
<li> If Phil Elvrum made this album, one would barely be able to approach it for the moat of critical
    spooge.<p>
<li> Jack Logan's <i>Bulk</i> should be the last album to be culled from a bunch of homemade demos. Because
    critics just call subsequent collages <i>Bulk</i>-like.<p>
<li> Is the album title a shout-out to the clackity classic <i>The Arizona Record</i> by Silver Jews? Does
    it have Nebraska's nascent scenelords in mind?<p>
<li> In his fascinating essay entitled ""The 'Feminization' of Rock"", Tony Grajeda argues that lo-fi
    represents a girling of genre, using both Pavement and Sebadoh's terrified response to the spectacle of
    roid-rage that is Henry Rollins. (Grajeda also examines the masculine ad-culture around hi-fi equipment.)
    Which is funny, because <i>The Omaha Record</i>, an example of 2003 lo-fi, is pretty durn asexual. What
    are these songs <i>about</i>? One senses that Hudson's resident genius Eli Simon's only passion is to
    make more songs.<p>
<li> Many of these cuts are klezmer-core. Muszikas meets power-pop. Indie-march. Grit-polka.<p>
<li> Damn if the bedroom vanguard didn't succumb to overproduction (see Liz Phair's Matrix abomination,
    see Pavement and Beck's work with Radiohead's knob-polisher).<p>
<li> For those who love blasts: ""The Chilling Sorcerer"" and ""Tokyo"" build to sharp, tremendous, glammy
    blasts.<p>
<li> (This wily, scattershot disc has served as relief pitcher on many a mix CD this summer.)<p>
<li> Hey, speaking of <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>, these soggy Bottom boys love that Beatle solo-tone, which they
    bring to The Beach Boys on ""Eagle Eye"" and to the countrified work of the Rolling Stones on ""Omaha Ray""
    (which owes its soul to ""Factory Girl""). Can you say 1960s? Waiter, this gravy is wavy!<p>
<li> But wait! Simon often earns the title of Bedroom Bowie, especially on the excellent ""Motorcade""! But
    wait! Simon often sounds like a Virginian ambassador for New Zealand's Tall Dwarfs and Peter Jeffries.
    Who doesn't love when patriots cop redcoat accents? Hi, Liars! Hi, Mr. Pollard (did you serve as a
    consultant on ""Pockets"", with its you-esque lyric, ""The fact of the matter is, my friend, they sold you
    to the wind king""?)!<p>
<li> The intro to the babyfat ""Shoop"" crosses the line of Barlow-homage by looping its ""behind-the-scenes""
    self-deprecatus. Meanwhile, ""Red Election"", despite Polara-caliber lyrics and vox, explodes into skree
    worthy of Rollerskate Skinny and the late, great Jellyfish Kiss.<p>
<li> Even devotees of pawn-shop drum machines must admit that this act is a chunk of studio time away from
    shedding its everyband veneer. Pity their versatility for being cast into a world in which an ""album"" is
    burdened with being considered a coherent statement rather than an audio diary of the last few years'
    divergent strains.</li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|1076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1076-the-omaha-record/|7.0|William Bowers

With his     reputation preserved amongst us youngsters as the Godfather of Grunge (apparently based on little more     than a predilection towards flannel), he's already known by all as the hip great-uncle amidst the     <i>Woodstock</i> era's senile grandparents.  Still, attention must be paid to the most impressive feat of     Young's career: an all-but-perfect streak of very good-to-excellent albums that spanned an incredible, and     unparalleled, eleven years.  To put it another way, from 1969-1979, Neil Young was rock's Joe Dimaggio.</p>
<p>Which makes it especially cruel that, for years afterward, Neil's eccentric skepticism about the auditory     worth of the compact disc format kept many of those albums out-of-print.  So it's somewhat ironic that now,     in the dying days of the digital disc, Reprise Records has finally convinced their stubborn client to allow     for patching up <i>most</i> of these holes, rescuing four albums from obscurity and bootleggers.  Fancy     remastering, fancy packaging: who cares?  I can finally retire four crackly vinyls to wall-decoration duty.</p>
<p>The most criminal omission by a long shot was <i>On the Beach</i>, the 1974 disc that represented Young's     last ramp-up before his masterpiece, <i>Tonight's the Night</i>.  Recorded with help from The Band's crack     rhythm section and colorful multi-instrumentalist hick Rusty Kershaw, <i>On the Beach</i> is one of the few     from Young's catalog that doesn't land easily on either his country or hard-rock piles.  Three song titles     with the word ""blues"" give you an idea of the mood, but hardly prepare you for the bleak anger of ""Revolution     Blues"" or ""For the Turnstiles"", post-apocalyptic visions as eerie as any of <i>28 Days Later</i>'s scenic     pans.  The real engine of the album's brilliance, though, is the trio of slow, long, lonely hotel room folk     songs that closes out the album, peaking with Neil's ""Desolation Row"", ""Ambulance Blues.""  To hear them is     to know that Jason Molina goes to bed each night caressing a copy of this record.</p>
<p>The stark tone of <i>On the Beach</i> was only carried over to one track from 1977's <i>American Stars     'n' Bars</i>, the creepily lo-fi ""Will to Love"".  What fills the remainder of the album is a sort of     buffet-style Neil Young, offering up choice leftovers from various failed projects of the era.  The     peak, of course, is ""Like a Hurricane"", perhaps one of the finest examples of Neil's willfully untechnical     guit-hartic playing style, a chord progression that induces string-popping frenzy in his live shows to     this day.  But also making appearances are Skynyrd Neil, slashing country-rock lines through ""Bite the     Bullet"" and Farm Aid favorite ""Homegrown"", and Sensitive Poet Neil, revisiting <i>Harvest</i> seasoning     with ""Hey Babe"" and ""Star of Bethlehem"".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, reclaiming that <i>Harvest</i> mood is what chokes the majority of <i>Hawks &amp; Doves</i>,     notable for being the dashed-off post-<i>Rust Never Sleeps</i> album that breaks his streak of excellence,     and not much more.  Other than faux-traditionals ""The Old Homestead"" and ""Captain Kennedy"", this 1980     release captures an uncharacteristically tentative Neil, clearly unsure of whether to develop quirky     singalongs like ""Lost in Space"" or plastic soul like ""Staying Power"" (an early harbinger of his recent     unbecoming Motown romanticism).  Young can't even seem to stay on task thematically here, sequencing the     patronizing ""Union Man"" before ""Comin' Apart at Every Nail""'s fanfare for the working man.  Consider that     the title track is brimful of pro-American nationalism from the Canadian-born songwriter, and you've got     a good idea of just how confusing an effort <i>Hawks &amp; Doves</i> can be.</p>
<p>But confusion was to be the name of the game for Young in the 1980s, a period celebrated for his principled     resistance to record company pigeon-holing, but very, very rarely actually <i>listened</i> to.  The fourth     reissue in this batch, <i>Re-ac-tor</i>, doesn't quite fall into the gimmick trap that so much of his     second full decade's work did, but the effort is still held back by an unhealthy fascination with using     guitars as sound effect generators: machine guns in ""Shots"", backfiring cars in ""Motor City"", train engines     in ""Southern Pacific"".  Quality of songwriting and fierce playing by Crazy Horse manage to redeem the album,     however: ""Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleaze"" and ""Shots"" rank as two of his most underrated barnstormers.</p>
<p>To own all four reissues, then, is to witness a couple snapshots of the man mid-streak, and a couple from     the immediate aftermath, as he began to slouch towards genre experimentation and respectably above-mediocre     twilight.  However, all but the most devout Neilologists should forgo the latter two; it'd leave enough     money to track down a bootleg copy of <i>Time Fades Away</i>, now the only neglected step-child of Young's     peak period (and despite what you may have heard from Neil himself, one of his best).  Although we'd love     to see that record in print, too, us superior folk would no longer have anything to lord over the peons.     Sorry, Col. Molina, your secret recipe is out.</p></div>"|11868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11868-on-the-beach-american-stars-n-bars-hawks-doves-re-ac-tor/|9.5|Rob Mitchum

However, all but the most devout Neilologists should forgo the latter two; it'd leave enough     money to track down a bootleg copy of <i>Time Fades Away</i>, now the only neglected step-child of Young's     peak period (and despite what you may have heard from Neil himself, one of his best).  Although we'd love     to see that record in print, too, us superior folk would no longer have anything to lord over the peons.     Sorry, Col. Molina, your secret recipe is out.</p></div>"|11868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11868-on-the-beach-american-stars-n-bars-hawks-doves-re-ac-tor/|6.8|Rob Mitchum

    surprise from Clint Conley has been the debut of his own band Consonant, which slipped into Boston last
    summer and has played a comparative handful of gigs-- almost as few as the Burma reunion, but in more
    intimate clubs.  A favorite on many end of the year lists (including mine), Consonant's self-titled first
    record was nevertheless so unassuming, such a straight-up indie rock guitar record, that you could spin it
    again and again and completely overlook how special it was.</p><p>
    
    Not much has changed on the band's second release: in fact, as satisfying as it is, it's hard not to judge
    it side-by-side with their debut.  Conley has kept the band together-- Chris Brokaw (Come, Codeine) on the
    other guitar, Winston Braman (Fuzzy) on bass, and Matt Kadane (Bedhead, The New Year) on drums fill out
    what amounts to an indie rock all-star quartet, with none of the showcasing that could imply.  The most
    obvious difference is that <i>Love and Affliction</i> starts with a mood instead of a hook.  The first
    disc demanded your attention with those perfect first few notes of ""Blissful"", and Consonant only took a
    more sprawling route on a couple of songs, like ""What a Body Could Do"".</p><p>
    
    This album cuts right to the building and cresting volume of ""Little Murders"", as Conley's and Brokaw's
    guitars roar like guys tuning their Mustangs in adjacent driveways.  And then there's Conley's voice,
    lacking the machismo of his earlier band, sounding even more fragile here than on Consonant's debut.
    Conley can sound open and damaged, not unlike Robert Wyatt, but on ""Cry"" I could picture him emulating
    the fierce resistance of Kristin Hersh; the lyrics, mostly written by Holly Anderson, bring in an even
    more feminine tone.  The cussedness of their earlier lyrics has gotten stern and lonely, the ""hey, I'm
    in a band again!"" ebullience turning into something darker.</p><p>
    
    The raw underproduction helps each track blend into the next, riding a constant flow of distorted guitars.
    But it also obscures the details.  Harmonies are buried in a chorus, guitars fade away in the middle of a
    ballad: any time the band gets too quiet, they risk disappearing completely.  That recording style makes
    them sound even more like a ""guitar band,"" and it's perfect for anyone who sentimentally prefers a band
    that sounds like they're playing in your basement-- while you're upstairs.</p><p>
    
    The only real criticism is that the moodiness takes a toll on the songwriting: while there ain't a weak
    track, you won't find the obvious pinnacles or ecstatic Kinks-like guitar pop.  The album's catchiest
    track, ""Mysteries of the Holiday Camp"", propels Conley's funny tour-in-England anecdotes, but the graceful
    hook on ""She's Driving Fast"" just cribs from ""(There Is a Rose In) Spanish Harlem"".  For the rest of the
    album, the strongest tracks are the ones that bear monster power riffs-- like ""Blue Story"", with its
    incongruous, ""We are the priests of the temple of Syrinx""-like imagery, or ""Dumb Joy"", which ebbs and flows,
    angry and wistful, as Conley bares himself through break-ups.</p><p>
    
    Where Consonant's first record was so unexpectedly rewarding, this one's ""just"" a strong follow-up.  But
    there's also no doubt the band has grown, and that Conley has made a fair exchange of accessibility for
    honest, emotional power.  After you've heard the debut, <i>Love and Affliction</i> comes strongly
    recommended: it would, after all, be a mistake to take these guys for granted.</p></div>"|1588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1588-love-and-affliction/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

    so opposite. The artists with the largest fanbases are either deeply rooted in tradition or defined by
    their eccentricity.  The ones with the most important impact, however, have a certain way of combining
    both portions into a single, equal serving. Falling upon this ambiguous sub-region is Johnny23 Records
    CEO and artist LoDeck, with his debut LP, <i>Dream Dentistry</i>.</p><p>
    
    A concise arrangement of philosophical pondering and bass-heavy beats, the album is driven by Deck's
    rhyming style. He writes like Aesop Rock mixed with Redman, but his hung-over, rusty, cracking New Yorker
    vocals and devil-may-care charisma call for comparison to rappers like Sticky Fingaz and MF Doom. In short:
    LoDeck raps like the Ivy League freshman that went to Daytona Beach for Spring Break and never came back
    to school.</p><p>
    
    A natural New York-dirty punchline master, LoDeck attempts to power you into his fanclub with subtle jabs
    and crosses. Not only is he ""too ill/ Like Eazy-E at 'Tha Crossroads',"" but if he's ""too predictable,""
    he'll ""twist up like Blanka."" Even when he spits out ""The Russian ain't playin'/ My real name is Boris,""
    his delivery redeems the randomness of the line.  His concepts include the negatives of the idiot box on
    ""Inside the TV"", the misunderstandings surrounding the societal standing of underground emcees on ""Applause""
    (""You want a satellite dish? All us rappers are rich!""), and the nature of affection on the aptly titled
    ""Love"". LoDeck's major issue is that his meandering stream-of-consciousness flow often sacrifices coherency,
    topical restraint and consistency for a tighter flow, which, by the end of most of his tracks, tends lose
    any of the concepts he began with.  It does make for an enjoyably raw listening experience but a level of
    sustained conceptual depth could help him to cross the bridge into Classic County.</p><p>
    
    ""Word is Virus"" is a highlight, regardless of the lame freezing glitch-hop beat and corny vocal sample,
    featuring Paramount and sub-underground superhero Mac Lethal. After LoDeck proclaims his ""loopy crew acts
    like soccer thugs with one goal"" and that he's ""blessed with the same charm that freezes cobras,"" Paramount
    sleepwalks through a flow-oriented verse, leaving room for Lethal to steal the show. Opening by pantomiming
    Beanie Sigel, Mac twists and contorts his delivery around his Midwest battle style, offering a loose, bouncy
    alternative to the stark ambiguity of Deck and Paramount: ""Your crew's about as thuggy as the Shriners/
    Rocking turbans made out of trash can liners.""</p><p>
    
    Flanked by producers FredONE, Chum Chopz, Big DeEP and perennial Aesop Rock beatmaker Blockhead, the beats
    on <i>Dream Dentistry</i> definitely disappoint when paired with LoDeck's vocal assault. The Blockhead
    compositions rise above the others with the aura of professionalism that made LoDeck's <i>Bash It!</i> EP
    such a stark triumph-- unfortunately, nothing on this record touches ""Stethoscope Alley"" or ""I Pollute""
    in the realm of production.  Chum Chopz, in particular, is hit/miss. ""Watchtower"" runs romper stomper with
    hard drums and a spiral staircase bassline that works well, but ""Love"" is rendered almost unlistenable by
    tinny guitar licks and a sloppy choral vocal sample.</p><p>
    
    Of course, even if his lack of song structure and freeform rhyming throws some people off, LoDeck has clearly
    evolved his lyrical status since the ridiculously dope <i>Bash It!</i> EP; it's just that, here, he's lost
    the beats, and still yet to gain songwriting focus.  His next project could hold a deeper listening
    experience; in the meantime, <i>Dream Dentistry</i> remains a powerful testament to his novel rap style.</p></div>"|4952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4952-dream-dentistry/|7.1|Rollie Pemberton

I was
    fresh out of high school then, living with my parents in the outlying suburbs of Minneapolis, trying to
    craft an embryonic Pitchfork into something respectable without any prior writing experience.  In the
    throes of that disgustingly humid, buggy summer in which it seemed I would one day die as I'd lived--
    navigating the road construction obstacle course on Hwy 5 and despising an oppressive day job, yet forever
    hopeful of some distant, supernatural delivery-- <i>Secaucus</i> was sunwarmed bliss, the infinite pleasure
    zone I couldn't stop hitting.</p><p>
    
    Bursting immediately at its seams with the serrated dual guitar blast of ""Yellow Number Three"" and ""Built
    in Girls""' steam-engine roar, <i>Secaucus</i> welcomes with a warm immediacy rare in even the most revered
    pop treasures, and a density whose every layer hides another secret synth melody, jagged hook or vocal
    harmony.  The depth of realization in this record is unparalleled: every angle is perfected.  Its surplus
    of pristine pop hooks and energetic discharge rivals the best of Built to Spill, Guided by Voices, Pavement,
    or any other heralded indie rock band, and tracks like the anthemic, accelerating ""I've Made Enough Friends"",
    the wistful malaise of ""Won't Get Too Far"", the hurtling ""Surprise, Honeycomb"", and the emotive high-school
    slowdance number ""Jane Fakes a Hug"" reveal proof in spades: Beyond their euphoric harmonies, melodic rapture,
    and marblemouthed vocals lie some of the greatest lyrics the genre's seen yet.  Respectively, these songs
    contain tales of a nationwide murder rampage (""Being good made me burst/ The killing got worse/ It almost
    got fun""), a lovestruck abandonment of social lives (""A rush of wonder/ This charm we're under might last/
    Are we too hoping/ Our years are showing and fast""), a hopeless high school graduate who fears he won't
    live up to his father's achievements (""I can't believe I'm grown/ None of my friends live at home/ Not
    since fall""), and the harrowing play-by-play of a brutal divorce (""Our oaths, our realty, a good job, a
    husband/ A husband or what/ Christ, Jane, I'm not/ I never was"").</p><p>
    
    But as long ago as all of that was for me, for The Wrens, it's been an eternity.  The band always made
    themselves accessible via Internet, and as the years passed, I would frequently email to wonder when a
    follow-up was due-- and even as I knew they had respectable careers and families, I didn't expect it
    would take seven years to see release.  I also hadn't known that, at the height of their 1996 U.S. tour,
    all promotion for <i>Secaucus</i> was, allegedly, pulled in a huff by Grass Records labelhead Alan Melzter
    when the band dared question a million-dollar contract he'd tried to strongarm them into signing.  It was
    just another in a long string of sloppy breakups that would eventually sour the band on the music industry.
    After endless reassurances that their third album would be out ""in a few months, we promise,"" hope began
    to fade that the record would ever see light of day at all.  Then came word that they had actually finished
    the record, and-- to celebrate and prevent them from further second-guessing-- were holding a party to
    destroy the master tapes.</p><p>
    
    The package finally arrived from the band themselves: an advance, unmastered CD-R labeled <i>The
    Meadowlands</i> with makeshift artwork and tentative song titles.  Excitedly, I threw it into the car
    stereo, and waited.  Waiting.  Waiting.  <i>What the fuck happened to these guys?</i>  It had been seven
    years, sure-- no one was expecting anything as powerful as <i>Secaucus</i> from middle-agers, but to say
    The Wrens had mellowed would almost be a joke: There was little trace of the youthful, resonant joy or
    ecstatic intensity of <i>Secaucus</i>.  This was a completely different band.  These Wrens were defeated,
    miserable, hopeless, and-- in their own words-- exhausted.</p><p>
    
    Disappointed, I shelved the disc and stubbornly refused to listen to the final pressing, even after it
    arrived at the Pitchfork P.O. box loving wrapped in Tiffany-blue ribbon and paper.  Which was about when
    everyone I knew began raving.  People were stunned at my reaction: Surely we'd just heard different albums?
    And we had, but upon finally listening to the finished version after heavy persuasion from friends, it
    began to make more sense.  This <i>was</i> a completely different band, defeated, miserable, and exhausted,
    absolutely, but not hopeless.  Defying the unwritten rule that any band breaking a five-plus year hiatus
    must return lethargic and sapped of inspiration before retreating again to obscurity, here The Wrens prove
    themselves even more shockingly relevant than before-- they have survived extinction, and, fully inspired,
    they are telling the tale: <i>The Meadowlands</i> is a crushing confessional, documenting every disappointment
    of the past seven years, every difficult breakup, every bad gig.</p><p>
    
    If The Wrens were lyrically powerful when writing from third-person perspectives about trivial fantasies
    on <i>Secaucus</i>, they're devastating delivering their own personal failures, hardships and resignations.
    The breakup tracks are the least of it, and even those are masochistically autobiographical with recurring
    characters and story arcs bridging songs. ""She Sends Kisses"" opens on an acoustic strum and reflective
    accordion, increasingly piling on layers of instrumentation (electric guitar, drums, piano, vocal harmonies)
    while Charles Bissell reflectively croons, ""A sophomore at Brown/ She worked lost and found/ I put your
    face on her all year.""  ""Ex-Girl Collection"" is upbeat on the surface and conflict beneath: ""Ann slams in/
    Another lightning round begins.../ 'Charles, I found out/ Wipe that smile off your mouth/ I think it's
    tell-me time.'""  ""13 Months in 6 Minutes"" is somber and damp-eyed, dewy guitars drenched in wet reverb
    and whispered vocals at the end of a relationship: ""I'm a footnote at best/ I envy who comes next.""</p><p>
    
    But the first-hand accounts of the band's own struggles are what really hit hard, particularly for listeners
    who've waited the full seven years or who have intimate familiarity with similar situations.  ""Everyone
    Choose Sides""-- backed by crusty guitar fighting determinedly through tape falloff, electric piano, and
    Jerry MacDonnell's insistent, urgent drumming-- is a notable album peak: ""Bored and rural-poor at 35/ I'm
    the best 17-year-old ever.../ We're losing sand/ A Wrens' ditch battle plan.../ Everyone choose sides/
    The whole to-do of what to do for money/ Poorer or not this year and hell's the difference.""  And then
    there's ""This Boy Is Exhausted"", which blends the record's brightest hooks with its bleakest lines: Over
    two layers of blaring guitars (one pulsing, the other jangling), more of MacDonnell's colossal drumwork,
    and resolute background vocals, Bissell's hardened vocal buzzes: ""I can't write what I know/ It's not
    worth writing/ I can't tell a hit from hell from one sing-along.../ But then once a while/ We'll play a
    show that makes it worthwhile.""</p><p>
    
    The Wrens are now old enough to be considered indie rock's elder statesmen (their ages range from 33 to
    40), and in trading the adolescent kick of <i>Secaucus</i> for ripened resignation, meticulous refinement
    for crippling maturation, they have realized their magnum opus-- the only album to eclipse Broken Social
    Scene's staggering <i>You Forgot It in People</i> on my year-end list.  <i>The Meadowlands</i> exemplifies
    what every fan hopes for when a band announces a reunion or returns from more than a half-decade of silence:
    that they might have somehow improved exponentially each year they hid from the limelight, resulting in a
    payoff so cultivated it could be called their defining achievement by consensus.  It's the reason we
    continue to harbor mixed feelings about a Pixies comeback: odds are, it ends in disappointment-- it always
    does-- but <i>The Meadowlands</i> is that one example left standing to offer a glimmer of hope.  Black
    Francis, tomorrow this could be you.</p></div>"|8742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8742-the-meadowlands/|9.5|Ryan Schreiber

    the seventh grade, computers unforgivingly archive even the most tangential, half-remembered experiments.
    Taken as a whole, the digitized narrative's abortive starts and eventual triumphs transform a lifeless
    hard drive into a fractured bildungsroman that traces the lopsided development of its anonymous archivist.
    On <i>Pasted Lakes</i>, unwilling to click and drag his nascent apprenticeship into the trash, Brooklyn-based
    Nick Forté remixes and recontextualizes the slapdash scraps and cutouts of his first forays into computer
    music, creating a mixed bag of jaggedly lurching electro experiments initially intended to fit together as
    a different album entirely.</p><p>
    Draping this recycled project in a futuristic atomic-era floor plan, Forté levitates stylistically between
    muted Lesser and highly caffeinated Nobukaza Takemura; though he mentions utilizing the rhythmic pacing of
    Wire and The Minutemen as a guide for his work, that particular swing isn't apparent beyond the theoretical
    nod. Assuming he had found a way to harness the spirit of <i>Double Nickels on the Dime</i> or a fraction
    of the energy from his work as a guitarist in early 90s hardcore mainstays Rorschach or his later staccato
    slicing in NYC post-punks Computer Cougar, this stuff would absolutely sizzle with crunchy dynamics, a
    microwave stuffed with pastel paint samples. Instead, like Christmas Decorations-- his pretty but vacant
    Kranky-released ambient project with Steve Silverstein-- <i>Pasted Lakes</i> is largely a patch of
    disjointed background music suffering from snippet sizing and thin <i>Yars' Revenge</i> formations.</p><p>
    The first track on the album, ""Green Language"", provides the exception.  Here, on the longest and most
    dynamically sustained piece on the album, Forté creates a richly detailed floatation device suggesting
    a tide pool in its tiny waves of asymmetrical percussion, shimmering loops, tonal refraction, and a
    mooning guitar's hum like a digitized gull escaping into the rocky brush.  Another strong track, ""Blender
    Dance"" works along two strands: gentle percussion powered by shiny star reflections torn apart with a
    ratty tonal loop. More reminiscent of poor-man dadaist Phil Milstein than the high-modernist gloss of
    Mouse on Mars or Oval, the other works flit and flutter as brief sound-effect montages; some heave and
    hurl and fold inward, others stagger over sine waves or burrow through logarithms, but none take off or
    swagger into different dimensions. ""Sugar Lemoned"" is slowcore Gamelan played with digitized kazoos;
    ""Did You Feel That?"" falls into <i>Space Invaders</i> territory. Likewise, ""Swallowing Gel"" is a flatulent
    Atari attack from congested locusts. Bits like ""Crack and Crevice"" and ""Kill Your Carpet"" coast at a
    slower pace, without managing to shift the tonal quality of the work. But all isn't lost.</p><p>
    While Forté's leftovers do lack the depth and textured spaciousness of more experienced progenitors of CPU
    riffage, the rugged punk-rock heart beating behind his often beautiful collages produces a sense of gleeful
    discovery absent on more dryly established productions. And that's a small good thing.</p></div>"|3258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3258-pasted-lakes/|6.7|Brandon Stosuy

    have seen their gag reflexes honed, suddenly trained to fire full-force at the slightest mention of a
    self-consciously ""happy"" rock song.  Now, eschewing angst and moody poetics for exuberant gushing, the
    Boston trio Apollo Sunshine (in addition to agreeing to a gush-gush name) are fighting hard to get
    good-feeling indie-jams back into the ""acceptable"" realm with their debut record, <i>Katonah</i>.</p><p>
    
    Like Ben Folds without the sarcasm, or The Flaming Lips without the psychedelic twist, Apollo Sunshine
    hock their giggles-and-grins untempered by even the slightest twinge of a dark, foreboding undercurrent.
    Even the record's sleeve glows bright, sporting well-developed pictures of cheery kids and green grass,
    golden retrievers, blazing bonfires, and quaint wooden country-porches.  But Apollo Sunshine have still
    managed to transcend the off-putting goofiness that so often accompanies these types of endeavors (see
    Fountains of Wayne and the getting-more-unbearable-by-the-second ""Stacy's Mom""), releasing a record that,
    for all its feel-good leanings, isn't mind-numbingly upbeat, or even especially radio-ready.  That
    subversion of expectation is what keeps things interesting; along with their bright-eyed optimism,
    the band offers up some surprisingly innovative songs and lots of quirky, <i>Sgt. Peppers</i>-ish
    instrumental flip-flops.</p><p>
<i>Katonah</i> opens with its title song-- a meandering keyboard melody sputters and squeals, dancing
    around a charging bassline, the entire song popping open like a burst of multi-colored confetti before
    folding into itself, drifting down into drone and finally bleeding into the next track, the frizzy
    alt-rocker ""Fear of Heights"".  For the most part, vocalist/guitarist Sam Cohen covers the usual lyric
    terrain (""I Was on the Moon"" recounts the birth of his little brother; ""The Egg"" examines the cycle of
    life/confusion that accompanies coming of age), but his earnestness is endearing, never wincingly gooey,
    and always well offset by the kicks and hops going on around him.</p><p>
    
    The key to the this album's appeal is that almost nothing, save Cohen's fairly straightforward vocals, is
    doing exactly what you think it should be doing at the appointed time: pretty, harmonized endings twitch
    into jarring, distorted openings, by-the-book guitar strumming unexpectedly somersaults into weird, unbound
    wailing.  It's not that <i>Katonah</i> is anything less than a collection of melodic, hook-riddled cuts,
    it's that Apollo Sunshine refuse to stop moving, harnessing all their collective, happy-go-lucky energy
    into a curiously frenetic album, resulting in a debut record that shifts and wiggles like a pile of
    newborn puppies.</p></div>"|403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/403-katonah/|7.2|Amanda Petrusich

    joints; malfunctioning machinery whose friendly, yet damaged hum provides
    the faintest clue its computerized emissions might have originated from a
    human mind: these scenes from the lab of German electronic music composer
    Asmus Tietchens are just a few skewed demonstrations of his distant mastery
    of highbrow composition guised in synth-pop's veneer.  In the early 1980s,
    before he set out on a full-time mission of modern musique concrete and a
    goal of ""absolute music"" (that which doesn't necessarily paint a picture or
    tell a story, and most certainly makes no concessions to the accessible),
    Tietchens followed a detour into short, immediately distinctive electro-snap
    jingles for vintage German electronica label Sky Records (Moebius/Plank/Neumeier,
    Conrad Schnitzler).  1981's <i>Biotop</i> was only his second LP after 15 years
    of perfecting his craft, and should be right on time for folks down with
    futuristic pop like Cluster or Kraftwerk.</p><p>
    Perhaps you're wondering, ""If this guy is so great, why haven't I heard of
    him?""  My guess is that since albums such as <i>Biotop</i>, and others like
    <i>Spat Europa</i> and <i>In Die Nacht</i> scheduled for reissue on Die Stadt,
    have never been available on CD until now.  Also, Tietchens (born 1947 in
    Hamburg) has done a pretty good job of hiding from anyone who might dig
    strange, tuneful synthesizer ditties by concentrating on more ""serious,""
    formalistic electronic works, and releasing albums on such notable experimental
    labels as Ritornell and Staalplaat.  Klangkrieg's Felix Kubin has been an
    outspoken champion and collaborator of Tietchens, but for the most part,
    I'd say he hadn't exactly received much due outside of uber-hipster
    electronic music circles.  With that in mind, <i>Biotop</i> is a delight,
    and with any luck, it will make Tietchens a household name-- at least in
    houses that already hold modern-day groups like Mouse on Mars, Kammerflimmer
    Kollektief and even The Notwist in high esteem.</p><p>
    This reissue begins with two previously unreleased tracks that fit in very
    well with the rest of the album, and in fact serve as a nice summarization
    of the loopy, compact etudes contained therein.  ""Futurum Drei"" gallops
    along with classic Moog lines reminiscent of ones made famous by Wendy
    Carlos in the early 1970s, though Tietchens isn't here to space you out.  In
    fact, despite the odd layer of reverb and persistent, pinging bassline, the
    music doesn't seem so much an exercise in electronic composition, but the
    incidental music to a retro-futuristic movie about a trek through the
    desert.  ""Fast Food"" is much more rhythmically forceful, featuring a goofy,
    pogo-bounce Latin beat that somehow makes Casio seem like the keyboard of
    choice for the discriminating listener.  Better yet, Tietchens' melody is
    superb; fans of Yellow Magic Orchestra or early Human League (you know who
    you are, Plagenhoef) should get a major kick out of this.</p><p>
    ""Modern Arroganz"" is synth-pop taken to its logical endpoint: uptempo robo-funk
    and staccato snare over which minimal Moog hits pitter-patter to no end alongside
    a computerized vocal proclaiming who knows what scarifying mantra.  ""Trümmerköpfe""
    eases in with considerably less frantic precision, employing faux-exotica sound
    effects (Tietchens could have given Esquivel a run for his money) and a cha-cha
    4/4 beat.  In a bizarro universe (or the one in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>), maybe
    this stuff is used as super-strength advertisement music, offering homemakers
    of the future everything they could possibly need.</p><p>
    Other pieces, like the title track, are more obviously experimental.  ""Biotop""
    begins on a single, piercing note and expands to include overtones from a whole
    range of synthesizer technology most musicians probably haven't even explored
    now, much less in 1981.  As layer upon layer of bright, somehow comforting
    fuzz-ambience subsumes the original tone, it suddenly recedes like a supernova
    into a shadow of its former brilliance.  Like most accomplished composers,
    Tietchens' had a way of making simple elements work wonders.</p><p>
    Die Stadt is presently in the process of releasing all of Tietchens' early material
    in a series of 18 CDs, of which <i>Biotop</i> is the second.  It's my favorite of
    his, and if you're interested in the development of IDM in any way, it's practically
    required listening.  Of all the archival electronic recordings awaiting reissue,
    Tietchens' work on Sky is some of the most necessary, and consistently enjoyable.
    Highly recommended.</p></div>"|8238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8238-biotop/|8.5|Dominique Leone

    to the fickle and fashionable sands of time.  While Alfonso Robero infomercials and <i>Thriller</i> videos
    defined dancefloor moves for the 1980s, 90s kids ground on glowsticks and made ""energy balls"" while
    flopping about in size 50 Dickies. Which is to say that what's considered danceable now was not necessarily
    so scant years back.</p><p>
    
    While wallflowering remains the dance of choice for New York's cooler-than cognoscenti, there seems to be
    a bit more fidgeting out in San Francisco.  Gal quartet Erase Errata are often mentioned in the same breath
    as easily-clumped ""dancepunk"" acts like The Rapture, Liars, and !!!, and for good reason: wiry, spastic,
    and elastic around their stripped-down culminations of the last twenty years of underground punk and all
    its permutations, Erase Errata is, at their very core, exuberant. Even a recent set of remixes by Kid606,
    Matmos, Adult., and Kevin Blechdom failed to significantly alter the group's sound or make it any more
    danceable. The same goes for the band itself, though, as the follow-up to 2001's <i>Other Animals</i>,
    <i>At Crystal Palace</i>, simply keeps the course.</p><p>
    
    ""Driving Test"" is the best commuter-meditation-as-portrait-of-suffering-humanity since Nilsson's ""Driving
    Along"", as singer Jenny Hoyston watches the spectrum of faces blur past. The rest of Erase Errata revs and
    taps the brakes before settling into a jaunty, stripped-clean groove buoyed by bassist Ellie Erickson and
    the piston-clicking precision of drummer Bianca Sparta, whose rhythms come and go for scant instants at best
    before skittering apart and re-forming. For the most part, the sonic surprises are scattered to the corners
    of songs-- there are little touches here and there: like the trembling trumpet that tremors along with the
    guitar at the end of ""Ca. Viewing"", taps of piano, or the tape reversal on the second half of the bounding
    but otherwise too-brief ""Surprize It's Easter"".</p><p>
    
    For the opening moments of the almost anthemic ""Let's Be Active c/o Club Hott"", Sara Jaffe's spiky guitar
    leads are strident and irregularly melodic. The brain-scratching strings that bob with the eye-thudding
    bass and clamming hi-hat of ""Owls"", jerk with a tempered ferocity that frees up sharp elbows and wobbly
    knees for the most spastic of dances.  Simple rebounding pull-offs set the rollicking base for ""Retreat!
    The Most Familiar"", which remains the most tightly wound and effective rock number of the set. Were it not
    already a Kid606 remix, it would cry out for the treatment.</p><p>
    
    The past, for the most part, is evoked, but the album escapes being too heavily indebted to it. There's
    plenty of Minutemen twitch, Dog Faced Herman tick, Bikini Kill bossiness, and a cleverly wrapped polemic
    that even recalls the Desperate Bicycles' delicious DIY rhetoric. While sophomore efforts can fall either
    to heightened expectations, shorter gestation period, or overreaching goals, the girls have instead kept
    the machine largely intact and untinkered with, even stripping it all down to a lean twenty-seven minutes.
    At a future point, the jitters Erase Errata elicit on the dancefloor may be recalled merely as some
    generation's cringe-worthy fad, but with their grasp of time's out-bursted brevity, they have their
    moves down pat for the moment.</p></div>"|2820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2820-at-crystal-palace/|7.6|Andy Beta

    full-length from lonely songsmith Owen Ashworth (aka Casiotone for the Painfully Alone) reveals endless
    nuance and wit within a seemingly exhaustible medium: two-minute Casio keyboard-spun pop songs.  It'd be
    all too easy to file his now static formula under ""harmless gimmick,"" but what Ashworth lacks in breadth
    and depth he gains in sonic fluency and ease of digestion.  And while he has essentially tapped this act
    for all it's worth (<i>Twinkle Echo</i> being his master's thesis in battery-powered home recording), I
    still can't quite bring myself to elevate him into a new stratospheric peer-bracket.</p><p>
    
    In application, his true classmates (and, in truth, professors) run the gamut from Stephin Merritt and
    John Darnielle, as evidenced through his piecemeal song structures and earnest delivery, down to sonic
    colleagues All-Time Quarterback and Atom &amp; His Package.  Xiu Xiu frontman Jamie Stewart, with whom Ashworth
    will soon embark upon a Japanese tour, guests on this album to aid with the mixing and once-augment
    Ashworth's Casio SK-1 and keyboard army with a few smears of guitar. He even plays shows with The Rapture,
    so all told, circumstance doesn't exactly paint a painfully lonely picture.  However, most of his music
    does.</p><p>
    
    Although Casiotone's music is fundamentally digitally based-- comprised of stock percussion tracks, a few
    protracted waves of flimsy keyboard rhythms, and one-shot narrative verse-laden melodies-- it feels wholly
    organic.  The sound is full of lo-fi hiss and obfuscation, as if maybe Ashworth left his equipment out in
    the rain overnight, or needs to change the AA's.  Man and machine limp arm-over-shoulder through many of
    these fourteen threadbare snapshots, never playing chicken with the hard-and-fast limitations bearing down
    on them.</p><p>
    
    Each song is emotionally laid bare, giving the impression that the fourteen inclusions here were written
    for no more than an audience of maybe fourteen people, though Ashworth claims not to air out his personal
    (mis)fortunes in his songs.  He continually references locales (""I wish we could've talked all night/ We
    had to be in Illinois by daylight"" from ""Jeane, If You're Ever in Portland"") and time (""Six more weeks
    and it's back to school/ It's perfect weather/ The moon is full/ We'll ride all night under the streetlights"")
    as if encoding moments from a personal timeline that flows through his keyboard.  In the latter track,
    ""Casiotone for the Painfully Alone in a Yellow T-Shirt"", Ashworth fittingly delivers the line, ""Don't
    borrow the car/ It's what we've got bicycles for,"" in an excellent metaphor for his pragmatic approach
    to storytelling.  He takes the simplest route from A to B, and though the sketches do come off as personally
    affecting, they gain universal appeal through their artlessness.</p><p>
    
    ""Toby, Take a Bow"" employs nearly the exact same high-end percussion pattern as Death Cab for Cutie's
    ""Photobooth"", but instead of counter-punctually launching into a warm pop lick, he meets the beat below
    the water line and wades in the foamy, under-produced wake.  Occasionally he turns up the tempo, as on
    ""It Wasn't the Same Somehow"" and ""Students for the Scarves &amp; Charms"", but never abandons the stark,
    conversational delivery of his slower moments.</p><p>
    
    For such a literate and levelheaded lonely talent, Ashworth exploits the medium for all its worth without
    ever venturing into pretension, and this is precisely what ensures him success and makes this album such
    an effortless listen.  Of course, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to seem him take a swing at
    something bigger.   After all, the twice-mentioned Ben Gibbard (ATQ's ""Why I Cry"") as well as Atom &amp;
    His Package have already covered Stephin Merritt songs in recent albums, which tells me something: The
    well for this sort of thing has nearly run dry, and though CFTPA has managed to escape dehydration,
    Ashworth could conceivably better quench his thirst in deeper waters.</p></div>"|1336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1336-twinkle-echo/|6.9|William Morris

The early Skam catalog still goes for exorbitantly high prices, and     while I snatched up the soft blue cardboard sleeve of Darrell Fitton's first full-length as part-investment,     part-listening pleasure, it never sunk in as an out-and-out classic.</p><p>Before I even realize it, though, here I am looking back nostalgically for those idyll days of IDM, when     the programming and exponential mutations were secondary to how the emotive melodicism of the lines played     out. Not much has changed on this reissue, really, save that Mr. Fitton's face has been replaced with a     doodling by Skam's resident draw-rer, Mr. England. Spotters may feel gypped by the reasonable pricing,     but Pitchfork's blind readership will be chuffed to know that Skam's telltale Braille strip remains intact     on the jewel case.</p><p>Opening with a grandeur that recalls Aphex Twin's sweeping remix of Gavin Bryar's ""The Sinking of the     Titanic"", ""Glink"" is an epic opener of alien gurgles, expansive strings, and slowly ventilating beats.     Bola's pedigree extends back to Warp's Rosetta Stone of Artificial Intelligence (he actually appeared     on Vol. 2) and that similar sort of synth classicism pervades the tracks. ""Versivo"" and ""Amnion."" offer     a middle ground between the ""golden"" sound of Autechre circa <em>Amber</em> (pre-algorithmic number crunch)     and the hazier hues of one-time labelmates Boards of Canada. Climbing between these two pillars, the     vistas attained are still gorgeous, if not vaguely Kitaro-esque, untouched by either time lapse or     technological leaps.</p>
<p>""Forcasa"", separated into three sections, sweeps with grandeur through the middle of the album. The     rhythms puncture the docile, near-""meditational"" hillside sounds like resonant aluminum rabbit fences.     The consequent shine of the beat has a touch of rust, though, which keeps ""Forcasa 1"" rooted and earthy,     the swells and sprung gusts of synth blowing across the structured metallic lattices in a glorious way.     The second section reveals those pastures to be almost ""jungle,"" as the steel drums and cymbal hits patter     like rain in denser keyboard layers.</p>
<p>It ain't Metalheadz; in fact, it's closer to Vangelis' gestures and     analogue ideals of space gas and ether than anyone could've suspected-- especially when compared to the     more awkward Tricky bloke-hop of releases like the <em>Mauver</em> EP, or in brief lapses on the otherwise     gorgeous <em>Fyuti</em>.  ""Aguilla"", meanwhile, is a lost Skam classic from the ridiculously arcane pressings     in the seven-inch format, fully saved and realized in album form soon after. Bobbing on an overcast drum     hit with just enough staticky crunch left at the center of its haze, Fitton effectively dribbles in choral     curlicues and telltale flautist airs as intimate as anything the Boards do.</p>
<p>Going back to <em>Soup</em> reveals its true properties: it's much more low-key and subtle than his geographical     peers near Manchester, yet mines a similar mid-to-late 90s aesthetic. Comforting and as innately familiar as     Mom's homemade Split Pea, the melodic base is better clarified on this reissue, an alien lightness and     separation in its soundtrack broth that stays buoyant and warm. A Miso perhaps?</p></div>"|1071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1071-soup/|7.9|Andy Beta

    been derided as simpletons for spawning the now-mostly-unloved big beat genre, recording with Noel Gallagher,
    and unwittingly earning a spot among the U.S. media's leading faces for 90s ""electronica.""  Some dance
    purists sneer at their lack of a traditional floor-filling build and release (they more often opt for
    a highlight-reel approach instead) and their tendency to exalt their collaborators at the expense of the
    crowd.  But, while it's true the duo's key to success was their tendency to borrow heavily from rock's
    immediacy and penchant for noise, their rock/dance interface did seem a fresh and natural progression of
    dance music's mid-90s evolution.</p><p>
    
    From their roots in Manchester's Acid House days, the duo's clear talent lied in the combination of
    hip-hop's urgency with the crowd-pleasing peaks of house and techno.  Innovation never seemed as much
    a priority for them as repeatedly striking a listener's pleasure zone-- though, to be fair, there is a
    more of a sense of narrative and conscious dynamic in their records than can be found in those of big
    beat contemporaries like Fatboy Slim, Propellerheads and Apollo 440.  It's unfortunate that Astralwerks
    has chosen this moment to compile the first decade of the duo's career (mid-90s electronica seems to be
    in the deepest valley of cultural relevance that it may experience in the next twenty years), but it's a
    solid collection nonetheless, rounded out with two new tracks: one collaboration with Canadian rapper
    K-OS, and another with The Flaming Lips.</p><p>
    
    Presented chronologically, the disc opens with two songs from the <i>Exit Planet Dust</i> LP.  ""Song to
    the Siren"" and ""Chemical Beats"", originally credited to The Dust Brothers (the moniker was later ceded
    to the American production team), sounded something like a hybrid of Public Enemy (mostly due to their
    pillaging of Bomb Squad riffs and breakbeats) and less effete shoegaze groups, albeit with heavy influence
    from the Balearic melting-pot.  ""Leave Home"" follows, offering more pummeling sub-bass and homage to
    old-school hip-hop-- it even contained the prominent B-boy vocal snippet ""brothers gonna work it out,""
    doubling as a statement of intent and a reference to their bandname litigation.</p><p>
    
    ""Block Rockin' Beats"", the first of a handful of selections from the band's U.S. breakthrough, <i>Dig Your
    Own Hole</i>, is also peppered with sirens and bass, and while it may have been their most direct hardcore
    techno/hip-hop crossover, its reliance on repetition and a near-pop song structure made it feel slightly
    overlong.  The buzzing, psych-informed Noel Gallagher collaboration ""Setting Sun"" borrowed liberally from
    The Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" and featured screeching guitar and a brilliant mid-frequency breakdown
    before throwing the listener back into the deep end of sub-bass and breakbeats.  Another Beatles-quoting
    track, ""The Private Psychedelic Reel"", demonstrates the band's eclecticism, belying its techno roots. So
    far, so good.</p><p>
    
    Despite its attempts to move away from pervious sound, the duo's third album, <i>Surrender</i>, was hamstrung
    by too much recycling: the same guests or types of guests, the same moods, and the same use of soundbyte
    and dynamics.  Here, the Brothers made concessions to their rock stardom and continued to engage with that
    world in the few ways they knew how-- more textured, atmospheric guitars and drowsy, morning-after vocals.
    The pedestrian ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" lacked their usual big drums and obvious hooks, which would be fine were
    its vocal sample stronger.  Compared to some of <i>Surrender</i>'s more house-oriented and delicately
    textured tracks-- such as ""Music: Response"", the delightfully minimal ""Got Glint?"", and ""Under the
    Influence""-- ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" was an electro-house snore.  The Balearic, almost filter-disco feel and
    Bernard Sumner vocals of ""Out of Control"", however, are a welcome addition here, as is ""Let Forever Be"",
    which, despite the duo's decision to fly in the drum track from ""Setting Sun"" and to feature another
    over-stretched vocal from Noel Gallagher, was ultimately a more sophisticated offering than its predecessor.</p><p>
    
    2002's <i>Come with Us</i> was coldly received by the public and critics, and the songs featured here fail
    to make a solid case for reconsideration.  ""Star Guitar"", the collection's most rave-oriented track, doesn't
    leave much of an impression, but may as well be Beethoven's 9th next to the Richard Ashcroft collaboration
    ""The Test"".  Opening with a bit of ""Papua New Guinea""-like tribalism, the song is ground to a halt by
    Ashcroft's flaccid shaman act and ponderous drug lyrics.  The song is simple hippie bullshit, a deserved
    companion for Fatboy Slim's equally wretched Jim Morrison-quoting ""Sunset (Bird of Prey)"".</p><p>
    
    The duo's new collaboration with K-OS raises the question as to why, when hip-hop has so obviously informed
    their music, they'd never before teamed with an emcee, even while K-OS' lyrics and delivery are somewhat
    wanting.  The Flaming Lips collaboration ""The Golden Path"", meanwhile, features a bouncy Pet Shop Boys
    beat over which Wayne Coyne employs what is essentially his natural voice for most of the track before
    drifting into his more recognizable affected falsetto.  Unfortunately, like Ashcroft, Coyne seems to prefer
    play-acting to making a positive contribution, and his stream-of-consciousness good-vs-evil dialog is
    detrimental to the track's staying power.</p><p>
    
    Though one could easily be misled by its title, this compilation doesn't purport to be a <i>complete</i>
    collection of The Chemical Brothers' singles,  Among the missing are ""Loops of Fury"", inexplicably
    relegated to being the highlight of the album's limited-edition bonus disc, which offers eleven B-sides,
    mixes, and rarities as extras.  Additionally, the disc features a live version of the also regrettably
    omitted ""Elektrobank"", as well as the ""original version"" of <i>Come With Us</i> highlight ""Galaxy Bounce"",
    and B-sides such as ""Morning Lemon"" and ""If You Kling to Me I'll Klong to You"".</p><p>
    
    So like many career-spanning collaborations, <i>Singles 93-03</i> sacrifices quality control for a democratic
    approach that lends nearly equal weight to all four of the band's albums, and avoids the opportunity to
    re-examine and highlight lesser-known tracks.  For more than ten years, the Chemical Brothers have been
    one of the most vibrant post-acid house artists in the UK, but the only clear reason for their fans to
    plump for this disc are mostly located on the now-requisite limited-edition bonus disc.  Were the record's
    second half to have been filled with the best bits of the Chemical Brothers' last two albums, rather than
    offering a handful of limp new tracks and minor hits, these two discs would have been the best possible
    1-2 punch for Chemical Brothers newbies.  As it stands, those two discs are still called <i>Exit Planet
    Dust</i> and <i>Dig Your Own Hole</i>.</p></div>"|1413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1413-singles-93-03/|7.8|Scott Plagenhoef

Take your time.  Don't make a hasty decision, because it's
    not really one of those kinds of music where you can dip your toe in to decide if it's lukewarm enough.
    Norway's Emperor are where I started a couple of years ago, and thus far, where I'm stuck.  It's not that
    their stuff isn't so unfuckingbelievably great that I can hardly keep from breaking your windows, but--
    where to go after this?  Every piece of music they played seemed like a final statement, something to
    bookend the miserable/triumphant human experience.</p><p>
    From 1991 until 2001, Emperor enjoyed top black billing and, although Mayhem predated them by several years,
    are often referred to as the kings of the genre.  Because of their various legal troubles over the years
    (just the average church burning, homosexual partner slaying shenanigans most of us went through during
    our sensitive years-- oh, and some light Satanism), they've gotten some press that may have inadvertently
    hoisted them into a larger spotlight than they asked for.  The morality police will have my head for this,
    but I think the writers who focus on that stuff are probably the same ones thinking Emperor would be a lot
    better if they didn't scream all the time.</p><p>
    The band formed in 1991 as a trio featuring guitarist/keyboardist/lead-singer Isaahn, drummer Samoth and
    voluntarily freaked elf-guy Mortiis on bass.  They recorded an extra lo-fi, hi-black demo titled <i>Wrath
    of the Tyrant</i>, which got them signed to UK metalmongers Candlelight Records.  After a split with fellow
    Norwegians Enslaved, adding drummer Bard Faust (watch the blade), and subtracting insane-clown-gnome
    Mortiis, Emperor produced their undisputedly classic full-length debut, <i>In the Nightside Eclipse</i>.
    This was an album that retained all the gothic, ragged edge of <i>Wrath</i>, but upped the compositional
    ante and musical diversity with operatic vocals in between the tried-and-true Isaahn growl/shriek, and
    their best-yet use of symphonic grandeur via synths and extended tunes.</p><p>
    When drummer Trym Torson (formerly of Enslaved) joined, the band altered their sound slightly, going with
    a more overtly technical style-- some people called it prog-metal, some extreme metal, others call it that
    noise Mike Patton was doing with Dillinger Escape Plan.  In any case, 1997's <i>Anthems to the Welkin at
    Dusk</i> and 1999's <i>IX Equilibrium</i> did nothing but expand their worldwide profile, though especially
    after the latter, perhaps alienated a few fans thinking they'd gone all Dream Theater.  Emperor's swan song,
    2001's fairly amazing <i>Prometheus: The Discipline of Fire and Demise</i>, is arguably their most technically
    and compositionally complex album.</p><p>
<i>Scattered Ashes: A Decade of Emperial Wrath</i> is the VH1-style special-length specimen those of you
    curious about Emperor should seek out: one disc of choice album cuts from throughout their career, another
    disc of rarities and covers.  Everything great about the band is on display here, and if you're left wanting
    more, you can always head for the albums and EPs.  <i>IX Equilibrium</i>'s ""Curse You All Men"" opens the
    first disc, and if you didn't request a pummeling-- well, fuck it.  DIGGADIGGADIGGADIGGA goes the double
    bass, as Isaahn's silo of riffs suck my head in.  His humble musings on the nature of things (""My word is
    your defeat, and thou shalt not be able to hide anymore!"") hardly take away from power of the song.  Say
    what you want about Emperor's wanky later days, they knew how to produce an album.  Even better is
    <i>Prometheus</i>' ""The Tongue of Fire"", which features one of the great, cyclical-depressive guitar
    riffs.  It's as if Faith No More decided grew a pair (no, a real pair), hired a serious drummer and
    realized that, yes, you can fill up a metal song with synths and not get labeled alt-something.</p><p>
    Later, <i>Nightside</i>'s ""I Am the Black Wizards"", probably their best-known song, makes its entrance.
    At this point, Emperor were still slightly ""amateur"" in their execution, but much closer to the darkness
    I would attribute to prototypical black metal.  In truth, the feel of their early music isn't that far
    removed from straight thrash, but Isaahn's hawk-cry vocals and the band's ultra-compressed, top-heavy mix
    injected a claustrophobic, disturbing tenor to their stuff.  To me, ""Wizards"" <i>is</i> black metal.
    ""Inno a Santana"" (also from <i>Nightside</i>) foreshadows their later work using the orchestral majesty
    of Isaahn's vocal harmonies and angelic keyboard lines, but still packs a wallop from via Faust's
    skull-pound thrash drumming and a swirling, echo chamber ambience.</p><p>
    As usual, the first disc is for the press, and the rest is for the fans.  Their cover of influential
    ""Viking metal"" masters Bathory's ""A Fine Day to Die"" actually plays up Emperor's more traditionally,
    straight-up metal roots.  It's not as fast as a typical Emperor track, but is almost as furious due
    to the blunt thud of drums and out-of-character acoustic guitar interludes.  Thorns' ""\xC6rie Descent""
    (from an Emperor/Thorns split) gets the extra-badass treatment, and is especially impressive when you
    consider that this kind of vaguely Sabbath-inspired haze-metal seemed well beyond Emperor's reach by
    1998.  Bonus points for the 19th century pump organ, though some detracted for the ""Sworn"" remix that
    might sound okay during the slower <i>Matrix</i> scenes, but not here.</p><p>
    I don't want to mislead you: Emperor are squarely metal, and if you have a problem with that, <i>Scattered
    Ashes</i> will probably be too much to take at once.  But that's fine-- break her in, listen to her soft,
    peek at your CD player when you think it's not looking.  At some point you're going to have to face them
    head on.  Anyone already into the band will want this compilation for its second disc (and probably skipped
    this review entirely), so for the others, I'm reaching out.  Sometimes you have to have a little faith,
    and if you can't trust the kings of black metal, then who?</p></div>"|2889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2889-scattered-ashes-a-decade-of-emperial-wrath/|8.5|Dominique Leone

    room for the development of a slightly more personal hype. Such is the case with Metric.  Reportedly
    starting their band based on a mutual distaste for white Toronto funk bands, Metric melds together the
    usual suspects (The Cure, XTC, The Velvet Underground, New Order) for a new wave-tinged exploration of
    off-kilter indie rock.</p><p>
    
    You may remember frontwoman Emily Haines from her work with Broken Social Scene and Stars.  Here, she
    seldom attempts the kind of mesmerizing, super-hushed whispers of BSS's ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old
    Girl"", instead showing off a nicely breathy sing/talk and a clear affinity for vocal fluctuations and
    cadence changes.  The subject matter is even more varied than her vocal range: spanning topics as diverse
    as a friend's altered clothing aesthetic (""On a Slow Night""), to the importance of social status (""The
    List""), to the inquiry of whether it's ""wrong to want more than a folk song"" (""Wet Blanket""), Haines has
    an array of lyrical targets on display and she, more or less, handles the shooting range.</p><p>
    
    One of the most stunning successes on <i>Old World Underground</i>, ""Succexy"" takes issue with the
    political agenda of the U.S. government from a more creative stance than the indie world's typical anti-Bush
    rhetoric and generalizations. Instead of placing the blame purely on the government, Haines claims, ""All
    we do is talk, sit, switch screens/ As the homeland plans enemies."" Slipping between power chords and
    her own serpentine synth lines, Haines juxtaposes sex and war without sounding lost in her own thoughts.</p><p>
    
    Metric aren't overly adept from a technical standpoint, and their melodies sometimes feel a bit too
    simplistic, but, in attempting a mix between accessible dance-punk and new wave, they do deliver where
    it counts: their rhythm section is incredibly tight, and drummer Joules Scott-Key's delightfully funky
    meter is particularly notable.  Still, the band rarely attempts anything out of the ordinary, and their
    lack of innovative arrangements often translates to a tendency for existing ideas to overstay their
    welcome.</p><p>
    
    With Emily Haines' previous work as a frame of reference, you'd be right to assume that Metric does
    maintain an aura of talent, with the band serving as a hard melodic edge to her serene, plaintive
    vocal.  Though still searching for their place in the ever-evolving world of indie rock, Metric, in
    their current incarnation, promise great things sooner rather than later.</p></div>"|5547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5547-old-world-underground-where-are-you-now/|7.3|Rollie Pemberton

    riled-up, power-pop endeavor, are pounding out the same sort of elastic, hooky guitar rock that McCaughan
    himself once used to kick out with Superchunk.  Culled directly from the Merge backyard (Raleigh, NC),
    The Rosebuds are an energetic three-piece (guitar, keyboards, drums) harboring a bold, arm-flailing
    rhythmic tendency that should earn them piles of favorable comparisons to contemporary dance-punks
    Hot Hot Heat and Radio 4.  But it's The Rosebuds' full-on embrace of pop formula-- big, rousing choruses,
    twitchy keyboard bits, insistently bouncing drums-- that ultimately makes them such an addictive outfit.</p><p>
    The Rosebuds' unquestioning approval of all things sweet and melodic is also what makes them bend,
    occasionally, a little bit twee: you won't find the slightest indication of a disdain-soaked smirk
    lurking beneath their canny synths and grinning vocals, and while that earnestness might seem unbearable
    on paper, it can be enormously engaging in action.  Their debut, <i>Make Out</i>, incites the same kind
    of giggly, brainless exhilaration that goes along with actually making out-- and appropriately, it's only
    thirty-five minutes long.</p><p>
    ""Kicks in the Schoolyard"" is an exuberant, Kinks-ish bash (at barely 2\xBD minutes, it also cuts out before
    anyone can ask too many questions) that sees Kelly Crisp's keyboards and Ivan Howard's guitar taking equal
    swipes at the melody, ably backing up Howard's full, sloping vocals. ""My Downtown Friends"" (aside from
    hosting the inarguable city-kid mantra ""we're going downtown/ Trying to get in for free"") offers more of
    the same feel-good, 50s-inspired pop, complete with a wailed ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" refrain.  ""Drunkard's
    Worst Nightmare"" is a bit darker (although still far from nightmarish), with some distorted guitar soloing
    slipping in and out of a high, howled chorus.</p><p>
    Overall, <i>Make Out</i> tends to skew slightly retro, but lovingly so-- the record's clean, straightforward
    keyboards and vigorous beats invoke the late 80s without making any grand, iconoclastic statements about
    what that nod might or might not mean.  The band's at their best when they stick to glowing, enthusiastically
    up-tempo, guitar-led tracks.  Some of the ballads here can seem unnecessarily gooey or unbearably repetitive
    (see ""Big Heartbreak"", ""The Make Out Song"")-- enough so that they may test the tolerance of even the most
    patient power-poppers.  Mostly, though, <i>Make Out</i> is a quick, breathless somersault, all kicking feet
    and nodding heads, mouths wide open in dumb, singalong bliss.</p></div>"|6889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6889-make-out/|7.3|Amanda Petrusich

    shows) is that The Sounds are a perky, lovable bunch of Swedes that meld punk and new wave.  In actuality,
    they're more a conjoining of less irritating pop of the 80s (The Ramones, Blondie) with the more irritating
    pop of the 80s (Loverboy, Pat Benatar). Now, 80s pop might mean a lot of things to a lot of people, infused
    with an ambiguity beyond description, but whatever we mutter about it under our breaths, the word ""punk""
    seldom comes up in relation.</p><p>
    
    Dashing all expectations, however, The Sounds have a song called ""Riot"". Now I may not have passed Punk
    101; I admit I still don't really know what Crass was. But my general intuition is that if you have a song
    called ""Riot"" anything, you are probably punk.  Also, a vast majority of these songs are what we might have
    considered to be punk in middle school. There's probably not a great distance between The Sounds' titular
    song and your typical intentionally unrealistic adolescent Offspring song. It's a lot of ""We don't care
    about the world today/ We're not living in America and we're not sorry"" and tales of ""teenage porn stars.""
    (Never mind that the average American probably sees an indissoluble link between Sweden and porn.)  This
    is about the gist of most of the songs that aren't about ""getting up and dancing.""  And hey, I ain't
    complaining.  It's a pretty simple political philosophy (yes to porn stars and dancing, no to America)
    that even the most jaded of today's younglings might clamor to embrace.</p><p>
    
    It would be a grave disservice to all involved, however, to call this boisterous, jubilant, sleepover-at-Casey's
    disco-punk rampage ""political music."" In fact, it's ironi-feminism. On the perversely appealing ""Hit Me"",
    Maja Ivarsson enjoins us (or me, anyway), to ""hit me hard, hit me right between the eyes."" I admit, the
    offer intrigued me; it took a strong recollection of my spiritual training to refuse to comply. But this
    brutal temptation to deck an innocent girl was merely my willingness to participate in a faux-jazz,
    hyper-propulsive grime accented by a keyboardist (Jesper Anderberg) who clearly doesn't even know where
    his volume control is, let alone how notes played together might constitute a chord.</p><p>
    
    But permit me to make amends for my long and tedious-- and perhaps unfair-- grievances. The ensuing song,
    ""Mine for Life"", is a faithful duplication of Garbagesque camp that attaches a maleficent beat to some
    quivering synths. We can make fun of Ivarsson's lyrics all we want. The fact of the matter is that the
    line, ""If this is called living, well don't count me in,"" is at least worthy of a Ramones song; I'm pretty
    sure I heard it somewhere on ""Tombstone Blues"".  ""Rock 'n' Roll"" musters just the right amount of
    capriciousness and martyrdom in the name of rock.  It would make many cringe, but deflects any criticism.
    The song is fully aware that it is, at best, a two-note bass riff with an angular chorus straight out of
    the ""Hawaii 5-0"" theme.</p><p>
    
    More often than not, <i>Living in America</i> trades melody and choruses for jumping octaves and rapid-fire
    synthesizer scales. Of course, sometimes that's exactly what the alcohol doctor prescribed. This music,
    like most of Sweden, is entirely dedicated to senseless and irresponsible fun. It was designed to be
    listened to and forgotten on the radio, not to be compiled as an album. Fully understanding the triteness
    of the following, I'm still compelled by Pitchfork's Hippocratic oath: While every song might not sound
    exactly the same, a good three-fifths do.  I think the general arbitrary consensus is that if you're at
    that age where you just discovered pop music, go for it; this is exactly the type of album you should be
    constantly enjoying; if you're not going to Cub Scouts this summer, you really should have found something
    a little more sophisticated by now.</p></div>"|7701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7701-living-in-america/|5.9|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    Thomas Bernhard, the shit-and-swan-obsessed Vienna Actionists, and the super cloying yet oddly affecting
    <i>The Sound of Music</i>, which, as a kid, I unwittingly turned into transgression worthy of Otto Muehl
    by shifting the melancholic refrain of ""Edelweiss"" into the more violently intrusive ""Anal Vice"". On
    <i>Kitsch Concrete</i>, Vienna-based broadcaster, author, DJ and musician Fritz Ostermayer coaxes these
    disparate points of departure into a waft of garish prettiness that exudes the desolate joy of a
    tinsel-strewn pub swathed in red felt wallpaper and sporting a jukebox dedicated to both the desiccated
    whirls of Musique Concrete and the martini-fueled torch-songs of Mel Torme and Roxy Music.</p><p>
    
    Sublimely evoking an Austrian Johnny Cash shooting for high notes, Ostermayer applies the tenants of
    Pierre Henry to trumpet, clarinet, choir, boy/girl duets, electronics, tinny samples, drums, and drum
    machines, and dislocated bits of Procol Harum, Austrian multi-instrumental didgeridooist Hermann Delago
    and the German trance band Emou.  From the soft-focused lightbulb heart overlooking a <i>120 Days of
    Sodom</i> orgy and a quote from 19th century naturalist-novel courtesan Josephine Mutzenbacher to a
    yodeling shout-out to Bertolt Brecht and a promotional photo of Ostermayer with a gun in his mouth,
    the old sod exhibits a facility for intelligent juxtapositions and imagistic layering.</p><p>
    
    The 47-year-old self-described ""romantic anarchist"" locates the sentimental aura surrounding a projected
    fuck-fest and sets it within a low-bit remake of ""Pale Blue Eyes"" by Bony M.  For the less triumphant,
    more downcast swells, Ostermayer is a brokenhearted, tear-in-his-Heineken Kurt Schwitters teaming with
    Burt Bacharach to commemorate a failed seduction (while reams of unclaimed dadaist love songs flit
    namelessly around town on flyers composed with half-eaten typography and gin-flavored bubblegum). His
    tenderly scatological originals, ethnic-sounding standards, Eastern European techno, and blissfully
    sodden versions of John Cale's ""Big White Cloud"" and Sparks' ""Angst in My Pants"" and ""Fun Bunch of
    Guys"" are the gaudiest of melodies sung over caustic, droning, growling backdrops.</p><p>
    
    Ostermayer's most successful remake is a heartfelt croon on the text of Nick Cave's version of ""Just a
    Closer Walk with Thee"". Ostermayer turns the gospel ballad into electronic Kraftwerk drama kept together
    with a nob-twisting pitch-shifter center. Really, the oddball Russian Gypsy dance groove implanted on
    Sparks and the drama-queen Cale aren't too shabby either. Otherwise, ""Ave Little Maria"" is as rousing a
    broken-angel drinking hymn as just about anything I've heard by The Pogues or on Tom Waits' <i>Closing
    Time</i>; Ostermayer's ability to wrap a tiny love song in such a garish coating of paint is something
    special. He lifts my pastel-hued spirits to the heavens while allowing my soiled mind to remain in the
    shit-caked gutter.</p><p>
    
    Though not everything reaches the heights of the sky-melting horns on ""Ave Little Maria"" or the twisted
    foolery of his best covers, with <i>Kitsch Concrete</i> I've definitely found that long-awaited missing
    link between <i>The Sound of Music</i> and Sado Masochism.</p></div>"|6087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6087-kitsch-concrete/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

    breathing and LaMonte Young's numbing minimalism, and sold the delirious result to us as Spacemen 3. In
    the 1990s, he continued his tasteful pilfering as the figurehead of Spiritualized-- on <i>Pure Phase</i>,
    he defined blissed-out noise-pop; on <i>Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space</i>, he lifted
    murky hedonism from Jim Dickinson and voodoo rites from Dr. John (who even guested on the record),
    building towers of song on a 50-piece orchestral foundation.  At its peak stood a full gospel choir,
    bellowing heartache and redemption.</p><p>
    
    This decade hasn't been quite as kind.  2001's <i>Let It Come Down</i>, the ridiculously anticipated
    follow-up to <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> which Pierce spent four years crafting, was at times musically
    and lyrically powerful, but rarely both at once.  And Pierce's decision to double the size of the
    Spiritualized Philharmonic failed to up the impact of his by-then-familiar post-breakup moaning,
    religious conviction, and continuing struggles with drug addiction.  Now, in 2003, it seems clear--
    even to Pierce-- that a change is necessary, and with <i>Amazing Grace</i>, he heads back to that
    motherly womb of rock 'n' roll: the garage.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, there are problems from the beginning: As Pierce's voice bleats through blaring feedback
    on the opening track, ""This Little Life of Mine"", there's an unfillable void in his recklessly delivered
    lyrics where the song's emotional core should lie.  His reconstituted band blazes, led by the bonfire-leads
    of guitarist Doggen (on loan from Brain Donor), but they also lurch in an almost sluggish manner that,
    push and pull as they might, never actually gets the lead out.</p><p>
    
    There are highlights: ""She Kissed Me (It Felt Like a Hit)"" (it owes to the similarly titled Spector-produced
    Crystals song in name only) is cut from the same patch of denim and black leather as ""This Little Life of
    Mine"", but more convincingly evokes the sneering garage aesthetic of The Troggs and early Kinks; ""Cheapster"",
    burning through a variation on ""Bob Dylan's 115th Dream"", brandishes switchblade-sharp chops; and ""Never
    Goin' Back"" proves Spiritualized can nail The Stooges shtick as well as any of the usurping mainstream
    garage rockers-- but no better.  Here, he replicates the bottled, melting scowl of Iggy circa the
    primordial <i>Funhouse</i>, but his imitation, like the kids he schools, is stripped of the necessary
    blood/cum combo needed to carry the shot through to the heart.</p><p>
    
    Of course, rock was never what Pierce did best: it's the strung-out ballads and slow, unfurling of studio
    sounds that's always carried his wasted messages to beatific, almost narcotic effect-- as such, ""Hold On""
    and ""Lord Let It Rain on Me"" serve as the linchpins of this record.  For its entire opening flourish, the
    former tames itself into a soft strum as Pierce implores you to ""hold on to those you hold dear.""  It's
    yet another demonstration of his ability to transcend limp Hallmark maxims through sheer will and
    conviction: he emotes no irony or bitterness, transforming simple truisms and cliches into heartbreaking
    revelations, much like Wayne Coyne observing that ""the sun don't go down"" in ""Do You Realize??""  And
    despite that the new <i>has</i> worn off this technique somewhat in the 20+ years Pierce has relied on
    it, in this moment it proves as effective as ever.</p><p>
<i>Amazing Grace</i> also manages some mildly interesting jazz flourishes. ""Rated X"" does about a minute's
    worth of Miles Davis' ""He Loved Him Madly"" before Pierce's weightless astronaut murmuring sends the song
    into the beckoning orchestral stratosphere, and ""The Power and the Glory"" features the record's most
    forward-looking moment, as it builds to a massive, cacophonous swell, aided by a horn section that puts
    British improv legends Kenny Wheeler and Evan Parker in front of their largest audience yet.</p><p>
    
    After that intriguing instrumental fury, however, Pierce marches his poor, abused gospel choir back into
    place with the solemn tom thuds and plaintive guitar strum of ""Lord Let It Rain on Me.""  Pieced together
    from at least four other Spiritualized songs, Pierce doles out more of his redemptive raindrops while
    ""looking down the barrel of a gun,"" before finally unleashing another predictably bombastic endorphin
    downpour.  Here, as with tracks like the banal ""The Ballad of Richie Lee"" and the repetitive, melodramatic
    closing lullaby ""Lay It Down Easy"", Pierce finally wears out his welcome, having utterly exhausted the
    possibilities of what can be accomplished within the limited constraints he's set for himself.</p><p>
    
    Pierce's ability to convey pain-- much like the recovering addict's ability to feel pleasure-- is all
    but lost among clusters of burnt-out receptors.  Even in its most inspired moments, <i>Amazing Grace</i>
    lacks the fiery intensity of any of Pierce's previous outings (including <i>Let It Come Down</i>).  Now,
    fervently praying to channel the uplift of true gospel and the Gnostic moments of the <i>Nuggets</i>
    era, J Spacemen is left, for the first time, sobbing at the pearly gates.</p></div>"|7422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7422-amazing-grace/|6.2|Andy Beta

Sure, convoluted meters, intricately
    layered guitar noise, and vintage synthesizers made of only fishing wire and toothpaste are nothing to
    scoff at.  But the essence of spaz has little to do with the aesthetic goodies that so often adorn it.
    And at the core ""spazcore"" lies a mixture of energy and humor that, when done right, can be just ridiculously
    infectious.  While countless forgotten bands have turned out generic garbage in hopes of hitting the big time
    and getting chicks, artists like Gary Wilson and Brainiac's Timmy Taylor seemed driven by an uncontrollable
    impulse to <i>not</i> look cool, tempered by a profound understanding of their own ridiculousness.</p><p>
    
    When Need New Body dropped their insane, fractured and brilliant debut in 2001, it was abundantly clear
    that they deserved a place in this esteemed tradition.  That album's centerpiece, the epic ""Gamble On/Banji""
    was not only one of my favorite songs of 2001, but one of maybe ten songs ever that invariably inspires me
    to jump around like a total jackass, regardless of social setting.  <i>UFO</i>, Need New Body's much
    anticipated sophomore effort, offers up both more variety and more focus than its predecessor, as the
    band plows through under-a-minute goofs and involved jams with equal conviction and care.</p><p>
    
    As with their debut record, Need New Body hardly decided to put their most accessible foot forward with
    <i>UFO</i>, opting instead to open with the distorted drums and seemingly random noise patterns of
    ""Giggle Bush Meets CompUSA"".  Just as the song disintegrates into hard-panned video game noises, in
    comes ""Hot Shot"", a standout track and a pretty good template for the more accessible side of the album.
    At their most basic level, these songs consist of the band playing a ""My Sharona"" bassline and banging on
    things, but what makes them so spectacular is the unchecked energy with which the band approaches them,
    fueled in no small part by Chris Powell's frenzied drumming.  <i>UFO</i> is a remarkably dense record,
    but even more remarkable is the fact that every single sound is integrated so masterfully into the
    framework of Powell's insistent 4/4 beats.</p><p>
    
    Need New Body achieve some of their greatest moments when the aforementioned beats are transformed into
    something loosely resembling a pop song.  ""Show Me Your Heart"" is equal parts video game soundtrack, spy
    theme, and banjo-driven klezmer jam.  Banjoist/emcee/""singer"" Jeff Bradbury may not be the most traditionally
    skilled vocalist, but he has a knack for rhythmic sing-speaking that perfectly complements the rest of the
    band.  Bradbury's contribution to live favorite ""Pen"", with its unforgettable chorus of ""Pen pen pen/
    Where's my pen,"" is not only hilarious, but lends the song yet another layer of rhythmic intensity.</p><p>
    
    There will always be artists who go through the motions of ""freaking out"" in the hopes of soliciting a
    few extra cheers at shows, or injecting some energy into an otherwise painfully dull record.  But Need

After developing a cult following in the underground
    with his <i>Language Arts</i> album series, some people may consider his second official record on Warner
    an attempt to discard his number and trade his U for an E.  While Buck has somewhat forsaken his hip-hop
    roots for a more introspective, folk-rock approach, he still stands as the very same watcher, the jagged
    nomad with stories, lessons and morals to bestow.</p><p>
    
    Once known for unfortunate album structure and ridiculously esoteric subject matter, Buck treats both
    cornerstones as old hat in the wake of a traditional 18-track-long observation of the facets of human
    nature. From a piercing portrayal of the aftermath of infidelity with his girlfriend (""Tired Out"") to
    a look at similarities to his father (""Roses and Bluejays"") to a tutorial on the classic art of
    shoe-shining (""Craftsmanship""), Buck 65 brings life out of all of his concepts, however simple.</p><p>
    
    One of the better examples of Buck's newfound propensity for more personal written works is ""Sore"", whose
    every verse serves as a testimonial to the problems in Rich Terfry's existence: he smashes his unreliable
    car, masturbates in a hotel room, and struggles with loneliness.  Though it strikes as an uncomfortable,
    off-kilter rhyme session, Buck's excellently descriptive writing style makes the track not only listenable
    but statements like ""phone don't work and God's at a staff meeting"" and ""I look at my photo albums and all
    I see is strangers"" also make it completely relatable.</p><p>
    
    The most important facet of Buck's first truly commercial endeavor is the inclusion of a continual
    thematic series of songs revolving around a single river. Treating each track as a conceptual goldmine,
    Buck describes the setting, stops attempted suicides, drowns by accident, falls in love with a girl with
    aquatic qualities, and experiences the power of a gun in a riverside town. But the mind-blowing ""Riverbed
    3"" creates a bevy of vivid characters, including ""the one-eyed cyclist who never wears any socks,"" a guy
    who ""wears two watches at one time"" and is ""not the best ventriloquist, but he wants to be,"" and ""Big fat
    Nigel who works as a florist,"" who is ""openly gay and he looks like a tourist."" Which all shines a light
    on Buck's greatest strength: character development.</p><p>
    
    Much like he's moved away from the more common rap topical states, Buck 65 has stopped producing, in the
    most basic manner of speaking. Instead of simply mining for samples like he once did, he now works with a
    band called the Savant Guard (taking samples from their instruments) and a production team called The
    Entity. The style isn't far from what most Buck fans will be used to, but it does lend the overall sound
    of the project a more personal, organic touch. From the murkily reverbed space-bass puddle stomp of
    ""Leftfielder"", to the upright bass-backed dub bounce of ""Sore"", to the gorgeously folky acoustic guitar
    crisscross of ""Tired Out"", Buck 65 has left his sloppy underground production for a more mature, refined
    look at the art of beatmaking.</p><p>
    
    The only downside to this vastly different project is the forced nature of his new persona. For an artist
    who started his career creating characters to rhyme under, he seems to have trouble adapting to his position
    of rappin' woodsman, even if it is closest to his real life. ""50 Gallon Drum"" comes off like Buck 65's
    overt self-portrait as the most eccentric emcee in the world, even if he told us this through his previous
    work without such a flamboyant representation. Saying that ""I like art made of garbage, a little pain is
    good for you"" and ""it's a shiny day and the dog shit smells like strawberries"" doesn't make me think ""what
    an interesting and weird recording artist""; It makes me think, ""How can you sound pretentious when trying
    to sound as earnest as possible?""</p><p>
    
    A few boring beats and some failed concepts crop up at points, but on the whole, Terfry has discovered a
    happy medium between folk and rap, turning his initial disdain for the lack of innovation in hip-hop into
    a more diverse sound.  You won't find the Sketch Artist or The Centaur here, but this is the same Buck 65,
    just slightly more grounded in reality.</p></div>"|1067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1067-talkin-honky-blues/|7.6|Rollie Pemberton

Do not reunite!  Please!  Think of all that you have to stay dead for: four legendary albums,     ever-strong legions of adoring hero-worshippers, and maybe the single most firmly entrenched reputation     in the history of alternative music!  Just consider it... it doesn't need to end this way...</p><p>But maybe it's no use; without even knowing for certain if the rumors of a supposed reunion will become     a reality (the band and label have neither confirmed nor denied our inquiries), it's almost a truism in     rock that matters of a band's sterling reputation inexorably descend to the lowest depths of the lowest     common denominator.  The worst part is that, with his latest misstep in the company of The Catholics,     <em>Show Me Your Tears</em>, it's hard to think that lowest common denominator isn't Black Francis himself,     sitting at the bottom of the barrel, waiting for the rest of the Pixies to finally arrive (Joey, as a     member of The Catholics, would seem to be a shoo-in).  It's bad enough that Frank Black can't seem to     work hard enough these days to encourage what little confidence his name still instills in the hearts and     minds of his few resolute followers; the Pixies shouldn't have to gently follow him into that good night,     too.</p><p>But there's no need to even bring the Pixies into the picture; the scene presented by reality-as-we-know-it     is grim enough.  Good ol' fashioned Catholic guilt ought to have set in on Black by now for coasting on the     fumes of his reputation in the baffling quest to reach some bland ideal of jangly, Midwestern shit-rock,     but no such luck.  He's still belting out bar-ballads for the type of bars he and his peer group are old     enough to frequent.  And there's no end in sight, either; any songwriter of Black's caliber could churn     out homogenized roots-riffs and schmaltzy sentiment to last call and beyond.  Heed the keen insight he     offers on ""Horrible Day"": ""It's a good day/ No, it's a horrible day/ And for the first time in my life     I just don't care.""  In the battle of Frank versus the bar, my money's on the bar, and Frank's is, too,     evidently; the next round's on him.</p>
<p>Now, it might be fair to suspect that I'm holding Frank to artistic standards that he never held for     himself.  First of all, even if that's true, why shouldn't we expect artists (in general) to perform to     their demonstrated ability rather than sincerely offering up pieces of the comfortable little rut that     they've been apathetically carving out over the past few years?  If it was just a question of failing to     live up to the Pixies, no one would need a review to predict the obvious, but it's so much worse than     that; paling in comparison to the Pixies is expected (and it would be unrealistic to expect otherwise),     but <em>Tears</em> isn't even a good Catholics album.</p>
<p>The excellent first half of <em>Pistolero</em>--     particularly the dazzling crescendo of ""Western Star""-- is everything that the Catholics can and ought to     be: rock as large, expansive, and over-romanticized (like right now) as the western skies hanging over     the rural-route honky-tonk dives whose atmosphere they so readily evoke.  Considering how little has     changed in their dusty, trail-worn aesthetic between then and now, the listless songs on this album     don't indicate maturation, or evolution of the band's sound, just lack of interest.</p>
<p>Only ""Everything Is New"" offers any sort of highlight by (not without some irony) most readily harkening     back to some of the pent-up energy and easy melody of earlier Catholics material.  It's comparatively     slight next to the blustery faux-rockers on <em>Tears</em>, and flatter than the cloying sentiment of the     more somber tunes, but that's because it may be the only track that doesn't need to compensate for the     simple desire that, in all other cases, just isn't there.  The elegance of the melody is superbly     understated; it doesn't seem like much at the time, but it does its work like any good pop song, and     you may well be humming it long after the final coda.  Even if there's little more to recommend, it's     better to light a candle than curse the darkness.  Still, it's the single, tiny bright spot on all of     <em>Show Me Your Tears</em>, almost insignificant in the long twilight of Frank Black &amp; The Catholics,     and it's getting pretty dark down at the bottom of the barrel.</p>

    albums in (check the title) have yet to make the dramatic change in their style that would pull in new
    listeners.  They aren't inept, amateurish or even exactly boring, but their parlor music takes a slow
    and emotionally neutral path that almost fights against engagement.</p><p>
    
    The typical Town and Country piece moves as painfully as old people crossing the street.  If you can't
    settle into it, you get frustrated thinking of all the things they don't do: they don't have the
    apocalyptic drama of the Constellation Records bands (e.g., Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say
    Think, Set Fire to Flames), and they also steer clear of the sentimental heartstring-tugs and
    old-sepia-toned filmstrips of, say, Rachel's.  Their long tones lack the primitive clarity of deep-listening
    music, and the arrangements pick up the subtlety and repetition of the minimalist composition, but they
    skip the rigor-- and rigidity-- of the academy for something more natural and less satisfying. To say
    they evoke Feldman, Reich or Messiaen is like saying the long-haired kid down the hall ""sounds like""
    Jimi Hendrix.</p><p>
    
    If nothing else, the album is beautiful.  The arrangements may sound like staid chamber music, but the
    fact that it's the same four people swapping off between these instruments-- horns here, strings there,
    harmonium, guitar and some unrecognizable whistles or percussion-- gives the album some vigor.  And
    you'll get plenty of time to contemplate the timbres of every instrument they use, because the pace
    is mostly laborious.  ""Aubergine"" and ""Old Fashioned"" follow an introduction/tension/resolution arc,
    but the melodies roll out so, damn, slowly that the tracks feel too long even at five or ten minutes
    (respectively).  When ""Lifestyled"" bursts in with a rattling, whistling flurry of action, it might
    finally grab your attention, but only for about half a minute, after which it settles into a shallow,
    meandering arrangement.</p><p>
    
    But some of the album's other moments offer a more engaging approach.  The opening track, ""Sleeping in
    the Midday Sun"", opens with sustained tones on strings and a horn, intense enough to leave a dent
    in your forehead before it segue to trance-like percussion led by a triangle.  On ""Nonstop Dancer"",
    what could have been another rote stretch of ambling, by-numbers post-rock finds a center of gravity
    in long, droning sounds.  And pulsing rhythms drive ""Shirtless"" into shifting patterns of percussion,
    sparking the record's most spontaneous playing.</p><p>
    
    Though Town and Country are far from the first band to take this path, the drones and hypnotic percussion
    fit their mission: they're naturalistic, evenly paced, and not distractingly complicated.  Instead of
    lulling you into simplicity, they excite you with it, focusing you into the buzzing center of their music.
    While there are plenty of bands doing better work with the same materials, Town and Country sound so
    committed in these moments-- so elated by what they're doing-- that you actually forget to want more from
    them.</p></div>"|8123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8123-5/|5.3|Chris Dahlen

    mean something different today than they once did.  Think of singers like Nina Simone, Roberta Flack
    or Joni Mitchell; their music had a way of seducing you, of lulling you into a world that would not
    otherwise be accessible.  And though it's no more difficult to locate soothing, evocative music today,
    musicians willing to approach that kind of nurturing grace are few and far between.</p><p>
    I guess it's not a coincidence that I chose three female artists as examples, though this rather maternal
    attribute in music isn't exclusively feminine-- Brian Wilson, particularly in ballads like ""In My Room"" or
    ""(Don't Talk) Put Your Head on My Shoulder"", had an incredible ability to tap into this realm, as did Nick
    Drake.  But there's a very thin line between a mature approach to this virtue and a twee one-- just ask
    Björk, Belle &amp; Sebastian, or Múm.  And when you're done with them, prepare a few questions for Manchester
    duo George, as they'll surely have something to say on the subject as well.</p><p>
    In the mid-90s, Suzy Mangion and Michael Varity were high school friends looking for a way to capitalize on
    their shared music collections and various instruments; their first release as George was a 1998 seven-inch
    titled ""The Summer of Stars"".  These days, the pair specialize in nocturnal folk that isn't far from the
    rustic eccentricities of Richard Youngs, though it possesses a much sweeter sense of melody (i.e., this
    isn't drone).  Mangion has a tender, expressive voice that reminds me of a young Joni Mitchell, though
    also of a calmer, older Kate Bush.  She lent her voice to Piano Magic's ""It's the Same Dream That Lasts
    All Night"" from 2001's <i>Writers Without Homes</i>, an album that almost perfectly exposed the difficulty
    in making mood music that didn't drift away upon the second listen.  Where many new folk groups are content
    to let spacy atmospherics do most of their work for them, George's songs come from a sturdier place, as if
    they'd missed out on the last 20 years and instead took all their lessons from Leonard Cohen and the slow
    songs from <i>White Album</i> Beatles.</p><p>
<i>The Magic Lantern</i> is George's debut full-length, and should appeal to most people down with the
    references already made.  It's lo-fi in places, and modestly experimental with plenty of interesting
    textures (the duo prefer an array of homemade electronics, analog synthesizers and archaic drum machines
    to software and laptops), but remains consistently, comfortably warm.  Mangion sings like the soloist in
    a country church: clear and optimistic, without any obviously borrowed nuance, and her quivering vibrato
    fills up the mix when doubled or tripled in harmony.  Multi-instrumentalist Varity also sings, but usually
    only in harmony, and employs a much less distinctive baritone when he does take the lead, as on the slightly
    off ""The Song the Lonely Heart Remembers"".</p><p>
    Opening with the brief ""Title Song"", featuring Mangion's deep harmony vocals over an old upright piano,
    and leading into the porch-lit shuffle of ""Sacramento"", <i>The Magic Lantern</i> wastes little time
    establishing George's way with a mood.  Mangion's lilting phrases in ""Sacramento"" sound like they should
    be coming from a particularly wistful Southern belle, embracing newfound fortune in the West while waving
    goodbye to an innocence already left behind.  ""Alone in the Country Heart"" uses the huff and puff of a
    train engine as its rhythmic base, kept low behind the murmur of Mangion's vocal.  As she laments the
    protagonist ""standing on the motorway, painting small clouds, counting all the cities,"" the song moves
    from minor to major and her melody hovers on one note, the engine underneath pressing onward.  When a
    small string ensemble enters later, what should be a jarring juxtaposition reveals itself as a remarkably
    poignant moment.</p><p>
    Distant, pagan impressions color much of <i>The Magic Lantern</i>, largely assisted by George's preference
    for acoustic arrangements and balladry that might well have been performed 100 years ago, unchanged.  ""The
    Track Through the Woods"" is a brooding, insistent torch song, also taking full advantage of the major/minor
    shifts in tone.  The plodding, muffled percussion provides what little support Mangion and Varity need to
    read through one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've heard in a while.</p><p>
    ""Bandstand"" drones on via antiquated church organ pedals and synth patches that haven't been heard outside
    of Wümme, Germany in 30 years.  Varity's harmony vocals might as well be another layer of synthesizers,
    such is the thick, surreal orchestra of reverb.  ""Slow Wave Sleep"" takes this idea further, blurring out
    any details you might have noticed had you been conscious at the time.  Mangion's vocals (""all is fine,
    all is well, and all can stay there for all I care, for all I care for is you"") sound piped in from another
    world entirely, as a <i>Pet Sounds</i>-esque hymnal organ creeps up behind.</p><p>
<i>The Magic Lantern</i> isn't the kind of record you drop on someone in the afternoon out of the blue.
    Truthfully, it drags in spots, and will certainly be ignored by anyone not in for some of that old
    graceful, nurturing spirit.  Still, it's hard to imagine many people hard enough that at least some of
    this wouldn't sink in under their armor.  In a time when music, downloads and the half-life of the
    average folk-pop group are short as a matter of practice, George are a pleasant, optimistic reminder
    of home.  A little night music?</p></div>"|3620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3620-the-magic-lantern/|8.2|Dominique Leone

Along its fenced banks lie the
    majority of the city's attractions.  Turner buildings, blossoming with neon network logos, lure Yellowjacket
    grads from the adjacent campus cluster with the sweet nectar of <i>Powerpuff Girls</i> money.  Across the
    way, The Varsity serves grease between buns, communicating with an enigmatic fast food lexicon that rivals
    rhyming Cockneys.  Tourists walk the overpass to the ghostly Olympic park, built on the graveyard of
    Techwood projects, in the shadows of Vick's pastel dome.  Hipsters and reluctant yuppies settle in the
    gentrified Five Points and Cabbagetown, giving their quaint subdivisions more verdant ""___________ Park""
    monikers.  And finally, there's Turner Field, reverberating collective October sighs, before the highway
    splits back into its tributaries in East Point, the cultural fountainhead.  The hip-hop id to New York's
    ego: the home of Outkast.</p><p>
    
    Lauded retroactively in 2000, upon the release of <i>Stankonia</i>, for a formula that had been perfected
    by teenagers on 1994's <i>Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</i>, Outkast charged up the public with silly
    amounts of reserved anticipation for this double-disc marathon.  Since dropping that debut nearly ten
    years ago, Outkast's singles have charted a steady incline of genre-defiance and pop virtuosity.  But
    now, in the wake of the commercial and critical smash that yielded such classic tracks as ""Ms. Jackson"",
    ""B.O.B."", and ""So Fresh, So Clean"", Big Boi and Andre 3000 have, for the first time, chosen to work in
    separate corners, like Beatles after India.  Here, on the resulting <i>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</i>,
    the two wander down the blacktop from East Point, each plotting their own distinct course: Andre, like
    I-85, shoots off to the airport and sky-high trips before dipping into the Mardi Gras marshes of New
    Orleans, while Big Boi rolls deep down I-75 into south Florida, home of booty bass and baby blue.</p><p>
    
    The consensus in rock circles had unfairly anticipated that <i>The Love Below</i> would reign supreme
    over Big Boi's <i>Speakerboxxx</i>, since Andre was the one with the guitar in the fuzzy boots.  As it
    turns out, his Prince-mimicking fusion looks a lot better on paper than it sounds in your ears.  On too
    many songs, Andre repeats space-playboy choruses over repetitious, unfinished digifunk.  As the brief
    orchestrated outro to ""Pink and Blue"" suggests, each track feels like it's missing something-- strings,
    guitars, harmonies, organic instruments, and, oh right: Big Boi.  Andre does have his moment, though:
    ""Hey Ya!"" glitters and towers like the silver Westin hotel over an 80s Atlanta skyline, blending Flaming
    Lips-like synth-bass and ebullient acoustic guitar with the rebellious joy of ""Little Red Corvette""--
    and like all classic songs, it introduces new vernacular with a genius that transcends product placement.
    Even indymedia.org feeders will shout ""Polaroid!"" while miming spanking at this fall's Not-Dog cookouts.</p><p>
    
    Of the few other tracks on <i>The Love Below</i> that come close to reaching ""Hey Ya!""'s apex, the one
    that most succeeds is ""Spread"", which showcases trumpets and piano weaving through a rubber bassline and
    scattering rimshots.  Its chorus has Andre putting on his Camille voice, while the verses contain some of
    the only moments on the album in which he actually flows.  When he does, he's tight enough to pose the
    question of why he decided to cut back on rapping at all-- particularly since, frankly, he ranks just
    above Pharrell Williams on the ""brilliant but mosquito-throated crooner"" list.  Elsewhere, the quite
    literal ""Dracula's Wedding"" boasts guest vocalist Kelis over whistling squelches, while Norah Jones'
    lovely turn on the acoustic ""Take Off Your Cool"" hints at the true stylistic breadth Andre is capable of
    achieving.  ""Baby, take off your cool/ I want to get to know you,"" they both sing over plucks and strums.
    Heed your lyrics, Andre.  (Except for that ""become the master of your own bastion"" nonsense.)</p><p>
    
    Big Boi's <i>Speakerboxxx</i> coolly upstages its counterpart: Although it, too, provides the world with
    one earthshaking single, it differs from <i>The Love Below</i> in that it also manages to maintain a
    consistent level of brilliance and emotional complexity.  Here, Big Boi effectively asserts himself as
    man who wants both a stripper pole in his home and his nostalgic place saved on the pew-- ""Unhappy""
    conveys that in its beat alone!  Comparing the selection of <i>Speakerboxxx</i> to Andre's limper <i>Love
    Below</i>, it's clear who won this bet: Machine-heavy, horn-driven funk stomps behind ""Bowtie"" and ""The
    Rooster""; reverberating woodblocks (a trademark Outkast signifier since ""Elevators"") starkly soundtrack
    pondering rhymes on ""Knowing""; ""Church"" takes gospel into the 21st Century, accelerating aluminum Stevie
    Wonder disco-pop into Teutonic techno; propulsive kickdrums pump under drunken guitars, scratches, and a
    Jay-Z hook on the standout ""Flip Flop Rock""; and ""Ghettomusick"", the aforementioned earthshaking single,
    is, emotionally, a celebration and a lament, braggadocio and beatitudes.  Musically, the record shifts
    from punk-cadenced, cellulite-quivering woofer booms to three-wheeled slow-jams and back before
    snake-charming with George Clinton keyboards.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there's one department in which neither disc succeeds: Despite how forward-looking these albums
    can be, both members have failed to envision a future <i>without skits and intros</i>, which make up no
    less than ten of the 39 tracks here.  It's one reason why <i>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</i>, like no
    albums before, beg to be ripped, sieved and re-sequenced.  Cutting out the dialog, along with <i>The Love
    Below</i>'s silicon-smooth, <i>Rainbow Children</i>-esque jazz and lulling middle-section, and Big Boi's
    guest-laden, been-there street tracks, leaves one genius full-length that fits on a single disc.</p></div>"|11796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/|8.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

Depending on whom you ask, they can be desperate Warhol-wannabes,
    punk rock heroes, meatheaded geniuses, fey performance artists, and the greatest American band of all

    and harmonies of early 60s power-pop with exuberant, metalhead ferocity, pounding out fast, lovable punk
    songs and making black leather jackets forever badass.  <i>NYC 1978</i> is the Ramones properly recalled,
    long before the half-hearted Lollapalooza tour and lifeless <i>Adios Amigos</i>, back when they were still
    teeming with wild, youth-at-play adrenaline.  Because even though twenty-five years have passed since the
    Ramones recorded <i>NYC 1978</i>, they're still the best worst band ever.</p><p>
    
    2003: The dirty, shame-faced admission that seems to float, unspoken, between contemporary punkers is that
    all of the Ramones' songs sound (whisper now) pretty much the same.  But while it's hard to wholeheartedly
    welcome the legions of blank-faced, black-jeaned followers who have since embraced the band's, um, pithy
    songwriting philosophy, there's still something awfully charming about the Ramones' particular brand of
    redundancy-- mostly because the Ramones themselves don't seem so in on the joke.  <i>NYC 1978</i> crams
    27 three-chord songs into 52 minutes (no freewheeling guitar solos, no guest players, and not a whole lot
    of witty rambling), the band all the while remaining seemingly unaware of a pacing that sounds, at least
    to 21st century ears, entirely absurd.</p><p>
    
    To amplify the inherent preposterousness of <i>NYC 1978</i>, check what they don't tell you on the cover:
    It was recorded on January 7th, 1978, exactly seven days after the 1977-78 New Years' Eve show in London
    that later became the Ramones' other seminal live release, <i>It's Alive</i>.  The real kick in the pants
    is that the tracklists for the two records are almost identical, save the one additional cut which sneaked
    onto <i>It's Alive</i> (the probable ""Judy Is a Punk""-- which, incidentally, is not so thematically different
    from ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker"" or ""Suzy Is a Headbanger"").  Both albums plow through what are arguably the
    Ramones' greatest hits (showcasing some of their last work with Tommy on drums), culled from their first
    three history-booked records, 1976's <i>Ramones</i> and 1977's <i>Leave Home</i> and <i>Rocket to Russia</i>.
    You know what to expect: the fist-pumping twist of ""Blitzkrieg Bop"", the dumb, sing-along fun of ""Rockaway
    Beach"", loads of simple, thrilling guitar crushes, and Dee Dee hollering as many 1-2-3-4 countdowns as he
    can choke out.</p><p>
    
    If you already own <i>It's Alive</i> (and you should), know that <i>NYC 1978</i> is exactly the same songs,
    played in the same way, in the same order, by the same four people.  Completists could point out some
    quibbles (Johnny's guitar seems to wander out of tune far more often on <i>NYC</i> than it did on <i>It's
    Alive</i>, and <i>It's Alive</i> was mixed by Tommy Ramone himself, whereas the comparably anonymous Glen
    Robinson mans the boards here), but the Ramones weren't exactly renowned for unforeseen live explosions,
    and for the most part, the only palpable difference between these two shows are their respective locales.</p><p>
    
    But when the location in question is the pre-gentrification east side (the Palladium on 14th Street), and
    the band is the Ramones, setting suddenly becomes a lot more relevant than you'd think.  The effects are
    subtle, and mostly peripheral-- the deepness of the hollers, the frenzy of the applause, the slightly
    nervous, beginning-of-the-end toe-tapping.  So even if <i>NYC 1978</i> ends up being one of the least
    essential Ramones releases of recent years, it still deserves credit for placing the band back in the belly
    of the only city that could have ever spawned them.</p></div>"|6681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6681-nyc-1978/|7.3|Amanda Petrusich

    take a couple of <i>Nuggets</i>-style box sets to do it justice.  From Mouse and Mars and Oval through
    today, German artists and German labels such as Basic Channel, Tresor, Force Tracks, Mille Plateaux, Morr
    Music, Studio !K7, Kompakt, Bpitch Control, Perlon, Shitkatapult, Poker Flat Recordings, and Playhouse,
    among many others, have produced an uncanny amount of excellent electronic music. On this fictional
    compilation, Sascha Funke would be well represented by his lovely, plangent ""Drei Auf Drei"", his cover
    of Bros' ""When Will I Be Famous"", and ""Now You Know"", the opening track on his debut album, <i>Bravo</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""Now You Know"" is an almost improbably gorgeous track, a brittle, bittersweet tech-house beauty that sounds
    soul-enriching even as its enveloping layers of analog synth, arpeggiated guitar, and staccato beats are
    whittled down, peeled away like an onion until Funke's plangent, fragile voice is exposed. Previously
    released on the <i>Funkt</i> 12-inch, it's not only thankfully included here but-- along with the record's
    other previously released track, ""Forms and Shapes""-- sets its tone and works as its sonic blueprint.</p><p>
    
    Much of the rest of the largely cohesive <i>Bravo</i> uses those two tracks as a jumping-off point. It
    splits the difference between Funke's two labels (Cologne's Kompakt and Berlin's Bpitch Control), taking
    the warmth of the former and the crisp, sharp beats of the latter, and oddly adding a large splash of
    borderline MOR sentimentality. Within this seemingly confining set of templates, Funke squeezes a
    surprising range of sounds, from the digital disco of vocal track ""Forms and Shapes"", to the almost
    Underworld-esque progressive house of the title track, to the quivering clicks of ""Soso"", a Notwist-like
    track that just begs for a Markus Acher vocal.</p><p>
    
    When Funke veers into ambient pop-- as he does in much of the record's final third, starting with the
    self-explanatory ""Quiet Please""-- <i>Bravo</i> sometimes slides into more murky, less interesting territory,
    rescued only by the odd, minimalist charm of ""3 zu 1 fur die Liebe"" and percolating closer ""Hallo and
    Hurra"".  But despite the occasional middling, soggy production, <i>Bravo</i> shows Funke deftly combining
    his yin and yang, creating an almost autumnal album full of brisk, soft numbers. How do you say ""sweater
    weather"" in German?</p></div>"|3270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3270-bravo/|7.9|Scott Plagenhoef

Back in the early 90s, I think most of
    us expected The Orb to reign victorious in all the wars it would ever fight against or amongst electronic
    music's endless subgenres.  <i>Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld</i> and <i>U.F. Orb</i> were, after all,
    masterpieces suggestive of classic Pink Floyd and Eno.  But, as with all great battles (Catholics and
    Protestants, North and South, Betamax and Sony), the Squares won out. Rather than ushering in a perpetually
    expanding and pulsating sphere of psycho-dub vacillations, time gave way to Plaid freeform, Autechrean
    architecture, and Squarepushing.</p><p>
    So, upon first listen, <i>Bicycles &amp; Tricycles</i> seemed instantly seductive with its harrowingly
    anachronistic synth washes, four-on-the-floor dub, quotes from those BBC Fairy Tale Hour shows, and the
    interstellar mind-freezes. However, on the third or fourth listen, I realized I didn't exactly like the
    songs as much as I liked the idea of someone making them.  My relationship to The Orb is a lot like my
    relationship to Beyoncé or Willie Nelson. I don't know that I particularly like what they're doing, but
    I'm glad someone is doing it.</p><p>
    The Orb seems to understand this. The first moments of ""From a Distance"" consist of the rooster from
    ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" struggling to avoid getting buried under distortion and destruction. A voice
    screams, ""A new morning!"" and proceeds to vitriolically spit out one of the most spellbindingly silly
    ragga teen-pop tunes to ever be so throttled with foghorns. It's a damn effective tactic, as startling
    as when De La Soul killed themselves or, hell, as Dylan going electric. Of course, it also borders on
    novelty, turning into one of those things you hear on British pop charts (Fast Food Rockers, anyone?)
    that makes you wonder, ""How is this place still a country?""</p><p>
    Whether it's actually any good or not, there's nothing else remotely like it on the album-- which we can
    be thankful for, because if the music of ""From a Distance"" was sustained for an hour, migraines would be
    as prevalent as original sin. The following track, ""The Land of Green Ginger"", is traditional Orb, rushing
    waves and audio excerpts from books-on-tape. Between tape loops and whittling, the drum machine sounds as
    if it's been buried in gravel. It's 80s techno to the point of self-delusion. ""Hell's Kitchen"" and ""Gee
    Strings"" are stunning Orb epics (basically what you would buy any Orb album for), flaunting vaguely Indian
    percussion that drips bongwater.</p><p>
    If you've ever enjoyed an Orb song, there's no possible way you could be entirely disappointed by this
    album. It's resolutely affixed to the past, and while it's not nearly as liberal in its portions of
    psychedelic ambiance as their greatest works, it's at least par with <i>Cydonia</i>. I had a blast
    listening to it. I'll probably even listen to it after I finish writing this-- something I can hardly
    say about a lot of my favorite albums. But even when it's making raves out of paranoia, it feels like
    The Orb are trapped in a fading genre that gains its adherents through nostalgia rather than innovation.
    Long and painful deaths have never been this much fun.</p></div>"|6027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6027-bicycles-tricycles/|6.5|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

You have a vision.  You're not like everyone else, no; you
    always follow through, you go the extra mile, you tip the extra dollar.  You have goals.  You have pride.
    You analyze, plan, and apply.  You have faith.  You stick to your guns and never let words hurt you.
    You're an excellent listener and you can always keep a secret.  Nothing can touch you.  Hell, you've
    pretty much got it all figured out.  And then one day, out of the blue, a switch is flipped; life hands
    you your ass and you discover you're just as vulnerable and incompetent as the guy who used to live
    above you who ate cigarettes at every meal and twice trapped and tried to ransom a neighborhood dog
    for rent money.</p><p>
    Why?  Because even if you live in a bubble reciting Bible verses, wearing a Kevlar vest and an oxygen
    mask inside a bomb shelter beneath the Pentagon, there's still something to which you'll never be immune:
    man's inherent fallibility.  The moment Eve handed Adam that apple we were screwed.  Now all it takes is
    a little push and we're on our way, no matter how straight a line we walk.  We're all born into paradise
    (some of us stay longer than others), and whether the process is gradual or instantaneous, change is
    imminent.  Nothing lasts forever.  With <i>Yoko</i>, change has come, and come swiftly, for better and
    for worse.  Thus, with final product in hand and half an apple missing, the question presents itself:
    So what's her name?</p><p>
    Perhaps I'd be better served asking the question again in the plural, as nearly every member of Beulah is
    said to have parted ways with wives or long-time girlfriends since the recording of their last album
    (including the third of the group involved in a lineup change), but the query is nonetheless justified.
    Since 1997, over the course of three albums, Beulah have unabashedly offered up a congruous library of
    sunny, debonair guitar-pop.  Employing trademark sanguine arrangements of horns, strings and woodwinds,
    the tone was at best ironic, sometimes paradoxically sentimental, but always uplifting, impulsive and
    fresh-faced.  No more.  <i>Yoko</i> is a wash of sentiment, desire, and emotional fragility, and it's
    the first determined step outside of the band's garden of lush, fertile pop-craftsmanship.</p><p>
    Look no further than to the barren, minimalist cover work, where previously there existed nods to serene,
    natural elements.  Check the album title.  Acronym for the third track (""You're Only King Once"") or not,
    gender relations are suspect.  To be fair, I'd be remiss not to admit a share of artistic reinvention into
    the mix, but <i>Yoko</i> represents a shift in consciousness that so enticingly mirrors post-Lapsarian
    change, it's impossible to resist.</p><p>
    To begin, the songs exude a newly developed arresting self-consciousness. Everything is tentative and
    intricately wrought, perhaps in an overly accommodating response to fears of linearity.  This fashionable
    awareness lends an almost palpable weight to the sound.  It succeeds in adding depth and texture to the
    album, but sometimes overshoots the mark.  With a clichéd garage-rock dynamic at its heart, ""My Side of
    the City"" caters directly to the Spoon-fed rock chic, while ""Landslide Baby"" exhibits a lack of restraint
    with its misplaced bridge delivery of ""'Cause you're scared and you're weak and you don't give a fuck about
    me/ And I do believe that you hate yourself.""  Essentially, Beulah just try too hard and lack moderation
    in their extremes.  Nearly every song feels like the band is carefully exercising a right of indulgence.</p><p>
    Lyrically, <i>Yoko</i> is permeated with cynicism, a telltale sign of mortality.  Emotionally, currents of
    romantic melancholy and cynical disenchantment run throughout.  Lead singer Miles Kurosky yearns and
    languishes, implores and informs.  ""Standing alone at the gate/ She's late/ She's miles above,"" from
    ""Hovering"", and similar revelations, pepper the album with a pleading despondency-- but one that's executed
    without any sense of spontaneity. ""Fooled with the Wrong Guy"" draws the connection between maudlin and
    mandolin, but misses the mark by turns too Travis and is bogged down with excess lethargy.  It's one of
    several moments where Beulah actually mope.</p><p>
    Some songs, however, run the gauntlet and emerge with more character and confidence. ""A Man Like Me"", the
    opening cut, initially sounds like a sullen, purebred Spoon/Beulah alloy, as do a teeming handful of
    moments here, with Kurosky taking on a more moody, jaded vocal approach before choppy guitar cuts in
    over spacious keys and indie-thrift bass.  From there, the song jumps up and down, restless and unwieldy,
    showcasing one of the album's finest melodies and succeeding despite such a calculated dynamic.</p><p>
    A hefty portion of <i>Yoko</i>'s fortunes could rightfully be attributed to the flawless production.
    Without horns and hoards of background melody, a few songs are given room to wander within the sonic
    landscape.  Intro and outro arrangements a la <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> permeate the record, adding
    texture.  Especially representative of this is the closing track, ""Wipe Those Prints and Run"", which
    teases, taunts, and stands its ground where previous Beulah tracks would officiously cater to the
    listener.  The new textures serve the band's sound accordingly, and enable them to explore new
    compositional directions while retaining a degree of continuity earlier albums missed.  The band
    navigates a maze of intent amidst this freedom of motion, and for at least a moment in each song,
    they stumble onto something enlightening-- something familiar, something classifiably Beulah.</p><p>
    Mortally self-conscious, repentant and quixotic, <i>Yoko</i> has a vision.  Instead of a full-out rollicking,
    springy affair, they offer a sinusoidal ride through sentiment-- their first.  At its heart, this record is
    a statement of regret with a bleak view of redemption, but its grand tone hints at something more universal,
    and opens up an endless landscape of possibility.  Sometimes change is good-- that is, so long as it's still
    open to change.</p></div>"|677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/677-yoko/|6.8|William Morris

I remember the summer our love first bloomed, when a gaggle of UK melody slingers
    and guitar tinkerers saved me from the drooping cul de sac of my classic rock phase.  I'd been ensconced in
    false notions of the categorical inferiority of new music for years, but just before I sank low enough to
    actually purchase a Black Oak Arkansas album, I unexpectedly became exposed to Pulp, Radiohead, and The
    Stone Roses, and I emerged changed, open to just about anything new.  For a few years, the filters were off--
    anything that had even the faintest ring of Britpop to it was devoured regardless of its quality, until
    Britpop became a cul de sac itself.  Looking back, I'm not sure how a band like Menswe@r didn't send the
    hazard lights blinking, but needless to say, distance provides objectivity, and I'm to the point where an
    album's mere Britishness is hardly enough for it to win me over.</p><p>
    
    I mention all this because <i>With the Tides</i>, the sophomore offering from UK trio South, is exactly the
    kind of album I would have blindly adored just a few years ago.  Not that I've necessarily wizened with age,
    but I'm certainly more cynical, and it's about time we got around to admitting that it's every music fan's
    right to be jaded.  South make what you could probably get away with labeling ""post-Britpop.""  The elements
    are pretty much the same-- strong, tenor-sung melodies, ringing guitars, and concise songwriting-- but
    they're also tossed with a salad of keyboard-based textures and electronic flourishes befitting a post-IDM
    world.  Mo'Wax labelhead James Lavelle produced this band's 2001 debut, <i>From Here on In</i>, but that
    album was unfortunately a bit of a blur, with only a song or two that could be counted as highlights.</p><p>
    
    This time out, the band hooks up with Dave Eringa, generally a Rock Guy responsible for the boardwork for
    such notables as Manic Street Preachers, Idlewild, and Ash (not to mention Kylie Minogue), and it shows
    immediately.  The textural elements that defined their debut, while still omnipresent, are toned back a
    bit to let Jamie McDonald's sturdy vocals have the spotlight, and the drums are punchy as hell.  But is
    it enough?  Sort of.  When South bring their best songs to the table, it bangs, but there are still a few
    lines of featureless grout in between the colorful tiles.</p><p>
    
    They hit biggest out of the gate, as opener ""Motiveless Crime"" is a rush of are-they-strings-or-keyboards
    atmospherics, driving rhythm and well-baited hooks.  The heart of the album's sequencing is productive,
    too, with its three most diverse tracks coming in quick succession.  ""Fragile Day"" opens as a bobbing hymn,
    soaked in drifting ambience, slowly building on a skeletal beat, finally climaxing with a harmony-soaked
    chorus and a pummeling epilogue that nicely sets up ""Nine Lives"", a quiet song from a darkened room
    supported almost solely by cello and harp (and lots of reverb).  ""Same Old Story"" rebounds with an
    insistent bassline, spry drumming and the same ascendant guitars that put the glow in Doves' <i>Lost
    Souls</i>.</p><p>
    
    At its height, Britpop produced an enormous crop of great sprinters, but only a couple of true long-distance
    runners, and South certainly fall into the former camp, able to drop a great song seemingly at will, but
    struggling to maintain variety and consistency.  About the boldest thing that South could do at this point
    to help diversify their albums would be to step out from behind the blanket of texture they've wrapped
    themselves in, and simply let their craft work for itself.  While that seems unlikely, what South has
    now is slowly coming into sharper focus, and though it's no masterpiece, <i>With the Tides</i> is certainly
    a good record.  At the very least it should ease your Britpop jones better than Menswe@r.</p></div>"|7380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7380-with-the-tides/|7.3|Joe Tangari

The singular consumption of a mouthful sized arrangement of food composed
    exclusively of each distinct, fundamental ingredient of a select recipe.</p><p>
    
    As in, mid-meal (directly after each curious female at my table abruptly loses interest in her own
    selection), from my Cobb Salad; a leaf each of iceberg and romaine lettuce, a piece each of bacon and
    chicken, a diced tomato cube, a bit off egg, a single scallion, a crumb of Roquefort cheese, and just
    a touch of dressing. Now, I don't want to incite a debate on gender scripting, but it's been my experience
    that girls happen to love the perfect bite.  My sister loves the perfect bite.  Swears by it.  I hate the
    perfect bite.  It obviates randomness and strangles variety.  Also, it ruins my meal.</p><p>
    
    This three-song offering is Azure Ray's perfect bite, the shortest and most accurate response to the
    question: What do they sound like?  Omaha-by-way-of-Athens duo Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor again hit
    the studio with Eric Bachmann (Crooked Fingers, Archers of Loaf) as producer, in efforts towards their
    upcoming full-length <i>Hold on Love</i>, which promises a slightly new recipe for their sound.  For the
    EP, however, we're treated to more of the intimate, downtempo, serene moments the ladies have wrought
    since inception.</p><p>
    
    ""The Drinks We Drank Last Night"" is pulled directly from the new album, and could certainly find a home
    on last year's <i>Burn &amp; Shiver</i>.  The formula remains true to the original blueprint of the duo's
    sound. Slowly undulating and understated ambience coupled with signature gentle acoustic picking set
    in before quietly retreating below the effortless hush of the duo's vocals.  With the flawless production
    at hand the vocals take on an even more tranquil quality than previous offerings, just begging to grace
    a pair of headphones.  In fact, the subtle variations in vocal renderings between the three songs are the
    only true variants within the album, which follows logically given no-one has any misconceptions about
    where Azure Ray's bread is buttered.</p><p>
    
    ""The Love of Two"", the only non-album track, is the most atmospheric, as well as most memorable.  An
    incessant vinyl scratch murmurs beneath a subtle vocal tonality reminiscent of Mazzy Star, which, distant
    and haunted, provides an excellent equipoise to the visceral production.  A ""Bleed Version"" of the
    album-inclusive ""We Are Mice"" rounds out the disc with sparse piano backing and choral vocals that I
    swear could only be described as uncannily Sarah McLachlan-esque.  There are no true departures to be
    found, merely minor tweaking. Unfortunately, the lyrics still read a bit much like Felicity's diary,
    but such a regrettable lyrical acumen can easily be overlooked; this music is tactile at heart. If
    the duo can simply up the cerebral factor and maybe add a little spice to the mix, a real statement
    could be served up.</p></div>"|398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/398-the-drinks-we-drank-last-night-ep/|6.0|William Morris

    and Southern gospel, Toronto's Deadly Snakes have obviously spent the last few years scrounging around for
    more than just a ballsy album title.  The band's classics-bin pinching has led to some magnificent ends:
    on <i>Ode to Joy</i>, the Snakes' third release, they've broken down and reassembled a century's worth of
    musical output, and miraculously, emerged with something that sounds entirely, heartbreakingly relevant.</p><p>
    
    With all its wailing horns, weed-tinged organs, slammed guitars and throwdown vocals, <i>Ode to Joy</i> is,
    in a lot of ways, exactly what makes the 21st century such a potentially great time for rock music.  It's
    a record that confirms, without getting excessively contemplative or buzzkill-cerebral, that synthesizing
    all the tunes and styles contemporary artists have at their disposal can actually be an inspired endeavor--
    especially when you incorporate a hearty shot of ingenuity and some kicky Canuck spunk.  Still, influence/inspiration
    theories aside, it would be unfair not to acknowledge that there's a little bit of love buried in here,
    too.</p><p>
    
    Because ultimately, it's the Snakes' earnest (and somehow palpable) appreciation for the work of their
    forefathers that makes <i>Ode to Joy</i>'s overstated lineage so tolerable.  Just imagine six kids getting
    so sincerely riled up about their respective record collections that they were left with no choice but to
    join forces and actually follow through on the wild, heart-in-throat urges we've all had to just squish
    every record worth loving into one big, satisfying ball of sound.  And then to run around as fast as
    possible, clutching that craggy conglomeration tightly to our chests, breathing hard.  And then to name
    that thing <i>Ode to Joy</i>.</p><p>
    
    But before you get too misty-eyed, remember that <i>Ode to Joy</i> is also an explosive, knee-bending kick
    in the pants, and that the record comes with its fair share of fiendish snickering and behind-your-back
    finger-pointing.  The Snakes' wide-ranging influences might make <i>Ode to Joy</i> stylistically
    unpredictable, but it's far from disjointed; rather, the record follows its own kind of in-joke logic,
    and, expectedly, the Snakes' private schematic includes a healthy dose of impish rollick.   Happily,
    <i>Ode to Joy</i> has the sort of mischievous swagger that, unlike some of the band's ""garage rock
    revival"" peers, is a little bit off-balance, far more playful than patronizing.  And it's that roguish
    spirit that unites these tracks into a glorious whole.</p><p>
    
    Appropriately, there's no awkward throat clearing-- <i>Ode to Joy</i> blows right open on ""Closed Casket"",
    a loud, freewheeling assault that sees vocalist Andre Ethier bravely slamming down words and grunts with
    a seething, bang-it-out syntax that captures, almost perfectly, Dylan's thick ""Subterranean Homesick Blues""
    ramble.  It's a curious choice for an opener, because Ethier sounds so stupidly similar to Dylan that,
    inevitably, some people are just gonna snicker, roll their eyes and walk away-- unless, of course,
    they've already been sold by the boisterous bluster of his five able bandmates, who crank out rowdy,
    foot-stomping drum beats (the impressive Andrew Gunn behind the kit), jangly piano lines, and rough,
    garage-punk guitar riffs.</p><p>
    
    Another highlight, ""Oh My Bride"" sees that same spirit applied to an otherwise traditional gospel cut,
    with only guitar, handclaps, and some soulful, listen-up hollering, while ""Burn Down the Valley"" uses
    the Snakes' fervor to harness the creepier side of an organ, mixing dark, rolling lines with back and
    forth vocals, spreading it all out over a bass-heavy, nightmarish stew.  The Deadly Snakes are that
    rarest of bands whose approach to rock 'n' roll is not only fierce and dynamic, but also fueled by
    an insatiable passion, and yet <i>Ode to Joy</i> has been criminally overlooked for most of the spring
    and summer-- mostly for lack of a solid publicity team.  But records like <i>Ode to Joy</i> can't be
    held back, and lately, there's been a rumble underground.  Right now, it's seeming increasingly unlikely
    that it could go unnoticed any longer-- it's just that good.</p></div>"|2519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2519-ode-to-joy/|8.5|Amanda Petrusich

Post-rock, on the other hand, is barely post-pubescent,     so there's still lots of time for snarking around-- and no one seems to have a better grasp of this than     the Canadian post-rock collectives, who consistently release records under completely ridiculous names.</p>
<p>Enter Silver Mt. Zion, who, guest players and fancy accoutrements aside, are essentially a Montreal-based     sextet fronted by Godspeed You! Black Emperor's brooding brainchild, Efrim Menuck.  Both of Efrim's gigs     boast spacious, classical-meets-post-rock sounds (not to mention a proclivity for fiendishly irrelevant     identity crises), but there are no shifting exclamation points here-- <i>this</i> one's gimmick is the     bandname that expands with each release.  Debuting as the relatively modest A Silver Mt. Zion, 2001's     <i>Born into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward</i> had them billed as the more epic-sounding The Silver Mt.     Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band.  And this time out they've been generous enough to grace us     ""With Choir,"" too.  The contrivances, of course, goes a little deeper than that, and while <i>This is Our     Punk Rock, Thee Rusted Satellites Gather + Sing</i> may not be quite as concept-heavy as something like     <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, it nonetheless comes with a pointed, non-musical agenda.</p>
<p>Silver Mt. Zion's brand of ""punk rock"" is, in a sense, just that: ideologically driven protest music     designed to raise a big fat finger at established social and cultural norms.  But don't go getting all     pogo-primed-- this is cerebral shit, less concerned with getting you to strap on black boots than encouraging     you to boycott Wal-Mart and locate alternative news sources.  The underlying concept of the record is heady,     but not too different from what (the comparably lucid) Conor Oberst was hollering about on Desaparacidos'     <i>Read Music/Speak Spanish</i>: lashing out against the impending threat of unregulated urban landscapes,     sprawling bigbox superstores, and governmental mismanagement.  Unlike Oberst, though, Silver Mt. Zion think     globally, and this album also contains jabs at western imperialism, piggish entitlement, and ethically     questionable military occupations.</p>
<p>For the most part, the band employs more subtle means of communicating their message than plain old lyrics:     <i>This is Our Punk Rock</i> mainly consists of swooping strings, hollowed chanting, and found sounds     arranged into big orchestral and choral sequences.  Opener ""Sow Some Lonesome Corner So Many Flowers Bloom""     features a swoon-and-break structure that resurfaces on the album again and again: these songs are far from     formulaic, but they occasionally mimic each other's movements-- multi-layered vocals bleed into orchestral     recesses, which shift into silence and then into noise.</p>
<p>One very notable difference between this and other Silver Mt. Zion records is that it sees Efrim's quivering     pipes just as active as his guitar-screwdrivering hands.  And he's not the only one treating us to high-pitched,     deliberately off-key warbling; this is where the questionable stylings of that ""full amateur choir"" come     into play.  All these unnecessary (and aggressively shrill) vocal contributions can quickly become grating,     especially when they interfere with the impressive instrumentation.  In a way, this contrast makes sense:     Silver Mt. Zion seem to intend these songs to be heard and perceived as angry or defiant, but it's difficult     to get around their inherent beauty.  The tension between the delicacy and the outrage (or between the     strings and the vocals) has potential to be unbelievably compelling-- it's just that its implementation     here is usually far more distracting than enlightening.  Consequently, the relative success of <i>This is     Our Punk Rock</i> is hard to quantify in any unilateral way; it relies heavily on user participation, and     the quality of that exchange is inextricably linked to how much time and patience a given listener has     available on the day they pick up this record and drag it back home.</p>
<p>Making thematically (and aurally) challenging music that's not particularly ""easy"" to summarize or decipher     is obviously not something to rally against; nobody wants Silver Mt. Zion to drop their agenda, embrace     facility, and dumb that shit down.  But self-indulgence (coupled with a healthy smattering of righteousness)     is still a viable problem, even if it's wrapped up in a thick blanket of noble intentions.  When you've     opted to go full-on ""difficult,"" you've got to be extra careful to validate the concessions you're demanding     of your audience-- the fact that it takes a good minute to even type out the name of this band and the title     of their record means, then, that folks should also have the automatic right to ask the hard questions     (just as A Silver Mt. Zion have the right to record four fifteen-minute, heavily principled opuses), and     to actively challenge the bits that seem overwrought, irritating, or wincingly pretentious.</p>
<p>Which circles back to listener dedication: if you're willing to filter out (or learn to appreciate) Menuck's     maddening vocal cartwheeling, and let yourself be led around by the head for a bit, <i>This is Our Punk     Rock</i> will reward you with a few sizable payoffs.  But if your tolerance for self-importance is dipping     low, look elsewhere for edification.  Fast.</p></div>"|7164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7164-this-is-our-punk-rock-thee-rusted-satellites-gather-sing/|7.4|Amanda Petrusich

    things will not be discussed: love, the love-gaze, relationships as metaphors for music, music as metaphor
    for relationships, and so on.  This restriction is not to deny that Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel aren't
    adorable (stomach-crampingly so, actually), or that they don't consciously play off their gimmick-- excuse
    me-- <em>unique situation</em>, for all it's worth.  It's just to consider their music in a different way
    than a million other muso-hacks who pounce on the easy angle.  Umm, don't check the archives.</p><p>
    Instead, this thinkpiece will celebrate a duo who even money said would flare out after an excellent debut
    and a sagging follow-up, but who fought the odds to scrape back with a third album that remembers what they
    did right in the first place, while simultastically evolving their sound in surprising ways.  2002's <i>Our
    Constant Concern</i> threatened to point the band towards weepy Hallmark piano balladeering, conforming to
    the criticsphere's pretty portrait of the Mates as Cupid in Indie Clothes.  But now <i>Team Boo</i> brings
    back the carefree raucousness that marked <i>My Solo Project</i>: giant calliope organ!  Crooked waltz
    drumming!  Joyous holleration harmonies!</p><p>
    Not everywhere, unfortunately, as sluggard songs like ""Parachutes (Funeral Song)"" and ""The Kissaway"" still
    hang around to drag down the third quarter.  But don't be lured to the skip button by the slow tempo opening
    of ""Open Book"", as the song blooms to a size more epic than anything in their catalog, complete with
    mini-choir.  Cracker-Jack surprises like that lift <i>Team Boo</i> above tired retread status, with the duo
    allowing outside players in on the action for the first time (and now you can see how the relationship
    metaphor would've gotten kinda, well, gross).</p><p>
    Change is applied most convincingly to ""Whiner's Bio"", in which a squint-bright trumpet pops up to
    underscore the pair's vocal cross-stitch.  Later, a brassy gloss is applied to the finale of ""An
    Experiment"", a lengthy-for-them track that might've otherwise succumbed to dreariness.  While the
    Mates never had any problem avoiding a thin sound, what with Gardner's meaty organ and Hammel's cephalopod
    drumming, things were starting to skew in a predictable direction, and producer/Spooninite Jim Eno's
    tasteful appliqué of the horn (and elegantly unobtrusive amount of overdubbing) suggests the group isn't
    quite up against a dead end yet.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, as advertised, are a handful of reminders why <i>My Solo Project</i> was able to chase away the
    easy Quasi comparisons.  ""Ha Ha"" revisits the patchwork structure of their early material, compressing a
    good three or four distinct segments into a rollicking three minutes.  ""I Got This Feelin'"" allows the
    industrial hum of organ bass to slide contentedly while the husband and wife harmonize on one of their
    most incongruous lyrics ever: ""This couldn't be more GHETTO!""  ""Sound It Off"" and ""Fluke"" also provide
    moments of distorted-organ goodness and polyrhythmic jarring, answering my prayers for a music that
    combines the fun of baseball stadium P.A. music and math-rock.</p><p>
    So <i>Team Boo</i> turns out to be a surprisingly respectable junior-year effort-- one that puts Mates of
    State in the small minority of indie-pop bands that don't fall under the one-album-and-out rule.  Whether
    they can push the limits of their sound much further remains to be seen (Fridmann and his pocket orchestra
    need not apply), but their first shaky steps towards outside collaboration work well here.  Hell, maybe
    it'll even be enough to fool people into writing about something other than how damn cute they are!  Maybe.</p></div>"|5145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5145-team-boo/|7.3|Rob Mitchum

The latter-- God bless
    his soul-- achieved cult status in the rock world with his sometimes disturbing, always ridiculous lyrics
    over the strict musical formula of three verses, a chorus, and a painfully long pre-programmed Casio
    keyboard loop ""solo"" before the third verse. One only imagines how many freshmen dorm rooms in America
    have been sent into late-night hysterics when twenty or thirty Pabst-nursing Napster newbies crowded
    around a buddy's Pentium II to hear Willis' glorious tales about the Hell City bus and a llama's whooped
    ass.  As anyone will report, for about two weeks-- the average time most people willingly subject themselves
    to Willis' music-- it's just glorious, shit-in-pants excitement.</p><p>
    
    Dudley Perkins, when not casting himself as ho-hum mid-90s rapper Declaime, is quickly becoming the
    300-hundred-pound black schizophrenic rambling novelty of the rhythm-and-blues world. Perkins has his own
    formula: generally speaking, a two-chord jazzy vamp fronted by poorly sung two-line epigrams, repeated
    ad nauseam. It's a formula that first manifested itself in the form of the heavily blunted ""Flowers"",
    which came out of some studio tinkering between Perkins and the increasingly prominent producer Madlib.
    ""Flowers"" caught the ear of Stones Throw founder Peanut Butter Wolf, who quickly released it as its own
    seven-inch, and then included the track on his <i>Jukebox 45s</i> compilation.</p><p>
    
    ""Flowers"" was cute and inconsequential, and Perkins' lazy delivery-- to the point that he had only a few
    phrases he'd repeat-- merited its small release. After one track, though, Perkins' formula wears out its
    welcome.  Here, Wesley Willis proves superior: he had a formula, but at the very least his lyrics were
    different with each verse, and, because he isolated his keyboard solo, one could always skip over it and
    get to his final verse. Perkins' voice, on the other hand, is the irritating keyboard solo of his own
    songs, and, because he sings throughout, one can't skip over them-- as if there were anything interesting
    to get to in the first place. Perkins' lyrics are painfully insipid, and given the tone of his delivery,
    curiously more self-important than they ought to be.</p><p>
    
    It's pointless to discuss these tracks individually-- with the words changed, they're practically the same:
    Perkins trying to be sincere about the most hackneyed R&amp;B; stock. The project itself is undoubtedly
    tongue-in-cheek, but that doesn't stop the majority of these tracks from being outright atrocious.
    ""Momma"" has Perkins praising his mother with vomit-worthy repetitions of ""it was you who gave me life"";
    ""The Light"" has Perkins explaining that he ""knows why [his] soul burns-- and yearns-- for knowledge"";
    Perkins tell us in ""Yo' Soul"" that ""you can feel it in yo' body, you can feel it in yo' soul"", but
    never actually says what ""it"" is.</p><p>
    
    If Perkins' debut had simply failed at an honest attempt to create something worthwhile, it would be one
    thing.  But <i>A Lil' Light</i> actually ruins otherwise solid tracks all but intentionally.  In a sense,
    <i>A Lil' Light</i> could be seen as two competing albums: Perkins' vapid mockery of the genre, and Madlib's
    breathtaking instrumentals.  Occasionally Madlib's beats are enough to propel the tracks out of Perkins'
    vacuity: beyond the short but engaging Yesterday's New Quintet breaks, ""Money"", the album's single, sports
    an addictive, rubbery bassline; ""Just Think"" proves how masterfully Madlib can baste mid-90s style rhythms
    with a subtle 60s jazz flavor; ""Falling"", perhaps not the song most indicative of the album's sound but by
    far its standout track, boasts brilliant string and bell samplings behind Perkins' inane spoken word outing.</p><p>
    
    Although Madlib's work here isn't necessarily as quirky as his instrumentals for Quasimoto's <i>The Unseen</i>
    and the tracks that are floating around from his upcoming Madvillain collaboration with MF Doom, he does
    save the record from being a total disaster-- sometimes overcoming zero gravity. As for Dudley Perkins,
    it might behoove him to know that McDonalds is the place to rock.  It is a restaurant where they buy
    food to eat.</p></div>"|6525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6525-a-lil-light/|4.1|Nicholas B. Sylvester

    the only sound is provided by a vocodered voice. But rather than using that device to turn man into the
    sheen of a playful disco machine, Villalobos' treated vocal on opener ""Easy Lee"" is murky, weighted down
    by reverb and doubt. It frequently trails off at the end of words and sentences. It's exhausted. And when
    the thump and snap of light 4/4 rhythms accompany it, it sounds even more submerged, as if it's trying to
    keep its head above water.</p><p>
    
    Villalobos approaches the admittedly wide and increasingly nebulous net of tech-house as if 2002 never
    happened-- no <i>The Present Lover</i>, no <i>All That Glitters</i>, no <i>Digital Disco</i>, no <i>Total
    4</i>. That's certainly not bad, it's just another tangent for this ever-pulsating sound. The odd thing is
    that even without getting in touch with his inner pop child, Villalobos has landed in the same general area
    as the <i>Tied to the 80s</i> retro futurists: a delicate mix of nuance and melody. It's sort of the
    morning-after-- or possibly the walk home from the club, the how soon is now?-- to all of those of shiny,
    hands-aloft nights out.  And Villalobos isn't the only producer taking this route. It's also one traveled
    by Luciano and the suddenly prolific Matthew Dear, whose Ghostly International releases-- <i>EP1</i> and
    <i>EP2</i>, and his upcoming <i>Leave Luck to Heaven</i> album-- all demonstrate a similar approach to
    tech-house.</p><p>
    
    The roots of the Villalobos' music-- which can also be found on his own outstanding mix albums <i>Love
    Family Trax</i> and <i>Taka Take</i>, Perlon's <i>Superlongevity</i> compilation, and a series of 12-inch
    releases under his own name and as half of Ric y Martin-- lie in the Kompakt label's ambient beginnings
    and Basic Channel and the rest of the minimalist Berlin crowd. Like the Berliners, he wades through gurgling,
    delicate pools of dubby bliss. His mix of groove and nuance seems somehow warm and cold at the same time,
    a very human expression of somber emotions. Its bittersweet tone is compounded by a blend of the familiar
    (the self-deprecating vocals almost direct house of ""What You Say is More Than I Can Say"", the late-night
    speedway of ""Y.G.H."") and the unexpected (""Waiworinao""'s chugging guitar, the polyrhythmic ""Fools Garden
    (Black Conga)"").</p><p>
    
    One setback is that the set misses perhaps his most beloved track, ""808 the Bassqueen"", although that may
    not have matched the record's tone. What is recycled from previous releases includes ""Dexter"", lifted from
    <i>Taka Taka</i>, and the aforementioned ""What You Say is More Than I Can Say"", which appears here as an
    edited version of the track, originally released on the <i>Halma</i> 12-inch.</p><p>
    
    One of the few vocal tracks, the me-against-the-world of ""I Try to Live (Can I Live)"", perhaps best
    illustrates the hesitancy, doubt, and weariness that drifts through <i>Alcachofa</i>. There and elsewhere
    throughout the record, Villalobos seems to be seeking comfort and finding it in small moments, in the nooks
    and crannies of the sound rather the more traditional heart-pumping moments explored by many tech-house
    producers over the past year or so. Instead, at <i>Alcachofa</i>'s heart beats a more steady rhythm, pumping
    out fragile melodies painted with small yet precise brushstrokes.</p></div>"|8506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8506-alcachofa/|8.1|Scott Plagenhoef

    apparently, he was already pretty far down the icy path to mangled teeth and sweaty mullets when he got
    the shit kicked out of him on the not-so-hockey-friendly streets of Hawaii.  Roberts, then fourteen, was
    competing in an off-season triathlon, and (cue bad lighting) inadvertently wandered into the wrong
    neighborhood at a clearly inopportune time.  Roberts later said that the last thing he heard before blacking
    out was, ""Pound him, Vince.""  Permanently injured and subsequently inspired, Roberts started writing songs
    from his hospital bed (the first of which was titled, lovingly, ""Keep Your Stick on the Ice"") and quietly
    abandoned hockey for a slightly gentler pursuit.
    
    <i>We Were Born in a Flame</i> is Roberts' bouncy full-length debut, and it's a perfectly listenable
    follow-up to 2002's <i>The Inhuman Condition</i> EP-- any Shaq-inspired fear of the-athlete-gone-recording-artist
    should prove itself unfounded. With <i>We Were Born</i>, a now twenty-six year old Roberts shows off an
    impressive sonic range, flitting from scrappy punk throwdowns to billowing power-pop, and his thick, rocker
    warble is always infused with lots of bleeding-kid-in-the-gutter mettle.</p><p>
    
    The only problem is that Roberts' record ultimately fails to transcend the standard, been-there, guitar-based
    rock formula that ties each of his booming experiments together-- <i>We Were Born in a Flame</i> is often
    painfully straightforward.  But if bone-tingling innovation isn't your bag, there's plenty of stuff to dig
    here: ""Don't Walk Away, Eileen"" is a belligerent electric punch, sorta reminiscent of the early, super-tense
    Who records, and ""Brother Down"" is a vaguely-retro acoustic stomp, with indulgently cheesy sing-along lyrics
    (always feels good to shout ""I think my life is passing me by!"") and pithy, foot-tapping percussion. ""Where
    Have All The Good People Gone?"" is an equally energetic, giggly cut (""The modern world is a cold, cold
    world/ And all I meet are cold, cold girls"") with ample opportunity for head-bobbing and dopey grinning.</p><p>
    
    Roberts brazenly hollers shit like, ""Yeah I bleed rock and roll/ And I would die for rock and roll,"" but it
    seems pretty unlikely that anyone will ever actually buy into his yelped assertions. <i>We Were Born in a
    Flame</i> is just a little too benign to really wave the badass flag with pride. But Roberts does thank Ted
    ""hide-your-cat-and-girlfriend"" Nugent in his liner notes, which, really, has gotta be worth <i>something</i>.
    Anything?</p></div>"|6802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6802-we-were-born-in-a-flame/|6.3|Amanda Petrusich

    of the Moog-flushed New Wave-revivalist project The Rentals, escapes to rural Tennessee, loses the
    coke-bottle rims, and re-colors his musical complexion by recording a catalogue of contemplative
    acoustic-based lamentations.  Coming from my speakers, though, it sounds something more akin to a
    lunch-break sit-in than an emphatic compositional dethronement.</p><p>
    
    Even so, it would be easy to indulge one's self with such a storyline if one (read: overly fascinated
    Weezer fan) was so inclined, given the facts.  Of the four primary records Sharp recorded in the 90s,
    three (<i>Weezer</i>, <i>Pinkerton</i>, <i>Return of The Rentals</i>) were nearly unqualified successes.
    His fourth, 1999's <i>Seven More Minutes</i>, was a hedonistic, uber-polished glamfest recorded in
    Europe with such indie royalty as Damon Albarn.  The scene would certainly seem to be set for a dramatic
    introversion and grand stylistic makeover replete with a shirking of success.  The resulting material
    reveals more of a half-truth.</p><p>
    
    Then again, perhaps I over calibrated, but when I read about ""haunting,"" ""sparse"" and ""spiritual"" strains
    written with the intent of disestablishing the barriers between the performer and the listener, this is not
    at all what I envision.  ""Goodbye West Coast"", the opener, is essentially a slow-drip Rentals melody carried
    by a little acoustic strumming and the requisite picking.  The lullaby chorus is delicately anthemic and
    carried by another Sharp signature: multi-layered vocal tracking. Stir in the textured and glossy finish,
    and what results is a grayscale rendering of a Rentals color snapshot.  Or maybe it's a B-side acoustic
    cover.</p><p>
    
    With an acoustic guitar, some sublevel ambience, and lap steel that functions as visceral persuasion in
    the same capacity a Moog would have, ""Some Come Running Through"" might suffer the same appraisal were it
    not for the marked attempt at achieving a countrified feel, most notably projected by Sharp's nasal
    Dylan-meets-Petty syllabic protractions.  The final two songs operate within a similar framework with
    a few notable distractions, all three surpassing the five-minute mark, yet none providing justification
    for having done so.  ""Visions of Anna"", with a lazy piano lead, dissolves into excess as Sharp dryly
    breathes out the line, ""Visions of Anna make me cry,"" in such a way that makes it impossible for my
    mind not to conjure up the mental image of miss Norma Jean serenading our 35th President.  ""Hey, What
    You Gonna Do?"" unfortunately uses a little bit of the sing-then-talk method to obviously irksome effect,
    and essentially obviates what might have been the most vital statement on the album.</p><p>
    
    Thematically, each of the four tracks deals with modest personal narratives of loss and regret. ""Goodbye
    West Coast"" explores the emotional weight of returning to a best friend's funeral, while the others relate
    a sort of can't-git-no-lower romantic portentousness.  Such a disposition is probably most indicative of
    the motivation for the stylistic shift and change of climate.  These humble songs, in the end, are chiefly
    innocuous, and perhaps the experience was even cathartic and therapeutic for Sharp, though most of this jury
    is too disinterested to return for a more thorough rendering when a full album of evidence is released in
    the future.</p></div>"|7707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7707-pucketts-versus-the-country-boy-ep/|5.5|William Morris

Am
    I in a dream? Wait, isn't that what this year's <i>Winter in the Belly of a Snake</i> was made of? When did
    these two become IDM's J-Lo and Ben? Most pressing of all, why has no one ever thought of recording sex
    sounds until now? Oh wait, they did: it's called pornography.</p><p>
    
    I think we can all agree that sex records are always a good idea, in any environs, under any guidance, with
    anyone.  It does, however, introduce a bit of a problem: the distinction between art and pornography.
    Although I have a cursory acquaintance with the decisions of the Warren Court in the 1950s, it's an
    important thing to consider before dissecting this album. Am I supposed to be hearing it carnally as sex
    with a sort of narrative (including, pant, the climax!)? Is it just <i>influenced</i> by sex? Is it sex?
    Like all rhetorical questions, the answer to all is no.</p><p>
    
    The dilemma inherent in a gimmick like this is that it's only possible to derive enjoyment from it if you
    know it has to do with an orgiastic camorra of naked, shivering techno-bodies rubbing all over one another.
    The album is composed entirely out of the recording of ""anal and oral sex, straightforward copulation, and
    'microphone insertion.'""  But, perhaps unfortunately, this is pretty close to the standard recording of most
    pop songs in the last century. You think Elvis was big because of his music? Anyone seen <i>Amadeus</i>?
    In a year where Madonna and Britney Spears are luring ointment into the holiest of each other's crevices
    in Pepsi commercials, I don't need some experimental glitch/IDM freak telling me how you can make music out
    of moaning.</p><p>
    
    Most of those popular songs are actually about sex. <i>Nymphomatriarch</i> is about melancholy sparseness
    and irony. Sexy? Whatever happened to Isaac Hayes? The intro, ""Input"", is the Mormon Tabernacle put on life
    support, and I guess about putting a microphone in, how to say, Hecate's ""subwoofer."" It does indeed sound
    like shrill moaning and expanding orifices, but it would be unrecognizable if you didn't get the press
    release ahead of time. Basically, it just sounds like some inept ambience with some silly melodic synths.</p><p>
    
    But things do heat up rather quickly.  The percussion of ""Blood on the Rope"" seems to be almost entirely
    composed of the revelatory sound of ass-smacking, though without any sort of visual accompaniment, it
    sounds more like someone masochistically slapping some girl's face at 30 miles per hour than the unleashing
    of raging lust (unless that's your definition of raging lust). Whether it's successful or not probably
    depends more on your sexual preferences than your musical ones. Put it like this: it gives a whole new
    meaning to the term ""drill-n-bass.""  Like the rest of the album, it might be more seductive if they got
    rid of the sex sounds. As it is, it doesn't sound extraordinarily different from playing Venetian Snares
    over a Hecate song.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, between ""Blood on the Rope"" and the pummeled bruises of ""Pervs"", there's some pretty
    perfervidly maniacal rhythm on this album. ""Pervs"" may sound more like unzipping your skin than lecherous
    intrigue, but whatever, it's definitely got a bite. ""Amaurophilia"" also really doesn't have much to do
    with what the common man might call intercourse, or a commoner man might call ""boning hos."" The noises
    are all gravelly crunching, running faucets, abandoned swing sets in Death Park. It's probably about as
    sexual as any other Venetian Snares album. I don't know what it does for other people; it made me cough
    a lot.</p><p>
    
    These tracks are adequately creative, with or without the sex, but you wish it hadn't been wasted
    on a gimmick album. Unfortunately, about half of the half-hour album is dedicated to ""Hymen Tramp Choir"",
    which is basically the intro times fifteen minutes of your life. It's an incredibly slow, metallic sheen,
    about as sexual and exciting as cleaning a sink with Brillo pads. Of course, for many, this may be more
    like sex than sex. But, even then, Brillo pads are less expensive than CDs right now. It goes through some
    gushingly lascivious whispers, but rapidly transports itself to new age catalogues of waterfalls and
    phantasmagoric forests before finally crumbling as a phlegmatic yawn. Without this unnecessary tedium,
    the album might even reach into the 7's.</p><p>
    
    There are clear antecedents here that I'm obligated to refer to: Matmos' <i>A Chance to Cut is a Chance to
    Cure</i> and Herbert's <i>Bodily Functions</i>, and probably some of that intellectual porn-lit IDM kids
    are into, like de Sade or Sacher-Masoch. In a <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview producer RZA once testified
    that on a track off ODB's <i>Nigga Please</i>, the extremely irrational and arrhythmic percussion is
    actually the sound of Dirt McGirt banging some girl on top of a bass drum while he's rapping. This is
    and should be the sound of sex. Piling some fierce and propulsive beats over an echo chamber is not
    sexy (not even ironically); it's irrelevant at worst and frightening at best.</p></div>"|5878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5878-nymphomatriarch/|6.6|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    post-hardcore friends of mine who, try as they might, could only see childish amateurism in Bret Lunsford,
    Calvin Johnson, and Heather Lewis's rustic childhood sing-alongs.  I was a teenage devotee.  When naysayers
    complained that <i>Dreamy</i> was hollow, I explained that Beat Happening didn't need a bassist because
    Calvin's voice was deep enough to supply endless roots.  When Mel Bay graduates groaned about the primitive
    rock drumming and simple guitar strums, I wrote essays in the school paper about why the trio's minimalism
    eloquently flew in the face of cheesy rock star excess; and besides, the Olympians perfected a dark,
    perverse sweetness I only ever really saw in my favorite books.</p><p>
    
    In the sparest of tunes about hot chocolate boys, holding hands after sex, or eating wild cherries and
    french toast at cemeteries, Beat Happening's songs were dumpster-diving romantic.  Live, Calvin's oddball
    dances and wide-eyed charisma created a dose of creepy punk-confrontation-cum-childhood-trauma and was
    more unnerving than the faceless dudes next door wallowing in a generic sea of uninspired tough-guy Sam
    Ash tropes.  Subsequently, these darker, headier aspects of Beat Happening's poetry were lost to twee-pop
    groups like Cub, Bunnygrunt, and dozens of pixie-stix-sucking copycat dorks who misinterpreted the trio's
    outer-id lyricism as a call for lunchbox-toting kindergarten cuddlecore.</p><p>
    
    Though I'm no fan of Bret, Calvin, or Heather's later work, as Beat Happening they epitomized a
    Blake-as-teenage-punk philosophy.  Their aesthetic was so pared down that it barely allowed room for a
    misfire from their formative bare-bones autism in the early 80s to 1992's fleshed-out grand finale, <i>You
    Turn Me On</i>.  Second maybe only to Fugazi in my formative musical worldview, and ripe for a reconsideration
    by youngsters who perhaps only know the autumnal anthem ""Indian Summer"" through Luna's soporific cover, the
    band's entire output was collected on last year's <i>Crashing Through</i>-- titled after a track from 1988's
    <i>Jamboree</i>-- a retrospective seven-disc box set complete with an extensive 96-page booklet authored by
    fellow salad-day traveller Lois Maffeo.</p><p>
<i>Music to Climb the Apple Tree By</i>, which was included with that box set, compiles fifteen songs
    recorded between 1984 and 2000, including the original version of ""Nancy Sin"" and the four dense, acrobatic
    tracks that comprised the band's 1988's split EP with Screaming Trees.  Other highlights include Beat
    Happening's newest, but equally spare compositions: ""Angel Gone"" and ""Zombie Limbo Time"" from 2000's
    <i>Angel Gone</i> seven-inch, and the still-great ""Foggy Eyes"", which was first included on their
    self-titled 1985 debut and later covered on the 1991 Beat Happening tribute <i>Fortune Cookie Prize</i>
    by Seaweed in a version predictably raucous enough for even the most macho of naysayers.</p><p>
    
    Fifteen tracks, of course, is but a tiny blip in a lengthy oeuvre, and despite my high opinion of Beat
    Happening, <i>Music to Climb the Apple Tree By</i>, like most hodgepodge singles collections, not only
    ends in a preposition, but lacks narrative cohesion as though waiting for the rest of the sentence to
    show up and complete the thought.  I'm a stalwart fan of original album sequences, especially the way
    songs play off one another after years of close proximity; the new placement of these tracks doesn't
    feel correct somehow-- it's more like the ahistorical, catch-all desktop of an MP3 fanatic than those
    fully realized rainy-day adventure stories for which I enjoyed Beat Happening the most.</p><p>
    
    Most kindly put, <i>Music to Climb the Apple Tree By</i> works as a reminder of a particularly great band,
    and it had me cycling obsessively through the lost corners of my record collection for my copy of

    Now that they've come to prominence via the California-based indie Darla Records, it's My Morning Jacket's
    turn to risk their careers and financial stability for a shot at recording a real statement album backed
    by a serious budget.  But something's not right here, or maybe something's <i>too</i> right: Jim James'
    high, lonesome croon is still recorded in a grain silo, and the band's sound is still a cathedral of reverb,
    but where you might expect grandiose 40-piece orchestras, bombastic gospel choirs and glossy,
    state-of-the-art digital effects, you will find only the vast, empty space that has always accompanied the
    band's instrumentation, allowing each note to resonate indefinitely, unhampered by unnecessary density.
    Rest assured, the faithful will have no problem kneeling here.</p><p>
    Last year's exploratory <i>Chocolate &amp; Ice</i> EP left quite a few open questions about the band's future
    direction, many signals of which could be found in the 24-minute electro-funk centerpiece ""Cobra"".  But
    <i>It Still Moves</i> almost immediately confirms that the spacy Southern psych that My Morning Jacket
    built their name on remains their bread and butter.  ""Mahgeetah"" is full of the long, drawn-out vocals
    that made ""Can You See the Hard Helmet on My Head?"" such an affecting and seemingly meaningful question;
    it also carries over the texture of that song, building a small epic out of the same elements.  The band
    reacts to each verse differently-- once with explosions of glimmering arpeggios, later with Johnny Quaid's
    beautiful, understated guitar solo-- before bringing the whole thing to one of those thunderous conclusions
    that makes classic rock live albums such a guilty pleasure.</p><p>
    ""Golden"" trots through a glowing haze of reverb on Patrick Hallahan's steadily brushed beat, its lilting
    finger-picking and ghostly harmonies falling somewhere between The Band's stately Canadicana and The Byrds'
    ""Ballad of Easy Rider"".  ""One Big Holiday"" doesn't look like much from the lyrics in the liners, but when
    James grabs hold of the opening line, ""Wakin' up feeling good and limber,"" and draws it out in his singular
    way, it feels about a million times more weighty than it probably should.  Near the album's midpoint, the
    reverb reaches such titanic proportions that James' drifting vocals begin to rival Sigur Rós' Jon Thor
    Birgisson for shear ethereality, particularly on a track like ""I Will Sing You Songs"". It's like listening
    in the throes of a lucid dream.</p><p>
    ""Easy Morning Rebel"" puts your feet back on the ground with its swinging arrangement and Memphis horns
    (actually played by veteran Stax session men-- one of the rare frills here made available by major label
    dollars).  And then, finally, the band leaves James alone in his silo to close the album with the searching,
    desperate ""One in the Same"", a song that finds him seemingly trying to sort fragmented memories into
    coherent thoughts.  When he hits the lines, ""It wasn't till I woke up/ That I could hold down a joke or
    a job or a dream/ But then all three are one in the same,"" it should put a lump in your throat.</p><p>
    And with that, <i>It Still Moves</i> strums to a close, an album by turns beautiful and possessed, by
    others raucous and fiery.  If you're standing by the record racks trying to choose between this and the
    band's other major achievement, <i>At Dawn</i>, flip a coin; either way, you win.  My Morning Jacket have
    made the move to the bigs in tremendous style, and as far as I can tell they haven't compromised a thing
    to be there.  If there's one major flaw I could point to here, it'd be the album's length-- 74 minutes is
    a long runtime for any record, and as a result, the album is usually better off listened to in chunks--
    but that's a small concern considering the riches that await inside.</p></div>"|5531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5531-it-still-moves/|8.3|Joe Tangari

What fun, to see
    everyone from the most gussied, stilettoed hoochie to the most macho, nut-kneading hoss as participants
    in a global burlesque, playing dress-up to confirm, with cartoonish or even monstrous enthusiasm, a notion
    of ""hot,"" ""raw,"" ""extreme"" masculinity or femininity. (Pardon my blog: I can't speak for you Dakotans, but
    here in Florida, our faux-public spaces-- like say, our malls-- can seem like porn sets.)  (Pardon my blog
    two: As the middle child between a bodybuilder and a beauty queen, I was subject to so many unsettling
    weekends of oil-n-bikini pageantry that I should have been driven by either allergy or addiction into
    becoming a monk or a prostitute.)  Some of this hetero-drag costumery generates cross-gender-role feedback;
    consult stout/thuggy gurrls, or remember Arnold's chesty, hairless, braceleted, tiara-maned Conan.</p><p>
    
    Jon Mikl Thor has spent thirty years as a drag king, the manniest man ever to manhandle outmanned mankind.
    This horror-film actor, star of his own comic (<i>The Rock Warrior</i>) and former Mr. Canada and Mr. USA
    (as well as former merchant of baking pans) has re-released the latest of his dozen-or-so albums with
    remastered sound, a few redone songs, five new songs, and two videos.  The rating above represents the
    average score of the 0.0 that <i>Triumphant</i> earns for whatever Pitchfork attempts to assess (originality,
    artistry, musicianship, credigree?) and the 10.0 that <i>Triumphant</i> earns as a novelty-metal classic
    putting its genre's satirists to shame.  (Why did Spinal Tap and Satanicide bother, when this stuff's
    already self-consciously a caricature to the point of being spoofproof?)</p><p>
    
    What a crack-up the packaging is.  The band logo is metallic, ""held on"" by Phillips-head screws.  The
    front and back cover art feature an axe-, sword-, and shield-wielding whitey in a skull-belt and bat-helmet
    chopping up dark-skinned, apelike savages in order to protect his pale women, intimidatingly proportioned
    cowerers ""in"" ill-advised (transparent) thongs.  Unfortunately, Nordic lore has long served as a ""white
    power"" myth, if more subtly than the Scottish rites usurped by the KKK.</p><p>
    
    The Medieval Times-caliber accents in the skits are hilarious.  The first two songs borrow from rap's
    brand-building tactic of saying the rapper's name over and over; Thor skillfully celebrates his Thorness
    (""I Am Thor"" is self-explanatory, while ""March to Glory"" chants, ""Thor is war, and war is Thor,"" though
    ""glory"" and ""whore"" might be in there somewhere).  Thor's three favorite words are ""steel,"" ""thunder,""
    and ""tundra,"" though he's always searching for priapic ""sceptres"" and ""hammers.""  He says that ""anger is
    my middle name"" on ""Anger III"", which is confusing, since we know his middle name to be Mikl, unless we
    are to accept him as his one-word stage-name.  Meanwhile, ""Thunderhawk"", seriously about being a thunderhawk,
    is fall-down funny.</p><p>
    
    The majority of the music is standard-issue mega-drum deathcore, but that doesn't mean that the guitars
    don't charmingly grind like Panzer treads, or that the solos don't impressively veer from operatic to
    Tasmanian.  Thor's electronically enhanced vocal range can be disorienting, as he approximates metal
    bandleaders from various decades, squealing then grunting then crooning and so forth and so on and
    stuff.  ""Viking's Funeral"" constitutes an amazing mix-CD kickoff: with its Europe-ish keyboards, Iron
    Maiden-ish vox, campy skit, and Elfman-ish knells, this mother is ready for Broadway.  The boogie organ
    of ""GraveYard (From the Film <i>GraveYard</i>)"" is another mean surprise.</p><p>
    
    The album's major misstep is the bar-band quality ""Back for Blood"", which trots out a stinkbug of a riff,
    and begins, ""Well, you're so stupid, you're so dumb/ You're so foolish, you're a dirty rotten scum.""  I
    could swear the next line was going to be about how The Fat Boys were back and could never be wack.  But
    all the harm is rectified by the album's stupefying musical and lyrical peak: ""Throwing Cars at People on
    Coke with Thor"". Such a blitz, such a <i>swarm</i>, hasn't been heard by these ears since way before the
    Ipecac revivalists, around Suicidal Tendencies' first tape, and this is as terrifying a drug song as any
    Butthole Surfers binge-ditty.</p><p>
    
    A resolute elitist in the room with me kept saying, ""This is the work of trailer-park anarchists,"" and, ""I
    bet their studio's in a strip mall,"" and, ""This sounds like a sport utility vehicle,"" but I don't mind Thor.
    The guy's latex tongue is shooting lightning bolts into his cheek, a la Gwar, making his comic-book mythos
    the white-warlock antidote to Danzig's snuff-Porsche oeuvre.  Certain valorbrains might fall for the
    Bruckheimer ""war is great"" shit, but anyone who's seen <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> knows that Belle &amp;
    Sebastian's ""Get Me Away from Here, I'm Dying"" is a more accurate combat anthem.  Bless the hearts of
    these weightlifters who transform their bodies into veiny packages.  <i>St. Anger</i> wears a dress.
    At John Waters' signal, unleash hell.</p></div>"|8235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8235-triumphant/|5.0|William Bowers

    to know what that reason is, but I believe that statement to be true, regardless.  The evidence is plain in
    just about anyone beyond a certain age, the all-consuming, epic oldness where a person can say ""when I was
    your age"" without a trace of irony.  It hits some people as early as twenty or so, when they suddenly find
    themselves on the downhill side of life, confronted with a bleak realization that things were a whole lot
    greener back when they were still climbing (or before they knew any better, at least).  Some people, they
    just never stop climbing; it's rare, but it happens.</p><p>
    
    A great many of David Bowie's fans, with each successive year, slowly but surely creep into the former
    category even as Bowie himself manages to still act like a card-carrying member of the latter.  ""I'm never
    never gonna get old,"" he proclaims on the Toys 'R' Us-inspired ""Never Get Old"", and to his credit, he makes
    yet another convincing argument.  With one exception (the hokey, one-foot-in-the-grave <i>Hours</i>), Bowie--
    even in his advanced age (by fresh-faced rock standards), even after almost a trillion records-- has never
    dwelled unduly on his past.  If anything, while people will always hold him up to his past accomplishments,
    his career has floundered more than once out of his desire for self-conscious avant-gardism and an almost
    schizophrenic need to reinvent his persona.  What last year's <i>Heathen</i> implied, and what <i>Reality</i>
    seems to prove, is that those days are over; never looking back, and no longer focusing ahead, Bowie has
    finally joined us all in the present, mind-young as ever but old enough not to make a show of it.</p><p>
    
    And then, if you'll grant this indulgence, there's me, the one who's supposed to be writing about him:
    ""Plain Ol' 'Dave'"" baffles me.  Bowie's work is traditionally seen in a terrifically damaging binary--
    common law states that if his work isn't brilliant, it's terrible; that's obviously wrong, since there're
    plenty of gray areas to be found in Bowie's oeuvre, but it's easy as hell to fall into the trap.  Not much
    can stack up to <i>Hunky Dory</i> or <i>Scary Monsters</i>, after all.  But then he goes and releases,
    consecutively, the two most earnest, unpretentious albums he's ever dreamed up, and the Pocket Dichotomy
    that had been used so frequently to dismiss <i>Outside</i>, <i>Earthling</i>, and others, is now terminally,
    irrevocably broken.  <i>Heathen</i> looked like it might've been a holding pattern on the way to greater
    heights, but only for rising from the ashes of <i>Hours</i>; <i>Reality</i> shows that instead, Bowie is
    not aiming for an unattainable Ziggy-caliber alien classic, but is simply going to rock like any other
    human, in a pleasantly mild, non-conformist manner.</p><p>
    
    This is as close as Bowie has ever come to simply ""pretty good"" in his storied career.  A zealous few will
    say that he's just further ahead of the curve than anyone can see, but if that's so, then what lies ahead
    is MOR rock and roll, with producer Tony Visconti's unobtrusive, light-handed electronic flourishes as
    gloss; no way-- he's too talented to be overtly influenced or obviously faddish, but that doesn't mean he's
    breaking ground.  That's not an insult.  I feel the biggest strength of this album is how relaxed it is,
    how well this anti-pose suits Bowie.  It's freed him to craft some of the finest original material he's
    done in quite a while; <i>Heathen</i> best expressed his singular vision through the compositions of others,
    but <i>Reality</i>'s original material easily overshadows its covers.</p><p>
    
    In particular, the George Harrison-penned ""Try Some, Buy Some"", though a kind tribute to Bowie's recently
    deceased contemporary, might be the album's only real mistake.  Sappy, vacant lyrics and plodding, waltz-timed
    orchestration give a feel similar to a more fleshed-out version of the Morrissey cover ""I Know It's Gonna
    Happen Someday"", but without any the self-referential poignancy invested in the latter.  The deep-space
    broadcast of ""Pablo Picasso"" is a substantial improvement, in terms of covers, with its echoing trills and
    white-funk syncopation and the intense surrealism of hearing the words ""Pablo Picasso never got called an
    asshole/ Not like you,"" come from Bowie's mouth, but David promised that Reality would ""rock"", and he
    proceeds to do so even more effectively elsewhere.</p><p>
    
    Hard-edged dynamics are supplied to direct, aggressive rhythms on numerous tracks like the supremely nervous,
    desperate ""Looking for Water"" and less obviously on the epic jazz kick ""Bring Me the Disco King"", but only
    ""New Killer Star"" feels like more than an exercise with slightly dusty rock standbys.  It opens the album
    with a bassline etched indelibly within our genetic make-up, instantly recognizable and irresistible, and
    once the hook is set, a deluge of static-hazed background singers, weird robo-choruses, and a shaky treble
    riff that easily marks the album's finest moment simply spew forth from the speakers, overwhelming all but
    the most cynical of Bowie's detractors.  At least, that's what I predict.</p><p>
    
    Also worthy of mention is the stark contrast provided by ""The Loneliest Guy"".  It sounds like the title to
    a forgotten Dudley Moore flick, and may sound somewhat like disingenuous fame lament coming from Bowie, but
    the song itself will dispel those thoughts.  Nearly a cappella, with bare hints of strings and stray piano
    chords fading in from other rooms, Bowie instead offers that he's ""the luckiest guy/ Not the loneliest guy/
    In the world/ Not me,"" but does so with such mournful uncertainty that no easy reading of the song is
    possible; it seems surprisingly human, bittersweet, and altogether far more real than its name implies.
    It's startlingly out of place, sandwiched between ""Never Get Old"" and ""Looking for Water"", so much so that
    it almost implies sarcasm, but that's fitting, as this is as eclectic and puzzling album as Bowie's ever
    made.  He's not always at the top of his game, but Bowie's musical ideas, not filtered through any sort of
    trend-grab, are unfailingly unique, and that alone should cement his continued role as vibrant, modern
    artist for years to come.</p></div>"|880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/880-reality/|7.3|Eric Carr

    Delaware-based electro-rock duo Stars as Eyes. It's to be expected: remix albums of limpid semi-electric
    music have a tendency to highlight both the weakest non-rock and non-electronic aspects of a group's work,
    often through the illusionary notion that, by stretching something longer and increasing the thread-count,
    the overall composition can be magically reborn as ""experimental.""  Yet what usually remains after such a
    reifying hack job is an electronic pop song that rocks faintly or a faint rock song that has a couple
    computer burps here and there to remind you it was recorded in the so-called digital age.</p><p>
    
    More electro than past efforts, <i>Loud New Shit</i> includes eight remixes of tracks from last year's
    <i>Enemy of Fun</i> originals. In their purest (i.e. non-remixed) state, Stars as Eyes could be compared
    to Manitoba with a bland fixation on Stereolab, New Order, and OMD rather than the shoegaze of My Bloody
    Valentine or Ride. Add to this an ADD need for obvious rock dynamics, Stars as Eyes opt for up and down
    overdrive, rarely allowing for spaciousness to emerge in their overcrowded and unsuccessful approach to
    This Heat-style experiments. In this sense, however weak, Main's ""Time Dilation"" remix of ""Our Light"" is
    the strongest track on <i>Loud New Shit</i>, largely because its residual teeming of K.K. Null insect buzz
    doesn't even remotely resemble the anthemic original, tastefully avoiding the obvious laptop-guys-who-wanna-rock
    final payoff.</p><p>
    
    In the grand scheme, Stars as Eyes would benefit best not from remixing, but from an entire structural
    reconstitution. Integrating rock and electronic music is an old enough concept-- check out early Cul de
    Sac or the aforementioned This Heat's <i>Deceit</i> or <i>Repeat</i>, or use your imagination and go
    back further-- but when yoking the lazier, platitudinal aspects of each, the result is the sonic equivalent
    of the failed Amphicar.</p><p>
    
    While computers have opened up massive potential in music that's just starting to be plumbed in earnest,
    much of it is stapled to a click-track with a 120 BPM default, which makes it all sound a little like my
    wobbly, taped-together military march-time tin-can robot, the Sleeptron 2003. Despite what many offerings
    suggest, the merge takes more than a downloaded copy of ProTools and an extended Moogerfooger solo over
    My Bloody Valentine's ""When You Sleep"" slowed to a river of ones and zeros. It's a long way to go before
    this stuff will sound a tenth as fresh as, say, 1940s jazz, but if the expressive capability of your medium
    has expanded, why keep drawing stick-figure flipbook animations?</p></div>"|7473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7473-loud-new-shit/|4.9|Brandon Stosuy

    divide.  It's unnecessary and a slight bit juvenile because it's one-sided and too often an exercise in the
    have-nots simply praising themselves for their not having rather than, y'know, going out and developing
    their own style, and that's not a very productive way of going about things.  DM + Jemini apparently
    couldn't give a toss about any of these hip-hop politics, either, because they've managed the too-rare
    trick of bridging the gap.  <i>Ghetto Pop Life</i> is a leftfield album built with an emcee more interested
    in offering wordplay than storytelling or charisma, and a DJ who isn't afraid to underscore the lyrics with
    playful beats.</p><p>
    
    DM + Jemini-- a self-contained crew, something of a rarity these days-- are also an odd couple. Danger Mouse
    is based in the far-more-pop-than-ghetto Athens, GA, wears animal costumes, and has crafted beats for limp
    British R&amp;B; artists, while Jemini (formerly The Gifted One) is a mid-90s Brooklyn B-boy who recorded the
    Brooklyn Kids' solid <i>Funk Soul Sensation</i> EP.  Jemini's nasal, sing-song voice and tendency to raise
    his tone as he delivers his lines contain echoes of Freeway and Sadat X, although he's not nearly as
    distinctive or engaging as the former or as high-pitched and offbeat as the latter; his poker-faced rhymes
    show a bit of dexterity but too often lack personality.  Danger Mouse, meanwhile, seems stubbornly determined
    to make a party record, and acts a welcome counterweight.  His soundscapes borrow heavily from hip-hop's
    history, but rarely drift into the back-patting regressiveness of Jurassic 5 and other old-school loyalists.</p><p>
<i>Ghetto Pop Life</i>'s best tracks balance cinematic tones with a touch of funk and Prince Paul's penchant
    for quirk.  It's fairly direct and hardly experimental-- DM's version of pop seems to cut off before the
    digital era (the only contemporary whose influence is noticeable is Just Blaze)-- but to compensate, it
    features some of the catchiest hooks the underground has produced this year.  ""Born-a-MC""-- a regal opener
    in the spirit of Jay-Z's ""The Ruler's Back"" and The Streets' ""Turn the Page""-- bleeds into the swirling,
    trebly, and quite glorious title track.  ""I got a bullet in the clip/ I got a lyric I could spit,"" Jemini
    proclaims, illustrating the record's denial of a hip-hop dichotomy.  The top-heavy disc peaks early with
    its sixth track, the infectious, horn-driven ""The Only One"", which replicates a guilt-free block party vibe
    without pandering to nostalgia (unlike most of the record's guests, which include The Pharcyde, The Liks,
    and J-Zone).  Other thrills come courtesy of the guitar-picking ""Omega Supreme (Who?!)"", the restless march
    of ""Copy Cats"", and ""That Brooklyn Shit"", a baroque, Wu-Tangish blend of bewilderment and braggadocio.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the record slumps to a close, weighted down by shaky attempts at topical rap: The
    calypso-esque ""Don't Do Drugs"" is a bit precious, oscillating between catchy and grating, while ""Bush Boys""
    is a bit too simplistic, an exercise in preaching to the choir.  Other missteps include the flat-out weak
    Pharcyde collaboration ""Medieval"", the love letter ""I'm a Doomee"", and ""Here We Go Again"", which seems to
    be purposefully arrhythmic in order to keep focus off its weighty topic, and goes down like medicine (or
    at least Black-Eyed Peas).  It's even peppered with some oddly dated observations, like a mention of the
    OJ trial (?!) and the line, ""Republican/ Democrats/ One and the same,"" which, even as a former Nader voter,
    strikes me as a questionable observation.</p><p>
    
    Jemini's comeback is heartwarming and welcome, but it's when Danger Mouse offers a delicate application
    of his influences that the album truly works.  On the whole, the record's another winner from Warp subsidiary
    Lex Records, which also delivered Tes' <i>x2</i> earlier in the year and will release the debut from Non
    Prophets next month.  (They're providing some lovely packaging for their records, as well.)  Although it's
    weighted down in spots, <i>Ghetto Pop Life</i> is, at its best, a true surprise from a seemingly mismatched
    pair working well together to produce a universal, populist sound.</p></div>"|2517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2517-ghetto-pop-life/|7.8|Scott Plagenhoef

    People consider his style an amalgam of the unofficial collaborating team of Jay-Z, Scarface and Beanie
    Sigel: emotional, charismatic, streetwise, and, in the case of Sigel, constantly repeating the last word
    of his rhymes.</p><p>
    In this respect, Santana comes off like Cam'ron without the talent. His rhymes usually start off relatively
    strong, taking an introspective view into various tired street subjects, from the police (""Squalie"") to
    blowjobs (""Down"") to his dead homies (""This is for My Homies""). And then, his rhymes end up looking
    something like what I'll write for you here: ""I'm not a commie, Bobby/ Mr. Miyagi, Bobby/ I'm hardly a
    slob-by, Bobby/ I'm fucking godly, Bobby."" Basically, he falls apart halfway through each of his verses,
    descending into an awkward yelling spree that fails to move him past the point he started to make with
    the first eight lines.  The best example is, surprisingly, the first single.</p><p>
    ""Dipset (Santana's Town)"" is-- and this is no exaggeration-- the worst song of the year. A stuttering
    abomination, the beat by Self sounds like what might happen if ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" got mixed with
    the theme from <i>Psycho</i> and random female utterances. The lyrics don't help, with Santana screaming,
    ""The whole bird gang's in here/ Like Kurt Cobain was here, YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!"", subsequently setting
    off the nonsensical rhyme of, ""They the paparazzi, they the livest posse/ Kamikaze, nazi, nazi, copy,
    papi?"" and ending it with, ""I'm a baller baller/ You're not at all a baller/ That's why I squashed your
    daughter/ Left her home, call her, call her."" The song ends and you just sit. You think. You wonder.  The
    song has a place in your heart now. Your arteries close. Your heart explodes. The song has taken another
    life. Fin.</p><p>
    Hearing their previous work, you might expect me to say how The Heatmakerz have salvaged this record. And
    while they do help, I can't quite give them pure adoration. Some songs utilize their powerful accelerated
    soul sample style well (""Okay Okay"", ""Squalie"", ""My Love [Remix]"") while others are questionable, regarding
    their choice of sample. They manage to sample Mary J. Blige, a group of Jodeci rip-offs (D.R.S.) and most
    heinously, Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get It On"". Supported by embarrassing pieces by Self, Chad Hamilton, Jazze
    Pha and Charlemagne, this album falls apart where everyone thought it would succeed--and the complete absence
    of Just Blaze is the final blow.</p><p>
    Pointlessly misogynistic (blowjob skits were done as soon as Biggie did one), lyrically weak and relatively
    hit/miss with production, Santana's first album is a pretty difficult listen. There are maybe a million
    emcees out there doing the exact same thing that he is-- only they aren't functionally retarded. Unfortunately
    for Juelz, he's stuck continuously square-pegging in Circle Junction. Surrounded with a low budget G-Unit
    and stuck in a genre with deeper, more talented peers, Juelz can't offer an interesting alternative to the
    common land of commercial rap.</p></div>"|7712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7712-from-me-to-u/|3.2|Rollie Pemberton

Since starting his career spouting bouncy, Brand Nubian-esque black
    power verses with his late brother Subroc and rapper Onyx in the collective KMD, Daniel Dumile has gained
    weight, smoked hallucinogens, drank libations, and developed a new style to match his rapidly deteriorating
    voice.  Now, in a new arena of arrhythmia and soft beats, MF Doom staggers into a telephone booth somewhere
    underground and falls out as Viktor Vaughn.</p><p>
    A joint project between Doom and Sound-Ink, <i>Vaudeville Villain</i>'s storyline follows the everyday life
    of super-villain/beat scientist/drug dealer/stick-up kid Vik Vaughn.  Not surprisingly, it plays out much
    like any other Metal Face project: Doom's sick flow is tied to a fractured cadence, a slurry, guttural
    delivery, obscure pop culture references (""Unfrozen caveman, look over the contracts"") and beautifully
    simple idioms and metaphors.  Although best known for his more whimsical material, this album has Doom
    frequently coming off like Wu without the pretension, branching out into more evolved song structures
    (choruses!) and unusually focused topical and narrative tracks.</p><p>
    The pieces here run a larger gamut of topics than the shit-talking he mastered on <i>Operation: Doomsday</i>.
    Situations faced by our favorite masked rhymer this side of '93 Ghostface include the courtship of an
    underage girl (""Let Me Watch"" with Apani B. Fly Emcee), a drug deal gone horribly awry (""Lactose and
    Lecithin""), an argument with a Chinese restaurant owner (""Raedawn"") and the hilarious gunning down of a
    lame open mic night.  While most underground emcees are content to rhyme about their intelligence, the
    evils of commercialism, and the general populace's lack of cognizance, Vik finds the perfect balance
    between complex songs and simple delivery, never hitting you with guilt trips or preaching to the choir.</p><p>
    There's no exaggeration made when you hear someone referring to Metal Face as one of the best writers
    in rap: ""Modern Day Mugging"" has Doom turning a tired theme like, well, robbing people from a ghetto
    cliché into a comedic spectacle, delivering a how-to for all aspiring thugs and thugettes: He only
    carries a .45 with ""no bullets, no clip"" that has ""black electrical tape over the hole in the handle""
    but still manages to cause a fellow citizen to ""run his chain like an errand.""  After detailing clever
    break-in methods, he plays the fall guy, getting shot by one of his elderly victims and claiming that he
    ""woulda let her have it if he had the ammo.""</p><p>
    In another example of Dumile's pen prowess, he teams up with former Anti-Pop Consortium rhymesayer M.
    Saayid for a cartoonish recollection of their education (""Never Dead"").  Doom claims, ""If I don't study,
    I'ma cheat off Peter Parker,"" and then teams up with schoolmate Saayid to run and gun on a search for
    Doom's stolen <i>Donkey Kong</i> game.  Throughout the course of the song, they buy fireworks and indulge
    in Guyanese strippers in Chinatown, and Doom finds a guru who teaches him ""that the roach is never dead,""
    hypothetically cultivating the future super scientist on which this album is based.  Songwriting doesn't
    often come this lush, detail-minded or captivating in hip-hop these days, but it's no surprise that the
    best songs in the genre are coming from an 80s transplant that claims to be ""a really big fan of Dan
    Aykroyd.""</p><p>
    As expected on an album from one of the current greats, the soundscapes on <i>Vaudeville Villain</i> fail
    to keep pace with the classic lines being dropped left and right.  This is Doom's first album consisting
    entirely of guest productions, and it quickly becomes apparent that he sounds better over his own work.
    Relatively unknown producers King Honey, Max Bill, and Heat Sensor offer a cohesive sound, but fail to
    really hit on a mood that suits Doom's drunken master assault.  But there are moments where it all comes
    together brilliantly: Heat Sensor's ""Raedawn"" is an electronic burner that writhes and lurches like a
    malfunctioning robot, stuttering out from of a pit of molten drums and sinister bells.  King Honey's
    ""Let Me Watch"" is a pier-walking rock-skip across the ocean, equipped with a lumbering, Prince Paul-ish
    jazz loop and bassline.  Rjd2 also drops by with the album's showstopper: ""Saliva"" delivers a triumphant
    string section, jubilant vocal sample, and bombastic horns across a subtle breakbeat backdrop.</p><p>
    Despite its admittedly slight flaws, <i>Vaudeville Villain</i> goes head-to-head with Doom's other 2003
    project, King Geedorah's <i>Take Me to Your Leader</i>, for what stands as the hip-hop album of the year
    thus far.  Unless his collaboration with Madlib (MadVillain) or his official MF Doom LP on Rhymesayers
    prove to be flawless ventures, this album will come out not just among the year's greatest, but also
    among the best in his catalog.</p></div>"|8514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8514-vaudeville-villain/|9.1|Rollie Pemberton

    elements of the previously mentioned artists, along with rhyming capabilities reminiscent of Ras Kass and
    Canibus.  Now, with the release of his second politically charged mission statement, <i>Revolutionary Vol. 2</i>,
    his gruff Latin baritone and powerful delivery have thrust him into the fortunate position of being a
    potential ""next big thing.""</p><p>
    
    Born in a military hospital in South America and sent to jail for more than a year for an altercation with
    a white man, IT's hoodlum mentality seems slightly more authentic than most anyone else in the underground
    (baring Bumpy Knuckles). Referencing biblical passages with the emotion of someone who reads and believes
    them (unlike Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks), IT is somehow believable in his radical position.</p><p>
    
    Whether rapping about the dark atmosphere of his adopted hometown (""Harlem Streets""), questioning the true
    nature of the artist's voice (""Freedom of Speech""), airing his issues with the media (""The 4th Branch"") or
    simply claiming to be ""the best of both worlds/ Without the hidden camera and the 12-year-old girl""
    (""Obnoxious""), Immortal Technique's magnetic delivery makes every song a joy to listen to. Criticizing
    critics, coffee shop revolutionaries, Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, John Ashcroft and George W. Bush, Technique
    delivers his message with a more commercially palatable hip-hop approach than Mr. Lif, if with less tact
    and subtlety.</p><p>
    
    A standout track is the mic-passing drug narrative ""Peruvian Cocaine"". Featuring Pumpkinhead, Diabolic and
    Poison Pen, among others, each rapper takes the place of someone different in the drug trafficking industry.
    From field worker to drug dealer to government official, each character expounds upon a common topic in one
    of the most excellent collaborations this side of the hip-hop world. The best verses come from the greatest
    flow in underground hip-hop, Tonedeff (""Come on, our fucking home was built on a foundation of bloody
    throats/ The hungry stolen of their souls, of course this country's running coke""), and the newest Def
    Jukie, C-Rayz Walz (""So enjoy the rush, live plush off coke bread/ Soon, you'll be in the cell with me
    like Jenny Lopez"").</p><p>
    
    The only downside to Immortal's myriad song styles is the lack of charisma contained in his battle
    incarnation. On a song like ""Obnoxious"", meant to break the ice and display an IT track that you (yes,
    <i>you</i>) can put on at a party without being dragged behind a truck, he sounds ridiculously awkward.
    With a lame ""We keepin' it live!"" refrain, a relatively boring saloon boom-bap beat and an uninteresting
    ""Wanksta""-parodying third verse, his obvious crossover cut (dope lyrics withstanding) fails at its purpose.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately for Mr. Technique, the beats (Beat Bandits, Domingo, Omen, Southpaw) are hit-and-miss, running the gamut from
    the subtle, watery acoustic guitar and disturbingly common drums of ""The 4th Branch"" to the addictive, bouncy
    Beatnuts-styled romp of ""Freedom of Speech"" to the unpleasant electronic chimes and hues of ""The Cause of
    Death"". More often than not, the drums end up sounding out of place on the chosen sample or the samples
    themselves sound cheap. Most of the time, the backdrops are simply overpowered by Technique's voice.  Suffice
    to say, this Public Enemy clearly does not have a Bomb Squad behind him.</p><p>
    
    Still, with Roc Raida, Jean Grae, Akir, and political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal (!) aiding their voices (and
    scratches) to this album, and his own worthwhile vocal presence adding another soldier to the political
    emcee barracks, Immortal Technique's second album is a testament to the power of the independent voice
    in music. Although he tends to go overboard with the violent braggadocio (""Fuck you/ I hope someone you
    love dies""), could cut back on the skits and random shit-talking, and tighten up the production, his
    message still breaks through the issues to prove him one of the most promising new emcees in underground
    hip-hop.</p></div>"|4146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4146-revolutionary-vol-2/|7.4|Rollie Pemberton

    peripheral circumstances surrounding a record begin to supercede the actual songs, and crooner Rosie
    Thomas has enough well-documented, extraneous quirks to distract just about anyone from the song-to-song
    content of her sophomore album.</p><p>
    
    It started in 2002, when Thomas' debut, <i>When We Were Small</i>, inadvertently introduced the world to
    her adjacent career as a stand-up comic with a Kaufman-esque alter ego named Shelia; Shelia takes the form
    of a seriously bespectacled and neck-braced pizza delivery woman, self-consciously dorky and entirely
    outside the scope of typical singer/songwriter shenanigans (Shelia even has her very own cover band,
    Strawberry Jam).</p><p>
    
    Presumably, the idiosyncratic pretension of Thomas' ""Shelia"" is perplexing enough to balance out her
    internal artistic palette-- because the other, singer/songwriter half of Thomas' creative repertoire is
    almost painfully straightforward and, incidentally, not the slightest bit funny.  Check the underwhelming
    realization that once you tear the external oddities away from Thomas' career, you will also watch all
    the intrigue slowly seeping out.  Conversely, <i>Only With Laughter</i> actually becomes sorta interesting,
    simply because it's so intensely benign within the context of Rosie Thomas, Performer.</p><p>
    
    It's not that the album isn't a solidly crafted, fully realized work: <i>Only With Laughter Can You Win</i>
    is delicately assembled and impeccably sung, all sweet, earnest folk and peaceably strummed acoustic guitar.
    It's just that the record is pure Joni Mitchell-but-not, a heartbreakingly predictable singer/songwriter
    collection with every requisite part in place, and not a single surprise: shine some Lilith Fair folk-rock
    through an indie lens, add some overtly sentimental verses and a rose-littered cover, record it inside a
    historic church in Detroit (St. John's, which, like, of course dates back to 1860), and see Rosie Thomas
    emerge, understated and introspective, singing lots of sad and pretty songs.</p><p>
    
    The formula here is pretty clear-cut: tinkling piano, barely-there drums, strummy guitar, and Thomas'
    expressive, padded whispers relaying all her earnestly held secrets, fears, and dreams.  ""I Play Music""
    sees Thomas' mother, father, sister, and brothers harmonizing along with her (the subsequent chorus is
    full, pleasant, and lilting, but also just precious enough to make some folks cough on their chamomile
    tea), while ""Crazy"", Thomas' swan song to confusion (""Crazy/ Crazy is what they've all said/ Craziness
    lives in my head/ Craziness lies in my bed"") sees her solo vocals at their expressive best.</p><p>
    
    Enjoyment of <i>Only With Laughter</i> seems inextricably hinged on how high your threshold is for this
    kind of thing-- despite being a nice showcase for Thomas' clear, pitch-perfect coo and soft-songwriting
    knack, the record is exhaustively familiar, offering up all the gentle greatness of folkies past, but
    refusing to impose its own reinterpretations.</p></div>"|8021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8021-only-with-laughter-can-you-win/|5.4|Amanda Petrusich

Cloyingly
    labeled as a ""pharmaceutical hallucinogen,"" a handful of pills opened portals to the most intense,
    frighteningly realistic phantasms I've ever experienced.  One symptom of overdose, as the Pharmaceutical
    Handbook explained so succinctly the morning after, was that every electrical appliance malfunctioned in
    my presence: the LCD displays on my watch and alarm clock were helpless brambles of blinking bars of
    broken time.  The carpet breathed and rippled its fibers.  The walls sweated.  I continually had the
    physical sensation of having something clenched in my grip, yet looking down, my hands were always empty.</p><p>
    I bring this trip up because I think the Double Leopards (Mike, Maya, Marcia, and Chris) might have ingested
    the same shit.  At the very least, they show similar symptoms on their second album for Eclipse.  Housed in
    a dark and heavy sleeve, replete with an Indian skull and foreboding forest branches, it opens into a
    gatefold that evokes a satellite dish-addicted Bridget Riley illusion.  <i>Halve Maen</i> is sprawled
    across two heavy discs, the only format through which the finest, most oblique musical messages can
    properly be conveyed.  I am tempted to shove this in alongside such shadowy double albums as Wickham &amp;
    Young's <i>Lake</i>, The Dead C's <i>Harsh 70s Reality</i>, Charalambides' <i>Market Square</i>, and
    Twenty-Six's <i>This Skin Is Rust</i>, but even those gave you a little breathing room now and then;
    <i>Halve Maen</i> smothers all light from the get-go as it burrows into the bowels of the earth below.</p><p>
    Very tactile from the first needle-drop, the everyday objects at the old loft space move of their own
    volition, at the edges of the feverish eyes.  Household items like chord organs, plastic toys, and wind
    chimes suddenly lurch to the fore during ""The Fatal Affront"", before all the room's paraphernalia
    disintegrates into the more solemn and murky affair, ""Druid Spectre"".  Here appears a drum more akin to
    the undead pounding at a cardboard door, somehow thudding along from beyond the grave with an elongated
    guitar.</p><p>
    Side B gets swallowed by ""A Hemisphere in Your Hair"", which is time enough for a perm or other long scalp
    treatment.  On this track, time is stretched and lulled until finally being rendered meaningless, and the
    listening brain is melted in slow undulations of sinewaves, primitive swirls of effects, bowed strings,
    prayer bowls, Melodica, and otherworldly drones.  Small shivers of cricket-like feedback rise and fall
    with the slow, labored breathing of the beast, as if the inhaled pink goo from <i>The Abyss</i> were
    replaced with Graffix bong scrapings.  The rattles that arise nearer the center of the spindle give the
    proceedings the woozy feel of an ancient ceremony coming to an end.</p><p>
    Turns out we're only halfway there, though, and from this point forth, the travail gets veritably muddy,
    the group dynamic verging on unconsciousness.  Discombobulation and a heavy, pervasive dread of being
    very lost permeates this record.  ""The Forest Outlaws"" spins the tape, mid-séance, into a paralyzing
    bout of self-inflicted ether damage.  A blustery white-noise wind blows through the bundled layers of
    guitar and organ, freezing up the gears on the Leopards' zamboni right at the inner-circle of the inferno,
    where it's always most frigid and frightening.</p><p>
    The last side is given over to ""The Secret Correspondence 1 &amp; 2"", plopping us into the vertiginous tides
    of the Dead Sea, where the silty, unseen bottom is stirred up something fierce.  Cymbals are struck but
    quickly sink below the briny waters.  Tremors of ghostly orchestras are constantly conjured by the guitars,
    a mass grave of vindicative strings that howl and die only to be resurrected for the finale.  The instruments
    and processed moans of the group commune with a far more surly and slurred spiritual world than previously
    glimpsed, heavily sedated and hovering with a menacing glint just at the threshold of sanity.</p><p>
    As it all slips away at record's end, I'm left questioning the mental stability and half-life of this trip.
    What I believed to be firmly in my grasp slithered away, a disquieting residue left behind on my hands and
    in my eyes and ears.  Overwhelming in its morose synesthesia and downright bleary at times, <i>Halve Maen</i>
    is like those little yellow pills I popped so long ago: Ingestion will definitely fuck you up.</p></div>"|2513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2513-halve-maen/|8.2|Andy Beta

This isn't the kind
    of question one might usually ask, but it's one that's been rudely thrust upon me by The Suntanama, a
    platoon of New Yorkers who fancy themselves the second coming of the Allman Brothers.  The Allmans were
    always the best of the Southern Rockers-- the way they mixed in jazz and a good degree of strong, concise
    songwriting easily set them apart from their peers-- but The Suntanama don't have any of the sense of craft
    or impact that their predecessors did.</p><p>
    
    The title of this album should tell you all you need to know: <i>Another</i>.  That's all it is, really;
    another Suntanama album, nearly as formless and muddled as the self-titled trainwreck they released last
    year.  There are improvements to be found on the band's sophomore disc, certainly-- vocalist Darren Zoltowski
    is only inhumanely irritating on a <i>couple</i> of songs, for instance-- but by and large, it's the same
    old dreck.  Guitars that should be delivering incisive solos wander aimlessly, searching for melodic contour
    (this time with more delay!), and a competent rhythm section wastes itself backing a band that forgets to
    write a melody every time.</p><p>
    
    Zoltowski has mellowed considerably in the year since The Suntanama debuted on an unsuspecting world-- last
    year's model was an entirely unintelligible, gravel-throated bleat; this year, he's settled down to the
    point where he's almost gotten around to singing real melodies, and even reaches for a Bob Dylan bark at
    times, usually even pronouncing the words he's singing.  The band also works itself into enough of a
    focused frenzy at the end of ""The 3 of 3's"" that his multitracked shouting sounds kind of good for a few
    seconds.</p><p>
    
    The more I listen to these guys, the harder it gets to tell if their ineptitude is unintentional or
    calculated-- they seem almost afraid of riffs and hooks, and the way they run away from anything interesting
    that starts to arise from their listless jamming makes it feel like some post-ironic joke only the band is
    in on.  While <i>Another</i> isn't quite as horrific as their first album, it's only marginally better,
    and just as forgettable.</p></div>"|7595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7595-another/|3.8|Joe Tangari

I can tell you that I'm getting tired of opening
    jazz reviews with a survey of the genre's problems.  In the end, it's probably no worse off than any other
    music predating rock and roll, and that it at least still has a Grammy category should be encouraging.
    Perhaps the only real problem is that big labels have a tough time marketing it (see if you can name any
    one of <i>Billboard</i>'s current Top 40 jazz albums).  However, unlike, say, contemporary polka (also a
    tough sell, especially in our war-torn economy), people are still making interesting, creative statements
    in jazz.  For experimental music listeners, jazz is probably as vibrant now as it ever was.  You just have
    to live with a dimmer spotlight, if that matters.</p><p>
    
    And so, along comes The Bad Plus, from the heart of the Midwest, and with big Columbia dollars paying for
    their hotels and, presumably, <i>Blender</i> blurbs.  They have the shiny blue CD cover, have snagged Sheryl
    Crow and Tom Waits' producer, get in-store promotion at Tower and Borders, and press releases that-- wouldn't
    you know it-- herald them as jazz's saviors!  Of course, none of this really covers the various musical
    contributions that pianist Ethan Iverson, bassist Reid Anderson, and drummer David King (a member of the
    Minneapolis jazz combo Happy Apple, and replacement drummer for the legendary Christopher McGuire in 12
    Rods) may have made to their own record.  As you probably shouldn't be surprised to know, their press
    hasn't really done them too many favors except to garner them raves from the NPR and <i>Good Morning America</i>
    crowd.</p><p>
    
    The three members of The Bad Plus, hailing from Minnesota and Wisconsin, have been playing together off
    and on since the early 1990s.  They released their self-titled debut in 2001 independently, and had a
    follow-up available last year (now out of print), recorded live at the Village Vanguard.  They've steadily
    built a following of fervent jazz fans and alert critics, though are likely as surprised at their exposure
    this year as anyone.  <i>These Are the Vistas</i>, beyond the production and fanfare, is pretty squarely
    along the lines of much new, young straight-ahead jazz: integrated use of new beats and electronic music
    touches, covers of various Gen-X hits, and the will to sporadically launch brief, free improv blowing
    sessions.  Naturally, those sessions are much fewer and farther between than your average Tim Berne disc,
    but then again, Columbia doesn't invest in 20-minute Bloodcount tunes for a reason.</p><p>
    
    First, the covers: supposedly pianist Iverson had never heard the song previously (only in Wisconsin, folks),
    but the trio's rendition of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is, er, spirited.  Iverson favors broad, dramatic
    chord clusters and liberal use of his sustain pedal, so instead of ragged rock glory, we get faux-cinematic\
    grandeur.  Anderson does a nice Ron Carter impression underneath, linking the performance to what must have
    been a big inspiration for them: Miles Davis' mid-60s similarly eccentric quintet.  They hit Aphex Twin's
    ""Flim"" with kid gloves, almost too delicately.  Producer Tchad Blake incorporates a few filters to make
    King's drums sound computerized, but it's my feeling that you can't really hide a jazz band.  Their version
    of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" is probably the most ambitious song on the entire record, if only because
    they try out about three completely different moods before arriving at the song proper.  I'm not so sure
    they're as convincing way out there as they are straight up, but points for giving it a go.</p><p>
    
    The Bad Plus is at their best when they step out of the jazz chair entirely, as on the marvelously kinetic
    ""Big Eater"", which opens the album.  King is an amazing drummer, certainly a treat for anyone loving modern
    jazz percussionists like Ben Perowsky, Kenny Wollesen or Jim Black, and his performance on Anderson's piece
    is fantastically, aggressively precise.  Likewise, Iverson's block chords, serving as melody, are straight
    out of the great-lost post-rock riff book, and would undoubtedly make Tom Jenkinson mighty jealous.  If
    only they could keep up that intensity throughout, as other tunes seem either flat homages to the avant-garde
    (""Boo-Wah""), or small-group MOR jazz balladry (""Silence is the Question"")-- though there is a download-only
    ballad titled ""What Love is This"" that's a lot more engaging than most of the ones here.</p><p>
    
    Marketing aside, I wouldn't be surprised to see The Bad Plus become pretty successful.  They have a knack
    for hitting the melody where some more experimental outfits might opt for a diverse array of craziness.
    The three performers are also very good musicians (particularly King and Anderson), and I imagine they put
    on a good show.  It's not their fault some record company guy thought they could be the new face of jazz,
    so I'd urge hipsters to keep an open ear, and everyone else not to expect fireworks.  Hey, it could be
    worse-- you know Elvis Costello is giving Diana Krall Mitchell Froom's number.</p></div>"|1074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1074-these-are-the-vistas/|7.0|Dominique Leone

    From a distance, Beam's lo-fi compositions sounded like a Harry Smith field recording plucked away by Nick
    Drake with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash on backup. But close up it was all about the poetry: concrete, ambiguous,
    and laced with tender irony. Since Beam compares himself to J.J. Cale, and I'd even compare his lyrical
    style to Beck's Apollinaire-grade symbolism on <i>Mutations</i>, maybe it's not so weird that he's on
    Nirvana's label after all.</p><p>
    
    ""I think I work with the visual a lot when I write,"" the part-time musician and full-time Miami film teacher
    once said. And <i>The Creek Drank the Cradle</i> was unabashedly concrete, studded with disarming pick-up
    lines like, ""The water's there to warm you/ And the earth is warmer/ When you laugh,"" and, ""Needlework and
    seedlings/ In the way you're walking."" Its songs also sank into little moments still warm with loss-- small
    enough to get inside you, but general enough to fill you with an after-the-fact numbness recognizable as
    love. Mothers lost sons, daughters lost fathers, lovers lost love, and each song somehow contained a bit
    of each.</p><p>
    
    Strikingly, the singers on <i>The Creek Drank the Cradle</i> keep losing their religion, too: outgrowing
    the bonds of belief, losing their fear of the Lord, letting their mothers' bibles burn. One of them even
    looks back to see a long-extinct love as a kind of unrecoverable faith: ""Found your rosary broken to pieces/
    Every night by the bed you'd kiss the beads.""  Still, the crucifixion is the greatest myth of loss we have,
    and it's no shock that a lyricist soaked in southern allegory should adapt it for his own purposes. There's
    even a defiantly un-Christian ring to resurrection one-liners like, ""Frozen, the ground refused to die/ And
    the guitar rose again.""</p><p>
    
    But while the textures, tempos, and diction of the five short songs on <i>The Sea &amp; The Rhythm</i> EP are
    consistent with what Iron &amp; Wine has been-- and probably will always be-- the theme of loss has itself gone.
    In its place, Beam pushes trembling expectation, ecstatic abandon, and plain-faced repentance. Now, not one
    of these faded songs screams old-time religion, but it seems fair to wonder if there is a little revival
    going on here.  ""Beneath the Balcony"" is a loping folk ballad telling the grim story of a warrior reduced
    to begging while some kids wait out a storm and ""make sure the king won't grant the dead man one more day.""
    At this point, it's an ambiguous parable with a crypto-Christian vibe worthy of C.S. Lewis. But when the
    Mother Mary appears begging with Christ on her lap, there's no question we're dealing with a gospel story.
    The song ends with a kid crouched behind a garbage can ""who waits for the king to come/ And holds his
    sweating hand."" Salvation, anyone?</p><p>
    
    The super-sweet title track, a hymn to sensual connection, is driven by its rare present-tense setting, but
    still sags. It draws its force from an ambiguity (is the ""we"" here lover/lover or mother/infant?) all a
    little too cheaply bought by come-ons like, ""The milk from your breast is on my lips."" Maybe the singer
    gets off by playing baby Jesus with grown women. Or maybe I just had to get a Jesus reference in for every
    song. At least I won't have to try for the last two.</p><p>
    
    The next track is a parable of sin and redemption masquerading as a nursery rhyme. Some Mexican kid--
    called, you guessed it, Jesus-- was born in a truck on the fourth of July. A mobile manger for an American
    nativity scene. With fireworks blooming above like a star in the East, this selfless little immigrant gives
    the singer the best playing card in his grubby little deck. Such a pure act opens a space for Beam's
    trademark muffled irony, the kind of brutal understatement common on the LP but up to now absent on this
    EP: ""He never wanted nothing I remember/ Maybe a broken bottle if I had two."" Jesus covers for the singer,
    lets him break a five-dollar bet, and generally assumes his sins. Then, in an oddly specific twist, when
    the singer succumbs to temptation by secretly eloping to Vegas with Jesus' sister, the beatific child-god
    is there to greet them: ""Naked, the Judas in me/ Fell by the tracks but he lifted me high/ Kissing my head
    like a brother and never asking why.""  Unmistakably salvific.</p><p>
    
    The last track goes down easy but is extremely hard to digest. ""Someday the Waves"" opens with a man waking
    at dawn to look down on his lover's face in wonder. The chorus seems like a sober display of faithfulness
    (""You pick a place that's where I'll be"") until some cryptic and perverse forbearance slips in,
    Matthew-style: ""Time, like your cheek, has turned for me."" This could mean a number of things: the singer
    is marking time by his sleeping lover's tossing and turning; the lover's pallid complexion means the singer
    is running out of time; or, as the lover has patiently taken a beating, the singer has simply gotten older.
    The next verse promises a pie-in-the-sky day of redemption when ""every aching old machine will feel no
    pain,"" but neglects to follow through with a credible image of relief.</p><p>
    
    It's the last verse that adds an oddly appropriate twist: ""Waking before you I'm like the Lord/ Who sees
    his love though we don't know."" Sure, it's a simile, but if you think about it, Sam Beam would make a great
    Holy Spirit. With a full-length album out by next Easter, he's got this Jew's vote for American Jesus in
    2004.</p></div>"|4125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4125-the-sea-and-the-rhythm-ep/|8.4|Jascha Hoffman

From Radiohead's
    voyages into squiggly experimentation and beatmongering, to the current Rapture school of hiring
    producers to apply a timely lacquer of club sauce, such acts are celebrated for their admirable
    attempts at forward-thinking.  But what of the inverse-- the electronic acts giving rock music a
    whirl?  Is this equally inspired genre hopscotch, or musical devolution?</p><p>
    
    Well, I'm sure it could qualify as either, depending on what the artists achieve, but for Death in
    Vegas, it's the latter.  Adhering to what must be formal guidelines set by the electronic music
    industry, Death in Vegas exist as a duo, and have ever since the height of the electronic boom in
    the mid-to-late 1990s.   The band made their American name with the Woodstock-sampling, K-Tel
    <i>Lost Hits of the Alternative Era</i> candidate ""Dirt"" back in 1997 (the video was much more
    interesting than the song), but from there, they attempted a more hybridized sound-- 1999's <i>The
    Contino Sessions</i> took aim at territory mapped by Primal Scream earlier in the decade.</p><p>
<i>Scorpio Rising</i> continues along that asymptote towards a supposed ""organic"" sound, going light
    on the laptop and heavy on the relics of yesteryear: drums, basses, and guitars.  In fact, if not for
    Death in Vegas' faceless DJ anonymity and a couple of characteristic electronic facets (the implementation
    of a few choice samples; a roster of Brit-centric celebrity guest vocalists including Paul Weller, Hope
    Sandoval, and Liam Gallagher), one might assume that the outfit responsible for this album was just a
    band with a hefty case of <i>NME</i>-approved 60s psych nostalgia.</p><p>
    
    Which makes sense: If psychedelic rock begat the trance/dance of the 90s rave scene, it's not much of a
    stretch to figure that Death in Vegas would naturally come out sounding pretty Summer of Love if given
    the Altered States treatment.  Brother Liam's appearance on the title track might as well be subtitled
    ""Setting Sun Pt. 2"", placing Gallagher in a comfortable zone of ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" drum loops and
    backwards guitar.  It's familiar, right down to the awful lyrics (""I wanna go to heaven, never been there
    before""), but refreshingly direct-- closer to <i>Definitely Maybe</i> form than the pretentious bloat of
    recent Oasis.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Paul Weller gets a paisley backdrop of his own, lending a chesty vocal to ""If You Say You Lost
    Your Baby"" that does well to approximate a roided-up <i>Forever Changes</i>, while slower material engages
    in grandiose displays of Indian-inflected orchestration, conducted by the mysteriously Bond-villain-sounding
    Dr. Subramaniam.  Two of these (the banjo-and-mandolin-contrasted ""Killing Suite"" and the droning ""Help
    Yourself"") feature former Mazzy Star crooner Hope Sandoval, and your appreciation of such is probably
    directly proportional to your nostalgia for ""Fade Into You""-type atmospheric noir.</p><p>
    
    It's telling, of course, that the most appealing track on <i>Scorpio Rising</i> is what appears to be the
    token handout to the dance world: a slice of straight electro called ""Hands Around My Throat"" that samples
    Tortoise and also, somehow, ""Rock Around the Clock"".  With much of the rock arrangements ill-suited to
    Death in Vegas' club-honed compositional sensibilities, tracks like ""Leather"" and ""Girls"" striking a groove
    but never fully cresting, the stiff rhythms and deadpan delivery (from Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus) of ""Hands
    Around My Throat"" are well supported, rather than overwhelmed, by some additive live drumming and clanging
    guitar.</p><p>
    
    So while the two hearts of Death in Vegas are firmly in the right place, given that some of the biggest
    electronic hits have been from DJs hewing their sound to a rock standard, the execution is ultimately
    flawed.  Perhaps the duo is just second-tier to begin with, or perhaps they just let the needle swing too
    far towards the rock side of the dial, but the peak moments on <i>Scorpio Rising</i> offer little more than
    enjoyable nostalgia for overhead-projector light shows.  It may be no more embarrassing than any of the
    rock-band-in-electronic-clothes attempts sure to be thrust upon us in the coming months, but it's clear
    Death in Vegas don't have the recipe to the magic rock/electronic stew we've all been told to save our
    dancefloor moves for.</p></div>"|2235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2235-scorpio-rising/|6.4|Rob Mitchum

    of my more pressing concerns about its few faults out in the open.  First, the name: ""A Trillion Barnacle
    Lapse"" sounds like it was on special from Cedric Bixler's catalog of meaningless non-sequitur bullshit,
    and is the sort of name likely to get your record laughed at and then not bought.  In fact, I'll go on
    record as saying that any bandname with ""barnacle"" in it is practically pleading to be ignored; I don't
    care if you're from Rhode Island (where there are at least two barnacles for every man, woman, and child,
    I'm told by reliable sources, but certainly not a trillion).  Second, no matter how good it sounds, any
    American who tries to sound British when singing is subconsciously asking to be beaten up.  Even Bob
    Pollard; that he managed to build a career on this is still one of the most enduring enigmas in rock.</p><p>
    
    But I digress-- having purged the, like, negative energy from my aura, I can get back to the business at
    hand: giving this Rhode Island five-piece a fraction of the praise they deserve.  It's a testament to the
    solidity of <i>Black Lava</i> that the biggest complaints I can muster concern silly, superficial vagaries;
    ATBL have the rare skill to nakedly assimilate their direct sonic ancestors, succumb to a little bit of
    posing excess, and still come out way ahead.</p><p>
    
    It might sound needlessly dismissive to say that ATBL is barely more than The Faint as fronted by Mark E.
    Smith, but while the combination may be structurally facile, it's also entirely ingenious, and the
    description is apt.  The Faint's synth-heavy electro melodrama is tempered perfectly by a monotonous,
    droning sneer worthy of the acclaimed Fall frontman, creating a truly schizophrenic album.  The vocals
    struggle constantly with bipolar backing arrangements of vintage blips and bleeps and hollowed-out
    piano rolls, guitars that fall in sheets in time with pulsing, breakneck rhythms, always too subdued
    for the periods of turmoil, too accusatory, too coldly commanding for the moments of docility.  The songs
    should suffer for this incongruity, but the effect is entirely the opposite; the music/vocal interweaving
    is almost humbling.  It's the distinct sensation of feeling alone in a crowd; keeping pace, moving in
    sync, but never quite blending in.</p><p>
    
    Ultra-minimal, Joy Division-esque bass steers ""Binary Roulette"" through countless tempo shifts and melodies
    as the rest of the instrumentation pulls in all directions simultaneously with irresistible, restless force.
    The steady, spitspoken vocals could offer an anchor, but instead stand apart from the chaos, watching the
    spiraling descent with measured indifference.  The music is entirely tangential; when it becomes too loud,
    it's simply shouted down.  The lyrics themselves are graphic to the point of dehumanization-- ""Little girls
    should/ Grow up to be/ Feminine-heterosexual/ With babies""-- and clinical to the point of sterility in a
    strangely personal tale of gender ambiguity.  ""With the heat of his hand/ He erased/ One leg of one 'X.'""
    The abstract is later broadened, reduced to the purely literal, forever holding the listener at arm's length
    with one hand while beckoning with the other.</p><p>
    
    As long as the vocal/music interplay is in effect, <i>Black Lava</i> is nothing short of amazing, but
    against the advice of counsel, they occasionally try to pretend that this dynamic isn't the core of the
    band and coast on instrumentals.  ""Beowulf... King of the Anglosaxons"" and ""Iron Lung"" could stand to
    make bigger impressions; without a combative vocal melody to wrestle with, the musical backing is relatively
    impotent.  These are fortunately brief, though; the fact is, solo vocals would fall just as flat.  It's the
    conflict that drives ATBL; all the odd affectations they adopt threaten to push the drama to emo-ish heights
    at times, but they always overcome.  If they can beat that name, nothing will stand in their way.</p></div>"|405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/405-black-lava/|7.8|Eric Carr

    all the poofy French musicians these days?  Sure, the Parisian electronica scene had its moment in the late
    90s, with Daft Punk, Air, Cassius, et al, producing worthy, if not groundbreaking, material, but who from
    those long-gone days of healthy Franco-American relations has released anything in years truly worth
    scuffing your retro Jordans over?  And while I'm at it, why does every critic with a guilty American
    conscience feel it necessary to play Lucky Pierre to any couple of Parisian (ahem) assholes with a 606
    emulator?  Wake the fuck up, dudes. Mirwais and Black Strobe haven't released any material much more
    substantial than your average coke-nosed electroclasher.</p><p>
    
    So here comes this Electronicat character, sauntering in to impress we Yanks with another set of guitar-rocking
    electro.  Thing is, the deafening hype accompanying virtually every single goddam dance-rock record released
    is starting to chafe, y'all-- it's time to charge ahead and accept that the looks-like-it-might-be-here-to-stay
    genre is already starting to excrete its share of sewage.  The steamer in front of me, <i>21st Century Toy</i>,
    comes courtesy of one Fred Bigot, a proud Frenchman with a predictably tired <i>nom de punk</i> that all but
    explains why he couldn't come up with a better recording alias than ""Electronicat.""</p><p>
    
    Much of the frustration here derives from the album's asinine simplicity.  I'm not saying all electronica
    needs to be complex-- see Casiotone for the Painfully Alone as an example of wrenching the most out of
    minimal gear and production, but it's, what, 2003, and hammering endlessly at the same distorted synth
    tone for an hour isn't gonna win anybody new friends.</p><p>
    
    Channeling the glam era on opener ""Tonight"", Bigot's vocals come off like a second-rate J Spacemen, fresh
    off the gear and just not fucking handling his shit. ""Tonight"" introduces a shrill, off-key synth midway
    through that mixes things up a bit, but for the most part, the track's Bolanist stance is about as good
    as things get.  ""Frisco Bay"" sets sub-Casio-preset backing to Digifuckery101 knob-twiddling, irritating
    female backing vocals, and some of the worst lyrics I've heard this year.  (I'd quote them but I seriously
    can't put myself through it.)  The ""best"" track here, ""Hoo Woo Woo"", evokes only the empty sentiment of its
    title; the worst, ""Till I Die"", is a mindless three-fingers-on-a-keyboard ditty notable only for the
    outrageous gall it had to lift its title from one of Brian Wilson's final masterpieces.</p><p>
    
    Electronicat would probably appreciate if <i>21st Century Toy</i> was noticed by the hungry masses for its
    disco-cum-<i>Nuggets</i> hero worship.  But while champions of the record (may you all burn in hell) might
    endorse its 60s-revivalist rock influence as a welcome change from the early 80s-leaning post-punk most
    commonly associated with rock-dance unions, the fact is, there's a reason the latter period synchronizes
    so well with modern electronic production-- most of the post-punk bands invoked in the rock element of
    the equation already had more than a trace of funk injected into their icy artsiness. Compared to the
    Rapture or !!!, this stuff just doesn't cut the filthy-smelling cheese Bigot surely enjoys after a
    grueling two hours' work in the studio.  I'm sure plenty of folks will congratulate themselves for being
    so fucking cool while listening to this record, but I must admonish you, young hipster: When it comes to
    getting your dance-punk freak on, buy American.</p></div>"|2893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2893-21st-century-toy/|3.5|Bob O. McMillan

And why can't technically competent
    musicians write songs as well as they can play their instruments?  There are bands like The Kinks who--
    let's face it-- were far from the most technically adept in their field, yet have somehow left behind some
    of the most timelessly enjoyable and imminently relevant rock music artifacts.  Then there's a guy like
    Yngwie Malmsteen, whose technical proficiency exceeds that of every rock musician ever to exist-- maybe
    combined.  And how many Alcatrazz records do you own?</p><p>
    
    All too often, it seems technically proficient artists are their own worst enemies. Titillated by their
    own prowess, they compose music that showcases their chops but masks their humanity. It's a schtick that
    impresses but rarely inspires. There is a point, though, when some mathematically complex set of chords
    stops being impressed with itself and becomes a truly inspiring song, when a bushel of mind-numbing guitar
    riffs transcends its sonic masturbation and reaches an emotionally satisfying stratosphere. No one knows
    exactly where that point is, but we know when it's reached, and more importantly, we feel it when it's
    crossed.</p><p>
    
    Pretty Girls Make Graves' latest, <i>The New Romance</i>, crosses that point. The album exists in that
    scarcely inhabited rock-and-roll world where technical prowess coexists peacefully with clear and simple
    songcraft, the former never forgoing the latter.  Contrasting with <i>Good Health</i>'s cut-to-the-chase
    opener ""Speakers Push the Air"", ""Something Bigger, Something Brighter"" opens deliberately and confidently.
    Nick DeWitt taps away at his snare rim, haunting its vague militancy with the cannon-like blast of his bass
    drum. Twin guitars trade high-strung lilts, panning from left to right with each call and response.  For
    the sake of its title, the heretofore dark and subtle song does deliver something bigger and brighter:
    After an ominous dynamic increase, the band piles layers upon layers of beautiful, serpentine riffs.  For
    all its tonal and rhythmic complexity, <i>The New Romance</i> breathes with healthy lungs and a muscular
    diaphragm.</p><p>
    
    ""The Grandmother Wolf"" follows, a relentless parade of charged guitar lines that climax when DeWitt's drums
    go out with a whimper and vocalist Andrea Zollo sings an utterly breathtaking melody over sparse guitar
    punches. ""Mr. Club"" is a short transitional organ-and-drum piece that takes on immense significance with
    the entrance of a dark piano line that hints vaguely at what comes next.  And what does come next is quite
    possibly the best rock song I've heard this year: ""All Medicated Geniuses"" is the pinnacle of Pretty Girls
    Make Graves' technical abilities and songwriting.  Built upon a very subtle ring structure, each segment
    quadruples the intensity of the one before it.  The guitars just scream here, trading lines back and forth
    across the pan. DeWitt proves well beyond doubt that he's one of indie rock's most talented drummers, and
    certainly one of only a handful these days who plays his kit as an instrument and not merely as a timepiece.</p><p>
    
    ""Blue Lights"" adopts a post-rock approach, the band infusing more immediacy as the song builds to its climax.
    While it would be unfair to expect the lyrical charm of Dan Bejar or the clever wordplay of Colin Meloy from
    a band more interested in the aesthetics of rock than those of lyrics, it should be noted that ""Blue Lights""
    sports unfortunately atrocious lyrics.  Fortunately, ""Chemical Chemical"" quickly redeems the misstep, rivaling
    ""All Medicated Geniuses"" in intensity and structure, and maintaining the latter's visceral pull (if, perhaps,
    with less tonal depth).  ""Holy Names"" is the closest of the album's songs that come to being classified a
    ballad.  But while slower in tempo, there's certainly no lapse in intensity. The song builds for one part
    to a short-lived guitar scream reminiscent of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nic Zinner, and boasts one of album's
    most stunning moments.  Soon after, the band jumps into the album's title track, prominently featuring a
    few fantastic organ lines and a killer B-part break, replete with Zollo's catchy vocal hook.</p><p>
<i>The New Romance</i> is immediately impressive and gratifying, each subsequent listen unearthing an
    increasing number of underlying subtleties.  Each of Pretty Girls Make Graves' members have contributed
    110% here, and their ambitious zeal, coupled with their remarkable technical depth, has made for a utterly
    breathtaking full-length. One could almost analyze <i>The New Romance</i>'s many layers to the death, if
    the desire to air-guitar wasn't so damn distracting.</p></div>"|6464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6464-the-new-romance/|8.3|Nicholas B. Sylvester

On the surface, <em>Vol. II</em> is very much of a piece with its     predecessor, characterized by its by vast, quiet spaces, unhurried     compositions, and an overall sense of dread and despair. The instrumental     makeup is pretty much identical-- Connors is credited with guitars, tapes     and sounds-- and <em>Volume II</em> seems very much like a continuation.     But the details and proportions here have been shuffled, and if you get     down and listen closely enough, this a different kind of record.</p><p>The first thing you'll notice is that Connors spends a bit more time here on     the ""tapes"" and ""sounds"" and a bit less on the guitar. Field recordings form     the essential character of many tracks. The third track (no titles) has only     a strum or two of guitar and mostly consists of what sounds like a recording     of an abandoned field along the side of a busy highway.  You can hear the wind     through the long grass and the hum of traffic a little ways away, and can     almost see the decade-old rusted cans and yellow newspaper scraps tangled in     the scrubby underbrush. It's quite an evocative piece considering it was     probably recorded on a random afternoon on a Walkman.</p><p>The sixth track was recorded a bit further into the wilderness, across the     woods and into the forest, and this time, at dawn, complete with a cooing     mourning dove. The first track has a similarly rich ambient layer with a     more industrial bent, but quiet and in the distance. And over the noise     Connors layers his plucked, sustained, carefully laid notes.</p>
<p>On the tracks without field recordings <em>Departing of a Dream</em> feels     familiar. A melody tumbles from Connors' hands with hints of processing and     wah-wah to make a tone that bubbles up from some waterlogged dream. Once     again, Connors is a master of slow instrumental heartbreak, and if you're     in the wrong mood, this record can actually be painful to listen to. The     seventh track, for example, is a slow pan across a bombed-out landscape of     emotional devastation, all gurgly tone, bent notes, and shapeless melody.</p>
<p>The shorter eighth track, which closes this brief (31-minute) album, has a     warmer, sunnier cast, which somehow makes things even worse. The suggestion     of hope and renewal seems like a prelude to another shattering reality     somewhere in the blurry future. If you're sad and anxious you have a friend     in Loren Connors.</p>

    was hitting its stride, and he actually has more claim on the scene than
    you might assume.  After attending art school in New York, he spent five
    years in the 1980s playing with no-wave progressive Rhys Chatham and performing
    on most of the experimental legend's large-scale works, including 1987's
    <i>Die Donnergotter</i>.</p><p>
    
    Brovold's own music takes an approach of massed guitars and blunt ambience
    that's similar to Chatham's, but over the course of four albums with Larval
    appears to be rooted in something much more straightforward: rock.  Unlike
    virtually all the post-rock bands springing up three years in debt to Neu!,
    Brian Eno, and Miles Davis' <i>In a Silent Way</i>, Larval and Brovold opt
    for volumes suited for actual guitar players and beats Crazy Horse could love.
    It's not that their music is simple, but it's hardly as intimidating as their
    pedigree (avant-icon John Zorn is one of Larval's biggest fans, and released
    their first album as well as Brovold's 2001 solo album) might lead you to
    believe.</p><p>
    
    ""Something Terrible is About to Happen"" wheezes by like a hobbled steamboat
    in brown, filmy water.  Brovold has a knack for sickly textures, even when
    his band nudges the rock pedal-- and while I wouldn't say any of the tracks
    on <i>Obedience</i> are necessarily ugly, most of them revel in an earthy
    homeliness.  Here, Kurt Zimmerman's violin repeats a simple, rhythmic figure
    that wouldn't sound out of place opening one of Godspeed's signature epics--
    and indeed, the muffled drone of cello and guitar are very reminiscent of
    those Canadian radicals.</p><p>
    
    ""Her Last Good Day"" also trades muscle for grace, but does away with dread.
    Chiming, major-chord guitar fills out most of the mix with sunny, sentimental
    shimmer while Marko Smith's slightly off-kilter drumming paints a different,
    almost tragicomic picture.  Here more than anywhere else on the record, it's
    plainly evident that Larval would rather lend a more human presence to
    experimental rock than dazzle with electronic textures and virtuosic playing.</p><p>
    
    Where Larval differ from a band like Tortoise (to whom they could be thought
    of as a distant, haggard uncle) is in their adherence to symphonic dynamics
    that predate most 90s-originated post-rock.  Even though ""Something Terrible""
    emphasizes the more hypnotic and repetitive aspects of their sound, Larval are
    more closely related to the post-apocalyptic impressionism of King Crimson
    (see ""The Talking Drum"") than the krautrock and minimalism strategies of newer
    bands.  The good news for anyone who isn't quite ready to leap into the prog
    realm is that this band completely eschew solos, or any other flashy display
    of instrumental might.  Like Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca, Larval are only
    too willing to sacrifice the glory of the individual for a tightly wound whole.</p><p>
    
    My gripe with <i>Obedience</i> isn't really as much the music as it is the
    production, which doesn't always give these guys a fighting chance in an
    increasingly electronic realm.  For people used to the relatively explosive
    (or alternately, pristine) sound of new avant-rock, Larval could sound on
    the quaint side-- or worse, flat.  Nevertheless, perhaps through the power
    of persistence (the climax of ""One Day I Just Kept on Walking"" is fairly
    earth-shaking), they come out well.  Here's hoping they're on the radar for
    folks looking for ambience with a spikier approach.</p></div>"|4949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4949-obedience/|7.3|Dominique Leone

My grandfather frequently threatened to rescind
    the myriad generous bestowals my sister and I were to receive upon his passing if he ever heard we'd cast
    a Democratic vote.  Not a single female constituent in my family, from eight to eighty, dares miss Sunday's
    Service, and every bite on every plate is blessed before it's fit to ingest.  And despite medical evidence
    to the contrary, my Naval Academy-bred stepfather insists that a postprandial workday glass of Merlot rather
    ""puts the edge on.""  Not that I'm complaining; but at times I can't help but yearn for greener pastures.
    Maybe even just of a different shade.</p><p>
    Enter K.C. Accidental, brother-in-law to Broken Social Scene, and first and second cousin to such venerable
    assemblies as Do Make Say Think and A Silver Mt. Zion.  Alternating stints at the head of the table are
    Kevin Drew (of Do Make Say Think) and symphonious confederate Charles Spearin.  But at this sonic banquet
    everyone has a voice (even though no one opts to use theirs to actually sing on this record), as fellow
    <i>You Forgot It in People</i> alum Evan Cranely, James Shaw, and Emily Haines have contributed to the
    band.  As exhibited by the triumphant yet distinctive releases of this reputable sect, lineage doesn't
    necessitate a unilateral vision.</p><p>
    While <i>Captured Anthems for an Empty Bathtub</i> retains several of the elements accountable for the
    ascendancy of <i>You Forgot It in People</i>, it's the nuanced digressions from this work that are worth
    noting. ""Nancy and the Girdle Boy"" storms out of the gate with fierce kit work and churning guitar, both
    of an immediacy much greater than anything on Broken Social Scene's latest.  It's the most compact track
    on the album, but loosens in the end; like a chainsaw spinning down and shaking off the shavings.</p><p>
    The rest of the album
    is several degrees less demonstrative.  The post-rock homage ""We Wish We Lived in Chicago"" feels like an
    embryonic, if not slightly unwieldy, druggy jazz venture, and ""Anorexic He-Man"" harkens back to early Björk,
    employing a club-adaptive beat with almost trance-inducing persistence.  The dogged bass feels like it's
    resonating in from a neighborhood dance party down the street, or from your little brother's speakers next
    door.</p><p>
    At nine and twelve minutes respectively, ""Save the Last Breath"" and ""Tired Hands"" are truly accomplished
    utilizations of space and texture. The former casts out soft, light touches of piano, percussion, and
    guitar, almost as if the band is languidly waking up to the instruments they are themselves playing.  The
    song takes a breath and exhales, releasing all the dreamy tension it unconsciously harbored.  The latter
    number is a stark and stunning heart-on-sleeve realization with slowly constructed underpinnings of nervous
    energy that never escape, but merely claw and scratch and are finally stretched taut.</p><p>
    There are small missteps along the way; by turns too obdurate to be deferential to the whole and too
    adherent to convention to be as sonically adventurous as the potential here warrants.  The stock use of
    an answering machine on ""Kev's Message for Charlie"", though executed innovatively, disrupts the astral
    flow of the latter half of the album with unfortunate swiftness.  These, however, are mere paltry
    dissatisfactions.  With such a patient and often subtle offering, K.C. Accidental dance around the point
    a lot, but the glances in are glorious.  Not utopian, but at least fraternal to a thoughtful, egalitarian
    degree, I might be looking to see if any of them are looking to adopt.</p></div>"|4561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4561-captured-anthems-for-an-empty-bathtub/|7.4|William Morris

I don't envy them this
    task, attempting to keep the MTV generation from mentally wandering afield while they build their dense,
    slowly shifting textures from the ground up, relying only on slowly morphing dynamics to provide interest
    without any of the instant gratification provided by, say, melodies or riffs. Music like this is an old
    story by now-- it's the same formula Mogwai used to make your blood rush on <i>Young Team</i>, and the one
    King Crimson used to make your blood curdle on <i>Starless &amp; Bible Black</i>.  And while the San Francisco
    foursome never approach the heights those bands have ascended, they've played the law of averages for seven
    albums now to see if they one day might.</p><p>
    
    At this juncture, it seems that's a losing proposition, but you'd never know it from <i>Also Rising</i>'s
    portentous opening moments.  ""The Harsh Facts of Life"" lopes in on a percolating bassline and live drumbeat
    that might make a great hip-hop sample while spewing forth huge clouds of droning, e-bowed laser guitar
    and whipping up an ominous buzz that appears to come from all directions at once.  Where things go wrong
    from there is that there's no drama, no true climax to quicken your pulse-- rather, the beat gradually
    becomes choppier and the whole song downshifts in rhythmic intensity, dissolving into a fuzz-addled mudbath
    that doesn't fully wash off until a couple of tracks later.  This is where it first becomes clear that this
    music is mostly improvised-- you can hear the band trying to feel each other and anticipate the next move,
    but winding up following one another instead of shifting as a collective whole.</p><p>
    
    The texture that's laid out on that first song remains essentially static throughout the album's duration--
    e-bows rule the skies while Chris Van Huffel's drums blast out dry, punishing rhythm below.  Changes are
    mostly in the details: a little phaser on the guitars, or more ride cymbal in the drums, and the only way
    you're going to truly hear all of the subtleties is to crank the volume to neighbor-baiting levels and
    listen closely.  The only song that breaks the mold is ""Angel Food"", a drifting ambient wash bereft of
    percussion, all ethereal guitars processed beyond easy recognition-- it's not a coincidence that it's the
    best track on the album, as it's the only one fully suited by the drifting nature of the playing.</p><p>
    
    In all honesty, <i>Also Rising</i> is bound to put all but the most patient, attentive listeners out faster
    than a keg of Nyquil.  Improvised music, even music improvised within a strict framework, usually falls at
    some extreme of transcendence or listlessness, and this lies toward the second pole, a few notches better
    than listening to the neighborhood band jam in their practice space.  The end result is all one color, and
    ultimately just another instrumental rock album littering the landscape.</p></div>"|7699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7699-also-rising/|5.9|Joe Tangari

SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD! THIS IS THE MOST EXCRUCIATINGLY TREMENDOUSLY CLANGROUS DISASTER     PSYCHO-INFERNO SINCE THE GULF WAR AND A YOUNG NIC CAGE! This is what a Merzbow review circa the early     90s would have looked like. I remember briskly walking down the streets in the crisp air, seeing the     idle Merzbow-listeners in the cafes. There was an ineffable apprehension in the air. New Merzbow reviews     go like this: ""We heard this all a hundred times back in the 90s. It's tedious boringcore, alternating     between trivial and insufferable."" I saw a show where Merzbow played between Madlib and Sleater-Kinney     sets, and kids were sitting on the floor chatting, patiently waiting, painting their nails. I sympathize     with the position, but I can't adopt it.</p>
<p>Trey Parker once said the end of reality TV would only come when they started airing baby-fucking shows.     Once that show starts production, it will be viewers' fault, not the baby-fucker's. Merzbow is the aural     baby-fucker. Wherever your ideology lies on the experimental scale, and whatever your religious affiliation,     music cannot get much more extreme than this. Maybe John Cage's 4'33"", and that's so far to the limit, it's     probably cheating. This is the edge of music, of sound in general.</p>
<p>And now, here we are, confronted by the junction of a new album and the re-release of an incomparable     classic. It's a moment for reflection and memorialization, and respect for the battleaxes that have been     ensconced in our brains. In a lot of circles, 1996's <i>Pulse Demon</i> was one of the verifiable foundations     of noise, the final proof that the pythonic wall of sound was scalable. This is a gross overstatement, of     course, as journals from the Sixth Century also indicate the presence of noise, but it's not an entirely     deceitful one. It came after a string of near-apocalyptic releases that were far more severe and atrophic,     but also entertaining, heterogeneous, energizing, malleable.</p>
<p><i>Pulse Demon</i> is simply pure sound,     viciously unadulterated static. The earlier releases stimulated the imagination; <i>Pulse Demon</i> decimates it. It also has a bit of a beat that would be further dismantled in the succeeding years.     <i>Pulse Demon</i> is <i>Meet the Beatles</i>, where you start to understand Masami Akita's appeal before     the relentless experimentalism period. And, in this sense, the record is probably one of the most archetypal     Merzbow albums, the one most resolutely and incorrigibly reluctant to dilute itself with free jazz,     industrial, world, or musique concrete.</p>
<p>""Woodpecker No.1"" is a static abscess that at first overtakes some pathetic techno, and rises to a steaming     squalor that subsumes the rest of the track. ""Spiral Blast"" performs exactly what the title promises,     although the ""blast"" part seems to be the focus, instigating one of the most demented howls on record,     like the squeal from the JBs' ""The Grunt"" maximized to its most trembling, terrifying, cumbersome capacity.     The second half is even better. The last half of the half-hour-long ""Worms Plastic Earthbound"" is a brutally     drunken subterranean gunfight. All in all, seventy minutes that feel like driving an 18-wheeler made out of     concrete into a remedial course on nuclear winter. And there aren't even overdubs! Essential. Unimpeachable.     And the packaging by itself is already more valuable than some people's lives.</p>
<p>In these leadenly gray days, everything from Black Dice to Fennesz is being played on the campus radio and     it's easy to lose sight of what was truly revolutionary. And yet, even compared to the most recent Merzbow     releases, <i>Pulse Demon</i> will still slaughter innocent orphans in a fraction of a second. Case in point:     <i>Animal Magnetism</i>, one of the more approachable recent Merzbow releases. I can easily imagine someone     enjoying this album who doesn't even feign to enjoy masochism. On the titular track, the mix is muddled,     there are tinny beats in the surroundings, and the slow rise of a pseudo-melody. There are still static,     androids, and bondage, of course, but this is definitely a step closer to getting signed to Astralwerks.</p>
<p>""Quiet Men"" is a light, vivacious cartoon, making the sound Warner Bros. animals make when they spin around.     The first half of the album feels rather fluid. Whereas startling jaggedness is to be expected on a Merzbow     album, on <i>Animal Magnetism</i>, there's a continuity that observes evolution and decay. Unfortunately,     it's also less distinctive. ""Super Sheep"" tries to get some propulsion going, but the bassline is so     immediately familiar to the causal Alec Empire fan, it makes the distortion feel like a deleterious     contrivance Akita felt compelled to include at the last minute.</p>
<p>""A Ptarmigan"" is the most interesting     track, if not particularly exemplary. In twenty minutes, it's a parade in one section, a turgid dirge in     the next. ""Pier 39"" is an ambient, scraping anomaly that wouldn't be too out of place on a Boards of Canada     album. While it's perhaps the best recent Merzbow CD for newcomers, it's not a keystone in his canon. Still,     it's not nearly worthy of the horrendous dullness ascribed to it in the media in its first days of release.     And, even if it's not his best, it'll still be hilarious when all our dads get it thinking it's that old     album by The Scorpions. Maybe then Merzbow will finally be able to piss someone off.</p></div>"|11778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11778-pulse-demon-animal-magnetism/|8.7|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    Socialists United to Control or Kill Everyone Resistant to the Marxist Conspiracy. As you know, our efforts
    to inspire, provoke, or mandate revolution via the audio manipulists lumped under the label ""Americana"" have
    failed. I'm just as flummoxed about it as you all are; I mean, isn't ""folk"" a reference to ""the people,""
    like with Hitler's Ford-assisted, Jew-designed wagens? Surely some of these performers, we'd guesstimated,
    would hanker to wield a radical version of the ideological cannon that something called ""country music""
    regularly exploits in the interests of defense contractors and capital. We thought we had Wilco where we
    wanted them when they hooked up with SUCKERMC Billy Bragg to record honorary SUCKERMC Woody Guthrie's work,
    and even their later ""assassin down the avenue"" line sounded like our mode of subversion, but alas, they've
    careened off into lovesongism and dilettantish wordplay.</p><p>
    
    Centro-Matic has not responded to our commissioning a rebuttal to John Cougar's ""Ain't That America"" entitled
    ""That Ain't America"". One would think that a group whose press materials tout their ""working class hero""
    status would long for some realism. Our enemies in SWASS (Subtle Workforce of American Sentimentality and
    Superstition), obviously got through to this quartet, because their approach and lyrics have fallen sway
    to emoting and obliquery. I was willing to give the album a chance based on the democratic/humanistic
    principles espoused in its title, and because of the stompy and marchy, prole-rousing percussion work,
    but this band has become prey to mainstream America's sappy What-Would-Seabiscuit-Do ethos. Songs emerge
    about midshipmen, cables, and corrals, but their industrial plights are (sigh) all fictional. Singing
    about false struggles smacks of a poseurdom on par with the rappers who fabricate criminal fantasias set
    in unsurvivably savage burgs.</p><p>
    
    And the music press are continuing to misprioritize album-shopping over uprising. Peer at what a ""William
    Bowers"" blurted at Pitchforkmedia.com on the second anniversary of the September 11th attacks, perpetuating
    the website's info-dumping, band-reffing aesthetic: ""Ever-prolific Texan, frontman of South San Gabriel,
    and solo artist Will Johnson leads Centro-Matic to their best set yet. Johnson's lyrics shed their iffily
    free-associative Pollardism and come into their irascible own. These resonant fables of half-loved underdogs,
    essentially preposterous scenarios reported with apocalyptic seriousness, call to mind the last two Flaming
    Lips discs, and let's just say that the manifest similarity between the bleatings of Will Johnson and Wayne
    Coyne are serendipitous, not calculated. A few of the Wilconic tones are derivative (but that's not a
    complaint), and the band hugely rawks here in an unprecedented approximation of their live show, often
    summoning the moldy hearts of Mould and Hart (though someone down the hall from me mistook their
    professionalism and competence for Night Rangerdom). Hell, a harnessed Cobain twang even surfaces,
    semi-reclaiming his legacy from the radio-dreck borne from third-generation grunge's typhoid womb.""</p><p>
    
    Bowers continues, seemingly oblivious to how he's unqualified to describe his ferret's saliva: ""The best
    Lips-like tune is the violin exploder 'Stephan Has Corralled the Freaks', while 'Spiraling Sideways' could
    have been a Britpop hit, as its hook theatrically outgarages a host of statelocked pretenders. The album's
    most upbeat moments ('Biology Tricks' is an insanely catchy example) hold their own with Carl Newman's
    Zumpano zest, and the most downbeat intervals suggest a Mark Kozelek persevering after being punched in
    the stomach by a foreman. Ears accustomed to mid-fi dance-noise might find this record a pinch Buffalo
    Tom-ish or middle-of-the-road, but listeners counterculture enough to value patience and intelligence will
    find the hungover eye-wiping bewilderment of <i>Love You Just the Same</i> rich and rewarding, free from
    the hot air emitted by self-consciously 'big' bands. Please help Centro-Matic deservedly outsell Ryan
    Adams.""</p><p>
    
    Ugh. How could such a promising band succumb to comparisons with those orchestral-dub anime-casualties The
    Flaming Lips? When will the leisure class discover that political ugliness is as magnetic as Will Johnson's
    purported beauty? How will we turn this mother out? Exactly who is zooming who? My friends: screw Americana.
    Let's try to spread our propaganda through dance music. When next we meet, we are MAGNUM:PI, the Marxist
    Alliance to Galvanize New Urban Music: Project Idioteque.</p></div>"|1377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1377-love-you-just-the-same/|7.7|William Bowers

    buzz that's always awarded to the young director's efforts, officially concerns ""two countries, two cities,
    one river: The Oder River not only separates the German city of Frankfurt from Slubice in Poland, it
    separates two different worlds from each other. Whether rich or poor, people try to seek their fortune
    there-- but often only find their limits.""</p><p>
    
    The sound of broken dreams and misplaced hopes is nothing new to The Notwist, and Schmid presumably courted
    them as soundtrack artists for this very reason. The <i>Lichter</i> twelve-inch, the inaugural release of
    The Notwist's own Alien Transistor label (despite that its catalog number misleadingly reads ""NO3"") consists
    of three ultra-minimal instrumental compositions built on the haunts of piano and cello lines, interspersed
    with electronic fuzz and clicks, and the rhythmic augments of a zarb (a type of Eastern drum capable of
    differentiated tone, ergo melody as well).  It also includes a modest remix of these sounds by the band's
    own Martin Gretschmann-- also known as heralded electropop artist Console.</p><p>
    
    For the project, the Acher brothers were asked to compose a brief instrumental soundtrack-- not a full-length
    Notwist release.  The music is necessarily secondary to the film itself, and to this end must never upstage
    the dramatics or disagree with them thematically.  Despite the implications of that, instrumental soundtracks
    don't always equal ""boring.""  One need only recall Clint Mansell's similar effort with the soundtrack for
    <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>: a film about the fragility of the American Dream and its hopeless victims.
    Mansell did an expert job of mirroring the film's downward spiral, keeping more or less to the film's
    opening string theme throughout, but progressively imbuing it with an insistent melancholy. Each track has
    its own internal momentum, and taken as a whole, the <i>Requiem</i> soundtrack amounted to a horrifically
    draining experience, even when separated from the film itself.</p><p>
    
    In contrast, the <i>Lichter</i> soundtrack is frustratingly stagnant.  The overall tenor and intensity of
    each of the three ""Lichter"" pieces is virtually the same, and moreover, so are the roles of each instrument,
    which drastically reduces the possibilities for sonic variation within the soundtrack's theme (if there was
    even intended to be one at all). On a micro-level, the compositions (save the predictable addition and
    subtraction of instruments that occurs in ""Lichter 1"") never pursue any dynamic buildup or collapse--
    nor is there enough melody present in the lines to justify the mindnumbingly high number of repetitions.</p><p>
    
    Given how other-worldly this specific combination of instruments is, the soundtrack seems unusually content
    as background music.  What results is a clumsy, self-parodying breed of made-for-TV murder mystery music,
    where <i>The Young and the Restless</i> meets <i>X-Files</i>. Naturally, the chances of winding up with
    a vaguely Martian chill and a whodunit suspense are in your favor when you've got a cello, piano and zarb
    interacting; I'm just surprised that these compositions never amount to anything <i>but</i> Martian and
    suspenseful, which undermines the notion of suspense entirely.</p><p>
    
    Die-hard Notwist fans might justify their purchase of <i>Lichter</i> for its inclusion of the Console remix,
    which serves as the record's obvious standout.  Console's rendition avoids all the criticisms that could be
    made of the other ""Lichter"" variations.  Starting off quietly with the piano and cello as would the other
    tracks, the remix ebbs in momentum as Console inserts echoing synth lines and a jittery backbeat to drive
    the track home. The remix's electronic pulse over long instrumental lines might be likened as some dark
    counterpart to moments on Mouse on Mars' <i>Glam</i>-- another autonomously fantastic instrumental soundtrack
    that, the Console track reminds us, Notwist's <i>Lichter</i> will never be.  What we're left with, then, is
    one singular, brief revelation of genuine interest.  The rest of <i>Lichter</i> is an impotent ghost, looking
    the part of terror, but emasculated by its tragic indecisiveness.</p></div>"|5846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5846-lichter-ep/|5.5|Nicholas B. Sylvester

    wing, arguing that indieland is experiencing a slow loosening of its staunch restrictions on enjoying music
    that engages any of the parts of one's body located below the neck. His point isn't simply about whether
    it's okay to dance at shows, but the recognition of a noticeable shift away from attitudes that automatically
    regard rhythm as subordinate to other quantitative musical values.</p><p>
    In recent years, such attitudes pushed
    the beliefs that it was frivolous and fleeting for rock to engage with current technology or digital production,
    or that you can't have a good time listening to music unless your enjoyment is soaked in a million layers of
    irony. Even most of the big-name stars of leftfield rock such as Wayne Coyne, Björk, The Beta Band, or
    Radiohead sorted out that not much of that was true years ago, of course, but a lot of people in indieland
    are slow learners.</p><p>
    For those riveted by Schreiber's stump who like the good old-fashioned dancing-- the clubbing kind-- comes
    the second compilation of underground house from the Crydamoure label, co-founded in 1996 by Daft Punk's
    Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and fellow Parisian producer Eric Chédeville. Like 2000's <i>Waves</i>, this
    compiles the label's recent 12-inches, this time arranged by up-and-comers Archigram (Parisian duo Jean
    Morris and Nicolas Archyp).</p><p>
    This may be French house, but don't expect either the more pop-structured works from Daft Punk or crossover
    disco-house such as semi-recent European hits from Modjo, Spiller, Tomcraft, or Jean-Jacques Smoothie. Not
    that it strays into Afro-Brazilian territory, either-- <i>Waves II</i> is an exuberant, mesmerizing set of
    classic French house and filter disco, built expressly for the clubs. It's therefore potentially exhausting
    for those who tend to find listening to this sort of thing a monolithic chore.</p><p>
    The record's hypnotic rhythmic bliss is accented by some well-timed inclusions of guitars, strings, and
    horns. Vocals are kept to a minimum, highlighted by the breezy ooh-ooh's that float along Le Knight Club's
    delicate, high-pitched ""Nymphae Song"", Archigram's electro-house cover of The Stooges' ""I Wanna be Your Dog""
    (""Doggystyle""), and Crydajam's ""If You Give Me the Love That I Want"", the set's one full-throated work.</p><p>
    Every track was recorded within the past three years, many of them provided by the label boss' themselves:
    One or both them helped construct nine of the 15 songs. Archigram paces the set very well, mixing and
    dropping in all of their releases to date and showing up the label heads in the process. Archigram's
    contributions are highlighted by ""Carnaval"", which-- nestled at the heart of the set next to Le Knight
    Club's ""Soul Bells""-- is where the mix reaches toward greatness. A soaring, layered filter disco track,
    it blends delicate changes of pitch and washes of fuzzbox guitar over a thumping 4/4 beat.</p><p>
<i>Waves II</i> starts with nods to early more traditional, Salsoul-inspired house before segueing into
    tracks with more contemporary identifiers such as the liberal nods to nu-electro and even the use of
    electric guitar. On the whole, it's a stark contrast and a solid re-imagination of the genre, one that
    includes everything <i>except</i> the breezy, blissed-out <i>Super Discount</i>/Air model that in the U.S.
    was once synonymous with French house (the roots of which are on glorious display on Motorbass' recently
    reissued <i>Pansoul</i>). <i>Waves II</i> doesn't come close to matching the genre-stretching heights of
    de Homem-Christo's Daft Punk-- and, besides, it's a different approach to the sound altogether-- but it
    does provide a handy collection of the work of one of underground house's most vital labels.</p></div>"|406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/406-crydamoure-presents-waves-ii/|7.4|Scott Plagenhoef

I don't want to come off like a bitter traditionalist,
    but I can hardly blame anyone who thinks the highest goal of the avant-garde composer is to disguise or
    avoid melody.  Dismiss it if you will, but avoiding melody isn't actually very easy to do for long.
    Harmonies and rhythms will come and go, and differ between scenes, eras and cultures with no greater
    significance than the color of your car versus your neighbor's.  The one part of music everyone's supposed
    to be able to understand is the melody, and indeed, it's the part that usually gets the most attention in
    ""general interest"" circles.  Even your grandmother could be fooled into liking your music if you only let
    her in on the melodies (mine was convinced OOIOO's ""Mountain Book"" was an ""ancient Chinese lullaby"").</p><p>
    
    Consequently, melody is often given a bad rap.  Part of this is due to a few bad apples proclaiming that
    it's the <i>only</i> aspect of music worth anything (see ""rap is not music"" morons, and even then only as
    an example of melody equaling ""happy fun tunes"" to some people).  Additionally, it's often tough to
    separate melody from its context, so sometimes, bad ones get all the props-- anyone for the fairly
    unsingable ""Star Spangled Banner""?  Guitarist Gary Lucas (Jeff Buckley, Captain Beefheart) must buy
    into the universal appeal of melody to a considerable extent because his album of Chinese popular songs
    from the 1930s-1950s shouldn't otherwise have much going for Westerners.  <i>The Edge of Heaven</i> makes
    a solid case that what little musical ground separates us is effortlessly erased by a good song.</p><p>
    
    As Lucas details in his distractingly funny-despite-being-totally-serious liner notes (""the next step was
    to place a couple of these tunes on my solo acoustic album <i>Evangeline</i>, which the critics here and
    abroad raved over""), the songs on <i>The Edge of Heaven</i> were selected from ones performed by legendary
    singers/actresses Bai Kwong and Chow Hsuan during the golden age of Shanghai and Hong Kong cinema.  The
    guitarist had spent a few years in Taiwan during the 70s, and quickly became enamored of their self-described
    Betty-Boop-meets-Billie-Holiday charm.  There is a bit of antiquated, grandmotherly grace to these songs,
    but just as much a gentle, warm sentimentality that shouldn't fail to infiltrate even the most hardcore
    hipster's stone innards.</p><p>
    
    About half of the record is instrumental (solo guitar, and occasional rhythm accompaniment), and the vocals
    on the other half are provided by Singaporean television star Celeste Chong and German (!) female vocalist
    Gisburg.  Chong's voice is a soft, bright soprano that's probably the more traditionally oriented (i.e.,
    the style of classic Chinese pop) of the two-- though anyone expecting tortured cats needn't be worried.
    ""Night in Shanghai"" might pass for a children's song, with bouncy, folk guitar accompaniment under Chong's
    girly refrains.  Typical for the selections on <i>The Edge of Heaven</i>, melodic sweetness obscures a
    darker message (""we see her welcome us with a smile, who knows that her heart is bitter""), though again,
    melody will have its way with anyone not following along with the lyric sheet.  Gisburg's deeper, more
    sensual phrasings on ""The Wall"" may initially make a better fit if you're unaccustomed to Chong's nuances.
    The song laments the missing bond between a married couple, and Gisburg performs the fairly rigid,
    rhythmically complex melody with an admirably human touch.</p><p>
    
    Lucas' instrumental performances are generally ace, and anyone familiar with his work on Jeff Buckley's
    <i>Grace</i> (or last year's <i>Songs for No One</i>) should immediately recognize his signature,
    twang-chiming sound on pieces like ""Old Dreams"" and ""Where is My Home"".  In particular, his work on
    ""Pretense"" sells the innate beauty of the song.  Where you might think this record would be a great excuse
    for dull, NPR-hyped drollery, Lucas actually manages to make this song sound like it could have come from
    Appalachian villages, where hammer dulcimer fills the air with a homey ambience almost completely lost
    in more ""cultured"" areas.  Okay, that was straight out of a PBS telethon, but all I'm saying is that you
    don't have to be all up in Chinese music to dig this stuff.  Ultimately, I guess you just need to be into
    good melodies, and really, aren't we all?</p></div>"|4943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4943-the-edge-of-heaven/|7.9|Dominique Leone

    crop of crossover sensations making their way towards some measure of commercial success, it's that time is
    short.  Like knocking over a convenience store, the m.o. is slash-and-grab, get in, get out, and don't let
    anyone come to their senses or put things into perspective.  The three R's of rock and roll are now Release,
    Release, Release; anything, doesn't matter, just make sure your name never leaves the new release rack, even
    if you have to tag something as banal as a Saves the Day CD to do it.  Perhaps it's just a passing trend,
    but for the moment, in the wake of some ridonkulous market over-reaching by Interpol, the YYYeahs, and now
    this pants-load from The Libertines, it certainly seems like quality is on summer holiday.</p><p>
    
    Now that they're starting to get the press they so richly deserved for last year's remarkable <i>Up the
    Bracket</i>, The Libertines, like their riches-to-more-riches counterparts in NYC, have to start pooping
    out half-baked EPs in between albums.  <i>I Get Along</i> is one such EP; hell, there's even a bare ass on
    the back cover.  And below that?  The tracklist.  Only stink-lines and flies buzzing the titles could make
    the implication (it's inadvertent, but you don't care about that) any more obvious.  Out of five tracks,
    four are new, three sound like hastily recorded demos, two are even worth a damn, and one sounds like the
    nightmare soundtrack to a world where The Clash went mall-punk.  It's like a countdown to irrelevance.</p><p>
    
    The best thing that can be said about ""Mayday"" or ""Skag &amp; Bone Man"" is that they're over before anything
    really awful to say about them can leap to mind.  Tipsy, British pub-punk, complete with a stylishly
    disheveled (drunken?) round of backing vocals on ""S&amp;B; Man"" is burned through with properly half-assed
    enthusiasm, where energy subs in for real aptitude for the material.  It's formulaic, without any of the
    attention to detail or deft stylistic shifts that marked the tunes on their debut, but it's under three
    minutes for the lot.  At least The Libertines know better than to waste too much time on obvious filler.</p><p>
    
    The first three tracks are the backbone of this skeletal EP, and they fare only marginally better at producing
    something worthwhile, despite some high points.  ""I Get Along"" isn't even among the best moments on <i>Up
    the Bracket</i>, but its thrashing, trainwreck guitars and Carl Barat's sleepy-eyed cockney/Casablancas
    hybrid vocals are pure, gleeful abandon.  ""The Delaney"" is sharp, Clash-informed pop with some of the
    sharpest songwriting The Libertines have put together; from the jangling, trebly riffs to an insanely
    memorable vocal line, it's got hooks to spare.</p><p>
    
    But as good as they are, together they only begin to counteract the vapid brain damage inflicted by ""Don't
    Look Back into the Sun"", their new single, a song just catchy and empty-headed enough to surely be a
    fair-sized hit for them.  It's like ""The Delaney""'s evil counterpart, infectious as syphilis and for all
    the wrong reasons, with dumbly cutesy vocals and a food-court-sized guitar line.  If it wasn't for the
    enduring, beery charm, or character, or whatever in even the sappiest of Barat's vocals, if he was just
    a tad whinier with a hint of pre-pubescence thrown in, this would pass for any other band that still wears
    wallet chains and Vans (""for skating"").  It's possible you think that's a good thing; if so, congratulations.
    As I see it, the tragedy here is that for one reason or another, this has been keyed in as a single; it's
    not hard to imagine why, either, but it doesn't bode well.  In typical single fashion, it may sound nothing
    or everything like the next album; just in case, enjoy the sound of <i>Up the Bracket</i> while you can,
    and while you're at it, pass on this.</p></div>"|4770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4770-i-get-along-ep/|5.3|Eric Carr

We've wanted more of something,
    and slowly we've realized what.  What you're increasingly witnessing at every club, at every show, with
    every passing night, is the death of the horrible, awkward, uncomfortable tension of devoted music fans
    pretending not to enjoy music they have paid to see.  Finally, we are shaking off the coma of the stillborn
    slacker 90s and now there is movement.  Arms uncross, faces snap to attention, and clarity hits like religion.
    We have buried irony and pissed on its grave and for the first time we are realizing what rock music, rock
    shows are all about.</p><p>
    
    Fuck, was that a dream?   Pavement playing the Showbox in Seattle to throngs of unwashed hippie revivalists
    acting as if they'd been imprisoned there by a cruel master of ceremonies, their peer and equal Stephen
    Malkmus?  Eddie Vedder iconically scrawling PRO-CHOICE up his left arm like he bore the weight of the
    entire fucking world and was the only living person with this Great Important Answer to all the world's
    problems?  That the Dismemberment Plan-- among the first to envision this future at which we've now arrived--
    called us out <i>to our faces</i> with ""Doing the Standing Still"" and we actually still <i>just stood
    there</i>?  It's almost impossible to believe in light of music like this, music that finally places as
    much emphasis on real, true, palpable fun as it does on art.</p><p>
    
    As brilliant as this music sounds on paper and CD, nothing compares to experiencing it live.  I saw it
    taking shape (""but I was there!"") at the beginning of this summer in Chicago: The Rapture unleashing their
    primal digifunk on Chicago's stuffy Metro.  As the band took the stage, two kids behind me absolutely lost
    their shit.  Whatever it was they were doing, they were doing it alone-- at first.  I've never seen anything
    like that: You could see it visibly sweeping the whole room.  And these kids didn't have a clue ""how to
    dance,"" which was part of the brilliance of it: For one, it complemented the overcompensating freaks onstage
    not knowing how to play, but beyond that, it was the very spirit of punk.  The revelation that you didn't
    need formal training to start a band in 1977 and the realization that you don't need to be Merce Cunningham
    to dance are one and the same.  Fucking <i>nobody</i> knows how to dance at these shows-- in fact, you'd
    look like a jackass if you <i>did</i>.</p><p>
    
    This perceived, grand-scheme ""Importance"" of <i>Echoes</i>, however, is irrelevant: What matters is that it
    wants you to get off your ass and work it, and that you'll be thrilled to oblige.  Its trance-noir opener,
    ""Olio"" (here revised from a rougher take on the <i>Mirror</i> LP) sets synthetic programmed 808 beats,
    handclaps and ride cymbals against vocalist Luke Jenner, whose tortured wails mash Robert and Patti into
    one solitary Smith.  Jenner is almost impressively tuneless, and what's more, it even seems unintentional--
    as though he's really trying to hit that high C and settling for a half-step down after 30+ takes.  Good
    thing it works for him stylistically, striking as totally unhinged and wildeyed, as if he can't sit still
    at a mike with all that rhythm whizzing past him.</p><p>
    
    ""I Need Your Love"" sends needling synths and a growling, discordant sax subtly buzzing around Jenner's
    nervous vocal while a punched-up house beat smacks against a minimalist bassline and sampled guitar.
    ""House of Jealous Lovers""-- the unparalleled champion of 2002's summer anthem sweepstakes-- appears at a
    slightly more album-friendly length (five instead of almost seven), showcasing bassist Matt Safer's most
    convincing shrieks over the slapping guitar chords that won the band their first comparisons to Gang of
    Four.</p><p>
    
    One of the greatest things about the way this record sounds is how the DFA production team has coated it
    in their trademark style, pitting a gritty lo-fi aesthetic against the most state-of-the-art equipment the
    1980s had to offer-- which is where it differs from the dancefloor stereotype, whose overt glossiness has
    remained the industry standard for decades.  The album's title track is one of the better examples of what
    I'm talking about: Misleadingly opening like something off The Strokes' first record, it quickly bursts
    into one of <i>Echoes</i>' hottest tracks, with a sloppy, tumbling bassline, those dirty conga breakdowns,
    tinny guitar hits (an updated relative to the outmoded orchestra hit), and the deafening, careening
    carwreck ending, punctuated by Safer repeatedly screeching ""WHHAAAAAT!!!!"" at the moment of greatest
    impact.  This is anti-gloss, but it mixes as cleanly into any DJ set as it does into indie rock mixtapes.</p><p>
    
    Virtually every track is a highlight: I feel like I'd be doing a disservice to this record by not giving
    a more in-depth read on the Duran Duran guitar stabs and 80s cokehead atmosphere of ""Sister Savior"", the
    Neptunes-esque beat of ""Killing"", or any of the three non-dance-oriented tracks (""Open Up Your Heart"",
    the truly beautiful ""Love Is All"" and the somber, almost Talk Talk-ish closer, ""Infatuation"") that sound
    entirely out of place yet somehow manage not to disturb the flow of the album.  But then I'd be covering
    every single track on <i>Echoes</i>, and they can't <i>all</i> be that great, right?</p><p>
    
    The Rapture are only one of about 10,000 bands ushering in this thing that's gotten labeled ""dancepunk,""
    but it's important to note that they were among the first.  <i>Echoes</i> was cut and complete over a
    year ago-- their ""House of Jealous Lovers"" single was intended as a teaser, but delays too numerous and
    boring to list deterred its release.  As the record was continually pushed back, the cacophonous buzz
    that surrounded the single faded.  People had been <i>so excited</i>: Here were the dance and rock
    undergrounds finally uniting, indie rock cultivating a new loathing and defiance for tired hipster
    poses and demanding the chaos of which safety and careerism had stripped it.  Yesterday, after having
    been available on file-trading networks since June, <i>Echoes</i> finally saw official release in the
    UK (the U.S. is being made to wait until the end of next month), and it's no exaggeration to say it's
    been met with about 20% of the anticipation it would have, and should have, garnered-- if only it had
    come out on time.</p><p>
    
    That's another rant altogether, but it's true that the timing <i>seems</i> all wrong on this release,
    particularly since we've been inundated with a million Rapture knockoffs who've already released their
    own sad imitations.  Liars' <i>They Threw Us All in a Trench</i> and Out Hud's <i>S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.</i>
    aside, dancepunk hasn't even offered tangible evidence of actual potential.  The fact is, paradigm shifts
    don't happen overnight, and if the release schedules for the next few months are accurate (!!!, Out Hud,
    Liars, and Erase Errata all have new albums coming out), the lull in publicity this genre's seeing right
    now is the calm before the storm.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, people aren't wasting time: over the course of the past few months, I've seen them going
    nuts at shows you'd expect to see them dancing at in this climate (Out Hud, !!!, Radio 4, Liars, The
    Postal Service, Rjd2), shows you'd never expect to see them dancing at in this climate (Comets on Fire,
    Black Dice, Broken Social Scene), and shows by bands that don't deserve to be danced to in <i>any</i>
    climate (Hint Hint, Dance Disaster Movement).  Bands like The Rapture have sent their message: The rock
    show was not meant to be a collegiate study.  We have all stopped caring what snotty academics find
    acceptable, because now there is real, true, palpable fun, and it is the greatest liberation.  You people
    at shows who don't dance, who don't know a good time, who can't have fun, who sneer and scoff at the
    supposed inferior-- it's you this music strikes a blow against.  We hope you die bored.</p></div>"|6693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6693-echoes/|9.0|Ryan Schreiber

When     placed in the appropriate context of a creativity that should by all accounts be entirely bankrupt, these     three albums irrevocably prove that Stapleton is basically releasing every sound he's ever produced.  ""My     gussets bulge with fingers.""  I want to talk about Nurse With Wound's 1979 debut, <i>A Chance Meeting on a     Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella</i> or 1982's landmark <i>Homotopy to Marie</i> in     this part of the review, but, my god, I can already feel Stapleton unleashing even more albums.  I'm     falling behind.  No time for organization or grammar.  Keep your chin up.  Stay afloat.  We'll get through     this.</p>
<p>Okay.  <i>Salt Marie Celeste</i>.  One of the more minimalist pieces of NWW's ceaseless reign, this disc     consists of a single 60-minute-long track which is based a similar track Stapleton released last year on     <i>Sounds from the Horse Hospital</i>.  Its music, for the most part, is driven by cinematic, undulating     waves of synths.  I'm told that people like to use different music for different events.  This is the music     you'll listen to when shining a woefully inadequate flashlight in a strange cellar and finding a dead man     with a harmonica.  Oh, this situation doesn't happen that often?  Yeah, and you won't listen to this album     that often, either.  ""Manipulating one finger into my wet groove.""  For the middle forty minutes of the     piece, one of the most irritating noises ever committed to record-- maybe supposed to be a dead soul, but     sounds like Rain Man's impression of sex.  This would be interesting if it was one of those process works,     and it may be one, but I don't know what the process is.  Finally, in the last few minutes, Stapleton     silences that MIND-ENERVATING RAIN MAN noise and hits the ""bubbling lava"" button.  This is supposed to be     innovative, ideology-challenging aestheticism, but it's also boring, even for minimalist music.  It ends     with a fade!  Real experimental-- if you're The Beach Boys.</p>
<p>Only two EPs have been released since you read that paragraph, and one was just a concert promo.  <i>She     and Me Fall Together</i>.  Nine tracks, five songs.  How is this possible?  Solution: Stapleton is releasing     music with such rapidity that some of it has been converted into energy.  The titular song here is, I think,     one of those postmodern, self-reflexive ironic jokes that are still sincere, like Devendra Banhart and     pre-war blues, or the Coen brothers and film noir.  It's the mesmerizing Can percussion with an escalating     guitar crunch, and superimposed on enough ambience to fill an art history student's portfolio.  I feel     inauthentic listening to it, like when I listen to 90s glam.  It approaches true trounce when it dispenses     with its frivolous beat and melody and starts eroding the chainsaw noise.  The aforementioned barnyard and     porn tracks follow.  It's as if they injected some hens and pigs into an old radio, ducks turning into     screeching doors, pigs into Morse code.  Then the moaning, sex with bugs and injured dogs.  Robot reading     porn.  ""My Red Hot Car"" without that lamentable ""music"" aspect.  It's earnestly, pitiably, profoundly,     bewilderingly a gimmick.</p>
<p><i>The Musty Odour of Pierced Rectums</i>.  The only one that sounds exactly how NWW is supposed to sound:     badgering, stinging metal, tempered with tape works.  First track is the least rhythmic piece I've ever     heard.  I don't even possess an analogy, because I couldn't hold the squirming creature long enough to     criticize it.  Second track.  Submarine, air and water bawling into the corridors, indistinguishable     commands being barked, sirens, bouncing valves and spigots.  Same motif as <i>She and Me</i>.  Stapleton     has gone inter-album on us again, manufacturing networks we're supposed to catalog on our NWW discography     atlases.  Track Seven is a malefic and abrasive din, but its main virtue consists of its length of fifteen     seconds.  Track Nine: eating an apple, then it rains, then he burps.  I know this isn't criticism, but     there's nothing on this track for me to consider.  I just liked how it had its own track so it's easily     accessible if I ever need it.  Ladies love it.</p>
<p>I can barely move my head now.  There have been so many NWW albums released now that there's no room in my     apartment for all of them.  I've had to amputate both my legs and construct prosthetics out of the NWW     packaging.  Currently, half my body is NWW albums, and they're weighing me down.  Please send this review     to Steven Stapleton so he knows someone is listening and that only he can stall this flood.

    members-- particularly a latecomer like replacement guitarist John Schmersal.  And initially, suspicions
    seemed confirmed by a record he issued on the short-lived SeeThru Broadcasting label under the alias John
    Stuart Mill, an uneven <i>folk</i> record that couldn't decide whether it wanted to win over the masses or
    languish forever in used-bin obscurity.  But as most music fans agree, it takes more than one talent to
    make a truly transcendent band, and with the release of Enon's 2000 debut, <i>Believo!</i>, John Schmersal
    proved himself that missing link.</p><p>
<i>Believo!</i> proved an incredibly solid, diverse, and most notably, <i>original</i> offering, with its
    punchdrunk serpentine melodies and Skeleton Key percussionists Steve Calhoon and Rick Lee's junkyard
    assemblage providing the record's sturdy core.  With critical acclaim and moderate indie sales on their
    side, things were looking up for Enon.  That's when Schmersal hit another unexpected roadblock: his entire
    rhythmic section returned to their former band to record a second full-length-- no less than five years
    after their first tanked for Capitol Records.  Worst decision they ever made?  Probably, because John
    Schmersal was determined.  After having death come between him and success, it had to seem like only a
    minor setback.</p><p>
    
    Enon quickly bounced back.  Picking up singer/bassist/keyboardist Toko Yasuda (late of Blonde Redhead and
    The Lapse) and drummer Matt Schulz, the band re-emerged fully formed as an outfit more interested in
    bumping nasties than creeping out audiences with cyborg-rock dirges.  Amidst fan concerns that losing
    half its members would irrevocably derail Enon's plotted course, <i>High Society</i> again surprised
    everyone.  Here, they patented-- and maybe perfected-- their beat-happy dance-pop/rock hybrid, and
    immediately took their rightful seats at the head table of the rocker class of 2002.  How do you follow
    <i>that</i> up?</p><p>
    
    No, seriously, Schmersal needs an answer, like, now.</p><p>
    
    Too late: he decided without you.  The choice?  An odd one: milking the stylistically varied but thematically
    consistent formula of <i>High Society</i>, quite possibly on autopilot.  Bafflingly sequenced, <i>Hocus Pocus</i>
    opens rather flatly with the downtempo trip-pop of the Toko-led ""Shave"", but then revs up with ""The Power
    of Yawning"", a Kinksian guitar-pop romp which collapses into a bizarro, almost Bowie-esque bridge spotlighting
    a stately Schmersal warble.  What's more, the record confounds like this all the way through, with many of
    its most compelling tracks dumped off near the end.  A shame, since several of these-- including the moody
    desperation of the serrated art-punk number ""Starcastic"" (also the record's first single) and the supremely
    rarefied strut of ""Monsoon""-- would stand out beautifully even amongst <i>High Society</i>'s strongest
    tracks, but may never be discovered by some impatient listeners.</p><p>
    
    Credit is due for the album's centerpiece and most innovative cut, ""Daughter in the House of Fools"".  A
    stutter-step Jeep anthem blasting Toko's sing-songy vox and bass-quaking beats, the track belches forth
    an array of blurts, beeps, and bells, with rhythmic bobs and weaves that indicate that Rick Lee's junkyard
    percussion-- recreated here via MIDI triggering-- remains at least a psychic influence.  The album's most
    immediate highlights, though, are those that feature Schmersal and Yasuda's dueling male/female vocals
    (""Starcastic"", ""Murder Sounds"", and the surprisingly sweet lilt of ""Candy""), an underused technique in any
    genre, let alone Enon's budget-futurist danceclub pop.</p><p>
    
    If you can make it past the album's frustrating layout (I've found liberal use of the 'skip' button to
    come in handy for this), <i>Hocus Pocus</i> proves a fine collection of songs by pretty much anyone's
    standards.  Not so much a step backwards as a failure to leap fully ahead, this may not be exactly what
    fans were expecting, but if we're going by Schmersal's track record, it's not nearly the last straw.</p></div>"|2814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2814-hocus-pocus/|7.0|Brad Hurst

    the East Village Thomas Jefferson.  One can easily venture that by simply researching the panoply of
    allusions that dot Zorn's liner notes, it's possible to be familiar with more cultural phenomena than
    you would gather in a lifetime at a university. Ennio Morricone, the avant-Jewish Masada, soundtracks to
    Maya Deren, Tonic concerts with jazz's Derek Bailey, minimalism's Phill Niblock, no-wave's Arto Lindsay
    and <i>Cremaster</i> composer Jonathan Bepler. His name is a special feature on the <i>Branded to Kill</i>
    DVD!  I, and people like me, would probably obsessively idolize him, if only he wasn't, you know, a weird,
    bespectacled 50-year-old saxophonist.</p><p>
    
    And now <i>Chimeras</i>, with liner notes that will effectively triple the number of allusions already out
    there. Get your notebook out. The cover is a Hieronymous Bosch painting. The actual composition is vaguely
    influenced by Schoenberg's <i>Pierrot Lunaire</i> (currently best known in the Pierre Boulez version).
    Inside, we learn the unification of the composition was achieved through a musical adaptation of the
    self-imposed barriers of the lipogram as best exemplified by the great French author, Georges Perec,
    and his Sixth Century predecessor, Fabius Planciades Fulgentius. All this means that each of the twelve
    compositions of <i>Chimeras</i> avoids one specific pitch which, when accumulated, form ""the first tone
    row Schoenberg ever utilized."" The music almost doesn't matter. If you like spending your Saturday nights
    in the darker corridors of MoMA, you've probably already given this a 9.5, which, unfortunately, is not
    far from the truth.</p><p>
<i>Pierrot Lunaire</i> is a strange choice for Zorn, and since this is Zorn we're talking about, is actually
    relatively typical. It was Schoenberg's return to traditional tonality after his earlier atonal works,
    and (with different instruments on each section) achieves the intimacy of a small chamber group. It's
    also absolute anarchy, the attempts of the orchestration to match <i>Pierrot</i>'s psychological turmoil
    leading the piece through tortuous paths and frantic ascensions. The only two features really carried over
    to <i>Chimeras</i> are the different variations of instrumentation and the persistent schizophrenia of
    vocalist Ilana Davidson and her accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    The first piece lifts a staccato clarinet and scaling violin over lethargic flute and percussion, until,
    in its culmination, the two trajectories combust in one of Zorn's signature freak-outs, courtesy of a
    chamber orchestra. Culmination is the main theme here, each piece building and building until the eleventh
    piece's convergence of every instrument at the climax of the vocalist's story (whatever that may be, I know
    it involves a lot of ""tick-a-tick""ing). The voice is truly revelatory here.  At first, Ilana Davidson is
    indistinguishable from a violin in a higher register-- and then you realize, thirty seconds later, that
    that's a <i>human being</i> mourning and moaning away. She assiduously cripples the ""speech-singing"" on
    <i>Pierrot Lumaire</i>, and adds some philosophical tension to the entire piece. While in Schoenberg's version,
    it seems clear the orchestration is intended to convey <i>Pierrot</i>'s psyche, in <i>Chimeras</i>, it's difficult
    to say if the orchestration is a reflection of the vocalist's tantrum or its catalyst. As a result, the two
    sides mimic each other (ahh, right, the chimera), a disconcertion compounded by the addition of Elizabeth
    Farnum's echoing voice and William Winant's percussive chiseling.</p><p>
    
    All this absent-pitch-lipogram stuff is entirely irrelevant if you haven't been taking two hours of music
    theory every day for the last three years.  But the piece itself is thrillingly diverse, suddenly going
    from luminous to lugubrious and from classical to chaotic. It's a bold, unexpected new chapter in Zorn's
    corpus, or it would be if we didn't expect that from him.</p></div>"|8929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8929-chimeras/|8.3|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    out hyper, occasionally erratic backbeats and loads of weird, crashing melodies-- is always playfully
    confrontational.  Colk's nonsensical lyrics are more about their visceral, phonetic sounds than any
    potential narratives, and that kind of terse, internal tension can be both frustrating and exhilarating
    all at once.  To amp up the semantic agitation, Colk's mumbled delivery is also been padded by a mess
    of extraneous yelps and growls that, while adding texture to her band's art-punk noisescapes, usually
    have little-to-no affiliation with the words she's hollering.</p><p>
    
    The result is Kaito U.K.'s sophomore effort, <i>Band Red</i>, a record full of disorientating (but mostly
    thrilling) bursts: Colk barks and warbles, each of her high-strung, shrieky proclamations practically
    indiscernible from Dave Lake's pinched guitar zaps.  It's perpetually unclear as to whether the proper
    reaction is to patent a new, kicky dance move or to twitch and grimace, but that question's inherent to
    Kaito's game, and it's a big part of what makes this record so much fun to yap along with.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Enemyline"" is full of energetic guitar jabbing and unintelligible vocals, Colt and Lake's joint
    poking augmented by what sounds like a layer of mixed-down screams; the song flip-flops between quiet and
    loud (as post-Pixies bands are prone to do), but even ""Enemyline""'s sparser bits are heavy with the threat
    of total implosion.  When Kaito U.K. slip away from their blustery noisemaking, like on the excellent,
    organ-filled ""Nothin' New"", they prove themselves capable of rolling out the kinds of foggy, wide-eyed
    laments that can sit perfectly alongside big punk blasts.  Still, the band is at its best when indulging
    adrenaline: ""A.S.A. to Accuracy"" is the record's most aggressive track, with two vague, fuzzy guitar lines
    fighting for supremacy, blood splattering the amps.</p><p>
    
    What ultimately saves <i>Band Red</i> from been-there tedium (check the ground already covered by Liliput,
    Erase Errata, even Deerhoof) is Kaito U.K.'s instinctual bend toward sticky melodies-- their tendency to
    temper their noise with surprisingly sugary pop hooks and wormy choruses is what keeps these songs from
    becoming pretentious or tiresome.  So even if jumpy, fitful art-punk isn't particularly groundbreaking
    right now, Kaito U.K. are still playing the shiny pop card with previously unseen flair-- no matter how
    delightfully splintered <i>Band Red</i> can seem, there are always solid tunes lurking beneath the spits
    and flutters.</p></div>"|4554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4554-band-red/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

But during the 40s and 50s, a generation of     experimentally oriented composers began to imagine music sourced from purely electronic means. Among     the early pioneers was a Belgian named Henri Pousseur, who experimented with Karlheinz Stockhausen in     a radio studio in Cologne. In 1972, Pousseur released an eight-sided series of pieces on four vinyl     records as <i>8 Études Paraboliques</i> (in English, <i>8 Parabolic Studies</i>).  The relentlessly     theory-oriented label Sub Rosa re-released <i>8 Études Paraboliques</i> as a four-disc set in 2001.     Around the time of this release, and as part of the label's interest in forging connections between     movements in electronic music through time, Sub Rosa's founders organized an event in which four composers     (including Pousseur himself) presented reworkings of Pousseur's music.</p>
<p>My exploration of electronic music has been in reverse chronological order.  In the last couple of years     I've just started combing through the music of the 50s, 60s and 70s to see what composers were able to     manage with their crude, room-sized circuit boards. Because of my method of inquiry, I've developed certain     prejudices, including the tendency to see electronically created music basically as a process of evolution.     That is, it's been a pretty steady march of music that has increased in quality over time. I wouldn't dare     make such a claim about pop, jazz, what have you, but in terms of timbrel complexity, emotional power and     overall interest level, the experimental electronic music of today is light years beyond what could be     accomplished in the old days.</p>
<p>All this is a way for me to say that I find Posseur's re-working of his own material to be the least     interesting thing here. That's not to say that the thin, ghostly synthetic tones of yesteryear don't     have a certain appeal, just that Pousseur's track is to me the stuff of nostalgia, the blips and hums of     the black-and-white <i>Lost in Space</i> flight deck. I have not heard the original <i>8 Études Paraboliques</i>,     so I can't say how much of the material makes it into these remixes. But Pousseur's pink noise sounds like     the sound design for the ""blast off"" portion of an early-70s NASA commemorative record. God bless him, we     wouldn't be where we are now without his contributions, but I doubt I will ever listen to his 28-minute     piece once this review is over.</p>
<p>Main's Robert Hampson does just a bit better. The liner notes present him as awed by the presence of     Pousseur (he apparently performed directly after at the event recorded for this set), and he does follow     much of the master's textural lead. Spare, dry tones dominate, but this time they're immersed in a groaning,     cavernous space befitting Main's dark ambient style. Voices intrude, the mix becomes more complex and varied,     but Main's contribution is never quite immersive enough.</p>
<p>The second disc of this double-CD set contains the gems.  Philip Jeck, presumably working with some of the     original recordings and then making plenty of room for the dusty vinyl oddities that are his instruments,     expertly draws lines between the possibilities inherent in electricity and the nagging limitations of the     physical world.  His multiple layers of synth drones put forth rich harmonics never imagined by the original     machines, and his addition of the \xBC speed ""voice from hell"" (an effective trademark) and bits of percussion     humanizes the cold music. The surface noise is kept to a minimum and he never quite hits a moment of grand     catharsis, but Jeck's piece is deeply satisfying.</p>
<p>Oval's Markus Popp, who has based much of his career on processing the music of others, provides the grand     finale. Popp has gone from using a magic marker on the Aphex Twin's <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume 2</i> to essentially putting the source material into an atom smasher to map the music's subatomic terrain. His     piece is a miracle of dynamics and impossibly rich texture.  Here, Popp's sounds, so distinctly his despite     their complexity, are used in the service of an expertly composed track. After long, ominous drones that     are obviously building to something, the piece explodes in a fountain of melodic feedback, spitting shimmering     flecks of musical energy into the air. It's like a bottomless roman candle in machinegun mode. The CD skips     are here, too, but as on <i>Commers</i>, they're so deeply buried in the noise that they serve as a violent     rhythmic device quite apart from the old ambient days. It's a fitting end to this curious transhistorical     experiment that makes the future look bright indeed.</p></div>"|6523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6523-4-parabolic-mixes/|7.3|Mark Richardson

And I thought Philip
    Oakey was dry and droll on record.  It seemed a bit pathetic when he said it this summer at a Chicago
    street fair.  At the end of the night, when people were literally dancing in the streets, it made sense.
    Oakey, his bandmates, and the communal spirit of communicative music were giving the people what they
    want: an irresistible, good time.</p><p>
    
    The sound of the crowd singing along to ""Love Action"" and ""Don't You Want Me"" is the sort of party that
    mashup producer Richard X might have enjoyed-- and not just because the Human League are a well from which
    he frequently draws. The producer, who came to prominence as Girls on Top with a trio of electro/female-vocalized
    mashups (including ""I Wanna Dance with Numbers"", which transformed Whitney Houston from Dionne Warwick to
    Grace Jones), is obviously a child of the 1980s and a believer in the power of pop.</p><p>
    
    ""Let's take it back to the 1980s,"" exclaims a sample on ""Rock Jacket"", from Richard X's debut album,
    <i>Presents His X-Factor Volume One</i>. ""Eighties music/ Rock it/ Lose it,"" it chimes-- often in almost
    indecipherable vocoder-- over a sea of synths (some Heaven 17, some Jan Hammer), the white-funk bass from
    Spandau Ballet's ""Chant No. 1"", and a schizophrenic drum machine. It's like taking a wondrous spin through
    the <i>Vice City</i> radio dial.</p><p>
    
    Except neither it, nor the rest of the album, is really nostalgia per se. Unlike much of the regressive
    rock it's not reclamation, a reach back into the past to reject the present. Unlike most of kitsch-rock,
    it's not even postmodernist, because the appropriation and combination of eras isn't done with a wink.
    Richard X is more lamenting the loss of some ideas from the 80s-- most obviously the lack of New Pop
    sensibilities in the charts.  But he's breaking boundaries instead of turning back the clock, celebrating
    a life loving music and making it the only untraditional way he knows how or is able to.</p><p>
    
    Richard X's
    outsider approach is almost reminiscent of The Shaggs' heartbreaking cover of ""Yesterday Once More"", on
    which you can almost hear them huddled under the covers with their transistor, desperate to make music.
    Fortunately for Richard, technology has bridged the gulf between will/ideas and traditional compositional
    skill. Like 2 Many DJs, Richard is using his cunning, ear, and a lifetime of fandom to celebrate music's
    elasticity, and he's using the relative ease and speed of digital production to lay waste to eras: past,
    present, future.</p><p>
<i>X-Factor</i> features the first official U.S. release of the Sugababes' cover of a Girls on Top single:
    The Tubeway Army/Adina Howard bootleg, ""Freak Like Me"", which shot to No. 1 in the UK. Also included is
    another of his official releases, Liberty X's ""Being Nobody"" (Human League vs. Rufus and Chaka Khan). The
    Sugababes track still sounds as fresh and unstoppable as ever; the Liberty X is more of a grower, at best.</p><p>
    
    Among <i>X-Factor</i>'s other guests is Kelis, whose low profile in the U.S. needed to be rectified about
    four years ago. (If her new record, now delayed until 2004, ends up the victim of long-predicted Neptunes
    shark-jumping, she'll be the unluckiest woman in pop.) The electro-soul of Kelis' solo records is a template
    also followed by Richard X on collaborations with former Soul II Soul vocalist Caron Wheeler (reconstructing
    Lil' Louis' early house track, ""Club Lonely"") and Javine. Ex-Flying Lizards singer Deborah Evans-Strickland--
    sounding like a Miss Kittin prototype-- appears on a pair of tracks, including an almost shuffle-tech
    version of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's ""Walk on By."" Tiga's ""You (Better Let Me Love You x4) Tonight""
    proves he's best at straight-ahead electro-pop than comedy covers.  But the most interesting collaborator
    is Pulp vocalist Jarvis Cocker (wow, are those ever painful words to type), who closes the proceedings with
    an electronic cheek-to-cheek with Hope Sandoval, mixing his own professions of love and lust with Mazzy
    Star's ""Fade Into You.""</p><p>
    
    So how is this not all nostalgia again? Because Richard X is the perfect contemporary artist, a deconstructionist
    who reaches through the past and celebrates both the near-elimination of the Then and Now in our file-sharing/reissue
    era and the democratization of music making of this new digital era. That you can purchase this in a shop
    instead of gawk at it on Artofthemix.com is a testimony to Richard X's PDA Rolodex, innovation, and intuition.
    That you'll want to buy it-- that it sounds so fresh and joyous-- is a testimony to not only Richard X,
    but also Paul Morley and New Pop, electro and club culture, U.S. R&amp;B; producers such as Rodney Jerkins or
    The Neptunes, and anyone else over the past 20 years who argued for the timelessness of sounds that too
    many people claim are mere ephemera.</p></div>"|6897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6897-x-factor-vol-1/|7.7|Scott Plagenhoef

Why we stare at car crashes, why
    we laugh when an old man unsuspectingly slips on a banana peel, why most of us will be in hysterics when
    the Hell's Angels draw and quarter the bassist from Phish.</p><p>
    If this feature of human nature doesn't disgust you, great. Welcome to Enduser. You're going to love this
    guy. An apparent staunch believer in Schadenfreude, Enduser enjoys the idea of otherwise unscathed melodies
    put to the rack, terrorized by the onslaught of a relentless drum-n-bass furor. The whole process is a
    microcosm of the listening experience: the work destroys us as well. Here's an artist staring at us as we're
    thrown headlong out our car windshields.  For some reason, I really get a kick out of this.</p><p>
    An unenjoyable ""bad-sounding"" album is an easy feat; what's more difficult is to produce an <i>enjoyable</i>
    ""bad-sounding"" album. There's a certain charisma to pleasant unpleasantness, and the desire to understand this
    quality is, to me, what drives artists (and their patrons) to take part in aural assault in the first place.
    <i>15 Tracks</i>, Enduser's earlier 2003 release, was so engaging because he was able to bring out a natural
    violence in the most beautiful melodies. Within the vocal melody of ""Björk Was Hiding Under My Bed"", Enduser
    isolated the song's own natural percussive destruction. The beats never completely undermined their source
    material, though; melody always triumphed. <i>15 Tracks</i> put Enduser and his audience on the same side
    of Schadenfreude, since both seemed to be observing together the natural violent tendencies of the album's
    melodies.</p><p>
<i>Sonic Terror Tour 2003</i> is where Enduser's Schadenfreude becomes what may only be described as some
    blissful auto-sadism for the listener: we know we're being terrorized, and we kind of like it. In contrast
    to <i>15 Tracks</i>, Enduser doesn't redeem the melody from its beat subsumation; here, destruction takes
    primacy. The samples are gruesome, and even the piano lines from which the beats grow are drastically less
    melodic. The paradigm has shifted; <i>Sonic Terror Tour 2003</i> is infinitely darker, more violent, less
    enjoyable, but perhaps all the more engaging.</p><p>
    I reiterate how well Enduser gleans the drum loops from the melodies, how unforced it sounds, how naturally
    the latter gives birth to the former-- it's just really stunning here. In an easily impressed music world
    where artists can make enormous names for themselves by just haphazardly looping drums over scarce Jamaican
    rasta lines, it's so refreshing, for instance, how on Track 2 (the tracks are unnamed) Enduser carefully
    matches the intensity of his breaks to the vocal rhythms and a whispery flatted-seventh-to-root synth line.</p><p>
    Similarly, on Track 3, as soon as the piano and guitar haunts trip over themselves, the song falls into a
    maelstrom of bass and snare. Then, a vocal cut-up drives off the storm-- looped in the same rhythm of how
    the piano and guitar fell apart in the first place. Or take Track 9, which starts with a tongue-in-cheek
    late 80s club anthem melody mixed with low-level breaks and indiscernible lyrics, and after countless
    octave modulations and appropriate compensations in rhythmic intensity, ends completely unwound-- our club
    anthem is left to a pathetic loop of ""ass ass, titties titties, ass and titties."" Needless to say, Enduser
    is extremely meticulous, and his diligence serves only to make this album that much more gripping.</p><p>
    Enduser seems to attract the thick-skinned, but even this writer-- who counts himself among them-- was
    sickened at times by Sonic Terror's downright foul audio samples. ""Some girls like men to take a dump on
    them,"" Enduser's closing remark, barely speaks to the extent of Sonic Terror's lyrical brutality. Presumably,
    this was the intended effect, and Enduser is, as much as anyone can be, artfully violent. ""What's it like
    knowing you're about to die?"" introduces Track 7, after which Enduser launches into all-out guerrilla beat
    warfare, stopping the madness only to taunt further: ""I would like to rise and piss on your brain.""</p><p>
    Track 10, with its Fisher Price bell keyboard riff and less intrusive breaks, is the closest to what one
    might consider a ""beautiful song."" After nine tracks of unapologetic eye-pulling, Enduser gives his audience
    a break, so to speak. It's a welcome one, and to reiterate, its higher frequency in <i>15 Tracks</i> made
    that album more accessible.  <i>15 Tracks</i> still may be the place to start with Enduser, but when
    breakbeat suicide strikes your fancy, <i>Sonic Terror Tour 2003</i> is a worthy wormwood.</p></div>"|2782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2782-sonic-terror-tour-2003/|7.9|Nicholas B. Sylvester

    administration: retirement into cynical apathy, zealous support of insurgent candidates, public
    disobedience/intricate placard design, sexual dysfunction induced by mention of the slang term ""bush.""
    Protest energy is especially apparent in the artistic world, the denizens of which are able to channel
    their anger through their chosen medium. Music is particularly under the gun, so to speak, in troubled
    times; with the oft-quoted (but rather weakly supported) claim that republican presidents lead to fertile
    underground scenes, the pressure is on those in the independent sphere.</p><p>
    
    Sam Coomes, conductor of the duo Quasi, has apparently taken this challenge to heart as he navigates his
    band through a mid-career change-of-direction.  Frustrated with the present and worried about the future,
    Coomes has taken solace in the music of the past, allowing the blues influences that drove his recent solo
    project, The Blues Goblins, to seep into Quasi's sound as well.  Trading in his demented organ sound for
    more slide riffs than the ""Layla"" coda, Coomes makes an interesting attempt to address global issues
    through one of the most personal of genres.</p><p>
    
    Of course, he's also taken the curious step of starting to look like a NASCAR fan on the run in an episode
    of <i>Cops</i>-- not to mention saddling his new album with what might be the worst title and cover art
    imaginable.  Such dissonance between goofy aesthetic packaging and serious-minded content throws a dash of
    doubt upon Coomes' motives in adopting Southern musical style, branding it with that air of condescension
    that's so hard to avoid for a modern, white artist trying to avoid coming off like Dan Aykroyd.</p><p>
    
    Musically, however, <i>Hot Shit</i> is a furlong beyond the hollow Depression-era recreation of The Blues
    Goblins, merging Delta tricks into recognizable remnants of the Quasi sound.  ""Good Times"" starts off with
    a wailing gospel choir and trashcan percussion alongside cracked harmonies with drummer Janet Weiss, the
    sole appearance by the good old fuzzy Rocksichord, and a touch of the orchestral sound flirted with on 2001's
    <i>The Sword of God</i>.  ""Good Time Rock N' Roll"" and ""White Devil's Dream"" offset rockabilly riffs and
    harmonica blows with a strange cacophony and Weiss' thick beatings, while Coomes lets his voice (now with
    less monotone!) fly on the usual dark-tinted lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Whether these changes are an improvement, however, is another matter entirely.  Stricken by the same
    backward-looking guitar worship disease that seems to have struck many in the indie community, the
    relentless string-bending and beer-bottle slides can't help but sound like stale recidivism.  Songs that
    find Coomes back in front of keys sound better: the piano-driven clamor-jazz tune ""Drunken Tears"" is a
    symphonic adaptation of the duo at their most effective, circa <i>Featuring ""Birds""</i>, and ""No One"" is
    a pretty moan scored by gloomy fake strings.</p><p>
    
    Yet, the one slice of blues-inflected tuneship that works, ""Master &amp; Dog"", also serves as the thematic high
    point of the album: a simple political cartoon as potent a venomous animal metaphor as their classic ""The
    Happy Prole"".  Coomes' sloganeering elsewhere lays it a bit heavy with the hand, though-- most notably on
    the bridge to ""White Devil's Dream"", where administration members are listed by name and given a cursory
    ""fuck you.""  Not exactly ""Masters of War"", champ.</p><p>
    
    Still, one can't deny Coomes' passion on the topic, nor would I want to suggest censure of his political
    views.  But it's nevertheless unfortunate that Quasi have chosen an archaic sound with limited relevance
    in today's world (bring on the electro anti-war anthems!), not to mention one that doesn't exactly play to
    the band's strengths.  So as spottily effective as their contribution to the political frustration
    derby may seem, the Quasi Blues Odyssey-- not quite the wax museum of Coomes' Blues Goblins side project--
    is even less so.  Though I've got to commend Coomes for attempting to branch out, I can't help but feel
    like there must have been a more intriguing direction.</p></div>"|6616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6616-hot-shit/|5.2|Rob Mitchum

    The Decemberists have another song about pirates.  ""Tell your daughters do not walk the streets alone
    tonight!"" cries Colin Meloy with nasal urgency, and the band gives it more drama than ever before, lunging
    into an aesthetic that's half Dickens, half 1950s adventure comic book.  You can almost smell the mothballs
    on their costumes.  They don't care that some listeners won't even make it past this song, or that some
    people don't want to hear a pirate story no matter how well it's told.</p><p>
    
    The Decemberists may never escape the label ""quirky,"" which is a crime: Whatever the style, Colin Meloy's
    songwriting makes this band one of the strongest working today.  His melodies are so perfect and his words
    so substantial that it reminds you how much slack you cut most other bands.  Too many singers mumble or
    screech as if they didn't trust or care about their words: Meloy declares his lyrics, lets his work live
    or die by them, and sets them deep in masterful pop surroundings.</p><p>
    
    The band's confidence actually makes <i>Her Majesty The Decemberists</i> less accessible than their other
    releases.  Their earliest material, on the <i>5 Songs</i> EP, didn't stray far from acoustic alt-country,
    but their first full-length, <i>Castaways and Cutouts</i>-- which many people discovered only a few months
    ago, thanks to its reissue on Kill Rock Stars-- was a revelation, sometimes brilliant and sometimes a
    beautiful accident.  Its dreamy tone erred on the side of melancholy; by contrast, <i>Her Majesty</i>
    veers toward the theatrical as Meloy steps up the role-playing and tells more intricate stories.</p><p>
    
    On ""Shanty for the Arethusa"" and ""The Chimbley Sweep"", the band marches aggressively past the
    just-skilled-enough playing of their other albums, sounding like a version of The Coral that's twice
    as smart (and half as loud).  The horns, strings and keys they've brought in this time sweeten the
    production, and they nail the upbeat Britpop arrangement on ""Billy Liar"", a song about a dull summer
    break that has what sounds like a lovestruck chorus.  There's also romance in ""A Soldiering Life"", a
    homoerotic ode to the military.  It's winningly clever, and even if it's not the deepest song in their
    repertoire, you have to credit Meloy's enthusiasm when he practically drools the word ""stevedore.""
    It's just one display of the surgical precision of Meloy's lyrics, along with the taut ballad ""Red
    Right Ankle"", or the rich imagery of ""Bachelor and the Bride"".</p><p>
    
    But what's most intriguing about Meloy's style isn't his erudition or kitsch; it's the strange tension he
    creates by mashing both qualities together.  ""Los Angeles I'm Yours"" sounds odd not just because he matches
    the disgusted lyrics with a breezy tune, but because he throws old-fashioned, florid language-- references
    to ""orphans and oligarchs"" and taunts like ""I can see your undies""-- against post-modern Los Angeles.  And
    in ""Red Right Ankle"", he alternates between a metaphorical and anatomical use of the word ""heart.""
    Describing a girl's suitors, he sings, ""Some had crawled their way into your heart/ To rend your ventricles
    apart.""  We know Meloy can slop through pirate gore in one song and write poetry in the next, but it's
    more interesting to hear how easily he can do both-- and how willfully he'll do either.</p><p>
    
    As they've become bolder, The Decemberists have lost some of the uncertain dreaminess of the best songs
    on <i>Castaways</i>-- say, ""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"" or ""Grace Cathedral Hill"".  But <i>Castaways</i>'
    near-transcendent finale, ""California One/Youth and Beauty Brigade"", is matched here by ""I Was Meant for
    the Stage"", where Meloy doesn't just state his ambitions, but stands at the front of the crowd and waits
    for the tomatoes to fly.  Maybe from here they'll become an esoteric cult band, or maybe they'll just keep
    getting better: Either way, The Decemberists have already established themselves so thoroughly that I was
    able to make it through an entire review without comparing them to Neutral Milk Hotel or namechecking
    Edward Gorey.  They're an unclassifiable American original, and they could turn out to be one of our best.</p></div>"|2239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2239-her-majesty-the-decemberists/|8.2|Chris Dahlen

    blasting a bass-heavy ""Hot in Herre"", I was zoned on caffeine and couldn't
    stop listening to <i>Darklands</i>. Somehow, during an otherwise cheerful
    humidity, the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's rain-soaked, starry nightshade emerged
    as my summer jam; its timeless songwriting, vintage atmospherics, anthropomorphic
    feedback, and shut-eye-dreamy pace melded ten echoing heartbreakers into an
    endlessly churning blue-black backdrop easing the transition into Fall. A
    year later, embodying the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's offhanded, emotionally resonant
    cool, are the four women in Detroit's Slumber Party, whose latest album opts
    to strum within a swirl of paper lamps, coffee-breath yawns, and the
    slip-and-slide chill of 1 a.m. dew on bare feet.</p><p>
<i>3</i>'s ten tracks come and go like blurred horizon lines. When they hit
    their stride, endings blend into beginnings like frost-bitten hands
    imperceptibly retreat into wool sweaters and each chord burrows the
    listener further into the orange-drenched sock-hop of an otherwise forgotten
    backyard party as scored with smashed fireflies by Galaxie 500, rollicking
    Mazzy Star, or a young Velvet Underground, sans Warhol's smarmy machinations.
    (Though the band did manage to get heavily German Romantic liner notes written
    by Cary Loren of the decadently fatalistic 70s anti-rock band Destroy All
    Monsters, who created droning film-noir psychedelia hacked apart and reanimated
    by Nico and The Silver Apples. If that doesn't offer at least a tab of credibility...)
    Elaborately 60s downtown without the retro posturing, the Slumber Party wrap
    authentic know-how around simple human longings.</p><p>
    
    The inner sleeve depicts the smiling band with cocked pistols aimed at a
    giant black heart, but otherwise the smiles are pretty rare. Not as mopey
    as icy Codeine and avoiding the pained, hyper-aesthete wallow of Red House
    Painters, a triumphantly defiant track like ""Your Friends"" pairs simple
    guitar parts and a syrupy vocal line to create a gauzy improvisation using
    ""Here Comes the Sun"" as a launching point and Opal's dark magic as a landing
    pad.</p><p>
    
    The album's opener, ""Electric Boots"", is similarly soporific, but with
    quicker drumming-- like Mo Tucker breaking out a primitive ""And Then He
    Kissed Me""-- and a noodly guitar picking and sliding like damp leaves
    falling from an October elm. Here the vocals are insulated with reverb,
    doused with enough distance to become another instrument breathing without
    a specific verbal meaning. When they're audible, the lyrics are an overheard
    conversation: ""To see you treat her so kind, it should turn my eyesight
    blind.""</p><p>
    
    True to its title, ""Air"" flies the vocals higher, introducing more feedback
    than elsewhere, and allowing the band's multi-part harmonizing to rest upon
    slide guitar, beautiful lens-flair reverberations, Shaggs stutter-stop
    harmonizing, and ever-precipitate drum parts. ""Why?"" spins itself around
    piano, uncurling pedal steel, pulsating background analog distortion, and
    what sounds like a distant violin held in check by a removal of all high-end;
    as the song progresses, the violin speaks up, the vocals drift to the
    distance, and the lap steel twists against sighed piano notes like northern
    lights in Kendra Smith's dusted constellations.</p><p>
    
    A few slip-ups crack the spell. ""New Trouble"" falls apart when it goes for
    slinky instead of soporific, turning into a busy, chirping spy theme unhinged
    through extended distortion breaks, a telephone ringer, and a ha-ha band
    discussion. ""Drunk"" has too-upfront percussion and thin vocals reminiscent of
    a weaker Damon &amp; Naomi track.  And then there's ""Black Hearted Rode"", which
    plods along for four uninspired minutes with anomalous harmonica exclamation
    points and a tepid vocal line; fortunately, with nary a minute remaining, it
    shakes off the mid-afternoon ho-hum and resurfaces with jingle bells, <i>Pet
    Sounds</i>-esque instrumental sighing, gentle percussion, and a wash of pink
    and gray AM-radio reverb-- it's quite the dramatic save.</p><p>
    
    Though Slumber Party could branch out into any number of livelier directions,
    for the most they wisely keep to the hazy nocturnal vibe. <i>3</i> isn't as
    powerful or tightly conceived as <i>Darklands</i>, but it does offer quite
    a few hazy gems. And sometimes, as is the case here, imperfection is quite
    enough-- the constant threat of an unwanted sunrise or a noisy misstep adding
    to the important beauty temporary shadows cast upon the prosaic parts of
    your day.</p></div>"|7255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7255-3/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

As the leaves clear out their
    inventory for Fall's savings at JCPenney and school-crossing lights blink back into bloom, so, too-- with
    the metronomic precision and watch-setting punctuality that informs all the fruits of their labor-- does
    Kompakt's harvest of previous seasons' twelve-inches materialize in the form of the latest <i>Total</i>
    comp.</p><p>
    Now in its fifth year, the benevolent yet undeniable power of the German-based minimal techno label comes
    to the fore.  Whether it's dealing with microhouse styles and fey indie styling on Tobias Thomas'
    <i>Smallville</i> mix, or the hammering house glam-slam of Michael Mayer's <i>Speicher</i> set, all free
    radicals can find covalent binding, be it in the encompassing spell of gentle electronic soundscapes (see
    the label's <i>Pop Ambient</i> series), or in the trickier shuffle-step (their <i>Schaffelfieber</i> is
    another comp thread altogether).</p><p>
    The label's mild embracing of pop, which was made obvious in recent releases (see T. Raumschmiere's
    <i>Komeit</i>, or Superpitcher's recent remixes of Dntel, Quarks, and Eno), is immediately detectable
    here, as the comp opens with recent Force Inc signee SCSI-9 having a go at Duran Duran's ""All She Wants
    Is"".  As Anton Kubinov washes out Stephen Duffy's insipid vocal line with dubby bubbles, soaring synth
    vapors, and crisp digital creaks, singer Phong Sui's limp vocalise of ""You wasted every summer, you wasted
    every day"" fades into the slapping beat of Burger/Voigt's contribution, ""Wintermute"".  M. Mayer, one of the
    pillars of the label, brings a basketball sample to dribble out a beat on his deadpan personification of
    ""Speaker"".  It's eventually joined by a clapping hi-hat and smaller percolating elements that wiggle in
    amongst the Kompakt cogs, their hooks worming in effortlessly.</p><p>
    Justus Köhncke's ""Homogen"" conjures up a hazy conga pattern and pill-fried guitar lick that Arif Mardin or
    the Salsoul Orchestra could have cooked up, which mixes with echoing percussion to create a puddle of
    beatless mind-melt on the disco-floor before phasing back into crystalline focus for the fantastic finale,
    in which a billowing, arpeggiated cloud swallows every last bit of sound.  Superpitcher steps up again with
    the spore-ific stomp of ""Mushroom"", all fat, slippery fungoid bass squishes with a Gas-eous and, dare I say,
    haunting, melody rising behind it.</p><p>
    Rattling ratchet turns and mechanic scissor-snips orbit the slow, syrupy bass of Mikkel Metal's track, an
    echoing guitar plucked and vocoded suggestion injected for melodic good measure. And finally, Jonas Bering
    brings the hour-plus of new music to a close with the slow reshuffling of Basic Channel and classic
    krautrock elements on ""Normandie 2"". Some cogs get replaced, but the elements remain the same, be they
    gaseous, liquid, or solid, and even as the seasons change, Kompakt slightly changes up their approach
    while remaining as comfortable and dependable as ever.</p></div>"|2019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2019-total-5/|7.7|Andy Beta

Bob!  My
    Friend!</i>, but their triumphant return couldn't have come at a better time.  Released to critical fanfare
    (particularly from your pals at Pitchfork) but criminally overlooked by the indie masses, <i>Hey! Bob!</i>
    hit just ahead of the cusp of the 80s resurgence-- roughly a year before the genres the band holds so dear
    (new-wave, no-wave, electro) were embraced by every hipster with a gaggle of Contortions records and a
    jones for hot-pink.  A shame, too, as that record's brilliantly unhinged Devo-via-Japanoise deconstructionist
    ditties are still head and shoulders above most of the art-punk flotsam that's been released since.</p><p>
    
    Intent to stay one full step ahead of the rest of the world-- or more likely just too hyper to sit still--
    Polysics have forged ahead with <i>Neu</i>, now rocking a style one might describe as ""abrasive electronic
    post-punk.""  The influence of the record's namesake is conspicuously absent this time around (it was only
    mildly detectable on the last record, with the exception of some distinctly motorik drumming); the band has
    instead opted to expose more of its no-wave roots: <i>Neu</i> hiccups and jerks in a manner more consistent
    with Polysics' U.S. contemporaries than any of avant-prog/psych-rock shredders more commonly associated
    with their homeland.  In fact, tracks like the dizzying ""MS-17"" and the completely ballistic guitar frenzy
    of ""Urge On!"" place them in the same ballpark as Williamsburg's current cream-of-the-crop.</p><p>
    
    More than any other current act, Polysics display not just the desire, but also the deranged nervous energy
    and raw talent, to inherit the spaz-rock throne left vacant by 90s Moog-core heroes (and fellow Devo
    enthusiasts) Brainiac.  ""Xct""'s bizarre synth squiggles, vocoder interjections, and delirious vocalizations
    conjure the ghost of the dearly departed Timmy Taylor, while ""X-Rays (This is My Life)"" absolutely nails
    that familiar Brainiac hip-shake groove.</p><p>
    
    But Polysics aren't leaving without turning their own unique signatures into trademarks. ""Making Sense"", all
    preening vocals and ""You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)""-style synths, is <i>Neu</i>'s poppiest highlight:
    with radioactive blurts and choppy digibeat accents taking its pummeling drum fills and overdriven guitar
    riffs hostage, it updates and reinvents the brightest moments of the New Romantic era with more charisma
    and creativity than any club full of electroclashing fashionista goons could ever hope to.  And ""What"",
    the album's sole downtempo track, sits on a laid-back groove encrusted with familiar vocodered vocals,
    providing a brief abeyance from the rest of the album's raving-mad paroxysms.</p><p>
    
    Despite this record's spazcore conviction-- the antithesis of traditional, hipster-defined ""cool""--
    <i>Neu</i> rages and rants in total style.  Today's musical climate is far more hospitable toward this
    kind of rampant, maniacal depravity, and with the album's beefed-up, more varied, and generally more <i>rock</i>
    nature updating <i>Hey! Bob!</i>'s nerdy new-wavisms, Polysics are destined for the top of the neo-no-wave
    heap.  Here's hoping <i>Neu</i> won't go unnoticed.</p></div>"|6396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6396-neu/|8.3|Brad Hurst

Now, I do believe Mr. Jurado has a Mrs. Jurado at home,
    and though the last thing I aspire to be is a homewrecker, I cannot shirk what I see as a journalistic
    duty. Since the release of 1999's gratifying <i>Rehearsals for Departure</i> some four years ago, five
    labels (Sub Pop, Made in Mexico, Burnt Toast Vinyl, Secretly Canadian, Acuarela) have been graced with a
    Damien Jurado recording.  Five labels in four years?  He must be very popular.  Someone had better keep
    an eye on him before he forgets how to get home and Jade Tree offers him a ride.</p><p>
    
    His latest release, a five-track EP edited and released by Acuarela Discos out of Spain, marks the first
    time Jurado has lent his talents to another continent.  As is the case with many EPs, the album is less a
    cohesive statement than a collection of somewhat unrelated and distinct material.  Here, Damien partly cuts
    the songs from the cloth he wore for his last full-length (which is less than four months in the grave),
    employing the same haunting balance of sparse, lo-fi acoustic architecture to frame quick, bleak, personal
    narratives.</p><p>
    
    ""I Am the Greatest of All Liars"" unconvincingly delivers a first-person laundry list of iniquities such
    as, ""I'm the blood upon your sheets/ I'm the air you cannot breathe,"" over a stale piano and simple drum
    for less than two minutes-- and to no effect.  It's as if I've heard him sing these lyrics already, only
    before he was kind enough to also subtlety kick out a lovely melody and nimbly kiss my ears with his golden
    pipes.  Here it feels like an act.  ""Oh Death Art with Me"" and ""Big Let Down"" are vintage Jurado (<i>really</i>
    vintage-- like <i>Waters Ave. S.</i>-era) , if not the sort that fail to truly cater to his strengths, but
    they also play it too safe to stumble.  And the closer, ""Butcher's Boy"", is an innocuous acoustic blues
    number with textbook mortality issues.</p><p>
    
    ""Now You're Swimming"", however, is the reason you put on a Jurado record.  Stark, and delirious with portent,
    he begins, ""Now you're swimming/ It don't even feel right.""  The sound is layered but reserved, and it seems
    as if the song is intransigently grounded.   Then, an inspired Jurado sings with unaffected solemnity a
    sanguine yet shrewd chorus that sneaks in from left field before falling again to the dirt. It's the sort
    of effortless moment he should always be able to conjure. Without the inclusion of this track, the disc
    feels nearly stultifying, but with it, altogether pleasant.</p></div>"|4327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4327-holding-his-breath-ep/|6.0|William Morris

Snare. Kick. Snare. Hi-hat. Although producers have moved past the classic boom-bap drum pattern, it's
    still pivotal for artists to know the past before creating the future. Surrounded by the highly polished
    sample fests of RJD2 and the ridiculously technical chop-a-thons of Prefuse 73, Push Button Objects is lost
    in the fold, regardless of his clear production prowess.</p><p>
    
    Sounding like a more basic mix of Jel and Prefuse 73, Edgar Farinas' sound is effectively simple sample
    chops and deep atmospherics. Not bad by any means, but nothing that will change the way you think about
    instrumental hip-hop. His pieces range from perfectly accessible funk (""Fly"") to ambient lo-fi thriller
    (""3 Doctors"") and while variety is essential to any good beat disc, the instrumental tracks aren't all
    clinics at Beatmaking 101.</p><p>
    
    The purely wordless tracks are less than outstanding, sounding like uninspired concepts that never got
    fleshed out. Farinas seems content to leave loops without any expansion, other than basic sample displacement.
    The only impressive piece is the opener ""Hustlin'"", consisting of hard mechanical drums, a sinister bassline,
    the Oompa Loompa sample made famous by Prince Paul, and a Shadow-esque sequence of battle scratches that
    makes for an interesting, varied listening experience-- something the rest of the instrumentals might have
    enjoyed.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the best songs on the collection are the ones with lyrical accompaniment.  Guests run the gamut of
    the underground, with Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Mr. Lif, Akrobatik and Maintain, among others, bringing
    life to Edgar's beats. It soon becomes clear that his best component is his ability to make beats that
    suit the artist. Standouts include Aesop Rock dropping an intelligent hoodlum on the easy listening acoustic
    guitar melody of ""Shut Down"" (""Hopped up on Clonopin, kicking it to college girls/ I'll fuck you blind but
    I need to borrow a dollar first/ For stogies, guitar and pussy, like all I've got to look forward to""), and
    Vast Aire blows the summer-y cymbal-driven rhythm of ""Fly"" (""You could play my verse backwards and hear a
    flower growing/ Play it forward and all y'all snoring"").</p><p>
    
    While some songs fall flat (""Air"" with Dose One sounds like a cLOUDDEAD outtake without the mindblowing
    Odd Nosdam beat to keep it afloat), Push Button Objects shows serious promise for future projects.
    Hopefully, he can move from this traditional work into more experimental spaces with his obvious production
    talent.</p></div>"|6522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6522-ghetto-blaster/|7.2|Rollie Pemberton

    ones that become legendary.  For each of these bands, though, there will always be several lesser bands
    who catch the whiff greatness as it passes them by, and they will follow.  If enough bands catch on and
    begin mimicking, someone will invariably call it a ""movement,"" validate the lot of them, and move onto
    the next wave.</p><p>
    That's the preamble to one of the oldest clichés in the book, and if I may, I'd like to paraphrase the
    well-worn slogan itself for you now: ""The Bad Brains were more than just a hardcore band.""  It's been said
    countless times about countless less worthy candidates, but where the Brains are concerned, that doesn't
    make it any less truthful.  As one of the single most important pillars of American hardcore, and the
    keystone of D.C.'s particularly sharp-tongued variation on the theme, listening to the Brains at their
    legendary peak makes me want to lapse into all sorts of glib pronouncements about the failing rut of the
    current scene they helped to pioneer back in the early 80s.  But I won't-- it's a disservice to the band,
    and if ever such a tired cliché was so apt, it's here; by the time they released their artistic milestone,
    <i>I Against I</i>, and reggae influences had spread deeper and deeper into their sound, the Bad Brains
    had already forgotten more about hardcore than most of their successors would ever learn.</p><p>
    They've been compiled several times before, but the crucial evolution of their classic rasta-punk
    hybridization over three magnificent albums was more than any one disc could bear.  <i>Banned in D.C.</i>
    is the first to finally get it right; Anthony Countey, the group's manager, has compiled what truly amounts
    to the definitive single-disc statement on the scope and the fury of the Bad Brains' revolutionary hardcore.
    From the unforgettable opening riff of ""Pay to Cum"", their famously anthemic, idealistic tirade against
    systems of control and the prevention of free expression, to the darkly relaxed reggae of ""Love Prophets"",
    the full range of their development probably couldn't have been managed more succinctly.  H.R.'s alternately
    soul-deep or bile-encrusted wailing, spitting, and sneering, Dr. Know's lacerating speed-metal riffs, and
    the kaleidoscopic shifting of Earl Hudson's and Daryl Jenifer's lightning-quick punk-dub rhythms are
    flawlessly represented on every track.</p><p>
    There's brilliance in Countey's track sequencing; forsaking chronology is almost always retarded (and that's
    being kind about it), and for a band that grew so steadily as musicians, it ought to be fatal, but he
    escapes his certain fate.  Instead, tracks are pulled mainly from the creative zenith of the Brains'
    earliest, most relevant material, with only enough later work included to represent the band's later
    development, seamlessly progressing from the anarchic, rage-fueled blitz exemplified on the now-legendary
    <i>Bad Brains</i> cassette into the relatively calmer waters of later recordings (but mercifully not much
    further than 1989's <i>Quickness</i>).  The focus is on providing smooth passage across their history, and
    by concentrating on flow over time, this becomes a truly great whole-album experience-- something the Brains
    were only able to achieve on <i>I Against I</i>.</p><p>
    There are issues to be taken with this comp, too, however slight: I'm a little miffed that <i>I Against
    I</i> is almost criminally under-represented.  <i>Quickness</i> gets far more than an equitable amount of
    time for my liking (on paper, anyway).  Two previously vinyl-only versions of album tracks and a totally
    forgettable unreleased instrumental (""Riot Squad"") offer little beyond that warm feeling that strange,
    anal-retentive completists must feel deep-down knowing that they have every everything released by their
    pet artists (though in all fairness, the included live video of ""I Against I"" is incredible-- it made me
    wish I was forty so I could've been there).  Of course, anyone with a deep fondness for the Bad Brains
    can put together a list of personal omissions, but in the end, the amazing cohesion of <i>Banned in D.C.</i>
    will probably put to rest any real objection.  If most comps can only offer snapshots of a band's history,
    this is a movie, and a great one at that.</p></div>"|519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/519-banned-in-dc-bad-brains-greatest-riffs/|9.1|Eric Carr

    Motorcycle Club means embracing the vacant, apathetic stare that goes hand-in-hand with just being <i>cool</i>,
    twenty-four hours a day.  The problem is, this kind of Creation-catalog-worshipping mod posing can be both
    distancing and incredibly tiring.  Sure, sneering and flipping up the collar on your leather jacket are
    perfectly badass gestures, but they're also achingly familiar ones-- particularly for the BRMC, which is
    nuts, given that this is only their second album.</p><p>
    
    As the image suggests, though, BRMC don't fuck around: their sophomore disc, <i>Take Them On, On Your
    Own</i>, is packed end-to-end with tight, clenched-fist rock cockiness; its twelve impenetrable songs
    bulldoze with fuck-off lyrics, mercilessly effects-heavy guitar, huge, throbbing drum beats, and
    avalanche basslines.  But there are recognizable affections, too, and when they pop up, they're either
    intensely alienating (the record opens with the fitting admission, ""We don't like you/ We just want to
    try you"") or devastatingly boring (the predictably aggressive refrain of ""Generation"").</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, there are a handful of transcendent moments to be found, provided you're willing to invest
    the time it takes to sniff them out-- which you should, since this is one of those records that matures
    with subsequent spins.  Check the face-flattening power of Peter Hayes' prickly guitar cuts on ""Rise or
    Fall"", Robert Turner's woozy, tender howls sliding all over the unexpectedly acoustic ""And I'm Aching"",
    Nick Jago's pounding drum fervor on closer ""Heart and Soul"", and the punkish, bouncing choruses of ""Six
    Barrel Shotgun"" and ""In Like the Rose"".</p><p>
    
    There are also some political agendas being pushed here, as BRMC tackle national identity and brazen
    superpower ideology with their now-trademark contempt.  In style and sound, BRMC have always swayed a
    little bit Brit (even if their Californian-to-Anglo ratio remains a strict 2:1), and ""US Government"",
    the band's pissy homeland diatribe, could, if stripped of its title, be just as easily applied to the
    dealings of Tony Blair.</p><p>
    
    Spitting vitriolic quips like ""We are the ones that keep you down/ We are the
    ones that warm the ground while our arms surround,"" and, ""You know they were never, never yours to kill/
    Oh no, they were never, never yours to kill,"" Turner obliquely takes on (on his own?) all of Washington's
    shady affairs without ever getting specific enough to actually wander into true, sharp-toothed dissidence.
    Consequently, ""US Government"" fails to strike as anything more than a vague and boyish suggestion of
    distrust-- less cumbersome than Eddie Vedder tearing up a rubber Bush mask onstage, but not as coyly
    subversive as it could have been.</p><p>
    
    Still, it's a rush of a rock song: opening with a series of high-pitched, distorted pings and descending
    into a murky, clawing guitar mess, Turner's slow, mangled delivery (each word struggles, nobly, to eek out
    of his presumably pursed lips) sees every syllable dipped in a syrupy coat of disdain, and by the time the
    warped and echoed vocals-and-guitar breakdown arrives at the end, ""US Government"" has become a genuinely
    chilling lament.</p><p>
    
    With the exception of a few notable highlights, <i>Take Them On, On Your Own</i> plays like a more consistent
    version of BRMC's eponymous debut.  Tonally, the record doesn't differ much from its predecessor-- or from
    itself.  But regardless of whether this self-duplication is intentional or not, the repetition, coupled
    with the album's dense, reverberating volume, can become awfully grating.  Unfortunately, BRMC's signature
    garage-gone-psychedelic-gone-shoegazer aesthetic, which has always bordered on bloated, is inherently
    opposed to overexposure; tracks like the ultimately negligible ""Ha Ha High Babe"" call unwanted attention
    to the gobs of heavy, distorted riffing and opaque vocals that BRMC consistently employ.  To aggravate the
    issue, <i>Take Them On</i> also suffers from an alarmingly poor, end-heavy track sequencing (although
    making you wait for the good shit seems like an appropriately snarky move).</p><p>
    
    BRMC aren't the first band to mine and mimic the dark, sweaty annals of sneer-rock, nor are they alone in
    cultivating an off-album swagger that serves as a useful accompaniment to their in-studio bluster.  But
    even though <i>Take Them On, On Your Own</i> chugs along like a glacier-- massive, cold, and flattening--
    the chance of it really changing our landscape seems pretty small.</p></div>"|771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/771-take-them-on-on-your-own/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

    is named ""Music to Hold Hands To"". The title is a perfect description of the band's aims: to write sweet
    yet polite songs about crushes that are reciprocated, comfortable shoulders on which to lean, and valuing
    understated, tender moments. The lyric, however-- ""I could never understand you/ Hating music to hold hands
    to/ Sometimes something you can dance to is the last thing that you need""-- hint at a different reality,
    one of heartache, disappointment, and poor timing. In The Lucksmiths' world, the results never seem to
    match expectations-- and it's often for a lack of trying.</p><p>
    These charming young chaps have made a career relishing unemployment, idle conversations at the pub, and
    lazy, sunny days.  On their sixth album, <i>Naturaliste</i>, many of the band's hallmarks-- clever turns
    of phrases, a gift for sweet melodies, an odd obsession with the weather-- are present, but their once
    mostly jaunty, jangly pop is now often swapped for wistful, plaintive melodies. The band seems to be
    grappling with the perils of advancing age (all three of vocalist/drummer Tali White, guitarist Marty
    Donald, and bassist Mark Monnone write songs). Where they once sung about awkward first meetings and
    nervous beginnings, they're now lamenting lost loves and uncomfortable endings. Some of the record's best
    tracks have tinges of regret or painful self-awareness: the vanity of opener ""Camera-Shy"", the pensive,
    long-distance love of ""The Sandringham Line"", and the misplaced familiarity of lover's spats in ""The
    Perfect Crime"".</p><p>
    Former single ""Midweek Midmorning"", a punchy, irresistible ode to savoring the moment while it lasts, is
    another highlight. Best of all perhaps is ""Stayaway Stars"", which features melancholy tongue-twisters such
    as: ""What sorry sights we sometimes are/ These sameshit nights under stayaway stars/ These sameshit nights
    in the saddest bars/ The city lights and the stayaway stars.""</p><p>
    So here are The Lucksmiths: Drifting away from lovers, cocooned by loneliness, a bit paralyzed by both the
    encroachment of age and having to put juvenilia in the rearview. And they blame no one but themselves. ""I'm
    trying hard not to be so antisocial/ Truth be told, I'm not entirely hopeful,"" White sings on ""The Boy That
    Goes Out"". ""Look back on brighter days/ A microscope on how the simple things are done/ But don't look too
    long to the sun/ 'Cause you'll see faults/ As there are faults in everyone,"" he warns on ""Sleep Well"".</p><p>
    This is the sound of the loneliness of the aging indie pop star. The Lucksmiths still possess an eye for
    detail, ornate harmonies, bewitching melodies, and sharp wit, but each is in less supply these days. Those
    who have grown old with the band will find comfort in <i>Naturaliste</i>'s autumnal tones; if there's still
    a fair bit of spring in your step, it's probably best to keep a <i>Happy Secret</i>.</p></div>"|4908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4908-naturaliste/|6.2|Scott Plagenhoef

I mean everyone. Do you play guitar?  Drums, sing, scat?  Seriously, just
    try not to rock.  Skibbety bop-bop-don't believe me?  I don't care if you're an avant-garde underground
    dance-jazz pianist; you're gonna rock.  And you're gonna like it.  All you have to do is round up your
    friends and petition your label for support.  Everyone's doing it.  It's a tenuous case history, but check
    it out: Saddle Creek has Desaparecidos, Matador has The New Pornographers, Barsuk has The Long Winters,
    and Suicide Squeeze offers us The Magic Magicians; a place where artists can shed their individual
    reservations and primary aspirations and just plain rock.  It's a safe haven, in this case for 764-HERO's
    John Atkins and Joe Plummer of Black Heart Procession, where everything is warm and fuzzy and no one cares
    how you spend your working hours.</p><p>
    
    Atkins does it all, singing and strumming and plucking, while Plummer takes a seat behind the drums. A few
    other willing-to-rockers join the mix, including Quasi's Janet Weiss and Justin Trosper of Unwound, to name
    a few.  I told you everyone wants to rock.  And rock they do.  For about thirty minutes, The Magic Magicians
    do nothing else, as they canter their way through eleven unaffected, unadorned one-take sounding garage pop
    numbers. It's no wonder this sort of project is so alluring; if they bought an hour of studio time they
    probably used half of it to play a quick game of Jenga and down a few Mr. Pibbs.  There's no fighting over
    post-recording knob tweaking in the studio, and it's this palpable levity that frames the entire effort.
    Sometimes crisp, never clean: the sound is rough but catchy, and all the while carefree. Whereas both
    primary players have a proclivity for musical histrionics, there's no home for sentimentalist camp here.</p><p>
    
    Rhythmic guitars trade time in the spotlight with confident drumming.  ""Cascade Express"" pairs the two in
    a tight verse that perfectly serves an impossibly catchy chorus.  The song is gone before you knew it was
    there, and much like the successful formula predicated by Spoon's <i>A Series of Sneaks</i>, the album's
    best moments are its least indulgent. Similarly, ""Action"" utilizes some tight drum and guitar alignments
    to fabricate a slick groove, but doesn't press the issue, leaving and returning to the formula with ease
    and wily-veteran respect for inertia.  Predictably, the two slower numbers are pushed to the end.  The
    closer, ""8 Hours Go"", being the more accomplished of the two, as the chorus of ""All Sewn Up"" could easily
    be a discarded 764-HERO moment.  For the most part, though, Atkins and Plummer manage to shirk old penchants,
    something at which they were considerably less adept on their debut, <i>Girls</i>.</p><p>
    
    Yes, it's all fairly predictable.  If the song is plodding then it's resting up to sprint, if it's
    digressing then it's about to focus, and if it's rocking and tight then it's gonna loosen up.   But they
    waste little time in the process and should be rewarded for such a streamlined effort.  And even considering
    the limited palette, the album never drags.  Admittedly, it's missing something, but given the limitations
    of this sort of lo-fi pop, nothing I'm overly fond of.  It's rock, see.  No excuses.</p></div>"|5035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5035-magic-magicians/|6.7|William Morris

    Tonya Harding sending the goon squad after Nancy Kerrigan, or those nice Canadians getting bilked by
    a bribed judge, there's always scandal to be had somewhere in professional skating.  I guess.  I don't
    really follow skating that closely (really!), but it's a sport that exposes a great many very young
    individuals to a great deal of fame, and that's just a recipe for disaster right there.  Putting that
    much pressure on little kids is just begging for a crop of one-gloved nose-jobbers and triple divorcees.</p><p>
    Failing to shed any light on this debate are the guys in The Twin Atlas, in spite of an album title
    promising in-depth coverage.  Even ""The Game Is Fixed"", the one song that seems on the surface primed to
    address the theme at hand, contains more references to baseball than triple axels.  Of course, the way
    Sean Byrne and Luke Zaleski make music together, it hardly matters what they're singing about-- the lyrics
    are secondary to the floating ambience they strive so hard to create.  Byrne, you may know, was a central
    member of Jersey psychedelphians Lenola, a band that split this summer, and The Twin Atlas has for four
    years served as the outlet for his more pastoral side-- this is actually the Atlas' sixth full-length
    this millennium.</p><p>
    The band's sound hasn't change much in that time, but it's a great sound, and the duo has gradually refined
    what they do, each time turning out a more concise, more consistent album.  Their last one, <i>Bring Along
    the Weather</i> only came out like six months ago, and it brought their rustic glow to full shine.  But if
    that album was a hazy weekend in Pennsylvania Dutch country, <i>Inside the Skate Scandal</i> is a day trip
    to Cape May: breezy, bright and close enough to Atlantic City that you can catch the occasional glimpse of
    neon.</p><p>
    One criticism that's easy to level at The Twin Atlas is that their sound is inherently monochromatic.
    Those iridescent harmonies, like a choir of sedated Doug Martsches, sound great, but they never really
    change from song to song.  To make up for this, they hint at other genres, which works to a degree.  ""Sound
    in Town"" is a little bit country, while ""Walk Right Up"" is-- no shit-- a little bit rock 'n' roll.  But in
    each case, it truly is just a little bit.  The country of the former lies mostly with its rhythmic sway,
    while the latter breaks through its pop façade with a guitar buzz that could easily have come off a Lenola
    record.</p><p>
    The boys slip some weird folk flourishes into the mix on ""Washing You Away"", a strange, pensive song full
    of little ponging noises that sound like they wandered out of a 1968 Pink Floyd session.  ""Plan to Erase""
    is a gently strummed acoustic number thrown off course by a drunken banjo, sleigh bell percussion, and a
    Melodica that nods to some sort of medieval Beach Boys.  The instrumental finale, though, titled ""It Will
    Pass"", is a nice touch, a throbbing confection of soaring slide guitar, organ harpsichord and soft-toned
    synth.</p><p>
    It's the best parting shot The Twin Atlas have worked up yet, a fitting way to end their strongest album
    to date.  They seem to be consciously crafting their albums now, as opposed to simply throwing a bundle
    of songs in varying stages of development together and calling it a record.  Maybe this has something to
    do with bringing the project out from Lenola's shadow and trying to make it more presentable in the process.
    But whatever the reason, The Twin Atlas are moving in the right direction.</p></div>"|8214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8214-inside-the-skate-scandal/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    brother from <i>The Goonies</i>.</p><p>
    
    ARTIST THIS ALBUM MOST TRUMPS: Frank Black-- not to be confused with Black Francis or Charles Thompson.
    <i>Amigo Row</i> is the mature-but-not-boring, laid-way-back singer/songwriter album that Black's been
    struggling to half-make for years. Suggs' embodiment of the Pixie-cum-pooper is uncanny, down to the lisp,
    spaciness, and the nervous, breathy falsetto. Intimations of Black Francis' girl-name-dropping <i>Bossanova</i>

    ARTIST MOST HAUNTING THIS ALBUM: Stephen Malkmus. Suggs' old band Butterglory (who themselves most haunt
    the hyper tease ""Calm Down"") couldn't escape Pavement Junior labels, despite their growth from a
    college-radio-rock-by-numbers lo-fi concern into the guiteurs of <i>Are You Building a Temple in Heaven?</i>
    and the standoffish New Zealandry of <i>Rat-Tat-Tat</i>.  The Wedding Present even covered both bands
    (Pavement's ""Box Elder"" and Butterglory's ""Waiting on the Guns""). Suggs' two solo discs have weirdly
    paralleled the permanent-afternoon trip-pop of Malkmus' two self-helmed excursions. This album's ""Jonathan
    Montgomery"" chugs along on a mean, Frosty-thick, mid-70s riff similar in sasstiness to SM's ""Black Book"",
    even if Suggs' track pauses for piano-bar buildups.</p><p>
    
    EXTRATEXTUAL REASONS TO SAMPLE THIS DISC'S MELLOW GOLD: Contrary to Digital Underground's hardsell, no one
    ever invented sex packets. The department store Dillard's features a ""punk"" clothing section. People are
    using ""oxycontin"" as a verb, like ""rollin"" or ""ballin."" Plastic surgeons are working to get small breasts
    considered a medical condition (""micromastia"").</p><p>
    
    FILM THIS ALBUM MOST EVOKES: <i>Jesus' Son</i>. Some stumbly, tragicomic, Arizonian quality in this record
    fits Alison Maclean's debut adaptation of Denis Johnson's overbeloved drug stories. If Maclean was male,
    she would have been heralded as a gawk-plex messiah.</p><p>
    
    BUT YOU KNOW: All these border-town lyrics about ""Tehachapi girls"" have got me thinking Suggs favors an
    anoxeric Benicio del Torso.</p><p>
    
    WORST SONG: ""New Year"". They's even a reference to that song that rhymes with ""Mold Fang Whine"".  They's
    even a reference to resolutions.  This pianode is unfortunately the closest Suggs comes to sentimentality,
    though his speaker is still all intoxicated and trapped and alienated.  I just don't get these
    Gregorian-significance poses.  An indie Elton Joel, anyone?  Mom?  Mulchpile?</p><p>
    
    ALTERNATE TITLES THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED: <i>Albuquerque Nosebleeds</i>. <i>Painting Ranchy Patterns in the
    Cojones Hotel Lobby</i>.</p><p>
    
    ACTUAL NEU-HIPPIE NAME OF BACKING BAND: Thee Higher Burning Fire. Consider an Anomoanon being dry-gulched
    by The Band in a world where The Band formed after The Velvet Underground had busted up.</p><p>
    
    MOST MYSTERIOUS SONG: ""Father"". Yes! Where could a fella order a whole set of tracks like this one, which
    cops a Taps-tone and might be about some kind of assassination? The speaker is being tracked down by
    horsemen, and his father is as impotent as the dad in J.M.Coetzee's <i>Disgrace</i>. The lack of explanation
    adds so much to the song's passionate creeps. Thee Higher Burning Fire plinks and plods with such coherent
    grace that I must scream to you the virtues of how excellently Brian ""Sure, I'll Produce It"" Paulson
    captured the crispness of the four November days when this record became data.</p><p>
    
    BEST OPENING LINES: This honor goes to ""Darling Hannah"", which begins, ""You were rapping on and on about
    some hocus pocus virtue/ That carried you away to the downtown fuck scene."" Wow. I told you this thing was
    Malkmus-haunted. The song accretes to constitute an excellent wedge of Suggs' strident saloonism, eventually
    abandoning the predictable plane of breakup songs and vaulting itself into the slutmosphere, or maybe the
    regretmosphere.</p></div>"|7556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7556-amigo-row/|7.5|William Bowers

    reconstruction of Captain Beefheart-- except that this band's version of the legendary acid-soaked
    California cornball would be decked out in a Black Candy t-shirt and smoking up on the leas of Olympia's
    Evergreen College.  But to call these guys a mere knockoff would be plainly inaccurate: Old Time Relijun's
    longtime frontman Arrington de Dionyso (billed apart from the rest of the band here, for reasons which
    will become clear later) also shares some of the more rambling compositional leanings of sometime Relijun
    drummer Phil Elvrum's Microphones project, albeit stripped of its nature-boy preciousness and less
    successful in tossing disparate sunspots together into one unified, fuzzed-out menagerie.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Dionyso seems more interested in investigating animal languages, tongues of fire, and Walt
    Whitman hoboism than imparting any narrative epiphany to the listener.  And despite his own purposeful
    eccentricities, he admirably transcribes his corncob dreams as though they're concrete maps to opaque
    surfaces; and not even half as pretentious as he could be, he seamlessly works <i>Where the Wild Things
    Are</i> into the refrains of his manifesto, <i>A Kabbalist Exegesis of Old Time Relijun</i>.</p><p>
    
    Sporting a John-the-Baptist-cum-Abraham-Lincoln beard and sounding at times like Yoko Ono conjoining with
    Tom Waits and Jad Fair to painstakingly rewrite the Jesus Lizard back catalog as countrified scrawl,
    Dionyso launches from Tiny Tim whimpers to high-pitched inhuman squeals, throaty bullfrog scat, and dewy
    mountain-top bellows in a matter of seconds. His gusto is impressive, but oft times lacking a clear-sighted
    cosmology for his discursive, shambling worldview-- his consistently twisted enunciations lose power,
    previously novel cadences blend into overdone sameness, and his rickety rollercoaster backing band becomes
    a predictable merry-go-round.</p><p>
<i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, a collection of twenty-one unreleased sermons or unheard alternate
    versions of previously released material, is the band's first full-length since 2001's more successfully
    honed <i>Witchcraft Rebellion</i>.  Twenty minutes longer than its predecessor, this longwinded retrospective
    contains a multitude of versions of certain bits of songs, often moving from Dionyso's one-man four-track
    work to the more fleshed-out approach of he and his rotating crew of back-up players. These are interesting
    as studies in composition, but the repetition slows the passion down, stalling the bombast into a tired
    holding pattern of indulgently predicated aftertastes.</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, though, one of the strongest tracks is one of these repeats. The first of two versions of
    ""Telephone Call"" showcases Prince's ""Kiss"" blended with a serving of <i>Doolittle</i>-era Black Francis-style
    preachin' man vocalizations: Imagine ""Wave of Mutilation"" as a soulful come-on, broken into staccato, and
    physically, freakishly dismembered. Another keeper, the organ-driven ""Black Cat"" introduces a nice shift
    to the standard foaming-at-the-mouth approach.  Reminiscent of the Bad Livers or a jive-talking Daniel
    Johnston, it blends spoken gibberish, Ono-esque machine gun stutters, and a faintly audible sermon treading
    beneath increasingly vocal organ sustain into a finely catchy pop excursion.</p><p>
    
    There's much to like about Old Time Relijun, and Dionyso's previous dreamquests have yielded a robust stab
    at busted-plank outsider hiss, but on this unfocused retrospective, the randomly placed stylistic tweaks
    and vaguely useful repetitions can't raise the hue and cry beyond a mishmash of <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>
    envy. At the end of the spaz attack, it's the smartly plotted cohesion of Dionyso's proper recordings that
    creates a forward-moving juggernaut; here, amid the schizophrenic haberdashery, the autistic Hugo Ball
    schtick runs thin too soon.</p></div>"|5969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5969-varieties-of-religious-experience/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

    a night on the town, partying old school South Texas-style just so he knows where I'm coming from and why
    I have so few brain cells left. I picked him up in my Oldsmobile Cutlass and handed over a lukewarm Lone
    Star tallboy as we cruised through the east side of Austin. I already polished off two, hence I was driving,
    while simultaneously rolling up the finest in migraine-inducing Mexican dirt weed to help Ott ""feel the
    noize."" I popped in the new Those Peabodys eight-track and cranked it up on my system.</p><p>
    
    Ott: Christ, you might want to replace the tissue paper on your speakers you got in here. The low end is
    swampy like Town Lake. And uh, what is this wretched classic rock rip-off you're buzzkilling me with?</p><p>
    
    Beta: Dude, new Those Peabodys, <i>Unite Tonight</i>. You should've seen their hair when they opened for
    Trail of Dead. Well, they didn't send me a cover on this one, but trust me, they rock live and their hair
    looks good. Here, hit this-- <i>pffffffffft</i>.</p><p>
    
    Ott: Can they do anything other than step on the wah pedal and do pedestrianly pull-offs and hammer-ons on
    their Les Pauls? I mean, there are Iommi-like structures to the insipidly titled ""All My Friends Are Good""--
    but the riffs keep leading down dead ends. Where's the payoff?</p><p>
    
    Beta: What about the cowbells and Thin Lizzy licks of ""What's Up Turbo?"" It's cool cuz it's like a car
    with turbo. Vrrooom. Heh heh.</p><p>
    
    Ott: Jesus, Beta, you can't lace up a pair of ironic cowboy boots without stepping on a dollar copy of
    <i>Jailbreak</i> down here. What's the point of taking on the chop-attack of classic Rick Nielsen, or
    fuck, Leslie West of fatso hair-farmers Mountain, if you can't write a tune to go with it? The twin guitars
    are competent, but the songs fall on false posturing and buzz-bin words after the riffs bog down. Look at
    ""Denim and Diamonds Forever"" or better yet, ""Komputer Musik"", technophobically spelled with a ""k.""</p><p>
    
    Beta: Yeah, rock will never die. Bands will always <i>rule</i> over technology.</p><p>
    
    Ott: And when that won't work, the solos flip through the classic rock stations until they hit on a
    particular effect that works for the moment. The chunky riff that starts ""Makin' Magik"" veers toward
    Foghat's ""Slow Ride"" before getting lost in the piled-up riffage and aborted choruses, uncertain if they
    want to be all-chops or all-pop.</p><p>
    
    Beta: Dude, they're tight, like Tight Bro's From Way Back When.  Hear how they all hit the drum and main
    barre chord at the same time in the build-up to ""Bleed Blue""? And with the feedback, you could kinda tell
    where like Bon Scott would be saying like ""I'm going dooown..."" right there. I mean he's dead and stuff,
    but...</p><p>
    
    Ott: But while it throws off every indicator of ""rocking,"" replete with thrusting fists, horned hands, and
    high fives from <i>That 70s Show</i>, it just doesn't <i>rock</i>. It's like those Frank Marino, Budgie,
    and Moxy records that sell for $30 down here, but are worthless in any other part of the country. Licks
    and tight tricks abound, but it doesn't lock in.</p><p>
    
    Beta: I kinda like the Kentucky Fried Chicken picking they nail just right to open ""Bustin' Up Yo Complex""
    with them dudes hooting along at a kegger. It reminds me of those days of partying in Austin on a Saturday
    night. Empty promises but it feels all right for the doped-up moment. And their take on ""River Deep,
    Mountain High"" is totally Jim O'Rourke's boogie rock from <i>Insignificance</i>, but like doing Ike and
    Tina instead.</p><p>
    
    Ott: At least there's none of that crappy Drag City irony riddling the thing.  Maybe they just got rushed
    in the studio and didn't have any solid songs ready.</p><p>
    
    Beta: Yeah, they should just get high next time. It always helps with that writing stuff.</p></div>"|8029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8029-unite-tonight/|4.2|Andy Beta

    sordid details of his life and circumstance, more power to you.  To maintain this aura of blissful ignorance,
    I'd recommend keeping the liner notes to this collection tucked inside the front of the CD case-- that way,
    all you'll see when you open the case is Paul Leary's well-intentioned mashnote to Johnston's legacy.  ""I
    thought my band [the Butthole Surfers] was out there,"" Leary muses, ""but Daniel Johnston was way out there.""</p><p>
    However, inside the insert is a less simplistic essay by <i>Austin Chronicle</i> writer Louis Black,
    detailing his history with Daniel Johnston-- how he received this tape of remarkable songs from a gawky
    24-year-old in 1985, how musicians and media outlets both locally and nationally took notice of this kid
    that saw the Beatles as inspiration and equals, how Johnston was ""a pain in the ass... manipulative and
    naïve."" Black writes about the time he drove down to the University of Texas campus to find Daniel standing
    in the middle of a creek.  ""His eyes had gone mad white,"" Black notes.  ""He was singing, he was testifying,
    he was demanding our baptism...  He talked of God and the devil.  Of being lost and being saved.""  And of
    course, the notion of the inexorable link between ""genius"" and ""madness"" is brought up.</p><p>
    After sharing all this with the reader, Black then tries to backtrack, writing, ""Okay, erase every word
    above,"" much in the same way a trial attorney would withdraw an objectionable comment knowing full well
    that those words will stick in the mind of the jurors.  It's hard to look past Johnston's story when
    listening to any of this music.  When he offers a lyric from ""A Little Story"" (""And they beat him/ And
    they robbed him/ And they hung him for being good/ And they laughed and make jokes/ While they stood in
    his blood"") and punctuates the line with a loud piano chord and five seconds of silence, it's a chilling
    moment.</p><p>
    It also goes a long way in souring the happy-go-lucky air of other pro-Christian polemics like
    ""Wicked World"" and ""Premarital Sex"".  And then there's something like ""Hate Song"", where Johnston offers
    yet another jaunty barrel-rolling tune on his piano.  And he's singing about a girl that's waiting for a
    call (from him) that won't come, painting the picture with unapologetic strokes like, ""The clock will tick
    and it will make you sick/ As every moment of your life passes by/ You'll contemplate suicide with a knife
    one night/ It won't be nice.""</p><p>
    Perhaps the one track that epitomizes what a Song of Pain can be is ""My Baby Cares for the Dead"": just
    Daniel and some microphone buzz, singing about a girl he loves that spurned him for an undertaker-- in
    fact, according to Black's notes, most of the songs in this collection are about that girl.  It's awful
    enough that Johnston sings about the birth of a baby being the death of their love, but when he goes
    further to say, without hesitation, ""I know someday my baby/ Will care for meee-eeee,"" and goes into detail
    about being embalmed and buried in a coffin while intoning that line again and again in his detached and
    damning sing-songy fashion, it's hard to not wince or cringe.  It would be too easy to credit Johnston's
    supposed lack of guile for infecting this song with such a sense of overbearing dread, since it's safe to
    say there are numerous songwriters continually striving for the high level of conversational verisimilitude
    Johnston casually exhibits throughout most of these songs.</p><p>
    Of course, such matter-of-fact plainspeak is more appreciable in the lighter songs.  Witness ""I Save
    Cigarette Butts"", which begins with a great line (""I save cigarette butts for a poor girl across town"")
    and then details the story of Daniel losing his girl to a guy that took her to a wrestling match while
    Johnston's Rocket 88 barrels through.  After distracting the listener with mentions of Frankenstein and a
    dream where angels spill beer on Jesus, it turns out that the ""wrestling match"" isn't exactly Greco-Roman.
    There's another moment in the rollicking ""More Dead Than Alive"" where Daniel talks to a ""psychological man""
    about ""this problem about this coffin"" and ends up getting prescribed cough drops.  Says Daniel, ""I said,
    'Please don't make such dumb jokes.'""  Better yet is ""Wicked Will"", a pithy tale about the title character
    and Easy Sue that takes a cue from The Kinks' ""Lola"".  And better than <i>that</i> is ""Never Relaxed"",
    where Johnston takes a Job-like boy with perpetual nervousness through puberty and death.  In these
    moments, it's easier to forget the baggage and simply appreciate the music.</p><p>
    After all, that's what Louis Black wants when he asks us to push aside the stories and tragedy and sadness
    of Johnston's life.  He wants listeners to appreciate Daniel's candor and emotion, his way with a melody,
    his awkward, nasal voice, his haphazard, yet spirited, musicianship.  He wants us to treat this supposed
    ""outsider"" music as we would our favorite songs.  Like I said, it's nearly impossible to admire Daniel
    Johnston the Songwriter without thinking about Daniel Johnston the Person, and I'm not sure that it's the
    best thing to do.  Even with such knowledge, it's not hard to see what fans admire in his music. However,
    I did manage to have one of those moments while listening to this collection, and for that brief moment
    all the genius rhetoric blithely tossed about by folks like Kurt Cobain and David Bowie made all the sense
    in the world.  Make of that what you will.</p></div>"|4280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4280-songs-of-pain-the-early-recordings-vol-1/|8.0|David Raposa

    (with Markus Popp of Oval). If you're a hardcore fan, you might even know him as one-half of Dü (with FX
    Randomiz), or through his production work (he paired with Toma to produce tracks on Stereolab's <i>Dots and
    Loops</i>, and also Kraftwerk drummer Wolfgang Flur's solo album as Yamo), or maybe one of his many cameos
    (Pluramon, just for starters). Sometimes, though, a guy wants to be alone. On top of all these projects,
    St. Werner records solo as Lithops.</p><p>
    It's been approximately five years since we've seen a full album of Lithops material. <i>Uni Umit</i> was
    issued in North America on Jim O'Rourke's Moikai label in 1999, but was a collection of tracks recorded
    during the previous few years (and itself was originally issued on Sonig in 1998). In 1998, Lithops also
    debuted with the hard-to-find <i>Didot</i>, which was vinyl-only aside from an expensive CD release in
    Japan. Outside a trickle of Lithops singles and an occasional compilation track, Lithops seemed dead in
    the water. Now comes the 2003 release of <i>Scrypt</i>.</p><p>
    Every Lithops release has something to recommend, but St. Werner never quite delivers on the promise of his
    various collaborations; as a Mouse on Mars and Microstoria freak, I always expect to like Lithops just a bit
    more than I actually do. <i>Didot</i> was raw, choppy, and rhythmically complex, but had a tendency to stray
    too far into noise that seemed to have little purpose. <i>Uni Umit</i> was better, definitely more refined
    and structured, even if some tracks seemed like half-hearted Mouse on Mars.</p><p>
<i>Scrypt</i> is more sophisticated than either, and also has a very different feel. This is definitely the
    most abstract Lithops record, with a number of tracks that seem inspired by the dense assault Oval presented
    on <i>Commers</i>. There's very little of the bouncy playfulness for which St. Werner usually makes room.
    You might even call ""distortion"" the record's lead instrument. Fortunately, St. Werner plays the hell out
    of the various shades of noise.</p><p>
    The first track on <i>Scrypt</i> is called ""Generator"" and it basically picks up from the loudest, most
    obnoxious point on <i>Idiology</i>, leaves the drums and vocals behind, and adds some random explosions.
    ""Self-Stencil"", on the other hand, is a dissection of the subtleties of redzone harmonics, showing St.
    Werner's brilliant feel for distortion's luminous edge. He keeps the sheet of feedback in check just enough
    for the track to qualify as ambient, so that a sloppy mess of sound coalesces into shimmering, immaculate
    sculpture.  ""Thrash Application"" bends and stretches the attack of a jagged metal riff, which occasionally
    breaks loose and pounds away on its own.</p><p>
    The other significant development on <i>Scrypt</i> is that St. Werner collaborates with other musicians, a
    Lithops first.  Most interesting are the addition of Sam More's woodwinds.  More's work on ""T O"" and
    ""Insections"" forms an odd complement to the computer-generated sound, as the electronics are pulled toward
    the acoustic and vice-versa. The reeds add a layer of drama and pathos, particularly on the neo-classical
    ""Insections"", giving focus to the boundless texture. Pete Meinwald contributes horns to two tracks, but
    his instrument is more difficult to place, becoming another element for St. Werner to manipulate.
    ""Playthrough"" is the latest wrinkle in St. Werner's long fascination with off-kilter, broken down funk,
    and it gets its pulse in part from drummer Jeffrey Bouck.</p><p>
    This is the first Lithops full-length to feel truly like a considered album, yet conversely it's also the
    most challenging listen. Perhaps in collaboration St. Werner is forced to triangulate and find more
    accessible solutions to sound problems. <i>Scrypt</i> is St. Werner uncut, experimenting on the edge of
    his own imagination. Something interesting bubbles up more often than not.</p></div>"|4814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4814-scrypt/|7.6|Mark Richardson

So far, I'm
    picturing a hyperactive five-armed robot playing a toy drumkit, loaded up with unnecessary lights running
    up his arms and chest.  Dosh, best known until now as Andrew ""Fog"" Broder's drummer, has made a record that's
    exhilaratingly dense, mixing live drums with beats and synths to show off both the precise production-- and
    the dismal attention span-- that leapfrogs through the album.</p><p>
    
    Take ""India India"": the melody unfurls with a steady, sun-stroked ease, like a travelogue theme song, but
    underneath, the electronic percussion sparks and pulses impatiently, too wired to take in the sights.  Or
    ""If I Could Sing"", which is soaked with gin and dust so as to echo a historical jazz club recording: Dosh
    stumbles over himself hitting the drums, yet he doesn't obstruct the piano from playing its simple, wistful
    melody.  He consistently tempers these conflicts in the careful mix and nervously balanced arrangements.</p><p>
    
    Given that Dosh is a drummer, it's no surprise that the beats and percussion lead most of the tracks.  But
    even if he hadn't included synths and keyboards, he varies the arrangement with a toychest of instruments,
    and all this gear gives him a giddy pre-school edge.  You've got the regular drumkit and live electronic
    percussion, with drumstrikes that have analog fuzziness but can cut off with digital precision.  The beats
    flurry past and then drop out the second he's done with them; and they range from pyrotechnic thwacks to
    the nursery school sounds of a tiny xylophone or twinkling toy percussion sets, real or synthesized.</p><p>
    
    By contrast, the compositions are all of a piece: they're upbeat and charming, with playful, almost
    sentimental melodies mostly rendered on synth (but check the piano-led ""If I Could Sing"" for the most
    sweetly nostalgic and hummable tune).  Two-thirds of the way through you sense the repetition, and some
    tracks like ""Song for Zelbert Moore"" almost have a void at their center.  The drawn-out organ chords and
    disrupted female vocals on ""Forgot Myself"" close the record with some drama, but end-to-end the tone should
    be more varied.</p><p>
    
    From all the distraction and noise on the record, you could get the idea that most of the pleasure of
    listening to it lies in the sheer stimulation-- that there's a lot of fascinating activity with nothing to
    support it.  But the album's excitement actually comes from the tension between its surface and structure.
    Each track sounds careful but chaotic, simple but extreme, as Dosh shines the spotlight on himself and

    parameters of their defined sound, never to make a puerile attempt at the pretensions of experimentation.
    Bands circumstantially branded with the Emo tag most often fall under this strict genre border patrol--
    scan our own archives for vicious cock-punches at The Promise Ring and Milemarker when they discovered
    keyboards and overdubbing.</p><p>
    
    Yet somehow The Appleseed Cast, hailing from the much-mocked burg of Lawrence, Kansas, avoided a thorough
    Pitchfork-skewering when they released the sprawling, hyper-ambitious <i>Low Level Owl</i> duology two years
    ago.  With islands of melancholy guitar-spiral songs breaking up an ocean of backward loops and intro-to-ambient
    instrumentals, <i>Low Level Owl</i> managed to be an occasionally fruitful evolution of emo's noodly side,
    too long by double, but digestible one disc at a time.  Still, naysayers sought to whip them back into place,
    criticizing a presumed case of the old Radioheaditis sweeping across the world's wannabe Roger Waterses.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, it appears The Appleseed Cast couldn't help but take that admonishment to heart, as <i>Two
    Conversations</i> presents a band cowed and reticent, regressing to shorter songs and swearing off interlude
    addiction.  Rather than merely dieting off the excesses and repetitions of <i>Low Level Owl</i> to a more
    manageable size, <i>Two Conversations</i> is a full retreat to homebase, where Mike Kinsella's American
    Football project looms large in influence and lyrics follow a safe diary-page path.</p><p>
    
    Even stripped largely of album-length concept (the group can't resist a couple lyric reprisals), the songs
    struggle to stand alone, bleeding over into each other in a way that's hypnotic at best, and soporific at
    worst.  Slow-paced engravings of entwined guitars and atmospheric keys bookend the album, but ""Hello
    Dearest Love"" and ""A Dream for Us"" don't so much patiently unfold as crawl into place.  Toybox reminders
    of the <i>Low Level Owl</i> sessions pop up here and there, but glockenspiels and synth strings can't hide
    the flimsiness of the material revealed on skeletal tracks like ""The Page"".</p><p>?
    
    The problem seems to be one of dynamics: whereas <i>Low Level Owl</i> constructed a curious alternation of
    pop/not-pop, <i>Two Conversations</i> can't get by simply on the contrast between slow/quiet and
    slightly-faster/loud.  The more effusive tracks, like ""Ice Heavy Branches"" and ""Innocent Vigilant Ordinary"",
    are welcome respites from somnambulant surroundings, and they pivot well on the sporadically inventive
    drumming of Josh Baruth, but impassioned line readings like ""we can all be naked now, and innocent"" can't
    help but make the group sound like it's trapped on Polyvinyl Records circa 1996.</p><p>
    
    Which, not coincidentally, is the space-time location of American Football, a shadow The Appleseed Cast just
    can't seem to get out from under-- unless you count ""The Sinking"", which may well have been written right
    after the band attended a Pedro the Lion show.  It's disheartening to see a band that was just starting to
    show promising signs of independent development trip back into the endless spiral of easy ""sounds-like""
    comparisons, but that's the sad outcome when a group listens too seriously to us tuneless jackasses
    spinning laptop censure from our couches.  Ignore all those other critics, guys, and just listen to me:
    an ambitious failure is better than a boring water-tread any day of the week.</p></div>"|259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/259-two-conversations/|4.2|Rob Mitchum

    them-- this time, their muse is the grandiose abstraction, and <i>Song in the Air</i>, the band's third
    full-length since forming in Louisville in 1995, is packed full of half-truths and fuzzy sensations.
    Here, frontman Chris Higdon spouts mouthfuls of brow-furrowing lyrics (""Sold your broken wings for land
    and water/ Across the air and over waves/ You are the world/ You are the world repeating"") over vague,
    omnipresent guitar washes and bulging strings, constantly building things and tugging them apart, keeping
    shit stubbornly inconclusive. Indefiniteness is its own kind of answer, and Elliott seem to have just now
    arrived at the proper end of their math equation.</p><p>
    Higdon is the only founding member of the band who has stuck around since the beginning, and each of Elliott's
    subsequent lineup changes might be partially accountable for their patchy discography, which ranges,
    inexplicably, from gratingly aggressive emo (1998's <i>U.S. Songs</i>) to dark, Cure-heavy noodling (2000's
    glossy <i>False Cathedrals</i>.)  <i>Song in the Air</i> is Elliott's first record with new members Benny
    Clark on lead guitar and Jason Skaggs on bass, and it's considerably more celestial and defined than anything
    Higdon has spearheaded before: distorted guitar waves, wads of e-bow, violins, viola, splashes of piano,
    and thick, resonant percussion lead <i>Song</i> through lots of atmospheric swells and recesses.  It's
    perfectly possible that Higdon's just now gotten around to unwrapping those Sigur Rós records he got for
    his birthday, or that Elliott's finally settled on a dominant aesthetic to accompany its new, steady
    lineup, but either way <i>Song in the Air</i> is a far more dynamic and internally cohesive record than
    any of the band's previous efforts.</p><p>
    Higdon's voice is always intensely engaging, even when it's been pushed back in the mix and coated with a
    layer of shimmering guitar: high, soaring, and perpetually unresolved, his coos are both human and oddly
    ethereal, possessed but hollow, sweet and sinister all at once. These sorts of weird, intimate contradictions
    are always captivating-- both on and off-record-- and Higdon's floaty howls, which seem capable of bending
    from comforting to wholly terrifying within a single note, lend Elliott's songs a kind of tingly intrigue.</p><p>
    Which is good, because the record's instrumentation is sorta old news by now: Elliott have taken some pretty
    obvious cues from post-post-rock bands like Elbow (and even hometown heroes and genre-definers Slint), and
    their heady stew is not exactly groundbreaking.  Still, there are some effective moments: ""Drag Like Pull"",
    one of <i>Song</i>'s two instrumental cuts, sees some jarring guitar detonations and eye-opening crashes;
    opener ""Land and Water"" has a big, echoing guitar riff that, despite waning quickly, can be sort of
    monumental in the right context.</p><p>
    A recent note on the band's website seems to suggest, albeit obliquely, that this might be Elliott's swan
    song (""To be true to what the band and its members have stood by.it's time for Elliott to come to an end"")
    and <i>Song in the Air</i> seems like an awfully appropriate conclusion to a career based, seemingly, on a
    desperate search for self-definition.</p></div>"|2753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2753-song-in-the-air/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

    I've been at it, and I can't think of a reasonable way to review this ""power electronics"" stuff-- few
    artists divide music fans like Whitehouse, Maurizio Bianchi, and Kevin Drumm.  So I'm in a predicament,
    then.  If I write that I think a few of the microtones on Kevin Drumm's new album unintentionally support
    superfluous pitches that merely slow down the piece's progress, most people would probably either note
    that the album ""sounds like a dishwasher"" or, for the kids that dig it, ""sounds like some alien, fuckin'
    PCP on crack, vitriolic, madcap lunacy minimalism-metal.""  And both of those are valid arguments. There's
    really not a lot of room for specific criticisms in this sort of music.  I'll do my best.</p><p>
    
    If last year's <i>Sheer Hellish Miasma</i> was an entrance into finality, a pummeling to death, the gateway
    to the burdened grave, <i>Land of Lurches</i> is traveling music. <i>Sheer Hellish Miasma</i> was the
    Bergman film; this is the road-trip one.  The first piece begins with some ominous jackhammer, the
    inevitable foundation of all verifiable noise, but then expands to the very atmospheric conditions of the
    record. Those reverberations aren't from some loud machinery, but the very texture of the air. Some clear,
    almost serene, tones emerge under it, cutting through the mechanistic terra firma, and ascending beyond it.</p><p>
    
    While Kevin Drumm typically plunders straight to the earth's core, this is more astral stuff. The antecedents
    aren't Norwegian death and/or improvisation, but classical composition. It's one of those epic incursions
    into otherness, reminiscent of Ligeti or Stockhausen. The whole time I was thinking of Ligeti's ""Lux Aeterna"",
    which, in Kubrick's <i>2001</i>, soundtracks the arrival of the monolith. This may be a ""land of lurches,""
    but it's inevitably progressing towards something; it's the echoing of the creaks of the shuttle, the
    apprehension of knowing we're going to unknown zones at an awe-inspiring velocity.</p><p>
    
    The track's second ""movement"" apparently takes place after the initial dread of the launch. It sounds like
    clown laughs if clowns had gear changes on a manual transmission. It's threatening, but also vastly lighter
    (frolicsome, nearly) than anything on <i>Sheer Hellish Miasma</i>. In the final movement, the initial
    jackhammer returns, as well as the clear tones, noise with a refrain, with composition and balance.</p><p>
    
    The second piece is comedic. It's got a hell of a 4/4 beat, some circus music, a sort of chorus, and
    distorted static squeals, and it ends with the saturnine stomp and brassy trunks of elephants. And then
    comes the final track on this 30-minute LP, the most musique concrete of the bunch.  It's a quieter affair--
    airplane engines and the like-- but it turns, rather unexpectedly, into the best Martin Denny song never
    written, the Jungle Cruise intersplicefoliatecrossed with those spectral haunted forests from fairy tales.
    Rabid parrots are going off all over the place and the concentrated sap of the maple trees is TINGED WITH
    BLOOD.  I'm ambivalent towards the end, though.  I thought it was overly sentimental when I considered it
    as four minutes of rain, and I thought it was revolutionary when I considered it as four minutes of static.
    To quote the back of an LP sleeve popular in Greenwich Village, ""the choice, dear listener, is up to you.""</p><p>
    
    There wasn't really any reason to read this review. (I should have told you earlier, I know, but it's too
    late for such qualms now.) You people are smart, enterprising arbiters of taste and you could probably tell
    straight away if you'd like or hate this after you got to the ""dishwasher"" and ""minimalism-metal"" lines.
    All I can guarantee is that this will further ruin your hearing, expand your options, and generally disrupt
    the populace.</p></div>"|2466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2466-land-of-lurches/|8.2|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    moves, a coed troupe of new-wavers droned about aliens over pre-programmed beats.  About halfway through
    the charade, a friend turned to me and said they reminded him of N*Sync. ""Maybe, but not as sincere,"" I
    replied.  <i>All Your Faded Things</i> shares topical aesthetic similarities to this Brooklyn nightmare,
    but Anna Oxygen escapes all that empty, pop-art falsity.  She's also got a knack for solid songwriting,
    infusing her lyrics with thrift-store-romantic touches and constructing emotionally resonant quote/unquote
    electroclash.</p><p>
    
    Though surviving mainly on a diet of low-impact, easily consumed paint-by-number moves, Oxygen has a great
    voice and an eccentric sense of melody, picking odd syllabic pairings and juxtapositions, gruffly sweet
    intonations, and complex vocal patterning. Placing her operatic gestures atop pom-pom drum machine blips
    and busy keytar, her timbre is topically similar to Wynne Greenwood of Tracy + The Plastics, but she
    indulges in fewer Galas octave sweeps; instead, like Siouxsie raised on Freddy Mercury, she ooh's and ahh's
    finely layered Queen-styled vocal choruses intermixed with a few creepy Nina Hagen chirps. (Showing range,
    her contributions to The Microphones are more Mirah-subdued.)</p><p>
    
    This sounds okay, but then, alas, enter the gimmicks. Much like Greenwood or Miranda July, Oxygen twists
    her work around an interactive live show including thrift-store DIY theater and visual projections.
    Content-wise, she says the majority of her songs are about a story involving a space scientist who captures
    girls' universes and puts them in petri dishes where he can listen to them and vicariously experience their
    lives: ""Each new imaginary girl-world I came up with became a motivation for me to make up a new soundtrack
    to go along with it.""</p><p>
    
    This is fairly similar to Greenwood's reason for creating Tracy + The Plastics in 1999: ""It started as the
    soundtrack/characters of this choose-yr-own-adventure-murder-mystery movie I was writing about these girls
    who called themselves The Plastics and ran a pawn shop in this dreary little town at the foot of these
    mountains. They replaced parts of themselves with hypercolorful pieces of plastic that fell from the towns
    on top of the mountains, above the cloud cover."" Recycled tropes and pop music go hand-in-hand, but when
    similarly paced Pacific Northwest one-woman bands offer a common framework, the incestuousness of this
    sort of music is lamely apparent. (Oxygen has a brief tune, ""Primary Colors"", which reenacts the
    transformation from black-and-white to color that Greenwood describes in her band's cosmology.)</p><p>
    
    Oxygen's work would be more substantial sans the clap-along aerobics and art-school posturing, especially
    since the strongest tracks on <i>All Your Faded Things</i> hinge on actual hooks-- a rarity in a genre
    often considered to be more consumed by its fashion than its songs.  The heartbreaker, ""Red Horse Cafe"",
    offers one of the better backwards glances of this past year, and by dramatically situating the protagonists
    in the cafe of the song's title to work on a reconciliation, it moves into Johnny Cash Tallyho Tavern
    territory. Pumped with the storytelling of The Human League or Pulp (think ""Disco 2000""), the chorus is
    smoke-addled, faded scoop-neck sweater, rusted safety-pin pretty.  Doubling the vocal tracks, Oxygen
    heightens and extends her voice, as if resolutely stepping forward for a last dance with arm extended:
    ""I like you so much, I don't want to lose you/ I think I could kiss you but I don't want to hurt you.""
    Like the best punk, the line mixes desire, a threat, and something to make you want to pogo.</p><p>
    
    A few other tracks-- the one-plus-one School House Rock of ""Spectacle"", the New Order loveliness of ""Baby
    Blue"", and the spooky choral darkness of ""Nerve Angels Three"" and ""Aviva""-- offer equally solid, if
    transitory moments.  But while Oxygen certainly has a knack for re-inscribing 80s drama into the fabric
    of 2003, even her best pop is marred by second-rate instrumentation-- lackluster drum tracks, bland keytar
    lines, and the like.  Without taking things further than a flimsy electro zeitgeist, her potentially
    successful project becomes regrettably tedious.</p></div>"|6081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6081-all-your-faded-things/|6.2|Brandon Stosuy

So when
    confronted with the latest of the anti-folk bumper crop, post-Moldy Peaches, by the lackluster Jeffrey Lewis,
    I found myself with very little to say, and many blank pages for discussing an album sold to me with the
    snake oil descriptor that it was ""[Roky] Erickson himself chain-sawing apart Lou Reed's
<i>
 Transformer
</i>
"".
    (Looks like I'll never trust
<i>

again.) For that simple reason, I decided to revert to Lewis'
    other artistic medium, that of a comic book artist, and critique his album in a form he might be more
    comfortable with-- with certain songs from his second album on Rough Trade given an impressionistic
    rendering. Many thanks to Cole Johnson of Sleepover Comics for providing the ink.</p><p>

    a thousand years. When you combine his frantic drone riffing with whatever
    processing he places in the signal path, the distinctive tone that emerges
    stretches back before Hendrix, before Les Paul, before electricity-- back
    to a time when people worshipped the sun and lived according to the rhythms
    of the earth. I hear baroque organs, clanging percussion and primitive
    stringed instruments churning inside his tone. To listen to Makoto's guitar
    is to understand psychedelic music's ultimate goal of timelessness.</p><p>
    Makoto formed Tsurubami in 1994 with bassist Higashi Hiroshi (who would
    later join him in Acid Mothers Temple) and drummer Emi Nobuko, who were
    fellow members of his in the pre-Acid Mothers band Tenkyo No To. Recently,
    the trio reunited to record as a band again-- and now, following a string
    of CD-R releases, comes <i>Gekkyukekkaichi</i>, their highest profile album
    to date.</p><p>
    Though billed as a partnership of equals, there's no questioning that Tsurubami
    Makoto's show.  On these two very long tracks, his massive guitar sound swells
    to fill all available space. Hiroshi's bass is essentially inaudible, and Nobuko's
    drumming provides minimal tone color, rising and falling according to the
    dictates of Makoto's guitar flights. <i>Gekkyukekkaichi</i> is a drone record
    completely; each track hinges on variations in space, volume and timbre,
    with little melody or rhythm.  During the long passages of balls-out energy
    riffing (which can easily last five or more minutes), it's easy to forget that
    you're even listening to a guitar/bass/drums trio at all-- the music quickly
    takes on the character of unnamable abstract noise.</p><p>
    ""Gekkyukekkaichi"", the first of the record's two tracks, runs about 24 minutes,
    and has the structure and predictability of an erupting volcano: A calm and
    lyrical introduction by Makoto, dense with his characteristic sense of
    harmony, is the calm wisp of smoke snaking upward from the mountaintop.
    Makoto's guitar soon settles into a throbbing drone, but around the 10-minute
    mark, the track explodes with wall-to-wall guitar texture that occasionally
    breaks back down into moments of tranquility.</p><p>
    ""Seiitenrinengi"" (which, at 37 minutes, makes ""Gekkyukekkaichi"" seem like a
    pop single) follows a similar structure, interspersing extended passages of
    subtle spaciousness with heavy metal-on-metal guitar abuse.  Here, Nobuko's
    drums become an extension of the otherworldly guitar, with exploding cymbals
    and chaotic fills mirroring Makoto's movements.  Makoto's instrument emits a
    wide spectrum of color throughout the entire record, but at the length of
    ""Seiitenrinengi"" I can feel the absence of the variety that Acid Mothers
    brings. Some of these breakdowns would sound better with the addition of
    other instruments.</p><p>
    Both of <i>Gekkyukekkaichi</i>'s tracks are completely improvised, and you
    get the very real sensation while listening that the band is embarking on an
    epic journey that we're free to join. Despite the extreme length and constraints
    of the three-piece setup, these tracks rarely get boring. It can be difficult
    to make room in life for heroic \xBE hour guitar excursions, but when you get
    the time, Kawabata Makoto is your man.</p></div>"|8232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8232-gekkyukekkaichi/|7.1|Mark Richardson

    newcomers the Drive-By Truckers have the unenviable task of following up one of the more ambitious records
    of the (very) early 21st century with a critical spotlight shining directly into their eyes.  Despite the
    pressure, they've managed to avoid repeating themselves-- or worse, buying into the hype that made them a
    flagship band of the newly re-energized southern rock scene.  <i>Decoration Day</i> is possessed by an
    entirely different kind of energy: one that appears to be the result of a complete emotional U-turn.</p><p>
    
    Lead Trucker Patterson Hood and cohorts (guitarists/vocalists Mike Cooley and Jason Isbell, bassist Earl
    Hicks and drummer Brad Morgan) are still channeling that old Van Zandt spirit to come to grips with their
    ""Southern-ness,"" but where <em>Southern Rock Opera</em> focused its attention on big Men-- capital-M Men like
    longtime Alabama governor George Wallace, whose iconic personas have strongly informed the Southern culture
    for the better part of the last quarter-century-- <em>Decoration Day</em> casts a much smaller net, grappling
    with more personal struggles.</p><p>
    
    The title and cover art, which depicts a decorated grave, give a hint of insight into the album's somber,
    mood-- several of its tracks draw sketches of down-on-luck Southerners facing some of life's biggest
    decisions and deepest losses.  Opener ""The Deeper In"", the story of two siblings serving time for their
    incestuous relationship, is remarkably sparse, with Hood leading the song in a cappella before being joined
    by skeletal guitars and Brad Morgan's slow, martial drums. The thunderous ""Sink Hole"", loosely based on
    filmmaker Ray McKinnon's short film <em>The Accountant</em> (a 2002 Oscar winner), finds the narrator wishing
    death on the unctuous banker foreclosing on his struggling family farm.</p><p>
    
    Even the songs that a New England-raised, East Coast liberal-college-attending snark (er, not me, really)
    might find ""rednecky"" are propped up by the unwavering dignity of their narrators. Sure, new guitarist
    Jason Isbell's contribution, ""Outfit"", has its more than its share of bastard children, blue-collar
    housepainters and cars pawned for wedding rings, but there's also fatherly advice like, ""Don't worry about
    losin' your accent/ Southern men tell better jokes,"" and, ""Call home on your sister's birthday.""</p><p>
    
    But it's not until we reach the two full-fledged epics-- Hood's nearly seven-minute ""Your Daddy Hates Me"" and
    the Isbell-penned title track-- which lead the charge on the album's second half that the Truckers' vision for
    the album fully crystallizes.  The former follows a hard-drinking, self-loathing narrator (""I'd probably hate
    me, too"") as he finds redemption in his faithfulness to women, backed by a slow-cooking dirge that mimics the
    beating he's taken in his lifetime.  The roiling title track, meanwhile, recounts a son's relationship with
    his dead father, both of whom were involved in a generation-spanning blood feud.  The confusion surrounding
    the origin of the decades-old battle boils over in a roaring coda that easily stands as the album's emotional
    core.  Which is when it becomes clear: this album is about pride-- regional and personal-- and honor.</p><p>
    
    Some may insist that <i>Decoration Day</i>'s cohesiveness suffers from Hood, Cooley and Isbell continually
    trading off lead vocals, but I find it adds an essential component of plausibility.  That each of the
    record's protagonists is given his own unique voice only lends conviction to this record's examination
    of life in the South-- one of the best since, well, <em>Southern Rock Opera</em>, actually.  And while its
    peaks fall just a whit short of those on its predecessor, <em>Decoration Day</em>'s inward journeys nicely
    balance out <i>Southern Rock Opera</i>'s bombastic expansiveness, and further confirm the Drive-By Truckers'
    status as the most poetic and insightful Southern rockers in existence today.</p></div>"|2508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2508-decoration-day/|8.0|Stephen Haag

    Patron Saint of Objectivity prays I first make a confession: I don't generally get along with concept
    albums.  My first reaction is typically one of disappointment filtered through indignity: <i>Hey, don't tell
    me what to make of your music.  F.Y.I., I happen to enjoy the tabula rasa privilege of formulating my own
    basis for analysis and drawing up my own, personal associations for your music.  I want to be the judge of
    this, and I certainly don't want you to be the judge of how it is I should render my judgment.</i> Then I
    grow up.  Some.</p><p>
<i>The Marionette and the Music Box</i> is, yes, a concept album about a damned marionette and a music box.
    How do I know this?  Because I was cold-cocked in the face with it.  Unwed Sailor created the album as a
    companion piece to Jamie Hunt's 17-plate illustrated children's book which spins the tale of our two
    protagonists and is included in the liner notes.  The song titles double as captions to the plates, and
    feature such narrative-driven handles as ""Meeting of the Marionette and the Music Box"", ""The Separation. A
    Hopeless Pursuit"", and ""The Return to Open Arms"".  You get the picture: all 17 of them.  Which, truth be
    told, are a small accomplishment on their own right.</p><p>
    
    The music itself is a truncated version of previous Unwed Sailor material, which in turn was a truncated
    version of bassist Jonathan Ford's Roadside Monument material.  Whereas earlier Unwed Sailor releases were
    dynamic, weaving mathy elements of guitar, bass, and drums into the sort of instrumental rock that's correctly
    served without lyrical accompaniment, <i>The Marionette</i>'s formula isn't as replete.  The band chose to
    forgo, for the first sixteen tracks, actual drumming in lieu of subtler, more softly textured percussion.
    Delicate guitar interplay, by turns warily ambitious and content in tone, is augmented by creaking doors,
    rhythmic tapping, sparse bells, organs, and chirping birds. The entire album, lacking a skeletal grounding,
    is light and wistful, and though it never soars it likewise never sinks.</p><p>
    
    None of the songs, save for the return-to-form closer ""Jubilee"", boldly stand out either in construction or
    accomplishment.  It has its moments, but, as a testament to its cohesiveness, could veritably have been
    divided into one or two tracks-- and I get the feeling Jonathan and company might take umbrage to the idea
    of using any one cut for the purposes of, say, a mixtape.  Singling out the gentle acoustics and perfect
    timbre of ""At Peace in the Forest"" is tantamount to removing your favorite minute from any Godspeed song.
    I suppose the heart of my concern is this: what the band could once construct emotionally in one song is
    spread thin over the coarse of 38 minutes, and inextricably reliant on the extra-musical elements for
    succeeding in its aims-- aims that, need I remind you, I did not dictate or unjustifiably fabricate.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, I see the album as a moving away from one strength in favor of developing another. The stark,
    minimalist guitar work and overall atmosphere is simply a delight as background fare. While Unwed Sailor
    probably felt as if they were doing just the opposite, they chose to find a cure for a benign affliction,
    and in doing so temporarily abandoned the qualified (yet equally promising) success of earlier aspirations.
    Those of you reading this review in the distant future can feel free to subtract a few points from the
    rating for careless meddling if this turns out to have just been a pit stop, but if Unwed Sailor can break
    free from the fetters of accountability and move forward, all sins are forgiven.  And that's where honesty
    will get you.</p></div>"|8377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8377-the-marionette-and-the-music-box/|6.1|Bill Morris

For every Jim
    Morrison and prog-rock band, bound on one side by megalomania and on the other by ineptitude, there's a
    flagrantly idiotic band like The Stooges or The Sex Pistols, more concerned with having a guitarist who
    uses his instrument as a rowdy projectile than with having liner notes based on a Mabuse triptych and
    <i>Das Kapital</i>. Pussy Galore were a good band not because they were satirical, but because none of
    them knew how to play their instruments. And that is hilarious. Not many people can relate to the classical
    sublimity of guitarist Christopher Parkening, but everyone can relate to the thought that guitars sound
    crazy when you hit them on things.</p><p>
    That was my pre-<i>Secret Weapon Revealed at Last</i> philosophy. Now I'm starting to wonder: Is dumb,
    improvisational noise-rock an essential component of modern music, or is it merely the remarkably infantile
    and incomprehensible product of some kids who taught themselves make-believe chords between episodes of
    <i>Punk Planet USA</i>?</p><p>
    When this conflict hits the courts, let the noise-rockers pray that The Country Teasers have not been
    subpoenaed. The Scottish band had some quirky records back in the late 90s, the sort of music that easily
    offended patrons believe is cutely offensive, but difficultly offended ones find vapid and tiresome. While
    1999's <i>Destroy All Human Life</i> had a penury of memorable songs, it did at least have a Tammy Wynette
    cover and some vaguely political satire to obscure the ineffectiveness of the band. The new album offers no
    such reprieve.</p><p>
    The first song, ""Success"", like most of the album, belongs to the Dr. Demento school of disaster; these are
    either terrible songs or terrible parodies of terrible songs. This iteration may make interesting conceptual
    art, but it isn't very good music. (The song is so bad it made a Pitchfork reviewer invoke Dr. Demento.) It's
    a bedraggled, clumsy piece that tries to conglomerate noise, garage, and pop, and essentially fails at all
    of them. Sample lyric (if I heard correctly): ""Anna Kournikova was thirteen years old when she entered the
    world of sex/ I mean, success."" After interrogating that line for some time, it's unclear whether it's
    supposed to be entertaining. If so, is it intended to be entertaining on its own, or making fun of
    people/bands that think that line is entertaining?</p><p>
    If you're anything like me, you probably didn't finish reading the preceding paragraph because you didn't
    care anymore. It's true that their former albums were comic rejoinders to the sort of people that don't recognize them as humorous, but this album, when it's
    tolerable, simply did not amuse me. If I couldn't possibly fathom the uproarious comedy because it's making
    fun of people like me, well then, I guess I despise it even more. Some songs, like ""Harry Wine 2"", are at
    least familiar as poor façades of better rock. The guitar riffs are rarely sustainable for more than five
    seconds, though some do make it to eight. I'm fairly certain ""Todtill"" involves only one chord. This may
    sound like a clamorously ideal melding of Scottish country with Japanese noise, but it's delivered more
    like one-third of the chorus of a Rancid song. After I heard it for the first time, I thought to myself,
    ""Why isn't my stereo working?"" Then I realized I was so bored that I'd started to mentally efface my
    faculty for listening.</p><p>
    The most complimentary sentiment I can muster is that this album has horrific production. Even then, however,
    many albums have worse. I realize this was a particularly ostentatious review, written by some haughty
    upstart who thinks he knows about music, but I honestly think I could make a better album than this, even
    though I currently suffer from poor eyesight, bronchitis, and a sizeable gash that precludes the use of my
    right hand.</p></div>"|1719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1719-secret-weapon-revealed-at-last/|3.1|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

Of all the various strains of would-be rock and roll music, truly it     is most often damned from the start: Badfinger knew it, The Raspberries knew     it, Curt Boettcher found out, XTC stood alone in the corner as Cheap Trick     went to the bank, The dB's broke up as The Rembrandts showed us just how to     pigeonhole an entire genre in ten days.</p><p>Why does this happen?  Is it because power-pop is ultimately an exercise of     men (and Aimee Mann) trying to be boys?  Is it because the world can only     handle so much falsetto?  Is it because the notion of compact, tightly     constructed pop songs performed by people with guitars doesn't make it past     the 10 a.m. meeting in a world expecting today's deliverables yesterday?</p><p>I've never figured out why rock bands playing in the mold of The Beatles,     Beach Boys and, well, Cole Porter haven't been more popular.  Aren't those     guys supposed to be the greatest ever?  Perhaps part of the problem is that     the general public can't really be bothered with the next generation when     they think they've already seen the best episodes.</p>
<p>In any case, California-sunned singer/songwriter (ouch, that label has to     be at least half the problem) Brendan Benson is pressing on.  His 2002     sophomore full-length, <em>Lapalco</em> was moderately well-received by your     fave online music hotspot, and judging by the company he keeps (Jason     Faulkner... um, Dan Castellaneta-- hey, don't diss his record until you've     heard it.  Okay, now you can diss it) you'd think he'd at least have some     kind of cult following.  His tunes should be right on time for fans of     Faulkner, Mann and 90s next-spilt-thing Jellyfish.</p>
<p><em>Metarie</em> is an EP (that for all intents and purposes is really an     extended single) featuring new versions of two songs from <em>Lapalco</em>,     one new tune and a cover of Paul McCartney's ""Let Me Roll It"". Like most     good power-pop, the band (a new one for Benson, featuring mainly members     of fellow nice guys The Atomic Numbers) sounds good and the background     vocals even better.  Consequently, Benson's leads are semi-exposed as     being a tad thin to carry his songs, which isn't unprecedented (Ben Folds,     please stand up) but is disappointing for anyone wanting a little more     power in their pop.</p>
<p>""Alternative to Love"" is almost straight <em>Friends</em> fare disguised in     <em>Rubber Soul</em>s.  ""Maybe I'm just damaged goods.../ Me, I'm just a     little lost lamb,"" are Benson's admissions, and that places him squarely     in the realm of cute li'l underdog.  Again, anyone paying even marginal     attention to power-pop over the years shouldn't be surprised, though playing     that same face through the otherwise faithful version of ""Let Me Roll It""     (one of McCartney's grittier Wings-era outings) drastically undersells its     charm.  <em>Metarie</em> is probably a stopgap release, and one that probably     shouldn't be given microscopic focus by fans.  Still, I keep rooting for     those damn underdogs, and it would be nice to see one show a little muscle     now and then.</p>

    this collection.  Sure, why not?  Saxophonist Susan Whitby did.  Following in the steps of pseudonymous punks
    like Rat Scabies and Iggy Pop, Whitby joined Poly Styrene's X-Ray Spex and transformed into Lora Logic.  And
    when she was ousted from the group just before the 1978 release of the band's classic debut <i>Germ-Free
    Adolescents</i>, she took full advantage of punk's promise and began making her own noises-- sounds that
    echoed the influx of influences that infected the British post-punk scene.  But where many of her
    contemporaries found their music continually celebrated in critical and fanatical circles 25 years after
    the fact, Logic's music was left to wallow in dusty records bins with only a few scattered admirers, like
    Marcus, willing to champion her contributions.  It would be nice to say that this new collection of Lora's
    music gives her work the fanfare it deserves.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, there are two critical problems with this compilation.  Marcus takes note of the first: after
    mentioning an ""overwhelming version"" of ""Wake Up"" from the EP of the same name, he reveals that this particular
    version isn't included here.  In fact, that entire EP (originally released by Virgin Records) is conspicuously
    absent.  Granted, this could be attributed to the inability of Virgin and Kill Rock Stars to come to an
    agreement regarding the rights to those tracks, which would be all fair and good, if disappointing.  But
    it doesn't help explain why six other tracks from recordings ably represented on these discs (four Essential
    Logic songs, and two of Lora's solo efforts) are also MIA.  In the interest of those of you fond of
    downloading or hitting the local record fair, here are the names and locations of those 10 missing tracks:</p><p>
<li> ""Wake Up"", ""Eagle Bird"", ""Quality Crayon Wax OK"", ""Bod's Message"" (from Essential Logic's <i>Wake Up</i> EP)<br/>

<li> ""Stop Halt"" (from Lora Logic's <i>Pedigree Charm</i> LP)<p>
    
    This brings to light <i>Fanfare in the Garden</i>'s second problem.  Instead of offering listeners a complete
    set of recordings from Logic's short-lived reign as one of post-punk's most notable atypical girls, Kill
    Rock Stars have given space to some of Lora's output following her heyday.  There are 12 of these tracks
    in all-- eight from two Internet-only EPs (issued in 1997 and 1998), and four unreleased from 1983, 1985
    and 1991.  As Marcus mentions in the liner notes, Lora Logic ""joined the world of Hare Krishna"" sometime
    in the early 1980s, and unfortunately, it shows.  The synth-laden music for ""Stay High"" twinkles and hovers
    like rank patchouli smoke in a new-wave head shop, while Lora softly whimpers, ""Time is kicking like a mule/
    Time doesn't care if you're a woman or a man/ Time will engage you on the surface/ You should be alarmed
    now; she has a plan.""</p><p>
    
    The lone track from 1985 (""Do You Believe in Christmas?"") has Lora and the Krishna
    Kids Choir lending their voices to a Band Aid knock-off.  In 1991, she copped moves from A Certain Ratio (the
    post-<i>good</i> A Certain Ratio, even) in penning a song about her former band.  By 1997, Lora sounds
    anesthetized, regardless of her accompaniment striking a trip-hop pose (""Under the Great City"") or balancing
    piano scales (""Marika"").  The next year finds Lora cutting sub-par tracks about the Internet and Barbie that
    are as bland and stiff as anything offered by a barely functional punk rock outfit.  All you need to know:
    ""On the Internet"" actually features the sound of a dialing modem.  And then there's the re-recording of
    ""Martian Man"", here renamed ""No More Fiction"".</p><p>
    
    ""No More Fiction"" is slow and steady, and unmistakably leaden.  The version recorded 16 years earlier flies
    free atop tribal drumming and Lora's fluttering saxophone.  Where Lora's voice in 1998 is clipped and hushed,
    1982 finds her gleefully trilling and cooing about these made-up superheroes.  All over Disc 1, Lora careens
    joyously between spastic screeching (""Aerosol Burns"", ""Collecting Dust"") and considered crooning (""Wonderful
    Offer"") as her bandmates splice together ska, disco, various world musics, and that good old fashioned DIY
    what-have-you.  Such an amalgam could be just another reiteration of the sound of many of Lora's musical
    peers (cf. Gang of Four, This Heat, The Slits) were it not for her indomitable presence.  It's her unfettered
    sax, and her unfettered voice, that make the recordings on this collection's first disc essential.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, this set attempts to smoothly connect the dots between those fantastic skronk-happy aerosol
    bur-oins and Non-Essential Enya, going so far as to sandwich the post-1982 work between tracks from her
    solo record and her collaboration with the Red Crayola.  Perhaps the compilers were hoping some goodness
    from the superlative tracks would rub off on the superfluous ones.  As presented, there's a lot left to be
    desired regarding the stuff stuck between ""Horrible Party"" (Disc 2, Track 3) and ""Stereo"" (Disc 2, Track 14),
    and then to follow the irreverent Red Crayola track (""Born in Flames"") with both the Hare Krishna Christmas
    song and the sacrilegious ""Essential Logic"" does no one any favors.</p><p>
    
    Were this collection culled to include
    only the work worth a damn, it would be 88 minutes long, which is just long enough to not fit on one CD.
    Given the exclusion of certain tracks from this double-disc set (as noted earlier), perhaps more editing
    would have been beneficial to limit this collection to one firm and fully-packed disc.  As is, the collection
    does a fine job telling the story of the former Susan Whitby, but it comes at the expense of her music.</p></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></p></div>"|2892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2892-fanfare-in-the-garden-an-essential-logic-collection/|6.4|David Raposa

Whisper in my ear and tell me you hate me.  Vikings invade the Mediterranean and don't
    leave.  Diarrhea takes over your life.  These are all titles from Scott Herren's latest EP, a relentless
    megamix of material that didn't make it into his latest album.  And no, I couldn't resist spouting them
    all up front.  Let's just move on.</p><p>
    
    Last time on Prefuse: The <i>One Word Extinguisher</i> LP documented a loss to be cherished.  The raw
    material was putrid and abrasive, but it was smoothed a thousand times over in the obsessive preening of
    the mourning process.  Prefuse tried to crush and explode himself, to revile and revel in and revise the
    emptiness.  Nothing seemed to work.  Then, somewhere near the last third of the album, it sank in: She
    was gone, even her impression was gone, and the beats were still dropping.  Music had healed itself again.</p><p>
<i>Extinguished: Outtakes</i> doesn't look back into that mess.  There's no secret suffering or swollen
    self-denial, just a truckload of DATs full of sick-ass beats.  The mix is verbal, hyped, rich, impatient,
    and constantly pushing forward.  With a lot of the music on Herren's Eastern Developments label, the hard
    part of my job is to find purchase on the smooth surface of a non-verbal document.  With Prefuse, and
    especially this EP, the music is so monstrously verbal that I'm worried it will review <i>me</i>.  Here
    are the trademark vocal scraps and battle rhymes, yes, but also an array of dirty samples and relentless
    sequences that barrel through your Broca's brain with big balls and no brakes.</p><p>
    
    There are literally dozens of fragments here, for the most part ranging in length between five and ninety
    seconds.  Each captures Herren's riddled attention long enough to get dropped in, flipped, then scrapped
    for the next.  It's a dizzying and crowded ride, not always pleasant, and not one that can be navigated
    actively.  What did you do during the Blackout of 2003?  Rush home, search for candles and batteries, call
    loved ones?  You should have set up a lawn chair in the middle of the Manhattan bridge and let the exodus
    wash over you with a daiquiri in one hand and a discman spinning Prefuse in the other.  This album is like
    crowdgazing: If you don't tense up under the strain, it starts to wash over you in a way you can breathe
    through.  It's a labyrinth, but check your watch: Less than forty minutes have elapsed.</p><p>
    
    The madness begins with a custom collage of rodeo Rhodes, mambo brass, curses, interview with an old-timer
    from the last days of the jazz age, and, inevitably, the rapture of a brisk, sample-driven limp.  This
    alternates with a dirty-south feel built on the same samples, until the whole thing is swept aside for a
    thick, janky live feel.  There's some chanting and the usual layered dirtwash, and then a vital, effluvial
    spray of mud and guts.  Pase Rock gives an unremarkable shoutout, and we're ready to push this sucker up
    to the precipice so it can drop for real.</p><p>
    
    A harsh, cramped vamp: sick, rich clav scurrying all over the sawtooth basement.  Skittish drill punctures
    little holes in a boom-bip clench already riddled with ligaments.  A minute of strict, reckless, glorious
    invention in this vein, then the same beat is exposed in a stream of pre-sweetened sinewaves.  Ripples
    forming around it push into a leisurely grind with some faded vocal hyping and a contagious snap-habit.
    Whining, malfunctioning synths do their abrupt flitters, squalls and death laughs.</p><p>
    
    Then a dirty one-two with faded guitars and rotted flute.  Muted backspun whispers wire-tripping you into
    the snare every single time.  Dribbled out into a froth of beatlets, pressured into giving note on the
    sixteenths, a soprano rebels.  Nasty-ass retarded old school cereal box top decoder ring jam.  Clav-busters
    with a glut of cutthroat mugs, and all to kill the garage punk interlude.  Overheard at a local wedding
    reception, a stuffed shirt muttering: ""Fuck you if you think that's bold.  I couldn't feel your shit if
    my hands were stuck inside your asshole.""  Such sublime humor, all but buried in the beat salad.</p><p>
    
    Caulked-up fuzz bass riding a slaw of creaks and cracks.  Alloys that strain the caustic slats.  Muscular
    and doubled, chime delights a cadence uncontested: clap to the tick, tick to the trip, stiff with a tensile
    tip, let it rip.  Whistle-dropped one to the punch of something fibrous, well-wrought with a grime delight.
    No effects, no intricacies, just a man and his sampler.  Fives and threes stutter, wrong and bloodied like
    Mahler slotted into a Pharoahe Monch parody, and after all this, six whole minutes of cello and a headwrap,
    a Delarosa and Asora-worthy splay of velvet benevolence to lock in the freshness.  Then, finally, abruptly,
    it skids to a halt with the blink-fast deceleration of stopped vinyl.</p></div>"|6450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6450-extinguished-outtakes/|8.2|Jascha Hoffman

The intention was probably to
    show how crazy the two-man producer/emcee team of Stoupe (The Enemy of Mankind) and Vinnie Paz is, but what
    ends up developing is a clear parallel: though Jedi Mind Tricks were once masterful rookies with a bright
    future, it could only have been a matter of time before they'd be dethroned; I don't know that they'll sink
    to the point of being convicted rapists with facial tattoos, but they've definitely been downed by Buster
    Douglas.</p><p>
    
    After Jus Allah left the group, Jedi Mind Tricks slowly but surely moved away from the Wu-Tang/Jeru-influenced
    intelligent hoodlum rap they started out with to an awkward mix of murder rap and the shiniest boom-bap money
    can buy. Glimmers of discontent began showing on 2000's <i>Violent by Design</i>, and now, with Jus gone and
    no balance to the artist formerly known as Ikon the Verbal Hologram's intense desire for commercial success,
    Jedi Mind Tricks have become too commercial for the underground, but not commercial enough to make any money.</p><p>
    
    Stoupe's production style is the most noticeable change.  Swiftly, he's gone from being heralded as the
    second coming of the RZA to a half-and-half mix of The Beatnuts and Necro. At least five of the rhythm
    tracks here are mysteriously upbeat with an alarming Spanish flavor that does anything but compliment
    Vinnie Paz's style. Hearing ex-Ikon tell the listener, ""I like blood, I like tasting your flesh/ I like
    slugs, I'm like David Koresh,"" over a pleasant beat that wouldn't sound out of place on a detergent
    commercial is really awkward. The rest is a mish-mash of strangely plain orchestration, dark electronic
    and acoustic guitar beats.  Just as Wu-Tang was once dirty with an aura of tightness, Stoupe's production
    now seems the epitome of unpolished commercial rap.</p><p>
    
    Vinnie Paz is <i>Visions of Gandhi</i>'s biggest problem.  His downfall, too, mirrors his idols in Wu-Tang:
    his initial style was rugged and intelligent, but here he's grown too comfortable, wasting one of the
    strongest deliveries in hip-hop on violent anti-gay rhetoric (""you like to hold hands with faggots/ You
    like the smell of males on your mattress""), shock rap (""I'll stab you in the bladder with a dagger and
    watch you die in piss"") and how much he hates <i>everyone</i> (""I fucking hate you/ I hate your mother
    and father because they made you/ I hate the universe because it create you/ I hate anyone and anything
    that embrace you"").  It's a poor man's Eminem vying for Top 40 approval.</p><p>
    
    The album's guest verses, fortunately, go a long way toward saving this record from being a complete disaster:
    showing an excellent break from Vinnie Paz. Ras Kass (one of the best rappers of all-time-- also currently
    incarcerated) drops a gem on ""Rise of the Machines"" (""Each rhyme's a minority report, fuck Tom Cruise"");
    Percee-P kills on ""Walk with Me"" (""I'm the poet who's rhyme was quoted, mind's unloaded/ Shine decoded the
    water flow in showing signs I wrote it""), while Non-Phixion, Kool G Rap and Tragedy Khadafi steal the show
    simply by holding their own.  And then there's Canibus, the Internet's greatest has-been, who drops two
    verses of absolute nonsense. It's completely staggering, hearing him threaten to ""discombobulate [confuse?!]
    prostates"" and claim that his ""metaphors started menopause in your moms before you were born."" His lack of
    knowledge shakes me on a personal level.</p><p>
    
    It should be noted that the best songs are hidden tracks. Stoupe's greatest achievement, ""I Against I"", from
    <i>Violent by Design</i> makes an appearance, with a subtly chopped piano that shows the difference in
    technical proficiency between the new and old tracks. It also highlights another serious problem with
    <i>Visions of Gandhi</i>: a complete lack of concern for subtlety.  Rather than pairing the darker tracks
    with lighter subject matter, the album is just a mix of angry lyrics over upbeat and downtempo production.
    The last time I saw Mike Tyson, he was co-hosting <i>The Jimmy Kimmel Show</i>. He made some reference to
    the movie <i>Gremlins</i> and everybody laughed-- <i>at</i> him, not with him.  Could be how Jedi Mind
    Tricks feel right now.</p></div>"|4337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4337-visions-of-gandhi/|4.9|Rollie Pemberton

I'd really like to see
    them all collected in one place someday, because often, the Oval remix was the best thing the disc in
    question had to offer.  Markus Popp's technique was not to pick out the catchiest bit and loop it as per
    custom, but to smash the track to pieces and see what could be assembled from the fragments.  We would
    listen: ""Ah, yes, it's an Oval track, let's see what he left of the original.  Hmm, not much, but there's
    something.  Wow, this thing is gorgeous.""  That's how it went.</p><p>
    
    Among my favorite of the many Oval remixes was his processing of ""International Velvet"" on Takako Minekawa's
    <i>Ximer</i> EP.  Popp took a light, airy J-pop tune and ran it through his digital wood chipper, and each
    little piece that came out the other end sparkled like a gold coin. ""International Velvet (Oval Remix)""
    made it on to many mixtapes over the next couple years, and I've been waiting for Oval to do something as
    immediately accessible and striking ever since.</p><p>
    
    Patience has been rewarded.  Popp's new project, So, a collaboration with songwriter Eriko Toyoda from Japan,
    reminds me of what I loved about ""International Velvet"".  Toyoda recorded a series of voice and guitar songs
    in her home in Mito-City, and then she and Popp went about deconstructing them.  As with the last few Oval
    records, one sonic inspiration for the dense treatments seems to be the sound of decelerated explosions.</p><p>
    
    The music is a series of volatile energy surges expanding outward, gradually swallowing the musical devices
    setting them in motion.  For the first time since <i>Dok</i>, the skipped CD is seldom heard, but elements
    from <i>Commers</i> and <i>Ovalprocess</i>-- modem whines, organ fuzz, guitar feedback-- are intact.  I
    should point out that the parameters of the collaboration are not clear and there is no record of who did
    what (the brilliant cover illustration by Katsumi Yokota leaves little room for detail about the music),
    but suffice to say, whoever had their hand on the mouse sounds <em>a lot</em> like Oval.</p><p>
    
    Markus Popp has always had disdain for the title of ""composer.""  His preferred term for his sound-making
    method is formally ""file management,"" but with So, he terms his contribution ""art direction.""  This is a
    significant shift, I think-- one appropriate to the project at hand.  From what I can guess about the
    nature of this collaboration, Toyoda provides the emotional script, Popp figures out how to light it,
    and they work together on the editing.</p><p>
    
    Toyoda's loose, drifting vocals and instrumental melodies are twisted, accentuated, buried, chopped, or
    surrounded in a halo of harmonics, but they are the reference point.  This arrangement plays to Popp's
    strengths as a sound manipulator.  Judging from the uniformly high quality of his remixes over the years,
    he's a fantastic listener and understands intuitively what is most interesting about a particular sound
    or phrase.  Each track is a unique, unpredictable swirl of voice, guitar, organ and god knows what else.</p><p>
    
    These ten unnamed tracks vary considerably in terms of which of the original elements remains.  The naked
    sound is most prevalent at the record's bookends.  The first track begins with delicately plucked electric
    guitar, humming vocals, and something like a pennywhistle approximating a bird song.  But within the first
    minute, the folk is picked apart and coated with a thick sheen of noise.  The track breaks periodically and
    returns to Toyoda's guitar strumming, grounding again the flights of noise.</p><p>
    
    The final number has a slow see-saw chord progression that could almost be a cover of Minnie Riperton's
    ""Lovin' You"", and it remains a traditional ballad throughout, with slight intrusions of organ feedback that
    threaten to overwhelm but ultimately remain subjugated to Toyoda's lovely tune.  It's a positively sublime
    closing track that perfectly illustrates the genius of the So collaboration, the finest record Popp has
    been involved with since <i>94diskont</i>.</p></div>"|7702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7702-so/|8.4|Mark Richardson

    me the standout track of Manitoba's <i>Up in Flames</i>.  Besides its layer upon layer of warm, gushing
    sound, it also held claim to the album's most grandiose beat, featured the delicate croon of Koushik Ghosh
    (who puts the ""Ko"" in this song's title), and boasted a fittingly high number of bah-bahs-bah's and handclaps.</p><p>
    
    But ""Hendrix with Ko"" had something deeper to it: though its surface was purely beautiful, its intricate
    structures and nuances encapsulated Dan Snaith's effort with the album itself-- particularly in light of his
    earlier IDM work. This song, more than any other on <i>Up in Flames</i>, preserved Manitoba's mild penchant
    for the four-to-the-floor electronic pulse that surfaced on <i>Start Breaking My Heart</i> (in such tracks
    as ""Mammals Vs. Reptiles"" and ""Tits and Ass: The Great Canadian Weekend""), without sacrificing his giant
    new psych-pop sound.  ""Hendrix with Ko"" seemed to be the truest to Snaith's role as IDM pastor: though
    it maintained a highly analog feel like the others on <i>Up in Flames</i>, its proclivity to beat seemed
    more informed by his previous electronic ethos.</p><p>
    
    If ""the beat is the thing"" in ""Hendrix with Ko"", then it makes some kind of sense that Snaith includes with
    this EP two very beat-oriented, if very un-<i>Up in Flames</i>, B-sides.  Unlike in the <i>Jacknuggeted</i>
    EP, whose bonus cuts seemed to share the same psychedelic tenor of its title track, it's hard to believe
    that ""Cherrybomb"" and ""Silver Splinters"" were even culled from the same studio sessions.  The two tracks,
    as if stuck in the no-man's-land of the Snaith catalog, seem to function more or less as a missing link
    between Manitoba's two dissimilar releases: each presents common ground in Snaith's beat-happiness and his
    oft-dramatic vertical composition.</p><p>
    
    ""Cherrybomb"" immediately cuts to a simple driving pulse, painted in the
    subtle pinks and blues of the Boards of Canada sound palette.  An alarm clock rings on occasion, and the
    bell and organ sounds that we would hear throughout <i>Up in Flames</i> provide a deeper texture. ""Silver
    Splinters"", meanwhile, sports a big beat reminiscent of Gus Gus' <i>Polydistortion</i>, wavering in
    atmospheric intensity, replete with flute, handclaps, and even a Prefuse-style vocal scratch-up. A trumpet
    pushes the song into its next section when it flips its octave a la jazz standard ""Gingerbread Man"", all
    while a simple IDM lullaby persists amidst the madness.</p><p>
    
    The <i>Hendrix with Ko</i> EP also includes, curiously, the ""Jacknuggeted"" video. Why this didn't have its
    place on that song's EP can probably be chalked up to a matter of timing (i.e. it may not have been completed
    when that single was released). It's a treat nonetheless, serving up a trippy frolic in the woods that
    perfectly complements the song.  Revealing Manitoba B-sides and Quicktime movies hardly appeal to more than
    an already convinced contingent of Snaith worshippers, but if you count yourself among them (and you ought to),
    this is well worth picking up.</p></div>"|5080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5080-hendrix-with-ko-ep/|7.4|Nicholas B. Sylvester
