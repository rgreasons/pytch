    that exuded a diaphanous cool and open-air jazziness. Like fellow Beat Jedi Madlib, Spinna adhered to a
    jazz-based aesthetic but was willing to dig into other genre's for a pasticcio rewarding in its eclecticism.
    Although Spinna's religious approach to beat-mining resulted in some of the genre's slyest rhythms, Spinna's
    lyrical counterpart, Jigmasta MC Kriminul, wasn't the most compelling lyricist around-- at least, not for
    the duration of an entire album.  Spinna then went on to more tangential projects, which reached a zenith
    in <i>Strange Games and Things</i>, an excellent cornucopia of 70s soul and rare-groove nuggets.</p><p>
<i>Here to There</i> marks Spinna's contribution to the excellent ""BBE Beat Generation"", a series that's
    yielded some of the most sought-after beatfests of the past two years, including excellent outings by the
    likes of legendary hip-hop producers Pete Rock, Jazzy Jeff, and Jay Dee.  Although there's no mistaking
    <i>Here to There</i> for anything other than a hip-hop album, Spinna weaves a thick musical lattice of R&amp;B;,
    house, jazz, and blues. Like DJ Shadow's classic <i>Endtroducing</i>, the breadth of music cultures covered
    on <i>Here to There</i> is nearly overwhelming, and once again reaffirms the producer's role as cultural
    archivist. But unlike Shadow's often sullenly aggressive and disparately derivative style, Spinna's vision
    of American music in the latter 20th century is irrefutably harmonious.</p><p>
    
    For <i>Here to There</i>, Spinna mines the jazz cool of Art Blakey, the bittersweet swoon of classic Marvin
    Gaye, and the dancehall euphoria of Carl Craig.  On ""Rock (Unplugged)"", Tortured Soul multi-instrumentalist
    Jay Rodriguez punctuates Spinna's ""rock the house"" cuts with blasts of sax while Ethan White adds a welcome
    Rhodes-fueled funk groove.  ""Idols"" has a Wurlitzer twinkling atop shifting kool-jazz breaks as the sultry
    soultress Vinia Mojica slithers between subtle vibraphone tones. Spinna even harks back to his previous work
    on the house compilation <i>Raiding the Crates</i> for the broken beat production of ""Music and Me"".</p><p>
    
    The guest MCs on <i>Here to There</i> are exceptional, and manage to maintain the vibe of eclecticism and
    optimism.  A synth wobbles on top of a slow and sweet break as Shadowman reclaims his failures in a paean
    to self-determination on the stand-out ""Driven"".  And the Apani B. Fly and Jean Grea guest spots on ""Hold""
    are a testament to the increasing popular assertion that females are the future of hip-hop lyricism.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes, though, the melding of different strains of music is almost too seamless. As flawlessly as
    everything blends, <i>Here to There</i> doesn't really suggest any new relationships between the various
    genres that Spinna incorporates.  While aural fission is obviously something Spinna is trying to avoid
    at all costs, the music occasionally takes on the qualities of smooth jazz, especially on Soulive-backed
    track ""All Up in It"".  Still, if the listener wants to be seduced by the music, rather than confronted and
    challenged, <i>Here to There</i> comes highly recommended.</p></div>"|2380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2380-here-to-there/|7.5|Sam Chennault

    most popular constructions is the womb. The womb is the place where we all
    imagine ourselves at peace and feeling good. Your body floats in warm,
    liquid space, and your senses are at rest. If you could experience light in
    the womb, it would only be the dimmest flesh-colored glow. Maybe your folks
    pump the Raymond Scott records and the Mozart into your Mom's belly, but
    the only thing you hear are soft, indistinct noises run through a low-pass
    filter. A friend of mind used to drink cup after cup of TheraFlu when nursing
    a hangover. He claimed the medicine put a five-inch thick layer of warm cotton
    between him and the world. And that's how I imagine the womb: A tuned-out
    heaven perfect for dreaming.</p><p>
    
    With <i>Submers</i>, Vancouver-based artist Loscil (Scott Morgan) practices
    the art of the aural womb. This is music without sharp edges. The synth
    textures are warm, deep and viscous as amniotic fluid, and like Wolfgang
    Voigt's legendary Gas project, Loscil knows that you can't live inside the
    body of another without hearing a distant heartbeat. So a delicate 4/4
    thump drifts in on occasion to remind us of the source of this safe and
    wonderful place. Calling <i>Submers</i> ""The Best Album to Fall Asleep to
    in 2002"" (it came out late last year) might seem like a backhanded compliment,
    but this is seriously gorgeous stuff that just happens to be the right sort
    of thing for drifting into another consciousness.</p><p>
<i>Submers</i> has a concept: All of the tracks are named for submarines.
    And if ""womb-like"" is one apt description for <i>Submers</i>, ""aquatic"" is
    another. In additional to sounding a bit like Gas, Loscil also reminds me
    of Japanese ambient collective Neina in his focus on textures so complicated
    and detailed they can pass for nature. The drones in ""Argonaut I"" are piled
    at least four layers high, enough to get lost in, as a glowing edge of higher
    pitched sound twists around something deeper and harder to fathom. ""Gymote""
    adds the slightest wisp of static and gentle, almost bell-like tones as
    rhythmic accompaniment, and then sends the whole thing on its way with a
    speedy, steady bass drum. ""Diable Martin"" has a similarly quick pace, but
    something about the distance of the thump makes tempo matter little. It
    still feels like a drone, even if the BMP is technically over 100. ""Diable
    Martin"" has a few other techno bits to it, a quivering synth sequence and
    light taps of percussion, though these elements don't disturb the reverie.</p><p>
    
    But the delicate touches are what really make it. The unsteady drone in
    ""Resurgam"" is fragile as hot glass blown to its bursting point, such a
    beautiful sound that could possibly fall apart at any moment. ""Triton"" adds
    the slightest bit of tension and dub undercurrents, along with a ghost of an
    orchestral sweep, and though it seems less tied to the theme it's one of the
    best tracks here. Finally, ""Kursk"", a tribute to the lost Russian sub, ends
    the album on an ominous tone, with the kind of mid-bass cello-like drones
    that Stars of the Lid dream about. Then comes silence. It's time to open
    your eyes, walk slowly to the CD player, and press ""play"" again.</p></div>"|4867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4867-submers/|8.0|Mark Richardson

It's
    the sheer ""fuck you"" of it.  That doesn't mean aggression, or spiked shoulders, and certainly not the late
    70s marketability that came from politicizing it-- just a band's desire to play whatever the hell they want,
    without regard for anyone who may or may not want to hear it.  The Velvets, the NY Dolls, The Ramones, X,
    Big Black (and the list continues intermittently ad infinitum) were all just raising their middle finger to
    their audience; the people who saluted back were the keepers.</p><p>
    
    But naturally, punk's elements of style were slowly, inexorably co-opted and assimilated into ""markets"" for
    particular ""sounds,"" finally settling into various media-friendly blocks like new wave and grunge.  The punk
    movement fizzled with the backslide into further genre Balkanization, but that doesn't mean the desire for
    confrontation has subsided.  For twenty years, punk has bided its time, and bands like Liars, Black Dice,
    and now, Giddy Motors are poised at the starting line of the next big race in rock-- the race to get wherever
    it is they want to go, and fast.</p><p>
<i>Make It Pop</i> is the Motors' case study in hellish cacophony; with just guitar, bass, drums, and a
    little sax (the most underused instrument in rock), Giddy Motors lurch, stomp, and eventually plunge headlong
    into near-total bedlam.  The only constant throughout is Manu Ros' flawless percussion; rhythm is the heart
    of any band, and with drumming this solid, a band would be justified in doing just about anything, period.
    Not an ounce of that opportunity is wasted, either-- when the Motors throw their act into high gear, the
    bass clatters with a menace almost unheard since the days of Big Black (not surprising since Nietzschian
    superman Steve Albini is working the controls), and Gaverick de Vis' guitar wails like thunder and lightning,
    matched only by the orgiastic spasms of his own vocals.  Together, the sound is hell on wheels, with a beat
    that absolutely slaughters.</p><p>
    
    It's not until the band slows things down that <i>Make It Pop</i> is discernable as anything more than
    well-assembled chaos, but finally, the influences start to fall into place: A slightly malicious take on
    modern free jazz (evidenced most clearly by the intro to ""Bottle Opener""), rhythmic stretches of post-punk
    minimalism, and de Vis' fire and brimstone chants combine with violently swaying, stabbing melodies, directly
    conjuring memories of Nick Cave and The Birthday Party (especially on the overwhelming ""Cranium Crux"").  A
    sneering rap (of sorts) opens ""Sassy"" before it downshifts into a plodding assault of bass and snares,
    punctuated by the occasional anguished yelp.  Here, what is superficially pure chaos starts to make
    incredible sense.</p><p>
    
    And then Giddy Motors catch you offguard: ""Venus Medallist"" enters as if your disc-changer had skipped ahead
    to another record without your realizing it.  All the contorted shouts, rumbling bass and dense percussion
    give way to gently rolling acoustic guitar and gorgeous string swells.  The disorientation this track
    produces is almost palpable-- I spent the first half just waiting for a crash, an explosion, anything.
    Instead, I ended up having to go back and listen from the beginning to what might actually be the highlight
    of an already strong album.  Beautiful and unexpected, ""Medallist"" is the signature on the Giddy Motors'
    frantic mission statement for the future of rock.</p></div>"|3447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3447-make-it-pop/|8.3|Eric Carr

Eh.""</p><p>
    I throw a sidelong glance at my brother's ""record collection"" and take note of the names: Moby,
    Foo Fighters, Eminem.  The best and brightest from the radio dial.  He wouldn't know indie if
    it came to his party and spent the whole night pining for some girl, but he's clearly an expert
    on ""Eh""; after a lifetime spent cultivating an appreciation for marginal-to-mediocre mainstream
    runoff, my brother has finally applied what he learned.  In one sentence, he trumped everything
    I could write about this record.  How can an album as tight, consistent, and energetic as <i>Highly
    Refined Pirates</i> be at once so thoroughly unimpressive?  Minus the Bear is a talented bunch with a
    somewhat eclectic pedigree (Botch, Sharks Keep Moving, Kill Sadie), but the brainy arithmetic of its
    hooks, and the growly, sensitive-but-angry vocals are every inch the bastard sons of the middling indie
    norm.</p><p>
    Through changing time signatures, dynamic, bouncing rhythms, and thirty-one flavors of guitar noises,
    Minus the Bear make a Herculean effort to maintain their audience's attention.  They even slip in
    beat-driven electronics from time to time, digital ear candy to distract from the core blahness of
    their particular spin on well-spun clichés, but it's never more than a flourish.  When the dizziness
    subsides, J. Robbins asks, ""Eric, why not listen to <i>For Your Own Special Sweetheart</i> instead?
    Doesn't this just make you long for <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>?""</p><p>
    And I want to say to him, ""You know, Mr. Robbins, you're right.  Why eat hamburger when you can have
    steak?""  Rock's a finite genre, after all-- not everyone can innovate.  Imitation's a fact of life,
    but the cardinal rule is to <i>refine</i> what's been done before, and while Minus the
    Bear expertly execute existing formulas, they never once look beyond the tablature.  This only serves
    to underscore the greatness of their inspirations (Dismemberment Plan, Jawbox, Built to Spill), and
    by track three on <i>Pirates</i>, I can't shake the thought that everyone who's listened to any
    independent music in the last ten years has heard this record before.  Maybe it's just that the
    Bear choose to emulate a sound that's too fresh to be paraded under the banner of purism or revival;
    maybe it's less inspired derivation.  That's a subtle distinction in any case: The bottom line is
    their roots are showing badly.  Am I jaded?  Maybe a little.</p><p>
    On some level, music is a visceral pleasure, and though it veers towards bemusement, Minus the Bear's
    second full-length release manages to entertain.  In particular, ""Get Me Naked 2: Electric Boogaloo"" and the
    opener, ""Thanks For the Killer Game of Crisco Twister"" come close to mustering some of the grandeur
    and transcendent glory of the more powerful acts that obviously inspire them.  Despite the
    emotion in Jake Snider's voice, and a few soaring melodies, they never quite find their way out from
    the shadows of the past.  If only the songs lived up to the promise of their titles: An album
    even half as fun as a rousing game of Crisco Twister might have justified repeated spins.</p></div>"|5324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5324-highly-refined-pirates/|5.4|Eric Carr

    tone, that I find it hard to focus on anything else when he's playing,
    including the actual song.  In fact, Yuji's sound is so cringe-inducing,
    so thin and elastic, that I always wonder how he's able to fit in with
    other musicians-- and yet, I almost always love the bands he performs with.
    But it struck me as I listened to the latest offering by Rovo, one of many
    bands Yuji can claim membership to, that it's come to the point where I can
    predict exactly what he'll do in any given situation, be it deft, repetitive
    figures or drawn-out, single-note moans.</p><p>
    
    Rovo usually plays hard trance that borders on funk but never quite gets
    there, and Yuji's lines supply what little melody is able to make it through
    the layers of noise.  The problem is, this makes things a tad monotonous
    when the rest of the band isn't on fire.  And while <i>Flage</i> does have
    some very hot moments, it can't quite match the energetic glee of <i>Sai</i>
    or <i>Imago</i> when taken as a whole.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Canvas"", begins with Yuji's overdubbed string lines recreating
    a string quartet; this is a new sound for Rovo, who rarely stray far from
    arrangements that can't be duplicated live (and make no mistake, this band
    is much easier to fawn over live).  Beneath the strings, a pulse brews,
    beginning with a barely audible shaker, eventually building to include two
    drummers and the rest of the band.  The song repeats Yuji's simple violin
    lines throughout-- which alternate between extended brush-stroke lines and
    bouncy, synth-doubled figures-- and the beats range from faux-techno to
    full-on samba.  In the 70s, Rovo might have been considered a fusion band,
    similar to mid-period Weather Report; they have the eclecticism down, but
    for better or worse, nowhere near the color.</p><p>
    
    Where these guys excel is in dancefloor rave-ups-- one that are too fast
    to actually dance to-- like ""Spica"" and ""Sukhna"".  The first tune, though
    it sounds less like a ""song"" than an impromptu jam, mixes in manic James
    Brown beats with light electro touches and the ever-present fusion aftertaste,
    via constant group interplay and Yuji's improvisation.  The latter kicks
    down the doors with a furious percussion coda wherein bass drums and
    Chinaboys endure a brutal punishing in the name of hyper-badass pogo
    flailing.</p><p>
    
    The near ambient ""Mov"" begins with Japanese bells and a percolating,
    cotton-coated minimalist guitar figure.  Per Rovo's general form, Yuji's
    violin enters with long, reverb-heavy tones, and the synth and cymbals
    build to a subtle high that many new age composers might happily lose
    themselves in.  It's not that I'm not impressed by Rovo's mastery of
    this texture (though I'd be perfectly happy to see them develop a few
    more)-- after all, calming music can be lovely in spots-- but when
    trance-heavy post-rock is the game, sometimes the details seem glossed
    over.</p><p>
    
    Rovo are one of the most popular bands in Japan right now-- this album
    debuted in that country's Top 40-- and there's something to be said for
    infiltrating a nation's pop-conscience with semi-out music.  At the very
    least, I'm happy for the musicians, most of whom spent a decade or two
    prior to their formation paying noisy dues.  However, one of the things
    I notice with each passing Rovo disc is a tendency to cruise when going
    full throttle would be more fun, or to stay put when leaping for joy
    would pull the listener back in.  But I can't fault them for what they
    aren't, so I'll let the record play and chalk up the even-keeled vibe
    to the band's experience.</p></div>"|6847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6847-flage/|6.8|Dominique Leone

    O'Rourke's <i>Bad Timing</i> and the coinciding revisionist revival of John Fahey's
    consistently challenging work by hipsters. The repetitive motifs and lingering gestures of a
    large percentage of underground music (results vary from Town and Country to Howard Hello) easily
    lend themselves to a shimmering, warm guitar tone. On top of that, it's a pretty interesting
    contrast to the Albini-inspired, sharp and brittle guitar splatters that round out the rest of
    independent rock.</p><p>
    
    It's easy to drop Fahey's name in there as a representative for the phenomenon, but Fahey gets
    cited for the simple mention of the word ""finger-picking,"" rather than what his albums actually
    dealt with. America, certainly, and a distinct sense of pacing, yet what also shows up is some
    considerably intense personal conflict. 1967's <i>Requia</i> dealt with a loved one's mental
    breakdown; <i>Fare Forward Voyagers</i> (1974) showed Fahey looking into Buddhist religion, and
    1997's <i>City of Refuge</i> offered a pretty bleak perspective on his once awe-enamored and
    surreal view of the world.  Another defining aspect of Fahey's work: An overwhelming sense
    self-mockery and musical parody, represented most notably in his alter-ego, Blind Joe Death,
    and the opening track from <i>Days Have Gone By</i>.</p><p>
    
    It's important to note that finger-picking is more than a technique; a genre was born
    through Fahey's experimentation, but by the time people like Leo Kottke and Robbie Basho were
    borrowing from the same American and World music roots, something had changed. A part of
    Fahey broke in his first couple of albums, a part he was reluctant to return to; his work
    got to be more and more adventurous, conforming less and less to the genre, while a whole culture
    of new age gurus began to devour the plaintive meditation his style engendered.  Over the past decade
    and a half, more and more rock artists have borrowed from the golden age of instrumental guitar Fahey
    brough to bear.  Independent music's martyrdom complex works its way into the
    somewhat sad, introspective music, while still containing those inherent themes of American cultural
    history embedded in the work.  You know, for added depth.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, the new album by Bosco and Jorge doesn't conform to this tradition. <i>Ally in the Sky</i>
    certainly contains its share of American nostalgia, augmented with the familiar suspects (pedal
    steel, acoustic bass), yet isn't hell-bent on milking sympathy. Yes, there's repetition and
    contemplation, but there's also an incredible amount of joy: The pieces burst rather than brood.
    Looking at the performances on <i>Ally in the Sky</i> by veterans like Rob Mazurek and Fred
    Lonberg-Holm, one sees revelry and eruptive sound. The tradition of each intricate guitar part
    is latticed with banjo arpeggios and cello harmonics; there are multiple phrases and ideas in each
    song, something of a departure from the current aesthetic.</p><p>
<i>Ally in the Sky</i> is on the verge of uncovering something forgotten under the weight of
    strictly ""post-"" seriousness.  It's not only the sadness of a lost America, it's a celebration
    of it.  <i>Jimmy Corrigan</i> creator Chris Ware once described the strength of the George Herriman,
    creator of <i>Krazy Kat</i>:  ""He didn't use many words, the characters literally seemed to
    be moving around on the page."" <i>Ally in the Sky</i> is a somehow similar constant, where
    implied motion lays deep within the set orchestration. <i>Krazy Kat</i> had the same basic story
    line repeated over and over, relying on the personalities of its cast; likewise, the instruments
    on this record interact with each other as well-defined characters, whatever the setting, whatever
    the mood. It's not so much about humor as the absurdity of continuing: these characters have a clear
    destiny that they're oblivious to: Riding in the car, looking out our window at
    exit signs and farmland, at animals and crops, we hear this unrelenting, proud march.</p><p>
<i>Ally in the Sky</i> shows Bosco and Jorge developing into something more complicated than Kottke
    gestures; it gives a sense of a world outside of music. Somewhere, for a couple of bucks, you could
    buy dinner and some records, a newspaper. Sunsets, smokes, opinions; family, neighbors, low-wages.
    It's a little idyllic and romanticized, sure, but the extra steps into reality make <i>Ally</i>
    more tangible than the usual daydreams of days gone by.</p></div>"|874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/874-ally-in-the-sky/|6.9|Kim Shannon

    recorded some of the country's best jazz musicians and brought others from around the world to work with
    the locals.  From the cover photos of winterscapes and frigid oil rigs that look so cold they make your
    teeth hurt, to the label's signature sound of vast reverb and chill precision, ECM was made for Norway.
    The label has indulged emotional high notes that would embarrass more straight-laced jazz players, but
    no matter what happens on an album, authenticity radiates from its musicians' independence: The music is
    framed, not molded.  The experiences can be unabashededly rich or pure and still, but they always come
    directly from the players, who are effectively alone, responding directly to the moment.</p><p>
    The Norwegian quartet Supersilent record for Rune Grammofon, but they're distributed internationally by ECM.
    In many ways, they'd be the perfect ECM band, though they have an edgier, almost sinister undercurrent that's
    unlike anything that label has approached.  And for all the images they may summon, the band makes music as
    abstractly as possible: The albums and tracks are numbered, not titled; the personnel aren't listed on the
    cover; and for all the attempts to label them ""jazz,"" ""electronic"" or ""ambient"", the band eschews genres:
    The music's played so close to the vest that it slips under any classification.</p><p>
    Supersilent is an electroacoustic ensemble, formed when the free jazz trio Veslefrekk-- Arve Henriksen on
    trumpet, keyboardist Ståle Storløkken, and Jarle Vespestad on drums-- played a show with producer, live
    electronics artist and self-described ""audio virus"" Helge Sten (aka Deathprod).  That show's success
    encouraged them to record a three-disc, three-hour set titled <i>1-3</i>, which was an intense barrage of
    rhythms and assaulting sprays of electric noise, plus extras, like a monotonous voice reading instruction
    manuals.  They reined it in slightly on the follow-up, <i>4</i>, and in 2001, they released <i>5</i>, culled
    from live recordings that changed the focus to slowly shifting textures and an almost ambient pace.  But
    their latest album, <i>6</i>, is their most engrossing and tactically varied yet.  It's also the most
    accessible.</p><p>
    For music this moody, it's surprising how neutral that mood turns out to be.  The atmosphere is thick, but
    the band stays emotionally reserved.  The sound is almost stoic; its sonic extremes don't so much as nudge
    the slow tempo or contemplative tone.  A piece may be based on a repeating figure or simple rhythmic pattern,
    but that repetition comes from improvisation: Everything this group plays, every time, is improvised, and
    each track is presumably edited from a longer session.  More to the point, it never settles: Vespestad never
    locks down the beat, the ambience never grows static, and they never make a noise just to fill space.  You
    can't treat this as background music without getting distracted by the decisions being made at every second,
    and although the end result is restrained-- almost weirdly cool, even at its messiest-- it refuses to be
    anticipated.</p><p>
    The electronics largely define Supersilent's music: Sten does live manipulations and processing, and,
    with Storløkken, deploys sounds from the group's many synthesizers-- one of which is built around the
    sound processing chip of a Commodore 64.  These sounds are incredibly varied, seemingly created with
    both state-of-the-art and harsh, lo-fi equipment.  The keyboards crash like waves on ""6.5"", one emitting
    a howling, piercing noise that rises over a great shifting mass below, while on ""6.1"", the chords are
    neither bright nor dark, but neutral and stern, like stone chimneys of sound.</p><p>
    Drummer Vespestad is a formidable improviser and colorist, though he plays with considerable (some would
    joke ""Scandinavian"") restraint.  He shifts expertly around the keyboardists on ""6.1""; and on the erratic
    cat-and-mouse game of ""6.3"", Sten and Storløkken chase each other, sneaking more and more quietly until
    Vespestad abruptly slams down on top of them.  But Vespestad's jazz drumming comes through on ""6.2"",
    which emerges as the most strictly jazz-like track: It's similar to the measured pace and dark, giving
    textures of Miles Davis' 70s fusion ballads, which are also an influence on trumpeter Henriksen.  Henriksen
    serves here as the soft voice against his colleagues: His tone sounds breathier and more faltering than
    Davis', but he also sometimes sings-- wordlessly, in a beautiful, pinched high voice-- and near the end,
    he even whistles, a lone, aching sound against a gently buzzing texture.</p><p>
<i>6</i> has gentler passages than Supersilent's previous albums; on ""6.4"", Sten's introduction of a guitar
    puts the group close to Sigur Rós or Godspeed You! Black Emperor-- two bands the label is gunning for as
    they convert new listeners abroad.  But most post-rock sounds numbingly rigid next to this: Supersilent
    may go for a big finish but the crescendos can rise suddenly, or appear so roughly and naturally that it's
    obvious that no single player is forcing cues or smoothing out the arc.</p><p>
    On those terms, ""6.4"" is both an easy entrance for new listeners and a pinnacle of everything the band
    strives for.  Melodic without any set tune, it gently escalates on Sten's guitar and the warm synths,
    with what sounds like an autoharp interjecting in the background.  The almost forlorn sentiments appear
    as the volume climbs, and even though a big finish seems inevitable, you can hear the band deciding moment
    by moment how to ascend and when to hit the climax.  Every note is demandingly gorgeous, every phrase as
    solid but irregular as a natural object, and the majesty it achieves comes out jagged, loud and even harsh--
    and it comes entirely from the musicians: It's a communication that's fierce, human, and immense.</p></div>"|7628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7628-6/|9.1|Chris Dahlen

    Interscope bought Pitchfork editor Ryan Schreiber one of those personal, surfable wave pools like the guy
    from Mötley Crüe has. Otherwise, why would we review this? Pitchfork's quasi-pride is in opening reader
    ears to new music, and unless you're a Kaczynskian separatist, these songs have already been smuggled into
    your pop consciousness like drugs into Woodstock 99. Speaking of that rape-tastic festival and time-lapse
    history of market forces, what from the 90s will be remarkable to future armchair musicologists? The
    subcurrents way outperformed the mainstream, and even those subcurrents look to be outperformed by the 00s'
    bustling underbelly-dwellers.  Please tell me that, as fads recycle, 2013 won't see the kids snorting coke
    off of each other's ripped-up leather as they rock out to industrio-clash.</p><p>
    U2 spent the 90s either in a war with Negativland, or marketing themselves as a celebration of, spoof of,
    critique of, and source of rampant consumption and multimedia force-feeding. No one in the 90s thought of
    warplanes when they heard the name U2; they thought it referred to the band's exponential unit-shiftin'.
    Having a remotely acronymic name put U2 in good company in the eighties (REM, XTC, PIL, INXS), while the
    90s saw the proliferation of TLC, KFC and AIDS.  So I can hardly blame U2 for becoming a satire of U2, then
    a lite-techno version of U2, only to emerge in 2000 as a U2 tribute band. As if the band internalized the
    poet Wallace Stevens' line, ""We have been a little insane about the truth,"" U2 flagrantly tested the
    elasticity of their sound, appearance, attitude, and fanbase.</p><p>
    One thing the band hasn't dicked around with is how many ways they'll grub for your filthy lucre, releasing,
    as is well within the rights of any band this huge, a zillion different nation-specific versions of their
    singles, and even several different limited import versions of this comp: There's a bonus-track edition with
    ""The Fly"", a Japanese set with 31 tracks, and another two-disc version including a DVD and many of the
    one-disc version's curious absentees, albeit in B-side (sigh) remixed form. Best of luck to any stormchasers
    who want to pay shipping for all that; I'll stick to discussing the 16-track version you're most likely to
    find at Wal-Mart or Jaded Colonel's Aging Towny Discs and Vinyl.</p><p>
    If'n I was an exec at the band's label, I'd have recommended wide-releasing a two-disc lookbackamajig rather
    than equitably represent the lesser material. Simply repackage the gorgeous <i>Achtung Baby</i> as <i>The
    Best of 1990-2000</i>, and then include a bonus disc anthologizing high points from their other recent
    records, entitled either a) the humbling <i>Things We Dropped Along the Way</i>, b) the 80s-linking <i>Still
    Haven't Found What We're Looking For</i>, c) the Clinton-nodding <i>Mistakes Were Made</i>, or d) the
    spiritual <i>When There Were Only Two Sets of Footprints, That's When the Rhythm Section Was Carrying Us</i>.</p><p>
    By now you've no doubt heard the limerick (apropos for this Irish quartet) so popular with sixth graders who,
    preferring to blame the man who made PJ Harvey boring, overlook the work of sirs Eno, Lanois, and Orbit:</p><p>
<i>There once was a band named U2,<br/>
    Who ruled and then mightily blew.<br/>
    When asked, ""Hey, what happened?""<br/>
    The band took a crap and<br/>
    Flood had someone remix their pooh.</i></p><p>
    But there's something interesting about U2's willingness to endlessly reconfigure their recent songs. Either
    they're admitting that the quality of their output has declined and is no longer utterly singular, or they're
    admitting that they're tired of operating under the weight of having their work regarded as so damn canonical.
    The band definitely, and consciously, shed its sacrosanctity in the 90s, and it's fitting that one of this
    collection's brand new songs appears in a remix version, while the ""original"" is relegated to a B-side of
    one the many versions of its remix's single, as if the band disdained it. Maybe all the tinkering is an
    attempt to circumvent how the populist, but diluting, dance touches of <i>Zooropa</i> and <i>Pop</i> date
    themselves.</p><p>
    That new song, ""Electrical Storm"", is a fine one for this version of U2, which means that it plays like a
    funkier, happier, more colossally passionate Coldplay/Radiohead hybrid. ""Electrical Storm"" also brings up
    the quandary of why two songs from 2002 are on a collection that's supposed to be an honest-to-goodness
    decade-spanner. Please tell me these tunes weren't tossed together unscrupulously in order to spice this
    November release up for that clusterfucked ""holiday"" that blends druids and messiahs and credit limits and
    gorging on mall foodcourt slurry. The other brand new tune on <i>1990-2000</i> is the theme from <i>Gangs of
    New York</i>, Scorsese's ambitious film about a magician's rivalry with a younger version of the cowardly
    lion of Oz for the heart of a transvestite, set against the backdrop of the riots that almost destroyed the
    <i>Muppet Christmas Carol</i> soundstage.  Instead of living up to the film's gleeful taste for swindle and
    skullduggery, the song, ""The Hands That Built America"", is a woozy wedge of that empty grandeur that plagued
    the band's return to seriousness on 2000's <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i>. See that album's pre-9-11
    ""New York"", or the band's 9-11 tribute during the tragedy's subsequent Super Bowl. The band's heart is in
    the right place, but in that heart/place lie stupid songs. With the heavy-handed ""Hands"", U2 have finally
    penned their answer to ""This Used to Be My Greyhound"", or whatever that Madonna song was a commercial for.</p><p>
    Another way ""Hands"" sucks is that it pillages the cool operatic moment from ""Miss Sarajevo"", a song otherwise
    a pillage of a Velvet Underground chorus and a pillage of The Byrds' pillage of Ecclesiastes, from U2's
    clever <i>Passengers</i> project, a record of songs for fictional movies that worked as a tongue-in-cheek
    statement about how good the movies have been to U2, a band whose image and tours have always seemed
    larger than life. Even the videotaped footage of the indignant Bono goose-stepping through ""Sunday Bloody
    Sunday"" was somehow cinematic in scope, and made their later film <i>Rattle and Hum</i> a no-brainer. One
    prays that an Imax feature isn't looming if U2 devolves into the Stones. In addition to the <i>Gangs</i>
    theme, and the Pavarotti-sampling film-fake ""Sarajevo"", this disc features soundtrack work from Wim Wenders'
    <i>Until the End of the World</i> and <i>Batman Forever</i> (U2's song is, of course, their orchestral-rock
    action-franchise counterpart to McCartney's Bond-anthem ""Live and Let Die""). Curiously absent are U2's songs
    from the bad Wim Wenders remake <i>City of Angels</i> and the bad Wim Wenders original <i>Million Dollar
    Hotel</i>. And hey, where's Adam Clayton's solo version of the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> theme?  <i>J'accuse!</i></p><p>
    Okay, so <i>Achtung</i> is criminally under- and misrepresented. You do get ""One"", which Johnny Cash did
    better on his <i>Solitary Man</i>. (Where's the Cash-sung <i>Zooropa</i> oddity ""The Wanderer""? I'd prefer
    that to the questionable half-rap of-- a new mix of!-- ""Numb"".) The problem with U2's ""One"" is that the pimpy
    music never sounds as despondent as the lyrics, like how critics charged Billy Bob Thornton's character in
    <i>The Man Who Wasn't There</i> with looking too suave to be believably pathetic. To U2's version I picture
    white people in their apartments clutching wine glasses, unbuttoning the top button of Gap shirts and giving
    each other come-hither looks. Cash's cover invokes an image of an epic judgment day for a planet festering
    with failed lovers.</p><p>
    I can't get past how the verse part of ""Gone"" (new mix!) recalls The Beatles' ""Taxman"". And the redundantly
    titled ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of"" is one of those positive advice songs that flow from Bono
    when he's in his Christian altar-ego. ""Beautiful Day"" is the best of these, and its Edge bombast can
    transform quarter-beer night at the bowling alley into a precipice of gladiatorial triumph, the way the
    melodrama of ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"" can leave patrons of a diner that used to be a Shoney's agog.
    While ""Discotheque"" (new mix!) is still unforgivable, ""Stay (Faraway So Close)"" is still a great pop song,
    even as it sounds like U2 doing Sebadoh doing the Smiths. The sassy ""Staring at the Sun"" (new mix!) even
    kind of kicks ass.</p><p>
    But oh well.  This CD is for the fairweather fans who can afford the good seats at U2 shows; it's a coarse
    chronicle of a band inarguably masterful at creating four-minute forty-second atmospheres in which Bono
    pants and prolongs his falsetto triple-threat of ""heeeee,"" ""hooooo,"" and ""hiiiiii."" Are the buffalo adorning
    the packaging an activist reference to whitey's waste of these animals that the Native Americans handled
    more efficiently and reverently, or is the band joking about being bloated and on the edge of extinction?
    These songs were designed to keep us warm in our cubicles, to prevent us from leaping from dorm windows or
    attempting to mate with vending machines. Like too much of the entertainment from 1990-2000, this disc
    contains beautifully recorded, and expertly executed, piffle.</p></div>"|8327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8327-the-best-of-1990-2000/|5.6|William Bowers

    him.  Sure, there were snatches, be it from his last (and convolutedly enough, most popular) work, the theme
    to <i>Space Ghost</i>, or his extra-dimensional tremors as sideman on Pharoah Sanders' <i>Tauhid</i>.  But
    unless you felt like digging for some buried moments on Herbie Mann records (or his unaccredited turn on Miles'
    <i>Jack Johnson</i>), you were stuck with his 80s and 90s work. While <i>Ask the Ages</i> was furious (again
    teaming him with Sanders), and <i>Guitar</i> burned through Bill Laswell's slickness, most of us were stuck
    gleaming his six-string prophecies from the sludgy supergroup Last Exit, where he shared earspace with Laswell,
    Peter Brötzmann, and Ronald Shannon Jackson.</p><p>
    Only in the last two years has this changed, with a CD version of <i>Black Woman</i> finally unveiling the
    free-jazz fury that Sharrock concocted at the end of the 60s with wife Linda, pianist Don Pullen, and percussive
    octopus Milford Graves.  A singular testament in the proto-forms of fire music's freedom skronk and feral rock
    howl, a follow-up would be daunting to any artist.  And so, when he next turned up, in the BYG-Actuel series
    with <i>Monkey Pocky Boo</i>, Sharrock avoided the instrument that he reinvented for the free jazz genre,
    instead reaching for the, uh... slide whistle for half of side one.</p><p>
<i>Paradise</i> was released five years later, and it headed
    straight for the cutout bins, rarely even filed under the ""jazz"" section in record stores. Looking like a
    disco-diva record, it came at a time when George Benson and Chuck Mangione were what ""jazz"" sounded like.
    And while the free and furious improvising of Sharrock's past two records could arguably not be called jazz,
    either, this time around the Sharrocks did away with their own history, as well as that of the genre, letting
    out something that defiantly remains unclassifiable and as outside of human time as that oft-idealized
    Paradise itself.</p><p>
    Taking their cue from modern R&amp;B; radio and slick funk, ""Apollo"" commences with a dusted Diana Ross-like
    sighing before Linda decides to have a deep-throating contest, taking the mic far down her gullet for some
    gurgling. Meanwhile, the backing band starts acting like a zooted Gap Band before morphing into a prog band
    midway through, escalating into the upper registers of the synth. Sonny Sharrock starts off with a jubilant,
    almost African guitar tone, but then performs some positively dripping primordial No-Wave slobber in
    endlessly cascading/ascending guitar lines that slurp and go just far enough out, setting the table for
    the next 20 years of New York guitarists-- right up to Sonic Youth's shredding on ""100%"". By the time
    Linda's punched back into the track, with her salving vocal sighs and soft instrumental bedding, the crazy
    jag that just occurred is all but forgotten.</p><p>
    Producer (and noted tape composer in his own right) Ilhan Mimaroglu has a definite hand here in mashing
    the disparate strands of ""Apollo"" together, somewhere between his graceful massaging of the exotic jungle
    into the hairy back of Mingus' <i>Cumbia &amp; Jazz Fusion</i> and his political acid-trip tape-splicing frenzy
    of Freddie Hubbard's <i>Sing a Song of Song My</i>, but it still makes little sense in the overall scheme of
    things, a belle confusion.</p><p>
    Continuing the schizophrenic oscillations between barbed Ono-outburst and velvety vowel abstraction is the
    beautiful respite of ""End of the Rainbow"", where Linda's wordless serenity swirls with washes of cymbals.
    The concord doesn't remain for long-- ""Miss Doris"" comes along clanking cowbells and timbales that bleed
    into a clavinet quiver.  The sound quickly reaches g-funk frequencies as piercing as the continued caterwauls
    of the Missus, which go to that unholy place between Diamanda Galas and Curly of the Three Stooges. For more
    glottal oddities, she turns her lingua into a wah pedal on ""1953 Blue Boogie Children"", mixing Mellotron
    with Morse code as Sonny alternates channels of ping and pulverization brilliantly. The climax comes with
    the closer, ""Gary's Step"", which continually crescendos and then levitates even higher into the stratosphere
    for eight minutes, invoking the Ecclesiastics of classic free jazz's soulful wail, the one such piece that
    harkens to their past.</p><p>
    This is a strain of funk far from that of the Mothership, or even the tumultuous punched-in lurch of Miles'
    <i>On the Corner</i>. It's somewhat like the proto no-wave achieved on Yoko Ono's <i>Plastic Ono Band</i>,
    combining Yin yips with hubby's masculine string malevolence over a rock-solid rhythmic pulse. No matter
    how much gibberish is splattered about by the couple, the bass and drums chugs along intact, greasing the
    broken chunks of tongue and guitar so that it's easier to swallow down. A quarter of a century on, <i>Paradise</i>
    is coming to be delectably digestible.</p></div>"|7101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7101-paradise/|7.9|Andy Beta

    sorely needed joy into the indie scene, but these spirited lads more than just stand to be
    counted. Primary songwriter Tony Carbone takes his cues from most of the same resuscitated sources
    as his peers-- namely Brian Wilson, Arthur Lee, and The Beatles-- but he and his bandmates pull
    it off with such enthusiasm and invention, it's hard to pay any mind to critics who'll cavil
    endlessly about a lack of originality.</p><p>
    
    Like any true power-poppers, Bikeride wink at their source material before offering their take:
    Does ""Sleepyhead"" sound like ""Eleanor Rigby"" after a few Mountain Dews?  Certainly, but if
    you like The Beatles and high-caffeine beverages, why not imbibe of both.  ""Small Faces"", a
    nod to the mod gods, pays tribute without slavish or academic recreation.  Fans of power-pop
    tend to accept this sort of conservatism from their favorite bands, but Bikeride should play to
    wider audiences, even lure away a handful of the jaded critics sneering, ""Teenage Fanclub was
    <i>such</i> a Big Star rip-off,"" and, ""Evan Dando, what a necrophiliac stoner.""</p><p>
    
    Carbone takes real risks with his writing while the band adds an unmistakable flavor of modernism
    without letting their ironic detachment drown out the ingenuous excitement. It's a good thing,
    too, because Carbone's irreverence toward standard structure could easily have led down a path
    that should have come to an end a few years ago, somewhere in the emotional wasteland of Beck's
    <i>Midnite Vultures</i>. As it stands, the daring ""Fakin' Amnesia"", ""Norwegia"", and several others
    come across as pure fun, a bravado balancing act that's all the more thrilling for how close it
    comes to falling apart. ""Lemonade"" and a minority of other tracks occasionally take wrong turns
    into booby traps like lounge jazz, but that's the price of forsaking comfort and predictability.</p><p>
    
    No matter how much style and imagination Carbone &amp; Co. exhibit, some will inevitably dismiss it from
    the start. Carbone sings in a voice that few others could achieve without the aid of helium or
    neutering, an admittedly difficult sound to absorb for long stretches of time.  This is the most
    damning piece of evidence for the case that Bikeride is simply too cute to tolerate, but complaints
    will probably extend to other areas. The twists and turns featured so prominently on nearly every
    song will surely strike some ears as forced experimentalism, but if you're too embarrassed to buy
    an Electric Light Orchestra record after humming ""Mr. Blue Sky"" as it slid by in that Volkswagen
    commercial, you should find <i>Morning Macumba</i> a less humiliating alternative.</p></div>"|693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/693-morning-macumba/|7.9|Brian James

I mean, naturally, people made
    good music at every point in history, but at present, more and more musicians are dredging up
    the recent past (new wave, electro, garage) and expecting to haul up gold.  So, when the results
    of their wholesale extirpation turn out mixed, we're forced to admit that either a) the past
    wasn't up to snuff after all, or b) nostalgia isn't what it used to be.</p><p>
    
    Chicago's Boas seem to think that by digging deeper than most bands, they have a shot at striking
    the golden vein, but they often disagree on how far back to reach.  There's a bit of sappy orchestral
    pop in their mix, some vintage organ sounds here and there, a lot of languid C&amp;W; picking, and above all,
    John Klos' sick-of-his-own-soul yowl, begging to be wrapped in static.  It could be they get teary-eyed
    for mid-90s indie, with the meandering start/stoppage and often obtuse refusal to rock in any
    straightforward way.  But however you want to describe their sound, it's all very intentional, and
    referentially ""old.""</p><p>
    
    Boas come off like fairly competent young dudes with an ear for a lazy melody, on whom old age has been
    suddenly and painfully self-inflicted. Sometimes they profit from their wealth of influences: A song as
    exhaustedly sprawling as the piano-fueled shuffle ""The Last Zoo House Band"" covers so much territory,
    it's bound to hit something good eventually (the horn coda at its end). Often, though, the songs are
    too broken down to crawl toward any sort of significance: ""Ghetto Pond"" doesn't have the energy to
    make Klos' gargled non-sequitirs and stark declarations of, ""Ain't nothin' not special no more,"" seem
    anything more than hollow; ""Get Up, Crippled Wife"" lacks the strength to break through its fog of
    synthesizers.  Good or bad, Boas seem like they've been coated with an impenetrably thick layer of
    dust.</p><p>
    
    It's not really clear why Boas want to engage in this sort of cover-up; when the outlines of
    real songs start to show at the end of the album, I like the pretty young things I see.  ""Mrs.
    Mother"" dispels the pall with a burst of wistfully playful pop, while ""For Sheriff Allison"" trades
    in affected age for unstrained, deceptively simple folk.  Finally, on ""Oh, Doctor"", the band's
    scattered <i>Wowee Zowee</i>-isms congeal into raucous, joyfully overdriven axe-thwacking.  But
    just when they're really getting going, the album ends, its best songs buried behind a stack of
    less vital, less engaging material.  Still, it's not every day that you get to watch years roll
    back right in front of your eyes; if time keeps on running in the wrong direction for Boas, they

    like V2 give Moby the green light to crap out opportunistic schlock like <i>18</i>, while simultaneously
    cutting loose a band as talented and unique as 12 Rods?  I mean, okay, the Rods' last product for V2, the
    ass-Rundgren'd <i>Separation Anxieties</i>, was a complete disaster from any angle, failing to satisfy
    the band's devoted fanbase and completely tanking on a commercial level.  But isn't there something to
    be said for sticking behind bands with artistic merit, bands with the potential for greatness?</p><p>
    
    Sad, but true: In the end, the age-old struggle of quantity versus quality (or lack thereof) is the simplest
    explanation for this seeming judgmental error, and 12 Rods had to take the fall.  Fortunately, the karmic
    scales are being righted even now.  Though this band no longer has the resources and backing necessary to
    move the kind of volume an operation like V2 could provide, <i>Lost Time</i> is rich in quality, and if
    self-releasing the record is what it takes to get the boys back on track, so be it.</p><p>
    
    Bear in mind now that unlike some people, I wouldn't have you believe that <i>Gay?</i> was the sound of God's
    orgasm, nor did I find <i>Separation Anxieties</i> quite as terrible as it's sometimes made out to be.  It
    seems to me that, on their previous outings, 12 Rods have served as a balancing act of sorts, combining
    a bewildering array of desultory styles and influences, sometimes successful and sometimes not.  Their
    full-length debut, <i>Split Personalities</i>, nailed the ratio of spacy, synth-driven lounge jazz to
    sharp-toothed arena-pop, and when it was on, it was both incredibly original and stunningly catchy. <i>Lost
    Time</i> is that record's proper follow-up.</p><p>
    
    Here, 12 Rods juggle slow grooves, killer hooks, and stop/start
    changes with the same practiced ease that endeared them to so many in the first place.  The manic, metallic
    sheen of <i>Anxieties</i> has been subdued and replaced with more of the organic production that marked
    <i>Gay?</i>, albeit of much higher fidelity.  But most importantly, the band has rebounded from the
    uneasiness of <i>Separation Anxieties</i> to actually sound comfortable with their material again.</p><p>
    
    The tempo and mood of <i>Lost Time</i> change with virtually every song.  The glitchy, slow-burning harmonies
    of ""Fake Magic 8-Ball"" dissolve seamlessly into a tower of guitar and complex rhythmic shifts to open
    ""Twenty-Four Hours Ago""; trilling keyboards segue the bouncing power-punk of ""Terrible Hands"" into the
    laidback stadium rocker, ""The Time Is Right (To Be Wrong)"".  12 Rods can't seem to sit still long enough
    to commit themselves to any one monolithic sound, so they simply bend every atmosphere they create to their
    own inventive aesthetic.  The result is entirely natural; nothing is out of place, nothing is overdone.</p><p>
    
    A significant portion of the credit for <i>Lost Time</i>'s paradoxical feeling of simultaneous unity and
    diversity can be attributed to Ryan Olcott's vocals; his slickly treated delivery shows chameleon-like
    adaptability across all of this album's varied terrain.  He croons, shouts and wails with equal proficiency,
    maintaining the record's remarkable pace without losing so much as a step.  In fact, in many ways, <i>Lost
    Time</i>'s consistency even gives it an edge over <i>Split Personalities</i>.</p><p>
    
    Now, admittedly, consistency often amounts to little more than a critical consolation prize in the art of
    album-building, something to be trotted out when other defenses fail to justify quality (""But, at least it's
    consistent!"").  Not this time.  <i>Lost Time</i> is an exceptional start-to-finish listening experience, and
    on top of that, it hits as high as, or higher than, any Rods album to come before, minus any of the awkwardness
    that occasionally accompanied earlier releases.  In short, <i>Lost Time</i> brings 12 Rods back from the
    brink of irrelevance to thrive outside the corporate clutches of V2, and shows them poised to finally
    deliver on the promise of the early material they built their name on.</p></div>"|8202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8202-lost-time/|8.1|Eric Carr

    in gauze-like overdubs, each one softer than last.  Plus, it was recorded at home, which can often pull an
    album down from ""slowcore"" to ""nubby gray pajamacore.""  But while Jessica Bailiff's third record relies
    heavily on atmosphere, the sharp execution makes it work: With good songs and inventive arrangements, she
    made the album taut and precise, turning simple elements into well-realized mood pieces.</p><p>
    
    Plus, her voice is beautiful.  Restrained and almost expressionlessly consistent, it shimmers whether laid
    flat over an acoustic guitar or treated to sound far off, like... well, if you've ever had the ghost of a
    young girl stuck in your plumbing, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Bailiff's words help with the
    spooking, too, with lines like, ""I heard you creeping under the bed,"" or the eerie way she floats the word,
    ""disappear.""</p><p>
    
    The mood of this record doesn't waver, but the arrangements keep things interesting.  After recording her
    first two albums with assistance from Low, Bailiff made this one with her Red Morning Chorus bandmates, Jesse
    Edwards and Noel Keesee, providing unspecified help on the instruments that buzz, drone and beat behind her
    voice.  They provide enough variety between the songs without overwhelming any one track: Each one comes out
    stark and minimal.  Take ""Hour of the Traces"" (the title of which, curiously, is a variation on the title of
    her previous full-length), which starts with low handdrums playing a rhythm that echoes Native American music.
    Gradually, she adds piercing long notes from a ""violin-uke"" (a weird, bowed tabletop instrument that arcs
    over her chanting vocals), and an almost-subliminal, serpentine bass guitar to wind underneath.</p><p>
    
    ""Disappear"" takes a similar beat but adds an electric drone, possibly from a guitar, and on ""Big Hill"" a
    string-like sound pans and vibrates slowly around her voice like a bug.  The droning may not work for all
    listeners-- you might get a little round-eyed when she sings a dazed, one-note melody throughout ""You Were So
    Close"".  But it's not all dust bowls and dry chills: The first track, ""Swallowed"", splurges on a piano and
    ringing strummed guitar.  It even has a hummable melody, as does ""Mary"", the liveliest of her mournful
    dirges.</p><p>
    
    This album can't avoid the dilemma where it may be too foggy for some listeners, yet without so much focus
    we couldn't dig so deeply into the wide plains and dead, gnarled tree roots of Bailiff's head.  She solves
    the problem better than most with the edgy instrumentation, not to mention that voice, which, with or without
    effects, is captivating.  With this release, Bailiff has made her first deeply intimate and intriguingly
    rendered full-length.  With any luck, it gets even better from here.</p></div>"|533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/533-jessica-bailiff/|7.3|Chris Dahlen

    on the ocean floor, the offspring of slaves drowned in transatlantic
    crossings, they've left the earthly realm for a voyage into deep space.
    <em>Grava 4</em> is one of the seven ""storms"" recorded as part of a cryptic
    plan that was to bring Detroit's Drexciya to its next stage of development
    (a project that founding member James Stinson sadly did not live to see
    completed-- he died last year), and the explicit theme on this record is
    celestial travel.  Track titles like ""Astronomical Guidepost"" and ""700 Light
    Years from Earth"" combined with a sleeve that maps the tracks onto a map of
    some distant planet's night sky help set the mood, but the music sticks
    closely to the established Drexciya sound, which happens to adapt quite
    well to a space motif.</p><p>
    ""Cascading Celestial Giants"" eases us into this cold, barren world with
    a recurring sample of a men's chorus, the kind of sequenced bleeps that
    planetariums played between shows in the early 70s, and a sweeping synth
    melody that announces, ""You are embarking on a journey..."" It's melodramatic
    as hell, but in the best possible way, introducing the album with a
    theatrical flair. The following ""Powers of the Deep"" is a good example of
    what I'm loving about Drexciya: how each of a track's individual elements
    seems so discrete and separate, and yet somehow it all congeals into a
    listenable whole.</p><p>
    The percussion is stiff as ever; drum machines in this world are meant to
    dispassionately scoop endless units of time from the universe. There are no
    breaks, no fills, little syncopation, and the beats rarely drop out. But in
    and around the unforgiving techno and electro beats, electronic sounds swirl
    unpredictably. In contrast to the most machine-like beats imaginable, the
    synths in Drexciya often show a human hand at the switch. The surges in volume
    and odd filters don't seem applied by an unthinking algorithm; the patterns
    seem too well timed to fit the arc of the track, to be controlled by anything
    but a brain.
    </p><p>
    This contrast and complement between man and machine, where the purpose of
    each in the music seems so clear, is part of what makes Drexciya so special.
    Diego Rivera painted a series of murals in the 1930s, known as the ""Detroit
    Industry"" murals, the most famous of which captures something similar to what
    Drexciya seem to have gone for.  It portrays a massive factory scene, with
    dozens of men working in and around all-consuming machinery, and the way it's
    painted, it's hard to tell where the machines leave off and the people begin.
    The line from the steel edge of a blast furnace merges gracefully into the back
    of the man shoveling fuel into the belly.
    </p>
<p>
    Sonically, a brittle, aggressive tone presides through much of <em>Grava 4</em>.
    On the fourth track (which might be titled ""Grava"" but isn't listed on the
    sleeve) everything is overdriven and harsh, from the gurgly Speak'n'Spell
    pattern out front to the relentless banging happening in the background
    somewhere. The ""thwack"" of the beats on ""Drexcyen R.E.S.T. Principle"" feel
    like a slap across the face, and the menacing vibe is not allayed by the
    stalking, angry bass pattern.
    </p>
<p>
    There's occasional lightness-- ""700 Million
    Light Years from Earth"" is a nice slice of the kind of warm, downtempo
    electro found on <em>Lifestyle of the Laptop Cafe</em>, a project recorded
    for Warp Records by members of Drexciya under the guise The Other People
    Place-- but darkness is pretty much the rule. Life on earth is ugly, and
    escape from the depths of the ocean into the heavens turned out to be no
    escape at all, but at least Drexciya got to tell us about it.

    may find a subtle theme. ""Room for Mistakes"", ""Mistakes"", and ""You Took Your Mistakes Too Hard"" all indicate
    an interest in mistakes, and the title of the album only confirms that concern.  Others, like ""An Accident"",
    ""Wreck"", ""All the Black Days 1"", and ""All the Black Days 2"", branch off in subtle ways from the main thesis
    to announce in no uncertain terms that this record is positively sadcore.</p><p>
    
    Though their lineup has expanded since 2001's <i>The Dissolving Room</i> to include Angels of Light
    percussionist Thor Harris and ex-Glass Eye frontman/Dead Milkmen producer Brian Beattie, Shearwater is
    still primarily the side project of Okkervil River's Will Sheff and Jonathan Meiburg.  But this album
    boasts a much fuller sound than their last, due in no small part to their new contributors. <i>Everybody
    Makes Mistakes</i> broadens the band's sonic palate beyond the Leonard Cohen/Nick Drake school's timeworn
    standbys of acoustic guitars and pianos by incorporating vibes, accordions, glockenspiels, and organs
    (amongst other instrumentation), with which they weave together plenty of interesting textures-- the chords
    they use never sound slapped together, showing some real care and intelligence. ""Well, Benjamin"" and
    ""Mistakes"" even have some honest-to-God bounce, a nearly astonishing ingredient in an album like this.</p><p>
    
    It becomes frustratingly obvious as the record plays, however, that the musical accompaniment is designed
    to be just that. Shearwater has a better sense of craft than their moping contemporaries, but their lyrics
    still stand front and center, with genre cliches doing most of the talking.  Most of these songs sound like
    conversations the pair were too introverted to ever have, and usually express either a deep inner torment
    to a friend/lover, or analyzing a deep inner torment of a friend/lover <i>to</i> that friend/lover in the
    voice of one who knows how it feels and how to make it better.</p><p>
    
    Take, for example, the following lines from ""Soon"": ""When no one else would suffer me, I threw myself at
    your ankles/ 'He treats his friends like customers, he treats me like a given,' your letter read/ 'Come
    down,' you said, 'And let me know I'm living.'"" It's hard not to wish the musical garnish would overwhelm
    the main course when the latter consists of such attempts to appear as wretchedly sensitive as this.  Which
    is too bad for Sheff, as occasionally he sounds like he's got some spark in him.  The same can't be said
    for Meiburg, however, whose lyrics and delivery are frustratingly dull.</p><p>
    
    This kind of melodramatic navelgazing grows overly demanding at LP length to anyone not cemented in a similar
    mood, making <i>Everybody Makes Mistakes</i> ultimately too depressing for its own good.  Of course, listeners
    who don't mind such emotional monotony-- surely, there are some who actively enjoy it-- can find a lot to
    like in the material Shearwater crowds to the back.  As for me, the self-pity is all a bit too much.</p></div>"|7102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7102-everybody-makes-mistakes/|6.5|Brian James

For those unfamiliar with Gang of Four's     discography, let me first explain: This reissue compiles the band's second and fourth albums     onto one disc, in reverse chronological order.  I wish I could say its failings were     predominantly linear, but the cruelty of this juxtaposition runs much, much deeper.</p>
<p>Gang of Four's initial artistic trajectory (pre-reunions) can best be defined as tragic.     They announced themselves to the world in 1979 with <i>Entertainment!</i>, one of the best     debut albums ever released, and a powerful statement, encapsulating radical politics in a     supreme assembly of accessible, Spartan punk-funk; it almost single-handedly gave birth to     the post-punk aesthetic still widely mined today.  The original lineup went on to record     <i>Solid Gold</i> and the <i>Another Day/Another Dollar</i> EP, which both count as towering     releases in their own right.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the band's material suffered as their lineup shifted; the departure of bassist     Dave Allen, who went on to form Shriekback with former XTC keyboardist Barry Andrews, fundamentally     changed Gang of Four's dynamic on their third LP, <i>Songs of the Free</i>.  That album still has     some classic moments, but it's far less incisive than either of their first two albums, and the     rhythmic intensity that drove the band early on was all but lost.  No disrespect to ace bassist     Sara Lee, but she was no replacement for Allen, whose style was far more direct.  Next to go was     drummer Hugo Burnham, which left only Jon King and Andy Gill to create the band's final studio     album in their first wave of work, <i>Hard</i>, which relied heavily on drum programming.</p>
<p>In light of where the band started out, <i>Hard</i> wasn't just a letdown, it was an outright     travesty.  The would-be ironic title wound up a joke King and Gill played on themselves; in     execution and content, the album is anything but its namesake.  The female backing vocalists     who open the album chanting, ""Is it love?"" are so overproduced, they sound practically synthesized,     and the drum programming is straight-up Oingo Boingo.  But the <i>really</i> sad thing about     <i>Hard</i> is that it seems a blatant attempt to sell out.</p>
<p><i>Hard</i> does offer one or two decent moments, mostly hip-swinging grooves and Gill's guitar parts;     Andy Gill was such a unique guitarist to begin with, it's no surprise his contributions are still     fresh, even as he backed away from the slashing, confrontational style he made his name on.  King     doesn't fare nearly as well: He comes off sounding utterly disinterested at almost every turn,     the urgency of his old, oft-imitated declamatory style completely lost, as he allows himself to     become a conventional singer.</p>
<p>About the only thing I can say for the folks at Wounded Bird is they at least distinctly separated     the two albums, making it easy to skip straight to <i>Solid Gold</i>.  Listening to the whole disc     straight through, the transition between these records couldn't be more jarring, as the ultraslick     pop of ""Independence"" is wiped clear aside by ""Paralyzed"", with its sputtering slow-motion funk     and eerie spoken vocals.  The intense grind of ""What We All Want"", the sheer propulsive force of     ""Outside the Trains Don't Run on Time"", and the wry, anti-consumerist humor of ""Cheeseburger"" paint     a vastly different picture of the band that went on to record <i>Hard</i>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's extremely difficult to recommend a disc like this, but I can't give it a full     thumbs down: <i>Solid Gold</i> is a canonical record, and for anyone with even a passing interest     in the post-punk era, it's a must-own.  Unfortunately, the comprehensive Infinite Zero reissue     from 1995-- which appended the classic (and concurrent) <i>Another Day/Another Dollar</i> EP--     is out of print and uncommon in used bins (I won't be selling my copy anytime soon).  Why that     disc couldn't have been reissued intact is beyond me.</p>
<p>Regardless, there's no real reason a disaster like <i>Hard</i> needs to be on the market while     the band's definining moment, <i>Entertainment!</i>, remains out of print; presumedly, Wounded     Bird couldn't afford the rights to issue that record, or chose to stretch the return on <i>Hard</i> by affixing it to one worth buying.  It would have made more sense to pair <i>Hard</i> with     <i>Songs of the Free</i>-- they're more stylistically similar, and the latter is also out of     print-- but obviously that would hurt sales.  If this is your only means of owning <i>Solid     Gold</i>, you have to buy it, but exhaust other possibilities first, as <i>Hard</i> is nothing     more than a grotesque exhibition of a once-great band on its last legs.</p></div>"|3387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3387-hardsolid-gold/|3.8|Joe Tangari

Sure, there were the countless nights spent listening
    only to ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"", the apparent one-off collaboration between Death Cab for
    Cutie's Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello that served as the brilliant centerpiece of Dntel's <i>Life Is
    Full of Possibilities</i>.  And there were my frequent, semi-coherent rants about how ""Evan and Chan"" was
    not only one of the best songs of 2001, but perhaps the perfect synthesis of IDM production and indie pop
    songwriting.  The thought of further collaboration between Tamborello and Gibbard, however, never crossed
    my mind, so when I heard last year that they were collaborating on another single, I shit a brick-- and
    when it was later revealed that the single had evolved into a full-length album, I practically shit a
    whole firehouse.</p><p>
    
    First, the bad news: <i>Give Up</i> doesn't offer 45 solid minutes of the same wholesale excellence that
    appeared in condensed form on ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan""; if anything, the album's occasional
    missteps serve to elucidate what exactly made the first collaboration between Tamborello and Gibbard so
    effective.  Still, the core tension between Tamborello's intricate production and Gibbard's cutting voice
    makes <i>Give Up</i> a pretty damned strong record, and one with enough transcendent moments to forgive it
    its few substandard tracks and ungodly lyrical blunders.</p><p>
    
    Tamborello and Gibbard put their best foot forward with ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"", which
    exemplifies the two best elements of this entire collaboration: contrast and subtlety.  Here, Gibbard's
    vocal melody and Tamborello's instrumentation build independently to a perfectly orchestrated emotional
    climax, replete with hiss-laden sampled strings and ethereal background vocals.  There's a noticeable
    clash between Gibbard's emotive singing and the upbeat drum machine line that drives the track's second
    half, but Tamborello's production is loaded with enough warm, melodic instrumentation to provide a
    surprisingly apt background for Gibbard's sincere tenor.  The song also benefits from possessing some
    of the album's stronger lyrics.</p><p>
    
    ""Such Great Heights"", the album's debut single, offers <i>Give Up</i>'s strongest melody, but its lyrical
    parallels to N'Sync's ""God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You"" make it just a bit hard to swallow.
    It hurts me to hear the words, ""I am thinking it's a sign/ That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images/
    And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned,"" sung to such a unique and riveting melody.  Of course, the
    song is a fine work of literature compared to ""Sleeping In"", which claims the record's most thoroughly
    cringe-worthy lines: ""Last night I had the strangest dream/ Where everything was exactly how it seemed/
    Where there was never any mystery/ About who shot John F. Kennedy.""  I realize there were probably some
    time constraints, but the vivid and intriguing lyrics of ""Evan and Chan"" proved Gibbard capable of much,
    much better than ""I want so badly to believe that there is truth and love is real.""</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, <i>Give Up</i> overcomes its highly questionable lyrical choices, and the sometimes painful
    duets between Gibbard and indie folkster Jen Wood, purely on the strength of Gibbard's consistently strong
    melodies, which carry far greater impact in the context of Tamborello's hyperactive electro-pop than they
    have on recent Death Cab for Cutie releases.  And Tamborello's production gives the intricate precision of
    <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i> a caffeinated overhaul, here forsaking the time-honored glitch of that
    album for bright, danceable beats.  While it may be impressive that the unified and cohesive vision of
    <i>Give Up</i> was the result of a <i>par avion</i> collaboration, it's anything but surprising given the
    talent behind it and the immense chemistry shared by these two musicians.</p></div>"|6432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6432-give-up/|8.0|Matt LeMay

    forms of mental illness.  As the voice of Minneapolis thrashers The Cows, he managed to swing requisite
    menace and a disarmingly arch, lowbrow wit at the same time, leveling both barrels at the oozing
    backalley/trailerpark underbelly of life.  The ugly version of Americana Selberg wallowed in
    always used to strike me as a bit too extreme to represent reality (which, of course, was
    most of the fun); however, since the Cows split up, it seems like Selberg and America have been
    on the same road.</p><p>
    
    Take the first track on the second full-length from Selberg's first post-Cows project: ""Army Brat""
    doesn't just nail the zeitgeist, it knocks it up and refuses to pay child support.  Selberg hawks
    up lines like ""I am an army brat/ My dick's a baseball bat/ That oil's gotta flow/ Cuz I say so, so
    so!"" with utterly convincing belligerence, while ex-Swans/Foetus guitarist Norman Westberg crunches
    away like a T.Rex with a mouthful of Grape Nuts.  As with everything Selberg's ever articulated
    in galvanic ultra-scumbag mode, you get the feeling he's either completely messing with you or
    sneaking up from behind with a loaded shotgun in his sweaty hands!  If you laugh along with the
    song, you're aligning yourself with this maniac; if you ignore it, you're missing the point.
    Which puts it-- along with the Dead Kennedys' ""Kill the Poor""-- in the ranks of the best sarcastic
    protest songs.  But still: Shannon Selberg?  A conscience?</p><p>
    
    Maybe not.  All this newfound relevance doesn't imply that he's actually changed-- not for the
    better, at least.  The Cows' concept of artistic development mainly involved learning to play
    their instruments; once they could claim some success on that front, they proceeded to tear down
    whatever they'd accomplished with a snowballing sense of self-parody a hell of a lot funnier
    than most.  True to Selberg's primitivist intentions, it kept ""art"" at a safe distance.  You'd
    think, though, that with a fresh start in a promising new band-- Westberg is ample replacement for
    Cows axeman Thor Eisentrager (minus the kickass rock name), and the John Fell/Eric Eble rhythmic
    axis is just as evil-- they wouldn't have that much to parody; they certainly don't have to lay
    it on this thick.  And while the Heroine Sheiks still have a lot of things going for them,
    Selberg's recent keyboard fixation isn't one of them: When he's playing it like an actual
    instrument, as on the creeping noir narrative ""Grab the Wheel"", and during the frighteningly
    visceral pop violence of ""Open You Up"", it's good enough for flavor.  As a noisemaker, though,
    it often sounds like a lump of plastic tossed around on the ocean of real skronk the Sheiks
    muster elsewhere.</p><p>
    
    While the band's leanings toward novelty actually complement some of the songs-- well-placed
    bicycle bells push their nigh-impossibly sleazy cover of Sonny Boy Williamson's ""Good Morning Little
    Schoolgirl"" into twilight-zone pedophilia-- they just as often take the edge off of Selberg's ferocity.
    The album's redneck-baiting final track, ""Mas Suicide"", has the makings of another sarcastic classic:
    Selberg growls ""My life's a shotgun/ Without a sight""; arguments over ""Freebird"" escalate to homicide,
    etc.  However, after a couple of wheezing synth interludes and unfortunate monkey-hoots from Selberg,
    the song loses enough of its razor focus to fade into another simple joke.  Maybe it's just that
    over the past few years I've become desensitized by the flood of junk culture, but where Selberg
    once distinguished himself by perpetually sinking lower than America, in 2003, Uncle Sam's finally
    caught up.</p></div>"|3837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3837-siamese-pipe/|6.7|Brendan Reid

His work is, in a grand sense, about the mass proliferation of sound     in our lives, the morbidity of our culture's regurgitation and recycling of aesthetics, and of course, a     fundamental disagreement with thoughtless complacency.</p><p>The very essence of this-- the need to represent, or in some way possess the constant influx of     cultural trash-- merits Merzbow's rigorous release schedule. Even at their most aurally identical,     each release is a different approach to Merzbow's preoccupations, be it bondage (which, for those     who thought Merzbow was a one-trick pony, seems to be mysteriously absent in his work as of late),     or jazz drumming. In the past 25 years, it's pretty doubtless that these releases have finally started     to epitomize that endless cultural subconscious that Merzbow set out to recreate.</p>
<p>Yet, describing this work in strictly academic or critical language undermines the sheer     velocity and disruption a listener might feel, having never heard anything along these lines before.     No Merzbow fan will ever be able to relive that initial shock, torment, and displeasure, that moral     incongruence, or the satisfaction that someone finally took that extra step they always     anticipated. At least not until they stumble onto Whitehouse.</p>
<p>Warp Records have just released a new Merzbow record. Not to be filed under Merzbow proper, it's     attributed to Merzbow's human incarnation, Masami Akita, who appears here alongside equally disruptive     experimentalist Russell Haswell.  Due to labelmates like Aphex Twin and Squarepusher, this will be     the most widely distributed Merzbow album. Whether or not you're looking for a place to start,     <em>Satanstornade</em> will be the one in your local record store.</p>
<p>Perhaps there's been a climate change; maybe those pissed-off rap-rock kids in bubble coats are going     to get even angrier when they get drafted. Maybe they'll need something more substantial to pump     out of their subwoofers while they do figure-eights in a mall parking lot. Hell, Merzbow     isn't that inaccessible: There are basslines looping back and forth all through the album. In fact,     the most emblematic feature of Merzbow's noise music of the past decade or so is the fact that he's     largely abandoned the random household noise of his earliest experiments, as well as the tape-collage     work it evolved into.  The precipitous, unabashed searing rushes that followed-- and settled--     after some experimentation headed, in the past five years, toward the use of underlying     loops.</p>
<p>Maybe it has to do with his decision to integrate a laptop into what used to be such distinctly     physical musical method, or maybe it's just another view into the way our cultural waste works.     All of those albums released and recorded, all of the television, sharing the same general content,     day in and day out, lulling in its calculated directness. Or maybe it's just that all of that     trademarked feedback is just a tiny loop anyway, being picked up by a microphone which sends it     to speakers that send it to the microphone, over and over again.</p>
<p>Whatever is emblematic of Merzbow's work in and of itself has been offset fairly recently by his     newfound enthusiasm for collaboration. Not that there weren't traces of it earlier in his work,     but Zbigniew Karkowski, Ladybird, Kouhei Matsunaga, Otomo Yoshihide, and now, finally released--     despite being several years old-- a collaboration with Russell Haswell have come to be a major     factor in deciphering Merzbow's work.</p>
<p>Merzbow's conceptual approach and aesthetics seem to     dominate any situation heenters, however. Junk, waste, the violent cascades of sound, are mixed     with Haswell's particularly digital-based aesthetics. The sounds of CD errors, binary yelps, and     tinny crunches barrage Merzbow's typical noisy landscape. Considering Haswell's <em>Live Salvage:     1997-2000</em> collection on MEGO, perhaps it's not even a question of Merzbow battling for     dominance, but rather two artists reaching for similar territory.</p>
<p><em>Live Salvage</em> had a twist somewhat absent from Merzbow's work, though. There was a sense     of location-specificity, a keen ability to integrate the physical, concrete nature of his noise into     the space he was playing it in. Haswell has been looking for new ground after people like     Merzbow have already staked their claims, and to shy away from a collaborative effort with such a     central figure would've been absurd. Unfortunately, two men brandishing their laptops in public     seems a little bit weak, a bit too hasty for either artist to make much of a dent. It's     not a failure-- it fits neatly into Merzbow'slongstanding theories, and even serves as a bit of a     challenge for him considering the collaborative aspect-- but the promise of Haswell's creativity     is too quickly usurped. Hopefully this collaboration will be a bit more than a one-off, and the     two can find a stronger equilibrium.</p>

Chock-full of worthless style-first bands, the whole phenomenon has left me cold from the get-go-- partially because my definition of rock isn't entirely confined to the <em>Nuggets</em> box.  It's not that I don't like rock; I just prefer it to be motivated more by passion than retro fetishism.</p><p>  Exhibit A: My love for Ted Leo, the man who perhaps most embodies any kind of Jesus act rock 'n' roll still has left in it.  He's one of the few guitar slingers I'll still go to bat for, and not just because he hails from the same city-district in which I make my residence.  Shunning standard-issue hipster influences like the Velvets and The Stooges in favor of didn't-know-they-were-supposed-to-be-good bands like Thin Lizzy and Dexys Midnight Runners, Leo wields his two specialty instruments-- manic guitar and maniac voice-- with unbridled enthusiasm.  Note the lack of studied posturing.</p><p>  So, naturally, I've been thrilled this year to see one of my favorite incredibly short people enthused over in the pages of <em>Spin</em> and <em>Alternative Press</em> for his new record, <em>Hearts of Oak</em>-- almost as thrilled as I am to write about him personally.  But my critical duties compel me to point out that <em>Hearts of Oak</em> is a few steps off the pace of Leo's previous album, <em>The Tyranny of Distance</em>, an album so good it makes me want to commit that ultimate indie sin and preach that if Everyone Had Heard It, It Would've Been a Nationwide Top 10 for Sure.  Freeing Leo's sound from the punk constraints of his former band, Chisel, and the experimental dub leanings of his pretty much unlistenable debut <em>Rx/Pharmacists</em>, <em>Tyranny</em> was, put simply, thee rock album of 2001, Strokes and Stripes be damned.</p><p>  For such a drooling fanboy as I, <em>Hearts of Oak</em> almost can't help being a step down, but thankfully, it's a nearly imperceptible one.  Leo mostly sticks to <em>Tyranny</em>'s formula, playing to his strengths with only minor alterations.  Most notably, Leo reveals a deeper fascination with all things percussive-- rarely does a track <em>not</em> feature noisemakers or tambourines rattling around somewhere in the mix. The head Pharmacist still pulls combustible pop songs like ""The Anointed One"" and ""2nd Ave., 11 A.M."" out of every orifice with apparent effortlessness, and each is coated in a Krispy Kreme-like glaze of sale items from Maracas Plus.</p><p>  This approach culminates in the album's centerpiece, ""The Ballad of the Sin Eater"", where the only things not being shaken or hit with sticks are the bassline and Leo's vocal cords.  Like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" on methamphetamines, Leo speak-sings a tale of traveling the world with American guilt (""you didn't think they could HATE ya now, didja?!"").  It doesn't pack the wallop of the live version, already known to throw out the backs of the unprepared, but even the recorded version steals my attention away from whatever form of entertainment I'm simultasking.</p><p>  Elsewhere, Leo takes a more traditional route, quaffing liberally from barrels of big riffs and catchy hooks.  Not-a-Paula-Cole-parody ""Where Have All the Rude Boys Gone?"" eulogizes The Specials as Leo unhinges his voice like a snake swallowing a rabbit, caterwauling, ""Foo-awoo-awoo-awoo-awoo-LESH!!"" at the unconverted.  And through it all, his revolving-door crew of Pharmacists sound anything but transitory, even slipping into a convincing Booker T. &amp; The MG's groove on the Boston-referencing ""Bridges, Squares"".</p><p>  Yet, as I said, I still find <em>Hearts of Oak</em> to be a slight sidewalk trip from <em>The Tyranny of Distance</em>, so let's just get my complaints out of the way now, shooting gallery-style.  ""Dead Voices"" is the first time I've ever heard Leo's pipes fail him, resonating at an uncomfortable range like someone who started the national anthem in too high a key.  Leo's assets usually mean he can hold an audience rapt with a solo number, but ""First to Finish, Last to Start"" is marred by an overdubbed guitar solo that's completely oblivious to the chord changes.  And yeah, I could do without the whistling in ""The Crane Takes Flight"".</p><p>  Still, <em>Hearts of Oak</em> comes out smelling far sweeter than the releases of Leo's fellow glossy-mag guitar loyalists.  Eschewing pretentious unpretentiousness for unguarded passion, strict '77-'82 influences for the classic rock stop on the FM dial, calculated instrumental inadequacy for guitar solos that are less technical flaunting (looking at you, Malkmus) than skillful, noisy exorcisms, Ted Leo makes a sound filled with so much authentic abandon that the British mags probably can't handle it.  And that, my friends, is just about the biggest endorsement I can offer.</p><p> </p></div>"|4739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4739-hearts-of-oak/|8.3|Rob Mitchum

    backing band, you can only call Manishevitz a band in the same way you could call, say, Guided by Voices or
    Nine Inch Nails a band.  Thing is, in that regard it's a fantastic band.  The songs are quality, nicely
    arranged and beautifully produced.  In the ""actual band"" regard, however, the outlook's not quite as sunny,
    since the growth of the collective as a whole can only mature at the rate of its central member, and perhaps
    more importantly, because the results can vary greatly from record to record.</p><p>
    
    For the occasion of this EP, Busch has torn a few pages out the family photo album of Chicago's well-established
    indie (post-)rock scene, and lured them into a studio.  But this is one of those instances where the payoff
    isn't what it should be: This method has equated to some utterly exquisite music in the past, even from this
    band-- and mind you, it's not actually half-bad-- but here, the results are somewhat frustrating.</p><p>
    
    The recording itself may be somewhat to blame, as it doesn't ring with the kind of clarity that brought
    2000's gorgeous <i>Rollover</i> home so effectively.  You could practically hear that album breathing, and
    that's the kind of treatment Manishevitz needs-- Busch's voice is a limited instrument, and he needs some
    space in the mix to be most effective.  Here, there's something almost muted about the sound, as though the
    decidedly pale colors on the cover were the inspiration for everything contained within.</p><p>
    
    And that's a shame, because the music deserves better.  The two originals, co-written by Busch and guitarist
    Via Nuon (aka Bevel), are still inspired pieces of work.  ""Back in the Day"" is a loopy waltz in the grand
    Manishevitz tradition, with a smart arrangement by long-term contributor Fred Lonberg-Holm, and sports a
    great instrumental passage where Lonberg-Holm plays some nicely crunchy cello parts, and Nuon heads up
    top with some searching phrases.  It's immediately outdone, however, by the excellent title track, easily
    one of the most energetic pieces Manishevitz have recorded.  Nuon's lightly embellished melodies are the
    carrot pulling the rest of the band along, and they duly whip the song up to a full gallop.</p><p>
    
    But aside from a rather incidental tape collage called ""Backwards Deck"", the rest of the EP consists of two
    covers-- Robert Wyatt's ""Free Will and Testament"" and Roxy Music's ""2HB""-- neither of which are especially
    interesting in this context.  ""Free Will and Testament"" just kind of drifts along, and while Nuon and
    Lonberg-Holm try subtly to spruce it up with various embellishments, it's a losing proposition.  ""2HB""
    suffers more, though, as Busch just cannot do Bryan Ferry's swooning vocal melody justice.  The song gets
    further bogged down in its intentionally cluttered outro, which basically ends up sounding like Radiohead's
    ""The National Anthem"" with no muscle.</p><p>
    
    Taken alongside Manishevitz's other work, I'd label <i>Private Lines</i> a minor letdown, though I hardly
    think it's cause for alarm-- EPs are frequently used as clearinghouses and stopgaps between albums, and
    this seems like a case of that kind of mentality.  In short: fans will likely be interested in what they
    find here, but newcomers are much better advised to head straight to <i>Rollover</i>.</p></div>"|5076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5076-private-lines-ep/|7.4|Joe Tangari

Failing that, they might have settled for freaking themselves out, but exploration     into the unknown was the key.  Peace and love?  Sure, sometimes.  Surreal visions of the beyond?     Check.  Crazy backwards guitar solos?  Extra nice.  This kind of faith in a better tomorrow through     experimentation (or at least the aping of experimentation, in the hopes of stumbling over a little     second-hand wisdom) is one of the aspects of late-60s music culture that makes it so unique,     and consequently why, in many ways, it was the last time rock was free of its own self-conscious     ambition.</p>
<p>American and British bands were quick to establish national schools of psychedelia, but continental     European bands evolved differently.  Countries like Germany and Sweden, far from the epicenters of     pop and rock flourish, got their news via weekend radio shows and imported LPs.  German guitarist     Edgar Froese, playing with a beat combo The Ones, had already formed a long-distance attachment     to Jimi Hendrix when he met Salvador Dali, and was inspired to form the earliest version of Tangerine     Dream (named after a lyric in The Beatles' ""Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds"") in 1967.  Froese met Berlin     club owner Conrad Schnitzler, himself a student of avant-garde sculpture and music (via his former     teacher Karlheinz Stockhausen), and later, drummer Klaus Schulze.  Along with organist Jimmy Jackson,     they formed the version of TD that produced their first LP, <i>Electronic Meditation</i>.</p>
<p>TD oozes their way out of the gate with the primordial muck of ""Genesis"": A short, but telling     introduction to a world apart from your mom's wholesome rock and roll.  Fuzzy guitar flutter and     Schulze's rin-tin-tinny cymbal rattle the stage clear for Schnitzler's basso profundo cello moan.     That moan, for better or for worse, is the ""melody"" here, and I suppose that makes the quivering     electro-effects a counterpoint.  Flautist Thomas Keyserling (uncredited on the original release)     bubbles here and offers a glissando there; at the height of synergetic convergence, Shulze drops a     caveman stomp on the toms.  If this was hippie music, it was borne of the most sincerely gone magick     available.</p>
<p>The two epics (a compositional preference Froese never abandoned) are ""Cold Smoke"" and ""Journey     Through A Burning Brain"", both of which sound much more in tune with music Shulze and Schnitzler     would go on to create than anything TD became famous for.  In fact, parts of ""Journey"" remind me of     each of Schnitzler's Kluster LPs, with unidentified sound effects and a hard-line approach to free     improvisation: Any melodies are purely coincidental, and should not detract from the generally     horrific vibe.  The band does lapse into prototypical krautrock beat-mantra midway through, but     makes sure to mix in sufficiently atonal flute soloing, and Froese's boundless, rhythmless guitar     stylings.  ""Cold Smoke"" begins with a different strategy, one much closer to what most folks think     of when TD is mentioned: Keyboard-dominated atmospherics.  That strategy lasts for exactly one     minute before Shulze's cymbals rip apart the solemn organ chords; the organ tries to come back, and     Shulze destroys it again.  In the end, things end up fairly similar to the previous tune, though     the seeds of a gentler TD have been planted.</p>
<p>""Ashes to Ashes"" takes the organ from ""Cold Smoke"" and adds some Doors-ish cocktail-rock drumming,     and of course, more free guitar and flute.  On <i>Electronic Meditation</i>, this tune is as close     to rock as the group played, and in places is not unlike concurrent Grateful Dead (or more accurately,     Amon Duul II).  ""Resurrection"" tidies up the biblical concept with church organ and a backwards sermon     (devilish!), and a return of the gooey acid-ballet of the opening song (hereby allowing TD to corner     the market on psychedelic, freeform biblical concept albums from Germany).  It was a far cry from the     mystical impressionism of their mid-70s LPs (with only Froese remaining from this trio), and anyone     who thinks the band is good for little more than New Age background moods will be surprised     by this music.</p>
<p>Shulze left the band before <i>Electronic Meditation</i> was released, and Schnitzler stayed on only     long enough to see the induction of 16-year old drummer Chris Franke into the band.  Schnitzler's     replacement was the rambunctious organist Steve Shroyder (himself a member for only one album).  The     trio of Froese, Franke and Shroyder (along with two guest musicians) recorded TD's second record,     <i>Alpha Centauri</i>, and had little difficulty living up to the freaky promise of the Dream's debut.     Pieces like ""Sunrise In the Third System"" (an organ-led mystic processional) and the single (!)     ""Ultima Thule Part 1"" (with a very non-TD rock thud) proved the band were learning how to pour     maximum mood into more compact structures.</p>
<p>That said, the centerpiece is the massive title-track: Not only does this piece take up the bulk of     <i>Alpha Centauri</i>, it's an almost perfect summation of everything they'd accomplished up to that     point.  Beginning with distant flute, and gigantic cymbal swells, the track (like many before) takes     a while to get off the ground, but when Froese's brand new VCS3 synthesizer makes with the siren     calls, the outer limits are within reach.  Even at this early point, Froese was fascinated with the     possibility of the synthesizer, though he hadn't quite mastered its range.  Flautist Udo Dennebourg     plays a starring role for much of the piece, adding melodic, if flighty, direction to an otherwise     malleable form.  Dennebourg begins announcing something at the close of the piece, and wordless,     choral backing vocals deliver the dark finale.</p>
<p>Each of these records (as well as 1972's <i>Zeit</i> and 1973's <i>Atem</i>) were originally released     on Ralf-Ulrich Kaiser's legendary Ohr imprint, also home to the first recordings of Ash Ra Temple,     Popol Vuh and Amon Duul.  Over the years, Tangerine Dream has undergone a number of personnel     changes, and Froese gradually transformed the chaotic Technicolor of his band's first recordings     into an altogether different trip.

Failing that, they might have settled for freaking themselves out, but exploration     into the unknown was the key.  Peace and love?  Sure, sometimes.  Surreal visions of the beyond?     Check.  Crazy backwards guitar solos?  Extra nice.  This kind of faith in a better tomorrow through     experimentation (or at least the aping of experimentation, in the hopes of stumbling over a little     second-hand wisdom) is one of the aspects of late-60s music culture that makes it so unique,     and consequently why, in many ways, it was the last time rock was free of its own self-conscious     ambition.</p>
<p>American and British bands were quick to establish national schools of psychedelia, but continental     European bands evolved differently.  Countries like Germany and Sweden, far from the epicenters of     pop and rock flourish, got their news via weekend radio shows and imported LPs.  German guitarist     Edgar Froese, playing with a beat combo The Ones, had already formed a long-distance attachment     to Jimi Hendrix when he met Salvador Dali, and was inspired to form the earliest version of Tangerine     Dream (named after a lyric in The Beatles' ""Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds"") in 1967.  Froese met Berlin     club owner Conrad Schnitzler, himself a student of avant-garde sculpture and music (via his former     teacher Karlheinz Stockhausen), and later, drummer Klaus Schulze.  Along with organist Jimmy Jackson,     they formed the version of TD that produced their first LP, <i>Electronic Meditation</i>.</p>
<p>TD oozes their way out of the gate with the primordial muck of ""Genesis"": A short, but telling     introduction to a world apart from your mom's wholesome rock and roll.  Fuzzy guitar flutter and     Schulze's rin-tin-tinny cymbal rattle the stage clear for Schnitzler's basso profundo cello moan.     That moan, for better or for worse, is the ""melody"" here, and I suppose that makes the quivering     electro-effects a counterpoint.  Flautist Thomas Keyserling (uncredited on the original release)     bubbles here and offers a glissando there; at the height of synergetic convergence, Shulze drops a     caveman stomp on the toms.  If this was hippie music, it was borne of the most sincerely gone magick     available.</p>
<p>The two epics (a compositional preference Froese never abandoned) are ""Cold Smoke"" and ""Journey     Through A Burning Brain"", both of which sound much more in tune with music Shulze and Schnitzler     would go on to create than anything TD became famous for.  In fact, parts of ""Journey"" remind me of     each of Schnitzler's Kluster LPs, with unidentified sound effects and a hard-line approach to free     improvisation: Any melodies are purely coincidental, and should not detract from the generally     horrific vibe.

Terrorism and conflict
    may have finally hit home here in the U.S., but we're not even remotely close to the numbing cycle of
    violence and counterviolence the people of the Levant live with every day.  The geek in me just has
    to ask: What kind of bands form in that sort of climate?  It's easy to think of angry, depressing
    music coming out of every practice space in the country, but I somehow doubt that's what prevails;
    if anything, I'd think people would be eager to escape the news of the day whenever they throw a
    CD on, or head out to a club.</p><p>
    
    Tel Aviv quartet RockFour sound so removed from the Negev Desert and the Wailing Wall, you'd be
    hard-pressed to even guess at their origins.  In fact, RockFour sound incredibly like a product
    of late-60s Britain-- a little bit of early Pink Floyd, a lot of Beatles, a pinch of Byrds, a smidgen
    of The Zombies-- with the occasional exception in the form of a punishing interlude, or strange,
    studio-strangled breakdown.  I don't need to tell you that the 60s revival game has been played
    to played-out, but that's probably the most remarkable thing: These four guys from Israel make it
    fresh again, and in the process put to shame just about any American or British throwback act you
    could point to.</p><p>
    
    For one thing, their English lyrics slay any neo-hippie garbage the average neo-<i>Nuggets</i> band
    tosses out, ranging from incisive questioning of institutions and social responsibility (""Government"")
    to things as fundamental to pop music as love.  And mind you, their first language isn't even English
    (it's Hebrew).  Far more impressive, though, is RockFour's uncanny grasp of their influences, and
    their ability to expand on those points of reference, to the point where <i>Another Beginning</i>
    largely transcends them.</p><p>
    
    ""Oranges"", with its opening jangle and impeccable harmonies, is undeniably indebted to the Byrds,
    but it gradually morphs into something else entirely, as swelling keyboards and darting Moog
    overwhelm the 12-string jangle.  Unpredictable twists and shifts in texture seem to lurk
    around every corner, from weird vocal interjections and charging codas on the title track to the
    startling tempo change that rips open the shifting guitar and lilting melody of ""One Fantastic Day"".
    The guitar tone in its faster interlude is incredibly dirty and sinister, and the shift back into
    familiar territory is nearly as disorienting.</p><p>
    
    RockFour clearly have their craft down pat (the band has four other albums out), as there's
    literally no filler on <i>Another Beginning</i>.  In the end, it's probably best to ignore
    the relative novelty of their origins, as every one of the thirteen songs here delivers.
    <i>Another Beginning</i> is a remarkable collection that, while it treads widely-covered ground,
    is also sharp, inventive and most importantly, unpredictable.</p></div>"|6816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6816-another-beginning/|8.0|Joe Tangari

    which happened to be an exercise routine of my mother's. I don't know if it was because of the tape or the
    deck, but the original sound didn't get entirely replaced: When I was done I had a copy of <i>Disintegration</i>
    with vague traces of aerobic instruction underneath, so that way back in the mix on ""Last Dance"" you could
    just make out the odd ""and three and four"" or ""keep those arms up."" Over the ensuing years, music's made me
    want to do a lot of things with my body, but this Toktok vs. Soffy O album is the first recording since that
    Robert Smith/Jane Fonda mashup that's made me want to Jazzercise, neon-hued Lycra and all. As I am not a
    particularly active person and look terrible in shorts, this is basically my way of saying that this record
    is really good.</p><p>
    
    But first the obligatory history.  Toktok itself is two guys from the Berlin techno/electro scene who started
    off releasing singles on Ellen Allien's Bpitch Control label. Those recordings are a pretty interesting mix
    of playful techno and sample pastiche, but where everything goes near-magically right is the part where
    they're lucky enough to team up with a singer named Sophia: The combined Toktok vs. Soffy O endeavor is a
    step beyond, a big concoction of Hi-NRG techno beats, sunny minimalist synths, and great big strutting pop
    songs with Sophia twirling and chanting all over them. It's a blend that'll get called techno, or electro,
    but it strikes me more as a great dance-pop sound that only techno and electro fans have properly appreciated
    thus far-- and even that's ceasing to be true, as it appears that the group's last single has actually broken
    the German charts.</p><p>
    
    When you're done with the Hasselhoff jokes consider this: I'm not surprised in the least. When these three
    are on, the effect is like watching pyrotechnics spray all over a bedroom while a particularly cool teenager
    does hairbrush Karaoke in front of the mirror. There's ""Missy Queen's Gonna Die"", which managed to use just
    stiff beats, electro's simplest bassline, and Soffy O's bratty, metallic vocal performance to leap onto what
    seemed like a half-dozen big compilations. Contending on those German charts is ""Day of Mine (Ludicrous Idiots)"",
    which fleshes out the group's sound to a surprisingly buttery sheen, replete with string samples and baritone
    sax. And sadly mislabeled as ""Neighbor"" is my personal favorite, ""Jean"", a big Hi-NRG workout that's both a
    heavy banger and incredibly fun, all minimal swing and big squishy disco loops.</p><p>
    
    Which is the surprise with their best work: It's amazingly fun and playful. These days it's clear that the
    80s fetish in a lot of northern-European dance music has conveniently bypassed the pastel good humor of the
    real-life decade; on the other end of the spectrum, the outright playfulness of stuff like French house (or,
    closer to home, DMX Krew) sometimes seems to be doing a little too much winking, nudging, and semi-ironic
    mugging. Aside from making some stellar pop tracks that can really be danced to, the genius of Toktok vs.
    Soffy O is their ability to cut a line between those two things in a way that makes them difficult to compare
    to anyone else: They're playful, sure, but they're also dead serious, which is why Soffy O can sing and
    chant everything from recriminations and dismissals to heart-on-sleeve songs about aging. It would be a
    stretch to say the sound is without precedent, but damned if it doesn't seem like it while the record's
    playing.  And it certainly doesn't hurt that Soffy O's vocal presence is as striking and convincing as
    Madonna's on ""Into the Groove"".</p><p>
    
    Here's the big apology: This album is not, at present, out on CD in the U.S., though I'd like to think it
    might be soon. It's fairly solid even apart from those killer singles, with the double 12-inch format
    organizing things nicely: The first two sides collect the singles and four other tracks on a general par
    with them; the next 12-inch sports the ""Day of Mine"" companion ""The Lookalikes"", while the other cuts drift
    gradually back toward those earlier Toktok releases, with the sound less and less focused and Soffy O less
    and less incorporated. This can look like either a big drop-off or just a final-cuts detour back into Bpitch
    territory, which means less pop immediacy and more sonic twists: The slinky tweaks of ""Talkative"" are like
    a more-fun/less-prissy counterpart to Ellen Allien's own stuff, while the jerky ""rock"" beats and guitar
    tomfoolery of ""A Pointless Life"" serve as the goofed-up throwaway every good record needs.  In other words:
    Not perfect, but look out, because when they're on, they're really quite on.</p></div>"|8096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8096-toktok-vs-soffy-o/|8.6|Nitsuh Abebe

    geniuses.  A truly astonishing chunk of the sound, style, and ambition of rock's avant-garde
    has been directly or indirectly copied from the four proper albums Reed made with The Velvet
    Underground over three decades ago. Ever since he walked away from the sex 'n' drugs circuit,
    though, Reed has frequently sounded unsure of himself, unable to find a new home. He came
    awfully close to true renaissance with his New York trilogy, but towards the end of the 90s,
    Reed lost the plot once again. Suddenly, he was approached by theater god Robert Wilson
    to apply his music to a stage adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's work called <i>POEtry</i>.
    Wilson's collaboration with Tom Waits led to <i>The Black Rider</i>, one of the weirdest
    albums ever to be so simultaneously good; it's only natural Reed was excited about the
    possibilities.</p><p>
    
    The music from <i>POEtry</i> has been released as <i>The Raven</i>, and it does nothing if not
    confirm that Reed is currently as clueless as his most spiteful detractors could suspect. Packaged
    as either a 75-minute single disc or an even more exhaustive double-disc set that tacks on more
    poetry and stories, this album is as much of a baffling nadir as <i>Metal Machine Music</i>, with
    nowhere near the stoned bravado.  Perhaps it works when it accompanies whatever Wilson put on his
    stage, but as a listening experience, it implodes with the combination of grand ambition and an
    equally massive void of ideas. An impressive cast of guest stars including David Bowie, Laurie
    Anderson, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Ornette Coleman-- even Willem Dafoe and Steve Buscemi-- do
    their best to help cover up Lou's wanting prose, but a list this long should provoke more trepidation
    than interest. Whenever that much decaying gunpowder is scraped together, the result is usually
    less a bang than a whimper, and in this case, it's an exceptionally drawn-out, irritating whimper.</p><p>
    
    Reed's songwriting shows no daring, producing flaccid, indecisive experiments that never get off
    the ground, and when he settles for the tried and true rock mode, he really settles.  For example,
    the simply ridiculous ""Edgar Allan Poe"" strikes like a PG-13 <i>Schoolhouse Rock</i> lesson with
    shabbier vocals.  It's not bad enough that Reed actually sings the lines, ""These are the stories
    of Edgar Allan Poe/ Not exactly the boy next do'""; incredibly, he <i>repeats</i> them several times.</p><p>
    
    Musical crimes like this abound, but what's more noisome about <i>The Raven</i> is the inept way
    the Poe tie-in hangs over the proceedings. The poetry readings are adequate, and Willem Dafoe's
    Green Goblin take on ""The Raven"" is rather fun, but even good poetry readings are no way to
    resuscitate a moribund album like this, and as a result, they wind up as just another aspect to
    unmercifully elongate the record. Worse still is the way Reed profoundly misunderstands what he's
    doing: Rather than delve into the cobwebs and shadows of Poe's psyche-- as one might expect-- he
    presents a glossy, good-natured encomium to a Great Artist, and from his tone, it's impossible to
    tell whether he's saluting Poe or Norman Rockwell. When he touches upon Poe's themes, he does so
    superficially, or obscurely. On ""Change"", he sings, ""Your ass starts to sag, your balls shrivel up,
    your cock swallowed up in its sack/ The only thing constantly changing is change, and it's always
    for the worse."" That might have some relation to Poe, but it has none to poetry, and Reed should
    know better.</p><p>
    
    He should also be wiser than to try to slip his own work next to Poe's, but he makes that mistake
    as well.  Two reworked songs, <i>Berlin</i>'s ""The Bed"" and <i>Transformer</i>'s ""Perfect Day""
    make unjustified appearances, and while guest vocalist Antony salvages the latter, the former
    illustrates much of what's wrong with <i>The Raven</i>. The original remains one of the more haunting
    songs in rock history, featuring Reed singing about suicide with a narcotic detachment, somehow
    screaming just beneath the surface. Here, he sings with the self-consciousness of someone who knows
    he's written something great. A mumbled aside about ""poetry and stuff"" becomes ""Poetry and Stuff"",
    and the song simply dies.</p><p>
    
    Reed's biggest problem has always been not realizing what he does best and, consequently, what he does
    worst.  He can't write a decent love song to save his life, but he's tried so many times since sobering
    up, you'd think he was Diane Warren.  With <i>The Raven</i>, he tries to write a gigantic love song
    to Edgar Allan Poe that's no more sophisticated than a MASH note to a grade-school crush. Reed is in
    a perfect position to draw out the rugged humanity that kept both Poe and his Velvet self tethered
    as they stared into the abyss, but he instead makes a much cheaper analogy between the two: He says
    you could dress up for Halloween as either Poe or the Rock 'n' Roll Animal because both are scary,
    and both are great artists. <i>The Raven</i>, for all its talk of tribute, is a sneakily narcissistic
    pose-- one that deserves a full-throated response of ""Nevermore.""</p></div>"|6732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6732-the-raven/|2.0|Brian James

    Hallelujahs) owner Shinji Shibayama, have never really played to the
    acid-psyche.  Yes, they have, on occasion, featured a little searing
    guitar and hyper-spatial reverb acoustics, but those have seemed more
    ornamental than core aesthetics of their songs-- as opposed to, say, Acid
    Mothers Temple.  I hear them as straight folk-rockers, perhaps more Neil
    Young than Pink Floyd, with a flair for atmospherics.  In any case, there
    aren't many artists (outside of Jagjaguwar's entire roster, that is)
    representing for the flowers-in-your-hair old-school as well as Shibayama
    and company.  <i>On the Love Beach</i>-- a play on the band's name in Japanese,
    On the Beach-- was Nagisa's first record, from 1995, and while a bit lighter
    in scope than their current stuff, is clearly of the same muse.</p><p>
    For the most part, Shibayama plays it very cool here, allowing his pick-up
    band to handle all of the freakier parts.  ""Me, On the Beach"" features folky
    acoustic guitar strumming, slack drumming and a barely-there lead vocal from
    Shibayama, accompanied by occasional harmonica and his own whistling.  This
    song, like many in Nagisa's catalog, is perfect for afternoons when zoning
    out seems a better choice than just about anything, particularly for anyone
    who likes their psych on the sweet and lowdown.  Also typical is the beamed-in
    acid flashback of a guitar solo that closes the tune.  If it weren't for
    interjections like that (see also the atonal solo in ""Elegy to Betrayal""),
    Nagisa Ni Te might be mistaken for any number of college campus minstrels,
    albeit ones with a knack for tuneful melancholia.</p><p>
    Perhaps because of their general sunny slackerdom, Nagisa Ni Te's outright
    pop moments stand out: ""Yesterday's Story"" is top notch, Donovan-styled vibes
    with a tight arrangement of brush percussion, bells, handclaps and vintage
    backwards cymbal.  And at less than three minutes, it's remarkably concise--
    who says psychedelic folk meanders?  ""Deserting You"", the second of two
    completely dissimilar versions of this tune, goes so far as to include
    faux-cabaret piano and brass (provided by Hiro Nakazaki and Tori Kudo of
    Maher Shalal Hash Baz), and comes out sounding like a young Tim Buckley
    rewriting the theme from ""Cheers"" for a community band.</p><p>
<i>On the Love Beach</i> is never unpleasant or overly strange, in spite of
    the occasional forays into echo-chamber psych or strange stylistic experiments.
    In fact, I get the feeling that Shibayama isn't really so amateurish as his
    sometimes-unstable singing (except during the background harmonies, when
    he's always spot on) would have me believe.  The arrangements are all ace,
    and taken as a whole, the songs really do transmit some brand of spaced-out
    naïveté.  However, I wouldn't say they were terribly interesting by
    themselves.  At this point, Nagisa Ni Te hadn't yet found a way to push
    their sweet nothings into the outer regions of cosmic balladry.</p></div>"|5697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5697-on-the-love-beach/|6.1|Dominique Leone

And ever since I first heard <i>Lost Horizons</i>, I've been humming an
    insidious children's tune sung by a theatrical English baritone: ""All the ducks are swimming in the water,
    falderalderaldah, falderalderaldah.""  That voice is sampled in ""Nice Weather for Ducks"", a happy-slappy
    lollipop of a song that nicely sums this record up: Sunny, bright, and vaguely irritating.</p><p>
    
    On Lemon Jelly's first full-length, following a collection of their first three EPs called <i>Lemonjelly.ky</i>, Fred
    Deakin and Nick Franglen stuck to a simple pattern.  They made eight upbeat, ebullient instrumentals with
    slick beats, synths like plastic-cast rainbows, trumpet solos, acoustic guitars, and killer vocal samples:
    Charlton Heston moaning on about how he's a ""Ramblin' Man"", or on ""Space Walk"", the ecstatic transmission
    of an astronaut proclaiming ""it's beautiful"" again and again.  This is the perfect disc to throw on after
    your four-disc <i>Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix</i> has put the whole party to sleep.  It's like eight flavors
    of ribbon candy, beach balls hitting the ground like hail, and a big plastic clown face that blows helium.</p><p>
    
    The novelty wears thin, though, and most of the tracks aren't as neat as the samples they're built around.
    The ""Ducks"" song is the most likeable (the meringue band that shows up in the bridge clinches it), but Lemon
    Jelly's own parts sound blunt and somewhat bland.  They do better when they ditch the novelty techniques:
    ""Return to Patagonia"" has propulsive melodies and a dramatic rhythm, and ""The Curse of Ka'Zar"" builds a
    loping mix of harmony voices, jazzy rhythm samples and anthemic brass to a swollen climax.</p><p>
    
    ""Experiment Number Six"" is the only break in the mood.  While the music stays in the same loungy/poppy
    vein, the subject is haunting: A detached doctor's voice narrates an experiment in which a human subject is
    killed with a stimulant and analyzed as his vital signs drop.  It's so different and sinister that it's more
    intriguing than the rest of the album, and yet annoyingly displaced-- especially when the next song (""Closer"")
    throws you right back on a strawberry-flavored hot air balloon ride.  So how you feel about <i>Lost Horizons</i>
    depends on how much it charms you.  Make no mistake, the record is extremely endearing and flawlessly
    constructed-- it's just hard to love an album that has a dazzling surface and not much underneath.</p></div>"|4726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4726-lost-horizons/|6.6|Chris Dahlen

    Willie Nelson, was an angel flying too close to the ground. His quavering voice flattened with alcoholic
    pickling, the burdensome weight of bodily pain palpable in his throat, Van Zandt's powerful songs resonated
    through artists such as Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle, the Cowboy Junkies, and Tindersticks over the decades
    with a decidedly dark edge to the proceedings. While often compared to Bob Dylan in terms of songwriting
    prowess, Van Zandt's words relied less on stream-of-conscious glossolalia than on the barren wastelands
    inside his own head. The result is more Samuel Beckett than Lightnin' Hopkins, and lines like, ""I got a
    friend at last.../ His name's Codeine/ He's the nicest thing I've ever seen/ Together we're gonna wait
    around and die,"" convey a trailer-park existentialism that can make for a rough listen-- one preferably
    with the windows shut and the whiskey opened, the gas on and the lights off.</p><p>
    
    The last in a series of fervent exhuming by the German label Normal, this posthumous release couples a 1994
    solo performance in Ireland with five songs recorded days before Townes' death on New Year's Day, 1997.
    Opener ""Flying Shoes"" is of the trunk-packing blues variety, although there's a greater weariness on display
    here than in earlier versions, leaving one to wonder if Townes could have even put his boots on by this point.
    A tape buzzing distracts the fidelity of the bleak ""Kathleen"", but the downward spiral of emotions comes
    through painfully clear, and throughout the concert, his playing is still lucid. The audience is rapt and
    appreciative throughout, if not dropping like flies as the concert continues.</p><p>
    
    When it comes to women in Townes Van Zandt's songs, they are of one variety only: succubi posing as
    barflies, pulling him down deeper into the burning hellfires with each drink of bourbon. In ""Two Girls"",
    they're of a Lynchian dichotomy, one light and one dark, abstracted beyond mere gal-flesh.  The wicked
    witch tale, ""The Hole"", is harrowing, despite its obvious imagery; Van Zandt's voice is a haunting amalgam
    of Hank Williams' ""Luke the Drifter"" persona preaching the allegorical estrangements of Franz Kafka. ""Don't
    go sneaking 'round no holes,"" he croaks at the concluding moral, ""there just might be something down there,
    wants to gobble up your soul.""</p><p>
    
    It's not all doom and gloom though, as Townes was known for interjecting jokes during his shows, if only to
    keep the suicide rate down.  Some appear here, as does a funny talking blues about discovering the
    pocket-change pleasures of Thunderbird wine and its cloudy-brained oblivion.  With Van Zandt's
    well-documented history of alcoholism, though, it seems to laugh to keep from crying.</p><p>
    
    The last studio recordings are not culled from the aborted sessions with Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley
    and Two Dollar Guitar-ist Tim Foljahn, but from earlier in that fateful December. Aside from a Pogues cover
    (""Dirty Old Town""), these are slower, eerier versions of old material, almost from life's other side, and
    are difficult to stomach with foretold death so palpable in the air. ""Nothing"" was harrowing enough on his
    1971's <i>Delta Momma Blues</i>, but here he merges with the death rattle itself, barely exhaling the final
    lines: ""Sorrow and solitude, these are the precious things, and the only words that are worth remembering.""
    <i>Absolutely Nothing</i> is fascinating, albeit extremely dismal listening, but, sharing seven songs with
    the classic double live album <i>Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas</i>, is ultimately more for
    completists and those searching for an aural equivalent of <i>Faces of Death</i>.</p></div>"|8412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8412-absolutely-nothing/|7.2|Andy Beta

Here I was, all excited to take my reviewing     skills into THE THIRD DIMENSION.  But rather than getting the musical equivalent of a novel, I was about     to dig into a <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i>, baby, controlling my destiny like a true red-blooded     American.</p>
<p>If there's any musical entity fitting for this open-ended treatment, it's Gorillaz, an act that doesn't     physically exist beyond binary code.  Nominally some kind of oblique statement about the artificiality of     today's pop stars, there were about a million ways this cartoon group could've been <i>Jem 2000</i>,     quickly filed in the novelty-music dustbin of history.  But saved by an actually pretty decent album of     spooky, vaguely hip-hop-flavored solo material from Blur's Damon Albarn and a gaggle of other hipsters     and bold-edged lewd anime from <i>Tank Girl</i> creator Jamie Hewlett, Gorillaz beat out many flesh groups     to become the rare act with success on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Chalk up a big chunk of that success to the video for ""Clint Eastwood"", a Leone-inspired (Sergio, not     Dominique) video featuring, amongst other things, a gigantic static ghost voiced by Del tha Funkee     Homosapien and zombie monkeys recreating the choreography from <i>Thriller</i>.  Like a rebel yell, it     made me want more, more, more, and so the idea of a Gorillaz video collection was quite delectable.</p>
<p>That's basically what <i>Phase One: Celebrity Take Down</i> is, as it collects ""Clint Eastwood"" and the     band's four other videos, with a whole bunch of extra stuff (some interesting, some useless) thrown in for     padding.  All of this material is arranged into an environment very similar to the renowned Gorillaz     website, with all the features spread out over the band members' rooms and other nooks and crannies of     their house.  This arrangement allows Hewlett to cram the DVD full of interesting clutter and detail, as     well as some nifty 3-D CGI, but also makes it practically impossible to get to what you want to see quickly--     no labels anywhere, unless there's a booklet not included in my promo copy's slipcase that helps point the     viewer towards his goal.</p>
<p>The fancy interface can't cover up a dearth of material, however; there's not much beyond the videos, and     the ones that aren't ""Clint Eastwood"" are only marginally more interesting than screensavers, the bizarre     Road Rally of ""19-2000"" excepted.  For the 2% of the world that cares, they also include extensive kinematics     and sketches for all the videos, so you can enjoy the animation in stationary, pencil form.</p>
<p>Visuals from the Gorillaz live show are also provided, using even more recycled footage than the videos,     and there are two award show performances where one can use the angle button to view different computer     animations created for the event.  This feat of technology is easily overshadowed by the guest rappers     filling for Del on the Chinese award show performance of ""Clint Eastwood"", two earnest fellas that     nonetheless prove that the Mandarin incarnation of The Streets is gonna be a whole lot harder to swallow.</p>
<p>Further strewn about are a few thirty-second clips featuring the band members (Gorilla Bites), segments     which prove that 1) the group possesses a very distinctively British wit (one clip revolves around how to     kill an eel for culinary purposes), and 2) a lot more could have been done to add depth to these drawerings.     The message I took away from the DVD is that, surprisingly, the conceptual part of Gorillaz lags far behind     the music; despite all the detail, there's not much character to the characters (they're even outperformed     by Hewlett and Albarn's Cuckoo's Nest impressions in the mockumentary <i>Charts of Darkness</i>).</p>
<p>The Gorillaz's feature film currently in the works might remedy this failing (and just might be the best     movie featuring fictional musicians since <i>Glitter</i>), but in terms of this release, the wasted     potential of the gimmick and relative weakness of the features makes it little more than a take-home     version of the website for the DSL-impaired.</p></div>"|3525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3525-phase-one-celebrity-take-down/|5.6|Rob Mitchum

    Their catalog is exceedingly effects-laden, perhaps too experimental for pop purists, but
    much too tuneful for diehard psychedelic torch-bearers. Still, their method of creating lo-fi,
    <i>Nuggets</i> rock has just the right amount of each attribute to keep it convincingly fresh,
    a trend that continues on their latest full-length, <i>It's a Lonely Planet</i>.</p><p>
    
    Like their last two albums, and countless singles, <i>It's a Lonely Planet</i> is full of
    lazy slide guitar, backwards hi-hats, shimmering hooks, and plenty of quarter-inch tape hiss.
    Frontman Art Difuria (ex-Lilys) strains breathily from the bottom of a shallow well; the
    music sounds as though someone slipped powdered glass into a wad of Elephant 6 bubble-gum.  Anyone
    looking for the revved up intensity of <i>Oh, The Sweet, Sweet Changes</i> or the crunch of
    ""747 (Don't Worry)"" might be disappointed: <i>It's A Lonely Planet</i> floats out of the speakers,
    much more conducive to a late night come-down than a cross country drive.  Most songs are retiring
    ballads, the kind pulled out at the end of the night to send fans out the door in each
    other's arms.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing-- the music is compelling enough to pull it off
    without getting boring-- but those initially drawn to The Photon Band for their propulsive Who
    sound are in for a sobering change of pace.</p><p>
    
    The album begins with a collage of cut-up little girl laughter, before launching into the title
    track, which includes rockist poetry like, ""I was talking to Jesus/ He had a lot to say/ I was
    talking to T. Rex, too/ And he made me feel O.K.""  <i>It's a Lonely Planet</i> only hits its stride
    halfway through: ""Paper Plane"" suggests what Guided By Voices might sound like if Bob Pollard were
    obsessed with <i>Sell Out</i> instead of the arena anthems on <i>Who's Next</i>, while the acoustic
    stroll of ""If It's A Beautiful Day"" is enough to make McCartney's first solo album jealous. ""Closer""
    lifts the The Zodiacs' ""Stay"", but thankfully, the Photon Band ditch the grating
    falsetto delivery Jackson Browne employed on his version, setting the melody in a dime-store
    My Bloody Valentine landscape, whirling with tremolo and multiple backwards tracks of guitar.</p><p>
    
    Overall, The Photon Band don't seem the least bit embarrassed about copying the sound of a bygone
    era, and as the end result is first-rate, I hope they don't second-guess themselves anytime
    soon.  Without schtick or tired irony, they survey the 70s ballad format that's been in vogue over
    the past year, infusing a variety of moves from their previously disparate shoegaze past to create a
    fine bridge, between their more raucous early efforts and a possibly mellow, golden future.</p></div>"|6279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6279-its-a-lonely-planet/|7.3|Kyle Reiter

    featuring The Western cut-up Mr. Drew Daniel!  Providing live deviancy via a slew of unrelated sexual
    incidents (aka the! finest! in! bass-dominated! entertainment!), tonight's master of ceremonies is

    The Soft Pink Truth has already presented the world with two 12-inch samples of his manhood on the esteemed
    Matthew Herbert's Soundslike imprint, but <i>Do You Party?</i> is his first full-length outing.  For the
    project, he's dragged along bongos from Mat-pal Martin Schmidt and the vox stylings of Blevin Blechdom.  But
    rest assured, this is not ""intelligent"" dance music, nor is it a simple technological experiment-- it is
    truly a declaration of penetration, a celebration of gender confusion and ONE RED HOT JAM.</p><p>
<i>Do You Party?</i> is an all-ages event, but attire is strictly adult (girls: that means no dresses).
    Mini-disco at one moment, electro-shocking the next, this party engorges the senses with only the Holiest
    four-on-the-floor.  It is explicitly prohibited to remain still, and we are not ""Soft on Crime"".  (4warning:
    Some moments may contain high percentages of European microhousing, especially ones that reference dead

    analog synths, a million and three one-second vocalists distilled to their most soulful essences, BASS,
    tastefully updated mutations of disco, ritualistic orgiastic ceremonies (time permitting), ""a devastatingly

    records as T. Raumschmiere. He's released material for venerated Cologne
    imprint Kompakt and on his own label Shitkatapult (brilliant name, that),
    and with <i>Anti</i>, he makes his American debut on John Hughes III's
    Hefty label.</p><p>
    
    Don't let the Kompakt affiliation fool you into thinking that T.
    Raumschmiere has a fondness for warmth or accessibility. <i>Anti</i>'s
    minimal techno is cold and precise, the aural equivalent of a brushed
    chrome examining table in a Bauhaus-style hospital. Like the furniture in
    our examination room, <i>Anti</i> is so ordered and clinical that any
    detritus is thrown into sharp relief. In this glitchy musical age, we
    celebrate dirt instead of cleaning it up: The detritus becomes ""melody.""</p><p>
    
    And there's a fair amount of dirty melody on <i>Anti</i>. The record starts
    off with a track called ""Random Noize Musick"" that's about as random as an
    atomic clock, all tightly sequenced beats, static hits every other bar, and,
    it must be said, some pretty interesting sounds bobbing around in the murk.
    It's dark, a bit menacing sounding, and pretty addictive at high volumes.
    ""Substrom"" sounds a lot like Pan Sonic as it brings a bit more funk in the
    form of a bouncier near-house beat and a slowly bubbling bass synth.
    ""Leichtes Kratzen"" is slow, verging on sensual, with a late-night organ-ish
    synth pad and absurd, butterfly-kiss electronic handclaps.</p><p>
    
    On ""Eroslung Durch Strom"", Raumschmiere explores explores the claustrophobia
    that comes with complete blackness in a manner similar to Plastikman's
    <i>Consumed</i>, with a murky kickdrum that seems to come from inside
    your head somewhere and an ominous, repeating melody. Darker still is ""Dual
    Kanal,"" which processes and then loops a frantic passage of clustered strings,
    stretching them thinly between electronic handclaps that this time seem like
    a slap.</p><p>
    
    There is some variety here despite the intentionally anemic nature of the
    production, and Raumschmiere demonstrates a range of darkly shaded moods.
    But despite its obvious strengths, I'm hard-pressed to identify anything
    particularly unique about <i>Anti</i>, something that might make you pluck
    this particular record from the swollen ranks of minimal techno releases. One
    almost wishes Raumschmiere had brought the noise just a bit more, so that
    the discord might provide the textural raw material that could be shaped
    into something that stands out. I'm reminded of the name of Andy Warhol's
    cable television show: <i>Nothing Special</i>.</p></div>"|6695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6695-anti/|6.0|Mark Richardson

    they've been driving steadily songward ever since.  Once the sublimation of their old tendencies
    toward hiss manipulation and feedback resulted in such a startling transformation as ""Fear of
    Fireflies"", there was no turning back, and why should there have been?  <i>Scavengers</i> was a
    clear demonstration that their talents lay elsewhere: In the crafting of radiant slow-motion scenes,
    miniature dramas playing out behind rain-slicked windowpanes.  <i>Televise</i> carries them even
    farther down the same lonely streets, under the same gray skies; they rarely deviate from form,
    keeping closer to traditional song structures than ever before. It's often a beautiful ride, but
    it's also a long one.  You might want to bring something to read, just in case.</p><p>
    
    The record peaks early, with the unrivaled rush of ""Strangler"", infusing their delicate slowcore
    antics with a compelling hint of aggression.  Caustic bass and guitar interplay seethes at its heart,
    only barely restrained by the muddled resignation of Aurelio Valle's whispers.  Despite the underlying
    tension, it doesn't stray far from Calla's comfortably faded aesthetic, and even brings to mind some
    of the simple glory of <i>Scavengers</i>' ""Fireflies"".  As with their previous album, they score big
    on the opener, but the beginning is somewhat misleading; the tension subsides before long, leaving
    hollow subtlety in its stead.</p><p>
<i>Televise</i> settles down almost immediately after ""Strangler""; ""Monument"" still shows traces of
    the first track's unresolved anger, but by ""Astral"", it has dissipated entirely.  A numbing chill
    sets in as the gloomy, weathered beauty of this album begins to come to the fore.  Valle's voice
    chokes and cracks breathlessly just above the mix; cymbal washes slowly tranquilize the listener.
    This is undeniably what Calla does best, but to a certain extent, the neural anesthesia becomes
    stultifying.  From a certain vantage this isn't a problem-- each track is dutifully calming, a
    simple matter of getting lost in the fog-- but these lush arrangements seem content to simply drift
    by, never truly engaging the listener, and making it difficult to fully appreciate the album if
    you aren't in the mood to be put under.</p><p>
    
    They do eventually call it quits on the hypnotist act, late in the album.  The sly grooves of
    ""Televised"" break stride as aggressive drum patterns keep pace with a stutter-stepping bassline.
    It recaptures some of the frustration embodied in the opener, undercut by a single, desperate
    guitar refrain rattling around somewhere in the depths.  The disc then closes with ""Surface
    Scratch"", a gloriously shaky bit of piano minimalism that owes more than a nod to Howe Gelb's
    finer empty-air desert wanderings.  Together, these unique pieces are an impressive reward after
    clearing the cobwebs and surfacing from the recesses of the album's languorous middle works.
    It's truly a grand finale, but <i>Televise</i> could have used a mild shot in the arm a bit
    sooner.</p></div>"|1251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1251-televise/|7.5|Eric Carr

Whether it was the extensive photographic portraiture
    and videos of snowboarding bros shredding around the world, or the ceiling-high murals from the Destroy All
    Monsters collective rendering the mug-ugly visages of The Stooges, The Nuge, Sun Ra, and Grand Funk Railroad
    for all the art world to see, there was a palpable masculine presence as their hobbies somehow became high
    art. The weirdest room of all, though, belonged to the Forcefield collective. In a darkened enclave stood
    legions of dummy robots, unholy and menacing crossbreeds of Chewbacca high priests and Jawa fag-hags with
    tasers. Randomly they would spaz or flash red-lit eyes, emitting high-pitched squeals or other analog
    squelches. The effect was much like that of a G.G. Allin show at Alice Tully Hall, as blowhard art patrons
    were literally pinned to the back wall, afraid that at any moment one of the orange-haired mannequins might
    make a charge at them with a clawful of shit. Forcefield had turned the Whitney into a paint-huffing haunted
    house for at least one room, and it was hilariously terrifying.</p><p>
    
    Without the showroom dummies in conical hand-knits and Cousin It wigs, it's hard to attain the same effect
    with just this plastic wafer of sound effects and pre-programmed loops, buttressed by live recordings of
    the ever-mysterious Patootie Lobe, Meerk Puffy, Gorgon Radeo, and Le Geef-- but it'll have to do. Snatches
    of tiger-stripe patterns and Moog patches only begin to touch upon what kind of weirdness and odd-colored
    light is emitted from Forcefield's compound in Providence, RI, which serves as a primordial omphalos of
    sorts that led to offspring such as Lightning Bolt and Black Dice. While these groups are busy embodying
    ""rock,"" Forcefield is operating on a sub-sub-conscious level of scrambled UHF signals and stoned-brain
    alpha waves, reveling in the mental damage that maxi-thins and public access shows can really do when given
    a chance to melt together.</p><p>
    
    Amoebic and amorphous, they absorb synthesized sounds both scathing and cheesy. ""Hoedown"" is drum-machine
    cowboys and crow meat for twenty seconds, while the slightly longer ""3rd Annual Roggabogga Motion Picture
    Soundtrack"" is some of Sun Ra's primitive spacefarts under a fuzzy-rug waterfall with <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>
    reruns in the background. ""Inverse/Interior Plane of 3rd Annual Roggabogga (Behind the Scenes)"" is nigh on
    fifteen minutes of droid sighs (replete with Warhol white-wig and golden-shag tapeworm), and Technicolor
    ripples from deep within the Ituri forest, their Atari 2600 plastics firmly melded with their engorged frontal
    lobes.</p><p>
    
    More ethnic illness is in the ""Radio Puebla Metallica"" bits, as tablas loop ad nauseam before the
    acid-house of ""Assassins Rmx 'Assassabogga'"" salivates over the diva-skulls still dressed in floor-length
    jack o'lantern argyle gowns. ""Field Recording of 3rd Annual Roggabogga"" is another quarter-hour of robot
    jungle juice live from the Whitney, or some other such lost continental ceremony, and the ""2nd Annual
    Roggabogga"" is similarly sustained damage, making the end of the disc a bit too mind-numbing to crawl
    through completely.</p><p>
    
    Beta-era digital collage and grade-Z cultural clutter are what powers Forcefield best, and while the glossy
    pics add another element to the puzzle, it remains impossible to fully assess their work through this release
    alone. The parameters of early Boredoms meta-lingua and art school-era Devo's synthesized jocko-lobotomies
    are firmly in place, as are each band's outlandish dress codes, but there's so much more going on up at the
    compound (video art, installation, comics and other newsprint publications, etc.) that this can be but a
    Roswell-like fragment of their obscured Tommyknocker craft.</p></div>"|3154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3154-roggaboggas/|6.6|Andy Beta

From Atmosphere to Sole-- and even     Eminem in his totalitarian, sensitive dickhead guise-- rappers of late seem desperate to let the world     know that, ""Hey, I'm a fucked-up piece of shit, too!""  And the extent of self-loathing in hip-hop is     only spiraling deeper in oppression; even though it's a universal sentiment (everybody hates themselves     <em>sometimes</em>), you just wanna point to Tony Soprano and recommend some therapy, 'cause clearly, help     is no longer considered socially emasculating.</p><p>Awol One, thankfully, doesn't suffer from this affliction to the point where it becomes the sole message     of his music-- though he certainly whips up a vast mire of his own insecurity on <em>Propaganda</em>.  Sure,     he spits some self-hate through his phlegmy rasp, and even a little reflective self-pity, which actually     finds a comfortable residence in his morose, boggy half-singing.  But mostly, Awol solves his own problems     before he begs for sympathy. When he asks, ""Why do I always destroy all the good things in my life?"" he     answers his own question: ""Self-destructive behavior.""  Atmosphere, listen and learn.</p><p>Of course, <em>Propaganda</em> does have its share of self-destructive behavior. There's plenty of it--     including self-abuse.  But Awol gets most specific when he's reflective, when he finds solace in a rhyme.     Acting not so much as a mirror as a barometer, he observes, ""Music is just like a heartbeat. Watch the     world, and I gotta take notes,"" and simply, ""Music makes me feel alive."" He presents himself as a scribe,     representing for those that beat themselves down, empathizing with their plight, sometimes calling them     (himself?) out: ""You look so sad in your self-centered, lonely life.""  <em>Propaganda</em> is pregnant with     these kinds of conversationally paced cadences and Awol's perpetually gritty vocal timbre, which conveys     a certain raw fragility. Like just about everything these days, it's so goddamn meta.</p>
<p>Honestly, though, it sometimes hurts to listen to this, which means he's doing his job. Because the record     is, for the most part, art as therapy, the nerve Awol hits is sometimes too raw in its brutal emotional     honesty (""Sometimes I don't mind being a loser.  But I'm not a beginner"").  Not to mention Fat Jack's beats--     low-key and spacious, almost minimal, and about as funky as a funeral procession. There's no escapism in     Awol's inner dialogue, no effort to paint himself as fucked-up-crazy and therefore cool; there is beauty,     however, in the knowledge he's spoon-feeding you the cold, hard truth.</p>

    Right?  Where'd everybody go?  Deke?  Trey?  Oh, yeah, skate-rock never went away.  It somehow got inside the
    malls whose parking lots it used to corrupt after hours.  It became emo, or diluted post-Green-Day distortion-pop,
    or Warped-Tour-core.</p><p>
    
    Memory lane's a bitch, all grown over with bramble and pocked with billboards.  But each of us can coo at
    recalling the day we broke our right arms in two places when we hit that chain link fence trying to perform
    a trick on a stolen Guerrero.  What could be sweeter than when we passed out in shock a little while later
    in that hot dog line?  Remember how unconsciousness looked like TV static?  Dag Nasty was there, soundtracking
    it all, part of our (now that I think of it, very un-punk) slavish loyalty to Dischord Records in the virginal
    anarchic days before Tony Hawk performed in <i>Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol</i> and Urban Dance Squad
    lip-synched in a poolful of pro boarders. And skating deserved a music; you've got to love a mode of transportation
    that incorporates the human appetite for slapstick.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, Minor Threat were famously tight, but they were like a boiler threatening to blow; Dag Nasty never
    sounded as borderline unhinged or ""hardcore."" So the tameness of this one-off reunion (marking the ten-year
    anniversary since their last reunion on 1992's limp <i>Four on the Floor</i>) comes as no shock. 1987's
    <i>Wig Out at Denko's</i> exemplified the most powerful chronicle of their self-help speed metal, though
    the kids swear by <i>Can I Say</i>, probably out of that peculiar punk affinity for firsts. Those folks
    will be happy to find that the retro-D.C. <i>Minority of One</i> is helmed by <i>Can I Say</i> vocalist
    Dave Smalley, also of All and Down by Law renown.</p><p>
    
    This album's fun, though, for what it is: An old-school muscle-flex. As my visiting cousin noted, the guitars
    go ""rernt-ra-rernt"" and the drums go ""doom-papa-doom-pap.""  Blood kin ain't lying; Brian Baker, also the
    guitarist for Bad Religion, can't not sound like himself, though he's allowed to loom larger in the mix and
    drop more stopwatchably athletic solos on this outing (the occasional Caucasiana of those barbershop backing
    vocals further suggest the Bad Religion sound), and Colin Shears is kind of bound to that one beat as a
    result.</p><p>
    
    Then there's Smalley, sing-speaking about ""standing for things,"" being careful to balance his frustration
    with positivity as he hurls abstractions at his listeners. I'm surprised that after Built to Spill's spoof
    of this genre at the end of <i>There's Nothing Wrong with Love</i>, its mouthpieces still pen lines like,
    ""I don't know how to feel inside."" Smalley's always well-meaning (""There's got to be more to life than doing
    what we're told"") but Dag Nasty 2002 is trapped in this strange vein of rock that's transparent in its
    emotions and its didacticism, resulting in art that doesn't draw people closer-- you can garner it just
    fine through the gallery window. Smalley even delivers some early-day-MacKaye style sermons while the band
    ""hushes."" Now and again, ""in life"" is used to contextualize a line (""everywhere you go there's another wall
    in life""), which begs the question, where else other than, uh, in life?</p><p>
    
    I'll admit that this album came in handy after a traffic cop searched me this week, facilitating a brief
    hate-the-state high that had me hunting for my old hoodie and comparing prices on spray paint.  But when I
    calmed down, I realized that Dag Nasty's simplified approach could only be profound or liberating to someone
    caught in puberty's sweet torrent back in the day. If anything's changed since then, it's technology, since
    puberty is now officially installed by corporations, and we walk in the shadow of President Reagantron.
    Which might be why this aging rage sounds a little canned. The harmless riffage here was so controlled,
    so palatable, that it inhibited this reviewer's ability to riff on it.</p></div>"|2140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2140-minority-of-one/|5.1|William Bowers

    boxes of promos that arrive at the Pitchfork mailbox each month, and listen intently to hundreds of them
    in one sitting, in an attempt to discover those rare, impossibly great bands that would otherwise slip
    through the cracks.  It's been an absolute bitch so far, and awfully disheartening, but I've hit paydirt
    a couple of times, and in those moments of glory, it's been worth wading through every cut-up Cuban big
    beat record, every generic Midwestern rock record, every bar band, every swing band.  See, the problem is,
    it's impossible to know what's what; you have to just dive in and hope for the best, because sometimes the
    bands with the worst names and most hideous packaging are just great musicians who would make terrible
    image consultants.</p><p>
    Case in point: Broken Social Scene.  No one wants to admit that they like a band that goes around calling
    themselves this-- a band who, judging from their artwork, stands around all day looking pensive, crouching,
    and <i>feeling the music</i> in dramatic grayscale, a band that finds its home on Arts &amp; Crafts/Paper Bag
    Records, who puts the message ""break all codes"" above their own barcode, and who dedicates their album to
    their ""families, friends and <i>loves</i>.""  I already had them pegged!  How could they <i>not</i> be the
    most unimaginative, bleak, whiny emo bastards in the whole pile?</p><p>
    I don't know.  But this disc is nothing like you'd imagine.  Not even almost.  I've been over it again and
    again looking for some cause, some reason, <i>anything</i>, that would compel a band with this much unfiltered
    creativity and kinetic energy-- a band without even the slightest suggestion of tear-stained poetry or
    bedroom catharsis-- to fall victim to the worst possible Vagrant Records clichés.  I can't find it.  All I
    know is that when I press play, and this disc whirrs to life, it inexplicably sheds its crybaby façade and
    becomes... sort of infinite.</p><p>
    I've been listening to this disc for months on repeat-- sometimes just this disc for days-- but it wasn't
    until I began doing research for this review that it began to make sense how a band like this could
    materialize from out of nowhere with such a powerful and affecting album.  I knew from the liners that the
    group has ten members (fifteen if you include guests); what I didn't know was that all of them have been
    wandering from band to band within the wildly experimental Toronto music scene for years, or that they all
    came together from groups like Stars, Do Make Say Think, Treble Charger, A Silver Mt. Zion, and Mascott
    with the unified goal of making, of all things, pop music.  One of its members told a Toronto weekly that
    ""we'd already made our art-house albums... the whole ideology of trying to write an actual four-minute pop
    song was completely new to so many of us.""</p><p>
    Who could have imagined it would come so easily?  <i>You Forgot It in People</i> explodes with song after
    song of endlessly replayable, perfect pop.  For proof, pick virtually any track: the sound barrier-bursting
    anthem ""Almost Crimes"", the subdued, gossamer ""Looks Just like the Sun"", the Dinosaur Jr.-tinted ""Cause =
    Time"", or the shimmering, Jeff Buckley-esque ""Lover's Spit"".  And there's plenty more where that came from.
    How about the chugging guitar-pop of ""Stars and Sons"", which spins a distant, churning keyboard drone
    beneath the best moments of Spoon's <i>Girls Can Tell</i> and punctuates it with a barrage of percussive
    handclaps.  Or ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl"" which showcases Emily Haines' melting alto caught
    in a beautiful, cyclical refrain and intensely modified by vocal effects while violins float atop subtle
    banjo plucking and cascading toms.  Or ""KC Accidental"", which blasts searing, super-melodic guitar, a
    drumkit alternately galloping and relentlessly beaten, and an impenetrable wall of accelerating orchestration,
    before crash-landing into a deliquescent pop lullaby.</p><p>
    The band's aforementioned art-house pedigree goes a long way toward making <i>You Forgot It In People</i>
    more than just another fantastic pop record: One of its foremost traits is its airy spaciousness.  On many
    of its tracks, the sounds seem to resonate indefinitely, as if played at top volume on a Greenland hillside
    and recorded miles away.  Simultaneously, the album is dense with the baroque instrumentation of all fifteen
    players, each part beautifully arranged, and all of them bleeding together in perfect harmonic unison.  Chalk
    one up for heretofore unknown producer David Newfeld, who isolates the song's key instruments upfront in the
    mix, and captures all others as delicate nuances-- an expansive, pillowy bed of ethereal violins, muted
    trumpets and flutes to softly support the traditional guitars, bass and drums.</p><p>
    Rock critic Michael Goldberg recently speculated that what makes music fanatics thirst for the obscure is
    the desire to discover music that is ""uncontaminated by the commerce machine.""  This, he says, is the
    reason we cling to the abstract and unmarketable, the outlandish and abrasive.  And yet, this is also the
    guy whose favorite album of last year was the painfully vacuous adult-contempo masterflop by Beth Gibbons
    &amp; Rustin Man.  Granted, not all of us share Goldberg's taste for sub-folk cheddar, but there's something
    <i>like</i> that record in each of our collections.  So, how can there be room for both challenging,
    forward-thinking music <i>and</i> straight-up accessibility?</p><p>
    Well, we're not <i>total</i> fucking assholes, right?  We can kick back with Ekkehard Ehlers or Electric
    Light Orchestra-- there's inherent greatness in both.  But the holy grail for people like us is the record
    that combines outright experimentation <i>and</i> strong hooks, something that engages us mentally while
    appealing to the instincts that draw us toward pop immediacy.  Some of the best records ever have been
    ones that put these two seemingly disparate elements together-- and you can go as recent as The Notwist's
    <i>Neon Golden</i> or as far back as <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i> (and probably farther, if you want).  This kind
    of music shouldn't be hard to come by; it's just that not many artists are able to perfect that balance.</p><p>
    Broken Social Scene have, and even made it seem effortless.  I wish I could convey to you just <i>how</i>
    perfectly this record pulls off that balancing act, how incredibly catchy and hummable these songs are,
    despite their refusal to resort to pandering or oversimplicity.  I wish I could convey how they've made
    just exactly the kind of pop record that stands the test of time, and how its ill-advised packaging and
    shudder-inducing bandname seem so infinitesimal after immersing yourself in the music.  And I hate to end
    this saying, ""You just have to hear it for yourself.""  But oh my god, you do.  You just really, really do.</p></div>"|952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/952-you-forgot-it-in-people/|9.2|Ryan Schreiber

They've
    released around a half-dozen full-lengths of various kinds, including at
    least one near-masterpiece (1999's <i>Low Birth Weight</i>), an excellent
    ambient release as part of Darla's Bliss Out series (<i>A Trick of the
    Sea</i>, from 1998), and a concept album about the first World War (2000's
    <i>Artists Rifles</i>), yet their profile in America remains remarkably
    low. Partly because they're difficult to track (the personnel in the band
    changes constantly, and they release and re-release music in every format
    available), even dedicated music press consumers come across Piano Magic
    only occasionally. You could almost say that their coverage and fan
    murmurings mirror the actual music; rather than being shouted from the
    rooftops, Piano Magic hype spreads via intimate whispers.</p><p>
    
    The word on the street about <i>Writers Without Homes</i> since its release
    in late 2002 has been almost uniformly negative. Few Piano Magic fans hear
    it as anything but a disappointment.  Listening to it a couple months after
    most observers have had their say, it occurs to me expectations for this band
    are high, and this record has been graded on a curve. It's a good thing to
    expect a lot of a band, and Piano Magic, brilliant as they've been on occasion,
    is expected to turn out something great. This album certainly never approaches
    that high plateau, but it still has its pleasures.</p><p>
    
    But one thing is for sure: <i>Writers Without Homes</i> is definitely as moody
    and beautifully recorded as any Piano Magic I've heard. Glen Johnson has a
    tremendous grasp of how to convey feeling through sound, particularly with the
    guitar. The high, rapid arpeggios that follow the booming drums into the void
    on ""(Music Won't Save You from Anything But) Silence"" are tense and harsh, like
    a thick rope cinched around your chest. The plucked acoustic on the lovely
    one-minute folk tune ""It's the Same Dream That Lasts All Night"" is so rich
    and powerful you forget that it provides the only music behind Suzy Mangion's
    heavily reverbed voice. And the positively Frippertronic whine of James Topham's
    electrified viola that winds its way through ""Already Ghosts"" is by far the best
    thing about the track.</p><p>
    
    And there's the rub: For all the album's lovely sounds, the bulk of the
    actual songs on <i>Writers Without Homes</i> are not particularly memorable.
    The quietly spoken lyric atop the gurgling bed of wistfulness is a Piano Magic
    staple, but the tracks using this technique here are remarkably flat. While
    something like ""Snow Drums"" from <i>Low Birth Weight</i> was packed with
    remarkable lyric detail to make the words come to life, tracks here like
    ""Certainty"" and ""Dutch Housing"" just kind of lay there without depth like
    a pretty doily.</p><p>
    
    The only unarguably great <em>song</em> is ""The Season is Long"", which
    features John Grant of The Czars harmonizing with himself on the chorus,
    ""Don't you ever think that you might love me?"" It makes me think of one of
    Kurt Cobain's best lines: ""I miss the comfort in being sad."" Once you have
    someone in your life who <em>does</em> love you, you get a bit melancholy
    about how deeply a song like ""The Season is Long"" could cut you when you
    were alone. That track aside, however, <i>Writers Without Homes</i> is
    ultimately a nice sounding record without the emotional weight that makes
    Piano Magic special.</p></div>"|6281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6281-writers-without-homes/|6.1|Mark Richardson

    release of the Australian band's debut-- Dirty Three.  Warren Ellis would saw at his violin, gazing into

    Dean who appeared to be petting his hollow-bodied Gretsch, conveyed the band's blue cool. After Dirty Three's
    raw outpouring, Pavement's profile was reduced to that of the smirking DJs they once were.</p><p>
    Over several albums Dirty Three perfected their style, which was to lilt a bit, only to erupt into violent
    über-crescendos that called to mind an Itzhak Perlman score for Spielberg's holocaust vigilante epic
    <i>Schindler's Pissed</i>. Members of the band became a kind of Funk Brothers for indie rock's dark
    horsepeople, backing such nihiluminaries as Nick Cave, Cat Power, Will Oldham and (Smog). On Dirty Three
    records, Ellis was always the madman scampering around Turner's garden. When that garden is undisturbed,
    though, it's a beautiful thing, as Turner has proven on releases with White as Tren Brothers, with Oldham
    (reciting excerpts from Rabindranath Tagore's <i>Gitanjali</i>) as Marquis de Tren, with an all-star cast
    as Boxhead Ensemble, and on three solo full-lengths, the newest of which is <i>Moth</i>.</p><p>
    If <i>Moth</i>'s nineteen untitled parts comprise a sequel to <i>Marlan Rosa</i>, that album's cresting ship
    is marooned somewhere, and its captain has carved himself out a domicile; barking dogs on ""Part 1"" help to
    ground the album. <i>Rosa</i>'s violins and drums must have never washed ashore, but the island's other
    inhabitant, multi-instrumentalist (and Simon Joyner/Edith Frost/Pinetop Seven sideman) Mike Krassner, more
    than makes up for their absence with plaintive piano tones that would melt even David Grubbs' icy fingers.
    And how to describe Turner's playing? I don't know, ""heroin-flamenco?""</p><p>
    He strikes chords with a kind of rolling, prophetic brush. He plucks strings as if he's confidently repairing
    or cleaning them with nervous tools. Yet there's something ""organic"" about his leapfrogging tranquilly up
    the fretboard's stream. His arpeggios sound like they're stumbling home from ex-lovers' porches. Middle
    Eastern influences are detectable, but clouded with purposeful imprecisions. Here and there the songs seem
    composed, but Turner's apparently reading from Polaroids instead of sheet music. The pieces' only flaw is
    that they're often abbreviated, as if Turner fliply stopped the tape (though the same technique wasn't so
    problematic on Turner's more wholly fragmented solo debut <i>Tren Phantasma</i>).</p><p>
<i>Moth</i> is meditative, in a trance sense-- you can't concentrate to it, since its odd timing sidesteps
    willfulness, and its organs may leave you humming along like some guru's brain-spanked disciple. (Turner's
    word ""Tren"" might even be a shorthand for Zen trance, since ""Zance"" sounds stupid.) This album's baroque
    implosions prefigure what would happen if someone let the hot air out of Sigur Rós, and its dilapidated
    majesty suggests that it'd have made a fine soundtrack for the earthier moments in that popular, unflinchingly
    homoerotic trilogy about the gay wizard and the elves fighting to keep jewelry out of the penis-towers. (One
    of the Latin words for ""ring,"" after all, is rectum.)</p><p>
    The listener won't mind <i>Moth</i>'s retreads of other Turner progressions. The listener will be treated to
    un-pedaled acoustic pieces as well as backward loops and dubs as fragile as a tapestry of overlaid spiderwebs.
    The listener will envision Nick Drake warming up for ""Black Eyed Dog."" The listener will feel like the
    dentist's assistant just adjusted the sweet nitrous knob. The listener will think a bunch of abstract
    hokum-- gag, I seriously wrote in my notes that ""Part 12 traces the savage architecture of the snot-trails
    generated by a weeping deadbeat dad."" The listener will forget how funny it is that web searches for Mick
    Turner result in lists of sites that reference Mick Jagger and Tina Turner (and that Bill ""Smog"" Callahan's
    web-presence is outsized by that of Bill Callahan the Oakland Raiders coach). The listener will be reminded,
    even by <i>Moth</i>'s nineteen exhalations, of how Dirty Three flies in the face of all the instrumental
    trignometrists: Their emotiveness makes them a rock band.</p></div>"|8193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8193-moth/|8.0|William Bowers

My pops dropped a 2600 on me on
    my sixth birthday, and from there on out it was <i>Joust</i> and <i>Adventure</i> and that goddamn impossible
    <i>E.T.</i>  In recent years I've been geeky with my time and money and tracked down other old Atari models,
    like the Atari 400 computer and the last re-working of the Atari console system, the 7800. I've come across
    countless Commodores in these searches, but never have I been tempted to buy one. Maybe it's a Coke/Pepsi-type
    of thing. Some kids dug Go-Bots and Legos, some went in for Transformers and Construx. So as far as nostalgia
    goes, Lesser's <i>C64 Massive SIDplay Mix</i> didn't have me reaching for the photo album and tissues. Give
    me <i>River Raid</i> any day.</p><p>
    Being a PC noodler and composer, however, has exposed me to the sounds and possibilities of the SID chip,
    the source of the Commodore's grainy, chunky, Vietnam-vet-beat-boxing-with-a-vocoder musical palette. While
    it actually utilizes less tone generators than the Atari's POKEY synth chip (three channels to the POKEY's
    four), and exists in two different models (MOS 6581, used here, and MOS 8580), the SID chip has seemingly
    found the widest post-heyday audience: There are websites that list scores of C64-exclusive composers.  And
    now, there's also this latest effort from Matmos VIP J. Lesser.  An indulgent celebration of one fan's
    devotion to the legacy of Bob Yannes, <i>C64 Massive SIDplay</i> is a continuous mix of (supposedly)
    pre-existing SID-crafted loops and dot-matrix grooves that stands as both a tribute and an exercise in
    pushing the chip's dated abilities to the maximum.  It's a showcase.  Oh yeah, and a chance to completely
    fuck with Paula Abdul.</p><p>
    Abdul's silly-bitch single ""Straight Up"" gets an 8bit enema here, and arena heroes Van Halen are represented
    by a decayed, malfunctioning interpretation of ""Jump""; these and a few other covers in the mix, while
    entertaining, come off as cute and gimmicky, and don't develop into anything more than novelties (I've
    already heard that terrible Canadian dance version of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""-- do we need to trivialize
    this song again?). Only Salt 'N' Pepa's ""Push It"" benefits from the tinkering, rising from the album's
    closing minutes like a ready-made cyborg street soldier with infinite ammo and nine lives left. These cuts
    find themselves mixed up with straight-ahead techno potboilers a la the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> theme, fractured
    drum breaks, SID rave whistles, and gabber basslines, all spliced together by Lesser, who is obviously
    enjoying himself under his street pimp alias DJ Brotha P-Touch.</p><p>
    But nostalgia only gets so many miles per gallon, and as a continuous mix, <i>Massive SIDplay</i> breaks
    down pretty fast; not from a lack of love or skill on Lesser's part, but from the simple fact that
    unadulterated video game music gets old after a while. The SID chip tones become nondescript, the rhythms
    repetitive and predictable (although the slash-and burn explosion around the 48-minute mark shakes things
    up, composition-wise), and as one track links up with the next you find yourself wondering: Do I really
    need to hear an hour of this?  Alec Empire's <i>Nintendo Teenage Robots</i> ran into similar trouble with
    the Nintendo sound chip, finding that the limitations of the source device led to an increasing lack of
    modern musical possibilities and a heap of discarded work. Lesser would be wise to listen to the 8-bit
    Construction Set's ""Atari vs. Commodore"" 12-inch, one side of which features SID-composed locked grooves
    for DJs, as well as the ingenious ""Dollars"", which puts the nostalgia aside and finds the Detroit grime
    in the SID's silicon soul.</p><p>
    For those among you weaned on a Commodore in the rec rooms and dens of American youth, <i>Massive SIDplay</i>
    could be the soundtrack of your life: An indelible, comforting stroll through a gamer's childhood, assuming
    your childhood took place above a Tokyo discothèque circa 1983. For the rest of us, Lesser's mix is an
    interesting document of the SID chip's capabilities and charms. It's prime mixing material and a clever
    musical oddity, but not the party-starter it hopes to be.</p></div>"|4754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4754-c64-massive-sidplay-party-mix-cd/|5.0|Mark Martelli

    backlash? When a technique with an extremely specific
    application gets transformed into a ""movement"" it's bound
    to eventually lead to some seriously boring records and
    an indifferent audience. On the evidence of its most recent
<i>
 Clicks &amp; Cuts
</i>
compilation, Mille Plateaux seems to
    sense that academic glitch-for-glitch's sake may have run
    its course, and it set its sights on more pop-friendly
    waters. Still, the techniques in glitch
<em>
 can
</em>
be
    used in service of amazing music when the artist has an
    understanding of context and a commitment to holistic
    design. Case in point:
<i>
 Walking in Jerusalem
 by
    Random_Inc.
 
</i>
<i>
 Walking in Jerusalem
</i>
is a concept album, as sure as
    anything Rick Wakeman ever dreamed up. It's about the city
    of its title, a beautiful place with a long history, a
    fragmented place brimming with tension. Some of these
    tracks are sourced from field recordings Sebastian Meissner
    (who works as Random_Inc) made inside the city; about half
    the tracks are named for her neighborhoods, which are
    revealed in detail on the map of the city painted onto the
    CD itself. The sounds of Jerusalem, both real and imagined,
    form the backbone of this record. In addition to the field
    recordings, traditional Middle Eastern instruments are
    sampled and manipulated, giving
<i>
 Walking in Jerusalem
</i>
the kind of ancient-world-meets-postmodernism-dynamic that
    Muslimgauze perfected. To convey the tradition, splendor,
    distortion and confusion that are Jerusalem, Meissner
    utilizes some of the familiar glitch processes (lots of
    static, musical fragments chopped to bits and reassembled,
    and so on) to serve the larger idea. The application to
    this subject couldn't be more appropriate, and the result
    is one great record.</p><p>
 The bulk of the proper tracks are remix collaborations,
    while 11 interludes consist mostly of field recordings.
    Guests include Electric Birds, Tim Hecker, Ultra-Red and
    Dub Taylor. The meetings between Meissner and his
    collaborators on the figurative streets of city (tracks
    titles are named using the dub tradition, i.e., ""Random_Inc
    Meets the Rip Off Artist in Har Hazofim"") lend diversity to
    the record, which remains singular through its concept and
    the consistent sound palette. The track in collaboration
    with Tim Hecker, for example, finds the seam of tension
    inside the fabric of glowing static in much the same manner
    as the finest moments of Hecker's
 <i>
  Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do
    It Again
 </i>
 .  ""Random_Inc Meets Electric Birds in Mamillah"",
    not surprisingly, uses a more subtle approach, as a curtain
    of noise sways lazily in the distance to the pulsating sound
    of synth pads that seemed derived from some sort of Middle
    Eastern instrument.</p><p>
 Meissner's solo pieces reflect the work of a skilled
    electronic composer. ""Random_Inc Entering Jerusalem (Coming
    from the West)"" is almost unbearably tense, as a looped
    double-bass riff juts up against metallic percussion and
    random sounds from the street, signaling the approach of
    menace. ""Random Inc Entering Jerusalem (Coming from the
    East)"" delivers on that threat, with a dense, atonal web
    of sampled classical that takes the sound of a string
    quartet and reassembles them completely wrong, a wheezing
    contraption that sounds like it's going to hurt somebody.
</p><p>
 The vinyl version of ""Walking in Jerusalem"" is apparently
    a completely different album, one geared toward the
    dancefloor using the microhouse techniques on display here
    on ""Random_Inc Meets Dub Taylor in Mahane Yehuda @ 4:30
    p.m. (On April 12, 2002)"". It's amazing how well this
    appropriately stripped-down and clubbed-out track works in
    the context of this abstract record-- a nod, perhaps,
    to our collective imagination of Israeli nightlife. No
    matter what
 <em>
  kind
 </em>
 of track Meissner has in mind, it
    works as a piece in this larger puzzle, a testament to his
    thoughtful design.
 <i>
  Walking in Jerusalem
 </i>
 should be
    listened to closely, preferably in one sitting. The uncanny
    sense of movement and immersion as one track slides seamlessly
    into the next gives the record the feel of that thing that has
    been such a cliché, the ""aural film,"" the movie without
    pictures. As long as the techniques can be applied to
    moving art such as this, I say Long Live Glitch.

With their
    characteristic blend of angst, distortion squalls and delicate-- whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.
    Is that ""Live at the L.A. Coliseum"" flyer really the cover?  Look at that thing!  Is that Billy's
    First Photoshop?!  Well, now I've completely lost my train of thought. But in a way, that
    cover concisely sums up my anticipation of Zwan, an enterprise so gleefully out-of-step with the
    present, so misguidedly earnest, so just plain <i>wrong</i>.</p><p>
    
    Questionable artwork aside, fans have high hopes for <i>Mary, Star of the Sea</i>, for a number of
    reasons.  Last summer, Zwan's lineup was revealed to include two of indie rock's finest guitarists--
    Slint's Dave Pajo and Matt Sweeney of Chavez-- alongside A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin and
    Pumpkins powerhouse Jimmy Chamberlin on drums.  Soon after, barely audible bootleg MP3s began to pop
    up on file-trading networks. Through the tape hiss and crowd noise, traces of <i>actual jangly
    guitar</i> were audible, and the tone of their promising advance single ""Honestly"" confirmed this,
    suggesting a sort of alternate-dimension Smashing Pumpkins where Corgan interpreted the success of
    ""1979"" not as a mandate from the people to ""go gothic"", but to continue flogging the guitar-crunch
    cheer of ""Today"". But this was just an advance single, and as singles have misled us in the past, the
    question remains: Has Billy really discarded the goth-rock fantasies and digital overprocessing of
    <i>MACHINA</i> and reverted to the glorious mid-90s anthems he built his name on?</p><p>
    
    He has, indeed.  His black mumu is back in the attic where it belongs, indicating that, if nothing
    else, he's on the right track.  But Corgan is not a man to half-ass anything, and Zwan being his
    Fresh Start, he's gone about it with a keen sense of calculation.  Corgan's ego won't be sated
    simply by mainstream success: With Zwan, he aims to reclaim the ground he's been steadily losing
    since the release of <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i>.  Platinum-selling records,
    critical acclaim and long-standing credibility are clearly at the fore.  What he's won himself
    by reconfiguring his lineup to include icons of indie rock and goth-metal was another shot with
    each of those audiences.  Unfortunately, this seems to have been his wisest move with Zwan.</p><p>
    
    So where did Billy go wrong?  Zwan's sound, thanks to Corgan's distinctive guitar tone and Jimmy
    Chamberlin's He-Man drumming, feels right out of Butch Vig's board circa 1993, so you can't really
    fault that.  And since the album's balance between loud rockers and delicate ballads is virtually
    identical to the first two Smashing Pumpkins albums, it can't be blamed on a lack of cohesion, either.
    The problem lies with the songs themselves, which simply lack outstanding or memorable hooks: Most
    are content to meander behind a curtain of big rock guitars and bigger rock cliches, infinitely
    repeating themselves or, in some cases, never saying much of anything at all.  Others are just
    clouded by bad judgment: ""Desire"" desperately courts the MOR contingent with a homogenous pillaging
    of the Goo Goo Dolls' back catalog, while the signature 14-minute suite, disasterously titled
    ""Jesus, I"", grates where past epics surged.  This, by the way, is coming from a guy who thinks
    ""For Martha"" is one of <i>Adore</i>'s best tracks.</p><p>
    
    How fare Sirs Pajo and Sweeney?  Not terribly well, but not necessarily through any fault of their own.
    Despite their distinctive styles, pinpointing their contributions to <i>Mary, Star of the Sea</i> is
    exceedingly difficult, indicating that they've met a similar fate to that of poor old D'arcy and James
    Iha, who rarely escaped overdubbing on Pumpkins albums.  Sweeney is, in fact, nowhere to be found, though
    I swear I can hear Pajo's textured noodling a couple times, when the fray lets up.  Yet, before he even
    has a chance to step up and prove himself, his soloing is abruptly <i>blown</i> out of the mix by Corgan's
    guitar histrionics.</p><p>
    
    Chamberlin, meanwhile, proves that being a skilled drummer doesn't make you a multi-dimensional one--
    where he once served as the massive backbone that forced the band's posture into confident uprightness,
    he fails to display even a modicum of that invention here, relying on the occasional fancy fills and
    flourishes to embellish his standard metronomic timekeeping. And Paz Lenchantin seems to have been
    drafted solely for the occasional harmony vocal, yet remains stationed in the mix about 300 feet below
    Corgan's pinched larynx.  Which is all but infallible proof that this new ""band"" is but another elaborate
    solo project on which Corgan is backed by what amounts only to glamorized session musicians.</p><p>
    
    But how bad is <i>Mary, Star of the Sea</i>, really?  The catch is, it's not bad at all; just
    overwhelmingly mediocre.  Obviously, there'll be people-- devout Corganites, nine-to-fivers
    craving synapse triggers for their high school years, impressionable 13-year-olds-- that eat
    this album up, if only for moments like the big-big build-up in ""Declarations of Faith"" or
    the bells-fortified ""Endless Summer"".  But despite the anticipation with which I approached
    it, despite my affinity for Corgan-rock from <i>Gish</i> through <i>The Aeroplane Flies High</i>,
    and despite that weathered <i>Siamese Dream</i> t-shirt sharing closet space with my old flannels
    and shredded jeans, I am, to my great disappointment, not one of them.</p><p>
    
    Don't cry for me; this record marks a particularly sad moment for Corgan himself.  Here he is,
    so uncomfortable amidst the feedback therapy of his old sound, longing to return to that one
    great moment that's forever passed.  At this point, he'd re-grow the sandy blonde curls in a
    heartbeat if given the means-- judging from the ""Honestly"" video, he tried and it just came
    out his lip.  The fact remains that Corgan's ambitions have only become loftier and more
    unattainable with the passage of time, and you can't make a grand artistic statement like
    <i>Mellon Collie</i> without the attention and respect of the public.  To its credit, <i>Mary,
    Star of the Sea</i> is a great deal less bombastic and pretentious a statement than <i>MACHINA</i>,
    but it is a statement nonetheless-- one that begs, ""Don't bury me, I'm not dead.""</p></div>"|8920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8920-mary-star-of-the-sea/|4.8|Ryan Schreiber

This
    lyric pretty much sums up how Droop Capone-- better known as L.A. emcee Dr.Oop-- devised such alter
    egos as Droopy Drawls, Chief Big Hat, Mr. Verbal Sunshine, and Dread Kaczinski. He's the ""ganja guru.""
    He's ""burning nugs the size of Miss Piggy, the color of Kermit."" And, as a warning to anyone planning
    to shake it down with him: he burns ""sometimes before sex, after, or during."" Watch your chochas,
    ladies!</p><p>
    The sheer volume of these 20 semi-focused tracks makes the fact that he's such a big-time stoner
    the unifying theme on <i>Mad Hueman Disease</i>.  When Dr.Oop is on, he's on; his forte is rhyming
    in a no-frills, earnest style about his life.  ""One Life"", a nostalgic ""jazz funeral"" track, has
    a slippery, laidback feel, and ""9 to 5"" describes the struggle of looking for work: ""I've been
    denied jobs 'cause of my hair configuration.""  But when certain songs get lost in the mix due
    to messy or forgettable production, the fact that he's the ""mary-jane-iac"" who ""smokes the green
    that Jah provided for me"" is the only idea that's really sticky.</p><p>
    Much of <i>Mad Hueman Disease</i>'s edutainment vibe comes off as distinctly 1998. Surprisingly, one
    of the freshest cuts sounds straight out of '<i>88</i>, and not just cause he namedrops the ill-fated
    single mom-edy <i>Kate &amp; Allie</i>. ""Pre-Dawn"" is a simple, almost arrhythmic a cappella freestyle
    placed blearily atop midtempo beatboxing; Dr.Oop sounds summertime-careless as he raps, ""Talkin'
    shit from New York to L.A./ Kickin' like Pele/ When he's playin' socca/ Drinkin' vodka/ With ism
    in my locka."" Despite <i>Mad Hueman</i>'s scattered concept, Dr.Oop's good-hearted, frank style
    can be very endearing.</p><p>
    At other points, his honesty verges on TMI.  From ""Punan Puffessa"": ""My patients give me feedback
    about examinations/ One said she liked the way the scalpel stuck her."" Eww. ""6 Months"", a song
    extolling the virtues of safe sex, feels like a public service announcement; the beats are a
    Nickelodeon-spunky mélange of bright percussion and a conservatively funky bassline, and like...
    he's preaching about using a jimmy. A noble cause, I do not deny this, but the problem is, after
    establishing the moralistic-dad vibe, the next song on the record, ""Toke and Poke"", illustrates
    how Dr.Oop likes to smoke a little of the cheeba before he freaks it with his woman, and it comes
    off vaguely creepy.  Dr.Oop's lyrics are tight, but nobody likes it when Dad talks about doin'
    the nasty with his ""Pookie Bear"".</p></div>"|1299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1299-mad-hueman-disease/|6.0|Julianne Shepherd

    they do and I just don't know about it: The band spent some time opening for The Breeders last year, so it
    seems as if plenty of you will at least have heard their name. Most of the time I'm solidly convinced that
    they're a fantastic band, and sometimes I imagine they should be as widely enjoyed as The Strokes.</p><p>
    
    It is, after all, my personal theory that The Strokes are the most successful band in this ""new rock
    revolution"" business because they're really more of a pop band: No matter what people say, they come off
    more like Blondie or The Romantics than The Velvet Underground. The same could be said of Imperial Teen,
    only they're about ten times more interesting. They're from San Francisco; they're two women and two men,
    one of whom used to be in Faith No More and the other of whom is like a pissier, more hyperactive Pat
    Smear; and some of them-- if I'm not mistaken-- are gay, a fact that fuels some of the odd gender-play in
    their lyrics: This is a band whose first single's big hook went, ""Take it like a man, boy,"" and who later
    made a rhetorical argument out of, ""Why you gotta be so proud?/ I'm the one with lipstick on.""</p><p>
    
    Also they're sly and bratty and tight: Their songs are all crunchy new-wave guitars, minimalist Pixies-style
    pop riffs, and cute, sneery harmonies. The point is defiantly not revolution: it's personality, and bite,
    and the way their melodies repeat and gather sort of hypnotically. They're just deliciously bratty: Those
    of you who understand what a landmark the Violent Femmes' debut was in the history of Perfect Records for
    Snotty Mopey Teenagers may be interested to know that <i>Seasick</i>, Imperial Teen's debut, seemed worth
    putting on the same shelf, only without the baggage of everyone finding ""Blister in the Sun"" so damned cute.
    It's no accident that whatever A&amp;R; guy thought Imperial Teen could be huge got them a spot on the soundtrack
    of the <i>Heathers</i> knock-off <i>Jawbreaker</i>-- the new-wavy teen neurosis surrounding these four is
    just palpable.</p><p>
    
    So they're a special little band-- I get a bit weepy when I see <i>Seasick</i> in bargain bins-- and with
    this disc, they've become a special little band with a pretty run-of-mill live album under their belts. I've
    wound up seeing them live a couple times, and both shows were fantastic: Their crunch was big and warm and
    enveloping, their stage presence massive.  <i>Live at Maxwell's</i> doesn't really capture that-- even when
    they sound completely on-- which makes the release more effective as a simple re-cap for the fans.</p><p>
    
    To that end, the band plays a great-hits collection of material culled pretty evenly from their three
    full-lengths: <i>Seasick</i>, <i>What is Not to Love?</i>, and <i>On</i>. By that last one, their range was
    expanding-- more ambitious songwriting, some keyboards-- but they play the older material straight, drawing
    those little opening-riff cheers from an audience waiting for its favorites. That means kicking off with the
    swinging-Pixies snot-fest ""The Beginning"" (""You're fucking movie stars?/ Well, I'm fucking congressmen""),
    then jumping into the coy, driving repetition of ""Ivanka"".  ""Lipstick"" cracks its way up to a jangling peak;
    ""Butch"", the heart and soul of <i>Seasick</i>, gets taken care of; ""Yoo-Hoo"" gets an extra helping of sarcasm.
    Most promisingly, those more complex new cuts-- choppy go-go on ""Baby"", 60s pop on ""City Song""-- sound good
    as well.</p><p>
    
    So it's one of those relatively standard live albums that no one really needs, but it's served its purpose:
    It's given me a chance to humbly ask you, maybe as a personal favor to me, to check out a few proper Imperial
    Teen album tracks. Only if you have a little spare time-- no pressure. Plenty of their songs sound like The
    Strokes' best singles, only coming from a better world where pop music is made mostly by angstful geeks with
    gender-identity issues. Their albums might not even be that expensive, since I'm pretty sure people aren't
    paying enough attention to them-- and I'm sure you can figure out a way to sample ""Lipstick"" or ""Ivanka"" or
    ""The Beginning"" if you try hard enough.</p></div>"|4083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4083-live-at-maxwells/|7.2|Nitsuh Abebe

The proper follow-up
    to 1998's <i>More You Becomes You</i> is, at times, a rewarding listen, but often feels like Liam
    Hayes (Plush's sole member) is trying far too hard to emulate the post-production pop brilliance
    of the past instead of focusing on the songs themselves. What made <i>More You Becomes You</i>
    such a great listen was the intimacy and sparseness of the solo piano-and-vocal recording. Any
    subtlety from those sessions has now evaporated, as <i>Fed</i> takes on a ""more is more"" attitude
    that only works about half the time.</p><p>
    
    Recorded over two years with five different engineers (including both Steve Albini and
    John McEntire), you can almost hear Hayes over-thinking all aspects of the album. After Drag City
    pulled out, fearing the impending enormity of his recording bill, Hayes reportedly paid six figures
    out of his own pocket to finish the album, which seems a misguided choice when you consider it has
    yet to find domestic distribution (though it has been released on the Japanese After Hours label,
    with a $25.99 list price here in the U.S.).  Fortunately for the listener, however, Hayes tends
    to be a better songwriter than he is an accountant.  At least, sometimes.</p><p>
    
    Certainly, pop music has used orchestration to its fullest potential, but let's not forget that
    under every Brian Wilson arrangement or George Martin score lurked a great song, only enhanced
    by the studio. Hayes has enlisted legendary R&amp;B;/soul arranger Tom Tom MMLXXXIV to orchestrate the
    album, but the score tries to serve as the centerpiece of <i>Fed</i>, and unfortunately, many of the
    string parts are as pointless as Tom Tom's ridiculous surname. Ultimately, the album fails when
    weaker songs buckle under the weight of the strings and horns.</p><p>
    
    When <i>Fed</i> works, it works well, and the finer moments sit alongside the brilliance of
    Randy Newman's <i>12 Songs</i> or Harry Nilsson's <i>Nilsson Schmilsson</i>, but large chunks
    of the album quickly become stale due to Hayes' constant efforts to outsmart the listener. Armed
    with a piano full of deceptive cadences, <i>Fed</i> rarely lets the ears up for air. Flexing a
    little intellectual musical muscle now and again is what separates true songwriters from those
    who merely write songs, but after fifty minutes without a hint of humor and few natural resolutions
    in the music, listening to <i>Fed</i> can be tiring; Plush seems determined to bludgeon anyone
    within earshot into pretentious submission, and trying to fake out the audience can bore as easily
    as if you hadn't any tricks to begin with.</p><p>
    
    Plush can write 70s AM Gold with the best of them; ""Greyhound Bus Station"" is easily as good as
    Looking Glass' ""Brandy"" or Nick Drake's ""Hazy Jane II"", and what makes it easily the standout
    track is how it proves Hayes can craft a three-minute gem without dressing it up to the point
    of distraction. Equally compelling is the beautiful ""No Education"", a slow number that begins,
    ""Never read a book in my life/ But I feel just fine.""  It's post-rock ballad heaven from
    there on out.</p><p>
    
    The title track is a perfect example of how <i>Fed</i> meanders: Clocking in at almost seven minutes,
    it starts with a soulful mid-tempo stroll, augmented by a droning hum and punctuating strings.
    But halfway through the track, Plush turns it into a falsetto ballad that bears no resemblance
    to the introduction. Which is fine-- schizophrenia sometimes serves well-- but with no musical
    glue holding the parts together, the song turns from epic ballad to aimlessness.</p><p>
    
    ""Fed"" sums up <i>Fed</i> nicely: A good idea gives the illusion of being flushed when really,
    it's just overdeveloped. Plush's vision was obviously reaching beyond his abilities when making
    this album, and though that's commendable-- better to try and fail than not try at all-- sometimes
    you acheive less on the road to greatness. I have no doubt Plush is on that road, but it'll be a
    while before he gets there.</p></div>"|6357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6357-fed/|6.9|Kyle Reiter

    a mythical place, had a kind of literal import, and that we earthwads imposed that myth's accepted meaning
    on other planets. Which, of course, led to thinking about the incredible odds of you and me and that horse
    and that spider over there being living matter, as insanely outnumbered as we are in this mostly dead
    universe. Which, of course, led to holing up with a hatchet and the Joy Division box set. Which, of course,
    led to reading Paul Morley's liner note about ""hell"" coming from a ""root meaning 'concealed'"" and having
    ""less to do with punishment than simple bleak survival in a vague netherworld.""</p><p>
    
    Which, of course, led to thinking about the strange vagabondish career of Eric Bachmann, a onetime guitar
    hellion whose songs of late host speakers shocked into zombification. His new album begins with a tale of a
    town ""where nobody works and nobody plays,"" from which ""even the vultures have moved on."" The inhabitants
    are waiting for a messiah, not to save them, but to put them out of their misery; it's the apocalypse as
    euthanasia, or euthanasia as salvation. Bachmann's been a man adrift-- and redeemed-- since he euthanized
    the Archers of Loaf years ago, though his reputation beats him to every town he visits, no matter what name
    he gives the locals. A venue printed tickets to a recent Crooked Fingers show that read, ""Crooked Fingers.
    Featuring Eric Bachmann. Of Archers Of Loaf.""  (Though to be fair, the curdling title track of the Archers'
    farewell <i>White Trash Heroes</i> could easily be considered the first Crooked Fingers song.)  Bachmann's
    also left crumbs as Barry Black, and even under his own name-- though, curiously, that release was a film
    score that lacked his distinctive voice.</p><p>
    
    Don't be fooled into thinking that there are Fingers the way there are Strokes; Bachmann's supporting cast
    is ever-changing.  His third full-length, <i>Red Devil Dawn</i> (named after an excellent single not
    included here), bears closest resemblance to ""the band""'s self-titled debut in that its songs comprise an
    ""album"" the way certain quilts are made of disparate cloth-scraps. Both records feature all manner of tempos,
    arrangements, and topics, whereas <i>Bring on the Snakes</i> was, in form and content, a coherent atmospheric
    thinkpiece that, via percussive plucking and aquatic keys, staged romantic futility on an abstract plane.</p><p>
    
    The vox on this outing sound as if they're consciously trying to avoid the words ""Neil"" and ""Diamond,""
    words often tossed at the mellow Hyde into which Bachmann's rambunctious Jekyll morphed.  Bachmann's
    Carolinian twang is allowed to linger longer, and intermittently he'll growl, risking a comic-villain
    put-on but reminding listeners of his olden guttural inflection (seeing him pull this off live is amazing:
    his mouth is Nicholson's Joker, his stance Woody Guthrie, and his height Vlade Divacs).</p><p>
    
    Sonic departures include the amped (which for Crooked Fingers means ""not funereal"") ""You Threw a Spark"" and
    ""Sweet Marie"". These tracks are driven by horn parts that, rather than add Belle &amp; Sebastian stateliness,
    contribute a vibe of, um... Mexican fiesta?  No kidding, this pulsing Mariachi-core will tap into your
    Anglo-Luddite fears and have you dreaming of sombrerobots taking over the world. ""Sweet Marie"" even seems
    designed to bitchslap Jimmy Buffett-- Bachmann sings about ""sniffing glue"" over a total cruise-ship or
    resort-lounge bounce (that even cops some bits of ""I Got You, Babe"").  I realize that mixing dark lyrics with
    bright music is the Toyota Camry of songwriting, but you've got to hear Bachmann aggravate the tourists by
    sneering about wanting ""soft abuse"" and promising to set his competitor (""that pussy bastard"") straight.</p><p>
    
    Also new among Bachmann's standard batch of songs in which gods and the cosmos are implicated in failing
    love (as if quasars were fueled by sexual frustration) are songs that display his skill as a fabulist. Aside
    from the town-waiting-for-a-hero song, the album features the tale of ""Boy with (100) Hands"" and the awesome
    ""Bad Man Coming"", about the approach of an ultimate dark figure at the end of a long line of dark figures.
    These grim tunes are lullabies that will induce insomnia, fairy tales in which the fairy godmothers wet
    themselves and faint. I predict that this soundtrack- and fantasy-happy artist will team up with Tim Burton
    on a claymation goth-musical any day now. (<i>Eric Bachmann Superstar</i>, anyone?)</p><p>
    
    Okay, so the album's not a step forward so much as a squirm in quicksand. And yes, <i>Red Devil Dawn</i> is
    somehow sparer than its predecessors and more interested in a staring contest than a high-five. Its characters
    are Icaruses flying just under the radar, with wings culled from the shores of a sea that burps black
    Styrofoam. But we need this emphysemic, exponentially aging paperboy to rattle us every morning by announcing,
    ""The news! Is not! Good!"" Bachmann has even shown a willingness to come to terms with his past: After a
    preview of <i>Reservoir Songs 2</i> (""Long Black Veil"", ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"", ""[What's So Funny
    'Bout] Peace Love and Understanding"") at a recent show-- to which he brought no merch and a band that
    admitted to not knowing some of the songs-- Bachmann yielded to the brats who kept screaming for Archers,
    playing ""Greatest of All Time"" and ""Harnessed in Slums"", making those brats' netherworld a little less
    bleak. You should have seem them, all guileless, pogo-ing and clapping, still a few years from feeling the
    pinch of Bachmann's more mature and desolate work.  Songs such as this album's ""You Can Never Leave"" are
    going to hit them like cinderblocks.</p></div>"|1670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1670-red-devil-dawn/|7.9|William Bowers

    a thick sheath of music as he picks the next tune.  That pile of paper holds the 208 compositions that he's
    written for the band.  The tunes cross the style of the early Ornette Coleman Quartet with themes from Jewish
    folk music, and they can sound as slow and exotic as a nightcrawl through the desert, or whiz past with
    knotty themes and quick changes played at breakneck speed.</p><p>
    
    That's the Masada songbook.  Zorn arranged it for a band that included himself on alto, Dave Douglas on
    trumpet, bassist Greg Cohen, and the inimitable Joey Baron on drums.  Arguably his best ensemble, he also
    made it one of the most recorded groups in jazz, cutting almost 20 studio and live albums in under a
    decade-- so many records that unless you're one of their mothers, you're unlikely to have heard them all.
    Zorn even farmed out some of those 200+ tunes to his chamber ensemble Bar Kokhba, and collected others on
    his 1998 release, <i>The Circle Maker</i>.</p><p>
    
    And it doesn't stop.  This year Zorn and his label, Tzadik ""Never Say Glut"" Records, has kicked off a new
    series for the 10th anniversary of Masada.  It starts with <i>Masada Guitars</i>, which features solo recitals
    by three of Zorn's favorite guitarists: Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell, his main axemen of the 90s and 80s
    respectively, and the classically trained Tim Sparks, who has recorded for Tzadik's Radical Jewish Culture
    series.</p><p>
    
    This disc is almost indulgently long, crammed with 21 similar pieces that get dignified, mid-tempo readings.
    That's a lot of samey acoustic guitar to wade through, and the fact that it's all pretty doesn't justify the
    length.  But the upside is that Zorn knows where he's going, and he knows what he wants from these guitarists;
    he's just willing to give them a lot of chances to hit it.</p><p>
    
    Take Tim Sparks, whose classical approach-- treating the songs like the lost works of Segovia-- is rigorous
    and exciting.  His bright, ringing tone and refined ornamentation beautifully embellish ""Kodashim"" and
    ""Sippur""; and his measured exploration of ""Kedushah"" heightens the richness of its ethnic themes.  By
    contrast, Marc Ribot is the most plain-spoken of the three.  He makes no extra gestures: He thumps and
    strikes out the rhythms, as on the tango-like ""Kivah"", and his harsh attack tangles the melody of
    ""Galgalim"" in his strings.  His steady, dry progression across ""Sansanah"" best demonstrates the patience
    and effort in his readings.</p><p>
    
    This makes Bill Frisell the maverick.  Instead of sticking to acoustic guitar, he unpacks his electric and
    all of his gizmos: On ""Katzatz"", he takes the fast melody and warps, loops and splinters it around itself,
    nicely invoking the Masada quartet's spastic catchiness.  And yet Frisell's finest moments happen on the
    acoustic, in the ballads ""Abidan"" and ""Avelut"".  More than most high-powered guitarists, Frisell loves to
    surrender to a good melody: In his hands these ballads' stately themes achieve a hushed beauty, with pauses
    that hang like the quiet moments of a ceremony.</p><p>
    
    The only problem is Zorn's need to cram in so many of his songs.  Zorn is a solid composer, but in his best
    music, the compositions are no more critical than his choice of performers, his skill as a band leader, and
    the room he leaves for improvisation.  Which is all critic-speak for saying that few of these pieces hit it
    out of the park.  But maybe the point isn't to nail any one song, and instead to interpret the spirit behind
    the entire Masada project. Each guitarist has brought out a different aspect: In the richness of Sparks'
    technique, the rigor and labor from Ribot, and the grace in Frisell's ballads, they approach the truth and
    purity of its themes-- ethnic, historical, and spiritual.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the best parts are so great that they make me stop worrying about how this is the start of a new
    deluge-- that Zorn probably has another dozen Masada discs in the works, plus half a dozen ""essential"" live
    albums, and worst of all, the inevitable leftovers discs that'll scoop up every scrap of the songbook that
    hasn't been committed to plastic.  What's Hebrew for ""b-sides?""</p></div>"|8925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8925-masada-guitars/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

Haven't they had their day in the sun? What else can you do with
    them? I have seen the future of good music, and it lies not in the hand of the guitar god, but the
    laptop of the bedroom composer!</p><p>
    
    Can rock and roll gel with the soft and the ware, creating not a dark and angry industrial beast,
    but a sound that draws on the less turbulent strains of the guitar's past?  Of the few bands
    able to pull off the merger of electronic-based music with that most sacred of Satan-worshipping
    gadgets, dark or no, Stars as Eyes is one to check out; if not for the big comfy living room
    chair that is <i>Enemy of Fun</i>-- their second full-length on Tigerbeat 6-- then for their deft
    and balanced approach to the alchemy of turning wood and strings into PC rock.</p><p>
    
    The sound coming out of Stars as Eyes' bedroom originates somewhere behind an old 8-track and a
    stack of Yes LPs, the sound of prog-rock filtered through the fingers of some dosing shoegazer
    and dropped into Sound Forge before filtering out into the world. A track like ""Important Youth
    Movement"", which drifts from a one-chord fuzzbox strum and droning textural noise into a
    tranquilized, orchestral slumber party, is a good indication of what this disc achieves; by
    burying the sensibilities of traditional rock structures deep within a computer daydream, Stars
    as Eyes present the guitar not as a frontman but as a muse, a central cultivation hub where
    songs are born, then nursed on silicon before their infant brains are wired to the mainframe.</p><p>
    
    ""The French Method"", the soundtrack to some stoned beach party bonfire in the Mushroom Kingdom,
    is just one possible result of such a childhood. Others range from the Clinic-ish Hammond organ
    interlude ""I Thought You Said Something Else"" to the album's highlight, ""Our Light"", an arena-rock
    explosion of crying guitars and dramatic rock opera atmospherics that warrants a tailgaters' riot
    in the parking lot after the show. The guitar tries on different hats throughout: A spiraling riff
    one moment, a moaning ambient wind, or layer of atonal hum the next. What Stars as Eyes strive
    to avoid is an unequal distribution of attention to their influences; I don't think it's possible
    to put any sort of ""dance"" label on <i>Enemy of Fun</i>, nor would it be intuitive to put it on a
    kickball team with Tortoise or Buckethead's <i>Colma</i>. The duo manages to toe the line.</p><p>
    
    It may be an inevitability, but many of the tracks here wind up taking familiar paths to their
    final encoding. Stars as Eyes take some approaches already practiced by many like-minded groups,
    and the results just can't shake the sound as previously defined. The more aggressive tracks on
    the record, particularly the frantic, <i>Bionic Commando</i> soundalike ""Falling Picture"" and
    the sloppy punk jazz of ""If I Could I Would Be You"" draw from the same well that nurtures Add
    N to (X).  If Stars of the Lid had penned the mournful closer, named after a line in <i>River's
    Edge</i> (""Where Do My Children Go at Night""), I'm guessing they might have called it ""Requiem
    for Dying Mothers Part 1"".</p><p>
    
    The guitar comes with its own set of limitations and inescapable, dogmatic implementations, and
    it's highly likely any overlap Stars as Eyes' experience with other musicians attempting similar
    feats can be linked to the finite territory of this wilderness. Solid and cohesive from start to
    close, and more than a little ambitious in its scope and reach, <i>Enemy of Fun</i> is a successful
    prototype for the future of artificially integrated laptop guitar music, improving on the more
    limited pleasures of their previous effort <i>Freedom Rock</i>. It manages to satisfy the traditional
    demands of independent rock music without leaving its 25th century cloud, making the world safe for
    electronic musicians to play air guitar in their bathrooms to the Liquid Tension Experiment once
    again.</p><p>

By now,
    stories of the majors raping and pillaging innocent, doe-eyed artists are as commonplace as
    any status symbol, like bling-lights or surgical scars.  Some bands even make movies about them.
    Nowadays, people hear tales of a Columbia A&amp;R; guy pulling the plug on someone's grandma, or
    Rick Rubin butchering a random transient and storing him in his freezer, and nobody even bats
    an eye.  Circumstances being what they are, Menthol could very easily wind up as just another
    name on the long list of artists screwed by their label, except for one thing: They got the
    shaft before it was cool.  We're talking back in '99 here.</p><p>
    
    Hoop skirts were the fashion of the day, authenticity was still sitting in for irony in popular
    media, and The Strokes were just a gleam in a prominent modeling agent's eye.  After an intensive
    four-year correspondence program with the Thomas Dolby Revivalism Institute begun subsequent to
    the release of Menthol's self-titled debut in 1995, guitarist/singer Balthasar de Ley finally
    earned his degree in Rock Science, and Menthol returned to the studio to cut a celebratory album.
    The throwback record sported bouncy, synth-driven hooks, heavy-handed power chords, and was in all
    respects a faithful emulation of ""the music my mom did aerobics to when I was in middle school,""
    according to de Ley.  The resulting homage to new wave icons like Dolby, Devo, and the rest of t
    heir peer group was a sincere tribute, and Capitol (going through restructuring pains at the
    time) was having none of it.  In '99, Capitol decided it was too busy selling the 70s to sell
    the 80s, and dropped Menthol outright, with no plans to promote the album.</p><p>
    
    After failing to get the master tapes from Capitol, Menthol re-recorded the same album, finally
    finding a release in ought-three with Hidden Agenda.  Given the eight long years of recording,
    re-recording, and corporate struggle, it doesn't seem like this album was worth the effort.
    <i>Danger: Rock Science</i> is, for better or worse, a whirlwind synthesis of what passed for
    pop during the new wave boom.  Retro keyboards factor in prominently, along with the occasional
    stadium-class solo and blasts of crunchy power-pop, but it misses as often as it hits, creating
    an album that's alternately a lot of kitschy fun or simply embarrassing.  For every triumph of
    saccharine electro-strings and mellow harmony like the almost-power ballad ""Strange Living"", or
    even the ridiculous pomp of the Devo-inspired title cut, there's a bitter defeat like ""Future
    Shock"". The song tries hard, but between absurdly vapid lyrics and some cheesy licks, it's one
    of a handful of tracks not worth much more than a quick laugh.</p><p>
    
    There's such a thing as working too close to one's subject; by so steadfastly recreating the sound
    of that era, Menthol doesn't bring much of their own to the table.  It's way, way too easy to
    discuss this album by name-dropping everyone's favorite 80s nostalgia factories: Staccato vocals
    a la Men Without Hats or Wall of Voodoo, synth-heavy melodies courtesy of Alphaville and a dozen
    other bands, and guitar flash approved by Corey Hart himself.  If any of the names I've mentioned
    elicited a shudder or a twinge, then you get the point.  <i>Danger: Rock Science!</i> is a fairly
    keen amalgam of half a decade's worth of music if little else, but Menthol's too heavy on pastiche,

The music itself made sense to me, as I'd come to the Youth
    through the avant-garde, through people like John Zorn, Morton Feldman, and Iannis Xenakis. What I didn't
    understand were the lyrics and their inflection. I had a background in the Beats, I liked lots of pop music,
    but there was something that came across as goofy and insincere in the lyrics. But I was younger then; I
    didn't realize that music could be both tongue-in-cheek and completely honest.</p><p>
    
    By the time I went back and looked into Patti Smith and some of the other recommended SY materials
    (especially Richard Kern's films), it started to make much more sense. It was so brutally and unabashedly
    direct, so highly prone to personality and personal flaws, proclivities, and romanticism-- the reason I
    didn't understand it earlier was because I'd never been exposed to much academic music without the looming
    figure of a larger-than-life Grand Artist having been responsible for its creation.  Either that, or that
    a lot of the music I was listening to didn't really say very much orally, anyway, and up until <i>Washing
    Machine</i>, you couldn't accuse SY of focusing solely on the musical aspect of their work.</p><p>
    
    So, while I was digging around 1970s New York, I eventually ran into Suicide. Those doo-wop elements that
    defined Patti Smith, the New York-themed lyrical topics, that romantic love of decadence and sleaze all
    made their way into Suicide's equation. There was a fundamental difference, though... those fucking
    synthesizers.</p><p>
    
    See, since I was an angry young person who grew up a bit later than SY, I heard stuff like The Minutemen and
    the Dead Kennedys before I heard The Ramones or Richard Hell. What I was expecting from all of the hype
    regarding ""early punk"" and what it actually <i>sounded like</i> were two very different things. All of that
    brutality and dirt was there, but it wasn't as apparent to me immediately. It just sounded like good 70s
    rock music at first.  Suicide, however, were coming from somewhere different, and they caught me off guard.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to describe the work of Martin Rev and Alan Vega. The indie press seems to deem them the
    harmonious combination between Phil Glass and Elvis. Vega uses lots of reverb on his voice, there's some of
    that rockabilly sleaze in the lyrics and execution, but Elvis he's not. As for Martin Rev, well, the
    repetitive synthesizer figures do have basis in academic music, but the application in Suicide makes those
    sorts of comparisons immaterial. It's essentially some bizarre mutation, built from the same strange spores
    of New York as their peers, yet abstracted through the instrumentation.</p><p>
<i>American Supreme</i> is the first new Suicide album in over a decade. At its best, it's the equivalent
    of mainlining those god-awful HBO late-night b-movies. The lyrics still have that embarrassingly sincere,
    yet caricatured tone, and they're still terminally obsessed with topics of decadence, creepy America, bohemian
    lifestyles, and violence-- all things that Sonic Youth finally left behind on <i>Murray Street</i>.  Musically,
    however, Suicide has started to build something a little more suitable.</p><p>
    
    Rev and Vega's stated intention has always been to reflect their culture and environment, and rather than
    return to their still potent and compelling formula from 30 years ago, Suicide have opted to remain focused
    on their goal. What results is a collection of bastardized house and hip-hop beats, interspersed by the
    occasionally indulgent necessary noise, not even remotely resembling the golden-age bubblegum aspirations
    of their first two albums.</p><p>
    
    The song structure, however, is the same.  Rev has an idea or two, loops it for a five-minute duration, Vega
    sets into action his trademarked ravings, the song ends. This is probably the least effective end of Suicide's
    objectives. To convey that empty, vapid wasteland of Pop, it seems fitting that the songs would drag out,
    emphasize the same ideas over and over again, and leave an unpleasant taste in the listener's mouth.
    <i>American Supreme</i>, even at its most unlistenable and monotonous, still makes its point.</p><p>
    
    Suicide have updated their formula since their most-lauded work. When you listen to their Ocasek-produced
    second album, you can hardly imagine such enjoyable music inciting riots and heckling. With all of those
    synthesizers and blaring house presets mimicking the most commercial aspects of life, this album will not
    get many repeated listens. Yet, <i>American Supreme</i> takes chances, falls on its face and spits in
    yours, sincere and ironic, waving its negative-print, nihilistic flag high.</p></div>"|7557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7557-american-supreme/|7.0|Kim Shannon

I remember growing up with mom's 8-tracks-- James Taylor, Dan Fogelberg, Linda
    Ronstadt-- knowing there must be more to life than soft-rock and the groovy afterthoughts of a
    million baby boomers.  I heard rumblings of a better tomorrow via friends on the outside: Zach had
    Mötley Crüe and Michael Jackson, Jacob's brother had Def Leppard and the <i>Ghostbusters</i>
    soundtrack.  These weren't things I had much access to, though.  A change was required: I had
    to get out. Over the last couple of decades, I've been remedying the musical destitution of my
    youth.  What do I want?  What do <i>we</i> want?  We want freedom.  We want music!</p><p>
    Enter Area, Italy's self-proclaimed ""International Popular Group.""  I would've hated this stuff when
    I was a kid, but now it's obvious that music and freedom were their specialties.  In the early 70s,
    a young sextet from Milano with predominantly jazz backgrounds decided enough was enough, and had a
    go at playing music for the people, but decidedly <i>not</i> for the powers that were.  The band
    would play rock because that was most important to young people, but it was hardly the sound of
    Chuck Berry or the Stones.  In fact, Area would even take jabs at Led Zeppelin, such was their
    confidence of vision.  Truthfully, the band was as bombastic, excessive and indulgent as any
    classic rock or prog gorilla.</p><p>
    But it wasn't the music-- an explosive mixture of fusion-era Miles, avant-garde pianist Cecil Taylor,
    proto-Merzbow noise and even Mediterranean folk dances-- that earned Area initial headlines, and
    kept them in the Italian spotlight throughout the 70s.  Greek vocalist Demetrio Stratos (who later
    worked with John Cage), was possessed of a radically expressive tenor, while Gianni Sassi penned
    words detailing the hypocrisy of the press he considered little more than a tool of a fascist
    Italian government, advocated anarchy, sympathy for the PLO, public protest and the struggle
    against capitalism. Press reports from the time speak of violent outbreaks approaching riots
    at their concerts, and derail the ""banners, gestures and words that reeked of fake slogans,
    just to pass their noisy sounds.""  Fittingly, over ten pages of the box liner notes are devoted
    to the political atrocities of Area's time.  They weren't punk a band in the slightest, but they
    had the persona down pat.</p><p>
<i>Revolution</i> is a newly released box set collecting the first three Area studio releases
    and one live LP.  For fans (you know who you are), it's a treat to hear these 24-bit remasters
    (though I can definitely hear a few vinyl transfer cracks in there), and newcomers couldn't
    ask for a better way to become overnight fanatics.  My caveats: If you go in expecting a full
    on skronk-fest you're going to be disappointed; Area had chops, and restraint wasn't their
    strongest point.  Conversely, if you go in expecting straight fusion or prog, Stratos' sometimes
    primal guttural-isms might scare you away, as might any of a number of synth lobotomies.</p><p>
<i>Arbeit Macht Frei</i> (1973), named for the infamous Nazi labor camp motto, was Area's debut, and
    established their already mastered fusion of, well, fusion, and various strains of the avant-garde.
    ""Luglio, Agosto, Settembre (Nero)"" would seem to be something of a war protest song (though all the
    words are in Italian), bringing to the fore Stratos' Greek heritage alongside its furious odd-meter
    folk-dance figures.  Typically, the band mixes in about a dozen ideas into one riff, strutting the
    stuff of keyboardist Patrizio Fariselli and drummer Giulio Capiozzo in the process, while Stratos'
    booming voice, even when he tries to whisper, threatens to turn each song into rock opera, even
    during free jazz implosions in the middle.  The title track crosses free jazz, minimalism and
    hard rock all in the name of rampant disestablishmentarianism.  If the lengthy solo breaks are too
    much to handle in one sitting, stay tuned.</p><p>
    1974's <i>Caution Radiation Area</i>, with a disturbing/hilarious back cover depicting guerilla fighters
    leaping over an image of the album's cover, trims the fat and leaves only the most radical elements
    of the group's sound intact.  It is arguably the band's best album: ""Cometa Rossa"" is sharp
    refinement of Area's Mediterranean prog hybrid, and its middle section is seems to be straight
    Greek folk-chant; ""ZYG (Crescita Zero)"" introduces some very spacy synth bombs and Stratos'
    alien proclamations, only to erupt with a jam on par with the Mahavishnu Orchestra's best moments.
    However, the most striking piece on the record is the grating closer, ""Lobotomia"".  Featuring
    high-pitched, screaming sine-wave tones, it defies close listening and easy pigeonholing.</p><p>
    1975's <i>Crac!</i> toned down the experimental bend and upped the hard jam a bit, but was no less
    intense for the change.  ""L'Elefante Bianco"" is possibly their best dance jam (and Ares Tavolazzi's
    hyper-elastic bass hits are ace), while ""Le Mela di Odessa"" makes the argument that Italian bands
    can indeed get funky, over and over again, while playing ""Taps"" and ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" at
    totally inappropriate times.  Yeah, shut up, it's great.</p><p>
    That same year, the group released the live <i>Are(A)zione</i>.  Like most of the great fusion bands,
    these guys tore it up live: Most of the tunes sound better here than they did on the studio albums.
    However, Area's political leanings dominate the proceedings on the their rather irreverent take on
    ""L'Internazionale"" (the anthem of the Socialist International), replete with free bass solo and
    raucous group improv, preceded by a whopping fifteen minute group session that should clue you in
    on where their focus actually is.  The crowd loves it, of course, and the press doubtlessly reported
    the entire deviant event.</p><p>
    All of these records are available as single discs, and if I had to choose one as a starter before
    diving into the box it would be <i>Caution Radiation Area</i>.  Still, if you're into this kind of
    thing, it's hard to imagine not wanting all of it.  Along with Magma and the Soft Machine, Area
    played some of the most exciting and adventurous avant-rock in the 70s.  Music and freedom make
    dangerous partners, and you don't need to understand the political implications of the Che Guevara
    portrait on the cover of <i>Revolution</i>, or even understand Italian, to hear the appeal of this
    stuff.</p></div>"|284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/284-revolution/|9.0|Dominique Leone

    but quaint novelty act.  Although other hip-hop groups had used live instrumentation, The Roots
    were the first well-publicized, full-fledged hip-hop band, thus providing fans with a comeback
    when our culturally obtuse friends or relatives would say ""rap isn't music."" The Roots were also
    one of the first acts to speak out against the hip-hop tendency toward hyper-capitalism, a
    criticism which reached its zenith in the hilarious video for ""What They Do"".  But, to paraphrase
    Biggie, things done changed in the hip-hop game. Now live musical accompaniment is becoming
    increasingly prevalent-- The Neptunes donned a backing band for N*E*R*D-- and while political
    consciousness is still an important component of hip-hop, it's hardly unique, and no longer
    <i>en vogue</i> in an increasingly conservative cultural climate.</p><p>
    
    So what are the pioneers to do when they find that their style has been played to the extreme by
    half-assed imitators?  What any true artists would: Submerge themselves in the lab for three years
    and come out with a new, airtight sound, awash with challenging-- but not <i>too</i> challenging--
    deviations from their formula.  For <i>Phrenology</i>, The Roots supplement their trademark loose
    and light jazz palate with harder, more aggressive tones, eschewing their ""organic"" sound and using
    the studio as an instrument. On ""Rock You"", The Roots open with a snarl, as a jagged and spare
    arrangement backs Black Thought's aggressive flow.  As with many songs on <i>Phrenology</i>, ""Rock
    You"" is accented by decidedly inorganic electro flourishes, with a noticeable absence of the smooth
    jazz keys that made hippie hip-hop headz cream their collective jeans back in the mid-to-late-90s.
    Unfortunately, the track contains album's weakest hook, with Black Thought screaming, ""We will rock
    you/ Rock You!/ ROCK YOU!""  Which is exactly what they do on the acerbic, 24-second Bad Brains
    knock-off ""!!!!!!"", a straight-up, raw-as-fuck punk track which I respect for its sheer boldness,
    even if that it had me covering my ears.</p><p>
    
    In sharp contrast, ""Water"" clocks in at well over ten minutes, and is perhaps the first clear cut
    example of mainstream prog-hop.  For hip-hop purists, it's easy to dismiss this song-- which deals
    with former band member Malik B's struggle with addiction-- as needlessly bloated, but given its
    personal subject matter, it's understandable why ?uest and crew indulged themselves in a dark,
    expressionistic foray into the mindset of a drug addict.  We can only hope that Malik gets the
    message.</p><p>
    
    But despite these two extremes, <i>Phrenology</i> can't be boiled down simply to superfluous
    experimentalism or a complete abjuration of their previous work.  It manages to incorporate
    all the elements that have characterized The Roots' sound; they revisit the old-skool hip-hop
    template on the ""apache""-laced ""Thought @ Work"", where Black Thought approximates the
    rapid-fire cadence of Kool G. Rap (one of many examples on <i>Phrenology</i> that have Thought
    switching up his flow to compensate for the loss of Malik B).  For ""WAOK (Ay) Rollcall"", The
    Roots once again enlist Ursula Rucker to give a brief spoken word piece, in which she namechecks
    the architects of hip-hop culture.  However, there's also the overtly political number, ""Pussy
    Galore"", which may be one of the most vapid, boring examples of political consciousness ever
    recorded by a major hip-hop group, and the weakest spot on the album by a long shot.  Hopefully,
    it won't become another source of ammunition in Coca-Cola's campaign to represent/co-opt ""real""
    hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Structurally, there's the now-expected spoken word bit at the end (this time performed by the
    esteemed and controversial poet Amiri Baraka), and a hidden track featuring Talib Kweli.
    It's preceded by two red herrings, twenty-second-long tracks of silence, and followed
    by a brief techno burn that's sure to have fans scratching their heads.  Like ""What They Do""
    from <i>Illadelph Halflife</i> and ""You Got Me"" from <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, the current
    single, ""Break You Off"", is an obligatory three-word R&amp;B; crossover number, replete with guest
    vocalist Musiq's nu-soul crooning, four cellists, a noir concept video, and a $300,000 budget.
    Despite the obvious radio pandering, it's a beautifully smooth and melodic song, featuring
    some of their warmest production ever.</p><p>
    
    To The Roots' credit, they utilize their guest appearances better than on any of their other
    previous efforts.  ""Seed (2.0)"", a cover of a track from L.A. crooner Cody Chesnutt's recent
    <i>Headphone Masterpiece</i>, is the most immediately satisfying track on the album-- which
    is surprising, since it's an orgiastic garage funk number with a blazing guitar riff that
    feels lifted from <i>Sticky Fingers</i>-era Stones.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of how you feel about The Roots' aesthetic-- I tend to gravitate toward the traditional
    two turntables and a microphone hip-hop paradigm-- you have to give these guys credit for making
    an album that so successfully combines ambition and experimentation with accessibility.
    <i>Phrenology</i> completely realizes The Roots' talents and potential, maintaining its
    cohesiveness despite its many disparate elements.  It's a stark rebuke to those who say hip-hop
    artists can't turn out solid full-lengths: For its few negligible missteps, <i>Phrenology</i>
    has more than enough momentum to sustain an uninterrupted listen.</p></div>"|6832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6832-phrenology/|8.1|Sam Chennault

    like they're Refused.  Once in a while, they chooga rather than chugga, and that's
    somehow enough to make them ""avant"" for genre purists.  The emo buff and metal
    shine they for the most part effectively apply also works wonders on non-scenesters,
    with Snapcase patches occupying the same backpack-space as decidedly cuddlier bands.
    For years, they've been inching closer toward commercial breakthrough.</p><p>
    When Dennis Lyxzén of Refused made a similarly inexplicable leap toward convention
    by ditching hardcore completely for The (International) Noise Conspiracy's umlaut-laden
    garage, he at least took with him whatever respectability that band's nebulous roots
    provided, going from something genuinely new and different to something genuinely
    old and familiar (situationist ranting intact).  The new Snapcase, however, is as
    unconvincing and plastic as a band of straightedge Furbies.</p><p>
    Once in a while, I think I hear the old Snapcase peeking out from within the glossy shell
    of <i>End Transmission</i>, twisting like the groovy people-within-people paintings that
    once graced the band's album covers, now sadly-- but appropriately-- replaced by slick,
    blandly futuristic schematics. But before nostalgia can set in, the ravening demons
    of production swoop in, snatching Snapcase in their filthy jaws: Daryl Trabeski's reedy
    yowl is swallowed up in multi-tracking or effects, and guitars that threaten to rip are
    all but absorbed in a dense, featureless wall of sound.  Not that the production ruins
    <i>End Transmission</i>; on the contrary, the gimmicks provide some of the most memorable
    moments-- the stereo-tremolo effect that kicks off ""Believe, Revolt""-- on a album without
    solid enough songwriting to justify the time spent in the studio.</p><p>
    Snapcase still brandishes an impressive portfolio of riffs for a hardcore band, but where they
    once shoved them in your face in turn, they now seem content to let one or two soak in over
    the course of a five-minute song, like vacation pictures at the guitarist's family slideshow.
    The band has also ""matured"", if maturity is measured in glum piano interludes; I might
    be all for a quieter, gentler Snapcase if each sparse, drifting tune didn't end up exploding
    in the exact same way. Even when unpredictable, <i>End Transmission</i> is off-putting: The
    shock of hearing Trabeski scream out the refrain from Modest Mouse's ""Tiny Cities Made of
    Ashes"" (on the coda of ""New Kata"") is quickly replaced by images of a throttled Isaac Brock,
    and a puzzled effort to remember the point at which rote repetition became an acceptable way
    around writer's block.</p><p>
    None of this is to suggest Snapcase have ""sold out""; they're still, as always, on Victory, and if
    anything, their message is even more blunt and extreme.  Did I mention this is a concept album?
    It's a concept album: ""The year is twenty seventy-one!/ One drum by law has just begun-- to beat!""
    While not a reprehensible or calculated stab at crossing over to MTV audiences, <i>End Transmission</i>
    plays as if Snapcase were at least seduced, if not by money or fame, by the security and increased
    utility of bland, clichéd music.  You can't blame them; look how Filter made out on those Hummer ads.</p></div>"|7296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7296-end-transmission/|4.3|Brendan Reid

    home stereo, contemplating their navel to a Pink Floyd soundtrack, the title of this latest outing
    by amoebic beat collective DJ Me DJ You is a tiny bit misleading. Yes, the DVD included with the
    record contains some hilarious lo-fi visuals in the form of found footage and bargain basement Video
    Toaster effects complementing the thrift-store sampling approach intrinsic to the group's composing
    philosophy. And yes, that marriage of image and sound delivers the cocaine disco space opera their
    first full-length, <i>Rainbows and Robots</i>, as promised, but on the audio side of things, group
    masterminds Craig Borrel and Ross Harris have expanded their sound to include an element that
    strains to find a home in the DJ Me DJ You repertoire. As well-versed as Borrel and Ross are, this
    new element does little more than make the album's music that much harder to pull into focus. It
    obstructs rather than illuminates, and the album title becomes a gun to the head rather than a
    prophetic vision.</p><p>
<i>Can You See The Music</i> isn't nearly as ambitious as its full-length predecessor, but its
    approach to instrumentation-- like Dr. Frankenstein stitching the entrails of a million slabs
    of wax into a dancefloor monster-- has been ported over untouched: Dialog snippets lounge in
    fields of Parliament/Funkadelic bass, while drum machines get down with plastic new wave synths
    and tinny beatbox thumps. It's all there, and at its best, it combusts into the <i>Jackie Brown</i>
    swagger of ""Salsa &amp; Microchips"", and the jungle jazz lounge of ""Zodiac Ape"".</p><p>
    
    The misstep here is the addition of something altogether basic: Vocals.  Though they mean a whole
    new bag of tricks for DJ Me DJ You, human flesh doesn't always slide comfortably into the MPC
    playground.  At times, larynxes succumb to the wiles of hard-disk drives and glowing motherboards,
    managing to add to the music rather than block the peephole with their dimpled, wasted asses, but
    for the most part, you just want your quarter back. The acoustic guitar that drives the opener, ""People
    Together"", is an omen of the singer/songwriter damage to come, and while the cribbed-from-Beck irony
    of its lyrics are mildly amusing-- a chorus of ""Sittin' in a sports bar/ Eatin' buffalo wings""-- they
    ultimately relegate the track to the desolate fields of one week's light rotation on college radio.</p><p>
    
    The instrumentation itself is solid, if not a little primed for commercials: some Tijuana horns for
    accent, a lazy pace; a sleepy bar closer in toto.  It's taking musical skill and spilling G. Love's
    not-so-special sauce all over it-- or, the voice doesn't do the track justice. Vocals scars the
    otherwise flawless blaxploitation lowrider ""Fembot"", whose Asian strings, Nintendo 1-Up blings, and
    ready-for-the-sack bass are marred by bad lyrical outtakes from Bob Diggi's ""Love Jones"".  ""Trouble""
    is drowned beneath processed voices which drone the title like a post-headtrip hallucination.</p><p>
    
    When taken along with the corresponding visuals on the DVD, this hit-or-miss collection of odd breeding
    habits is easier to swallow. The stuttering DV footage of old women and Japanese people eating lunch
    that accompany the lyrical swill of ""New You"" highlight the plucked string melody of the track itself,
    sweetening an otherwise bitter pill. <i>Can You See the Music</i> is, in that respect, an important
    milemarker in the growth of the DJ Me DJ You entity.  Machines may have more fun, but musically?
    Musically, this is a record you'll hope they make available in instrumental form.</p></div>"|2369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2369-can-you-see-the-music/|6.5|Mark Martelli

    art, and the liner notation that indicates the lyrics to ""Ghost in a Lost World"" were penned by
    Sandra Davis in 1968, when she was a scant nine years old.  As much appeal as these unabashedly
    sunny touches have in the era of <i>Joe Millionaire</i>, they land the band in a void between
    effortless success and simply trying too hard.</p><p>
    For a good example of the band's soul, look no further than the aforementioned ""Ghost in a Lost World"".
    Though neither the best nor worst track on the record, it manages to bring together all the tendencies
    that sneak into the other songs in less obvious ways. The lyrics-- again, by prepubescent poet Davis--
    are full of haunted little kid images that were Stephen King clichés long before they were rehashed
    in <i>The Ring</i>. Lines like, ""The people are strange creatures/ They do not smile,"" and, ""The
    place they live is just like a blank space on a piece of paper,"" are mildly spooky, but only when
    they come from the mouths of single-digit babes.  Hearing head Cassette Shelby Cinqa sing them is
    about like watching a forty-year old porn actress try to pass herself off as barely legal, and it
    lacks that scenario's tarnished payoff. With vapid acoustic strumming that gets jiggy with nothing,
    and singing that contains all the passion of a recipe for bran muffins, Cinqa turns this presumably
    heartfelt gesture bathetic faster than you can turn off your roommate's copy of <i>August and
    Everything After</i>.</p><p>
    The Cassettes give the impression of being swell people, and they're at least competent, but
    it's difficult to cheer for them as much as one might like, due to their fetish for the
    generic.  Cinqa-- sounding eerily like Spin Doctors frontman Chris Barron-- is nowhere near as
    exceptional as he needs to be to lead a band. He's constructed a warm, lazy sound, lacquering
    his guitar with a healthy dose of distortion and flange, but his parts are so flavorless that,
    beneath the wash of effects, it's hard to hear what rhythm he's playing, or even when he's
    changing chords. The ensuing wall of fuzz is only slightly more compelling than radio static,
    and since everyone can get that for free, it's natural to wonder what segment of the market the
    Cassettes thought they might capture.</p><p>
<i>The Cassettes</i> sounds like it's trying to establish a trademark sound rather than explore
    the limits of artistic expression, which is a wasted effort leading only toward easy and dismissive
    pegging. On a few aberrant cuts-- most notably the jazzy ""Alright with the Days""-- they show real
    inspiration and craftsmanship. It's discouraging how ghettoized they are, but at the very least,
    some bright moments show the group doesn't have to lift all their ideas from nine-year-olds.</p></div>"|1340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1340-the-cassettes/|4.1|Brian James

Seriously, man, we're talking three vicious heads
    spewing radioactive gas and a wingspan that would cover most of a suburban housing development; it
    took both Godzilla and Rodan an entire movie to take this thing on.  Also known as Ghidrah, he
    held unlimited sway over Planet Zero (or Planet X, depending on which translation you're watching),
    a mysterious world found hiding behind Jupiter, where he terrorized the alien residents into
    retreating underground.</p><p>
    Needless to say, respect is due, and you had better bring something to the table when you're naming
    your record after this thing.  I don't want to hear any demure soft rock or whiny emo band
    tossing the name around like it doesn't mean anything; Monster Zero could scorch the very earth
    you walk on with his breath, and your music has to be able to match his legacy to legitimately
    carry his name.</p><p>
    And where many would fail, Voyager One ultimately succeed, crafting an album with a sound just
    prickly and bombastic enough to do old Ghidrah justice.  Guitars with a half-life of about 10,000
    years soar and strafe, while Tony Zuniga's drums flatten the landscape.  The whole record sounds
    like it was recorded in an immense cavern, with a dense mix slathered in huge reverb.  For most of
    the album, Voyager One comprises five people generating as much sound as possible, employing loops,
    keyboards, guitars, samples, voices, horns, cello, and truckloads of drums.</p><p>
    You'd never guess this racket was churned up in Seattle; it sounds in every way more like something
    you'd expect from Oxford or Manchester, right down to the vocals, which have a distinctly British
    inflection, if not an outright accent.  In fact, vocalist Peter Marchese at times seems to consciously
    avoid a British accent, as though his voice wants to affect one, but he holds back with all his
    willpower.  It's easy to see why that accent would be tempting, as the British have held a near-total
    monopoly on this kind of music for nigh on a decade now, and Marchese's head is likely full of
    Swervedriver, Slowdive, Ride, and My Bloody Valentine melodies.</p><p>
<i>Monster Zero</i> opens and closes floating in space, beginning with the gauzy textures of ""Out in
    the Marketplace"" and ending in a dead drift out past the solar system's furthest reaches, through
    asteroids and tiny proto-planets on the guitar haze of ""Praise the Lowered"" and ""Tokyoidaho"".  In
    between, things are much meatier, with stomping extraterrestrial anthems like ""Wires"" and ""Ready. Reset.""
    layering heavy guitar effects over insistent bass lines and pounding Bonham-isms.</p><p>
    Voyager One delivers a space-rock outing that brings just as much rock as space to your speakers,
    a balance that's not often achieved.  Furthermore, it slaughters their 2000 debut <i>From The New Nation
    Of Long Shadows</i>, which was already pretty good to begin with.  Monster Zero may have been defeated
    in the end, but he was mighty, and this album is an honorable tribute.</p></div>"|8501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8501-monster-zero/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    the counter-culture's answer to chain-smoking.  This is absolute gospel truth.  Try as we might,
    and directly in the face of myriad warnings telling us to stray from the ills of cigarette smoke
    and those fire-branding demons of metal, there are still thousands upon thousands of us sucking
    down butts and banging our heads like morons every single day.</p><p>
    
    With Surgeon General's  warning labels, The Insider, iron lungs, and television commercials featuring
    skinny hipster kids on street corners trying to convince us that Philip Morris is still pulling
    the wool over the eyes of a few muddle-headed sheep, we've got ample incentive to avoid those
    delightful little cylinders of tar like the plague.  But every once in a while, something comes
    along to rekindle the flame. Whether it's a fantastic metal album or a found carton of Chesterfields,
    we'll take the opportunity to heave the largest cloud of nicotine right in your faces, because we
    know it prays upon your puritanical self-hatred, and in plain black and white, we know you hate it.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately for those who enjoy blowing smoke in the faces of their friends and family, an
    ultra-carcinogen called <i>Lucid Interval</i> was created this past August, by gore-metal
    Ubermensches Cephalic Carnage.  Mutating equal parts grind, fusion jazz, prog, and hardcore
    might seem ludicrous-- it's bombastic, loud, and impulsive-- but this is one of the most brutal,
    technically sophisticated, and unabashed Metal records I've heard in a very long time.</p><p>
    
    Stretching death metal to its absolute limit has always been the primary interest of Colorado's
    Cephalic Carnage.  Previous releases <i>Conforming to Abnormality</i> and <i>Exploiting Dysfunction</i>
    laid the groundwork for this genesis to absurdity, combining the gory brutality of their peers in
    Cock and Ball Torture, the death metal comedic ethos of Cannibal Corpse, and the sweeping chaos of
    Exhumed.  <i>Lucid Interval</i> finds Cephalic Carnage pushing its earlier dynamic to the fullest
    extreme, with mind-blowing results. </p><p>
    
    From the opening seconds of ""Scolopendra Cingulata"", it's painfully apparent this album
    is an aneurysm waiting to happen.  Introducing high frequency trepanation in the vein of Whitehouse,
    a meticulous grind and seismic bass slowly give way to the horrifying growls of vocalists Lenzig
    (lead vocals) and Jawash (also on bass) during the album's second track, ""Fortuitous Oddity"". </p><p>
    
    Lenzig has the ability to move between the guttural growls of grindcore-- the kind of stuff that
    sounds like a herd of pigs slaughtering Farmer Bill and his wife-- and the high-pitched
    screams of noisecore, while the band follows every vocal nuance apace.  With violent death metal
    riffs degenerating into mock blues, then back to blistering hammerbeat in a matter of seconds,
    Cephalic Carnage have taken a fairly conventional New York death metal aesthetic and twisted it
    into a sound so much more advanced and sinewy than that of their contemporaries.  Drummer John
    (who oddly enough bears a passing resemblance to Moby) blasts through double-kick and syncopated
    jazz licks with mathematical precision and power, while guitarists Zak and Steve race up and down
    the fretboard inexhaustibly.  There's nothing close to a missed note here, no indication of
    timidity or restraint: <i>Lucid Interval</i> is simply a brutal, a furious, abrasive forty-five
    minutes of the very best experimental grindcore.</p><p>
    
    This is an album of faux starts and stops, limitless innovation, and full-on cranial overload.
    ""Pseudo"" is their foray into avant-garde jazz territory, replete with sounds pulled right out of
    the Mego catalog; the humorously titled ""Black Metal Sabbath"" combines that genre's shrieks with
    the stoner drone of labelmates High on Fire.  The title track features Swedish metal crescendos
    in the style of Marduk and Bathory, while ""Arsonist Savior"" utilizes gore-grind electronics-- a
    la Catasexual Urge Motivation-- and the power chord harmonics of Incantation.  Hell, there's even
    a fifty second mariachi interlude called ""Cannibism"".</p><p>
    
    For all you metalheads and smokers out there, sit back, light up, and enjoy this masterpiece from
    Cephalic Carnage.   <i>Lucid Interval</i> displays the band's full panoply of disparate styles and
    influences with deft originality and quality, sans any indication of softening its brutal
    exoskeleton.  In case anyone around you starts to cough, wheeze, or gasp for breath, remember
    the immortal words of Bill Hicks: ""non-smokers die every single day.""

    which revel in the same swooning orchestration that rock music all but abandoned after the 1970s.  But it
    seems every year, he's got another up his sleeve, never much different than the last, and with repeated
    exposure to these kinds of grandiose epics, the newness has worn off, leaving many of his productions to
    join their cousins Wilco and Elliott Smith in a genre I describe as, well, indie adult-contemporary.</p><p>
    
    Don't take offense yet-- I think indie adult-contemporary is a fine idea, and I've loved far too many of
    these records to get snobby about it. It's just a fact: This is the music that may eventually prompt your
    preteen kids to roll their eyes and make unenthusiastic noises when you force them to listen during long
    car trips. Jeff Tweedy may become your Sting, Wayne Coyne your Peter Gabriel, Mercury Rev your Steely Dan--
    and there's no reason any of this will be any less wonderful than the Carole King LPs in your parents
    basements. But at some point, I realized my shelves were filling up with this stuff, and even though I
    knew I'd find every new release of it perfectly lovely, it seemed more rewarding to look into something
    else.</p><p>
    
    I mention this not to pick on anyone's favorite albums, but because the great flaw in my personal No More
    Indie Adult-Contemporary plan turned out to be The Delgados. The Delgados' secret weapon, from their early
    noise-pop days to their big breakthrough with <i>The Great Eastern</i>, has always been a peculiarly Scottish
    penchant for resigned, anthemic melodies: Suffice it to say that if ""Auld Lang Syne"" had not existed, this
    band probably would have written it and then made it kick, hard. The tracks on <i>The Great Eastern</i>
    started off with either Alun Woodward or Emma Pollock doing gorgeous mumbly sing-songs, but most of them
    quickly burst open to the two of them singing in big, wistful, drunken mug-waving unison. Better yet, that
    was the album's focus, with the swoony schmaltz-experiments Fridmann usually abets providing only the
    thinnest layer of icing.</p><p>
    
    And I mention all of that to say this: It's a testament to the general greatness of The Delgados that I'm
    as captivated as I am by <i>Hate</i>, despite its suffering under the weight of a much more prevalent layer
    of faux-classicism-- by which I mean loads of gratuitous pokes at the ""swoon"" button. It also leans a bit
    obviously into those slow-building anthems, which you can take either as a glorious celebration of the band's
    strengths or a sort of grating repetition: Here's the one that starts with just piano then builds to a big
    stormy climax, and here's the one that starts with just guitar and builds to a big stormy climax, and so on.
    All of which winds up being beside the point, because <i>Hate</i> is a different thing.  <i>Hate</i> is a
    spiteful, disappointed, hoping-to-be-hopeful record, wherein even the most Delgados-by-numbers builds run
    up not into glowing chants but into desperate, wounded crooning. And then they do it again, and again,
    but each time, there's something about the big beating heart underneath that makes those hooks sink in,
    and deep.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the biggest successes here are the moments when the band still surprises you, and most stunning
    is ""Coming in from the Cold"", which drops the epic orchestration in favor of a detour through the pop-anthem
    territory where you'd usually find Travis or Coldplay. The differences, in this case, are that (a) this song
    contains a hook I can't imagine anyone not falling for, and that (b) Emma, who gets to deliver it, does a
    great job of supporting my argument that she's one of the best and most affecting vocalists going. The other
    big surprise comes in the form of a deeply cynical Beatles pastiche-- on ""All You Need is Hate"", which starts
    out sprightly like ""She's Leaving Home"" and then launches into a fascinating Delgados version of the Beatles'
    R&amp;B; strut. Following that is ""The Child Killers""-- I told you this was wounded and bleak-- one of the least
    hopeful piano ballads you're likely to hear this side of Rufus Wainwright.</p><p>
    
    Do some of the more standard-issue runs seem a bit labored? They do: ""Never Look at the Sun"" has a climax
    that sounds great but never really catches; ""Coalman"" fails to compensate for its pointlessly over-orchestrated
    interludes, even with its closing Stereolab impersonation; ""All Rise"" is just a vague variation on <i>The
    Great Eastern</i>'s ""Aye Today"". But the emotion buzzing out of these songs keeps a great number of them
    stunning, like indie-friendly versions of scores from period epics or superhero movies: ""If This is a Plan""
    starts off like the mellow end of <i>OK Computer</i> and then erupts into a string-drenched gale so stirring
    that even Alun's two-ton melody has to claw its way in, and ""The Drowning Years"" aspires to Creed-like levels
    of bombast and actually succeeds.</p><p>
    
    And that's the redeeming attribute of <i>Hate</i>, the extra-musical one: Some great dramatic reckoning of
    hope and despair is going on between its lines, and that's what's important. I could write a thousand more
    words on how disappointed I am with The Delgados for verging on making Just Another Indie Adult-Contemporary
    Record, but hey-- if more people in that genre were making music that seemed to be grasping at emotions as
    important as this, I might not have sworn off of it in the first place.</p></div>"|2266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2266-hate/|8.1|Nitsuh Abebe

    a jazz album augmented with beats and synths.  He's not the only top-drawer jazzbo making serious
    use of electronica; more and more bands are mixing the acoustic with the electric and the improvised
    with the processed, from labelmates Spring Heel Jack to the glitched-up fusion of Norway's Jaga
    Jazzist.  Shipp may not be the first or most adventurous, but he made a tasteful, logical album
    that still boasted fat bass and catchy riffs.</p><p>
    His latest disc, <i>Equilibrium</i>, also uses the synth work and production of FLAM (Chris Flam).  But
    instead of pushing the electronics and making a funkier, nastier successor to his hit, this new
    disc feels like nothing so much as the Modern Jazz Quartet.  FLAM's additions are more subtle, and
    instead of a horn player, the rotating sideman this time is Khan Jamal, whose stately, ringing
    vibraphone perfectly complements Shipp's pensive lines.</p><p>
    Shipp has explained that this is the ""synthesis"" of the directions he's been taking lately; free-floating,
    hot, straight, electrified: It's a chance to double back and get everything right.  For Shipp, that
    means this may be his most carefully perfected album, which in this guy's case is not a dismissal.
    While Shipp can sprawl vivaciously next to the right partner-- like fire-breathing tenor
    giant David S. Ware-- his own work often veers towards the cerebral and angular.  His tunes sound like
    they're composed on graph paper, and although the titles have a sci-fi vibe, they don't conjure up the
    Funkadelic Mothership as much as 1950s Arthur C. Clarke: names like ""Nebula Theory"", ""Cohesion"" and
    ""World of Blue Glass"" imply scientists floating past abandoned spaceships and gigantic blocks of ice.</p><p>
    The cool veneer can distract from the variety on this disc.  The nine compositions each take a
    different mood and strategy, as the band jumps from the ballad ""World of Blue Glass"" to Jamal's
    fiery showcase ""Vamp to Vibe"", then to the beats and distorted horn samples that funk up ""The
    Root"". Yet they're as concise and blocked off as tanks at an aquarium: Each one makes its point
    in around five minutes, and none lasts a second too long.</p><p>
    Shipp brings along the same rhythm section as his last few dates, with bassist William Parker and
    Gerald Cleaver on drums.  Much has been written about Parker, one of Shipp's longest-running and
    most compatible partners, but it's Cleaver who intrigues me more than ever before when he matches
    FLAM's beats with a mechanical crispness, or plays a subtle but erratic rhythm under the otherwise
    tranquil title track.  Jamal is the newest performer to this group, and the most welcome surprise:
    A sorely under-recorded talent who has played since the 60s, he has worked with Billy Bang, Sunny
    Murray and the Ronald Shannon Jackson Decoding Society.  On this date, he's an impeccable soloist--
    for example, the straight-but-shimmering blues of ""The Key""-- and also a stellar improviser, whose vibes
    help color the abstract sections.</p><p>
    Yet this record is defined by the production as much as the improvisation, and it's FLAM who turns
    out to be the most insidious component.  You can hear what he's done to ""Nu Matrix"", as Jamal's
    sustained tones are stretched into an aurora borealis, while Shipp is dropped deep into the sea;
    the samples on ""The Root"" further echo his contributions to <i>Nu-Bop</i>.  But like Shipp, he's more
    restrained this time: In fact, his work can be so subtle that it plays tricks on you.  Did he
    engineer the brief fade-outs on ""Vamp to Vibe"", or the start of ""The Root"", or is it just the band?
    Even on ""World of Blue Glass"", when a high note from the piano sparks a sudden bright sound, you almost
    wonder if FLAM added (or exaggerated) it.  With this guy lurking around, no detail on the record
    seems accidental.</p><p>
    With <i>Equilibrium</i>, Shipp has created a puzzle box, full of nuanced performances and cryptic details.
    It's not his most passionate work, but it's the closest to perfect, so precisely constructed that
    every note invites attention.  With his next big step a month away-- his much-anticipated face-off
    against the hip-hop act Anti-Pop Consortium-- an album like <i>Equilibrium</i> could look careful,
    like a retreat.  But why overshoot when you can hit your mark to three decimal places?</p></div>"|7118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7118-equilibrium/|7.9|Chris Dahlen

    essentially paved the way for any and all future experimentation within a pop/rock format.  By exploding the
    typical guitar rock structure with a cataclysm of prepared guitar and computer enhancements, bands like My
    Bloody Valentine, Lush, and Swervedriver found a means of juxtaposing avant-garde rock with minimalist drone.
    Finding themselves mislabeled as ""shoegazers,"" these musicians melded the most salient elements of both genres--
    a concatenation of tape motifs and the natural timbre of acoustic instruments-- with mesmerizing results.
    While contemporary acts like Sigur Rós and Mogwai have co-opted an ethereal framework (the latter even for
    a Levi's commercial), these shards of a hypnotic landscape have never quite captured the emotive might of
    its antecedents.</p><p>
    Enter Glifted, a two-piece out of Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, composed of former Hum guitarist Tim Lash and
    former Lovecup bassist T.J. Harrison.  While Lash was relegated primarily to a background figure in Hum,
    providing skilled guitar ambience and blistering leads behind singer/guitarist/übermensch Matt Talbott,
    Glifted's <i>Under and In</i> not only establishes Lash's creative brilliance, but kicks the dust off a
    genre that had lay dormant since <i>Loveless</i>.  Indeed, <i>Under and In</i> is so teemed with technical
    fluency and power that it essentially modernizes and revitalizes the entire shoegazer sensibility.</p><p>
    With experimental rock/minimalism stalled under the weight of over-production, theatrical missteps, and
    lyrical gibberish, Glifted's debut offering manages to inject some excitement into a genre that's found
    itself on auto-pilot for most of the past decade.  Instead of attempting the standard dreamy space-rock
    aesthetic of comparable modern day acts, Lash and Harrison move in a wholly unique direction.  Utilizing a
    pointedly more minimalist approach to song composition, grouping ample numbers of segmented tape loops
    a la Terry Riley with a wall of guitar (and effects processors) in tight precision; <i>Under and In</i>
    sounds like an epiphany.</p><p>
    Beginning with the Steve Reich-influenced vocal drone of ""Is There Any Always"", Glifted weaves a creative
    patchwork of limitless textures and hypnoses built upon an otherwise tenuous foundation of noise and sonic
    abstraction.   With Lash's incoherent vocals sounding like George Harrison on Thorazine, a staccato guitar
    riff swirls on at perpetuity as Tubeway Army keyboards work their way up the listener's spinal column and
    into his cortex.  T.J. Harrison's searing basslines complement the brutal beat-- the audience is caressed by
    Lash's ambient drone while simultaneously battered by ferocious percussion.</p><p>
    On ""Baby's Blue"", Glifted presents an obvious homage to the likes of Can and Cluster, annealing Harrison's
    grooving bass with a synthetic wash of ride cymbals, jazzy guitar, and digital manipulation.  ""Baby's Blue""
    evolves slowly and subtly from a repetitive funk drum pattern, gradually expanding its orchestration before
    culminating in a flare of synthesizer that nearly drowns the accompanying rhythm.  With the Moog finally on
    the verge of engulfing the song, ""Baby's Blue"" promptly fades out and leads into ""Heavy Ion"", a sub-two-minute
    instrumental built on a heavily distorted version of the very same bassline.   The pairing of these two tracks
    illustrates Glifted's ability to flesh out thematics by cycling them rapidly through numerous incarnations
    and styles, one of their strongest attributes.</p><p>
<i>Under and In</i> is an album devoid of wasted notes, self-indulgence, and contrived atmosphere.  Every
    hallucinogenic element seems to flow unconsciously from the ether, titillate, and vanish without a trace.
    ""Every Single Second"" bears a distinct resemblance to material from Hum's final album, <i>Downward Is
    Heavenward</i>, but where the 1998 release often stumbled from protracted noodling, ""Every Single Second""
    is a concise statement adding The Byrds' psych-rock haze to a sparse Matt Talbott riff.</p><p>
    ""Last in Line"" also recalls Lash's work with Hum, but adds levels of subsonic depth and impressionistic
    harmonic tendencies invisible in the Hum catalog.  ""The Ground"" is a throbbing mass of impending hysteria--
    a nightmarish maelstrom of seething pink noise, super-colliding vocals and guitars, granulation and reverb.
    At once beautiful and horrific, ""The Ground"" is both a howling ode to the innovation of Kevin Shields, and
    a shrieking reproval of his limitations.</p><p>
    Parallels will inevitably be drawn between Glifted and Matt Talbott's new band Centaur, who also released
    their debut album in late 2002.  It must be noted, however, that the only case for comparison is the band
    that put them both on the map.  Artistically and dynamically, Talbott and Tim Lash have moved in entirely
    different directions with ostensibly different objectives.  Centaur's <i>In Streams</i> is an excellent rock
    album demonstrating Talbott's talents as a songwriter, but it suggests no real upward mobility.  Tim Lash's
    <i>Under and In</i> exhibits an understanding of musical plasticity that eludes the former Hum frontman.
    In taking the anachronism of ""shoegazing"" and fusing it with the ambient plurality of people like Ekkehard
    Ehlers and Rafael Toral, Glifted have unveiled one of the most compelling noise-pop records I've ever
    encountered.</p></div>"|3465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3465-under-and-in/|8.6|Isaiah Violante

    Criticism is often misconstrued, and the mere mention that a group is comprised solely of women can
    generate an insatiable barrage of hateful e-mails-- ask any writer who's ever tackled a Sleater-Kinney
    album.  I wanted to approach The Donnas without making the obvious ""[70s metal group] fronted by [80s
    pop diva]"" comparison, and more importantly, I didn't want to objectify the four Donnas as sexual and
    musical creatures prowling what some mysogynistic critics would refer to as ""a man's jungle.""  But after
    spinning <i>Spend the Night several times, it's clear The Donnas could objectify themselves more
    in 40 minutes than I could in 900 words.</i></p><p>
    There's a scene in <i>This Is Spinal Tap</i> that I think appropriately relates to The Donnas. It's perhaps
    a clichéd reference, but recalling the moment Tap's manager Ian Faith explains that Duke Fame's recent
    album art isn't sexist because Duke's the one being victimized, there's that famous David St. Hubbins
    realization: ""There's such a fine line between clever and stupid.""  Foolish artistic license overshadows
    any moral or sexual responsibility, regardless of gender, and while The Donnas may play the role of
    commanding women in a men's world, their music is too lifeless to sow any inspirational seeds.</p><p>
    Make no mistake, <i>Spend the Night defies any post-liberation role reversal debate: The album, both
    musically and lyrically, is so one-dimensional, it would be equally vapid at the hands of either sex.
    Sure, The Donnas have chops; Tommy Lee is a pretty fucking good drummer, but that's no reason to buy a
    Mötley Crüe record. The simple fact is, ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" would be just as pointless if it were called
    ""Boys, Boys, Boys"" and released at the height of schlock-rock's 21st century comeback.</i></p><p>
    The real problem is how The Donnas limit themselves by being ""fun."" No one expects or wants every modern
    rock album to be a broody, isolated masterpiece, but the songs on <i>Spend the Night</i> revolve (or
    devolve) around three main themes: 1) Getting liquored up and makin' it with some guy; 2) Getting liquored
    up and running into some guy that had his chance to make it with The Donnas, but didn't; or 3) Talking trash
    about some girl that The Donnas don't like, usually because she keeps them from getting liquored up.  All
    of this may sound ridiculous, but that must be the lyrical price you pay for having <i>every couplet
    on the album rhyme.  The ""drinkin' it and makin' it"" image portrayed by The Donnas may be apt due to the
    career they've made of constant touring, but that doesn't mean anyone wants to hear it sung over every
    pentatonic riff ever written, thirteen times in a row. As a result of this insipid subject matter, the
    only thing that came to mind while listening to </i><i>Spend the Night was Dudley ""Booger"" Dawson's
    prophetic </i><i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> exclamation: ""You Mu's sure can party!""</p><p>
    The Donnas regurgitate a plethora of metal riffs, and for some that may be charming, but the music falls
    flat because the girls take more than just musical cues from the 70s metal-heads-- they embrace their overt
    use of sexual conquest (or frustration) as subject matter.  Without injecting any sort of originality or
    voice (other than simply being women), The Donnas transform forgettable cock-rock into forgettable tit-rock.
    If you consider name-checking Boy Scouts, Miss Cleo, and Z. Cavaricci's entertaining, buckle up: You're in
    for the ride of your life. </p><p>
    But there's an aspect of <i>Spend the Night</i> that's even sadder than the music on it: This is The Donnas'
    fifth album, and they've just now begun to receive airplay on modern rock radio and MTV, without ever
    changing their sound.  Why?  Warner Brothers. I guess if you have nowhere else to go musically, and your
    sound is suddenly ""marketable,"" the only thing left to do is sign to a major label.  I'm not one to cry
    sellout here, though, because for one, they certainly haven't changed their original sound in the name of
    commercialism, and two, they deserve to be soaked up by the masses.  If nothing else, they've paid their
    dues.</p><p>
    I honestly can't figure out if The Donnas have tapped the pure heart and soul of rock 'n' roll and
    it's just not poignant anymore, or if <i>Spend the Night is one of the worst rock 'n' roll albums
    I've ever heard.  But The Donnas know, and whether rock's dead or not, they're gonna cash a few checks,
    laughing (at me) all the way to the bank.</i></p></div>"|2420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2420-spend-the-night/|2.9|Kyle Reiter

    one might expect a self-assured thoroughbred with Wilco's inventive savvy and Jim O'Rourke's art-school
    raffishness.  Recorded during downtime on <em>Foxtrot</em> and refined in the two years since, however, this
    experiment mostly serves to reinforce what we're already well aware of: Jeff Tweedy's formidable strength
    as a songwriter, the pervasive nuance of O'Rourke's by-now trademark production, and Glenn Kotche's
    unconventional, sometimes overly ambitious approach to percussion.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, the most predictable elements of <em>Loose Fur</em> are its most ""arty"" and ""experimental""-- songs
    that either follow the laws of entropy and dissolve in a rising swell of dissonance (opener ""Laminated Cat"")
    or defy them entirely, allowing melodies to emerge gradually from the sonic clutter (""So Long"").  Despite
    its relative brevity (six cuts over forty minutes), <em>Loose Fur</em> establishes a familiar pattern early
    on, and it's actually the more conventional music-- exhibiting Tweedy and O'Rourke's common soft spot for
    classic rock-- that leaves a more lasting impression.</p><p>
    
    ""Laminated Cat"" will be instantly recognizable to Wilco archivists as a more sedate reading of the
    <em>Foxtrot</em> castoff ""Not for the Season"".  In its original incarnation the song was a somewhat generic
    rocker grafted with an unfortunate sub-Brian Wilson arrangement; here it's a functional scene-setter drawn
    by loops of distorted guitar and gently evocative laptopery into an improbable seven-minute jam.  Tweedy's
    lyrics are mostly incidental to the tidal pull of the rhythm and O'Rourke's otherworldly fuzz-- a stoner's
    recognition of time passing exponentially faster, years spent accumulating piles of books ""not worth reading.""
    Kotche's percolating thumps grow progressively (and predictably) louder as the tune ambles self-consciously
    towards the imploding plastic inevitable.  Close, but no Andy Warhol-lithographed banana.</p><p>
    
    The Tweedy-helmed ""You Were Wrong"" fares much better, pitching squalls of dissonant harmonics over a relatively
    simple guitar/bass/drums groove, a piano stumbling drunkenly in the distance.  The melody seems to hover
    uncertainly, then lurch forward in the clutches of some unseen gravity.  Tweedy and O'Rourke are collaboratively
    at their best here, with O'Rourke's guitar chiming color commentary between the acerbic lyrics.  ""You were
    wrong to believe in me,"" Tweedy's dejected protagonist insists in a clever variation on the <em>Pet Sounds</em>
    chestnut.  Tweedy punctuates the enigmatic imagery of the verses with heart-on-sleeve frankness in the choruses,
    an exorcism of the ghosts that stubbornly linger after a dead relationship: ""When you leave, you're not gone.""</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Loose Fur's chemistry is not quite as strong with the shoe on the other foot: Tweedy swaps
    cheeky non-sequiturs like, ""You don't know where that phone's been,"" and, ""Back in the saddle again,"" with
    O'Rourke on the latter's ""Elegant Transaction"", a hyperkinetic pastiche of guitar, bells, and off-kilter
    percussion.  Perhaps it's unfair to compare O'Rourke's cut-and-paste songwriting with Tweedy's urban-troubadour
    approach, but the incongruity between the two can be jarring-- the pitched earnestness of O'Rourke's voice
    sounds as thin as Dan Fogelberg next to Tweedy's.</p><p>
    
    O'Rourke's ""So Long"" buries its rather lovely guitar figure behind a virtually impregnable barricade of
    randomly crashing and clicking percussion-- glass shaken in boxes, tambourines chattering, alarm clocks
    being wound, an unschooled guitar improvising ugly discordant figures in the extreme foreground.  In direct
    contrast to the rest of the album, the melody insinuates itself gradually through repetition, overcoming
    the blatant wankery of the avant-jazz setup and succumbing to a chorus of lite-rock ""da-da-da""'s right out
    of Stereolab and 1975.  ""Say so long to yourself,"" O'Rourke implores in the choruses, ""it's so wrong to go
    on.""  And yet, go on it does-- for nine minutes, in fact, as O'Rourke laboriously pulls the song into focus.
    ""Liquidation Totale"" follows, a pleasantly engaging instrumental juxtaposing rushes of acoustic guitar with
    an urgent electric riff and pleasant detours on banjo and electric guitar.  The song, however, does little
    but preface closer ""Chinese Apple"", again ending in a not-entirely-unexpected clusterfuck of noise.</p><p>
    
    ""Chinese Apple"" is <em>Loose Fur</em>'s strongest offering-- by far, Tweedy and O'Rourke's most successful
    merger of art and accessibility.  It even nicks a few lines from ""Heavy Metal Drummer"", recasting <em>Foxtrot</em>'s
    Magnetic Poetry nonchalance in a pastoral twilight rarely seen from Tweedy since the rural melodramas of
    Uncle Tupelo. The track builds on a repeating guitar figure reminiscent of Nick Drake's ""Which Will"",
    Tweedy's uncommonly warm voice buoyed by the propulsive current of melody beneath.  Suddenly, the music
    becomes much darker, and the sleepy-eyed flow of Tweedy's prose careens into an epiphany of impressionistic
    flashes: ""Between the branches, flowering chance/ Fence lights rattling, fingers pushing through/ Slowly
    brushing past a fast glimpse of you.""  Acoustic guitars swell and accelerate; spectral percussion crashes
    distantly in the gathering storm. The heartbeat of the kickdrum keeps the vessel on course with its
    persistent lighthouse thump, and eventually the original guitar figure returns unscathed-- brighter,
    actually, more assertive.  The song devolves gradually, with a descending keyboard figure reminiscent of
    <em>Foxtrot</em>'s ""Poor Places"" and the ambient rattle of Kotche's brushes swishing like an outgoing tide.</p><p>
    
    Fans of <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> will no doubt find <em>Loose Fur</em> an indispensable companion piece,
    as much of the music found here occupies roughly the same static-frosted moonscape as ""Radio Cure"".  Despite
    its deliberate obliqueness, <em>Loose Fur</em> illustrates with clarity just what Tweedy and O'Rourke were up
    to in those wee hours when Tweedy could no longer face the chaos of <em>Foxtrot</em> and Jay Bennett's endless
    embellishments.  Given the option of editing together the best of a dozen-plus guitar takes for ""Kamera""
    and horsing around with music as lovely as ""Chinese Apple"" or ""You Were Wrong"" with O'Rourke and Kotche,
    which would you choose?  Ah, distance has a way of making love understandable.</p></div>"|4853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4853-loose-fur/|7.2|Will Bryant

    but that I was one of the only single guys around. Usually that kinda info I could keep to myself, changing
    in the locker room when everyone else was out to lunch and whatnot. The more astute boys soon noticed, though,
    and while I was gently heckled about it, they did their best to help, setting me up on blind dates with their
    cousins, sisters, and exes.  But to no avail.  Then our glorious editor hisself greased my palms with this
    disc of lost singles and found reel-tapes from Gary Wilson, saying, ""Beck name-checked him, dude, he's like
    the white Prince. Pure Game."" He also slipped me some Horny Goat Weed and said, ""You can thank me later,
    <i>Oz</i>-style."" With my hair dippity-dooed, my jeans pressed, and my shirt tucked in, I was ready for a
    night out, with <i>Forgotten Lovers</i>, a collection of various Wilson recordings dating from 1973-1982,
    just waiting on the hi-fi for my return.</p><p>
    
    Bringing that groovy chick Cindy home, I cued up ""Dream(s)"", turning my little room into something right out
    of a <i>Kojak</i> love scene. The shag carpet was growing right out of my floorboards while Wilson got to
    sputtering such choice advice as ""girls are cool for kissin' when the hour strikes twelve."" Oh yes. I took
    him at his word and made my smooth move as his backing band, The Blind Dates, jerked a fuzzy sort of funk
    rhythm that somehow turned everything slightly prog. She wasn't really digging on the Steely Dan scene, but
    I said, ""It's cool, baby,"" as that fat synth bass straddling the line between Curtis Mayfield's superfly
    porn and cheesy Atari blips came back around, and I knew that I was home free.</p><p>
    
    But then, ""Chrome Lover"".  The timbales had the vibe going, but the scene got interrupted by Wilson's snotty
    come-on: ""Hey, why don't you just drop dead, huh?""  The remark was followed by some strangulated ""make out""
    commands, followed by piercing free jazz cries, completely off-the-hook phone operators, and the sound of a
    main-vein draining.  This schizophrenic shit completely salted my game!  I got slapped a good one as she left,
    too, leaving me alone to enjoy the odd hiccups of ""Sick Trip"", which came off like Michael Stipe doing a
    Charlie Feathers impression before segueing into a straight piano jazz ballad with a stand-up bass. ""I
    Wanna Take You on a Sea Cruise"" was like Sun Ra leering in cocktail lounge at a 17-year old, and veering
    very close to Wilson's classic ""6.4 = Make Out"" in the process. I was filled with longing when the perverse
    tape-slurred whispers of, ""You are my girlfriend-- that entitles me to one kiss,"" crept up at the end of
    the album. Maybe I could call Cindy later and leave that part on her answering machine?</p><p>
    
    Gary Wilson successfully jumped between new wave synth spasms, soundtrack jazz and skronk, James Brown pep,
    noise collage, pre-Prince strut, and the Jonathan Richman School of Painfully Geeky Lyricism way back in the
    mid-70s, as evidenced here. Then again, so did <i>You Think You Really Know Me</i>, and a lot of the finest
    moments here are executed on that record in a slightly more deranged manner. I can't say if there's room
    enough for two Gary Wilson records in the bachelor pad, but as I sit here now with this steak on my eye, I
    wonder if the boys at the Pitchfork office weren't just trying to put me on a sick trip or something.</p></div>"|8695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8695-forgotten-lovers/|6.4|Andy Beta

It's as if Ikara Colt ran down a checklist from the back of the
    <i>NME</i> on how to be a British punk band: They met at art school, they dress sharp, and they sound
    glum. They crib from the best post-punk and noise-rock, and every track on their debut gets a perfect
    score for pop songform and speedy hook delivery.  They're a hit in Britain, and if they become chic
    enough, one of them might land a date with Kelly Osbourne.</p><p>
    
    So what's wrong with them, aside from the fact I could pack up their album in a single paragraph?
    Ikara Colt are the latest straight-up decent punk act to get shipped across the pond, and they're
    a genuine example of ""authentic rock"": Distorted guitars, curt lyrics and a pummeling rhythm section,
    funneled into concise, riffy singles.  Even the recording sounds just as it should, lo-fi but
    clear, raw but just short of spastic.</p><p>
<i>Chat and Business</i> is undeniably solid, but we don't give high scores for just doing the job, and
    the album has shortcomings.  At the top of the list, it doesn't have much personality.  You'll have
    to forgive me; I've never seen the band live, watched them on a talk show or read about their sex lives
    in a British newspaper.  For all I know, they could be a font of charisma back where they come from.
    I only have the album to work with, and it's dangerously familiar.  It's derivative, and too easily
    defined by the ""recommended if you like"" list it invites.</p><p>
    
    Vocalist Paul Resende is both a strength and a shortcoming.  You'll recognize his style from the work
    of Mark E. Smith and many others, and he has the chops to get the job done; he has a masculine scream,
    and the right voice for shout-singing.  But the conviction sounds calculated: When he spits out the
    lyric ""chat and business,"" he drips contempt, but I don't sense that he hates chat or business any more
    than most people.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he has a buddy who really despises chat and
    business, and Resende's just falling in line.</p><p>
    
    The music also falls in line, between Sonic Youth and The Fall, but at least they do it well.  If nothing
    else, the band is tight and energetic.  Jon Ball's basslines throb and flail, and guitarist Claire Ingram
    has both the riffs and the noise.  The opener, ""One Note"", rages harder and sprays more saliva than
    anything that follows; Ingram engrossingly circles around slower, drone-inflected tracks like ""City of
    Glass"", but the short blast-off chorus on ""Sink Venice"" makes it the stand-out track. For some variety,
    Ikara Colt plug a drum machine into a couple of tracks, but this is purely cosmetic.  They've used
    electronic sounds more boldly elsewhere-- for example, the seedy remake of this album's ""May B 1 Day"" on
    their <i>Basic Instruction</i> EP-- but on <i>Chat and Business</i> they tip-toe around them without taking
    any risks.  The novelty's welcome, but this is still a guitar band: Ikara Colt are strongest when Ingram's
    in charge.</p><p>
<i>Chat and Business won't bring you down, nor will it kick your ass.  It's the kind of album
    that's never better than its last single, but my complaints will sound like stodgy nit-picking if you
    go nuts for the guitars.  This album has everything you could want from a modern art-punk band: Next
    time, they should give us even more.</i></p></div>"|4069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4069-chat-and-business/|7.1|Chris Dahlen

And it's not even that there's a
    lot to talk about, because there isn't:  Roni Size's new album is vapid,
    boring and uniform.  He's ditched Reprazent and all of his other various
    hangers-on and decided to go solo, just him, his mixing board and some
    sequencers, and cranked out a drum 'n' bass album, just in time for the
    drum 'n' bass revolution that ended half a decade ago.</p><p>
    
    ""Oh, be nice,"" you say.  To which I say, ""No."" Size <i>used</i> to make
    interesting music, or at least music you could sit in your house and listen
    to without heavy sedatives.  <em>New Forms</em>, anyone?  That's a cool record.
    Absent sweaty masses grinding and gyrating on a dancefloor and freaky light
    shows, there's no substance to <em>Touching Down</em>; parts of it are even
    <i>hard</i> to dance to, and there's never any intellectual injection to
    compensate for the lack of kinetic energy.</p><p>
    
    The album actually starts off almost promisingly with ""Sound Advice"", where
    staticky radio surfing and muffled vocal interjections course over a thin,
    programmed beat. This quickly moves into a second section with a fake harp
    and swooshy background, conjuring phrases like, ""You are getting sleepy,""
    and, ""Next time, on <i>Nova</i>.""  Still, the bass is live-- played by Richie
    Glover-- and the beat is solid, instilling some hope for an interesting ride.
    Then, out of nowhere, Size calls to you: ""You are all very welcome to join me
    for the next hour of killer drums and bass.  It is official: we are now in the
    mix."" Thanks, Roni, but I'm way ahead of you.  Save it for the DVD.</p><p>
    
    From that point forward, Size dishes up the cheese like there's no fucking
    tomorrow (and in a world where a record like this gets international
    distribution, there might as well not be) with, as promised, a <i>full hour</i>
    of numbing breakbeats and something I guess you could call bass, even if it's
    never very deep-- each track is indistinguishable from the next.  He's got that
    ""bass"" noise that goes ""bweh bweh bweh,"" the one that goes ""wonk wonk wonk,""
    and a few others the Chemical Brothers bled dry in '98, along with a precious
    few characterless synth presets.  Texturally, it's barely half a cut above
    the generic <i>Best of Bass</i> compilations they can't give away at Circuit
    City.</p><p>
    
    The beats are pushed way up front for the most part, and the fundamental backbeat
    changes maybe two, three times over the whole course of the album. Twittering synth
    sounds and bubbly squiggles crop up around the edges for window dressing, but
    there's never a genuine melodic contour that might imply some direction.</p><p>
    
    It's kind of funny, in that I've come full circle with Roni Size at this point.  My
    first exposure to him came during college, when I found his Breakbeat Era project's
    <em>Ultra Obscene</em> album discarded on the mailroom floor.  Like any good scavenger,
    I scooped it up and gave it a listen, and found it so interesting that I didn't listen
    to it again for three years, until I had to write this review and became curious.  It
    still does nothing for me.  In between, I gained a good deal of respect for a lot of
    his other material (specifically <em>New Forms</em> and his tracks on Full Cycle's 1995
    comp <i>Music Box</i>), but <em>Touching Down</em> just doesn't cut it.</p><p>
    
    Curiously, Size ends the album by thanking DJs for ""all their support,"" almost as if
    it were a gesture of farewell.  I won't speculate on the future of his career, but
    Mr. Size certainly won't be getting any thanks from me until he a) makes another good
    album, or b) hands me an Advil.  In the meantime, if you want to hear <em>Touching

    1. If you had an iffy voice, wrote really simple songs, and were fresh from
    a stunning full-band effort, would you hurl a 'stripped-down,' 22-track concert
    recording at the world?  Would it seem logical that folks would clamor for a
    stunning showcase of performance and sound, with Hayden reducing his favorites
    to an ""unplugged"" acoustic guitar or solo piano format?  Well, it's the equivalent
    of Achilles showing off his new stirrup pants, as...
    
    2. *Yawn*. O Canada, where is thy sting? <em>Bowling for Columbine</em> might have
    made a skewed argument for your level-headedness, and Destroyer and Hot Hot Heat
    may be recent proof that you have a musical pulse, but damn if Hayden's
    live-in-Toronto double-disc doesn't further the U.S. view of our northern neighbor
    as an MOR wasteland. This concert teems with kinda-okayness, betraying the
    extra-special cloud-folk of Hayden's last studio release. The merely passable
    pre-<em>Skyscraper National Park</em> lyrics, when combined with this show's cute
    live banter and cute photos, result in an album too precious to soundtrack a
    rightfully complicated relationship, but too humble and likable to accuse Hayden
    of being a self-serving document of snowed fans' worship...""</p><p>
    
    3. Dear Diary: Lookin' good!  Hey, I have questions tonight.  Does a world charged
    with the confident riffage of Liars or the hurry-up-and-do-me bounce of ""electroclash""--
    among a zillion other pyrotechnic would-be revolutions-- still have a place for
    authors of imploding ballads about holding hands? What did Schoenberg mean when
    he said, ""If it is art it is not for all, and if it is for all it is not art?""
    What did Sibelius mean when he said, ""No one ever put up a statue of a critic...""</p><p>
    
    4. Hayden's been successfully scraping off his silly baby fat over the course of
    his recording career. The early records were immaturely earnest and ""sensitive,""
    with bizarre outbursts of death-howls: the instant we heard his crazy, screaming
    song, sung from the vantage point of murderous South Carolina mom Susan Smith's
    drowning children, some friends and I spent an evening blasting it from a
    convertible pickup, then sat down to record a spoof.  <em>The Closer I Get</em>
    boasted a pretty good hit-to-sap ratio, and then, like whoa, Hayden's <em>Skyscraper
    National Park</em> was revelatory-- an ideal album for anyone not yet bored with
    the sound of an act tiptoeing around alt-country's pit of despair. No kidding,
    <em>Skyscraper</em> came in at sweet 16 on my personal Top 20 of 2002, an important
    list which hangs framed in the room where my stuffed animals and I convene as the
    United Nations of Rock, trying to embargo that wily Cobra Commander into disarmament...</p><p>
    
    5. ""Until <em>Skyscraper National Park</em>, Hayden's work had been comparable to a
    blah veggie: not unhealthy, kind of beautiful in its lumpiness, hard to love, and
    hard to hate. The monotonous stretches of this concert package make it difficult
    to feel anything about him at all. The proceedings lack a transporting element;
    if this disc is playing while one is stuck in traffic, one will feel very much
    stuck in traffic...</p><p>
    
    6. A guy installed a heater at my house today.  His skin was pachyderm-wrinkled.
    He told me stories about gas explosions.  His assistant told me about working in
    paper mills, about people getting dismembered by steam leaks, about a lancer whose
    back melted because he worked without an asbestos suit.  An acquaintance that
    works as a corrections officer told me about a riot he had to help suppress.
    Reviewing CDs is wimp's work, yo, especially if I'm supposed to be summarizing a
    puss like Hayden...</p><p>
    
    7. Stay on the scene like a stats machine:</p><p>
<li> Number of songs from <em>Skyscraper National Park</em>: 8<br/>
    Because these are the best songs Hayden has written, these are the best songs
    here, though they're robbed of their warm drums and rich tones. ""Bass Song"" is
    a tense charmer, a well-told tale of being broken in on and beaten.<p>
<li> Number of songs from <em>The Closer I Get</em>: 3 <br/>
    Watch out for that dreadful part about teaching the girl to play guitar (""Between
    Us to Hold""): it's more about the speaker than the girl.  Opening line: ""I taught
    you to play guitar last night.""  Last lines: ""I held your arm as you hit the strings/
    I pressed your fingers down and started to siii-hiiiing/ Siii-hiii-hiiing."" The
    listener can picture Hayden's arms around this girl like those of a randy tennis
    instructor from an 80s movie. The crowd eats this one up.<p>
<li> Number of songs from <em>Moving Careful</em>: 2<br/>
    Decent genre soundalikes.<p>
<li> Number of songs from <em>Everything I Long For</em>: 4<br/>
    ""Bad as They Seem"" is the one about the sixteen-year-old, y'all. Let whosoever
    is without sin, etc.<p>
<li> Number of Neil Young covers: 1<br/>
    The high voice that frequents <i>Skyscraper</i> tipped me off that Neil's dogs
    had treed Hayden, but good. Julie Doiron and Howie Beck join the junior shakey
    on a frumpy ""Tell Me Why"".<p>
<li> Number of songs featured in films: 1<br/>
<i>Trees Lounge</i> was a nice fit for Hayden's penchant for blending sloth and
    heart. I mean, the guy sings like Cat Stevens abusing muscle relaxants.<p>
<li> Number of new songs: 3<br/>
    ""Holster"" (about a duel) and ""Woody"" (even though it's about Hayden's cat) rule
    the show, along with the dark stuff from <i>Skyscraper</i>.  These unstoppably
    catchy tunes will yank your beltloop, promise.<p>
    
    8. Hayden has his uses. Everybody gets crippled by nostalgia or romantic curiosity,
    I reckon. Everybody needs some music for those moments when they can't muster the
    energy to poke a straw into a Capri-Sun. And most males have been guilty of
    mythologizing their obsessive behavior in their apartment building, as Hayden
    does. He's just so <i>bald</i> about it, so self-explanatory. He's unpretentious
    to the point of being laundromat-common.  And if, in that laundromat, the Snuggle
    fabric softener mascot was a stalker and a dour troubadour...</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|3773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3773-live-at-convocation-hall/|6.3|William Bowers

    basement-party tweeters or the surround sound in your HumVee, no one denies that the guy from The Streets
    raps with zero flow. Seeing how he's the first British rapper popularized on such a massive scale in America,
    the most common excuse critics and fans have made for him is that it's the language difference; that perhaps,
    due to the clipped cadence of their accents, ""British people just don't have flow?""  Maybe.  But in eight
    months, <i>Original Pirate Material</i> is gonna be more embarrassing than the memory of you rocking the
    Stereo MCs record and the Z.Cavaricci pleated dungarees. Furthermore, disproving the ""gee, maybe the Limeys
    just don't know how to rhyme?"" theory is <i>Extra Yard</i>, the most recent in Big Dada's series of innovative
    hip-hop comps. Mixed by DJ Excalibah (host of the excellent radio show, <i>Tales from the Legend</i>, on 1Xtra--
    which is like the BBC's version of BET, but with way better music), it's a 17-track mixtape of UK party
    hip-hop whose flow drips like Britain's primary exports are honey and street cred.</p><p>
<i>Extra Yard</i> is strong out of the gate. It opens with ""A'La Fu Gives It to You""-- a tight intro in which
    deejay A'La Fu's impeccable scratches and cuts spell out the line, ""Steppin' outta place with an extra yard""--
    and flows straight into Gamma's ball-busting single, ""Killer Apps"", which drops a mushroom cloud of dubby
    sub-bass under a flurry of Jamaican-flavored raps ""for your undercover attack."" Gamma's virile chorus of,
    ""Yo, Rude Boy/ Huh/ Killer Apps/ We got what you need right now,"" is a wonderfully boastful pop lyric, and
    worth a thousand ""propas"" from a certain Izod-sporting two-step artist.</p><p>
    
    The comp maintains its energetic, high-quality party vibe throughout; however, with a couple of exceptions,
    it never quite reaches the standard set with the first couple of club knockouts. Ty's looming anthem, ""We
    Don't Care"", drops a hooky chorus over a bragging, cocksure bass synth, while calling out those who ""claim
    to represent the church/ With no research of what the rest of rap is actually/ You fail factually."" A track
    midway through the mix, Part 2 &amp; LSK's ""Life Without You"", adds some refreshingly corn-syrupy two-step flavor,
    lightly braised with butter-smooth vocals, like El DeBarge on some futuristic R&amp;B; tip.</p><p>
    
    While the British accent can certainly inject angles and unfamiliar staccato breaks into a unique cadence,
    <i>Extra Yard</i> dispels the myth that all Brits rapping sound like Neneh Cherry with a ball-gag stuffed
    in her mouth. Most interestingly, the comp exemplifies the aggressive style of UK bouncement, which blends
    hip-hop and dancehall bashing with the bounce of maximum bass. It's a puree of two-step, dub, dancehall,
    R&amp;B;, and garage-- or, in the case of Roots Manuva and Wildflower's clean, synth-heavy ""Born Again"",
    bouncement is where dancehall meets Tchaikovsky, with a sparkling sample from the ""Nutcracker Suite"". By
    pairing the forward-thinking beats of the UK club scene with a cache of impenetrably solid artists and
    producers, these Brits are taking the American art of hip-hop into unexplored, artful territories.</p></div>"|1948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1948-extra-yard-the-bouncement-revolution/|8.2|Julianne Shepherd

    and dying new-electro scene?  I mean, obviously nothing can quite rival the erratic rants and intensities
    of Nas, but this is a fun one, I swear.  Ready?  It involves a guy called I/F, or Interr-Ference. We're
    going to give him a break on the name, half because he's Dutch, and half because that extra R seems trivial
    in contrast to the name of his partner in The Parallax Corporation, who's called, umm, Intergalactic
    Gary.</p><p>
    
    I/F is sort of the nominal godfather of the new-electro scene, for two reasons. The first reason is his
    terrific late-90s cut ""Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass"", which spiked pretty utilitarian techno with the
    big, dark early-electro and Italo-disco sound that wound up sweeping the nation (assuming that nation
    is the Netherlands and a big chunk of Germany). The second reason is his great and equally significant
    <i>Mixed Up in the Hague</i> disc, a set of seminal first-wave electro pieces including the likes of
    Giorgio Moroder and Kraftwerk. He is, by any estimation, a major source of the Dutch electro scene's current
    agenda, which is Big, Dark, Epic, and Pounding: the deep noir-disco of fellow traveler Legowelt, for
    instance, sometimes seems like it might unexpectedly cross over into hard trance.</p><p>
    
    The weird beef starts in because I/F is pretty vocal in his disdain for, from what I can tell, pretty much
    everything, from the Dutch public to all of the electro he's credited for having spawned. In fact, the
    press-ready hook for <i>Cocadisco</i> is a big sneering swipe of a track called ""Your Image"", which goes
    on and on about ""electrocash."" (Sample lyrics: ""Exploiting music for the sake of your fame! Your fashion
    vision completely misses the point! No respect for music at all!"") It's easy to assume this swipe is directed
    as much at people like DJ Hell and the International DJ Gigolos-- who've injected star personas and cocaine/limousine
    antics into the whole electro project-- as it is at technical ""electroclash"" term-coiner Larry Tee, whose
    Brooklyn scene one <i>Vice</i> reader recently described as having turned into ""a homosexual <i>Star Search</i>.""
    (The problem with this criticism is that a homosexual <i>Star Search</i> sounds fantastic to me, whereas the
    bulk of Brooklyn electro does not.)</p><p>
    
    So what exactly, one might ask, is I/F's alternative proposal? In the case of The Parallax Corporation, it's
    to keep electro strictly pounding and strictly aimed at the dancefloor massive: <i>Cocadisco</i>, as the name
    sort of implies, is a big utilitarian techno set that stomps along with great dedication to traditional club
    tropes. Within that milieu it's mostly quite effective: it starts off with the obligatory ""taking you on a
    journey""-type dialog sample, then kicks immediately into the pretty daunting ""Lift Off"", whose revolving
    bass grind is like a rollercoaster that keeps climbing until you're a little scared of the upcoming
    drop-- FC/Kahuna's ""Glitterball"" suddenly seems a bit weak to me now. No deep-dark synth-building here,
    just upfront, enjoy-the-ride banging.</p><p>
    
    And plenty of the tracks on <i>Cocadisco</i> continue to deliver on that front, though nothing really strives
    for the energy level of ""Lift Off""-- ""Crocodiles in the Sky"", with vocals from usual I/F collaborator Nancy
    Fortune, immediately drops the tone back to the types of gridlike grooves Felix da Housecat might drop toward
    the beginning of a set. Vocalists appear on a lot of tracks, actually: Fortune, Kaori Kuwabara, Helga la
    Blaque, and, on the hard-disco pop detour, ""Fear"", Guy Tavares.  In the end, I/F wanders the slightest bit
    into more classic-electro territory: ""Slowflight Runner"" verges into Legowelt's realm, its smooth electro
    stride underpinning a number of synth workouts, and the organic percussion breaks on the closing ""Theme from
    Pack (Remix)"" are actually half of why it wouldn't sound so out-of-place among the vintage selections on the
    next <i>Mixed Up in the Hague</i> volume.</p><p>
    
    But forgive me: The whole ""electrocash"" rant raises the standards on this sort of thing. Would I rather dance
    to the tracks on <i>Cocadisco</i> than I would to half of the electroclash coming out of the U.S.? Without
    question. Would I rather dance to them than the stuff coming from International DJ Gigolos? Sometimes, though
    I don't think the gulf between the two is quite as wide as I/F would like to think it is. Nevertheless,
    there's something deeply offputting about I/F's sort of prudish traditionalism here: he's delivered a very
    solid collection of utilitarian, floor-oriented techno-electro-disco, but holding that up as some sort of
    ""about the music"" victory seems as pointless as rock fans getting upset about pop stars and drum machines.
    So, decent work, I/F-- only next time, mouth shut!</p></div>"|6164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6164-cocadisco/|7.3|Nitsuh Abebe

    is a melodious battle between malfunctioning pizzeria arcade games and
    electro-influenced beats, wandering through sonic terrain explored previously
    by Oval, Team Doyobi, and labelmate Richard Devine. Felipe injects hooks into
    his usual soup of processed noise and static, creating a sound that's at once
    caustic and endearing, like a nine-year old computer nerd popping balloons and
    kicking your slow, sorry ass at <i>Space Invaders</i>. To be sure, there's
    nothing new going on here-- you've heard much of <em>Xanaconversex</em> before,
    on tons of other records-- but that doesn't preclude Felipe putting a fresh
    twist on things.</p><p>
    
    ""Slutt Petal (2 Crunch)"" leads off bouncing, the beat resting on a bed of
    static punctuated by the pleasured moans of an analog harlot. It's DAT
    Politics without fear of shamelessly rockin' the dance-floor, a sound that's
    repeated on ""Strictly Generic"", which comes out swinging its Aphex acid
    moves like there's no tomorrow; despite its title, it sounds refreshingly
    inventive, and undeniably infectious, though perhaps the 1:45 runtime has
    something to do with that.  Felipe has taken his time with each composition,
    distorting, cut 'n' pasting, and decaying every kick, snare and bleep until
    it crunches like a baby frog underfoot.</p><p>
    
    From this static mess emerges a tender streak in Felipe's sonic recipe: the
    slow, ponderous undulation of the album's closer, ""Sexual Boats (Guitars Float)"".
    Nothing if not romantic, the sparkling synth keys and muted conversations of
    various members of the fairer sex drift by like clouds; the feeling is not
    unlike awakening high and contented on a spring Sunday morning. In Felipe's
    case, the bedroom is stuffed floor to ceiling with floppy disc drives, and
    you're more than likely laying next to a gutted dot matrix printer than any
    stunning seductress.</p><p>
    
    ""Pinky"", the fifth cut on <em>Xanaconversex</em>, showcases all of Felipe's
    strengths: opening with the rhythmic moans of another central computer siren,
    it rides a lounging, dubby bassline before breaking out into clean, traditional
    cut 'n' paste shenanigans. ""Pinky"" is a perfect balance of standard, sure-shot
    IDM and Felipe's unique Activision sensibility. While the rest of <em>Xanaconversex</em>
    is far from groundbreaking, there's enough enthusiasm and granulated beats to
    keep your ass parked in front of the 2600 a long while.  Consider it one to
    grow on.</p></div>"|3028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3028-xanaconversex/|6.2|Mark Martelli

    collaborate with you. There are times when it's a symbiotic and sympathetic endeavor, empowering both
    parties (something on the Erstwhile label comes to mind, or maybe Max Roach and Clifford Brown). But more
    often the results are heinous, as each tethers themselves to the other's sinking ship (Dylan and the Dead,
    anyone?) and drown together.</p><p>
    I was certain things were going to work out between Richard Youngs and Matthew Bower, though. The former had
    released a near-classic in his solo <i>Advent</i>, and he followed it up pretty well with <i>Festival</i>
    a few years later, in addition to his wistful folk whisperings on <i>Sapphie</i>. He'd also done pretty well
    in combination with other like-minded outré individuals in the UK noise-scrape underground, particularly with
    Simon-Wickham Smith (and his LP with Acid Mothers' Makoto Kawabata wasn't bad, either). Matthew Bower had
    been similarly successful with his group Skullflower, which stomped the world into submission with its
    amplified tractor pulls, before devoting his powers to Sunroof! and Total. And the two had even collaborated
    before, on <i>Site/Realm</i>, which was pure scorched-earth policy, as the two stuck to their guitars and
    made a nasty slab of string spatter and feedback Zen, at once messy and kept. But that was eight years back,
    and magic just don't happen so accidentally these days.</p><p>
    Ditching the guitar screes of yore and the live-to-tape approach, ""Eagle Like a Fly"" shows that this is more
    of a studio effort, as the two pour on the sonic fluid like something out of Yamatsuka Eye's Rebore project,
    slowly coagulating acoustic strummed flurries, organ tones, electric blurps, and hand drums into a dizzying
    brew that positively shimmers. Just as it's beginning to take effect, though, it curiously snips its own cord.
    And from here on out, <i>Relayer</i> begins the unfortunate pattern of repetition for the remainder of the
    disc, with tracks ending pretty close to where they began, in three-to-seven-minute increments. ""Pink Sky
    Blossom"" fades up some preset drum machines, with the layers a bit more phased, dogpiling all the sounds
    again, but before long they sink under this sonic detritus, lethargic and scarcely able to stay afloat
    before a quick fade-out.</p><p>
    Sometimes the succinctness works to their advantage. Sticking to John Carpenter-like simplicity, ""Moonlight
    Loe Pink"" is constructed from crystalline swirls graciously held aloft, while laser-sensitized alarms keen
    on and off. ""New Martian Sun Tunnel"" tries for Harmonia by setting the drum machine's cha-cha to the max
    and bending some strings before the celeste-powered comedown. These moments, however, are all too brief when
    having to plow through the red-light frequencies encountered in the middle of a big-huff of AC coolant on
    ""Helicopter Kachina"". And while these two gents were surely trying to transport themselves midstream the
    primal gurgle of Terry Riley, ""Opaline Retrieval"" unfortunately finds them wedged inside ""Tubular Bells""
    instead.</p><p>
    Content more to meander about and tape some keys down, and then fiddle with ring-modulators, FX boxes and
    settings, fading the tapes in and out as it becomes either somewhat of interest or else too tedious to bear
    any longer, <i>Relayer</i> drops into a saturated sameness that dilutes any possibility of psychedelic
    build-up or expansive sustenance, opting for empty-handed snatches by way of editing-room brevity.</p></div>"|8838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8838-relayer/|6.2|Andy Beta

<i>I'mheadoftheclassI'mPOPULARI'maquarterbackI'mPOPULAR<br/>
    MymomsaysI'macatchI'mPOPULARI'mneverlastpickedIgotacheerleaderchick!</i></p><p>
    
    Phew, that felt good, dinnit?  Just takes you right back, like any good one-hit wonder should.  And remember
    how, after the Kennedy raves and MTV Beach House success of that song, Nada Surf did the graceful thing by
    fading quietly into obscurity and K-Tel royalties?  That was really cool of them.  Uh... they <i>did</i>
    fade quietly into obscurity, right?</p><p>
    
    Hells no!  Like the equally mystifying continued existence of their pan-flash peers Superdrag (sigh,
    Whosuckedoutthe<i>FEEEELAAAAAANNNNN!!</i>), Nada Surf insists upon fading away rather than burning out.
    So <i>now</i>, they're dropping down to the minor leagues and trying to ignore showgoers' wiseass heckles
    as they tour America's low-overhead venues.  If you're anything like me, there's a little voice inside of
    you saying, ""Dude, weird, they're still around?  Shouldn't they be headlining the John Deere Alternative
    Rock Stage at the State Fair by now?  Could it be there's something worthwhile about this band to have so
    long outlived their original fifteen minutes?""</p><p>
    
    Well, that's why I get paid the big bucks, folks-- to tell all y'all not to listen to that bastardly little
    voice, who never did you no good anyhow.  <i>Let Go</i>'s only plausible use is to forcibly expose us to
    mid-90s alt-rock in the context of today so that we might come to grips with just how damn crappy it sounds.
    Of course, the very same effect can be achieved by simply dusting off that Buffalo Tom CD the record store's
    passed on sixty or seventy times and tossing it into the old six-disc-- a rather sad fact for the boys of
    Nada Surf, and proof positive of this album's dollar-bin destiny.</p><p>
    
    Somewhat like a defrosted wooly mammoth from 1995, Nada Surf embodies all the itinerant influences of the
    day, drawing their jangle-pop inspiration from, let's say <picks hat=""hat"" name=""name"" of=""of"" out=""out""> the DB's and <rummages around=""around""> The Replacements-- that'll suffice.  All well and good, but the band also
    carries with it the era's failings like a parasite, crimes that might've been forgivable back when we were
    sorta excited about 'Mats disciples popping up on the radio, but which come off as JUST SAD nowadays.</rummages></picks></p><p>
    
    Said crimes include:</p><p>
<li> Building a chorus around the phrase, ""I wanna know what it's like/ On the inside of love,"" in the
    at-least-aptly-titled ""Inside of Love"".<p>
<li> Hijacking a classic album's mystique in lieu of creating one's own poetic imagery, as with the
    protagonist listening to <i>Blonde on Blonde</i> in the again-credibly-titled ""Blonde on Blonde"".<p>
<li> Just the simple presence of a song called ""Neither Heaven Nor Space"" (and guess what it's about?).<p>
<li> Singing a song entirely in French (""Le Pour Ca""); although, it's entirely possible that inhabitants of
    France make up a large part of Nada Surf's current fanbase, somehow finding the time to squeeze the trio
    into their omnipresent all-Destiny's Child and Shaggy radio formats.<p>
    
    But it would take an entirely hapless band to go an entire album without stumbling into a few sparks, and
    Nada Surf find limited success in the purty harmonies of ""Blizzard of 77"" and the in-the-continent-of-raucous
    ""Treading Water"".  Too bad these, and the other ten mid-tempo tunes on <i>Let Go</i>, are gleefully shined
    into harmless linoleum by the mixing board of Bryce ""SuperSheen"" Goggin, the only man who can lay claim to
    ruining albums by both Pavement <em>and</em> Phish.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the only thing I can't give Nada Surf the old kick-while-down for is the rather unfortunate sharing
    of album titles with teen-of-the-moment Avril Lavigne-- and that's only 'cause I haven't got it in me to
    waste further time smacking down these clearly well-meaning saps.  I'll admit, though: If forced to defend
    one of the two LPs to save my life, I'd pick Little Miss Wifebeater without a second thought.  No, I'm afraid
    Nada Surf won't be regaining any of their past (hyuck, hyuck) Popularity on these shores with <i>Let Go</i>,
    and their fellow forgotten (Dig, anyone?) might want to heed their warning and stay retired.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|5693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5693-let-go/|3.8|Rob Mitchum

    their bassist and moving on without him, I get worried: who's gonna guard
    the low-end with two guitarists dominating the proceedings?  Will they
    start to sound like The Doors?  I mean, I like The Doors and all (Jim
    Morrison's, um, ""poetry"" aside), but we don't need another Doors.  These
    are the questions that shot through my head when I heard that Q and Not U
    had decided not to replace Matthew Bourlique on four-string when he left
    the band after their debut full-length, 2000's <i>No Kill No Beep Beep</i>.</p><p>
    
    On that album, Q and Not U sounded like they were on their way; there were
    some great songs at the front end of the album, even if the rest was somewhat
    less inspired.  Ideas were in abundance, but the sinew to hold them together
    was lacking, which made it more of a fun and promising release than a full-blown
    success.  I fretted that their losing a member might kill the potential
    completely, so it was with a cautious ear that I put on <i>Different Damage</i>,
    their first album without Bourlique.</p><p>
    
    And I'll tell you, I have got to stop worrying about stuff like this.  Q and
    Not U aren't on their way <i>anywhere</i> anymore-- they've arrived.  There
    are subtle changes here; the band's fundamental D.C.-ness is still firmly
    intact, all post-punk rhythms and obtuse politicking with the occasional
    riotous post-hardcore shout, though some electronics have found their way
    into the depths Bourlique used to inhabit.  And the big shocker:
    guitarist/vocalist Chris Richards makes a mean bassist.</p><p>
    
    The songwriting has tightened up considerably since <i>No Kill No Beep Beep</i>.
    If most of the songs on their debut were shotgun blasts, these are laser beams:
    no less destructive, and far more precise.  ""Soft Pyramids"" opens with the band
    spelling out the song title and several randomly chosen words from the lyrics
    over dissonant guitars and gauze-wrapped synths.  John Davis, already a great
    drummer on <i>No Kill No</i>, has improved here, pushing everything along
    octopus-style, with frenetic percussion and rock-steady beats.  Each of these
    songs nicely highlight his sharp command of rhythm.</p><p>
    
    ""So Many Animal Calls"" and closer ""Recreation Myth"" ride along on slamming
    beats, while Richards and Harris Klahr carefully match guitar parts, each
    playing in the space left by the other guitarist for an interesting series
    of interlockings.  The distortion pedals stay in storage for the most part,
    too, and the new clean tones that have filled their shoes open up the sound
    beautifully, without sacrificing precious kinetic energy.  Even when dirtier
    tones do come out, like on the righteously tweaked ""Black Plastic Bag"", they
    make a serious impact, turning a charge into a dense, thunderous stampede.
    And, as if the band's skill and improvement weren't enough, Ian MacKaye and
    Don Zientara capture their sound perfectly, revealing subtle details while
    preserving the music's intensity.</p><p>
    
    So it looks like big things loom on the horizon for Q and Not U-- and I don't
    just mean the Washington Monument.  They may only be three now, but rather than
    weaken with the loss, they've risen to the challenge, doing more with less in
    admirable style.  Their next should absolutely fucking kill.</p></div>"|6627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6627-different-damage/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    vigilante also known as Venetian Snares-- that word is undoubtedly <em>prolific</em>.
    Since the millennium went down with a whimper, Funk has released no less than six
    full-lengths on labels like Hymen, Isolate, and Planet \xB5, not to mention a plethora
    of EPs, singles and remixes.  That each release (the Brit-IDM of <em>2370804</em>,
    the ragga madness of his Snares Man! work, the speed-metal gore of <em>Making
    Orange Things</em>) succeeded in adding new bruises and scars to the Venetian
    Snares sound-- while never falling short of brilliant-- makes those figures
    all the more impressive.</p><p>
    With a new album already on deck for Mike Paradinas' Planet \xB5 label (not to
    mention his forthcoming sexperimental collaboration with Hecate, under their
    Nymphomatriarchs guise), is it any wonder that an intriguing, inventive, oddly
    formatted Venetian Snares disc should be available from Hymen at almost the
    same time? At first glance, <em>A Giant Alien Force More Violent &amp; Sick Than
    Anything You Can Imagine</em> may seem like a gimmick: a three-inch disc
    containing one fifteen-minute, thirty-three second track is housed in a snug
    red box with a miniature TV viewfinder.  Through it, you can observe the
    gargantuan album title emblazoned on everything from a grain silo to the
    abdomen of a deceased grasshopper. To be sure, many electronic labels have
    dabbled in ""special packaging"" with mixed results: if you've seen a purple
    Universal Indicator record or a limited SKAM release going for $200 on eBay,
    you know what I'm talking about.</p><p>
    But what does this say about the music on such releases?  Is a gimmick all it
    takes to move units?  The overuse of ""special"" covers and multiple editions
    nearly killed the comic book industry in the early 90s, before everyone realized
    that, if you wrap shit in silk, you wind up with silk that smells like shit.
    Or: content has to live up to its packaging. Incredibly, <em>A Giant Alien Force</em>
    does just that, proving not only that Venetian Snares continues to revolutionize
    the genre with his mind-bending, brutal take on noise and breaks, but that any
    special packaging included with his music is accessory, not the other way 'round.</p><p>
    Which leaves you asking: What has Funk done on this one track that sets it apart
    from the rest of the Venetian Snares catalog?  Truth be told, his approach on ""A
    Giant Alien Force"" doesn't stray too much from the violated drill 'n' bass of the
    <em>Shitfuckers</em> EP or the Venetian jungle bass and breaks on tracks like ""Fuck
    Toronto Jungle"" and ""Aqap"". Beginning with a menacing ambient fog that settles
    over the ears like gauze, Funk moves into sonic territory echoing <em>Melodies from
    Mars</em>-- cosmic, almost cartoonish synths straight out of an Ed Wood flick are
    backed by manic, fractured breakbeats that become increasingly cutthroat, eventually
    swallowing the melody like a python gorging itself on a terrified squirrel.</p><p>
    And that's when things get <em>really</em> fucked up. Air raid sirens scream, a
    shuffling beat emerges from behind layers of blurred static, and the bassline
    slides its way down the rave rabbit hole, emerging on the other side stained
    with background drones, almost trance-like in their ethereality. Those, in turn,
    are pushed aside by an octave crushing, sub-sonic bass meltdown, which decays
    into a culminating torrent of ass-rupturing drum loops that ride a wave of white
    noise to the dark at the end of the tunnel.
    It's almost as punishing as Atari Teenage Riot's <em>Live at Brixton Academy</em>,
    and it brings the track full circle, making it a hot air balloon ride around
    Planet Snares; no sonic stone in Funk's bag of tricks goes unturned.  By
    merging all of his personalities into one epic track, Venetian Snares
    guarantees an experience in aural violation as devastating and rewarding
    as anything in his catalog. In the end, the point of this release becomes
    crystal clear: even on a format best suited for <i>Mario Party 4</i>, it's
    not the size of your packaging that counts, but how ruthlessly you beat the
    shit out of the listener that really matters. Venetian Snares shows up to
    this party like a rabid dwarf with brass knuckles, and leaves you with a
    bloody, toothless grin.</p></div>"|8439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8439-a-giant-alien-force-more-violent-sick-than-anything-you-can-imagine-ep/|8.5|Mark Martelli

Flipping
    through chests of used UB40 and Steel Pulse records, I never found any
    treasure, and the Trustafarians at school had all but ruined Bob for me.
    To top it off, most Jamaican records I could find were so aesthetically
    off-putting as to warrant hesitation. As it turns out, whether encased in
    hand-drawn covers featuring dreadlocked lions in military gear smoking
    joints, poorly photocopied text, severely warped, pock-marked pressings,
    or cheesy back covers with the wrong titles, times, or musicians, these
    records were Acapulco Gold. As dub reggae-- and Lee Perry, in particular--
    enjoyed a renaissance in the middle of the decade (courtesy of Tortoise and
    the Beastie Boys), that all changed, and like rain after a drought, it soon
    became a deluge. There were suddenly so many damned Lee Perry records to be
    had-- some legitimate, some shady-- that one wouldn't know where to begin,
    and still may not, even today.</p><p>
    
    These two discs cull his turns as producer from 1971-1973, after his important
    early work with Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers and before founding his infamous Black
    Ark Studio.  Slim though these two years may be, they're a crucial segment of
    Perry's career to investigate. The early 70s were a heady time for Jamaican
    popular music, as it began to segue from the shuffling dance of rocksteady and
    American R&amp;B; influence into its own homegrown sound, and the harder rhythmic
    edges of skank. The gaps between those beats, which the flipside of the singles
    (called ""dubs"") explored more thoroughly, would soon lift off into the atmosphere
    as their own musical form, metamorphosing the normal sounds of studio instruments
    into abstracted space dust within a three-minute side.</p><p>
    
    Also of growing interest was the development of ""roots reggae"", which embraced
    Afrocentric thought and Rastafarianism, a religion that had a profound effect
    on the music of the time. It would transform soft-core lothario Max Romeo into
    a Marxist of the roughest sort, and make already-excellent singer Marley an
    international superstar. Lee Perry was there through all of these phases,
    instigating trends, and developing from others a sound wholly his own.
    
    Disc one begins with Marley &amp; The Wailers doing an Impressions track, which is
    then turned around by future toasting great Big Youth, who shouts until the song
    is his very own beast. Already socially conscious by way of a Curtis Mayfield
    cover, you can see the growing influence Afrocentric thought had on Perry in
    the studio. There's Junior Byles' classic ""Beat Down Babylon"", which was such
    a huge hit that police were reported singing the lyrics on their beat.  At
    least four versions of the Marcus Garvey-inspired ""Place Called Africa"" are
    compiled here, each resonating with the theme as pertains to its interpreter,
    be it by Byles, Dennis Alcapone, or Winston Cool (aka Dr. Alimantado, the
    best-dressed chicken in town).</p><p>
    
    In another four-cut span, the same basic track is run through the gamut of all
    possible island styles, illustrating in microcosm what Lee Perry was capable
    of with the barest of elements, and how much his music changed in two short
    years. It begins with the Stingers' ""Give Me Power"", rendered as a soulful
    group sound; ""Give Me Power No.2"" continues the beat, but replaces the ensemble
    with a bellowing toast from King Iwah, waxing more biblical than the previous
    version. ""Sunshine Showdown"" is that riddim once again, but this time it's made
    ridiculous by Perry himself. You can hear ringside cheering as he steps to the
    mic, musing and mumbling about ""Smokey Joe Frazier Razor"" and other inane
    observations about the sweet science. By round four, ""Scratch"" has totally
    deconstructed ""Give Me Power"" to its essence: the mix is disconcerted with
    sirens, brassy baritone croaks, and backwards tape chirps, with just the
    slightest trace of the original vocals left as ghosts. These last two takes
    lead the way for the more innovative breakthroughs (and breakdowns) that would
    take place inside the Black Ark by 1974.
    
    By stripping down certain sounds and tightening up the drums and bass, reggae
    could liberally take from American radio hits and make them into tougher tracks.
    The Chi-Lites' ""(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People"" is absorbed by
    the Upsetters, while Byles infuses Little Willie John's standard ""Fever"" with
    his own brand of madness, leading to even further permutations by the legendary
    Augustus Pablo and toaster Jah T. On the latter half of the second disc, ""Jungle
    Lion"" smokes some sticky Al Green and brings in that Hi Records organ brightness;
    it sounds deliriously whacked-out as Perry growls into the echoplex. </p>
    
    Sequenced right before the move into Black Ark, the skanks and sonics at the end
    of the set define what people generally imagine when they think of Lee Perry. His
    odd sense of humor is most evident on ""Bathroom Skank"", which provides an excellent
    ""towel""/""bowel"" rhyme, and would lead to further scatological fixations in the
    future.  Most prophetic are the echoed intonations that introduce the more skewed
    studio elements in instrumentals like ""IPA Skank"", ""Freakout Skank"", ""Bucky
    Skank"" and ""Cow Thief Skank"". Not only are these some of Perry's best early
    works (aside from the curiously absent ""Clint Eastwood"" instrumentals), they
    point the way into the future of the genre, and remixing in general, insofar
    as all the sounds are fair game for tweaking.
    
    This set, while not as uniformly tight as Soul Jazz's excellent <em>Studio One</em>
    overviews, or the compilations of legendary producers Leslie Kong, Sonia Pottinger,
    and King Tubby, has a little bit of everything to compensate, from a young Marley,
    to early toasting, with dashes of hard skank, proto-dub instrumentals, and oddball
    covers thrown in for good measure. As for compiling ""Scratch"", it remains an
    unsatisfactory effort; his cosmic joker legacy will forever elude capture, and
    these are all too brief glimpses of that genius at play.</div>"|6244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6244-the-wonderman-years/|6.8|Chris Dahlen

Back in the day, only the biggest,
    most self-absorbed arena rockers could turn their meandering, ridiculous
    ""deaf/dumb/blind pinball star"" concepts into hit albums.  The punk revolution
    tried but failed to wipe these dinosaurs from history, so it's a gutsy move
    that a hardcore act-- even one as twisted and avant-literate as Racebannon--
    would follow in the footsteps of The Who and Pink Floyd, without even smirking
    about it.</p><p>
<em>Satan's Kickin' Yr Dick In</em> is indeed a rock opera, yet there isn't one
    note of empty bombast: loud, vicious, and vulgar, it's their tightest, most
    ambitious record yet.  Admittedly a little closer to Zappa's <em>Joe's Garage</em>
    than <em>Tommy</em>, it's the story of Rodney, a musician whose material is
    piss-poor and can't draw a crowd.  In desperation, he makes a deal with Satan,
    who turns him into a gorgeous chanteuse named Rhonda Delight, as whom he wins
    fame, riches, and decadence-- everything his heart desires-- until his inevitable
    fall, when celebrity takes its toll, and Satan returns to drag him to hell.</p><p>
    The joke is, you can't make out this story without the liner notes, because
    Michael Anderson's vocals are completely indecipherable, thanks to his giddy
    delivery and the record's liberal use of noise.  A few signifiers of the high
    life (""it's so glorious..."", ""heroin is so lower-class..."", ""John F. Kennedy, Jr."")
    make it through, but deciphering the rest is like watching an Italian opera:
    you have to infer the drama from how much and how loudly they shriek.</p><p>
    Anderson, who wrote this libretto, revitalizes the hoary, clichéd story by
    elaborating with gawking, carnal imagery, from Rodney's graphic violation by
    Satan to the celebrated Rhonda's vivid, naked beauty.  And nobody could express
    our hero's inner state like Anderson, whose excited gibbering sounds like a
    cartoon character with its head spinning around.  The album title is a good
    indicator of his diction and tasteful vulgarity, as is the way he scrunches
    certain words (like ""yr"") before they leave his mouth.</p><p>
    Racebannon embeds the vocals in dense, grinding sheets of cacophony.  Monstrous
    drums and guitar stomp through the songs, from chords like waves smashing beach
    houses to the whip-like tune of ""Part IV"", bouncing like some demon is grabbing
    at its kneecaps, before wrenching into Rhonda's decline.  The core music is
    surrounded by a nightmarish din, with multi-tracked vocals, and a little of what
    a preacher might call the ""steel wheels of Lucifer"": records played either backwards
    or slowed to a warped pitch like the voice of the dark master.</p><p>
    The band has released the five parts in installments, with ""IV"" and ""V"" just out
    on a split album with Songs of Zarathustra, but this is the epic's first full release,
    and it features a new, more polished recording.  It's easily their best album, as
    much as I liked last year's <em>In the Grips of the Light</em>: the band sounds better
    on a shorter record with no breaks between tracks, and the non-stop throttling is
    actually more listenable.  The sterling production makes it less raw, but much
    stronger: Racebannon sticks your head right into the noise, just as their words
    pull you through the bowels of fame, lust and desire.</p></div>"|6632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6632-satans-kickin-yr-dick-in/|8.3|Chris Dahlen

    lists in their heads of who is and who is not ""real rock and roll.""  The owners of such mindsets usually
    place themselves in the center of this imagined real rock circle, and damn those who venture beyond its
    perimeter.  In the case of this band, the prerequisites for a cherry-scented stamp of approval are riffs,
    riffs, and more riffs, as one might expect from the telling title of their second album, <i>Riffin'</i>.</p><p>
    
    It's very hard to be objective when it comes down to riffs.  After all, who can say which riffs are good
    and which aren't?  By keeping things as basic as they do, the Valence make it difficult to apply any kind
    of logic to the proceedings.  Either this music grabs you or it doesn't, and while <i>Riffin'</i> will
    probably rake up a modest pile of followers, it seems certain that the majority of ears it strikes will
    have been struck more effectively by other like-minded bands and/or be completely indifferent.</p><p>
    
    Guitarists
    Jamie Williams and Cheetie Kumar riff it up with all due aplomb, doling out a tasty riff morsel per song,
    but with little else to offer, <i>Riffin'</i> grows surprisingly tiring during the course of its 33-minute
    runtime.  The shame of it all is that each song, and the album as a whole, could be made leagues better if
    only the band weren't committed to a good-on-paper philosophy of being full volume all the time.  Even Led
    Zeppelin, no friends of subtlety themselves, knew the value of contrast and dynamics.  This lesson appears
    to have gone unimparted on The Cherry Valence, and it's easy to imagine them giving their audiences migraines
    at the exact moment the band expects a group orgasm.</p><p>
    
    None of these shortcomings would be a death blow on their own, and even taken together, they don't disqualify
    The Cherry Valence as an enjoyable band.  Similar charges could just as easily be leveled at The Stooges,
    The MC5, The Sonics, Sex Pistols, etc., but what the Cherry Valence lacks is an Iggy, a Rob Tyner, a Gerry
    Roslie, a Johnny Rotten, etc.  Brian Quast and Nick Whitley, sharing lead vocal duties, thankfully sidestep
    any attempts to add a Robert Plant wail to the guitar bombast behind them, and they wind up sounding much
    more human and real for it.  But they also sound generic and utterly devoid of charisma, filling the
    position without offering much that's compelling.  The same goes for the band.  They're ultimately a group
    that you can go see when you can't afford AC/DC tickets, and since CDs cost the same regardless of their
    worth, you might as well skip <i>Riffin'</i> and buy <i>Back in Black</i> instead.</p></div>"|1424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1424-riffin/|4.4|Brian James

    bands only shared one member, The Sea and Cake always seemed like Tortoise's pop
    spin-off, and, pop fan that I am, I dug it.</p><p>
    
    The Sea and Cake has since become a downright staple of indie rock, spreading
    six albums out over a ten-year career.  Things seemed to be getting better,
    too: 2001's <i>Oui</i> was the band's most consistent album, the fullest
    realization of their deceptively creative, soft-rock sound.  Sam Prekop's
    Voice has been growing in confidence the whole time, appearing higher and
    higher in the mix, embracing a unique sort of breathy rasp that nicely
    complemented <i>Oui</i>'s winter-by-the-Lake ambience.</p><p>
    
    The Sea and Cake's sixth record is a good one, showing the band isn't running
    willy-nilly from the sinking post-rock ship, instead subtly incorporating the
    electronic dance-beats that have inched back into the indie vocabulary.  <i>One
    Bedroom</i> launches with a thick instrumental jam (""Four Corners"") that proves
    the band remain technically sharp as knives; Eric Claridge's tuneful bass leads
    the charge over percussive guitars and John McEntire's constantly shape-shifting
    drums.  Yet, I turn now to face Sam Prekop's Voice, and realize that it must be
    said:</p><p>
    
    ""I don't know, SPV, I think you might've gone too far on <i>One Bedroom</i>.
    Voice, my friend, when you come in mixed higher than ever, after three
    minutes of solid white-boy groove, it's a lot for a man to take.  I'm not
    sure where that windy timbre comes from-- sucking Camels, monoxide, Sharpies--
    and I'll grant you it's distinctive, but it's also terribly limiting, with a
    range so narrow, anyone with more than a couple Sea and Cake records has already
    heard all that you can do.  On ""Four Corners"", even the music seems disappointed
    with you, each element of the jam slowly peeling off under your whisper-croon,
    and when you return at its close, you're defeated, subdued.</p><p>
    
    ""It's sad that you've become such an obstacle, SPV, since on <i>One Bedroom</i>
    the band occasionally pumps out some of its best music yet.  Like Richard Pryor
    in <i>Superman 3</i>, recent Tortoise tracks (i.e. ""CTA"", off Chocolate Industries'
    <i>Urban Renewal</i> comp) had McEntire's rhythms pumped in the studio, and he
    brings that increased machinery to this album.  ""Hotel Tell"" hinges on a throbbing
    bass drum and some decorative handclaps, and they augment the beat in ""Shoulder
    Length"" with a toy-box full of buzzes and clicks.  Keyboards abound like never
    before on a Sea and Cake record, de-emphasizing the signature hard-rhythm guitar
    and-- miraculously-- deposing the vibraphone. My word, has Chicago finally put
    away the mallets?</p><p>
    
    ""It wouldn't be entirely fair to lay all the blame at your, um, feet, Sam
    Prekop's Voice.  <i>One Bedroom</i> also signals a return to the half-on/half-off
    inconsistency that marred all Sea and Cake albums except <i>Nassau</i> and <i>Oui</i>,
    as a handful of misfires trip up the flow.  Songs like ""Try Nothing"", ""Le Baron""
    and ""Interiors"" can't distract from the vocals, and fall over the lite-rock
    cliff, string, synths and all.</p><p>
    
    ""It says something that the record's closer, a dolled-up cover of David Bowie's
    ""Sound and Vision"", is the most exciting track here.  It's also the one that most
    covers up your limitations, SPV.  Going all the way with those soft-rock keyboards,
    completely buying into the electronic drums, ""Sound and Vision"" also mixes in singing
    from the Aluminum Group's Navin Brothers.  The result is a reasonable facsimile of
    what The Human League might've done with the song; it barely skirts the elevator
    music issue, ending up a sublime work of EZ-Indie.</p><p>
    
    ""I mean, I feel like kind of an ass being this hard on you, to your face no less.
    A man can't help the way he sings, but you didn't always sound like this; I dug
    out the back catalog to make sure.  Hey, look at trusty old Archer Prewitt over
    there, he's a damn fine singer in his own right.  Calm down, SPV, all I'm saying
    is consider scaling it back a bit.  It might be just the push The Sea and Cake need
    to evolve as a band, before you become water-treading caricature.  C'mon, suck in
    that lower lip, let's get a pizza; I'm buying.  You like pepperoni, right?""</p></div>"|7041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7041-one-bedroom/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

    material you're supposed to study before taking the driving test-- not
    only are other drivers supposed to yield for funeral processions, but
    members of funeral processions are allowed to run red lights.  Does this
    seem counterintuitive to anyone else?  As accidents I occasionally see on
    my way to work will attest, running red lights can be dangerous stuff, often
    leading to, um, more funerals.  I'm pretty sure the only way to darken the
    mood at a funeral is to have something more tragic happen during one.</p><p>
    
    The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up might have something to say about that; these five
    guys make music to slaughter all emotions brighter than morose.  They could
    run all the red lights in Illinois if they wanted to, which is not to say
    their music sounds haphazard in any way; in fact, it's just the opposite,
    igniting pyres with well-placed shards of dissonance and agitated
    percussion, highlighting a tragedy you might otherwise submissively endure.</p><p>
    
    The Pile-Up-- and no, there's nobody named Jim Yoshii, not in the band
    anyway-- take their time coping with sadness, stretching <i>Homemade Drugs</i>'
    nine songs over 44 minutes and 44 seconds, pacing meditative instrumental
    passages with steady build-ups.  Their three guitars stay clean and out of
    each other's way for the most part, resulting in a clear, piercing sound
    with plenty of breathing room for Paul Gonzenbach's affecting tenor.  His
    voice is a warm spot in the band's somewhat chilly arrangements, both
    comforting and depressing, like a good friend helping you through a rough
    day.</p><p>
    
    Of course, good friends wouldn't normally hit you with stuff as bleak as:
    ""Cold and wet in a ditch by the side of the road somewhere/ Lie all of my
    dreams for you and me.""  Or worse: ""This isn't life/ This isn't okay/ This
    isn't much more than survival/ I know the kids next door bother you/ I've
    seen you flinch at the screams and the abuse/ I know the cars at night honk
    at you/ I've seen the rings around your eyes in the morning/ They're selling
    guns on the corner.""  Gonzenbach's in a hell of a rut: the rent's due, his
    girlfriend's grown cold and plans to leave him, his friends are abused, his
    city is menacing, and he's tired of life.  In fact, he's <i>so</i> tired of
    life that he winds up repeating himself.</p><p>
    
    So, it's not a party, but as funerals go, it's interesting and graciously
    understated.  Even <i>Homemade Drugs</i>' most upbeat track-- ""A Deep Deep
    Lake""-- is draped in black velvet, hinting at both abuse and alcoholism.
    The guitars take on a harder edge, joining the rhythm section for a
    five-pronged, rhythmic attack that gives way to quieter verses, full of
    intricately interlocking melodies.  The song's structure reverses the
    typical crescendo so overused these days, becoming sparser as it carries
    on, ending in a whisper.</p><p>
    
    And whispering is ultimately where the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up excels.  Extended
    meditations on sadness and loss can be trying, but the band's skill at once
    draws you into their misery and makes it palatable.  It's hardly every day
    listening, but hung-over, insecure, anxious and lonely, you'll be reaching
    for <i>Homemade Drugs</i>.</p></div>"|4257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4257-homemade-drugs/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Erie, the lone peak stretching above Phil
    Elvrum's hometown of Fidalgo Island, Washington, it was probably easy to
    imagine it as the highest point in the world, the place where Earth met sky.
    Mt. Erie is a mere 1,448 ft. at its peak, barely a foothill to Everest, and
    yet to a child, its summit is stupefying.  But in the end, the weight of years
    pierces the exaggerated perception of youth; there's often a cruel disparity
    between the remnants of distorted childhood imagery and the onset of
    adulthood.  I don't know what, if anything, a young Elvrum might have
    imagined in Erie's wilderness, but I'm guessing those memories cast a
    long shadow.</p><p>
    
    After his three prior Microphones releases turned out, quite subconsciously,
    to be about Air, Water, and Fire-- respectively and chronologically-- <i>Mount
    Eerie</i> is, in Elvrum's words, an album ""more consciously about mountains
    and earth, though it turned out to be more about space.""  Its nominal peak is
    naturally at its heart, but only as a caricature plucked from the mind of an
    over-imaginative young poet, twisted and ominously stretching upward as a
    bridge to the heavens.  Above and below, the album's drama is unveiled as a
    five-act play in words and music, profound and surreal, made all the more so
    with its awesome, childlike simplicity.  It's a grim myth of revelation, death,
    and rebirth, but written in crayon, ensuring with its bright colors that all
    will work out in the end.</p><p>
    
    Each track serves as a piece in <i>Mount Eerie</i>'s continuous, linear story,
    and many of Elvrum's friends assume roles as the primary cast of characters:
    Kyle Field (of Little Wings) is Death; Karl Blau represents the birds that
    pick apart Elvrum's body, and K founder Calvin Johnson gives voice to The
    Universe itself.  Mirah Zeitlyn, Khaela Maricich, Adam Forkner, and Anna
    Oxygen also make appearances.  It's ambitious to say the least, but the
    contributors are up to the task, executing these whimsically bizarre roles
    with remarkable sincerity.  Music is too often described as ""cinematic,"" but
    <i>Mount Eerie</i> evokes that exact quality; it's almost possible to envision
    the sets-- a handcrafted, celestial night sky, a sparse, faux-knoll for Eerie's
    grassy zenith-- and though crude, they're careful and cared for.  The stark
    sincerity of the performance lends it all a gorgeous, unrefined artistry.</p><p>
    
    The story begins with ""The Sun"", where the influence of classical form on
    this album is immediately apparent; beyond the traditional five-act arc, the
    music is allegorical.  Like Verdi attempting to summon spring with a violin,
    Elvrum tackles things that are much, much larger than a simple tom, snare,
    or human voice.  ""The Sun"" opens with the heart-like pulse that concluded
    <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>, gradually and subtly mutating to a more complex
    rhythm.  Soon, a wash of drums fades across the channels, evoking either the
    rising and setting of our star, or the revolution of Earth.  It builds to
    climax before Elvrum, in touching a capella, relates the story of his birth,
    whereupon he sights Death on a black ship and flees for the peak of Mt. Eerie.
    At 17 minutes, the track finally supernovas with a deafening drone and crash
    of cymbals, before the story advances.</p><p>
    
    As he scales the mountainside to a delicate acoustic strum, Elvrum
    ""reminisces about a girl gracefully juggling [him as] a planet,"" and
    somewhere, distantly, she thinks of him.  But as he climbs, day is fading:
    creepy tympani patterns call forth our timeless fear of night, and a Greek
    chorus gives voice to these feelings of isolation and worry.  It's the voice
    of the cosmos, staring down at Phil, alone on the mountain peak.  The
    hazy-sweet hum of the night sky is at once reassuring, beautiful, and
    disturbing, but it all gives way as he glimpses his Death approaching, and
    resigns himself to his fate: ""Soon a big black cloud will come/ Soon a big
    black cloud will come/ And press you to the ground/ The air will leave your
    chest/ And you'll fade from where you're found.""</p><p>
    
    The clarity of his apprehension is breathtaking, voiced by those who've
    shaped the story up to the moment before Death arrives with its primal,
    percussive bloodlust.  Phil dies, and carrion birds leave the peak ""empty
    and windy again.""  After the cawing, and the hiss of wind has subsided, a
    second mountain reveals itself, stretching further up into ""The Universe""; what once
    seemed infinite and unknowable to mortal perception-- as abstract as a flat
    plane of light and darkness-- now deepens into a vast, definite expanse.
    ""But Universe, I see your face/ Looks just like mine/ And we are open wide,""
    Phil sings into space, which echoes his words back to him with a ghostly
    chorus.  A titanic bass drum bellows in the distant reaches, and after his
    life and death, Phil finds his resting place, at home in the arms of the
    Universe.</p><p>
    
    I gave away the ending, but this epic is no mystery; the portents are clear
    from the beginning, and the listener's job is to take it all in.  Excepting
    the heart-wrenching sight of Death in its title track, <i>Mount Eerie</i>
    never quite achieves the transcendent, lo-fi glory of <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>,
    but it's no less incredible a spectacle.  This is a massive artistic statement
    from The Microphones, and though it may be cryptic-- even overwhelming at
    times-- it remains warm and open, thanks to the stunning intimacy that has
    consistently been the group's hallmark.  As the truth and meaning of the
    universe become manifest, <i>Mount Eerie</i> comforts, illustrating that
    comprehension isn't as important as acceptance.</p></div>"|5267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5267-mount-eerie/|8.9|Eric Carr

    visit to their website, I was amazed to see how many stray compilations and
    single tracks I'd never heard.  As record shop owners (someday I'll make a
    pilgrimage to Dearborn, Michigan's Stormy Records) and diehard fans of
    independent music, it's no surprise to find Windy &amp; Carl drawn to lovingly
    packaged limited editions; the duo have never shied from sending a lone
    piece of music to a friendly-- if isolated-- home on a fellow fanatic's
    compilation.  With their steady production rate over the last ten years,
    they've amassed a significant catalog of odds-and-ends, many of which are
    collected for this three-disc set.</p><p>
    
    The first disc is subtitled ""Singles and EPs"".  Now, I have the split seven-inch
    they did with the Silver Apples, but the idea of Windy &amp; Carl putting out
    singles has always struck me as a little odd; my favorite album of theirs is
    still the deep, dense <i>Antarctica</i>, which has only three tracks and runs
    40 minutes.  Windy &amp; Carl's drones take a while to get going; you need to spend
    enough time inside their sound to become immersed, and for a moment forget
    any other sounds ever existed.  Accordingly, the singles material on the
    first disc, which also happens to be of an earlier vintage, is to my ears
    the weakest of the three. Windy &amp; Carl deserve the best possible fidelity,
    and the older, home-recorded material is understandably a bit crude.
    Occasionally these limitations are an advantage, as on the odd ""Christmas
    Song"" (not the Mel Torme number), where gurgling feedback takes on an even
    warmer cast with lo-fi distortion, but in other places, the sound gets a big
    murky, and vague.</p><p>
    
    The best part about disc one is its variety: perhaps in an effort to honor
    the tradition of the format, the singles tend to have more song-oriented
    structures, with lots of strummed guitars, and not so much in the way of
    drone. ""Watersong"" and ""Dragonfly""-- released as the duo's first seven-inch
    in 1993-- are two dark tracks with vocals possessed of a little Galaxie 500
    innocence, sounding almost like Movietone. Despite the voice being so up
    front, both are a bit light on melody.</p><p>
    
    Things pick up considerably on disc two, subtitled ""Compilations"".  Most of
    these songs date from 1996 and 1997, when Windy &amp; Carl hit their stride, and
    developed an understanding of their strengths. The processed feedback in
    ""Beyond Asleep"", which begins the second disc, suggest that Windy &amp; Carl
    learned great lessons from Fripp &amp; Eno, and transformed that knowledge to
    create something even more placid and inviting. The lovely ""Marble Dream""
    shows how adept they became at inserting vocal tracks since their awkward
    beginnings; Windy's singing is miles better than that first single, and
    they've found the right technique for mixing it with Carl's shimmering
    drones.  Two live tracks-- ""Live at Go Sound"" and ""Live Song from
    Transmissions""-- offer an interesting portrait of the noisier, more unsettling
    corner of Windy &amp; Carl's world.</p><p>
    
    Disc three (""Live + Unreleased"") is just as good; though one would imagine
    their layered, careful music to be a studio proposition, Windy &amp; Carl pull
    it off quite well live, managing to fill all that space with just a couple
    of guitars and effects pedals. Disc three also has live versions of tracks
    from <i>Depths</i> back to back (""Undercurrent"" and ""Set Adrift""), which made
    me remember what a great record that is. The simplicity of ""Set Adrift"" in
    particular is stunning: hearing it performed in the studio at WDET, I notice
    for the first time that it's little more than a duet between an acoustic and
    electric guitar, but such complex feelings are contained in its simply
    plucked, two-chord riff.</p><p>
    
    As a compilation, <i>Introspection</i> is naturally Windy &amp; Carl's most varied
    release, in terms of both style and quality. Listening to it, I realized I
    still think of these two as an album band-- particularly as they've taken a
    turn toward thematically uniform material like <i>Depths</i> and <i>Consciousness</i>--
    but <i>Introspection</i> recollects key chapters of the band's very compelling
    story, and at just $20 for three discs and detailed, track-by-track liner
    notes, you can't miss.

    of electronic hip-hop in lagging, five minute tracks, all full of exuberant
    raps regarding the joys of partying and sex.  Though at times it approaches
    cleverness, Gold Chains is inflexible in its ceaseless coverage of the
    tired, mindless subject matter.</p><p>
    
    Topher LaFata revels in rhetoric.  Here's a hip-hop record by a guy who
    writes software-- the polar opposite of knocking boots-- and tries to get
    away with a Stereolab sample, excusing himself with a bandwagon appeal:
    Busta Rhymes did it, too.  LaFata delivers quick jabs about gear over
    abrasive, crunching digital beats, but for his obvious aim to court
    backpackers, Gold Chains is entirely in line with hip-hop LaFata
    probably considers himself more intelligent than.</p><p>
    
    He's smugly aware of the built-in novelty of homemade hip-hop since it
    became his culture's predominant popular music: the most brazen, ironist
    critics and numbed, partially deaf mainstream listeners all drive to their
    day jobs with the same Missy Elliott album slowly fraying the wires on their
    CD player-to-cassette-deck connection.  LaFata takes this much for granted.</p><p>
    
    Gold Chains could be taking the same approach as Kool Moe Dee, using
    hedonism, self-promotion, and ""I-know-he's-just-kidding-he-is-just-kidding-right?""
    misogyny to confront either the innate obscurity of his genre, or his own daily
    frustrations. Unlike Kool Moe Dee, Erik B., or whatever pantheon artist Topher
    LaFata dreams of becoming, his style is a constructed pose, paying careful
    attention to the themes and execution of his influences, but completely
    lacking their significance.</p><p>
    
    LaFata may have adopted the same willfully challenging approach a slew of
    underground hip-hop artists have in the past decade-- Bomb Hip-Hop, or the
    consistently lauded Def Jux-- but if that's his intent, the differences are
    even clearer. Take El-P, who grew up involved with hip-hop, and tailored it
    to meet his artistic and personal needs, close-minded public be damned. Then
    take Gold Chains, who began his career outside the traditional hip-hop
    family, as part of a marginalized group of Kit Clayton record-buyers and
    computer programmers who strove to fit in.  LaFata's drive for inclusion
    and gratification isn't damning in and of itself, but to gain entry to the
    wisecracking hip-hop underground he envies, he goes to great lengths to
    alienate people, in hopes of artistic and ""street"" credibility.</p><p>
    
    Yet, like that other inflammatory underground rapper, Cex, Gold Chains'
    grooves have implications beyond the noble intent to get a party started.
    There's a pervading sense that he's reacting to the lack of vitality in
    homemade music, especially homemade electronica.  Chains' self-titled EP is
    partially a call to arms against a genre few people take seriously in the
    first place, the only genre that could support Gold Chains and the sheer
    kitsch value of a single like ""I Come From San Francisco"".  His record is
    polemically opposed to the self-indulgent introspection of indie hip-hop and
    bedroom electronica; as in rap's origins, the backing music is drawn from a
    relevant, immediate genre, positioning the emcee as a social critic.</p><p>
    
    In his book <i>An Emotional Memoir of Martha Quinn</i>, Alan Licht suggests
    the main problem with the last decade of music is a lack of competition.  He
    succinctly asks, ""Who does Belle and Sebastian want to be better than?""
    While there's an immediate value to music that gets a room of people
    excited, dancing or at least interacting with each other, Gold Chains
    doesn't have any competition: he's one of scant few successful hip-hop
    artists informed by artsy, suburban backgrounds and predominantly white
    electronica.  Sans any real enemies, his playful fantasy of inter-genre
    conflict is, for its brazenness and a few comedic highlights, ultimately
    impertinent.</p></div>"|3498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3498-gold-chains-ep/|5.4|Matthew Wellins

    spirituality, reject our families, or cross our internal lines of social decency.  Beliefs and codes vary
    from person to person like wardrobes, but very few people are willful, foolish or terminally self-aware
    enough to defy their own.  Cultural expectations-- ""absurd and malignant"" or otherwise-- have sway, and
    the precious, indecent few who manage to outrun them are usually viewed as outcasts or criminals (though
    sometimes as prophets).  Aside from whatever laws they break, criminals rob us of our conventions: Through
    acts of violence and upheaval, they force us to confront our boundaries.  For some, ignoring the tenuous
    line between right and wrong is an easy feat, but for others, personal demons are as controlling as any
    backlog of cultural norms.  From the sound of <i>Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home</i>, Angels of
    Light frontman Michael Gira may yet have demons to master and boundaries to set.</p><p>
    
    Gira broached straightforward indecency long ago, via his most infamous and acclaimed project, Swans.  In
    the mid-80s, when even the most ruthlessly earnest punks were only beginning to come to terms with a
    ""responsible"" definition of anarchy, Gira and then-partner Jarboe were speaking, sometimes literally,
    of masochistic torture and humiliating, brutal sex, over drastically compressed drones and industrial
    propulsion.  When the decade closed in an alternative rock flourish, Swans thrust forward by leaps and
    bounds: <i>Love of Life</i>, <i>The Great Annihilator</i> and especially <i>Soundtracks for the Blind</i>
    predicted Godspeed You Black Emperor! and all manner of dark-ambient music, though thematically, Swans
    still seemed to equate God with a dominatrix.  Gira's post-Swans (read: post-Jarboe) folk collective, The
    Angels of Light, matches his previous band's penchant for mythic grandeur with more muted dynamics, if
    not sentiment.  <i>Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home</i> is their third release, and it is both
    disturbing and wonderful.</p><p>
    
    According to Gira, the album is a response to various personal, historical and political disasters.  In
    some ways, that cryptic declaration takes the edge off the songs, as without pretense there's vast room
    for interpretation in his lyrics.  Where ""Palisades"" might read as a particularly bitter response to
    suicide (""Reasons won't come/ And no one will regret that you're gone""), it could as easily lament
    claustrophobic personal terror: ""Do you see how they ruined your mind?/ Do you see how they ruined your
    life?""  Gira's smoke-stained baritone barely carries the words over acoustic guitar and delicate bell-tones,
    though later, he verges on overtaking a serene arrangement of church bells and a children's choir.  The
    altogether peaceful ""Kosinsky"", with its deft, gently strummed electric guitar and bright fiddle motif,
    initially reads as a tender love song; Gira's description of hair like ""translucent, liquid light"" and
    ""the rhythm of your breathing"" seem poignant, though he again blurs boundaries by admitting he looks on
    his love with ""the eyes of an animal.""</p><p>
    
    The textural range of <i>Everything Is Good Here</i> lends an epic, almost timeless quality that goes a
    long way toward fleshing out Gira's often-mythological way with words.  ""All Souls' Rising"" features
    impressions of pagan ritual, and self-purification via ""the cull of foreign bone"" and forcing ""the blue
    smoke in... [to] fill the sac of skin.""  The relentless hammer of drums and murky stew of bass, organ
    and guitar-- not to mention Gira's own droning war cries-- conjure scenes of violent sacrifice and the
    chaotic laws of a still-dominant Earth.</p><p>
    
    Contrarily, the midtempo, Beatlesque ""Sunset Park"" reveals little in its single repeated line, ""She brings
    some/ She'll bring one,"" but betrays a brilliant optimism in Gira's simple, dignified melody and wall of
    shimmering guitars.  Later, on ""Wedding"", an extended, gently strummed introduction is offset by ominous
    brass tones and the dissonant children's choir, giving way to Gira's rugged moan.  The choir caps each
    phrase with angelic harmonies, quite removed from the intentionally grotesque sound of Swans, or even
    scattered moments on this album.  As a whole, <i>Everything Is Good Here</i> is at once breathtaking and,
    like many Gira releases, simply too much.</p><p>
    
    The overwhelming impression is one of acceptance and redemption, despite repeatedly bleak (or at best,
    mysterious) narration from Gira.  The production helps, but digging deeper into its lyrics, it seems that,
    rather than prolong an inner struggle, The Angels of Light seek salvation.  ""What Will Come"" openly requests
    that God ""save us... from what will come,"" though it's difficult to reconcile Gira's leap of faith after an
    album's worth of explicitly self-empowering, judgmental narrative, clouded by contradiction.  Nevertheless,
    music that resonates with as much emotional weight and vital abandon is rare, and though I'm less inclined
    to look for answers in the mix than revel in its chaos, <i>Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home</i>
    is a commendable, heady experience.</p></div>"|187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/187-everything-is-good-hereplease-come-home/|8.6|Dominique Leone

    of the Soundtrack of Our Lives? Apparently, that's what all the English kids
    are listening to!"" and, ""Man, I keep hearing that the Soundtrack of Our Lives
    is fucking awesome!"" In hindsight, my friend was either overzealous or a
    covert street-team shill, but at the time I was curious, and why not?  It
    was supposed to be great!</p><p>
    
    After an exhaustive search-- during which I discovered that Soundtrack of Our
    Lives are not English, but Swedish (and who isn't these days?)-- I stumbled
    upon a $40 import of <i>Behind the Music</i> at my local record store. There
    was no way in hell I was dropping that kind of money on an unknown record, but
    I gladly gave it a listen.  First impression: baffled at how under-whelming
    it all was. I thought that either a) my friend was wrong, b) the English still
    fall for any band that sounds like Oasis, or c) I might need to listen to
    the album more than once to let it sink in.</p><p>
    
    Republic/Universal brought the Soundtrack of Our Lives' <i>Behind the Music</i>
    (their third LP) to America in September 2002, significantly paring its
    price tag, but from what I'd heard of the album, $15 still felt steep.
    Hedge as I might, somebody up there wanted me to hear this record, and via
    Pitchfork, a free promotional copy arrived at my doorstep some weeks later.
    I didn't pay a dime for this, and I still I feel ripped off.</p><p>
    
    I spent a week with this album, and kept telling myself, ""Hey, Kyle, don't
    judge this against hype; take the music for what it is.""  I tried-- I
    listened without prejudice-- but realized the first two of my initial
    hypotheses were correct.  <i>Behind the Music</i> is derivative and bland,
    and though the former quality isn't always a bad thing, the Soundtrack of
    Our Lives are in large part a classic rock cover band; their derivation is
    tedium.</p><p>
    
    Take the greatest bands of all time, and excise any quality that could scare
    listeners off.  Take the Rolling Stones, remove their sexual power and soul,
    and you have <i>Behind the Music</i>'s ""Sister Surround"".  Dispatch Pink
    Floyd's mystique and experimental bend, and you'd be listening to ""Broken
    Imaginary Time"".  For all the kids who lied when they said they understood
    <i>Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts' Club Band</i>, listening in mental stasis as
    it drifted over their heads, may I present the Soundtrack of Your Lives.</p><p>
    
    Noel Gallagher proclaimed <i>Behind the Music</i> ""the best album to come out
    in the last six years."" Unless Noel's figured out the secret reason <i>Be Here
    Now</i> is worth owning, we'll assume he's dating from <i>OK Computer</i>.  But
    of course he isn't-- which is just Noel's idiocy-- but yes, if you wake up every
    morning craving a slice of ""Magic Pie"", he's right: consider yourself a potential
    Soundtrack of Our Lives fan.</p><p>
    
    Not to crucify these mostly harmless Swedes, but it's high fucking time people
    stand up to over-hyped exports.  I'm not going to tell you I change the station
    every time Coldplay comes on, but if I ever hear the Soundtrack of Our Lives'
    ""Tonight"" accosting me in a store, I'm walking out.  There's nothing behind this
    music, and at the end of my days with it, my only impulse was to crank <i>Exile
    on Main Street</i> for the millionth time. I'm not asking for comparable heroes,
    but Christ, throw me a bone, Sweden!</p></div>"|7376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7376-behind-the-music/|3.0|Kyle Reiter

    material (often dense and experimental) has recently fallen under the
    catch-all name ""Plunderphonics.""  Let's say, for the sake of argument, that
    Plunderphonics is an American art form.  This is not to denigrate the
    incredible contributions of Canadian John Oswald, who not only coined the
    term, but whose music is the most lucid regarding fair-use and pop culture.
    Nor would I intend to belittle the French Musique Concrete innovators, who,
    in the beginning of the 1950s, took a critical look at both recording
    technology and the value of everyday sounds. The issue is that North
    American culture, and its popular music, is unique in its homogenization
    of a wide array of different cultures.</p><p>
    
    Take a piece like Charles Ives' ""Central Park in the Dark"", a perfect
    example. Composed between 1898 and 1907, it not only borrows from the
    popular songs and idioms of the time, it distorts, twists, and overlaps
    recognizable themes. The ensuing dissonance arising from an almost lulling
    string ostinato comes as a shock. Ives' goal, however, was a bit nobler than
    merely jarring his listeners; he just wanted to convey the sounds of a
    specific location, and that popular music was simply in the air. John
    Oswald later picked up on this notion, and with a sharp ear.</p><p>
    
    Then there's Carl Stalling, responsible for the soundtracks to Warner
    Brothers' golden age cartoons.  Stalling's work was a jumble of classical
    themes-- often Wagner and Debussy-- showtunes, and popular standards (he
    favored the work of the consistently inventive Raymond Scott).  Perhaps
    due to its delicate connection to the cartoons themselves, Stalling's work
    became a token example in any discussion of the connection between the
    visual and the aural. Composer/improviser/label-owner John Zorn has noted
    this plenty of times, and Stalling's influence on his approach to the
    interplay between genre, personal relationships and recorded music is
    consistently apparent in his work, with examples dating back to the late
    70s.</p><p>
    
    Also from the late 70s, The Residents' <i>Third Reich and Roll</i> is a full
    album of popular hits from the 60s and 70s mangled into... whatever kind of
    sound The Residents manage to make: Plunderphonic gurus Negativland once
    nicely summed The Residents' contribution to their <i>Escape from Noise</i>
    album as ""hoots and clanks."" Their intentions are clear from the start: to
    emphasize just how analogous fascism is to autonomous, icon-laden popular
    music. To arrive at this slant, The Residents-- who have yet to disclose
    their identities-- had to have placed an enormous amount of value on folk
    culture and its traditions. Folk culture somehow mutated into popular
    culture, which is possibly the most identifying aspect of America.</p><p>
    
    Popular music as we know it has become all encompassing, not just a reaction
    to the aforementioned issues, but also one of them.  We have self-martyring
    artistes retaliating against censorship, against intangible, intellectual
    freedoms.  Even by the time Plunderphonics' John Oswald came along, content
    was no longer an issue; what was relevant was the fact that you couldn't
    escape popular culture, even if you wanted to. Sound overflows in every
    aspect of our lives, containing advertisement and indoctrination: invisible,
    inaudible, and inescapable radio waves are constantly buzzing around our
    heads, all waiting to be channeled.</p><p>
    
    Oswald's personality isn't absent from the work, but he seems to take a
    degree of pleasure trying to remove his ego, by focusing so fixedly on other
    people's material. Wobbly, on the other hand, is attempting to put himself
    into the world, and watch it work around him: <i>Wild Why</i> is an album made
    up completely of hip-hop radio broadcasts. It is still, at a fundamental
    level, about being inundated with popular culture, but rather than feeling
    claustrophobic or upset by it, Wobbly embraces and aestheticizes it. <i>Wild
    Why</i>'s occasional exercises in rhythm, use of accessible, modern day hip-hop
    delineates him from Oswald's released work to this point, but perhaps not as
    much from his labelmates at Illegal Art, like Girl Talk or Steev Hise, or
    those at Tigerbeat6, like the much-praised Kid606.</p><p>
    
    Given the deconstructive history of Plunderphonics, aestheticization is a
    seemingly bizarre phenomenon, and <i>Wild Why</i> is in many ways a critical
    statement. Yes, it covers the strange way certain ideas and phrases saturate
    a musical culture with the collage of seventy or so ""yo's"" that greet the
    listener on the second track, but what's more striking is how Wobbly is
    simultaneously a product of this culture.</p><p>
    
    The Tigerbeat6 website describes <i>Wild Why</i> as having ""the structural rigor
    of New Music from the academy and the sue-me bravado of labelmate Kid606.""
    This is pure hype; Wobbly's album strives for that personal attention, and
    that's something John Oswald, The Residents, and Negativland-- in the early
    part of their career-- went to great lengths to eschew. Perhaps copyright
    laws have relaxed over the past ten years, but Wobbly seems to be making a
    plea for the spotlight.</p><p>
    
    Wobbly's a young, suburban kid, obviously keenly aware of his influences,
    and still insists on confronting copyright issues that, thanks to his
    predecessors, are already moot points. The content has clear precedent in
    John Oswald's work: <i>Wild Why</i> has some of the scope of a piece like
    ""Plexure"" (Oswald's dissection of the first decade of digital music), but
    with larger sample fragments, from a decidedly more recent gene pool. Also
    of note is the fact that Wobbly presents its work in a semi-accessible
    setting. It is rhythmic, divided into tracks that develop without complacent
    reliance on grating juxtapositions, and overall prove funny as shit.</p><p>
    
    Aside from its function as passing entertainment, Wobbly's album lacks the
    strength of the more theoretical thinkers that preceded him, and it seems
    obvious he wants to contend with that sphere. Emphasizing American culture's
    unconscious repetition and recycling of ideas is no longer poignant; that
    practice has been thoroughly appropriated by the culture it spoofs (look at
    the MTV Video Music Awards). The blatant sexuality, and issues of race and
    violence in hip-hop music have been duly noted, from within the genre
    itself. Though the painstaking time and effort that went into this release
    are truly commendable, at a fundamental level, <i>Wild Why</i> only asks
    that quintessential American question, ""Can I be famous?"" Perhaps, as far as
    Tigerbeat6 goes, Wobbly just wants to be famous on the collegekid circuit,
    but what kind of cultural statement is that?</p></div>"|8723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8723-wild-why/|4.9|Matthew Wellins

    begin and end with one Alex McManus, a seasoned veteran of the indie scene
    who has played with Empire State, Lambchop, Vic Chesnutt, and Bright Eyes.
    <i>The War of the Bruces</i> isn't his debut, but it might as well be: several
    years ago, he pressed a mere 500 copies of his first record, <i>Hialeah Pink</i>.
    He's shown ironclad reluctance to put out his own music, preferring the side
    of someone else's stage to his own spotlight, so it comes as a welcome
    surprise to his tiny coterie of fans to find that he's released an album
    one can own without a prerequisite pilgrimage to Atlanta's used record
    shops.</p><p>
    
    Anyone who hears <i>The War of the Bruces</i> is more than likely hearing The
    Bruces for the first time, and it's a fine introduction. Though he dips deep
    into the well of American roots music for inspiration, McManus does more
    than simply rehash folk and blues tunes with a rock 'n' roll beat. These
    songs are rarely louder than Robert Johnson, and always softer than Howlin'
    Wolf, which is a refreshing change from the pickpockets who believe the
    blues can't be played or sung too hard.</p><p>
    
    That said, <i>The War of the Bruces</i> isn't really a roots record; McManus
    re-envisions his source material like a less theatrical Tom Waits, replacing
    standard twelve-bar structures with an unpredictable-- and fascinating-- sense
    of drift, allowing for almost inexhaustible possibilities.  Instruments don't
    come in at a designated times, instead floating in and out unceremoniously.
    In the other hand, this might come off as irritating freeform, the musings of
    a jam band, even while McManus' overarching ideals nudge songs forward surely
    as Mark Twain guided Huck and Jim down the Mississippi.</p><p>
    
    Furthering this analogy, <i>The War of the Bruces</i> is a taut, spontaneous
    adventure, rather than some labored, self-conscious contrivance.  Nowhere is
    this better represented than its final stretch, where each song flows
    unnoticed into the next, with ominous noise rising up to threaten the
    strained tranquility of a seamless suite. Even without his other
    accomplishments, this is exhilarating stuff, a promising younger brother
    of <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>.</p><p>
    
    Yet, alluring as it may be, <i>The War of the Bruces</i> certainly won't
    attain the dizzying critical popularity of Wilco's recent triumph, for a few
    regrettable reasons. First, McManus' voice sometimes borders on a warble,
    wavering too much for popular tastes. His lyrics are also spotty, and
    occasionally-- but very noticeably-- transpose vulgarity and sincerity.
    Lastly-- and this is an injustice-- the album's sparse, unstructured feel
    will turn off listeners who demand overt song structures. The running order
    raises that hurdle higher, sequencing the album's least effective experiments
    before its last-lap sprint to glory.  Still, for those with an open mind and
    a modicum of patience, there's much to love about this mysterious record.</p></div>"|977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/977-the-war-of-the-bruces/|8.2|Brian James

    acceptance seldom found outside totalitarianism.  Most memorably, Beck's crystalline <i>Mutations</i>
    was relegated to busywork status while the distinction of follow-up to <i>Odelay</i> was reserved for
    the vastly inferior <i>Midnite Vultures</i>.  Record industry muckety-mucks had miraculously succeeded
    where scientists had failed: in splitting the Beck, yielding one salaciously marketable flavor-hijacker,
    one dour, lovelorn folkie, and one 10-kiloton explosion of inconceivable destructive power (though the
    latter has yet to see the inside of a Sam Goody).</p><p>
    
    But if the music industry is not bound by the ordinary laws of time and logic, then certainly neither is
    Pitchfork.  And thus, I can state without fear of contradiction or absurdity that I have been waiting for
    the track that follows ""Raining in Darling""-- the final tune on Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's <i>I See a
    Darkness</i>-- since 1999.</p><p>
    
    Now, even by a conservative estimate, I can count some fifty Will Oldham tracks between the conclusion of
    <i>I See a Darkness</i> and the release of <i>Master and Everyone</i>, without even including his
    collaborations with the Boxhead Ensemble, Rian Murphy, Johnny Cash or Dave Pajo.  But nothing on the rare
    gems compilation <i>Guarapero: Lost Blues 2</i>; nor his experimental collaboration with Mick Turner and
    a book of old Rabindranath Tagore poems, <i>Get on Jolly</i>; nor the minimalist <i>Ode Music</i> soundtrack;
    nor his amped-up covers EP, <i>More Revery</i>; nor the disturbingly smooth adult-contempo album, <i>Ease
    Down the Road</i> have even come close to the sonorous danse macabre of <i>I See a Darkness</i>.  Oldham's
    relentless prolificity aside, the skullfaced <i>Darkness</i> still awaits its true successor.</p><p>
<i>Master and Everyone</i> is probably not it.  Not that <i>Master and Everyone</i> isn't a fine record--
    it is.  But like much of Oldham's recent output, it never achieves the black solemnity of <i>I See a
    Darkness</i>, or even the ramshackle eroticism of <i>Viva Last Blues</i>-- arguably, Oldham's best works.
    It's sparse without being immediate, ruminative without being particularly profound, and somewhat sadly,
    confessional without sounding at all redemptive.  In a world where chronology serves marketing and music
    criticism, <i>Master and Everyone</i> is Oldham's follow-up to <i>Arise, Therefore</i>.</p><p>
<i>Master and Everyone</i> has a stark whiteness about it: bare branches and gathering dark.  ""Winter comes
    and snow/ I can't marry you, you know,"" opens the first track, ""The Way""; even the gently swelling strings
    under the chorus, ""Love me the way I love you,"" hardly warm the song at all.  Though seemingly intimate,
    Oldham still sounds like he's singing in a cavern.  The song is so bleakly quiet you can hear the icicles
    dripping.</p><p>
    
    The deadening duet, ""Ain't You Wealthy, Ain't You Wise?"", is even more withdrawn; the refrain, ""There's no
    pain to lament/ And no dream undreamt,"" seems to mock optimism as cruelly as the presence of female
    accompanist Marty Slayton mocks companionship.  The sparse title track lies little more than a plaintive
    guitar strum beneath what amounts to a post-breakup resolution: ""I am now free/ A master and everyone/
    Servant of all and servant to none.""  Oddly enough, this struck me as something straight out of Martin
    Luther; his 1520 tract, <i>The Freedom of Christian</i>, reads: ""A Christian is a perfectly free master
    of all, subject to none.  A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.""  Weird.</p><p>
    
    This would be (and may indeed be) a stretch were the album not utterly suffused with a deeply confessional
    Christianity.  To be sure, the language and imagery of religion has always been an integral part of Oldham's
    songwriting, but always rather ambivalently-- as repressive and hypocritical, as well as authentic and
    redemptive.  The boy in the Palace Brothers' stunning early tune, ""Riding"", summed it up best when he
    retorted, ""God is what I make of him.""  On <i>Master and Everyone</i>, however, Oldham seems to flirt with
    downright evangelism.  In ""Maundering"", Oldham proclaims that he is ""going to find something true,"" singing,
    ""Evil is as evil do/ God is always showing this to you/ I'm going to glorify everything good/ And put right
    what is wrong as I should.""  Later, over the ringing acoustic pluck of ""Lessons from What's Poor"", Oldham
    lapses almost into psalm:</p><p>
<i>And if I hunger see that I do<br/>
    Bring me water; bring me food<br/>
    Fill me up with things that are true<br/>
    And very good...<br/>
    I take my lessons from what's poor<br/>
    That's what God has put me for<br/>
    Wealth is death; of that I'm sure<br/>
    Farewell.</i></p><p>
    
    But this rather grating homiletics seems to come and go (with the presence of the chirpy and no less
    grating Slayton).</p><p>
    
    The supremely stripped down ""Even If Love"" recalls the post-Slint, Pajo-inflected angularity of <i>Joya</i>,
    opening with the wonderful lyric, ""Once again in the world of 1200 feelings/ All in electric lights/ We see
    what we can,"" amidst a low, snaky guitar line.  Above all, the fiercely elegant ""Wolf Among Wolves"" remains
    <i>Master and Everyone</i>'s incomparable highlight, fusing skeletal acoustics with deep and subtle electronic
    noise underfoot, and punctuated with sharp falsetto howls.  ""Why can't I be loved as what I am?"" Oldham sings,
    ""A wolf among wolves/ And not as a man among men.""  ""Wolves"" is really the only track on <i>Master and
    Everyone</i> that eschews two-dimensional desolation or ham-fisted sanctification to accomplish something
    truly and believably introspective.</p><p>
    
    Time passes, but it's a fiction to clock the years by great albums.  <i>Master and Everyone</i> is a solid
    collection of rather thin songs that never quite sound intimate; songs that meant something profound to
    someone-- but always, it seems, someone else.  It is not a great album by any means, but it is a timely
    one.  Unnaturally cold, and weak like January sun.  Perhaps we can do what we want with chronology, but
    the seasons run of their own accord.  And right now, like the rest of America, it is winter in Louisville.</p></div>"|698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/698-master-and-everyone/|6.0|Brent S. Sirota

    love and respect his captor-- is real, and if you're skeptical, you can

    of ""Sheets of Easter"" is one of the least enticing ways I can imagine opening
    a record, yet somehow, after absorbing the full impact of this 14-minute
    onslaught, I realized I'd enjoyed myself.  It's hard to recommend a relentlessly
    hypnotic slab of skull-crushing repetition, but ""Sheets of Easter"" is exactly
    the sort of ballsy move that makes so many love and respect Oneida.  Churning
    guitars cycle a heart-stopping riff ad nauseam, but the effect is so mesmerizing,
    it's hard to fault the band for stealing a quarter-hour of my life away.</p><p>
    
    During ""Antibiotics"", the second and final track on disc one, Oneida sets
    the brain-blender from frappe to puree.  It begins with a slick organ line
    courtesy of Fat Bobby, and seems to tout another sixteen minutes of
    intoxicating drone, but that catchy melody gives way, mutating in fractal
    order and deviating further and further from its set course.  Guitars flare
    up, slightly off-cue, effects kick in unexpectedly, and the keyboard riff
    itself slithers into a different skin.  From deep within the ever-changing
    swirl-- and just past the ten-minute mark-- an actual song emerges, but
    naturally, the shit hits the fan.  What became solid for a moment soon
    collapses.  There are no survivors.</p><p>
    
    The first disc is startlingly entertaining, given its repetitive nature, but
    its only real purpose is preparation-- an overblown effort to numb the
    listener's senses-- as without its tirades as contrast, disc two is terribly
    dull.  Oneida has until now thrived on full-tilt sonic pandemonium, songs
    like ""All Arounder"", ""Pure Light Invasion"", and the hilarious, brilliant
    ""Fat Bobby's Black Thumb"", but somewhere between <i>Anthem of the Moon</i>
    and their latest, their signature aural riot has dispersed.  Guitarist Papa
    Crazy and bassist Hanoi Jane have improved considerably, but that hurts more
    than it helps: they seem content to reproduce the pummeling assault of disc
    one, yet in their increased technical assurance, they lose the primal fury of
    old.</p><p>
    
    Disc two does hide a pair of choice cuts-- ""Black Chamber"" and ""No Label""--
    which benefit from Fat Bobby's swank organ and a killer bass roll.  On the
    downside, they're stranded at the end of an otherwise monotonous set, and
    neither plays to the band's frantic strength.  A handful of similarly decent
    tracks would have eliminated the need for a first disc of will-snapping
    indoctrination; <i>Each One Teach One</i> leads with a sucker-punch, and
    Oneida spend the rest of the album praying the superintendent breaks things
    up before everyone realizes they've forgotten how to fight.</p></div>"|5996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5996-each-one-teach-one/|6.5|Eric Carr

    skills, we're stuck with it for the foreseeable future.  We valiantly try to communicate and create shared
    understanding, to define and relate, to create certainty in the world around us, all through the use of
    language, but in the end, if my idea of chair isn't exactly the same as your idea of a chair (which it's
    not), then what's the point?  Sometimes it seems like language causes as many problems as it solves, and
    maybe we'd all be better off shutting up and looking for a better method.  In that case, it's like my mom
    always said: ""If you don't have anything nice to say, release a staggering debut CD of wordless, transportive
    beauty.""  I never put much stock in it, but Out Hud certainly paid attention, and here comes <i>S.T.R.E.E.T.
    D.A.D.</i>, their answer to the brain's imperfect linguistic domineering.  Out Hud can express more in one
    elegant passage than a week's worth of Derrida, and all without saying a word.</p><p>
    
    Okay, fine-- Out Hud versus the human brain?  Clearly, that's going a bit far, but <i>S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.</i>
    is similarly difficult to dissect.  Although its darkly evocative compositions are filled with unspoken imagery
    and emotion, and each track feels like so much more than the sum of its instruments, Out Hud can't be so
    easily reduced to a simple genre classifier.  What sets them apart is the populist edge of these heady tracks;
    their overtly cerebral complexity is perfectly suffused with dynamic, vibrant rhythm.  Frequently, music that
    traffics in composition as complex as Out Hud's is so dense or rigid as to be entirely indecipherable, suited
    more toward turtlenecked discussion and heavy-duty beard-stroking than any sort of visceral enjoyment.
    Instead of simply confounding its listeners, however, Out Hud enfolds them deep within its vast sonic spaces,
    thanks largely to a potent assortment of industrial-strength dub beats and neo-disco laid down alternately
    by Tyler Pope's drum programming and actual drummer Phyllis Forbes.  Out Hud's sprawling works short-circuit
    traditional neural pathways, wire the brain directly to the feet, and actively stimulate both.</p><p>
    
    Even the most inert among you should be compelled to move when confronted with such an irresistible force.
    Fluid tempo changes create a true sense of drama within a few short minutes; tracks rise and fall, build
    and collapse.  Call it a fusion of the practical and the fanciful; intellectual depth combined with instant
    accessibility.  The effect is dizzying, but totally inviting, and before you realize it, the virulent drum
    patterns and percussive effects have taken their toll.  The once-elusive arrangements that might have
    remained forever out of reach now surround you.</p><p>
    
    But these guys are just getting warmed up; a tangle of tonic moods and atmospheres carries you down familiar,
    but implacable, rain-slicked streets.  You sit in on late-night dealings and seamy, emotional back-room
    confessions.  Long, low drones create a palpable sense of tension behind it all, and distant echoes hint at
    danger just out of sight, but an optimistic guitar refrain indicates that there may be light at the end of
    tunnel after all.  Whole albums often fail to deliver music this poetic, and Out Hud manages it all in a
    single track, the aptly named ""The Story of the Whole Thing"".  Out Hud excel at creating atmospheres,
    allowing the listener to read into the music, and it's this subtle ambiguity of intention that makes
    <i>S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.</i>'s mystique so intriguing.  For forty minutes, this band weaves together a
    mystifying array of audio noir; there's an almost imperceptible threat to the music, but time and again,
    it proves too compelling to turn away from.</p><p>
    
    Out Hud also back up their flash with remarkable substance, setting their music apart from anything as
    one-dimensional as standard club offerings or moody trance cuts.  In many ways, <i>S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.</i>
    can stand toe to toe with some of the best of the IDM genre, which is no mean feat for music so heavily
    rooted in organic sounds.  Of course, the drumming has a lot to do with that, but no more so than the
    band's other instrumentation.  Nic Offer's bass seamlessly syncs with the beat to form a slow, soulful
    underpinning on these songs, and Tyler Pope wrings every manner of noise out of his six strings.  In
    particular, the guitar theatrics are jaw-dropping; it echoes across the channels in time with the rhythm
    while simultaneously shattering the calm with a jangling blast of noise on ""Dad, There's a Little Phrase
    Called 'Too Much Information'"", as just one example of Pope's invention.   Offer runs his keyboard through
    every possible role, from driving the melody to vicious crescendos of noise, and along with Molly Schnick's
    versatile cello as a percussive and melodic force, it's hard to imagine fully exploring the near-unfathomable
    reaches of Out Hud's tunes.</p><p>
    
    After a handful of vinyl-only releases, Out Hud's first CD made me briefly reconsider the merits of the
    vinyl medium, if only as a means of obtaining their other works.  Fortunately, there's enough material here
    to keep me busy with Out Hud for a long time.  Of course, attempting to describe the effect with words is
    a little silly, but the album's strong enough that I had to try.  You're better off just listening.</p></div>"|6059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6059-street-dad/|9.0|Eric Carr

    seeing a photograph of her singing at the 1989 Grammys, clad in a sleeveless
    top and torn jeans, mouth open wide, six inches from the microphone, with
    Public Enemy's logo painted on the side of her beautiful bald head. She was
    singing ""Mandinka"", and the PE logo was in protest of the event's poor
    representation of hip-hop. When she was nominated for four awards the next
    year, she told the Recording Academy to shove it.</p><p>
    In those days, Sinead was always provocative. She was all heart and no head,
    a poor makeup for a mass media figure, and she also happened to be out of
    step with a straight-laced America that hadn't quite shaken off a twelve-year
    Republican hangover. Her public gaffes and meltdowns during the early 90s are
    the stuff of legend. Fucking MC Hammer offered her money to leave the country,
    and she took him up on it-- this girl was practically the Eminem of her day.</p><p>
    She's chilled out since, of course.  In recent years, she's studied opera, had
    bit parts in films, birthed another baby, made the occasionally stupid remark
    in interviews, and issued some records; some I liked (the <i>Gospel Oak</i> EP),
    some I didn't (<i>Faith and Courage</i>).  Now she returns with a record she's
    always wanted to make, an album of traditional Irish folk songs.</p><p>
    I pulled out <i>The Lion and the Cobra</i> for the first time in a couple
    years after hearing <i>Sean-Nós Nua</i>, and it's amazing how much O'Connor's
    presence has changed. The character of her voice is pretty much the same, but
    her approach to the songs couldn't be more different. <i>The Lion and the
    Cobra</i> is, in my opinion, among the better debuts of the last 15 years, and
    definitely one of the most confident. On <i>Sean-Nós Nua</i>, in contrast,
    O'Connor sounds very relaxed, and ultimately humbled by the ancient material.
    She resists the temptation to use her vocal tics and affectations; for the most
    part, she sings the words with a straightforward clarity and reverence.</p><p>
    As a listener living in America, in this post-<i>Riverdance</i> world, I feel a
    bit handicapped by the production choices on <i>Sean-Nós Nua</i>. Overly lush
    Celtic music turns up in all sorts of unwelcome places these days, and the
    distinct sounds of its tradition-- the pennywhistles, fiddles, and accordions--
    are all over <i>Sean-Nós Nua</i>, presented in pretty much the same pedestrian
    way I usually encounter them. Occasionally, I can get past it: ""Peggy Gordon"",
    mostly just voice and acoustic guitar, is absolutely gorgeous, and Sinead's
    delivery of ""Lord Franklin"" is almost as pretty. ""Óró Sé Do Bheatha 'Bhaile"",
    a protest song with a reggae lilt (which happens to be the only song here I
    know well), is handled expertly.</p><p>
    But as much as I hate to admit it, it's odd hearing Sinead singing songs that
    seem removed from her direct experience. When Shane McGowan sings an Irish
    ballad about struggle, it's easy for me to get lost in the theatricality of
    his presentation-- perhaps because his grizzled voice has such strong everyman
    connotations-- but Sinead is always Sinead; despite her considerable vocal
    talents, she was born to sing her own words.</p></div>"|5942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5942-sean-nos-nua/|6.3|Mark Richardson

    ""Lokki"" or the spaced-out ambience of parts I-IV of the title track on this
    live album by the Finnish band Circle.  There's a case for the old German
    guard provoking the vaguely druggy, pseudo lo-fi curtain which clouds this
    recording, but then, any number of scenes (or drugs) could've been
    responsible for that.  For all we know, it could've been an entirely
    isolated idea to obscure the small details of these tunes in analog haze,
    and Circle win points for their bizarre audience manipulations.  The lasting
    effect is not one of aural namedropping, but truly out-there exploration;
    it's also definitely a rock album, as opposed to some acid trip with drums.
    Sure, things get a little out of hand in places, and Circle's sort of dank,
    medieval trance isn't the first thing I'd recommend to my sister, but everyone
    needs a scare now and then, right?</p><p>
    Circle's first EPs (<i>Silver</i>, <i>DNA</i>, <i>Point</i>) were too rare--
    and possibly a few years early for the post-rock boom-- to make much of a
    splash outside of early-90s Finland.  The band began as noisy proponents of
    the Krautrock groove (I'd say they were more Amon Düül II than Neu!), but
    could as often erupt into no-wave tantrums as hard, sweeping beat sagas.
    Furthermore, bassist Jussi Lehtisalo's old black-magic-via-Judas Priest
    vocals introduced a decidedly non-Kraut sense of dread into the mix, placing
    Circle nearer the lineage of mystical (bordering on mythological) prog, more
    akin to the darkest Magma.  They've refined their sound a tad over the past
    few years, becoming either a great post-rock band, or one of the worst metal
    acts going.</p><p>
    For the most part, Circle play it cool on <i>Raunio</i>.  Except for the chaotic
    drone of ""Potto"" (a possible Acid Mothers homage), the mean noise level is
    fairly low, and the dynamics are so extended as to hide any spikes.  The
    most interesting moments occur during the markedly calm instances, especially
    on the title ""suite.""  ""Raunio IV"" is the most serene of the bunch, featuring
    spoken word narration over a soft, humming noise-cycle, a synth chord, and the
    distant sound of someone flipping electrical switches (well, either that or
    dripping water, but the sounds are abstracted to such an extent that it's
    pointless to attempt a guess at what's actually happening).  ""IV"" leads to
    the bonus track ""Raubonmix"", a tune that ups the lo-fi factor, churning out
    an otherworldly, dream-state stupor.  The soaking wet Rhodes keyboard, which
    might otherwise suggest any number of hip (read: moronic) 70s soul-jazz
    throwbacks, lends an angelic timbre to an already light-footed trip.</p><p>
    Some of the music here does stretch out a bit too much, though.  The
    aforementioned ""Potto"" is truly an affront to the senses, but after a
    time, you become numb.  Likewise, the metallic motorik of ""Lokki"" is
    almost thrilling-- as thrilling as oppressive trance-rock gets-- for
    the first six minutes, but eventually I lose track of time, and wonder
    why this tune couldn't have taken the same route as ""Dedofiktion"" (from
    2000's <i>Prospekt</i>), which substituted relentless propulsion for this
    bland, epic goth.</p><p>
    Excepting the sometimes-cloudy sound (which actually adds an appreciated
    mystique), this is a decent album for any newcomer to Circle's work.  1996's
    compilation of their early EPs (<i>Kollekt</i>) and the aforementioned
    <i>Prospekt</i> are where I'd head next, though it'll probably take some
    time to digest the murky stew of <i>Raunio</i>.  Circle's popularity may
    never fall in line with fellow droners Tortoise, GY!BE or Mogwai--
    especially since post-rock is on life-support anyway-- but freaks on the
    outer rim will know what's up.</p></div>"|1474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1474-raunio/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    Garage rock, new wave, electroclash; it all sounds suspect to me.  When I
    hear that two major players from a scene that's but a fart on the current
    musical radar are setting their sights on the flatulent du jour, I approach
    with caution. Like Blue Pepsi and MTV's <i>The Real World</i>, it's all about
    creating the next big thing and milking that motherfucker bone dry.</p><p>
    
    Many moments on the long-delayed <i>Machine Says Yes</i> indicate the album is
    a labor of love.  Just listen to ""Fear of Guitars"", featuring the downed vocals
    of Super Furry Animal Gruff Rhys and a devastating second half, or the Mr.
    Oizo gangsta limp of ""Bleep Freak""; even the title track's easy hook proves
    there's some soul backing Kahuna brothers Daniel Ormondroyd and Jon Nowell.
    But for every infectious spark of danceable funk glitter, there's the rotting
    smell of formula.  With repeated exposure, you build up an immunity to this
    kind of thing, and if you were alive in 1994, chances are, you've already been
    vaccinated.</p><p>
    
    The bulk of <i>Machine Says Yes</i> draws heavily on the rhythms and studio
    techniques of FC Kahuna's big beat roots, and garnishes them vigorously with
    the robotic female vocals and canned electro beats of Ladytron or Peaches; it
    gets old faster than Wesley Willis.  Their technique works on the title
    track, whose fat, grainy bassline is well complimented by the darker Tiga
    remix, but every other attempt seems to fall all over itself: the stomping
    Oizo ripoff ""Nothing Is Wrong"" is saddled with vocals that approximate
    ""Short Dick Man"", and the irrational dunce tune behind ""North Pole
    Transmission""-- who doesn't own <i>Dig Your Own Hole</i>?-- are just begging
    for the skip button.  Kahuna's icy, lazy Portishead imitation-- the much-hyped
    ""Hayling"", which features Gusgus member Hafdis Huld on vocals-- hides no mystery.
    Beneath its surface, ""Hayling"" is tailor-made for an <i>Ultimate Chill</i>
    compilation.</p><p>
    
    As empty-headed as it can be, big beat can get some asses shakin', and tracks
    like ""Glitterball"" and ""Microcuts"", the latter featuring filtered hats and
    a prickly synth line, are a lock on any party's stereo.  Yet, while FC Kahuna
    can be catchy, they're never solid: too much calculation has gone into <i>Machine
    Says Yes</i>.  The record smacks of market research, not the craven, late-night
    interplay that communicates real soul.</p><p>
    
    The Kahunas claim some of this material has been on their hard drives since
    the late-90s, which, while a possible explanation for the album's jarring
    fluctuations in sonic clarity, fails to explicate the supernatural force
    that drives nice men like Daniel and John to treat music like a family-sized
    bandwagon stuffed with bales of cash.  How many 2003 car commercials will
    feature FC Kahuna backbeats?  Place your bets, folks.</p></div>"|3020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3020-machine-says-yes/|4.7|Mark Martelli

    music! The sounds of orotund synthesizers, reverberating endlessly to frame
    after frame of NASA stock footage. Muscular men donning their extravehicular
    spacesuits, spinning, floating, training, all to the ominous coalescence of
    warm, human melody and cold, amoral machine, simultaneously comforting the
    listener and foreshadowing the impending havoc built into its very design!</p><p>
    
    This completely prosaic theme is now so thoroughly exhausted it can hardly
    be seen as anything but parody.  For whatever reason, this hasn't stopped
    Casino Versus Japan from exploring the possibilities one more time.  Without
    frills, surprises, or even any particularly enjoyable music, <i>Whole Numbers
    Play the Basics</i> barely has the capacity to exemplify the exhausted notion
    of ""futuristic pop music"" it posits.</p><p>
    
    By the time you reach ""Summer Clip"", there's no doubt Eric Kowalski (aka
    Casino Versus Japan) is trying to unload the exact same song for the sixth
    time. What's striking-- more than the severely lacking theme-- is the
    monochromatic way Kowalski approaches his work. Modal Casio passages,
    heavy echo effects, and distorted, ham-fisted beats carry out a drudging
    procession of thoughtless electronic wank. The album grinds away at your
    patience with its insular and self-perpetuating pseudo-nostalgia, all
    artless calisthenics.</p><p>
    
    So, obviously, lack of thematic originality and simple narrow-mindedness
    factor in, but I'd be doing the listener a great disservice to ignore the
    possibility that Casino Versus Japan is also blatantly plagiaristic. Take
    a listen to the much-revered Tomita's body of work, or compare Casino
    Versus Japan's ""Koma Sign-Off"" with the second track from Aphex Twin's
    <i>Selected Ambient Works II</i>, and you'll start to get the picture.
    It's baffling how far one can stretch such derivative notions.  But what's
    more baffling is the fact that many people will hear this albums and enjoy
    it.</p><p>
<i>Whole Numbers Play the Basics</i> makes sense as background music on
    your college radio station, as filler for a mixtape, as the soundtrack to
    your iMovie; it's genrified wallpaper, as instantly recognizable as
    surf-rock or Sinatra, and an obvious calling card for any advertising
    exec seeking low-budget electronica with which to sucker his target
    market.</p></div>"|1334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1334-whole-numbers-play-the-basics/|3.3|Matthew Wellins

For one,
    what the fuck is up with the double-capitalized T's at the end of his name?  I hereby refuse to do it for
    the rest of the review (and if it still appears, it's all on Ott).  Secondly, two discs?  Nearly two hours
    of music?  This hasn't even worked out for the best of them-- ask Billy Corgan and Jay-Z.  There's actually
    a great album buried in here, but the key word is <i>buried</i>, and Cody, I have to say it, you are one
    misogynistic piece of shit.  I get the feeling it's just a big joke to you, but I'd be lax in my liberal
    guilt if I didn't say something about it.  Grow up.</p><p>
    And yet, there's something about <i>The Headphone Masterpiece</i> I just can't help but love.  Sure, the
    double-disc thing is complete overkill, but you've gotta respect the fucking gall it takes to dump something
    this overly ambitious on an unsuspecting public as your debut.  Chesnutt's also stumbled upon an absolutely
    killer gimmick, running soul/funk/what-have-you through a GBV filter of tape hiss and fragmented arrangements.
    It's a recipe designed to kill with indie rockers looking to branch out, and it sure as hell slew me.</p><p>
    With all these journalistic jumping points at play, it's clear why Chesnutt's got the hype-o-meter needle
    rapidly on the rise-- it was just given a significant boost by his eye-raising appearance on The Roots'
    cover of his own ""The Seed"".  But Chesnutt is simply a damned interesting guy; one could easily imagine
    him stepping into the role The Streets' Mike Skinner currently holds, that of hyper-profiled basement
    visionary and loner suddenly thrust into the limelight.  Cody even has his own ""Weak Become Heroes"", an
    anthemic celebration of his cultural sect called ""Serve This Royalty"", which concerns the ephemeral neo-soul
    genre rather than raver transcendence.</p><p>
    Of course, <i>Original Pirate Material</i> has less of the self-indulgence, lack of focus, and unbridled
    sonic and lyrical crudity that make <i>The Headphone Masterpiece</i> so frustrating, yet compelling.
    Chesnutt wastes no time letting his listeners know what they're in for, leading with a thirty-second
    Rhodes and vocal snippet that's followed by a lengthy bit of simplistic drum machination under guest-star
    spoken word poetry that-- I'm pretty sure-- contains the phrase ""hymen gauze.""</p><p>
    But just as you're ready to file the album under Project/Vanity, Chesnutt brings the goods: ""Upstairs in a
    Blowout"", a punchy two-minute slice of percussive guitar, remedial drums, and in-the-ballpark-of-on-key
    vocals.  The track indicates Chesnutt knows what he's doing with this lack of fidelity; done slick, the
    song could very easily pass for a Lenny Kravitz single, but loose and hissy, it has the raw immediacy
    lacking in modern-day waiting-room soul.  And while the superior ""realness"" of lo-fi music is a troublesome
    indie contention-- and I have no clue whether the four-track was chosen out of aesthetic or financial
    considerations-- <i>The Headphone Masterpiece</i>'s finest moments hearken back to the sepia-toned days of
    Stax/Volt grittiness, when the number of tracks available for recording was a technological rather than
    conscious limitation.  Chesnutt is no nostalgia act, thank God, but would it be wrong of me to think he's
    trying to link up with those simpler days, circumventing the last three decades of glossy soul crooning?</p><p>
    Theoretically exciting stuff, sure, but that's what makes it so tragic when the rest of disc one degenerates
    into catastrophe.  Promising beats are saddled with snippets of studio chatter rather than vocals (""Setting
    the System"", ""Batman v. Blackman""), embarrassingly juvenile, sexist pseudo-raps (""Bitch, I'm Broke"", ""War
    Between the Sexes""), and clichéd Soul 101 romances that fail to seduce (""Can We Teach Each Other"", ""Smoke
    and Love"").  The highlights-- Chesnutt's hypersexual egotism takes on a tone of evolutionary bravado in
    ""The Seed"" and the Latin folk/laser-snare contrast of ""Michelle""-- are far too occasional; the amount of
    filler in these twenty-three tracks far exceeds regulations.</p><p>
    When disc two started with a great piano loop squandered beneath a five-minute conversation between Chesnutt
    and his cousin, I prepared myself for further exasperation, but what followed was, astonishingly, Chesnutt
    living up to about 90% of his potential, minus the in-jokes, offensiveness, and undercooked ideas.  Were the
    two discs of <i>The Headphone Masterpiece</i> released separately, this would serve as the payoff to disc
    one's flawed declaration of potential.  Many of the tracks benefit from reductionist arrangements, like the
    simple strum and short harmonica puffs of ""My Women, My Guitars"", the nearly a capella ""Somebody's Parent"",
    and the electric piano monologue ""5 on a Joyride"".  Purified to the basics, Chesnutt shows himself both
    skilled in melody and capable of holding your attention with the minimum trappings, though this is due in
    no small part to the off-putting, lo-fi intimacy.</p><p>
    Nowhere else on the album does Chesnutt's Tascam talent shine through like it does on ""If We Don't Disagree"",
    which capitalizes not on simplicity, but on that most exhilarating of lo-fi moments: when a clearly epic song
    pushes up against the sonic limitations of the equipment, producing an exquisite tension I'll refer to as
    ""Pollardism.""  ""6 Seconds"" and ""Look Good in Leather"" show similar mastery and comfort with his own sound,
    the former inhabiting classic soul without spilling over into retro, and the latter wrapping his boasts in
    a funky strut that-- just barely-- makes his ego palatable.</p><p>
    Naturally, disc two has its own dead weight, like the atmospherically dull ""Juicin' the Dark"" and the goo-goo
    ga-ga's of ""Daddy's Baby"".  Trade ""Upstairs in a Blowout"" and ""The Seed"" for these duds, and a single-disc
    <i>Headphone Masterpiece</i> might've warranted a 9+ rating, a character profile that's as good as it is
    intriguing.  As it stands, a surplus of uniqueness overshadows a respectable aptitude, and whether or not
    it announces an Exciting New Talent, <i>The Headphone Masterpiece</i> is an album I want to like a lot more
    than I actually do.</p></div>"|1426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1426-the-headphone-masterpiece/|7.4|Rob Mitchum

    and you find yourself death-marched through repeated listenings of <i>Trout
    Mask Replica</i>, you'll probably start fantasizing-- right around the 17th
    time through ""Pena""-- about the days when you were free to listen to bands
    like The Sinking Ships. Apres-garde though they may be, this California
    quartet has an assured knack for winning pop songs, performing them with
    all due gracefulness, as they demonstrate on this would-be contraband, <i>Out
    of Key Harmony</i>.</p><p>
    
    The Sinking Ships add little to the basics of power-pop kept alive by the
    loving disciples of Big Star, but originality has never been a defining
    aspect of this genre. As Alex Chilton and Chris Bell watched prog-rock
    flower with jaundiced eyes, so, too, do the Ships turn away from a purportedly
    progressive world that tags a homophobic misogynist like Eminem the wave of
    the future. And why not; their wall-to-wall guitar jangle still sounds fresh
    and exciting, even after years of moderate-to-heavy usage.</p><p>
    
    Vocalist Katie Conley (ex-Holiday Flyer) shows why great singing will never
    go out of style, anti-commercial diktats notwithstanding; the sonic melange
    centers around her, and for good reason.  Though her tone may be too pure
    for those enraptured by sweat and strain, she has an aching, lovely voice
    with superb control, and loads of coy sexiness. Conley fares well among the
    dense textures featured here, but in two moments during ""Complicate Everything"",
    when the accompaniment is stripped almost entirely away, she reveals nuances
    that are regrettably buried on the rest of the album. Even during the record's
    busiest moments, she still commands much attention, sounding equally impressive
    at her fieriest as in gentler passages.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the band-- and <i>Out of Key Harmony</i> as a whole-- is decent,
    but tend to promise more than deliver. Their first handicap is an awkward mix,
    which suffocates everything that should be loud, and at crucial moments.
    Also, Matt Levine may be a fine rhythm guitarist, but his leads lack bite, a
    problem only intensified by the indiscriminately glossy production. The band
    could use some stinging ballast to balance their sugary tendencies, the way
    that Robert Quine and Richard Lloyd provided counterpoint to Matthew Sweet
    for his best work. Failing that, they could further pursue the subdued punk
    leanings that pop out joyfully in ""You Can't Push Me Away"" and ""Laughable"".
    Like Neil Young after <i>Harvest</i>, The Sinking Ships could head for the
    ditch and make things very interesting along the way, but as it stands, the
    band is only breezy at their worst, and thoroughly inviting at their best.</p></div>"|7187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7187-out-of-key-harmony/|7.4|Brian James

    impressionable age. Dozens of his songs begin with lines as piercingly disinterested as that book's laconic
    kickoff, ""Mom died today. Or maybe it was yesterday."" In aligning his leftovers for <i>Accumulation: None</i>,
    Callahan even seems to have aped the why-bother ethic of <i>The Stranger</i>'s casually murderous hero, who
    fired five of six bullets, then figured there's no point in committing to the foggy notion of comprehensiveness.</p><p>
    
    Why is Smog trudging into the random-comp-that-offers-one-new-song territory of Bon Jovi and U2?  What the
    hell is the organizing principle of this collection? It stumbles all around its eleven-year trajectory like
    a tranquilized unicorn. Callahan's logic in assembling this disc eludes me-- even though he scrounged up
    four ditties (a b-side, two BBC sessions, and the aforementioned freshmaker) not included on Pitchfork News'
    <a href=""/news/02-07/25.shtml""><u>long list of probable contenders</u></a>. And even that list leaves out
    the acoustic demo of ""Held"", as well as Callahan's two songs released as The Sundowners.</p><p>
    
    I have it on good authority that Smog concerts honor the refrain from Silver Jew David Berman's poem
    ""Cassette County"": ""anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship.""  Not that I'd know.  I'm sore
    about how Callahan-in-the-flesh has been running interference on me: the first time he toured the deep
    south, my then-squeeze and I missed out thanks to a fight straight out of one of Smog's songs, evaluating
    each other in terms of what we hated about our brothers and sisters. (We holed up in separate floors of the
    same hotel.)  The second time, my wallet disappeared at a gas station, only to later resurface via a phonecall
    from a ""Mr. Lovelady"" who said he'd found it in the middle of some street. (He returned the wallet to me with
    magazine cutouts of women's faces taped over my pictures on three IDs.)</p><p>
    
    So let me pretend to not be a frustrated Smog-huffer and examine <i>Accumulation: None</i> for what it is: a
    scabrous chronicle of Callahan's anhedonia that will bring any party down and which is guaranteed to unnerve
    those fatless freaks on the swim team. The cover art's blurry schooner behind shattered glass sets the tone,
    and brings to mind the bleak, horizonless sea-and-ship scene that adorns 1996's <i>The Doctor Came at Dawn</i>,
    whose ""All Your Women Things"" is akin to this comp's quasi-fetishistic duo ""Real Live Dress"" and ""Little Girl
    Shoes"".  ""Real Live Dress"" allows for further cross-referencing, since it blends the nightmare pluck of
    <i>The Doctor</i>'s ""Four Hearts in a Can"" with the dissonant backgrounds that leaven 2001's <i>Rain on
    Lens</i> and the anti-pop irony of ""Summer Song"", the B-side to the ""Sundowners"" seven-inch that's a
    simplistic drum-machine spoof of the booty fad-tunes that end up rocking seasonless roller-rinks. And
    even my advance warning cannot prepare you for how the last verse of ""Real Live Dress""  is copped from a
    certain knight who mixed a lot: Callahan croons, ""My Anaconda don't want none unless it's got buns, hon/
    Baby got back/ I like big butts.""</p><p>
<i>Accumulation: None</i> draws from the lo-fi, teenage Smog, who sounded-- let's face it-- like a
    schizophrenic Lou Barlow lost in some deleted scene from <i>Eraserhead</i> (""Astronaut"", ""Floating"", ""Hole
    in the Heart""), the mid-90s Smog, nearly eclipsed by Oldham-ness (""Spanish Moss"", country-rock revisitations
    of 1993's ""Chosen One"" and 1994's ""I Break Horses"", featuring Oldham-accompanist Colin Gagon), and finally,
    the contemporary how-am-I-doing-on-time Smog, who displays a proclivity toward fragmented narratives, and
    whose steadily yelping guitars could be undergoing genital mutilation.  ""Chosen One"" and ""I Break Horses""
    are especially noteworthy, as Callahan, drenched in BBC reverb, comes the closest he has yet to belting
    his lyrics, which adds a layer of passion not present in the sneering, resigned originals. Though tame
    compared to Smog's many songs about infidelity, familial sexual tension, physical abuse, masturbation and
    death, ""I Break Horses"" is often cited as prime evidence of misogyny, as he won't ""feed,"" ""ride"" or ""tend
    to"" the beasts of burden, identified as female. ""Tonight I'm swimming to my favorite island/ And I don't
    want to see you swimming behind,"" he yells, as the piano and drums churn; perhaps he'll soften in his golden
    years, and turn that island into a prison-themed daycare center.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, we're treated to the limp licks of the hilarious ""A Hit"", whose sludgy rhythm guitar suggests a
    pitch-shifted buzzsaw; Callahan expresses his fear of ending up ""a Gary Numan,"" since he'll ""never be a
    Bowie"" or ""an Eno.""  A dark new song titled ""White Ribbon"" involves a ready-bride ""with my coat buttoned
    up to her throat,"" whose balcony vanishings insinuate a double-suicide, or at least murder.
    But it's ""Came Blue"" that rules this mopey potpourri, and yes, it's actually about an indigo orgasm.
    Fittingly, Callahan's backed by a lone organ as he sings-- and sweetly for a Smog song-- ""There's a hunger
    in my hands/ I try to rub it into your body/ But I don't believe in this.""</p><p>
    
    Despite how I'd craved a box set, I'll admit that this smattering of non-album tracks works well; these
    twelve languishing, solitary songs are more powerful in this group context than they were on their
    scattershot own.  The record clearly shows that Smog has come quite some distance from his scritch-scratch
    tape-core beginnings, but furthermore, that Bill Callahan is <i>The Stranger</i>. He'd give you a knuckle
    instead of the finger. He'd report for battle with a bent bayonet. The cops outside his house don't know if
    he wants a standoff or surrender. His tombstone will read, ""You Hardly Knew Me.""  His favorite subject:
    emptyhandedness, emptyhandedness, emptyhandedness.</p></div>"|7285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7285-accumulation-none/|7.7|William Bowers

Putting their
    disc in and cranking the volume, I was knocked down by the hard rock: the
    best production money can buy turned their electric guitars into blurry
    flames, and shot the singer's Robert Plant wails right through the ceiling.
    My furniture bounced, doors shook in their frames, the cat humped the dog.
    Then I played it on headphones and it sounded like shit.  What gives?</p><p>
    
    This barely-legal Leeds quartet sounds more exciting than many recent
    British exports.  For all the ways they're derivative-- owing to the hard
    rock of Led Zeppelin, the Stone Roses and The Verve, and oddly even ZZ
    Top's <i>Eliminator</i>-- The Music also show signs of a style to call
    their own.  The problem is they just can't flush out a solid album yet:
    not unlike their recent US tourmates The Vines, The Music's debut sounds
    overproduced and underdeveloped.</p><p>
    
    Which isn't to say they're just another industry product.  What record label
    would let a band go out there with a name as fuck-you stupid as The Music;
    not only is it ridiculous, it makes them impossible to find on the web and
    the butt of any number of easy jokes.  But The Music might get away with it,
    because when they're on, they're gargantuan: Robert Harvey has all the lung
    capacity of his arena-rock idols, with a whiny twinge and enough of an accent
    to make it his own.  He can do the banshee wails and the blood-drenched yelps,
    as evidenced on the ululations during the chorus of ""The People"".  Alex Nutter
    wires his guitar through every gizmo the label could give him, and though it
    sometimes saps the sexual energy, it also makes his axe more thunderous.
    ""Take the Long Road and Walk It"" churns and roils before the band slowly
    unfurls ""Human"" and ""Too High""; the latter track is their epic, and they
    expertly pace it from the ethereal opening sheen to a scorching crescendo
    ushered by bleating vocals.</p><p>
    
    We already knew they could rock-- the title track from their first EP, <i>You
    Might as Well Try to Fuck Me</i>, rubs Nutter's raunchy guitar against those
    squeeze-my-lemon beltings in a no-nonsense, badass single that's certainly
    earned a place on some future <i>Nuggets</i> box set.  The change-up is how
    The Music flirt with becoming a dance band on this debut full-length.  Not
    just anyone can pull off the rock/dance mix that's so popular nowadays, and
    as expected, the record has its misfires-- particularly the thudding beat on
    the second half of the abysmally named ""Disco"" (remember, that title came
    from a band called The Music).</p><p>
    
    But then there's ""Float"", which is a complete blast: Harvey pulls off the switch
    from stage-dominating rock singer to party-starting MC, and we discover how Phil
    Jordan's sharp, crisp drums suit the crossbred electronica.  Harvey's cries
    drive an invisible rave that jumps higher and higher, almost smearing into
    sheer white noise before they cut it off.  After ""Float"", however, comes the
    bloat: The Music creep up to the hour-long mark-- breaking that seal with the
    U.S. bonus tracks-- which gives you far too much time to evaluate these guys.</p><p>
    
    Under the ruckus, they aren't great songwriters.  For example, their most
    stripped-down tune, ""Turn Out the Light"", is the worst power-ballad Diane
    Warren never wrote for Aerosmith.  Harvey's take on the chorus is catchy,
    but the melodramatic guitar riff is cliched from the first note.  Even when
    they have nothing to say, they keep on screaming as one emptily smoldering
    guitar solo bleeds into another.  At some point, your temples become battered
    by recycled melodies and silly lyrics, which teeter between nu-druid ramblings
    and Successories uplift about ""hope"" and ""dreams,"" and you just pray for it all
    to fucking stop, already.</p><p>
    
    More than Zeppelin, The Music resemble latter-day Rush, where technical achievement
    sterilizes sweat and fretboard filth-- but even Rush knew how to pace the technological
    tricks they employed.  In short, the Music either need to grow into their overwrought
    arrangements, or write more than three catchy pop songs.</p></div>"|5522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5522-the-music/|4.7|Chris Dahlen

    period, <i>Patchwork</i> takes bits and pieces of Faust's music and stitches
    together a typically disorientating program.  However, rather than focus on
    a particular period, the CD gathers sound from Faust's entire career
    (1971-2002), perhaps with the intention that, if enough stuff goes in the
    kettle, nothing recognizable will come out.  Because of the sheer oddness
    of most of the source music, people who've heard anything by the group will
    have no trouble picking out phrases and textures here and there.  In fact,
    the idea of throwing together all these disparate snippets is familiar
    enough for fans (see the aforementioned <i>Tapes</i>), so there's more than
    a little potential for déjà vu.</p><p>
    Where the band excels, however, is in their ability to make even the most
    basic elements of rock (and their own music, whatever you want to call that)
    seem alien.  Uwe Nettlebeck once said of Faust's music that it was supposed
    to sound like bootlegs, as if a passerby had tried to record all of their
    jams, and later faced down the daunting task of editing together all of the
    recorded fragments.  <i>Patchwork</i> follows this idea, particularly in the
    way Hans Joachim Irmler and Staubgold head Markus Detmer have applied a messy,
    almost muted mix to everything: fragments from the 1990s sound as if they might
    have been recorded twenty years prior, and vice versa.  In a way, this unifies
    the music, though for me, it's still difficult to pull the old songs out of
    their original context.  Perhaps this might've been more effective as a
    collage/remix of unreleased material; who knows.</p><p>
    The damning German exposition by Walter Adler, in which he curses the wasted
    time and money afforded Faust after their first record, opens <i>Patchwork</i>,
    but leads without pause-- and it turns out there are no pauses on this album--
    into ""Stretch Over All Times"".  This tune manages to fit sound from their
    entire lifespan into just over two minutes, though the most obvious sample
    comes from ""It's a Rainyday Sunshine Girl"".  Similarly, ""A Seventies Event""
    takes ""Krautrock"" and condenses it into a two-minute express mix.  Elsewhere,
    ""Psalter (Slow Version)"" lives up to its title, and ""Stretch Out"" offers its
    classic <i>Faust Tapes</i> bit in what sounds like Panoramic Subway Corridor
    Sound.</p><p>
<i>Patchwork</i> sounds best when either the editing completely deconstructs
    the source, or the music itself is new.  ""Ayi Ayi"" begins with an unintelligible,
    slowed-down vocal, gets stuck in a reverb cycle, and eventually fades out on
    driving motorbike distortion-- it would have fit beautifully on their first
    record.  ""Nervous"" is an incredible, uptempo proto-punk (or retro MC5) tune,
    featuring a sneering monotone vocal to make Lou Reed proud, and a viscous
    wah-wah solo.  ""Zerr:aus"" is an unreleased track from the Wümme sessions that's
    apparently Faust's version of exotic mood music, replete with wildly distorted
    trumpet and primal toms (of course).</p><p>
    The downside of collections like this is in how they emphasize just how
    great a band used to be.  Faust's releases in the 90s were intermittently
    great, but often unsettlingly monolithic for a band that made a practice of
    exposing-- and putting a little flange on-- its many-colored warts.
    <i>Patchwork</i> argues the band hasn't lost a shred of those idiosyncrasies,
    but still suffers in light of its classic precedents.  Though that's hardly a
    crime, it is a little disappointing in Faust's case.  In truth, most bands
    couldn't get away with throwing a bunch of their old stuff into a hat and
    remixing it, so it's to their credit that the set is, for the most part,
    interesting.  <i>Patchwork</i> makes a fine appendix for those well versed
    in Faust lore, but newcomers will likely suffocate under its weighty premise.</p></div>"|3015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3015-patchwork-1971-2002/|7.0|Dominique Leone

    to survive that decade.  It may be a grotesque thing to say, but if Nas had fallen after releasing a slew of
    classic singles and his startling debut <i>Illmatic</i>, he'd be every bit as revered as Biggie, 2Pac, Big
    Pun and Big L.  Instead, Nas has broken our hearts with a series of decent-to-mediocre albums that belittle
    both his considerable talent and the sheer brilliance of <i>Illmatic</i>.</p><p>
    
    Between 1996 and late 2001, Nas
    morphed into a studio gangsta, and seemingly turned his back on the audience that initially supported him.
    When his now-infamous feud with Jay-Z began, Nas was nursing a faltering career and had virtually no street
    cred; he found himself at the mercy of an adversary with half his talent but twice his hunger.  But rather
    than submit to a Jay-Z deathblow, Nas stepped back to the mic and began to revisit the lyrical mastery that
    characterized his early work.  If his rivalry with Jay fueled a partial comeback on <i>Stillmatic</i>,
    <i>God's Son</i> amasses him even more tumultuous ammunition.  Not a bad recovery for a year and a half's
    work.</p><p>
    
    Nas has been marginalized by the hip-hop community (or has marginalized himself, depending on which magazines
    you buy), endured the revelation that his child's mother had an affair with Jay-Z, and most tragically, dealt
    with the loss of his own mother.  The shadows of these ghosts can be found throughout <i>God's Son</i>: he
    mentions the affair in no less than three songs, and on the ""Last Real Nigger Alive"", details his various
    beefs with Wu-Tang, Biggie, and Jay.  If nothing else, the track is a revealing, semi-objective look at
    the long-rumored beef between the Wu's Raekwon, Nas, and Biggie, which, according to Nas, involved Raekwon
    and Biggie stealing his slang.  Nas ends the song with one last diss for Jay-Z, ""<i>The Gift and Curse</i>?
    Fuck that shit!  The first shall be last... I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo.""  <i>Damn...</i></p><p>
    
    The beauty of this album, of course, lies not in gossip, but in the emotional range and lyrical complexity
    Nas injects.  While he does give nods to the street on the grimy ""Get Down"", reminiscent of <i>Illmatic</i>'s
    ""New York State of Mind"", Nas also acknowledges that life isn't as straightforward as it once was; on the
    Eminem-produced ""The Cross"", Nas references his mother's death, then raps, ""And I don't need much but a Dutch,
    a bitch to fuck/ A six, a truck, some guns to bust/ I wish it was that simple.""  The pain of loss saturates
    the album, manifesting in various spots as a source of strength, sorrow, and regret.  It makes its presence
    known on the excellent ""Warrior Song"": ""Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket/ Your mother's
    the closest thing to God that you ever have, kid/ I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral?/
    Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real/ Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep
    still.""</p><p>
    
    The self-examination that inevitably accompanies the death of a loved one has also provoked a renewed sense
    of socio-political consciousness in Nas.  While he's always acknowledged that there's more to life than
    bustin' caps and smokin' blunts, Nas pushes these themes to the forefront on much of <i>God's Son</i>.  ""I
    Can"" may be one of his most commercially viable tracks to date; it jacks its melody from Beethoven's ""Fur
    Elise"", features a children's choir on its chorus, and in the first two verses, warns of drug abuse and the
    sexual exploitation of minors.  It's a nice enough sentiment, but it's also one we've been inundated with
    ad nauseam since first grade.  Still, as you're about to skip forward to the next track, Nas drops his finest
    example of radical black politics yet.  The verse bears repeating in full:</p><p>
<i>""Before we came to this country<br/>
    We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.<br/>
    It was empires in Africa called Kush,<br/>
    Timbuktu, where every race came to get books,<br/>
    To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,<br/>
    Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when<br/>
    Gold was converted to money it all changed.<br/>
    Money then became empowerment for Europeans,<br/>
    The Persian military invaded,<br/>
    They heard about the gold, the teachings<br/>
    and everything sacred.<br/>
    Africa was almost robbed naked.<br/>
    Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships.<br/>
    Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went.<br/>
    He wasn't shocked at the mountains with black faces<br/>
    Shot up they nose to impose what basically<br/>
    Still goes on today, you see?<br/>
    If the truth is told, the youth can grow<br/>
    They learn to survive until they gain control.""</i></p><p>
    
    In many ways, <i>God's Son</i> is lyrically superior to <i>Illmatic</i>. Nas has created an album that is
    at once mournful and resilient, street-savvy and academic.  As an MC, he's technically stunning. His
    arsenal of flows would make even Jay jealous (and likely does after ""Guns N' Roses""), and manages to be
    both rhythmically versatile and intellectually astute.  <i>Illmatic</i> was an incredibly sick album-- one
    of the sickest ever-- and its influence still hangs over rap, but <i>God's Son</i> may ultimately have more
    emotional depth, something far too few critics give hip-hop credit for.  This is the kind of album I'd have
    hoped that Biggie, Pac or Big L would've written had they survived.</p><p>
    
    What separates <i>Illmatic</i> from <i>God's Son</i>, though, and what ultimately robs this album of a 10.0,
    is the lukewarm production, some throwaway lines, and a slew of disposable hooks.  The musical mediocrity of
    ""Mastermind"" and the commercial disposability of ""Hey Nas"" could be overlooked but for the sheer garbled
    trash of ""Zone Out"", which kicks the rating down at least a full point.  Still, in this Age of the Producer,
    when most critics privilege form over content, regarding vocals as little more than musical instruments and
    preferring the safety of nonsensical lyrics, it's important that we remember the role of the MC in hip-hop,
    that of the innercity griot who captures all the stories, struggles, and secret language that slip through
    the media's cracks; the seer, who with one ear to the pavement and the other on his heart provokes and
    inspires.  On <i>God's Son</i>, Nas does all these things, effectively taking a bat to his ""one hot album
    every ten year average.""</p></div>"|5710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5710-gods-son/|8.6|Sam Chennault

The band came into the world
    over a decade ago as a purely nocturnal entity, seething with the dark tension
    of a savage hatred between the two main songwriters, and their music reflected
    this harrowing, if turgid melodrama.  Brett Anderson seemed to be living the
    sleazy rock lifestyle he sang about without ever glamorizing it: Suede's first
    two albums brim with violence, paranoia, sexuality and sinister energy.</p><p>
    
    Then guitarist and co-songwriter Bernard Butler left the band, a couple of kids
    joined up to fill his shoes, and everything changed.  That it took two people to
    replace Butler is indication of what a force he was in the band; after his
    departure, Suede began to sound decidedly less dangerous, and almost overbearingly
    glib.  Suddenly, Anderson's lyrics struck not so much like those of a man living
    the seedy clubbing lifestyle as a man who'd read about it in <i>Vogue</i>.  And
    Suede have never since returned to the shadows whence they came.</p><p>
    
    I've accepted this reality.  As much as I love those first two Suede records,
    I'm not one to begrudge a band the right to change.  Besides, the band's most
    recent material can be infectious, if not particularly meaningful-- I've even
    thought lightweight singles like ""The Beautiful Ones"" and ""Electricity"" oddly
    pleasing at times, and found the band's last attempt at sonic broadening, 1999's
    <i>Head Music</i>, fairly promising.  So you can imagine my disappointment to
    find that <i>A New Morning</i> backs away from even that.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, producer John Leckie has kept the low end from that prior album
    intact, avoiding a return to the tinny sound of <i>Coming Up</i>, which now
    strikes as seriously dated.  The bass throb rears itself most effectively on
    the more charged songs, like leadoff single ""Obsessions"" and the chunky rocker
    ""Streetlife"".  ""Obsessions"", with its harmonica refrain courtesy of new
    keyboardist Alex Lee, sounds curiously similar to The The circa 1993.  Not
    that you'd ever mistake Brett Anderson for Matt Johnson.</p><p>
    
    And speaking of Anderson, his voice has suffered the ravages of an entire
    Connecticut Valley tobacco field worth of cigarettes over the past ten years,
    and it's begun to show here and there.  He's not exactly croaking as per Tom
    Waits-- not yet, anyway-- but his smooth croon of old is certainly beginning
    to sound more lived-in.  He's still an impressive and distinctive vocalist,
    though, and aside from the sandpaper wear-and-tear, he's in good form for most
    of <i>A New Morning</i>.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, he's also still a distinctive lyricist, as well, and by that
    I mean distinctively awful.  Since <i>Coming Up</i>, he's struggled to widen
    his vocabulary beyond ""concrete,"" ""gasoline,"" and ""It's the way you ________,""
    and he continues to tread water here.  On ""Lonely Girls"", he skirts substantive
    examination of his subjects, instead opting to rattle off a series of brief
    anecdotes about each one's condition (sample: ""Maxine mixes alcohol with
    polythene and paint"").  And in fact, he's actually written this song before,
    except then it was about men, and it was called ""The Bentswood Boys.""  (This
    being a family website, we won't even discuss the horrors of ""Astral Girl."")</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to overcome consistently lame, often meaningless lyrics--
    especially with Suede's classic rock focus on singer and melody-- but they
    cope.  Bassist Matt Osman is always good for a snappy hook and a tight
    countermelody, while guitarist Richard Oakes-- but a wee teen when he joined
    Suede eight years ago-- continues to improve, absorbing everything from 70s
    glam-rock to George Harrison and spinning it back with aplomb.  He's also
    pulling out the acoustic more often these days, which helps the band to
    overcome the sometimes overly synthetic quality of their last two albums.</p><p>
    
    Where you stand on <i>A New Morning</i> hinges largely on where you already
    stand on Suede's other recent releases.  If you're strictly old-school,
    waiting for them to produce another <i>Dog Man Star</i>, don't bother, and
    while you're at it, stop waiting-- this band is obviously not interested in
    revisiting their past.  If, however, you loved the bounce of <i>Coming Up</i>,
    you'll likely be pleased with this offering, and particularly if you thought
    <i>Head Music</i> was a letdown.  As for me, I'm getting a bit bored with
    Suede's perpetual morning.  Is a little darkness too much to ask?</p></div>"|7551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7551-a-new-morning/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    Rilo Kiley's self-titled debut was catchy and smart, but erratic; the follow-up, last year's <i>Take Offs
    and Landings</i>, came off as languid and lazily paced, with undistinguished writing.  Now the L.A. quartet
    has recorded an album for Omaha, Nebraska's Saddle Creek-- home to Bright Eyes and The Faint, among countless
    others-- and it surpasses all of their earlier work: it's a dynamic album with intriguing lyrics, a
    country/folk shimmer, and explosive pop moments.</p><p>
    
    Jenny Lewis and Blake Sennett-- singers, guitarists, and incidentally, both grown-up child actors-- front
    the band and write the material.  They're joined by Pierre de Reeder and Jason Boesel on bass and drums,
    and some eclectic guest musicians (some pedal steel, but also accordion, strings, and even a little
    vibraphone for color).  Almost all of this stuff is used tastefully on the diverse material, and though
    this is their most complicated production so far, it stays loose enough for sudden explosions and guitar
    solo outbursts.</p><p>
    
    Lewis, singing lead on almost every song, is more restrained but more effective than on the earlier albums.
    She switches between two styles: at times she's blunt and plain-spoken, taking no shit and saying ""fuck"" a
    lot, which gets her compared to Liz Phair, everyone's favorite empowered indie rocker; at others, she takes
    on a quieter, melodic voice, marked by a bit of twang and a twinge of something doubtful-- an emotional edge
    that can be interpreted a dozen ways; it could hint that she doesn't believe herself, but more likely, that
    she doesn't think you believe her.  This edge enriches her bitter lyrics and helps the ecstatic ones soar.</p><p>
    
    The words here are descriptive and articulate, but gracefully rendered.  Perfect images and phrases litter
    the verses, some of them upbeat but more of them conflicted, like the scattered confrontations in ""Paint's
    Peeling"".  Lewis also gets autobiographical in her almost stilted poetry on ""And That's How I Choose to
    Remember It"", a calliope-sounding song about her parents that's been cut in three pieces and (somewhat
    obtrusively) slipped between the main tracks.</p><p>
    
    Around these frequently bleak lyrics, Lewis and Sennett wrote catchy and energetic music, with perfect
    hooks and choruses that knock down the walls.  ""Paint's Peeling"" and the title track have both entered
    ""repeat"" mode on my disc player, and the lilting strings on ""Capturing Moods"" are plain addictive.  Blake
    Sennett's turn on the loping ""So Long"" and the anthemic ""Three Hopeful Thoughts"" are effective, as well;
    he isn't a striking singer or, let's face it, as charismatic as Lewis, but he's genuine enough to sell
    lines like, ""I hope that I drive tonight/ Into the last of the great sunrises.""</p><p>
    
    You could call <i>The Execution of All Things</i> a feel-good album, but there's enough going on that it
    rarely sounds like froth.  Aside from a couple of twee missteps-- like the hyper-bouncy keyboards on ""My
    Slumbering Heart""-- the band almost always hits the right tone: they do Americana without the alt-country
    cliches and cowpoke pacing, and the undercurrent of environmental concern is rich rather than blunt.  So
    when they reach the last track, ""Spectacular Views"", they've earned a giddily big, vibrant California pop
    anthem, on which they completely let go and allow Lewis to take in the coast and the stars, screaming,
    ""It's so fucking beautiful!""  Who's gonna argue?</p></div>"|6788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6788-the-execution-of-all-things/|7.5|Chris Dahlen

    excited about-- the high-energy, no-frills rock spilling out of New York City. Seeing as how the press is
    unable to focus on more than one entity per fad, the receptacles of all that is supposedly great about the
    Big Apple scene is The Strokes, who have thus far produced a lone album of exciting yet hardly fulfilling
    music.  And obscured amidst this mushroom cloud of hype is The Rogers Sisters, a Brooklyn band that has now
    matched The Strokes' output with their debut, <i>Purely Evil</i>.</p><p>
    
    Media wonderment aside, the New York sound is nothing terribly new. The recycling of late-70s CBGBs has been
    chugging along since there was anything to recycle, which might explain the discouraging familiarity of The
    Rogers Sisters. <i>Purely Evil</i> sounds as if it should be fresh and daring, yet disappoints to the
    considerable degree that it settles for copping what was fresh and daring a quarter-century ago. The record
    plays like a warmed-over <i>Blank Generation</i>, an album of a type that tends to give more light than heat
    to its many imitators. Though they can't be faulted for their pedigree, The Rogers Sisters are certainly
    camping out in the canyon between good influences and good results, offering few real reasons for their
    record's existence.</p><p>
    
    This shortcoming stems from more than just a lack of originality. Rather, the Sisters deplete the good will
    they build up through their meaty sound and magnificent production flourishes with a countervailing immaturity
    that largely overshadows whatever else they accomplish. Anyone expecting credit for decrying the easy targets
    The Rogers Sisters take on with their cover art (SUVs, Martha Stewart, and that king of standby punching bags,
    George W. Bush) should be required to take a vow of silence, at least until a Democrat reassumes the
    presidency. Music trumps any issues of style, of course, but in this case, the latter proves to be a faithful
    indicator of the former.</p><p>
    
    While the Sisters thankfully avoid any smarmy anti-Dubya rants in their songs, they
    seem as if they're making music more for how it looks on paper than how well it slides into the ear. Their
    minimalist aesthetic, embodied most fully by their simplistic and recurring lyrics, just doesn't work out
    here. It sounds as though they were attempting to either mock the repetitiousness of pop music or push it
    through to some kind of minimalist trance, but they succeed at nothing so much as irritation. Lastly, no
    one in the band appears to be a skilled enough songwriter to consummate the teasing potential of their
    jagged, metallic sound. There are fine elements in <i>Purely Evil</i>, but no one should hold their breath
    waiting for them to come together.</p></div>"|6819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6819-purely-evil/|4.9|Brian James

    the kind of music that makes consciousness seem like an annoying state.  I
    hadn't yet heard the band when I read those words in his review of <i>Per
    Aspera Ad Astra</i>, but I knew I was going to soon. This was a time, if
    memory serves, when engagement with the everyday world of the senses took
    more courage than I could muster. A trip to Amoeba shortly after an email
    exchange with Samir netted me a copy of <i>Music for Nitrous Oxide</i>,
    which proved to be the perfect introduction. During that time I wanted my
    drone music to have as prickly an edge as possible, and the raw four-track
    transmission of <i>Music for Nitrous Oxide</i> was just the thing. Since
    then, Stars of the Lid have reflected on their aesthetic, decided on the
    core elements that make their music what it is, and refined the drones so
    that the minimum sound achieves maximum impact.</p><p>
<i>Avec Laudenum</i> was released on the Belgian label Sub Rosa in 2000, and
    is just now seeing domestic release. It's interesting to hear this record
    after 2001's <i>The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid</i>, which found Brian
    McBride and Adam Wiltzie coming into their own as studio composers. Knowing
    what came after, <i>Avec Laudenum</i> sounds a bit like a transitional record,
    capturing the duo at a point where they were reaching a plateau with their
    instrumental set-up, and just before they added the acoustic instruments that
    gave <i>The Tired Sounds</i> its unique feel. Everything here is so much more
    carefully recorded and layered than earlier releases like <i>The Ballasted
    Orchestra</i>, and yet the same elements are present.</p><p>
    
    During the first of three parts of ""The Atomium"", the gently modulating
    drones have the piercing clarity that occasionally approaches sine wave
    territory. This track also has one of the few instances of any sort of
    percussive sound on <i>Avec Laudenum</i>-- in this case, a sort of faint
    scraping that adds texture to the crystalline sheen. One doesn't normally
    associate the word ""rhythm"" with this band, but a couple tracks work up
    some tension through the repeated use of gradual swells of sound. The
    rising and falling feedback loops that make up ""The Atomium""'s second part
    accumulate over time like darkness in room at dusk. The third track in the
    suite sounds quite Fripp &amp; Eno, and the contrast provided by the ethereal
    keyboards and the snarling reverse tape of feedback makes it clear that this
    music comes from the collaboration of two distinct personalities. <i>Avec
    Laudenum</i> was composed through the mail as Wiltzie and McBride lived in
    different cities, and with the third part of ""The Atomium"", you can almost
    see a split screen of the two lonely men trotting out to their respective
    mailboxes.</p><p>
    
    Two fine tracks close out the record. I thought the title of ""Dust Breeding""
    sounded familiar, but it turns out it wasn't the first track from Christian
    Marclay's <i>Records</i> compilation I was thinking of, it was ""Gas Farming""
    from <i>The Tired Sounds</i>. Title aside, ""Dust Breeding"" does sound more
    like the two-disc epic that followed than any other track here, in its use
    of constantly shifting, shorter phrases that sound as though they were
    recorded in a cavernous space. The closing ""I Will Surround You"" uses a
    similar technique but dries the reverb just a bit, sounding even more
    lonesome and forlorn in the process. And then, in a characteristic move,
    the tone changes halfway through and the drones begin to ascend, ending
    on a note of uplift. <i>Avec Laudenum</i> is not much of a departure, but
    it stands as perhaps Stars of the Lid's most focused and precise record.
    And Stars of the Lid in The Zone can only be a good thing.</p></div>"|7478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7478-avec-laudenum/|8.0|Mark Richardson

Music Works is without question one of the most important and     influential organizations in post-rave electronic music. This parent     company, founded in the early 90s in Frankfurt, has under its umbrella     labels including Force Tracks, Force Lab, Mille Plateaux and Ritornell.     A staggering amount of quality electronic music has been released under     these imprints, from the experimental and abstract to the danceable and     club-friendly. If one could magically slice away the music released under     the auspices of Force Inc., the current electronic music scene would be     impossible to recognize.</p>
<p>In line with European intellectual trends, Force Inc. has never shied away     from engagement on a theoretical level. Not content to merely document     happenings, Force Inc., particularly with Mille Plateaux, has consistently     sought to shape the discourse on electronic music directly, by collecting     and presenting compilations that seek to define cultural trends, and     offering accompanying booklets with manifestos dense with post-structuralist     theory, particularly the ideas of Gilles Deluze (the label took its name     from a book he wrote with Felix Guattari). Mille Plateaux's <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> series, which first appeared in 2000, has been particularly successful in     this respect, essentially defining the aggregation of electronic music     created from material usually discarded as error, the now-ubiquitous     ""glitch.""</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on Force Tracks, an influential compilation from 2001 showed     another movement afoot. <i>Hypercity</i>, a label sampler selected and mixed     by Andrew Weatherall, offered a fascinating glimpse at what had been going on     in the world writer Phillip Sherburne termed ""microhouse."" Artists like     Luomo and MRI had incorporated some of the techniques of the clicks &amp; cuts     producers, such as a focus on sonic detritus and the amplification of the     typically microscopic details, and applied the tool set to functional,     danceable house music. Though microhouse, like most electronic genres,     has proven somewhat difficult to define, its profile has grown steadily (I     thought it was wildly overrated, but witness the many 2002 year-end lists     that included Akufen's <i>My Way</i>) and does not seem to have peaked.</p>
<p>Listening to the third installment of <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> and Force Tracks'     <i>Digital Disco</i>, two compilations released within a few weeks of each     other late last year, it sounds like a serious convergence is underway     beneath the Force Inc. Music Works tent, and it's happening much further     down the pop end of the spectrum. <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts 3</i> is by far the most     accessible and groove-oriented of the three collections so far (though it     should be said that this series has always had beat-friendly leanings), and     <i>Digital Disco</i>, true to its title, discards the conceptual baggage     entirely in favor of a relentlessly listenable dance party that, at points,     would be at home on <i>Billboard</i>'s Hot 100.</p>
<p>It's telling that several artists appear on both compilations, and the     selected tracks are both in line with the artist's styles. The venerable     Luomo, who has appeared on <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> compilations past under     his old IDM guise Vladislav Delay, offers ""Melt"" to <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts 3</i> and ""The Present Lover"" to <i>Digital Disco</i>.  Both tracks incorporate     his signature blend of warm synths, sensuous drum programming, and cut-up     vocals. ""Melt"" is a bit more jerky and less house than ""The Present Lover""     and contains heavier vocal processing, but both are pure Luomo. Berlin's     MRI gives the gothic electro ""Painkiller"" to <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> and kicks     off <i>Digital Disco</i> with the buoyant and clubby ""Disco Discovery"",     two more vocal tracks that let the experimental take a backseat to pop.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Digital Disco</i>, in fact, just about <i>everything</i> takes     a backseat to pop thrills. Virtually every track features vocals, and most     are delivered straight. This is the sound of the Force Inc. Music Works empire     dancing around a textbook-fueled bonfire. I can't say exactly what inspired     Sylk 130 to record a sleek, polished cover of Nu Shooz' 80s dance pop     classic ""I Can't Wait"", but it sure doesn't sound like a cultural critique.     Whatever the motive, it's bound to trigger nostalgia in every child of the     80s and send the throng down to the dance floor.</p>
<p>Even more sugary is Astrobal's ""Magic Lady (1040 Mix)"", which blends     squelchy electro sequencing, swooping strings and the best chorus hook I've     heard in some time into a slice of late disco heaven that conjures that     loving spirit of the Paradise Garage. Other highlights on <i>Digital Disco</i> include Metro Area's ""Miura"", which has been making the compilation rounds,     Swayzak's ""Husky Bitch"", which has a hypnotic low-end riff, and Herbert's     ""Stop Like This"" mix of Akufen's ""Deck the House"", which improves on the     original in my opinion by more skillfully manipulating the vocal samples     (although it does lose a touch in groove).</p>
<p>Next to the unabashedly joyful <i>Digital Disco</i> set, <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> seems a bit muddled. While it's true that this is the most accessible set in     the <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> series, many of the tracks seem to want to have their     theoretical cake and eat it, too. There's some weird no-man's land that drifts     into view here and there, where dance beats are given a half-hearted nod but     other conventions of pop music are avoided.

<p>I think snd typifies this dual approach, where the experimental meets the     pop and the balance seems a little off. Their ""Palo Alto"", which leads off     the compilation's first disc, is very much in line with their 2002 release     <i>Tender Love</i>, in that it isolates the two-step beat in an arid glitch     environment. Elsewhere, Robin Judge's ""Rhizome"" is like a microscopic version     of an R&amp;B; slow jam with some dub overtones, but doesn't particularly reward     careful listening. Frank Bretschneider's ""Risk"" incorporates some 70s funk     elements but pales in comparison to something like Soul Center, which it     closely resembles. Funny that the three best tracks with pronounced beats     come from <i>Digital Disco</i> contributors. In addition to the fine Luomo     and MRI tracks, Swayzak's ""Don't Quit Please"", is another good winner. This     housey number only has the bare minimum of sounds, basically a few clicks and     buzzes, including the essential killer bassline.</p>
<p>In the latter part of <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i>' second disc, Tim Hecker and     Ekkehard Ehlers represent for the old-school Mille Plateaux style, with     Hecker's ""Brownwedding"" wafting in from the same ominous plane as his     <i>Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again</i> and Ehlers' ""The Bakes in the Wood""     squeezes melody out of a series of seemingly random organ chords. Records     like the latest by these two and Random Inc.'s <i>Walking in Jerusalem</i> demonstrate that there is still a lot of life left in experimental glitch,     but you won't find much of interest in this vein on this <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> compilation. One senses that this third volume finds the series at a     crossroads and unsure where to go next, though personally, I expect we'll     hear plenty of fascinating music in Mille Plateaux's future.  And from the     evidence here, Force Tracks will continue to hum along on the strength of     that endless house beat.</p></div>"|1933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1933-clicks-cuts-3-and-digital-disco/|7.2|Mark Richardson

Music Works is without question one of the most important and     influential organizations in post-rave electronic music. This parent     company, founded in the early 90s in Frankfurt, has under its umbrella     labels including Force Tracks, Force Lab, Mille Plateaux and Ritornell.     A staggering amount of quality electronic music has been released under     these imprints, from the experimental and abstract to the danceable and     club-friendly. If one could magically slice away the music released under     the auspices of Force Inc., the current electronic music scene would be     impossible to recognize.</p>
<p>In line with European intellectual trends, Force Inc. has never shied away     from engagement on a theoretical level. Not content to merely document     happenings, Force Inc., particularly with Mille Plateaux, has consistently     sought to shape the discourse on electronic music directly, by collecting     and presenting compilations that seek to define cultural trends, and     offering accompanying booklets with manifestos dense with post-structuralist     theory, particularly the ideas of Gilles Deluze (the label took its name     from a book he wrote with Felix Guattari). Mille Plateaux's <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> series, which first appeared in 2000, has been particularly successful in     this respect, essentially defining the aggregation of electronic music     created from material usually discarded as error, the now-ubiquitous     ""glitch.""</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on Force Tracks, an influential compilation from 2001 showed     another movement afoot. <i>Hypercity</i>, a label sampler selected and mixed     by Andrew Weatherall, offered a fascinating glimpse at what had been going on     in the world writer Phillip Sherburne termed ""microhouse."" Artists like     Luomo and MRI had incorporated some of the techniques of the clicks &amp; cuts     producers, such as a focus on sonic detritus and the amplification of the     typically microscopic details, and applied the tool set to functional,     danceable house music. Though microhouse, like most electronic genres,     has proven somewhat difficult to define, its profile has grown steadily (I     thought it was wildly overrated, but witness the many 2002 year-end lists     that included Akufen's <i>My Way</i>) and does not seem to have peaked.</p>
<p>Listening to the third installment of <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> and Force Tracks'     <i>Digital Disco</i>, two compilations released within a few weeks of each     other late last year, it sounds like a serious convergence is underway     beneath the Force Inc. Music Works tent, and it's happening much further     down the pop end of the spectrum. <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts 3</i> is by far the most     accessible and groove-oriented of the three collections so far (though it     should be said that this series has always had beat-friendly leanings), and     <i>Digital Disco</i>, true to its title, discards the conceptual baggage     entirely in favor of a relentlessly listenable dance party that, at points,     would be at home on <i>Billboard</i>'s Hot 100.</p>
<p>It's telling that several artists appear on both compilations, and the     selected tracks are both in line with the artist's styles. The venerable     Luomo, who has appeared on <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> compilations past under     his old IDM guise Vladislav Delay, offers ""Melt"" to <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts 3</i> and ""The Present Lover"" to <i>Digital Disco</i>.  Both tracks incorporate     his signature blend of warm synths, sensuous drum programming, and cut-up     vocals. ""Melt"" is a bit more jerky and less house than ""The Present Lover""     and contains heavier vocal processing, but both are pure Luomo. Berlin's     MRI gives the gothic electro ""Painkiller"" to <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> and kicks     off <i>Digital Disco</i> with the buoyant and clubby ""Disco Discovery"",     two more vocal tracks that let the experimental take a backseat to pop.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Digital Disco</i>, in fact, just about <i>everything</i> takes     a backseat to pop thrills. Virtually every track features vocals, and most     are delivered straight. This is the sound of the Force Inc. Music Works empire     dancing around a textbook-fueled bonfire. I can't say exactly what inspired     Sylk 130 to record a sleek, polished cover of Nu Shooz' 80s dance pop     classic ""I Can't Wait"", but it sure doesn't sound like a cultural critique.     Whatever the motive, it's bound to trigger nostalgia in every child of the     80s and send the throng down to the dance floor.</p>
<p>Even more sugary is Astrobal's ""Magic Lady (1040 Mix)"", which blends     squelchy electro sequencing, swooping strings and the best chorus hook I've     heard in some time into a slice of late disco heaven that conjures that     loving spirit of the Paradise Garage. Other highlights on <i>Digital Disco</i> include Metro Area's ""Miura"", which has been making the compilation rounds,     Swayzak's ""Husky Bitch"", which has a hypnotic low-end riff, and Herbert's     ""Stop Like This"" mix of Akufen's ""Deck the House"", which improves on the     original in my opinion by more skillfully manipulating the vocal samples     (although it does lose a touch in groove).</p>
<p>Next to the unabashedly joyful <i>Digital Disco</i> set, <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> seems a bit muddled. While it's true that this is the most accessible set in     the <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i> series, many of the tracks seem to want to have their     theoretical cake and eat it, too. There's some weird no-man's land that drifts     into view here and there, where dance beats are given a half-hearted nod but     other conventions of pop music are avoided. One gets that sense that <i>Clicks     &amp; Cuts</i> sought to gather tracks that could be viewed in the experimental     Mille Plateaux tradition while hinting towards the world of song structure,     but the result is none too special.</p>
<p>I think snd typifies this dual approach, where the experimental meets the     pop and the balance seems a little off.

From the     moment Malcom McLaren first sat down at his drawing board to draft that     unstoppable cash cow, built to exploit the burgeoning disestablishmentarianism     of British youth, the working class sensibility of mid-70s British and New     York punks saw their image diluted by commercial interests until it was     no longer recognizable.  A mere 25 years later, the same insidious motives     fuel the corporate world: the safety pins, tattered jean jackets, and hatred     for the C of E embodied by punk poster boy Johnny Rotten have been replaced,     by soulless So-Cal frat boys with Hot Topic endorsement deals and multimillion     dollar recording studios.</p>
<p>As the former street punk scenes of early 80s London and New York rested in     a state of suspended animation, MTV and its minions subjugated not only the     once vibrant scene, but also its singular aesthetic.  Punk's innocence and     misfit angst has been supplanted by phony social consciousness and political     correctness; it's grown increasingly difficult to even remember-- much less     appreciate-- the Herculean efforts of the genre's founding fathers, like     Stiff Little Fingers, Buzzcocks, The Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Ramones.</p>
<p>Bringing a fiery wave of three-chord rock played at breakneck speed to an     audience dissatisfied with the excesses of glam rock, and recently numbed by     the lingering afterburn of disco, The Ramones stand alone as the first     legitimate punk rock band.  Shattering the conventions and stricture of     mainstream rock, The Ramones established the blueprint for minimalist     street-kid rock, long before style entered the picture.  To their credit,     The Ramones have carried the torch for the New York Punk movement ever     since its inception, remaining true to its rage and irrepressibility     for as long as any of us can remember.</p>
<p>Prior to the passing of both Joey and Dee Dee Ramone in the last two years,     the band was actively touring, and boasted numerous solo projects.     Unfortunately for The Ramones, maturity didn't yield adaptability, and     these late-fortysomethings were clinging steadfast to the same brand of     anti-culture twenty years after its initial impact.  As his recent     collaboration with punk revivalists The Speedkings illustrates, former     drummer Marky Ramone is no exception.  Hooking up with the latest project     of Nick Cooper, former leader of the Buckweeds, Marky Ramone handled     drumming duties on <i>Legends Bleed</i>, forty minutes' worth of     predictable schlock-punk whose disposability is surpassed only by its     irrelevance.</p>
<p>Despite bearing the moniker Marky Ramone &amp; The Speedkings, Ramone's     efforts on this album are relegated to percussion, with guitarist/vocalist     Cooper providing the songwriting and marginal creative impetus.  Ramone's     drumming is as solid and feverish as ever, displaying his talent for banging     out pinpoint hardcore and punk tempos without rest in all 16 of the album's     original tracks.  While there's certainly no dearth of verve present, this     album really boils down to the same tired party culture nonsense of     yesteryear, preaching an eternal love of fast cars, beer, apathy, and     promiscuous young girls.</p>
<p>""You're all I want, you're all I need/ You drive me crazy baby, I just can't     breathe/ Roll the dice, spin the wheel/ Buckle up, honey, I'll show you how     it feels.""  So goes the haplessly antiquated Motörhead of ""Hot Rods-R-Us"",     a song dealing with a young man's anthropomorphic relationship with his car.     When they're not addressing culturally irrelevant hot points like     carburetors and double clutches, The Speedkings explore mindless teenage     ire, on tracks like ""Fuck Shit Up"", ""I Don't Care Anymore"", and ""R'n'R     Asshole"", with puerile prose like, ""Oh my gawd, you really suck/ I'm gonna     tear you another asshole/ Always shit out of luck,"" and, ""Time has come for     some change/ Motherfuckin' scumfuck so deranged/ I don't give a shit what     you think of me/ Punch your lights out, then you'll see/ I don't give a     fuck, I do what I do.""</p>
<p>Tracks like ""Sex Phone Girls"", ""Weenie Hair"", and ""Beaver on my Mind"" are     so laden with obsolete male impulses and schoolyard puns, I'm virtually     positive the late Joey Ramone is cringing in his grave.  <i>Legends     Bleed</i> is a benign party record, plain and simple.  If you can get past     the tracklist, lyric sheet, and band members' birth certificates, you'll     have a blast.  Anyone in search of the perfect soundtrack for a DUI or     suffering from a Peter Pan complex will be delighted by this group of aging     hipsters still trying to milk a dead aesthetic for all it's worth.</p>
<p>Ironically, the gratuitous inclusion of four abysmal Ramones covers recorded     live in Germany are all songs Joey &amp; Co. recorded before Marky even joined     the band.  Undoubtedly, missing out on The Ramones' seminal work left Marky     struggling for his own niche, but his work with The Speedkings, and his     previous solo efforts (with The Intruders) echo his utter lack of interest     in relevance and taste.  For as much as punk rock as been bastardized and     assimilated by pop culture looking to prey upon angry kids with questionable     fashion sense, nonsensical parody like <i>Legends Bleed</i> keeps better,     modern day punk mired in prehistoric stereotypes propounded by men in their     early fifties.</p></div>"|6679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6679-legends-bleed-with-the-speedkings/|3.4|Isaiah Violante

    Jewish Carpenter wasn't the only virgin birth in history; unusually pure
    progeny that grow into full-blown saviors abound in every culture. Even
    stranger are the myths of those that emerge into the world fully formed,
    sans incubation, with neither childhood nor adolescence to tether them.
    In Greek mythology alone there's Athena, the splitting-headache of Zeus,
    bursting forth as an adult clad in armor, and Aphrodite, who was curvaceously
    at the age of consent when she surfed in on the half-shell.</p><p>
    Add to this list of babes the more Apollonian duo Boards of Canada, for
    their seemingly nascent cries and lullabies are mature as far back as the
    eyes and ears go, as evidenced on their seven year-old stone tablet,
    <i>Twoism</i>. Often considered the Holy Grail of IDM (and not too long
    ago trading for a cool grand on eBay), ownership of one of the original
    100 pressed-wax <i>Twoism</i> EPs guaranteed entrance into the upper
    echelon of electronica.  And now, Warp Records have brought it back for
    all the proles, even though it feels more like a forced disinterring
    brought on by cultists, demanding some of that old-time religion whether
    or not the idols are ready with new scripture.</p><p>
    The numerology that's brought the glow-stick generation to dig on the Golden
    Ratio-- to pay attention in Geometry class-- is here.  So is the Mutual of
    Omaha's Wild Kingdom keyboard, which checks in on ""Sixtyniner"". Falling
    somewhere before ""Sixtyten"" or ""1969"", and after ""Infinite Lines of Colorful
    Sevens"" (from the cassette-only <i>Play by Numbers</i>), it can only further
    confuse fans trying to decode their apocalyptic sequences.  The prescient,
    beanie-nodding beats are present, too, hammering home a surprisingly sweet
    subliminal message about that infinite moment, the kiss.</p><p>
    The Boards' cassette-only sonic limitations are the most telltale sign of the
    times that produced <i>Twoism</i>. While ""Directine"" showcases the particular
    sense of disembodiment the duo induces, with synths floating and kicks to
    give it that sense of propulsion, the individual, isolated hits are
    distorted and fuzzy, muddying the overall effect. The formulaic gurgling on
    ""Iced Cooly"" is largely forgettable, evoking Gerber's mashed peas more than
    the childlike phantoms that arise elsewhere in their discography.</p><p>
    As convoluted as Autechre were at the time, ""Basefree"" stands as one of the
    most rhythmically complex Boards tracks, with a surging bass throb that
    pushes and stutters through a far-off siren as slurred roars escape like
    gas from the pounding pistons. It has an intense hyper-beat that was
    scarcely touched on in <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>, and which
    made only a slight return on <i>Geodaddi</i>'s ""Gyroscope"". But once again,
    the compounds seem to mush all the frequencies together, and the details,
    so crisp in the near-future, are hazy.  The title track is blurred, as well,
    taking the edge off both the strange ecstasy of the vocals and the melancholy
    of the hovering monosynth.</p><p>
    As zealots attempt to piece back together the dead sea scrolls <i>Maxima</i>,
    <i>Acid Memories</i> and <i>Hooper Bay</i>, so, too, have Marcus Eoin and
    Michael Sandison reconfigured their own past to bestow more cohesive
    statements to the present. As <i>Maxima</i> dispersed three tracks each to
    <i>Hi Scores</i> and <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>, a similar
    recycling occurs here: ""Seeya Later"" appeared a year later on <i>Hi Scores</i>,
    and the closer here, ""Smokes Quantity"", also closed out <i>Music Has the
    Right to Children</i>.</p><p>
    Déjà vu is not necessarily a bad thing, and <i>Twoism</i> contains signs of
    refinement beyond its place as Stonehenge simplicity to underscore the Paul
    Lafoley complexity Boards reached by the time of <i>Geogaddi</i>.  For those
    that contend the latter didn't travel far beyond the elysian fields of their
    major label emergence, <i>Twoism</i> will spur further critique, as in a sense,
    these thirty-six minutes show that the duo has basically been stuck in
    neutral since 1995.  As our own Mark Richardson put it, ""If you'd perfected
    a sonic playground like this, you'd probably want to explore it a while
    longer, too,"" but perhaps at their age, Boards of Canada shouldn't be hanging
    around playgrounds.</p></div>"|833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/833-twoism/|7.0|Andy Beta

    Every year, this guy's name comes on the spine of three to seven albums,
    not to mention being buried in the credits of probably a dozen more.  His
    brilliance isn't really up for debate-- the sheer consistency of his
    releases guarantees that-- but after a while, consistency can get a bit
    numbing.  Laswell is excellent at what he does, but truly definitive
    statements, like the amazing <i>Invisible Design</i>, are rare in his
    catalogue; his best work is spread out over too many discs to count,
    instead of being concentrated in one place.</p><p>
    
    This is where Laswell's latest project, the preposterously named <i>Sacred
    System: Book of Exit; Dub Chamber 4</i>, comes in.  Over the years, Laswell
    has released a veritable pantsload of dub-themed releases, and this new one
    follows in the much the same vein: deep bass, slow tempos, cavernous echo,
    and a nebulous sense of composition.  As dub releases goes, it's fairly
    minimal; while there aren't piles of freaky samples-- in fact, there's really
    no clutter at all to speak of-- it's nothing Laswell hasn't explored many
    times before.</p><p>
    
    The album's six tracks are split evenly between Laswell-composed tests of a
    dub autopilot machine he's apparently been working on, and three songs he
    wrote with Ethiopian singer Ejigayehu ""GiGi"" Shibabaw.  While Laswell's
    chilled-out dub instrumentals aren't bad by any means, they don't hold a
    candle to the vocal tracks; I'm not sure what language GiGi is singing in
    when she leaves English behind (Ethiopia has six major languages-- the
    principle being Amharic-- and several more minor ones), but in the context
    of the music, it's beside the point, as her mellifluous delivery is
    ultimately what cuts through the dubby haze.</p><p>
    
    Beyond GiGi herself, there's a certain drive to the three tracks she sings
    on that seems missing from the others.  Percussionists Karsh Kale and Aiyb
    Dieng are consummate craftsmen, but on the dub tracks they're limited to a
    small window, making it difficult for them to break things up with the
    virtuosity they're known for.  They're given a freer hand on the vocal
    tunes, though, which invariably results in a much more palpable sense of
    urgency and fire.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, it's most interesting to think of what could come of a
    full-scale collaboration between GiGi and Laswell: as it stands, half of
    this album is electrifying, the other merely passable.  Under usual
    circumstances I might recommend this, but if you don't already own Laswell's
    essential releases like <i>Psychonavigation</i>, <i>Invisible Design</i>,
    or the various and excellent records by his other projects Praxis, Tabla
    Beat Science, Material, and Massacre, <i>Sacred System</i> can easily wait.
    If you're reasonably well versed in Bill's oeuvre, proceed as you wish,
    but know what to expect: Laswell dub by-the-numbers.</p></div>"|4697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4697-sacred-system-book-of-exit-dub-chamber-4/|6.8|Joe Tangari

    the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, but all I could come up with was this little haiku:</p><p>
    
    Nothing like first disc<br/>
    Awful sound offends the ear<br/>
    Seven crap minutes</p><p>
    
    Allow me, for a moment, to speak candidly about economics, from one consumer to another.  Seven minutes
    is not a lot of music, and the suggested retail price of this EP, with tax, is about seven dollars.  I
    can brush my teeth for more than seven minutes, and I don't even get paid for that.  Granted, a price tag
    may be no reason to pan a disc-- especially with technology being what it is nowadays-- but it's sure as
    hell a reason not to buy one, and so I caution you, gentle readers, pay not for this album.  From an
    economics perspective, it's trash.</p><p>
    
    But before you YYY's fans put on your letter-writing hats and cry, ""Capitalism made me do it!"", know this:
    <i>Machine</i> disappoints on an almost unprecedented number of levels, and its unfortunate length is the
    least of its problems.  On <i>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</i>, Karen O and her bad boys from Brooklyn combined just a
    guitar, drums, and a few teasy-sleazy pouts to create a sprawling, stomping, hook-spewing monster.  It
    was a mixed bag overall, but one that yielded a few kernels of decency and left many, myself included,
    anxious for more.</p><p>
    
    As a follow-up, however, <i>Machine</i> seems designed to wrong all rights; there's
    barely a whiff of the old swagger, Nick Zinner's once-massive guitar hooks are nearly inaudible, and
    ""Art Star"" alone has more songwriting creativity in its middle finger than all of these tracks put together.
    In fact, when you take into account the abysmal production, overexposed vocals, and everything else that
    takes this EP one giant step backward from the promise of this band's debut, it's for the best that it
    ends quickly.</p><p>
    
    Between Zinner and convicted drum abuser Brian Chase lies a potential guitar/rhythm interplay mighty enough
    to take on Godzilla, pay off the national debt, and cure a little cancer, all at once.  The proof of this
    lies in the YYY's soul-demolishing live assault, which, to a certain extent, was reproduced on the debut;
    <i>Machine</i>'s production buries them squarely at the bottom of the Grand Fucking Canyon.  Aside from the
    crack-like, nu-surf refrain showcased on the opener and some stellar percussion on ""Graveyard"", these two
    are almost nowhere to be found.  Under no circumstances should a sound so colossal have to struggle to be
    heard.  And it might not even be so difficult to pluck them out of the mix were Karen O not apparently
    singing through a megaphone for most of the EP.</p><p>
    
    To its credit, the title track manages to miraculously downplay these baffling production decisions,
    salvaging what little is left of this EP's silver lining, but that's the best I can say about it.  A
    racing drone explodes into a chorus that speaks oddly of longing and malaise, and then picks up the
    pieces and starts again with redoubled effort.  The pattern repeats as necessary.  ""Machine"" (as in ""sex
    machine""-- wink wink, nudge nudge) is a slightly obtuse swipe at some of the YYY's forced sexual tension,
    but at least it's decent fun.  The secret shame, however, is that it sounds a little predictable from them
    at this point, and when your band hasn't even released ten songs, that's cause for concern.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, neither of the other two cuts even fares that well.  ""Graveyard"" sounds as messy and
    incomplete as a two-minute garage improv on broken instruments, minus any sort of spontaneity or real
    energy, and Karen O's voice is soaked with enough piercing reverb to lance white-hot needles of pain
    through your cochlea.  And then, as quickly as it began, the disc closes out with ""Pin (Remix)"", a track
    which has the distinction of being the most interesting YYY's song I've heard yet-- and not in a good way.
    The spacy, almost hypnotic drive of this song, which has been a live staple for a while now (obviously in
    unremixed form) is here reduced to little more than a low-volume hum-- so low as to be almost totally
    inaudible compared to the rest of the album.  If everything didn't end up echoing into a single, gooey
    mass, it might work as a drone experiment, but it still proves to be obvious filler.</p><p>
    
    The YYY's have the essential elements of a fine rock outfit lying around their apartment, somewhere, but
    those elements are clearly not seeing much use lately, if this EP is any indication.  Its anemic attempts
    at bluster wouldn't last ten seconds against anything off the debut.  What I'm saying is, there are
    limitless ways to blow seven dollars, but none could be more wasteful than buying this EP.  It's a fucking
    joke.</p></div>"|8887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8887-machine-ep/|3.9|Eric Carr

    needed to construct music.  In the Western World, you'd have to go back a ways to outrun this holy trinity,
    and even then-- when Chant and minstrels were all the rage-- it was only harmony that lacked the sophistication
    to warrant equal billing on the musical marquee.  Several centuries later, the tables appear to have tilted
    slightly, as melody and rhythm conspire to overthrow harmony.  Some might say we're experiencing a musical
    revolution.</p><p>
    And we are, sort of.  Truthfully, the marriage of rhythm and melody is an illusion: every melody features
    rhythm anyway, and always has.  In the last 50 years or so, however, music with those ""crazy"" rhythms has
    been wreaking havoc on our youth in a way no motet or chanson ever did.  I could even show all my cards
    here, and just jump into hip-hop, where melody and rhythm have been in cahoots so long that, from a distance,
    it's hard to tell which is even running the show.  It's not that either one of these elements is more
    dominant than the other, but that in the age of beats, riffs and rhymes, it's often unclear what role a
    particular element is playing.</p><p>
    Confused? Asa-Chang (originally Koichi Asakura) &amp; Junray (Japanese for ""pilgrimage"") cut my muddy thesis
    to the chase: their ""Hana"" features a clear, hopelessly melancholy string arrangement-- very much like what
    Björk should have been opting for over Hollywood orchestras-- but the most distinctive part of the song is
    its drastically straightforward marriage of melody and rhythm.  Asa-Chang's Indonesian bongo (which sounds
    remarkably like an Indian tabla) plays in unison to a male/female duet, effectively destroying any expectation
    for ""groove"", yet forming what would be an off-kilter ballad into a futuristic, exotic percussion piece, thanks
    especially to the band's secret weapons: soft, ascending sine tones.  Although technically speaking, all the
    old building blocks are intact, the harmony is in tune with nothing, the melody has no notes, and the rhythm
    is present in name only, happy to exist as a melody-by-proxy.</p><p>
    Asa-Chang &amp; Junray have been performing since 1998, and <i>Jun Ray Song Chang</i> is their first release
    outside of Japan.  It's a compilation of their first two Japanese releases, and is fortunately interesting
    on more than just technical grounds.  The sounds here are unexpectedly diverse (with a band featuring only
    two percussionists and a programmer, that's a major feat), especially given that each song appears to have
    been an exercise in making due with only the barest necessities.  As mentioned, the melodies tend to be
    married to the percussion, and while the ""Junreitronics"" (their very own processing device) apply a small
    amount of electronic fuckery to the mix, most of this stuff sounds like a natural hybrid of exotic percussion
    and faux-trad jungle folk, by way of Jakarta, India and Japan.  Their sound isn't easily pigeonholed.</p><p>
    Junray makes use of member U-Zhaan's Calcutta tabla studies on ""Nigatsu"", as again, melody and rhythm are
    mirror images of each other.  The opening song-speak soliloquy by Asa-Chang is actually accompanied by a distant
    rainstorm, and the simple, looped guitar figure acts more as a rhythmic base than as a harmonic center.  Asa-Chang
    runs through several variations on a single rhythm, and when the tabla enters, the entire piece is
    transformed into a treatise on the roles of rhythm in modern popular music.  Yet, in a way, like much
    of the music on this CD, the arrangements are so sparse that it seems barely there at all.  ""Kutsu #2""
    features only a light electronic tapping and simple clarinet duo over its one-minute duration, while the
    comparatively epic ""Jippun"" offers little more to flesh out its subliminally addictive strains.  This song
    cuts flute lines, rising sine waves, jumpy synth beeps and rapid-fire tabla to simulate a minimalist,
    thoroughly modern raga.</p><p>
    But Asa-Chang &amp; Junray's way of casting ancient instruments in new lights is probably the coolest thing about their
    music.  Where something like ""Jippun"" or the Chinese festival music of ""Goo-Gung-Gung"" (apparently, titles
    get the same minimal treatment) might sound academic-- or worse, smugly conservative-- coming from some
    Society of Indigenous Music Preservation, here they sound as vital as any modern electronic music, and in
    many cases, more so.  Some of this is indeed due to the way they play with the basic elements in their
    music, though ultimately, rhythm is at the heart of everything on the album. Beyond theoretical questions,
    <i>Jun Ray Song Chang</i> poses more pressing ones: if creating new electronic music can sound this fun,
    why doesn't everyone do it?</p></div>"|307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/307-jun-ray-song-chang/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    Peddling a similar popcorn ball of early 80s new-wave influences, a similar haircut-impaired fashion
    statement, and a similar tendency to trip into over-overt Strokes aping, Koufax have every right to wonder
    why HHH is getting all the press while they've remained rather low-profile.  Perhaps it's a conspiracy of
    label prejudice-- after all, <i>Social Life</i> sports the Vagrant rectangle, which likely throws it
    directly to the bottom of most critics' review stacks.</p><p>
    
    To do so, however, would be a disservice, and this is a diehard Vagrant basher on a steadfastly
    Vagrant-harassing site talking here.  It's clear right off that Koufax aspires to much more than the
    woe-folk and punk-by-numbers of the rest of the label's ranks, setting their sights instead on
    keyboard-centric pop with just a touch of snarl and orchestral ambition.  There's still a healthy helping
    of self-pity in the transcript, but toned down and set atop an agreeably lush backdrop, it's not so grating.</p><p>
    
    And from the opening two shots, ""Let Us Know"" and ""Break It Off"", Koufax seem to have all the right
    ingredients in place: crisp songwriting, charismatic swagger vocals, punchy rhythm, horn-embellished riffs.
    Nobody's gonna hand them any originality awards, but the quartet is confident enough to list their most
    obvious heroes right on the cover-- I'd already called Joe Jackson and Elvis Costello before squinting
    through the fine print; I'm still mystified by Eddie Money (does he have some indie-hip period pre- or
    post-""Two Tickets to Paradise?"").</p><p>
    
    If Koufax is consistently coming out behind Hot Hot Heat on final scorecards, however, it's due to poor
    showings in the categories of energy and consistency.  Singer Robert Suchan might have the same Dexy's
    timbre down, but he fails to let his voice fly completely off the hinges like consensus-splitter Steve
    Bays.  Following suit, the band's arrangements tend to sound considerably more polite than those of their
    peers, perhaps due to the piano focus on the majority, or perhaps resulting from a too-strict adherence
    to their forefathers' work (band members in ties on cover = bad sign).  Witness the synthy beginnings to
    songs like ""So Put On"", promising some serious arm-flail action, but settling all too quickly into a
    mellow, wineglass-in-hand strut.</p><p>
    
    Koufax also can't quite keep up to the standards set by the album's first eight minutes, with the material
    taking a distinct southward turn somewhere around the Glenn Frey saxophone squawk of the title track (or
    maybe that's where the Eddie Money lovin' comes into play).  This unfortunate 80s relic, as well as the
    pointless marching-band coda to ""So Long to Good Times"", is a sign that Koufax doesn't always quite have
    the grasp on when to throw in supra-band orchestration, too often using horns and strings as crutches to
    hide limp melodies.</p><p>
    
    Then there's ""Saturday Alone"", with a mistaken vocal turn by croaking drummer Dave Shettler, or ""Simply
    Passing Time"", a quirky theme marred by some of the most uncomfortable sex lyrics I've heard in my critical
    career.  The group pulls together for a few more standouts in the back end-- ""Bright Side"" and ""Younger
    Body"" are pleasant candy-shelf pop (though the latter is shameless Stroking) and ""Adultery"" brings to mind
    the unfairly neglected pre-Pornographers Zumpano.  Too bad it's not quite enough to separate them from the
    80s-mining pack, or to earn more than a condescending ""ya got potential, kids"" pat on the back from Rob
    Mitchum: Maker/Breaker of Careers, but it's probably enough for me to risk keeping a spine emblazoned with
    the Vagrant logo amongst my other CDs.</p></div>"|4521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4521-social-life/|7.2|Rob Mitchum

    the lyrical force GZA unleashed on that album sucked the listener through a
    black hole beneath the subways of NYC into a grimy hip-hop Twilight Zone
    inhabited by Shaolin monks, microphone magicians, and linguistic architects.
    While GZA was busy creating mystical spheres with his rhymes, RZA laid down
    his most stark, violent production to date, and the collision of these two
    elements laid the hip-hop world on its back, feeling like we'd been camp-fucked
    by a gang of freestyle samurais.  Although the power of that record was enough
    to damper the lukewarm reception of his hit-or-miss follow-up, <i>Beneath the
    Surface</i> (think of it as his <i>Jackie Brown</i>), heads had few doubts that
    GZA was one of the most creative MCs in the game.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Legend of the Liquid Swords</i>, RZA's warped, claustrophobic production
    is supplemented with a more rounded, organic sound, not unlike Jay's original
    <i>Blueprint</i>.  And while GZA still builds seedy narratives with slang
    spills and a crunchy flow, he too seems to have peered out of hip-hop's
    esoteric dungeon for a clarifying breath of fresh air. The result is a record
    less mysterious and mercurial, a more personal and direct statement.  GZA--
    now well into his mid-30s and the oldest member of the Wu Clan-- seems more
    intent on explaining the Wu mythology than he once was in creating it; this
    mindset is evident on the record cover, on which he hunches over his 11
    year-old son, deeply immersed in the large Wu tome.  The kid even appears
    on the album's first track, a brief intro to ""Auto Bio.""</p><p>
    
    In the first verse of ""Auto Bio"", GZA recreates the early days of the Wu,
    where he and cousin RZA traveled from Staten Island (aka The Shaolin Land)
    to the Bronx, and witnessed the birth of hip-hop.  Family and Wu loyalty
    are still central in GZA's thematic palette, and although RZA only produces
    one track (the pimp-strut-inspiring ""Rough Cuts""), he lends his illustrious
    vocal styling to the excellent ""Fam (Members Only)"", declaring, ""If you
    think you can fuck with the Wu Clan, get ya nose swollen' up like Toucan
    [pause] Sam, and we don't give a damn.""  Elsewhere, the always-sublime
    Ghostface drops by for ""Silent"", and Inspectah Deck trades licks with GZA
    on ""Sparring Minds"". Clearly, GZA has not betrayed his Wu allegiance, and
    the tight-nit, us-vs-them vibe adds a romantic immediacy to <i>Legend of
    the Liquid Swords</i>.</p><p>
    
    GZA still has a passion for wordplay.  He twists his line breaks, inserts
    internal rhymes, pops off harrowing imagery, and displays more control of
    language than an entire army of cloned John Ashberrys.  On the brilliant
    ""Animal Kingdom"", he engages in a bit of anthropomorphism, drawing parallels
    between the laws of the jungle and the code of the streets.  The beat is
    sweaty and slow, as GZA creates an overgrown ghetto where a rat squeals, a
    zebra ""comorflouges his bets"", and ""the scorpion sets up a sting for sly
    foxes"".  He also reprises Grandmaster Flash's classic line, ""It's like a
    jungle sometimes,"" and though it's easily the most predictable move on the
    album, it also <i>works</i>.</p><p>
    
    The previously circulated ""Fame"" is in much the same vein as ""Animal
    Kingdom"", as GZA distorts celebrities' names in order to further his
    narrative. ""Dempsey Russeled him down, got his jaw wide/ In an instant,
    Brooke Shields him from the gunfire.""  And on ""Fame"", the English
    language is just GZA's bitch, yielding to his iron will.</p><p>
<i>Legend of the Liquid Swords</i> may lack some of the furious brutality of
    its '95 progenitor, but that's due mainly to its adequate, rarely astounding
    production.  GZA lyrical skills, however, have hardly diminished: if anything
    he's picked up steam and served us one of the best hip-hop albums in recent
    memory. In 2002, the game was still with the Wu.</p></div>"|3619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3619-legend-of-the-liquid-sword/|8.3|Sam Chennault

    first couple words can fall like the year's first drops of rain.  The trio From Quagmire, classified as a
    ""chamber"" ensemble, play a kind of Appalachian Zen that sits in a void: the familiar sounds of the violin
    and nylon-stringed guitar are cast in an charged atmosphere, and they tolerate so much silence that each
    sound bears significance.  It's not unlike last year's album by Nina Nastasia in its down-home-tinged
    creepiness, but <i>Caught in Unknowing</i> is more introspective, more improvisational, and even sparer;
    the cross between Geller's restrained playing and her bandmates' noisy wanderings makes this a fascinating
    listen.</p><p>
    
    Geller wrote and sings the songs, and it's her methodically plucked acoustic guitar that plays the frail
    backbones of the melodies: every theme is simple and deliberate, and there are echoes of Bill Frisell's
    <i>Where in the World?</i>  Admittedly, her playing occasionally gets monotonous, but at best her themes
    are hushed and portentous.  She only uses a handful of lyrics, singing them in a voice that's so small and
    quiet, yet the exceptional recording and spaciousness of the music allow you to train on it.</p><p>
    
    But these songs are just a guidepost for the other two members of From Quagmire, who provide exotic
    improvisation around the melodies.  James Wolf plays violin (along with Geller, he was a member of
    Laconic Chamber), and the third member, percussionist and this session's engineer Vincent Van Go-Gogh
    hails from the Washington, DC ""freakazoid ensemble"" Rake.</p><p>
    
    Van Go-Gogh and Wolf both veer from quiet to sonic extremes, but always at an unchanging, drawn-out pace,
    sustaining each high pitch to suggest the feeling they're rubbing their hearts against a knife.  The opener,
    ""Viennese II"", sets the stage effectively for both musicians' ""solos"": Wolf's violin has a country-gone-wrong
    twinge to its sawing, then erupts in buzzing lines and piercing skitters; Van Go-Gogh can attack his drums
    with a dry, rapid thud, like wings beating wood, but at other times he slows down with rumbles, a gong, or
    what sound like bowed cymbals. These solo pieces color the subtle mood swings that differentiate the songs;
    for example, the twelve-minute ""Victims and Second Viennese"" plays the most with the dynamics: the central
    bridge tightens intensely, and Geller's guitar gets a little more emphatic.  A little.</p><p>
    
    Geller's writing may shape the band, but it's Wolf's and Van Go-Gogh's unfailing inventiveness that make
    this so engaging, with none of the plodding repetition that's too common in similar chamber bands.  Instead
    of an easy flow, it's uneasily static.  From Quagmire's wandering drops away during the closer, ""Stalemate"",
    and though they sound like they're back where they started, within this space they've dug up a wealth of
    detail.</p></div>"|3217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3217-caught-in-unknowing/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

Like the digital readout from Windows Hypemaster 7.0, The
    Raveonettes come to the land of the free not only as Scandinavians (they're from Denmark, which I'm <i>pretty</i>
    sure is part of Scandinavia), but as a male/female duo with an ambiguous relationship.  I hear they play
    that rock music that ""Good Morning America"" told me is back!  The record industry's PR drones were speaking
    in tongues when this little package landed in their stereo.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, I'm sure The Raveonettes aren't a calculated amalgamation of all the currently profitable
    garage-rock storylines, though if they were to reveal that they're actually from Denmark, Nebraska, I
    wouldn't be too shocked.  Authenticity or no, the fact remains that Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo are
    practically the embodiment of <i>SPIN</i>'s ""Return of the Rock"" issue, right down to their loose, trashy
    sound, detached vocals, and penchant for paint-by-numbers garage-rock titles like ""Beat City"" and ""Cops on
    Our Tail"".</p><p>
<i>Whip It On!</i> follows the in-vogue S.O.P. for buzz generation, a quick shot of eight songs over a brisk
    twenty-one minutes, infuriating space-minded burner jockeys everywhere.  Wagner's guitar provides buzz of a
    different kind, kicking up a clanging racket to fill in all the empty spaces left by this two-piece. Like
    the overdrive-filled tantrums of, say, Yo La Tengo's Ira Kaplan, Wagner can play pretty much any simple,
    surf-inflected riff and make it sound like a choir loft of TVs tuned to static.  It's the kind of guitar
    sound that obviously took a long time to master; certainly a lot more time than The Raveonettes appear to
    have spent on their songs. Here's a play-by-play window into my listening:</p><p>
    
    Tracks 1-3: ""Okay, noisy garage with creepy boy/girl unison vocals, fair enough.""</p><p>
    
    Track 4: ""Did I sit on the 'Repeat 1' button by accident?""</p><p>
    
    Tracks 5-8: ""Are these slight tempo changes supposed to keep me from realizing this is still the same damn
    song?""</p><p>
    
    Not even an eight-song mini-album can hide that The Raveonettes are no Bruce Hornsby when it comes to playing
    with range.  ""Attack of the Ghost Riders"" has all the crunch and hard rhythm one would expect from a comic
    book title, and when Wagner utters ""it goes something like this"" and coaxes out a one-chord maelstrom--
    notice I'm keeping it Scandinavian-real here-- it sounds like the band's really got their finger on the
    pulse of the G-word.  ""Veronica Fever"" and ""Do You Believe Her"" keep hype hope alive, the former a quieter
    kind of fuzzed-out, early-90s drone, the latter a monster truck blowtorch with the unavoidable Man or
    Astroman? surf-beat stomp (surprisingly, supplied by a drum machine).</p><p>
    
    From there, the enjoyment curve takes a steep turn downwards, starting with ""Cops on Our Tail"", which sounds
    <i>exactly</i> like ""Do You Believe Her"" played at half-speed.  The rest of the album follows suit, beset by
    the Xeroxed nature of Wagner and Foo's not-quite-harmonious vocals; their sleepy singing sounds like it's
    hiding behind the amps.  One starts to wonder if all the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain comparisons flying around The
    Raveonettes aren't due to their J&amp;MC-like; tendency to write the same song over and over again, as well as
    their ability to kick up a right good wall of white noise.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's my weak spot for Scandinavians, but I'm not ready to start praying for the humiliating failure of
    The Raveonettes.  It's more than possible that <i>Whip It On!</i> is just a glorified promo-mix to start an
    NYC feeding frenzy, but if so, that's a goal it accomplished admirably (eh, Mr. Fricke?).  While their
    limitations seem to preclude the chances of next year's promised full-length being much of a Powerball
    jackpot, interviews indicate their hearts are in the right place, promising a 60s girl-group influence that
    doesn't quite rise to the top on this octet of tunes. It's certainly going take a lot to shake the cynicism
    their back-story currently provokes; we'll have to wait and see if these Danes are up to the challenge.</p></div>"|6697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6697-whip-it-on/|5.8|Rob Mitchum

    Anyone able to get past Mantler's odd sobriquet and play <i>Sadisfaction</i>, however, will learn anew that
    the skills for making good music and thinking up good names are stored in separate compartments of the human
    mind. Mantler (who, in real life, is just one guy, Chris Cummings) shows himself to be a deft musician, one
    who handles ProTools like most people handle buttering their muffins. Throughout <i>Sadisfaction</i>, he
    displays his easy mastery of electronic fireworks, and while that surely elicits nerdish appreciation from
    fellow laptop jockeys, what really impresses about Cummings is his sophisticated, coherent approach to
    composition.</p><p>
    
    By juxtaposing opposing elements-- such as his defiantly tinny drum machine with some
    ultra-naturalistic cool jazz trumpet in ""Hoped-For Chance"", or the alternating lush and stark moments in
    ""You Were Free""-- Cummings develops a fascinating tension that keeps the record inflated.  And since he only
    explores a small range of moods with despair on one extreme and resignation on the other, he gets some
    needed mileage out of this ambiguity.</p><p>
    
    Subtle variations, though, will only go so far, and <i>Sadisfaction</i> proves that they don't go far enough.
    The album's unrelieved gloom may work well as a soundtrack to self-pity, but as an artistic statement, its
    impact is decidedly limited. As Beck recently reminded the world, nonstop sad records can still be redeeming
    and ultimately life-affirming listens, but <i>Sadisfaction</i> gradually slips off from the precarious perch
    of saturnine sensitivity into the oppressive pit of solipsism. Cummings is an excellent songwriter with a
    finely honed sense of when to introduce new material, but listening to this very solid chunk of his work in
    one sitting is far more grueling than it should be.</p><p>
    
    The set of songs contained here may be a perfectly
    accurate representation of Cummings' inner life, and some would certainly defend such work on the basis of
    authenticity, but even if authenticity in art were not a meretricious obsession best relegated to far lower
    levels of concern, it's difficult to feel much sympathy for someone who spends forty minutes thoroughly
    exhausting the possibilities for expressing a brand of angst that most people have no use for after high
    school. If Cummings is using his personal minutiae as the sole source for his art (a likely situation, by
    the sound of it), then the best we can hope for in the future is that he simply cheers up.</p></div>"|5093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5093-sadisfaction/|6.7|Brian James

""Here, try some of this genetically modified beef-- it's a little project of mine.""  Alarms.  ""Hey!  You     haven't met my new wife yet?  She's downstairs... it's sort of a project I've been working on.""  And the     word seldom bodes well for music: Alan Parsons Project, anyone?  So I was naturally taken aback at finding     the self-described part-time ""pop project"" of Couch keyboardist Stefanie Bohm and Notwist bassist Micha     Acher to be better than most bands' ""full-time"" work; <i>No P. or D.</i> greeted me with serene vocals,     rich, deep melodies, and nary an alarm in earshot.</p>
<p>The aim here is deceptively simple: a blessed union of the classic and the modern gives birth to blissful     pop.  Glitches and clicks lie beneath calmly plucked strings, while a lone piano quietly navigates a sea     of hisses and hums; the organic and inorganic pieces flow together in crests and troughs, but the whole is     never less than seamless.  The concept is nothing new-- The Notwist, Lali Puna, and Dntel have also worked     wonders with this dynamic-- but comparisons only obfuscate the purpose of <i>No P. or D.</i>.  This project     is no experiment; it's a fantastically accessible pop outing flaunting IDM lingerie.</p>
<p>The joy and deception of this album lies beneath a mild, melodic veneer.  Like most great pop works, <i>No     P. or D.</i> can be enjoyed with as much or as little of the brain as desired.  The thought-averse among     you will be lulled into glorious insulin shock, allowing the girls' crisp, phonetic vocals and soothing     tones to cascade and break over you, but the intricacy lying in wait cannot be ignored.  The detail and     subtlety slowly, inexorably worms its way into the mind, no matter how passively the album is approached.     To dissect these melodies is not a complicated procedure, but neither is it a quick one, as each song     builds slowly and deliberately, layering elements atop one another, and leisurely anti-climaxing before     pausing to restructure again and again.</p>
<p>Even as the pacing of the album varies across fairly vast emotional terrain, <i>No P. or D.</i> develops as     though it had all the time in the world.  There's a practiced, almost Taoist ease throughout-- depth without     being Deep, simplicity without being Simple-- and it's hard not to walk away from the album without a sense     of well-being.  By way of example, ""Solid Ground"" is effortlessly grand: a slight piano refrain and angelic     vocals leave no mystery as to the song's sentiment.  Its heart is on its sleeve, but such immediate     accessibility doesn't begin to foretell the comparative depth of the multi-layered beep sequences floating     underneath.  It's not by any means an intellectual overload, but again, it offers itself up to any attentive     listener like a gift.  Incredibly, though, ""Solid Ground"" is merely first among equals.  Every track on     <i>No P. or D.</i> reveals itself with breathtaking assuredness.  For one song to be so striking is worthy     of acclaim; that the majority of the album can be similarly described is a testament to its wonder in no     uncertain terms.</p></div>"|5485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5485-no-p-or-d/|8.8|Eric Carr

    We mortals are rarely privy to these precious, private moments, though
    there's a good case for that.  Ideally, we never have to make due with demo
    recordings because our favorite artists release the stuff in genuine,
    full-grown versions.  Sometimes when those people die (or go crazy, or
    possibly hire Phil Spector to clean up their mix even though they know
    full well nobody is going to be able to do anything with the syrup like
    ""The Long and Winding Road""), record labels and estates get together to
    bring us What Might Have Been.  Peaking a glimpse at the fake future can
    be very empowering, but is ultimately a bittersweet experience at best.</p><p>
    
    XTC figurehead Andy Partridge fits somewhere in the middle of the
    dead/crazy/lazy triangle.  He's still alive, so I guess that puts him
    closer to the hallowed crazy/lazy paradox brought to you by the Kevin
    Shields Center for Non-Performing Arts.  Yet, Partridge is hardly that
    reclusive: <i>Fuzzy Warbles</i> is a project largely the result of XTC's
    strike against Virgin Records.  He'd written so many tunes during XTC's
    downtime that the band simply couldn't fit (or even rehearse) all of
    them for official release.  The first two volumes of his demo series
    contain unfinished songs from throughout XTC's career, and what a silo
    of mixed four-track treasure they are.</p><p>
    
    As a caveat, I should mention that these will probably only appeal to the
    society of underground Anglophiles known as XTC fans.  In a just world,
    Partridge's remarkable ability to form a tune might be more widely lauded,
    but as it stands, a collection of his demos fits most snugly in a niche
    market.  In fact, XTC bassist Colin Moulding felt the project too risky
    to invest his time and money.  Hence, we have (yet again) Partridge going
    against all commercial and political odds to bring his unborn children
    into the world.  Luckily for him (and us), he generally outsmarts his own
    passive-aggressive exhibitionist tendencies via sheer songcraft.</p><p>
    
    In typical Partridge fashion, the best stuff on these CDs is the most
    frustrating-- mostly due to the question of how XTC managed not to include so
    many great songs on their records over time.  The forgotten A-list includes
    the spectacular ""Wonder Annual"" (sentimental in the best possible way, and
    even Partridge laments this one never being released), ""Ship Trapped in the
    Ice"" (a virtual one-man rewrite of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i>), ""Everything""
    (a powerfully emotional ballad), ""I Don't Want to Be Here"" (had it been
    recorded, might have been the best song on <i>Wasp Star</i>) and the
    phantasmagoric avant-slop of ""MOGO"" and ""GOOM"", both of which prove you
    don't have to be hyped up on balls of any kind to be out there.</p><p>
    
    And yes, there are some tunes that might just as well have remained hidden.
    At one point, Partridge had been in the running to pen songs for Disney's
    <i>James and the Giant Peach</i> (Randy Newman ultimately got the gig).
    Though he'd never admit it, it's probably fortunate for Partridge that the
    soccer moms of America didn't get their first taste of his music via this
    movie, as all of his submissions fall far short of his usual standard.
    ""Don't Let Us Bug Ya"" (it's about bugs, hyuck) repeatedly attempts to make
    a song out of one lame joke, while ""Everything Will Be Alright"" may be the
    worst song he wrote in the 90s (""All I Dream of Is a Friend"" from the same
    project, though not included on these volumes, came close).  The problem for
    Partridge is that he appears to equate appealing to the masses with dumbing
    down his material.  And the less said about his sub-Stan Freberg reggae
    answering machine gag, the better.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, I would argue that these sets should've been limited to strictly
    unreleased compositions, omitting the demos for already familiar XTC songs.
    Most of these songs (""Then She Appeared"", ""Merely a Man"", ""That Wave"") don't
    shed much new light on the previously released versions (though The Cure,
    Smiths and Dylan impersonations in a rough version of ""That Wave"" are
    spot-on classic), and more importantly, this angle has already been covered
    on 2002's <i>Coat of Many Cupboards</i> box.  When an artist starts repeating
    himself via leftovers, I question what the future holds.</p><p>
    
    There are rumors that Partridge may expand the <i>Fuzzy Warbles</i> series to
    ten volumes (he swears he's got the backlog to fund it), and I guess that's
    going to mean a few more transactions for die-hard XTC fans.  Hopefully, there
    are as many cherries in those trees as there are here-- which is to say, at least
    enough to justify the notion of Partridge making his drafts available while
    delivering an album of actual rehearsed and recorded stuff is put on the shelf
    much later this year.  I'll play along for now (in a case of co-dependency at
    its worst), but will cry foul if ""Grocery List in E-minor"" ever appears on a
    tracklist.</p></div>"|6183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6183-fuzzy-warbles-vol-1-2/|7.4|Dominique Leone

    to be paraded about-- it was only a matter of time before we came around to The Clash.  But just as calling
    The Clash ""punk"" belittles how their sound had evolved by the movement's curtain call, it would be unfairly
    dismissive to brand The Libertines Clash knock-offs.  You'd have to throw in a line or two about singer
    Pete Doherty sounding uncannily like an English Julian Casablancas to be more dismissive.  British Strokes
    for British folks, as they say.</p><p>
    
    All cards on the table, though: <i>Up the Bracket</i> does emulate, thanks in no small part to production
    care of ex-Clash founder Mick Jones, but it never truly imitates.  Like The Clash before them, The Libertines
    draw primarily from decades of rock tradition-- blues, dub, a healthy whiff of the English countryside, and
    a few gorgeous rock riffs straight from the brainstem of Chuck Berry-- and fuse them into an unruly and
    triumphant monster of an album.  The band burns through a range of emotions with fearless abandon, and just
    when one track seems about to split into pieces, they pull it all together only to threaten glorious collapse
    again on the next song.  From their plaintive anthems to fuck-all barnburners, this is some of the most fun
    I've had with a CD in ages.  Rarely does a band approach such a wide array of attitudes with equal
    proficiency.</p><p>
    
    ""Boys in the Band"" traverses miles of territory in four short minutes; funk-fused riffs lend a dangerous
    swagger to Doherty's ultra-confident vocals before, curiously, the whole thing pulls a 180 into
    barbershop-style harmonies.  It's not as crazy as it sounds, but it's twice as fun.  Later, the band
    find themselves in the throes of a token heartfelt ballad-- even one that delivers unexpected quaintness
    and delicate folk sensibilities-- as old-time cymbal washes make such an obvious track better than it has
    any right to be.  But before the glow fades, they take us right back to hook-laden rock with the title
    song, recalling The Clash's finest moments, complete with vocals lifted from Joe Strummer's back pocket.</p><p>
    
    There's an almost indescribable wealth of rock lurking on <i>Up the Bracket</i>, and rarely is it less than
    blissfully entertaining.  In just thirty-odd minutes, The Libertines pretty much do it all.  Call it
    calculated, call it derivative-- hell, there's so much to this album, you can call it just about anything
    you like and probably not be too far from the truth-- but if you don't hear it, you'll be the one missing
    out.</p></div>"|4769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4769-up-the-bracket/|8.5|Eric Carr

    as the band calls it, ""suburban blues"")-- the kind of smoky, throat-shredded menace that makes you think
    he wants to swallow the microphone and then the whole audience.  If your camp counselor were telling a
    ghost story and this guy jumped out at you at the end, there is no doubt that you would wet yourself.
    If you were eight.</p><p>
    
    The new album from the Bay Area's Dead and Gone, <i>The Beautician</i>, is the first release since Baker
    quit and rejoined the band.  While he was gone the other members formed a separate group, Creeps on Candy,
    and it's easy to see-- especially from their work-- that Baker is what makes this outfit, putting a face
    to the horrorshow mood and pulp-like lyrics.  And this is pulp in the best sense of the word: the imagery
    is wittily imaginative, so much so that I didn't even need to be told that ""Towers on Fire"" wasn't a mockery
    of the Twin Towers disaster (""See the flames through the windows... And we are the walking dead""); I already
    guessed that they chose such gruesome lyrics just because they sound cool.  In fact, the lyrics are littered
    with cartoonish horrors-- ""Rats as Big as Rats"" is particularly notable for the lines, ""Drinking all my
    liquor like a pack of politicians/ RATS RATS RATS RATS!""</p><p>
    
    The album's best track is another reflexively titled song, ""Leave the Dead to Bury the Dead"". Baker's stay
    in a crummy hotel room, abandoned by a girl, becomes an epic dirge.  He turns the squalid imagery into a
    vision of hell, sinking from ""there's nothing on TV"" to ""you're allergic to your own skin/ She won't call
    back,"" before he hits rock bottom: ""And dust is dust/ And Christ just keeps on dying.""  Depending on how
    you read it, this could be the best song about post-hotel-masturbation guilt ever written.</p><p>
    
    All thirteen songs are solid-- so solid, in fact, that few of them stand up and make a difference, melding
    into a half hour of steady dirgecore. But there's enough invention on the fringes to keep the momentum
    (the interlude-like ""Ultimate Remote Control Toy"", for instance, has a great burst of synths) and guitarist
    Rockey Crane plays grinding chords and arch lines with restrained but perfect color.  On tracks like ""Towers
    on Fire"", he bashes the ground and then slices through with a high staccato melody; when he slows down, his
    lines chime through the doom.  The rhythm section (bassist Brian Stern and drummer Joey Perales) is reliably
    heavy, too.</p><p>
<i>The Beautician</i> is Dead and Gone's third album, following two that were produced by Green Day's Billie
    Joe Armstrong.  I conveniently left that fact to the end, so that any of you who are too indie-hip to get
    near a Green Day-related hardcore band could give this one a fair hearing: the anti-commercial, rough-edged
    production, perfectly controlled mood and terrific lyrics make the music entertaining beyond the mosh pits.
    It's recommended to anyone who wants a good album to scowl with.</p></div>"|2209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2209-the-beautician/|6.9|Chris Dahlen

    latest opus, everyone gets re-inundated with PR promises of the old grunge
    gods breaking free from their self-imposed confines for a grand ""return to
    form,"" and told that, ""No, really, this time they've proven themselves as
    something more than a just the band that launched a thousand Candleboxes.""
    Yet, while Pearl Jam have outlasted virtually all of their grunge contemporaries,
    they've hardly ever strayed from the classicist approach that brought them into
    the rock world back in '91.</p><p>
<i>Riot Act</i>, their seventh and most recent album, perpetuates the notion
    that Pearl Jam is a tremendous rock band, despite their catalog's evidence
    to the contrary.  Like communism, Pearl Jam is as good as it gets in theory,
    but it never quite seems to work out in practice: They're a hard working and
    talented group who use their fame to champion causes that are dear to them--
    even when that means alienating fans and fighting unwinnable wars against
    corporate giants-- and they take full advantage of their major label status
    (and dollars) by circumventing traditional ways of thinking about the band/fan
    relationship.  Through fan-club-only Christmas seven-inches and that entire
    tour's worth of live releases, Pearl Jam have attempted to prove that recording
    for the majors doesn't have to be synonymous with MTV pandering.  If only their
    music brimmed with the creativity of their business practices.</p><p>
    
    Since 1998's <i>Yield</i>, Pearl Jam have relied on an unchanging musical
    formula, consistently declining the opportunity to innovate or improve their
    sound, even while hinting that they <i>could</i> if they could be assured it
    wouldn't completely tank.  Since the genre-defining <i>Ten</i>, the band has
    given us occasional glimpses at something more unique-- most notably on
    <i>Vitalogy</i>, a wonderful, reactionary mess of an album, and then with
    the diverse <i>No Code</i>, and even <i>Yield</i>'s Eastern-tinged bonus
    track-- but mostly, they've settled for traditional rock riffs and general
    coasting.  <i>Riot Act</i> sadly exemplifies this, bringing them ever closer
    to homogenous bar-band territory.</p><p>
    
    The record peaks early on the opener ""Can't Keep"", a three-guitar gallop that
    immediately strikes as fresh in contrast to the band's other recent work.
    Eddie Vedder seldom pens a melody this original, and the song's gloomy,
    atmospheric production compensates for the bored musicianship.  From there,
    however, <i>Riot Act</i> meanders from one song to the next with an
    overwhelming insipidness.  The devastated lyrics of ""Love Boat Captain"",
    which mourns the tragic deaths of nine fans at the June 2000 Roskilde
    Festival, are affecting, but the song itself is a standard rocker, which
    seems an odd choice to accompany Vedder's poetic remorse.</p><p>
<i>Riot Act</i> does momentarily pick up as it nears its end.  ""Greendisease""
    is the closest to new wave Pearl Jam has ever come, and the Jeff Ament-penned
    ""Help Help"" passes on the simple fact that it sounds at least <i>somewhat</i>
    different from the band's archetypal rock'n'roll sound, and breaks the monotony
    of an otherwise barren collection of songs.</p><p>
    
    Of course, what'll likely stick with you after the disc stops spinning is the
    unbearable lows.  The mechanical, pulsating guitar arpeggios of ""You Are"" almost
    seem to cop from <i>Trans</i>-era Neil Young until you realize that it'd set a
    nice ambiance for a semi-truck barreling down a highway in Stallone's <i>Over
    the Top</i>.  Worse still is ""Bushleaguer"", a near-rap about D.C.'s current
    policy makers.  Vedder's intentions here are admirable, but it's difficult to
    imagine the execution failing any more miserably.  His delivery is painfully
    snide, served up with snotty, ain't-I-witty attitude, and the lyrics, which
    clearly aim for a grittier mentality than typical Pearl Jam fare (""Swingin' for
    the fence/ Got lucky with a strike/ Drilling for fear makes the job simple/
    Born on third, thinks he got a triple"") come off more Springsteen than Fugazi.</p><p>
    
    Everywhere else on <i>Riot Act</i>, Pearl Jam sound like they're supposed to,
    with their usual distortion-powered riffs and stadium drums banging alongside
    Vedder's emotionally damaged mumbling.  And though it's hard, even now, not to
    root for them, this album has sadly not upped their relistenability.</p></div>"|6206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6206-riot-act/|4.9|Kyle Reiter

    and a half ago. At first, there was a certain novelty in knowing that the somewhat unclassifiable Austrian
    Mego label, often responsible for a blend of heavy noise processing with a sweet undercurrent, would be
    introducing a wholehearted pop album. ""100% nerdy glitch-boy free,"" read the press release. Upon finally
    hearing the album, the novelty was completely irrelevant. <i>Shojo Toshi</i> seemed to shed the antisocial
    shield and intrinsic self-aware cynicism of our rich lineage of electronic music. A welcome contrast to
    tongue-in-cheek hip-hop references (obsessively aiming at a mundane form of subversion), those who think
    the vibraphone is the end-all and be-all of exciting music, and the token group of run-of-the-mill
    noisemongers. Aesthetically moving and impervious to inane musical politics, Tujiko Noriko had the
    potential to appeal to more than just elitist art snobs.</p><p>
    The collage cover of <i>Shojo Toshi</i>, designed by Noriko's visual art team, SlideLab, explains the music
    better than I can. On the left side, a soldier sits atop a skyscraper, further down a businessman talks on
    a cellphone, and on the right, Noriko hides under a mushroom, shooting a baguette in their direction. The
    images are comical, inviting, and full of pathos, but perhaps what's most striking is SlideLab's restraint.
    A good portion of the cover is left to a monochromatic cream tint, allowing plenty of space for the drama
    to unfold within. Noriko's music is achingly similar, a singular, monochromatic chord progression or beat
    is spread over the length of each song, often pushing around six minutes, and is punctuated by masterful
    arrangements of sound borrowed from the surrounding world, be it a businessman on a cellphone or a
    tape-recorded orchestra.</p><p>
<i>Make Me Hard</i> is a refinement of these ideas. The interjections of found melodies, concrete noise,
    affecting sense of disparate elements matched together, and the real selling point, Noriko's extremely
    emotive voice, are all placed in the expansive background of repetition. Noriko seems to narrate the
    surreal environment of her album, and the encompassing sense of autobiography adds to the unique allure of
    the work.</p><p>
    The songs seem colossal in duration, even more sonically dense than before, and yet somehow restricted in
    scope. There are many different textural, cultural, and personal ideas at play on <i>Make Me Hard</i>, and
    Noriko has built what seems like a much-too rigid form for their display. The songs, while often achieving
    breathtaking eloquence, occasionally rely too heavily on Noriko's well-explored ethereal and repetitive
    modes. The strengths and weaknesses of the album fit clearly into this design. If Noriko's work didn't
    expand small fragments of life into broad, encompassing, and passionate epics, it would lose much of its
    charm, yet the music, in its far-reaching and complex toggling through thousands of pieces of aural
    detritus, throbs for a next step.</p><p>
    There is a sense that this album might've been better served as either an epic, single piece, with
    attention paid to an overall sense of unity, or shortened by about 20 minutes, tightening the ends of the
    songs as they stand. Yet, this in no way undermines the great strides Noriko has taken with <i>Make Me
    Hard</i>. Despite comparisons to Phew, Haco, and even Björk, Noriko's style and personality seem without
    obvious precedent. <i>Make Me Hard</i>, while imperfect, is full of color and obsessed with the joy of
    observation.  And, oh yeah, it's all in Japanese.  Good luck.</p></div>"|5834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5834-make-me-hard/|7.2|Matthew Wellins

Blige-style vocals and happy, singalong, jam-on-the-beach melodies. Okay, that was just to fool the     speed readers in the audience. Let's get down to business. A Viennese avant-garde multi-instrumentalist     named Werner Dafeldecker (formerly of Polwechsel) and his associate, Klaus Lang, pick up a double bass     and a pipe organ and record an album of somber, droning minimalism in an Austrian church, naming their     tracks in binary code. But wait, these guys do have a sense of humor. What else could be responsible for     separating these irreparable and seemingly barely altered nasalizing mediations into separate pieces?     Everyone will freely admit there's barely a less pretentious way to spend your evening this side of     funding an absinthe-serving café bookstore dedicated to Flat-Art and Superrealism.</p><p>The back of the album tells me Dafeldecker plays acoustic guitar on this, but I doubt anyone except a     forensics scientist would be able to track down where that comes in. With barely any digital effects     (some small radio work at the beginning), Dafeldecker and Lang have essentially gotten rid of the defining     characteristics of each instrument. The entire first half is a chilling, imperceptibly moving hum,     occasionally merging into a tone or two almost accidentally, as if the music an instrument makes has     absolutely no relation to the instrument itself. My familiarity with the attributes of a pipe organ are     rather deficient at the moment, but, purely speculating, it doesn't seem it was intended for manufacturing     the glazed, frigid winds that flail throughout the session, bereft of any tone. They also seem bereft of     any composition or agency on the part of the player. It's the sound of a pipe organ when no one's listening     to it.</p><p>Dafeldecker's bass is generally used for bizarre, phantasmal brushing and skimming that I might call     percussive, though it's barely even that. The only word that can approximate it is, for better or worse,     silence. As can be easily imagined, the resulting music is a group of low, laggard frequencies that are     more about the process these sounds come from than the sound itself, particularly as the sound is nearly     inaudible in some places. There are long passages, say five to ten minutes, of either nothingness or     subtle gradations of wind. The experience is not dissimilar to sitting in a slightly turbulent plane:     inherently disconcerting, but not particularly pernicious. If you think it would be impossible to produce     a solo bass/pipe organ album without resorting to clichéd new age, this album would not disprove your     theory. One could easily fall asleep from the jetlag, but nevertheless there's a high-pitched whistle     that would make any repose fairly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Compared to the first fifteen minutes, the few mischievously pathetic tones that emerge on the third track     feel like the dawn of civilization or a fifty-piece orchestra.  Dafeldecker eventually makes his bass sound     like a brass instrument (which I find analogous to making a sink sound like an answering machine).  On     track four, he similarly turns it into a woodwind. There are two slight discontinuities: the beginning of     the fifth track, a simply creepy siphoning of translucent gases into the celestial sphere, a church run     on pistons and tremolos, and the last track where three microtones sort of form a melody if the listener's     a dog.</p>
<p>If you solely like ""music"" or albums that don't involve the mastery of German pronunciation, you'll loathe     these pieces with a passion. If you like some of Polwechsel's or Dafeldecker's earlier work, or even     hyper-minimalism in general (think Alvin Lucier or Keith Rowe's more boring works), this ""sound"" might     not bear too many repeated hearings, but it's undeniably fascinating. As that's essentially the point of     good experimental music (besides the intellectual value of impressing your friends with words like     Dafeldecker), this will provide some slight discomfort to those familiar with this kind of music and     calamitous anger to those who think albums always need to be making some sort of noise.</p></div>"|2523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2523-lichtgeschwindigkeit/|6.9|Alexander Lloyd Linhardt

    Yonkers, New York's vicious death metal troupe Immolation has long been the apotheosis of consistency.
    Emerging from the burgeoning New York Death Metal (NYDM) scene of the late 1980s with a solid fanbase
    inspired by a smattering of garage quality, proto-technical demos from the band (then known as Rigor Mortis),
    Immolation established a raw fusion of chaotic punk and thrash built upon harmonic cacophony, blistering
    drums, and genuine hatred for all things Christian.  Adhering steadfast to the strictures of death,
    destruction, and nihilism, this band has remained one of the most ""popular"" participants in underground
    death metal, bludgeoning its audience with four albums of the most relentless, alarming, brutal, (and yes,
    formulaic) death metal on record.</p><p>
    Immolation's newest offering, <i>Unholy Cult</i>, continues to charter the same austere ground of their
    previous releases with only a modicum of artistic progression.  Now encompassing unusual hybrids of heavy
    metal, death metal, and black metal with shifting allegorical phrasing, breakneck tempos, and trudging
    funeral dirges, <i>Unholy Cult</i> is an album that will please the band's devoted cultish fanbase without
    necessarily turning the heads of anyone else.</p><p>
    In tracks like ""Sinful Nature"", a juggernaut of seething madness and brute force, the guttural vocals of
    singer/bassist Ross Dolan-- his style having always stood in contrast to the less refined howling of other
    death metal vocalists-- help erect a typically self-contemptuous landscape.  While he bellows lines like,
    ""How can we live with ourselves/ Our jealousy, our tyranny/ The lives we make, the lives we take/ The fools
    we serve, the fools we are,"" drummer Alex Hernandez rips through exhausting combinations of blastbeats and
    double-kick licks.  Meanwhile, guitarists Tom Wilkinson, Bill Taylor, and Robert Vigna create layer upon
    layer of absurdist riffs and hellish noise dangling on the brink of disorder.  Immolation builds to these
    moments of pseudo-chaos effectively throughout <i>Unholy Cult</i>, and degenerating tidal waves of noise
    back to repetition and melody has always been their strong suit.</p><p>
    The most avant-garde offering from Immolation's latest disc comes in the form of ""Rival the Eminent"", a
    5\xBD-minute foray into an amalgam of speed metal's scorching pace and black metal's purified melody and rhythm.
    Moving through heroic pathos lyrically and instrumentally-- brought to a head by a searing solo guitar lead
    roughly halfway through-- ""Rival"" demonstrates all shades of Immolation without ever becoming tiresome or
    predictable.  Sludgy bass and kickdrums are drilled into the listener's head with such abandon and persistence
    that it's simply impossible to ignore.  This brand of repetition serves in a similar capacity to the high
    frequency assault of power electronics groups; tones and phrases are so unavoidable that the listener's
    synapses can't help but be altered by the sheer power of Immolation's attack.</p><p>
    For much of the death metal community-- many of whom have existed in a catatonic state for the past fifteen
    years-- this disc will be precisely the panacea they've been looking for: a stirring indictment of Christian
    dogma and guilt buried within a lobotomizing wall of chromatics and dissonance.  <i>Unholy Cult</i> is
    ferocious, loud, and technically and tactically precise.  Alas, for those of you too undiscerning to
    comprehend the difference between schlock and shock, this album will probably confirm all of your worst
    suspicions about death metal: the racist, irreligious, and unflinchingly juvenile champion of the underground.
    But, because it doesn't display a significant thematic progression or a desire to pander to a wider audience,
    this album doesn't try so much to allay your fears as it does to prey upon them, and for that there should
    be some rejoicing.</p></div>"|4079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4079-unholy-cult/|7.4|Isaiah Violante

When affixed to the word ""clash,"" it's come to
    stand for a recent movement in electronic music that draws from the icy and
    removed synth-pop sound of the 80s, strips the beats down, and turns the
    lyrical focus to the joy and loathing in decadent sex. Because ""electroclash""
    is an unwieldy word, many have taken to shortening it to just plain ""electro.""
    I find this abbreviation confusing, because the word ""electro"" has such specific
    connotations in my mind. To me, electro is an early strain of hip-hop that used
    the stiff machine beats of Kraftwerk as a foundation for a new, sci-fi obsessed
    form of funk.</p><p>
    
    Time and meanings change, though, and I'm trying to set aside my semantic biases
    and get with the program. Still, hearing this record by Transllusion, one half
    of Drexciya, got me thinking about the original electro and how it developed as
    a vehicle for two expressions. On the one end, dating from 1982, Afrika Bambaataa's
    ""Planet Rock"" is without question <em>the</em> electro classic of the era, a party
    jam through and through. This sound and vibe made its way down South and played a
    part in what came to be called Miami Bass. ""Planet Rock"" is the future as a
    high-tech carnival.</p><p>
    
    The other branch of electro was bound for a more desolate and isolated Northern
    climate. On their influential 1983 track ""Clear"", Detroit's Cybotron saw electro
    as a means for projecting a cold, depressing future where technology leads to
    alienation. ""Clear"" is clearly not celebration music, and this is the branch of
    electro that picked up some sounds and eventually morphed into ultra-serious
    Detroit techno (Juan Atkins, who was half of Cybotron, was an originator of
    the Detroit sound).</p><p>
    
    The wintry side of the place where electro-meets-techno has been kept alive in
    Detroit by Drexciya, the mysterious duo comprised of the Gerald Donald and the
    late James Stinson (he died in September of this year). Ironically, the
    identities of Drexciya's members were revealed only shortly before Stinson
    passed away. For most of the group's life, it remained an anonymous outfit
    dedicated to producing paradoxically cold yet emotionally evocative music
    from the Detroit template. Drexciya side projects included The Other People
    Place and Transllusion.</p><p>
    
    As electronic music goes, there's something oddly timeless about Transllusion.
    Certain aspects of the production sound quite current, while other bits are
    allude to the 80s. The synth patterns in ""Bump It"", for example, are very
    early videogame, but the thick bottom end seems of a more recent vintage.
    I have to say that of the Drexciya-related material I've heard, <i>L.I.F.E.</i>
    seems especially grim and bleak, and the repetition, while central to the
    project's aesthetic, is wearying. It's certainly a good record that succeeds
    at what it sets out to do, but I expect that I won't find myself in the mood
    to listen too often. I hope not, anyway.</p><p>
    
    Most of the tracks follow a similar template. The midtempo drum hits are
    ridged as drop forge steel, never deviating even slightly for the beat,
    never pausing for a fill, never laying out. Moving through and around
    the beats are all manner of synth squiggles that give some hint of the
    unpredictable nature of organic life. And the thread through it all is the
    deep and menacing bass tones that make sure the dark cloud never goes away.</p><p>
    
    The contrast between the downright oppressive repetition of the drum machine
    and the looser, softer synth patches make me think of these tracks as a view
    of a factory floor. The steel crash of the factory machines are always there,
    but moving between the spaces are the people, flesh just barely visible
    beneath helmets and through gaps in their coveralls. There's humanity in
    Transllusion's music, but it takes a lot of effort and compassion to find it.</p></div>"|8142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8142-life/|7.4|Mark Richardson

    eventually recognized as one of the most admirable achievements in pop music.  And since Brian Wilson ruined
    the incipient goodwill that he'd begun to garner when he shelved its follow-up, <i>Smile</i>, it seemed like
    <i>Pet Sounds</i> might never enjoy its day in the sun.  Surprisingly enough, though, the 1990s elevated it
    to higher levels of critical and popular acclaim than it might have ever seen.  This was due in no small
    part to the fact that that decade saw Wilson's handsome progeny coming of age. From Wilco's <i>Summerteeth</i>
    to Matthew Sweet's <i>In Reverse</i>, Brian Wilson's fingerprints were all over every talented pop songwriter
    who chose to become expansive without turning ""progressive.""</p><p>
    
    Wilco and Matthew Sweet both retained their own voices even as they unabashedly displayed their influences.
    Such is not entirely the case with <i>Let It Grow</i>, the second long-player from Toronto's Meligrove Band.
    A trio of 23-year-olds, the Meligrove Band shifts their approach from that heard on 2000's <i>Stars &amp; Guitars</i>
    into a much larger and more orchestrated affair. Their new style is reminiscent of vintage Beach Boys, but
    when they throw in some overly familiar So-Cal harmonies and trademark leaps into falsetto, they invite a
    comparison that they're bound to lose. Although not everything on <i>Let It Grow</i> is lifted straight
    from <i>Pet Sounds</i> and its brethren, it borrows heavily enough to make you wonder why you should listen
    to it when you could go to the source.</p><p>
    
    But perhaps you've memorized <i>Pet Sounds</i> and find yourself frustrated by Brian Wilson's (and Mike Love's)
    eccentricities in the Beach Boys' later work.  You're left with a hunger for more of the same, and you've got
    nowhere to turn. The Meligrove Band hopes you'll turn to them. And why not, if it works?  <i>Let It Grow</i>
    makes it clear why originality is such an overrated quality. Sure, the band nicks too much from classic
    sunshine pop for their own good, but their sources are superb and their music well executed, taking them
    through countless surprise twists and turns. Their playing is accomplished and tasteful, as well, with
    guitarist Jason Nunes shining nicely whenever he gets the chance, and their fine vocals are sweet enough
    to melt away any objections about the freshness of their approach.</p><p>
    
    So yes, <i>Let It Grow</i> is a nice listen, but more than anything, it offers plenty of reason to believe
    that better things are yet to come. The Meligrove Band sounds like a group on the verge of outgrowing their
    derivative tendencies, and that's certainly good news, as too often throughout this album, the elements that
    make up their ultimate sound are walled off from each other, as a hard-edged guitar rocker is followed by a
    quaintly polished chamber-pop track. Songs that feature more of a mixture, such as ""Check Your Messages"" and
    the epic closer, ""A Different Ship"", easily outpace the more streamlined tracks.  Considering the tender ages
    of the band members and the unimpeachable pedigree of their influences, it seems likely enough that their
    next release will be even better.</p></div>"|5210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5210-let-it-grow/|6.8|Brian James

    <i>If the Twenty-First Century Didn't Exist It Would Be Necessary to Invent It</i>.  Fair enough.  The
    label itself has, in its four-year existence, proven itself nothing if not innovative, and earned a rep
    for issuing some of the most challenging and forward-thinking bands going right now-- from Xiu Xiu and
    Young People to Deerhoof and Get Hustle.  And this, its first commercially available compilation (not
    including last year's <i>Charm</i> soundtrack), collects a slew of material from 24 bands of every non-genre
    you can dream up (twee avant-pop, groaning electronic music, gutbucket balladry), plus several tracks content
    to simply put a new spin on rocking your ass off.</p><p>
    That said, it's also a difficult compilation.  Much of the music is abrasive and the sound quality is lo-fi
    and grey, like it was mastered by the equivalent of a library Xerox machine.  But a more serious issue is
    that some of the most interesting bands here can hardly be represented by a single track: it's difficult to
    grasp, from just one song, exactly where they're coming from, what attitude they take to their music, and
    what guides their decisions.  Compare this setlist to the legendary and not dissimilar <i>No New York</i>,
    which took just four bands and gave them four songs apiece; <i>The Twenty-First Century</i> is more of a
    starting point for further research than a complete picture of whatever scene encapsulates these bands.</p><p>
    And the music is all over the map.  For example, you've got your drama queens, writing ballads in the
    exaggerated vein of black box theater.  Young People's ""Rich Bitch"" mixes harrowing guitars and plaintive
    plain-spoken vocals behind a song that's brief but wrenching.  And THETEETHE's cover of the Beach Boys'
    ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"", with guitars as spare as balsa wood, is nicely persuasive,
    despite that their singer's vocals are so whinily emotive it sounds like he's putting you on.  By contrast,
    the clumsily naïve lyrics of Dilute's country-tinged ""Home Is Where You're Happy"" are probably ironic, but
    the song still comes off as lightweight.</p><p>
    Xiu Xiu also make an appearance, offering a track called ""Sad Cory-o-Grapher"".  The song is a subdued ballad
    that lacks the band's usual fan-pleasing percussion assault, but succeeds on its merits nonetheless.  Jamie
    Stewart sings in a stiffly uncomfortable voice, quite like someone's inflating a balloon in his ass, if I
    may be so frank, but the melody's sweet, and the startling sci-fi synth figure makes the song a clear
    standout here.</p><p>
    The few electronic tracks stretch my familiarity with the genre, and I can't fairly judge if Semiautomatic
    and Girls in Trouble are as monotonous and unpleasant as they sound here-- with their low-tech synths and
    robotic vocals, they make a grim, asexual sort of zombie dance music.  The excellent and wildly prolific
    Wolf Eyes, however, hand in ""Cut the Dog"" which is far more extreme, with abrasive industrial beats,
    spritz-wire noises, and weirdest of all, a bell, covering muffled, distant vocals.  It sounds not unlike
    a zamboni plowing through mud, but it's engrossingly intense.  Elsewhere, Quintron's ""9-4-9"" resembles
    Prince singing sub-Jon Spencer Blues Explosion material, though it shows off the band's homemade ""drum
    buddy"" drum machine; the track is catchy, but I'd have to hear more of this to gauge how it's different
    from any other act with wacky lyrics and fat analog beats.</p><p>
    When all of this gets too heavy, 5RC breaks up the mood with fantastic avant-pop.  Deerhoof's ""Sweet Knight
    Brugmansia"" displays the band's zaniest, kids'-album loopy-pop, with Satomi Matsuzaki's little girl sing-song
    (""flow-er, flow-er, flow-ooh-ah!"") lilting over the calliope-like pace of the guitar crunch and scattershot
    drums.  The Seconds' ""Mommy Mommy Mommy"" has jittery guitars and a verse that echoes James Chance and the
    Contortion's ""Flip Your Face"", though it's about a tenth as feverish.  Another nostalgic and crowd-pleasing
    track, the Sick Lipstick's ""Teenage Robot"", is probably the easiest sell on the entire record: it takes the
    surefire formula of a youngish-sounding girl chanting sci-fi nonsense (""We are the teenage robots.../ Can't
    stop us/ Mission's to destroy!"") and smears hot pink strawberry frosting all over it in the form of catchy
    guitar and organs.</p><p>
    For the quickest music fix, of course, you can skip right to the rock, which comes from a series of
    phenomenal instrumental power-duos. Hella, a guitar and drum duo, contribute a live recording that sports
    tight choreography and rapid but melodic, Dick Dale-like twists and hydroplaning.  Orthrelm and Osric,
    meanwhile, are somewhat akin to Hella but play ten times faster: both feature guitarist Mick Barr, a speed
    metal monster who takes the sweatiest on-his-knees peak of a Yngwie Malmsteen concert solo and plays at
    nothing but that speed.  In Orthrelm he's paired with drummer Josh Blair, who follows him unerringly; in
    Osric, he uses a drum machine, which simplifies the compositions and actually gives him a longer leash for
    fiercer shredding.  Some fans have called him ""the best guitarist in the world.""  That's probably a bit like
    saying that some guy who wins the 300 meter sprint is the world's best athlete, but in the narrow space of
    what Barr does, he's incredible to behold.</p><p>
<i>The Twenty-First Century</i> doesn't kick off the new millennium.  It doesn't even flush away the 20th
    century (though I would pay handsomely to see someone do that).  But it does highlight an important difference
    between ""different"" and ""revolutionary."" The world is full of experimental artists and bands, despite what
    the Vines-clogged media suggests; it's just that those bands are more likely to cultivate an individual
    voice than they are to set an example for anybody else.  5RC makes a strong case by putting so many disparate
    bands together and finding what they have in common: they're all pushing the boundaries just enough to make
    space for themselves.  This may not be the smoothest anthology of the year, but it is an incredible roadmap
    of the newest off-center voices in rock: for noise fiends and pop fans alike, there's something here to
    annoy everybody.</p></div>"|1838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1838-if-the-twenty-first-century-didnt-exist-it-would-be-necessary-to-invent-it/|7.6|Chris Dahlen

    within that orbit, every record by the KLF and FFWD, every Dr Alex Patterson appearance on a Juno
    Reactor disc, and every Sun Electric production by Orb conspirator Thomas Fehlmann somehow sprung me
    further out, into the realms of Richard D James, Stockhausen, etc. Ultimately, I moved out of the house.</p><p>
    Thomas Fehlmann seems to have moved on as well.  He's forgone the fluffy carbohydrate excesses of the past
    to go high-protein within the calorie-burning Köln microhouse scene, and tightened his skills considerably
    in the supposedly young man's game of dance music. ""Streets of Blah"", the opening track on his debut

    elliptical cross-trainer underfoot. He's pumping at an even pace, but so hard that the machine is made to

    throughout by slightly switching up the program: a four-note bass burble slips in with staccato stabbed-key
    jerks on ""Superbock"", while ""Rotenfaden"" steps it back up with more weights strapped to the kickdrum and
    hi-hat, heart pumping.</p><p>
    Fehlmann obviously had his headphones plugged into Euro club proceedings over the years, be it Mike Ink's
    cardio work and the glistening rivulets of sweat on ""Du Fehlst Mir"", or the textural clicks 'n' cuts of
    ""Making It Whistle"". Unlike some top-heavy dance workouts, hits posited just at the beginning, Fehlmann
    shows not only incredible staying power, but proportionate muscle balance that strengthens the disc as it
    goes. ""Gratis"" takes some free-weight clangs and mixes them with a hard skank strut, hardly feeling like
    a stationary machine. He even feels fit enough to return to some of his classic chill-out near the disc's
    end. ""Boheme Rouge"" takes in deep breaths and stretches out, ending the session with a deep sense of
    satisfaction.</p><p>
    Rejuvenated by such a workout, his insulin firmly under control, Fehlmann hardly belies his age or pedigree,
    not only as the first person to put out a house record in Britain (as Ready Made in 1986), but as a famed
    collaborator with Blake Baxter, Juan Atkins, Maurizio, and Erasure (to name just a few) over the past two
    decades. Screw Richard Simmons; this is all the cardiovascular activity you'll need for a while.</p></div>"|3024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3024-visions-of-blah/|7.5|Andy Beta

Too many bands just stand there, meekly
    playing their songs without ever bothering to say a word to the crowd or act engaged.  It's amazing how
    seldom something simple as telling the audience what band they're listening to crosses the mind of the
    people on stage, much less anything approaching stage presence.</p><p>
    
    I caught the Capitol Years on a Sunday night in a nearly empty room, maybe a month ago, and they were a
    blast of fresh air after years spent in the hyperbaric chamber of indie rock shows.  These guys might as
    well have been playing for a stadium full of obnoxiously screaming fans.  They interacted with the skeletal
    crowd, played a spirited, tight set that radiated enthusiasm.  A show I'd gone to solely out of curiosity
    and boredom actually made me move and stuck with me.  What are the chances?</p><p>
    
    I wasn't crazy about the first Capitol Years record, <i>Meet Yr Acres</i>, which was basically a solo
    recording by bandleader Shai Halperin (or Shai, Son of Eli, as he sometimes goes by), but after that show,
    I was willing to give their full-band debut a try, and to my delight, it doesn't disappoint.  These guys
    take the all-out rock and free-flowing energy of their show and smash it onto a little plastic disc that's
    a blast to listen to.</p><p>
<i>Jewelry Store</i> is old-school rock'n'roll, but I want to clarify that it's clearly quite separate from
    the garage rock renaissance.  The Capitol Years pluck their bluesy riffs and rough harmonies from the past
    with the same lack of pretense that makes it work for bands like Sloan, who seem to embody the spirit of
    their influences, as well as their sound.
    
    ""Even if you're happy, won't you let me buy you more,"" exhorts Halperin to his romantic interest on the
    fantastic title track, a classic rave-up built on a solid boogie progression and rock hard drumming from
    ""Sir"" Kyle Lloyd.  ""River Raid"" (which I hope is named for my favorite Atari 2600 title) runs away on a
    ragged guitar and a series of feel changes, but it's the closer, ""Train Race"", that stands out as the clear
    winner.  The hook is built around the most musically demure moment on the EP, and it's followed immediately
    by an onslaught of monster riffs and propulsive rhythms that serve to highlight how well crafted it is.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the record, the production of Brian McTear (Burning Brides, Haywood) and Thom Monahan (Pernice
    Brothers, Scud Mountain Boys) keeps the VU meters hot and the sound focused.  The final result is a
    well-realized reinvention of the Capitol Years name, and a damn good time.  Their show may still be the
    best place to catch them, but the <i>Jewelry Store</i> is worth a trip.</p></div>"|1295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1295-jewelry-store-ep/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    on easy targets.  Yet, only in a society as sarcasm-infected as ours is such a claim even comprehensible.
    With such subtle wit at the heart of their humor, there's no ""easy""-- only targets for Negativland; just
    because a blind dude could take pot shots at Bono's ego from a hundred yards doesn't make U2 any less
    significant.  The same holds for the band's 1997 release <i>Dispepsi</i>: relative simplicity or not, their
    withering antics are dead-on hilarious and corrosively incisive.</p><p>
    
    But one of the few crimes of which Negativland haven't been commonly accused-- one that seems to plague similar
    provocateurs-- is the heinous failing of style over substance.  Rarely has the collective's methods prevented
    them from making a point.  Of course, there's a first time for everything.  Despite their best efforts,
    nothing on <i>Deathsentences of the Polished and Structurally Weak</i> is even half as interesting or
    poignant as the CD casing itself, and musically, the decision to focus on this album's mood and textures
    largely falls flat.  Without a semblance of direction within the album itself, <i>Deathsentences</i> is
    emptier than Negativland's refrigerators.</p><p>
    
    Oh, but where to begin?  See, the guys have packaged this disc inside a mock automobile owner's manual, the
    to-scale insert depicting numerous pieces of reclaimed wreckage, as well as written documents recovered from
    the wreckage, (ostensibly) pertaining to the victims of the accidents.  Sometimes disturbing, sometimes
    touching, sometimes tragically mundane, these documents are the conceptual inspiration for the album artfully
    described by the band as ""the destruction of [their] studio in an automobile accident"".  A concept so emotionally
    and atmospherically rich is far beyond simply a functional theme for an album, but it's a brilliant one, and
    in the hands of such expert found-sound manipulators, I expected stunning results.</p><p>
    
    I dove into the album hoping for readings and retellings of the victims' tales, and sad, stirring aural
    vignettes to match the desolation of the scenes depicted in the booklet (if only it could all be as exquisite
    as Richard Lyons' segment contribution for Ira Glass' ""This American Life"").  Negativland, evidently, had
    different intentions regarding <i>Deathsentences</i>, opting to allow their talents for subtlety to take
    the fore.  There are no lyrics of any discernible sort contained on this disc, and indeed, the samples they
    include are so heavily glitched and echoed that they quickly become indistinct, leaving only hazy wonderings
    as to their origins.  Done properly, such a simple approach could have served as a perfect corollary to the
    theme they had set for themselves, but this time, Negativland have been undone by their own vagueness.</p><p>
<i>Deathsentences</i> is really a single track partitioned into twelve bite-sized cuts, and the album
    shares a single, murky atmosphere throughout.  Those looking to plumb the depths to search for some link,
    some remotely tangible tie to the concept it allegedly promotes, will be disappointed.  Occasionally,
    rumblings of distant snippets or soundbytes bubble to the surface from out of the submarine twilight, but
    their significance or purpose is never clear.  Even with the printed subtext for these tracks firmly in
    mind, the claustrophobic soundscapes are impenetrable and formless, offering no insight at all to the intent--
    a shocking departure for the boys from the Bay.</p><p>
    
    The only reason <i>Deathsentences</i> isn't a total wash is owed to the mildly interesting, but wholly
    generic, atmosphere of the album as a unit.  A gentle air of mournfulness clings to it through the scattered,
    almost random sound collages.  The creepy isolation produced is arguably a fulfillment of the fundamental
    idea-- but it's so obtuse, anyone could name a dozen bands that equally capture identical feelings of
    melancholy (albeit without the benefit of a flashy manual).  The pervasive mood and rhythmless,
    glitch-driven complexity of the album make it at least somewhat enjoyable, if only as background music,
    but that's about the best that can be said for it.  If only the album could stand up to its packaging,
    instead of just mysteriously implying some sense of content.  After twenty years of insightful,
    reality-warping satire, outright mayhem, copyright infringement, and litigation, a band like Negativland
    is bound to run out of targets-- but even with such an immaculate concept, it seems that there's still an
    inadvertent butt to this non-joke.  Shame that it has to be their audience.</p></div>"|5738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5738-deathsentences-of-the-polished-and-structurally-weak/|4.3|Eric Carr

    As I'm sure you are all aware, 2002 has been a fantastic year for the concept album, quite possibly one of
    the best since our heyday at the turn of the 1970s.  While major-label artists resisted the rock opera urge
    (which is perhaps for the best; let us not forget <i>MACHINA</i> and Chris Gaines), acts below the mainstream
    radar took up the slack nicely.  John Vanderslice, Black Heart Procession, Pedro the Lion... hip-hop even
    gave us a concept record that, shockingly, was not a science fiction gimmick: Mr. Lif's <i>I Phantom</i>.</p><p>
    
    Soon, we'll be voting on final nominees for our honorary Pete Townshend Concept Album of the Year award.
    But before you cast your ballot, some members have requested that we address a late entry to this year's
    competition: The Mountain Goats' <i>Tallahassee</i>.  Since his full-length cassette debut in 1991, John
    Darnielle has threaded the sagas of flawed relationships through his albums, generally told in one-song
    installments.  Now, for the first time in 81 albums (okay, 16... or something, it's confusing), Darnielle
    has expanded these tragic stories into an entire LP, set in the diamond city of Florida's panhandle.</p><p>
    
    The idea is enticing: Darnielle, known for crafting two-minute biographies like ""Fall of the Star High
    School Running Back"" richer in detail than a 700-page novel, is given greater room to flesh out his stories.
    His talent for depicting the rises and falls of a relationship in singular, tiny details (fighting over the
    car radio, for example) makes him ideal for the task of an indie-folk <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>.</p><p>
    
    The result is the pleasant musical equivalent of a slow, deliberate character study, rich with symbols like
    circling crows and a house in disrepair, more concerned with in-depth observation of the protagonists than
    with narrative movement.  Unfortunately, this pace makes for a less than successful concept album, with
    song topics tracing an endless I Love You/I Love You Not oscillation, from the cautious happiness of the
    title track and ""Game Shows Touch Our Lives"" to the for-the-throat attacks of ""No Children"" or ""Have to
    Explode"".</p><p>
    
    The music is distracted by another concept, as well-- a meta-concept, if you will, with <i>Tallahassee</i>
    touted as the first Mountain Goats release to be recorded with a full, traditionally-instrumented rock band.
    Darnielle spends most of the album teasing the listener with this promise, adding a bass here, some minimal
    drums there, perhaps a harmonica, before (gotcha!) we arrive back at a Darnielle solo arrangement.  When we
    finally come to a song with an actual, honest-to-God rhythm section (""See America Right"") it sounds
    disappointingly like... Cake?!</p><p>
    
    The majority of <i>Tallahassee</i>, recorded with Darnielle's Extra Glenns cohort Franklin Bruno, is, like
    the Extra Glenns' <i>Martial Arts Weekend</i>, typically stripped-down Goats fare with an occasional
    minimal embellishment.  And as has been the case whenever Darnielle has chosen a studio over his trusty
    Panasonic boombox, the end result sounds somewhat thin-- especially considering the more delicate
    strum-style he's been developing of late.  A few exceptions are pleasant, like the Casio-fed ""Southwood
    Plantation Road"" or the bright piano line that runs through ""No Children"" before the delightfully/horrifically
    bitter singalong chorus, but songs like ""Peacock"" and ""Idylls of the King"" are over-wispy.  Johnny Goat's
    usual lyrical acuity also comes slightly short of his usual track record, as he unveils one of the best
    entries from his notebook of ""Love is like..."" similes (in this case, it's like ""the border between Greece
    and Albania"") only to later drop the dud, ""People say friends don't destroy one another/ What do they know
    about friends?""</p><p>
    
    These transgressions are somewhat forgiven, however, by ""Oceanographer's Choice"", <i>Tallahassee</i>'s only
    song to truly come through with the full-band promise, and a breathtaking portrait of the usual relationship
    violence becoming physical.  With drums and ominous organ that finally add some urgency to the story, and
    sad, sliding electric guitar swooping in and out like symbolic crows, the music finally measures up to the
    emotional intensity of Darnielle's imagery.  When the band drops out, the scene freezes, and the characters
    fully realize the consequences of their meltdown: ""What will I do when I don't have you?""</p><p>
    
    Suffice to say, if the rest of <i>Tallahassee</i> lived up to the standard set by ""Oceanographer's Choice"",
    we'd have a surefire candidate here for Concept Album of the Year.   However, <i>Tallahassee</i> is not even
    2002's second best song cycle about disintegrating love (it's succeeded by Pedro the Lion's <i>Control</i>
    and Black Heart Procession's <i>Amore del Tropico</i>).  While <i>Tallahassee</i>, as literature, is richly
    detailed, even stunning on occasion, Darnielle's apparent phobia for full-band arrangements prevents the
    music from keeping pace with the storylines.  It's an admirable experiment, but not one that will likely
    find its way to the podium come election time.</p></div>"|5450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5450-tallahassee/|6.7|Rob Mitchum

    titles to this particular disc, Kevin Drumm's third solo release, and first for the electronic Viennese
    label. Some names scribbled down (and ultimately scratched out) included: <i>Brain Scratch Avalanche</i>,
    <i>Tooth Filling Freebaser</i>, and <i>Demonic Wasabi Colonic</i>. They were all in the running until the
    eleventh hour it seems, each brandishing the palpable sense of (dark) power coursing through them, as well
    as boldly proclaiming grievous bodily harm of a most agonizing sort. All of the vetoed names had their own
    <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, I'll admit. And yet the decided upon title conveyed the sensation succinctly, as
    the vagaries of the ""Miasma"" in the final title somehow qualified this intense listening experience.</p><p>
    
    Back in the winter of 'ought-two, when I first heard this Kevin Drumm disc (he was still into Norwegian death
    metal in those days), a blizzard had just hit the city and snow was flurrying and thick on the ground. It
    was my first time ever through such weather conditions and I was crazy enough to venture out into it for a
    few thrills, with this music strapped to my head. While familiar with Drumm's earlier work, always the aural
    equivalent of a ""Fisherman's Friend"" (be it by prepared guitar or synthesizer), Drumm was blasting the
    sinuses clean and viciously chapping the knuckles with a clarity and enhanced eucalyptus flavor unfelt
    before. The opening glitches were mere forbearer of the whiteout to come. What roar I presumed to be outside
    in the cold was already inside my cavities, and I was well beyond the turning point before even reaching the
    front door.</p><p>
    
    Hitting the pavement, every step was treacherous, uncertain. Thinking the storm already at its apex, it took
    only a minute or two before I realized it was just beginning. The snow was blowing about thick, obscuring
    the eyes, numbing all sense extremities, and making penetrating vision impossible beyond twenty feet. The
    wind was a two-by-four to the face, and it was coming from both left and right channels. I turned it up to
    keep my ears warm, as it had already blown off my earmuffs, and the headphones were suffering, crackling
    under the extreme frequencies.</p><p>
    
    Vast drifts of clean, pure snow were expanding everywhere, and the white noise that flossed through the
    cerebellum made perfect sense, flushing out my stuffiness in a fast-acting manner. Aside from the severe
    nasal drainage (in public no less), there was an underlying nastiness to it all. Drumm, hiding within all
    that white, was not merely packing together some frozen snowballs for further assault, but opening portals
    of treacherous black ice underfoot. Combined with the vociferous gales, it threatened to knock me on my ass
    at any moment. And with the slicks all leading to vast puddles of a most heinous slush, piss-pocked and
    tire-gray, it took all of my balance and willpower to hold steady throughout.</p><p>
    
    The meteorological climate was quickly turning into the frozen-solid core of ""The Inferno"". Nearly a
    twenty-five minute journey to trudge through, I shuddered at the fact that I was barely halfway home,
    and the conditions were only growing more ferocious. All the chained tires on the street spun like reckless
    turntables and cars careened into brick buildings left, right and center. The snowplows were out in full
    force, but they were ungrounded, buzzing and crawling ever closer, crunching rock salt and scraping towards
    me. It was a sound very much like the Approach of the Valkyrie's Vacuum, sucking and forever oncoming with
    this gritty, hairballed roar of eternal Norse vortices. I fell into it about eighteen minutes in, and it
    felt like certain death-metal doom. That's when the dental-drill blizzard of the world around me peaked,
    revealing the <i>Metal Machine Music</i> axe at its black, bloodied valentine heart. All its cold, coiled,
    single-string essence was finally laid bare. I was alive and kicking in its eye, feeling the beautifully
    brutal essence of the storm emanating out of my head. The rush felt like Valhalla, with Vikings hacked into
    steaming chunks on the frozen battlefield. It rocked!</p><p>
    
    It was merely cloudy by the end, and my palpitating heart cooled out a bit, although I could still feel the
    blood jetting through my tweaked extremities. I hadn't been this jacked since a menthol speedball hit the
    streets in '99. Ever since track three of Pita's <i>Get Out</i>, I've been waiting for that feeling again,
    that of a truly brute bruit from the Mego dealers. This, gents and junkies, is it.</p></div>"|2465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2465-sheer-hellish-miasma/|8.5|Andy Beta

    it touches. <i>Creepy Little Noises</i>, the debut album from Portland, Oregon's I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch
    in the House, is not one of them.  This album, and the group as a whole, seem destined to frustrate the few
    expectations they raise-- never a good sign for folks trying to catch a break. From their bandname and record
    title to the eerie cover art, to their proclaimed love of country-rock and the liberal use of the word
    ""bad-ass"" in their press releases, I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House prep you for a trip they never
    take.</p><p>
    
    Things go wrong early: the first track, ""John L. Sullivan"", named for a champion boxer whose autobiography
    the band named themselves after, is nothing more than the lead singer (mysteriously credited as ""The Hamms
    Can Full of Rice"") rasping a brief, disjointed narrative from the titular Sullivan's point of view. Sounding
    like Tom Waits on uppers, the track promises untold weirdness, but once its 35-second runtime has expired,
    ""Graveyard Song"" begins, almost instantaneously flipping the finger to anyone hungering for more oddness.
    The production there, and throughout the rest of the record, is surprisingly bright and full, running wholly
    counter to the twisted Americana aesthetic the band reaches for at the outset. And furthering this incongruity
    is the band's performance: they sound like studio pros with all traces of personality removed. The majority
    of country music's original grit was sucked out long ago; <i>Creepy Little Noises</i> is certainly not the
    record to reverse that unfortunate trend.</p><p>
    
    Finesse and polish, even in country-rock, don't have to be a death sentence, but in this case, they leave
    nothing interesting behind. Despite their instrumental competence, I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House
    write songs like high school students, letting them run on for far too long without introducing new ideas.
    The results are merely tepid on the rockers, but they positively drag on the album's many ballads, where
    the riffs are always played on acoustic guitars with that shriveled open-mic-night rhythm that declared
    itself artistically bankrupt sometime after Ani DiFranco started her own record label.  The rasp of the
    lead singer (whatever his name is), once intriguing, begins to sound like a standard-issue affectation.
    The band's approach eventually bottoms out with ""Walk Across Texas"", at best a fourth-rate version of
    Little Feat's ""Willin'"".  And in addition to intrinsic shortcomings in the ballad department, they fail to
    play the softies off of the rockers effectively, aiming to depict secretly tender tough guys, but instead
    coming across as mopes with occasional bouts of energy.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>Creepy Little Noises</i> is too vanilla to be bad, but its oppressive slickness makes no
    convincing argument in its favor. In fact, the only real loss in skipping this disc is ""Saturday"", which
    arrives halfway through the album. A detail-heavy narrative of a young boy on one of his beloved Saturday
    mornings, the song shines like a beacon surrounded on either side by similar elements that never coalesced
    so well. If I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House choose not to delve deeper into the strangeness they
    flirt with so onanistically, they would do well to mine the vein unearthed on ""Saturday"" until they can
    come up with something better.</p></div>"|4042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4042-creepy-little-noises/|4.6|Brian James

Any ""official"" spirituality seems to translate
    very poorly into the world of pocketable, vaguely symbolic trinkets, but there's something singularly
    hilarious and pitiful about supposedly Christ-haunted license plates, bookends, bumper stickers, sock
    darners, paperweights, ballcaps, candle holders, and breath-candy (with brand names like Testamints, even).
    Christian music, too, is mostly saccharine dreck: the hymns are painfully obvious to the point of being
    meta-songs about how the gathered singers are gathered to sing, the pop/rock stuff is a second-rate
    appropriation of the rote fads of already-stank pop/rock, and many a well-intentioned abomination has been
    born under the auspices of Christian rap.</p><p>
    
    Lately, though, some indie acts who've outed themselves as Christians (among them Damien Jurado, Pedro the
    Lion, Starflyer 59, and Danielson Famile) have done much to mitigate the shame purveyed by Stryper, Creed.
    P.O.D., and Carman (whose ""street"" effort <i>Addicted to Jesus</i>-- referred to by those in the know as
    <i>A2J</i>-- remains a classic work of accidental comedy).  With their friendly connection to the Danielsons
    and their elements of playful showmanship (costumes and cheerleaders), Soul-Junk are uniquely positioned to
    wipe smirks from the faces of those who sincerely doubt Christian rap could ever be interesting. Maybe I
    should distinguish this duo, Galaxalag and Slo-Ro, as ""underground"" Christian rap, fitting for a religion
    whose proponents had to squat in caves back in the day. This intimidatingly prolific crew (<i>1938</i> was
    their first release, and they haven't skipped a number) has honed an unbelievably progressive sound, making
    huge leaps just since their last release, <i>1956</i>, a church-critiquing treatise in the spirit of
    Kierkegaard's <i>Attack Upon Christendom</i>.</p><p>
<i>1957</i>'s sound vacillates between extreme states of density and sparsity (""Horse Posing as Unicorn""
    even concludes with an extended jam that exposes how ramshackle it is beneath its instigative, propulsive
    chant). Some tracks explode with bombastic, digitized, orchestra hits that suggest a soundtrack for a hybrid
    of <i>Ben-Hur</i> and <i>Total Recall</i> directed by Kubrick's resentful ghost.  Other points hint at a
    post-human updating of the more ominous moments in the Silver Apples' oeuvre. Whole tunes are underwritten
    by squiggling modem-barfs, and the uncanny drum patterns simulate popcorn blossoming in a microwave.  Forget
    the Beasties for a moment; this forty-minute wedge of berserk-hop is more deserving of the ""Intergalactic""
    title.</p><p>
    
    At least two cuts offer detached trip-tones; but elsewhere the band is funkless, offering the ingredients of
    dance without the gregarious ease. This disc offers loops of dripping water, moaning horns, spastic hisses
    and pops, and insane harmonica. The album's sheer busyness demands a Daytime Emmy, as it's so ambitiously
    clamorous that it transcends its theological mission to convey a sense of secular apocalypse.</p><p>
    
    These apoplectic white guys sound vital like Destroyer's Dan Bejar, as if they never get in ruts or need
    naps. The lyrics are amazing, but goofy. But amazing. But goofy. Robot voices rap about how we shouldn't
    get mad at dumb machines, and then Galaxalag slurs, ""How can parasites be so entertaining/ Debugged and
    debraining."" This band adds a bizarre religious element to standard hip-hop braggadocio (since they're
    ""down with Christ"") and to hip-hop persecution complexes (since their references to martyrdom have an epic
    significance).</p><p>
    
    If you can handle choruses like, ""It's time to make way for the resurrectionists!"", you're set up to enjoy
    some music-clusters so avant-garde they make Anticon sound Neptune-smooth. Soul-Junk's carnival aesthetic
    suggests a dirty John the Baptist hanging out with flagellants; their tracks are spackled together or strewn
    like Jackson Pollack trying to use Microsoft Paintbrush on a computer built by lobotomized Fraggles. These
    bible-folk conjure an only occasionally wack kaleidoscopic frenzy.</p></div>"|7364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7364-1957/|7.0|William Bowers

    that constitutes an easier target for mockery and disgust than sub-par posthumous material.  Yet, amidst the
    cries of shameless exploitation and legacy defilement, it's easy to lose track of the fact that more material
    is rarely, if ever, a bad thing-- especially from an artist whose lifetime output saw but one complete studio
    album.</p><p>
<i>The Grace EPs</i>, the second archival release by the late Mr Buckley to hit shelves this year, is the
    kind of release most likely to draw criticism from all fans of all degrees.  Collectors will no doubt be
    shitting themselves, as out-of-print and collectible Buckley EPs see re-release here in a repackaged form
    that not only drives down the aura surrounding the originals, but their value as well.  Casual fans will
    surely be miffed at the fact that this box set, which bills itself as ""over two hours of music,"" consists
    of various interpretations of only eleven songs, five of which appeared on <i>Grace</i> in alternate forms.
    And then there are the duplicates: ""Mojo Pin"", ""Grace"" and ""Last Goodbye"" are culled straight from the album
    (two are radio edits), which admittedly is sort of the idea with EPs-- but even the bonus material is
    duplicated once, with a live version of ""Kanga-Roo"" showing up twice in identical form.</p><p>
    So, the statistics aren't promising.  And ""Tongue"", the only track here that has never seen release at all,
    is essentially a studio recording of an instrumental warm-up jam.  But as is usually the case with such
    compilations, those who simply can't get enough of Buckley's tragically narrow repertoire will enjoy having
    it around.</p><p>
<i>The Grace EPs</i> collects five foreign and/or promotional EPs that were released around the same time
    as Buckley's only finished studio album.  These releases, several of which were never intended to be sold
    to the public, showcase Buckley's incredible talent as a live performer.  In fact, the early <i>Live at
    Sin-é</i> EP is as good a point of reference for much of this material as the post-<i>Grace</i> live albums
    <i>Mystery White Boy</i> and <i>Live à l'Olympia</i>.  In fact, the <i>Live from the Bataclan</i> EP, which
    is included here, has a very similar tracklist to the <i>Sin-é</i> EP, with Buckley taking on both ""Je n'En
    Connais Pas le Fin"" and Van Morrison's ""The Way Young Lovers Do"".</p><p>
    Buckley, of course, had quite a talent for cover songs, and that particular strength is well-represented
    here.  His aforementioned rendition of Big Star's ""Kanga-Roo"" (the one that appears twice in unaltered form),
    was included as a live track on <i>Mystery White Boy</i>, but appears for the first time here as a studio
    outtake.  The song shows Buckley tempering the desperate breakdown of the Big Star original with the
    melancholy of his silky voice, and the result is absolutely stunning.  Buckley's cover of Leonard Cohen's
    ""Hallelujah"" appears in several live incarnations here, as well, and the despairing wisdom of Cohen's song
    brings out the most heartbreaking qualities of Buckley's vocals.</p><p>
    And, as is always the case, Buckley's voice is the star.  Buckley effortlessly produces tones that are nothing
    short of divine, completely free of self-conscious showmanship.  When he hits a high note, it doesn't sound
    forced; it sounds liberating.  There's a sense of freedom and directness about Buckley's voice that's
    absolutely intoxicating-- if you listen long enough, you almost begin to feel as if he's singing through
    you.</p><p>
    In spite of its various shortcomings, this is where <i>The Grace EPs</i> succeeds.  Immersion in Buckley's
    music is a powerful thing, and the live tracks and outtakes on <i>The Grace EPs</i> will be of immense value
    to those who are hell-bent on amassing every version of every song Buckley ever performed, and of lesser
    value to those who just can't get enough of his voice.  Whatever your reason, be advised that you're going
    to be dropping $30 for material that was largely designed to hype the release of <i>Grace</i>.  If you
    haven't fallen madly in love with the main course, it probably wouldn't be wise to bother with this
    admittedly overpriced repackaging.</p></div>"|994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/994-the-grace-eps/|6.3|Matt LeMay

    and cigarette-leg trousers, embroiled in a glorious struggle to make life on Earth vastly more enjoyable for
    you and yours.  By the same token, <i>Resuscitation</i>, a reformatted collection of their 12-inch singles,
    isn't so much an ""album"" as it is the soundtrack to an alternately beautiful and hilarious fantasy world,
    one where kids dressed like Central European intelligence agents congregate in dark clubs to bang heads and
    twitch spasmodically until they're utterly, magnificently spent. It's made half of my thoughts about little
    words like ""electro"" and ""punk"" cringe in its great looming shadow; it's made me bounce and shout like a
    ninny more than anything else I've heard in years. My personal enthusiasm for this record knows no bounds,
    and I can only hope that it's mildly contagious.</p><p>
    
    They're from Detroit: Adam Lee Miller, who makes sequencers race and pound, and Nicola Kuperus, whose every
    communication with us is designed to imply convoluted intrigues surrounding it. I wrote last month that they
    ""think they're punks,"" but their records sweep away the concept-- the tracks on <i>Resuscitation</i> function
    as grim, stripped-bare techno, razor-sharp synth-pop, and snarling electro-punk, but most of all they just
    blaze effortlessly away. The drum machines are sharp and propulsive, hissing and spitting while the programming,
    grainy as all get-out, ping-pongs furiously around itself, building and collapsing in a light-speed flurry
    of hooks. (You can dance to it if you have massive amounts of frustrated energy, a strong heart, and enough
    room that you won't accidentally hurt anyone.) Kuperus' vocals, obsessed with communication, miscommunication,
    privacy, and consumption, range from a blank chant to a wounded sing-song, clipped and processed into a
    state that's less robotic than distant and distorted. The overall effect is like listening to a strobe light.</p><p>
    
    All of this makes them sound angry and cold, which they're not: their best tracks walk the same fine line as
    Gary Numan's ""Cars"", offering up both slamming beats and pop hooks perfect for bemused driver's-seat posing.
    It's tempting to think that at least Miller has some metal in his past, because the tone is the same; his
    tightly arranged kicks and slams seem lighthearted, meant for entertainment and less a product of aggression
    than flat-out, amped-up good times.</p><p>
    
    What sets Adult. apart from their peers, aside from the hyperactive blur of their songs, is the amount of
    attention they pay to form and detail: every measure brings new tricks, sprinting programs turning acrobatically
    on dimes, running circles around themselves in perfectly choreographed conversations with the vocals. These
    tracks come across as fierce pop songs that would make just as interesting instrumentals, which, with the
    pasted-together collages of vocal snippets, some of them really are.  And once one can get past <i>Resuscitation</i>'s
    massive dose of <i>Loveless</i> syndrome (e.g. a signature sound unique enough that the tracks run together
    somewhat), it becomes apparent just how flexible the duo's approach is.</p><p>
    
    ""Skinlike"", the collection's most
    beautiful moment, soars like A Flock of Seagulls; ""Nausea"", its most light-hearted, stomps determinedly along
    while Kuperus repeatedly chews up and spits out its title, his posing and preening almost audible. The
    wonderfully misanthropic ""Human Wreck"" reaches heights of buzzing industrial grind-- like The Normal's bleak
    ""Warm Leatherette"" done over as hard techno by agit-prop guerillas-- but the surprisingly wistful ""Contagious""
    has Kuperus singing her sad message over a sunny major-key lilt.  That message runs like this: ""Your signal
    failed-- but I know you're contagious.""</p><p>
    
    It's worth referencing the
    cover art here for Kuperus' photography, which adorns many releases on Adult.'s label, Ersatz Audio. Her
    striking agenda is the creation of scenes that function as stills from non-existent espionage thrillers:
    what convoluted plot climax could have led to the scene we see on <i>Resuscitation</i>'s cover? Her lyrics
    are another grab-bag of high-tech anxieties: in ""Pressure Suit"" it's the smoke from her own flaming boots
    that gives her the privacy to speak, and the hook to ""Hand to Phone"", the smoothest-running single here,
    chants, ""She speaks to you in monotone/ Why can't I come over?"" Elsewhere, it's blank furniture in empty
    rooms, handbags full of money, ""lovesick minors at night,"" and, of course, all that neurotic nausea.</p><p>
    
    It's terrifically conceived and even more terrifically crafted, the sort of record so perfect in its own
    aims that parsing out influences or agendas seems a fool's game. These tracks, this duo, this entity that
    is Adult.: they're a great and interesting thing, this nation's best inducers of head-banging, high-speed
    driving, amazed chuckles, and giddy bedroom shout- and/or pose-alongs. They really are superheroes, I swear
    it-- and when I'm listening to them, the bulk of everything else I've heard since I first heard them seems
    pointless and humorless, uptight and dull in the face of the massive amounts of fun these two seem to be
    having. I encourage you to join us.</p></div>"|55.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/55-resuscitation/|8.7|Nitsuh Abebe

A flag     flapping in the gale sparks an argument between two monks on the nature of things. The first declares     that the flag is surely moving. The flag is still, counters the other, it is the wind that is moving.     Sure enough, where an insoluble paradox appears, the wandering master is not far behind. Which is it,     ask the monks, is the flag moving or is the wind moving? Neither, replies the master; mind is moving.</p><p>Fair enough. Take it, like any wisdom, with a grain of salt, but it springs to mind. Not because Tony     Conrad sees still air and a flapping flag, or because Faust occupy a world of volatile weather, but just     because, for a moment in <em>Outside the Dream Syndicate</em>, one forgets what exactly is moving and what     is standing still.</p><p>Here's what we know: in October 1972, at a hippie commune in Wümme in southwestern Hamburg, a German     art-rock collective bred on the stringent drone and skag-pop of the Velvet Underground hooked up with     the young composer who gave that band its name-- or rather, who handed Lou Reed the sadomasochism exposé     whence the band derived its name. Tony Conrad and the members of Faust collaborated for three days on an     album that would be released the following year in England and would tank immediately thereafter. The     musicians did not communicate or collaborate throughout the following two decades.</p>
<p>Minimalism is unquestionably the wrong word; I prefer asceticism. Anyone familiar with the Zappa-like     hysteria of Faust's first album or the searing kosmische of <em>IV</em> must imagine the sheer force of     self-denial at work in implementing Conrad's vision: to have a deep base note tuned to the tonic on     Conrad's violin and to have the drummer ""tuned"" to a rhythm that corresponded to the vibrations. Minimal     in design, I suppose, but catastrophically huge in execution.</p>
<p>""From the Side of Man and Womankind"" opens in dead motorik, the usually nimble percussive battery of bass     guitarist Jean-Hervé Peron and drummer ""Zappi"" Diermaier, stalled out to a hollow thud-- like the heartbeat     of a machine. Conrad's violin bleats mournfully, endlessly; rising, breathing, sighing, screaming, but     without ceasing: relentless. Faust resisted. Peron's second bass note, inserted against Conrad's wishes,     adds a spring and thrust to the proceedings. Zappi's odd cymbal crash shatters like punctuation in a prayer.     Faust producer Uwe Nettelbeck dulled the serrated violence of Conrad's violin, somehow rendering slow murder     into long caresses. ""The Side of Man and Womankind"" runs like a conveyor belt through fog: going without     moving, advancing, standing still.</p>
<p>""From the Side of the Machine"" is oddly less mechanical than its counterpart. A half-hour in length, like     ""Man and Womankind"", the ""Machine"" side ruminates with muted psychedelia: serpentine bass, ceremonial     percussion, the purr and roar of Rudolf Sosna's humming synthesizer, Conrad's violin passing high above     like an electrical storm in the upper air. There is a predatory quality to the ""Side of the Machine"": an     encircling peril, a certain restlessness above and behind. Mind moves, as if hunted.</p>
<p>The Thirtieth Anniversary Edition of <em>Outside the Dream Syndicate</em> adds a second disc of material. Two     brief tracks-- both named with the young death of former Dream Syndicate comrade Angus Maclise in mind--     offer the remaining fragments of those three days at the abandoned schoolhouse studio at Wümme. Both the     slow burning ""The Pyre of Angus was in Kathmandu"" and the tremulous ""The Death of the Composer Was in 1962""     reveal a looser agenda in the sessions. In the latter piece, Conrad abandons the impassive drone of the     first disc for an almost celebratory psych-rock. The second disc is rounded out by an alternate production     of ""From the Side of Man and Womankind"", lacking the overdubbed violin lines of the album version.</p>
<p>So perhaps a little Zen, perhaps a little cataclysm. After all, as Lou Reed said, ""It's the beginning of the     New Age."" And a few decades before that, a poet ended his long flirtation with Buddhism by joining the Church     of England. In his conversion poem, however, he continued to pray with eastern paradoxes. ""Teach us to care     and not to care,"" T.S. Eliot intoned, ""teach us to sit still."" And this album finally begins to show us how.</p></div>"|1582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1582-outside-the-dream-syndicate/|9.0|Brent S. Sirota

    while walking around Brooklyn on a cold afternoon three weeks ago. This went
    down without my realizing that Metro Area at present call the one-time
    ""Fourth Largest City in America"" home, but I wasn't surprised when I got
    back to Virginia a few days later and picked up the biographical details
    online. Metro Area is two guys, producers Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani,
    who've been working together since the mid-90s. Beginning in 1999, they
    released a string of highly sought-after and limited 12-inch singles on
    their own Environ label. And now we have their first full-length, which
    collects edited versions of six of those 12-inch sides, in addition to new
    material.</p><p>
    Even in my ignorance, with nothing to go on but enthusiastic recommendations
    from a few people I respect, Metro Area seemed the perfect soundtrack to an
    afternoon stroll through the brownstones. This is <em>city</em> music through
    and through; Metro Area's musical history is one of confined spaces, close
    proximity, and mingled breath, a world drawn from and immersed in club
    culture. These sounds have no place on the front porch or in the car deck.</p><p>
    Beginning their musical references around 1977, Metro Area combine heavy
    doses of disco, dollops of funk, a dash of new wave and synth-pop, and then
    remove just about everything but each track's most essential elements. It's
    no surprise that one of the best tracks here, the plucky and P-funkish
    ""Miura"", wound up on Force Tracks' recent <i>Digital Disco</i> compilation
    (well worth checking out, by the way).</p><p>
    Despite the association with some of the microhouse mavens and a shared
    commitment to musical economy, Metro Area carries no theoretical baggage
    aboard this plane. These guys would never allow a glitch to sully their
    pristine productions. They're more interested in the warmth of the picked
    nylon string guitar (on the Latin shuffle ""Piña""), the purity of the flute
    (the almost painfully funky ""Machine Vibes"") and the timeless swell of horns
    (""Orange Alert""). The Kelley Polar String Quartet appears on three tracks,
    imparting rhythmic stabs, romantic swells, and melodramatic sweeps, all
    hallmarks of the disco tradition. The care taken in recording and balancing
    the organic instruments pays off in spades and gives Metro Area an edge over
    the Reaktor and Cubase set. This is beautifully recorded and endlessly
    rhythmic music.</p><p>
    Actually, these tracks sound <i>so</i> nice and draw <i>so</i> masterfully from
    a variety of dance music traditions that I can't help but wish Metro Area would
    incorporate some vocals into the mix. It's not that the tracks don't work well
    on their own-- you can certainly absorb all the delicious space and admire the
    rhythmic interplay better this way-- but some of these chord productions and
    beats are just too pop to leave the voice out entirely.  It's almost scary to
    think how good they could be in that context. It's not hard to imagine a couple
    of these six-minute plus tracks, which drag just a tad by the end as they repeat
    themselves (forgivable when you consider many were created with DJs in mind),
    seeming too short with a few verses added. Still, though I dream about Metro
    Area paying homage to disco's vocal pop history, I really have very little to
    complain about. First rate.</p></div>"|5252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5252-metro-area/|7.8|Mark Richardson

Paul McCartney wrote ""Freedom"", and Neil Young
    penned ""Let's Roll"". Bruce Springsteen even erected a long-playing monument to the victims of September 11th.
    Yet still, the pain lingers on, prompting the question: has anyone tried making a pro-wrestling-themed
    hardcore album? The answer, thanks to Gorilla Monsoon, is now a resounding, ""<i>Hell</i> yeah!""</p><p>
    
    Festering in Brooklyn like some disease that should have been wiped out in the nineteenth century, Gorilla
    Monsoon is one of the more unusual bands making music today.  Named for the late president of the World
    Wrestling Federation, their eponymous debut is dedicated to exploring the many facets of the pro-wrestling
    world in more idyllic, less terror-ridden times. In those halcyon days, the WWF had no upstart and Osama
    bin Laden-like competitors, and Hulk Hogan's ongoing feud with Andre the Giant was as unambiguous a
    representation of good-versus-evil as America and France.</p><p>
    
    So what, you may ask, does Gorilla Monsoon have to say on this subject? Let's begin with song titles: ""20
    Foot Snake &amp; 20 Inch Mullet (J.S. Roberts)"", ""Thank God Donald Trump's a Hulk-a-Maniac!"", and ""Somebody in
    This Room Punched King Kong Bundy in the Arm"". Unfortunately, for all the gargantuan promise contained
    therein, they provide precious little insight into the wondrous subtleties of the WWF. The lyrics, only
    featured on the surefire classic ""R. Piper vs. J. Snuka"", consist solely of muddled shouts in the background
    which sound like nothing more than the names of the titular combatants.</p><p>
    
    Now, a largely instrumental album
    about wrestling could still be a wonderful thing-- a soundtrack to the drama of Hulk Hogan miraculously
    recovering from a near-coma to whomp his opponent, perhaps-- but here, too, Gorilla Monsoon falls short of
    their lofty goal. Quite simply, the music on <i>Gorilla Monsoon</i> is unredeemed. It will not, I dare say,
    do for the WWF what Miles Davis' <i>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</i> did for boxing (i.e., avoid making it
    look like the stop-motion devolution it is).  This album captures not so much the experience of wrestling
    as laying on the couch in your pajamas <i>watching</i> wrestling for so long that you begin to feel sick
    and lose the will to go on living. If this is your bag, then this, and perhaps no other record, will do.</p><p>
    
    The members of Gorilla Monsoon may be funny in real life-- their song titles are at least circumstantial
    evidence of this-- but the fact that no personality, charm, wit, or... <i>anything</i> that could be called
    real music with a straight face was captured on this disc is enough to make you wish recording equipment
    weren't so easy to come by. Maybe, like <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> and <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, it works
    fantastically well played over ""Monday Night RAW"".  That's a stretch, of course, but in order to be
    appreciated on any level, Gorilla Monsoon requires stretching; about as much as childbirth, or at least
    fisting.</p></div>"|3523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3523-gorilla-monsoon/|2.3|Brian James

    to admit.  All the second-hand conversation, radio static and traffic roar should amount to almost nothing
    in the grand scheme of existence, but over the course of a lifetime, it adds up to the lion share of the
    sounds I hear.  This won't be news to any marketer, of course, as age-old strategies of subliminal messaging
    via media have been wreaking havoc on my sensibilities for years.  However, subversive noise isn't always
    such a bad (or at least annoying) thing.  Some musicians have found ways of manipulating their signals to
    suit our inner cravings in ways both clever and strange.  Think of the churning earth-rumble of Boredoms;
    My Bloody Valentine's wall of distorted bliss; go back even to Coltrane's sheets of sound.</p><p>
    
    Black Dice's latest release taps into the notion of alluring noise, if not quite as beautifully as did
    their most recent full-length, <i>Beaches and Canyons</i>.  Before this year, the Brooklyn-based band had
    earned a reputation for very short, wildly abrasive live shows reminiscent of the intentionally off-putting
    commotion of Merzbow or early Swans.  Their debut full-length (2000's self-titled) was a document of just
    how far hardcore had come (not far?  too far?) since 1982, but it also examined how disturbing the
    <i>dissection</i> of hardcore might be, the band spitting out shards of it into explosive, 30-second shells.
    <i>Beaches and Canyons</i> was the result of two years' gradual transition into a much more subtle (if not
    nearly so intense) beast, and <i>Lost Valley</i> is a minor reflection on that change.</p><p>
    
    The title track begins with distant, percolating percussion and soon adds high-pitched bongos with mild,
    simmering guitar beneath the layer of drums.  My first thought was that this is supposed to sound ""primal"",
    yet Black Dice actually end up sounding a lot more like moderns on a communal bent.  The band uses the
    familiar elements of caveman trance to evoke images not of the Stone Age, but of sterile, apocalyptic
    landscapes and metallic ruins.  Their use of electronics later in the piece contributes to this feeling,
    but the most telling ingredient is their stubborn refusal to ever settle into an easy groove.  Even when
    the beat becomes steadier, spikes still jut outward, placing this music firmly outside the easy pigeonhole
    of your everyday psychedelic jungle music.  The song becomes progressively detached from drum-circle fare
    as blips and screams take over near the end, only to stop on a fizzle of synth.</p><p>
    
    ""Head Like a Door"" begins with a held unison note that sounds suspiciously like some of Gyorgy Ligeti's
    choral music used in <i>2001</i>-- intentional or not, it certainly adds a touch of tension and suspense to the
    drone, yet again suggesting that Black Dice aren't in this for tuning in and turning out.  Nevertheless,
    the blast of feedback and cymbals just over four minutes in is just disorientating enough to remind me
    where these guys came from.  In some ways, it seems a waste to use such a promising drone only to destroy
    it so hastily, but then I'm sure fluffing my groove pillows wasn't the order of the session.</p><p>
    
    This mini-CD isn't essential, but is (alongside <i>Beaches and Canyons</i>) yet another example of how easily
    noise is transformed into ear candy.  Maybe it shouldn't be surprising to hear would-be no-wave bands
    becoming would-be no-trance bands-- even Merzbow plays laptop gigs-- but it is refreshing to see it produce
    such interesting results.  Hit the full-lengths on either side of this first, and then come back to <i>Lost
    Valley</i> for an epilogue.</p></div>"|745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/745-lost-valley-ep/|7.0|Dominique Leone

What makes this inconvenient,
    for the purposes of critique, is that he's Norwegian.  But c'mon, can you really blame me for making the
    mistake?  Check out the vowel-ending name (no ø's in sight), the slightly rumpled fashion awareness on the
    album cover, and above all, the serious Serge Gainsbourg influence on Lerche's music.  I plead clueless
    Americanism; wasn't pretty much all of Europe supposed to be culturally homogenous by now?</p><p>
    Having spent a little time in the linguistically hostile and hyper self-esteemed city of Paris, I pick up a
    vibe from Lerche that seems French, if only in attitude.  Just as Parisians seem to have an almost effortless
    sophistication and stylishness to their clothing and behavior, Lerche projects a deep nonchalance in his
    nevertheless enjoyable music-- it might be the most laidback album of lush pop I've ever heard.  Rather
    than pulling you in with sharp, insistent hooks, Lerche's songs spool out drowsily over four or five
    minutes, not so much sticking in your head as massaging it.</p><p>
    This mature approach to songwriting is even more striking given that Lerche was a mere 19 years old when
    this album came out, which I guess makes him the Norwegian Conor Oberst.  Much of the musical inspiration
    here appears to be drawn from the decades before Lerche's birth: lounge strings and distant female ""do
    doo's"" with reverb; the jazz phrasing of ""Modern Nature"", the Charlie Brown Christmas carol piano of
    ""Virtue and Wine"".  The only contemporary artists he falls in line with are similarly retro-focused
    characters: ""tropicalia""-style Beck, Stereolab's arched-eyebrow space-age material, or, more obviously,
    the soft-folk of fellow Astralwerks Norwegians, Kings of Convenience.</p><p>
    The drawback of this laundry list is that <i>Faces Down</i> is too often predictable in its dreamy
    arrangements, containing few surprises to separate Lerche from the legions of gents with a predilection
    for chamber-pop. Strident choruses in ""Virtue and Wine"" and ""No One's Gonna Come"" cut through the haze
    nicely, but extended attempts to turn uptempo (""All Luck Ran Out"") fall flat.  Lerche's nonchalance also
    tends to drag songs out longer than necessary: ""On and Off Again"" could stop right at the 3:30 mark,
    before the theremin-accented freakout, and remain just as good if not stronger, while ""Things You Call
    Fate"" needlessly cycles a repetitive jam past the nine-minute mark.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, <i>Faces Down</i> will likely please anyone who's into this kind of EZ-indie, as Lechre
    proves adept at orchestrating large-ensemble set pieces like ""Dead Passengers"", conversational duets like
    ""Modern Nature"", or solo croons like ""Side Two"".  Lerche's slightly Beck tone (sprinkled with a hefty dose
    of Bowie) allows me to file this record next to the similarly imitative Schneider TM, as another 2002 album
    I wish the actual Beck had made instead of that bland Jackson Browne woe, <i>Sea Change</i>.  Both
    singer/songwriters like to look at themselves in the mirror and pretend they're the reincarnation of
    preeminent French scamp Gainsbourg, but in 2002, only Lerche is pulling it off.</p></div>"|4743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4743-faces-down/|7.4|Rob Mitchum

    to look wonderful under any fan's tree-- a niche gift equivalent to <i>The Beer Drinker's Bible</i>, <i>The
    Soprano Family Cookbook</i> or <i>The Big Fucking Book of 'Vettes</i>.  I remember the time Santa brought
    me <i>The Aeroplane Flies High</i>, a mixed bag of a- and b-sides lovingly packaged in a cool black-and-white
    spiral box with a dinky plastic handle.  It was so neat!  And they've hooked me again, with nothing more
    than the first official release of some cobbled-together live material from 1994: <i>Earphoria</i>, the
    soundtrack to the reissued VHS, <i>Vieuphoria</i> (now, of course, on DVD).</p><p>
<i>Vieuphoria</i> came out in '94, one year after the multi-platinum <i>Siamese Dream</i> made the band an
    international household name.  As grunge detonated across airwaves, and we began to see early signs of
    emulation as every possible ""next Nirvana"" was flung into heavy rotation, the Smashing Pumpkins became one
    of the only alternative rock bands that could claim to have their own unique ""look"": the near-narcoleptic
    James Iha on guitar, blonde, heavily face-powdered bassist D'Arcy, and midwestern everyguy Jimmy Chamberlin
    on drums, all serving the complete domination of psychedelic Billy, an album-rocker-at-heart decorated with
    skin-tight, grotesque-patterned shirts boasting earthtone rainbows, paisley brigades, and countless other
    designs adorned only by acid-trippers and Florida from ""Good Times"".</p><p>
    
    Acting as a kind of victory lap/souvenir, <i>Vieuphoria</i> is packed with cheaply produced interludes and
    home videos-- hilariously indulgent stuff, like a clip of D'Arcy having tea with her stuffed animals.  But
    the main attraction is the live footage from concerts and television broadcasts, featuring material from
    <i>Gish</i>, <i>Siamese Dream</i>, and the <i>Lull</i> EP.  (The video predates their bloated sub-masterpiece
    <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i>.)  <i>Vieuphoria</i> was released on home video, but <i>Earphoria</i>
    was just a limited-pressing promotional CD sent to record stores.  Repeatedly bootlegged and often auctioned
    at ridiculous prices, it now finally sees wide release.</p><p>
<i>Earphoria</i> runs through several hits from <i>Siamese Dream</i>, with some major reinterpretations.
    ""Disarm"" loses the acoustic strumming and bells that made it the most overplayed single of '93; the more
    interesting and brutal version here has lurching guitars and drums, and Corgan wrenches the vocals out with
    pliers.  The disc also includes two unplugged tracks: the simple performance of ""Mayonaise"" is refreshing
    after the syrupy-sweet excess of the original, but more surprising, the band's grunge-anthem, ""Cherub Rock"",
    sounds lean and invigorated with acoustic guitars and Chamberlin's fast brushwork.</p><p>
    
    Even playing it straight, Corgan and Iha had to convert the thick, enveloping sound of the album into two
    keyed-up guitars.  The results are more manic, like the fast and urgent ""Quiet"", and a triumphant recording
    of ""Today"" played for a hometown crowd in Chicago.  But it's the older, <i>Gish</i>-era ""I Am One"" and
    ""Slunk"" that become wiry spasms of power chords: these are easily the album's highlights and some of the
    nastiest rock the Pumpkins turned out.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, the on-stage frenzy diminishes two of their headphone classics.  The original versions of
    ""Geek U.S.A."" and ""Silverfuck"" had bold transitions, molten slowdowns and giant, prog rock-like crescendos.
    In concert, ""Geek U.S.A."" loses much of its subtlety: they all but blow through the quiet parts.  The
    extended thirteen-minute ""Silverfuck"" starts strong, and the dead-quiet ""bang bang you're dead/ Hole in your
    head"" verse (admittedly one of the worst moments on the otherwise still-fantastic <i>Siamese Dream</i>)
    provokes a gruesome little singalong with the audience.  Ah, those wacky slackers.  But Corgan hams it up
    by singing a few lines of ""Over the Rainbow""-- either because of licensing or good taste, that part is cut
    from the DVD-- and then tacks on a short jam that only merits a shrug as a home listening experience.  You
    can't see that Iha's playing his guitar with a toy laser pistol, and you can't watch as Corgan sheepishly
    smashes his guitar and rips up the drum kit.  Not that all this excuses anything.</p><p>
<i>Earphoria</i> also tacks on twenty minutes of ephemera and interlude music from the movie.  ""Why Am I So
    Tired?"" is a fifteen-minute casual studio jam originally played over the end credits; ""Pulseczar"" is a
    buzzing fragment of psychedelia, and there are a few electronic curiosities, like the e-bow guitar snippet
    ""Sinfony"", or the blossoming ""yeah yeah yeah yeah's"" on ""French Movie Theme"".  This, of course, is just
    garnish around the live tracks, but like I said, this is a fan release and nothing's too trivial.  Hey, did
    you know that ""Bugg Superstar"" is about James Iha's dog?</p><p>
    
    A few great live tracks aside, I wouldn't recommend this to a new or casual Pumpkins listener.  For fans,
    the only suggestion I'd make is that if you spend as much time near a TV as you do with your stereo, just
    skip this disc and get <i>Vieuphoria</i> (you already burned this from Napster in '99, anyway).  Dig the
    early concert clips with Corgan's hippie hair and Chamberlin's sweaty-ass mullet!  Laugh at the thinly
    veiled hostility that wracks the band!  The crew even caught the entire ten minutes that Iha and D'Arcy
    spent in the studio for <i>Siamese Dream</i>!  And the between-song interviews are total gravy-- for
    example, Billy Corgan on fame: ""People are always like, 'What's it like to be famous?'  And when I think
    of 'famous,' I think of people who, like, kill people.""  Rock on, Corgan!  Stick that in your stocking!</p></div>"|7263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7263-earphoria/|6.3|Chris Dahlen

After all, it's relatively universal, and unlike     other social and political topics (or even atrocities), the forcefulness and violence of impending technology     isn't something we have the luxury of ignoring. MIMEO's specific intent is the integration of acoustic and     digital music, not necessarily as a comfortable cohesion, but more in hopes of defining a collective fixedly     engaged in musical dialogue. Examples range from a 24-hour length performance given last year, to     <em>Electric Chair + Table</em>, a double-disc recording of improvisations with the final say on each disc     given to Rafael Toral and Marcus Schmickler, respectively.</p><p><em>The Hands of Caravaggio</em> is the sound of thirteen incredibly adept and inspired musicians thinking     about the speed, memory, and ready accessibility of technology, and its application. It would be a tragedy     to reduce this album to a simple 49-minute exercise in academic rhetoric-- there was clearly so much     thought given to issues like digital interchange, the art of Caravaggio, and the concerto form that I'm     conflicted whether or not to discuss the more theoretical side at all, or just ignore it in favor of the     absolutely glorious, usurping clamor the group are capable of producing.</p><p>Composed by AMM founding member Keith Rowe-- a man with three decades of constantly challenging and deeply     thoughtful music-- <em>The Hands of Caravaggio</em> is a graphic score based on a recently rediscovered     Caravaggio painting. To Rowe, the painting seems to embody the spontaneous but deliberate gestures that     have preoccupied him for most of his career. Further connections are more or less left up to the listener,     but there is no doubt that a central ingredient of constantly shifting, careful progress is responsible for     a recording of such enormous, dynamic approach.</p>
<p>The proceedings are carried out by a group of musicians already noted for their forward-thinking work in     electronic music. The list is extensive.  Kevin Drumm (replacing usual member Christian Fennesz), whose     approach is in some ways similar to Rowe's, uses an electric guitar as a transducer more than as a musical     instrument. In recent years, he's opted to use a computer to transform that massive sense of electrical     energy into an audible form. Pita, whose work on the Mego label displays an obsessive degree of aural     annihilation, where familiar, tangible concrete and instrumental sounds are compressed and expanded into     shards of digital noise with its original source looming translucently in the background, is also a member.     These names, of course, are no more or less valuable to the recording than Kaffe Matthews, Thomas Lehn, Cor     Fuhler, Marcus Schmickler, Gert-Jan Prins, Phil Durrant, Marcus Wettstein, and Jerome Noetinger, all of whom     have certainly paid their dues as electro-acoustic musicians, and many of which have particularly definitive     work on the Erstwhile label responsible for this MIMEO release.</p>
<p>Erstwhile's modus operandi is the bringing together of first-rate improvisers that don't normally associate     with one another, and on <em>The Hands of Caravaggio</em>, MIMEO is teamed with another third of AMM, pianist     John Tilbury. Tilbury is the sole acoustic instrumentalist on the recording, cementing the theoretical     approach: exploring the piano concerto form. The instrument maintains a ruling clarity throughout, though     at times its pitches and preparations can only be found in what Tilbury aptly describes as ""the nooks and     crannies in which their unique resonances find subtle expression."" Rowe and Tilbury are particularly     clear-headed on what they hope <em>The Hands of Caravaggio</em> will achieve. Cor Fuhler is used as a foil     to Tilbury's immense talent, simultaneously playing the inside of the same piano that Tilbury is attempting     to twist sounds from. The digital sounds of the massive ensemble meet the acoustic piano before it has a     chance to get out of the gate.</p>
<p><em>The Hands of Caravaggio</em> is a prickly recording; where a piano concerto used to be an example of human     virtuosity, we now see disrupted ideas, doubt, and mechanization in Golem-like velocity. It brims with     freshness and the fleeting beauty improvised music rarely achieves, and proudly wears the contributors'     reputations on its sleeve.</p>

He was playing in a trio with guitarist Joe Morris and, more notably, his father Joe Maneri, the     great saxophonist and devout free improviser. They played an abstract, completely improvised set, with     lines that could rise to flurries or insinuate themselves as lightly as paper cuts. It was an engrossing     and, on the father-son side of the trio, intimate performance: even the Van Halen on the jukebox next door     couldn't break the audience's total concentration.</p>
<p>Maneri's father may be his biggest influence. Both men explore a microtonal scale that Joe invented, which     takes the twelve notes of the regular octave and slivers them into seventy-two. For the listener, this means     the two musicians veer into nuances of pitch but hit them with a mapmaker's precision: the subtleties are     decisive and codified. This makes the music demandingly cerebral; but a more important trait they share--     and the one that makes their music more engrossing than academic-- is the absolute passion that guides     their technique. In his father's case, it's the boisterous tone that burbles through his saxophone and     clarinet; for Mat, it's an intensity that can be searing. He plays with the deliberateness of a cigarette     burning itself out.</p>
<p>Maneri had already appeared on some of the finest European art music labels-- ECM, Leo, and HatHut-- when     he released <i>Blue Decco</i> for the Thirsty Ear Blue Series. That release put him on the tiny roster of     America's most vital jazz imprint, and it was also his most accessible album to date, a joyful, trad-sounding     jazz album that kicked off with a swinging rendition of ""Hush Little Baby"", before closing with a cover of     Duke Ellington's ""I Got It Bad"", where Maneri pulled his notes so beautifully thin, he almost bled them dry.</p>
<p>Two years later he's released his second disc on the Blue Series, and it takes a far different approach. For     <i>Sustain</i>, he wrote abstract compositions so stretched out and/or skeletal that they almost sound     formless. As on <i>Blue Decco</i>, Maneri works with a quartet that includes some of downtown New York's     finest: Gerald Cleaver on drums, Craig Taborn on keyboards, and William Parker on bass. On soprano sax, he     adds featured guest Joe McPhee, the avant-jazz legend whose career is so crucial that the HatHut label was     founded specifically to document his work. This is a stellar group of improvisers, but where <i>Blue Decco</i> hewed close to traditional jazz forms, <i>Sustain</i> emphasizes seamless group interplay: the band makes     slow but unyielding progress, and each track smolders.</p>
<p>""Sustain"" and ""In Peace"" float like clouds, while ""Divine"" moves in drawn-out shudders. Taborn mainly sticks     to keyboards, and instead of adding blunt synth washes, he comps in subtle colors (as well as his patented     deep-sea sonar pings). He melds with Maneri's electric viola, and as soloists, both men drift in and out of     the spotlight: McPhee, more freewheeling, steps up assertively but doesn't disrupt the backdrop. The rhythm     section only implies the beat, as Cleaver and Parker confidently circle the edges of the music.</p>
<p>But then there's ""Nerve"", which resembles Miles Davis' electric fusion.  Not so much fast as blaring, it     features Maneri and Taborn jamming with heavy distortion; Maneri employs what might be a wah-wah pedal to     make his viola sound like a guitar. McPhee plays a funky solo through the clamor, and with Cleaver and     Parker crashing inwards, the piece bottlenecks like a slow car crash.</p>
<p>Maneri separates the group tracks with five solo pieces (one per musician) that emphasize the raw sounds     of each instrument. These blend into the program surprisingly well: the Maneri solo that opens the disc is     engrossingly slow; Cleaver's, the most hypnotic, sounds like he's dragging a chain around his cymbal.     McPhee falls short of playing actual notes, instead honing us in on the sound of his breath in his     mouthpiece. Taborn's piano solo is more conventional but he lays on the sustain pedals to keep the notes     hanging around him, and Parker plays an arco solo where his bowing is so deep it acquires physical girth,     though his whistling overtones could etch glass.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that capturing improvisation like this in the studio is difficult, and although none     of Maneri's discs has been less than solid, his two releases on the Blue Series stand out as the tightest,     most exciting, and most accessible. Of course, his recordings with his dad are also essential-- their     duo Blessed on ECM is a great Father's Day gift for dads who dig free improv-- but the Blue Series deserves     credit for releasing the definitive documents of a rising talent.</p></div>"|5068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5068-sustain/|8.4|Chris Dahlen

And     yes, for what it's worth, Anderson sounds a little like a sober version of the Captain; Wolf Colonel also     tends to cop the lo-res aesthetic of early GBV when they don't have any better ideas (which is often).     Unfortunately, they both get panned for not sounding as earthshaking as one of the greatest independent     rock acts of all time.  It's enough to reduce more beneficent, egalitarian folks to tears.</p><p>Because, you know, ""It's all just indie rock!"" as Anderson yelps with a despicably self-referential wink     on ""Jet Ski Accidents.""  Apparently, that's supposed to excuse an album's worth of knowingly awkward,     slightly offbeat chord progressions, lyrics that practically wet their pants to be described as ""quirky"",     and some of the grainiest bedroom recording that money can't buy.  Screw holding <em>Something/Everything</em> up to the GBV measuring stick-- it can barely justify its own tired sound. The market on this brand of     noise was cornered by its giants years ago, and to break in, it's going to take something truly special.     Without staggering invention, craftsmanship, or anything particularly unique to it at all,     <em>Something/Everything</em> is a lot more like a simpleminded retrospective of the ""indie sound"" and a lot     less like an album to jockey for a position with dinner and a movie (and maybe an invitation back to your     place).</p><p>It isn't like this is an aural gum scraping; it's more of a painful duty, and sometimes it's not even that     painful. Quality songwriting doesn't necessarily need to break any molds, and <em>Something/Everything</em> can     occasionally make its presence felt with even-handed simplicity, as on ""Astronaut, Astronaut"" or the     delightful, shaky cacophony of ""Break the News"". The synthetic, beat-driven ""Citizen's Arrest"" bears     mention, simply because in context, it sounds genuine and original (the rhythms provoke some comparison     to Radiohead's ""Idioteque"", but even on a bad day, that's a good thing). In fact, the sugary drone of     ""Citizen's Arrest"" is one of the album's finest moments, and there even are some close runners-up.</p>
<p>However, once (and only once) does Wolf Colonel really transcend the limitations of this sound, and that     ""once"" comes with ""The Sophomore"". As one sterling counterpoint to refute anyone who claims there's no     possibility of expanding lo-fidelity sound, ""The Sophomore"" makes a joke of most everything Wolf Colonel     has done to date. It positively thunders from the speakers, rising to a towering, epic crescendo of hissing     guitar and soaring choruses. It brilliantly illustrates the simultaneous intimacy and fuzzy grandeur that     made this sound so classic.  Why is the rest of <em>Something/Everything</em> content to remain average with     this kind of potential going largely unrealized?</p>
<p>The fruits of this stale guitar/drums formula are dubious, as is Anderson's forced lyrical quaintness and     his best attempt at Pollard's raspy delivery.  Yet, although it houses some enjoyable moments and one brush     with greatness, the majority of <em>Something/Everything</em> is simply decent, unremarkable music coupled with     god-awful lyrics. To wit: ""The moon was up there/ Just hangin' in the sky/ Floating pretty high/ No one     quite knows why/ I let out a sigh."" Me too, Jason.  Me too.</p>

    Hi-Tek for his upcoming release in favor of a more commercially viable roster of producers, you could
    almost hear a collective sigh rise up from the hip-hop community.  Tek's quirky, jazz-informed productions
    provided an ideal sound platform for Talib's literate meditations on growing up in a marginalized culture.
    Underground classics like ""2000 Seasons"", ""Fortified Live"", and ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" radiated an
    emotionally immediacy and political awareness that was largely absent from mid-to-late-90s hip-hop.  While
    Talib's new beatmakers (which include Kayne West and DJ Quik) are amongst the hottest and most creatively
    viable in the game, the fear was that their slicker and generally more aggressive styles would somehow
    taint the honesty and intimacy that has been key to Talib's success.</p><p>
    While <i>Quality</i> may lack the basement charms of Tek's finest, it more than compensates by employing a
    funkier and more upbeat sound palate to further draw out the nuances of what is already one of the most
    rounded and complete rap personas in the game.  What makes this record one of the best hip-hop albums of
    the year is its combination of maturity and joy, two emotions the genre rarely explores, much less
    simultaneously. Although these qualities have been evident in all of Talib's work, the infusion of new
    blood (particularly that of Kayne West) accentuates and revitalizes the message.  Whether expressing the
    bliss of childbirth with Mos Def on ""Joy"" or stating the simple pleasures of everyday life on ""Shock Body"",
    Talib has got ""rhymes so bright that the sunshine beams through it.""</p><p>
    Even Talib's elation here strikes as sophisticated, distinguishing itself from the materialistic acquisitions,
    drug binges and sexual conquests that pass for contentment on many hip-hop albums, with a spiritual center
    attained through an on-record intellectual honesty and emotional transparency that's still rare in a culture
    that feeds off inflated stereotypes of machismo posturing and stands on the political platform of fatalism
    and resignation.  In fact, Kweli's unabashed positivity and emotional vulnerability feel almost transgressive
    to these ears.  Even when he confronts the ills of society, as he does on the wrenching ""Where Do We Go"" and
    ""Stand to the Side"", there's a certain optimism and belief that by illuminating the darkness through hip-hop,
    we can hope to transcend the pain.</p><p>
    ""I wanna write a way/ I want it right here/ I want to write brave words to fight fear.../ My words apply the
    pressure to make the bleeding stop,"" Talib raps on ""Stand to the Side"". Cynics may label social-change-via-music
    as a naïve proposition and focus solely on the music's form rather than its content, privileging MC's with
    buttery flows but with nothing to say.  I still believe in the power of hip-hop music and culture to affect
    social change, and the genre's new generation has no greater prophet than Talib.</p></div>"|4549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4549-quality/|9.1|Sam Chennault

    run through six songs in fourteen minutes on <i>Peotone</i>, their debut EP.  This is about ten minutes too
    many; though they mix things up a bit with the addition of saxophone and the absence of a bassist, the
    Afflictions bring on board the same strengths and weaknesses of most garage acts. Their high energy and
    simplicity make them easy to absorb and enjoy, but also bring them to the brink of monotony. The eternal
    struggle continues-- how do you keep rock and roll basic without it becoming boring?</p><p>
    Over the course of <i>Peotone</i>, The Afflictions bounce between ideas, between success and failure, and
    the direction they choose to pursue in the future will likely make or break the group. They're blessed with
    a strong frontman in Jeremiah McIntyre, and a knack for coming up with agreeable hooks, but the presentation
    here undercuts more than a few good moments. It's a low-fidelity affair, and though I imagine the band is
    dedicated to this aesthetic, their songwriting style leads to cluttered compositions, a problem only
    exacerbated by muddy sound.</p><p>
    At the risk of making a wildly misleading comparison, The Afflictions, like Sly and the Family Stone during
    the <i>Whole New Thing</i> era, are trying to pack in as much exciting material as possible without recognizing
    the point of negative returns.  And another stumbling block: the band have difficulty embracing their music
    wholeheartedly, instead hiding behind ironic detachment in an effort to ensure that the audience knows they're
    more intelligent than their naïve predecessors. Dumb/funny song titles like ""You're Nice to Look At"" and
    ""Let's Make a Mess"" provide a couple of good chuckles, but overall leave the disconcerting impression that
    the music they're making is deeply inauthentic, or at least conflicted.</p><p>
    However, the two best songs on <i>Peotone</i> suggest that The Afflictions are capable of becoming an
    impressive band. Sequenced fourth and fifth respectively, ""Janet Style"" and ""Am I Dreaming or Am I Dead""
    pare down the sound to the essentials, and easily outperform their peers.  With a clearer sense of purpose,
    these two cuts prove the band doesn't need to reach quite so far to maintain a high level of excitement,
    especially since their tunes tend to clock in well under three minutes. If they want to stand out from the
    many other bands shooting for similar targets-- and they very well could-- they should build upon this
    pair's strengths instead of meandering toward the realms of the snarky intellectual interlopers poisoning
    the very music the band's trying to play.</p></div>"|68.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/68-peotone-ep/|6.5|Brian James

After another boring day spent rifling through
    corporate America's filing cabinets for wages, I emerged into 28-degree half light, shivered my way to my
    ice-encrusted automobile, and headed home exhausted. When I got there, Noise for Pretend were waiting for
    me. They stuck a martini in my hand, tossed a lei around my neck, and gave me a much-needed break from the
    cold and conformity that's surrounded my life for the past couple of weeks.</p><p>
    From the moment it touches down-- the streamlined pop noir of ""The Song Formerly Known as Whatever We Used
    to Call It""-- Noise for Pretend's grammatically challenged debut album is as refreshing as limon Jarritos
    over ice. Sonically, it's about the equivalent of a spy film set in Trinidad, falling between Cancer and
    Capricorn, but with a healthy, tempering dose of style and cool.</p><p>
    The trio has many weapons, but their most devastating is lead vocalist Esperanza Spalding, who also does
    time in Hush label head Chad Crouch's Blanket Music project, and plucks a mean double bass. She often sings
    with a trip-hop detachment that belies the richness of her voice, but either way you slice it, she's got
    quite a set of pipes (and reportedly, she's only 17).  Nearly as essential to the band's sound: Ben Workman's
    guitar work, which is uniformly exquisite. His electric drips with reverb, recalling the off-handed freedom
    of The Verve's Nick McCabe, while his acoustic playing is full of Spanish flourishes and precise strumming.</p><p>
    Not to be forgotten is drummer Christian Cochran, whose playing rarely resorts to beats taken from books,
    and often has a seductive sway to it, such as on the undulating ""Pants with His Halfway Down"", a Latin slink
    Mancini would probably find to his liking. He deconstructs the beat on ""Most Red Wagons Aren't Very Long"" to
    the point of negation, but it never bogs the song down. In general, the band coalesces incredibly for one
    so young, and recently formed.</p><p>
    Rarely is this better evidenced than on the swaying Latin spy waltz ""Due to Lamplooking"". Spalding's bass
    lies down a jazzy ostinato the other members immediately latch onto, but it's the seamless transition into
    a funky bridge and back again that's most impressive; Noise for Pretend fashion 3\xBD minutes into something
    of a miniature epic. They follow it with ""Go Figure, Another Warm Day in Paradise"" (hands down my favorite
    song title of the year), which rides a simple beat straight at you, with some subtle, catchy guitar work
    from Workman.</p><p>
    All told, <i>Happy You Near</i> is an estimable debut that should put Noise for Pretend on the map-- probably
    just east of Cuba.  At the very least, it's a great big warm spot in my temporarily cold world; I'll be
    thinking of them while I trim the goatee of icicles from my Toyota's front license plate before work
    tomorrow.</p></div>"|5826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5826-happy-you-near/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    century hard rock scene.  Boasting a catalog replete with talents like Coalesce, Soilent Green, Converge,
    and Neurosis, Hydra Head has helped cultivate a slew of formidable acts at a fever pitch, only to see the
    cream of its crop lured away by the substantially larger bankrolls of major labels.  Yet, while Hydra Head's
    roster runs the gamut from prog to metal, few members of their talented stable have exhibited the sonic
    versatility of their most recent defection, Cave In.</p><p>
    Prior to departing for the cushy confines of RCA, Cave In dropped a six-track swan song EP entitled <i>Tides
    of Tomorrow</i>, completing one of the most dramatic genre shifts in modern rock since Radiohead reinvented
    themselves with <i>Kid A</i>.   Laying its noise-core roots from 1998's <i>Beyond Hypothermia</i> and 1999's
    <i>Until Your Heart Stops</i> threadbare, and softening the space-rock soundscapes of their critically
    acclaimed <i>Jupiter</i> LP, Cave In have chosen a more radio-friendly approach, reminiscent of ambitious
    indie rockers like Failure, Hum, and Juno.  Combining shades of emo, alt-rock, and pop with intelligent
    songwriting, Cave In is clearly on the verge of major mainstream success, the kind of popularity thus far
    alien to the Hydra Head roster.</p><p>
    In all honesty, most of these songs could easily wind up on your local KROQ clone's playlist, up against
    the likes of Audioslave, Lifehouse, and Puddle of Mudd; with the catchiness of these riffs, the innocuousness
    of Stephen Brodsky's vocals, and track lengths averaging five minutes, there's nothing remotely intimidating
    to the casual listener here.  Long gone are Brodsky's designs on Tom Araya's vocal stylings: Brodsky's
    adopted a far more lush, melodic sound, in the vein of David Baker and Black Francis.  Adam McGrath's solos
    are dark and infectious, meandering through Middle Eastern tonalities and metal-head white noise with ease.</p><p>
    Peripherally speaking, McGrath and Brodsky's guitar work is the only visible link to the dearly departed
    noise-core Cave In of old, shuffling in a mountain of effects pedals amidst the more delicate and refined
    pop/rock sound.  This is precisely why a track like ""The Calypso"" works so well: it blends an indie rock
    sensibility with subtle undertones of progressive metal and space-rock, effortlessly.  The title track holds
    an undeniably Paul McCartney hook, suffused with Brodsky's ethereal harmonizing and the nightmarish,
    pop-perfect intonations of McGrath and bassist Caleb Scoffield.   With a texturally rich canvas of elusive
    shifts and progressions, and the usual slew of <i>Pet Sounds</i> acoustics, <i>Tides of Tomorrow</i> demands
    multiple listens in order to fully appreciate its creamy aural goodness; much of its technique and character
    is lost on the casual critic.</p><p>
    Yet, although <i>Tides of Tomorrow</i> excels in its display of musical growth and maturity, much of this seems
    lost on Brodsky as lyricist, whose metaphors are as sophomoric as ever.   His voice also has a pesky habit
    of straying into that no-man's-land, xFC-metal falsetto.  ""Dark Driving"" is a dreary but solid ballad with
    strong roots in the early, plodding Seattle metal scene a la Soundgarden.  The song is spacious and
    atmospheric, but Brodsky's clumsy play on words-- ""the reality check is in the mail""-- and adenoidal Chris
    Cornell-meets-Rodney Anonymous timbre is a total disaster.  The EP's closer, ""Everest"", falls considerably
    short of the majesty of its name: Brodsky's accidental impersonation of Aaron Lewis is almost unbearable.</p><p>
    Despite the many comparisons made between Radiohead and Cave In following <i>Jupiter</i>'s release in 2000,
    <i>Tides of Tomorrow</i> largely rehashes ground Radiohead covered on <i>The Bends</i> and <i>OK Computer</i>
    over five years ago.  This EP won't be nearly as impressive to weathered indie rock fans as to Hydra Head
    loyalists; it's an album depicting the growth of an adventurous former metal band, yes, but an ultimately
    predictable record where the means never exceed the extremes.  It's also no doubt that many purists will
    view this EP-- and the concurrent shift to RCA-- as a sell-out of the highest order.  Granted, it's an
    eye-opener anytime a noise-core band attempts to expand its musical dynamic to encompass inspirations like
    Spiritualized and Poster Children, but it's also impossible to ignore the marked shift toward accessibility
    and ""easier"" listening embraced by Cave In since the close of the 1990s.</p></div>"|1361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1361-tides-of-tomorrow-ep/|6.9|Isaiah Violante

Jay Popoff (Lit), Derick Whibley (Sum 41) and Tom
    DeLonge (Blink 182), you're not alone. The fact is, we all do, but Dillinger Four may want it just a little
    bit more: the commercialization of punk has made their job considerably more difficult. What used to be
    artistically relevant has been reduced to a mere marketing gimmick, an excuse to spike your hair all
    cute-like and expose your genitals in public.</p><p>
    
    Against all odds, Dillinger Four demand to be taken seriously; their previous release, <i>Versus God</i>,
    said as much. Actually, it said something like: ""Hi, we're Dillinger Four. We make hard rocking, hook-laden
    punk rock. Welcome to our album."" And you thanked them when you listened, because it was good-- good in the
    way NOFX once was.  Dillinger Four weren't out to invent or even reinvent anything: they knew what they
    liked, and they wanted more of it.  Their fans sympathized, and should now embrace the follow-up, which,
    not too surprisingly, doesn't stray too far from its predecessor.</p><p>
    
    For Dillinger Four, success means freedom.  Where some punk bands sound like they don't practice-- which is
    awfully sad, because why be in band if you don't enjoy it-- <i>Situationist Comedy</i> finds Dillinger Four
    hitting the same downbeats, riffing in sync, and generally nailing the rock'n'roll vibe.  And there are
    times when their creativity makes the music something more: on ""Fired-Side Chat"", which fronts the ordinary--
    a speed-core verse contrasted against a midtempo chorus-- but strips down to a bass ostinato before building
    into a four-chord anthem that just skirts emo.  ""All Rise for the National Anthem"" opts for the same
    speed-punk canvas, embellishing upon it with tightly wound, cyclical guitar riffs and a dash of metal
    crunch. ""Labourissuesinthetoydepartment"" digs deeper into the bag of tricks, mimicking a wide-open,
    atmospheric hardcore vibe (a la Fugazi) before steering back toward a more traditional set of punk rhythms.</p><p>
    
    Given the state of pop/punk today, Dillinger Four may be impossible to take seriously.  That's not to say
    they don't rock out, just that it may take a few years for prejudices to subside before people finally
    realize it. The rewards of artistic integrity aren't quite as material or immediate as those enjoyed by the
    Dillinger Four's glamorous MTV peers, but they certainly are rich.</p></div>"|2316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2316-situationist-comedy/|7.4|Brad Haywood

    analogy with the world of motorsports. A curious coincidence points us toward such a comparison: what band's
    name starts with ""M"", ends with ""I"", and plays grandiose, instrumental post-rock? If you said Mogwai, you
    made the right call.  So the question, then: does the analogy hold water?  The answer is twofold: sort of,
    but not really.</p><p>
    
    Let's start with the ""sort-of"". Maserati sort-of treads a path that's been blazed two or three times over.
    They describe their sound as ""instrumental U2, with punk rock roots."" The first half is easy to hear in
    their huge, confident sound, full of spacious, atmospheric guitar work, grounded by a tight rhythm section
    and prominent, dynamic basslines. In essence, Maserati employs the same approach to post-rock that Mogwai
    does (as opposed to the more hollow sounds of a band like Godspeed You Black Emperor!). The punk half of
    their self-description is less apparent, appearing in the attacking moments of songs like ""Keep It Gold"".
    Even then, the jabbing, punk-inflected guitar work is eclipsed by a propulsive low-end, which is in turn
    overcome by distortion and prog flourishes. Maserati are far less fiery than they are moody: there's nothing
    unsettling in their mix, and they seem allergic to math and dissonance.</p><p>
    
    Now, as to the ""not really"" half of our prong, the results Maserati achieve may sound familiar in this
    oversaturated genre, but they're not unwelcome. Though they don't break new ground, they walk field adeptly,
    boasting superior execution and occasionally impressive moments of fusion. ""Being a President Is Like Riding
    a Tiger"" is one of those moments, where a solo guitar meditates for three minutes until drums enter,
    hastening a Godspeed-like tempo and flavor. After another minute-and-a-half, the composition draws back,
    shifting gears to steel itself for crescendo: a recurrent two-measure melody carried by the bass alternates
    one measure in 16th notes and a full measure of rest. Spiraling above the bass are a pair of charged,
    supernal guitars that gradually swell as the bass modulates to play both the melody and the rests. At
    full bore and full volume, the band musters a powerful climax.</p><p>
    
    The band doesn't reach the same heights again on the disc, but comes close on a few tracks. ""Cities"" follows
    a similar form, with a restrained, tense opening that segues into an uptempo jam that, while anchored by a
    prog bassline, is punctuated by more stratospheric guitar work. The slower material-- like ""Ambassador of
    Cinema"" and ""The Language""-- is also pleasant and well executed, but its meandering nature and lack of
    distinguishing hooks ultimately renders it innocuous.  Verdict: Maserati may be redundant, but not
    undesirably so.  They take what's already been done and infuse it with their own aptitudes and energies.
    The results are just fresh enough to remain engaging.</p></div>"|5131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5131-the-language-of-cities/|7.3|Brad Haywood

    end of the road with the high iron fence and unkempt lawn, their activities inside kept secret from the world
    outside.  Early records like <i>Heresie</i> and <i>Ceux du Dehors</i> were terrifying walks through the
    valley of death, a chamber ensemble wheezing out moaning studies in extremely unpleasant texture and gripping
    dissonance.  I don't know what kind of childhoods kids in Belgium have, but that country has managed to
    produce some of the world's most frightening bands, and Univers Zero were, without question, the most
    terrifying.</p><p>
<i>Rhythmix</i> is Univers Zero's second album since the band reformed in 1999 after a 13-year hiatus, and
    if nothing else, it proves that they're still very bizarre.  At its best, <i>Rhythmix</i> sounds like the
    Merry-Go-Round breaking down in some gruesome alternate dimension; at its worst, it sounds like a troupe of
    mall goths found their way into the keyboard section of Sam Ash and messed with the ""spooky"" presets.</p><p>
    
    Technology is a mixed blessing for older bands, offering an inviting array of new possibilities, but
    frequently leading them astray.  And so it goes that, on <i>Rhythmix</i>, drummer and band leader Daniel
    Denis fails most frequently when he attempts to use new technology to his advantage, sticking a ""pizzicato
    string section"" keyboard setting into passages for which he couldn't hire actual violinists.  He and
    co-producer Didier de Roos also shy away from the dry, unaffected sound that made Univers Zero's early
    albums so brutal and direct, which robs the otherwise well-composed music of some of its potential impact.
    Somehow, they also manage to record some of the ""real"" instruments, like Michael Berckmans' woodwinds and
    Bart Maris' trumpet in such a way that they sound as though they're synthesized.</p><p>
    
    Still, even with its relatively neutered sound, the album manages quite a few genuinely disquieting moments,
    such as ""Waiting for the Sun"" (not a Doors cover), which features Bart Quartier's glockenspiel front and
    center and sends the other instruments to the back to scrape out a dark corner for it to sit in.  ""The
    Fly-Toxmen's Land"" is ferociously rhythmic and even spastic at times, building to an intense coda wherein
    Denis pulverizes his drums for your edification while the rest of the band holds a quivering drone behind
    him, completely subverting the rock vein the song begins in.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the music is frenzied, but hampered by the production.  Eric Plantain plays a pretty badass bass,
    but it has this bright Tony Levin tone to it for the first few tracks that just doesn't gel with the music.
    Thus, the staggering processional, ""Terres Noires (Blacklands)"", sounds more awkward than it was probably
    intended to-- the idea and composition is great, but the fake harpsichord and slap-bass suck the evil
    straight out of it.</p><p>
    
    And that's really my biggest beef with <i>Rhythmix</i>.  Superficially, it <i>sounds</i> like Univers Zero--
    but without the evil, what do you have?  Just another wanky prog band, I'm afraid.  And while these guys
    are in no danger of becoming Liquid Tension Experiment anytime soon, they are risking becoming their own
    pale shadow, and that would be a sad waste, indeed.  I urge you to give these guys a chance, but don't
    start here.</p></div>"|8356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8356-rhythmix/|6.0|Joe Tangari

    now-- a band this lost needs all the help they can get.  What happened to the uneasy, no-frills drive they
    once had?  I think back to ""Everlong"" and hear Dave Grohl's uncertain musings of whether ""anything could
    be this good again,"" and in the clarity of hindsight, it seems the answer, unfortunately, is a deafening
    ""no,"" screamed over the shiniest, shallowest guitar bridges around.  With every album, the Foos get slicker
    than before; the passion behind their songs waxed off by an ever-thickening veneer of overproduction.  Right
    now, the Foos are so polished you can see right through them.</p><p>
<i>One by One</i> is a particularly apt title for their fourth radio-ready shout-along: slowly, inevitably,
    the last rough edge of the Foo Fighters' sound has been buffed away, leaving most of these songs with a
    palpable emptiness.  Which is not to say the Foo Fighters were ever lo-fi, just that, next to this one,
    <i>The Colour and the Shape</i> could have been recorded out of a suitcase.  At the very least, though,
    there's a sense of substance.  The weightless, antiseptic cuts of <i>One by One</i> seem to reach for the
    racing glory of ""Everlong"", but fall short; they don't get their hands dirty long enough to even recall the
    beautiful filth of ""Stacked Actor"".  Without exception, studio gloss aims to pass for the excellence the
    Foos have occasionally displayed on their previous two albums; it never even comes close to the relative
    grit and power of their debut.</p><p>
    
    Now, I'd be deceiving you if I didn't say that there was a saving grace to <i>One by One</i>.  It's a scary,
    awful sort of saving grace, but you take what you can get.  Despite the tepid, manufactured essence of these
    songs, and their failure to create any sort of sustained, visceral jolt, Grohl &amp; Co have managed to hit on
    a sort of mediocre consistency by virtue of the precision with which their material is recorded.  Really,
    the fact that any of these songs sound at all distinct from one another is kind of an achievement in light
    of 1999's <i>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</i>.</p><p>
    
    The glossy, assembly line techniques hold the record together, but their clinical craftsmanship creates
    eleven songs about as superficially interesting and diverse as they are uninspired.  Grohl even seems to
    admit as much in the album's booklet.  Throughout are crude drawings of disembodied, bleeding hearts
    (illustrated by renowned artist Raymond Pettibone) with accompanying text clearly retaliating against the
    record industry's dehumanizing of commercial music-- the old face-off of art vs commerce.  On the center
    page, the words are handwritten: ""I do wrong to put my heart into what I write.  That is no longer done.""
    If this is simply drama to accompany the theme of the artwork, as some might suggest, it's an awfully suspect
    choice of words for a record so packed with commercial potential and no actual heart.  And if the sentiment
    is sincere, Grohl must understand that it's the choice he's made-- label execs might be aggressive or
    persistent, but no one's forced him into commercial viability.</p><p>
<i>One by One</i> does, in fact, deliver what the business expects-- it's a groove the Foo Fighters have hit
    on before, and it's the prevailing mindset behind virtually every single that hits the airwaves: mindless
    catchiness.  We've heard it in songs like ""Breakout"", but the Foos had never put together a full album's
    worth of this stuff until now.  And yet, even this presumedly intentional dumbing-down can't cloak Grohl's
    skill as a songwriter.  The lyrics may be utterly banal, but the hooks are tight.  And in that sense, the
    record isn't a total loss; if you're looking for flashy radio rock, look no further.  ""Burn Away"" is like
    ""Learn to Fly"" lite: it soars on similar wings for about five minutes, and it's even pretty great while it
    lasts, but after it finds its way back to Earth, you may be hard-pressed to recall the impact.  The same
    holds true for ""Low"", whose blistering aggression and searing guitar attack serves nicely as <i>One by
    One</i>'s token kick to the groin (even if it feels more like a charley horse), despite being totally out
    of step with an album that largely opts for sweep over brutality.  Still, if nothing else, it shows that
    Dave's been paying very close attention during his time with the Queens of the Stone Age.</p><p>
    
    What's surprising is that, in the end, <i>One by One</i>'s even, middling quality proves to be its silver
    lining.  In the car, on that long descent into rush hour, it could come and go without so much as a batted
    eye, but neither would you be scrambling to change the disc.  Its skillful composition is undeniable-- the
    problem is that it comes without any real strength or character.  Foo Fighters have been in short supply of
    both for a while now, and this record might be a hint that they now plan to do without them entirely; I just
    can't help but miss the sincerity of their older material.  At one time, Foo Fighters could pull off ""great""
    with a fraction of the technical support; <i>One by One</i> had its sights set on ""good enough"" from the
    very beginning.</p></div>"|3147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3147-one-by-one/|5.4|Eric Carr

It's a key ingredient in both their unique
    brand of punk/jazz/skronk/metal/improv music (or as the band's only permanent member, Weasel Walter, calls it,
    ""brutal prog""), and in their live shows (which tend to teeter mercilessly on the edge of an Andy Kaufman
    is-this-for-real sensibility before ending with Walter and company annihilating their setup and stomping at
    the remnants with nihilistic glee). Besides, the whole history of the band-- which, I should add, predates
    most of the ""edgy"" extreme noise bands benefiting from all sorts of instant press these days-- is interwoven
    with a vaguely outlined plot about the destruction of the world, civilization's fall into chaos, and the
    rebirth of order in the form of... a 100-foot tall green aluminum robot that hibernates underground, waiting
    for an opportunity to break free and fly off into the far reaches of space.  (Weasel's words, not mine.)
    Giant robots or no, it's a far cry from the fairies-and-gnomes bullshit that served as inspiration for most
    stereotypical prog-rock.</p><p>
    
    With all this chaos and calamity at heart, it came as no real surprise when, less than six months after
    the release of <i>Infection and Decline</i>, the Flying Luttenbachers self-destructed.  One member quit,
    the other was kicked out. And this isn't the first time this has happened.  In the 12 years since a
    precocious youngster forged an unlikely alliance with experimental jazz impresario Hal Russel (whose real
    name, for the record, is Luttenbacher), the lineup of the Flying Luttenbachers has seen more change than a
    tollbooth attendant. Indeed, Walter's vision seems to be one of an ever-changing band that evolves alongside
    his ideas, with each change, ideally, bringing him closer to realizing whatever mad ideas lurk in the dark
    recesses of his twisted mind.</p><p>
    
    Say what you will about his music, his persona, and his fashion sense (the white button-up shirt, the X
    on his forehead, the boots, and the antenna in his hair): there's no denying the uniqueness of Walter's
    vision. His regimen is challenging, and his goals even more so. He readily (and often) admits he has yet to
    achieve what he's aiming for, but one gets the feeling he's getting closer. The Flying Luttenbachers' first
    decade saw them playing everything from structured jazz-inspired death-metal to abrasive and painfully
    deafening free-jazz (an incarnation that included recently revered Chicago improvisers like Ken Vandermark,
    Fred Lonberg-Holm and Jeb Bishop). Currently, Walter is touring on an absurd one-man-band shtick, where
    he plays along (mostly on bass) to pre-recorded backing tracks, cracking wise the whole time. Chuckle if
    you must; as Weasel recently told the <i>Chicago Reader</i>, ""I'm willing to take the risk of sucking,
    because without doing that there's no progression.""</p><p>
    
    Regardless of the lineup and execution, a few elements remain Luttenbacher constants. Among them, Walter's
    near-humorous obsession with approach: his it's-never-good-enough demeanor, combined with a penchant for
    showmanship, has earned him a reputation for yelling at his bandmates during sets and tromping about, making
    clear his utter disappointment in his performance after many shows.  He's also developed a proud inaccessibility.
    The Flying Luttenbachers make difficult music, precise as can be, impossible to ignore; that much always stays
    the same.  <i>Infection and Decline</i> documents the last year-and-a-half of Walter's attempts to realize
    his far-fetched musical ideas.</p><p>
    
    Dual bassists Jonathan Hischke (who also does time with My Name is Rar-Rar and Strawberry) and Alex
    Perkolup join him here, dueling with quick wits, quicker fingers, and a few effects as weapons,
    while Walter assaults his homemade drum kit with formidable, latent rage and precision.  The kickoff
    track, ""Infektion"", opens with crescendo, escalating like the blood pressure of a speed-freaked metalhead
    who's just realized he's about to be hit by a truck.  One bassist plays a grind-metal riff over and over
    while the other thrashes up the scales like he's scoring a punk rock suspense film, Weasel bashes
    unabashedly, and then it all stops, and changes. The music plummets, stops again, then mutates into the
    worst kind of call-and-response muso nightmare, as the two bassists exchange piercing high-pitched licks
    that would seem improvised were it not for how tightly they cling to Walter's percussive skeleton.</p><p>
    
    ""Elfmeros"" begins similarly, but quickly takes a turn for the primal and propulsive: here, as on their
    dead-on (if more than a bit savage) cover of Magma's epic ""De Futura"", the Luttenbachers demonstrate why
    they're more than just a wild gimmick with a zany live show, ably navigating a composition filled with
    surprise twists and turns, insane feedback, and skull-crushing percussion. ""The Elimination of Incompetence""
    is as challenging and epic an undertaking as Walter has ever attempted, and again, his cohorts manage every
    sharp turn and abrupt stop he throws their way before the whole thing crumbles to the ground. The repetitive,
    almost gabber drumming, and bursts of sheer noise that make up ""Destruktion Ritual"" may lack the tension or
    anger of its show-stopping in-concert equivalent, but it's still worthy of documentation.</p><p>
    
    Music nerds everywhere ought to be glad <i>Infection and Decline</i> exists; it serves as the only proper
    recording of this chapter in Luttenbachers history, one that saw Walter claim new control over his unchained
    beast.  He's tying up his loose ends in Chicago right now, readying himself for a move to the West Coast
    where he hopes he'll find a more receptive audience for his particular brand of constructive deconstruction.
    Maybe Weasel Walter will finally find the Mecca he's been searching for out on the west coast.  Maybe he'll
    drive his new bandmates to create the musical monolith he's been dreaming of all these years while waiting
    patiently for others with a similar vision to emerge.  And maybe not.  But one thing's for sure: his
    uncertainty will feed the music. Chaos, constant change and self-described failure seem to suit Flying
    Luttenbachers best, nurturing a necessary fire that fuels Walter's seemingly endless excursions.  And if
    the failures are this intense, I'm not sure the human ear has what it takes to cope with Walter's version
    of success.</p></div>"|3122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3122-infection-and-decline/|8.0|David M. Pecoraro

    female performers without making at least a discreet reference or two to their gender.  The artists that
    seem to escape this curse are, sadly, the ones that conform to sexist stereotypes, depicted as weak,
    submissive, and desperate to subsume their identities in a romantic relationship.  Those who've tried to
    slip this yoke would have been blasted in a less sensitive era with accusations of masculinity, but today,
    they're greeted with condescending girls-can-rock-too rhetoric from misguided critics.  The whole situation
    is enough to make you throw your hands up in disgust, when along comes someone like Andrea Perry, offering
    a graceful escape from the gendered ghettos of pop music.</p><p>
    
    An mp3.com darling, Perry follows up her debut, <i>Saturday Morning Sweet Shoppe</i>, with the appropriately
    titled <i>Two</i>.  She runs through a dozen songs in forty minutes, proving along the way that the attention
    she's garnered thus far is no accident.  Despite her idiosyncrasies-- and there are many-- Perry remains
    easily accessible, never letting her unique artistic vision slip into insularity.  This is surely due to the
    fact that, at heart, she's a pop songwriter, and a very fine one at that; though some tracks inevitably shine
    above others, all twelve display an assured sense of craft.  The hooks are never repeated ad nauseam; the
    bridges always arrive in the nick of time.  Perry is able to marry simple joys with depth and sophistication,
    as on the opener, ""Bursting Through the Clouds"", a potentially radio-friendly crossover hit, but its magnificent
    chord progressions signal the author is capable of sustaining whatever attention she grabs.  An even more
    daring balancing act arrives with ""I Think of Nothing"", which chugs along in a disorienting 5/4 beat beneath
    an ethereal cloud of melody.</p><p>
    
    The degree to which Perry was responsible for these sonic details makes the album's accomplishments all the
    more striking; she plays everything except the drums, and sounds thoroughly comfortable on bass, guitar and
    keyboards.  Perry earns added accolades for her production as well: the record feels crisp and clean without
    veering into sterility.  Drummer Chris Searles, the only other musician on <i>Two</i>, is as sympathetic a
    partner as Perry could ask for, keeping busy without becoming intrusive.  Together, they give the songs the
    thrust they need to keep from stalling.</p><p>
    
    With all due respect to Perry's talent, what makes <i>Two</i> a success is her attitude.  While her liner
    notes reveal the album is dedicated to a deceased former bandmate, and a quick look at her lyrics reveals
    no shortage of somber subjects, the music itself is luminous and joyful, a rare thing in these irony-soaked
    days.  If Perry has a weakness, it's that she occasionally works this happy-sad angle into the fey, but like
    Marc Bolan's records with T.Rex, <i>Two</i> has more than enough conviction and charm to make its overt
    songwriting forgivable.</p></div>"|6243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6243-two/|7.0|Brian James

This is followed by the     address of said institution.  While the obscurity of Lee's work may     leave some scratching their heads, <i>Total Lee!</i> brings the     unconverted one step closer to understanding exactly why his acceptance     to the rock'n'roll pantheon is indeed logical.</p>
<p>For almost four decades, Hazlewood has epitomized the renaissance man:     songwriter, producer, singer, actor, label owner, faux-Swede, artist     developer (most notably Duane Eddy, Nancy Sinatra, and Gram Parsons),     cowboy in exile and, with the exception of the rabid cult which usually     accompanies such uncompromising artists, he's done all of this without     ever gaining the recognition he undeniably deserves. Recently, both     hipsters and old-school obscurists alike have sung the praises of     Hazlewood to Skip Spence-like proportions.  Naturally, <i>Total Lee!</i> is ripe for the pickin'.</p>
<p>Steve Shelley's Smells Like label began reissuing Hazlewood's albums in     1999, and is now accompanied by Astralwerks' compilation in tribute to     the man's career.  While the material being paid tribute to is both     thought-provoking and playful, <i>Total Lee!</i> unfortunately works     better in theory than in practice (like most tributes), though it does     thrive a bit more than your typical musical homage.</p>
<p>The strongest contribution to <i>Total Lee!</i> comes from a group called     Madrugada, whose cover of ""Come on Home to Me"" completely alters the song's     attributes-- in the hands of these Norwegian rockers, this somber ballad     becomes a charging doomsday crooner.  By the same token, King of Convenience's     Erlend Øye successfully delivers ""No Train to Stockholm"" by reversing its     70s soft-rock harmony to a solo acoustic whimper.</p>
<p>The Webb Brothers effortlessly update ""Some Velvet Morning""; they could     easily pass their version off as an original were they capable of penning     anything quite so poetic themselves.  UK session man and recent Pulp     contributor Richard Hawley teams up with Jarvis Cocker for ""The Cheat"".     In fact, over the course of the album's 60 minutes, more indispensable     namedrops show up for a turn at Hazlewood's catalogue: Evan Dando, Calvin     Johnson, Calexico, the list goes on.  It's not all worthwhile, but this     man's renaissance is long overdue, and most of these artists do his songs     justice nicely.</p>
<p>In the liner notes of this release, Lee Hazlewood himself gives a track-by-track     opinion of each song as he hears it for the first time. His opinion ranges from     enthused (Stephen Jones &amp; Luke Scott, Kathryn Williams) to the cordial     (Calvin Johnson, The Amazing Pilots).  But it's interesting to get an idea     of what the artist thinks of his own tribute (much like The Kinks homage,     <i>This Is Where I Belong</i>) although much of the dialogue is directed at     the songs themselves.</p>
<p>What makes the album far from essential, yet still enjoyable, is the rediscovery     of songs that are so heartbreakingly genius, yet so neglected.  Rather than just     demonstrate their love for a popular artist (see 2000's <i>Badlands: A Tribute to     Bruce Springsteen's</i> Nebraska), the musicians on <i>Total Lee!</i> bring a     contemporary element to an abandoned body of work that reminds us just how     essential it really is.</p></div>"|3784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3784-total-lee-the-songs-of-lee-hazlewood/|7.1|Kyle Reiter

With a non-stop, wacky surface and a calamitous flow of cheap
    laughs, <i>The Parker Tapes</i> sounds like the kind of novelty record you'd only own to one-up your friends'
    Jerky Boys albums.  Even ""Mike""-- who, with someone named Simon, makes up Cassetteboy-- dismisses it this way:
    ""Basically we record famous people and make it sound like they're talking about sex or drugs.  It's a winning
    formula.""</p><p>
    
    But this is far more than a string of gags.  <i>The Parker Tapes</i> is composed entirely of voice and music
    samples, cut to shreds and reassembled over the course of seven years.  It's a labor of love-- a kind of life
    achievement for the semi-anonymous duo that made it-- and it's also extremely funny, marked by a dry British
    wit and an ear for great sound bites.  They set the tone early with a re-edit of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"":
    ""Here am I shitting in a tin can/ And I'm farting in a most peculiar way.""  This clip lasts approximately 18
    seconds, and then they're onto the next thing; the disc has almost a hundred distinct tracks, each running
    into the next, jammed with cuts and samples.  A prim British woman narrates a sex act; a respectable BBC
    reporter intones, ""Bill Gates is part of the Forces of Darkness""; Bill himself notes that Microsoft can
    ""make people do things""; Julia Child suggests, ""If you have a child handy, put it through a sieve,"" and,
    ""A cup of tea goes very well with a joint.  It's a hallucinogenic drug.  I love it.  Stoned.  Stoned.  Quite
    high.  Look at those donkeys.  Lovely bunny rabbit.  Fluffy bunny.  Rabbit stew.""  And so on.</p><p>
    
    Cassetteboy have formidable technique: you'd think a busy collage like this would take a lot of effort to
    sit through, but it's so fluid and methodical that it carries you along rather than wearing you out.  The
    guys break things up with dozens of music clips and remixes, from hip-hop to pop, making for a kind of
    post-modern vaudeville, and they construct each voice track with attention to rhythm and flow.  Listen to
    ""Joliver"", which remixes clips from Jamie Oliver (BBC's The Naked Chef): they make fun of him (""I'm a bit
    of a tosser""), but they also build an interesting rhythmic pattern into his speech.  It's this skill, as
    much as their sense of humor, that has landed some of these tracks in the Boom Selection of bootleg recordings,
    and earned their work favorable comparisons to the high-concept Plunderphonics of John Oswald.</p><p>
    
    They've also earned praise for their satire, which is the most striking part of the record.  Cassetteboy use
    their hard-won irreverence to sneak in vicious political humor, and these pieces have become their most
    circulated and notorious works.  One of their earlier singles, ""Di &amp; Dodi Do Die"", tore down Britain's
    beloved Princess Diana, but it sounds blunt and sluggish compared to the attacks on this album.  For
    example, they mock Prime Minister Tony Blair, twisting his words to say that the Labour Party will start
    slashing eleven-year-olds with a knife.</p><p>
    
    In this country, the most devastating track is ""Fly Me to New York"", which mocks the only thing Americans
    don't make fun of: the attacks on the World Trade Center.  I don't want to give away too much for those who
    haven't heard it; I just have to hand it to Cassetteboy that not only is the piece disturbingly brutal, but
    their decision to build it around samples of Frank ""New York, New York"" Sinatra is the final nail in the
    coffin of good taste.  And yet, whenever I play it for people they're reduced to fits of laughter, no matter
    how much they object to its criticisms of America.  And isn't that the key to great satire?</p><p>
    
    Whether you listen to it once for laughs or study it in depth; whether you take it as a comedy record, a
    major statement, a technical and aesthetic accomplishment, or just a couple of guys doing silly shit with
    their tape recorders, this is a hilarious, gripping album.  Don't turn your back on it.</p></div>"|1339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1339-the-parker-tapes/|8.7|Chris Dahlen

Unable to sleep, dreading another middle school Monday, the diversion     and mentally exhausting activity DUQ provided often allowed me to fall asleep with ease. Relevant     specifically to this review, however, is what came on at 1:30 a.m., the timeslot I longed for during the     week: Ken Nordine's <em>Word Jazz</em></p><p>.</p><p>Nordine would embark on tangents about colors, nagging wives, sit-down-showers, bohemians, whistling, movie     scripts, and his favorite topic of discourse, language and thought. Perhaps most emblematic of Nordine's     style was the constant personification and visualization of language and sound, exemplified in pieces like     ""Reaching into In"" (available on the Rhino <em>Word Jazz</em> compilation), where, as the title explains, he     attempts to reach into the very ""in-ness"" of ""In"". You can only imagine what a disappointment it was for a     kid who grew up listening to this stuff to have to learn about semantics.</p>
<p>I haven't gotten to the cello-playing and compositions of Fred Katz yet because I didn't know who he was     until last week. Until I heard the recent tribute, led by consistently adventurous cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm     (Peter Brötzmann Tentet, Lightbox Orchestra), I had no idea Katz was responsible for a good share of the     backing music that mingled with Ken Nordine's bizarre monologues over the airwaves each week.</p>
<p>The work with Nordine is what drew me into Katz's work; it would have been enough to secure his place in     the history of strange music, but Lonberg-Holm's tribute brings to light solo cello LPs, work with Chico     Hamilton, and a nice chunk of soundtrack compositions, most notably with Roger Corman (though of Katz's     film work, only a piece written for a Burt Lancaster film-- in which Katz appears-- makes it on to the     album). These are recordings I imagine many, including myself, will be more than inclined to hear after     Valentine's convincing argument.</p>
<p>The execution by Lonberg-Holm, Wilco percussionist Glenn Kotche, and bassist Jason Roebke is at least     partially responsible for this newfound enthusiasm, but the instrumental mastery and subdued sweetness of     this recording isn't enough in and of itself: it stands up thanks to Katz's songs, presented with pristine     delicacy and consideration.</p>
<p>John Corbett's liner notes suggest that Lonberg-Holm's interest in Fred Katz might have something to do     with the shortage of cello-centric jazz musicians, but more than a cellist, Katz showcased the instrument     in his pieces. Corbett remarks that the cello has roughly the same tonal range of the favored jazz instrument,     tenor saxophone, yet the use of double stops, glissandi, pizzicato, and emphasis on timbral color are all     focal points for Katz's work, accented twofold by Lonberg-Holm's choices as an interpreter.</p>
<p>The interplay between Jason Roebke's acoustic bass and Lonberg-Holm's cello is a particular pleasure, as     they exploit their similar tone for dynamic counterpoint. Kotche's percussion might be easy to overlook, as     his degree of professionalism and light touch make for seamless playing, but when he makes a pronounced     gesture, as he does in the ""The Squimp"", it catches the listener by surprise-- and just ten minutes before     the album ends.</p>
<p>The trio plays two standards and one original, allowing the listener to get a feel for what is specifically     unique to the recording, and what is due to Katz's fairly idiosyncratic compositions. Lonberg-Holm's     composition, ""Mystery Kat"", adapts to and explores Katz's rhythmic nuance and exotic harmonies. A gorgeously     drawn-out, warbling rendering of ""My Funny Valentine"" shows one of the many appeals of cello in a jazz     setting, especially to the distinctively reductive aesthetics of so many modern jazz musicians on the     Atavistic label.  There's no concern about breathing, as there would be with a horn, so notes can linger     indefinitely.</p>
<p>Fred Katz's music is well served by Lonberg-Holm's trio, in spite of the fact that <em>A Valentine for Fred     Katz</em> might be a more down-to-earth, traditional affair than its participants have been involved with     in quite some time. Lonberg-Holm displays a reverence for Katz that saturates each track, bypassing the     inane bravado that makes its way into so many jazz recordings, and making a somewhat brief 40-minute album     feel remarkably full.</p></div>"|4835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4835-a-valentine-for-fred-katz/|7.1|Matthew Wellins

    really had fun with the alphabet?  Probably several years.  There are so
    many letters to work with, yet the over-familiarity can kill even the best
    round of Scrabble.  But go back even further, to the sounds of the letters
    themselves.  How long has it been since you actually gave any thought to the
    sound of 'S' or 'L'?  What about numbers?  3,4,5,6,7.  3.  3!  Hmm.  Who
    has time for that?  These modest building blocks have long since been stored
    in archival areas of my mind; they aren't <i>supposed</i> to be interesting.</p><p>
    
    American computer music pioneer Paul Lansky believes otherwise.  Born in
    1944, and receiving a PhD from Princeton (where he has taught since the
    1970s), Lansky was one of the first proponents of both computer-based music
    and electronic alteration of existing sounds, and sometimes whole works.  In
    many ways, his work is a precursor to that of modern electro-heads Fennesz,
    Otomo Yoshihide and Jan Jelinek, and his 1973 piece <i>Mild und Leise</i> was
    mined for samples by Radiohead, giving <i>Kid A</i>'s ""Idioteque"" its unique
    synth-whir.  But Lansky went further than most electronic composers by actually
    inventing his own musical programming language (Linear Prediction Coding), which
    he has made available for free via the Internet.</p><p>
    
    Similar to Yoshihide and Fennesz, one of Lansky's primary goals has been to
    approach ""familiar things from new vantage points, using a novel perch to
    gain a fresh perspective on things we may have come to take for granted.""
    <i>Alphabet Book</i> tackles those early building blocks, letters and numbers,
    and somehow sheds a heck of a lot of light on objects we take for granted in
    the extreme.  It's not that Lansky redefines anything here, but the bright,
    mystical tone clusters and narration by Hannah MacKay (Lansky's wife and
    longtime collaborator) cast the characters as part of an alien libretto to
    an ambient opera.  It isn't really minimalism-- more like muted micropolyphony.
    That is, it appears Lansky has compensated for the potentially hyper-basic
    nature of the material with hundreds of minute details and configurations of
    a small group of objects.  It's watching ""Sesame Street"" with OCD and a penchant
    for Tangerine Dream.</p><p>
    
    The most alluring songs are not coincidentally the most superficially simple.
    The opener, ""ABC"", is a straightforward recitation of the alphabet by MacKay
    over tic-tac percussion (in places, Lansky seems to flirt with microhouse) and
    some seriously ominous/heavenly synthesizer clouds.  As the piece gradually
    unfolds and the chordal backdrop ebbs, flows and threatens to overtake the
    entire arrangement, MacKay's enunciation becomes drawn out and double-tracked.
    The percussion tails the misty synth, and the trail of reverb after the letters
    near the track's end further obscures the list.  Similarly, ""Alphanumeric Song""
    recites both the alphabet and a numerical countdown of sorts simultaneously over
    oddly comforting bell glissandos and drones, effectively synthesizing the
    retro-futuristic, info-saturated music 60s sci-fi obsessives thought we were
    supposed to be listening to now.  Everything is calm, smart and amiably removed
    from any reality I know.</p><p>
<i>Alphabet Book</i> also comes with three Flash animations by Grady Klein to
    accompany Lansky's music that are gifts from the out-of-body-experience gods--
    just try keeping your pupils in line watching the clip for ""ABC"" and its
    post-gothic, disappearing calligraphy.  Sure, spending an evening with
    L,M,N,O,P isn't everyone's idea of a party, but that's probably not the
    point, anyway.  This isn't flat academia, and it certainly isn't elitist
    condescension towards everyday phenomena-- Lansky's music goes for a much
    subtler infiltration of your senses than Kindergarten ever did.</p></div>"|4686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4686-alphabet-book/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    As advances in technology yielded an inscrutably decentralist, mechanized culture that hypnotized viewers
    with sensory overload, many stopped questioning content: mere association with a valid medium validated any
    product. As far as contemporary music is concerned, genre has usurped ""medium"" and many listeners have come
    to define an album or artist according to its relative standing within a predefined class.</p><p>
    
    If ""medium is the message,"" image is its courier. Within the contemporary metal scene, we've seen a rash of
    bands latch onto a core group of image-conscious (but decidedly working-class) metalheads seeking to supplant
    stereotypical, thuggish ""old-school"" modes with a politically correct amalgam of MENSA and anger management.
    As is often the case, especially with bands like Isis and Mastodon, so much effort goes into manufacturing
    that sludgy, choleric sound that most of the music's spontaneity and excitement goes missing in action.
    Northern California's High on Fire, on the other hand, show there's still hope for a metal band to not only
    operate according to its own whims, but also produce organic and monstrous music, devoid of bullshit.</p><p>
    
    Working at the fringes of stoner/doom metal, High on Fire-- guitarist/vocalist Matt Pike, bassist George Rice,
    and drummer Des Kensel-- are as powerful and gargantuan a threesome as metal has produced since the mid 90s.
    Their new LP, <i>Surrounded by Thieves</i>, pushes drone to its limits, with a crushing wall of bass tones
    guaranteed to alter heart rhythms and weaken building infrastructures. High on Fire have unleashed an album
    of old-school metal with all the meaty sloth of Black Sabbath and Saint Vitus, and the drug-induced grooves
    of Obsessed and Celtic Frost. Employing vintage tube amps and minimal studio acrobatics, Pike, Rice and Kensel
    recorded a relentless forty minutes of unadulterated gloom.</p><p>
    
    There's no interest in excess here, no melodic distraction or polyrhythmic frill; all energy is devoted to
    establishing mood, with thundering grooves and economical phrasing. With the album's opening title track,
    High on Fire launch into a massive riff, with gently shifting melodies entwined within power chords and a
    seismic wave of repetition. The low end is so overwhelming that it frequently washes out any neighboring
    treble tones.  But that's the point, isn't it?</p><p>
    
    The strength of this album lies in its nihilistic theme and all-encompassing walls of drone. Pike's lyrics,
    while often somewhat trite, capture High on Fire's minimalist ideals perfectly; hovering between iron frenzy
    and hoarse despair, Pike's intonations serve as a subtle tonal counterpoint. In ""Hung, Drawn, and Quartered"",
    Rice and Kensel pound through a primal groove with marked precision, as Pike rounds out the barren landscape
    with, ""The evil has come and the darkness will cover the light/ Above the legions, who will slay the poor and
    the blind/ Warriors that follow, won't you read the sign and the time/ Stand now in battle and we'll crush
    the clan and their kind.""  Pike's solo-- and make no mistake, the guy can absolutely shred-- is fantastic,
    and one of the band's most interesting anomalies; representing a departure from the droning, methodical
    pace, providing tangential harmonics and perhaps a new direction for the band.</p><p>
    
    ""Thraft of Cannan"" is High on Fire's most blatant homage to the slumbering stupor of <i>Paranoid</i>-era
    Black Sabbath. Trudging through an unremitting progressive blues jam at a snail's pace, ""Thraft"" is eight
    minutes of ambient, minimalist metal at its best. As the band gradually, stealthily ascends to the fastest
    tempos on <i>Surrounded by Thieves</i>, Pike launches into a ferocious solo of shapes and colors while
    Rice's brilliant bass work cements the groove beneath Kensel's meandering toms. With nary a snare drum in
    sight, and little modulation, Kensel's drumming is a lesson in feel and consistency.</p><p>
    
    If you've never experienced street drugs, it's a safe bet you probably won't enjoy this album. I'd also
    suggest getting your kicks some place else if you're medicated for Attention Deficit Disorder: as is the
    case with all doom metal, this album is an exercise in patience. Where High on Fire separates itself from
    the pack is its disregard for the usual cluster-fuck of tricks and trappings pervasive in the alternative
    metal scene. Matt Pike's threesome is a blue-collar collective; yes, the production is pure aggro, but the
    band makes no pretense about their DIY image-- no flashy one-sheets are necessary.  Shunning all tacky ploys
    and glitz, High on Fire's <i>Surrounded by Thieves</i> develops a wholly organic aesthetic of granular
    strength and power, propelling this disc well beyond the hackneyed trash of lesser modern metal bands.</p></div>"|3863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3863-surrounded-by-thieves/|8.8|Isaiah Violante

Critics never failed to mention how it     was put together, and a lot of them claimed to hear elements of the source material in Jelinek's grooves.     As much as I loved <em>loop-finding-jazz-records</em>, I didn't really hear the jazz embryo it supposedly     matured from. That might have been because I fell in love with Jelinek's sound via <em>personal_rock</em>,     an album he recorded under the name Gramm in 2000. <em>Personal_rock</em> has a palette quite similar to     <em>loop-finding-jazz-records</em>, but the sources for his warm, crackly sound remained a mystery at that     time.  I believed the hype regarding his inspiration for <em>loop-finding-jazz-records</em>, but the samples     were transformed so radically that the sounds could rightfully be called Jelinek's own.</p><p>Jelinek's relationship with jazz was a little fuzzy through his first three full-lengths, but this excellent     collaboration with Japanese electronic improv trio Computer Soup makes the connection plain. Jelinek's     Rothko-esque technique-- all warm, blurred hues and unpredictable surges-- fits perfectly with Computer     Soup's jazz aesthetic. At its best, <em>Improvisations and Edits</em> (recorded live in Tokyo last September,     then tweaked in the studio) is a signpost pointing toward a new path for electronic, improvisational music.     What makes the record remarkable is the way it refers back to the patterns and history of jazz, as well as     our collective memories of the genre, while still managing to sound like another strand of music altogether.</p><p>The mind-blowing first track ""Straight Life"" is perhaps the best example of what the album has to offer.     Jelinek's trademark smears and washes occupy the midrange, like ghosted images of Joe Zawinul's electric     piano floating quietly in the wind. DSP jazz modes are set against a walking bassline (possibly computer     generated) and a gently tooted trumpet complete with Harmon mute, a dead ringer for Miles Davis' Prestige-era     ballads. The effect is something like a three-dimensional film, with different realities on each layer;     images of what jazz <em>was</em> manage to interact with a real-time demonstration of all it <em>could be</em>.</p>
<p>Computer Soup lean heavily towards electronics themselves, so it's not always easy to know who does what.     There's some plucked guitar, and that muted horn crops up repeatedly throughout the record, but the bulk     of the sounds seem to bubble up from deep within circuitry. ""Ballads"" echoes the dreamy feel of the opening     track with only slightly less success, but ""The New Anthem"" is a jaw-dropping return to form, as Jelinek's     heavily modulated chords and glitches again duet with the serene trumpet wails, this time backed by some     light cymbal brushing. ""Hot Barbecue"" shows the collaborators in a less controlled mode, with chaotic     computer-game bleeps working to elbow the horn out of the way.</p>
<p>The noisy tracks are a bit less unique, as they discard the multi-layered, referential depth that makes the     best aspects of this album so powerful. ""Watch What Happens"", while toned down a bit, meanders and comes up     short.  Such is the nature of improvisation: you often have to sit through moments of tedium to arrive at     brilliance.  Like any free-form collaboration worth its mettle, though, <em>Improvisations and Edits</em> summons a handful of those epiphanies.</p>

    catapulted into the electronic major leagues. <i>Approximate Love Boat</i>, Zelonky's Low Res debut, remains
    a masterpiece of out-there jazz/noise/IDM: his take on jazz was both hipsterish (borrowing heavily from the
    space-age bachelor end of the jazz spectrum) and elitist (in its warped, misshapen moments). <i>Blue Ramen</i>,
    as befits an album whose title denotes exotic noodling, furthers Zelonky's exploration of alien jazz
    approximations. It's as unsettling as it is spirited-- the Martian equivalent of Les McCann's <i>Layers</i>.</p><p>
    ""Shaftasia"" opens the album with fuzzed-out keyboards and rumbling percussion. Looser than a telltale's mouth,
    the track meanders through awkward harmonies, Morton Subotnik-style electro-acoustic spaciness, and some Sly
    Stone funk. The Latin jam ""Bailamami"" treads on Señor Coconut's kitschy toes, but tempers humor with the old
    world pathos of the Buena Vista Social Club. ""Blue Ramen #3"" continues that melancholy with a teary, cinematic
    organ, serenading a lost love; ""Blue Ramen #2"" follows swiftly with a freak-beat, Fisher Price take on the
    same theme.</p><p>
    The bourbon-and-smoke blues of ""Chalky"" and ""Dirty Serenade"" are the sort of wee-hours laments you'd expect
    to find in a second-rate science-fiction film. But while their emulation of Rashied Ali's infinite percussion
    is engaging, both fail to evoke more than the bleeding colors of a badly developed b-movie.  Now, certainly,
    b-movie soundtracks have their place in my cold heart.  It's just that it's apparent that Zelonky doesn't
    understand the lightweight nature of the Max Rebo Band's mutant melodies: he's actually trying to sell us
    this stuff at face value.  Things look up on ""Veneer"", as he imagines Eric Satie drifting through the cosmos,
    picking out chromatic commentaries on his interstellar sojourn.  But the record ends a bit anti-climactically--
    as if to prove he's capable of conventional performance, Zelonky closes <i>Blue Ramen</i> with the relatively
    pedestrian ""Heliotropic 5"", a gutsy, stomping tune that cloaks nonconformist viscera at its deeply buried
    core.</p><p>
<i>Blue Ramen</i> exists, for me, as an alternative soundtrack to John Carpenter's longhaired, paranoiac
    deep-space comedy, <i>Dark Star</i>. Zelonky's imperfect, cloudy jazz perfectly mimics the stir-crazy
    atmosphere of the film: just as you think you've got your head in the same galaxy, he punches the coordinates
    for a far freakier sector of the universe.  In a world of music designed by robots, the extraterrestrial
    <i>Blue Ramen</i> distinguishes itself in its approximate humanity.</p></div>"|4903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4903-blue-ramen/|7.8|Paul Cooper

    finally gave itself up, but not before a select few escapees could be spirited away in the night.  Some of
    the various refugees have sought sanctuary with Orange Twin, some with SpinART, but all still faithfully
    live to tell the tale of E6 to all who will listen; amen.  Fortunately, judging from the post-E6 outburst
    of some of these bands, the story hasn't changed much.  <i>Un</i>fortunately, though, the story hasn't
    changed at all, and the Great Lakes aren't gonna be the ones to bring something new to the table.</p><p>
<i>The Distance Between</i> features the same fuzzy, sunny day parade retro-pop that typified their former
    label, doing exactly what's expected-- which, of course, is mining that same old late-60s pop territory.
    Still, the faith with which these guys have adhered to the E6 party line smacks of a wholesome, charming
    consistency which, surprisingly, goes quite a long way; that the songs manage to vary somewhat independently
    within such a rigid aesthetic is a further bonus.  Slight shifts of tempo and rhythm help to keep things
    from going stale too quickly; sometimes the guitars are jinglier, sometimes fuzzier.  With some shiny,
    near-ubiquitous orchestral flourishes, the band at times even comes across like Beulah (the best band in my
    recent memory to cop the same rosy, 60s psych sound), albeit without quite the same fervor or dynamism.</p><p>
    
    So go ahead and call me a miserable, baby-eating cynic when I say that, for being such a solid, mildly
    enjoyable album, all <i>The Distance Between</i>'s blue skies and warm breezes just wear me out.  This
    album only has two moods: happy and really fucking happy.  Whether the Lakes are stomping their way through
    the hazy rock of ""Sister City"", or drifting along on languid string swells and harmonica in the following
    ""Ever So Over"", they never fails to have a dreamy, Oxycontin-induced smile mercilessly etched across their
    faces.  Even the covers they choose are cheery; The Zombies' ""This Will Be Our Year"" is reproduced in all
    of its glorious optimism as a faithful homage to one of the Lakes' obvious influences, along with Mike
    Nesmith's ""Some of Shelley's Blues"".  The hyper-extended jam outro to ""Conquistadors"" was the last straw.
    After only a half-hour, it felt like I'd been cracked in the face with a rainbow hammer.</p><p>
<i>The Distance Between</i> never sets its sights beyond the blissful
    psych-pop it emulates, but they nail it, at least.  The closest they ever come to breaking stride is
    ""Tugboat Sailor"", a barely-disguised rip-off of Galaxie 500's signature distortion layers, and even then
    the Great Lakes still allow their fundamental breezy good-humor to shine through.  By switching through
    numerous combinations of piano, horns, and strings, they keep things from stagnating, while preserving a
    vital cohesion.  But while the E6 legacy of guitar fuzz and hooky retro is being upheld competently by the
    Great Lakes, they take it just a little too far.  Still, there's nothing wrong with being happy (I hear
    some people are actually rather fond of it), and this album can fill that niche admirably.  But after this
    record's relentless reign of joy, even the most carefree individuals may feel like frowning, just to make
    sure they still can.</p></div>"|3565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3565-the-distance-between/|6.0|Eric Carr

We've hosted sedentary marathons in
    our apartments, stockpiled Bob and David bootlegs bought on eBay, and incorporated the ""lessons"" from the
    show's skits into our lives like parables from some foulmouthed, existential Tele-Talmud. I also admit to
    having developed a strange, extra-textual concern for David Cross. Likeminded futon-psychoanalysts fret
    over his fluctuating weight, his fitfulness and despondence, his drinking and drugging, and the degree to
    which he seems either to be ""really trying"" or ""just getting by."" We even think we've detected some anxiety
    in him regarding his age and an apparent prolonged adolescence, a tension common in indie-folk old enough
    to remember when a Buffalo Tom t-shirt (Cross sported one here and there back in the day) was a Friday night
    staple.</p><p>
    
    I recently got a chance to impose my assumptions on Cross in person, when ""Mr. Show""'s ""Hooray for America""
    tour came to DC. The day of the show, I was in a posh glasses shop, begging the clerks to fix the specs I'd
    destroyed the previous night. I'd already spotted <i>Henry Fool</i>'s Thomas Jay Ryan that day, so by the
    cosmic idiotic rule of three, I was due for two more brushes with unbridled famousness. My friend was staring
    at some cyborg-shades that fit over your skull, like a mohawk blended with that Bespin robo-slave's
    digi-headwrap. That's when I saw a wiry David Cross sneering through the shop's doors. We pursued him,
    noting that he was smaller than we'd dreamed (a fragile flower). Flinchy and downcast, he looked miserable
    between his headphones, which we imagined he might be wearing as some form of protection. We stalked him
    until he went into an international news store, and gentle giant Ralph Nader came striding from the opposite
    direction, fulfilling the trinity and forcing us to recalibrate our gawking.</p><p>
    
    On his new double CD, David Cross trashes President Secondbush's leadership by claiming that even Nader would
    have bombed Afghanistan. He also gives his would-be nannies many, many reasons to worry about his ""wellness.""
    <i>Shut Up, You Fucking Baby!</i> could be subtitled <i>Portrait of the Atheist as a Ranting Phantom</i>.
    David Cross's latest comedy project will elicit laughter, but without the uplift: his drive to amuse via
    rage is, ultimately, a colossal bummer.</p><p>
    
    Slathering fangeeks-- the people already trafficking in the album's punchlines instead of being independently
    funny; the ones who bought up the depressing heap of catchphrase-merch at the Mr. Show concerts-- are too
    quick to make a guru of Cross and his sharp, protean mimicry of Odenkirk's nonlinear child-man. The comic
    principles in Cross's stand-up and on ""Mr. Show"" work, though they're so exciting at first encounter, they
    threaten to become crutches. These elements are amusing, but not new: they're not what we non-slathering--
    but still sick and needy-- ""Mr. Show"" disciple-scum expected from this long, long player. You decide:</p><p>
    
    A) Profanity. See the title! See the warranted explicit content sticker! See the cuss-pocked liner notes
    that end with an apology for all the ""lazy"" swearing! I love me some potty mouth, but after repeated plays
    of this CD, the listener begins to understand that profanity is nihilistic, a kind of anti-language:
    utterances that eliminate themselves. The fucking planet's full of fucking fuckers, according to this
    fucking disc, and fuck, man, are they fucking fucked. Will future cultures view our profanity as a
    generational cry for help, since so many funny and intelligent folks' response to our global predicament
    is to flee to the sweet, default comfort of obscenity's shitty asshole?  (See also <i>The Onion</i> and
    <i>Get Your War On</i>.)</p><p>
    
    B)  ""Breaking whatever walls are left, now that everything's meta-."" Like a scrappier Letterman, David Cross
    loves to leave piss-stains on the parameters of sketchy comedy and stand-up. On this mammoth, career-defining
    statement, he includes an audience member's apparently drunken interference, and an impromptu trashing of
    people who forgot to turn off their telecommunications revolutions during his performance.</p><p>
    
    C) Reading from sources. Like his earlier readings from <i>Goodpussy</i> or spurious dating guides, Cross
    presents some anecdotes from a Promise Keepers handbook, an Atlanta newspaper, and an ad for Squagels. The
    riffing is exquisite, but not singular: the world's full of material so painfully absurd that it can speak
    for itself. Cross comes off like a kid throwing a pebble at a charging pit bull; I'd assume most of us spend
    a good part of our dayjob hours spotting similarly maddening minutiae, as a salve against the ways it
    overwhelms us.</p><p>
    
    D) Risking alienating your audience. Squint in bastardized awe as Cross confidently offers his sickest
    Catholic-blast since the raped-by-Mary bit in his much tighter HBO special ""The Pride Is Back"". It involves
    children, duh, and it needn't be repeated by anyone who believes their soul has a Velcro underbelly to which
    crud could stick. A moment involving the n-word is the boldest mock unveiling of concealed prejudice since
    Denis Johnson's African breakdown in his essay collection <i>Seek</i>.  In ""The Pride Is Back"", Cross had
    even made fun of losing his audience, saying, ""Yeah, get to the comedy, enough of this 'I don't like Jesus'.""</p><p>
    
    By the second disc of <i>Shut Up, You Fucking Baby!</i>-- which is much more vitriolic than the comparatively
    frivolous first-- Cross has obviously passed the point of no return, and is so clear in his convictions/aversions
    that he can tirade and judge as if atop a soapbox in the center of a Kurtzian compound. Cross even mines the
    ruins of the World Trade Center for comic zirconium, preferring to call ""the events of September 11"" ""the
    week football stopped."" The package's most glorious image comes in his description of a New York rollerblader
    outfitted with a deluxe gas mask-- what a perfect icon for this age of perfect icons. Though I find his
    spiel about the WTC rubble's foul smell almost inhumane, he is brave to tiptoe, then stomp onto terrain
    viewed as off-limits for comedy, which is still a very hypocritical stance for a country that freely
    circulates jokes about Helen Keller, Anne Frank, Ethiopians, dead babies, and the Challenger astronauts.</p><p>
    
    E) Lengthy, impassioned skewering of marginal celebrities. Rickey Henderson gets it this time! And the VH1
    non-band Harlow! Before you can think ""who's next, Rhea Perlman?"" remember that Cross knows these aren't
    moving targets, and that's his point: look how much !#@%!&amp;$ mental space these ""stars"" take up.</p><p>
    
    F) Disdain for mass gatherings/trends.  A running theme in his career, from the days when he'd harangue the
    Aspen Comedy Festival, to his anti-award-show rants, to his Tampa Bay story about the abused elephant's
    galactic vagina.  Now comes this album's impaling of Atlanta street parties and the flag fad. Cross is the
    portrait of homeland insecurity, doomed to a state of Ashcroft-ordained heightened alertness.</p><p>
    
    G) Disdain for religion. He even admits to being ""obsessed,"" and he sounds it, more so than ever. At some
    points his voice trembles, he yells, and even repeats himself-- just like the preachers he's excoriating.
    The irony of sounding preachy about being preached to is heavy, unfunny freight.</p><p>
    
    Again, you might enjoy bits of this (""missile defense shields work by magic,"" Cross explains) but it's hard
    on the spirit. Cross slings invective, sometimes witlessly, only to end on ""that's so stupid"" or ""that's
    fucked up."" Anyone who shares his politics and sensitivities will probably already have thought of the things
    he says here. At one point, Cross acknowledges he's in a rut of beginning topics with ""Another thing I hate...""
    He's aggressively curmudgeonly, and skirts losing composure as his observations accumulate. Self-deprecation
    remains a subtext. I love him, but he sounds defeated. Is the title aimed at his targets or at himself? I've
    been one of the multitudes asking ""where's the anger?"" lately, but now that I hear it, I feel just as
    confused, empty, and emotionally homeless as Cross.</p></div>"|1675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1675-shut-up-you-fucking-baby/|6.5|William Bowers

For this reason (and many others), I do not perform alt-country music in
    Norway. But apparently, what seems like common sense to me is nonsense to St. Thomas (aka Thomas Hansen),
    Norway's most popular alt-country artist. Language barriers?  No barrier at all for this man. He is determined
    to bridge all cultural gaps and bring his Norwegian music to America in its native tongue. To wit: ""Oh, there
    are horses everywhere/ Little doggies barking at the chair/ Oh, please get out of my hair/ Small elephants
    doing their distance/ Well, what do I tell you now/ Will you ever know somehow/ Please do not understand/
    That I am a normal man."" For those of you not yet overcome by profound grief, take this: ""Emily Lang has got
    me so far/ It can't get it any worse/ Emily Lang is in my head/ And I am in her purse."" In her purse! Oh,
    empathize for poor St. Thomas.</p><p>
    
    For a number of years, Hansen toiled as a postman, but something hit him-- namely, the twin muses Will Oldham
    and Elliott Smith, whose music prompted Hansen to leave the letters behind in pursuit of his singer/songwriter
    dreams. So far, the choice has paid off well, as he's scored top-ten pop singles and critical acclaim throughout
    his homeland. This attention caught the eye of U.S. label Misra, who picked up <i>I'm Coming Home</i> for a
    stateside release.</p><p>
    
    Sure, the Smith/Oldham influence is apparent, but even more apparent (and less egregious) is an uncanny
    resemblance to <i>After the Gold Rush</i>-era Neil Young. The falsetto warble St. Thomas employs sounds not
    unlike Young performing on ""The Muppet Show"" with the Swedish Chef harmonizing.  I could forgive this if it
    were somewhat modified (something like how Doug Martsch and Jason Lytle and Wayne Coyne do it), but Hansen
    gives us a straight impersonation.  This, coupled with his cribbed song structures, make it clear he's still
    trying to figure it all out.</p><p>
    
    Ditto for the music: while the opener, ""The Cool Song"", has a catchy, campfire appeal that, combined with
    its urgent, compact melody, impels sympathetic foot-stomping, a background of curious percussion, fiddles
    and a drum circle on ""Bookstore"" are pure essense-of-Oldham.  Hansen then tops this off with a chirping vocal
    performance, and though the music is dense, uniformly well executed and nicely produced, it's ultimately
    unremarkable given its inspiration. The guy's just aping his mentors, ill-equipped to blaze his own path.
    But St. Thomas is likely just getting warmed up.  If nothing else, he's committed to his genre and has a
    decent pedigree.  It's even possible that, if his English improves, he may rise above the kitsch factor
    for which he is quite obviously exploited.</p></div>"|7455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7455-im-coming-home/|5.1|Brad Haywood

Torn between wanting to heave balls of fire into the faces of unsuspecting audience members who
    probably came expecting to see Cibo/Shonen/Banana, and wanting to tap into the secret meter, unplayable to
    all but the most gone-prog hill-gurus.  Torn between sliding into a comfortable niche as happy-go-lucky
    medley geeks and unleashing actual noise-terrorism, improvisational masochism, brutal Catechism!  Torn
    between paying homage to Magma, Area and This Heat and ruining the reputations of said inspirations (and
    consequently, anyone who would recommend Ruins).  Nothing about Tatsuya Yoshida's longstanding-- and at
    this point probably ""legendary"" (which may be part of the ""problem"")-- duo is easily digestible, except
    for the maddening consistency of his vision.  And even that isn't a given.</p><p>
    
    Ruins' music can be roughly grouped into three sections: the first (1985-1991) features bassists Kazuyoshi
    Kimoto and Hideki Kawamoto.  This period-- best represented on 1990's <i>Stonehenge</i> LP-- established the
    band's rep as Hardcore junkies (or not; Yoshida claims he hasn't listened to much punk) with a prog fetish.
    The second era (1992-1996), which I consider the most interesting time for the band, featured bassist
    Ryuichi Masuda.  The songs got longer, the bass lines thicker-- a lot more like those hallowed Magma lines
    of yore-- and their oppressive lack of dynamic contrast suddenly seemed like the mark of true originals
    rather than some po-mo noise experiment gone horribly wrong.  The current Ruins lineup (1997-present)
    features bassist Hisashi Sasaki and is probably the most frustrating of all.  Rather than ride off into the
    Zeuhl sunset, Ruins recently decided to destroy all ties to anything recognizable and/or coherent, opting
    for polyrhythm over speed-beat, and micro-fugue over smash-rock riffs.  It's been a gradual triumph of
    brain over brawn for the past 17 years, and predictably, the results have been mixed.</p><p>
<i>Tzomborgha</i> is the group's eighth full-length of studio material (not counting the demo-heavy
    <i>Refusal Fossil</i>), and it's arguably the best of the Sasaki discs.  As with 1998's <i>Vrresto</i>
    and 2000's <i>Pallaschtom</i>, the obsessive desire to change directions as many times as possible in one
    song could drive many listeners to drink.  Furthermore, Yoshida's recent love of medleys (""Progressive Rock
    Medley"", ""Classical Medley"", et al) is somehow not as neat as in the past.  Here, ""Black Sabbath Medley
    Reversible"" (don't think for a second they can't play this stuff backwards) and ""Mahavishnu Orchestra Medley""
    should be novelties but for the fact they sound a hell of a lot like typical Ruins tunes.</p><p>
    
    There are some classic jams here, too, for anyone willing to go the extra kilometer.  ""Skhanddraviza"" starts
    out suspiciously goofy, with what sounds like a goat vocalizing over a punk bossa nova beat, but soon enough
    erupts into high-pitched, harmonized yelping and a trapset tantrum.  In the middle, it settles on a three-note
    ostinato that's superficially reminiscent of <i>Stonehenge</i>'s ""B.U.G."" mid-section, except, instead of
    playing the ""we could go on like this all day"" card, Ruins prefer to mix in some echoplex, metallic soloing
    over the figure (Sasaki's secret weapons are his effects pedals) before moving on to other business:
    ""Gurthemvhail"" begins with Sasaki proving chicken scratch funk licks are possible on the bass before Yoshida
    cuts him off at the pass with some of his tightest drumming on record.</p><p>
    
    What might not go over with most listeners is the hallmark of Ruins' current incarnation: extended
    free-rhythm and improv pieces.  Sasaki and Yoshida have an incredible ability to play the most intimidating
    figures in perfect unison, and don't need any pesky beat to accompany their adventures.  The opener
    ""Komnigriss"" (similar to <i>Vrresto</i>'s opener ""Snare"") makes mincemeat out of any expectations you might
    have for a downbeat; ""Messiaen"" (apparently a cover of one of the French composer's melodies) leaves no
    room for breath or handclaps.  None of that can be considered criticism where Ruins albums are concerned,
    but for newcomers, I'd go with <i>Hydero</i> or even last year's hellish live record on Tzadik first. If
    you're still onboard after those, grab a charge card and a copy of <i>Tzomborgha</i>-- like Yoshida, you'll
    be in it for the long haul.</p></div>"|6867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6867-tzomborgha/|7.9|Dominique Leone

But the significance of this pairing goes beyond simple collaboration.  It is     historical.  Here's why:</p>
<p>Love him or leave him, Patton's influence on underground metal and hardcore, particularly through Faith No     More, is undeniable. His influence on mainstream rap-rock is similarly undisputed, serving as the template     for vocalists like Korn's Jonathan Davis. There's a list of side-projects and guest appearances too long to     mention, boasting an acclaimed cast of cohorts: John Zorn, Dan the Automator, Dave Lombardo (Slayer), Duane     Denison (Jesus Lizard), and Melt-Banana, among others. And at the foundation of the legend, there's simply     the mad genius of Mike Patton, a.k.a. ""Hardcore Pavarotti"", with his immense vocal range and penchant for     perplexing artistic expression. He may be too much to handle sometimes, but it wouldn't be an exaggeration     to call the man an icon.</p>
<p>And then there's the Dillinger Escape Plan:  With only one release under their belts (the three-song EP     <i>Under the Running Board</i>) at the time, this band laid down perhaps the seminal recording for the now     flourishing math-metal genre, blending elements of math-rock, metal, and hardcore with a tip of the hat to     modern jazz. Highly technical and intelligent, but still tenacious and punishing, 1999's <i>Calculating     Infinity</i> set a high-bar for the genre, and garnered loads of praise for the New Jersey upstarts.</p>
<p>In 2001, while searching for a new vocalist to replace the departed Dmitri Minakakis (who took lead vocals     on <i>Calculating Infinity</i>), DEP butted heads with Patton to produce this four-track EP.  For a meeting     of the minds of this caliber, you might assume there had to be some give and take, but here, the two parties     complement each other perfectly by blending their two distinguished sounds into one primal force: DEP's     cerebral approach interlocks with Patton's more visceral leanings, making for a seamless, happy medium of     intense technical proficiency and quirky, creative flourishes.  This one is on par with DEP's finest, yet     it's more accessible-- and more importantly, it surpasses everything Patton's done since Faith No More's     <i>Angel Dust</i>.</p>
<p>Patton himself hasn't changed. The cartoon-baritone hyper-rap on ""Hollywood Squares""-- in addition to the     Snarf melody-- tells you the eccentric Patton of old hasn't gone anywhere. Similar spastic rap stylings on     ""Pig Latin"" further reinforce the point. And just in case you still aren't convinced, he sports a multi-faceted,     all-natural Richard D. James impression on the band's rendition of ""Come to Daddy"".  Yet, unlike most of     Patton's other recent projects, including Tomahawk and Fantômas, DEP refuse to reflect the strained     caricature of his vocals in their music.  There is no ""goof"" in hardcore punk, and the band hasn't     compromised-- these are, after all, the guys who shat on stage during a performance at the August 2002     Reading Festival.</p>
<p>The band's calculated proficiency stands in stark contrast to Patton's right-brained outlandishness; while     Patton is busy stammering about ""your mother, your father,"" and God-knows-what else on ""Pig Latin,"" DEP are     furnishing him with flawless funk-metal. The multi-faceted ass kicking of ""Hollywood Squares"" relies on the     band's patented, eruptive math-metal passages to break up a modicum of Patton weirdness.  And even ""Come     to Daddy"", which may sound like a bad idea in theory, comes off with supreme ferocity: Chris Pennie's drums     simply decimate iBooks.</p>
<p>The complete package is neither arcane nor peculiar. Patton and DEP have managed to find a midpoint between     two styles that speaks to both sides of the brain. The only unfortunate thing is that we'll likely never     again witness the two in action together; last year, Dillinger hired vocalist Greg Puciato who, despite     handling his growling duties admirably, doesn't near possess Patton's vocal range or ambition.  So it's just     as Patton himself once mused: ""You want it all but you can't have it.""  Four songs will have to suffice.</p></div>"|2314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2314-irony-is-a-dead-scene-ep/|8.4|Brad Haywood

On their 1998
    debut, <i>Snowboarding in Argentina</i>, James Taylor and David Brown forged nine gleaming ingots of
    silicon-based, dub-leaning techno.  DJs like Mr. C and Terry Francis spun tracks like ""Bueno"" and
    ""Fukumachi"", and effectively made Swayzak the cat's meow of tech-house.  That album's success lent the duo
    the credit and credibility to expand their horizons; their follow-up, <i>Himawari</i>, featured guest slots
    from dub poet Benjamin Zephaniah and former Opus III vocalist Kirsty Hawkshaw.  But while it retained some
    of its predecessor's gleam, it too often settled for transient pop.  <i>Dirty Dancing</i> now finds Swayzak
    pursuing the latest flavor-of-the-month-- electroclash-- even more vigorously.</p><p>
    Clearly, Swayzak would like to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Fischerspooner, Adult., and Ladytron.
    <i>Himawari</i>, in acidic electro-jams like ""Mysterons"" and ""State of Grace"", included traces of this
    sound before it become a phenomenon-- isn't it only fair they should scoop up some of the acclaim?  Well,
    frankly, no.  While it's not torture to listen to <i>Dirty Dancing</i> repeatedly, it does contain more than
    its rightful share of slip-ups and missteps.  To be fair, Swayzak's take on electroclash opts to rubs noses
    with John Selway's innovative style, rather than certain acts' slap-dashed approximations of <i>Speak and
    Spell</i>-era Depeche Mode.  The opener, ""Make Up You Mind"", grafts a minimal techno rhythm track onto
    jaunty electro-pop, as guest vocalist Clair Dietrich bobs and weaves her adenoidal Sarah Cracknell
    impersonation through gleaming sheets of cool German ambience and Jackmaster Funk bass bounces.  And Swayzak
    relate the murderous tale of ""Buffalo Seven"", as narrated by Alan Vega's doppelganger Klaus Kotai, with
    similar panache.</p><p>
    ""In the Car Crash"", however, is the first sign of Swayzak falling back on an electroclash cliché-- it's yet
    another adaptation of The Normal's J.G. Ballard-worshipping ""Warm Leatherette"". But this track can't add
    anything to its subgenre; ""Warm Leatherette"" said it all, as starkly and as chillingly as possible.  The
    duo goes as far as to soften and romanticize its inspiration's most inhumanly fucked-up, mechanical porno
    lyric, by exchanging, ""The handbrake penetrates your thigh,"" for, ""Face through the window/ But you're always
    on my mind.""  It's an honest effort, but for my money, the closer you can get to the amoral essence of
    Ballard's novel <i>Crash</i>, the more visceral and provocative the effect. The Normal understood this, and
    presented its mechanical erotica without feeling or judgment. ""In the Car Crash"" is a Merchant Ivory reading
    of the same story.</p><p>
    The instrumental ""Celsius"" returns to Chicago house for inspiration, and glossies the groove with some nods
    to Orbital, but ""I Dance Alone"", a duet between Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus and Carl Finlow, is the album's most
    egregious electroclash moment.  With a fuzzed-out bass, Kuperus' blank shouting, and Finlow's pining refrain,
    it stands as Swayzak's bid for a hit the size of Fischerspooner's ""Emerge"".  It's only on the slow electro-dub
    of ""Halfway to Yesterday"" that Swayzak evidence how innovative this album could have been.  Forgoing the
    expected indicators of digidub (reverbed rimshots, Pole-like distortion), Swayzak create a massive void
    through which their vocalist reminisces, as a cyborg harpsichord occasionally fills the void. They keep
    percussion to a bare minimum, making the listener feel as lost and abandoned as the vocalist-- it truly is
    21st Century dub.</p><p>
    Yet, realizing that their key audience might be bewildered by such innovation, Swayzak return to plink-plonk
    electroclash with the ghastly ""Take My Hand"". In recompense, Clair Dietrich's vocals imbue the tech-house
    ""Sob 1"" with languid jazz-- similar to labelmate Herbert's <i>Bodily Functions</i>-- but Dietrich's French
    purr can't hold even a penny candle to the beguiling honesty of Herbert's Dani Sciliano.  And then, <i>Dirty
    Dancing</i> closes with the immensely predictable ""Ping Pong"", sampling the primitive sounds of said video
    game as some plumy Brit repeats the title.  Though the album sparsely showcases what excellence Taylor and
    Brown are capable of, it mostly finds them lollygagging on paths well rutted by nag-drawn bandwagons.  Or,
    to put it more succinctly: their retro-futurism fails to make me chuckle in ironic solidarity.</p></div>"|7649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7649-dirty-dancing/|6.0|Paul Cooper

Those actors?  Not their real skin.  That lighting?  Doesn't actually
    exist in nature.  That big, stirring, extemporaneous speech that drove home the message?  Took ten takes
    and hours of editing.  Films can't help but trap reality in a sort of capsule that serves their purposes.
    I started thinking too much about this a few nights ago after catching some snippets of a James Bond movie
    during an epic channel-surf session at a friend's house.</p><p>
    
    The thing that struck me when we dropped in on the chase scene (Bond careening around Moscow in a stolen
    tank) was how graceful the accidents and crashes looked.  There was nothing violent about the impact of the
    police cars, even as the metal crumpled and twisted and the foley boomed in thunderous Dolby.  Stuntpeople
    even have a term for what they do with cars-- auto ballet-- which fairly gives away just how intricately
    staged and planned all of these catastrophic-looking events are.</p><p>
    
    I bring this up because ""graceful car wreck"" is the best term I can imagine to describe the sound of The
    Lot Six's sophomore album, <i>Animals</i>.  The first time you listen to it, it has the feel of a jumble--
    sounds crashing into each other and sections twisting unnaturally into other sections, but additional spins
    slowly reveal an intricately catastrophic piece of work that stands apart from the stuff other bands in this
    vein are doing.  The Boston quintet's basic starting points seem to be D.C. post-punk and emocore, and maybe
    some of that San Diego stuff like Drive Like Jehu, with a bit less math.  But to this they add a host of
    other elements that make it infinitely more interesting than most of the third-generation emo and math-rock
    that litters today's rockscape.</p><p>
<i>Animals</i> opens with the instrumental ""Skrahs"", a crunching attack that emits white-hot flecks of guitar
    that threaten to set the carpet on fire.  ""All So Nice to Know"" and ""Freezin' Scene"" open solidly, give way
    like crumple zones, and then explode like airbags and safety glass into shouting choruses full of splintered
    guitars and smashing drums.  It's impressive stuff, but a whole album of it would surely tire, and the band
    seems to realize this fact, arcing off at the album's midpoint into territory informed by everything from
    country to early-70s prog.</p><p>
    
    ""My Son"" is the first real departure, riding a propulsive cowpunk beat onto a big-skied plain slashed by
    huge swathes of destructive slide guitar.  ""Old Bass River Rd."" is the aftermath of the accident, a dejected
    lament on a place from a long-gone childhood, and closer ""Took My Place"" veers from its disco-punk intro
    into several tempo changes and thick briar patches of guitar without feeling forced.  Perhaps best of all,
    though, is ""The Tiniest Tin"", an icy piano-driven ballad that at times has a stately, almost classical
    feel.</p><p>
    
    There are times when The Lot Six's tightly controlled chaos gets the better of them, and there are a few
    spots that lack the invention that characterizes the rest of the album, but these are hardly common enough
    to kill the record, or even significantly hurt its momentum.  The Lot Six have struck an impressive balance
    of restraint and unpredictability here, resulting in a unique record with a wealth of stellar moments.  If
    only all wrecks could be this graceful.</p></div>"|4869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4869-animals/|7.4|Joe Tangari

    flat tone sounds like a washerwoman laboring over the drawers of the man who done her wrong.  Young People's
    debut album wallows in backwoods ambience, a fetishization of rural life with a kernel of the blues somewhere
    at its heart.  But the music they cut from this atmosphere is intriguing, and inventively realized.</p><p>
    
    This Los Angeles trio makes music not unlike Nina Nastasia's recent <i>The Blackened Air</i>, but grayer and
    grainier, with more jagged edges.  The band includes Eastburn on vocals and violin, and Jeff Rosenberg (Pink
    and Brown, Tarentel) and Jarrett Silberman (The Hansel &amp; Gretel Disease Forest) switching between guitars,
    drums, organ, and other instruments, sometimes clanking and rattling like rough sex in a tool shed, and
    other times plodding along like a chain gang.</p><p>
    
    The mood is thick and dreary: it's absorbing, but dangerously close to becoming a caricature of misery.  Of
    the twelve originals and one cover, almost every song is a ballad, dirge, work song, lament, or threnody--
    including the one genuine blues song, their grave-diggingly somber cover of Rev. Gary Davis' ""Death Don't
    Have No Mercy"".  And there's an edge of hipsterism that undercuts the starkness-- for example, they name the
    first track ""Ron Jeremy"", after the fun-to-namecheck porn star.  At least Leadbelly would have written ""The
    Ballad of Ron Jeremy"".</p><p>
    
    But one reason the album works is that these slow tunes and sturdy melodies are a framework for their spatterings
    of noise, which turn this into engrossing art-folk.  The guitars are raw and unsteady, playing bashing
    distortion on ""The Dishwasher"" or short creaks of feedback over ""The Pier"".  The drums often play not so
    much a beat or a pulse, but lumbering repetitions-- just as Eastburn's violin at the start of ""Repent"" is
    the weariest sawing I've ever heard.  Likewise, Eastburn's voice has a matter-of-fact plaintiveness that
    defines, but can also box in, her performance.</p><p>
    
    In contrast, the few times Young People do break the mood are revelatory, especially on the last three tracks.
    ""Collection"", and my personal favorite, ""Elizabeth Taylor"", break free with the horsepower of a brand-new
    pick-up truck, the lead guitar searing over Eastburn's reinvigorated voice.  And on ""Fly Seagull Fly"", when
    engineer Rod Cervera steps in to provide more conventionally rhythmic drums, Eastburn is pushed to a fine
    point of yearning.</p><p>
    
    Still, as much as this album can suck you in, it rarely connects.  It draws on styles that encourage empathy
    as much as sympathy, where you listen to singers spill their sob stories because they remind you of your own,
    and they pull you into a two-way exchange.  But Young People are more like a spectacle: you're detached from
    the sharp pain they describe, much as it seems like their music is detached from the folk and blues that it
    cribs from.  Maybe to get them in character for their next record, 5RC should sentence them to a couple years
    of hard labor.</p></div>"|8845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8845-young-people/|7.1|Chris Dahlen

    the genre we'll go ahead and call electroclash: the widespread misconception that this stuff is all
    hucksterism and schtick can be traced pretty directly back to her lyrics and Fischerspooner's stage wardrobe.
    The one possibly good thing, for our bar conversation and general sense that Something Is Happening, is that
    this makes her a little like The Strokes used to be: we all know she's out there, and most of us feel
    obligated to have some sort of opinion about that.  So now that her album, <i>The Teaches of Peaches</i>,
    has been re-released to the U.S. with a second disc of bonus material, and I've devised a brief questionnaire
    to help you sort out your feelings.</p><p>
    
    1. What is Peaches all about?</p><p>
    
    Sex. This starts with a triple-punch: you (a) look at her crotch on the cover, (b) put on the first track,
    which is called ""Fuck the Pain Away"", and then (c) Peaches leads in with the immortal words, ""Suckin' on my
    titties"": she doesn't work up to it at all. The remainder of the album includes a lot of grunting and
    squealing and songs about sucking on different things.</p><p>
    
    2. Am I meant to find that sexy, or revolting, or shocking, or what?</p><p>
    
    Peaches is really big on crotch-shots lately, only she's made it official Peaches policy not to shave her
    bikini line, so all of these crotch photos feature pubic hair straggling out under her panties and down her
    thigh. I'm guessing that, however you feel about that mental image-- hot, foul, offensive, or lame-- is
    pretty much how you'll feel about this record.</p><p>
    
    3. What, precisely, is the point of that?</p><p>
    
    There is an interesting aesthetic element to it: electro is captivated by the idea of machines as clean,
    perfect things, next to which the human body-- particularly sex-- seems messy and organic, maybe even scary
    or disgusting. Sweaty, sticky, hairy: this is the world of Peaches. It's possible, if you're so inclined,
    to read it as a performance-art take on pro-sex feminism; it's also possible to read Peaches as the sort of
    person who thinks she's ""challenging"" supposedly ""inhibited"" people, who are actually just indifferent,
    irritated by the crazy woman sticking her bits in their faces. Which of these is <i>actually</i> the case
    is not really important.</p><p>
    
    4. So is the music any good?</p><p>
    
    Sure, totally... it's pretty okay.  Just like the lyrics, the sounds are stripped down and dirty, all stiff,
    minimalist grime: here in the capitol of Electroclash sleaze are the echoes of post-punk electronic abuse,
    ghetto-tech booty-bass, and the grind-fests of the nastiest hip-hop. Remember how Salt 'n' Pepa's ""Push It""
    sounded when it came out-- all fuzzed-up and raunchy? This is what Peaches tends to shoot for.</p><p>
    
    And she's reasonably good about it, apart from one thing: her dedication to the sex-show antics sometimes
    comes at the expense of the tracks themselves, which makes her failures pretty grueling for the listener.
    ""Fuck the Pain Away"", on one hand, is great: big blurts of bass and stiff drums pump away under one of her
    better vamps (and better lyrics: ""I.U.D., S.I.S., stay in school, 'cause it's the best""-- good lord, is
    Peaches self-aware?).  The pure forward motion of ""Cum Undun"" actually manages to get off the ground a
    little, revving up progressively into one of Peaches' most effective tracks. On the other hand, you get
    stuff like ""Diddle My Skittle"", an interminable miasma of crawling beats, static noise, and dull babble.
    Yes, sure, there's ""only one Peach with the hole in the middle,"" but six tracks in, talk like that is pretty
    much just wallpaper.</p><p>
    
    Every track is memorable, though rarely on a musical level. ""AA XXX"" actually has an unconfident nuance to
    its sex-talk (that's double-A as in cup size, not stimulator batteries); ""Lovertits"" strips its beats down
    to the barest strut to accommodate that rather talented squeal, and ""Hot Rod"" milks a loving chuckle out of
    its chorus, which runs, ""Come on/ Hot rod/ Give me/ Your wad."" There are also some rock moments, like ""Rock
    Show"", which is way too much of a theatrical gag to work on a record, or the clumsy ""Sucker"", which I like
    to imagine certain people would be crazy about if only it were a lost Sleater-Kinney drum-machine demo.</p><p>
    
    5. What's up with the new material?</p><p>
    
    Covers, for one thing, which strikes me as a pretty lame thing for Peaches, of all people, to be doing.
    Jeans Team's ""Keine Melodien"" originally sounded like a robotic Prussian dictator stomping his army over a
    hill, where Peaches minimizes it to an ominous cruise; her version of Berlin's ""Sex (I'm A)"" invites
    unflattering comparisons with Teri Nunn. The only <i>new</i> track is ""Casanova"", which pairs Peaches up
    with Mignon for a surprisingly playful and girly romp.</p><p>
    
    And then there are remixes, obviously. Tobi Neumann's reworking of ""Set It Off"" bulks up the beat and adds
    actual dynamics, with which Peaches seems to have only a passing familiarity. You'd think Kid606 having his
    way with ""Fuck the Pain Away"" would be fascinating, but you'd be wrong: he's a lot more restrained than
    usual-- no splattering snare drums-- and he uses a lot of major-key loops to rewrite the track's fairly
    grim tone.  It's plunderphonia of the least order: ""Look at me, I worked a bunch of different samples
    together.""</p><p>
    
    Also, there are two videos.  Enjoy.</p><p>
    
    6. So should I buy it?</p><p>
    
    God, I have no idea. Do you prefer listening to stuff because it's ""interesting,"" or because it's ""good?""</p></div>"|6203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6203-the-teaches-of-peaches/|7.5|Nitsuh Abebe

    Reaganization of the Cold War had swung into full effect. The song, a swampy, pulsating chant about the
    inevitable genocide that will ensue, sooner or later, as a result of nuclear weaponry, went largely unheard
    in the U.S. due to poor distribution, until seeing reissue recently as a part of the Chicago-based Atavistic
    label's Unheard Music Series.  Twenty years on, the song now suddenly strikes with the same poignancy as it
    did upon release.</p><p>
    Yo La Tengo have always made cover songs an integral part of their repertoire, and the release of their
    four-track <i>Nuclear War</i> EP follows in that tradition. The song began showing up in live sets almost
    two years ago, but has just now been recorded. And while the band's tastes are sweeping and informed, never
    before has one of their covers been so apropos outside of its immediate rock context.</p><p>
    ""Nuclear War"" might not be a post-9/11 tribute, per se, but it rightly encapsulates the languid panic of a
    post-ironic America.  While Alan Jackson celebrates his inanity for foreign policy and Steve Earle proves
    himself too careerist to impact anything outside of his own record sales, Yo La Tengo see how beautifully
    this song summarizes our nation's apathetic despair: ""It's a motherfucker/ Don't you know/ If they push that
    button/ Yo ass gotta go.""</p><p>
    Poignancy aside, the single does dull the senses with its uncanny ability to become increasingly repetitive.
    Four distinct versions mark the single, and it's difficult to cross the finish line of one track knowing
    that ahead lies more of the same. The disc opens with the band chanting the song's mutating refrain for
    nearly eight minutes, accompanied by nothing more than tribal percussion. Sun Ra achieved an eeriness by
    only coolly stating the obvious, and with his relaxed delivery, he created an uneasy, irresistible tension.
    Yo La Tengo, however, have greatly accelerated the song itself, and stripped it of its fun.  On the opening
    track, they seem almost to be pleading for the message to be heard, and their somewhat morose delivery
    dilutes its power.</p><p>
    While the cacophonous horn trio on the 15-minute third version is perhaps musically the closest to Ra's
    original, version two is the best homage.  Although it's nothing more than version one's backing track with
    the addition of an otherworldly guitar loop and a choir of children in the call-and-response, the resulting
    track is almost devilishly cartoonish. Upon first listen, the children create a lighter atmosphere (and
    a hilarious ploy when saying ""motherfucker"" over and over), but as the song plays on, the kids don't seem
    quite so funny anymore. The naïveté involved in an actual nuclear assault sets in, and with every response
    from the children comes an increasingly unsettling feeling. The song conveys the realization that everyone's
    in the hot seat, not just the adults.  It's this twisted sense of structure that ultimately owes itself to
    Ra.</p><p>
    I won't get into version four too much, as it's just a remix by the admittedly incredible Mike Ladd, and
    seems to exist here solely as additional bang-for-the-buck.  It essentially closes the disc by rehashing
    the first three-quarters, adding a dubbed-out drone, a curious organ breakdown, and some additional
    percussion and effects.  Needless to say, after a straight half-hour of this already repetitive song, we
    just don't need to hear another take on it.</p><p>
    It's hard to point a finger at a band like Yo La Tengo because the intentions are obviously good. They do
    manage to kill two birds with one stone by revealing the coolness of their record collection while responding
    to a cultural state of affairs, but unfortunately, the results are less than stellar.  Lucky for us, we can
    still look forward to the pending full-length due early next year, which, if their previous four albums
    are any indication, will be another winner.</p></div>"|8866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8866-nuclear-war-ep/|5.9|Kyle Reiter

    the Harry-Crews-looking, homicidal constable in <i>Lone Star</i>, or the silly scruffs in <i>Blade II</i>
    and Tim Burton's toneless <i>Planet of the Apes</i> remake. Shame on those of us who only know him as the
    guy with the feathery hair on the cover of some album we saw stacked inside one of Mom's crapboard
    endtables alongside Lionel Richie, Air Supply, and those hunky Kenny's: Loggins and Rogers. Shame on us,
    because the very educated Kristofferson was an estimable American songwriter (though I have to pitch my
    tent across the field from those who'd label him one of the Greats).</p><p>
    
    Kristofferson's most impacting work strings together the observations of chronically defeated visionaries.
    These mini-martyrs can be absorbedly self-pitying, like prisoners who pay lip service to free livin', but
    their capacity for surrender yields some powerfully fatalistic evaluations of hope. ""Jesus Was a Capricorn""
    is possibly the best synthesis of Kristofferson's concerns (Low's messianic hypothesis ""If You Were Born
    Today"" owes this tune a debt), and Diana Darby's minimal, whispered rendition is only one of the reasons
    this compilation trumps 2002's other Kris-nod <i>Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down</i>. This disc's roster
    is largely a who's-who of subdued alt-folk-rock, both traditional and progressive.</p><p>
    
    Souled American's slop-twinkle handling of the last-chance anthem ""Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends""
    is both brainy and sentimental, ideal for those fidgety hours before one's pride allows them to hit the bar
    or bottle. Both Califone offerings, ""Borderlord"" and ""Nobody Wins"" (the latter a team-up with Rebecca Gates)
    prove my thesis that this band doesn't know how to bore: they use all manner of digital manipulation, yet
    still sound earthy and interplanetary, yet symphonic and hymnal, despite their static-blasts. They contrast
    overstated and understated percussion, they strain pianos-- they even serve up some phased Olivia Tremor
    Control transitions.</p><p>
    
    Calexico defies their predictable cactus-funk formula by adding an amazingly sour organ tone and
    Nico-versus-Marlene-Dietrich vixen vox to ""Casey's Last Ride"". Radar Brothers' deservedly increasing fanbase
    should pounce all over their panoramic ""Help Me Make It Through the Night"", and if my ears don't lie, that's
    Brother Jim Putnam's thin-soul throat fronting a much warmer Court &amp; Spark on their ""For the Good Times""
    (one of at least three songs about opportunistic ex-couples saying ""What the hey, let's get it on"").</p><p>
    
    The showoffs in Zmrzlina and Milkchopper create the comp's richest soundscapes, mixing six-string theatrics
    with windshield wipers, drum tracks, radio samples, anxious keys, doleful strings, and layered, coed vocals.
    Their pairing deconstructs Kristofferson's most famous song to the point of redefinition, editing the refrain
    down to, ""Freedom's just another word for nothing.""</p><p>
    
    The rest acquit themselves as well: Richard Buckner is a moving fit for the strumming ""Loving Her Was Easier""
    ; Crooked Jades make a hootenanny of ""Shipwrecked in the Eighties"".  Virgil Shaw and Howe Gelb both tip their
    hats amenably to the outsider ethos, but Deanna Varagona threatens to over-sing Kris' great line about
    ""seeking salvation we don't understand."" Creeper Lagoon's ""Why Me"" and the Handsome Family's ""Sunday Morning
    Coming Down"" are decent, but labor in the shadows of Johnny Cash's and Crooked Fingers' recent revisitations.
    Only Grandaddy's power-trio take on ""Best of All Possible Worlds"" (the polar opposite of the version from
    <i>Bernstein's Candide</i>) reeks of sleepwalkers' drool.</p><p>
    
    You could insert a lengthy rumination on the futility/plurality of tribute compilations here, but recall
    that the oft-covered Kristofferson reportedly wrote a song called ""Let's All Get Together and Steal Each
    Other's Songs"".  To their considerable credit, most of the artists on this austere compilation strive to
    give a little back.</p></div>"|4539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4539-nothing-left-to-lose-a-tribute-to-kris-kristofferson/|7.6|William Bowers

Often mismatched on the bill, these poor souls
    know you're not there to see them, and that most of the audience will spend their set impatiently clicking
    their Indiglos to gauge how much longer until the main attraction takes the stage.  And then there's the
    pressure of realizing they've got just this one chance to reach everyone in the venue-- if their set doesn't
    go well, they've likely lost potential audience members for good, and even if it does, it's a crap-shoot as
    to whether or not any new fans will jump on board.</p><p>
    
    Every once in a while, though, the opening act just nails it: the audience matches up, the performance kills,
    and just enough confidence gets projected from the stage to distract from the passage of time and win a few
    mailing list signees.  I caught the Mobius Band opening for Hood and Surface of Eceon about nine months ago,
    and this is pretty much exactly what happened.  I came in wondering who they were, and walked out with a copy
    of their second numerically titled EP, the hand-packaged <i>Two</i>.  And it mostly lived up to their show,
    with a few pleasantly surprising twists and turns thrown in.  The band's kitchen sink blend of everything
    from fusion-era Miles to prime Kraut groove to glitch to straight-up rock was pursued from a fresh angle,
    and their exploratory, amateurish approach was charming.</p><p>
    
    With the release of <i>Three</i>, their third EP in two years, the Massachusetts trio make the jump into the
    world of labels and grow fully into their sound, eradicating nearly every inconsistency found on their past
    releases.  The speed of the band's progress is stunning.  I won't even venture to imagine where they'll be
    in another year.  Opener ""Frozen Lake in Unison"" is a fairly basic instrumental-- choppy drums, loosely wielded
    guitars, some background glockenspiel tinkling and a vaguely jazzy feel, but the recording renders it much
    deeper, utilizing the ambience of the room it was recorded in (and the freeway, if I'm hearing things correctly)
    and samples of indecipherable conversation to open the composition up.</p><p>
    
    ""Burnoff"" surges forth in its wake, swathed in sheets of buzzing analogue synth, underlined by a cutting,
    tonally limited bassline.  There's a deceptively infectious pop song hiding in all the buzz, though, and
    that's what really makes it work.  The Mobius vocal chops are up of late, and they've crafted their most
    immediate melody for the occasion here.  The upward quality arc continues with the gorgeous acoustic guitar
    and crunchy beats of ""Arrows"".  Uneasy string samples flutter in and out of the background, haunting the
    laid-back vocal melody and ultimately taking over the song as the drum kit rises over the programming to
    bring everything to an unsettled conclusion.</p><p>
    
    ""Well-Thumbed Page"" simultaneously offers a nod to the American Analog Set and a wink to Autechre, while the
    impassioned strumming of ""Snow on Snow"" puts you in the austere beauty and calm of a winter landscape without
    turning your fingers blue.  The EP closes with ""Plastic Pillar"", a creeping thing that opens with harmonics,
    slippery beats and barely audible ambient voices, and ultimately morphs into a pulverizing assault led by
    overdriven drums and topped-out VU meters.</p><p>
    
    With <i>Three</i>, the Mobius Band have definitively disproved their own punny moniker, proving that they
    do, in fact, have more than one side.  As they continue to focus their sound and hone their craft, I have
    no doubt they'll emerge as a force to be reckoned with.  For now, they're certainly one worth listening to.</p></div>"|5341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5341-three-ep/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    Arts in Devon, England. During the early 80s, he drifted from painting and
    sculpture to music, and began working with old and discarded turntables.
    Though he's roughly a contemporary of Christian Marclay, recognition for
    Jeck came much later, beginning in 1993 with his massive installation ""Vinyl
    Requiem"", which incorporated 180 record players and multiple film projections.
    Since then, he's released several solo records for Touch and the German label
    Intermedium, and has collaborated with Otomo Yoshihide, among many others.</p><p>
    
    Much of Jeck's solo output is culled from edits of live performances. Using
    a number of battered turntables, a Casio keyboard, and a CD player or minidisc,
    Jeck creates dense, pulsating sound collages from the grooves of ancient and
    forgotten records. Like Yoshihide and Marclay, Jeck is no DJ. Though he stands
    over his decks with headphones on, his intention and methods with records has
    nothing to do with beat-matching or spinning tunes. Records are truly just sound
    sources for Jeck, raw material to be shaped via mixer and effects into his
    ghostly compositions.</p><p>
    
    Listening to his most recent album, <i>Stoke</i>, it's hard not to think about
    Jeck's background in visual art, and how it informs his audio work. There's
    something very cinematic about these pieces, though the music sounds nothing
    like a soundtrack. Some of the visual referencing could come from the regular
    pops and scrapes in the vinyl, which are reminiscent of the sound of a spool
    of film being fed into a projector. Jeck's endlessly rotating platters, like
    the whirr of moving film, serve as a constant reminder of the time-based nature
    of the medium. These pieces <i>happen</i>, and all you can do as a listener is
    try to extract information before they fade back into nothingness. You have to
    listen close and listen often.</p><p>
<i>Stoke</i> finds Jeck more in the realm of focus and refinement. While the
    tracks in his ""Vinyl Coda"" series (worth checking out, by the way) ranged from
    20 to 60 minutes, the seven distinct pieces here average less than eight. The
    relatively tight construction of the tracks means that Jeck can hone in on a
    single sonic idea and amplify it, extracting the maximum amount of emotional
    material from a few grimy loops. ""Pax"" is an uncharacteristically minimal
    piece combining a simple organ refrain and slowed-down vocals, possibly from
    an old gospel 78.  The keyboard is very clean-sounding and might not be
    sourced from a record, but it perfectly complements the churched-up feel of
    the warped vocal, stretching the anguish of the indecipherable lyric to its
    breaking point.</p><p>
    
    ""Close"" uses ancient recordings of sacred music from another culture to
    beautiful effect, this time the ringing sounds of Indian classical. The
    undisciplined hiss of a loose sitar string is clipped to ribbons, then
    looped and recombined to sound like a warning, some indeterminate alarm
    sounding through a Himalayan valley. The piece takes a stunning left turn
    in its final quarter, turning to a loop of surface noise with an echoing
    and unbearably lonesome vocal floating on top.</p><p>
    
    ""Lambing"" is Jeck in drone mode, patiently adding and removing layers of
    sound and noise whose vinyl sources remain a complete mystery. The style on
    ""Lambing"" could be considered Jeck's signature, and it's amazing what he
    accomplishes through additive processes. There's something wonderfully
    machine-like about the operation. Since Jeck has the entire world of sound
    at his disposal, he has to figure how much of it to let in at any given
    moment, like mixing air with fuel inside a carburetor.  <i>Stoke</i> proves
    him a master mechanic.</p></div>"|4226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4226-stoke/|8.4|Mark Richardson

The true cost, the human cost, the material cost?  Few can say.
    From what I hear on the Internet, though, the band is damn cute (especially that
    drummer, Mikey!). Telegenic, even.  They're also vaguely ""punk"" (more screamo than
    anything else), which makes them the perfect talent for this sitcom I've been
    developing.  Here's the pitch: ""The Angular Family""!  Four strapping exemplars of
    today's disjointed youth all living under the same roof!  Sometimes heart-wrenching,
    always hilarious!  You don't even have to write a script, for Christ's sake, just
    take some of the more intelligible lines from <i>Chimera</i> and, you know, put 'em
    together.  Eg., Episode I (Stephen Bites Off His Own Tongue):</p><p>

    eating Cheerios, when STEPHEN runs in.]</i></p><p>
    
    STEPHEN: All is not well!</p><p>
    
    SEAN: All hands attention!  This plane's going down!</p><p>
    
    STEPHEN: The last three weeks have been a drawn-out train wreck!  As time sheds
    its bruises I'm left in its wake!</p><p>
    
    SEAN: I have reoccurring nightmares of dying in airplanes!</p><p>
    
    MIKE [Looks to the camera, smiles]:  This is not the worst part!</p><p>
<i>[cue laugh track]</i></p><p>
    
    Gold!  Maybe they can even bring the band thing into the show, a little
    anti-Partridge action, though they'd have to work on the music.  Okay,
    I mean, sure, they're angular, angular like a Cubist fox, but is it <i>good</i>
    angular?  Angles have to be put in the proper places to make shapes, and the
    math has to work out right (180 degrees in a triangle, 360 in a square); you
    can't just stick them anywhere you want.  And you sure as hell can't announce
    almost every tempo- or time-signature change with a full-band pause.</p><p>
    
    I mean, sometimes these kids break my heart-- following that chiseled Fugaz-ish
    drum intro on the first track with all that flabby distortion and flatly
    declamatory angst, or periodically dragging ""Left in Its Wake"" down into
    a slower tempo just for the sake of math.  It's a shame, really; on the more
    straightforward rock tracks (""Hated Man"") and the ones that sustain the quiet
    side of the dynamics see-saw (""Symptomatic""), the band's anger actually sounds
    like something more than Drive Like Jehu on autopilot.</p><p>
    
    And the target audience: Kids!  Kids love angles!  And maybe if we can squeeze
    a few more ""relationship"" issues into the script (I assume they've got them,
    though I can't make heads or tails of those lyrics), maybe a life-threatening
    disease or two, we could probably hook the older crowd who were too freaked out
    by Frodus when they were doing the same thing five years ago.  So are you sold
    or what?</p></div>"|1613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1613-chimera/|3.9|Brendan Reid

    the next psych-pop explosion. The psych strongholds of old-- the Bay Area, East Texas, Canterbury, etc--
    won't do; they have too much history and too few new ideas.  No, a genre that has fallen on such hard times
    of late needs a fresh start in a fresh place.  I suggest Bloomington, Indiana. Now, I'll admit I'm more than
    a little biased; I used to live there, and in a lot of ways, I still think of it as my home. But putting as
    much bias as I can aside, there's a band there that I think could lead the next charge of paisley frock.
    They're called the Impossible Shapes.</p><p>
<i>Laughter Fills Our Hollow Dome</i> is the Impossible Shapes' second proper full-length and it's got enough
    catchy, bouncy melodies to make Robert Schneider sully his Osh-Koshes, and enough of a fuzzy lo-fi glow to
    make Will Hart re-bury his tape recorder. Lyrically, Shapes frontman Chris Barth writes like Bob Pollard
    drunk on Krishnamurti tomes, and his voice recalls a boyish, Midwestern George Harrison.  ""Spirits Enter"",
    ""Dancing in Heaven"", and ""Graceful Arc"" combine a ecumenical spiritualism with a fondness for analog keyboards
    and hazy pop. ""Jesus and Squares"" sets a more ominous tone, ending with the words, ""Try and love everything
    that is not dead""-- it'd stand as a recollection of a bad trip if not for the rousing, galloping rhythm that
    powers it.</p><p>
    ""Go Somewhere Beautiful"", a two-parter bridged by a spiraling keyboard-driven interlude, is almost as pure
    a picture of naïve hippie optimism as could be hoped for in these troubled times and, as such, is this close
    to being a defiant protest song.  ""Look for an Opening"" and ""Found a Sister"", on the other hand, have a
    whimsical, almost Broadway musical style recalling Love's Brian Maclean.  Meanwhile, ""Another Flooded Dream""
    and ""Supermaze"" show the Shapes stretching out into collage-style chaos-- like their forbearers in Olivia
    Tremor Control were fond of doing-- without losing sight of the song.</p><p>
    And indeed, The Song is always primary with these guys.  Even when they do momentarily stray from it in
    order to modulate the perspective or bring a revealing distortion into play, it demonstrates just how strong
    the songs are in their underlying foundations.  These detours never sound distracting or gratuitous like is
    so often the case when a ""song"" band wants to get ""way out"" and ""blow your mind"" with some ""spacey jams"".
    Rather, all experimentation is brought into the service of the song itself.  Regular acid-eating Hoagy
    Carmichaels, these kids.</p><p>
    ""Across the River"", while not one of the most instantly memorable songs on the album, might be its spiritual
    center. A short, simple song, beautifully wrought from acoustic guitar, piano, and organ, Barth and multi-instrumentalist
    Aaron Deer trade off singing the refrain, ""Inside this great home."" And that's what this album does best:
    it transports you fully into a dream-like world, a home built of warm, full sound and winding corridors of
    melody. And when it's over, and you're back in the harsh real world, all you want to do is revisit the world
    of <i>Hollow Dome</i> where things are simple and beautiful.</p><p>
    Psychedelic pop may not be in vogue at the moment, and Elephant 6 folding was just a symbol of this change
    in the musical climate, but that doesn't mean there aren't still a number of good-- or even great-- psych-pop
    bands keeping the dream of '67 alive, and without being too awfully retro about it. A number of musicians
    who sprung from the fertile soil of the Elephant 6 collective continue to make compelling music (Will Hart's
    Circulatory System and Jeremy Barnes' various projects, for example), not to mention the various (heavier)
    psych bands coming out of the Philadelphia area. And then there are relative newcomers like the Memphis-based
    Snowglobe and the Impossible Shapes from Bloomington. Hopefully, these bands will stick it out to reap the
    rewards when the winds of popular taste inevitably turn back their way.</p></div>"|4084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4084-laughter-fills-our-hollow-dome/|8.5|Jason Nickey

    to almost 70 minutes. But San Francisco five piece Tarentel, whatever their other virtues, have mastered the
    difficult practice of patience. Like Labradford, they know that getting there is half the, well... I guess
    ""fun"" is probably the wrong word.  Let's just say that the journey is its own reward. These songs take their
    time.</p><p>
    
    The first thing you'll notice if you come to Tarentel through last year's album <i>The Order of Things</i>
    (like I do) is that these tracks are comparatively skeletal. No orchestral flourishes, vocals or scratchy
    field recording samples here. <i>Ephemera</i> is basically guitar, bass, drums and a little keyboard, with
    heavy emphasis on the guitar. Somewhere after the time of <i>Spiderland</i>, indie musicians the world over
    fell completely in love with the sound of a plucked electric patched into a nice amp, and decided that this
    simple sound, slowly moving through the notes of a chord, one by one, was enough to serve as the focal point
    for a 10+ minute piece of music.</p><p>
    
    This attitude made songs like this record's opener, ""The Waltz"", possible. The first seven minutes or so are
    little more than the guitarist walking through the chords, slowly and steadily. Of course, then Tarentel has
    the good sense to add some grumbling organ chords and then finally a distorted blast of guitar noise about
    12 minutes in, nicely releasing the tension of the lengthy build. The peaks and valleys of ""Looking for
    Things"" are much more subtle, reminding me a lot of Mogwai circa <i>Come On Die Young</i> (which equals
    ""boring"" for me, sorry).</p><p>
    
    My favorite two tracks are the shortest. Both parts of ""Two Sides of Myself"" come from a seven-inch single,
    and run a little over six minutes each. The seriously bent guitar notes on the first part remind me a lot
    of Pink Floyd's soundtrack work. There's an ""Age of Aquarius"", European hippie vibe that lends an aura of
    mystery, which the cymbal washes make even more explicit. Part two begins with ripples of some <i>very</i>
    controlled and quiet feedback and then spreads out from there.  This is Tarentel in pure drone mode, close
    to the bliss world of Windy &amp; Carl.</p><p>
    
    The closer is the 24-minute ""Searching for Things"" (are these the same things that were ordered for last
    year's album?), an odd choice for a single by any measure, which impressively glides slowly from one section
    the next, folding in all kinds of ominous guitar noises as it grows ever more moody and dark. I won't say
    it never gets a little dull, but I've heard worse side-length tracks. As for the collection as a whole,
    nice stuff, but I have a hard time being drawn completely into this world. There's something a bit vague
    and uncertain about the tracks that deadens their emotional impact, despite how nice they sound.</p></div>"|7942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7942-ephemera/|7.0|Mark Richardson

We don't care about anything.  We don't even care about
    <i>ourselves</i>.  We blew through our dotcom cash and we're still stuck with our student loans.  Our biggest
    political moment was turning Ralph Nader into a presidential spoiler.  And now, justice comes swiftly knocking.
    It is time to face that which we fear the most: the second coming of Lollapalooza's grunge-rock all-stars.</p><p>
    
    Recent days have seen the re-emergence of an eerie number of megacelebrity has-beens-- from Jane's Addiction
    backing Courtney Love on tour, to Krist Novoselic joining forces with Meat Puppeteer Curt Kirkwood in Eyes
    Adrift-- combining their powers in the hopes of forming one mightier superbeast.  And yea, we have seen these
    bands and known our sins, and the discipline was just and fair.  But repent we did not.  And so, as further
    castigation, we now find ourselves faced with the ultimate grievance: Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell
    assuming vocal duties for Urban Outfitters politicos Rage Against the Machine.  Let the punishment fit the
    crime.</p><p>
    
    The story goes that sometime after Zach de la Rocha dropped out of Rage, Cornell agreed to be the new
    singer, so long as they ditched their political bent and changed their name.  And based on the evidence,
    losing the politics doesn't hurt the music: as Cornell proves here time and again, he can still voraciously
    belt the most inane lyrical tragedies with such conviction that you'd almost think they meant something were
    it not for such giveaways as, ""Pearls and swine bereft of me,"" and, ""Heaven waits for those who run/ Down
    your winter and underneath your waves/ Where you watch and wait.""  It's also amusing to note that after
    years of playing the hardcore leftist, overeducated liberator of jailed antiheroes, Tom Morello gladly
    dropped the message from his music in lieu of playing venues that don't hang their name on a Schlitz sign.</p><p>
    
    Bassist Tom Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk fall in line, but it's Cornell that's made a bitch out of all
    of them-- from forcing them to cancel a slot on the Ozzfest bill, to sticking them with the most asinine
    bandname of the year.  (It was Cornell's idea to dub this bloated masturbathon Audioslave, and the name says
    everything with the same exacting precision that it says nothing at all.  Audioslave.  It's like it was
    tailor-made for a Sam Goody voiceover.)  It's kind of incredible how slick and lifeless the Rage band sounds
    without de la Rocha spitting all over everything.  The guys just autopilot their way through the most generic
    hard rock possible behind Cornell's Dio-like wailing about highways and death and more highways.  Morello
    tries to stick out with his wanky solos, but all his effort amounts to little more than an indulgent novelty.</p><p>
    
    He, of course, is less an embarrassment than Cornell.  Now, I'll freely admit being a Soundgarden fan: I
    remember when all the guys admired his politically correct take on machismo, and all the girls swooned at
    his hairy good looks and dreamed of just ripping the flannel right off him.  To be fair, his voice sounds
    great, even after years of larynx-shredding throat-gore.  The effect, unfortunately, is lost when you realize
    that all the lyrics are complete gibberish.  ""Set if off/ Set it off, my children.""  ""I will wait for you/
    Like a stone/ I will wait for you there/ Alone.""  Or best of all: ""I am a virus!""  He also rips off some
    pseudo-spiritual lyrics from the latest Christian grunge bands, which is ironic because... well, you know
    the drill: the student becomes the teacher, and they all ride the short bus together.</p><p>
    
    Sure, the pulsing noises and rumbling groan that open ""Set It Off"" sound wicked, and ""Bring 'Em Back Alive""
    and ""Getaway Car"" almost don't suck.  You could even say that, technically, Audioslave ""rock"".  But they do
    so emptily, predictably, and without a single new idea.  Producer Rick Rubin has fashioned a synthesized
    rock-like product that emits no heat. It's the worst kind of studio rock album, rigorously controlled--
    even undercut-- by studio gimmickry; the rare instances during which the band starts to let go (the end of
    ""Shadow on the Sun"") are incidental and abruptly cut off.</p><p>
    
    At its worst, this project is just plain retarded.  On ""Show Me How to Live"", Audioslave snatch the opening
    chords from Simple Minds' ""Don't You (Forget About Me)""-- try keeping the ""hey hey hey hey"" out of your head
    during this thing-- and <i>then</i> cop the riff from Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way"".  Top this hall-of-fame
    moment of classic un-inspiration with a bridge that consists solely of heavily processed violin, and the
    fact that the song features Cornell yelling to his creator, ""You gave me life, now show me how to live!""
    Was it too much to ask for some effort?  Were we already pressing our luck that these guys even got together?</p><p>
    
    And it's so frustrating because Cornell would be better suited to virtually anything else.  The man would
    sound more at home dueting with Shania.  Listen to that!  I'm in <i>awe</i> of his lungs.  He belts these
    songs like they never went out of style, like he's still got that curly <i>Louder Than Love</i>-era mane
    thrown back and glistening, like he wants to shake the studio to its very foundation with the power of all
    his gristled fury-- when all of a sudden, the effects kick in and morph his voice into a fucking sitar!  It
    just might be the most ridiculous and ill-timed production trick of his career.  And all I can picture is
    Cornell high-fiving Rick Rubin and hitting the beach to play volleyball with Creed.</p><p>
    
    Duck, because America's gonna vomit.</p></div>"|356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/356-audioslave/|1.7|Chris Dahlen & Ryan Schreiber

After suffering
    through bible-thumper extraordinaire and vocalist Scott Stapp waxing rhapsodic on Matthew 3:12 and its
    significance in contemporary media, Stapp was asked how the band felt about Radiohead.  ""Yes, we are
    definitely Radiohead fans. When interviewers ask you what your favorite band is, Radiohead is a really good
    thing to say to them.""</p><p>
 As a general guideline, I try to avoid reviews before I've fully absorbed an album.  In the case of the new
    Botch EP, however, ignoring the swell of overwhelming praise from my cluster of devoted intellimetal friends
    proved impossible.  I'd heard so much hyperbole from armchair reviewers on the quality of
 <i>
  An Anthology of
    Dead Ends
 </i>
 that I quickly pushed it to the front of my Pitchfork priorities list.  Little did I know that
    I'd already heard all of these songs before and, surprisingly, from shittier mainstream bands with less indie
    cred.</p><p>
 As I sat down to draft this review, I had a startling revelation: Botch, Isis, Converge, the Dillinger Escape
    Plan, Cave In, and most of the Hydra Head crew, while not on a commercial par with Radiohead by any means,
    are names typically dropped because they sound good to the fairweather metal fan: hard rock that's loud,
    brash, and angry, but without any of those nasty Satanism questions from your folks.
</p><p>
 In case they've managed to fly under your radar for the past nine years, Botch was a four-piece hardcore-metal
    meld out of Seattle with guitarist David Knudson, vocalist Dave Verellen, drummer Tim Latona, and bassist
    Brian Cook.  Botch released two fantastic metalcore albums in 1999 and 2000 entitled
 <i>
  American Nervoso
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  We Are the Romans
 </i>
 , respectively.  Both albums pushed mathematical metal to a wider audience,
    crafting dense walls of sound with off-kilter rhythms and snarling vocals in a more accessible manner than
    their Hydra Head counterparts.  Through jilted tempos, filthy riffs, and even an improbable cover of ""Rock
    Lobster"", Botch carved out a solid niche with a loyal fanbase.
</p>
<p>
 Picking up my copy of
 <i>
  An Anthology of a Dead End
 </i>
 , my attention was immediately drawn to the track
    titles:  ""Spaim"", ""Japam"", ""Framce"", ""Vietmam"", ""Afghamistam"", and ""Micaragua""-- the kind of nursery school
    cipher that might have come from a book on combinations and permutations authored by Richard Scarry.
    Opening with a 14-second guitar intro, ""Spaim"" signals Botch's entrance to a professional downward spiral
    that concludes with a fiery crash into a mountain twenty minutes later.  Where the Dillinger Escape Plan at
    least hinted at the possibility of a creative future with their four-track EP,
 <i>
  Irony is a Dead Scene
 </i>
 ,
    earlier this year, Botch opted for a series of safe plays to close out their career in the least offensive,
    and more importantly, least memorable way possible.  Make no mistake,
 <i>
  Anthology
 </i>
 is undoubtedly a
    hardcore album; despite a handful of prodigious flashes, this is math-metal for kids on the short bus.
</p>
<p>
 All the middle-class, white-male posturing and angst is very much in place but minus the intrigue.  ""Japam""
    is short attention span theatre at its worst, crashing through a number of uninspired chord changes between
    hardcore and lazy pulse with violent wails, churning pop punk riffs, and insipid drums.  It's all so
    predictable that one could train the ear to identify this supposed experimentation as Botch's brand of
    verse/chorus/verse.  Sure, it's all negative, ominous, and assuredly very angry but where's the weenie?
    Guess what-- there isn't one. Spend two minutes with the first actual song on the disc and you've got a
    master's understanding of all the tricks and textural and temporal variation present on
 <i>
  An Anthology of
    Dead Ends
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 ""Framce"" and ""Vietmam"" are the two closest approximations to Botch circa 2000.  While the desire to embrace
    conventionality is still present, it's handled in a more organic way.  In the case of ""Vietmam"", the
    methodical approach pays off.  Through a poetic mechanism of guitar and bass, the track plods ahead with
    far more minimal orchestration and greater flexibility.  Strong colors, harmonizing riffs, false starts,
    false stops, and taste abound, elements sorely lacking on most of
 <i>
  Anthology
 </i>
 .  Knudson's guitar work
    is liquid and naturalistic while Cook and Latona move solidly through an unorthodox cadence with ease and
    intricacy.
</p>
<p>
 ""Afghamistam""-- which could as easily have been titled ""Smore"", ""Borimg"", or ""Pomderous""-- marks Botch's
    lone foray into post-four-minute territory.  Not only does this track fail miserably as an attempt at
    multi-dimensionality, but it's so chockfull of pretension that one might expect a grinning, fawning Burt
    Bacharach to emerge from the bombed-out rubble of Kamdahar.  Replete with piano, sullen lyrics, and
    schmaltzy string orchestration, this track would try the patience of even the most devoted fanboy.
</p>
<p>
 Botch's career comes to a close with ""Micaragua"", another cute and ineffectual hardcore ditty-- including a
    suitably unimpressive drum solo from Cook-- with the stamp of trivial alterna-metal trash a la Mudvayne and
    Mushroomhead. It's worth highlighting that every note on the album is produced exceptionally well for a
    self-avowed DIY band.  In addition to possessing an extremely tight dynamic, the nuances of every instrument
    are clear and distinct (translation: slick and phony).  This album so blatantly panders to a moderate,
    fail-safe audience it couldn't be packaged any other way.
</p>
<p>
 I'll readily admit that I've never been in love with Dave Verellen's purposefully awkward metaphors, or any
    of the band's calculated noisecore pretexts.  Still, it seemed plausible that the same band who had recorded
    the menacingly vague ""Mondrian Was Liar"", invoked Dali and John Woo on
 <i>
  American Nervosa
 </i>
 , and Orff's
    ""Carmina Burana"" on
 <i>
  The Unifying Themes of Sex, Death and Religion
 </i>
 didn't shoot its wad two years
    ago.  In the course of listening to the same six tracks for nearly four weeks, I realized that Botch had
    simply exhausted their capabilities as a unit.  Mercifully, Knudson and Verellen recognized their limitations,
    forced out a contrived and forgettable 20 minutes of music, and decided to move on to greener pastures.  To
    all you tepid metalheads fond of referencing this fallen pack of übergeeks-with-attitude, fear not, you've
    still got several dozen pariahs with overdrive pedals to cling to.

    of drawing the RIAA's ire and endangering your ability to hold political office in the future?  Dust off a
    vinyl copy of Death Cab's 1999 debut <i>Something About Airplanes</i>, dig out that old Fisher-Price record
    player (the tan-colored one with the fat needle), stick a pillow over the speaker, and play it at about 27
    rpm.  Wal-la!</p><p>
    
    This Mr. Wizard solution works because the meat of <i>You Can Play These Songs with Chords</i> is a reissue
    of the band's treasured demo tape of the same name, eight ultra-lo-fi recordings released on cutting-edge
    cassette format back in the simpler times of 1998 when said band was comprised only of Ben Gibbard and Chris
    Walla.  Five of the eight songs later turned up with increased fidelity on the official debut, <i>Something
    About Airplanes</i>, and like most of that album, the representatives here contain at least one great moment
    surrounded by a lot of mere goodness: the envelope-glue sweetness of organ-laced ""President of What?"", the
    subtle guitar melody shift a minute into ""Champagne in a Paper Cup"", the ""I'm def-in-ite-ly shaking"" segment
    of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"".</p><p>
    
    So, these five tracks were obviously enough to plant the seeds for a happy indie label contract, but what of
    the other three?   Well, two of them (the surprisingly punk-paced ""That's Incentive"" and pleasantly forgettable
    ""Hindsight"") weren't done much injustice by languishing in obscurity, but ""Two Cars"" was worth digging out of
    the attic.  Melancholy/playful organ complementing Gibbard's nice guy vocals, simple Walla-brand production,
    and non-flashy drumming keep the song appropriately approachable-- it's almost mopey-friend enough to fit on
    the band's high water mark <i>We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes</i>.</p><p>
    
    Eight songs and twenty-nine minutes leave a lot of blank disc space, though, so Barsuk has graciously filled
    out the package with assorted breakup-rumor-starting rarities, to the point of outweighing the featured
    material 10-to-8.  Too bad the first five of these are, frankly, rather embarrassing, representing an era
    that suggests the image of Death Cab as high school band playing graduation parties.  Heretofore unknown
    tendencies to sound like a) They Might Be Giants fans (""TV Trays,"" ""Tomorrow""), b) by-numbers pop-punk
    (""New Candles,"" an unwisely suped-up ""This Charming Man"" cover), and c) vocal sample experimentalists
    (""Flustered/Hey Tomcat"") all come back to haunt, like yearbook photos from when you used to part your
    hair.</p><p>
    
    The latter five tracks, collecting seven-inch odds-and-sods for vinyl-phobes, fare a bit better, as they
    feature later incarnations of DCFC more confident in their dreamy sound.  ""State Street Residential"" and
    ""Army Corps of Architects"" are wobbly first steps exploring the vaguely slowcore epic approach employed on
    the <i>Stability</i> EP, while the cover of Secret Stars' ""Wait"" is obvious, but plays to DCFC's strengths
    when they put their guitar thang down, flip it, and reverse it (er, subtly) all over the coda.  An early
    version of ""Song for Kelly Huckaby"" is the one useless inclusion of this quintet, which otherwise as a
    package comes close to the fine <i>Forbidden Love</i> EP, but without a clearly essential standout like
    that release's ""Photobooth"" (the two-tiered ""Prove My Hypotheses"", however, comes close).</p><p>
    
    These last few tracks raise the ownability of <i>You Can Play These Songs with Chords</i> considerably,
    but it's still not really a must-have collection for anyone that doesn't have a Ben Gibbard shrine in
    the corner of their dorm room.  In fact, the release of this early material would be <i>most</i> useful
    as a reminder to the band themselves that they always sounded better recording in a living room, blanketing
    their output in warm hiss and simple rhythms.  And while the recent departure of overcompensating drummer
    Michael Schorr may have already pointed them in this direction, a listen to their own reissue certainly
    couldn't hurt.</p></div>"|2226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2226-you-can-play-these-songs-with-chords/|6.4|Rob Mitchum

The kind with guitars, anyway.  Too many bands
    can't get over their fascination with the classic rock originators, or worse, their emulation of
    second-generation bands already over-obsessed with the 60s.  The harvest is so scarce, I've been forced
    to turn to <shudder> the IDM boroughs, where Max Tundra and Schneider TM are making the best sticky melodies
    in unusual settings I've heard this leaf-shedding season.</shudder></p><p>
    
    UK band Simian might be an exception to this trend, though, a predominantly guitar-based pop-rock band
    that somehow doesn't fall easily into my preset compartments.  For the first time in a while, I can actually
    write about such a group without referencing Elephant 6-- um, except for that mention, I guess.  The
    comparison is tempting, however; when my friend first introduced me to <i>We Are Your Friends</i>, he said
    he'd heard that it was a side project of an Apples in Stereo member.  That this wasn't true was pretty clear
    after one listen-- even the most convention-toeing Simian tracks are far more interesting than any Apples
    product in recent memory.</p><p>
<i>We Are Your Friends</i> might not be a completely successful album, but it's rarely less than a compelling
    one.  Simian manages this by embracing musical innovation more recent than <i>Pet Sounds</i>, most notably in
    their use of computerized rhythm tracks to flesh out the sunshine daydream, leaning more on the sampler than
    the spacey psychedelics of their debut, <i>Chemistry Is What We Are</i>.  Right, sounds like fellow British
    casserole chefs Super Furry Animals a bit, but Simian strikes me as slightly more devoted to the technological
    possibilities.</p><p>
    
    Which means audio surprises abound on <i>We Are Your Friends</i>, providing enough subtle tweaks on a familiar
    formula to hold attention.  Opening track ""La Breeze"" switches back and forth between Bollywood soundtrack
    and Britpop anthem like a radio crossing frequencies from New Delhi and London.  ""When I Go"" starts out as
    an embarrassing stab at country twang, but improves as it moves through lands of loop-assisted organ strut
    and dense blue-sky harmonies.  ""In Between"" and ""The Way That I Live"" are set to nervous beats and spooky
    synths worthy of The Neptunes... well, maybe worthy of The Streets... okay, not even that good, but pretty
    commendable for a rock band, anyway.</p><p>
    
    So with a group so obviously full of clever ideas, it's a little disappointing that their songwriting chops
    don't quite measure up to their bag of tricks.  Often I find myself more interested in the computerized
    embellishments than the songs themselves, and paying attention to the melodies of the schmaltzy ""End of the
    Day"" or butterknife-edged ""Big Black Gun"" is a far less rewarding endeavor.  Simian also tends to get a
    little too jokey in their delivery, a weakness that becomes gratingly annoying in the cartoonish vocals of
    the otherwise groovy ""Helpless"" or the awful horror-show lyrics of ""Skin"".</p><p>
    
    But stumbles and all, Simian deserves a cap-tip for evolving beyond the more standard psych-pop trappings
    of their last album into techno-curious territory.  They may not quite be able to shake sounding like a rock
    band dabbling in electronics, but all the same, they remain a good photo-negative counterpart to the
    lap-pop movement currently sweeping through IDM circles.  After all, there's still a lot of unexplored
    territory between traditional rock forms and computer creations, and <i>We Are Your Friends</i> represents
    a pleasant, if flawed, expedition into this wilderness.</p></div>"|7171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7171-we-are-your-friends/|7.1|Rob Mitchum

    inevitable problems of taking a (reportedly) good live garage band and trying to catch their energy in the
    studio.  Singer Chris Appelgren's balls-out whining stuck out above the textbook two-guitar garage rock,
    and as for the songs, they just weren't there.  This disc wasn't going to convince Americans to ditch The
    Hives and buy domestic.</p><p>
    
    But their first full-length, <i>Real Feelness</i>, is better in every way.  I'll skip the comments on how
    similar they sound to the other garage acts touring post-Ramones America right now: a good time is a good
    time.  The first track, ""Fragile Awareness"", comes raging like a schoolful of kids let out early for a bomb
    scare.  Appelgren's ""pitch? fuck the pitch"" vocal stylings soar and swoop around the band's clean, battering
    attack, which allows just a hint of sweat-- but they also let up for some trickier riffage: there's that
    great barbed hook on ""Selling Submarines"", and the perfect denim-jacket power harmonies on the ""The Best
    Called Rest"".</p><p>
    
    More interesting are the moments where Appelgren exposes more about his past-- and not just in a cock-rock
    way (though ""You or You"", about his indifference to which groupie he takes home, is snazzy).  ""Selling
    Submarines"" is about drug-dealing, and Appelgren has said that his mother was ""a very low-level cocaine
    dealer,"" a heavy inspiration for a briskly catchy pop-rock confection.  And then there's the risky closer,
    ""Rangefinder"", on which we discover that Appelgren is really, at heart, one sappy motherfucker:</p><p>
    
    It's an acoustic love song, absolutely unguarded.  The lyrics are unabashedly sentimental, and Appelgren's
    voice is bare and sneer-free.  ""When you develop your photographs/ And hang all your pictures to dry/ I will
    appear as a small red star/ Patiently watching the world passing by.""  Yeah, that's cheesy, alright--
    <i>so</i> cheesy it could only be on a record with the name <i>Real Feelness</i>.  Hell, I get embarrassed
    just listening to it.  But I won't heckle it for the simple reason that more risks ought to be taken in
    indie rock these days.  And while this track might be a step in the wrong direction, it is a step nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    As for the future of The Pattern?  I don't know where they plan to go after this.  This genre revival's
    passing us by faster than you can say ""<i>Swing Kids</i>"".  But there's always that remote possibility that
    they'll transcend their pigeonhole and come with something harder, or just better.  Garage rockers do the
    darndest things.</p></div>"|6191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6191-real-feelness/|6.7|Chris Dahlen

    bit, organize chaos, rinse and repeat over a twenty year cycle, come out alive.  If you're lucky, you might
    even notice the change within; the transformation from a violent, terminally bored slack-jaw into a wise old
    new age magician.  It happens to the best of them.  Why, it happened to (former?) Boredoms guitarist Seiichi
    Yamamoto, who hasn't been this tranquil on record since <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i>.  There and back again:
    a fuzzy groove tale.  Or, how I learned to stop worrying about my hardcore cred and bathe in the green and
    gold milk of Osaka.</p><p>
    
    Yamamoto appears on every Boredoms release except their 1986 debut seven-inch, but he will not appear on
    their next one.  Vooredoms (as Eye has christened their current formation) cut their ties to rock when their
    guitarist and bassist left, and I see this in two ways.  In one sense, it is a very interesting way of making
    the leap to a new plane, perhaps their Jupiter and Beyond.  On the other hand, as <i>Crown of Fuzzy Groove</i>
    makes clear, when Yamamoto left, he may have taken their heart with him.</p><p>
<i>Crown</i> is Yamamoto's first solo disc that isn't comprised of solo guitar improvisations, and it's
    dissimilar in almost every way not only to his previous outings, but also to his most famous non-Bore
    projects Rovo and Omoide Hatoba.  Where the latter band played skewed pop and punky psyche, and the former
    sprightly post-rock, this record is milky ambience to the core.  There are plenty of guitars to be found,
    but no riffs (substitute melodies-- who'd have thought?) or even distortion.  Distortion would disturb the
    carefully balanced ensemble on this album; no one voice is more dominant than another. Gently tapped
    hand-percussion and cymbal swells provide the spark for a series of mini-epics that vary from exotic
    future-lounge to all-out Calgon moments.  Airy synth patch upon airy synth patch fill all the blank
    space and then some, and there's just enough electro-blip to keep the sine wave 'n' sampler crowd happy.</p><p>
    
    ""Whity"" begins with a drawn-out introduction that sounds similar to some of Eye's airplane-in-space
    experiments on the last <i>Rebore</i> CD.  After takeoff, the now very familiar sound of jungle rhythms and
    electronic drone take up the slack.  It's familiar because that seems to have been the order of things for
    this camp over the last several years, but where Yamamoto's concept differs is in what's emphasized.  Chiefly,
    this isn't a percussive rave with ornamental sound effects; it's a remarkably rich tonal atmosphere with
    subtle rhythmic propulsion.  In short, it's the inverse of <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>.  Similarly,
    ""Mantral"" takes a melody that might've been a communal chant in another time and uses it as the glue that
    holds together a blissed-out trance.  Twelve minutes of aural Cool Whip, and at no point does the ""noise""
    ever seem noisy.</p><p>
    
    Folks expecting Boredoms II will probably be bummed by the general calm of this record, and that goes double
    for anyone expecting another Omoide Hatoba.  <i>Crown</i> is something you put on after getting high, to
    watch the ceiling spin to.  There's no danger of being hit with something unexpected halfway through a
    groove, and while that might be disheartening to long-time shock-city citizens, I take it as refined clarity
    from Yamamoto.</p></div>"|8894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8894-crown-of-fuzzy-groove/|8.1|Dominique Leone

Unlike
    other video stars, she has yet to attempt a beatless hip-hop album (I'm looking at you, Lauryn Hill), disrobe
    on TRL in a psychotic rage (Mariah Carey), or project herself as finger-licking jailbait for repressed
    pedophiles (take your pick).  With superproducer Timbaland lacing her tracks, Missy's been able to achieve
    the level of popularity usually reserved for people half her size, and her bizarre sci-fi costumes and
    off-the-wall attitude conjure a mainstream, female version of Kool Keith-- albeit one without the hip-hop
    pedigree, lyrical skills, or off-camera insanity.  And yet, despite her spunk and Timbaland's funk, hip-hop
    headz have a hard time accepting her as anything other than a (very) lovable MTV personality who makes great
    club-hop.</p><p>
    
    While it's doubtful that anything Missy ever does will touch <i>Critical Beatdown</i>, <i>Under Construction</i>
    shows that Missy's much more than the product of an extraterrestrial focus group, and that she deserves to
    be taken seriously among hip-hop aficionados.  'Course, it doesn't hurt her cred that the theme of <i>Under
    Construction</i> gives an <i>au courant</i> nod to classic hip-hop forms.  From the weak graffiti in the
    liner notes to the two-inch-thick gold chains, it's obvious she's mining the same nostalgia trip as countless
    underground acts-- only Missy doesn't have the burden of having to spend years laying broke in the gutter,
    studying the nuances of the culture.</p><p>
    
    Naturally, it's not Missy's fashion appropriations that make this record tight; it's Timbaland's musical
    palate, thick with old-school samples and breaks.  He even kicks off low-rider ""Funky Fresh Dressed"" with
    the same ""here's a little story that must be told"" sample that introduces DJ Premier's <i>Deep Concentration</i>.
    Tim lays down a classic break for the track's beat, with the hook cribbing the MC Lyte lyric, ""Funky fresh,
    dressed to impress, ready to party,"" which seems appropriate considering Missy's status in today's musical
    climate.  It gets better: as Ms Jade steps up to the mic for her cameo, Tim flips the track with the
    reverse-loop mindfuck of the Beasties' ""Paul Revere"".  It's true, of course, that all these elements are
    overused and obvious enough to make Jurassic 5 blush.  But they work because Timbaland <i>makes</i> them
    work, his frantic, chopped-up, bass-quake production recontextualizing them in a neo-futurist soundworld
    that, though using an eighth of the samples, hits with all the strength of a Bomb Squad fury.</p><p>
    
    Less auspicious is Missy's reworking of Method Man's '94 classic ""Bring the Pain"".  Unlike the Wu classic,
    there's nothing raw or vital about this baby.  The production is identical to the original but smoothed
    out on an R&amp;B; tip with pop feel appeal to it, and even Missy's slick croon seems diametrically opposed to
    the spirit of the original.  And Method Man took off time from endorsing Speed Stick to lay down a verse on
    this shit?  The man's career is already a corpse; validating a painful rehash of a track from his peak isn't
    gonna win him any friends.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Jay-Z's guest appearance on ""Back in the Day"" carries a little more weight.  Although the song
    reeks of both a Confucian historical reworking and old-skool hip-hop dilettantism, Jay delivers a smoothly
    masterful verse that name-checks personal heroes Showbiz and AG and calls out the narrow-minded moralizing
    of political pundits Bill O'Reilly and Chuck Phillips.  One of the year's funniest lines is Jay comparing
    himself and Missy to ""Rae and Ghostface"".  (So... is Missy supposed to be Ghost or Raekwon?)  Missy's delivery
    ain't bad, either.  I mean, it's not like she's composing anything traditionally deep or revelatory, but the
    ease with which she navigates the Timbaland's musical landmines is stunning-- these two were made for each
    other.  And I haven't even talked about ""Work It""... but do we really <i>need</i> to talk about ""Work It""?
    If you don't already know it's the greatest pop single/video of the year, I suggest that you emerge from
    your dusty record crates and turn on MTV.  Just for a second!!  I bet it's on right now.</p><p>
    
    Even with all its clever samples and sideways acknowledgments, of course, <i>Under Construction</i> is to
    true-skool hip-hop what <i>SI</i>'s <i>Swimsuit Issue</i> is to women's fashion-- but don't try and front
    like you don't salivate over that shit.  Once you push the politics of it aside, <i>Under Construction</i>'s
    a good record with some incredibly sick production work.  Anyone who'd dismiss it for the sake of maintaining
    some bullshit underground cred is only playin' himself.</p></div>"|2756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2756-under-construction/|7.2|Sam Chennault

    <i>Kind of Blue</i> of IDM. Mind you, I'm not comparing the quality of the
    music (hey, BoC are good, but they're not <i>that</i> good), but where the
    records sit in their respective canons. Like <i>Kind of Blue</i>, <i>Music
    Has the Right</i> is a record that appeals to people who aren't normally
    fans of the genre and rates exceptionally high for those who are. These
    albums of accessible excellence serve as the perfect introduction to a new
    field of music.</p><p>
    
    Which is probably why one of the FAQs by rock fans on the hunt for electronic
    music is, ""What can I get that sounds like Boards of Canada?""  For a while I
    had difficulty answering this question. Sure, the Boards borrowed heavily from
    Aphex Twin, and much of their sound can be traced to moments on <i>I Care
    Because You Do</i> and <i>The Richard D. James Album</i>. Yet both of those
    records are all over the map and ripe with abrasive moments (""Start as You
    Mean to Go On"", ""Corn Mouth"") that appeal more to those familiar with the
    beat-driven electronic scene.  <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i> was a
    tightly focused, unified listen with a distinctive sound that never strayed
    far from the timeworn principles of pop. All said, it's a unique formula.</p><p>
    
    I've previously answered the BoC query with a suggestion to look for artists
    on Germany's Morr Music label. The two-disc set <i>Putting the Morr Back in
    Morrissey</i> covers a decent amount of stylistic ground but never strays far
    from the ideal of dreamy, contemplative electronic pop. As an added bonus for
    rock fans, artists on Morr like Accelera Deck and Manufracture don't have
    guitarophobia.</p><p>
    
    I can, without reservation, add Manitoba to the list of artists I'd recommend
    to BoC fans. There are many stylistic and thematic parallels (warm analog
    tones, sharp focus on melody, song titles like ""Children Play Well Together""),
    but <i>Stop Breaking My Heart</i> never feels second-generation. The point-of-view
    here is unique, even if the sources are easy to trace. Where others in this
    vein opt for a hazy, nebulous cloud of half-remembered dreams, Manitoba's
    music is direct and unassuming while still remaining evocative.</p><p>
    
    Dan Snaith is the man behind Manitoba, and he opens <i>Start Breaking My
    Heart</i> with a reference to his motherland called ""Dundas, Ontario"".
    It sets the tone with a warbling synthesizer, some glitchy stuff happening
    in the distance, and crisp drum programming. ""People Eating Fruit"" is an
    early highlight, with the prettiest melody on the record and a perfectly
    executed air of nostalgia. The keyboards make me think of what I'd hoped Plone
    would sound like when I first read reviews of <i>For Beginner Piano</i>.
    Central to the track is a lovely vocal bit of children doing ""me re la so, do
    re mi"" like the von Trapp family on ecstacy.  Things take an emotionally deeper
    turn when the voices are pitch-shifted to sound like a chorus of chanting monks.</p><p>
    
    ""Mammals vs Reptiles"" follows and comes as a bit of a shock as Manitoba
    dabbles in jazzy electronic fusion. The cymbal-heavy drum line could be
    lifted from an Art Blakey stomper, and a section of blaring horns (also
    sampled, I imagine) reminds me a bit of Spiritualized. As the horns reach a
    crescendo, the record clicks abruptly into the midtempo ""Brandon"", which
    contains melodic elements from ""Dundas, Ontario"" (Brandon is also a Canadian
    town). The spacious track is the perfect tonic for its dense predecessor, and
    it neatly illustrates one of this album's primary strengths: smart sequencing.</p><p>
    
    A good sense of design is necessary to make tracks like the cinematic ""Children
    Play Well Together"" (one of the darker shadings on the album, it contains an
    uneasy piano refrain and nervous acoustic guitar arpeggios) work next to the
    busy, percussion-driven ""Lemon Yoghourt"". The jazz motif returns for the eclectic
    ""Paul's Birthday"", which combines busy cymbal work, a melodic fragment on
    flugelhorn, harp glissandi, and eventually, a tough beat.  <i>Start Breaking My
    Heart</i> may sound like a bit of a balancing act, but Manitoba holds it together
    and even makes it look easy.  The term ""accessible excellence"" fits like a glove.</p></div>"|5078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5078-start-breaking-my-heart/|8.0|Mark Richardson

It
    might take me a few seconds, but I can totally do it.  Hell, once in a while, the band even manages to
    stumble over something pretty great-- I was briefly enamored with ""I Love Only You"", and I'm only a little
    ashamed to admit it.  Still, if Darren Hayman started offering me musical advice, it might just give me pause.
    I'd sooner trust my musical career to the psychic crapshoot of Miss Cleo, given Hayman's recent decisions,
    but then again, I'm not the guitarist for Hefner, so what do I know, anyway?  Jack Hayter, on the other hand,
    <i>is</i> the guitarist, and when Hayman cajoled him into putting his meek acoustic balladry to tape, he
    heeded the call.  <i>Practical Wireless</i> is the result.  And how is it?  Let's say this: it's nothing
    Earth-shattering, but as sensitive solo artists go, the guy can hold his own.</p><p>
    
    Ever since the traumatic singer/songwriter drought of 1983, global stores have rebounded forcefully, and
    we've all been able to enjoy the mixed blessings of a surplus for the last few years.  That aggressive
    climate, however, means problems for Jack.  Most of us are already hip-deep in wool-cap wearing dudes armed
    with acoustics, and Hayter's more-of-same technique isn't likely to set him apart from the crowd anytime soon.
    Occasionally, he trades his acoustic guitar in for a steel pedal rig, and there's some accompaniment to speak
    of in the form of maracas, distant flutes, and the odd accordion, but in general, the album is almost
    uncomfortably sparse.  Most tracks leave little beyond Hayter's voice and his slight, often repetitive
    compositions to hold a listener's interest.  He breaks stride with standout tracks like the awkwardly,
    uncertainly charming ""Blind Man's Fog"" and ""Narrow Skies"", but even three minutes of most of these
    arrangements could bore the brass off a doorknob.</p><p>
    
    Really, though, it's Hayter's voice that gets top billing on <i>Practical Wireless</i>, and with good reason.
    Hayter has one of the weariest, most world-beaten voices around, his ace-in-the-hole.  His strains to hit
    the highs, and extended notes reek with character; if it were any more pained, it would sound forced, and
    if it were any less so, he couldn't even begin to sell these lyrics.  He falls into neither trap, though,
    and nails these songs with all the sincerity they deserve, giving the album a surprisingly personal texture.
    In fact, his vocal work even helps to salvage its musical accompaniment-- the acoustic plucking is so
    whisper-soft that even his exquisitely tired voice sounds somewhat strong in comparison.  It's this
    underlying implication of strength that really adds depth and humanity to his work, and it goes a long way
    to redeeming the overall blandness of the record.</p><p>
    
    Between that and a set of uniformly sweet, but slightly absurd lyrics, even the worst songs on this solo
    outing at least glimpse redemption.  All but one, in fact.  As soon as Peter Perret kicks off, he'll be
    spinning in his grave at Hayter's cover of his Only Ones classic ""Another Girl Another Planet"".  For his
    part, Hayter certainly ""makes it his own"", but this means reducing the gorgeous burn of the New York
    Dolls-inspired punk classic to a dull ember of a song.  He manages to bring out a lot of emotion that
    probably wasn't there in the first place, but also completely neuters the original's dramatic crash of
    breathless emotion.  In the end, it becomes sincere and sweet like all the other songs on the album; not
    terrible in its own right, but not great, either.  Still, if it comes down to a choice between this and

When we first caught a glimpse of the band on
    the cover of its first record, featuring a garish and kitschy photograph in which a vintage Moog is pulled
    from a human stomach <i>Alien</i>-style, it was easy to peg them as some kind of retro art project, making
    music from the cast-off instruments of records past. That album confounded expectations, offering varied
    and inspired knob-twiddling that often worked against type. And here on their fourth album, it's now clear
    that Add N to (X) are very difficult to define and don't fit very well into any particular scene.</p><p>
    
    Being on Mute and composing music primarily with keyboards, one wants to place Add N to (X) somewhere in the
    dance-pop continuum, but from the first track on <i>Loud Like Nature</i> this sort of classification is
    problematic. ""Total All Out Water"" is anthemic rock at the corner where Glam meets Classic, a corner Gary
    Glitter (his ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" drumbeat is stolen here) and David Bowie (circa ""Panic in Detroit"")
    have been known to frequent. The riff is undeniable and the bass throb is sleazy, but it would sound like
    hell worked into a DJ set. This is music for cruising the L.A. freeway system with the top down.</p><p>
    
    Add N to (X) have a fondness for natural drum sounds and generally eschew drum machines, which partly
    explains why the band often sounds so much more rock than one would expect. ""Sheez Mine"", on the other hand,
    fits quite well into what's happening now in electroclash, with an appropriately stiff drumbeat, chanted
    lyrics expressing disgust, and an uptempo propulsion. The following ""Invasion of the Polaroid People"" makes
    another sharp left turn, with spoken word sections and weird sound effects that combine to sound very
    mid-90s, like something off the album Steven Jesse Bernstein did with Steve Fisk for Sub Pop. The vocals
    on ""Party Bag"" remind me of Neil Haggerty's neo-soul falsetto, but the music is thick analog grunge, all
    oscillating bass tones and messy noise settings. Despite the presence of a Theremin solo, it still sounds
    difficult to place in terms of era.</p><p>
    
    All this variety is to be commended, but a lot of the tracks here sound like unfinished sketches. You find
    yourself waiting for the hook or chorus to kick in, and too often, it never does. For every ""Take Me to Your
    Leader"", another catchy electro track with a great chorus riff, there's a ""P.P. Machine"" or ""Up the Punks,""
    marginal between-song interludes that go on for four minutes, filled with enough interesting noises but
    fewer interesting ideas.  Still, these moments of tedium, while too frequent, don't overwhelm the album,
    keeping <i>Loud Like Nature</i> on par with the bulk of Add N to (X)'s output. They may be hard to pigeonhole,
    but they're easy enough to like.</p></div>"|50.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/50-loud-like-nature/|6.8|Mark Richardson

    how often it seems like it's going somewhere, it never quite leaves the station.  Time and again, it shows
    tremendous promise, shooting for dreamy, slow-building psych with the occasional look at upbeat pop
    songwriting... but this story ends badly; the White Star Line derails among countless stylistic flirtations,
    and in the end, nothing gets out without being at least somewhat half-assed.  The tragedy of it all is that
    White Star Line often sound like they might be on to something with one genre or another, but by never fully
    committing, it all just ends up sounding displaced.</p><p>
    
    White Star Line's arrival is so overcooked that it's easy to be fooled-- ""BBQ"" begins with a lulling acoustic
    stroll that blossoms into wide-open spaces, and even the fairly gratuitous horn section works briefly.  A
    flawless segue into ""And Fine Wine"" follows, and the expansive sweep of ""BBQ"" explodes into a towering, yet
    tranquil, blast.  The impact of reigning slowcore titans Low is evident in the gentle bombast of these opening
    tracks, but as quickly as it arrived, it's discarded.  Cracker's brooding, western shadow looms over the
    exceptional ""Sniffer's Row"", the crown jewel of the Line.  Bass notes crest and break in waves between the
    rise and fall of bittersweet choruses, paving the way for a crash of piano and guitar.  The doe-eyed,
    plaintive refrains allow Luca Maoloni to display an astoundingly expressive vocal ability that's
    conspicuously absent elsewhere.  The shift in tone and style between the first two and this one is abrupt,
    but ""Sniffer's Row"" is singularly gripping; it renders the growing identity crisis of the album temporarily
    forgivable.</p><p>
    
    From here on out, the album steadily loses footing, becoming more and more impenetrable as the band begins
    to search increasingly frantically for something to which they can anchor their drifting sound.  The two-minute
    instrumental of almost unobstructed near-silence that follows sounds more the like the band huddling up and
    deciding what to do next than a track meant to contain any worth or meaning.  ""'A' Is for 'Arousal'"" is what
    turns up, and this six-minute epic can't even completely hold <i>itself</i> together-- the song morphs
    constantly, though not entirely inexplicably.  It's not even really worth mentioning that the song's first
    half is a direct take on the Silver Jews; by the time the second half opens with the incredibly strained
    call of, ""White Star Line's for dreeeamers,"" the song has completely broken down.  This is the sound of a
    talented band with a good ear for melody who has no idea what they actually sound like.</p><p>
    
    If the band could have hit a few more showstoppers like ""Sniffer's Row"", this wouldn't even be a concern.
    Sadly, nothing else approaches it, and the fact that none of these songs can really unify into a whole
    leaves all of them out there to fend for themselves, which they're ill-equipped to do.  ""Bowels of a Bummer""
    is the single most disappointing reminder of their inability to nail anything down-- even though it's
    probably the second-best song on the record, it punctuates the album like a massive, festering question
    mark asking ""Why?"".  Maybe White Star's next trip around the block will provide a response.</p></div>"|8649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8649-white-star-line/|5.8|Eric Carr

If only it were that simple.  Famed Beatles
    producer George Martin signed this British mod outfit to his AIR Productions in the mid-60s and helped them
    produce a few psych-pop singles (including 1967's ""Shadows and Reflections"", featured on the <i>Nuggets II</i>
    box) to no popular avail.  Their sound was more refined than The Small Faces, punchier than The Zombies, yet
    they were hardly would-be contenders.  The Action's failure to chart a single during their brief existence
    is one of the mystifying anti-climaxes in rock history, as most of their songs have aged remarkably well.</p><p>
    
    The band formed in the early 60s as The Boys, and cut one single for Pye before changing their name to The
    Action.  The principal players were vocalist Reg King (possessing a powerful, debonair croon), guitarists
    Alan King and Pete Watson (later replaced by Martin Stone), bassist Mike Evans, and drummer Roger Powell (a
    tighter, funkier Ringo-esque stylist).  Their early singles on Parlophone (courtesy of Martin) were comprised
    of highly respectable R&amp;B; covers (""Land of 1000 Dances"") and freakbeat.  By 1967, their sound had developed
    similarly to many of their peers into an eclectic mix of folk-rock (probably Byrds-influenced) and even
    psychedelia.  Eventually, this group would disband, later forming an even better pure psych group called
    Mighty Baby, but <i>Rolled Gold</i> captures their final demo recordings in 1967-68.</p><p>
    
    The music on this collection offers evidence that The Action were a truly wronged band.  The hooks are bright,
    the playing rough but assured, and the songwriting on par with anything The Who or Zombies were producing.
    However, the sub-par demo-quality of the recordings (this material was laid down hastily in hopes of landing
    a new record deal) robs more than a little power from the music-- for that reason, you'll need some imagination
    to draw parallels between this record and <i>Odessey and Oracle</i>.  Nevertheless, there are moments of
    brilliance any lover of late-60s British rock will want to hear.</p><p>
    
    The opener ""Come Around"" was planned to open a pending (but never recorded) proper LP, and it's a lively
    slice of proto-power-pop, with that dash of quaint melodicism only the English bands could pull off
    convincingly.  The descending bassline and Reg King's stately boom practically define the Mod sound in
    1967, as does the flowery white soul of ""Something to Say"".  Even better is the show-stopping, <i>Austin
    Powers</i>-destroying frill of ""In My Dream"".  The chorus is the ultimate crossbreeding of mod-cool, Bond
    sheen and garage splinter, and I can only imagine the splash they'd have made had this ever been given the
    professional veneer it deserved (though George Martin's minimal touches are ace).</p><p>
    
    The highlight of the compilation-- one that transforms <i>Rolled Gold</i> from an interesting curio into a
    near must-have-- is the transcendent, rock-splendor of ""Brain"".  Reg King shouts, barely able to contain
    himself, ""Take your brain/ It's time to go/ You don't have long to go!"" over a wah-wah fueled pound that
    would make Thunderclap Newman proud.  Brent Rademaker of Beachwood Sparks contributes some liner notes to
    this collection, and gives his awed respects to this song-- rightly so, as ""Brain"" alone dwarfs most
    neo-psych bands entire catalogs.  Classic.</p><p>
    
    Of course, not every song is a winner, and the lack of production keeps me from determining just how this
    stuff would have worked as a coherent experience (singles are a blast, but surely The Action deserved an
    entry in the concept LP sweepstakes of their day).  A collection of their released material titled <i>Action
    Packed</i> is also available, and any serious evaluation of their sound begins there.  However, there's
    something magical about this stuff, too, and I'd guess anyone sufficiently into the scene might eventually
    work their way through to it.</p></div>"|31.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/31-rolled-gold/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    ""I've got a very goth towel/ A terrycloth cowl/ And when I wear it/ I'm a hairy moth owl.""</p><p>
    
    ""I'm iller than the Iliad/ And show more than Shoah/ While you're so corny you've got a SOH-CAH-TOA/ PEMDAS EFX the number one skirmisher.""</p><p>
    
    ""I'm advancing the art form/ De-pantsing a fart storm/ Some people don't like thinking/ I guess it's too hard for 'em.""</p><p>
    
    ""I bungee jump/ Into my grungy dump/ And come up with a trust fund-y dust bunny spongy clump.""</p><p>
    
    A few more pieces of information to give you a pretty clear picture of what <i>Paullelujah!</i> is trying
    to say:</p><p>
    
    1) All of the above quotations are taken from the same song, ""Excuse You"".</p><p>
    
    2) The ""very goth towel"" line actually appears in two songs: the aforementioned ""Excuse You"" and ""Vulture
    Shark Sculpture Park"".</p><p>
    
    3) The line, ""My dandy voice makes the most anti-choice granny's panties moist,"" from Paul's <i>It's Very
    Stimulating</i> EP, is repeated on <i>Paullelujah!</i> in the chorus of the song ""Cock Mobster"".</p><p>
    
    Nonsensical, awkward alliterative rhymes!  Lame-ass mnemonic devices from high school math class!  Gratuitous
    references to Greek epic poetry!  Wow, Paul Barman sure is one clever, well-educated guy.  He can rhyme words
    with other words!  He's an iconoclast!  In a thigh-high condom cast!  Building upon the past like Monet painting
    a pond and grass!</p><p>
    
    So what exactly is Paul trying to say with <i>Paullelujah</i>?  Well, let's see... Paul's rhymes consist
    mainly of vaguely clever attacks on trendy ultra-liberal types, totally out-of-place references to art and
    academia, third grade poop humor that would probably lead most third graders to kick the shit out of him,
    and aimless, self-indulgent wordplay.  What can we learn from all this?  Obviously, that Paul is a smart
    fellow!  He knows lots of stuff about everything!  Hey, he rhymes about John Cage!  And rapping about John
    Cage is like crapping on a fond sage!  Or an actor napping when he's supposed to be on stage!  Hey, that's
    more confusing than reading a Jacques Lacan page!</p><p>
    
    Yes, that's right, it's fun to see how many consecutive rhymes you can construct for a given phrase,
    regardless of logic and meaning!  It's not even that difficult!  And when you're done, you're left with
    that wonderful sense of smug self-satisfaction that you can only get from doing something completely
    fucking useless.</p><p>
    
    On Barman's <i>It's Very Stimulating</i> EP, the relatively consistent theme of sex at least gave Barman
    some kind of focus, resulting in some genuinely funny rhymes.  Here, he's all over the place, the only at
    all constant theme in Barman's raps being... well, Barman himself.  It was kind of funny the first time
    around, when Paul opened his EP with the line, ""My brain makes the earth dark/ But I'm hung like a birthmark,""
    but on the unrelentingly self-glorifying <i>Paullelujah!</i>, Barman tries to play both sides, dropping
    endless, useless bits of trivial knowledge as well as endless, useless references to his endless, useless
    store of trivial knowledge, while glibly playing up his own weaknesses as an MC.</p><p>
    
    And indeed, Barman's flow is even worse on <i>Paullelujah!</i> than it was on <i>It's Very Stimulating</i>.
    He trips up on his own words so much that it's often hard figure out what he's saying.  Thankfully, it
    doesn't really matter what he's saying-- twenty seconds into the record, you'll probably have already
    stopped giving a shit.</p><p>
    
    And it's kind of a shame, too, because Barman got some pretty talented producers to help him out on this
    record.  Old standby Prince Paul, modern-day innovator MF Doom, and probable furry Phofo, all lend their
    production skills to the record.  Some of the beats-- most notably MF Doom's contribution to ""The Anarchist
    Bookstore""-- are pretty tight, but any rhythmic complexities present in the beats are immediately bulldozed
    by Barman's lame and awkward rhyming.  It's always been clear that Paul likes to be the center of attention--
    and though some of the beats on <i>Paullelujah!</i> are pretty creative, they're always kept repetitive
    enough that you'll eventually have no choice but to pay attention to Paul's lame-ass rhymes.</p><p>
    
    I could spend another ten pages going into the specifics of why this album is disastrous, but I don't think
    that's necessary.  Instead, I'll briefly summarize what you can learn from listening to <i>Paullelujah!</i>,
    leaving absolutely no reason for you to bother with it.</p><p>
    
    1) Paul Barman is a smart, educated, politically informed guy.  He knows stuff about art and math and stuff.
    And he can rhyme, like, anything.  He's probably way smarter than you.  Seriously.</p><p>
    
    2) But he's not like those other smart, educated, politically informed guys.  Because he makes fun of them.
    So he's smarter than them, too.  Seriously.</p><p>
    
    3) But, seriously, don't take him that seriously.  Because he thinks poop is really funny, and there are
    goofy skits and stuff on the record.  Hey, remember De La Soul?  Didn't they do goofy skits?  Didn't Prince
    Paul produce them, too?  Didn't it actually seem relevant back then?</p><p>
    
    So, in conclusion, Paul Barman has recorded the perfect album for his target audience-- assuming, of course,
    that his target audience is Paul Barman.  I can only hope he enjoys it as much as I do.</p></div>"|565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/565-paullelujah/|2.0|Matt LeMay

In its     evocation of forgotten jazz, blues, film music, and hip-hop, Portishead's <em>Dummy</em> was the quintessence     of ""even better than the real thing"", yet when the magic ceased on the band's eponymous sophomore album, it     was ultimately due to their desire to <em>be</em> the real thing.  On <em>Portishead</em>, the trio retained     their hip-hop elements only in principle-- they played every sound themselves, pressed the results to     dubplates, and then cut and looped them into backing tracks.  In practice, Portishead had abandoned the     sampler's art-- the recontextualization of sound and the creation of history from history-- and so, the     thrill had gone.  It's no coincidence that the best post-<em>Dummy</em> release from the Portishead camp     remains DJ Andy Smith's eclectic mash-up, <em>The Document</em></p><p>.</p><p>Beth Gibbons, one assumes, was never much into hip-hop.  Hers, after all, was the bleeding heart at the     center of it all, and her remarkable, tortured voice (equal parts Billie Holiday and Sandy Denny), remains     capable of gravitas for any occasion. ""Mysteries"" opens <em>Out of Season</em> brilliantly, folk arpeggios     plucking their way around Beth's gasps while a cadre of gospel singers in the background oooooh the record     into being.  ""Tom the Model"" takes that cue and runs with it, answering delicate folk verses with a nicely     retro big-band soul chorus. Beth attacks the song with verve, and even the hint of self-pity in the lyric     is kicked into touch by her defiance.</p>
<p>If only the rest of <em>Out of Season</em> displayed that energy.  Instead, we're quickly plunged into moodiness     for the sake of moodiness, overwhelmed by Gibbons' frankly unpitiable obsession with her own misfortune. At     their best, Portishead turned this kind of smoky cabaret blues into an invigorating showpiece. But replace     crackling vinyl and subwoofer bass with somber piano and mournful cello, and all you're left with is... well,     a pretty goddamn miserable woman who happens to have a great voice. That's ""Show"" for you, and for all its     miserable pleading, it's as forgettable a song as Gibbons has ever crooned.</p>
<p>""Romance"" tries some moaning french horns on for size, and frankly looks ridiculous in them. Chrissakes, who     suggested a 90-second french horn solo was a good idea?  And again, if Gibbons' Billie Holiday routine was     engaging in Portishead's hip-hop context-- reconstituted blues that fit their mix perfectly-- here it     threatens to go a little pantomime.</p>
<p>And now to the issue of Rustin Man: What is the deal with calling yourself Rustin Man? Are we supposed     to let that slide?  Turns out it's an alias for ex-Talk Talk bassist Paul Webb.  Now, Talk Talk did some     wonderful things-- <em>Spirit of Eden</em> and <em>Laughing Stock</em> both proved what can be achieved with     emphasis on mood and atmosphere.  Here, however, Webb allows Gibbons to dictate both, and it just doesn't     work. Striking as her voice can be, she does little to prove that it has the emotive range to match its     power.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, ""Resolve"" is a pretty but inconsequential folk tune, and ""Drake"" and ""Funny Time of Year"" waltz     their way in and out of the frame without forcing you to take much notice.  Which leaves ""Rustin Man"" the     song, a frustrating hint of what might have been. Its pure ambience (think Dot Allison's recent album, if     produced by Tim Friese-Greene) sounds remarkably modern next to the trad fare that precedes it, and the     warbling and sizzling of the synths forces Beth to be a little more active with her vocal-- she slips in     and out of the mix, allowing atmosphere to build rather than overwhelming it with her moods. Sonically,     of course, it's no less bleak than the rest of this album, and though it does bring in some much-needed     excitement at the end, it's just not powerful enough to save the whole from its vanilla dejection.</p>

But in the real world, there are no
    Radioheads without Coldplays, no Sunny Day Real Estates without Get Up Kids, no Strokes without Vines. Trends
    spawn idolaters, which in turn spawn shit.  This, of course, is not limited to bands who break the mainstream;
    it happens with every genre, no matter how popular or underground.  In recent years, post-rock has seen the
    worst of it.  You had your pioneers (Slint, Tortoise, Mogwai, etc) and you had your everything else.  And
    while most of the greats are still together, the ""everything else"" has left us tired-- no, <i>sick</i> and
    tired-- of the whole business.</p><p>
    The post-rock subgenre most clearly running on fumes these days is the jazz-centered variation, influenced by
    Thrill Jockey powerhouses as Tortoise and Isotope 217.  Rumah Sakit fits somewhere between that and a brand of
    math-rock championed by Don Caballero. Something, however, saves Rumah Sakit from the clichéd boredom commonly
    propagated by jazzy and mathy post-rockers. Never steeped too far in theory and proggy details, Rumah Sakit
    keeps a keen eye out for two things: emotional intensity and an awareness of unity and consonance.</p><p>
    Both jazz-based post-rock and math-rock pride themselves on musical expression through complicated theory.
    As has been well-documented, though, it often comes at the expense of accessibility, reducing the music to
    an intellectual exercise. Rumah Sakit takes cues from bands at the opposite end of the spectrum-- the
    delightfully simplistic and overtly emotional Explosions in the Sky, for example (albeit less funerary)--
    to avoid such pitfalls. ""Go Horsey Go (Live)"" typifies the approach, killing 2\xBD minutes of complex, winding,
    metallic rock into silence, then gradually resurrecting its more primal essence with a simple, climactic
    denouement, driven by non-sequitur guitar patterns and feedback, and a steadily mounting drumbeat.</p><p>
    So now let's talk about ""New Underwear Dance"", which not only deserves a Grammy for year's best song title
    but is also further indicative of this band's balance of theory and passion. A bright, bucolic guitar passage
    draws strength from the gradual addition of drums, overdrive, modulation and counterpoint, finding a vibrant
    and complex, yet evocative, intensity. The band retreats from this opening section to a simpler groove, but
    again rises to maximum power-- this time uncomplicated, just balls-out volume.</p><p>
    Rumah Sakit also understand a need for unity and consonance, foundations of rock music. ""No One Likes a Grumpy
    Cripple"" bluffs an unsettling modal jazz number, with something like a 7/8 time signature, but instead of
    leaving the tension unresolved, the band blows the song up with a chorus of attacking guitars. ""Sausage Full
    of Secrets (Live)"" also gets to the point, this time a bit more quickly, transitioning from a brief, sparse,
    Slint-like opener to ascend to atmospheric heights (and a 4/4 time signature welcome to the ears).</p><p>
    Low points are predictable, coming when Rumah Sakit falls prey to the usual cerebral, antiseptic post-rock
    temptations. For example, the title track's obscured by excessive meandering, never giving any indication of
    the song's center, or the composition's significance. It winds down with a languid, free-form spaz-out,
    clocking in at a needless 10\xBD minutes (five of which are discombobulated spaz-time). Other pretentious
    interludes are less egregious, but their presence definitely hurts the album's overall appeal.  Rumah Sakit
    largely manages to avoid stereotypes and clichés to carve a unique nook within the saturated panoply of
    post-rock. They may not have created a timeless legacy for themselves, but that doesn't mean this album

Spinning
    the everyday into gold and crap like that?  Well, if that's the road they
    drive, Richard Buckner may have finally run into his titular impasse.  After
    documenting the achiness and breakiness of his heart over the course of a
    number of fine records in the mid-to-late 90s, the San Francisco native
    switched gears to take on the project of adapting the histories of others
    (namely, the backwater protagonists of poet Edgar Lee Masters' <i>Spoon River
    Anthology</i>).  The result, 2000's <i>The Hill</i>, was a glorious, barely
    cohesive run-on sentence of a record, crammed almost to bursting with narrative
    detail.  Still, even though Buckner did an admirable job of getting into his
    characters' heads, he was obviously telling other peoples' stories, begging the
    question: had he run out of his own?</p><p>
<i>Impasse</i> marks Buckner's return to the first person, as well as a reversion
    to the blunter rock persona he picked up on 1998's <i>Since</i> and then quickly
    abandoned in favor of <i>The Hill</i>'s sparser acoustics.  This shouldn't be
    (and, for the most part, isn't) a bad thing; as the pop-rockers that kick off
    the album (""Born Into Giving It Up"" and ""Hoping Wishers Never Lose"") suggest,
    he's pretty good at it.  Still, even between these two songs, the similarities
    nag-- the same low, metallic guitars clang in the introductions, and the same
    humming synths wash over the choruses.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't hurt that a number of pleasant numbers in the same mold (Buckner's wife
    Penny Jo's drums being the main distinguishing features) show themselves throughout
    the rest of the album; problem is, these are the best the record has to offer.
    Buckner's lyrical mode has gone from despairingly particular to optimistically
    impressionist, which is fine for the more upbeat songs.  Without that extra weight,
    however, the more folky tunes don't hold up so well-- where we once were given a
    story, start to finish, Buckner now pours out a succession of vague images and
    emotions, and whenever he decides to cut off his stream of consciousness, it
    sounds like it's a little too soon.  Only the sort of epic, sweeping guitar
    gestures Buckner applies to ""Dusty from the Talk"" make it sound complete; the
    others end up fragmented and premature.  And when he tries to do dire, as on
    ""Were You Tried &amp; Not as Tough"", it ends up sounding forced, which is awfully
    disconcerting on a record as unforcedly simple as this one often is.</p><p>
    
    While Buckner's uniqueness still stems from his gorgeous and clear but deep-as-dirt
    baritone, his voice also seems complicit in homogenizing these songs.  The same
    twang-tricks seem to pop up over and over again, and, unsupported by sonic variety
    in the songs themselves, this makes melodies all run together.  I mean, they're all
    nice on their own and everything, but over the course of an album, the effect is of
    a guy at a party that won't stop telling the same story.  With the details excised,
    the story <i>Impasse</i> tells isn't even that personal anymore.  Like a ride through
    the prairie on a summer day, it's pretty, but about as flat as it gets.</p></div>"|998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/998-impasse/|6.6|Brendan Reid

Some bands don't even have liner notes at all,
    usually due to laziness or extreme pretentiousness, and most offer only a few bare details.  But these
    three guys (one can assume by their name that they must be adults today) took some time to put a little
    humor and personality into their liners, offering insight into each of the songs with disarming little
    anecdotes.  This can, of course, be taken to negative extremes, but in this case, it's a nice introduction
    to the band you're about to listen to, and serves to highlight some of the things you might otherwise miss.</p><p>
    
    In truth, I still can't really find some of the things they talk about putting into these songs (I swear to
    god there's only one tiny instance of cowbell on this record, though they credit it on a full third of the
    tracks), but the snapshot of the band's personality is welcome all the same.  And while they exhibit a lot
    of healthy ambition, Yesterday's Kids are fundamentally a pop/punk trio, for better or worse.  I think about
    it as the kind of record I'd like to listen to on the way home from work, but not the kind of record I'd
    want to listen to at home-- it's diversionary and fun, sometimes even great, but not very deep.</p><p>
    
    The Kids open with ""(Ode to) Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet"", a tribute to the Ontario surf-punks
    responsible for the ""Kids in the Hall"" theme song.  It's an apt enough opener, as it lays out their blueprint--
    ringing, lightly distorted guitars, lockstep drums, two-part harmonies, and melodies designed to sit in your
    ear.  By and large, this is what they stick with, and it works most of the time-- ""I Wanna Be Alone (With You)"",
    ""Keep It Down"" and ""Eighteen"" are three sparkling tracks in a row, a veritable sugar rush of punchy pop.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, things run together a bit, and songs like the swaggering ""The Shithead"" flounder on their length
    or lack of sonic variety.  A generic song or two is a hard thing for a band like this to avoid, and Yesterday's
    Kids don't escape that pitfall.  However, they compensate with a little imagination, like the slip into a
    waltz that ends ""I Don't Care"", or the strings that pop up here and there.  In fact, it's violinist Sara
    Farenholz's contribution to ""Trouble on the Way"" that provides the album's most epiphanous moment.  The
    band adds a harmonica to their usual mix in the verses, enlivening the song's chugging riffs, but it's during
    the bridge-- where the music suddenly becomes clear and Farenholz's violin bubbles up like lava for a brief,
    fleeting moment-- that you get the best idea of what this band is capable of.</p><p>
    
    With a few more moments like that on their next record, Yesterday's Kids could graduate completely from any
    pop/punk label a critic like me could throw at them.  And of course, they could always use more cowbell.  At
    the very least, they've proven themselves an able, ambitious band on their second album, and their continued
    maturation promises good things in the future.</p></div>"|8883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8883-cant-hear-nothin/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    on Monday.  I've seen the list, and I can promise that you hipsters won't be disappointed... unless you dig
    Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam, Hall &amp; Oates and Shalamar. Rejected by the purveyors of taste and abandoned by the Top
    40 radio that fostered them, these brave artists made the kind of bubblegum R&amp;B; and pop that was, after its
    brief moment in the sun, destined for landfills.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately (I guess), Beat Junkie and turntablist extraordinaire Rhettmatic have been digging through our
    collective trash to collect a mixtape that fuses turntablism gymnastics with the dopest beats from the worst
    songs ever.  Yet, while there are no doubt countless mix tapes surfacing of 80s songs mined for their camp
    appeal, Rhettmatic takes a different route; for <i>The Wedding Mixer</i>, he actually puts these songs in a
    context that brings out their accidental genius.</p><p>
    
    Klymaxx's ""Meeting in the Ladies Room"" may be the hottest song ever about getting laid in the bathroom. And
    KC &amp; The Sunshine Band's ""I Get Lifted"" may be the best song ever, period.  I wanted to kiss Rhettmatic for
    mixing Hall &amp; Oates' ""I Can't Go for That"" into Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"", a song that has faired far
    better than its creator.  Rhettmatic even drops some great old-skool hip-hop classics like Rodney and Joe
    Cooley's ""Supercuts"" and ""Looking for the Perfect Beat"" by Afrika Bambaataa &amp; The Soulsonic Force.  In fact,
    my only complaint with the disc's selection is with what may be its best song: James Brown's ""Get on the
    Good Foot"". While there's no denying its status as a classic and massively influential track, it feels out
    of place here not only because it isn't from the 1980s, but because it <i>is</i> a recognized classic.  Why
    not throw in some New Edition or Giorgio Moroder?</p><p>
    
    Of course, Rhettmatic slices and dices his material so that the breaks are accentuated, and his work on Evelyn
    ""Champagne"" King's ""Love Comes Down"" is particularly hot.  And although nothing mind-blowing, Rhettmatic's
    scratches on this disc are very nice and add a certain hip-hop flavor to the proceedings, even when laid
    over Yaz's ""Situation"", perhaps the whitest song ever made.  Despite the skills on display, though, the
    purpose of this album is to reclaim the music that we felt embarrassed to have ever listened to.  Sure,
    this album may be a novelty, but if nothing else, it's at least a really good one.</p></div>"|6776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6776-the-wedding-mixer/|7.8|Sam Chennault

This is how Outrageous Cherry frontman
    Matthew Smith once explained how this album was supposed to sound, back before it was released.  Matthew
    Smith is a damn, dirty liar.  First of all, this is hardly a space opera.  When I hear the phrase ""space
    opera"", I think Buck Rogers belting out Kiri Te Kanawa arias in a corset.  You get none of that.</p><p>
    
    Secondly, this is hardly ""very different from anything [Outrageous Cherry] have done before.""  Not that
    that's a bad thing-- I dig Outrageous Cherry, and I've always found their swirling update on psychedelia
    enjoyable, regardless of how little the sound has changed over the years.  So, under the assumption that
    he's a nice guy, I'm willing to forgive Smith's under-interview transgressions and just take his album for
    what it is: a pretty neat modern psych album.</p><p>
    
    Experienced fans of the Detroit quartet named for a shade of hair dye will be familiar with the elements
    here: piles and piles of reverb, Deb Agolli's Moe Tucker-inspired drumming, Smith's pleasing tenor, and a
    healthy layer of guitar fuzz.  To Smith's credit, the format is a bit different from the Cherry's last
    outing, 1999's excellent <i>Out There in the Dark</i>, relying more on mood and noise than that album ever
    did-- a move that actually makes it more akin to the band's earlier records.  <i>Out There in the Dark</i>
    was outstanding, boasting a clutch of songs that were instantly memorable, and a staggering consistency of
    craft.</p><p>
<i>The Books of Spectral Projections</i>, recently released in the UK on ex-Creation labelhead Alan McGee's
    new Poptones imprint, can't quite make that claim, but it does have a wealth of moments (plus, it continue
    the tradition of horrible cover art that <i>Out There</i> kept up).  The disc's primary failing is its
    breadth-- 20 songs in 80 minutes is just too long for an album like this; if only the best moments were
    kept, you'd have one rock-solid 45-minute pop pleaser.</p><p>
    
    Now, I admit it may be easy for the uninitiated to be skeptical of this band's knack for a pop hook,
    especially in light of song titles like ""Electric Child of Witchcraft Rising"", and ""It's Only Sorcery"", but
    Smith has this way of taking these incredibly absurd subjects like, say, time-traveling witches, and
    situating them in well-written, plaintively delivered songs that tend to make you forget the lyrics, or
    at least look the other way.  And the music is so tightly executed, you may have a hard time convincing
    friends it's not period stuff: ""It's So Nice to be Here"" is worthy of a Barrett-led Pink Floyd, while ""Here
    Where the Stars Are Cracking Up"" feels like a late addition to the <i>Nuggets</i> box set.</p><p>
    
    Not everything meets the quality standards set by those two songs, though, and after ten years and five
    albums, the band's best work seems behind them.  Still, there's amazingly nothing truly awful lurking on
    this album, and that the band are capable of creating psychedelic rock that doesn't feel forced or ironic
    speaks volumes of their talent.  If you don't mind a little bit of sorcery creeping its way into your acid
    trip, <i>The Book of Spectral Projections</i> is pretty nice.</p></div>"|6062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6062-the-book-of-spectral-projections/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    It's been weird the last couple of months, driving around the plywood-lined canyons of Hollywood-- the endless
    construction zone, the castles of scaffolding and the drywall façades that mark the parking garages, the
    Scientology test centers, the mini-malls of tomorrow. Between rows of handbills for <i>8 Mile</i> and
    Christina Aguilera's <i>Stripped</i> there are stark grids of them, white on black, with a single word:
    NIRVANA. And for a moment, it's as if nothing has changed in the ten years I've lived in Los Angeles. The
    payphones are still plastered with flyers beckoning models and movie extras, and you can still get a pretty
    decent slice of pie for six bucks.  I'm still secretly infatuated with the oversized billboards that hawk
    made-for-cable movies down on the Sunset Strip, and I still think In 'n' Out Burgers are overrated. But
    somehow it's comforting to see the handbills-- ghostly, surreal tombstones, reverent in their simplicity.</p><p>
    Had Kurt Cobain not shot himself in the face in April 1994, it's hard to say how different the world might
    be. The commercial explosion of alternative rock began with the four-chord blitzkrieg of ""Smells Like Teen
    Spirit"", decimating the glass ceiling that had taunted major-label hopefuls like R.E.M., The Flaming Lips,
    and The Pixies in the 80s. The majors responded by hiring battalions of silver-tongued A&amp;R; reps to find a
    successor for the band, bloating their rosters with gimmicky wannabes and booking Butch Vig, Jack Endino,
    Steve Albini, Scott Litt and Brad Wood solid through 1998.  While the feeding frenzy brought deserved
    attention to idiosyncratic bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam, it ended with the
    ""alternative"" tag being co-opted by any and every new band, and soon the uniformly aggressive sounds of
    Bush, Live, and Silverchair ruled the airwaves. Kurt Cobain did not live to see this.</p><p>
    Nor did Cobain live to see the music-biz megamergers of the late 90s, which found a liquor empire acquiring
    venerable Hollywood labels like A&amp;M;, Geffen, and DGC (Nirvana's label) and booting literally hundreds of
    bands-- including Cobain's beloved Raincoats and Meat Puppets-- from the majors. Surely Cobain would have
    reacted with abject disgust to the brazen payola which successfully poised Limp Bizkit as the new alt-rock
    prototype, or with disappointment as the old-school punk stylings of Green Day and The Offspring gave birth
    to the eerily homogenous, overcompressed frat-rock that currently dominates your friendly neighborhood Clear
    Channel or Infinity affiliate.</p><p>
    Likewise, Pitchfork was not around in 1991 to guardedly praise the slick, but undeniably classic <i>Nevermind</i>,
    to shake our heads in bafflement at the curiosity shop of <i>Incesticide</i>, or to hold lighters aloft at
    the majestic bombast of <i>In Utero</i>. Had Kurt Cobain lived to mark the ten-year anniversary of his biggest
    success in September 2001, he would have gotten his Leonard Cohen afterworld, and if it wasn't his weekend
    to keep Frances Bean he probably would have written a song about it. Perhaps he'd have recognized the budding
    songwriting chops of bandmate Dave Grohl and begun a songwriting collaboration/competition worthy of Lennon
    and McCartney, or taken a couple of years off before emerging with a brilliant, basement-recorded solo album
    (and a beard).</p><p>
    Instead, I find myself in the curious position of eulogizing Nirvana based on this fourteen-track best-of
    collection whose very existence is the result of a legal settlement. Exciting, huh? I think we can all agree
    that <i>Sid &amp; Nancy</i> would've been a much more compelling story if, rather than Nancy Spungen dying in a
    Chelsea Hotel bathroom, she had survived Sid Vicious, kicked her habit, taken acting lessons, hired a phalanx
    of attorneys to force evil journalists and record companies to cease and desist their dastardly anti-Nancy
    conspiracies, and published Sid's private diaries for a $2 million payday. Long story short, Grohl and Krist
    Novoselic spent a year compiling an exhaustive box set with heaps of previously unreleased material, demo
    and rehearsal recordings, live gems, and the like; Courtney Love insisted on releasing this more conventional
    best-of first.</p><p>
    On the one hand, this radio-friendly unit shifter is indeed an artful selection of the band's most seminal
    material-- four cuts each from <i>Nevermind</i> and <i>In Utero</i>, two from <i>Incesticide</i> and
    <i>Unplugged in New York</i>, and one from <i>Bleach</i>. Then, of course, there's the bait: the haunting,
    previously unreleased ""You Know You're Right"", recorded during Nirvana's last-ever studio session, and laced
    with tantalizingly literal expressions of the physical and mental pain that dominated the last months of
    Cobain's life.</p><p>
    On the other hand, the very existence of <i>Nirvana</i> is a cynical assessment of the current retail climate--
    a party mix for parents who want to appreciate Cobain's Lennon-esque knack for great melodies without having
    to click past ""Scentless Apprentice"" or ""Territorial Pissings"". With the possible exception of ""Rape Me"",
    <i>Nirvana</i> is utterly inoffensive: an impulse buy from Columbia House, perhaps, with no more artistic
    value than The Eagles' <i>Greatest Hits</i> or the Beatles' <i>1</i>. If the kids want a righteous Nirvana
    mix, they'll burn one-- let the yuppies pad Frances Bean's college fund with their filthy dotcom lucre.</p><p>
<i>Nirvana</i> lies all of its cards on the table immediately with the familiar chugging rhythms of ""You
    Know You're Right"", Novoselic's bass menacing as Cobain rakes the strings above the bridge of his beloved
    Mustang for a dissonant, Thurston Moore-on-Zoloft effect. The song itself is something of a sketch: Kurt
    reportedly rewrote several lyrics just before the recording session and intentionally slurs where the
    words aren't quite there (er, ""Let's talk about someone else/ Steaming soup begins to melt""?). ""You Know
    You're Right"" predictably hits all the familiar Nirvana marks, and pointed lines like, ""I will move away
    from here,"" and, ""Nothing really bothers her/ She just wants to love herself,"" seem aimed directly at Love,
    hinting that ragged dissections of marital discord might have dominated Nirvana's fourth album.</p><p>
    This is one of the most beguiling mysteries of Nirvana: how a thrift store-sweater-wearing kid from
    trailer-park Aberdeen went from the carefree jangle of ""About a Girl"" to the stormy malevolence of ""All
    Apologies"" (which pointedly rhymes ""married"" with ""buried""; Cobain would be both shortly after writing it).
    ""About a Girl"" feigns nonchalance, but there are omens beneath the surface that would haunt much of
    Cobain's short life-- the intrinsically unhealthy relationship that festers more out of apathy and
    convenience than genuine affection. ""I'll take advantage while you hang me out to dry,"" Cobain sings with
    matter-of-factness.</p><p>
    In his liner notes for <i>Nirvana</i>, David Fricke notes that Cobain wrote ""About a Girl"" after an extended
    session listening to <i>Meet the Beatles</i>, and while the connection is not immediately apparent, the song
    does serve as a blueprint for some of Cobain's most tuneful later compositions. Built around a mostly
    two-chord groove, the song veers in unexpected directions for the power choruses, made all the more effective
    by Cobain's unique guitar tuning. It's curious, based on the clean guitars and tinny cymbals that dominate
    here, how Nirvana ever came to be identified with grunge, the genuinely dirty and moody sound more readily
    associated with contemporaries Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Tad than the punk-metal hybrid Nirvana favored.</p><p>
    This is followed by <i>Incesticide</i>'s two most accessible cuts. ""Been a Son"", from 1989's <i>Blew</i> EP,
    sounds like a test run for <i>Nevermind</i>, all rigid harmonies and tight, churning guitar (interestingly,
    the version here restores 30 seconds of music inexplicably cut from the <i>Incesticide</i> mix, including
    Novoselic's bass solo). ""Sliver"", one of the few Nirvana songs to directly address biographical details from
    Cobain's childhood, turns a simple visit to grandma's into a traumatic episode of parental abandonment,
    confusion, and fear.</p><p>
    Next up are the quartet of selections from <i>Nevermind</i>, which rightfully explode from the mix just as
    ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""In Bloom"" seemed to slice through your Passat's shitty speakers on your way
    to high school. I still contend it's Grohl's punishing drum attack and not the famous four-chord riff that
    sells ""Teen Spirit"" (even Cobain admitted the song was a derivative pastiche of Boston's ""More Than a Feeling""
    and The Pixies), though Andy Wallace's slick-as-Valvoline mix remains the gold standard of the soft verse/loud
    chorus dynamic. Likewise, ""Come as You Are"" gleans its hook directly from Novoselic's rubbery bassline
    slithering in and out of the mix with frightening stealth.</p><p>
    But ""Lithium"" and ""In Bloom"" are wholly Cobain's, with references tailor-made for the American everyteen:
    ""Today I've found my friends/ They're in my head""; ""I'm so ugly, but that's okay 'cause so are you."" Both
    knowingly turn the enthusiastic ""yeah yeah yeah's"" of the Beatles into snarling expressions of sarcasm-- an
    allusion literalized in the ""In Bloom"" video, which pitched Nirvana as 60s idols with matching outfits on
    an Ed Sullivan-esque variety show (which in turn inspired the complete wardrobe of vintage Weezer). It's
    interesting how <i>Nevermind</i>, written and recorded well before the crest of sudden fame crushed Cobain's
    spirit, almost seems more jaded than its successor-- ""Teen Spirit"" and ""In Bloom"" deriding fans as mindless
    drones that demand entertainment, yet ""don't know what it means.""</p><p>
    By contrast, <i>In Utero</i>, which begins with the words, ""Teenage angst has paid off well/ Now I'm bored
    and old,"" and ends with an apology, is full of curiously thoughtful retractions and carefully worded
    sentiments. The provocatively titled ""Heart-Shaped Box"" and ""Rape Me"" represent Cobain's sympathy for,
    and fascination with, the female of the species. I've always considered ""Heart-Shaped Box"", with its
    elliptical guitar figure and explosive choruses, to be one of Cobain's most accomplished compositions.
    For all its heavy-handed symbolism, the song strikes deepest to Cobain's preoccupation with birth, the
    menstrual cycle, and female anatomy, wound tightly with primal tension in the verses and released with
    sublime catharsis in the choruses.</p><p>
    But ""Rape Me""-- meant to be an anthem of empowerment from the perspective of the victim-- comes off as a
    shallow and transparent attempt to court controversy. The four-chord riff that drags the song through the
    motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" riff (Nirvana would often
    tease live audiences with a few licks from ""Teen Spirit"" before launching into its intellectually stunted
    first cousin). The seemingly tacked-on bridge (""My favorite inside source/ I'll kiss your open sores"") is
    one of Cobain's most awkward, and I think most of us could have done without the distressed round-robin
    choruses of ""Rape me! Rape me!"" that close the song.</p><p>
    ""Pennyroyal Tea"" is presented here in a ""previously unreleased"" alternate mix (actually, it's widely
    available on the 'clean' version of <i>In Utero</i>) that basically nudges the guitars and Cobain's harmony
    vocals up ever so slightly. The mix was prepared by Scott Litt for a single withdrawn after Cobain's suicide
    (the single included ""I Hate Myself and Want to Die"" as a b-side). Cobain's fascination with female bodily
    processes continues (pennyroyal tea was famously used to induce abortion in colonial America) as he enumerates
    remedies he's tried to relieve his own pain-- warm milk and laxatives, but not heroin.</p><p>
    ""Dumb"" is one of Cobain's most underrated efforts, a populist revision of ""Lithium"" that replaces <i>Nevermind</i>'s
    misanthropy with earnest self-deprecation. With a jaunty guitar hook that rivals ""Polly"" or ""About a Girl"",
    ""Dumb"" finds Cobain not sneering at his fans with distaste, but pining for the simple pleasures of wasting
    time and taking drugs (well, sniffing glue) with his friends. Kera Schaley's cello is ""Dumb""'s secret weapon,
    overshadowing Novoselic's simple bassline and lending the bridge (hands down, Cobain's best) a transcendent
    country-rock lilt: ""Skin the sun, fall asleep/ Wish away, the soul is cheap/ Lesson learned, wish me luck/
    Soothe the burn, wake me up.""  The emphatic harmonies in the final refrains (""I think I'm DUMB, I think I'm
    DUMB..."") are among Cobain's most vulnerable, successfully conveying a deep longing in a way that the
    overambitious ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""Rape Me"" miss completely.</p><p>
<i>Nirvana</i> closes with two cuts from <i>Unplugged in New York</i>: a low-key reading of <i>In Utero</i>'s
    somber ""All Apologies"" and an inspired cover of David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"". Keen selections,
    but unfortunately the loss of fidelity between the crystalline studio recordings and a live performance that
    was only supposed to sound good on TV gives this collection a distinctly incomplete feeling.</p><p>
    So do I give <i>Nirvana</i> a 10.0 for the unimpeachable quality of the material, or a 2.0 for the crass
    cynicism for which it's exploited? I mean, this collection is by no means essential-- <i>Nevermind</i> and
    <i>In Utero</i> are. I almost wish that the release of <i>Nirvana</i> had been postponed another year so that
    Courtney Love could have seen Matador's illuminating and respectful double-disc packaging of Pavement's
    <i>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</i>, which offers the original album, an entire live show, two Peel sessions, three
    singles, and previously unreleased material-- all for the same suggested retail price as <i>Nirvana</i>.
    The packaging includes hand-scribbled pages from Stephen Malkmus' notebooks (but not his whole goddamn diary)
    and liner notes written by band members and people who were actually there-- not just some rockcrit eager to
    unpack his adjectives. It's probably the best reissue of any album I've ever seen, and not just because it's
    an indie rock classic, but because it's assembled with such selfless affection.</p><p>
    By comparison, <i>Nirvana</i> feels like a rush job-- reverent to the memory of Kurt Cobain, but disrespectful,
    even patronizing, of his infinitely patient fans. It would have been fantastic, for instance, to finally hear
    the original Steve Albini mixes of ""All Apologies"" and ""Heart-Shaped Box"", or favorites like ""Sappy"" (a huge
    radio hit here in southern California) and ""Spank Thru"" placed in the greater context of Nirvana's better-known
    repertoire. Dozens of illuminating b-sides and compilation tracks (everything from covers of the Velvet
    Underground and the Wipers to a full-band reading of Grohl's excellent ""Marigold"") are conspicuously absent
    here, doubtlessly because the publishing royalties don't go to Love.  But at least the floodgates are open,
    with both a rarities collection, and yes, that box set finally in the pipeline.</p><p>
    Since words are cheap, though (and Cobain's diaries are only $20.97 over at Amazon), I'll leave you with a
    quote from Cobain himself, quoted by Fricke in defense of this album's crassness: ""All the albums I ever
    liked were albums that delivered a great song, one after the other."" Hey, I like albums like that, too,
    Kurt. It's just that records like <i>Nirvana</i>, with its 24-bit remastering job to smooth the transitions
    between drummers and producers, deprive the listener of the very thing they should be generously supplying:
    context. And while <i>Nirvana</i> does indeed look and sound great, honoring Cobain's legacy with all the
    peace, love, and empathy you can eat, I'll always listen to the original albums instead.</p></div>"|5810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5810-nirvana/|7.0|Will Bryant

Shark</i>.
    Like a lot of novels lately, it was set in a not-too-distant future where people's lives are so entangled
    with pointless consumerism and cable infotainment (and the all-consuming spectacle of a robotic bear fighting
    a robotic shark) that they're largely unable to have profitable relationships with one another beyond languid
    discussions of same. You've heard this complaint before: everything increasingly mediated and branded, less
    and less of our emotional lives untouched by commerce and commentary. From the early 70s to the mid-80s
    this still seemed like an important issue to address, but at this late date it looks bankrupt and repugnant:
    if Batchelder's complaint is that we should have something more ""meaningful"" in our lives, surely his job is
    to quit fretting over the cable box and figure out what that thing might be. He can blame it on consumerism
    and sporting spectacles all he wants-- the central point of <i>Bear v. Shark</i> remains that its own author
    can't give us the very thing he's claiming we need.</p><p>
    
    I say all this to explain what's so special about ""Bulk Removal Truck"", a track on Franklin Bruno's new
    record, <i>A Cat May Look at a Queen</i>. Bruno started his career with the word ""clever"" stamped across
    his forehead, playing verbose power-pop with Nothing Painted Blue and rhyming five-syllable words-- but his
    songs, about things like office supplies and urban development, had a knack for unironically addressing The
    Way We Live Now. His solo career has seen him mellow on the clever and work doubly hard on the real, putting
    him in a league with sometimes-collaborators John Darnielle (Mountain Goats) and John Vanderslice: people
    trying very hard to write songs about the complex highs and lows of people's unglamorous everyday lives.
    ""Bulk Removal Truck"" is Bruno's biggest success at this yet. Over a fingerpicked acoustic guitar, he begins:</p><p>
<i>Peter Hughes was out of town<br/>
    when our lease expired.<br/>
    So I turned some temp work down<br/>
    and did what was required<br/>
    to get the house as well prepared<br/>
    for walkthrough as I could.</i></p><p>
    
    What follows is really an emotional masterpiece of the everyday, the cleaning up of the things that actually
    comprise most of our lives: books, coats, Post-It notes, freezers in need of defrosting. It's a litany of
    waterlogged settees and security deposits gliding into a simple, unexpected metaphor: ""This is how it ends--
    friends are lost to lovers, and lovers lost to friends.""</p><p>
    
    It's the sort of sentiment-- and song, and album-- best appreciated in certain wistful contexts: during the
    bad hours of a killer drive, for instance, when you've already listened to every disc in the car and anything
    with a kickdrum or a power chord would seem as obnoxious as having Andrew ""Dice"" Clay in the passenger seat.
    Hangovers; Sunday mornings; trying to get to sleep once the sun's already battering the blinds; listening
    after you've already got the whole thing memorized. It's spacious and low-key and great-sounding: most tracks
    work from subdued guitar, with double bass, cello, trumpet, or light percussion rounding out the minimal
    arrangements. A lot of songs go country-western; others take on the form of jazz standards and bossa nova
    pop. Breezy; friendly.</p><p>
    
    Also writerly: a collection of very short stories as much as anything else, with the instrumentation largely
    playing support for the texts. The exhausted-sounding ""Tired of the West"" is a winner both in music and in
    metaphor, the giving-up lament of the would-be pioneer who strikes out for a new life and eventually finds
    it as disappointing as the old one; the stately musette-and-piano title track makes exactly the self-deprecating
    apology one expects; the third-wheel story of ""Dashboard Issues"" has a tossed-off charm that deepens into
    something near-perfect. ""Blue's the Only Color"", on the other hand, is a trifling faux piano-bar number--
    you can probably guess what comes after ""blue's the only color of the rainbow""-- and the more swinging
    ""Love's Got a Ghetto"" doesn't exactly take that conceit anywhere valuable. The album's centerpiece, ""Janet
    Shaw"", is an ominously sprawling and only partly successful rummage through the keepsakes of a one-time
    starlet.</p><p>
    
    Hits and misses, then. What's amazing is how literature's working through its own crisis of confidence has
    put songwriters in such a position to take up its traditional role. It's not that pop music-- or indie rock,
    or what have you-- doesn't tell us anything about our lives, but there's something to the way guys like Bruno
    and Darnielle approach it that's difficult to get elsewhere: these are the people that can sort through the
    banality of the life that everyone complains about-- the cluttered bedrooms and beat-up cars and undramatic
    breakups-- and, when they get it right, locate what it is in there that makes it important to us. And as
    with most writerly records, this one only seems to be growing on me.</p></div>"|980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/980-a-cat-may-look-at-a-queen/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

Slap fives with the other team, pack up the equipment, get your Little
    Debbies and Capri Suns from Mrs Freed; it's time to go home.  Garage rock, I mean.  It's probably silly--
    no, it's <i>definitely</i> silly-- to declare a scene that was 80% media as D.O.A., but an album like The
    Datsuns' debut will drive a man to such pointless hyperbole.  A few months back I declared, in a review of
    the brilliant-by-comparison Selby Tigers, that garage rock had reached minute #12 on its Warhol watch.
    It's now on 16.</p><p>
    If The Datsuns serve any purpose, it's to remind us that 70s glam/garage-rock was largely accountable for
    the abomination that was 80s hair-metal (or wait, is that cool now?  I forgot to check the Brit mags this
    week).  When the guitarists start feeling the urge to show off how fast their digits can fly, when singers
    really, <i>really</i> want you to know that they're just fucking thrashing all around that stage, dude, when
    lyrics take the slightest little turn toward macho and misogyny... hey, look what you got!  Mötley Crüe
    without the recording budget!</p><p>
    And speaking of which, all this self-consciously gritty production is starting to get on my nerves.  V2
    should know better, being the label that bought the White Stripes from Sympathy-- ""Fell in Love with a Girl""
    was a hit with me, my 16-year-old sister and the demographics we represent because of Jack White's song, not
    the over-EQed production.  It would've been a hit if it were sung by Justin Timberlake on a slick Neptunes
    beat, or Tim McGraw in laminated Nashville; the energy is inherent.  The Datsuns don't have exuberance
    imbedded in their material, they just have in-quotes ""attitude"" and songs called ""Motherfucker from Hell""
    and ""Fink for the Man"" recorded in a tar pit.</p><p>
    Seriously, if you're going to break into mid-song Skynyrd freakouts (""Freeze Sucker"") go ahead and record
    it well, and while you're at it, lose the aren't-we-clever retro-reference band name. Market songs like
    ""Lady"", with its pole-swinging riff and upper-register screeches, to the strip club circuit where it belongs.
    Don't forget to pay royalties to Steven Tyler for them yowls, MC5 for the aesthetic, and the Nuge for all
    the riffs.  And please, please, please give the cowbell from ""What Would I Know"" back to Blue Oyster Cult.</p><p>
    Face it, all the good ""garage"" bands (Hives, McLusky) are halfway intelligent plain-simple punk from foreign
    lands, or pop in thrift store clothing like The Strokes.  Let's stop using the term altogether and boycott
    The Nouns bands, and hope the labels realize that people just couldn't give a fuck about bands like The
    Datsuns.</p></div>"|2178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2178-the-datsuns/|2.8|Rob Mitchum

    I can't imagine a more apt description for Geir Jenssen's latest excursion into ambient deep listening.  After
    following an Aphexian trajectory with his releases on Apollo, the ambient sublabel of Belgium's R&amp;S; Records,
    Jenssen veered from the padded sci-fi-inspired techno of <i>Microgravity</i> and <i>Patashnik</i> with 1997's
    <i>Substrata</i>, a genre-defining exploration of drifting soundscapes. <i>Substrata</i> remains for many the
    album that perfectly expresses the serenity and intensity of Arctic wildernesses, a landscape Jenssen knows
    intimately, having spent much of his life in the Norwegian Arctic Circle.</p><p>
    
    In 2000, Jenssen nearly eclipsed the success of <i>Substrata</i> with <i>Cirque</i>, a frequently frosty
    submerging of excerpted conversations and found environmental sounds that rivals Wolfgang Voigt's Gas
    project in its rumbling, gauzy beauty.  Jenssen again relies on found sound as source material for
    <i>Shenzhou</i>, but this time, the found sound is old vinyl recordings of the orchestral works of French
    Impressionist composer and ambient precursor, Claude Debussy. Jenssen lifts fragments of these scratched
    records in a similar manner as he did for <i>Cirque</i>'s ""Black Lamb Grey Falcon"" and ""Iberia Eterea"".</p><p>
    
    The ten tracks (out of the dozen on the album) that follow this model all begin as a barely audible hum,
    like a small electrical transformer, out of which the dust-dappled loops of Debussy's woodwind, brass, and
    strings emerge, condense, and fade out into pink noise rustles.  Unlike Steve Reich's phase pieces or Brian
    Eno's <i>Discreet Music</i>, though, Jenssen doesn't set his loops against each other to produce juxtapositions
    and piquant dissonance; he uses them to describe imagined terrain, at first glance monotonously flat and
    barren, but on concentration, replete with minute detailing. The overall effect of these pieces is a sense
    of immensity. The orchestral loops sound distant, abandoned in a vast wilderness, and strenuously battling
    against Arctic winds. Jenssen sets the listener down in this wilderness as an aloof observer, a witness to
    the music's futile struggles against entropic forces.</p><p>
    
    The two tracks not derived from Debussy share the same hypnotic aesthetic. The brief interlude ""Bose-Einstein
    Condension"" is a loop of piano chords lolloping in search of coherence, while ""Gravity Assist"" is a longer
    voyage into woofer-quaking low-frequency manipulation, bell-like drones, and contrails of subdued noise.
    I can't help but feel that these tracks fit awkwardly and break up the conceptual flow of the album.  This,
    however, is a minor quibble given the power of this music. <i>Shenzhou</i> is unquestionably a magic vessel,
    but one that reveals its enchantment only to those who pay close attention.</p></div>"|709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/709-shenzhou/|7.8|Paul Cooper

At first, the term seemed mainly limited to whiny hardcore
    bands, but now the term gets thrown around about Bright Eyes, Hot Hot Heat, and just about any band that
    expresses human emotion.  If the spread of the term isn't contained in short order, everything aside from
    Kraftwerk and Cabaret Voltaire will be reducible to a three-letter word.  Fuck that noise. There's a time
    and place for emotion in music-- sometimes (and I realize how revolutionary this sounds) even for the cloying,
    overbearing kind.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p><p>
    Although The Velvet Teen tend to play heavy on the emotional drama (courtesy of Judah Nagler's overwhelming
    falsetto) and shallow on actual substance, they display a knack for occasionally pulling themselves out of
    that emotional filth and into something approximating true sincerity without the slightest hint of forcing
    it.  Or, at least, they used to; the now out-of-print <i>Comasynthesis</i> and <i>Great Beast February</i>
    EPs from The Velvet Teen's early days (i.e. the days before the release of their only other album, <i>Out
    of the Fierce Parade</i>) are proof.  The vast, aimless compositions and iron-fisted emotional pomp that
    hamstrung their debut are in their embryonic stages here, but haven't yet become the crushing dead weight
    they later would.</p><p>
    Come back with me, won't you?  You see, in their formative prehistory, before they adopted the sound of a
    soporific Radiohead cliché, they were easily referenced somewhere between the late, oft-remembered Velocity
    Girl and Death Cab for Cutie on the handy-dandy indie rock influence-o-meter.  These EPs see the Teen
    vacillating between superball tempos and jangling riffs, and sonic Nyquil, courtesy of soothing electronics
    and a comparatively spare dose of Judah Nagler's baby grand.  And even though they never find a way to put
    much musical distance between themselves and their ancestry, the homage is always faithful.  In particular,
    the gorgeous opening one-two of ""Naked Girl"" and ""Counting Backwards"" summon forth hooks of fearsome potency--
    pop can rarely equal the mind-expanding ecstasy of Velocity Girl's ""My Forgotten Favorite"" or ""Sorry Again"",
    but these two are half a candyflip away.</p><p>
    They slow things down with ease, as well, as the surreal dream-lounge of ""Super Me"" demonstrates, but what
    ultimately kills the early buzz of the <i>Plus Minus Equals</i> collection is a lack of focus.  Between
    focusing on their primary reference points, The Velvet Teen veers off to include some of the piano-heavy
    Radiohead bites they'll later dwell on, to mixed effect, and one isolated, absolutely obscene attempt at
    Dismemberment Plan emulation, entitled ""Never Happy"".</p><p>
    If it sounds as though The Velvet Teen are guilty of nothing more impressive than a semi-random assortment
    of musical appropriations, you'd be right in terms of the music.  But it's Judah Nagler's voice that saves
    the day (no pun intended).  Folks may bristle at the wearying pomp of his Yorkian falsetto, and I'll admit
    that the melodramatic sentimentality of it can be stifling, but the EPs on <i>Plus Minus Equals</i> never
    allow it to become overbearing.  Besides, he's a talented vocalist in the classical sense, and lack of
    subtlety or not, it alone is capable of distancing these songs from their obvious influences and bringing
    everything together beautifully.</p></div>"|8432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8432-plus-minus-equals/|7.0|Eric Carr

How is it they crank out so much, so often? I envision the writer     huddled over a typewriter, the painter peering into the canvas, the musician stroking a guitar-- all into the     wee hours of the morning, skin sweaty and pale from lack of sleep and sunlight. Their only company is a bottle     of whiskey and maybe a lazy dog. I think pain. I think isolation.</p><p>But what's even worse is when the prolific artist makes it look easy. John Updike, for instance, spits out     novels like hockey players spit out teeth, and without even a trace of pain. The same goes for Georgia native     Jack Logan, who has averaged about an album a year since he burst onto the scene in 1994 with his aptly titled     two-disc debut, <em>Bulk</em>, which contained no less than 42 songs.  Even worse: that collection was whittled     down from around 600 tracks demoed over the previous decade.</p><p>So, yes, Jack Logan likes to write a lot of country- and blues-inspired rock'n'roll songs. Whether he does     so with ease remains unknown, but he sure sounds relaxed most of the time, even when cranking up the electric     guitar a little bit. Perhaps recognizing that this combination-- being prolific with apparent ease-- could     be a pitfall of mediocrity, Logan mixes it up as best he can. In this case, he has enlisted friend Bob Kimbell     of pop band Weird Summer.</p>
<p>The two have hooked up before, for 1998's <em>Little Private Angel</em>. That record was spotty, but there were     enough bright spots to suggest a second Logan/Kimbell album might be in order, all the kinks presumably having     been worked out in their first effort together. And so it happens, that's largely the case with <em>Woodshedding</em>,     a collaboration that doesn't at all sound like a collaboration-- almost always a good sign.</p>
<p>""Further South"" gets the leisurely beat rolling, with just enough harmonica, pedal steel and tambourine to     ease the listener into the mood of the fall season (notice the leaves on the cover). Logan and Kimbell are     attributed as co-writers for the entire album and, somewhat surprisingly, it's not always clear who's     responsible for which tracks. Nonetheless, kudos to whoever wrote, ""This river meets an ocean further south/     With New Orleans on the corner of its mouth/ The sin runs down from the people in the towns/ And runs to the     ocean further south.""</p>
<p>Kimball is likely responsible for the light pop of ""Host of the Party"", with its peppy drumbeat, saxophones     and subtle keyboards.  But I'll have to blame him for ""I Still Miss Her Dog"", a knee-slapping, tongue-in-cheek     ode to (obviously) an ex-girlfriend's dog. Logan's fingerprints, meanwhile, are all over the somewhat bland     rock of ""Legs and Brains"", which recalls the lesser moments of his major label debut, 1999's <em>Buzz Me In</em>.     He then delivers, however, on the stellar rock number ""Ripped It Away"" and the more brooding reflections of     ""Nothing but the Sky"" and ""Just as You Are"", which highlight his two strengths: a smooth, sturdy voice and     thoughtful lyrics.</p>
<p>I can't blame Logan for being prolific. It's just the way he is (and at least he doesn't flaunt it like Ryan     Adams does). That said, Logan does suffer a little from the sameness that plagues Updike, which perhaps     explains why they're both able to produce at such a rate-- with each new book and album, they never stray     too far from their artistic home.  And this is why <em>Woodshedding</em> is, if nothing else, a welcome effort.     With the help of a friend, Logan sheds some of that sameness without seeming desperate for change.</p>

    of a debut, <i>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top</i>, was first issued last year on
    the Gern Blandsten label.  Then, earlier this year, the record got reissued by Mute, spawning an immediate
    press frenzy with journalists across the globe wondering just who, exactly, was this new ""The"" band?  But
    the media quickly realized that this record would not easily lend itself to mainstream marketability, and
    not just because there's no ""The"" in the name Liars.  The attention served the band well, though, because
    while they may be about as far as you can possibly get from garage rock revivalism, their music is a thing
    of raw, jagged beauty, and one of the more original sounds to emerge from the indie rock underground this
    year.</p><p>
<i>They Threw Us All in a Trench</i> was a brilliant portrait of tenuous restraint, fluctuating wildly
    between a noise sharp and vicious enough to shred through an entire offensive line, and periods of tense
    too-calmness designed to lull its victims into a trance-induced state of false security before the storm
    arrived again.  This startling ebb and flow produced a kind of frenetic delirium, as all expectations of
    what was to come were thrown out just before the music finally culminated in a mesmerizing locked groove.</p><p>
    
    So you may wonder how such epic unpredictability can be followed-- and Liars have an answer for you.  In
    continued defiance of expectation come two EPs, separating and isolating the two key aspects of the band's
    sound: tense fury and furious tension.  Driving post-punk guitar rhythms and Angus Andrew's vocal spitfire
    are six minutes of unstoppable force on <i>We No Longer Knew Who We Were</i>, which collides sharply
    with the immovable opacity of <i>Fins to Make Us More Fish-Like</i>'s experimental edge.  Individually,
    these EPs highlight one of the band's strongest elements in condensed, cohesive form; taken together, they
    throw Liars' range and invention into impressive relief.  Whether slumming with the straight-ahead post-punk
    mechanics of <i>We No Longer Knew Who We Were</i>, or creating frayed, surreal otherworlds on
    <i>Fins to Make Us More Fish-Like</i>, Liars continually shatter preconceptions.</p><p>
    
    ""We Got Cold, Coughed, and Forgot Things"" typifies the aggravated assault of <i>We No Longer Knew</i> as
    Pat Nature's bass opens the record, careening back and forth amid a driving beat supplied by Ron Albertson.
    Momentum builds until Aaron Hemphill cuts through the fray like a blowtorch, his guitar's vicious whine
    evoking a bandsaw clattering against solid stone with calculated, machine-gun rhythm and deadly accuracy--
    it takes charge of the song the moment it arrives on the scene.  The guitar work is so dominant, in fact,
    that Andrew's vocals take on an almost subliminal quality as they seethe inches removed from the surface.
    He screams, ""When my mind is weak/ You always let me know,"" before truly breaking through the dissonance,
    and only then does it sink in that you've been hearing him for the last minute or so without fully realizing
    it.  The effect is subtle, and all the more striking for it.</p><p>
    
    The anthemic pseudo-choruses and dancefloor appeal of the three tracks on <i>We No Longer Knew</i> are the
    common thread, but Liars still find opportunity for strange interludes like the mid-song breakdown in
    ""You Know I Hate Stupid Phones"", during which Andrew speaks confessionally as the clamor in the background
    cuts instantly to deafening silence.  This sort of disorientation is Liars' stock-in-trade.  As tempting
    as it might be to pigeonhole them as nothing more than art-punks emulating the groove-oriented 70s groups
    like Gang of Four, Liars are simply too bizarre to validate those claims, even on a disc as traditionally
    structured as this one.  That dedication to the unexpected is good news.  Because even while <i>We No Longer
    Knew</i> warrants such comparisons with a decidedly ""song-oriented"" focus, the band is equally focused
    on keeping the listener off-balance.  Listening to this group is never simply a passive experience.</p><p>
    
    Furthering this end of the sound is the <i>Fish-Like</i> EP.  ""Pillars Were Hollow and Filled With Candy, So
    We Knocked Them Down"" and ""Every Day Is a Child with Teeth"" both seize on Liars' unstructured, improvisational
    tendencies, leading to strange, violent noisescapes.  ""Pillars"" opens the disc with Liars at their mind-cleansing
    best.  Andrew repeatedly shouts, ""Do something magical and disappear,"" over a cardiac disco tempo and a
    storm of echo-laden vocals before he counts down to the song's furious build and searing rhythmic feedback.
    ""Every Day Is a Child with Teeth"" is less entrancing, with its ritualistic chant anchoring a hollow backdrop
    of almost random sound.  Although the track itself is fascinating, its formlessness creates the weakest
    moment of either of the two EPs.</p><p>
    
    A cleaner, clearer version of ""Grown Men Don't Fall in the River, Just Like That"" closes <i>Fish-Like</i>
    with a bang, though, releasing the tension accrued from the first two tracks with what is still Liars'
    greatest achievement.  This song is a true embodiment of nervous post-punk energy, and this rendition even
    improves on the original by allowing its shouted refrains to ring louder and the guitars to buzz more shrilly.
    More than anything else Liars have done, this song is a testament of things to come.  With their debut and
    these two EPs, the band has easily proven that they do indeed have their ""fingers on the pulse of America"";
    now it's time for them to run with it.</p></div>"|4763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4763-we-no-longer-knew-who-we-were-ep-and-fins-to-make-us-more-fish-like-ep/|8.8|Eric Carr

    bend to my every whim.  That is, as soon I can manage to figure out what the electrical diagrams in the plan
    mean.  And then I suppose I'd need several million dollars worth of equipment and raw materials.  And I
    suppose The MacArthur Foundation denies genius grants for this type of thing.  Bastards.</p><p>
    
    Well, at any rate, I'd like to thank Stephen Lawrie and Jo Doran of The Telescopes for providing
    me with the plans for this death ray in the artwork of their latest album.  Never hurts to dream.  I'll
    wager a chocolate-frosted Krispy Kreme that Kim Jong Il is poring over this shit right now looking for the
    key to controlling the whole Korean Peninsula.  There's something sort of apt about The Telescopes including
    such a diagram in their artwork, though-- it fits the futurist theme of the music, for one thing, and with a
    record like this, they sound like they might be poised to take over the world.</p><p>
    
    Everyone's favorite band from Burton-upon-Trent, England has a lengthy history, dating back to the glory
    days of gazing at shoes whilst coaxing feedback from six-strings.  Back then, there were five Telescopes,
    and they distinguished themselves by experimenting with instrumental textures outside of the guitars and
    effects that the other shoegazers were using.   They split in 1995, with Doran and Lawrie moving on to
    establish Unisex, whose debut album, <i>Stratosfear</i>, impressed me a few years ago with its deep-space
    lounge and day-glo exotica.</p><p>
    
    It's a bit puzzling, actually, as to why the two chose to go back to the Telescopes name for <i>Third Wave</i>,
    as this serves pretty well as a follow-up to <i>Stratosfear</i>.  Lawrie keeps his hands on the helm at all
    times, and guides you through a series of inventive, oddball tracks that hold together remarkably well for
    such a wide-ranging collection.   There's the spy-on-Mars jazz noir of ""A Good Place to Hide"" and the drifting,
    soupy electro of ""You &amp; I Are the Foxboy Noises"", and in between everything from clarinets and violins to
    Atari samples and home-made grooveboxes.</p><p>
    
    Anyone who ever played ""Space Invaders"" will recognize the core rhythm of ""Tesla Death Ray"", which centers
    on a sample of the descending alien ships, in addition to Black &amp; Decker drills, toy car, stylophone and
    some deeply vocodered vocals.  Opener ""A Cabin in the Sky"" features the close harmonies of Doran and Lawrie
    moving cautiously through a <i>Terminator</i>-bleak futureworld of cold piano, processed laughter, ectoplasmic
    strings, and Theremin.   Horns hang in a loosely organized cloud over the tabla-inflected beats of ""3D Jesus
    Ashtray"", but note: those tablas are employed for their specific sonic qualities, and not to give the track
    an Eastern feel.</p><p>
    
    Lawrie and co-producer Angus Wallace give the whole thing a deep, bass-rich treatment that makes every last
    electronic flourish and fuzzed-out blast go down easy.  It's humorous, unique, laid-back, beautiful and
    chaotic by equal measures, and for music that was so obviously a serious labor to put together, it all
    sounds amazingly fluid and natural.  <i>Third Wave</i> may not put you any closer to ruling the world, but
    hey, that just gives you more time to listen to it.  Call me  I think I'm willing to trade just a little bit of
    global domination for that.</p></div>"|7965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7965-third-wave/|8.3|Joe Tangari

That's right.  They play sea shanties.</p><p>
    
    Of course, that's just one of a million things The Coral does on their hyper-eclectic debut, a pop pastiche
    that jumps across a dozen genres during the course of its 40+ minutes.  And though the just-out-of-their-teens
    sextet, who come from a ""nondescript seaside town"" outside Liverpool, are as diverse and well-polished as
    their fellow <i>NME</i> cabin boys The Vines, you at least aren't overcome with the urge to punch these kids
    in the face.  After all, The Coral are much more talented, and singer James Skelly's confident, sneer-free
    vocals lend just the right amount of weight to the music.  I'm guessing he'll sound even better after he
    takes up clove cigarettes and whiskey.</p><p>
    
    We first heard about The Coral back in September of last year when, during an interview, Clinic mentioned
    them to us as one of their favorite bands of the moment.  The two sound nothing alike, of course, excepting
    that their influences are far too numerous to list.  One thing I can say with some certainty, though, is
    that The Coral must have grown up digging through their mums' Merseybeat vinyl and dads' psych-rock
    collections: the first spaceshot note on the album cribs from Pink Floyd's ""See Emily Play"", and the bridge
    to ""Goodbye"" references it a bit, too, though while sounding predominantly like a Turtles song.  Elsewhere,
    the folky ""Simon Diamond"" sets the life of the professional wrestler to a bouncy remake of the old traditional,
    ""John Barleycorn Must Die"", and extra guitars whiz around like bugs, with Nick Power's organ needling home
    the period feel.</p><p>
    
    With a quick-stepping rhythm section and two horn players in the band (Bill Ryder-Jones on trumpet, Paul
    Duffy on sax), The Coral also take a reasonable stab at British ska-pop; ""Dreaming of You"" sounds like Jim
    Morrison fronting Madness.  It's a likeable single, but it would have blown away like so much fluff twenty
    years ago; and while it proves that the band is capable of turning out well-produced dance numbers, the most
    disposable tracks-- like ""Bad Man""-- mark them as this close to becoming England's answer to the Cherry
    Poppin' Daddies.</p><p>
    
    So as weird as it may seem, it's on the sea shanties that the band finds its voice.  For whatever reason,
    they really open up on the nautically themed tracks: ""Skeleton Key"" is a massive beatdown where the pounding
    drums and jittery guitars set up a bellowing chorus; the verse-only opener ""Spanish Main"" makes them sound
    like genuinely scary men of the sea.  And even on a quieter numbers like ""Shadows Fall"", the reggae beat and
    laborers' harmony vocals blend well with the sax part, psychedelic frills, and shuffle.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes the band seems more curious than inventive.  They're swollen up with ideas but don't always have
    an original hook or clear idea to attach them to.  There's definitely a lot to like throughout this disc;
    the band has boatloads of talent, and the eclectic spread gels much better than you'd expect.  But they're
    at their best when they're more raucous than clever.  If the sea shanties work for any reason, it's because
    they're labor songs, tunes about working hard and playing hard.  That's a great lifestyle for any young
    band, and a better goal than just ripping off the 60s.</p></div>"|1602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1602-the-coral/|6.8|Chris Dahlen

    transition into manhood, few could have foreseen a time when mining the likes of Superdrag and Kula Shaker
    would be considered revolutionary or groundbreaking. Herr Schreiber and I used to ease into ""120 Minutes""
    by pounding the hops, laughing at the Eels, and telling ourselves that someday, someone will put everything
    in its right place. Now the playful buoyancy of 1997s past has been usurped by a tense desperation, broken
    only by darting eyes and muffled scoffs when Ryan sees my hand reaching for the Electric Soft Parade.</p><p>
    
    It's surprising to see how well <i>Holes in the Wall</i> holds up under the weight of its own hype. The
    British music press almost couldn't unsticky their promos open after Ed O'Brien cited the album's
    guitar-driven sound as an influence on Radiohead's as-yet-untitled sixth LP. Opening the bill for
    <i>NME</i>-darlings Oasis didn't hurt them much, either. Fact is, though, that the Electric Soft Parade--
    who, reportedly, added the 'Electric' modifier after being legally arraigned by a Doors cover band-- are
    not here to galvanize the industry. And damn, do they pop/rock while doing it.</p><p>
    
    It's true that sibling chemistry has been known to lead to an early musical fruition. Keeping in the
    tradition of Oasis, principle songwriters and part-time brothers Tom &amp; Alex White share an amazing knack
    for melodic derivation and emphasized vocal treatments. Unfortunately for your indie cred, this time it
    works, thanks in no small part to the long electro-psychedelic excursions only hinted at by your favorite
    fey Brit-rockers.</p><p>
    
    Things begin modestly enough with the tormented sludge rock of ""Start Again"", immediately invoking the ghost
    of Suede. As the song suddenly shifts dynamic from murky grunge to a synthetic, trippy-dippy verse (replete
    with phaser effects and everything), we're introduced to the White Brothers' similarly charcoal-steeped
    vocals. Luckily for ESP, <i>Holes in the Walls</i>' litany of cliched lyrical sentiments falls to the
    wayside of Chris Hughes' heart-wrenching production, which wraps even the most unforgivable of lines
    (""You never took the time to look at what you've got/ And all the times you fell/ I was there to pick you
    up"") in inviting and, occasionally, inventive sonic textures. Elsewhere, on the disc's title track, the
    group turn in their token attempt at balladry, albeit with more muscle than a whole legion of 'next
    Radioheads'.</p><p>
    
    But the album's real highlight is the schizophrenic ""Silent to the Dark"", a nine-minute jam that looms over
    the band's other accomplishments and finds the group indulging in all manner of studio trickery. The song
    begins, ingenuously enough, as an atypical exercise in teen angst (read: emo) shortly before bursting into
    a Specter-induced wall of sound faintly reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s <i>Lift Your Skinny
    Fists</i>. As whirring synths proffer the white noise a sense of foundation, bits of song begin to
    reestablish themselves before the band fully commits to reprising the chorus once more.</p><p>
    
    So, in between the instrumental intelligence and the lyrical negligence, what are you left with?  Well, with
    <i>Holes in the Walls</i>, the Electric Soft Parade have crafted a debut that, despite its often forced
    accessibility, aches with potential unrealized. And, while Electric Soft Parade is still yet to write a
    song that would justify such a pretentious bandname, it's comforting to know that they've got the chops
    to perhaps pull it off someday.</p></div>"|2736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2736-holes-in-the-wall/|7.0|Kevin Adickes

    across a record like <i>The Science of Breath</i>. Polmo Polpo is Sandro Perri of Toronto, and while his
    music falls squarely into the techno realm, his is the loud and tattered kind that does away with clubland
    precision and pop niceties. There's no room on this stage for a diva; these basslines are about as sensual
    as rusty butcher knife. Rather than relishing the beauty of clean open space, Perri stuffs up the cracks
    with noise and static.</p><p>
    
    In one way, <i>The Science of Breath</i> is like the other side of the dancefloor glitch coin. While artists
    like Matthew Herbert and Luomo take the sound of digital mistakes the compress them into spaces small enough
    to become whatever percussion instrument suits the composition (crackling noises make good hi-hats), Sandro
    Perri lets the noise stay noise. All of these tracks course with persistent hiss that ebbs and flows but
    never disappears.  The Polmo Polpo trademark may well be that a track never-- not even for a microsecond--
    makes it down to 0 dB. There's always something happening, and it's usually quite loud.</p><p>
    
    Another interesting thing about Polmo Polpo is the incorporation of guitar and laptop steel into tracks with
    pounding beats. Perri's manner with the ringing guitar as a source of rhythm is at times reminiscent of the
    sampled guitar work found on Burger/Ink's <i>Las Vegas</i>. Indeed, the Wolfgang Voigt connection is strong
    throughout, but Perri remains fixated in the earlier, darker Gas material, where murky string samples and an
    aquatic kickdrum were all that was needed to conjure an atmosphere of anxiety and dread. No lush pop-ambient
    sonics to be found here.</p><p>
    
    Perri can also compose for the body. ""Acqua"" is the most punishing yet strangely addictive bit of dancefloor
    fodder I've heard this year: the snare sounds like a plumber's wrench being slammed against a 55-gallon drum;
    the hi-hat upbeat could well the sampled whine of pneumatic machinery; dense clouds of hiss float through
    the track for no apparent reason; a funk guitar riff repeats endlessly; and then weaving through the morass
    is a rather beautiful and snakelike melody played on lap steel. The utterly unique ""Acqua"" is guaranteed to
    get some part of my body moving every time I hear it.  Three other tracks focus on the dance beats, and while
    none have the over-the-top drive of ""Acqua,"" all are at least good. ""Riva"" has a particularly hypnotic steel
    guitar riff tensing and flexing like a large rubber band, giving the comparatively tame house beats a
    melancholy, end-of-an-era feel.</p><p>
    
    The dance tracks were previously released as twelve-inch singles geared toward the DJ set. Stitching these
    are a series of dark ambient interludes (all reference breathing), and here, too, Perri shows skill. The
    twangy guitar mixed with drones on ""Low Breathing"" veer toward the post-rock sound of Fly Pan Am, while the
    gurgling electronic throb of ""Complete Breath"" would make a nice piece of experimental film music. Though
    they came from different times and were meant for different audiences, the alternating tracks work well in
    sequence. <i>The Science of Breath</i> offers a tug toward techno's dark side that is difficult (and
    pointless) to resist.</p></div>"|6387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6387-the-science-of-breath/|7.8|Mark Richardson

    Watching a master work the wheels is every bit as inspiring and transcendent as witnessing Tony Williams or
    Andres Segovia at their prime.  If you've ever seen Q-Bert dissect an original break, draw out an individual
    beat from that break, and reconstruct that beat on the spot to build a wholly different rhythm, you know
    what I'm talking about.  If you understand the myriad of scratches employed over the course of a DJ set, and
    how they build and play off one another, you know what I'm talking about.  Although there are still those
    who would argue that the manipulation of prerecorded music doesn't require the same technical virtuosity as
    that of a traditional musician, I would argue that creatively harnessing an almost limitless sound palette
    is every bit as involved and difficult as moving your fingers up and down a guitar neck.</p><p>
    With that said, I also understand why turntablist albums have yet to garner as much commercial attention as
    other forms of hip-hop. For one thing, the art form is relatively new and the artistry behind it remains
    largely esoteric; for the most part, neither the mainstream music consumer nor the high-art, traditional
    music establishment has yet to grasp the nuances of turntablism. The deconstructive approach to rhythm and
    the cubist, cut-n-paste compositional arrangements sound cacophonous and random to the uninitiated and lack
    the rhythmic thump or lyrical immediacy of other forms of hip-hop.</p><p>
    With <i>Sound Event</i>, Rob Swift, who is one of the genre's greats, has succeeded in creating an album
    that has as much visceral impact as it does technical virtuosity, as much soul as it does science. It reaches
    for innovation while paying respect to the genre's conventions. It alternates between the round and soulful
    resonance of early 90s NYC hip-hop (e.g. Pete Rock and DITC) and the more mathematical angles of late-90s,
    ISP-inspired turntablism.</p><p>
    Perhaps the greatest strength of <i>Sound Events</i>, though, is its ability to incorporate other genres
    without diluting its own. On ""The Great Caper"", Swift enlists the help of Dujeous? guitarist Taylor Rivelli
    and bassist Alex Gale for a sweaty jazzy number that's a testament to Swift's ability to trade chops with
    the best of 'em. ""Salsa Scratch"", featuring legendary Spanish music pianist Bob James, may be the most
    satisfying turntablist composition in years. It's a family affair, paying homage to Swift's father, who
    came to the United States from Columbia, and featuring his mother on the track's introduction.  The
    limitlessly talented D-Styles shows up and lays down a series of sublimely expressionistic scratches, and
    Bob James, who's worked with Freddie Hubbard and Grover Washington among others, graces the keys with his
    trademark Latino flavor.  Sure, we've seen the turntable incorporated into countless xFC-metal, R&amp;B;, and
    ""experimental"" jazz compositions, but rarely has the turntable been used as a primary instrument and mingled
    with other genres more naturally, or with as much subtly as it is on ""Salsa Scratch"".</p><p>
    ""The Ghetto"" finds Swift reflecting the paranoia, crime, and poverty that have claimed his friends.  It may
    be a somewhat cliched theme, but Swift draws water from dry ground with his brilliant use of vocal samples.
    ""Sub-Level"", featuring J-Live, may be the most immediately accessible track on the album.  Swift once again
    proves that he knows how to produce for an emcee, a skill that seems to elude lesser turntablists.  He lays
    down a frantic, constantly morphing beat as the super-hot J-Live offers his opinions on the current state of
    underground hip-hop:  ""The rich act poor and the poor claim rich/ ...When you fronting on the mic, you still
    the industry's bitch.""</p><p>
    The genius of this album is not only Rob Swift's skill, but also the restraint he shows in displaying his
    considerable talent.  While every scratch and rhythmic twist is on point, Swift never allows his skills to
    overwhelm his compositions.  The scratches are chosen and inserted for emotional resonance, and not as a
    self-indulgent display of turntable mastery.  ""Once you have an understanding that scratches are a form
    of communication,"" Swift explains in the liner notes, ""you gradually realize that scratches are like words.
    Using long, dictionary words doesn't necessarily make you a great speaker.  It's about knowing your audience
    and understanding that sometimes simple words make the greatest impact.""   I couldn't have said it better.</p></div>"|7668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7668-sound-event/|8.3|Sam Chennault

He cut his teeth on
    scatterbrained no-fi folk music, but he made his millions from sentimental balladry and Gap commercials.
    He's the scruffiest, gamiest shambler you'll ever set eyes on, yet he's got Hugh Grant's phone number.  The
    artist exclusively known as Badly Drawn Boy might as well have stitched ""E-N-I-G-M-A"" onto that ethnic
    knitcap he wears around all security blanket-like.  So how do we approach <i>Have You Fed the Fish?</i>  On
    his terms?  Nope.  I've been through this thing an impossible number of times, and the only way to take it
    is on ours.</p><p>
    
    Gough doesn't make it easy on us, though.  A goofy, self-deprecating skit opens the proceedings, followed by
    a nondescript, throwaway instrumental called ""Coming in to Land"".  And then we're hit with the ridiculous
    title track, which walks what is fastly becoming Badly Drawn Boy's very own fenceline between execrable REO
    Speedwagon pomp-pop and touching, emotive songwriting.  It doesn't look pretty so far.</p><p>
    
    But then comes ""Born Again"", an endearing (and rare) rocker where Gough manages to pull off sincerity without
    pandering, and the moment at which he hits his stride.  Here, his self-consciousness slips away, allowing us
    to relate to the song without envisioning him as the song's narrator.  Which is nice because Gough's more
    personal offerings (and I use the word ""personal"" loosely here) aren't the most original ever committed to
    DAT-- they're nice little saccharine ballads which could be love songs <i>from</i> anybody <i>to</i> anybody.
    When Damon brings himself too far into the picture, as often happens on this record, all it reveals is that
    he's just not that interesting a character.  So it's moments like this, when he lets go of his ego and just
    plays the damn thing, that work best.</p><p>
    
    ""40 Days"" is more of the same stuff he kicked out on <i>The Hour of Bewilderbeat</i>, and about on par with
    that album's better material.  It's a jaunty narrative, the kind of song you might sing along to in the
    morning to help shake a hangover.  And despite that the retro-glossy ""All Possibilities"" attempts a nods to
    Love Unlimited and comes out ""Love Boat"", his enthusiasm is charming-- the guy clearly loves what he's
    doing, and the joy he communicates in the song is infectious.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the frustrations remain. ""I Was Wrong"" is a delicate Elliott Smith type thing with a genuine
    Nick Drake fragility, but it disappears before it has a chance to break your heart.  Instead, Gough insists
    on a failed attempt at cleverness by merging clumsily into a smoothed-over Fleetwood Mac substitute called
    ""You Were Right"".  It apparently wasn't enough for him that this track even had to appear on the record--
    it had to take one of the album's better offerings down with it.  Fortunately, it's not a total loss, as he
    drops some pretty entertaining lyrics (which I won't spoil here), and a whistle solo (can't beat a whistle
    solo), but the momentum's out the window.</p><p>
    
    And that's just the thing with Badly Drawn Boy-- he doesn't care about momentum, or continuity, or a lot of
    other things that <i>you</i> might quite reasonably care about when you sit down to listen to his records.
    He's going to give you devastating insight <i>and</i> wacky novelty, and by god, he's going to give them
    to you in the <i>same song</i> if he damn well pleases.  Which would be fine and everything-- lots of folks,
    not least of which is Elvis Costello, have made their names on doing just this-- if he could only pull it
    off.  But he can't, and there's fatal proof of this in a song like ""How?"", which dares to spotlight <i>the
    whole problem</i> with the lyric, ""How can I give you the answers you need/ When all I possess is a melody?""
    How, indeed?</p><p>
    
    So it's up to you, my friend, to opt out or to love unconditionally.  Will you accept Badly Drawn Boy on
    his terms, no matter how inscrutable?  Will you indulge his penchant for sweetback 70s funk long enough to
    embrace the lovely ""The Further I Slide""?  Will you endure the music hall diversions of ""Tickets to What
    You Need"" to arrive at the impassioned coda of ""Bedside Story""?   Will the frustrating interludes,
    ill-conceived genre experiments and half-finished ideas keep you from finding the life-affirming power
    that lies in the chewy nougat center of Badly Drawn Boy's music?  I'm not sure he's worth it, personally,
    considering the ease with which we could toss on a record from one of his many on-sleeve influences and
    witness perfection.  But luckily, there's always the 'skip' button.</p></div>"|527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/527-have-you-fed-the-fish/|6.6|Jesse Fahnestock

First,
    you've got your hip, stylish establishments, the kind college kids hang at every night from Thursday to
    Saturday to get wasted and possibly to score with some stranger they'll never see again.  And then there's
    the other kind, the local dive off the interstate or secluded on a neighborhood sidestreet, where the
    bartender knows most of the faces and the troubles those faces have known.</p><p>
    
    If his music is any indication, Mike Johnson spends most of his time in the latter kind of establishment,
    drowning his sorrows nightly in a foamy stein and conveniently forgetting that the guy handing him drinks
    isn't a licensed therapist.  The place he haunts isn't exactly Cheers, either-- you're unlikely to hear a
    lot of clever one-liners and it's probably not quite so immaculately kept up.  Yet, unlike most of the
    denizens of this consoling tavern, Johnson happens to spend most of the rest of his time with an instrument
    in his hand, hanging out with guys like Phil Ek and Mark Lanegan.</p><p>
    
    He's actually been tolling around the Pacific Northwest for about a decade and a half now, starting out in
    the little-known Snakepit before playing bass in Dinosaur Jr throughout most of the 90s.  Aptly, he's also
    been one of the principle forces behind Mark Lanegan's post-Screaming Trees work, which is just about the
    closest thing I can think of to his own solo work.  Johnson's forlorn baritone also occasionally conjures
    up a more restrained Mark Eitzel, or even Nick Cave at his most subdued.</p><p>
    
    Johnson's fourth solo album, and first since 1998's <i>I Feel Alright</i>, picks right up where he last left
    us.  That is, in an emotional ditch, crushed by the weight of relationships that didn't last and light that's
    struggling to poke through thick clouds of dread and disgust.  Sure, anyone at all familiar with his stuff
    isn't going to expect the feelgood hit of the summer, but here the morose delivery sometimes gets a little
    overbearing, as it's hard to find a break anywhere.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, the persistence of the man's mopes is largely offset by the quality of the material.  Johnson
    has an odd approach to songwriting, setting a mood first, and then extracting a narrative from it.  Ek's
    production is friendly and inviting, framing each of Johnson's songs so that they reveal themselves slowly,
    growing with each listen.  The hook for opener ""Arise"" ingratiates itself so subtly that you'll hardly even
    notice it's happened until you find yourself humming it at work a few days later.</p><p>
    
    By and large, Johnson couches his themes in a backdrop of rock-stained country and folk, though it's never
    firmly in either territory.  He breaks out of dirge mode here and there, most notably on ""Come Back Again"",
    which, while not exactly jaunty itself, manages to charge things up nicely with some startlingly anthemic
    guitar work and an unusually animated vocal performance.  The whole thing ends with what could be a pompous
    disaster, featuring Johnson dryly reading a passage from the Purgatory section of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>,
    but the music that rises behind him and eventually overwhelms him is so spirited and unpretentious that it
    actually elevates the mood, capping things on a markedly positive note.</p><p>
    
    Though not his best, <i>What Would You Do</i> is another solid effort from Johnson, who by now has developed
    a fairly impressive little canon of downtrodden songs and a fairly distinct gothic country musical calling
    card for himself.  A pretty good companion, really, for emotional distress during those times when a friendly
    bartender's nowhere to be found.  It's better for your liver, anyway.</p></div>"|4278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4278-what-would-you-do/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    polarizing music in the West: free improvisation.  I don't want to launch a
    considered historical treatise on the subject, but I will say that, despite
    its scary rep for some, there's as much a variance in sound, texture, even
    impact-- I've experienced more than one performance wherein my reaction was
    almost completely different than my mate's-- as you'd find in any other kind
    of music.  The problem isn't that there's not enough sound to keep my ears
    busy; it's that my ears are generally accustomed to a much more rigid flow of
    events.  Groups like the Unstable Ensemble leave few breadcrumbs or signposts
    for me, so if I am to consider this music a ""journey"", it's inevitably going to
    be closer to metaphysical than linear.  And, as any member of the real world
    will tell you, metaphysical music-journeys aren't often on the daily agenda.</p><p>
    
    None of that is to say I haven't gotten lost on a few and lived to tell about
    it.  When I was younger, I figured people listened to this stuff because 1)
    they were crusty academics and/or music snobs; 2) they were super-geniuses who
    I should fear; or 3) they were strange homeless bohemians.  Having seen many
    lights since then, I've realized that free improvisation isn't terribly different
    than other music I listen to, except that I sometimes have to guide myself (rather
    than let the verse/chorus/verse do it for me).</p><p>
    
    Unstable Ensemble, an electro-acoustic quintet featuring members from all
    over the Midwest and East Coast, formed in 1999 and is only too eager to
    lead me into mysterious regions.  Two saxes (baritone and soprano), guitar,
    percussion and no-input mixing board (a probable nod to Japan's bustling
    ""onkyo"" scene featuring Toshimaru Nakamura and Otomo Yoshihide, where this
    kind of freedom is undergoing a slight renaissance) ebb, flow, rattle and
    hum their ways through extended expositions on apparently poetic themes (""In
    the Fullness of Time"", ""To Speak, To Listen"", et al).  The group's sound is
    sparse considering the amount of sounds available at their disposal; to
    their credit, very few toes are stepped on here, as the players clearly
    possess big ears.  Often, if two or three instruments are sounding at once,
    another will drop out, or play a supportive role; effectively, this lends
    no small amount of shape to music that would be formless by definition.</p><p>
    
    ""Beneath the Rafters"" begins with Jason Bivens' scraped guitar, sounding
    like rusted metal, but soon enough turns to agitated clawing and swooping.
    His opening becomes an overture, incorporating jazz-informed lines and
    eventually stating a minimal melody, at which point the saxes and percussion
    join the fray.  Marty Belcher's soprano takes the high, ethereal road while
    Joe Donnelly's baritone opts for more punchy terrain.  This kind of
    everyone-in-their-place, spatial interplay is typical for the music on
    <i>The Liturgy of Ghosts</i>, and may be good news for anyone expecting
    hardcore skronk.</p><p>
    
    This record is strictly abstract (probably closest to European free
    improvisers like Hans Bennink, or even the Art Ensemble of Chicago without
    the overt humor), which places them firmly outside the trumpeted, oddly
    populist downtown NYC improv clique, but is always engaging.  I'm tempted to
    say the album would be a good starting place for newcomers to free jazz
    because of its relatively restrained mood, but I don't want to imply that
    this is a gentle breeze.  It's an interesting record, and one by a group
    who should be on the radar for anyone interested in these kinds of journeys.</p></div>"|8363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8363-the-liturgy-of-ghosts/|8.0|Dominique Leone

If you've been reading our site for long enough, you should be behaviorally conditioned to recoil in
    fear from the word, crawl under your computer desk, and assume the grade-school tornado warning position.
    Nothing brings out the Pitchfork Ginsu like some earnest musical diary-reading, especially if it's from
    loyal sponsor Vagrant.  One thing I'll grant the Vagrant crowd, though, is good sportsmanship; cheers, mates.</p><p>
    
    One problem-- and I only feel comfortable telling you this after many months of loyal service-- but yeah, I
    like some emo.  The problem lies in the definition, I guess, since ""emo"" has a Supreme Court pornography
    kind of definition; one knows it when one sees it.  Emo to me is not so much the three-chord pop riffing
    of the Get Up Kids or the overpassionate nobody-loves-me preciousness of new-schoolers like Dashboard
    Confessional, but instead the mid-90s Midwestern scene of bands with a recipe of rhythmic complexity,
    hardcore/post-punk sensibility co-existing uneasily with anthemic tunefulness, and a tendency to moan about
    the womenfolk.  Hey, the wintry climate of Middle America produces a lot of sensitive dorks, your humble
    narrator included.</p><p>
    
    It's these emo-for-lack-of-a-better-term bands (Braid, the Promise Ring's first album, Joan of Arc, and even
    Rainer Maria) that I fess up to occasionally dusting off for a Saturday afternoon, and pleasingly, they seem
    to be maintaining some semblance of influence beyond the dumbed-down nu-emo.  First there was Pretty Girls
    Make Graves with their Braid + A Girl! formula, and now comes Canada's Hot Hot Heat, whose sound, lyrics,
    and album title set off my emo alarm, but in a manner gleefully free of embarrassment.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the emo label is only one of many arbitrary genre ornaments to hang on Hot Hot Heat; one could
    equally focus in on their new-wave Attractions fetish for Hammond organ or their post-punk urgency and
    off-kilter progressions.  But if the Canuck quartet resembles anyone, it's Dismemberment Plan circa
    <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>: insistent, poppy music superbly summarizing most of the melodic states punk rock
    has evolved through since its invention.</p><p>
    
    So even if <i>Make Up the Breakdown</i> contains a lyric like ""bandages on my legs and my arms from you,""
    there's no navel-gazing to be found, unless you can stay focused on your belly button while spastically
    thrashing about the room.  <i>Breakdown</i> launches with a trio of energetic flashes: ""Naked in the City
    Again"" setting the nervous tone with a cymbal groove and jagged guitar; ""No, Not Now"" traipsing through a
    series of irresistibly catchy segments; ""Get In or Get Out"" exploding at one point into an organ freakout
    during which you can almost hear the keys flying off.</p><p>
    
    By now you'll have surely noticed singer Steve Bays' voice, and therein lies the swing point of your Hot
    Hot Heat enjoyment.  Rarely pausing for more than a breath, Bays flips violently around the range, speeding
    up and slowing down to match the stop/starts and time signature fuckery of his bandmates.  It's the kind of
    performance that can either obscure your enjoyment of the entire album (as it did for my esteemed colleague
    Eric Carr in his review of the band's <i>Knock Knock Knock</i> EP), or enliven the experience as a seeming
    nod to crazed post-punk vocalists like David Byrne and Wire's Colin Newman.  For me, it's the latter-- the
    voice initially seemed a major flaw atop these otherwise incredibly solid rockers, but by the fourth track
    I'd dropped my defenses, and now find it gives these tracks the character and caffeinated energy they
    deserve.</p><p>
    
    No matter your feelings on the mic work, though, you can't help but notice the musical talent at play here,
    be it in the unusual song structures or the unobtrusive, color-adding use of the organ behind Dante DeCaro's
    unpredictable chords.  ""Oh, Goddamnit"" borrows more than messy hair from <i>Is This It?</i> with its tik-tak
    drumming and poppy bass, but Bays' enthusiasm on the hook is an improvement on the Strokes' studied ennui.
    ""This Town"" deftly refuses to allow for standard toe-tapping while remaining singalongable, and ""Talk to Me,
    Dance with Me"" features an urgent Latin shuffle that amazingly (given that we're dealing with a
    <em>north</em>-of-the-border band here) skirts awkwardness.</p><p>
<i>Make Up the Breakdown</i> still has its weaker moments-- the overlong ""In Cairo"" or the awkward Long
    Beach reggae bridge of ""Bandages"" in particular-- indicating that Hot Hot Heat's peak might be in the
    gotta-wear-shades future rather than the present.  Still, there's no reason <i>Breakdown</i> couldn't put
    Hot Hot Heat on the national stage-- the band's accessible enough on top of their inventiveness to be a
    feminine facial structure or two away from superstardom.  In the meantime, revel in the rare emo-inflected
    album that won't earn admonishment from us Pitchforkers.</p></div>"|3927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3927-make-up-the-breakdown/|8.7|Rob Mitchum

I got <i>stoned</i> for this review. Blizzard-stoned. Pilgrim-stoned. Perestroika-stoned. What, man? What'd you say? Laser who? Mom, I know you, man! I will murder you for an omelet! Hey, zoo-keeper. Say it, it sounds so alien, man. Zoo-kee-per. Zoo-bie. Run from the Zangler! A fifty-foot Nancy Reagan brain beams out for me to Just Say No. I got grandkids. Hey, sleepyhead, answer me this: how can we sleep while our beds are burning, huh? How?</p>
<p>Ahem. The most entertaining chapter, by far, in Michael Azerrad's mammoth <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>, is the chapter on the Butthole Surfers. Their exponentially high jinks way outshine the runner-up bits about Ian McKaye being afraid of beer because of his tippy pappy or the chronicle of Lou Barlow's impulsive mid-show revolts against J. ""The Masticator"" Mascis. The Butthole chapter documents how they wiped their testicle-sweat on a suitcase that Jimmy Carter came to pick up for his stranded daughter, and how the Surfers moved to Athens just to stalk/pester R.E.M. And everyone knows that Gibby Haynes called his major label tour opener the Stoned Pimple Toilets just as the second or third wave of fake grunge was cresting. Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins told me at a concert a couple weeks ago that right up there among his influences with Brian Eno, Black Sabbath, Johnny Cash, and the Residents lurk the Buttholes and their ""total drug songs"".</p>
<p>Though <i>Independent Worm Saloon</i> served up some viable trash-rawk while cashing in on the sound of the Flannery O'Connor-inspired Ministry team-up ""Jesus Built My Hotrod"", the Buttholes' output has been snoozy of late, with drumloops, tame material, predictable song structures, and perfunctory freak-outs that feel half-freaked. <i>Humpty Dumpty LSD</i>, though, is a gathering of home recordings, four-trackings, practice-space jams, comp tracks, and outtakes from 1982-1994. Meaning: it's a hell of a good time, taking us listeners all the way back to when we used to repeat <i>Hairway to Steven</i> on our headphones while the adults in proximity worshipped God or beat each other with telephone books. This is the trippier-than-a-napalm-Slip-N-Slide band, powerful enough to convince haters than the Buttholes' career isn't an extended prank but a piece of redneck performance art.</p>
<p>The tracks are predominantly instrumental, and some of them, such as the apocalyptic lurcher ""Eindhoven Chicken Masque"" or the panoramic synth-plus-feedback picnic of ""Space"" parts I and II are excellent. In fact, much of this raucous release makes one wish that post-rock would unbutton its stiff shirt already. The Buttholes' grinding pedal-messes and tribally intoxicating drums sound like dumb fun, but they display a visceral intelligence, far from the vibe of certain Grubbs/O'Rourke theses-readings.</p>
<p>Gibby (going by Gibson Haynes on this outing, in the fanciest formality upgrade since Red Heat's Larry Fishburne metamorphosed into Laurence Fishburne III) is a profane Robert Pollard, and you get all his great bad sides here: the voice so distorted it's monstrous, the panic-attacked insect voice, the buzzsaw, and his natural Buddy-Holly-meets-Yosemite-Sam nasal/guttural yowlp. The album forms a kind of Texas-nut triumvirate since Roky Erickson's ""Earthquake"" gets covered and Daniel Johnston performs vocal assistance on the eight-minute hellstomp ""All Day"". And for every nugget of nonsense (""Night of the Day"" is just pretty chords getting pitch-shifted and whammy-barred mixed with some distance screams, snores and wet farts), gurgly anti-symphonies such as ""Hetero Skeleton"" spaz all over the place. Plus, you get treats like the hilarious intro to early punker ""I Hate My Job"".</p>
<p>Whether the band is in flailing or militaristic mode, this is the soundtrack to those nights you don't deserve to have survived, when only your Converse All-Stars saved you from that electric fence, or when you wake up with the taste of rust in your mouth, blood in your Cheerios, an oboe-sized bruise, and a tattoo that says ""I Am a Thundering Herd"".</p></div>"|1044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1044-humpty-dumpty-lsd/|7.0|William Bowers

    and gangs. But rather than buckle under the pressure and become another statistic running through ballistics,
    'Face managed to cipher that pain and struggle into his rhymes.  His booming baritone sounded alternately
    boastful and besieged, paranoid and supremely confident.  His straight-forward recitation of the roughneck
    life was gangsta before we even knew what gangsta was.  In his own words, he has ""turned a dream into reality
    with a fuck-you mentality.""  And, in addition to his artistic and commercial accomplishments, Scarface has
    also reigns as president of Def Jam South, one of the best-known hip-hop labels, producing the always-amusing
    Ludacris.</p><p>
    But even as the platinum records pile up, strife is never far off. Geffen almost refused to release the
    Geto Boys' debut; 'Face suffered from multiple and prolonged bouts with depression; and the FBI and DEA
    reportedly keep tabs on him.  Although these events may be unfortunate on a personal level, the struggle
    keeps 'Face hungry, and, as he recently told BET, ""spoke through my pen to ease my pain.""</p><p>
    The best songs on <i>The Fix</i> resonate with that classic 'Face blend of swagger and sadness. ""Safe"", which
    kicks off the album, is a bluesy and brutal ride through the man's hood. Children grow up disillusioned and
    poor; snitches slip, flip, and die; and the hustle goes on and on.  Scarface walks through this carnage with
    his trademark nihilistic bluster and drug-game savvy.  Sure, we've heard the tale of urban decimation and
    dime-bag capitalism a million times before, but 'Face was among the first to set this shit off and he
    navigates through the clichés of hopelessness better than most.</p><p>
    For ""Guess Who's Back"", Jay-Z and fellow Roc-a-Fella cohort Beanie Sigel drop by to pay their respects to
    the real originator. Producer Kayne West, who has now officially arrived, provides a blazing track that
    wouldn't have sounded out of place on <i>The Blueprint</i>. Although Jigga and Beanie both drop serviceable
    verses, the crown for best guest appearance on goes to Nas for his verse on ""In Between Us"".  Despite a
    generic beat, Nas lashes out with a newfound hunger that's kept him in contention for the title of King of
    NY.</p><p>
    Still, even with a string of near-classic guest spots and some smokin' verses, <i>The Fix</i> has too many
    holes to recommend. The record features no less than nine different producers that were seemingly given the
    directive to come up with the most forgettable and formulaic beats possible. And the tracks featuring R&amp;B;
    vocalists are the album's weakest, by a long shot. To quote Wu Guru RZA, ""R&amp;B; equals rap and bullshit"".
    And, lastly, a large reason this album ultimately fails is because Scarface has been so successful in the
    past.  After inspiring a hip-hop movement (the Dirty South), 'Face's tales of ghetto horror and valor now
    come off redundant.  He may play it better than most, but it's still that same old song.</p></div>"|7015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7015-the-fix/|6.3|Sam Chennault

    delivering the kind of smooth, sophisticated orchestra-pop that could only
    come from Chicago while managing to avoid the notoriety of hometown peers
    like The Sea &amp; Cake. <i>Happyness</i> is their fifth album, and either I'm
    going old and developing a taste for vanilla, or the Aluminum Group continues
    to improve. Everything here is just so <em>precise and fitted together so
    perfectly, not unlike the Ray Eames furniture line the band take their name
    from. Plenty of sweat went into the creation of <i>Happyness</i>, I'm sure,
    but none happened in real time. The music, melodies and arrangements have the
    kind effortless sheen that comes only from focused studio tinkering, and the
    result is a relaxing invitation to take in all the detail.</em></p><p>
    
    One thing that makes the Aluminum Group interesting is they act like rock
    never happened. For John and Frank Navin, music jumped from the Bacharach/David/Warwick
    holy troika directly to the most melodic, new-romantic end of 80s synth-pop,
    and then took a short detour into mid-90s German electronics before dropping
    into the timeless realm where their records happen. They'd sooner retire to
    the Unabomber's cabin than bring a distortion pedal into the studio, and
    forget gravel-voiced angst. The Navins gargle and floss before every trip to
    the microphone, so don't bother with <i>Happyness</i> unless you're ready to
    meet the music on its own clearly defined terms.</p><p>
    
    Befitting their perfectionist streak, this is a short and compact album,
    their third 10-song collection in a row, and it hovers just below the
    40-minute mark. This is allegedly the first album in a trilogy, but the
    thematic direction is difficult to detect. The lyrics are still rife with
    literary allusions, arch turns of phrase, and tales of love and betrayal,
    but nothing unusual knits them together as far as I can hear. I can say that
    you'll enjoy the songs a lot more if you find lines like, ""It's springtime in
    Jellystone park,"" funny (like I do).</p><p>
    
    Musically, <i>Happyness</i> is sparer than the recent work. If <i>Pelo</i> was an
    electronic excursion and <i>Pedals</i> found Aluminum Group indulging in acoustic
    chamber pop with Jim O'Rourke at the controls, <i>Happyness</i> incorporates hints
    of both approaches but tones the backing down. ""Kisses"" illustrates nicely the
    integrated approach, as a ringing synth patch forms the basis of the tune, but
    accents and rhythmic thrust are provided by a cool-as-a-snowcone muted trumpet.
    Despite impressive electronic accents, the arrangement seems designed for the kind
    of mid-60s crowd that agreed with Frank Sinatra about Elvis Presley.</p><p>
    
    Whatever you think about the Aluminum Group's mad reverence for the AM radio
    pop of '65-'74, there's no denying the strength of these melodies, and this
    is why we have to take these guys seriously. These are damn good songs. Like
    Lord Bacharach, the Navins know how to string together a verse, bridge and
    chorus, each with ample melody to power its own tune (""Pop"" here is particularly
    impressive in this respect.) Hear most of these songs a few times and you'll
    feel like you've known them all your life. And if you find yourself in the mood
    for some smart pop music that hits all the right notes, you could do a lot worse.</p></div>"|141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/141-happyness/|8.0|Mark Richardson

    Word from on high has it that the Big Man discourages lusty anecdotes suffused with bodily functions these
    days.  But Pitchfork old-schooler James P. Wisdom may have nailed the atmosphere just right when rating
    Morcheeba's first album, <i>Who Can You Trust?</i>.  It's hard to have sympathy for a second-gen trip-hop
    band whose name is a not-so-thinly veiled pot reference, not to mention song titles like ""Trigger Hippie"".
    Still, Skye Edwards' voice cooed so smoothly that it felt more like soul than angst, and the simple
    arrangements and subtle detail chilled many heads.</p><p>
    Of course, the London trio soon caught the whiff of cashflow and shifted rapidly from lounge chic to generic,
    radio-friendly pop in a downward spiral shared by most of their contemporaries (Hooverphonic, anyone?).  The
    Sire execs saw to it that all elements of darkness, ethereality and-- gasp in shock here-- black soul were
    quickly and efficiently excised from the mix, to be replaced by the most predictable, glossy surface settings
    this side of IKEA.  Now whitewashed, Edwards and brothers Paul and Russ Godfrey have dropped their fourth and
    most atrocious album yet, <i>Charango</i>.  The name comes from a South American lute usually made from the
    shell of an armadillo.  A fitting title for dead meat.</p><p>
<i>Charango</i> begins with a hint of the band's former sensuality on ""Slowdown"", which features reverbed
    guitar and Edwards' breathy voice begging you to ""slow down"" after a long day.  Unfortunately, her lyrical
    banality has progressed far beyond excruciating rhymes, to the point where every chorus reads like a
    self-help manual.  ""Otherwise"" features canned string frills that accompany Edwards' advice: ""It ain't gonna
    hurt now, if you open up your eyes/ You're making it worse now, every time you criticize.""  Next up is
    ""Aqualung"", which, unfortunately, is not a cover of the Jethro Tull song-- the spectacle of Skye eyeing
    little girls with bad intent might have added some punch to the cod-Western riffs copped from earlier albums.
    You may get a kick from the lyrics, though: ""Square up to fight, like dynamite!""  Somewhere, Bis beam with
    pride.</p><p>
    The guest stars aren't lacking in commandments, either.  On the title track, Outsidaz rapper Pacewon finally
    makes the pun in the band's name overt for the chronically sheltered: ""Y'all need to roll your blunts with
    Morcheeba!""  Another guest spot features Lambchop's Kurt Wagner doing his best Mark Eitzel impression.  But
    the abominable low comes with ""Women Lose Weight"", which features the venerable Slick Rick.  Yes, the man
    who brought you the classic ""La Di Da Di"" returns for a sketch in which he decides he's got to kill his wife
    as a result of her putting on weight over the years.  In the cheery chorus he sneers, ""Send that ass right to
    the morgue.""  It might be amusing to the socially callous if the entire affair wasn't so irredeemably wack that
    even a white guy like me just shakes his head in embarrassment.  It doesn't help that Rick's flow and the
    rhythm parody the Gorillaz's ""Clint Eastwood""; ripping off Del isn't the way to bring this bilge back to
    earth.</p><p>
    Morcheeba don't need outsiders to sound contrived, though, evidenced in the pseudo-Tropicalia of ""Sao Paulo"".
    Tame percussion and turntable scratches paint the perfect picture of a self-absorbed traveler boozing it up
    in the exotic South, and Skye signs it with the line, ""My life is just one big cliché.""  Yes, imitative
    fallacies usually suck, and no, Latin Americans don't need any more cheap caricatures; they're sick enough
    that ""passionate"" and ""fiery"" seem to be the only adjectives ever applied to them.  On Morcheeba's website,
    the band talks about their interest in Brazilian Tropicalia's cannibalistic tendencies, the urge to consume
    different musical styles and synthesize them all.  Likewise, <i>Charango</i> reeks of Warner Brothers'
    attempt to find a viable audience for this waning band, and the seemingly anti-consumerist ""Way Beyond""
    rings hollow next to the rest of these marketing imperatives masquerading as songs.  If only it were somehow
    more enjoyable to watch it all devour itself...</p></div>"|5425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5425-charango/|3.6|Christopher Dare

    over their hearts, and where sometimes, the good book even stops a bullet.  <i>The Man Comes Around</i> is
    poised as the next chapter in Cash's darkling fairy tale, the fourth in an ongoing series of mostly-covers
    albums on which he gives material by some of today's most talented (or alternately, best-selling) artists
    his own aged slant.</p><p>
    
    Now, time was, Johnny Cash covering a song like Soundgarden's ""Rusty Cage"" was a clever novelty made
    impressive by his ability to infuse these modern-day rockers with overwhelming emotion.  Cash's renditions
    of songs like Nick Cave's ""The Mercy Seat"" and Leonard Cohen's ""Bird on a Wire"" weren't so surprising, but
    far more powerful, as the spirit of those songs was so close to his own.  The simple truth, of course, is
    that Cash's talent is such that he can elevate nearly any song to which he turns his ear.  But on this, his
    fourth go-round on the same theme, it hardly seems necessary anymore; the songs of this record are taken
    from the most disparate ends of the musical spectrum, to no apparent end but show that he can do it.</p><p>
    
    The first tragic subject of this case study is, almost predictably, Trent Reznor.  (We knew it was just a
    matter of time, didn't we?  I give it one more album before he gets around to Tool's ""Schism."")  The
    curriculum: ""Hurt"".  Now, I'm not a big advocator of the NIN sound, but I'll give ""Hurt"" that it's got a
    fine melody, and its arrangement here is fantastic.  Cash treats the song with such sincerity and honesty
    that it takes on a power that it never held in Reznor's hands, infusing it with genuine heart to accompany
    the bitterness.  But that's just it-- could Cash really fail to bring something to this desolate ballad?
    It's like taking target practice at the Empire State Building.  There's no challenge here-- it's just driving
    home a point. (And incidentally, those of you anticipating the line, ""I wear this crown of shit,"" will be
    sorely disappointed.)</p><p>
    
    Still, from the slithering blues groove of ""Personal Jesus"" to a surprisingly subtle duet with Fiona Apple
    on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", Cash never falters.  Gorgeous, minimal arrangements highlight his emotive
    baritone and distill each track to its finest essentials.  However, when an album consists of twelve covers
    and only three originals, something more than pretty arrangements is necessary, and it's called cohesion.
    Cash's renditions are often breathtaking in their simplicity, but rarely do they justify their presence
    among a dozen other similarly afflicted songs.</p><p>
    
    A few exceptions are able to rise above, of course.  ""Hung My Head"" is, and always has been, more Johnny Cash's
    than Sting's, and there's no disputing it now.  And Cash and his understudy Nick Cave do justice to fellow
    Country hall-of-famer Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"".  In these tracks, Cash finds something
    more than excellent composition and heartfelt regret-- he taps into the essence of each song and truly makes
    it his own.  If he could have done this more often, and with a better selection of songs, the bulk of this
    record wouldn't be overshadowed by the cataclysmic magnitude of its original title track.</p><p>
    
    And the weaknesses of the covers wouldn't be half as apparent if they weren't thrown into such stark contrast
    with an original that could stand proudly alongside ""Folsom Prison Blues"" or ""I Walk the Line"".  The Cash-penned
    ""The Man Comes Around"" is an epic tale of apocalypse, interpreting Revelations with uplifting exuberance.
    Restraint, resignation, and a hope of peace pervade the prophetic imagery.  Truly, the subdued fury and
    beauty of this track reduces everything that follows.  The immediate question posed is: if this man can still
    write and perform works of this caliber, why is he resorting to the words and music of others?  Ideally, the
    covers should speak this answer for themselves.  Unfortunately, Cash fails to give them voice to do so, and
    as such, they remain unfortunately silent.</p></div>"|1331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1331-american-iv-the-man-comes-around/|6.9|Eric Carr

Nevertheless, it's easy to see strong similarities between these two, particularly in vocal delivery,     though Mark largely eschews Case's smoky, dusky drama, opting instead for a worn-in, down-home sound that     can be very ingratiating.  She warmly invites you into her home, though she readily admits to being a     Terrible Hostess for an intimate evening with a few close friends.  It gets a little rowdy here and there     as the tempo picks up, everyone has few laughs, there's some quiet reflection, and in the end, a good time     is had by all.</p><p>Now, as I've said, occasionally the dinner party atmosphere comes close to becoming a full-fledged hoedown,     as on tracks like ""Fuzzy Slippers"", or the worst offender, ""After Bar Party"", and I'd be lying if I pretended     that it didn't impair my enjoyment of this album.  That said, though, there's evident quality lurking within     even these tracks.  After all, just because they taste like grits to me (and I hate grits) doesn't mean they     aren't delicious to those that have a taste for them.  The musicianship is extremely tight on these fast-paced     numbers, and they're effortlessly infused with Mark's charmingly wry sense of humor, which goes a long way     to pulling them off.</p><p>Still, I'm happy to say that the largest part of this album is spent on slower, more seemingly personal     numbers; unhurried sweet-and-sour gems like ""Gopherville"" or ""Port Moody"" really allow Mark's innate charm     to shine through.  Her unforced (but still powerful) voice gives these tracks a very meaningful air; like     fond recollection of past happiness, they're at once thankful for the memories, but regret that those times     won't come around again.  If that sounds depressing, don't fret-- the bottom line of the multi-layered     emotion within these songs is always an undeniable optimism.  And it's Mark's voice alone that conveys such     complexity; the arrangements are well-played, but sparse-- there's typically just enough music to serve as     a suitable backdrop.</p>
<p>So I suppose Mark's party really is pretty entertaining.  If you don't mind your alt-country heavy on the     country, there ought to be plenty to keep you there well into the wee hours.  If you're a rock 'n' roller     kinda kid like me, though, that's probably not going to be the case.  But regardless, I'd recommend dropping     by anyway-- just be fashionably late and plan on leaving early.</p>

    aged beautifully.  Their 1980 masterstroke <i>Underwater Moonlight</i> now seems colossal; its excellently
    crafted power-pop packed the wallop of a hundred-ton rig hitting a concrete wall at top speed, even with
    frontman Robyn Hitchcock's inventive, surrealist lyrics softening the crunch.  That album, however, was
    recorded 22 years ago, and since then everything has changed.  Hitchcock has achieved a much higher degree
    of public awareness with his solo career than the Soft Boys ever saw, and the other members of the quartet
    have pursued their own paths through two decades of changing music, often playing on each other's records
    and even occasionally writing together.  So, in light of this, it hardly seems surprising that the band
    reformed last year to tour in support of Matador's expanded reissue of <i>Underwater Moonlight</i>, or that
    they entered a studio shortly afterward to record another full-length.</p><p>
    
    Surprise or not, to be skeptical about a project like this is only natural-- ""reunion"" albums routinely fall
    flat, and pretty much invariably pale in comparison to the band's past work.  But while that second part rings
    true here, I'm thrilled to report that the first part doesn't.  <i>Nextdoorland</i> finds the band's old
    chemistry in full effect, and Hitchcock's songwriting seems re-energized by the presence of his old mates.
    They waste no time proving it, either-- drummer Morris Windsor and bassist Matthew Seligman immediately lock
    together on the opener, ""I Love Lucy"", a mostly instrumental song that succeeds by the loopy guitar interplay
    of Hitchcock and Kimberley Rew.</p><p>
    
    Hitchcock begins the weirdly low-key ""Pulse of My Heart"" by claiming, ""You can set your watch by me/ I'm a
    regular guy""-- and then goes out of his way to suggest otherwise over the course of the rest of the album.
    This is perhaps best evidenced on ""My Mind Is Connected"" when he sings, ""My mind is connected to your dreams/
    Bzzup uhzzup uzzup uzzuh bzzup uh-huh/ Your dreams are connected to the underside/ Where the skull of Africa
    meets the horn of Florida/ And petals ring in orbit, merry day/ Give me a pod of rock 'n' roll.""  Elsewhere,
    he gets surprisingly explicit on ""Japanese Captain"", intoning in a paradoxically chipper sneer for the lines,
    ""Touch me, baby/ Rinse me, please/ Fuck me, darling/ Under the table is good, but under your fingers is better/
    You know I'm in love.""  (Something tells me he didn't get the date.)  And amidst all this, the band plays as
    a tight, focused unit, congealing into thick rhythm on ""Protected Love"" and entering extended freakouts along
    the way, as with the vaguely Middle Eastern coda to ""Mr. Kennedy"" and the raging tangents of the six-minute
    powerhouse ""Strings"".</p><p>
    
    The harmonies that shimmered so brightly on <i>Underwater Moonlight</i> are employed sparingly on <i>Nextdoorland</i>,
    spotlighting Hitchcock's Syd Barrett-influenced croon, which seems to suit this material best.  Unfortunately,
    the absence of those harmonies also contributes to an overall lack of density, and this eventually proves the
    record's greatest weakness.  But that doesn't strike me as a fault of the band's as much as producer Pat
    Collier's.  Though responsible for producing <i>Underwater Moonlight</i>, he seem satisfied with a hollowed
    sound here, which weakens the punch of the group's older material-- and frankly, that punch was pretty essential
    to the whole hitting-a-concrete-wall-at-top-speed bit.  The strength and conviction of the material is wonderful
    regardless, but I find it difficult not to wonder what might have been had they brought in New Pornographers
    producer David Carswell.</p><p>
    
    In the end, of course, what might have been is beside the point.  What we have here is an inspired comeback
    from a band who are finally getting their due, two decades after the fact.  That nothing on <i>Nextdoorland</i>
    hits quite as hard as ""I Wanna Destroy You"" or ""Pigworker"" isn't an indictment, nor a shock.  But that most
    of the record manages to come so close after a 22-year hiatus is a serious achievement-- it deserves only
    commendation.  Here's hoping the Boys don't quit again on us too soon, as this new evidence proves they've
    hardly run their course.</p></div>"|7312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7312-nextdoorland/|7.5|Joe Tangari

Like Cher.  Cher sings on this album.  And Madonna.  And Sting.  In fact, everyone who only     has one name, they all sing on this album.</p>
<p>If you didn't fall for that, good for you.  The recently assembled Nels Cline Singers are guitarist Nels     Cline's current touring outfit featuring Devin Hoff on contrabass and Scott Amendola on drums/electronics.     And <i>Instrumentals</i>, though issuing forth from the titanic loins of these so-called Singers, is as     unsullied by human voice as the rest of guitarist Cline's non-rock work.  While Nels spends his days axing     for the Geraldine Fibbers, noodling with Thurston Moore, shopping for shoes with Mike Watt, etc., all he's     ever really wanted to do was go home and toss back a can of that cold, frothy jazz.  Of course, given his     background, Cline's never been afraid of inflecting the idiom with ideas borrowed from the more remote     quarters of the rock world (exotic pedals, dictatorial spaz-mandates, etc).  That he does so without ever     approaching ""fusion"" is to his enduring credit.</p>
<p>While <i>Instrumentals</i> suffers a bit in comparison to Cline's previous studio work with the huge Destroy     All Nels Cline ensemble, it's mostly because the three-piece lineup curtails some of the wild tonal     exploration done on that record.  Don't fret, though, these folks still have an awful lot going for them.     They can be furiously tight, for one thing, when in rock-mode.  ""Cause for Concern"" and ""Ghost of the     Piñata"" both make for sublime chase music; the former spits convoluted back-alley riffs out from between     clenched teeth, while the latter heat-shimmers with backwards reverb and crystalline arpeggios.  ""Suspended     Head"", dedicated in the liner notes to the awesome SF-based experimental art-rock band Deerhoof, comes off     as an even more elastic, unhinged version of the same.</p>
<p>In the presence of these tracks, the even more straightforward ""blues mutation"" ""Lowered Boom""-- a showcase     for Hoff's menacing bow-work and Cline's rawhide chops-- even starts to sound a little lackluster.  They     more than make up for it, though, on the less structured pieces.  The most immediately likable of these, the     fifteen-minute ""Blood Drawing"", slowly churns a soup of Can-ish string squeals into a spacy, arabesque     guitar workout.  Though it's hard to tell who's doing what at times, it often seems like Amendola is the     most interesting noisemaker of the group, stringing together drum loops on the fly and then letting them     decay beyond recognition.  On the ""freer"" pieces, ""A Mug Like Mine"" and ""Lucia"", it's Amendola too who acts     as the loosest cannon, battering away wildly enough to give Cline and Hoff's follow-the-leader skronk the     appearance of regularity.</p>
<p>All right, you knew I was going to have to use ""skronk"" sooner or later (and dammit, you would have said it,     too).  Given the amount of it that's made it onto this record, though, the Singers' capacity for melody and     delicacy is pretty remarkable.  Cline's relatively spare figures, Hoff's sobbing vibrato, and Amendola's     electronic manipulations on ""Harbor Child"" are all equally elegiac.  The closer, ""Slipped Away""-- probably     the most ""composed"" piece on the album-- is just as simply, sadly beautiful, pursuing the fundamental in     slow-motion through a wasted chordal countryside.  What's amazing is that this isn't really anything that     new for Nels; the faces (and the warped musical personalities behind them) have changed, but it's mainly     just another addition to a growing and worthwhile body of work.</p></div>"|1510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1510-instrumentals/|8.0|Brendan Reid

    what is-- except that he can paint a wild picture of slow snails, cold snow, the Charles C. Leary, and very
    nice people.  There are probably thousands of nomadic, dark troubadours who would stumble upon some
    surrealist notion of wisdom if given the time and the audience, but 21-year-old Devendra Banhart draws
    ellipses around more than mere romantic, hard travails and etched self-portraits.  In short, he isn't your
    everyday, everyman's folk singer, though folk aficionados would do well to weird themselves out every once
    in awhile with his stuff.</p><p>
    
    Banhart's debut release for Michael Gira's Young God label is the work of someone presumably half-awake to
    conventions like ""professional recordings"" but fully aware of his own idiosyncrasies even as he performs
    without much trace of pretension or self-conscious nuance.  The music on <i>Oh Me Oh My</i> is rarely more
    than an uncluttered combination of his unorthodox acoustic guitar pickings, more than a little tape hiss,
    and his immediately recognizable tenor.  Banhart's voice might be a cross of Tim Buckley's flutter, Marc
    Bolan's timbre, and Tiny Tim's vibrato, but I would be hard pressed to claim he was imitating anyone.
    Similarly, his songs hit like sea chanteys started by Syd Barrett and then left mysteriously half-finished.
    In some cases, this is frustrating, but for the most part it seems bizarrely fitting.</p><p>
    
    Banhart does share a link with traditional minstrels in the instances he opts for epic tragedy.  ""Soon Is
    Good"", one of the longer tracks here (the shortest being all of 39 seconds), could be about the buried pain
    of a lost love, though the typically half-nonsensical lyrics are tough to decipher.  Fortunately, the solemn,
    but not quite melancholy, guitar figures are uplifting enough to support Banhart's odd mumble.  Later, he
    drops lines like, ""My toes have my favorite feet,"" in ""Michigan State"" over understated, optimistic guitar
    accompaniment, and somehow comes off like a weathered road-poet.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the songs can range from whimsical to slightly crazed.  ""Lend Me Your Teeth"" stops just short of
    being a novelty number, perhaps due to the fact that Banhart keeps his yelp in check for most of it-- only
    leaping into whistle-warble territory for a brief stretch.  ""Nice People"" may be the spookiest song on the
    album, beginning with ominous strumming, only to explode into a chorus of witchy Devendras repeating ""they
    certainly are nice people!""  There are moments on <i>Oh Me Oh My</i> that seem as if I'm overhearing a
    private sketch rather than a performance.  Over the course of the CD, that might translate to ambience for
    some and annoyance for others.</p><p>
    
    And the idea of a personal sketch might have been the idea all along: none of the music here was meant for
    release, but merely Banhart's collection of home and road tapings.  It's possible that his voice would
    resonate more clearly with the aid of a good mic and decent mix, but that could very well detract from the
    considerable intimacy of his sound.  If part of a folk singer's power comes from the purity of his conviction,
    then Banhart's promising debut is the sign of someone destined for great, strange things.</p></div>"|546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/546-oh-me-oh-my/|7.8|Dominique Leone

Actually, not so much the Celtics as Larry
    Bird, the ""Hick from French Lick"".  Bird was my favorite player and when he retired from basketball, I lost
    interest in the game.  But one reason I liked him so much (besides the fact that he was one of the best
    players ever, and a fellow Hoosier) was that he brought out the best in others.  And not just his teammates,
    but his opponents, too: fellow Celtics Kevin McHale and Robert Parish would have been good, but not great,
    without Bird, and Magic Johnson and the Lakers were undoubtedly at their best when facing the Celtics and
    Bird.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it was because I was thirteen or so at the time, but I was honestly excited when it was announced that
    professional players were eligible for the Olympic Team. ""The Dream Team"", it was called, with Bird and
    Johnson and all the other greats on the same team. No one else stood a chance, and the thought of Bird
    dishing it off to Isaiah Thomas or Magic... well, to my young mind it was like Neil Peart jamming with Joe
    Satriani.  Of course, as good as this sounded at the time, I hadn't quite anticipated just how incredibly
    boring this would quickly become. I don't remember who they played in that first round of the Olympics or
    what the final score was (something like 278-29), but I do remember flipping to summertime re-runs of ""227""
    after about two dozen fast breaks in a row.</p><p>
    
    You probably see where I'm going with this. Amalgamated Sons of Rest is a Dream Team of sorts, if your dreams
    include birds of prey, whoring, and/or traveling in gypsy caravans.  Comprised of Will Oldham, Jason Molina
    from Songs: Ohia, and Alasdair Roberts from Appendix Out, the Sons o' Rest sound like a great idea on paper.
    Unfortunately, it also sounds exactly as you'd expect it to sound, and therein lies the problem.</p><p>
    
    Everything about this disc is a foregone conclusion, excepting who's going to sing bass on the three-part
    harmonies (usually Will).  From the mix of traditional and original material, to the subject matter (death,
    longing, whaling), the mood (dejected, yet philosophical), and the instrumentation (acoustic guitar, some
    piano), the record reeks of coasting.  Even the song titles (""Maa Bonny Lad"", ""The Gypsy He-Witch"") could
    be approximated beforehand.  Granted, no one was expecting anything revolutionary from this trio beyond
    what they've already accomplished with their own solo projects and full-time bands, but a little effort
    certainly couldn't have hurt.</p><p>
    
    Still, there are small pleasures, if only for completists. All three of these croaky crooners take two turns
    in the lead vocalist's rocking chair. On the remaining, uncredited song (the hidden track on the CD and the
    lone song on the etched side of the vinyl version) each members takes turns singing what could nearly pass
    for a children's song, with the chorus, ""I will be good,"" repeated with increasing adamancy.  It's by far
    the best offering here, not quite so serious as the other songs.</p><p>
    
    Oldham's single songwriting contribution,
    ""Major March"", is also notable, but for a different reason: it's one of the few songs here in which the
    members sound genuinely passionate about the project, which obviously makes for a solid track, but also
    serves to highlight the limitations of the rest of the disc.  The execution is forceful and determined,
    with Roberts and Molina echoing Oldham's stark phrasing: ""I have grown my hair out longer/ I have grown my
    beard out, too/ My skin is failing, my arms are frailing/ But you'd still know me, wouldn't you?""  During
    this chorus, in particular, the firm course of direction and the impassioned delivery on the part of each
    member makes sparklingly clear what this record is lacking elsewhere: leadership.</p></div>"|148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/148-amalgamated-sons-of-rest-ep/|5.9|Jason Nickey

At an age when
    most of us were asking ourselves ""Stridex or Noczema?"", Large Pro was dipping out of gym class to lay down
    tracks for the legendary Rakim Allah. From there, he went on to work with the likes of Biz Markie, A Tribe
    Called Quest, Pete Rock &amp; C.L. Smooth, the Beastie Boys, Gang Starr, Main Source, Nas, Big Daddy Kane, Kool
    G. Rap... and the list goes on and on and on. Unfortunately, at the height of his career, Large Professor
    signed with Geffen Records, who financed, promoted, and then promptly buried his debut album based on a
    perceived lack of interest in the excellent lead-off single ""I Just Wanna Chill"".  While there have certainly
    been greater travesties committed in the name of record company money, failing to release an already-completed
    album by one of hip-hop's masters surely ranks up there somewhere.</p><p>
    
    Seven years after the Geffen debacle, Extra P is back behind the boards and ready to prove that you don't
    need the Neptunes, a master's degree in Art Theory, or cases of Courvoisier to make a great hip-hop album.
    Large Pro still packs his tracks with that '93 flavor, and those of you who were around in '93 know that
    this isn't a bad thing.  The production on <i>1st Class</i>, his (second) debut album, sticks to the NYC
    roots hip-hop formula that Extra P helped refine. ""'Bout that Time"", which was released as a twelve-inch
    nearly two years ago, exemplifies Large Professor's approach. A simple drum track thumps harder than a Suge
    Knight pistolwhip with a distorted horn tightly looped to further emphasize the track's aggression and
    momentum.  In Large Pro's world, pop gimmicks are ineffectual and redefinition takes a back seat to
    perfection.</p><p>
    
    For reasons that will be explained later, the highlights of <i>1st Class</i> are the tracks that feature
    guest emcees.  Nas, who was introduced to the world on Large Professor's ""At the BBQ"", guests on the sublime
    ""Stay Chisel"". Over a slickly soulful production that sounds straight off the <i>Car Wash</i> soundtrack,
    Nas switches to conscious mode, rapping, ""Take the weight of the world on my shoulders, I hold it/ So I
    consume most of the pain for my niggas I roll wit'/ 'Cause, see, the streets ain't no Gold's Gym poppy/ And
    if I feel it going down then my niggas will spot me.""  Not to be out-conscioused by QB's finest, Q-Tip shows
    up two songs later on ""In the Sun"" to drop his best verse in years.  Large Pro delivers a simple boom-bap
    beat with harmonizing gospel vocals turned down real low in the mix to affect a smoothly reflective mood.
    Surprisingly, Q-Tip finds a fresh and ironic angle to highlight racial hypocrisy and urban decay: ""Where's
    the 40 acres and a mule?/ You'd rather give us Micky D's and a tool/ And in the sun I see the way you pull
    our heart strings.""</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Large Pro is a far better producer than he is an emcee. His flow is a bit monotone and stale--
    imagine Guru with a little more bass and a little less variance-- and his lyrics are rather insular and rarely
    reference anything outside of the world of hip-hop, with a noted exception being the sadly nostalgic verse
    he drops on ""In the Sun"". His limited mic skills can work when he has a guest emcee to play off, or on upbeat
    tracks such as ""'Bout that Time"" and ""Born to Ball"" when his deep voice acts as yet another percussive element.
    But he falls flat when the tracks are more delicately nuanced and the focus lies on actual content rather
    than momentum.  While a plethora of guest vocals is generally a liability for an album, Large Pro might want
    to consider enlisting a few more of his legendary friends for the next LP.  After all these years, his
    production work is still amongst the best in the businesses, and it would be hard to imagine anyone turning
    down the opportunity to spit over a Large Pro beat.</p></div>"|4691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4691-1st-class/|7.5|Sam Chennault

    A) No. 2<br/>
    B) Barry Bonds<br/>
    C) A brick of hash</p><p>
    
    Give up? The answer, of course, is that all three are pretty damn solid. Now, the connection between that
    selfish slugger and a hellofalotta hashish is obvious: love 'em or hate 'em, they consistently produce
    effective, often staggering results-- though you probably wouldn't want to get with (or by) either of them.
    Plus, you can only really take so much Bonds or hash before you lose your mind.</p><p>
    
    No. 2, a three-man outfit led by former Heatmiser co-songwriter Neil Gust, is a completely different kind of
    solid. Whereas hash goes up in smoke, and steroids go up in Bonds' ass, there's nothing deceitful about No.
    2. Though hardly staggering, their results are always rock-solid and don't require moderation on the listener's
    part. But therein lies the positive and the negative, wrapped up like yin and yang-- or, better yet, like
    Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton in <i>Monster's Ball</i>, except not nearly as sexy or fucked up (respectively, of course).</p><p>
<i>What Does Good Luck Bring?</i> exhibits sound songwriting, as one should expect from Gust. His significant
    contributions to Heatmiser were overshadowed by the later success of his former bandmate, Elliott Smith; their
    excellent swan song, 1996's <i>Mic City Sons</i>, was as much Gust's child as Smith's.  And when Gust released
    his impressive debut, <i>No Memory</i>, with No. 2 in 1999, his talent was proven. That record was in many ways
    a continuation of the pop/rock that Heatmiser had perfected, and it never came close to receiving the attention
    it deserved.</p><p>
    
    Smith, as we all know, went on to become a media darling with his Oscar-nominated contributions to the <i>Good
    Will Hunting</i> soundtrack. Now he's back to fighting obscurity, where Gust has been all along. Fortunately,
    though, <i>What Does Good Luck Bring?</i> isn't the sound of a talented songwriter trying to prove himself.
    No. 2 effortlessly crank out 36 minutes of rock, though with slightly less pop than their earlier work. Frank
    Black's first couple albums with The Catholics come to mind. These songs are crisp and clean, but they have
    the live feel of a band that has toured relentlessly (as No. 2 have).</p><p>
    
    ""What, then, is the negative?"" you ask. Simply put, No. 2 lack adventurousness. Gust knows the formula and
    he'll be damned if he's going to mess with it. This results in plenty of head-bobbers, with the band opening
    (as Heatmiser often did) with poppy licks and then moving on through that good old rock-song structure. The
    lyrics are equally inoffensive. ""I don't mind a little confusion/ I don't mind, throw it all away,"" Gust
    sings in the opener, ""A Little Confusion"". He's pretty much cool with whatever-- a mentality he duly passes
    on to the listener.</p><p>
    
    Not that <i>What Does Good Luck Bring?</i> is devoid of any variation. The pop factor is still evident in
    many spots, from the handclaps in ""More, More"" to the cowbell in ""Good Intentions"". ""8:45 a.m."", meanwhile,
    offers up a downright countrified beat. And there are several slow, wistful moments, such as the atmospheric
    folk-pop of ""Stranger's March""-- which recalls Smith's DreamWorks output-- and the closing title track, which
    pairs Gust with another former Heatmiser bandmate, Sam Coomes of Quasi.</p><p>
    
    In the end, though, a little something is missing. Maybe it's that Gust has ridden the same horse one too
    many times. Maybe he's just lost a half-step. Whatever the reason, one can't help but listen to <i>What Does
    Good Luck Bring?</i> and to Smith's last album, 2000's <i>Figure 8</i>, and wish that maybe, somehow, these
    two would team up again to spark their creative fires.</p></div>"|5813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5813-what-does-good-luck-bring/|7.0|Ryan Kearney

    American record stores still carried British weeklies like the <i>NME</i>. There was a time back then, in
    this imported Brit-indie world, when Alan McGee seemed incredibly important. He ran Creation Records back
    when people still wanted rock labels to be legendary: he signed My Bloody Valentine and the Jesus and Mary
    Chain. He also signed Oasis, who bankrolled his massive drug habit for quite a while; after that he got
    really into soccer, palled around with Prime Minister Tony Blair, sold Creation, and went off to start a
    new label called Poptones.</p><p>
    
    Lush were important, too: they gave hilarious interviews to the weeklies, lent guitars to Kevin Shields,
    and hung out with the Cocteau Twins. They started off making shimmery shoegazer records and then gradually
    turned to making shimmery Britpop records, and just when something commercial started happening, their
    drummer killed himself. The others, understandably, went off for a while as well, and now one of them--
    guitar player Emma Anderson-- is back, on Alan McGee's new label. No surprise: they were part of the same
    changing game.</p><p>
    
    As were a lot of the folks on <i>The Joy of Sing-Sing</i>, which is like a collision of Anderson's and singer
    Lisa O'Neill's friends.  Emma borrows former members from shoegazers Moonshake and Slowdive spin-off Mojave 3;
    O'Neill, of slightly more recent pedigrees, escorts members of the Departure Lounge and the more ambient
    Locust.  Sing-Sing's first single was even released by Cocteau Twin Robin Guthrie's Bella Union imprint.
    What this supergroup of the vaguely dated are assembled to do is the same pretty ambitious thing you get
    from high-gloss, tech-savvy acts from Goldfrapp to Garbage, and the same thing you get from shoegazers-gone-pop
    like The Verve or Mercury Rev or that disappointing last Lush album: Sing-Sing are using the whole run of
    studio technology to make a tight, interesting, and great-sounding pop record.</p><p>
    
    What's surprising, in this instance, is that this down-the-center approach to ambitiously arranged pop gives
    the group a ton of room to pack in a refreshingly wide variety of ideas. The obvious bases get covered: the
    fizzy swagger of Curve, or the slick trip-hop loops of however million Monos and Hooverphonics swarmed across
    the late 90s. But then the band's off elsewhere: swinging rhythms and hyper-sunny harmonies on the Stereolabby
    ""Far Away from Love"", shiny futuristic Motown on ""Feels Like Summer"", late-period Lush ambience on ""Underage"".
    Anderson even goes full-scale on her long-standing pull toward saccharine 80s pop, turning ""Panda Eyes""-- a
    Lush song if I've ever heard one-- into the sort of dreamily pulsing, synth-heavy number you might imagine
    coming either from a Corey Haim movie or the Darling Buds. The spirit of 4AD-- Lush's label, the label that
    turned the word ""ethereal"" into a critical staple-- makes a number of visits: O'Neill, who both sings and
    writes melodies disturbingly like Shelleyan Orphan's Caroline Crawley, invites the comparison directly on a
    few arty crooners. *</p><p>
    
    All of which could easily have been the dullest, nicely produced thing in the world, if not for the fact
    that the songs are remarkably good. This, actually, was the whole glory of Americans listening to British
    rock bands as ""indie"" in our sense of the word: as opposed to the raw, grotty rockers slouching around the
    U.S., the Brits were honestly trying to write fabulous perfect pop singles that would get them on the cover
    of <i>Melody Maker</i> or on ""Top of the Pops"". Which is what <i>The Joy of Sing-Sing</i> delivers, more or
    less-- the pair's melodic turns are all pop, consistently sharp, and oddly fresh-sounding, and the structures
    of the arrangements are clever and sophisticated enough to spend a decent amount of time picking through.</p><p>
    
    Making a great big shiny pop/rock record: sometimes it seems like everyone is trying to do it, and sometimes
    it seems like everyone is too much of a wimp to try. Right now seems a little like the latter-- so the fact
    that this album occasionally sounds like it's competing with 1995 Britpop flashes like Echobelly and Sleeper
    seems more like adorable charm than grounds for dismissal. If Starsailor and Coldplay are what popular
    British indie bands have come to, a little nostalgia isn't out of order, and Sing-Sing, Black Box Recorder,
    and the still-brilliant Pulp can be forgiven a whole lot.</p><p>
    
    Granted, if you're one for history, you could find it a useless little anachronism. But even if it turns out
    to be an incredibly useless thing, it would be churlish to pretend that it's not the best little useless
    thing it can possibly be. Sing-Sing have made a sharp, simple record that will change absolutely nothing.</p><p>
<font size=""-2"">* Since 4AD pedants seem the type for indignant letters, I'd like to note that I know
    Shelleyan Orphan were not actually on 4AD: they just might as well have been, and anyway, Crawley makes
    more appearances on the This Mortal Coil records than anyone from Lush.</font></p></div>"|7178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7178-the-joy-of-sing-sing/|7.4|Nitsuh Abebe

    intense interest in what was going on over at legendary house of twee-focused Sarah Records.  Aberdeen
    existed for a time back then as a duo-- a couple and their trusty drum machine cranking out a couple EPs of
    shimmery pop.  And then they vanished, the victim of relationship tensions that lead to a five-year hiatus.</p><p>
    And now they're back, reconvened with an expanded lineup and a long-awaited full-length that shows them no
    worse for the wear from the time off.  In fact, if anything, they've improved considerably by expanding their
    sound (a human touch at the drum kit adds immeasurably), introducing dynamics and a certain lushness that
    just weren't there before.  Above all, <i>Homesick and Happy to Be Here</i> sounds great, an inviting, warm
    listen that sounds especially good with a cold wind whipping outside.</p><p>
    The members of the band retain a certain degree of anonymity, withholding their surnames in the liners and
    press materials, and it seems fitting enough for a band this approachable to be known only by their first
    names.  The album opens with the sleepy ""Handsome Drink"", wherein vocalist Beth, draped in a haze of reverb,
    aptly declares, ""I can't wake up,"" in the chorus.  From there, Aberdeen take off on a tear through an endlessly
    naïve world of post-adolescent love, full of crushes and likely lots of heavy petting.  It works well with
    the music, but if you spend too much time reading the lyrics it might make you a bit sick (plus, the grammar
    is pretty atrocious in the booklet).</p><p>
    Regardless, Beth's understated vocal delivery fits it perfectly, whether she's telling you about a flagging
    relationship or just reeling off some la-la-la's.  Behind her, the band largely alternates between slow,
    contemplative arrangements and peppier backings that usually turn out a lot more satisfying.  ""Sink or Float""
    and ""Sunny in California"" are loose, laidback pop songs that nevertheless move at a rapid clip, and both rank
    among the album's best entries.  Elsewhere, ""Clouds Like These"" makes good use of loungy Latin rhythms and
    sparser instrumentation.</p><p>
    Yet, for all its successes, there are moments where the album doesn't quite hit-- for instance, the wandering
    ""Thousand Steps"", which just isn't bold enough to support its slow pace and meandering structure, and winds
    up getting lost in the background.  The next song, ""Homesick"", seems ready to follow suit at first, but saves
    itself with a sharp dynamic shift near the end and a more thoughtful arrangement.</p><p>
    It's difficult to say if Aberdeen are back for good with this release, but I certainly won't register any
    complaints if they are.  <i>Homesick and Happy to Be Here</i> is hardly a landmark or some sort of masterpiece,
    but it's still highly enjoyable, and that's ultimately what's important with music like this.  If you're
    looking for an easy-going album with a strong melodic core, Aberdeen might be worth the trip.</p></div>"|11.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11-homesick-and-happy-to-be-here/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    last year's <i>Endless Summer</i>, Touch presents <i>Field Recordings
    1995-2002</i>, an assortment of compilation contributions, soundtrack work,
    unreleased tracks, and remixes from laptop wunderkind Fennesz-- plus the
    entirety of the notable 1996 debut EP <i>Instrument</i>. It's interesting to
    hear Fennesz again stripped of the conceptual cues that played a part in
    <i>Endless Summer</i>'s success. In addition to the fantastic music, <i>Endless
    Summer</i> was a triumph of small label indie marketing. It's true that it had
    thematic unity and a good half the tracks followed the pattern of the <i>Plays</i>
    single, dissecting the structures of pop music in the context of an abstract
    computer-composed record. But if Fennesz had given the album a title like
    <i>XRtN8ts</i> and slapped some vector graphics on the cover, there's no way in
    hell the words ""beach"" or ""boys"" would have made it into a single review.</p><p>
    So <i>Field Recordings 1995-2002</i> is a great opportunity to interface with
    Fennesz' music directly, mediated only by the absolutely gorgeous Jon Wozencroft
    photography and design that adorns most Touch releases. And Christian once again
    brings the goods, with a handful of stunning tracks, a few more very good ones,
    and a nice overall portrait of his development as an artist. It may technically
    be a c: drive disk cleanup, but <i>Field Recordings</i> is strong throughout,
    and serves as a solid Fennesz sampler.</p><p>
    It's particularly instructive to hear Fennesz's work in early form on the five
    tracks that comprise <i>Instrument</i>.  He still seemed to be finding his
    footing at that stage, and these tracks are much more readily identifiable
    as pure IDM than what came after. ""Instrument 3"" has the kind of skittery,
    insanely quick beats-as-texture that Autechre would fully commit to by the
    time of <i>LP5</i> and <i>EP7</i>, and ""Instrument 4"" isn't terribly far from
    the more disturbing end of Aphex Twin's <i>Selected Ambient Works II</i>. The
    other two <i>Instrument</i> tracks show Fennesz's talent with drone construction,
    but the occasional intrusion of not-terribly-imaginative beats holds ""Instrument
    1"" back.</p><p>
    The remainder of <i>Field Recordings</i> is a highly appealing hodgepodge. Two
    tracks involve remix work with inventive composer Ekkehard Ehlers. Fennesz'
    beautiful version of Ehlers material ""\xDFetrieb"" does wonders with the string
    and organ textures, combining the 20th Century classical air with wispy
    electronics. Fennesz's remix of ""Coedine"", a track by Ehlers and Stephen
    Mathieu, is no less beautiful, awash with more organ and acoustic guitar
    strumming, and given tension by unpredictable patches of static.</p><p>
    The inclusion of ""Menthol"" from <i>Clicks + Cuts 2</i> is welcome to anyone who
    missed that compilation.  This track's warm bed of gurgling processing ranks it
    as on obvious precursor to <i>Endless Summer</i>. ""Good Man"" is an unreleased
    gem of recent vintage that shows Fennesz at peak interest in combining acoustic
    strums with seemingly unrelated but complimentary laptop squiggles (whatever his
    skill level on the instrument, Fennesz is again content to pepper his electronic
    work with rudimentary chords).</p><p>
    Several short tracks culled from soundtrack projects point to a more subtle
    side of Fennesz. ""Stairs"" is from the soundtrack to the film <i>Blue Moon</i>,
    and it's basically a bed of quaking bass pedals mixed with hiccups and pops.
    ""Invendoo"" is kind of a laptop version of Nurse with Wound, all eerie scrapes
    and the sucking sound of container lids being pried open. Continuing his
    interest in covers, ""Namewithnohorse"" destroys the chords to America's ""Horse
    With No Name"", burying the strums in an avalanche of distortion. This sounds
    interesting but the development is lacking-- it's easily the worst track here.</p><p>
    Still, <i>Field Recordings 1995-2002</i> affirms Fennesz's status among the
    most gifted artists working the abstract end of the electronic music landscape.
    References to his established style affirm his strengths, and some of the
    odd tangents point to the dozen interesting directions his music might yet
    take. This doesn't rank with his last two full lengths, but <i>Field Recordings</i>
    is a must for any serious fan.</p></div>"|3033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3033-field-recordings-1995-2002/|8.3|Mark Richardson

    underrecorded Boston band, the Pee Wee Fist.  Fist leader Pete Fitzpatrick had a longtime friendship with
    the band-- he's now their full-time guitarist-- and listening to their debut, <i>You Were a Diamond</i>, it
    was easy to hear the similarities.  Stylistically, both bands remained just outside any standard indie rock
    and alt-country conventions.  Their leaders wrote and sung with deep but matter-of-fact expressiveness, cut
    with clever wordplay and imagery and just enough humor.  And there was the use of non-rock instruments to
    make their sound more intriguing: in Clem Snide it was Jason Glasser on cello, whose playing here-- which
    can sound whisperingly soft, sandpaper rough or decorously smooth-- is a striking complement to Eef Barzelay's
    raspy, harsh singing.</p><p>
<i>You Were a Diamond</i>-- just reissued by spinART, with two bonus tracks-- is starker and coarser than
    anything else the band has done, with less of the irony and pop culture references that Barzelay now employs
    in his writing.  Their songs also have darker, almost folky arrangements that are effectively atmospheric.
    At times, the album's as sad as watching an old woman drive alone to a cemetery.  Barzelay emotes himself
    hoarse on ""Uglier Than You"", one of his most harrowing songs; and on ""Row"", he aches his way through the
    lyrics as Glasser and guest saw player Sue Weston bend and whisper as cooly as wind through a pile of
    leaves.  Here, the band-- and Glasser in particular-- are grim colorists, playing more loosely and
    spontaneously than on their later, more polished records.</p><p>
    
    Other songs are hopeful, and even blissful: for example, the convincingly crooned take on Hank Williams'
    ""Lost on the River"", with Pete Fitzpatrick soloing on banjo.  And just when you were sick to death of songs
    about driving the highways late into the night, ""I Can't Stay Here Tonight"" captures the mood perfectly,
    with Barzelay's weary vocals nicely balanced by the light use of bells between the verses.  But best of all
    is ""Nick Drake Tape"", written around memories of listening to mixtapes and being with a troubled girlfriend.
    Barzelay is gifted at indulging in sentiment while cutting straight through it, and on this track, he puts
    a beautiful tune and some of his most vulnerable singing together with increasingly dark verses.  Glasser's
    gently scraped bowing in the outro is a perfect close.</p><p>
<i>You Were a Diamond</i> includes one of Clem Snide's first singles, the waltz ""Your Night to Shine"", and
    even a bonus video of the song.  (The visuals aren't too exciting, but Barzelay looks just like a sullen
    Buddy Holly.)  This song is closer to the later Snide: with the addition of a full-time drummer on their
    next album, the band began to make catchier and livelier music-- their latest album, <i>The Ghost of Fashion</i>,
    even has a horn section.  Of the three records, <i>Your Favorite Music</i> may be their best, but this debut
    is a close second: it's a beautiful and gently melancholy album that crawls under your skin, and this is a
    welcome re-release.</p></div>"|1497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1497-you-were-a-diamond/|7.9|Chris Dahlen

    back underground.  On the great up/down genre superhighway, psych-pop seems to be tunneling deeper beneath
    the earth's crust, waving at metal, punk-funk, and synth-pop as they zoom past in the opposite direction.
    Fans of the form shouldn't fret; in roughly 12-15 years, the paisley sound of the mid-to-late sixties should
    be due for another resurgence.  In the meantime, you'll just have to settle for quieter media attention,
    smaller shows, and bands with more letters in their name than fans.</p><p>
    
    Like, for instance, the Shimmer Kids Underpop Association, a Bay Area project with all the markings of
    vintage E6 material.  In the Last Will and Testament of Olivia Tremor Control, the Shimmer Kids must've been
    bequeathed that band's recording equipment, as the Shimmer Kids' eight-track recordings at ""The Church of
    the Amplifier"" (aka the singer's bedroom) replicate the sun-bleached lo-fi sound of OTC.  And with artwork
    inspired by Marvel Comics legend Jack Kirby, a Philip K. Dick quote in the liner notes, and a musical
    sensibility ignoring anything post-Beach Boys, the Kids appear to share a historical interest with Doss &amp;
    Hart as well.</p><p>
    
    Which means <i>The Natural Riot</i> doesn't exactly sound like the freshest produce at the Farmer's Market,
    but at least they earn high marks for competence.  Singer Josh Babcock's pinched voice floats over a muddy
    mix of your standard guitar/bass/drums while theremins, sloppy brass, gypsy strings, keyboards, and
    instruments unknown all make appearances.  ""Matadors in Red"" benefits from a darker tint to its piano
    foundation; ""The Getaway"" is endearingly warbled like early Scat-era Guided by Voices; the jalopy horn
    section of ""Like Candy, Like Poison"" lends a crooked oldies feel.  It's no accident, though, that all these
    highlights come early in the album-- <i>The Natural Riot</i> tapers as it progresses, becoming increasingly
    lost in its own fuzziness.</p><p>
    
    One thing the Shimmer Kids didn't inherit from Olivia Tremor Control, though, is the predilection for obtuse
    found-sound collage, making the album an easier listen, if not nearly as unique.  The lyrical preciousness of
    ""Baby Bankrobber"", the Brian Wilson harmonies of ""Another Planet"", the Latin spicing of ""Se Acabo, Le Fiesta""--
    all fail to achieve more than subtle adjustments to a fairly uniform pace and sound.</p><p>
    
    Decent as <i>The Natural Riot</i> is, the Shimmer Kids Underpop Association can be faulted more for bad
    timing than for making a bad album.  Five years ago (or twenty years from now), this record might've been
    something special in the middle of widespread zeal for the psych-pop format.  Now it just sounds a bit too
    familiar to stand out.  Underground music is in continual mutation-- unhipness tends to filter out the
    Johnny-come-latelys and forces the die-hards to craft ever more inventive, tight sounds to survive.  The
    Shimmer Kids may continue to honorably wave the flag for psychedelia to a reduced audience, but they also
    illustrate that the sound is a ways off from resurrection.</p></div>"|7109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7109-the-natural-riot/|6.9|Rob Mitchum

    end of the last century. By the sound of <i>Fugues &amp; Flowers</i>, though, they're pure Ft Worth, Texas.
    That is, their Southern roots shine most obviously in the band's similarity to Texan Ornette Coleman's
    early 60s quartet with Don Cherry, Billy Higgins and Charlie Haden.  And instrumentation isn't the only
    common trait the two bands share-- a freewheeling mixture of haphazard heads, breakneck group interplay,
    and occasional lapses into inner-space are major bullet points for both.  It's a relief that these guys
    weren't satisfied with the superficial bonds, though, because they go even further into homage by playing
    music that is never less than viscerally engaging (even when they lead us on wild goose chases).</p><p>
    
    Another notable connection for the Gold Sparkle Band is bassist William Parker, with whom sax/clarinetist
    Charles Waters, trumpeter Roger Ruzow and amazing drummer Andrew Barker have performed.  This is an important
    connection because like Parker, this group forgoes the typically eclectic New York City avant-garde sound for
    a more traditionally ""free"" jazz style.  This is not to say they play straight-ahead (and their raucous, epic
    pieces are as boisterous as any experimental klezmer band you'd care to name), but they're firmly part of a
    lineage including Coleman, Albert Ayler, Cecil Taylor and their heirs.</p><p>
<i>Fugues &amp; Flowers</i>, the band's fourth release, documents several shows from late 2000.  The opener
    ""Zodiac Attack"" is the most rhythmically straightforward on the album, as Barker and bassist Adam Roberts
    lay down a deft Latin-influenced groove over which the horns offer a typically flighty Ornette tribute
    (and come dangerously close to sounding like fellow Coleman admirers, John Zorn's Masada).  It doesn't take
    long for the fireworks to start, as Waters' solo begins restless but restrained, and explodes into
    skronk-fury.  After a brief solo entrance by Ruzow, both horns join in with Barker for more hi-energy
    interaction.  The Gold Sparkle Band are most often at their best when they droop the solo/head/solo structure
    and simply all dive in at once.  The last solo here belongs to Barker, and even those of you that hate the
    idea of a long drum solo should dig this one.  (He's a monster and then some.)</p><p>
    
    ""Motor City Fugue"" begins with a somber trumpet/clarinet exposition, but the bottom falls out soon enough.
    Of course, the idea of a jazz fugue isn't new; this group's subjects, answers and various interweaving
    lines, however, usually seem closer to vaguely related ideas than formally connected passages.  As extended
    group improvisation goes, the band has a knack for keeping brainstorms in the ballpark of outsider
    comprehension.  Waters' clarinet soliloquy about five minutes in is reason enough to stay alert, but
    Barker's return near the end (amazingly, his strokes suffered no ill-effects after twenty minutes playing
    behind the band) is as much a feat of endurance as it is musical statement.  So, the Gold Sparkle Band's
    next move should be interesting: do they continue refining the sound of still vibrant post-ESP jazz, or
    declare intentions fully their own?  Moments here suggest that the latter isn't out of the question.</p></div>"|3499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3499-fugues-flowers/|7.5|Dominique Leone

Elderly women call the cops and     complain about smashed pumpkins. Middle-school teachers arise thirty minutes early to pull down the countless     strands of toilet paper draped over their thinning trees. And kids return to school with bellyaches-- not     from those Snickers bars the night before, but from those Snickers bars this morning.</p>
<p>I guess, then, that it's too late for Thomas Bangalter's soundtrack to the controversial French film     <i>Irreversible</i>. As half of French duo Daft Punk, Bangalter might have seemed a good candidate to     compose that perfect post-Halloween mix, with enough funky breaks to ease your pain and help you look ahead     to Friday night. Not so. Instead, this here is the perfect Fright Night soundtrack. Screw those silly     Hannibal masks; <i>Irreversible</i> can be downright scary.</p>
<p>And Bangalter doesn't even ease you into the darkness. The title track opens with that horror flick standard:     two kickdrum beats, then a single, echoed snare beat. Add to that a shrill pitch and deep organ chords, and     you've got yourself an ideal score to a late-70s slasher flick. This plodding pace continues for more than     six minutes with little variation. The masked killer just keeps stalking you, taking his sweet-ass time     walking down the shadowy hallway, and all you can do is look back, stumble, and fall flat on your face.</p>
<p>But what's even scarier about this and subsequent tracks is that Gaspar Nóe's <i>Irreversible</i> isn't a     horror movie-- at least not by genre. Told anachronistically, a la <i>Memento</i>, the film traces the     origins of a violent opening scene. When it was shown at this year's Cannes Film Festival, 250 people walked     out and 20 people needed oxygen after fainting, according to <i>NME</i>. The reason? Part of it, I would     imagine, had to do with the nine-minute rape scene. Not exactly the best inspiration for another celebration     like ""One More Time"", is it?</p>
<p>At least now you know.  This isn't daft, and it sure as hell isn't punk.  It's a downbeat soundtrack made     more frightening by the fact that, during one or more of these songs, someone is being brutally raped. Is     it during the swirling air-raid siren that drowns in and out of the warped ""Rectum""?  (Let's hope not!)     Perhaps during ""Stress"", with its drab bass thud, hyperactive electro-harpsichord and (more) ominous organ     chords. Or maybe it's as the beat picks up on ""Outrage"", and Bangalter swirls wavering electric fuzz around     your head.</p>
<p>But there are uplifting moments, too, even if <i>Irreversible</i> is largely devoid of the ecstatic rave-ups     for which Daft Punk is known. The hi-hat, thumping bass and ceaseless ringing in ""Outrun"" will sound familiar     to fans of the band's 1996 debut <i>Homework</i>. So, too, will the funky guitar toyed with on ""Extra Dry"",     or the distorted vocals on the house-driven ""Ventura/Into the Tunnel"", during which Bangalter regularly     submerges the sound 20 feet below water, then allows it to resurface.</p>
<p>Only with ""Spinal Scratch"" does Bangalter approach the better aspects of Daft Punk's sophomore effort, last     year's <i>Discovery</i>. The one truly fresh, inventive song here, it revolves around relentlessly tweaked     guitar notes (or so they seem) with the occasional all-out breakdown. Like the best of Daft Punk, it's hard     to summarize through its musical components; suffice to say, it grabs you and moves your every cell.</p>
<p>And yet, like every Bangalter number here-- there are also Beethoven and Mahler excerpts, plus an unbearable     French pop song-- ""Spinal Scratch"" is far too repetitive. Daft Punk has always been fond of looping, but they     also mix it up enough that most tracks are engaging from beginning to end. Here, you get what you'd expect     from a film score-- a lot of mood music with minimal song structure-- and as such, nothing on <i>Irreversible</i> is too arm-raising, except for when it scares the shit out of you. It would have come in handy last night,     but I suppose there's always next year.</p></div>"|542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/542-irreversible/|6.0|Ryan Kearney

    congas, singing bowl, ""heaven bells"", ""camel bells"", and other contraptions rattle over the horizon like a
    VW bus full of chandeliers.  But that's just the intro: it suddenly drops off and you're hit by a screeching,
    high-end rock assault.  A pounding rhythm section bursts in, followed by bare-chested, doped-up rock-god
    vocals, and more than anything, guitars-- lots of them, grinding, screeching, scratching, and wrung through
    effects and oscillation.  And for the whole rest of the album, that's all you get.  But isn't that enough?</p><p>
    
    The craziest astro-named band since Uranus &amp; The Five Moons, Comets on Fire plays noise/psychedelic/space-rock.
    You'll hear many familiar sounds and riffs, but the band jumbles them up and cranks them so high they sound
    fresh again; and they also have a kind of trademark in their excessive use of Echoplex, a delay and echo
    device that dates back to the early days of rock.  It's the main job of one guy, Noel Harmonson, just to
    work the Echoplex and oscillations through which the Comets run the guitars and the vocals.  This makes a
    sound that's not unlike being screamed at through a fifty-foot cardboard tube.</p><p>
<i>Field Recordings</i> is their second album, after a self-titled limited edition debut that got attention
    for its fierce cover of ""Back in the U.S.S.R.""  This follow-up is just as nasty but much more involved:
    where the debut was sharp, terse and loud as fuck, <i>Field Recordings</i> is sprawling, massive, and loud
    as fuck.  There are four guys in the band: Harmonson, guitarist and singer Ethan Miller, the awesomely named
    Utrillo Belcher (his business cards actually read ""Potsie U. Belcher"") on drums, and Ben Flashman on bass--
    and they're joined by over half a dozen guests.  Ben Chasny of Six Organs of Admittance and the Fucking
    Champs' Tim Green (who also produced the album) guest on guitar, and on ""Beneath the Iceage"", there's a
    handful of people who just drink, chant and shake stuff.</p><p>
    
    Chasny also writes one of the songs: ""The Unicorn"", much as Shel Silverstein did for the Irish Rovers.  This,
    the album's shortest and only quiet tune starts as a folky acoustic ballad until it's crept up on by a bunch
    of overdubbed electrics.  (The liner notes call them ""electric floating guitar"", ""electric destruction guitar""...
    hell, I don't even need my thesaurus to write this review.)  Picture finding a grove full of hobbits and
    smashing them all with a hammer.</p><p>
    
    But this is just an intermission compared to the other songs.  Lean even at six-to-ten minutes each, the
    tracks are carefully arranged pieces coated with mess.  The spontaneity of the playing belies the deliberate
    transitions, like the jerky end of ""ESP"" or the controlled breakdown into electric splatter on ""Black Poodle"".
    The guitars and electronics that scribble out the end of that track spill through a suburban guitar shop's
    worth of excessive gadgetry: this is definitely one of album's high points.</p><p>
    
    You won't hum these tracks on your way to work, and who knows what the lyrics are-- never mind if they're
    any good.  However, next time, Comets on Fire could bring in more variety.  They might even turn down the
    volume a couple more times, you know, for artistic effect.  Still, as a pure assault, this album's
    terrifically brutal and single-minded: with far better distribution than their debut, it'll be most people's
    introduction to the band, and it makes an awesome first impression.</p></div>"|1561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1561-field-recordings-from-the-sun/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

    1) Shouting out the name of a completely different band than the one that's playing, preferably one
    that's close enough to seem like an honest error (i.e. yelling out ""SIGUR ROS!!!"" at a Mum show).</p><p>
    
    2) Shouting ""Blueshammer!"" at a band whose riffage is getting a little too chug-a-lug (director's
    commentary: Blueshammer being the frat-boy blooze act from <i>Ghost World</i>).</p><p>
    
    3) The all-purpose cry of ""FILLER!"" when a band busts out one of the omnipresent lesser tracks from its
    newest release.</p><p>
    
    Some bands, however, make the wise choice of leaving the filler off the LP and choose instead to segregate
    it onto a collectible EP-- you know, for fans.  That's the path Luna's taken with <i>Close Cover Before
    Striking</i>, a companion piece to their album <i>Romantica</i> from earlier in the '02.  All the usual
    suspects are here: outtakes from the original sessions, covers, an instrumental, enhanced video files.</p><p>
    
    Funny thing, though: it ain't half bad!  For one, thirty minutes and seven songs of Luna seems just about
    right these days, when they've settled into a stable but enjoyable holding pattern of midtempo guitar rock.
    For two, because it kicks off with ""Astronaut"", which pits Indian-war-cry effects guitar against Wareham's
    patented deadpan delivery, mixing in some peppy drums to keep the affair from getting too sleepy.  It all
    leaves you reveling in just how good that Luna formula can still sound.</p><p>
    
    After the peak of ""Astronaut"" it's all downhill, though more of a pleasant log roll down a slow incline than
    a jump off a cliff.  While <i>Romantica</i> oozed springy sunshine and baseball matinees (as described by the
    very talented writer of our site's exceptional review), <i>Close Cover</i> seems to collect the darker
    material from those sessions-- and just in time for the Fall months.  Less lovey-dovey stuff and less ""oodles
    and oodles,"" the whimsy of Wareham's lyrics has a more devilish slant, be it evoking images of ""tiny nightmares
    in the sky"" or telling you that he wants to ""feed you Diazepam.""</p><p>
    
    But maybe it's just the plunging mercury getting me down, as most tracks here still have that same airy Luna
    quality to keep them miles away from dismalness.  A little too much of that breeziness, perhaps, as ""Teenage
    Lightning"", ""The Alibi"", and ""New Haven Comet"" drift by without leaving much of a trail, warm, barely
    remembered dreams.  ""Drunken Whistler"", the obligatory sans-vocal outtake, even seems a little half-finished,
    only saved by a keyboard preset drumloop that keeps coming and going like an evening mosquito.</p><p>
    
    As for the covers, the Rolling Stones' ""Waiting on a Friend"" isn't much of a stretch for the band, coming
    as it does from the poppier side of the Jagger/Richards catalog.  Other than Wareham's tremulous voice
    converting the main character ""watching girls passing by"" from sleazy to shy, it's a straight reading,
    right down to the shimmer guitars.  Taking on ""Neon Lights"" is a more intriguing choice, given that Kraftwerk
    and Luna are two bands rarely thought to be in the same ballpark, or nation, or continent.  But it's a little
    bit disappointing to hear just how completely the group envelops the computer spasms of the original with
    their own sound, leaving us with another Luna-ish song rather than a scary mutant hybrid of the two bands.</p><p>
    
    But these are all minor quibbles; as leftovers, <i>Close Cover Before Striking</i> is more akin to day-old
    pizza than three-week-old pasta.  As a supplemental EP, it holds more potential for repeated listening than
    for under-bed dust-collecting, and continues the gratifying solid streak Luna's been on of late.  So, Dean,
    next time you're playing DC and you hear some asshole yelling ""Galaxie 500!!!"" at you from the crowd, know
    that I'm just giving you a playful heckle.  What do you expect if you don't give me much to yell ""FILLER!""
    about?</p></div>"|4918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4918-close-cover-before-striking-ep/|7.5|Rob Mitchum

    improved on the electro-acoustic folk of his 1996 debut <i>We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge</i>, culminating
    in the nearly flawless, off-kilter pop of last year's <i>Streethawk: A Seduction</i>. On that album, Bejar
    found a perfect balance between tight acoustic guitars and looser electric rock, and none of it sounded the
    least bit deliberate or sloppy.</p><p>
<i>Streethawk</i>, in other words, is everything that <i>This Night</i> is not. Whereas <i>Streethawk</i>
    whipped out twelve songs in forty-four minutes, <i>This Night</i> draws fifteen songs out along an
    interminable sixty-eight minutes. Do the math. Most of the songs here are overlong, messy things.
    <i>Streethawk</i> may have been unpredictable, but it also felt as though Bejar carefully considered every
    move. <i>This Night</i>, on the other hand, feels entirely haphazard without purpose.</p><p>
    The title track that opens the album is no exception. Several uncoordinated guitars try to find each other's
    rhythm, then one takes over for some of the laziest strumming you've ever heard. Bejar enters with his
    adenoidal voice, not unlike Robyn Hitchcock's, as he sings, ""They led us on/ They said it would be yours/
    Tear down the borders, stop patrolling the shores, let us in.""</p><p>
    The lyrics are no surprise. Bejar has always been a bit enigmatic-- as often silly as he is poetic-- but his
    music always made up for the shortcomings of his odd voice and nonsensical lyrics. Here, he has no such
    bailout. The music is all confused and muddled, and largely devoid of any compelling artistry. And ""This
    Night"" is just the first of <i>many</i> songs that devolve into a jumbled, self-indulgent mess of electric
    guitars and exasperated yelping.</p><p>
    ""Holly Going Lightly"" stumbles all over itself, with all kinds of masturbatory riffing and noodling that's
    enough to give anyone 70s flashbacks. Bejar, meanwhile, sings ""should know better"" ad nauseam, and all I
    can think is, ""Tell me about it."" The same goes for the nearly eight-minute ""Hey, Snow White"", yet another
    poor attempt at a longwinded rocker a la Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse. Oddly, though, even some of the shorter
    tracks here feel equally endless.</p><p>
    All hope isn't entirely lost, though. ""Here Comes the Night"", with its melodica and chirpy background vocals,
    recalls some of the more whimsical side of earlier Destroyer. The crisp pop of ""Modern Painters"" would have
    fit nicely on <i>Streethawk</i>. And ""Goddess of Drought"", by far the best track here, consists of-- surprise!--
    just Bejar and his acoustic guitar, with quirky lines like, ""I was looking good on the day that you fell for
    the way I looked.""</p><p>
    In recording <i>This Night</i>, Bejar largely abandoned his <i>Streethawk</i> lineup, enlisting two members
    for guest spots only. The replacements are unwelcome, if only because of the final product, but I hate to
    blame anyone but Bejar himself. He reportedly left the familiar environs of Vancouver, British Columbia,
    and created <i>This Night</i> in the decidedly less tranquil city of Montréal. Let's just hope that when he
    grudgingly admits (on ""Trembling Peacock""), ""Vancouver made me, I guess it's true,"" that he hasn't sworn off
    his hometown altogether.</p></div>"|2291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2291-this-night/|4.4|Ryan Kearney

Film, television and publishing have been dabbling in
    nostalgia for the Reagan years (and of course, there's <i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i>), but as is
    often the case, the music of the era is receiving the most exhaustive re-examination. A slew of books in
    the last year or so (<i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>, <i>Fargo Rock City</i>, <i>From Joy Division to
    New Order: The True Story of Anthony H. Wilson and Factory Records</i>, to name just a few) have approached
    the 80s from a number of different angles, and the recent spike in interest in post-punk, metal, synth-pop
    and electro all speak to the period's resurgence. The musical decade that was widely considered hopelessly
    uncool six or seven years ago today provides both musicians and listeners with a deep well of inspiration.</p><p>
    
    Now comes London's venerable Soul Jazz label with this timely compilation, selected by pioneering producer
    Kurtis Mantronik, to show what the early 80s were like from the perspective of New York's club scene. I
    finally read the fantastic book <i>Last Night a DJ Saved My Life</i> a couple months ago, and it provided
    me a nice background with which to approach this compilation. According to the liner notes for <i>That's My
    Beat</i>, Kurtis Mantronik was a regular at David Mancuso's Loft, hung with Larry Levan at the Paradise
    Garage, and could be seen at Bronx parties with the likes of Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash. If
    this is true, Mantronik was at ground zero for three different music genres (disco, house and hip-hop), so
    he would seem uniquely qualified to select early 80s club tracks.</p><p>
    
    And he delivers, for the most part, delivering the ""old skool hip-hop, electro and disco"" promised on the
    record's cover. <i>That's My Beat</i> really is fun, funky and educational from start to finish. As is to
    be expected, the older rap material is the iffiest stuff here. The singsong Sugarhill style is difficult to
    listen to now, as rhyming has grown increasingly sophisticated with each passing year. Jimmy Spicer's
    ""Super Rhymes"" is the worst offender in this regard, coming across as little more than another post-""Rapper's
    Delight"" bandwagon hop (it's got Chic's ""Good Times"" beat). Almost compensating is Funky 4 Plus 1's ""That's
    the Joint"", the tune that provided sample inspiration for the Dust Brothers on <i>Paul's Boutique</i> (it has
    both the ""it's the joint"" from ""Shake Your Rump"" and ""ain't you very proud to be an MC"" from ""Shadrach"") and
    formed the template for the Jurassic 5, for good or ill. The nine-minute playing time is something of a
    problem, as it was for so many singles early in the twelve-inch era, but the sunny mood and energy of the
    track make it enjoyable even at that length.</p><p>
    
    The electro side of the equation is covered nicely by Yellow Magic Orchestra's undeniably great instrumental
    ""Computer Games"", which mixes vintage Atari bleeps with a killer beat and Eastern melodies. Art of Noise's
    ""Beatbox"" is a bit more dated (the lumbering, gated drum sound is from Phil Collins' production manual), but
    the sample-heavy structure packs one great hook after another.  And the sleek, streamlined electro-beat of
    Visage's ""Pleasure Boys"" is the stuff of break record dreams.</p><p>
    
    For my money, the lesser-known disco cuts are the most surprising and enjoyable tracks here. The bass
    propulsion, powerful vocal, and terrifically lascivious lyrics of Suzy Q's ""Get on Up and Do It Again"" mark
    it as dancefloor anthem to be reckoned with, and Machine's ""There But for the Grace of God"", a punchy,
    melodramatic tune that could have been a roller-rink smash, is a classic example of disco as it moved away
    from studio sophistication toward a more synthetic sound. The compilation is a success, even though you'll
    find yourself grinning a little at the goofiness occasionally. Next time you find yourself wondering why
    Sasha Frere-Jones continues to jabber on about how great early-80s New York was, put on <i>That's My Beat</i>.</p></div>"|5094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5094-thats-my-beat/|8.2|Mark Richardson

In tonight's installment,
    Professor Grubbs will attempt to stretch the formula that carried 2000's worthwhile <i>The Spectrum Between</i>
    one step further, by adding glitchy electronics to his trademark flashy acoustic guitar stylings and
    alternately whimsical and impenetrable lyrics.</p><p>
    For <i>Rickets &amp; Scurvy</i>, Grubbs has enlisted quite a number of insanely talented individuals-- drummer
    John McEntire, who chews up polyrhythms like they were Polly-O string cheese, undisputed lord and master of
    exotic punctuation and jazz guitar Noël Akchoté, veteran producer and charming Frenchman Nicolas Vernhes,
    and the much-lauded electronic duo Matmos.</p><p>
    Whether you rock out Hanukkah-style to the Silver Jews' <i>American Water</i> or regularly pretend not to
    be at all disappointed with Björk's <i>Vespertine</i>, odds are somebody who plays on this album has had a
    hand in another album that you love very, very deeply.  If not, that's still going to be the case after a
    run through <i>Rickets &amp; Scurvy</i>.  See, <i>The Spectrum Between</i> not only had a core of melody,
    structure, and intimacy supporting its more adventurous elements, but its flourishes of drums, horns, and
    electric guitars meshed seamlessly with Grubbs' songwriting.  <i>Rickets &amp; Scurvy</i>, however, suffers
    from a double-dose of disappointment-- the songs themselves aren't nearly as compelling as those on <i>The
    Spectrum Between</i>, and the nonessential elements of the songs seem... well, even less essential.</p><p>
    Which is not, by any means, to say that <i>Rickets &amp; Scurvy</i> is bereft of value.  As far as it may stray
    from the focused and intimate nucleus of <i>The Spectrum Between</i>, this disc is still anchored by Grubbs' unique talents as
    a guitarist and lyricist.  Within the first minute of ""Transom"", with its complex plucked guitar figures and
    casually delivered, noun-intensive lyrics, Grubbs has worked his way comfortably into his own stylistic
    niche.  Yet, although the record is marked by the presence of a slew of known innovators (Grubbs himself
    included), it never really pushes any envelopes, opting instead to simply add more layers to the formulae
    that Grubbs has utilized in previous outings.  He flirts with heavier sounds (""Pinned to the Spot"") and has
    two electronic interludes provided by Matmos, but the musical core never sees any kind of renovation that
    isn't strictly aesthetic.</p><p>
    This wouldn't even be such a problem if the songs on <i>Rickets &amp; Scurvy</i> were as strong as they were on
    <i>The Spectrum Between</i>, but the quality of the vocal melodies and the guitar work here just isn't up
    to par.  Grubbs explored the more epic, meandering and experimental side of his songwriting on the
    banjo-centric <i>The Thicket</i>, and then focused in on melody and simplicity for <i>The Spectrum Between</i>.
    On both of those records, the bells and whistles provided by guest musicians engaged and enhanced Grubbs'
    songwriting.  Here, they do nothing to deeply flesh out the songs, and Grubbs' intricately plucked guitar
    lines and laidback vocal delivery just aren't constructed as elegantly as they have been on previous outings.
    This record is absolutely overflowing with talent-- but without songs strong enough to support the gifted
    roster, <i>Rickets &amp; Scurvy</i> never manages to rise above ""decent"".</p></div>"|3582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3582-rickets-scurvy/|6.4|Matt LeMay

    and mimicry (Scorsese, Cassavetes, and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece.
    Western Keys frontman Ben Dickey is also a heart-barfing amalgam of influences and mimicry (Oberst, Brock,
    and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece. Anderson's recent relationship-centric
    film <i>Punch Drunk Love</i> manages to be overwrought as it underreaches, but it also offers a zesty
    acknowledgement of the mysteries we are to ourselves. Dickey's new relationship-centric <i>Damage</i> EP
    also under-overs, but the project is in sore need of mystery.</p><p>
    
    Hailing from Austin, Texas, where the self-mythologizing scene was supposed to be bifurcated into the dusty
    middle-aged singer/songwriter in a button-up shirt camp and the Roky Erickson/Daniel Johnston
    amenable-nutjob/aberration-prodigy camp, Western Keys is an exciting proposition, the rare nephew of Uncle
    Tupelo that propels rather than deflates. The four-piece band's debut throws down a warm, seven-track
    country-then-rock-then-punk-then-pop sampler, a gourmet smorgasbord crammed into a kindergarten snack pack.
    Homesick keyboards lead into humbly exquisite brush drums. Meandering steel guitars give way to slaughterhouse
    indie-rock solos (this whisper/kaboom tactic makes ""Driver Denies"" one of the top sneak-up-on-you jams of
    the season). Think heavy-pastoral. Think rock-out-with-your-flock-out.</p><p>
    
    But hell, who are these people? Are they R.E.M. getting carjacked by Yo La Tengo outside of a That Dog yard
    sale (""Become You"")? Are they the keepers of the Desaparecidos' missing track (""Please Rock"")? Are they
    Appendix Out's warbly asses premeditating their quivers-n-mumbles-n-wails, but grounded in love-doom (""Free"")?
    Are they a dumber, pre-pubescent Jonathan Richman crooning about how ""all my friends/ And my best friend/
    Sleeps with all my fucking girlfriends,"" as if the line were a comedically earnest epic message of global
    insight (""Laughter"")? Or is this just <i>Pinkerton</i>-era Weezer and pouty Matt Pond PA teaming up in a
    suburban basement?</p><p>
    
    Tread patiently: Dickey's voice is initially unforgivable on the leadoff track, so torture-posed and nasal
    that <i>Drainage</i> seemed like a better title, and the shimmer/crunch production suggested that the dread genre
    of emo-fi was being born. Very soon, though, Dickey gets to yellin' and the band gets to shining-- not that
    they entirely shed their sense of preciousness. One could argue that <i>Damage</i> is juvenile and microcosmic
    in the best way, but these folks could use some more expansive lyrics to avoid seeming mired in prolonged
    adolescence. ""I don't love you anymore"" this and ""it's over"" that, Western Keys could apply its impressively
    shrugged-off harmonies to more than emotional dandruff. Dickey's band perpetuates the conundrum of the
    Americana: does that word connote music that is vast/universal or solipsistic/self-interested? Probably
    both, if that genre includes both Bob Dylan and Ryan Adams. Let's hope Western Keys evolves beyond their
    awkward Kirk Cameron stage fast, because they might be onto something big.</p></div>"|8636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8636-damage-ep/|7.0|William Bowers

You've made a sale at Half.com!</p><p>You have until Tuesday 25 October 05:00 PM EST to confirm this sale. Otherwise, the order will be canceled,     which would really be in the buyer's best interest. He obviously didn't read your review of 2000's <em>Damon &amp;     Naomi with Ghost</em>, which is the studio basis for the tour album he has just agreed to purchase. In any case,     upon confirmation, you are required to ship this order on the next business day, even if you think the buyer     is foolish. Please follow the four easy steps below to confirm the order and complete this unfortunate sale.</p>
<p>If you have already confirmed this order please disregard this message. If you haven't confirmed this order,     you still have time to spare the buyer his hard-earned cash. Perhaps remind him of how disappointed you were     that Ghost did not figure more prominently in <em>Damon &amp; Naomi with Ghost</em>, that Damon and Naomi, who     comprised two-thirds of seminal 80s drift-rockers Galaxie 500, have been like a sailboat without a sail     since venturing off as a twosome, that Ghost was the anchor they needed, but that they never allowed the     entrancing folk collective below deck.</p>
<p>1) Confirm the Order</p>
<p>TO CONFIRM ALL ITEMS IN THIS ORDER: Simply reply to this e-mail without altering the subject line. E-mail     confirmations are processed automatically. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO READ OR RESPOND TO ANY COMMENTS OR INFORMATION     INCLUDED IN YOUR REPLY, SO STOP E-MAILING US ABOUT HOW A BUYER SHOULD REALLY KNOW BETTER THAN TO BUY YOUR     USED CD'S, WHICH MORE OFTEN THAN NOT ARE ALBUMS YOU PANNED AS A CRITIC FOR PITCHFORKMEDIA.COM.</p>
<p>ORDER CONTENTS:<br/> 1) Damon &amp; Naomi on tour with Michio Kurihara of Ghost (on guitar)<br/> <em>Live in San Sebastian</em><br/> Condition: Very good<br/> Quality of music and video: Not so good<br/> Price: $4.99</p>
<p>2) Package the Order</p>
<p>Be sure to package the item correctly. In your heart, you may want to just give the CD away, but remember     that just because you didn't like the album doesn't mean the buyer won't either. If he heard <em>Damon and     Naomi with Ghost</em> and liked it, then perhaps he may like this live CD as well. Then again, maybe not.     After all, the songs here are even thinner than on their airy studio effort. And the bonus DVD video tour     diary is boring for all but friends, family and hardcore fans, given the intentionally blurred concert     footage and extended close-ups of cafeteria mystery meat.</p>
<p>Address the package to:<br/> Dean Wareham<br/> 500 Galaxie Ave<br/> Boston MA 02135</p>
<p>3) Mail the Package</p>
<p>YOU ARE REQUIRED TO MAIL THIS PACKAGE NO LATER THAN THE NEXT BUSINESS DAY FOLLOWING CONFIRMATION. Failure     to comply may result in loss of shipping allowance, poor seller rating, or suspension of seller privileges.     Complying, on the other hand, may result in a disappointed buyer. He will listen to the gutting of already     thin, though decent songs such as ""Judah and the Maccabees"" and ""The Great Wall"". Kurihara's electric     contributions sharpen up older Damon &amp; Naomi favorites such as ""Eye of the Storm"" or of 2000's ""I Dreamed     of the Caucasus"", but his offerings aren't enough to save the sinking ship.</p>
<p>* Shipping Costs:<br/> Half.com will reimburse you the cost of shipping the items listed above based upon the Half.com Shipping     Policy. You probably wouldn't sell this CD otherwise, would you? An idiot from the audience says it all     when he yells, at the end of ""Turn on the Century"", ""I forgot to get high!"" Damon Krukowski replies, ""That's     exactly why we wrote that song,"" and he may be joking, but you fear he is not.</p>
<p>4) Get Paid!</p>
<p>Sellers receiving payments by direct deposit will be paid twice monthly. It seems almost unfair to get paid     for something not only that was free, but that you discouraged others from purchasing. But why not? This     live effort is a song to the siren, indeed: some of these tracks sound like pleasant, lofty vocal tracks     and nothing else. The music is so insignificant at times as to fade entirely from the listener's consciousness,     and the lyrical spirituality is as forced as ground animal parts through a sausage maker. Think of the Cliffs     Notes version of Homer's <em>Odysseus</em>, or of the Sunday choir at your local Christian church.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, thanks for selling your crappy stuff at Half.com.  Have a great day!</p>

You
    know the kind: 220 second-rate synth voices, several drum kits, and an auto
    rhythm section that could cover everything from ""piano waltz"" to ""hip-hop"" and
    back to ""slow rock."" Besides learning the theme to the Young and the Restless
    on that keyboard, one of my favorite elementary school pastimes was experimenting
    with the sound effects. Of course, I was seven, so I thought musical innovation
    consisted of playing ""London Bridge"" on the ""crickets"" setting. When fourth grade
    came around, I even entered a city-wide contest with an emotional improvised
    piece entitled ""Life Before Death"", which consisted of alarm sounds interspersed
    between melodramatic minor-key pipe organ lines backed by a three-piece jazz
    combo. Back in my day, it was all about the juxtaposition of disparate elements.</p><p>
    But now in the age that disowns Casio (if you would consider Stephen Merritt the
    spokesperson for an age), synths and samplers are put to much more serious uses.
    Man, did you see that Linkin Park video where they're playing on that statue of
    Buddha? That synth player dude is seriously into it-- he moves like a madman!
    Can't cage him! Do you think he really puts that much emotion into all that
    button pressing?</p><p>
    But I digress. Spinning on my stereo at the moment is Stereo Total's latest
    (that's ""tow-tall"" if you ever want to say it out loud), a band that bridges
    synth-pop with kitsch-rock and dangerously brings me back to my Casio days, as
    well as reminding me very much of Serge Gainsbourg. <i>Musique Automatique</i>,
    Total's fourth full-length, finds the half-French/half-German duo of FraxE7oise
    Cactus and Brezel Göring ditching the premeditation and kicking out the
    trigger-happy sampling behind their deceivingly simplistic pop approach to
    songwriting.</p><p>
    Lyrics on this record are sung in French, German, English, and Turkish, and love
    is their common focal point: love of the radio, love of robots, love of French
    highways, love of love, and so on.  Total's arrangements are built around Cactus'
    infectious pop melodies, with accompaniment provided by guitars and live drums
    covered by synthesizer, pocketsampler, and drumatix (I'm guessing that's some
    kind of archaic drum machine).</p><p>
<i>Musique Automatique</i> opens with ""Automatic Music"", a bouncy number centering
    around a call-and-response between Cactus and Göring that plays off the suffix
    ""-ique"": ""La musique/ Automatique/ La musique/ Nostalgique/ La musique/
    Pathétique/ La musique/ Chaotique."" The two verses of the song-- sung by Göring
    about sound traveling through the soundsystem to the ears of the listener-- kick
    in with a folky guitar scale fill-in, defying the synth-pop of the rest of the
    track. But unlike my ""Life Before Death"" experiment, this juxtaposition is
    crazily successful.</p><p>
    The second track, ""L'Amour \xC0 3"", is decidedly closer to radio-friendly pop, but
    doesn't drop the kitschy synth.  The lyrics, again in French, sing about the love
    of three-way love (from bit translations in the liner notes): ""I know it's
    hippieshit/ But I say it loud/ With the three of us/ I love it."" ""Wir Tanzen im
    4-Eck"", the first of the tracks in German, and also the first of five covers
    included, is built around Cactus' sampled vocals structured into an extremely
    infectious chant. ""Forever 16"", in English, is the first track dominated by live
    instrumentation with bleeps thrown in as ornaments, and it begs reference to the
    start/stop nature of ""BBC"" from the first <i>Austin Powers</i> flick.</p><p>
    The sixteen tracks of <i>Musique Automatique</i> (including a Turkish reiteration
    of ""Forever 16"" and an English rendition of ""L'Amour \xC0 3"") keep with the exotic
    linguo-hopping and synth-bopping, and manages never to get tired or annoying. In
    fact, I thought that I could never have this much fun with synth-pop because of
    its stereotypic banality.  But Stereo Total has made me learn to love, among
    other things, fun loving.</p></div>"|7490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7490-musique-automatique/|8.0|Christopher F. Schiel

""Pivotal"", probably,
    but in a way that had as much to do with <i>Cold as Ice</i> as with <i>Nevermind</i>. And in London, Saint
    Etienne released their first self-penned single with Sarah Cracknell on it; it was called ""Nothing Can Stop
    Us"", and that was true. Bob Stanley has described what they were doing as ""ridiculously easy""-- here, just a
    paste-up collage of sprightly groove, pop vocal, fluttering reeds, and God's own harmonica-- and that ease
    was exactly the point: their grace was effortless, the equivalent of a thrift-store frock charming enough to
    make everyone else look idiotic.</p><p>
    
    But who can keep that going? Forget knighthood: the fact that Saint Etienne's career had an upward trajectory
    from ""Nothing Can Stop Us"" is the sort of miracle the Vatican should be looking into. The sacred relic is
    1994's <i>Tiger Bay</i>-- after which the game was up, temporarily, and Cracknell/Stanley/Wiggs retreated
    behind a pile of rarities, remixes, and singles collections, working out where to go. When they reemerged
    it was from Sweden, where they'd assembled a band and whipped together a swinging miniskirt pop collection
    equal parts Dusty Springfield and the Cardigans: this was <i>Good Humour</i>, about which one could mostly
    say, ""Good to have you back."" Next came collaboration with Sean O'Hagan and To Rococo Rot on <i>The Sound
    of Water</i>, the sort of record one's glad a band does but a bit worried they might keep doing.</p><p>
    
    And now <i>Finisterre</i>, ""the end of the earth""-- a philosophical bid back toward the ridiculously easy.
    L'Etienne seem relaxed, carefree, unconcerned with direction, and <i>Finisterre</i>'s singles are like
    watching a much-loved old dog chasing rabbits again. ""Action"", the first, layers a smoothed-out house throb
    with rushing acoustic guitar and Cracknell's most convincingly soaring vocal since ""He's on the Phone"". The
    other, ""Soft like Me"", is going to find trouble with American ears, given epidemic irrational fears about
    British people rapping (not to mention talk of ""touching the universe"" with ""feminine energy""), but I'm all
    for it-- guest rapper Wildflower has a subtle, MC Lyte sort of strength in her voice that sits well next to
    Cracknell's sunny choruses.</p><p>
<i>Finisterre</i> also finds a band known for their cut-and-paste raiding of pop's past pillaging their own
    career. ""Stop and Think It Over"" has <i>Good Humour</i> written all over it-- it's just the sort of soulful,
    piano-led crooner Burt Bacharach would have put together for Dionne Warwick. The instrumental ""Language Lab""
    runs from English pastoral to Sean O'Hagan's sunnily orchestral territory, and ""Shower Scene""-- another side
    of ""Action""-- shows off the processing tracks picked up from the other end of <i>The Sound of Water</i>. The
    group's new kick is electro, a sound they're well suited to grapple with. ""New Thing"" is the big success on
    this front, pairing a grainy Italo-disco synth throb with a song that's still all Etienne; ""Amateur"", on the
    other hand, is a bit too reminiscent of the ""sure, but didn't you used to be brilliant?"" band of the past
    few years.</p><p>
    
    The trick is that Saint Etienne records are in fact not all about style and sonics: like all great pop records,
    they're about the emotions we don't get to share, about perfectly articulating the passion of someone's everyday
    life. The big comeback on <i>Finisterre</i>'s part is that they're tugging those strings again, confidently.
    The highlight is ""B92"", where a sly synthetic strut and determined hook load the ""music is our weapon"" trope
    into a triple-reference refrain: ""The boys are back in town/ And nothing can stop us now/ This is our wall
    of sound."" These moments are all over the record: in the plaintive chorus of ""Action"", in the clear-eyed
    momentum of ""Shower Scene"". If there's any criticism to be made it's only that the group doesn't let some
    tracks run free enough to back that up: ""Action"" and ""New Thing"" are just begging for the bigger kick drums
    that would turn them into flat-out stompers. We'll be waiting for the remixes.</p><p>
<i>Finisterre</i> closes with its title track, whose lilting chorus is a better summation than I can manage:
    ""Finisterre-- to tear it down, and start again."" Around it comes exactly what Saint Etienne are best at--
    the soft-touch pop groove, the plush arrangement, and Cracknell talking, as ever, about details so local and
    personal they seem almost embarrassing to address on a record: ""There are too many bands that look lame,
    sound tame: I believe in Electrelane... I'm so bored with the myth of common sense. I believe in Donovan
    over Dylan, love over cynicism."" Saint Etienne have been ""back"" before, but this time-- this time it sounds
    like they're really back.</p></div>"|6974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6974-finisterre/|7.6|Nitsuh Abebe

Stephen Merritt, I mean.  He was last seen in an East Village dive bar, martini in
    one hand, rhyming dictionary in the other.  Can't really blame him for keeping a low profile, though; after
    dropping an epic achievement like <i>69 Love Songs</i> on the unsuspecting public, you'd take a break, too.
    While the Magnetic Fields have been recently plucked out of the draft by superlabel-in-the-making Nonesuch,
    Merritt's yet to release a follow-up under his highest-profile name, choosing instead to focus on scoring
    films, farewell live performances of <i>69</i>, and writing a musical with stock accordionist and children's
    author Daniel Handler.</p><p>
    
    Oh yeah, and also releasing another collaboration with Christopher Ewan under the sacrilicious <i>nom de
    plume</i> of Future Bible Heroes.  Like the Heroes' last full-length, 1997's <i>Memories of Love</i>,
    <i>Eternal Youth</i> has Ewan electronically arranging songs co-written with Merritt, with vocals added by
    Magnetic Fields drummer/occasional singer Claudia Gonson.  And also like its predecessor, <i>Eternal Youth</i>
    feels like more of a lackluster stopgap than equal-footing sidecar for Merritt's songcraft, a frustrating
    teaser from the Merritt portfolio of aliases.</p><p>
    
    Part of the problem seems to lie with Ewan's arrangements, electro-pop that no doubt endears him to the
    equally 80s-fixated Merritt.  While Merritt's electronic backings often sound like dancefloor anthems for
    the club inside his head, Ewan's slicker touch has the tendency to present the songs like <i>actual</i>
    club anthems, losing a lot of the intimacy of the Magnetic Fields' productions.  Fair enough, but perhaps
    not the wisest of approaches given Merritt's flair for clever wordiness, Tin Pan Alley-style melodicism,
    and Gonson's voice.</p><p>
    
    Gonson's occasional microphone duties on <i>69 Love Songs</i> were a treat, as Merritt's songs tend to sound
    good delivered by the opposite gender.  But as the sole vocalist on <i>Eternal Youth</i> (Merritt's Cash-ian
    baritone sits this one out), the pleasure of her slightly disinterested, sorta flat tone wears before long.
    Irony being dead and all (or so I'm told), the detached vocal is an endangered species, and Gonson's throws
    a warm blanket over the romantics of ""No River"", dampens space oddity ""Doris Day the Earth Stood Still"",
    and creates the wrong kind of bedroom voice on the smooth-operating ""A Thousand Lovers in a Day"".</p><p>
    
    Merritt, meanwhile, remembers to bring his usual lyrical tricks (""I'd rather be a queen when the rooks take
    wing than be losing your affection,"" for instance), but seems to use a lot of his C-list melodies.  For a
    Next Wave of Song-certified man known for penning instant-timeless melodies, it's disappointing to sit
    through stiffs like ""Find an Open Window"" or ""Kiss Me Only With Your Eyes"" that don't even come close to
    taking a spot on one's in-head playlist.  ""I'm a Vampire"" is pristine danceable camp and ""From a Dying Star""
    is a catchy/haunting continuation of the extraterrestrial theme, but on most of these tracks, Merritt sounds
    too much like he's phoning it in; ""The World is a Disco Ball"" could be a Magnetic Fields sendup on some
    forthcoming collection of indie rock interpretations by Weird Al (for which working titles would certainly
    include <i>No Al-Ternative</i>, <i>My Bloody Alentine</i> and <i>Al's Tomorrow Parties</i>).</p><p>
    
    So the spotlight's on Ewan, who fills <i>Eternal Youth</i> with serviceably average synthetic-pop dioramas.
    The album is weighed down with sub-minute interlude filler, some of which (i.e. the almost-Timbaland-style
    skittery-strings of ""Viennese Lift"") are more interesting than the full-length backdrops, but which still
    kill what turtle-ish momentum the song cycle manages to establish.  From the evidence presented on <i>Eternal
    Youth</i>, Ewan sounds mostly like the bad influence kid-next-door to Merritt, pushing him back from the
    slightly more organic sound of recent fare towards his (weaker) bleached-out keyboard symphony/guest vocalist
    early days.  Maybe he's just taking some practice laps before turning on the Magnetic Field generator again,
    but regardless, non-completists are better off waiting for the real deal.</p></div>"|3253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3253-eternal-youth/|5.5|Rob Mitchum

    emocore. Thus, in accordance with the Law of Recovering Emoists, I am instinctively skeptical of any lyrical
    mention of the months of the year. Actually, it makes me cringe. Invoking the calendar often reeks of
    sentimentality, and sentimentality is like strychnine: it's only ingestible in small doses.</p><p>
    
    So you can understand my trepidation in appraising <i>August</i>, the sophomore effort from the Portland,
    Oregon-based five-piece The Standard. Add to this unfortunate album title the bleak, sepia-toned landscapes
    throughout the packaging and you've got yourself a reviewer who's forced to slap himself and say, ""Objectivity,
    dammit!"" before ever pushing the play button.</p><p>
    
    At first, though, my suspicions were confirmed with the opener ""A Year of Seconds"". Over a plaintive acoustic
    guitar, Tim Putnam sings softly, ""I've been walking on pins and needles since you are not around/ I have been
    sweating like ice on fire because you are not here now."" But then The Standard changes their pitch up. A
    fuzzed-out keyboard barges in, accompanied by atmospheric whirring and stomping drums.  And this was just a
    prelude.  ""The Five-Factor Model"" goes <i>straight</i> to the keyboards, only this time they're beeping and
    ringing as though lifted from a 70s sci-fi flick. These notes become the undeniable hook when a jacked
    drumbeat kicks in, taking the song on a stop/start rush into post-punk territory. Later, blazing guitars
    soar together like I haven't heard since <i>The Bends</i>. Putnam's voice, meanwhile, is all jitters as he
    spits out blocks of words that, to my relief, don't make much sense at all.</p><p>
    
    This alternation between slow, reflective tracks and unpredictable, bone-vibrating rock continues for the
    entirety of the album. If The Standard ever decide to hold an election on the matter, perhaps as a non-binding
    ballot question, then I'd like throw my support right now to the rock. I can't imagine it was lolling numbers
    like the piano-driven ballads ""Angelicate"" and ""The Quiet Bar"" that got them on tour with Wire and Clinic.
    Rather, I'd guess they were chosen for, say, ""Behind the Screens"", with its raw keyboards, tumbling drums
    and unexpected shifts.</p><p>
    
    It's not that The Standard are terrible at the slow stuff. They're just a little, well, standard in that
    department. ""Paper"", for instance, skips along on a raining xylophone and brushed drums, clearly taking its
    cues from Tortoise and Gastr del Sol. ""Tree Line"" and ""Bells to the Boxer"", meanwhile, are pleasant, though
    not particularly noteworthy until, minutes into each, The Standard's slumbering electric guitars rip things
    wide open.</p><p>
    
    The problem here is best exemplified by Putnam's voice. Simply put, his larynx is thrashed. It has been
    chewed up, spit out, and surgically reattached. So, unsurprisingly, it isn't well-suited for hushed singing.
    But what baffles me is this: If Putnam loves rocking out so much that he's willing to permanently damage his
    voice box, then why even bother with anything else? Next time, I say, go full tilt, and please, whatever you
    do, don't look back.</p></div>"|7458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7458-august/|7.1|Ryan Kearney

I miss political rock music.  Probably it's out there and I'm looking in all the
    wrong places.  But I know this: Indie rock, always one of the great dissenting voices of American (and
    British) underground media, has gone virtually silent.  In the 1980s, this music was rife with
    anti-government sentiment, from Black Flag to The Minutemen to Gang of Four to The Dead Kennedys to Elvis
    Costello.  But with the ushering in of ambivalent slacker-rock, political messages became passé and we
    grew steadily more tolerant of Washington's silent plots.  Conspiracy theories soon became kitsch, and
    now, in the aftermath of <i>X-Files</i> geekdom and September 11th pacifism, there are few better ways
    to get hipster eyes rolling than by questioning authority.  What perfect timing: We've lethargically
    accepted that Washington is brutally malevolent just as our most wicked administration yet has come to
    power.</p><p>
    Yay, the most political rock band going right now is Canadian!  Thanks, America.  Granted, their message
    is pretty ham-fisted, what with those didactic, overbearing manifestos and ominous woodcuts of skull-faced
    forefathers chopping off peoples' hands.  But Godspeed is at least putting forth some kind of an effort,
    which is more than can be said for most.  I mean, I dig a lot of music, and songs about our girlfriends and
    our scenes and hating our parents are fine-- sometimes great, even transcendent.  But when that's all there
    is, we have a problem.</p><p>
    So, upfront, that's why I respect Godspeed You! Black Emperor.  I just wish their approach was more effective.
    For one, they're an instrumental band whose political message is carried out through vague and overwrought
    packaging which merely hints at a greater ""something.""  And their latest offering, <i>Yanqui U.X.O.</i>, is
    vague as ever.  We're told that ""09-15-00"", one of the album's song titles, ""is ariel sharon surrounded by
    1,000 israeli soldiers marching on al-haram ash-sharif&amp; provoking another intifada.""  How?  The music is
    simple atmospheric orchestration with no agenda of its own, and as easily reflects a DMV waitroom as
    Palestinian uprising.  And on the back of the sleeve, we're treated to a six-degrees-of-bomb-makers, where
    Tomahawk cruise missile manufacturers Raytheon Industries are traced, through a twisted labyrinth of
    corporations to the recording industry's major labels.  Briefly: Just because you have a friend who knows
    an auto mechanic who worked on a car owned by a guy who was the gaffer on the set of <i>She's Having a
    Baby</i> does not mean you know Kevin Bacon.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <i>Yanqui</i>'s tenebrous finger-pointing isn't its only shortcoming.  The band has taken
    its naysayers' gripes to heart and done away with those moody vocal snippets that not only hinted at deeper
    protest, but also jolted you awake just as your mind began to wander.  And where the hell is the undercurrent?
    The two discs of 2000's <i>Lift Your Skinny Fists</i> used Godspeed's sweeping, emotional übersuites as a
    basic centerpiece to the bizarre ambient textures and noise projects which backed them.  Meanwhile,
    <i>Yanqui U.X.O.</i> strips the group to their essentials which, as it just so happens, are not quite
    essential enough.  Ideas are scarce, too-- where <i>Skinny Fists</i> would erupt without warning into a
    scorching Satriani-esque solo (""Cancer Towers on Holy Road Hi-Way""), the tracks on <i>Yanqui</i> are
    content to continue building to bored, satiated endings we can see coming 20 minutes in advance.  Couldn't
    we have some venting?  Are we frustrated or just dramatic?</p><p>
    Worse: The record is consumed by a painfully glacial pace.  Each song plods endlessly onward toward an
    inevitable conclusion with no revelation in store for the poor listener, who can only endure these
    disc-filling five tracks in the hopes that, maybe, just maybe, that one glorious moment will arrive and
    redeem the interminable wait with a display of power so towering and majestic that it in itself will be a
    $12 experience.  It doesn't.  Once, at the end of ""Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls,"" the band comes close with
    a triumphant burst of cinematic melody and Efrim's wailing screwdriver'd guitar.  The quarter-hour denouement
    that precedes it is a long road to travel, though, and with this record's production difficulties, you're
    slogging through the mud every step of the way.</p><p>
    See, the importance of strong production on a record like this cannot be exaggerated, and I place much of
    the blame for <i>Yanqui</i> failure to impact on Steve Albini's shoulders.  Last year, he turned Mogwai's
    similar-minded <i>My Father, My King</i> into a raging, five-headed superbeast with precision micing and
    mixing that brought the music's strongest elements to the fore, resulting in a speaker-rattling detonation
    of pristine strength.  <i>Yanqui</i> is no recreation, or even approximation, of that tunneling force.
    Here, perhaps because of the number of instruments at hand, or maybe because of the insane over-reverbing,
    all of the instruments (save the ever-present martial drums) blend together into a kind of murky concordance,
    often making distinguishing the guitars from the violins an impossibility.</p><p>
    What we're left with, then, is the skeleton of an incredibly original band whose once-driving conviction
    and determination has been sapped by sluggishness and a lack of invention.  It doesn't help that they've
    spawned countless imitators and saturated the market with uniform side projects.  Or that their radical
    politics, which could be such a defining attribute, are relegated to cardboard inserts.  Or that they just
    keep doing the same thing over and over and over and over again, hoping for a different result.  Someone
    tell Godspeed that orchestras play <i>all kinds</i> of music and that uprising can take other forms in
    music than apexes conveying abandonment, loss or apocalypse.  Revolt, as I see it, is a beautiful thing,
    but not this beautiful.</p></div>"|3487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3487-yanqui-uxo/|5.6|Ryan Schreiber

    three.  Nah, besides Folds, drummer Darren Jessee, and bassist Robert Sledge, there were two invisible
    members equally integral to the BFF sound: Folds' considerable ego, and his almost equally considerable
    songwriting talent.  Argue if you must, but anyone who goes the eponymous route with his band, and then
    plays every single instrument on his solitary efforts, has got to be sporting heavy self-love.</p><p>
    
    The famed ego is obviously at play here on the cheekily named <i>Ben Folds Live</i>, the take-home version
    of his truly solo man-vs-piano US jaunt from earlier this year.  The question for prospective buyers, then,
    would be whether this ego trip obscures or potentiates the songcraft.  It's a battle for Folds' rubber soul
    that sets the old seesaw of Good Idea/Bad Idea a-tippin' for the live album.</p><p>
    
    Good Idea: Narcissism or no, the stripped-down nightclub setup of Ben/piano/audience makes for a live album
    that's more than just greatest hits + cheering.  It's interesting to hear what tracks from the BFF catalog
    hold up sans rhythm section: ""Best Imitation of Myself"" defends its place near the top of the Folds fakebook,
    while ""The Last Polka"" manages to preserve all the marital meltdown urgency of the full-band workup.</p><p>
    
    Bad Idea: Let us not forget the talents of Mssrs. Jessee and Sledge, however, who, despite not getting their
    name in the top billing, were pretty upstanding musicians and harmonists.  Versions of ""One Angry Dwarf and
    200 Hundred Solemn Faces"" or formerly string-soaked tracks ""Jane"" and ""Narcolepsy"" feel amputated without
    the originators.</p><p>
    
    Good Idea: To fill the holes, Folds turns to some good old-fashioned audience participation, conducting his
    audience in recreating the spine-tingling fanfare bridge of ""Army"".  The song wouldn't work without it.
    Sounds good, it's fun, Dr. Peppers all around.</p><p>
    
    Bad Idea: Not so for the audience singalong ""aaaahhhhs"" on ""Not the Same"", a lobotomized chorus that brings
    to mind the brainwashed devotees on that creepy Dashboard Confessional <i>Unplugged</i> session.</p><p>
    
    Good Idea: Peppering the setlist with obscurities, like the too-rare-for-the-rarity-comp oldie ""Silver
    Street"", the recent b-side ""One Down"", or the severely underrated ""Emaline"".</p><p>
    
    Bad Idea: Leaving the rest heavy with songs from the ho-hum <i>Rockin' the Suburbs</i>.  Sure, Benjamin's
    showing off his independence from his days with the Five, but songs like hyperglycemic United In-Flight
    Channel favorite ""The Luckiest"" don't hold up in the lineup next to the early material (enjoyable Jon
    Cougar Pianocamp snapshot ""Zak and Sara"" excepted).  Also deduct points for the inclusion of ""Brick"",
    complete with pointless rehash banter about the song's inspiration.  Anyone ever think about how Folds'
    high school girlfriend feels about being called a ""brick"" on Top 40 radio for post-abortion gloom?</p><p>
    
    Good Idea: The cover of ""Tiny Dancer"" might seem unbelievably trite in these post-<i>Almost Famous</i> times,
    never mind Folds' perennial saddle as the new Elton Joel or Billy John.  But I'll be damned if his
    straight-as-an-arrow reading of the greatest ode to Tony Danza ever written doesn't get me all gooey
    inside.</p><p>
    
    Bad Idea: But does Folds get all his cover ideas from movies?  The segue of ""Philosophy"" into Dick Dale's
    ""Miserlou"" is a bit pat, and as I over heard a necktie warrior at Bertucci's say last weekend, ""Quentin
    Tarantino is soooo five years ago, dude.""</p><p>
    
    An even battle, but the scales are tipped towards the positive by the intact Folds sense of humor that gave
    BFF's live shows a, er, sixth member?  Superfluous swearing, one of his half-impromptu, tongue-in-cheek
    concert ditties (""Rock This Bitch""), and a surprisingly on-pitch guest appearance by Cake singer John McCrea
    all provide entertaining moments.  But clowning aside, it's the intimate setting, and the attention the
    stripped-down sound draws to the strength of Folds' melodies, that makes <i>Ben Folds Live</i> a document
    for more than just the fanclub.  Better song selection might've pushed the rating higher, but a little bit
    of personality and restraint alongside the infamous ego makes the affair a bit easier to swallow.</p></div>"|3136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3136-ben-folds-live/|7.1|Rob Mitchum

    flugelhorns and miscellaneous brass guaranteed to generate some semblance of interest, or if nothing else,
    outright puzzlement.  Unfortunately, the only news breaking here is forty-minutes of bizarre, rigid soul-pop.
    Film at 11.</p><p>
    
    The Negro Problem-- who curiously feel they can get away with touting such a blatantly offensive bandname
    because one of their members is of African descent-- have slowly carved out a (miniscule) niche for themselves in the wilds of L.A. over the
    course of three albums by colliding mellow lite-soul/jazz hooks with cutesy twee-pop harmonies.  People are
    stupid.  They should realize that this hybrid is, at best, the sad approximation of a Prince/Promise Ring
    collaboration, and at worst, the textbook definition of ""unholy"".  And yet, I remain torn on my true feelings
    for this band.  On one hand, The Negro Problem have created a sound that is uniquely their own (among indie
    circles, certainly), and even managed to drag some mildly compelling grooves, kicking and screaming, by its
    toothy maw.  On the other, I can't help but feel that this sound is theirs alone because no one else
    particularly wants it.  At times, it sounds a little like 70s crap-rock a la Chicago; the rest of the time
    it sounds like 90s wuss-rock a la Hootie &amp; The Blowfish-- castrated, I might add.</p><p>
    
    With that out of the way, though, this album does have a certain smarmy, unreal charisma.  The strange mix
    of twee, jazz, and country is like watching someone get ass-impaled by a thorny branch on ""Real TV""-- it
    shouldn't be funny, but the combination of it being both unexpected and not you is a powerfully comedic
    aphrodisiac.  The first listen will grip you inexorably as your mind reels to imagine what asinine stunt The
    Negro Problem might attempt next.  Will it be a Beatlesque trip down Psych-Pop Lane like ""I'm Sebastian
    Cabot""?  Or perhaps a relaxing soul jam straight off Al B. Sure's <i>Do It 2 the Music</i> like ""Lime Green
    Sweater""?  We don't know!  But it's all good, 'cause we stop wanting to right around the fifth track, anyway.</p><p>
    
    If I could make this up, I would.  In fact, I was momentarily tempted to give this album another point for
    the lyrics alone, before thinking of you, the poor reader.  Lines like, ""Now I'm boning up on everything (At
    the center room library)/ Haven't had a bath since George was king (That is why we're acting wary),"" (sung
    in rondo!) or, ""And in time all time will be time,"" are tossed around with carefree abandon.  It completes
    the trifecta of surrealism with the deplorable self-reference of ""Is This the Single"", and more independent
    mentions of popcorn machines than you will ever hear on one CD.
    
    Like the ludicrously goofy bandname/album title combo, <i>Welcome Black</i> is often hilarious and, I will
    say with confidence, something the likes of which you are unlikely to hear anywhere else.  But as the old

    stormy weather: one during a snowshower, the other in the cold October rain.  And, well, here I am under a
    deadline and the skies that haven't been clear in days and puddles are taking the streets hostage.  If
    that's not a coincidence, I've got a hunch that the folks at Mr. Lady have gotten hold of some diabolical
    lesbian weather machine (maybe secondhand from Touch and Go, O'Neil's previous label) and pointed it right
    at me.  Because (hear me out), as it's been said many times over, a little precipitation is the perfect
    complement to the particular sort of melancholy that O'Neil has been cultivating over the course of her
    solo career, and thus the most favorable climate for a positive review...</p><p>
    
    Paranoia, you say?  This, too, is a state of mind that goes well with <i>TJO TKO</i>, which is something
    that couldn't necessarily be said about her previous work.  While her melodies have always been tricky
    upper-register wingwalks and her productions dense, it's never been this oblique or claustrophobic before.
    You would think that, after her recent brush with improv on the Dan Littleton-assisted <i>Music for a Meteor
    Shower</i>, O'Neil would be plum out of opacity.  Apparently, she's been saving up.</p><p>
    
    She's also, thank God, learned to put it to better use-- this isn't the train wreck that <i>Meteor Shower</i>
    turned out to be mainly because O'Neil chooses to use some of her formidable capacity for structuring the
    gloom.  And the fact that she expands her already eclectic instrumental repertoire even further doesn't hurt,
    either.  While her post-Rodan work has tended toward a sort of organic Appalachian gothic sound, O'Neil lets
    her mathematical side show again here, employing sharp synthesized percussion with no pretenses of humanity.</p><p>
    
    These drums hiss and slunk through the opener ""Prick"", slowly pulling you into the ice-cold guitar and vox
    arrangement.  It's bracing but oddly incomplete, changing without ever really resolving, and the next few
    songs follow its lead.  ""Welcome Back"" is a more conventional piano-based dirge, but its more interesting
    elements (the disconcerting heart-murmur drumbox beat and O'Neil's spidery guitar lines) refuse to dovetail
    completely with the rest of the song.  The all-electronic ""Juno"" introduces a Boards of Canada-esque modal
    melodic pattern that begs for a beat; when that beat enters, however, it's in a different time signature.
    All of this is delicately creepy enough to entice continued listening but not so compelling that you won't
    be pissed off if O'Neil doesn't give you some resolution, and fast.</p><p>
    
    If the album's meant to be taken as a piece, then ""I Saw 3"" would be a perfect conclusion.  This nearly
    seven-minute minuet's delicious melodic clarity clears away the fog without sacrificing sonic density;
    dissonances hover around the focal point of O'Neil's voice, intensifying and resolving in a palpable rhythm.
    Too bad it comes in the right smack in the middle of the album.  The next song, ""With Yours"", has only one
    foot in the melody, and the stark ""Bye Bye"" retreats back behind the veil again, leaving us with two obtuse
    loop-fests at the end.  You can sigh along to these on a rainy day, sure, but O'Neil rarely risks the
    directness that's needed to convey the feeling to anyone who's high and dry.  There are albums that can
    make me feel like absolute crap on a sunny day; <i>TJO TKO</i>, despite its downer charms, isn't one of
    them.</p></div>"|6002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6002-tjo-tko/|6.2|Brendan Reid

    moments amounted to much more than just giving him an outlet to unleash his
    velvet-savage croon fronting the pre-<i>Grace</i> quartet Gods &amp; Monsters, or
    helping him along with his songs.  In fact, the music for some of Buckley's
    signature tunes like ""Grace"" and ""Mojo Pin"" was almost completely composed
    by Lucas.  As the posthumous releases continue to mount for Buckley, I
    wonder if the kinds of revelations left are the ones like this that could
    as likely deflate his legacy as procure the myth.  Buckley was an artist, and
    his leftovers are being deftly distributed in a style similar to other late
    legends like John Coltrane, Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon (oddly Kurt Cobain
    has thus far not enjoyed the same extended eulogy)-- and there will doubtlessly
    come a day when only the bottom of the barrel remains.  The good news is that
    <i>Songs to No One</i> does not mark that day.</p><p>
    
    Buckley had come to New York from California in 1991 with his girlfriend and
    soon found himself in an artistic community far removed from the cutthroat
    competition of LA.  He met former Captain Beefheart guitarist Gary Lucas at
    a benefit for Buckley's late father and soon joined Lucas' rock project Gods
    &amp; Monsters.  Buckley supplied lyrics to several of Lucas' instrumentals,
    including the aforementioned pair that eventually became centerpieces of
    Buckley's only completed album.  But Gods &amp; Monsters never really got off the
    ground outside of New York, largely due to a growing tension between Buckley
    and Lucas.  When Buckley refused to sign an agreement regarding his loyalty to
    the project, they effectively called it quits.  <i>Songs to No One</i> features
    two of their songs, plus several more recorded privately by Lucas and Buckley,
    as well as a few other solo and duet performances.</p><p>
    
    The highlight of the collection, and one of the finest Buckley performances
    outside of <i>Grace</i>, is the first track, a cover of Edith Piaf's ""Hymne
    a l'Amour"".  Recorded at Lucas' residence, the track ebbs and flows on a
    mystical drone, transforming a quaint melody into an alluring raga.  The
    looped guitar figure provides just enough rhythmic structure to support
    Buckley's already stunning voice.  Lucas' soaring string-scapes supply the
    heady atmosphere, and the overall effect is not unlike something Buckley's
    dad would have committed to tape circa 1970's radical <i>Starsailor</i>.
    Similarly, the spare versions of ""Mojo Pin"" and ""Grace"" (featured twice on
    this set: once as a studio demo with band; once as a live duet) demonstrate
    that these guys had merely to find the right band and producer-- the songs
    themselves were almost fully formed.</p><p>
    
    The Gods &amp; Monsters tracks showcase the rock star barely inside Buckley, as
    both ""Cruel"" and ""Malign Fiesta (No Soul)"" forgo subtle phrasing for aggressive
    pounce.  The former track is pretty grungy, like a cross between Stone Temple
    Pilots and Buckley's own ""Eternal Life"".  Lucas' twangy lead keeps it out of the
    gutter, though even he can't salvage the peppy, sub-Jane's Addiction snort of
    the latter song.  (""You're 24 years old and still don't know which way the wind
    blows.""  Hmm.)  Fairing better is the version of ""She is Free"" with downtown
    avant-jazz group Sex Mob.  This track was constructed ""Free as a Bird""-style, with
    the band supplying their new backup to Buckley and Lucas' 1992 rehearsal tape.
    Sure, it seems a little creepy, but Sex Mob's tasteful roots-groove provides a
    smooth tapestry for Buckley's soulful strains. Similarly, Bill Frisell provides
    guitars after-the-fact to ""Satisfied Mind"".</p><p>
    
    Other than Lucas' considerable contributions, what strikes me about this set
    is Buckley's already remarkable range of expression.  Although some of the
    songs (particularly the G&amp;M; numbers) would seem ill-suited to his strengths,
    Buckley dove into each performance as if it was the only one he would ever
    give, and manages to make all of this music his own.  On the title track, an
    upbeat pop number that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Paul Simon's
    <i>Graceland</i>, Buckley implores the object of his affections to ""know this
    song for always"", yet ""show this song to no one"".  Perhaps due to the vigor
    that went into these performances (and who knows what other ones that remain),
    that last request seems impossible now.  Hopefully, any future installments
    have as much to offer.</p></div>"|990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/990-songs-to-no-one-1991-1992/|7.8|Dominique Leone

    Peter Rehberg, commonly known as Pita. The album opens with a repetitive string of bleeps punctuating a long
    chunk of silence. The second (none of the tracks have names) is a pulsating gob of low end and a high-pitched
    whirr, two loops slightly offset from one another that continue until the listener ceases to pay attention.
    Eventually, both sounds drop out, there's a minute or so of isolated clicks and echoing clangs-- and then
    more silence. The third track rides in on waves of Max/MSP-borne glory that enter distantly but soon make
    themselves much more obvious, lingering just long enough to produce an ominous vibe before fading back into
    nothingness, not unlike the behavior of a shoreline or Gilbert Gottfried.</p><p>
    
    It would seem <i>Showroom Dummies</i> has as much to do with what isn't there as with what is.  It's much
    subtler and more polite than any of Pita's previous releases, which is no doubt due to the nature of the
    recording: <i>Showroom Dummies</i> was commissioned by Grenoble avant-garde dance group DACM as a score to
    accompany their performance of the same name.</p><p>
    
    I cannot claim familiarity with DACM's work, and what little
    information I've been able to dig up has been in the form of impossibly jumbled webpages ""translated"" by
    Google from French which say ridiculous things like, ""Forts of their will to create a place of meeting and
    exchange between artistic universes a priori isolated the ones from the others.""  What I can tell you with
    reasonably certainty is that the performance involved a roomful of mannequins and six dancers posing all
    kinds of meaningful questions about the nature of perception and reality.  But DACM's part in all of this
    seems largely irrelevant, since most of us will likely never see it.</p><p>
    
    That said, the audio portion still makes for compelling listening on its own. Personally, I'd recommend
    turning up your speakers really loud and hanging out in a room across the hall. Something about the distance
    always made this music more real to me. This is indeed ambient music-- not meant to be listened to so much
    as experienced-- but not in the conventional drone sense.  In fact, it thrives on playing with your
    awareness of it.  Rather than allowing you to space it out entirely, it allows you to drift off temporarily
    before jolting you to attention, typically kicking into high gear at exactly the moment your mind starts to
    wander.</p><p>
    
    Most of these tracks are built around the repetition of phrases which are tweaked gently with each recurrence.
    The slow pacing could be seen as a problem, but Rehberg fills the silence with such a variety of interesting
    sounds, from an abstracted sine wave to a deceivingly simple beat floating around in a glitched ether to
    backwards chunks of climatic film scores punctuated with bits of prepared piano.</p><p>
    
    Granted, there are a few
    moments that veer from the standard, like track five, where an echoing kickdrum buoyed by atmospheric effects
    is overwhelmed as the background stutters, glitches out and eventually consumes everything, leaving nothing
    but a high-pitched static tone in its wake. Or the closing track which, in a garbled parody of some sort of
    typical theatrical climax, almost begins to take on the form of melody. But more often than not, it's minimal
    tones that overlap and intertwine, all on so small a scale that you'd miss it were you not paying close
    attention.</p><p>
<i>Showroom Dummies</i> may be substantially outside the norm of Pita's typically aggressive noise projects,
    but this almost makes it more valuable.  With this record, Rehberg shows he's just as effective working on
    entirely different planes where the goal is sensory manipulation rather than simple sensory overload.</p></div>"|2126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2126-showroom-dummies/|8.0|David M. Pecoraro

    supergroup.  When he's on, Blueprint's voice wraps around beats with an aggressive elasticity reminiscent
    of a young, hungry Del, utilizing clever wordplay and conveying a personable honesty.  He's carried an
    underground buzz for the better part of a year and <i>Urb</i> magazine recently tagged him as one of the
    ""next 100"".  And RJD2-- do we really need to recap this man's accomplishments of late?  To paraphrase the
    esteemed Big L: if production was a game, RJ would be MVP.</p><p>
    
    Still, hype and individual talent do not necessarily equal a perfect match.  And while few would dispute
    <i>Deadringer</i>'s status as one of the year's most entertaining records, it's also widely accepted that the
    tracks which feature emcees are the album's weakest.  So, the big question with the <i>Unlimited</i> EP is not
    whether Blueprint and RJD2 will bring the heat-- we all know they will-- but whether or not their distinctive
    styles will sync with one another.</p><p>
    
    After a brief and astoundingly soulful intro track, the disc opens with the title song, and it's everything
    we'd hoped for and expected from this collaboration, with Blueprint declaring, ""Let's take it back to the
    fundamentals,"" and RJD2 backing up him with a thumping drum track laced with playful flute and booming
    horn samples.  This upbeat and mischievous production is the perfect foil for Blueprint's acrobatic vocal
    delivery.  ""Revolution starts with somebody loud,"" Blueprint raps, ""somebody to throw the brick into the
    crowd.""  Soul Position have officially kicked off this record with a hundred-pound slab of sweetness.</p><p>
    
    If ""Unlimited"" is a slow cruise down the boulevard of funk, ""Mic Control"" is a shuffling retreat into dark
    New Orleans alleyways.  RJD2 provides a track that's nothing short of phenomenal: a noir piano sample is
    fastened to a plodding beat as a bluesy voice sings, ""Walking into this world alone...""  Over this, RJ
    throws down bluesy guitar and cello that reinforces the song's smoky atmosphere.  And although the mood
    is definitely darker than the man's usual fare, he wisely injects the track with enough swing for Blueprint
    to anchor his taunting rhymes to.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the chemistry falls off a bit in the EP's second half.  While there's nothing wrong with
    the chopped-up production of ""Take Your Time"", RJD2 should have realized that the track is a bit too
    slo-mo for Blueprint's rhymes.  Thankfully, RJ redeems himself from this unfortunate aberration with the
    crackling blues instrumental ""Oxford You Really Owe Me""-- even with a screeching metal guitar sample thrown
    real low in the mix, this track is utterly sublime.  And what makes this EP all the more impressive is that
    it's just a warm-up for Soul Position's full-length to be released this winter. If these two can sustain the
    energy they've generated for this release, Soul Position may well be on their way to great things.</p></div>"|7368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7368-unlimited-ep/|8.0|Sam Chennault

I'd been making
    preparations to head up to his cabin when I got a call from my editor.  ""Be extra careful on this assignment,
    gumshoe, I hear the Jockey's been a little touchy lately,"" he growled, the underlying message being 'don't
    screw this one up.'  A trip to the outfitters produced another, strangely conflicting warning: ""T.J.'s sort
    of settled down, so don't expect to get a wild horsetale up there, fella,"" said the shopkeeper, slipping
    some No-Doze tabs in with the standard flexigrip ballpoints and steno pads.  ""Grown roots?"" I added.  ""Nah,""
    he snorted.  ""More like ossification.""</p><p>
    Now just why he'd given me stimulants wasn't exactly clear.  Time was, the Thrill Jockey made for the most
    exciting headlines, stories about madcap fusions and all that jazz, enough to turn a tortoise into a trans
    am.  But as rumor had it, the Jockey had begun to slow down a bit, quite possibly under the influence of
    some prescription from Vienna only classified as 'Radian'.  So I took the stims against my better judgment
    and headed out towards the rail lines.  The directions were a little vague: past the Town and Country Inn,
    halfway 'round the oval track, back behind the all-natural farm.  When I arrived a cold, dead wind rose,
    like in those cliché Westerns you always catch on broadband.</p><p>
    Then I realized the 'wind' was coming from inside T.J. H.Q. itself.  I stepped gingerly through the door and
    spotted the Jockey himself.  The old coot was propped up on a rocker with his feet kicked in the air, and he
    motioned for me to sit down.  The environment was strangely clean, pristine even, except for the sine wave
    I'd heard before and these erratic patches of noise.  It was clear he'd been under the influence of this
    Radian: far from a tornado, he just sat there and absorbed all the random sounds, bass modulations, shifty
    percussive shimmers and the occasional ring of a vibraphone.  It was boring as all hell.  If I'd had a piece
    I might have put him out of his misery right there.</p><p>
    The Jockey and I got to talking, and a peculiar thing began to happen.  The longer I listened, the more those
    random synthesized shapes shifted into place, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.  In fact, at one point a
    sound just like a buzzsaw rose up, spraying out electric sparks that would eventually fall to the matte of
    feedback on the floor.  The hour passed patiently as the sounds of electricity were brought to life:
    appliance purr, amped-up feedback hiss, the threshold hum of a jack-in port, all were animated and made to
    dance in their MacEntirety.  A strange rhythm developed, like dub stretched out even further, with the
    skittering drums rolling into the sharp punctuation of the bass.</p><p>
    I wasn't sure what the Thrill Jockey was on, though it was obviously more European than American in origin.
    The only strains that came to mind were occasional dalliances with FennO'Berg and Stock, Hausen &amp; Walkman.
    The Jockey seemed to have found his own little world, a controlled environment that he could manipulate with
    pointillist precision.  It wasn't the scoop I'd come digging for, but it was news all the same.  I left him
    to his vices, sort of glad that he'd found a quiet spot away from the clamor of the thrill-seeking life.
    But a part of me hoped that he wouldn't confuse his repetitions-with-delay for progress just because he'd
    created warped machine funk.  Still, I wasn't worried-- the Jockey still had a few good kicks left in him.</p></div>"|6647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6647-recextern/|7.4|Christopher Dare

    from DJ Food's tasty hors d'oeuvres, to slices from Coldcut and Funky Porcini, to The Herbaliser's homegrown
    selections.  But that decade has passed and-- post-pot smoke and the deleterious effects of ""trip-hop"" on
    the reception of downtempo grooves-- it's hard to deny that a good chunk of it sounds really dated.  Not so
    for the man called Amon, whose ability to evoke entire jazz symphonies from two turntables and a sampler
    caused much jaw-dropping and salivation.  He quit school and composed <i>Bricolage</i> and <i>Permutation</i>,
    each blending jazzy samples and drum-n-bass into tours de force that still sound fresh today.</p><p>
    
    Of course, given the rapid pulse of the electronic scene, it's easy to forget that Tobin has steadily churned
    out an album every two years.  In 2000, he dropped his first real departure, the aggressive <i>Supermodified</i>,
    which digitized his sound into fractals for the 21st century.  Having paid his dues and grasped his contribution,
    he's left the exploration of improv's interstices to DJ Spooky and Thirsty Ear's Blue Series and has since
    ventured into the furthest realms of space.  <i>Out From Out Where</i> beams back at us from one of those
    planets where mutant morlocks throw block parties and robo-dogs get it on with intelligent fire hydrants.
    It's a future that may not end in dystopia; there are a few user-friendly moments once you get past all the
    sharp edges.</p><p>
    
    The physics of drums and bass haven't been abandoned altogether, evidenced in the insane opener ""Back From
    Space"" as a barrage of tech fills skitter amongst chimes and the surprise accompaniment of heavy metal guitar.
    But Tobin seems less concerned with showing off tricky breaks and Krupa-on-crack rhythms here, and more taken
    with just rocking the house.  Thus, ""Chronic Tronic"" oscillates cycles of beats with hissing snare pistons,
    mining post-electro territory similar to that explored by Skinny Puppy or Download.  ""Cosmo Retro Intro Outro""
    likewise pursues a dance vibe, though this time it recalls an old-school rave-up as synth vamps come at the
    climax to push aside the junglist influence.  This isn't easy listening in any sense of the word, but you
    have to nod your head to the nasty bass tremors on ""Rosies"" that echo the collaborations of Techno Animal and
    Alec Empire.</p><p>
    
    There are traces of the organic instruments Tobin previously used, especially in the orchestral swells that
    dramatize a few of the tracks.  More often they're stitched into the frames, as with the rumbling double bass
    that forms the engine of ""Searchers"".  The later songs slow down for a series of drifting atmospheres
    punctuated by dubby upstrokes or hints of Brazilian percussion, and it's increasingly mind-boggling to
    believe that all the featured sounds originate from a sampler.  But Tobin insists on his method, so we have
    to imagine that the plips and plops of ""Proper Hoodidge"" might have been guitar licks at some point, and
    that the ominous drone haunting ""El Wraith"" may have been a foghorn in a past life.  Describing all the
    ethereal sounds flooding the beautiful closer ""Mighty Micro People"" would require a few hundred words alone.</p><p>
<i>Out From Out Where</i>'s most dynamic workouts bounce along energetically, completely enamored of
    themselves; ""Verbal"" comes close to dopey big beat territory, with vocals from MC Decimal R diced into
    Prefuse and Chipmunks soundbytes.  Tobin's definitely out to have some fun with this record, though the
    immense density of these soundscapes prevent them from being reduced to chop-shop filler.  Unfortunately,
    he seems less interested in taking you on a journey, as each piece ends in roughly the same place as it
    begins.  Where the pleasure lies here, however, is in listening to the rich layers unfold, and the music
    just glows, filled with his enthusiasm.  Amon Tobin may never put out a party album, but this is probably
    as close as he's going to get.</p></div>"|8085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8085-out-from-out-where/|8.5|Christopher Dare

    comparisons to June of 44.  All dropped names contain valid indicators of the Sweep sound: noisy, progressive,
    potent, avant-garde. Had I not told you that, however, and maybe even in spite of it, you might be drawing
    comparisons to other, less reputable artists; the Mighty Mighty Bosstones come to mind, for example, as do
    a wealth of mediocre hardcore bands.</p><p>
    
    Sweep has been an active touring combo ever since their inception in 1996, logging over 725 shows in that
    period. All the action didn't take place without some success. Sweep gained a reputation as an energetic,
    hard-charging live act, one that always made sure to keep the power in post-rock. It's safe to say they
    still have that mindset-- you hear it in the first 20 seconds of ""Sometimes My Balls Feel Like Tits""
    (reviewer attempts to hold straight face), which takes a middle-eastern flavored sax lick and tears it to
    shreds with a cascade of guitar rage.</p><p>
    
    Problems, however, surface early. Like the ""Tits"" track-- for all of the volume, all of the power, there
    isn't much guts to the riffage. It's definitely a cerebral jam. Nothing in the guitars, drums or sax grab
    anything corporeal. Not ass, not balls, not viscera. Instead, it attempts to torch the ears while aiming
    at the analytical center, the brain. But as technically complex and interesting as this may be to Sweep,
    it is not all that interesting to the listener. As a matter of fact, the ""rock hard to stuff that doesn't
    really rock at all"" approach can provide quite a bit of frustration.</p><p>
    
    Bring in classically half-assed post-rock vocals, as on ""Only in a Rerun"", and you unfortunately get more
    of the same.  The vocals take a relaxed, jazzy feel, and the progression plods along with an uncomfortable,
    mathematical form, sounding like Zorn's Masada, but with less funk. It grinds, though, and pores over itself,
    with crunchy metallic guitar tones and frenetic drumming complementing the modal alto sax lines. But in the
    end, it's unsatisfying. All the amplification in world can't make up for a lack of soul, providing more proof
    that some genres just don't rock.  Is there aggravation in this dojo?  Yes, Sensei.  I say give it the body
    bag.</p></div>"|7655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7655-going-down-swingin/|5.9|Brendan Reid

    before developing an obsession with Squarepusher and deciding to probe the most hectic beats possible on
    labels such as Planet \xB5 and his own Reckankreuzung, as well as falling into the Tigerbeat6 orbit. You also
    may know Hrvatski by his pithy electronic music write-ups for the Forced Exposure website, penned while he
    worked in sales for the revered distributor. But the Keith Fullerton Whitman of <i>Playthroughs</i> has kept
    a lower profile. Starting last year with the <i>21:30 for Acoustic Guitar</i> EP, Whitman began experimenting
    with subtle music based on laptop-processed guitar tones. While he's tinkered with this approach here and
    there, <i>Playthroughs</i> is his first sustained exploration of quiet sound.</p><p>
    If you've listened to the more drone-focused side of electronic music in the last few years, you've
    definitely heard the core elements that make up <i>Playthroughs</i>. There is no radical breakthrough in
    texture here, nothing to make you turn your head and say, ""What the hell was that?"" <i>Playthroughs</i>
    consists entirely of processed guitar, but the tones are light on harmonics, with many possessing an almost
    sine wave-level of clarity. As the thin drones hang in the air and shift this way and that, they harmonize
    with other drones and find themselves poked with fuzzy implements of static. Nothing terribly earth-shattering
    about this composition method.</p><p>
    It's true that much of <i>Playthroughs</i> seems familiar on the surface, but I don't think it an exaggeration
    to say that this record essentially perfects this particular style of music. It's an album of meticulous
    balance, Zen focus, and tiny gestures that carry great force, where each individual piece of sound is
    carefully placed to maximize impact. The first 3\xBD minutes of ""feedback zwei"", for example, consists of
    overlapping blankets of clean, piercing electronic feedback that remain in constant motion, creating new
    harmonic patterns with each passing second. And an unexpected cloud of pink noise slowly envelops the sound
    field, bathing the entire track in a warm digital mist and drastically shifting the perspective. Eventually
    sub-bass tones provide even more glaring contrast (be sure to listen to this track on good headphones). It
    all sounds simple on paper, but the emotional impact of the transformation in ""feedback zwei"" is completely
    overwhelming, never failing to produce a lump in my throat.</p><p>
    The five tracks on <i>Playthroughs</i> were designed to work together, and a similar palette is used
    throughout. The opening ""track3a(2waynice)"" (obviously titles are of no import) finds Whitman trying his
    hand with the phase techniques of La Monte Young and Ryoji Ikeda, showing how much weird tension can be
    created when two or three tones that don't quite match up.  The style of ""fib01a"" has the easiest reference
    point, being quite close in texture and feel to <i>94diskont</i>-era Oval, minus the CD skips and with a
    greater understanding of extended tones. ""ACGTR SVP"" contains the thickest drones on <i>Playthroughs</i>,
    as guitars processed to sound like organs swell and recede. And the closing ""modena"" is 17 minutes of sonic
    bliss, strangely beautiful electronic taps that seem to hang in the air like a handful of airborne glitter
    catching light in extreme slow motion.</p><p>
    If I were talking to you about this album over coffee somewhere, I'd probably slide my copy across the table,
    say, ""Give it a listen and see what you think,"" and then change the subject.  Everyone knows the problem of
    building something up to a friend-- after hearing ""You're going to love it, it's so perfect-- incredible!""
    a number of times, your expectations balloon to a size that no actual experience could ever hope to fill.
    I'm doubly reluctant to tell you what I think of <i>Playthroughs</i> because of the nature of the music.
    When I was talking up the Boredoms' <i>Super Ae</i> a couple years ago, I knew it was the kind of album
    that grabbed the listener by the throat and shook him around the room. Love it or hate it, <i>Super Ae</i>
    had the sort of impact you could feel through your body, and I had no doubt that everyone would understand
    just how colossal it was. <i>Playthroughs</i> is an entirely different animal, with a much more understated
    appeal. Still, I'm writing a record review for Pitchfork here, so I have to give you my honest opinion: this
    is by some margin the best album I've heard in 2002, and there are only about ten weeks left.</p></div>"|8659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8659-playthroughs/|9.7|Mark Richardson

    muted, cavernous saloonery of their sixth full-length, <i>Is a Woman</i>, and the world was underwhelmed.
    Some even called the album Kurt Wagner's love letter to himself, since his swooning yet sawdusty vocals (and
    therefore his fractured verse) formed the album's fulcrum.""</p><p>
    
    What a dumb story. To anyone who dismissed <i>Is A Woman</i>, as I (and Pitchfork: see archives) initially
    did, I suggest a revisitation, keeping in mind that Lambchop is ever-evolving, and that the collective who
    brought you <i>Nixon</i>'s sunroofy jams has every damn right to bring you the wintry cabin fever of <i>Is
    a Woman</i>. What Kurt giveth, he taketh away.</p><p>
    
    Anyone familiar with the spoken-word or if-Gibby-Haynes-was-a-carny
    tracks on <i>I Hope You're Sitting Down</i>, or the gentle overkill of <i>How I Quit Smoking</i>, or the
    cyclical despondent profanity of <i>Hank</i> and <i>Thriller</i>, or the soul-country variety show of <i>What
    Another Man Spills</i> knows that half the fun of slapping down your American superdollars for 'Chop product
    is not knowing what new vein Wagner and company are going to mine/pollute: Cascading falsettos? Someone
    playing a lacquer-thinner can with a wrench? Covers of Dump, East River Pipe or Curtis Mayfield? Lyrics
    about fighting Garth Brooks or fixating on a backyard sprinkler? Background singers so white-sounding they
    bring to mind afternoons with Granny polishing endtables to Perry Como?</p><p>
    
    Besides, the <i>Is a Woman</i> album sports some gorgeous, laconic looniness.  The fragile, accidental tone
    works best at weird hours, and the tyranny with which Wagner subdues his ensemble almost suggests that
    the accompanying instruments exist only in the imagination of the album's disintegrating piano man-- in fact,
    the album leads one to picture a guy in a tux hunched over a baby grand in some department store or touristy
    restaurant, fed up with spewing neglected renditions of ""It Could Happen to You"", so he wraps his cummerbund
    around his head and breathily boasts about how far he can flick a cigarette (""Flick"") or sings confessions
    like ""I Can Hardly Spell My Name"". By the end of the set, the pants are off, the flask is out, and our hero
    is prostrate across the piano.</p><p>
    
    Lambchop's elliptical songs can rewardingly be set to drum loops, and this EP will delight those who dig the
    big-beat remixed tracks from <i>Tools in the Dryer</i> and elsewhere. The album version of ""Is a Woman"" kicks
    off the disc, and if you forgot it (who can blame you, this anti-anthem feels designed to slip through cracks),
    it's a downtrodden, jazzy tapeworm of a song that busts into subtly choral, bouncy reggae-- stridently
    completing the full-length's comprehensive motif of intentional non-sequiturship. Schneider TM, probably
    the ""name"" overhauler here, deliver a frustrating take on the excellent, observation-listing ""New Cobweb
    Summer"". The vocals sound squeezed through some phaser, and a farty R&amp;B; groove is propped underneath the
    airy original's stilts.</p><p>
    
    Alpha and The Maxwell Implosion deliver the gold on each of their ""Is a Woman"" expansions. Alpha nods
    slightly to the mid-90s when inattentive reviewers used to call Lambchop's big sound ""lounge"", referring
    to the ""space-age"" retro stuff. But this loungification is legitimately forward-looking, coating the song's
    spine with at least four tracks of trembling keys that often trail off like a lab-bred army of exospheric
    moths. The Maxwell Implosion mix stresses soft drums, organ hits, and island-strummed guitars. If not for
    the one chorus during which it juxtaposes xylophone tones with a ""bubble"" percussion (think ""Pop-Up Videos""),
    this thing would be a complete part of your balanced breakfast.</p><p>
    
    Also included is an animated video: a leaf drifts down a snowy river, then begins to walk and dance, which
    leads inevitably to a leaf parade. Yep. The art's pretty and all, but the clip is skippable if you're the
    type who calculates your waking hours' opportunity costs in five-minute increments.  So the EP is mostly
    fan-fare, but of the kind that could season a mean mix CDR. Lambchop's one of the few crews who could find
    a poetic use for the brands they check in these songs (Sony, Sherwin Williams), and that alone can help you
    abide in a world where certain periodicals run creepy spreads on how celebrities eat, complete with
    paparazzi shots of Enrique Iglesias burger-snarfing. Three spins of the Alpha and Maxwell Implosion remixes
    and mastication-porn is wiped clean from the psyche.</p></div>"|4658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4658-is-a-woman-ep/|7.2|William Bowers

<i>""Hey, at least I don't sound like a hoarse Mickey Mouse and you can't really tell if I'm on key or not.""</i></p><p>
    
    ""It just seemed like a bad idea at the time.  And it was.""</p><p>
    
    ""Why did we do another recording of this?""</p><p>
    
    With enthusiastic testimony like that, it must mean another medium-popular 90s nth-wave punk band is
    releasing their vinyl/comp odds and ends!  Which they are!  They being Jawbreaker!  And putting aside
    for a moment the usual collector-fleecing aspect of these anthologies (said obsessive having eBayed his
    way to a complete Jawbreaker discography, only to find the bulk reissued on fancy packaged disc anon),
    is it really necessary?</p><p>
    
    I have loved Jawbreaker.  These days, I like them.  It's different now, being not 16 anymore.  My fondness
    can't extend beyond a bittersweetly-reminiscing-about-high-school-days-and-ex-girlfriends perspective.
    Hearing ""Fireman"" or ""Ashtray Monument"" still gets me all smiley, but the effect today is more than 50%
    memory-driven.  Precious few bands can be certain that their <i>released</i> material holds up beyond the
    temporal context in which it was originally heard, much less the cutting room floor scraps and early demos.
    So unless you're writing a thesis paper on Blake Schwarzenbach's musical evolution, the majority of
    <i>Etc</i> should be of no interest.</p><p>
    
    Jawbreaker didn't even get certifiably great until five years after getting together.  1990's <i>Unfun</i>
    was cold; <i>Bivouac</i> was getting warmer.  But it wasn't until 1993's indie classic <i>24 Hour Revenge
    Therapy</i> that they really nailed it.  As such, the first two-thirds of <i>Etc</i> are <i>excruciating</i>
    in every sense, as Jawbreaker reveals their younger selves as just another band with a stack of Fugazi
    records where their originality should be.  The early, mostly demo material is above-average boom-chick
    punk (especially ""Shield Your Eyes"" and ""Caroline""), explaining their rise above the other worshippers at
    the Church of MacKaye.  But it also lets some absolutely dreadful moments out of the closet, like the
    five-minute-plus hardcore-influenced ""Fantastic Planet"" (aren't hardcore songs limited to two minutes by
    law?) and a U2/Misfits/Vapors medley worthy of a junior high power trio playing the local YMCA.</p><p>
    
    Alright, I'm being a little harsh; there are a few insightful moments of science-fair experimentalism--
    the backwards loop at the end of ""Gutless"", the scary-voice suicide rant over ""Split""-- that foretell the
    band's majestic peak, <i>24HRT</i>'s ""Condition Oakland"".  But the vocal-cord-shredding emotion and
    one-dimensional arsenal (see how they Jawbreakerize, and thus ruin, REM's ""Pretty Persuasion"") gets old
    real fast.  Unlistenability comes to a head on ""Kiss the Bottle"" where Schwarzenbach sounds like the frog
    in his throat has founded a large frog colony.  ""This was the last thing we recorded before Blake's throat
    surgery,"" the liners cheerfully intone.</p><p>
    
    After that painful glimpse at pharynx pathology, things start to brighten as the band gets a little more
    tuneful and a little more polished.  <i>Revenge Therapy</i> and even <i>Dear You</i> outtakes fare better
    than their ancestors, and the band rolls through a Psychedelic Furs cover (""Into You Like a Train"") with
    ease and aplomb.  Penultimate track ""Friendly Fire"" even draws out a roadmap towards Jets to Brazil's
    <i>Orange Rhyming Dictionary</i>, as the tempo gets slower and the words get wordier.  The album can't
    close without a reminder of its absolute inessentiality, however, which comes in the form of a pointless,
    no-alteration remake of the band's ""hit"", ""Boxcar"".  ""I think the major label defense budget spending was
    going to our heads,"" the notes tell us. (So why not charge us $15.99 for it?)  And that's why, to paraphrase
    ""Boxcar"" itself, one-two-three-4.2 is the score.</p></div>"|4213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4213-etc/|4.2|Rob Mitchum

Winfred E. Eye is a band, not an individual. Well, it was an individual at
    one time, the grandfather of frontman Aaron Calvert, but as a military man, Winfred got sick of being called
    Private Eye so he changed the family name to Calvert.  I digress.  This Winfred E. Eye is a band, so if I
    show up at your store, this CD better be filed under ""W"" not ""E"" or there's going to be trouble. You don't
    want another episode like when I found Jethro Tull filed under ""T"" and went all Bruce Banner on some poor
    clerk's ass.</p><p>
    
    Just like their name, the genre categorization of Winfred E. Eye requires a slight pause on the listener's
    part-- kneejerk pigeonholing, after all, makes a pigeon-knee'd jerkhole out of you and me.  To most casual
    listeners, the hazy late night vibe this Oakland-based six-piece creates is likely to be hastily dismissed
    as a bad Tom Waits impersonation.  There are similarities-- in fact, similarities not unlike Songs: Ohia's
    Jason Molina and Will Oldham.  But as with Molina, listening beyond the surface reveals a storyteller on a
    different path.</p><p>
    
    Besides, Calvert's voice doesn't just bring Waits to mind-- he also evokes Tindersticks' Stuart Staples, Ron
    Sexsmith, and even Dr John, delivering his words in a kind of soulful, mumbling speak-sing. And his lyrics
    are, shall we say, less Fellini-esque than Waits'. There are no dwarves doing cartwheels in the background
    of these songs, no mad scientists or one-eyed fortune tellers, though there are plenty of down-and-outs.
    But, in general, Calvert's lyrics are much more personal and direct.</p><p>
    
    For instance, ""Rinding the Rails"", vague though it may be, seems to be about a France-bound post-grad on
    the Eurail fantasizing about some girl across the aisle.  The fantasy, however, turns dark as Calvert sings,
    ""Whores can teach/ This might be true/ I've seen the depths where love festers."" Then there are three songs
    that appear to be about his dog (""Dog"", ""Dog's Brother"", and ""Bury It!""), and the hopelessly forlorn ""Keep
    the Bed Warm"", which, with its refrain ""coping with coping,"" could only have been drawn from personal
    experience.</p><p>
    
    As for the five other members of the band, they do a great job of creating a world where it's always dusk
    and the sea air is blowing in, like a breezier Black Heart Procession. The best song  on the album is the
    closer, ""Monte Rio"", which pits a distant drum loop, an accordion drone, and a simple, repetitive acoustic
    guitar riff against Calvert's chorus, ""Remember what I said/ Don't forget it/ Forget what I said/ Forget it,""
    and his most self-loathing fare, ""No one wants to touch you... and it's starting to sink in.""</p><p>
    
    Still, as songwriters go, Calvert has a long road to travel before he's at the top of his game.  There are
    presently any number of artists blowing minds in this medium, and <i>A Bottle, A Dog, Some Milk, A Bottle</i>
    is certainly a pleasant outing, it offers little more than promise of a brighter future for this band.</p></div>"|8703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8703-a-bottle-a-dog-some-milk-a-bottle/|6.9|Jason Nickey

A boombox on the cover that's straight out of Spike Lee's <i>Do
    the Right Thing</i>. And, to start the album off, a deliberate, pre-programmed drumbeat that sounds as dated
    as that boombox looks.  At first glance, <i>WACMusic</i> seems an unlikely release coming from San Francisco-based
    Badman Recordings, which has released work from the likes of Hayden, My Morning Jacket and Red House Painters
    frontman Mark Kozelek-- all of them devotees of an organic, subdued sound often dubbed Americana.</p><p>
    
    But Brooklyn-based duo Ill Lit soon quiet any suspicions that they deviate from this tradition, despite
    bearing the folktronica tag. <i>WACMusic</i> is, at its core, a quintessentially Badman album, albeit with
    some technological additives. The aforementioned opener, after all, is entitled ""Diner Girls"", so it's no
    surprise that the mechanized beat loses out to genuine drums and a softly strummed guitar not unlike much
    of the work of the band's labelmates.</p><p>
    
    Within this folky vibe, however, there remains a inorganic element, as this track is imbued with the welcome
    sounds of a whirring keyboard. The lyrics are similarly juxtaposed. ""Americans just like to French kiss,""
    leads off the male vocalist, while he later sings, in a pleasant twang, ""Aliens, they're coming for us.""
    Ill Lit's depiction of rural America, in other words, is not just that of cornfields, but of crop circles
    as well.  This dynamic largely pays off in a unique, though familiar record that recalls the lost highway
    warmth of East River Pipe, but without the dreadful isolation. And while there are acoustic ruminations
    aplenty--  such as the raw, tape hiss-infused ""Options""-- there's also an uptempo rocker (""Beating the
    Daylights Out of My Nightlife"") and a reverb-heavy ambler (""Whitewashing"").</p><p>
    
    Several numbers don't quite work. ""Prestonhood"", for instance, opens with several minutes of atmospherics--
    spliced piano twinkling with bursts of lapping water and distorted vocals. A pleasant but unremarkable song
    emerges with the always hit-or-miss male/female vocal harmonization. A line like, ""Every hip girl I know
    these days likes suicide,"" doesn't help matters either.  Overall, though, <i>WACMusic</i> is an artistic
    success. Don't be fooled by the bandname, album art or intermittent electronics; all of these are superficial
    concerns. But don't take my word for it: inside the CD case, Ill Lit assures the listener, ""We are country
    music."" They are, indeed-- and then some.</p></div>"|4075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4075-wacmusic/|7.0|Ryan Kearney

    different from the one that came before, simultaneously spelling out the brittle aesthetics of England's
    burgeoning punk movement and, in nearly the same breath, eclipsing them while the rest of the pack was
    still busy learning to tune their guitars?  What band would be willing to then walk away from the zenith
    of their popularity, claiming they simply didn't have another album in them, only to resurface six years
    later in 1987 for a string of highly dubious (but not hopeless) new-wave castaways?  What band would name
    one of those albums <i>Manscape</i>?  And <i>then</i>, what band could spend ten more years in stasis,
    recuperating, biding their time for their inevitable recovery, to eventually drop a set of EP's so unique,
    so urgent, that it's as though the band never went away in the first place?  Most importantly, even one
    year ago, who ever would have believed that such a stunning return was possible?  No one but Wire.</p><p>
<i>Read &amp; Burn 02</i>, the second installment of Wire's new three-part mini-series, picks up right where
    <i>01</i> left off; that is, nearly twenty-five years after unleashing the seminal <i>Pink Flag</i>, Wire
    is continuing to make greatness look easy.  In a time when so many bands are content to adapt the sounds of
    twenty years ago, and The Boils and The Blah Blah Blahs will be the stars of the garage-revival revival five
    years down the road, it's ironic (really!) that a band that was actually around in the late seventies is
    releasing music relevant and modern enough that they sound almost as cutting edge now as they did two
    decades ago.  The <i>Read &amp; Burn</i> series draws unavoidably on Wire's past, but the attitude and
    presentation transmute these fundamentals into something distinctly new.</p><p>
    
    Clockwork percussion mechanisms, guttural barking, and an abrasive storm of guitars akin to a sandpaper
    tornado characterized <i>01</i>, and it was impressive just to hear Wire back in lean, mean fighting form.
    <i>02</i>, however, takes these elements a step further, wringing, twisting, and torturing guitars to eke
    out some of the lacerating, poisonous noise (going well beyond the simple distortion of <i>01</i>) for which
    they were famous.  If not for these seething tones, <i>02</i> could easily become an echo of the first
    <i>Read &amp; Burn</i> installment, equally impressive, but redundant.  Wire's not messing around, though--
    naked, venomous aggression and robotic rhythms fuse momentously with six strings' worth of their patented
    alien sounds.  The resulting blast will leave you ducking and covering.</p><p>
    
    Initially, Wire's newfound rage may be off-putting to those fans whose fondest memories of the band are
    from pop-informed pleasantries like ""Map Ref 41N 93W"" or ""The 15th"".  And while there is some historical
    precedent for the sound invoked by the new material (see ""12XU"", ""Brazil"", among others), it does seem to
    be the case that the melodic offerings they're probably most famous for have nearly disappeared.  The vocal
    harmonies have been completely phased out, and to some extent, the vocals themselves are of tertiary
    importance outside of a simple rhythmic device.  Behind a smiling keyboard refrain and patches of static
    sweeps and synth washes, the vox on ""Read and Burn"" are a distorted, screamed rally cry solely to create a
    martial pace rather than any discernible content.  A mutilated chant of, ""Nice streets/ Nice streets/ Nice
    streets above,"" punctuates an intermittent burble of reverse-recorded lyrics, suffocating as they try
    desperately to break the surface of ""Nice Streets Above"".  It's claustrophobic, antagonistic, and wonderfully
    overpowering.</p><p>
    
    Other songs, like the incomparable ""Raft Ants"", contain what <i>sounds</i> like lyrics-- though I'll give
    you one US dollar if you can actually discern what Bruce Gilbert is breaking his lungs to shout at you.
    Vocal melody is rendered obsolete (again) by the bravado of ""Raft Ants""' churning guitars.  Wire chooses to
    supply an almost subliminal sense of melody through feedback undercurrents of whole tones, occasionally
    diverted by ominous breaks.  The dulcet tones are pounded into the background, but rise to fore stronger
    despite (or because of) it.  The ingenious, deep composition of ""Raft Ants"" makes an embarrassment of
    entirely too much music, and its interweaving of their early work with their sound from the mid-80s is too
    impressive to overlook.</p><p>
    
    Finally, for those that still hunger for the melodious Wire of ye olde 1970s, you haven't been forgotten.
    ""Trash/Treasure"" is their gift to you, briefly bringing to mind the drone of ""Outdoor Miner"" as the song
    gradually intensifies in a haze of feedback, quickening back towards the frenetic racing speed of the rest
    of <i>02</i>, and slowly sinking the lyrical harmonies back into the mix.  If nothing else, as it returns
    to step with the rest, it serves as a reminder that Wire is ready to move on, which is good-- to my ears
    this track, though excellent, seemed like an antique in the midst of such a seamless blend of new and old.
    <i>Read &amp; Burn 02</i> is an unqualified improvement over the excellence of <i>01</i>.  Be sure to stay tuned
    for the final chapter in Wire's latest saga; the Brit-punk legends have justified their return, and all
    that's left is to turn eyes toward the future.</p></div>"|8711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8711-read-burn-02-ep/|8.6|Eric Carr

    percentage of the world's critic-accredited geniuses.  It's not hard to see why, though: the work of
    weird people is hard to figure out sometimes, and as critics often lack the patience to put forth a
    concerted effort to do so, they'll often offhandedly laud incomprehensible art as genius (word to
    Merzbow's mother).</p><p>
    
    Gordon Anderson (aka Lone Pigeon) is a strange one.  An erstwhile member of the Beta Band who co-wrote
    some of that band's most accessible material (including the certifiable indie smash ""Dry the Rain""),
    Anderson came down with health problems that resulted in him leaving the group, just before the critical
    whirlwind swept.  <i>Concubine Rice</i>, his third full-length release and first with stateside distribution,
    sounds instantly familiar, like the most idiosyncratic, oddball moments on Beta Band's self-titled disc,
    but without any of the groove behind it.  At its strongest, <i>Concubine Rice</i> is a tribute to the great
    sixties songwriters seen through the lens of an acid trip (or vice versa); at its worst-- and at its most
    frequent-- the disc wallows in pointless, unfocused, non-sequitur nonsense. The sycophants would tell you
    it's quirky genius. I'm telling you it's not.</p><p>
    
    Song fragments are a staple of Lone Pigeon's aesthetic. The majority of these tracks are broken down into
    several fragments, most bearing little relationship to one another.  Album-by-ADD can be an effective
    technique (see Badly Drawn Boy's <i>The Hour of Bewilderbeast</i> or the Beta Band's own self-titled
    full-length) so long as the fragments have a point and the tunes are compelling.  But <i>Concubine Rice</i>
    meanders aimlessly, haphazardly wandering with little sense of melody at all.  And worse: the few tracks
    that are memorably melodic are painfully derivative, like the Lennon-inflected ""Heaven Come Down"", the
    sparse, Neil Young-ish ""Waterfall"", the straight-up, ""Drive My Car""-style Beatles rip on the opening to
    ""Old Mr. Muncherman"" and the Beatles-by-way-of-Oasis mug on ""Lay Me Down"".  Incidentally, by ""derivative"",
    I don't mean ""sounds like"".  You can tell what the influence is, but the execution is absolutely half-assed;
    at times, it hits like accidental mockery.</p><p>
    
    Everything on <i>Concubine Rice</i> is drenched in ""weird"".  This is especially true of the production, which
    varies from in-studio digital to inner-ass four-track. This lends the album some charm but, lacking songs to
    back up the ambience, any charm is pointless.  It's lost among his refusal to make me give a damn.  Same
    goes for the instrumentation: just as varied as the production, using the standard folk-pop guitars and
    pianos, while throwing-in a healthy dose of off-center Casiotone backbeats, samples, mandolins, and some
    unrecognizable horn-like things.  Again, charming, a little creative, but ultimately ineffectual.</p><p>
    
    Also falling under the ""weird"" heading are Lone Pigeon's lyrics. He sings about elephants, chimpanzees,
    ""the ancient hubbard cow of bubbletoop"" (he rhymes it with ""poop""), and a chick named Catherine to whom
    he expresses his displeasure with saccharine and deodorant.  Amusing, maybe, for the first two minutes or
    so, the words that accompany this mess seem to deliberately lack depth or poeticism-- not to mention anything
    a sober listener could relate to.</p><p>
    
    Right now, the genius inside of Lone Pigeon lies sleeping, undisturbed.  Several key items could awaken this
    genius within, including a Ritalin prescription, a good producer, the concept of ""focus"", and maybe a Tony
    Robbins. Implement these changes and the future might bode well for Mr Anderson.  As for <i>Concubine Rice</i>,
    though, there's not much to ""get"".  Nor is there much to ""buy"".</p></div>"|4837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4837-concubine-rice/|4.7|Brad Haywood

A willful refusal to obey the
    rules of one's genre and an urge to be different for the sake of difference
    can get you pretty far (where would the Flaming Lips be without it?), especially
    if the genre in question is particularly ossified or tired.  On the other hand,
    eccentricity's also the cheapest ticket to Novelty City.  This is especially true
    if your genre is, essentially, a reaction to another genre, a self-designated rule
    breaker; in which case, who's to say what's eccentric and what's just plain silly?
    For example, post-rock: what if, say, Godspeed You Black Emperor! developed a
    penchant for hand puppets and fake blood, and enlisted people in bunny suits to
    spout off about the IMF in French?</p><p>
    
    I'm just afraid that the Mercury Program will, or have already, come to be known
    as ""the dudes with the vibraphone"".  When they took the instrument up after their
    first album, just as they were phasing out vocals, it certainly seemed like a device
    for consciously distancing themselves from conventional rock.  And, despite the fact
    that vibes were already both a quirk and a cliche in post-rock, it worked wonders
    for their next release, the lauded EP <i>All the Suits Began to Fall Off</i>.  The
    distinct, clean tone of the vibes created the somewhat comforting illusion that
    there was a lead instrument (when this wasn't necessarily the case) and balanced
    the moments of distortion that the band had skimmed off the top of their previous
    sound.  Still, questions remained: had the Program cut themselves too thin of a slice
    from the Tortoise pie?  And: if they like their vibraphone so much, why don't they
    marry it?</p><p>
    
    Three out of four band members do indeed bang the mallets on <i>A Data Learn the
    Language</i>.  But even though they're on every track, the vibes don't sound nearly
    as prominent here as they did on <i>All the Suits Began to Fall Off</i>, which is a
    good thing, as more interesting shit tends to go down on this album.  Almost all
    remnants of dynamics-and-distortion histrionics have been purged from the band's
    sound, leaving them only the dense, Venn-diagram play of interlocking patterns to
    work with.  In the hands of a lesser band, this sort of thing can easily turn rigid;
    here, it often sounds just as lightweight as it is fraught.  Some of the tracks
    positively levitate; on ""Fragile or Possibly Extinct"", Whit Travisano's cascading
    electric piano and Tom Reno's sea-spray guitar almost evaporate.  Their touch is
    light but almost universally expert; even the obligatory electronic manipulation on
    the first track, ""Tequesta"", comes off as some of the most tastefully executed I've
    ever heard, subtly clothing Dave Lebleu's drums in a swarm of clicks.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the band's best trick-- one which they play throughout the album-- is to
    convince the listener that they don't exist.  Much of the time, it's hard to believe
    that humans are playing this music, not out of any excessive virtuosity or lack of
    emotion, but because of the celestial tones Reno and Travisano coax out of their
    instruments and the sharp focus of brother Sander Travisano's spartan bass and Lebleu's
    drums.  Maybe they manage this because they're manufacturing this sound using the
    sort of conventional instrumentation that we're conditioned to accept without thought.
    Maybe, because of this, the vibraphones tend to stick out like severed thumbs.  When
    the band uses them for anything other than texture, you're forced to entertain the
    idea that there is, in fact, a guy playing the vibraphone here.  And the vibes, by
    being so distinctive, emphasize the repetitiveness of the patterns they're playing,
    while the other instruments have a back door into your brain.</p><p>
    
    Some of the slightly weaker tracks in the middle of the album are hobbled by this
    (especially the second half of ""To/From Iceland"", which sounds cribbed directly from
    the ""Interval"" songs on Tortoise's <i>TNT</i>).  The band, though, has come too far
    to let this stop them, and the last three tracks are proof.  ""You Yourself Are Too
    Serious"" slowly unwinds its spiky, leapfrogging guitar and piano figures into a
    gorgeously simple conclusion; ""Gently Turned on Your Head"" tilts and rolls without
    ever going nauseous; and ""Sultans of El Sur"" ends on a decidedly forceful note, with
    a monumental rhythmic barrage crashing against a cathedral of echoed guitar.  Obviously,
    the band doesn't need a gimmick; in the end, though, the fact that they have one doesn't
    detract too much from the music.</p></div>"|5233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5233-a-data-learn-the-language/|7.5|Brendan Reid

    state and county fair circuits, allowed to play no further than 100 yards from the nearest ring-toss or
    cotton candy machine.  This was right and just.  But apparently, someone out there interpreted their absence
    from the recording studio as an abhorrent vacuum that must be filled, lest the universe lose precious balance.</p><p>
    
    Enter The Suntanama, who seem to be filling in for both of those bands on their self-titled debut, right down
    to the flute-inflected knock-off blues.  They even have three guys who play guitar (albeit not always at the
    same time).  I seem to remember, in the late 90s, everyone looking around trying to find ""The American
    Radiohead"", a pursuit that proved fruitless.  I'm fairly certain that I never heard of anyone seeking ""The
    American Gomez"", but I have definitely just inadvertently discovered it.  To their credit, The Suntanama
    focus only on one sound, tackling it with apparent feeling instead of grasping at genre-bending straws in
    the manner of their UK colleagues, but the result is still largely the same: limp, unpalatable blues ""rock"".</p><p>
    
    At the center of a concentric ring of problems lies vocalist Darren Zoltowski, whose voice is powerful in
    all the wrong ways.  He can project well, but in doing so, he tramples any semblance of coherence he may
    have otherwise had.  For the sake of mathematical simplicity, let's assume there are exactly 100 words of
    lyric on this album.  Out of that, you may be able to understand roughly 13.  And of those, probably 12 of
    them would be in track two, ""And So the Story Goes"", where Zoltowski sings something about carrying a heavy
    load and something to the effect of, ""I'll benawonatyoucahh lean onaahhh"".  Usually, he just wails in his
    gravelly way, mouthing syllables that never amount to anything you could get points off in a Scrabble match.</p><p>
    
    Zoltowski is abetted by a quintet that plugs away with a remarkable lack of focus-- a decent little groove
    pops up now and then, but the guitars take more noodle time in a day than the whole population of Thailand.
    Oddly, when Zoltowski clams up at the end of ""Corduroy Lawsuit"", finally throwing the spotlight to the guitars,
    they shy away from playing anything that sounds too soloish, almost as if they're afraid they may actually
    come up with something good.  The song putters to a limp close that evokes the Allman Brothers playing
    through the nastiest coke haze of their lives.  No, scratch that-- Duane Allman could play with more
    conviction than this if you broke his fingers.</p><p>
    
    And there you have it.  Not much going on in the land of The Suntanama.  Even the formidable producer/engineer
    combo of Neil Michael Hagerty and Brian Paulson couldn't coax any life out of these proceedings.  Seriously,
    if you're looking to hear a bunch of white guys try their hands at some routine blues stuff, go pick up a
    Canned Heat album.  Meanwhile, look for The Suntanama on the marquee at your next three-town fair.</p></div>"|7594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7594-the-suntanama/|3.3|Joe Tangari

It's probably safe to bet that you haven't, and there's really no shame
    in that-- not many people ever do.  In fact, these days it may be impossible to even do it at all, given how
    much ground has been covered and how much exposure we all have to so many different forms of media every day--
    chances are it would just turn out to be a subgenre of something else.  Still, I'd like to posit that Barry
    Adamson has come pretty damn close to pulling it off.</p><p>
    
    Most of you probably know Adamson from somewhere-- he first came to fame laying down the basslines for Howard
    Devoto's Magazine, later backing Nick Cave as a member of both the Birthday Party and the Bad Seeds.  Then,
    after departing from the Bad Seeds in 1987, he set forth on an interesting solo career that found him diving
    full-force into dark, cinematic music that seemed an entirely natural outgrowth of his past work.  When we
    last left him in 1998, he hit us with <i>As Above, So Below</i>, a superlative offering that found him
    wandering down jazz noir alleys and finding that there was actually quite a bit of room to rock down there.</p><p>
    
    Four years later, he's back with <i>King of Nothing Hill</i>, and it's clear that all that time spent touring
    popular music's darkest recesses has left an indelible mark on him.  The man can't even get funky without
    first setting an ominous tone.  In short, this is what it may have sounded like had George Clinton
    commissioned Angelo Badalamenti and Peter Christopherson to write music for <i>Hey, Man, Smell My Finger</i>--
    it's music that begs you to simultaneously cast a paranoid eye over your shoulder and get on the good foot.</p><p>
    
    It's hard to lay your finger on it, but Adamson himself may have hit on a name for his own little subgenre
    in the title of opening song: ""Cinematic Soul"".  The song itself is such a ridiculous combination of
    old-school funk's party atmosphere and creeping, electronically skewered art-rock that it almost <i>has</i>
    to work, solely on the strength of sheer inventiveness.  Granted, it's <i>awkwardly</i> funky, and there's
    one moment where Adamson just loses it.  (Memo to musicians everywhere: don't bring your grade-school aged
    kid in to sing along on any song, even for a brief moment.  It didn't work for Art Garfunkel; it didn't work
    for Eminem; it doesn't work for Barry Adamson.)</p><p>
    
    This vomit-coaxing misstep is hardly enough derail Adamson's soul train, though, as he rapidly branches out,
    aggressively covering all kinds of ground, from surf electronica (""The Crime Scene"") to vamping jazz noir
    with an insistent swing to it (""Les Matin de Noire"").  He tries his hand at some genuinely soulful
    singer/songwriter type stuff on ""That Fool Was Me"" with great success, though he cleverly subverts it with
    a bizarre, inventive horn arrangement that owes a huge debt to Charles Mingus.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, Adamson sticks primarily to topics you might expect to ooze from music like this, from his
    first-person hitman narrative on the relentlessly upbeat ""Whispering Streets"" to the comical Barry
    White-throated ""Satisfaction Jackson"" persona he adopts on ""Black Amour"".  Perhaps the most impressive
    element of the album, though, is just the sound of it-- constantly swirling and shifting textures, cut
    through with sweeping strings, slicing electronics and startlingly atonal bursts of piano and violin.
    Adamson produced it himself, and his skill at the board is remarkable; every sound fits exactly where it
    should and even the most bombastic moments don't feel overbearing.</p><p>
    
    Adamson has managed yet another fine addition to his long career with <i>King of Nothing Hill</i>, a unique,
    gripping listen that's certainly not for everyone, but manages to carve out an appealing niche for itself.
    There are times when it doesn't work especially well, but these are more than made up for by the instances
    where it hits and Adamson truly seems to be forging something of his own.  Anyone looking to fill that spot
    in their collection where icy noir and funk meet should be nicely appeased by this one.</p></div>"|47.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/47-the-king-of-nothing-hill/|7.7|Joe Tangari

I can't remember what they played or how
    the music sounded then, but it was hard to forget their stage presence: as hipster alt-country performers go,
    the Handsome Family rank among the oddest.  Wife Rennie Sparks was hunched slightly over her autoharp as if
    to suggest a spinal disorder, wearing a worn-out dress from the Dorothea Lange collection circa 1934.
    Husband Brett, a solid-looking fella, mostly played guitar and sang in a deep voice that hinted at a drawl.</p><p>
    
    Their husband-and-wife dynamic comes through more clearly on this live album, recorded in their then-hometown
    of Chicago.  The Digital Club Network, a website that hosts hundreds of webcasts from rock clubs around the
    country, taped the show at Schuba's on December 8th, 2000.  Featuring Brett, Rennie, and a drum machine,
    <i>Live at Schuba's Tavern</i> has seventeen of their ""greatest hits"", with confident, if not revelatory,
    performances.</p><p>
    
    And you also get their stage show.  Between songs, Rennie and Brett tease each other and tell jokes and
    stories-- particularly Rennie, who picks on Brett's family, tells a fake-miracle story, and reminisces about
    old gigs.  The first time you hear this stuff it's funny; the second time, it's already stale, like listening
    to a bad comedy album.  But if you make it to a fourth or fifth time, the routine starts to grow on you, like
    any married couples' stories that you have to hear again and again-- you're used to them, or at least, you
    know when they'll end.</p><p>
    
    During this schtick, Rennie tells most of the jokes and non-sequiturs, like the quip about how her cats want
    to steal her diamonds.  Get it?  It's funny 'cause it's weird.  They're the flipside of her lyrics, the
    ""light quirk"" next to the ""dark quirk"" of the songwriting.  Rennie wrote the words to all but one of these
    songs, and the morbid imagery, drunken losers and clever death scenes are as harmlessly gruesome as, say,
    the illustrations of Edward Gorey-- without the pointed humor.</p><p>
    
    Rennie is a gifted lyricist, and the songs are full of great lines and images.  ""Drunk by Noon"", from 1996's
    <i>Milk and Scissors</i>, is believably bitter: ""Sometimes I can't wait to come down with cancer/ At least
    then I'll get to watch TV all day.""  And ""I Know You Are There,"" from last year's <i>Twilight</i>, where they
    switch off the drum machine that accompanies most of their songs, sounds pious.  But it's hard to get past
    the strange-for-strangeness'-sake tone of most of the songs: they're about sad stuff but don't <i>sound</i>
    sad, as if talking about death is just a way to give weight to eccentricity.  It's about as haunting as a
    Mexican Day of the Dead figure knocked over on your dashboard.</p><p>
    
    In contrast to his wife, Brett is the sure and steady one.  As the composer of all of the music, Brett's
    written some good tunes, including ""Amelia Earhart vs. The Dancing Bear"", with its dreamy imagery of
    Earhart's last moments and Brett's great flaming-fuselage guitar solo.  But on other tracks, the yokelized
    veneer wears thin.  The songs are so stubbornly midtempo that it makes you wonder if they jammed their drum
    machine.  And the melodies can get stereotypically folksy, like <i>In the Air</i>'s ""The Sad Milkman"", which
    cribs ""On Top of Old Smokey""; or the procession of ballads like ""My Ghost"" or ""So Much Wine"", which are
    individually good but cumulatively homogenous.</p><p>
    
    Brett has a strong, rich voice, but you can get too used to hearing the same reverb-assisted declaiming from
    the plain tone on every track.  But it's preferable to Rennie's.  She sings lead vocals on ""Down in the Ground"",
    and her shrieking, slicing voice could make dead people climb from their graves to come and slap her.</p><p>
    
    So as you might have guessed, an hour of the concert may be more than you need unless you're a hardcore fan.
    On the other hand, the best thing about the disc is the lack of editing or polish.  By leaving in so much of
    their banter-- both funny and not-- and the occasional mistakes, <i>Live at Schuba's Tavern</i> feels like a
    night with the Sparks'.  It's more intimate than a big name live album: you get to hear a married couple make
    fun of each other and have a good time together.  Just don't forget who wears the pants in this family-- it's
    Rennie who gets to put all the words in Brett's mouth.</p></div>"|3727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3727-live-at-schubas-tavern/|6.5|Chris Dahlen

    required if getting heavy was the objective.  More than almost any other band on the planet, Kawabata's
    unit consistently delivers the most over-the-top, blunt-edge psyche-thrash humanly possible.  It is the
    ""most"", in every sense of the word.</p><p>
    
    Recently, Acid Mothers have stepped beyond their hairy boundaries to try their hands at other grooves: last
    year's <i>41st Century Splendid Man</i> LP incorporated brutal prog touches courtesy of Ruins' drummer
    Tatsuya Yoshida; <i>In C</i> found them covering minimalist Terry Riley and turning it down a notch in
    service of the holy drone; the three-disc <i>AMT Family</i> compilation featured a little bit of everything,
    including some hippie-fied acoustic folk.  Never one to be pigeonholed, Kawabata's aim with <i>Electric
    Heavyland</i> seems to have been, ""Fuck all that, I want to <i>BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN</i>.""  I, for one,
    think he means it.</p><p>
    
    From the get go, it's apparent this release is going to fall squarely in line with Acid Mothers' chaotic
    debut.  Warped vocals and sound effects emerge from silence, swirling like backwards UFOs on ""Atomic Rotary
    Grinding God/Quicksilver Machine Head"" (the world's most accurate title) only to crash without warning into
    air-raid guitar screams, hyper-dub bass and critical engorgement of the drums.  Forget the ""song"", this is
    a jam of the nose-rape variety, with noise-levels approaching Merzbow territory.  For this number alone,
    AMT devour the Japanese psyche legacy-- swallowing it whole and regurgitating a thousand decibels of
    indecency.  In the middle, they bring it down for the reappearance of the alien vocals, but then, just as
    quickly, launch a new jam, cosmically informed by Blue Cheer, the MC5 and Keiji Haino.  And it doesn't stop
    there.</p><p>
    
    ""Loved and Confused"" wastes no time via vocals or sound effects, and drops the apocalyptic super-rock from
    the start.  This would be close to another Kawabata project, Musica Transonic (with Yoshida and jam-kingpin
    Asahito Nanjo) with the repetitive riffing and overloaded (but not necessarily anarchic) mix.  What
    distinguishes it is AMT's signature massive reverb and tunneling effects: this jam could've existed 30
    years ago but it took modern-day overkill to approach tripped-up nirvana.  Too much of a good thing?  Is
    that possible?</p><p>
    
    If you make it to ""Phantom of Galactic Magnum"" (world's second most accurate title), congrats: you're doing
    almost as well as the guys in the band.  Opening with the unmistakable bubbles of bliss and just a wee bit
    of droning synth, the tune begins as not so much a jam, but a spin-cycle of cosmic despair.  White noise and
    what sound like the drastically altered vocals from the first tune get thrown around all over the place, and
    listening on headphones is more than disorientating.  Suddenly, my world explodes as the band pounces on the
    joint with some hell-blues, laced with sci-fi laser transmissions.  Jesus H. Fuck, this is loud.  There
    comes a point when heavy jamming and pure noise meet, and that point is tearing shit up at this very moment.</p><p>
    
    After <i>Electric Heavyland</i>, I'm going to need some rehab, so let me leave you with this quick thought:
    there are a lot of bands who would strut their freakishness by all manner of devices.  Some of them adopt a
    crazy image or pose (exhibit A: Mortiis' nose); others do strange things on stage (defecating in front of
    your fans doesn't count as heavy).  Acid Mothers Temple need none of that because they play the real bad
    stuff on a daily basis.  Pick this up for reference, and while you're at it, get some tranquilizers.  You'll
    need them.</p></div>"|22.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22-electric-heavyland/|8.3|Dominique Leone

    same theme. Ehlers would compose two tracks that referenced the work of an artist he admired and release the
    results under the title <i>Plays</i>. The first clue that these tracks are not proper covers or derived
    primarily from samples comes from the fact that one release in the <i>Plays</i> series references a filmmaker
    (<i>Ekkehard Ehlers Plays John Cassavetes</i>) while another pays homage to a writer (<i>Ekkehard Ehlers Plays
    Hubert Fichte</i>). Only Matthew Herbert could figure out a way to work samples of a book into his tracks;
    Ehlers interprets.</p><p>
    This release collects all the tracks from the <i>Plays</i> series onto a single CD.  It's a varied set-- some
    tracks are nothing but ambient laptop murmurs, others build on dense drones, and a couple contain beautiful
    string arrangements that would do the Penguin Café Orchestra proud. The music is accessible without the
    concept, but still, the first instinct upon hearing it is naturally to try and decipher the relationships
    between the tracks and the referenced artist.</p><p>
    I know Albert Ayler and Robert Johnson best, so I dug into these first. Both of the two <i>Plays Albert Ayler</i>
    tracks are comprised of cello samples, played by Anka Hirsch and recorded by Ehlers. It might be the Rorschach
    effect, but I think I can hear the Ayler referencing in track 7. When Ehlers chops the samples into small
    pieces and strings them together, they sound to me phrased like an Ayler solo, full of abandon even as they
    stay anchored to a melodic center. The strings also bring to mind Ayler's band circa <i>In Greenwich Village</i>,
    when he brilliantly incorporated violin and cello.</p><p>
    The two <i>Plays Robert Johnson</i> tracks make similar allusions. Ehlers plucks, samples and processes a
    guitar on track 9, referencing the vocal cry of Johnson's slide (and possibly mixing it with hints of the
    real thing). Track 10 definitely samples Johnson, with a small bit of a guitar riff added for rhythm and a
    compressed bit of the famous high-pitched vocals serving as a chorus. This last track is an anomaly on
    <i>Plays</i>, as the lifts from Johnson are inserted into the context of a minimal house track, giving the
    final piece the feel of a stripped down, easygoing Soul Center.</p><p>
    Whatever references exist for the remaining three artists mean nothing to me. Google tells me that novelist
    Hubert Fichte was the German Jean Genet, exposing the Rhineland to homosexuality as a subject for literature.
    The tracks bearing his name are okay, but I like them the least of any here. Both are composed in a glitch
    style that reminds me a lot of Microstoria, with interesting noises popping in and out of the mix. In a
    similar style but superior is the first track of <i>Plays Cornelius Cardew</i>, with the warm organ chords
    Microstoria sometimes indulges in.</p><p>
    The two <i>Plays Cassavetes</i> tracks, by contrast, are stunning. The first is an impossibly lush and
    vaporous swath of synth chords that should lead off the next edition of Kompakt's <i>Pop Ambient</i> series.
    The second is a string quartet playing the same phrase repeatedly over the course of ten minutes with only
    slight variation-- it sounds like a recipe for tedium, but I can't convey how beautiful this track is. And
    that's the key thread running through all of Ekkehard Ehlers-- it's so easy and so pleasurable to pay little
    attention to the concept and drink in the crystalline beauty of the sound.</p></div>"|2691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2691-plays/|8.8|Mark Richardson

    Joel Peterson is the bassist for The Faint, the one with the 80s-est hair, supposedly the perfectionist of
    the band, whose recalcitrant onstage sunken-Anglo concentration-face often looks like scorn for us needbags
    in the crowd.</p><p>
    
    The Faint is that group whose first album wrapped lame lyrics around captivating guitar hooks, and whose
    second album wrapped wild keyboards around libidinal screeds. Their third and most consistent album further
    out-techs their previous work, but already sounds dated, and not for some obvious retro-reason: the
    industrial hellscape they conjure brings to mind too many Reznorisms and too many straight-to-video fallout
    movies about people in leather fighting in derbymobiles for some weird commodities like amethysts. The
    Faint's a blast live, though, revving up their smoke machines and waving their synth-free hands around like
    a bunch of dang incubuses. They're one of Saddle Creek's treats.</p><p>
    
    Saddle Creek's that Omaha-centric label run by that elfin fellow with the bright eyes. I can't make fun of
    him anymore because I was just wowed by a performance he did with his gazillion piece ensemble, during which
    he kept his afterschool psychodrama to a minimum, except for a spell where he overscratched his arm in
    faux-torment.</p><p>
    
    Joel Peterson can be spotted in photos all over the Internet rubbing or squeezing or holding his arm, too.
    Maybe the gubmint's testing something on them Nebraskans that's giving them a rash, and their anti-consumer
    stance won't yield to facilitate the purchase of some Benadryl. Or maybe Peterson's arm is tired from
    programming all this percussive racket for this Broken Spindles project.</p><p>
    
    There's always something kind of test tube baby about laptopica, but Peterson found interesting ways to
    grant his record some organic textures; though a bit of the disc was composed using Reason software and
    sounds to some degree like what you'd expect in a Faint instrumental piece, the album benefits from guest
    guitarists, live bells, chimes and odd instruments, and some burbly-gurgly-crackly undertones that link
    several tracks, occasionally reminiscent of crinkling fabric or a palpitating heart.</p><p>
    
    The disc is too propulsive to be background music, but too modest to be your evening's main event. When the
    songs slow down (see ""The Oldest Accident"") they unfold fluidly and not unlike patches of Tortoise's
    <i>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</i>, bringing to mind a visit to the world's hippest indoor aquarium.
    The slithering jackhammer ""Connection in Progress"" is the antithesis of the mellow material, with its
    grinding beats and frenetic guitars (listen for some Iron Maiden polish-reewwl scattered throughout). The
    beginning of ""Twitching and Restless"" is perfect for a watching miserable retirees and pregnant smokers
    trigger their car alarms in a depressing parking lot, until its last nine minutes, when it erupts into a
    digital slurry.  Sounds like Mad Max using a Jiffy Lube's equipment to perform orthodontics in Voltron's
    womb.  Or maybe like Chernobyl's hedges being trimmed by a 767 piloted by vomiting zomborgs having a marital
    squabble.</p><p>
    
    So I'm getting all into the album, and a friend starts trashing it; some of her best lines were: ""Whip out
    the glowsticks, we're going to a Tampa nightclub""; ""This must be what plays during the gripping chase scene"";
    and ""Didn't Sam Prekop release this four years ago?""  Ah well. I predict that we'll lose Joel Peterson to
    scoring-- Broken Spindles sprang from an attempt to soundtrack a skateboard vid, and at live appearances,
    he's playing the music as accompaniment to a film. I think he's got a miniature monolith in him yet, though,
    provided Broken Spindles survives the ""Damaged Goods"" tour with Crooked Fingers, Burning Airlines, and Twisted
    Sister.</p></div>"|956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/956-broken-spindles/|6.9|William Bowers

    this disc up your nose.  Don't suppose, either, that The Blow-- aka Khaela Maricich, one of many female voices
    that have popped up on records by the Microphones-- runs in the same pastoral/naturalist vein as its parent
    band.  No, Maricich was thinking of another connotation entirely when renaming herself, and, judging from
    her third release, it's just about all she thinks about.  More succinct and a hell of a lot more direct
    about her fixations than Maricich's previous touring moniker (the backhandedly suggestive Get the Hell Out of
    the Way of the Volcano), the name also belies <i>Bonus Album</i>'s sometimes playfully, sometimes annoyingly
    juvenile approach to music-- and sex.</p><p>
    
    Maricich's last two releases were primarily stripped-down acoustic affairs, but <i>Bonus Album</i> brings in
    more accompaniment in an attempt to expand her horizons.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of fruitless
    groping around for a sound here.  The more minimal songs, consisting only of Maricich's squeaky but serviceable
    multi-tracked voice, are maddeningly solipsistic; ""She Buried Herself in the Air"" and ""Sing Like Kyle"" (as in Kyle Field of <i>another</i> Microphones-related
    project, Little Wings), are too underdeveloped and formless to make an impression, while ""The Touch-Me"" struts
    along convincingly but gets bogged down in retreaded automobile imagery.   In ""The Moon is There, I Am Here"",
    the observations don't get any deeper than the title, and the affectedly awkward, clipped, Difranco-ish
    phrasing doesn't change that one bit.</p><p>
    
    There's hope, though.  Maricich's scientific side gets a better airing on ""The Democracy of Small Things"",
    where an interesting device (she converses with her own molecules in an attempt to get her urges in agreement)
    and a feverish synthesizer pulse pleasantly collide.  And ""Some Chocolates"" could be a standard for weird
    little girls everywhere, with Microphones cohort Mirah leading an odd, insanely catchy pat-a-cake chant: ""I brought you back
    some chocolates/ But they weren't made of chocolates/ They were made of the shapes of my mouth when I'm
    talking to you.""   The occasionally blatant come-ons and ""jump-rope rhythms"" recall Liz Phair, though Maricich's
    best shots aren't nearly as troubled or troubling as, say, ""I'll fuck you till your dick is blue"".  At most,
    Maricich is like Phair's little sister doing anatomically correct crayon drawings for you to hang on the
    fridge.</p><p>
    
    Ooooh, and Phil Elvrum's come to play!  And he brought his drums.  He deserves cookies, cookies, cookies for
    joining his Microphones-mate on ""Watch the Water Roll Up"", a loose, danceable rhumba tune whose fuller
    production (pianos, bass, Elvrum's percussion cornucopia) and unpredictable structural swerves provide a
    welcome change of pace, not just from the rest of the record, but from the original acoustic-and-voice
    version which appeared on Maricich's 2000 debut, <i>Everyday Examples of People Facing Straight Into the
    Blow</i>.
    
    .  The confounding ""Little Sally Tutorial"", however, brings us right back to where we
    started.  Maricich deadpans the instructions for a kid's song-and-dance game, and, with most of the K Records
    family joining in, it sounds like Summer Camp for the Prematurely Ironic.  Sure, it's kinda funny to hear
    Calvin Johnson's basso profundo in a song you might've sung as a kid, but here, as on most of the album, a
    very subjective sort of nostalgia is at work.  At summer camp, Maricich was probably making out with some
    prepubescent hottie behind the equipment shed.  Me, I was sent home early after eating a tainted corndog.

So let's just get
    them out of the way right off the bat, okay?  Let's see: warm, hazy, ambient, spacey, dreamy, textured,
    soothing.  Kinda sounds like a Brian Eno production of <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</i>, but it
    sets up a pretty clear model of what Melochrome dishes out on <i>This is Motion</i>.</p><p>
    If you're an especially astute listener, you can probably already call the instruments in play: heavily
    reverbed guitar, warbling Rhodes electric piano, whisper-brushed drums, and occasional sound effects and
    rattles for atmosphere.  Throw in a sense of pacing learned from Low and Sigur Rós records and a syrupy
    croon like Prekop's before he met Joe Camel, and you've got yourself the downright wooze-inducing Melochrome
    sound.  The album title and the almost-title track ""Music for Motion"" might claim ""we've got music made of
    motion,"" but I'm here to tell you-- it's a goddamn <i>lie!</i></p><p>
    Of course, motion isn't typically the aim of this kind of music, so despite that ridiculous assertion, we're
    all good.  In fact, <i>This is Motion</i>'s forty minutes do exactly what the band surely intends it to do,
    that being to erect the sonic equivalent of green tea, a foot massage, and a hot face towel.  The quartet
    might not shift out of quiet vamp gear for the album's entire duration, but that just makes all the pieces
    of flair that much more noticeable.  Take the brass punctuation of ""So We're Finally Moving On"", for
    instance, or the subtly tape-tweaked cymbal bed on ""Seaside Instrumental"".</p><p>
    Like most bands of their ilk, Melochrome tends to dart back and forth across the line separating easy
    listening from E-Z listening.  Opening their mouths usually doesn't help; ""Catalina Girls"" features a
    female lead vocal from the Sade school, and the hushed lullaby stylings used on ""Out Late"" may insure heavy
    rotation at the dentist's office.  The horns are also never again utilized quite as well as they are on ""So
    We're Finally Moving On"", taking on a sort of unnecessary constant cascade throughout ""Stereo City"" and
    ""Catalina Girls"" that'll nag your thoughts for weeks as to what post-rock ditty it emulates.  (I'll save you
    the trouble: it's Tortoise's ""Swing from the Gutters"".)</p><p>
    So I'd recommend <i>This is Motion</i>, but only for certain situations.  Never listen to <i>This is Motion</i>
    before 2:30pm, except on Sundays; <i>This is Motion</i> is for sunsets, not sunrises.  If you'd like to make
    out to <i>This is Motion</i>, wait until the fourth week of the relationship, unless your date is from Georgia,
    in which case you should probably wait until the fifth.  All mixtapes containing tracks from <i>This is
    Motion</i> should contain only sepia-toned artwork.  And be sure to use at least two of the above-mentioned
    required adjectives when endorsing it to friends.</p></div>"|5213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5213-this-is-motion/|7.3|Rob Mitchum

    Schwarzenbach uncovered new potential in the energetic, ear-catching progressions of <i>Orange Rhyming
    Dictionary</i>.  It was a running gag between me and my friends to dismiss the album with a simple, ""Yeah,
    but it's no Jawbreaker""-- but it was just a joke; the promise of <i>Dictionary</i>'s easy hooks was
    self-evident.  In the span of just one album, though, what began as a simple joke became a grim portent;
    not only was the abysmal <i>Four Cornered Night</i> ""not Jawbreaker"", but it wasn't much of anything else,
    either.  <i>Night</i>'s impossibly bland pop banality was so cautious and inoffensive, so ""common denominator"",
    it stood a better chance at being elected for the senate than pleasing the fans.</p><p>
    
    If anyone had any doubts that Schwarzenbach blew his load on <i>Orange Rhyming Dictionary</i>, <i>Perfecting
    Loneliness</i> will likely only confirm your fears.  It's a sad example of a few decent arrangements being
    recycled and regurgitated until, by the end of the album, there's nothing left but pre-chewed, partially
    digested gunk.  There are few inspired moments, but the bright spots come mostly at the beginning, and
    afterwards, the album slips slowly into a seemingly infinite loop of predictable refrains and forced emotion.
    Try as I might, I couldn't avoid the sensation of feeling my opinion of the album decrementing in .1's and
    .2's with every passing track.</p><p>
    
    There's a little to look forward to, though: the first four tracks alone beat the pants off of the entirety
    of <i>Four Cornered Night</i>.  ""The Frequency"" opens the album on a high note with a fascinating blend of
    Jets to Brazil's old, melodic power-pop and a hint of Built to Spill's searing instrumental prowess.
    Similarly, the tuneful malevolence of the title track is genuinely refreshing before turning full-circle
    to a lazy forgiveness.  It's a single in the truest sense of the word-- single-handedly encompassing the
    breadth of pop attitudes, with all the requisite emotional highs and lows, in a league all by itself.</p><p>
    
    Each of those cuts swell past the five-minute mark, though even with my short attention span, it didn't
    bother me.  What did is that <i>Perfecting Loneliness</i>' shameless filler material is similarly bloated
    with extended choral refrains and lengthy outros, ushering these weak, lifeless tracks past the realm of
    boredom and into true, four-cylindered wankery.  ""Autumn Walker"", for example, nearly separates itself from
    homogeneity with an incredible grinding guitar swell and stirring chorus, but as three minutes of interest
    slowly drag into five minutes of broken-record repetition, its standout characteristics eventually get
    lost in the shuffle.  Few bands can boast albums that don't contain at least some padding, but why someone
    would choose to drag their obvious missteps out to epic lengths is incomprehensible.</p><p>
    
    To round out the tragic self-importance of these slothful juggernauts, Schwarzenbach contributes his
    traditionally sincere, emotive vocal stylings.  Usually, he's fine; a little overbearingly plaintive at
    times, but okay nonetheless.  His lyrical ability has fallen off some over the years, though, and when
    lyrics like ""God is dumb/ God is great/ Does he loves us all the same?/  Are we okay?"" (from ""Psalm"") are
    combined with a delivery so pleadingly earnest it could go to camp.  If these faults were isolated incidents,
    they wouldn't be as crippling, but too often here they hit all at once like Zangief-style triple-combos.</p><p>
    
    As Schwarzenbach sings on ""The Frequency"", ""When the measure of your work/ Is the measure of your worth/
    Then you'd better make it work.""  If Jets to Brazil heeded their own advice, they might bolster their
    slumping stock and try to recapture some of the invention of their debut rather than comfortably descend
    into pop mediocrity.  Though numbers like ""You're the One"" and ""Cat Heaven"" give <i>Perfecting Loneliness</i>
    the dubious distinction of being less painful than the dental academy root-canal action of <i>Four Cornered
    Night</i>, this isn't the return to form any of us had hoped for.</p></div>"|4249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4249-perfecting-loneliness/|5.2|Eric Carr

    showcase for ""up and coming"" area bands. Naturally, everyone is skeptical and drunk but for the ringmaster--

    hottest new band to follow in these footsteps... everybody please welcome... <i>Everybody Uh Oh!</i>""</p><p>
    
    Everybody in the crowd says, ""Uh-oh."" They are being funny, of course, and they laugh at their collective
    joke. A bold, scrappy teenager yells ""uh-oh"" again, but no one laughs, and someone tells him that ""that
    joke has already been done, dude,"" which, in turn, prompts a few scattered laughs.</p><p>
    
    ""No, no, no."" The emcee is already frustrated with these kids, these goddamn kids who wouldn't know talent
    if it unzipped their pants and gave them the best fucking blowjob of their lives. ""That's the name of the

    Everybody moans, ""Ohhhh,"" drawing it out as only disaffected teens can, or will. Then, right on cue, four

    debut, <i>Man Am I Brad</i>, is supposed to be some cross between Neutral Milk Hotel, Smashing Pumpkins, and
    Yo La Tengo.</p><p>
    
    But as head songwriter Jeremy Keller eases into the slowcore of ""Eunice"", an observer finely points out that,
    instead, the band sounds ""like a cross between piss and shit."" Perhaps Keller thinks he can connect with his
    audience with such lines as, ""All the kids are out tonight,"" but he is wrong. As the song drags on past the
    six-minute mark, the hope heard in the lyrics is drowned out by the kids, who are out tonight, and for whom
    all hope of a good time is passing.</p><p>
    
    ""Serious Mode"" is the band's attempt to liven things up. There's a peppy drumbeat and even a tambourine.
    Then the lead singer has to open his mouth again: ""I feel so tired 'cause I'm not awake/ You feel you need
    more."" Then it's all about not stopping: ""It's up to you.""  And he sings this over and over until people
    are blatantly wincing.</p><p>
    
    Everybody Uh-Oh then breaks out its drum machine, first for a inoffensive stab at a Death Cab for Cutie
    jingle, then for a terrible tune that shifts from Magnetic Fields simplicity to like a Hum-like thrasher
    in which Keller asks, ""How will they know that I'm rock 'n' roll?"" Some guy in the back quips, ""We'll be
    sure to let them know!""</p><p>
    
    Beer cans are being hurled by the time the band plays ""Keeping Up with the Joneses"", in which the group
    approximates ""Cherub Rock""-era Smashing Pumpkins, except with even worse lyrics. ""The Trees of Prentiss"" is
    a better Death Cab try and wouldn't have pissed anyone off if not for lines like, ""Paul says that I waste
    my time and kids bobbing heads is a victimless crime.""</p><p>
    
    The kids don't even stick around for the remaining songs, let alone the next band. They have heard enough
    amateurish, repetitive songwriting for the night and they've got better things to do-- like stand in parking
    lots and take the long way home. Most leave without a word, but the scrappy kid, seeking redemption, yells
    out, ""The next REO Speedwagon, my ass!"" Everyone laughs, and he is perhaps the only one who goes home happy.</p></div>"|2853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2853-man-am-i-brad/|3.3|Ryan Kearney

    bands to whom San Diego's GoGoGo Airheart owes some debts.  The other day, I was reading a music magazine
    that actually started comparing new bands to the Liars, that new act has suffered under so much namedropping
    that you can now use them as shorthand for a whole bunch of other bands: PiL, Gang of Four, etc, etc, etc.
    So rather than play rock paleontologist and dig up old bands that GoGoGo Airheart reminds us of, let's look
    at what makes them different.</p><p>
    
    You can hear echoes of many styles in <i>Exitheuxa</i>, their fourth full-length, but nothing undercuts their
    own sound.  Michael Vermillion and bassist Ashish Vyas swap lead vocals; Benjamin White plays lead guitar,
    sometimes joined by Vermillion; and J Frederic Hough plays drums.  The overall impression is of loose,
    easy-paced rock, back from the beach but ready for business, and injected with some post-punk to make it
    more jagged.  It's not uptight enough to sound spastic or jittery, but at times it gets squirrely-- for
    example, in both singers' wavery, twisted vocals that occasionally (but only <i>occasionally</i>) break or
    yelp.  And there are the guitars, ragged and raucous but locked in a firm power-sharing arrangement with a
    stand-up rhythm section.</p><p>
    
    The album's greatest strength is its easy inventiveness.  The songs go from a reggae beat on ""Witch Hunt"" to
    minute-and-a-half rock blasts like ""Sit and Stare""; Jason Crane's trumpet rings over the sparse guitars and
    bass of ""Nice Up the Dance"", and the organ on ""Meet Me at the Movies"" pastes an accordion-like sound on the
    song's exotic slow pace.  Taken apart, it's surprising how different each of the tracks seem, and more
    surprising, that they fit together seamlessly: instead of throwing a dozen influences in your face, the
    band seems to ease into new tactics and make themselves at home.</p><p>
    
    All that keeps <i>Exitheuxa</i> from being exceptional is that the songwriting, while solid, could use more
    stand-out hooks.  ""Here Comes Attack"" and ""Sincerely P.S."" include some great riffs, ""When the Flesh Hits""
    has a casual but catchy dance beat, and Vyas doesn't play a single dull bassline: many of his parts are
    insidious, especially on ""Nice Up the Dance"" and ""My Baby Has a Gang (Sign Our Hearts)"".  But it's the album
    as a whole that sticks in your mind.  It's extremely cohesive and assured-- the kind of rare disc that can
    justify every strange direction it takes.</p></div>"|3492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3492-exitheuxa/|7.5|Chris Dahlen

    to hate, and a lot of the noise you generally want to turn down.  However,
    they also punch holes through the eardrums you know need some exercise and
    erode the elitist posture you've been meaning to shed for some time now.
    Sightings don't so much impress as oppress with their silo of riffs and
    yelping meltdowns.  Nary a beat passes without the feedback from drums long
    since overdriven in the mix or frantic distortion of guitars having more in
    common with static electricity than even the harshest art-punk assault.
    Even at just 28 minutes, it's a lot to take in one sitting.</p><p>
    
    Still, in some ways this is actually the forgotten sound of a bygone age.
    There was a time when this kind of racket passed muster in corners all
    around as the sound of the future.  Think Lydia Lunch and DNA and you're
    getting there; think early Sonic Youth, Swans and even overachievers like
    Melt-Banana or Sightings' labelmates Lightning Bolt and you're closer.
    It's not that mere abrasion and disgust is the object, but presumably some
    semblance of ""artful purpose"" and maybe even a pinch of ye olde ""rock"" for
    flavor.  No Wave in color?  Math-punk that failed math?  A whole lotta
    commotion?  Mix them up and call it a debut.</p><p>
    
    Even though singer/guitarist Mark Morgan often opts for the aged caterwaul
    of punk glory, some of the best stuff on the record happens when he plays it
    smooth.  ""Wax Doors"" (at four minutes, practically an epic on this album) not
    only finds his voice in check, but locks into a groove that would make
    very, very early Can proud.  The mid-tempo hacking by drummer John Lockie
    is wildly distorted, but unlike many songs here, there's space to breathe:
    little details like the off-beat guitar shrieks and the almost dub-like bass
    resonance come through where they might not on noisier tracks like ""Made the
    Menu"" or spastic opener ""Two Thoughts"".</p><p>
    
    At points, as on the almost painfully raucous ""45 on the Back"", it's difficult
    to distinguish who's doing what to which instrument, such is the general chaos.
    Unfortunately, where Sightings clean up in sonic overload, they fall short in
    dynamic contrast.  In short, all explosions and no... well, almost anything else,
    make for a monolithic ride.</p><p>
    
    Beyond Sightings, you might do yourself a favor and check out No New York,
    or any number of punky dadaists from Japan.  It's entirely possible that
    Sightings may travel down a similar path to many of those musicians, and
    shape their sound into something as vital, or least less haphazard.  Until
    then, hang on to your eardrums and be prepared for a lashing.  Or not.</p></div>"|7142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7142-sightings/|4.6|Dominique Leone

    have out-Who'd The Who, if given a chance.  But we all know what came in their wake: Bob lost the magic,
    and ""The Captain"" entered stage left.  Most people attribute that sudden decline in quality to the departing
    of cohort Tobin Sprout, who had been with Pollard for a good long time and is theorized to have been the only
    member of Bob's ever-revolving backing band with the balls to veto Pollard's duds.  Pollard himself, it's
    suspected, can hardly tell the difference between his ""My Valuable Hunting Knife""s and his ""A Big Fan of the
    Pigpen""s, which might explain why this disc is actually <i>better</i> than <i>Universal Truths and Cycles</i>.</p><p>
    
    But it's always darkest before the release of <i>Universal Truths and Cycles</i>, sports fans, and the
    wealth of excellent material surrounding those sessions proves that Pollard's legendary ability to trip
    over solid gold wasn't dead, just sleeping.  Not only did the album assuage some growing doubts, but its
    spillover now threatens to momentarily redeem even the hilarious tragedy of the Fading Captain series.
    <i>The Pipe Dreams of Instant Prince Whippet</i> collects the odds-and-ends left on the cutting room floor
    in the aftermath of <i>UT&amp;C;</i>, and dare I say, Bob hasn't sounded this much like his old self since ""Jane
    of the Waking Universe"".  Why these tracks were left off <i>Universal Truths</i> in favor of obvious filler
    like ""Skin Parade"" and ""The Ids are Alright"" is beyond me.</p><p>
    
    A few of these tracks have already sniffed daylight before (four, to be exact, as b-sides for the four
    seven-inches released as <i>Universal Truths</i> singles), and no doubt, someone, somewhere, is already
    grumbling that they're ""no 'Echoes Myron'"".  Which is fine-- it's not like I'm innocent of this kind of
    indie codgerism-- but it's a bit like saying, ""Mother Theresa was okay, but you know, she's no God or
    anything.""  Of <i>course</i> nothing on <i>Pipe Dreams</i> hits on that level.  But there's no doubt that
    Pollard's recent material <i>is</i> on par with some of his pre-TVT stuff, particularly the better moments
    of <i>Mag Earwhig!</i>, and even certain highlights of <i>Under the Bushes, Under the Stars</i>.</p><p>
    
    This disc is evidence that Pollard has finally, gracefully adjusted to GBV's post-Sprout period.  The arena
    rock tendencies of recent work are softened, and soaring, anthemic choruses are largely neglected in favor
    of rhythmic stompalongs.  But aside from the consistency and digestability of these ten tracks, what makes
    <i>Pipe Dreams</i> a stronger record than <i>Universal Truths and Cycles</i> is the album's composition--
    this being an ""odds and sods"" compilation, none of it quite coheres.  This disjointed nature is <i>Pipe
    Dreams</i>' greatest strength, and not coincidentally, that of GBV's best work.</p><p>
    
    As I see it, one of the primary failings of the band's recent material-- including much of <i>Universal
    Truths</i>-- is a relative homogeneity that causes otherwise quality songs to bleed together into a mush
    of chiming guitars and cigarette-stained vocals.  That never, ever happens on <i>Pipe Dreams</i>, where
    each track is clear and distinct from the one that comes before.  As a companion piece to <i>Universal
    Truths</i>, it's easy to see where each cut fits into the larger picture, but the total effect of this
    record is far closer to that of early GBV classics, where bizarre, half-assed tracks like ""Yours to Keep""
    and ""Kicker of Elves"" achieved a weirdly compelling power simply through proximity to plain great pop
    songs.</p><p>
    
    Some of the great pop songs included here are the bite-sized ""Stronger Lizards"" and ""For Liberty"", which
    both build to sublime crescendos of power and emotion before fading away less than a minute later.  These
    tracks bear the mark of some of GBV's best work, in that you're left wanting more, despite the knowledge
    that what you just heard was an autonomous unit of songcrafting excellence.  These morsels, however, merely
    set the table for the superlative ""Dig Through My Window"" and the closer ""Beg for a Wheelbarrow.""  The
    former is a laidback pop reflection replete with key changes and a subtle orchestral backing, while the
    massive three-minute closer ""Beg for a Wheelbarrow"" has Pollard shouting, ""Dig a deeper hole/ And
    then you'll feel better,"" over a climax of searing guitars and mounting drum fills.  <i>Pipe Dream</i>'s
    crown jewels are <i>such</i> a return to form that I almost imagined Tobin Sprout's voice among their
    backing choruses.</p><p>
    
    This, of course, is the rare collection in a Fading Captain series which has been-- and will undoubtedly
    continue to be-- incredibly patchy.  Still, this disc implies nothing if not potential for more of the
    stunning songcraft Pollard built his good name on.  Bob still has ""it"", to my amazement, and some to spare.</p></div>"|3591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3591-pipe-dreams-of-instant-prince-whippet-ep/|7.8|Eric Carr

I am one of the dozens of hapless people who's purchased tickets for Ozzfest
    each of the last three years.  Yes, I was one of the people who spent $6 on a plastic goldfish bowl full of
    yeast-flavored piss last year hoping to make forty-five minutes of Chester Bennington more palatable.  But,
    aside from attracting what Bill Hicks might have referred to as America's greatest anti-culture trainwreck,
    Ozzfest has been the only successful metal festival in the United States.</p><p>
    Other than boasting the weakest lineup the festival had seen in the spring and summer of 2002, this white
    trash cash cow was marred by everything from Sharon Osbourne's colon cancer (and Ozzy's subsequent defection),
    to the accidental death of Drowning Pool frontman Dave Williams, to Zakk Wylde collapsing on stage during a
    European stop.   In spite of these tragedies-- or perhaps because of them-- Sweden's Meshuggah found
    themselves thrust to the critical forefront of a lineup sporting names like System of a Down, Andrew WK,
    Adema, and Rob Zombie.  When an erroneously named metal festival suddenly cow-tows to MTV's favorite
    faux-angst trendkill the results promise to be disastrous.</p><p>
    Following a mind-numbing thirty-five minutes from that Mötley Crüe guy with a huge cock, I happened to
    overhear a conversation between two Abercrombie &amp; Fitch-clad metalheads standing a few inches in front of
    me:</p><p>
    Yuppie Spawn 1: ""Tommy Lee was awesome.  I was, like, holy shit, he kicked so much ass.""</p><p>
    Yuppie Spawn 2: ""Oh totally.  I think those Meshugenah [sic] guys were pretty hard too.""</p><p>
    Yuppie Spawn 1: ""Yeah, those guys were okay but they weren't nearly as hard as P.O.D are gonna be.  You've
    seen their video for 'Youth of the Nation', right?  Word.  That's deep.  And that Christian shit is off the
    hook.""</p><p>
    Other than serving as a sweeping argument for the decline of western civilization, this conversation seems
    to echo the bastardization that has beset heavy music in recent years and, to an extent, forever.  For
    better or worse, watered-down minor key riffs with coherent vocals have become a fixture of the alternative
    metal scene.  Meshuggah fly directly in the face of the status quo where mainstream metal is concerned,
    albeit in a way that's guaranteed to send our Abe &amp; Fitch pals screaming for their Paxil.  Sure, Meshuggah's
    2002 release, <i>Nothing</i>, doesn't redefine artistic parameters-- this band is not about innovation.
    Sweden's seminal metal amalgam has remained true to their ideology since forming in 1987, churning out
    beefy, intricate hard rock songs with off-kilter tempos, ample polyrhythms, and caustic vocals.
    Incorporating elements of Pantera, Cannibal Corpse, Immolation, and Nile, <i>Nothing</i> is decidedly all
    Meshuggah for fifty solid minutes.</p><p>
    Refining their sound to a more relaxed musical approach than recent efforts <i>Destroy Erase Improve</i> and
    <i>Chaosphere</i>, Meshuggah have retained all of their muscle but with more spacious arrangements.  ""Straws
    Pulled at Random"" spotlights the band's talent for hammering out precise cadence amidst waves of ambient
    eight-string guitar tonalities and slowly morphing repetitiveness.  Guitarist Frederik Thordendal slips
    into an eerie romantic solo while drummer Tomas Haake, bassist Gustaf Hielm, and rhythm guitarist Mårten
    Hagström lock into a frenetic groove.  As the rhythm section's dissonance grows, Thordendal's harmonics
    evolve masterfully, challenging the listener to dissociate melody from repetition.</p><p>
    ""Rational Gaze"" builds upon a similar dynamic with the guttural sludge of vocalist Jens Kidman occupying a
    more significant share of the canvas, similar in style to Slayer's Tom Araya circa <i>Hell Awaits</i>.
    Although speed is sacrificed (a stark contrast to other bands of their ilk), Meshuggah relies on 7/4 tempos
    and muted chromatics to create a feeling of kinetic energy without deviating radically from a rigid,
    percussive structure.  Again, Thordendal provides the melodic counterpoint with solos that seemingly
    deconstruct the band's groove and inject an entirely new dimension of high-frequency atonality.</p><p>
    ""Perpetual Black Second"" pounds through a spasmodic grind of alternating buildups and breakdowns, teasing
    resolution.  Drummer Tomas Haake is the complete opposite of many of his metal counterparts-- it's his
    respect for groove that keeps Meshuggah accessible.  Where most metal drummers would attempt to dazzle with
    blistering kickdrums and heart-stopping licks, Haake is confident enough in his feel and sense to employ a
    minimalist philosophy, thus providing the rest of the band room to establish patterns without the threat of
    a drum deluge.</p><p>
    Taking the notion of rigidity to another level, ""Closed Eye Visuals"" finds Haake exercising subtle polyrhythm
    against <i>Nothing</i>'s most methodic and brutal attack.  Almost as certain as the track is to test the
    patience of its listeners (clocking in at 7\xBD minutes), the track represents Meshuggah's most challenging
    offering to date.  Muscling through a blitzkrieg of nuanced textures and tones, Thordendal finds himself in
    full Dimebag Darrell mode as the stilted rhythm throbs and undulates beneath him.  Here, Meshuggah display
    their obvious progressive metal instincts, cementing ambient drones against a wall of seething power chords.</p><p>
    Owing in part to the Philip K Dick-flavored lyrics, Meshuggah have found themselves lumped among the ranks
    of ""math-metal"" fodder like Soilent Green, Coalesce, and the Dillinger Escape Plan.  There's little doubt
    that Meshuggah is attempting to paint a fairly bleak landscape of technology run amok.   Unfortunately for
    the band, the banal and often garbled language detracts from their talent.  On ""Organic Shadows"", we have,
    ""My mind resigns to defeat/ Internal razors activated/ Slashing through unprocessed thought/ The severance
    of self complete,"" lines that could easily have been authored by Poppy Z Brite, and the cringe-worthy
    ""Bitter taste/ The wombs of claws call me/ Filth rips them open/ The stillborn start to move lidless eyes
    twitching beneath a sheet of rot.../ They reach out, they want to kiss/ It matters not..."" from ""Nebulous"".
    Still, aside from the ponderous corpse paint-soaked sci-fi schlock, Meshuggah have unleashed what amounts
    to a viciously crafted effort without the rampant pretension of their intellectual metal brothers.</p></div>"|5249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5249-nothing/|8.1|Isaiah Violante

Some bands hit you with it like a blunt object; Xiu Xiu wields theirs like a supersharp wakizashi.
    The Asian percussion, junkyard chimes and jagged electronics that surround Jamie Stewart's overwrought
    vocals are so over-the-top distressed, they'll either rivet you or fray your last nerve.</p><p>
    
    There are many ways to hate Xiu Xiu.  You can criticize the sincerity of Stewart's performance.  <i>Nobody</i>
    gets that depressed: in our culture, we experience unhappiness but we don't (figuratively) vomit all over
    ourselves to express it, so it's partly his fault if he seems somewhat insincere.  Then there's the aesthetic
    problem: the piercing first tracks of their debut, <i>Knife Play</i>, drove some people out of the room
    before they even cared where Stewart was coming from.  And while some would find them too noisy, noise
    geeks play harder stuff than this at Sunday brunch.</p><p>
    
    But to sweat all that is to forget that sometimes, it's fun just to bang on stuff and shriek, and that's
    where Xiu Xiu excels.  Their sonic palette won't make waves in the new music world, but it sounds
    exhilarating in this brutally expressive, and often catchy, avant-pop context.  Now, only months after the
    release of their debut, Xiu Xiu has issued an EP, <i>Chapel of the Chimes</i>, and once again, they deftly
    mix chaos with concentration to create pieces that sound spontaneous, yet are intensely precise.  And the
    emotional extremes are cathartic in their own theatrical, witch doctored-way.</p><p>
    
    On ""I Am Center of Your World"", Stewart sings like Bryan Ferry after twelve hours of torture.  It's like
    they just yanked the electrodes off his privates and handed him the mike.  He eeks out the lyrics in a
    faltering voice that's strained, believable, and yet also, strangely, romantically expressive.  He's helped
    by the music, which is darkly fragile and fleetingly beautiful.  A low, rapid-heartbeat bassline runs under
    the song, and a staggering piano and flourishes of chimes break out of the near-silence like a burst of
    light before he passes out.  In contrast, ""Jennifer Lopez (Sweet Science Mix)"" is blaringly loud and
    single-mindedly abrasive.  Raw-bowed cello, a drum kit and piercing electronics burn around Stewart's
    indecipherable exclamations.  The song's multi-layered arrangement melts down to a concise attack.</p><p>
    
    But the middle tracks flag.  ""10-Thousand-Times-A-Minute"", solid but less remarkable, delivers its melody
    through an echoed, blatting sound like farting into a cistern.  Stewart again sounds pained and strained,
    but he's at odds with the mushy context.  The next track is career-record quiet: ""King Earth, King Earth"",
    a thin watercolor where the different tones float through too easily.  It's subtle and nearly peaceful, but
    too vague to make an impression.</p><p>
    
    So, after all that, who couldn't use a nice cover song?  Xiu Xiu closes with Joy Division's ""Ceremony"", the
    most ecstatic track on the album.  They maintain the tempo and spirit of the original, but boldly replace
    the guitars and drums with-- guess what!-- harsh electronics and a crateful of percussion.  Stewart, keyed
    up to shrieks, seems to act out everything that might have been going on in a morose Ian Curtis' head.  If
    nothing else, it's a confident reworking.  I can't speak for whether Joy Division fans would find this
    creative or repellant, but I think it's a raucous, chimy good time.  Sure, Curtis was more convincingly
    miserable-- but look what happened to him.</p></div>"|8824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8824-chapel-of-the-chimes-ep/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

    music includes recent faves The Books, The Notwist and the perennially hip
    Mouse on Mars.  However, despite the organic source material that goes into
    his music, he actually belongs to an eccentric breed of one-man digital
    alchemists like Fennesz and Ekkehard Ehlers.  Hrvatski (born Keith Fullerton
    Whitman) might have a background in freeform guitar skronk and amplifier
    noise, but his methods betray a fascination with the synthetic and
    processed.  In fact, he studied ethnomusicology at Berklee, and while that
    may not mean much to non-musos, it does expose the contradiction of someone
    who would be writing academic treatises on the importance of preserving
    indigenous folk music if he weren't so interested in fucking with Winston
    Brothers breaks.</p><p>
    
    1998's <i>Oiseaux 1996-1998</i> found Hrvatski running his breaks fascination
    into the ground, and then some.  By no means was the album repetitive, though
    it could be maddeningly skittish, as if his rule of thumb was to make sure no
    two measures of music were identical.  As a result, some tracks that might
    have been jams in their first drafts became baroque symphonettes, perhaps more
    impressive than viscerally moving.  That said, it was a detail freak's fantasy,
    and it prompted many frustrated fans to wait patiently for the official follow-up.</p><p>
<i>Swarm &amp; Dither</i> is the result of almost four years of waiting,
    experimenting, writing, and more waiting.  By Hrvatski's own admission, a
    lot has changed since his last full-length offering, and this record is a
    culmination of tracks record over the duration.  Because of that, the sound
    is often reminiscent of his last record, most notably on the handful of tracks
    recorded just after its completion.  The newer stuff uses a different pallet
    of sounds, but is still noticeably in his style, with restless beat-shifting
    and tendency for acoustic intervention in a medium dominated by computer
    generated blips.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Vatstep DSP"" (a fan fave since its 1999 debut as a Kid606
    ""remix""), plays a similar role as ""Routine Exercise"" did on <i>Oiseaux</i>:
    that of the hardcore jam.  Beginning with an explosion of swirling hard
    drive-feedback and radio static, it launches into a beat at once complex
    and goofy-- imagine Merrie Melodies IDM.  Hrvatski's speak-and-spell vocal
    might be the funniest thing ever to appear on a laptop-composed record, and
    the kitten samples are on point.  Similarly, ""2nd Zero Fidelity Mandible
    Investigation"" manages to transcend its inherently convoluted construction
    and oompah beat to reveal remarkable attention to detail.  Check the
    tambourine borrowed from the first album; watch that oozing synth patch;
    listen in to over-the-bar beat displacements.  The only drawback-- and a
    minor one, really-- is that both of these tracks sound like they could have
    been on <i>Oiseaux</i>.</p><p>
    
    The digital soundscape that develops into ""Paint It Black"" represents the
    other side of <i>Swarm &amp; Dither</i>, wherein Hrvatski works in the same
    laptop-acoustic hybrid as fellow fusionists Fennesz and The Books.  The
    first half of this tune is not the Rolling Stones song at all, but a
    contemplative guitar figure with assorted glitch effects.  When the proper
    tune starts in, with a drastically altered lead vocal featuring dissonant
    auto-harmonizing, the effects threaten to overtake the arrangement but never
    quite do.  ""Carrot (Hrvatski's Night Vision)"" uses this juxtaposition to
    even better effect, as acoustic guitar and electric piano act as foundation
    for a solemn, wistful clarinet line.  The heavy loop in the background and
    various effects hardly detract from the general ambience.</p><p>
    
    Where the record might misfire for some listeners is when Hrvatski abandons
    breaks and beats entirely, as on tunes like ""Anesthetize Thineself"".  If
    you're impatient, you might miss the gorgeous extended outro with guitar and
    synth, because the first half is almost random distorto-glitch along the
    lines of particularly anti-social Warp.  And on ""Echoes"", you'll need an
    ear sympathetic to manic piano accents as the track uses that sound exclusively
    to flesh out polyrhythmic pandemonium, and leads immediately to the hyperactive,
    sometimes jarring ""EWC4"".</p><p>
    
    The record ends with a straight band version of Swedish space-rockers Trad
    Gras och Stenar's ""Tegenborg"".  The rollicking, cheerful strains of this
    tune sound almost comically displaced on this record, and yet there's
    something to it.  <i>Swarm &amp; Dither</i> makes vital noise out of some very
    automated processes, and perhaps ending the album so straightforwardly says
    something about the ideas behind this stuff.  You might assume most new
    electronic music is devoid of that old-fashioned human emotion, but
    Hrvatski's music offers evidence that it can be both intellectual and
    inviting.</p></div>"|3945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3945-swarm-dither/|8.5|Dominique Leone

What sort of person finds the sonic equivalent
    of stock photography fascinating? Crate-digging funkoholics and hipper-than-thou trendoids, that's who. And
    Lo Recordings have four collections of vintage (1975 and earlier) miniatures to satisfy their monophonic
    analog lusts.</p><p>
<i>Further Nuggets</i>, selected by Luke Vibert, comes hard on the heels of his first trawl through the
    catalogs of various production music libraries.  And not only is <i>he</i> at it, but so is Add N to (X)'s
    Barry 7, whose two <i>Connections</i> compilations (also on Lo) mine very similar veins. So is there really
    something more to this sound-library stuff than canned, pastiche, instant-mood snippets? Apparently, the
    likes of David Holmes, Beck, Andy Votel, the Beta Band, and Andy Weatherall think that this library music
    stuff is the shit.</p><p>
    
    Lo Recordings most definitely think so, too. The label has given Vibert a second opportunity to showcase the
    bongo-bop-iest and Moogy-funkiest of the style.  <i>Further Nuggets</i> draws from further afield than his
    first pass, which concentrated on the work of Roger Roger, Nino Nardini, and Eddie Warner, three inspired
    swells making a franc or two at the Ganaro studios in Versailles.  This record features three more examples
    of Roger Roger's craft, ""Perdition"", ""Velvet Clouds"", and ""Sound Industrial 15"". The first is an eerie
    violin, marimba, jazz guitar, and percussion piece that promises more Grand Guignol than it in fact-- thank
    god-- delivers. ""Velvet Clouds"" is so chimingly cheery it could be used to induce a truly gobsmacking Fred
    and Ginger routine in Matt Lauer and Katie Couric. By way of extreme contrast, ""Sound Industrial 15"" is the
    aqua spine bubbles of Two Lone Swordsmen mixed with some sparse Sergio Leone spaghetti Western theme.</p><p>
    
    Apart from Roger Roger's contributions, things get much spottier. Jack Arel and Pierre Dutour's ""Top Rally""
    is a big band doing Blaxploitation funk, while their ""Bumblebees Dance"" sounds like a G-funk version of
    Lenny Kravitz's ""Are You Gonna Go My Way?"". Elsewhere, John Matthews' ""Electro Aggression"" borrows from Morton
    Subotnick, and I imagine a micro-mini'd and fuck-me sling-backed dance troupe getting all interpretive to the
    clavinet disco slop of Richard Demaria's ""Studio 96"". The percussive flute and wah-wah'd guitar of Roger
    Davy's ""Crazy Flute Happy Guitar"" can only mean Huggy Bear's in another wino-startlin', trash-can bashin'
    alleyway car chase through afro'd Harlem. Roger Webb's ""Exotica"" gives you three minutes to walk up to the
    barfly Farrah Fawcett-ish lady in a beige A-line dress, get one more Campari and soda down her neck,
    indicate the sugarloaf trapped your Sta-Press hip-huggers, and get her upstairs to your hotel room for a
    near-zipless fuck.</p><p>
    
    Boosters say that production music is much more than the sonic equivalent of stock photography. They say
    that it's more than a kitschy guilty pleasure. It's a world free from the cult of personality where nameless,
    ego-less talents can express themselves. This would be true from the ass-backward perspective of compilations
    such as <i>Further Nuggets</i>. Hate to be a downer, but being compiled thirty years later by Luke Vibert
    probably wasn't exactly what these musicians were doing their thing for. Far from being the romantic notion
    of production music being a safe haven for reclusive Joe Meeks and Phil Spectors, regular production work
    ensured these musicians regular paychecks for composing and recording adaptable brief mood pieces for sales
    presentations and basement-budget TV programs.</p><p>
    
    The fact that Vibert can present some unquestionable gems here
    is just gravy.  The boosters' appeal to the absence of stardom-seeking personality is an optimist's spin on the fact that this style had to be anonymous
    to fulfill its primary function: unnoticeable background music. Though I'm resistant to embrace production
    music as the latest, greatest fad, I can't deny that Vibert's collection selects and, importantly, deftly
    sequences some real treasures. Vibert makes a compellingly funky case for joining the wankers.</p></div>"|8462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8462-further-nuggets-luke-viberts-selection/|7.2|Paul Cooper

You open a box and pull out a metal and plastic
    gizmo with knobs and joints that looks neat and seems useful... yet you can't figure out <i>what the
    hell it is</i>.  The same thing happened to me when I got Exhaust's new album, <i>Enregistreur</i>: it's
    sitting here in its drab cardboard sleeve, and I have no idea what to do with it.</p><p>
    How does it work?  If you put it in a disc player, it makes noise: a low, muddy moaning sound, with
    rhythmic post-rock instrumentals alongside ambient passages, sometimes becoming an almost mechanical noise,
    like a machine pushing down your street at night when it's too late even to wonder what it's doing out
    there.</p><p>
    It doesn't come with instructions, aside from the playlist.  It doesn't tell you that Exhaust is a trio
    from Montréal.  Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s Aidan Gert plays the drums: he sticks to straight beats that
    mark the songlike sections of the music.  In contrast, Gordon Krieger emits low swollen tones on bass and
    simple, raspy bass clarinet tones that sound like a dying vacuum-cleaner.  Mike Zabitsky's staticky tapes,
    electronics and sound effects scribble gently over Krieger's monotony.</p><p>
<i>Enregistreur</i> works at three speeds: moribund, languid, and brisk.  The faster tracks are more likeable,
    especially ""Voiceboxed"", wherein Gert gets his beat on as the song goes through actual transitions and betrays
    a real and obvious structure.  But others may prefer the abstract passages like the moody ""Gauss"", or ""Ice
    Storm"", where Zabitsky mixes in piercing glitches-- and not disciplined interruptions, but spritzing, loose
    wires, ""what's wrong with my stereo"" noises.</p><p>
    So that's what you get.  But how do you use it?  At first I figured it was a headphones album.  But the deep,
    sudden bass swells need more space.  And it's too slow for background music: playing it in the car made my
    commute feel three hours long.  So I decided it's art music: I sat down in the living room, laid out some
    wine and cheese, and waited chin in hand while it slouched out of my speakers.  But here, too, it keeps
    fading to slower sections that defy my efforts to pay attention.  It didn't take long before I drifted off
    and started flipping through <i>The New Yorker</i> cartoons.  Now that's culture!</p><p>
    And that's when I figured it out: <i>Enregistreur</i> doesn't claim to have a ""purpose"".  Not only doesn't
    it engage the listener, but it's not even trying.  When Gert's playing, the songs clank along like incidental
    noise from a machine; the abstract sections are as faceless as tar.  The whole disc is a kind of information
    underload.  In the text printed on the disc, Gert talks about getting trapped by an ice storm, stuck sitting
    in the dark: ""I realized that it had been way too long since I sat on the couch and did nothing but drink a
    beer and think...""  <i>Enregistreur</i> creates that feeling, as it leaves out cues or markers telling you
    how to listen: it confronts you with a shapelessness that can be refreshingly head-clearing, as basic as
    flexing a muscle to lift your beer, and as minimal as sitting in a room by yourself.</p><p>
    Of course, that may not be the listening experience you're looking for.  As a tool for making a certain kind
    of sound, it definitely fulfills a function.  But as music, it's not too rewarding.</p></div>"|2870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2870-enregistraur/|4.4|Chris Dahlen

    Album #1: hotshot debut<br/>
    Album #2: disappointing sophomore slump<br/>
    Album #3: blatant radio pandering<br/>
    Album #4: slightly more experimental blatant radio-pandering<br/>
    Album #5: departure project<br/>
    Album #6: rock opera</p><p>
    
    Of Montreal apparently slept in on this day of Rock School, however, as their sixth album has been pegged
    in advance as their <fanfare> Singles Album.  No, it's not a soundtrack to Matt Dillon in flannel, but rather
    a collection of self-contained short-short stories-- a departure from their usual hyper-illustrated, album-length
    sugar-high epics.  Of course, in hallowed days of yore, ""single"" would also imply radio play, but in today's
    close-minded climate of your Clear Channel monopoly and your bling-bling and...</fanfare></p><p>
<i>[Join Rob later today in the Crotchety Old Rock Critic chat room for the conclusion of this rant.]</i></p><p>
    
    Accordingly, everything about <i>Adlhils Arboretum</i> is kept somewhat restrained compared to the Of
    Montreal gnomes and pixies' usual habits.  David Barnes' children's book artwork exchanges rainbow explosion
    mini-murals for mere caricatures of band members (examples: Valkyrie, Hindu god, Napoleon) and the longest
    song title is a terse seven words.  Also left off the roster are the calliope segues, the circus orchestra
    arrangements, and the twenty-minute symphonies for solo piano.  Without all these distractions on board,
    the spotlight rests solely on the songwriting abilities of one Mr Kevin Barnes.  Does he rise to the
    challenge?  Survey says!</p><p>
    
    Yes: A smattering of tracks say so, exhibiting a tasty balance between Of Montreal's lyrical world of
    mystery-flavor-popsicle whimsy and shower singalong ditties. Some highlights could've been dissected into
    two or three quality pop songs, like ""Isn't It Nice?"", with its brisk acoustic and accordion illustration
    of pastoral oddness, or ""Kid Without Claws"", about-- well, damned if I know, but it involves a whole
    labyrinth of melodic twists and a bombastic horn-fed chorus.  ""Jennifer Louise"", meanwhile, is about as
    straightforward a composition as we're likely to ever hear out of Barnes, distant-family power-pop that
    borrows an engine from Fountains of Wayne.</p><p>
    
    No: Of Montreal always cuts pretty close to grating, but it's somehow easy to forgive moments of excessive
    cartoonishness when it's set in the context of an entire animated epic.  Set adrift on their own, however,
    songs like ""Pancakes for One"" and ""We Are Destroying This Song"" are especially hard to swallow.</p><p>
    
    Also No: Turning away from their usual concept album gimmickry also exposes their underbelly of influences,
    which, unsurprisingly for an Elephant 6 band, seems 70% comprised of mop-top Brits.  ""Doing Nothing"" cops
    the cluster-riff of ""I Feel Fine"" (but is still a three-quarters good song) and ""Desperately Sulking Sara""
    channels ""Girl""-ish breathlessness.  ""Natalie and Effie in the Park"" swipes Queen's dandy fop material,
    though in my opinion, more people need to rip off Queen, so I'll overlook it.</p><p>
    
    Maybe: A more complex criticism would be to ask the Expos why they seem to equate ""single"" with
    ""guitar-driven"", as Andy Gonzales is given license to noodle all over the majority of <i>Aldhils</i>'
    tracks.  While understatement has never been Of Montreal's superpower, the guitars set on constant solo
    setting during ""An Ode to the Nocturnal Muse"" and ""Old People in the Cemetery"" (the latter even working in
    some Frampton-style Talking Guitar at the end!) is distracting and less fulfilling than their last album's
    piano focus.  <i>Coquelicot and the Absurdly Ridiculously Unfortunately Lengthy Album Title</i> somehow
    sneaked onto my 2001 list as a (seemingly) last gasp of my E6 fandom, but <i>Aldhils Arboretum</i> and
    its inverted career-path singles focus disappoints.</p></div>"|5953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5953-aldhils-arboretum/|6.1|Rob Mitchum

    of genres, Don Caballero never made the same album twice.  Credit that accomplishment
    to the dual geniuses whose constant interpersonal tension powered and drove the band:
    drummer-cum-hulking brute Damon Che, and calc-minded guitar hero Ian Williams. Up
    until their final studio effort, <i>American Don</i>, Che and Williams continued to
    push and innovate upon an unparalleled brand of energetic, artistic and unpredictable
    math-rock. But like all good things that I never had the chance to see live, Don Cab
    came to a premature end, punctuated symbolically by a dramatic van wreck just before
    the band were to play their coda in Detroit. As they say, what burns never returns.</p><p>
    Since parting ways with Don Cab, Damon Che has teamed up with two veterans of the
    noise-rock scene-- guitarist Agostina Tilotta and vocalist Giovanna Cacciola of the
    Sicilian group Uzeda-- and bassist Matthew Taylor to form his new band, Bellini. After
    adding some songs, and producer Steve Albini (who previously worked on Don Cab's <i>For
    Respect</i> and <i>American Don</i>, and Uzeda's <i>Different Section Wires</i>), the
    quartet had recorded <i>Snowing Sun</i>.  And despite the noteworthy artistic legacy
    preceding it, the record manages to set itself apart from its history and make a
    compelling statement of its own.</p><p>
    The general approach of <i>Snowing Sun</i> resembles the technicality of Don Cab,
    simplified and blended with the shrill tones and avant-garde delivery of Uzeda.
    The guitar/drum/bass interplay is tight, but far less painstakingly composed and
    complex than that of Don Cab, and far less frantic. What you have instead is
    something a bit rougher tonally, but easier on the attention span. Rather than
    seven different sections with five different riffs, four time-changes, and an
    unsettling morass of polyrhythms, Bellini hits you with only a few jagged, biting,
    hand-picked riffs.  It's still herky-jerky, but you immediately get a feel for what
    the band is doing-- it doesn't require multiple listens to figure out.</p><p>
    With Bellini, Che isn't quite the focus of attention that he was with his former
    band; although he doesn't exactly stay in the pocket, his playing is much more
    restrained. The point instead seems to be to lock-in with Tilotta and Taylor,
    which they manage with great success on tracks like ""Furious"", which warms up
    slowly until the band reaches a rolling, mathy-Sabbath energy. Still, Che has
    his own reel of flailing highlights, as on ""We Crossed the Ocean to See the
    Snowing Sun"", where he swiftly pounds out a double-pedaled bridge into the final
    closing jam, and ""The Best Song on the Starship"", which itself closes with a
    full-band freak-out.</p><p>
    Much of the simplified approach can be blamed on the presence of a vocalist.
    After all, it's damn nigh impossible to sing-- even whistle-- along to
    math-rock.  Not that Cacciola really sings.  Hers is more of an accented,
    Björkish scream-sing approach, a theatrical vector for her oblique, poetic
    lyrics (""That's my offer, that's all I have/ Coral, starfishes, seahorses"";
    ""It seems like blood, but it's the water of a flame/ It'll turn into skin
    and breath for my rebirth""). Because of her accent, Cacciola's bizarre lyrics
    are indecipherable without a lyric sheet.  Oddly, though, it lends Bellini an
    inexplicable artistic credibility-- sort of like subtitles.</p><p>
    Besides for the aforementioned ""We Crossed the Ocean"" and ""Furious"", ""Rut
    Row"" and ""Patience and Passion in Brown Gloves"" stand out as bullseyes. ""Rut
    Row"" opens with a sharp, treble-heavy guitar riff and rolling, propulsive
    drum accompaniment, leaving little empty space. The busy opening sequence
    sets up a syncopated breakdown, with Cacciola shouting the appropriately
    aggressive chorus, ""Out of here, out of his cage/ Totally naked, uncovered
    and insane."" ""Patience and Passion in Brown Gloves"", meanwhile, winds through
    an off-center, midtempo math-verse until all four musicians find a funky
    lock-step to drive home a cathartic set of rhythmic jabs.</p><p>
    Put all of the pieces together, and this is one cohesive, coherent son of a
    bitch. Eccentric and avant-garde, with a kick in the ass courtesy of the drummer.
    It's an incredibly rare thing for ex-members of genre-defining bands to release
    records that rival the ones released by their former groups, but <i>Snowing Sun</i>
    has easily trumped anything Uzeda ever released, and it comes damn close to
    equaling Don Cab's earliest material.  Provided that Bellini continue to refine
    and master their sound, they may prove to be more vital than either.</p></div>"|641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/641-snowing-sun/|8.2|Brad Haywood

    ever-fashionable old-school vibe.  And it's true: their style does
    borrow heavily from the genre's pioneers.  But one thing I've always
    admired about the group is that, despite their success in the mainstream,
    they've continued to adhere to underground values.  Their audience may
    drive SUV's and worry about SAT's, but J5 themselves came together at the
    Good Life, a true-skool cafe that, for years, served as the epicenter of
    LA hip-hop.  Naturally, their pedigree doesn't excuse their recent falloff,
    but it at least lends them more authenticity than a lot of other underground
    groups.</p><p>
    
    But let's get to what you came here wondering about: whether <i>Power in
    Numbers</i> returns Jurassic 5 to that dope-as-fuck old-school revival style
    they came with on their debut EP, or if it's a too-comfortable retread of
    the ready-for-M2 formulas that turned <i>Quality Control</i> from what
    could have been one of tightest joints of 2000 into a homogenized backpacker
    retreat.</p><p>
    
    After a brief intro produced by Cut Chemist, the album kicks off proper with
    ""Freedom"".  Although Nu Mark's downtempo production is more than adequate,
    the album would have benefited from a stronger introduction that bumped a
    little harder.  As it so happens, we don't really get anything to grab hold
    of until the fourth track, ""Break"", which also, not so coincidentally, marks
    Cut Chemist's first real track.</p><p>
    
    While the J5 emcees rarely have anything interesting to say, their flows-- and
    particularly Charlie 2na's-- sound nice on a strictly phonetical tip, a similar
    dynamic to those of the old-school emcees they're clearly trying to parody.
    This works a lot better when a worthwhile producer's lacing the track with a
    fat, uptempo beat that's able to steal the focus away from the lyrics; it's
    when the slower tracks come up, and we're actually made to listen to what
    the emcees are saying and not just <i>how</i> they're saying it, that we run
    into trouble.</p><p>
    
    After another brief interlude produced by Cut Chemist, a pair of old-school
    legends, Percy P and Big Daddy Kane, step up to the mic on the very nice ""A
    Day at the Races"".  The bassline is absolutely smokin', and Cut Chemist
    lifts a tight sample from the legendary David Axelrod.  Big Daddy Kane steals
    the lyrical spotlight as he declares that he's still ""Gucci dressin'"" and
    warns that ""you out of your league like Jordan in baseball"".  It should also
    be noted that, sandwiched between Kane and Percy P, Charlie 2na steps up his
    game and remarkably holds his own.  It's no secret that Charlie's the lyrical
    glue that holds Jurassic together, but he really shows improvement on this album.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, ""What's Golden"", the album's first single, finds J5 returning
    to dangerously familiar territory.  For the chorus, the emcees sing, ""We're
    not ballin' or shot callin'/ We take it back to the day of yes y'allin'."" The
    first time J5 expressed their desire to ""take it back"", it was dope.  But
    they've covered this ground so many times now that I'm wondering now if they've
    got an obsessive disorder that forces them to repeat these sentiments <i>ad
    nauseam</i>.</p><p>
    
    This formulaically old-school approach is both J5's greatest asset and worst
    liability.  Those of you who love this trait, and aren't turned off by the
    group's non-threatening demeanor and positive pose, will probably dig <i>Power
    in Numbers</i>.  But if you prefer your hip-hop with a little more kick, you
    might want to dig deeper into the still-vibrant LA hip-hop scene.  <i>Numbers</i>

    Neil ""Michael"" Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema have said that although the album itself wasn't composed while
    under the influence (a dubious statement to say the least), it was ""quality-tested"" while high on such
    colorful narcotic selections as marijuana, LSD, speed, heroin, and more.  Alternately sounding like a subway
    ride inside a television inside an earthquake inside the end of the world and a pounding death rhythm of
    apocalyptic <i>now</i>, <i>Twin Infinitives</i>' greatest achievement may be its dissimilarity to any other
    recorded material ever.</p><p>
    
    Now that Royal Trux's new joint, <i>Hand of Glory</i>-- really a ""lost album"" from the late 80s-- has hit
    the shelves, our chance to sit down and seriously inhale some fresh <i>slowness</i> is upon us.  Though it's
    of the same era as <i>Twin Infinitives</i>, the two records are stylistically nothing alike-- <i>Twin
    Infinitives</i> was more an electronic music composition than it was a rock album; <i>Hand of Glory</i> is
    half-rock, half-musique concrete.  Of course, it takes people interested enough in discovering and divulging
    the secrets of the postmortem subconscious, like Neil and Jennifer, to stretch these classifications to
    their very boundaries, but Royal Trux were nothing if not fearless.</p><p>
    
    The album is cut in half by sides-- two long tracks, one segmented, one not.  The first side, ""Domo des
    Burros (Two Sticks)"", seems a meditation on the drum machine-heavy track ""(Edge of the) Ape Oven"" from
    <i>Twin Infinitives</i>.  Layering a Suicide-esque drum machine over palindromic guitars and the battling
    voices of Hagerty and Herrema, it initially sounds like token Trux behavior, but a closer listen reveals
    that it falls entirely outside of that spectrum.  It speeds up and slows down, waxes lysergic, and then
    breeds with a harmonica, all toward very confusing ends.  There's staccato piano, more staccato harmonica,
    and even <i>more</i> staccato drum machine beats-- all with confusingly dubby overtones.</p><p>
    
    Trux's article from 1989 stands as a testament to the flexibility of the track.  The duo repeats words,
    rhyme, sing, scream, and overdub overdub overdub while never succumbing to self-indulgence or straying
    outlandishly from what most people might call a ""rock composition"".  The instrumentation listing in the
    liners probably says more of its sound than any journalistic approximation-- it reads: ""voice, percussion,
    drum machines, mechanical monkey with cymbals, Moog, guitars, violin, bottles, pump organ, radio, record
    player, piano, harmonica, and tape machines.""</p><p>
<i>Hand of Glory</i>'s side two, titled ""The Boxing Story"", is a composition for tapes featuring recorded
    materials on cassettes being reversed, cut up, collaged, layered, and drenched in effects.  The track has a
    tendency toward narrative bursts which possess subtle qualities akin to fluid movement.  There are
    recognizable words, guitar solos, drum beats, whistles, screeches, skulls, wings, rats, blood and metal.
    There is literally abstraction here to the point of no return, but the abstraction has been taken to such a
    fine point that it can only be perceived as unified.  Twenty-something minutes of internalized extrusion is
    capitalized and completely shredded.</p><p>
<i>Hand of Glory</i> is an example of two fine exercises of military strength and rigor.  The ambling song
    structure synthesizes with the collage as a whole to create relations previously unconsidered in the Trux
    canon. It's not quite clear if this is because of their striking quality or their mere proximity, but either
    way, it represents an essence of artful quality, an achievement which stands to be quite rare.</p></div>"|6857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6857-hand-of-glory/|8.2|Mike Bernstein

Like Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey, the duo
    of Eric Hilton and Rob Garza are extremely savvy lifestyle-promoters. Their output typifies fashionista
    mood music-- music not meant to be listened to, but to be displayed as a marker of jaded sophistication.
    Coincidentally, I believe Thievery Corporation's albums perfectly describe the narrow tastes of professional
    Washington, DC.</p><p>
    For most readers of the 'Fork, DC means Fugazi, the Dismemberment Plan, and maybe a little go-go. But many
    who live and work in the city live and die by a single virtue: blandness. If you're a politico or a lawyer,
    nothing ensures success more than not sticking out. Look at the present Congress-- now that Traficant is
    behind bars, there's no one to display even the merest hint of idiosyncrasy. Thievery Corporation understand
    that in a city where Moby's <i>Play</i> is perceived as cutting-edge, they don't have to try too hard-- all
    it takes is to remember never to release anything that hasn't been exhaustively tried and tested, and in
    service for years.</p><p>
    The duo realizes that a smattering of international elements-- a brief tabla sample here, an oud there--
    will confer apparent substance on tracks that are never to be listened to, but rather to become part of
    the daily, accessorizing ritual that is the lives of the city's ""elite"".  Professional DC agrees that it's
    acceptable for lobbyists, lawyers, and corporate accountants to wear certain clothing styles, but not
    others; to enjoy canonical works of art, but never entertain more experimental forms; to buy certain albums
    and not others. No surprise, then, that those obnoxious tokens of broadmindedness, the Buddha Bar and Hotel
    Costes compilations, fly off the shelves of area Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble. But shame and censure await any
    Hill staffer found in possession of anything more exotic than Yo-Yo Ma's <i>Silk Road Journeys</i>.</p><p>
    Hilton and Garza pull back the curtains to reveal their opening number, an Air-y trip-hop ballad called
    ""Heaven's Gonna Burn Your Eyes"", featuring Emiliana Torrini. Torrini is the quintessential Thievery Corp
    collaborator. She embodies the triumph of style-over-substance. The Icelandic-Italian is an exotically Euro
    singer who conveniently represents Björk without any of Björk's twitchy eccentricity. Though sound-sculptors
    from Fat Cat's roster superbly remixed tracks from Torrini's debut album, <i>Love in the Time of Science</i>,
    none of her remixers seems to have had an inspirational effect on her or the Thievery lads. ""Heaven's Gonna
    Burn Your Eyes"" is as flat as Velveeta and half as nutritious.</p><p>
    The trap drums, oud, and violins of ""Facing East"" make Rabih Abou-Kahlil's aromatic fusion of traditional
    Lebanese folk music and jazz palatable for Enya fans. ""The Outernationalist"" is a dub excursion for those
    whose appreciation for reggae starts and stops at Bob Marley's <i>Legend</i>. Do Garza and Hilton really
    think that ""Un Simple Histoire"", featuring the meager vocal talent of returning collaborator, Loulou, will
    provoke awe and wonder? The beats that underpin Loulou and a sitar sample would have sounded passé a decade
    ago. Unless a Milli Vanilli revival is imminent, there's no excuse for this.</p><p>
    Things improve distinctly with the bossa nova of ""Meu Destino"" and the Afro-Cuban son of ""Exilo"". Garza and
    Hilton refrain from dabbling and forcing gaudy baubles onto the performances; instead, they allow their
    collaborators (Patrick de Santo and Vernie Verla respectively) to be themselves and not some pre-packaged
    approximation. But de Santos' and Verla's authenticity goes to shit when the album returns to its ""Girl,
    You Know It's True""-isms with ""From Creation"", a track which features a beefed-up version of the rhythm
    that served as the foundation for that timeless Milli Vanilli hit, and caps it off with vibes on loan from
    an elevator in the ESL Building.</p><p>
    Guest crooner Notch tries on his best Horace Andy impression for the record's title track, and Shinehead,
    renowned for his pop-reggae versions of Sting's ""Englishman in New York"" and Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean""
    pitches in on ""The State of the Union"" with his pal Sleepy Wonder in tow.  Riding clapped-out beats identical
    to those of ""Un Simple Histoire"", ""The State of the Nation"" endeavors to equal Badmarsh and Shri's ""Signs"".
    Though Sleepy Wonder can convincingly mimic UK Apache, whose tender vocals made ""Signs"" such a memorable cut,
    the blatantly obvious stream-of-consciousness lyrics can't steer me from thinking that ""The State of the
    Union"" isn't even equal to the sum of its shabby parts.</p><p>
    Though ESL Music has licensed some outstanding downtempo artists (Blue States, Broadway Project, Les Hommes),
    none of this excellence has apparently touched Thievery Corporation.  <i>The Richest Man in Babylon</i> is
    a career-low for Thievery Corporation and ESL.  If they keep this up much longer, even the power-brokers
    will lose interest.</p></div>"|8003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8003-the-richest-man-in-babylon/|3.8|Paul Cooper

    Counting their collaboration with Yume Bitsu's Adam Forkner as Surface of Eceon,
    Landing's <i>Seasons</i> was their third record in a year. <i>Seasons</i> found
    Landing experimenting with conventional song structures with some success, but
    the songs didn't seem quite as developed as they could have been had more time
    and effort put into their arranging and recording. And now, a few short months
    later, they've released <i>Fade In Fade Out</i>, a record that lasts longer than
    most Beatles albums (37 minutes), but which we in the digital age would call an
    EP.</p><p>
    
    Despite the torrential pace of their release schedule, it appears as though
    Landing still has the touch. <i>Fade In Fade Out</i> is actually a return to
    my preferred Landing mode, that of a primarily instrumental, FX-heavy guitar
    band. Where the shoegazy <i>Oceanless</i> bled psychedelic color and frequently
    drifted into jamming, and <i>Seasons</i> found Landing trying their hand with
    traditional songs, <i>Fade In Fade Out</i> is a shift toward deeply textured
    drone.  There's barely a drum or cymbal on this thing; most tracks are nothing
    more than a rich swirl of guitar and keyboard harmonics. <i>Seasons</i> brought
    Landing comparisons with slowcore bands, but <i>Fade In Fade Out</i> warrants
    a mention with Windy &amp; Carl or Stars of the Lid.</p><p>
    
    Where vocals appear, they're spare and, as they say, just another instrument.
    ""Against the Rain"" has the most prominent lyrics, but it's nothing that could
    be considered a ""song"" in the Cole Porter sense. A thudding kick drum is used
    for color, but most of the sound comes from a web of intertwined guitar lines
    with their delay pedals set on ""infinity"", as hints of synth drone shine through
    the gaps. Some crooned lines about rain rise and fall over the course of a
    minute or two, leading me to believe that this is a <i>Seasons</i> outtake.
    ""Whirlwind"" is closer to the sound of <i>Oceanless</i>, with ride-cymbal-heavy
    drumming and distant, buried dream-pop vocals by Adrienne Snow (a woman's voice
    is natural to this kind of sound, and I much prefer hers to husband Aaron's).</p><p>
    
    My favorite piece is the 12-minute closing track ""Pulse"", a slowburn number
    that takes plenty of time getting off the ground but covers virtually every
    kind of guitar tone possible before it's done. The squeezably-soft Windy &amp;
    Carl feedback is here, and so are the ringing chords, the tremeloed leads,
    and the harsher drones. There's no acoustic picking (Landing cover that
    adequately on the fine ""Constellations""), but ""Pulse"" establishes Landing
    as extremely skilled in the emotional application of guitar tone.</p></div>"|4672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4672-fade-in-fade-out-ep/|7.8|Mark Richardson

Ben Barnett is.  Sometimes, he's too passionate for his own good, repelling the very
    audience he's trying to communicate with.  He even opens his latest album-- incredibly his <i>seventh</i>
    full-length release in just three years-- with a song called ""Passionate"", wherein he exhorts over a
    ferocious, feedback-laden rock backdrop, ""Let's be passionate/ It's not like we'll get another chance to do
    this/ Don't be embarrassed/ Go over the top/ But come up from the bottom.""</p><p>
    
    I can't think of a more apt reference point for my experience with Kind of Like Spitting than those last
    two lines there.  My first exposure to the band came earlier this year, when I reviewed their self-titled
    compilation of early songs.  Virtually no moment on that record could really be considered over the top--
    frankly, it just wasn't very good.  Barnett certainly has come up from the bottom.</p><p>
    
    Helping him over the top are a cast of friends, some of whom you might recognize from Braid and Death Cab
    for Cutie, who quickly seem to be attaining Indie Rock Mentor status in the Pacific Northwest.  Death Cab's
    Ben Gibbard is all over this thing, at the piano, behind the drum kit and the backup microphone, where his
    even, skilled singing is very welcome as a foil to the frequently caterwauling Barnett.  His songwriting
    influence also appears to be lingering in the melodies that Barnett has cooked up here, which have only
    become exponentially better since those early efforts I referred to before.</p><p>
    
    For his part, Barnett manages to vacillate between even, subdued singing and an overwrought wail that would
    make Conor Oberst blush.  The middle of the album is largely filled with the former, leaving the latter to
    rough up the record's edges.  ""Following Days"" is a mid-album highlight, with its propulsive backing (I had
    no idea Gibbard could play the drums so well) and concise melody.  When electrified, Barnett's guitar
    generally has that lightly distorted tone that bands like Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate used as their
    stock-in-trade at the mid-90s height of emocore, and he squeezes a little feedback from it when he has to.</p><p>
    
    Things reach the height of bombast on ""Crossover Potential"", an old song that actually appears on the
    self-titled release that came out earlier this year, albeit in a much more spineless form.  Things rise
    to a thundering climax as Barnett and no fewer than nine accomplices shout out the chorus, peaking on the
    line ""the average woe has no crossover potential"" in a display of pained mass catharsis.  It's one of
    several instances where things get just a bit <i>too</i> over the top.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, I think my favorite track is the last one, ""Untitled"".  Hardly clocking in at fifty seconds, it's a
    quiet acoustic number whose brevity, sprightly guitar work, and close Barnett/Gibbard harmonies render it
    endearing in almost the same way that ""Her Majesty"" seemed a strangely fitting end for <i>Abbey Road</i>.
    Overall, Kind of Like Spitting have scraped together a pretty decent little rock record that occasionally
    veers a little too far into overblown emo territory for my tastes.  It's not going to change the world or
    anything, but it sure is passionate.</p></div>"|4434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4434-bridges-worth-burning/|6.0|Joe Tangari

    either way, there's a nice mystique to it: an epic vacation, an eternity (to the shortsighted among us) of
    free time, all empty of responsibility, regret, and unwilled concerns.  A hundred days to wake up at three
    in the afternoon, a hundred days of raving 'til dawn, a hundred days to revel in all the fruits of blissful
    slackerdom-- this is what Underworld would like to bring you, and they come damn close.</p><p>
    
    But Underworld's <i>Hundred Days</i> is an unpaid holiday, you see, and over time, bills pile up, boredom
    sets in, and eventually, part of you wishes you had a job to go back to.  It's relaxing, okay, but in the
    end, there's not much to show for it-- a souvenir, and perhaps a few points off your systolic pressure.
    Underworld, of course, are perfectly content to offer only this.  They're the cruise ship of electronic
    music industry, offering clients a world of extravagant entertainment and vacuous beauty.  You want to
    think?  Get a day job, go to school.  But when this vacation begins, there will be no literary references,
    no complex mathematical tables or equations, no world-weary insights into the human condition.</p><p>
    
    With every release, Underworld-- here stripped to the duo of Karl Hyde and Rick Smith, as Darren Emerson
    left to pursue DJing full-time in 2000-- refine their ultra-hypnotic beats to the barest, simplest
    elements, each time taking one step closer to some basic internal rhythm so instantly accessible that
    consciousness seems optional for its perception; you could almost dance to it in your sleep.  <i>A Hundred
    Days Off</i> is merely the next step in their process.  It's the best thing they've hammered out since tumbling
    from the lofty heights of <i>Dubnobasswithmyheadman</i>, though given their interim releases, that isn't saying
    much of anything.  What's interesting, though, is that they've managed to refine their sound without hardly
    changing it.  Their music has a sort of unyielding rigidity-- no matter how much they change things
    superficially, the fundamentals are instantly recognizable.  And on <i>A Hundred Days Off</i>, their
    formula remains pristine-- from the first vocoded (big surprise) syllable, to the final repetitive,
    trance-inducing pulse-- if far from perfect.</p><p>
    
    The most notable improvement, as befits the album's title, is that this time around, Underworld take things
    a little easier.  The record is far more low-key and subdued, yet holds just shy of complacency.  Tracks
    like ""SolaSistim"" are stylish and direct, easily enjoyed by the subconscious while you relax in the local
    sensory-deprivation tank.  Between the similarly mellow radiations of ""Twist"" and ""Little Speaker"" (the two
    songs bookending ""SolaSistim""), it wanders slightly off course by becoming slothful, perhaps, but all in
    all, the user-friendly ease of the tones and rhythms is a big selling point.  The change is a subtle one,
    but the laid-back feel of <i>A Hundred Days Off</i> is a qualified improvement.</p><p>
    
    ""Two Months Off"" is the one exception to the album's otherwise placid comfort-- this record's answer to
    their epic hit single ""Born Slippy"".  Calling back the vocoding ""Slippy"" so successfully employed for an
    encore and an equally rousing chorus, its nine-minute run is easily the album's most powerful stretch.
    Although the other tracks are reasonably successful, none are so naturally anthemic.  In fact, the only
    other song that makes such a distinct impression (possibly included to counterbalance ""Two Months Off"") is
    the absolutely horrendous ""Trim"".  See, the great thing about the way Underworld employ vocoding is that
    you typically can't make out the lyrics.  ""Trim"" serves as a reminder that Underworld is better heard than
    actually listened to; they use those vocoders for a reason, folks.  I'm the last person to care what
    Underworld is singing about, but these lyrics make my head hurt, and the singing, sadly the central focus
    of ""Trim"", makes Yoko Ono sound like Nina Simone.</p><p>
    
    Exceptions aside, <i>A Hundred Days Off</i> is enjoyably uninspired; it defines both ""pleasant"" and
    ""unremarkable"".  Even when, during its second half, Underworld seem tempted to venture into some foreign
    territory, they're scared off by the alien sounds and patterns, and run off without genuinely committing
    to anything (though if the results of such a commitment were to be along the lines of ""Trim"", it's for the
    best that they stay put).  Instead, they offer just enough variety to briefly snap you out of the daze
    that the record's first half puts you in.  Still, that's not to say that Underworld, at any point on
    <i>A Hundred Days Off</i>, even approaches ""thinking-man's music"".  Your body will move long before your
    brain does.  Of course, I suppose that's the point.</p></div>"|8350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8350-a-hundred-days-off/|6.9|Eric Carr

    you were planning next and buy, instead, three records: <i>This Nation's Saving Grace</i>, <i>Hex Enduction
    Hour</i>, and this newly released two-disc set, <i>Totally Wired: The Rough Trade Anthology</i>.  The music
    contained here is nothing short of absolutely essential, epochal rock and roll that sounds like nothing else,
    including the racks upon racks of albums it eventually inspired.</p><p>
    Staggering out of industrial Manchester, England at the height of the post-punk era on a lo-fi bed of jagged,
    intoxicated guitar work and swaggering rhythm, The Fall were like an alternate rock and roll reality, an
    entire musical universe unto themselves.  Vocalist and band mainstay Mark E Smith's scattershot, loquacious
    delivery and Northern pride put him in a league of his own, where his sneering, often indecipherable vocals
    ranged from shocking to hilarious to deeply political, and were never any less than absolutely thrilling.</p><p>
    The Fall's three-year tenure at Rough Trade Records is the stuff of legend, full of rancorous label/band
    fighting (Smith later said he'd rather retire than record for them again), furious live shows, and music
    that would forever alter the course of independent music.  Some of The Fall's best songs are scattered
    across the two discs of this set.  The only other period during which the band were this consistent in
    their 2\xBD-decade-long (and counting) career was the one that immediately followed it, when the band signed
    to Beggars Banquet and released some of their best work-- including 1984's <i>The Wonderful and Frightening
    World of The Fall</i> and their 1985 classic <i>This Nation's Saving Grace</i>, both of which saw them
    incorporating more distinct pop elements into their sharp-witted, staggering cut-and-thrust.</p><p>
    The set opens with the track it was named for, a 1980 single that later appeared on the US edition of
    <i>Grotesque (After the Gramme)</i>.  The song is as indicative of The Fall's signature sound as any other,
    but it's also perhaps one of their most accessible.  First come the stomping drums, briefly recalling the
    opening moments of The Ramones' ""Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio"", though the similarity ends when
    Smith grandly announces, ""I'm totally wired,"" his voice stuttering and cracking, turning an otherwise
    routinely declamatory line into a frantic yelp.  The band members echo his chorus, but it's during the
    verses that Smith drops the song's best lines: ""You don't have to be weird... uh-to be... wiiiired... and
    I'm <i>always</i> worried.""</p><p>
    It's stunning to hear how consistent this band was in their heyday.  Throughout their countless genre
    explorations, they never failed, and always wound up, somehow, sounding like nothing other than The Fall.
    ""That Man"" is old-fashioned 50s rock 'n' roll, as if the Cold War had really become the nuclear holocaust
    it always threatened to.  ""The Man Whose Head Expanded"" hints at schlocky New Romantic synth-pop with its
    bleeping keyboard preset (the same one used by Trio for their Volkswagen-resurrected hit ""Da Da Da""), but
    Smith's rant pulls it back from the brink and the guitars send it lurching into a wandering breakdown and
    frenzied build-up.  The mighty ""Rowche Rumble"", one of the band's defining tracks, soon follows, with
    Smith's sarcastic opening claim, ""Well, this is a groovy number,"" preceding the nailbomb-like explosion of
    Marc Riley's and Craig Scanlon's guitars into a jaw-dropping riff.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""Pay Your Rates"" barrels through production that makes <i>Vampire on Titus</i> sound like Kylie
    Minogue, while ""New Puritan"" sounds as though it could have been recorded off a depression-era radio show
    receiving the future of harrowing, abstract art-punk mayhem.  And the sinister riffs of ""Pay Your Rates""
    and ""Prole Art Threat"" are designed for the sole purpose of detonation and destruction: raw pummeling with
    little consideration for the rest of the band.</p><p>
    Though neither of these discs are arranged in chronological order, the second largely consists of later
    material than the first, focusing primarily on 1983's <i>Perverted by Language</i>.  The album marked the
    debut of Smith's future wife Brix with the band, and a turn toward slightly more accessible (or at least
    less grinding) music, and though none of it was ever going to threaten the top of the charts, the group
    was opening up to a less improvisational stance that made for more direct hooks.  In fact, this was the
    era in which The Fall would do their best work yet, balancing dissonant crunch with more rigid structures.</p><p>
    This compilation is invaluable: it's the first time a truly exhaustive compilation of some of The Fall's
    best material has been made available stateside, where the stuff has long been difficult to track down.
    Compiling the work of a band like The Fall would be a maddening task, with literally dozens of releases in
    multiple formats scattered across more than a half-dozen labels.  <i>Totally Wired</i> provides an excellent
    starting point for one of their best periods.  Though it does stop short of the thoroughness that might make
    it a true anthology, <i>Totally Wired</i> pulls from every Rough Trade release The Fall recorded, providing
    a quality roadmap for where a listener might want to go next, and that's indispensable for a band so worth
    exploring.</p></div>"|2967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2967-totally-wired-the-rough-trade-anthology/|9.0|Joe Tangari

The answer is obvious if I look beyond my own CD rack:
    most people (of all ages-- don't feel guilty, starchildren) prefer other kinds of music.  It's not as if
    the devil's rock 'n' roll up and wiped away the repressive art music which had been holding down kids--
    by the 1950s, classical musicians were already knee-deep in a perception of ivory-tower innovation and
    snobbish dissonance.  As a result (though I suspect more as a symptom of longstanding cultural shifts),
    what classical music was deemed safe to appreciate fit snugly in an afternoon concert, in a hall of seats
    that also fit snugly for blue-haired aunts and volunteer ushers from the Boy Scouts.</p><p>
    The worst part about classical music's dusty old rep is that it's wildly inaccurate.  Without ever speaking
    of modern composers, the history of this music is littered with rebellion, rage, depression, obsession,
    lust, mental disorders, joy, and enough contradictory insular logic to make the E6 bands drop out of therapy
    (""because, you know, it just seems like we're going nowhere"").  Classical music's public dismissal just
    seems unnecessary.</p><p>
    Hungarian composer György Ligeti (born 1923) has actually seen both sides of the wall between popular and
    classical music.  His onetime mentor Karlheinz Stockhausen was a prime figure for classical composers trying
    to shine beyond the wing of the elitist avant-garde.  Where serial (and other formalist) works were the sign
    of an artistic community well outside the domain of popular acceptance or even understanding, composers like
    Stockhausen actively broke unwritten rules of accepted artistic persona.  Ligeti, perhaps less affected by
    the ""image"" of a serious composer than his Western peers, was very much interested in formal innovations
    like micopolyphony, but still managed to produce works that appealed to many modern classical listeners on
    more that just intellectual grounds.</p><p>
    And then there was Stanley Kubrick.  The late director bestowed pop-culture immortality on the humble
    Hungarian by choosing several of his pieces as the signature sounds to <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>.
    Remember those weird choral clusters when all the monkeys discover the monolith?  When Dave is traveling
    through time and space?  Ligeti pieces such as ""Atmospheres"" and ""Lux Aeterna"" were the sound of tripping
    for many an impressionable hippie-- and still sound pretty spacy today.</p><p>
    Teldec's ""Ligeti Project"" series actually takes over for Sony's defunct ""Edition"" series from the mid-90s.
    Sony got through all the choral pieces, string quartets and piano music, but none of the orchestral stuff.
    The pieces on this set range from very early symphonic experiments with traditional Hungarian and Romanian
    folk dances, to the dense, ominous 1960s works that wowed Kubrick, to 1974's fiery, episodic ""San Francisco
    Polyphony"".</p><p>
    The earliest music dates from 1951, and is the premiere recording of Ligeti's ""Concert Romanesc"".  According
    to the composer, it was very difficult to perform new music in Hungary at the time, and this piece remained
    obscure until now.  Compared to his later works, it's actually pretty straightforward, calling to mind some
    of Prokofiev's lighter orchestral music, as well as the Hungarian studies of Bartok.  Ha ha, had you going
    there, right?  Anyway, it's fun, if not essential.</p><p>
<i>Apparitions</i> (1958-1959) introduces Ligeti's famed micropolyphony, which is the concept of composing
    music not as a melody with harmony and rhythm, but as an endless mesh of interweaving textures where no one
    voice stands out, and the overall effect is not unlike hearing a giant cement mixer of strings and flutes.
    Ligeti brought that concept to its feverish apex with <i>Atmospheres</i> (1961), one of the most haunting
    pieces of music of the 20th Century.  Kubrick used this music to invoke mystery, discovery and primal fear.
    1967's <i>Lontano</i> (also featured by Kubrick in <i>The Shining</i>) is not as dense, but more overtly
    dissonant.  It features more moments of calm, and is a nice balance of Ligeti's extreme polyphony and his
    relatively calmer material.</p><p>
    As far as I can tell, highbrow snobbery and intellectual masturbation is more often a by-product of critics
    discussing this stuff than it is of the actual music or musicians.  Ligeti is great starting place for diving
    into the world of avant-garde classical: not as sprawlingly eclectic as Stockhausen, nor as single-mindedly
    consistent as Morton Feldman.  And his music is just sitting here waiting for you.</p></div>"|4785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4785-the-ligeti-project-ii/|8.7|Dominique Leone

While enjoying records like their self-titled debut
    and <i>The Surveillance</i>, I thought they were a good instrumental rock band with a love of vintage
    electronics and a good sense of humor. I knew there was something tongue-in-cheek about them, obviously,
    but I always heard some genuine affection at the core of the music.  It's all about being ""clever"" now,
    it seems, about loosening the ties to the 80s by sending up the decade's excesses.  With <i>TA</i>, Trans
    Am became the new wave Sha Na Na.</p><p>
    
    Things could change, though, and I hope they do. In the meantime, here's a six-track remix EP to remind us
    to look forward to the band's evolution.  <i>Extremixxx</i> is the sort of EP that really should only be
    available on vinyl.  With two versions of ""Cold War"" and three of ""Different Kind of Love"" (including one
    that's just the instrumental of the prior track's vocal mix), there's no way in hell you're going to want
    to put <i>Extremixxx</i> on in the car, on your walkman, or on your living room stereo. It's either a DJ
    tool or mixtape fodder, nothing more.</p><p>
    
    Track by track, then. Busy Chicagoan Johnny Herndon works as A Grape Dope, turning in his ""Bombs and More
    Mix"" of ""Cold War"". He clips the sounds and adds a jerky, stop/start feel to the rhythm, turning the song
    into something closer to a breakdancing anthem. It's fair.  Eastern Developments glitch artist Dabrye's
    remix of ""Infinite Wavelength"" shifts the hectic cheeseball synth-pop of the original into a slow, slightly
    funky container brimming with robot soul, making the oily vocodered vocals the tune's center point. Trans
    Am engineer Jonathan K's take on ""Cold War"" is a bid for an electroclash DJ's crate that misses by a foot,
    with the beat made a little housier and the synths just a bit more goth.</p><p>
    
    Kicking off the back half, The Automator adds the sort of syncopated hip-hop beat he can program in his
    sleep to ""Different Kind of Love"" and little else. And then the EP closes with ""Different Kind of Love""
    reworked by Prefuse 73, once as a vocal, and once as an instrumental. It's fitting that Scott Herren be
    the only person to feature his beat on its own, because it's by far the best one here, showing that he
    listened to plenty of Timbaland while internalizing all that mid-90s Warp IDM.</p><p>
    
    Of course, one good track in vocal and instrumental versions, and four others ranging from okay to terrible,
    doesn't make for a good remix EP, I'm afraid. It's not so bad if you consider how weak some of the original
    <i>TA</i> material is, but still.  Very easy to sit this one out.</p></div>"|8138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8138-extremixxx-ep/|3.8|Mark Richardson

How futuristic it was going to be? Cripes, yo, it's 2002-- weren't we supposed to have
    brainphones and hover-beers by now?  Weren't we supposed to be able to seduce our relatives and combat Biff
    by time-traveling in Deloreans fueled by sewage?  Wasn't the government supposed to be teleporting the
    homeless to Haiti while they sleep?  Where are my in-foot skates?</p><p>
    
    Ladytron certainly remembers the future, and they've grasped that it will be symbiotically reliant on the
    technological dreamwaves of the past-- namely old synth textures.  As major playaz in the key-heavy,
    retro-progressive Genre That Hath Too Many Names, these four Brits knew that stakes was high for their
    sophomore slab.  Anyone expecting the warm organs of <i>604</i> will be stung by this disc's stark, arch
    tones; the band's no longer sittin' on the dock of the analog bay.  The distant, bloodless <i>Light &amp;
    Magic</i> is club-fodder for some Kubrickian half- or post-human future in which android scum mimic the
    moves of the mammals they were built to replace.</p><p>
    
    Those who dismiss Ladytron releases as ""More Songs About Fashion and Dreck"" get subjected to the circular
    logic of the Ladytron fanatics who insist that anyone who doesn't get it simply doesn't get it.  Despite
    Ladytron's popularity (congrats on the car commercial, gang, that industry really needed more stylized
    fetish-marketing!), these satin-jacket-and-secret-handshakes fans act as if the group is still their hidden
    prize.  They also claim that Ladytron are the arbiters of some savvy cultural criticism.  Call me thick,
    but I don't hear it-- and I promise I'm listening for it, as one of the few eager listeners aware that at
    the peak of boredom perch those who act bored by cult-crit.  But where is the sly commentary in songs such
    as ""Blue Jeans"", ""Cracked LCD"", and ""Black Plastic"", which are about blue jeans, cracked LCDs, and black
    plastic?   And how, on other tracks, can these dashing primpers bemoan the tyranny of fashion?  That's like
    self-arresting inmates, or anti-potassium bananas, or...</p><p>
    
    So you're all, ""Let's 'Tron again/ Like we did last summer,"" only to realize that camp is never as good the
    second time around. And of course, Ladytron's camp is fussily campy. ""Turn It On"" might be daft, but it's a
    classic guilty pleasure, reeking of roller-rink digi-breeziness and reminiscent of certain Mantronix/Salt-N-Pepa/Herbie
    Hancock unmentionables. In fact, more than a couple of these tracks evoke a strange, reverbed collaboration
    between Yaz and Sir-Mix-A-Lot. Ladytron fans with CDR's full of ""Playgirl"" remixes had better recalibrate
    their ometer-ometers to withstand the shock; we're a long way from their cover of Human League's ""Open Your
    Heart"". I draw the kitsch line at ""Flicking Your Switch"", though-- any sophistos laboring to trace Ladytron's
    roots to aggro-dance greats will hopefully acknowledge that this thin riff summons only, er, (cough)
    Technotronic.</p><p>
    
    If you're insecure about how these frozen jams polarize your mind, ask people in proximity to you for their
    reactions: someone whose opinion I value, who is usually tolerant of my stereo worship, demanded that I stop
    <i>Light &amp; Magic</i>, citing the repetition and the buried vox as key irritants.  A pretentious idiot told
    me that the album was ""post-millennial"", whatever the ass that's supposed to mean in the year 2002. (Man,
    that was a post-millennial ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" last night.)  The non-idiot had a point: this album
    repeats itself exponentially. I know the songs go nowhere on purpose; that's part of the robo-statement,
    etc. But I promise you'll want out of this antiseptic defertilization ward unless you're planning a
    stasis-themed party at the old warehouse out on Cellphone Tower Ave.</p><p>
    
    Mixed signals abound and obtain and endure: the album is by turns ominous and playful; for every passage
    that feels like ghosts haunting the intercoms at an abandoned airport, there are stretches like ""Seventeen"",
    which, be warned, is the only thing in the world catchier than Quincy Jones' ""Sanford and Son"" theme. I
    won't even type its chorus for fear of its voodoo.  For every blatant genre flirtation, you get an ice-pop
    turn like the bouncily experimental ""Re:agents"", which lays claim to a killer flute loop and even dares to
    meander during its breakdown.  The disc's vocals approximate Kim Deal's at welcome intervals, and some
    Faint-ish noise-blasts emerge, betraying the sheepish control booth.</p><p>
    
    Don't judge this beast by its look-at-me packaging, which reads like one of those salon samplers you ""read""
    while waiting for your haircut at 3:15 while your stylist and her 3:00 commiserate about their junkie
    boyfriends.  Ladytron has succeeded at programming a record so distant that you'll wonder just what
    comprises the wind beneath their wires.</p></div>"|4631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4631-light-magic/|7.1|William Bowers
