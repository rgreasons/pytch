    When lead Long Blonde Kate Jackson sang ""I'd rather just stay indoors"" on her group's full-blooded debut LP, <em>Someone to Drive You Home</em>, the shrugging sentiment was buoyed by dollops of surging guitar pop. And while the album flirted with its fair share of romantic misery, the accompanying music offered a smorgasbord of high-end giddiness. Obsessed with the swooning glamor of old Hollywood, Jackson played her lovelorn roles with plucky aplomb on <em>Home</em>-- from valiant big sister to bitter ex-lover to cutthroat femme fatale-- never languishing in one persona for too long. The singer might resign herself to nights filled with nothing but gin and Ava Gardner on Thursday, only to be seen flipping huge eyelashes toward a best friend's beau at the local watering hole on Friday. The combination of her sensual blare, guitarist-lyricist Dorian Cox's Pulp-y kitchen sink stories, and the group's hi-hat'n'hooks attack proved a welcome twist on the tiresome post-punk trend; when most bands looked to Factory staples to inform their danceable rock styles, this Sheffield clan came off like sly Postcard descendants with a flair for vintage shawls and berets. The one-time Best Unsigned Band in Britain offered sexy, theatrical escapism for the thrift store set, who joyfully returned the favor with knowing nods and the odd herky-jerky twist moves.</p><p>
    Their sophomore effort won't get the cool kids as loose, which is ironic since it's designed for the dance floor. <em>""Couples""</em> is a darker affair, with much of the band's jittering upstrokes dismissed in favor of synth squelches and airless grooves. And this time, when Jackson threatens to spend weeks on the couch, it doesn't sound like a mere flight of youthful fancy. ""I used to come here to have a good time but I can feel like this at home,"" she laments on the title track, alone and despondent in the corner of the bar. In contrast to <em>Home</em>, which often found the singer looking at relationships from the outside with wide-eyed yearning, <em>""Couples""</em> deals more with the complications that arise from within troubled pairs.</p><p>
    The change in perception is likely a byproduct of age -- and the fact that two inter-band couples broke up since <em>Home</em>'s release probably played a part as well. So while the songwriting is less lively, it still remains relatively sharp as chief lyricist Cox delves into the uglier depths of relationship drama. ""Guilt"" has Jackson trying to drop a persistent suitor while sticking with her boyfriend-- ""guilt has nothing to do with it,"" she tells her lover, though the plain existence of the song would suggest otherwise. ""Here Comes the Serious Bit"" and ""Erin O'Connor"" take on the topic of sex with bleary, bloodshot eyes; the former's ""serious bit"" refers to the tenuous line between friends and more-than-friends, and the latter's titular British model stands in as a mask for a woman trying to gloss over her infidelities. For a band so adept at bringing the frivolities of infatuation to a boil, doomed affairs like the one told in ""I Liked the Boys"" (about a bored housewife who dreams about the one that got away) don't take advantage of their most potent powers. Along with the dour new outlook, producer Erol Alkan also acts as a stymieing force as he quantizes <em>""Couples""</em> into beat-based boxes that suck away at the Long Blondes' jumpy spontaneity. </p><p>
    Known for remixing Justice and Hot Chip among others, Alkan's style is similar to that of neo-post-punk godhead Paul ""Phones"" Epworth, i.e., turn it up, keep it steady, and chip away at any and all traces of humanness. When he's not botching the typical Long Blondes sound with distractingly piece-meal mixes and overly mechanical loops on tracks like ""The Couples"" and ""Serious Bit"", he leads the group into some intriguing-yet-unfulfilling experiments. As the <em>""Heroes""</em>-esuqe quotes in the album's title suggest, the Long Blondes aspire to be legit art-rockers and, as is the mandate for such bands, they must challenge expectations. Mission accomplished on first single ""Century"", which not only introduces a spare disco pulse (that thinks it's about five times funkier than it actually is) but also changes things up lyrically, with Jackson penning a scattered and abstract ode to a hundred years gone by. It's all very ""Rapture"" minus the requisite strut. Odder still is the woozy wipe-out track ""Round the Hairpin"", a respectable attempt at Can-style kraut that suffers from an indulgent running time and lack of suitable context-- it's as if they Googled ""experimental genre"" and ran with the results for six long minutes. Of the self-consciously out-there tracks, the minimal ""Too Clever By Half"" is the clear keeper; on it, Jackson employs a sinister falsetto as she unravels a cunning quadruple-cross tale over skeletal disco. The song revives the winking Long Blondes of old while still progressing their sound instead of blindly tossing everything aside in search of something (anything) new. </p><p>
    On the album's closer, a two-timing Jackson tries to cap the muddy trauma of the rest of <em>""Couples""</em> by embracing her sinful side: ""I'm going to hell so I may as well make it worth my while,"" she belts. It's a refreshing moment of defiance from an album that often seems awkwardly stuck-- between beats and guitars, complacency and loneliness, guilt and redemption. Well-studied pupils of the indie game, it's as if the Long Blondes willed themselves into a classically underwhelming, transitional second LP. (Talking about the record's penchant for left-turns, Cox recently said, ""It's a way of setting our stall out. This album's job is to point towards the third album."") They're blessed with a genuine pop star in Jackson, and Cox can still turn pedestrian travails into rousing anthems á la Jarvis Cocker, but neither talent is on full display here. In an attempt to be taken seriously, they've sacrificed too much of their effervescent appeal-- after all, enthusiasm and artfulness need not be mutually exclusive.

That the Helio Sequence-- to date, a good-not-great duo on Sub Pop and Cavity Search-- buck this trend stands as one of the pleasant surprises of the still-young year. Brandon Summers is a compelling, economical, and technically sound vocalist and his strides as a frontman carry the band's fourth album, <em>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</em>, an uneven but varied affair that suggests a long and fulfilling trajectory for the Helio Sequence.</p><p>
    Summers' development comes with a tidy backstory: Amidst touring for 2004 Sub Pop debut <em>Love and Distance</em>, Summers lost his voice, read Dylan's <em>Chronicles</em>, and saw a doctor who instructed him not to sing for almost two months. The resultant scare led Summers to a feast of indie rock anomalies: healthy living via exercise and a regular practice/recording schedule and technical improvement via singing exercises. The results lie in ascendant vocals that replace awkward growls and breathy whispers with precise notes and even phrasing.</p><p>
    Summers and keyboardist/drummer Benjamin Weikel thankfully did not let this increased attention to detail and professionalism derail their ember-glow indie pop. <em>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</em> is an ambitiously large album, gassing Summer's voice with reverb and bottle-rocketing all sorts of synths and effected guitars into lilting rock songs performed with the measure and craft of Northwest scene veterans. The push-push verses of ""Can't Say No"" and the tremble-y guitars of ""Lately"" encompass the flat skies and multitudinous bridges of hometown Portland; ""The Captive Mind"" eagerly recalls Modest Mouse's ""Gravity Rides Everything"". The pulsing sequencer of ""Hallelujah"", the album's longest and most strident anthem, plays counterpoint to Summer's long, loose solos. The muscular title track wrestles lustily with the Stone Roses: ""You came on like you knew you would/ Wearing high-top shoes walking home from school/ And I just 'bout fell right off the balcony.""</p><p>
    The unfortunate side effect of Summer's newfound expertise is that, well, he's apt to use it. Singers like ""carrying"" songs, and <em>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</em> falters when Summers and Weikel set aside their wiring and aim for folk sounds subtly aided by ambient backgrounds, a swell idea if your slow tracks don't sound like the ballads from Dylan's <em>Down in the Groove</em>. Lines like ""Drank the dark wine of the New York night/ With shattered mind across the borderline"" do not help. On <em>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</em>'s final track, the harmonica-led ""No Regrets"", the two get it right: clacking percussion behind a drunken sing-a-long that suggests that, yeah, the Helio Sequence might one day pull off this Americana tip, too. Even when it fails, <em>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</em> has a refreshing maturity and presence, old enough to admit that folk jamboree and synth-rock can coexist, hopeful enough to think <em>Joshua Tree</em>, or at least <em>Ocean Rain</em>, was a really good idea. Summers got religion right during ""Hallelujah""-- ""We don't want answers, anyway""-- but the wisdom is equally appropriate for his and Weikel's newfound skills. <em>Keep Your Eyes Ahead</em> is content to see where merely questioning gets you.</p></div>"|11390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11390-keep-your-eyes-ahead/|7.6|Andrew Gaerig

    Clap Your Hands Say Yeah were supposed to totally change the game for up-and-coming bands looking to avoid being extra deck chairs on the majors' sinking ships, but after <em>Some Loud Thunder</em> met its inevitable and somewhat warranted backlash, it just became that much harder to invest in a group like Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin (and <em>Walk It Off </em>ain't helpin' either). Yeltsin's story is familiar-- armed with a memorably silly name and all the right blogger friends, the Springfield, Mo., foursome stepped up to Polyvinyl in 2006, and their sources are so collegiate you can practically hear an awkward DJ announcing the title between pockets of dead air after every song.</p><p>
    But is that enough to cut it when you're trying desperately to come around on that Fuck Buttons album?  <em>Pershing</em>, their second full-length, maroons SSLYBY on a middle ground that's eroding as listeners try to have it both ways, indulging in more outré subgenres and getting their pop fix from more ""direct"" sources, as if hooks from Rihanna are intrinsically more valuable than those of, say, the Shins.Which is to say that indie elitism never dies, it just mutates, and an album like <em>Pershing</em> is more likely to slip through the cracks due to its general sense of inoffensiveness. Thing is, it finds SSLYBY a far more accomplished and confident band, something to be expected from two years of having to prove themselves outside of their homebase.</p><p>
    If the hooks of ""Glue Girls"" were spread over the course of <em>Pershing</em>, we'd be talking about a pretty solid record, but as the opener, it sets off a chain reaction of indie pop that's clean-cut without being fussy, instantly accessible without being too lightweight. At times, SSLYBY trip up when they get a little too clever for their own good.  The overly affected eccentricities of ""Oceanographer"" tests the limits of how many words should be consecutively rhymed with the title (the answer: one, tops) before wandering off to a non-jam jam session of gormless riffing.  Meanwhile, the Archies-like fluff of ""Dead Right"" is too content in getting on some Cam'ron shit and flipping the title over and over again until it's nearly meaningless.</p><p>
    Truth is, the band's in a bit of a Catch-22-- <em>Pershing</em> is so easy-going it tends to forget trying to be memorable. In fact, in the time it takes to listen to its first song, you could've checked
    out Boris Yeltsin's Wiki page instead (did you know his approval rating
    was rumored to be 2% at his resignation?!?) and been as entertained. ""Boring Fountain"" and ""Modern Mystery"" pleasurably go in through one ear and out the other with polite harmonies, spiffy guitar sheen, and the occasional horn. And that's the problem: Rarely does anything stick other than a spare melodic line. The fact that they're able to cobble a few together over the span of three minutes gives off a complexity that feels more illusory than anything.

    ""It was so <em>f'in </em>precious."" So went a lyric from Cloud Cult's last studio LP, 2007's<em> The Meaning Of 8</em>, and it could've been the understatement of the year.  Nearly everything about the group is so admirable (their studio runs on geothermal power) or adorable (live painter onstage?!?!), that you could feel comfortable nominating them for public office or writing about them only in LOLCAT speak.  But while <em>8 </em>wasn't exactly an epic fail, it was curiously underwhelming; pre-leak hype suggested that it would push these industrious Minnesotans to the upper echelon of blog hosannas and year-end top tens that they seemed perfectly constructed for, but it just sort of deflated upon touchdown.  But Cloud Cult have developed a self-sufficiency that allows them to exist almost totally outside indie's name-making machinery; simply put, they don't need the help, seeing as how whatever happens, they'll just keep doing what they do, free of the temptation to compromise their lofty ambitions.</p><p>
    So, as expected, Cloud Cult keep it moving with their eighth album in as many years, but <em>Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes) </em>is a pretty marked departure from their previous records. Considering that they've got their aesthetic down pat (a sort of post-Beck kitchen sink alt-rock matched with the 21<sup>st</sup>-century quasi-religious collectives), it's got nothing to do with sonics, however.  Their last two LP's combined to clock in at more than 120 minutes over the span of 44 tracks, but this time, they've damn near put out an EP-- 39 over 13. This would initially seem like a smart move, but sprawl is every bit as essential to what they do as capo Craig Minowa's warble; paddling through all the extraneous dross was part (or most) of the fun.  Unfortunately, their batting average is far lower here, magnifying all the nagging problems they've compiled to date.  The title rings true, as the contents of <em>Feel Good Ghosts </em>are effusive, but invertebrate.</p><p>
    Essentially, this is where the insularity finally catches up.  At the very least, ""No One Said it Would Be Easy"" begins <em>Feel Good Ghosts </em>with beautifully panned piano, expressing the type of sentiments that are uncut Cloud Cult at their most empathetic-- ""You're a pretty human being...living, it ain't easy""-- but overzealous studio treatment has Minowa sounding like Jeremy Enigk drowning in a jar of Smuckers.  And then there's ""Love You All"", which ends<em> Feel Good Ghosts </em>with the scent of an acid-washed power ballad, expressing the type of sentiments that are uncut Cloud Cult at their most cloying. Minowa offers ""I love you""'s to his mother and father but does so through a fucking talkbox, which either undermines the emotion or completely cancels it out. 
    </p>
<p>
    In between, <em>Feel Good Ghosts </em>too often comes off like hamburger phone transmissions from the <em>Juno</em>-verse, force-feeding knotty or naughty feelings through a filter of whimsy. ""Story of the Grandson of Jesus"", in addition to mining the same territory as <em>8</em>'s<em> </em>""Alien Christ"", relates the story of a false prophet with a ""penchant for the pinchies,"" offering ""cola and Twinkies."" Meanwhile, ""Journey of the Featherless"" gives you an idea of what an unplugged Her Space Holiday might sound like, impotently namechecking cellphones and eBay as if they're pillars of modern evil after Minowa dispenses a K.I.T. senior yearbook koan-- ""It's worth dreaming just for the dream of it.""   The group's always had a predilection for the boomin' system in their drum machines, but ""The Tornado Lessons"" is finally where Minowa tries his hand at the rap game.  I'll let you guess how that turns out.
    </p>
<p>
    I really wanted to see ""May Your Hearts Stay Strong"" succeed more than it does, as it features one of <em>Feel Good Ghost</em>'s most arresting arrangements of machinery clanks and dramatic keyboards, and suggests that Cloud Cult might be willing to strip away their shiny happy defense mechanisms.  But nothing about the shadowy love affair described therein feels real-- a nightclub owner who ""got his first stitches when he bit an ice cream bowl"" falls for a girl who ""wore her grandma's prom dress and slippers on her feet.""  Instead of letting the characters just <em>be, </em>they have to be <em>characters </em>instead, and lyrically, Minowa just sounds out of his element, similar to when he laments ""all the poop that brings me down"" over the oontz-oontzing fake disco of ""Hurricane And Fire Survival Guide"".
    </p>
<p>
    I'll admit, it's hard not to root for these guys, considering that they mean so well. Minowa will likely always have Cloud Cult as a means to therapeutically address the death of his infant son, and then there's this from the band's website: ""We also plant ten trees for every 1,000 albums sold just to be sure any other pollutants are absorbed. We have turned away major record label interests so we can be sure we can maintain control of providing Cloud Cult music in the most environmentally friendly manner possible.""
    </p>
<p>
    How can I tell you <em>not </em>to spend the ten bucks?  But you don't need a Mclusky primer to tell you that good intentions can only go so far and <em>Feel Good Ghosts </em>repeatedly fails to meet the listener halfway; Minowa hasn't run out of things to say, but he's having trouble coming up with new ways to say them, and <em>Feel Good Ghosts </em>unfortunately feels like another byproduct of Cloud Cult's recycling process.

    was a purpose-driven appellation for a record label, the source and the destination
    both outlined in the name itself. Much like Motown in the 1960s declaring itself ""The Sound of Young America"", Philadelphia International aimed to conquer the
    world with a specific, auteur-driven sound steeped in the roots of one major
    American metropolis-- and the auteurs in question were Kenneth Gamble and Leon
    Huff, who stood as the primary architects of the 1970s' upwardly-mobile
    orchestral version of soul. Their productions' opulence, smoothness, and chops-- abetted by MFSB, one of the great studio bands in music history-- paved the
    way for disco, sparked inspiration in Elton John and David Bowie, and acted as
    the soulful but crossover-friendly counterpart to the decade's wild-assed,
    post-Sly Stone funk much in the same way Berry Gordy's meticulous empire offset
    the grittiness of Stax and Atlantic. MFSB's ""T.S.O.P. (The Sound of
    Philadelphia)"" had only one line, ""people all over the world""-- an echo of the
    underlying sentiment from one of the label's big early smashes, the O'Jays' ""Love
    Train"", but also a clear statement of who, exactly, they were aiming their
    music towards.</p><p>
<em>The Sound of Philadelphia:
    Gamble &amp; Huff's Greatest Hits </em>is a not entirely thorough yet almost unfailingly great cross-section
    of singles focusing largely on the label's peak years in the early-mid 70s.
    Just about everything you need to know about the Gamble and Huff approach is
    covered in the comp's first two songs, both from the O'Jays' 1972 breakthrough
    LP <em>Back Stabbers</em>-- the optimistic idyll of global-peace dance number
    ""Love Train"", and the more cynical (and pragmatic) duplicity warnings of ""Back
    Stabbers"". They both feature the songwriting and production team's greatest
    strengths-- a simple, economic usage of lyricism that worked in both a rhythmic
    and melodic sense (listen to the way the chorus to ""Back Stabbers"" unfurls from
    the slow, sinister glide of ""they <em>smiiiiiile</em>  in your face"" to the
    rapidfire finger-jabs of ""all the time they wanna-take-your-place""), backed
    with a fine balance of punchy, out-front grooves and almost delicate orchestral
    ornamentation. All that, with the vocal interplay of lead singer Eddie Levert
    and backups Walter Williams and William Powell-- well, it's nothing short of
    world-beating.</p><p>
    The rest of the compilation
    is filled with songs that hit the top five on both the r&amp;b and pop charts-- Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' elegiac, gorgeous ""If You Don't Know Me By
    Now"" (a career-making performance from the young singer Teddy Pendergrass);
    Billy Paul's sly yet guilt-wracked infidelity ballad ""Me and Mrs. Jones""; the
    Three Degrees' ""When Will I See You Again"", which made longing sound strangely
    peppy. It's telling that seven of the compilation's 14 tracks fall in a
    two-year span, and once it gets past 1972-1973 things
    get even more lush and orchestrated, until it flirts with adult contemporary
    sounds. But given the singers-- the velvety rumble of Lou Rawls in ""You'll
    Never Find Another Love Like Mine"", or the old-school street-corner doo-wop
    flourishes of the Intruders' ""I'll Always Love My Mama""-- there's a sense that
    this sound of middle-class luxury was hard-achieved from the ground floor up. Throw
    in a couple late-period ballads by Pendergrass (""Close the Door"") and Patti
    Labelle (""If Only You Knew"", the only post-70s track
    in the collection) and McFadden &amp; Whitehead's ""Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now""-- disco's greatest moment of populist hubris-- and it's clear that Philadelphia
    International's peak didn't taper off much.
    Like many Greatest Hits
    albums, especially label-centered ones, <em>The Sound of Philadelphia</em> does
    have that ever-present Catch-22-- the only real weakness in the songs included
    here is an overwhelming (if comforting) familiarity, but it's also easy to
    wonder why some equally familiar songs were left out; there's plenty other
    places to hear the O'Jays' ""For the Love of Money"", but why not here, too? At least the
    gaps don't cut out too much context or history; it's a shame we don't get to
    hear Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes' rapturous lament ""Bad Luck"" or the
    euphoria of MFSB's disco blueprint ""Love Is the Message"" (dubbed by some
    discophiles and B-boys, in a bit of scene-traversing appropriation, as
    ""Brooklyn's National Anthem""), but their absence doesn't alter the collection's
    disposition much. There's one regrettably missing track that could've
    underlined one of Philadelphia International's strongest characteristics-- 1977's
    ""Let's Clean Up the Ghetto"", an all-star neighborhood-revival benefit record
    featuring Rawls, Pendergrass, Paul, the O'Jays, &amp; Dee Dee Sharp, was one of
    the label's many endeavors set up to give back to their city-- but the rest of
    the label's unique character is intact.
    </p><p>
    Or at least the unique
    character that the Top 40 listener knew. <em>Conquer the World: The Lost Soul of
    Philadelphia International Records</em> is a counterpart to <em>Gamble &amp;
    Huff's Greatest Hits</em>-- Philadelphia without the international, a locally focused collection of bands and
    singers who could lay claim to contributing to the sound of Philadelphia while
    frequently sounding little like their chart-topping labelmates from the very
    same area code. Despite the presence of seven songs co-written by either Gamble
    or Huff (five involving both), their imprint isn't as obvious here, and some of
    the songs they did write aren't so easily identifiable as such. People's Choice-- also represented on <em>The Sound of Philadelphia</em> by the elastic
    disco-funk of ""Do It Any Way You Wanna""-- deliver some bluesy, full-throated Southern-style
    soul belting on the Huff-penned ""The Big Hurt"", Ruth McFadden's ""Ghetto Woman
    (Parts 1 &amp; 2)"" features a brassy, fuzz-guitar-drenched arrangement that
    sounds calculated to one-up every ""Theme from Shaft""-geeked coattail rider on
    the r&amp;b charts, and David ""Bunny"" Sigler &amp; Dee Dee Sharp's ""Conquer the World
    Together"" is a great recapturing of the chemistry that Marvin Gaye and Tammi
    Terrell sparked in the studio together.
    </p>
    In fact, it's Sigler who makes his presence known in <em>Conquer the
    World</em>'s most memorable and eccentric moments. As one of Gamble and Huff's
    longest and closest collaborators, Sigler proved himself to be a versatile
    lyricist and arranger, not to mention a helluva performer. Aside from ""Conquer
    the World Together"", he also delivers on ""Everybody Needs Good Lovin' (Parts 1 &amp;
    2)"", a fiery 1971 single that almost comes across like an answer to Wilson
    Pickett's 1970 Philly-recorded, Gamble &amp; Huff-penned hit ""Get Me Back on
    Time, Engine Number 9"". And Bunny winds up beating Carl Douglas and his trail
    of kung-fu-alikes to the one-inch punch by a good year or so with 1973's ""Theme
    for <em>Five Fingers of Death</em>"", an unofficial title song to the Shaw
    Brothers classic, punctuated by twangy guitar and percussive backhand slaps and
    a ton of martial arts pontificating (""I've given you my secret technique for
    the Iron Fist. Always use it in the cause of justice. Never use it for personal

    was a purpose-driven appellation for a record label, the source and the destination
    both outlined in the name itself. Much like Motown in the 1960s declaring itself ""The Sound of Young America"", Philadelphia International aimed to conquer the
    world with a specific, auteur-driven sound steeped in the roots of one major
    American metropolis-- and the auteurs in question were Kenneth Gamble and Leon
    Huff, who stood as the primary architects of the 1970s' upwardly-mobile
    orchestral version of soul. Their productions' opulence, smoothness, and chops-- abetted by MFSB, one of the great studio bands in music history-- paved the
    way for disco, sparked inspiration in Elton John and David Bowie, and acted as
    the soulful but crossover-friendly counterpart to the decade's wild-assed,
    post-Sly Stone funk much in the same way Berry Gordy's meticulous empire offset
    the grittiness of Stax and Atlantic. MFSB's ""T.S.O.P. (The Sound of
    Philadelphia)"" had only one line, ""people all over the world""-- an echo of the
    underlying sentiment from one of the label's big early smashes, the O'Jays' ""Love
    Train"", but also a clear statement of who, exactly, they were aiming their
    music towards.</p><p>
<em>The Sound of Philadelphia:
    Gamble &amp; Huff's Greatest Hits </em>is a not entirely thorough yet almost unfailingly great cross-section
    of singles focusing largely on the label's peak years in the early-mid 70s.
    Just about everything you need to know about the Gamble and Huff approach is
    covered in the comp's first two songs, both from the O'Jays' 1972 breakthrough
    LP <em>Back Stabbers</em>-- the optimistic idyll of global-peace dance number
    ""Love Train"", and the more cynical (and pragmatic) duplicity warnings of ""Back
    Stabbers"". They both feature the songwriting and production team's greatest
    strengths-- a simple, economic usage of lyricism that worked in both a rhythmic
    and melodic sense (listen to the way the chorus to ""Back Stabbers"" unfurls from
    the slow, sinister glide of ""they <em>smiiiiiile</em>  in your face"" to the
    rapidfire finger-jabs of ""all the time they wanna-take-your-place""), backed
    with a fine balance of punchy, out-front grooves and almost delicate orchestral
    ornamentation. All that, with the vocal interplay of lead singer Eddie Levert
    and backups Walter Williams and William Powell-- well, it's nothing short of
    world-beating.</p><p>
    The rest of the compilation
    is filled with songs that hit the top five on both the r&amp;b and pop charts-- Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' elegiac, gorgeous ""If You Don't Know Me By
    Now"" (a career-making performance from the young singer Teddy Pendergrass);
    Billy Paul's sly yet guilt-wracked infidelity ballad ""Me and Mrs. Jones""; the
    Three Degrees' ""When Will I See You Again"", which made longing sound strangely
    peppy. It's telling that seven of the compilation's 14 tracks fall in a
    two-year span, and once it gets past 1972-1973 things
    get even more lush and orchestrated, until it flirts with adult contemporary
    sounds. But given the singers-- the velvety rumble of Lou Rawls in ""You'll
    Never Find Another Love Like Mine"", or the old-school street-corner doo-wop
    flourishes of the Intruders' ""I'll Always Love My Mama""-- there's a sense that
    this sound of middle-class luxury was hard-achieved from the ground floor up. Throw
    in a couple late-period ballads by Pendergrass (""Close the Door"") and Patti
    Labelle (""If Only You Knew"", the only post-70s track
    in the collection) and McFadden &amp; Whitehead's ""Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now""-- disco's greatest moment of populist hubris-- and it's clear that Philadelphia
    International's peak didn't taper off much.
    Like many Greatest Hits
    albums, especially label-centered ones, <em>The Sound of Philadelphia</em> does
    have that ever-present Catch-22-- the only real weakness in the songs included
    here is an overwhelming (if comforting) familiarity, but it's also easy to
    wonder why some equally familiar songs were left out; there's plenty other
    places to hear the O'Jays' ""For the Love of Money"", but why not here, too? At least the
    gaps don't cut out too much context or history; it's a shame we don't get to
    hear Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes' rapturous lament ""Bad Luck"" or the
    euphoria of MFSB's disco blueprint ""Love Is the Message"" (dubbed by some
    discophiles and B-boys, in a bit of scene-traversing appropriation, as
    ""Brooklyn's National Anthem""), but their absence doesn't alter the collection's
    disposition much. There's one regrettably missing track that could've
    underlined one of Philadelphia International's strongest characteristics-- 1977's
    ""Let's Clean Up the Ghetto"", an all-star neighborhood-revival benefit record
    featuring Rawls, Pendergrass, Paul, the O'Jays, &amp; Dee Dee Sharp, was one of
    the label's many endeavors set up to give back to their city-- but the rest of
    the label's unique character is intact.
    </p><p>
    Or at least the unique
    character that the Top 40 listener knew. <em>Conquer the World: The Lost Soul of
    Philadelphia International Records</em> is a counterpart to <em>Gamble &amp;
    Huff's Greatest Hits</em>-- Philadelphia without the international, a locally focused collection of bands and
    singers who could lay claim to contributing to the sound of Philadelphia while
    frequently sounding little like their chart-topping labelmates from the very
    same area code. Despite the presence of seven songs co-written by either Gamble
    or Huff (five involving both), their imprint isn't as obvious here, and some of
    the songs they did write aren't so easily identifiable as such. People's Choice-- also represented on <em>The Sound of Philadelphia</em> by the elastic
    disco-funk of ""Do It Any Way You Wanna""-- deliver some bluesy, full-throated Southern-style
    soul belting on the Huff-penned ""The Big Hurt"", Ruth McFadden's ""Ghetto Woman
    (Parts 1 &amp; 2)"" features a brassy, fuzz-guitar-drenched arrangement that
    sounds calculated to one-up every ""Theme from Shaft""-geeked coattail rider on
    the r&amp;b charts, and David ""Bunny"" Sigler &amp; Dee Dee Sharp's ""Conquer the World
    Together"" is a great recapturing of the chemistry that Marvin Gaye and Tammi
    Terrell sparked in the studio together.
    </p>
    In fact, it's Sigler who makes his presence known in <em>Conquer the
    World</em>'s most memorable and eccentric moments. As one of Gamble and Huff's
    longest and closest collaborators, Sigler proved himself to be a versatile
    lyricist and arranger, not to mention a helluva performer. Aside from ""Conquer
    the World Together"", he also delivers on ""Everybody Needs Good Lovin' (Parts 1 &amp;
    2)"", a fiery 1971 single that almost comes across like an answer to Wilson
    Pickett's 1970 Philly-recorded, Gamble &amp; Huff-penned hit ""Get Me Back on
    Time, Engine Number 9"". And Bunny winds up beating Carl Douglas and his trail
    of kung-fu-alikes to the one-inch punch by a good year or so with 1973's ""Theme
    for <em>Five Fingers of Death</em>"", an unofficial title song to the Shaw
    Brothers classic, punctuated by twangy guitar and percussive backhand slaps and
    a ton of martial arts pontificating (""I've given you my secret technique for
    the Iron Fist. Always use it in the cause of justice. Never use it for personal
    glory""). It's a far cry from getting on board the Love Train.</div>"|11660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11660-the-sound-of-philadelphia-gamble-huffs-greatest-hitsconquer-the-world-the-lost-soul-of-philadelphia-international-records/|7.5|Nate Patrin

After hearing <em>Walk It Off</em>, though, I don't care to pursue it. Like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, a band whose career appears equally shackled to the blogosphere's mercurial whims, it's tempting to romanticize TnT's rags-to-riches story. Yet on their follow-up <em>Some Loud Thunder</em>, CYHSY didn't just bristle in the limelight, they actively thumbed their nose at it with risky stylistic forays and stubborn hooks. That ending doesn't fit TnT follow-up <em>Walk It Off</em>, a blissfully directionless album guilty not of audacity but utter innocuity.</p><p>
    Not shying from the CYHSY parallel, the band hired <em>Some Loud Thunder</em> producer Dave Fridmann to breathe life into these song skeletons. Judging by <em>The Loon</em>'s prankish ambiguity and touches of psych escapism, Fridmann's mystical touch initially seems like a perfect fit. Unfortunately, these talents don't quite behoove the creative direction TnT veers towards on <em>Walk It Off</em>. Despite Fridmann's track record (Mercury Rev, Flaming Lips, Mogwai, the Delgados), TnT shy away from exploring the canyon-sized depths of sound at their producer's fingertips, instead utilizing his skills for mere decoration-- to the point of nixing the eccentric Pavement-isms of their debut for even more streamlined indie rock.</p><p>
    To say TnT doesn't stir up endorphins in the typical rockist-wired brain would be a lie, but their pleasure principle's less convincing on this textbook sophomore slump. <em>The Loon</em> was upfront about its lack of originality but made sure the listener could at least have fun connecting the dots, noting the Pixies riff here, the Built to Spill jam there. By comparison, <em>Walk It Off'</em>s nods to its influences are too broad and underdeveloped to pursue. Sure, you can hear indie signifiers like the ""Le Ruse""'s octave riff barrage or the deadpan Beatles-via-Britpop chord changes on ""Conquest"", but each individual song repeats these tropes too cautiously, worried an impromptu psych vamp or rawk-out outro would shatter its contents.</p><p>
    Amid such simplistic arrangements, a large onus falls on frontman Josh Grier's vocals. An astute Stephen Malkmus scholar, Grier again proves capable of crafting lyrics that, while arcane and often mumbled, manage to evoke strong emotions in small, timely snippets. On ""Lines""' epic build, Grier's repeated yelps of ""Over line!"" work in tandem with an off-kilter lead guitar to construct one of the album's only successful attempts at big-stakes rock. On the Modest Mouse-y ballad ""Time of Songs"", Grier remains stubbornly unintelligible, though the discernible line ""I'll pull you from the bottom/ And I'll leave you on the floor"" contains enough emotional weight to make the track stick. Yet despite being the wordsmith behind lines like <em>The Loon</em>'s catch phrase ""like Harvard Square holds all inane,"" Grier's not a Morrissey or Bob Dylan; his enigmatic charm doesn't justify the use of instrumentation as mere lyrical scaffolding. Limp tracks like ""Say Back Something"" or ""Anvil""  can't subsist on a delicately strummed chord alone, and if you're gonna name a song ""George Michael"", it's gotta have a better punchline than Vaudeville horns and a half-assed white noise guitar solo.</p><p>
    By nearly all accounts, though, this album could be much worse. Many of the band's best features remain intact, especially their total lack of pretentiousness and austerity. You won't find any symphony-backed lumps of schmaltz or ill-advised stabs at dire social issues, and hey, they even named a very serviceable track here ""The Dirty Dirty"". However, <em>Walk It Off</em> attempts <em>The Loon</em>'s indie patchwork using fewer and larger pieces, causing less-than-stellar ideas and riffs to suddenly become load-bearing pillars for painfully linear three-minute pop songs. As opposed to their ramshackle debut, TnT don't unknowingly stumble upon infectious choruses or head-turning transitions anymore, they contort flimsy songs to contain those elements.<br/></p></div>"|11381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11381-walk-it-off/|5.9|Adam Moerder

Reviews have offered afropop, math rock, and techno as reference; the band members themselves cite Gwen Stefani and Steve Reich. <em>Antidotes</em> suggests these are mostly red herrings. Foals are squarely in a more recent and less exotic tradition-- the hi-gloss end of the post-punk revival: Think a more playful Bloc Party, a more measured Futureheads, a less heartfelt Maxïmo Park.</p><p>
    That's not to say they lack their own sound. If some of the UK press have seized on ""math rock"" as a way to describe the largely 4/4 Foals it's less because they fit the genre and more that their best tracks sound like they were plotted on grid paper: oblique instrumental vectors crossing, rotating and transforming. In concert videos the guitarists face each other, instruments high and tight against their chests, reflecting one another on an invisible y-axis, shutting the audience out. The stances fit the songwriting: Foals are a band who offer their listeners little in the way of graspable emotion or explanation, but sometimes make up for that with momentum and intrigue.</p><p>
    Take ""Cassius"", for instance: Breathless, contorted ska-pop, built around high, nervy guitar lines and stuttering brass, with Yannis Philippakis' plummy yelping prominent in the mix. Repeat listens make sense of the sound, reveal the excitement in the muddle-- but the content? It might be about Muhammad Ali. It might be about the Roman Senate. You may as well flip a coin, since it doesn't remotely matter which-- you can thrill to ""Cassius"", you can dance to it, you can admire its construction, but there's something chilly about its aggressive abstraction.</p><p>
    So what? Aren't thrills and admiration enough? On tracks as propulsive as ""Cassius"" and its fellow single ""Balloons"" the answer's yes. ""Balloons"" actually has one of the album's stickier lines-- <em>""We fly balloons on this fuel called love""</em>-- but is still driven by how its syllables dance and swing, not how they connect. Both singles also use the Antibalas horns-- intermittent guests throughout the album-- to excellent effect, enlivening and widening a slightly arid sound.  The brass takes Foals into the tense, mournful spaces the English Beat once explored, and they feel at home there.</p><p>
    When the tempo drops, the problems begin. As tracks like ""Red Socks Pugie"" and ""Heavy Water"" slow down, the band loses its crispness and instead of weaving around one another the instruments tread on each others toes, with good hooks lost in a murky coagulate. Worse, Philippakis' voice feels more exposed. It's a blunt tool at best, a kind of blank bark: each word given the same pained heft. On the album's longest track, ""Big Big Love (Fig. 2)"", he's repeats the dramatic line <em>""Oh! Electric shocks! No!""</em> again and again as the band wind down. He's demanding our attention but, without any discernible emotional context, doing nothing to earn it. The effect is excruciating.</p><p>
    These moments of misplaced weight make <em>Antidotes</em> hard to recommend, but there are good ideas and moments all over the record. The delicate ""Olympic Airways"" makes a wistful virtue of the drones and echoes that bog the band down elsewhere, and even finds a prettier register to Philippakis' vocals. ""Two Steps, Twice"" and ""Tron"" aren't as memorable as the singles but share their appealing intensity.</p><p>
    And it's likely Foals know their strengths and potential. They ditched Dave Sitek's original mix of <em>Antidotes</em> for an overuse of reverb, and they left their first buzz-building singles off the record, preferring to look forward. They've also taken pains in interviews to disassociate themselves from the moribund main current of British indie. That's a wise and admirable stance, but it's not showing up in their music quite yet.</p></div>"|11372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11372-antidotes/|5.9|Tom Ewing

He keeps busy with a number of bands and collaborations within the Portland music scene, whether it's drumming for punk band Emergency, working with improvisational trio Nudge, or recording under his solo electronic music guise, Strategy. Even within his solo work, Dickow avoids all the usual signifiers that might align him with a signature sound. Listen to Strategy's 2007 record <em>Future Rock</em> on an especially balmy night and you'd swear it was rooted in grimy 1970s funk. On a rainy day, its fluid repetition seems more at home in the auspices of the early Krautrockers. Still further insight gained by introspection in the dead of winter might place Dickow's solo project in the icy depths inhabited by Boards of Canada.</p><p>
    The fact is that Strategy inhabits all these places at once. He's never afraid to try something new, is rather unconcerned with musical continuity, and is often proud to lack allegiance to an established musical identity. Even the name ""Strategy"" seems to be chosen to reflect a plan, not a person. In a pinch, <em>Future Rock</em>'s closest reference is perhaps Byrne &amp; Eno's <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</em>, and it is a rough one at that. Now, in a complete non-shocker, Strategy's new <em>Music for Lamping</em> fully commits to <em>Future Rock</em>'s sense of ambiance at the expense of its rock signifiers.</p><p>
    Stylistically, <em>Music for Lamping</em> plays more formally, and that makes it oddly more challenging. On the surface, the record is pretty simple: repeated progressions and loops for anywhere from five to 15 minutes at a time, with the odd bit of color and fuzz passing in and out of the mix. It would be tempting to reduce the record to the vagaries of ambient or drone, but the glistening oscillations of songs like opener ""I Can't Stand The Rain"" seem a lot more selfish (and listenable) than you'd expect from music using those labels.</p><p>
    Dickow is captivated by the ability to distill the enchanted spark powering <em>Future Rock</em> into pulsating, organic works, and he does that by removing percussion and almost all senses of progression. These compositions have stewed over for a long time (some of which came from a canceled 2002 ambient record for Tigerbeat6) but, even with six years of dust, sound like they could have been recorded yesterday. They also sound like they could have been recorded thirty years ago, as is the case with ""Lower Macleay"", which can trace direct lineage back to Klaus Schulze's <em>Moondawn</em>, and ""Cathedral Spark"" and ""All Day..."" which sound like lost Cluster &amp; Eno pieces. </p><p>
    It doesn't always work: ""Bike Click"", one of the more chaotic compositions, makes aggressive overtures at the outset, but never builds into the dramatic, threatening climax it seems to hint it could become. By the same token, listeners expecting the same soulful electronic music as Strategy's early work are in for a surprise from a forceful but taciturn group of works full of personality but too somber for someone without a stomach for ambient music. Still, <em>Music For Lamping</em> is a nice indicator that Dickow is willing to explore in-depth one of the many styles from which he borrows, and to attempt to run it through an aesthetic filter that is true to both him and the style. It complements his beat-oriented, melodic work by providing some insight into the stylistic backbone of those efforts. In another non-shocker, Dickow seems most committed to a rule that is key to making music: there are no rules.</p></div>"|11345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11345-music-for-lamping/|7.5|Mike Orme

    The Duke Spirit's bare-boned debut, 2005's <em>Cuts Across the Land</em>, flourished on the charming improbability of its artistic success. Surrounded by little hype, the British quintet cooked up ornery blues-rock that should've been rendered superfluous by similarly bluesy marquee acts like the Kills and White Stripes. Yet <em>Cuts</em>' murky sonics and dark lyrics mystified a genre that's become almost painfully familiar to listeners this decade. <em>Neptune</em>, on the other hand, practically screams that the band's ready for their close-up, and the band buckles under the pressure of an album where artistic (and possibly financial) success is expected.</p><p>
    With Queens of the Stone Age producer and Masters of Reality founder Chris Goss behind the boards, the band took the next logical step and transplanted to Southern California to record <em>Neptune</em>. Don't confuse the album for a Desert Session, though. For one, there's a pretty overt nautical theme running these thirteen tracks, but even more surprisingly, the band's no-frills sound shows shrugs off the peyote-driven haze inherent in nearly everything Goss touches. Instead, Goss airbrushes the cold droning guitars a tad and fills the unintentional canyons of reverb with something more professional, but otherwise it's the same old Duke Spirit.</p><p>
    Single ""The Step and the Walk"" sports some time-tested blues heartbreak as frontwoman Liela Moss opines over a straightforward riff. Although her signature husky alto remains intact, the heightened recording clarity draws increased attention to stock lines like ""I'm moving to the end of your loving."" This becomes problematic when the band attempts a power ballad like ""Wooden Heart"", leaving a wistful Saddle Creek sentiment (""I would understand your heart/ If I could feel it"") out to dry amidst instrumentation that's nurtured to the point of boredom. That's not to say Goss' skills add nothing to the Spirit's swagger. The tumbling slide guitar on ""This Ship Was Built to Last"" exorcises many of PJ Harvey's Desert Session highlights, and the flurry of droning piano keys on ""Send a Little Love Token"" adds a nuanced texture to the band's raw sound.
    </p>
<p>
    For songwriters so ambivalent about their tuneful side, the Spirit take their biggest steps forward here on slower, weirder folk numbers. ""Dog Roses"" sounds like a haunting sea chantey, benefiting especially from Moss' erratic melody and a dissonant yet hummable chorus of ""oooh's""-- a welcome departure from <em>Neptune</em>'s glut of forced rock choruses. Closer ""Sovereign"" does its best to defrost the album's emotionally detached chill, though it's up against several tracks worth of numb rawk, and that's the double-edged sword on <em>Neptune</em>. The Spirit still play hard-to-get, which helps to avoid any ridiculous moments on this polished sophomore effort, but they're often too stand-offish to even challenge the listener, let alone push the envelope that their influences have so neatly prepared for them. Somehow they emerge from the desert with less of an aura of mystery than they entered with, granting us only the occasional mirage.

Not only did the single from the Swedish indie-pop trio's 2006 album <em>Writer's Block</em> hit #13 in the UK and crack the Top 40 in Germany and the Netherlands. Not only was it sampled by Kanye West and covered by everyone from the Kooks, James Blunt, and Pete Yorn to ""99 Luftballons"" singer Nena and Japanese folk-popper Shugo Tokumaru. Not only has it appeared on TV shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""How I Met Your Mother"", in commercials for Budweiser and AT&amp;T. Why, the catchy little thing even charted in the U.S.-- where <em>Writer's Block</em> has sold roughly 160,000 copies.</p><p>
    None of which quite explains why the guy who sings male lead on ""Young Folks"", Peter Morén, has chosen to follow his group's breakthrough with, umm, a meandering folk-pop solo album loosely inspired by the sad tale of a studio-era Hollywood mogul whose passion for his work causes him to miss out on life. <em>The Last Tycoon</em>, now known as <em>The Love of the Last Tycoon</em>, was the final, unfinished novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The 1973 film adaptation, starring Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson, was the final (finished) movie by <em>On the Waterfront</em> director Elia Kazan. And Morén? Presumably, he's just getting started. And it shows, in a set of slow, plaintive love songs that flash occasional glimmers of his band's charms, but too often fail to even stand out over their stripped-down arrangements.</p><p>
    It's not Morén's indulging his self-professed ""Dylanhead"" status that hobbles <em>The Last Tycoon</em>. Folk-flecked acoustic guitar underpins some of the better songs here, stretching out beneath the caustic rasp of the handclap- and piano-splashed digital single ""Social Competence"" or dancing beneath harmonica on casual, intimate finale ""I Don't Gaze at the Sky for Long"", which alludes to filmmaker François Truffaut. ""Le Petit Coeur"", the track Morén tells <em>Billboard</em> gave him the idea for this project, adds strings and rumbling piano for an ominous, bilingual song about nighttime skulking, tribal conflict, and relationship brinksmanship: ""If you lock me out again, I may not come back to seek you,"" Morén sings.
    </p><p>
    The album's vague concept can't be blamed for the disappointment, either. Sure, loping opener ""Reel Too Real""-- with its synths, tubular bells, and knee-slaps-- examines the difference between images and reality. And Bert Jansch-esque six-minute epic ""This Is What I Came For"" is a cinematic character portrait: ""You're the spoiled white kid with clenched white teeth."" But it'll take way better Fitzgerald scholars than me to find other potential connections.
    </p>
<p>
    See, this points to the album's main problem: a failure to communicate. Fellow Swedish singer/songwriter José González keeps his lyrics elemental and his playing atmospheric, but neither Morén's voice nor the samey folkie backing here are strong enough to add interest to the clumsy rhymes and lackluster tunes of songs like ""Tell Me in Time"". Same goes for the sparsely orchestrated ""Missing Link"": ""I've found the missing link, the missing link/ No longer do I have to think, have to think."" Morén's words and melodies were as big a part of the appeal of his songs on <em>Writer's Block</em> as was Björn Yttling's reverby production, so again, it's not as if Morén hasn't done stuff like this well before.
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, he even does it here. Only once, on the electric guitar-based ""My Match"". With a spaciousness that's the closest <em>The Last Tycoon</em> comes, sonically, to <em>Writer's Block</em>, Morén delivers the album's deftest hook-- ""I can't say that I plead guilty of theft/ But I agree I've done you wrong""-- and backs it up with a plea to ""trust me, I trust you"", mirrored by weeping lead guitar. On the Cat Stevens-like piano confessional ""Twisted"", spiced up by Spanish guitar and güiro, Morén sings, ""Don't overrate yourself/ It could have been someone else."" I wouldn't go that far. But <em>The Last Tycoon</em> shows that although Morén may not suffer from writer's block, he'd be smart to withhold some of his output. A lot like the rest of us.

That Wiggs has resurfaced after a decade to play the role of Breeders cheerleader speaks volumes about the kind of faith and goodwill Kim and Kelley Deal have accrued over the years, despite a career that's nearly derailed on more than a few occasions due to the sisters' well-documented substance abuse and the group's peculiar recording habits and revolving-door rhythm sections. After hearing <em>Mountain Battles</em>, Wiggs admits her reaction was: ""Why aren't I playing on this album?"" Her excitement is genuine-- <em>Mountain Battles</em> is indeed the best Breeders album since 1993's <em>Last Splash</em>.</p><p>
    Which, of course, isn't saying a helluva lot, given that the 15 years in between have produced but one official record: 2002's <em>Title TK</em>, whose nine-years-in-the-waiting build-up was far too great a weight for its brittle, often sluggish low-fi pop oddities to withstand. In lieu of a return-to-form, we simply had to be content with the fact that the Breeders had returned at all. However, in contrast to all the uncertainty that hung over the band pre-<em>Title TK</em>, the Breeders approached <em>Mountain Battles</em> from a position of relative stability, with bassist Mando Lopez, drummer Jose Medeles, and producer Steve Albini all returning for another go; the six-year gap between that album and <em>Mountain Battles</em> is easily accounted for by Kim's entry into rehab in 2002 and the subsequent Pixies reunion tours that kept her on the road for the better part of 2004-05. But true to the Breeders tradition of tellingly apropos album titles (the hermetically sealed claustrophobia of 1990's <em>Pod</em>, the breakthrough/burn-out of <em>Last Splash</em>, the work-in-progress feel of <em>Title TK</em>), <em>Mountain Battles</em> suggests that all those Pixies paychecks don't make the Breeders' business any easier. If <em>Title TK</em> was a tentative first step back into the public eye, <em>Mountain Battles</em> finds Kim and Kelley proudly venerating the Breeders' battle-scarred history and bull-headed perseverance.</p><p>
    Like <em>Last Splash</em>'s ""New Year"", <em>Mountain Battles</em>' ""Overglazed"" is more intro than proper opener: Over an ascendant surge of swirling backward-looped guitars and crashing drums, Kim repeats the song's lone lyric-- ""I can...I can feel it!""-- like someone who's just woken from a coma. Or, in her case, it's someone who's reconnected with a muse that only seems to appear every half-decade or so, which would explain her tendency to linger on a feeling: ""Night of Joy"" plays up the contrast between its sweet, girl-group melody and the song's hauntingly absent ambience (much like Kim's star cameo on Sonic Youth's 1995 creeper ""Little Trouble Girl""); the optimistic rebirth narrative of ""We're Going to Rise"" playfully jibes with the song's lethargic waltz rhythm, as if slowing down the action lets her better savor the moment of peace.  </p><p>
    With such deliberately spare presentation, <em>Mountain Battles</em> takes some time to warm up to (and new-wave toss-offs like ""Bang On"" still carry traces of<em> Title TK</em>'s song-sketch incompletion), but then Kim and Kelley Deal's pretty sing-song harmonies and affable Ohio charm can distract us from how difficult the Breeders' music can be-- both for them as players and us as listeners. By this point, that very sense of struggle is intrinsic to the Breeders sound: It's pretty amazing that after all those years of line-up changes and aborted recording sessions, the Breeders pretty much sound exactly the same as they ever did, the quirks, hiccups, and sputters once attributed to a certain amateurish enthusiasm sounding ever more like purposeful components of their bubblegum bricolage. (See: the basement-Zeppelin chug of ""No Way"".)</p><p>
    No, there isn't a ""Cannonball"" here, but the buoyant, bass-driven strutter ""Walk It Off"" makes for a dandy companion piece to <em>Pod</em>'s ""Only in 3's""; Kelley's power-pop pick-me-up ""It's the Love"" gleams with a ""Divine Hammer"" shimmer; and the sisters' voices have never sounded finer than on the country-harmony duet ""Here No More"". But <em>Mountain Battles</em>' air of revitalization-- the thing that has Wiggs wishing she had her old job back-- is characterized not just by these straight pop shooters, but the apparent glee with which the Deals toss out the curveballs: the Teutonic-tongued oompa-loompa punk of ""German Studies"", the Spanish-sung slow dance ""Regalame Esta Noche"" and the bizarro rumble-in-the-jungle group chant of ""Istanbul"". Once upon a time, bands used to model their careers on copping the Breeders' moves (see: Salt, Veruca). <em>Mountain Battles</em>' greatest success is it makes that very idea seem once again like both an admirable ideal, and an unachievable one.</p></div>"|11367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11367-mountain-battles/|7.5|Stuart Berman

    Of all the female singer-songwriters who inhabit the
    borderland between actual country and general roots music, few have as much
    presence as Kathleen Edwards. The Canadian inhabits her gritty tunes with the
    kind of authority that should come from real experience. Hopefully, she hasn't
    lived through all of her songs, which document rankled love and hard times in
    grave detail. Over three albums in just five years, she's proven herself a more
    capably imaginative and intuitive songwriter than Tift Merritt, Allison Moorer,
    or even post-<em>Car Wheels</em> Lucinda Williams.
    Edwards may not have the commanding voice of Neko Case, but she usually has
    better words to sing.</p><p>
    What immediately sets her third and best album, <em>Asking for Flowers</em>, apart from her two
    previous collections is the opener. Both her 2003 debut, <em>Failer</em>, and her 2005 follow-up, <em>Back
    to Me,</em> kicked off with their best tunes, two hard-hitting, uptempo numbers
    that told the story of a petty crook and his exasperated lover. <em>Asking for Flowers</em> starts with ""Buffalo"",
    a downtempo song that shows off Edwards' new piano chops (she taught herself to
    play for this album) and her distinctive voice on the swirling chorus. It also
    features what sounds like an autobiographical angle, which is rare for Edwards:
    She sings about crossing the border into America
    and wondering if Customs will allow her to return. ""Buffalo""
    isn't just a slow opener, but it's about paperwork.</p><p>
    If the song promises a more somber album than what came
    before, ""The Cheapest Key"" kicks those expectations in the teeth. Using an easy
    mnemonic that makes it sound like she wrote the song in ten minutes (""A is for
    all the times I bit my tongue / B is for bullshit and you fed me some""),
    Edwards takes a slash-and-burn approach, essentially going ballistic on
    whichever lout has dared to cross her. Her studio backing band, which includes
    members of the Heartbreakers (Tom Petty's, not Richard Hell's), have her back.
    Occasionally, they pad their part, as on the six-and-a-half-minute closer
    ""Goodnight, California"", but
    generally, they bolster her vocals without intruding on the spotlight.
    </p>
<p>
    The best moment in ""The Cheapest Key"" is Edwards spitting
    the line, ""F is my favorite letter, as you know,"" which has both sexual and
    bird-flipping connotations. She peppers her songs with lines like that, not necessarily
    ambiguous but surprisingly frank, the kind that make you stop short. In the
    title track, about a beleaguered wife, it's the second half of the chorus:
    ""Don't tell me you're too tired/ 10 years I've been working nights."" In the
    wrenching ""Alicia Ross"", about a real-life case of a woman abducted and killed
    by her neighbor, it's the opening line: ""I am a girl with a forgettable face.""
    In ""Scared at Night"", it's pretty much every line. Delivering these lyrics, she
    sings herself nearly hoarse, as if mustering the conviction to convey these
    hardluck stories properly. There's a combativeness to Edwards' singing and
    songwriting, as if she knows she's working in a genre that favors tasteful
    decorum and too often churns out sonic wallpaper. On <em>Asking for Flowers</em>, she sounds better than her peers for being so
    much braver.

His former band, who are still going strong, made their name channeling the lean, driving sound of early 1980s New York outfits like Liquid Liquid and ESG; Arp, though a very different animal, is just as heavily indebted to the music of a specific time and place. The most obvious inspiration for this project is West Germany in the first half of the 70s, when the artistically inclined kids born around the time of WWII began to hit their stride creatively. Think early Kraftwerk on Phillips, Cluster, Popol Vuh, Tangerine Dream; though each has a hugely varied body of work, all were electronic music pioneers with their eyes and ears trained on the future.</p><p>To Georgopoulos' credit, <em>In Light</em> doesn't come across as a retro exercise so much as an attempt to capture a certain spirit. Titles allude to his forbearers (hard to see a track called ""St. Tropez"" without thinking of Pink Floyd's 1971 LP <em>Meddle</em>, ""Premonition of the Sculptor Steiner"" references a Werner Herzog film and, by extension, an accompanying Popol Vuh score) and vintage synths abound, but the overall mood doesn't feel overly tethered to the era. What Georgopoulos capturers most of the age is an approach to sound that made electronics seem warm, friendly, natural, perhaps inevitable, and above all optimistic.</p><p>The post-moonshot days of the early 70s-- like the 50s and the 90s-- were a time when it seemed as though technology might save us yet. <em>In Light</em> reflects a grounded, idealistic mindset; the music is not especially psychedelic, and clarity is prized over drugginess. The percolating ""Potentialities"" is the spaciest track, its fat, sequenced bass made for either stargazing or a show at the planetarium, but it still has an innocent cast. Even further in this direction is the clean, bright pulse of ""St. Tropez"", which brings to mind Raymond Scott trying to engineer the ultimate aural environment in which to raise babies. Only the 15-minute drone piece ""Odyssey (For Bas Jan Ader)"", its midrange-heavy synths burred with distortion, flirts with an unsettling atmosphere, but even here it's more a sense of anticipation than dread. All tracks are simple, effective, and easy to grasp, letting a few elements and subtle changes do loads of work.</p>
<p>Most subtle of all is ""The Rising Sun"", which is perhaps the best example of Georgopoulos hearing the music of the past in a fresh way. Sometimes overlooked in discussion of the kosmisch pioneers is that they unwittingly invented new age. These acts weren't above teasing out a pure mood piece, something placid and meditative that was unashamedly in tune with Aquarian-age spirituality. ""The Rising Sun"", built with resonant piano clusters that seem to tumble down waterfall-style and a soothing whistle-like tone that brings to mind Florian Schneider's flute, strikes me as sort of brave in its delicacy. It flirts with a sphere of music many consider verboten and then, eventually, Georgopoulos brings through a bassy drone to shake up the calm and give the track some bite. The track's free use of acoustic instruments and familiar textures shows a pragmatic side also in evidence back in the day. Georgopoulos has a very specific vibe in mind for Arp, and he uses whatever works; though a small, simple record on the one hand, <em>In Light</em>, on its own terms, is a big success.</p></div>"|11353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11353-in-light/|7.6|Mark Richardson

It's funny to imagine Meloy as such a character, because he's essentially the opposite: self-conscious and bookish instead of blithe and effortlessly cool. The vocal interpreter sets love stories amid contemporary urban centers; Meloy orchestrates romantic tragedies in exotic period locales.</p><p>
    This isn't the first time that Meloy has used the classic ""Sings"" format, although it is the first time he's bringing it to retail. Two previous tour-only EPs covered Morrissey and Shirley Collins. But again, Meloy put his own twist on the tradition. When Mel Torme sang Fred Astaire, or Frank Sinatra sang the Cole Porter songbook, the fundamental idea was the intersection of two musical greats. Torme and Sinatra could captivate a crowd with just charisma; Meloy usually  uses elaborate props and ornate arrangements. His <em>Sings</em> albums sound more like a fan's love letters to his idols than a meeting of titans on a level playing field. <em>Sings Live!</em> is a little different, because it's unseemly to write love letters to one's self, and Meloy handles the material with a blend of irony and self-effacement that becomes its own kind of very modern charm.</p><p>
    The set  includes a broad variety of material: songs from <em>Picaresque</em>, <em>Her Majesty the Decemberists</em>, and <em>Castaways and Cutouts</em>, alongside rarities like ""Devil's Elbow"" (from Meloy's former band, Tarkio) and ""Bandit Queen"" (from the <em>Picaresqueties </em>EP), plus a handful of partial covers and unreleased songs. The mood is convivial during the lulls, as Meloy chats up the crowd in the dry manner of comedian John Hodgman, but turns somber during the songs-- you can practically hear the lights dimming. Stripped-down versions of album tracks are reverently delivered, exposing the affecting melodies that underlie Decemberists' bombastic arrangements, without which they all sound kind of similar. Meloy nods to his inspirations as he sings himself. A snippet of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" piggybacks on ""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"", and a chunk of the Smiths' ""Ask"" closes out ""Youth and Beauty Brigade"". Meloy is more of an assimilator than an interpreter, and the covers, like the Tarkio track, wind up sounding like Decemberists songs, too. 
    </p>
<p>
    Indie music fans are prone to filter even the most intimate experience though a sarcastic veil, and it's this weird dichotomy that characterizes Meloy's interaction with his audience. The making of the live album is mentioned often enough that it might have been titled <em>Colin Meloy Sings Live About Singing Live. </em> On the ""Evoking a Campfire Singalong"" interlude, he says with a touch of weariness, ""The other thing about these solo shows is that they're set up to be like campfire sing-alongs, so you're welcome to sing along as much as you like."" The audience hoots and hollers, but judging from the silence surrounding the songs, no one took the offer seriously. Nor did Meloy: ""Kumbaya"", he says with an audible wink before launching into ""The Gymnast, High Above the Ground"", putting a knowing spin on what might otherwise be perceived as an earnest gesture. It's as if a bunch of people have gotten together to try and create a communal experience they don't quite believe in. It's a little depressing here, but elsewhere, the sense of irony serves the album well.
    </p>
<p>
    One of the unreleased songs, ""Wonder"", is a fine, standard Decemberists-style tune. The other, ""Dracula's Daughter"", is introduced at length by Meloy as ""the worst song I've ever written."" He isn't exaggerating. It's a genuinely heinous song. The guitar part is bad. The lyrics are worse. ""You think you've got it bad? Try having Dracula for your dad."" Meloy plays it slapstick, repeatedly pausing to amplify on a forthcoming cringe-worthy bit, and his audience relishes the kitsch with him. Of course, this kind of self-laceration is only possible because he's got plenty of good songs to balance out this one, which serves to undermine the self-serious impression you might take away from Decemberists albums. It's the rare case where an awful song actually makes an album better.

Despite the temptation to revere/revile the Philly band as a homogenous curio, people forget Man Man's comprised of real people with real emotions. Forget the porn 'staches and Zappa/Beefheart/Waits funhouse gags, 2006's <em>Six Demon Bag</em> was, at the end of the day, an incredibly poignant confessional. In between three-ring antics, Honus lost his heart (and shit) over and over again, most memorably on the standout ballad ""Van Helsing Boombox"", pining to ""sleep for weeks like a dog at her feet."" Fast forward to <em>Rabbit Habits</em> and you'll find Honus still howling like a dog, but of a different breed. Dubbed by the band as their ""pop record,"" <em>Habits </em>knows that sex sells, and suddenly Man Man's starting to sound less archaic. <em>Habits</em>'s steady rock swagger and listener-friendly songwriting stands to convert haters while also retaining the band's beloved quirks: You won't need to rent <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> or own a hurdy gurdy to appreciate this record, just a libido and willingness to rock out.</p><p>
    There's a tendency for a band's maturation to deep-six most their unqiue tics, but Man Man pull a Houdini by releasing an album that simultaneously showcases them at their most cogent <em>and </em>carefree. Unlike past albums, there's not so much garage sale rummaging as search and destroy songwriting. The band's dedicated to nailing certain ideas within the allotted track time and often does so. As a result, we get ""Mister Jung Stuffed"" and ""Top Drawer"", two of Man Man's most single-ready works and the finest entry points for <em>Habits</em>. The latter's particularly jarring, not only because of its confrontational lyrics and brothel boogie, but also for its stark contrast to the romantically waylaid Honus of <em>Six Demon Bag</em>: ""People claim I'm possessed by the devil/ But Mama, I know I'm possessed by your daughter!""</p><p>
    Throughout the record, Honus focuses less on himself than a rogue's gallery of offbeat  characters. ""Hurly/Burly"" tells the tale of a pair of fuckups at odds with society, replete with two refrains of existential screams and the hushed mid-song disclaimer ""This ain't no love song."" That street urchin angst spills over into ""The Ballad of Butter Beans"", where Honus makes death threats to the title character over a Looney Tunes xylophone. In a testament to their refined craftmanship, the debauchery comes full circle by the eight-minute ""Poor Jackie"", an emotionally dampened gypsy stomp that turns a cold shoulder to its star-crossed subject: ""I don't see what everybody/ Sees in your sexy body/ All I see is a shallow grave/ Trapped inside a pretty face."" By the song's conclusion, the band practically dances on her grave, calling out a boisterous horn section before launching into a capella mock gospel and declaring, ""There ain't no God here.""</p><p>
<em>Habits </em>has little to apologize for, no serious blemishes or ill-advised shifts in direction. So why does it fall a hair short of <em>Six Demon Bag</em>, despite being a more cohesive effort? Partly because organization doesn't quite suit Man Man, but moreso because <em>Habits </em>sounds tailored for the stage. Even intimate ballads like ""Doo Right"" and the title track seem more like bellyaching than Honus coming apart at the seams. Still, what we've lost in a bedroom companion we've gained in one of the year's best rock albums (devoid of nearly any guitar parts, mind you). After making a case for melancholy hobo rock, Man Man's not begging for quarters or kisses anymore. Like a vagabond stumbling upon a sack of gold, they're now ready to hit the town and live a little.</p></div>"|11370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11370-rabbit-habits/|8.0|Adam Moerder

    James Brown was brilliant and terrible, a breathtaking innovator and an inept imitator, and even at his peak you never knew which he was going to be on any given day. The fifth volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only comprehensive collection of his singles catches him at both his extremes. These 43 tracks include 11 chart hits, some of them as good as anything anybody recorded in the 1960s-- ""I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)"", ""Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud"", and the unbelievable, skeletal vamp ""Give It Up or Turnit a Loose"", which Alan Leeds' liner notes point out is full of instrumental errors, but, as Leeds puts it, ""what's wrong with a couple fumbles if the team wins the game?""</p><p>
    Some of the other hits, though, you may not have heard of, perhaps with good reason: the undistinguished ballads ""I Guess I'll Have to Cry, Cry, Cry"" and ""Goodbye My Love"", and especially ""America Is My Home"", a patriotic recitation that got him in as much trouble with the Left as his July 1968 tour of Vietnam to entertain troops. (He promptly won radicals back with ""Say It Loud,"" the hottest anthem of the Black Power movement-- which he stopped playing live a few months later.)</p><p>
    The great side of Brown-- aphoristic, emphatic, so rhythmically sharp he could slice diamonds with a grunt-- had two insanely awesome bands in the period documented here. One was his touring group, led by Alfred ""Pee Wee"" Ellis; the other was a white funk band from Cincinnati, the Dapps, who dropkicked ""I Can't Stand Myself"" out of the stadium. Their bassist Tim Drummond subsequently joined the Ellis ensemble for a while (and went on to play with Bob Dylan during his born-again period), and Brown noted that ""Tim's not a white bass player, he's <em>my</em> bass player."" Both the Dapps and the James Brown Band cranked out instrumental singles during this period, sometimes identified by each other's names, and usually working variations on J.B.'s hits: ""Bringing Up the Guitar"" revives a groove from ""Cold Sweat"" (and would later turn into ""The Popcorn""), ""Gittin' a Little Hipper"" does the same for ""Get It Together"", the two-part ""Shades of Brown"" recalls ""Ain't That a Groove"", ""Believers Shall Enjoy (Non Believers Shall Suffer)"" is a vamp from ""Maybe the Last Time"". This set also includes a pair of killer two-part instrumentals, ""Soul Pride"" and ""In the Middle"", on which Soul Brother #1 doesn't actually play.  
    </p>
<p>
    And then there's the embarrassing side of James Brown: the megalomaniac who thought he was a great keyboard player... or a good keyboard player. A lot of his singles at the time featured instrumental B-sides with piano or organ overdubs by Brown, and he had a habit of mixing his part to be twice as loud as the rest of the band. That might be acceptable if he didn't play more clams than a barrel of chowder: the two-part ""Maybe Good, Maybe Bad"" is far too optimistically titled, and he seems to keep forgetting what key ""Here I Go"" is in.  
    </p>
<p>
    As with every volume in the series, though, there are some peculiar, lesser-known wonders here. 1968's trio of Christmas singles (banged out in three days in October) includes a fabulous little jam called ""Santa Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto"", and the Bobby Byrd duet ""Licking Stick - Licking Stick"" points toward the spiky cross-chatter of his 1970 band. Even better is ""You Got to Have a Job"", a January 1969 duet with his companion from the Vietnam trip, soul howler Marva Whitney. The two of them call for saxophonist Maceo Parker to solo-- the same trick Brown had used as far back as ""Cold Sweat"" (mid-1967 was an eternity ago, at the speed his music was evolving). But they keep crowing ""Maceo!"" back and forth at each other, just for the joy of showing off their loud, glorious powers.

    What's really in a name? Sure, a rose by any other would smell as sweet, but what about a lo-fi Philly hardcore/hip-hop band? Will their skuzzy, spazzy tunes get the attention they deserve if their band name becomes an indistinct cluster of letters? Originally named for an amalgamation of defunct punks the Yah Mos and rapper Mos Def, the Yah Mos Def announced its genre-splicing intentions up front with a name that honored both their punk and hip-hop lineage. But they were forced to rethink their handle when their namesake rapper didn't get the joke and petitioned MySpace to remove their page. Now, sadly, their initialed name means about as much as EMF's.</p><p>
    But don't let those bland initials deter you; there is absolutely nothing bland about this debut. Coming on like <em>License to Ill</em>-era Beastie Boys, these vegans from the Philadelphia hardcore scene have built hard-edged, DIY party tracks out of cheap, scratchy beats, old-school boasting, kitschy pop culture references, and nasal, white-boy patter. But what sets Distro and B. Awesome (according to their mothers, Rick Mitchell and Bryan Poerner) apart is the all-encompassing spirit of their punk/rap fusion. Though they rely on the sample-heavy techniques of hip-hop (albeit with much rawer production), their reference points are punk outfits like Franklin and Cap'n Jazz.</p><p>
    The 10-track, 27-minute album wastes no time in announcing its intentions. Kicking off with the barely 15-second ""track"" ""Hiltz Is Hot"", which, named for Philly punk legend/former drummer of Born Against Jon Hiltz, is basically just Born Against's ""Neil"" with one small change. Thanks to a cheap cut'n'paste job, the YMD have inserted their band's name into the infamous line, ""Hello shit. We're Born Against. Now suck my fucking lizard."" Then Distro and B. Awesome immediately careen into ""Charles Maggio's Real Last Name Is Ash"", which takes its title from the Rorschach frontman/Gern Blandsten founder. Introducing their sense of humor, points of view, and B. Awesome's snotty, Ad-Rock-on-helium flow, the track encompasses rhymes about former notorious Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode, Ian Svenonius, Weston, Rakim, and Bel Biv DeVoe (""I'm Michael Bivins/ ABC's how I make a living/ Your skills are starved/ Getting carved like Thanksgiving"").  
    </p>
<p>
    Even though they make a lot of jokes, don't make the mistake of dismissing them as one. Yes, their songs are strewn with blink-and-you'll-miss-'em scene in-jokes and winking braggadocio (""We're flossing MCs like a fucking dentist""), but the YMD isn't MC Lars. In between playing Name That Tune with the samples and recognizing silly shout-outs to the Gordon Gartrelle shirt that Denise made Theo on <em>The Cosby Show</em>, you will be sucked in by the infectious, nerdy joy of these songs. Will those in the know love ""Global Liberation Army"" more because they recognize Ian MacKaye's cheeky introduction to Beefeater's <em>House Burning Down</em>? Sure, but those that don't know Ian MacKaye from Ian McKellen will enjoy the feedback-drenched track, its adrenalized drums and the charmingly amateur quality of its rhymes. And though Bikini Kill fans jonesing for a Kathleen Hanna fix will perk up at the strains of <em>Pussy Whipped</em>'s ""Hamster Baby"" driving ""Bathing My Hamster In Nail Polish Remover"", the rhymes about Paul Weller and Vanilla Silk soy milk set against blaring-alarm guitars and A.D.D.-addled beats will be enough to sustain the interest of any listener, no matter how limited their knowledge of punk history. 
    </p>
    One of the few things that hardcore has always had in common with hip-hop is hometown scene loyalty, and the YMD certainly tout theirs. <em>Excuse Me, This Is the Yah Mos Def</em> is a virtual mash note to the City of Brotherly Love; Philly even gets its own thank-you in the liner notes. ""New Direction"" calls out many local neighborhoods, from Fishtown to Bryn Mawr (or, in the band's own lexicon, ""From East Falls to these balls""), and the city's local music and sports legends are touted throughout. So, much like cheesesteaks, the YMD-- no matter what you call them-- is an addictive, if hard-on-your-heart, delicacy that could be from nowhere else.</div>"|11331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11331-excuse-me-this-is-the-yah-mos-def/|7.5|Rebecca Raber

There was Dylan in the studio, recording the game-changing trio of <em>Bringing It All Back Home</em>, <em>Highway 61 Revisited,</em> and <em>Blonde on Blonde</em>. There was <em>Basement Tapes</em> Dylan. There was Dylan and the Hawks, out on tour. There was Dylan at home in Woodstock, recovering from his motorcycle crash (maybe) while defending his young family from psycho fans prowling for The Truth (definitely). And then, shared by all sets, there was the Dylan enigmatic even to the singer himself. This is the Dylan that, on ""60 Minutes"", cited ""It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"" and declared: ""Try to sit down and write something like that. There's a magic to that, and it's not a Siegfried and Roy kind of magic, you know? It's a different kind of a penetrating magic.""</p><p>
    Tell it to those unfortunate souls that continually set out to channel Bob Dylan, inevitably capturing the sound but rarely the ""penetrating magic."" The same goes for acts out to mimic the Band, let alone Bob Dylan and the Band. But while even Bob Dylan may not know what makes Bob Dylan tick, one suspects fellow upstate New York enigmas (by design) the Felice Brothers have clearly taken copious notes.</p><p>
    Who knows whether or not the Felice Brothers-- brothers Ian, Simone, and James, plus a friend called Christmas-- are actually, consciously trying to come as close as possible to replicating Dylan an/or the Band on their self-titled latest. Regardless, the point is, whether they intended to or not, they've come eerily, awkwardly, creepily close to capturing that familiar mix of mood, mystery, atmosphere, and aesthetic. It's an act of brazen affectation, to be sure, but you've got to half admire the band's balls. Besides, it's not as if Dylan and the sainted Band had clean hands themselves. A Jewish kid from Minnesota posing as a hobo folk poet anti-hero in New York, hooking up with a bunch of Canadians playing Southern sharecropper Civil War reenactors? Hats off all around, guys.
    </p><p>
    Like the fragments and experiments cut by Dylan and the Band that comprise the famed<em> Basement Tapes</em>, many tracks on <em>The Felice Brothers</em> sound like they were written a few minutes before they were recorded, little sketches fleshed out just enough to form proper songs. The likes of ""Ruby Mae"", ""Helen Fry"", and ""Frankie's Gun!""-- like two other tracks on the disc, recycled from the Felice Brothers' earlier <em>Adventures of the Felice Brothers Vol. 1</em>-- are detail-rich and pleasingly loose songs, buoyed by rubbery bass, barrelhouse piano, organ, and nicely ramshackle guitars. If they're not first takes, they may as well be.
    </p>
<p>
    But rootsy authenticity is one thing, and self-consciously retro rootsy authenticity is another. It takes a massive suspension of disbelief to buy into the sloppy sing-alongs of ""Love Me Tenderly"", ""Take This Bread"", and ""Greatest Show on Earth"" (on the latter two tracks, the Band influence grows almost obnoxious with the introduction of horns). The accordion and shuffling drums of ""Radio Song"" are genial enough, but the song doesn't really go anywhere. The boho busker Dylanisms of ""Tip Your Way"" are too annoying to be salt of the earth, while elsewhere anachronistic references (plus loaded lyrical references to ""pillbox hats"" and the like) border a tad on the smug side, tipping a hand best played closer to the vest (just ask Marah).
    </p>
<p>
    And that, in the end, is what hinders such an otherwise harmless exercise. Maybe played with more of a wink, the Felice Brothers could be good knowing fun. Played (apparently) straight, all it does is highlight how much better Dylan and the Band channeled the spirit of (in the words of Greil Marcus) the ""old, weird America,"" not by mimicking what came before but by creating their own alternate well of inspirations from which to draw. Why accept a substitute when you can listen to the real, fake thing?

At 50, Nick     Cave's hairline is receding, but     he's turned that setback into a ""look,"" growing out his locks and cultivating     the coolest mustache in the industry. Over 30 years, first with the Birthday     Party and then with the Bad Seeds, he has refined his lurid growl and     lascivious subject matter-- the usuals: sex, death, God, murder, redemption,     all in the most brutal and salaciously poetical terms possible-- without losing     any of his charisma or menace. During the past decade alone, despite sounding     hoarse on <i>No More Shall We Part </i>and<i> Nocturama</i>, he has transformed his     swagger into a potent brand of musical and amoral authority, honing his persona     in tandem with the Bad Seeds, who a few years ago were one of the tightest and     most versatile backing bands around and have only gotten better with each     release.</p>
<p>Prior to the recording of Cave's latest album, longtime guitarist/piano player Blixa Bargeld left the Bad     Seeds and multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, of the Dirty Three, assumed a     more prominent role. So maybe it's the line-up changes, or even the thrown-down     gauntlet of Cave's side project Grinderman, or perhaps some other unnamed     stimulus, but the Bad Seeds sound even edgier and more sophisticated on <i>Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!</i>, providing a fitting pulpit for their bandleader's ravings. With the emphasis on acoustic     guitars with occasional blasts of electric static, there's little of the     distortion that colored Grinderman's album, but plenty of odd noises and lewd     organs that suggest some sort of twisted take on 1960s psych and garage rock. Cave     and the Seeds kick out the jams, kick in the Doors. ""Today's Lesson"" and ""Lie     Down Here (&amp; Be My Girl)"" are fierce, yet lean, while ballads like     ""Moonland"" and ""Hold On to Yourself"" offset that energy with eerie nocturnal     ambience.</p>
<p>Just as surely as the 2004 double-decker <i>Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus</i> was     Cave's England album-- steeped in imagery that's equal parts urban-miserable     Dickens and pagan-pastoral <i>Wicker Man</i>-- <i>Dig, Lazarus,     Dig!!!</i> is his Americanized follow-up. He has always been interested in the     darker corners of Americana, especially the Southern mythologies that informed     early albums like <i>From Her to Eternity</i> and <i>The Firstborn Is Dead,</i> and Cave makes this collection an old-fashioned     picaresque through exurban shopping malls, shuttered factories, and dilapidated ranches-- complete with Biblical overtones (and what's a Nick Cave album     without those?). The opening title track, with its fierce strut and taunting     floor-tom tattoo, opens on Lazarus newly resurrected, a fame junkie traipsing     westward before ending up ""back in the streets of New     York, in a soup queue, a dope fiend, a slave."" Cave spins     the yarn not as a fire-and-brimstone sermon, but more like a sardonic Sunday     school lesson-- and pretty funny to boot.</p>
<p>Even the writers Cave namedrops are almost exclusively     Americans: Ernest Hemingway, Charles Bukowski, and John Berryman, whom Cave, like     the Hold Steady and Okkervil River,     extols beyond all others. To his considerable credit, Cave may be the only rock     musician who convincingly doubles as a literary critic. Such pretensions are     built into his persona and tempered with his awareness that rock and roll is     ultimately low-brow and therefore a subversive vessel for high-bow concerns. In     other words, he has a lot more to say about <i>Lolita</i> than Sting ever did. As on ""There She Goes, My Beautiful World"" on <i>Abattoir Blues</i>, Cave assails all things     bookish on ""We Call Upon the Author"", a rip-roaring metafictional rocker that     questions not only the need for suffering on Earth, but Cave's own fascination     with it. Mingling lines like ""myxamatoid kids spraddle the streets"" with base     puns like ""I feel like a vacuum cleaner, a complete sucker,"" Cave implies the     author in question might be himself or it might be God, which makes the     song-ending shout all the ballsier: ""Prolix! Prolix! Nothing a pair of scissors     can't fix!""</p>
<p>When Cave isn't editing the Bible, he's moving <i>Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!</i> westward-- the trajectory     of so many American stories-- through the heartland and into the Southwest,     through the hilariously iniquitous ""Today's Lesson"" and into ""Albert Goes     West"", set in the ""vast, indifferent deserts of Arizona.""     As always, it's a strange road trip, with Cave keeping the car between the     lines while Ellis messes with the radio. Their collaboration has intensified     over the fourteen years since the violinist joined the band for <i>Henry's Dream</i>, and Ellis has obviously     called shotgun on <i>Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!</i> His strange noises color every track: the sinister wind-up music box sounds on     ""Today's Lesson"", the gentle flute solo on the surprisingly tender ""Jesus of     the Moon"", the delicate violin wheeze behind ""Night of the Lotus Eaters"". All     of Cave's albums aim to unsettle, but rarely have he and the Bad Seeds managed     to do it so efficiently, so gracefully, or so forcefully. It all culminates in     the haunted closer ""More News from Nowhere"", on which Cave does Homer doing Dylan     to sum up what sounds like his whole career. Ellis fiddles while America     burns, and Cave sings, almost sweetly, ""It's strange in here. Yeah, it gets     stranger every year."" Amen to that.</p></div>"|11375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11375-dig-lazarus-dig/|8.4|Stephen M. Deusner

    More than almost any group out there, Clinic make you question how integral change is to a band's vitality. If you don't own any of their music, buying all their albums and listening to each and every one of their songs in alphabetical order (an undertaking that'd take less than four hours, B-sides included) wouldn't tell you much less about their career's arc than a chronological study would. The formula they hinted at on 1997 debut single ""IPC Subeditors Dictate Our Youth"" and got down to a science on 2000's <em>Internal Wrangler</em> has expanded only slightly, and while there've been some noticeable shifts in production style (especially on 2002's crisp and glossy <em>Walking With Thee</em>), there's not much that sonically separates a decade-old Clinic song from what they're up to today.</p><p>
    But maybe there's just not enough room for any other ideas: Clinic's aesthetic has already incorporated snatches of punk, doo-wop, garage psych, Krautrock, hard bop, mid '70s Miami disco, the film scores of Ennio Morricone, Augustus Pablo-informed dub (complete with melodica), Phil Spector girl-group pop, a few decades' worth of rockabilly, and antediluvian European folk music. It's all contained in an intricate frameworkt hat risks falling apart entirely if it's tweaked too much, and if that means that the same rhythms and melodies and moods keep cropping up in familiar ways, well, at least that sound hasn't gotten any worse. And while it's pretty easy to predict what you'll hear on their new album <em>Do It!</em>, especially if their last couple albums (the water-treading but enjoyable <em>Winchester Cathedral</em> and the slightly weirder, slightly better <em>Visitations</em>) are any indication, it's not the kind of predictability that results in disappointment.</p><p>
    Despite the fact that there's still some old reliable structures underpinning <em>Do It!</em>-- the aforementioned parade of references wrapped around their playbook of big cabaret stomps, swing rhythms, shoegaze drones, and waltz-time R&amp;B-- this new album might be Clinic's most adventurous since <em>Internal Wrangler</em>. Clinic songs are usually recognizable as such within less than 10 seconds, with or without the buzzing wail of lead singer Ade Blackburn, and that's still the case. Usually the giveaway relies on a combination of Carl Turney's organically metronomic drumming-- heavy clomping gallops or delicate cymbal rides, depending on the mood-- and Hartley's guitar, which sounds like nearly nobody else in rock, whether he's coaxing slow strums, sharp twangs or fuzzed-out violence out of his instrument. But they often find themselves in uncharacteristic contexts; there's a couple of surprising moments of acoustic demi-blues, like the freight train rattle of ""Tomorrow"" (think Led Zeppelin's ""Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"" with hints of <em>Internal Wrangler </em>track ""T.K."") and the 3/4 swoon of ""Mary&amp; Eddie"", which eventually explodes into a foghorn-accompanied burst of trapeze-act acid rock. And there are other curveballs: Opener ""Memories"" makes like it's going to be one of their burlesque-rhythm boogie numbers (i.e. ""2<sup>nd</sup> Foot Stomp"" and ""Vertical Takeoff in Egypt""), but dips into a smart little bit of summery Beach Boys organ for the chorus, while ""Free Not Free"" bookends and interrupts an otherwise-tranquil bit of slow-dance reverie with a brief, snarling riff that sounds like some unhinged class-of-66 garage band scoring a bullfight. 
    </p>
    Blackburn, still murmuring half-intelligible lyrics with the same spooky whine, has aced a perplexing syntax that gives these songs a labyrinthine, off-putting sense of psychological unease: ""Knowing the chapters here that you close/ Fill in the gaps as half your mind is gone"" (""Emotions""); ""See yourself outside your skin here/ See yourself outside you for miles"" (""Free Not Free""); ""You stitch who you always wanted/ Now your thoughts begin to fray"" (""High Coin""). And even when they stick to their old blueprint-- ""The Witch (Made to Measure)"", ""Emotions"", and ""Winged Wheel"" sound a bit like 10 other songs they've already done, except better-- Clinic play with a renewed sense of the same eerie raucousness that drew people to them in the first place; this would be an easy second-album recommendation for a new fan after they've initially discovered and absorbed <em>Internal Wrangler</em>. Clinic could still stand to stretch their legs just a bit more-- it's still inexplicable for a band this savvy about groove-minded freakouts that they've never recorded a song longer than four and a half minutes-- but any band that's staved off stagnancy while still sounding more or less like they did a decade in the past shouldn't worry too much about messing with a good thing.</div>"|11335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11335-do-it/|7.7|Nate Patrin

Lagos is considered a 21st century ""megacity"" teetering on the brink of total chaos when it's not already embroiled in it. ""As a picture of the urban future,"" wrote author George Packer, ""Lagos is fascinating only if you're able to leave it.""</p><p>
    Lagos wasn't always like this, nor was Nigeria as a whole. In fact, just about 40 years ago, following the end of the Biafran War, Nigeria briefly experienced a huge economic and cultural boom, its oil revenues generating billions, the nation thriving, and the country producing an impressive number of artists, writers, and musicians. As far as the musicians go, many still only know Nigeria for Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. Some are also familiar with some combination of juju masters King Sunny Adé and Ebenezer Obey, the perfectly nicknamed highlife star Christogonus Ezebuiro ""Sir Warrior"" Obinna of the nebulous Oriental Brothers International Band, but they still represent just the tip of a vast West African iceberg.</p><p>
    Fela's not included on the illuminating 2xCD <em>Nigeria Special: Modern Highlife, Afro-Sounds &amp; Nigerian Blues</em>, but members of his pre-Afrobeat highlife band the Koola Lobitos are, playing in the Don Isaac Ezekiel Combination. Ebenezer Obey's not here, but the man who allegedly taught him how to play, Easy Kabaka Brown, is. ""There are thousands of tracks by popular and not-so-popular bands that are still yet to be issued outside of West Africa,"" writes curator Miles Cleret in the well-researched liner notes.</p><p>
    That diversity, those numbers, and those colorful yet almost unknowable names are part of the challenge in compiling any collection of African music, especially drawing from a region as fruitful as the continent's northwest chunk. It's also no doubt what keeps many from diving in and exploring on their own. But if little on <em>Nigeria Special</em> sticks out for the neophyte or casual fan, all the better: The comp is the perfect place to start if you want to move beyond the better known heavy hitters of Nigerian music.</p><p>
    What makes <em>Nigeria Special</em> doubly useful is that, per its subtitle, it doesn't just rely on funk or dance music. Instead, on Disc One, we get acts like the Funkees, with their soulful, organ-driven ""Akula Owu Onyeara"", or the trancelike, percussion-heavy ""Oja Omoba"" from Dele Ojo &amp; His Star Brothers Band. St. Augustine &amp; His Rovers Dance Band offer the unfailingly peppy ""Onwu Ama Dike"", while ""Feso Jaiye"" from the Sahara All Stars of Jos, is downright mellow in its sax, guitar and electric piano explorations. </p><p>
    The Nigerian Police Force Band plays Afrobeat in a more familiar mold on Disc Two, their ""Asiko Ni Mi"" clearly indebted to Fela. Easy Kabaka Brown's band, Opotopo, plays up the West African-Caribbean connection in ""Belema"". The Hykkers' ""I Want a Break Thru"" is wah-wah infused psychedelic instrumental rock. The (again, perfectly named) Dan Satch &amp; His Atomic 8 Dance Band of Aba contribute the tightly syncopated polyrhythms of ""Alabeke"", featuring a smoking guitar solo. Any one of these tracks may be eye opening on their own. Taken as a whole, the comp itself is as revelatory as it is incessantly enjoyable. Pop history has rarely gone down so painlessly. ""Thousands of tracks"" yet to be issued, claims Cleret? As long as they're this beautifully packaged and presented, bring 'em on.<br/></p></div>"|11255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11255-nigeria-special-modern-highlife-afro-sounds-nigerian-blues/|8.0|Joshua Klein

    The birds and the bees: it's rock's quintessential subject. But is it a post-rock subject? In a way, it turns out. The name Collections of Colonies of Bees may call to mind spreadsheets, microscope slides, caffeinated Poindexters in white frocks, and, of course, the honey-bearing fairies that grace Cheerios boxes and a Rimsky-Korsakov interlude. The suggestions of the scientific and the imaginative fit this Milwaukee quintet to a T. Clearly, these people pay attention to names-- words carry heavy burdens, after all, in the taciturn deserts of post-rock.</p><p>
    So when small winged creatures pop up on their fifth full-length, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Birds</span>, we take note. Given the name ""Flocks"", the record's four movements have a sense not only of flight, but of a group moving gracefully in unison. Formed in 1998, the Bees have spent a decade polishing their act and aesthetic. This is especially obvious in their renowned live sets (recently gushed over in <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/48586-guest-list-bon-iver"">Bon Iver's Guest List</a></strong>), which form the basis of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Birds</span>. These are not straightforward jam sessions. Organic and intricate as their compositions can be, the Bees clearly appreciate the emotional power of simple, thoughtfully tiered rhythms, as the opening movement ""Flocks I"" attests. Sometimes these rhythms are crafted out of crunchy guitar riffs, sometimes they are pieced together out of digital fragments, a technique they perfected on 2004's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Customer</span>. The amalgam falls somewhere between the drawn-out drama of Explosions in the Sky and Eno's furniture music, the concept-art relaxant.</p><p>
    ""Flocks II"" begins as a gorgeous vista snapping in and out of view. Sublimity is drawn with tiny flecks of digital noise, cut-up keyboards, and softly shimmering tides of sound, giving the impression of a misty metropolis, the frenzy of light and noise glimpsed from the top of a skyscraper. The neon-pastoral ambiance is broken by Jon Mueller's majestic kit work. Thankfully, his drumming survives the band's slice-and-dice, collage instinct-- the Bees have learned the if-it-ain't-broke principle. Later in the song, unassuming riffs and keyboard figures enter the scene, cozying up to each other and easing into soothing grooves. Capturing the band's dual loyalty to the computer's possibilities and to rock's apparatus, this movement outshines the first.
    </p>
<p>
    With a similarly tentative intro, ""Flocks III"" tiptoes in the midst of fluttery, manipulated guitars, its air of wind-chime serenity torn up by the percussion: a clockwork kick drum announcing that meditation time is over. The song picks up as the cymbals rattle, more and more violently. Abruptly at the four-minute mark, everything settles down, the silence surrendering to a few lonely plinks, then an equally lonely strum, then a jaunty and jazzily martial snare. Soon a full-blown song emerges, a moonlit wash of cymbals and guitars built on top of the drumbeat. You could say the tension between the dreamy surface and the more robotic, more rational undercurrents, marks the entire album. The interplay also links Birds back to the early avant-folk of their career, as two former members of Pele sought to update bluegrass with technology.
    </p>
<p>
    Airy, slack, the beginning of ""Flocks IV"" gives off a soft-focus, 1970s glow. As it repeats hypnotically, a squiggle of guitar, bent into a funky, Oriental shape, distracts the listener from the less interesting theatrics in the background. Two thirds into the song, as the tempo climbs upward, the Bees offer a welcome (and less literal) change of pace. A sharper-edged, ragged guitar maneuvers into the picture as a Rhodes chimes and floats above and, briefly, an army of bongos quarter noisily underneath. As this Reichian moment slips away into static, the album ends on an uplifting note. Never lapsing into the doom and gloom of their stylistic peers, the Bees have eased into a mature, mesmerizing style that is finally and wholly their own.

    Italy's the Secret are fascinatingly American. They sing in English, the lingua franca of today's globalized metal and hardcore punk. They sound a lot like Converge, America's most vital hardcore punk band. Americans rent metal from Europeans, but they own hardcore punk. As with any subculture, such nuances are obvious to insiders, but obscure to outsiders. ""All that yelling,"" people complain. ""I would like metal except for the vocals."" The trick is to stop hearing words in vocals and start hearing sound in them.</p><p>
    As an instrument, Marco Coslovich's voice isn't much. It really is just yelling. But its caustic timbre perfectly tucks into its distorted surroundings. He yells-- and doesn't-- in all the right places. What he yells isn't important; the liner notes print no lyrics (though the band's MySpace does). Instead, when the booklet opens up, it shrouds itself-- daguerreotype grays, Photoshopped whites, somber black on black. The album sounds like this, too.</p><p>
    The Secret's debut, 2004's <em>Luce</em> (Italian for ""light""), was relatively brighter. Its framework was angular, metallic hardcore punk, but its sophisticated harmonic sense suggested musical training behind its tattoos. <em>Disintoxication</em> drops most color for a hundred shades of black. Born of ""depression, attempted suicides, jail, nervous breakdowns, anti-depressant abuse, and pretty much anything negative you can think about,"" it's leaner, meaner, and more unshaven than <em>Luce</em>. The recording perfectly captures this, sounding like an incendiary rehearsal. It's similar to Kurt Ballou's sizzlingly electric production for Converge. Guitars are gloriously ragged; one can practically hear the rust in the cymbals. Flamethrower vocals, a beautiful smudge of a layout, sound shaped like an old warhead-- who needs language?
    </p>
<p>
    Yet the album precipitates into layers. Rolling drums and bloodstained chords begrime ""Intoxication"". However, it eventually sheds such sackcloth for a naked, keening dirge. Tritones swarm ""Saul"", then disappear into an effluent of tunneling drums and sandpaper screams. ""Inferno"" seizes into a death grip of grim syncopation. The left guitar of ""In Limbo"" claws like fingernails on arms, while the right one spills scarlet sheets-- my bloody valentine, indeed.
    </p>
<p>
    These are but feverish detours, though, en route to a thrilling final four. ""Funeral Monolith"" earns its name with huge, hulking riffs; ""Death to Pigs"" drapes darkly jeweled chords over desperate polka beats. In ""Kill the Dead"", dreamy jangles hover uneasily over a roiling rhythm section. The deliberate accents of ""Umea"" strip the bombast from Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"", tear out its heart, and fill its skeleton with gravel and despond. A whining melody snakes through the gaping hole in its chest. Coslovich's howl could skin knees; his words are completely unintelligible yet horrifyingly comprehensible.

    In the latter half of the 1990s, as the grunge and riot-grrrl movements of the Pacific Northwest petered out, a young record store clerk in Anacortes quietly dreamed up a world that was entirely his own. Working in private, with analog tape, Phil Elvrum remade the twee-pop of Olympia, Washington's K Records into something broader in scope, proving that intimacy and opulence were not mutually exclusive by forging sweet tunes, childlike vocals, solar noise, and enigmatic tape collages into one molten mass. His speciality was reconciling extreme orders of magnitude, casting mountains and planets and stars as items hanging from a baby's mobile. <em>The Glow Pt. 2</em>, which remains his crowning achievement, is being reissued by K just as Elvrum says ""it threatened to go out of print."" Seven years of imitation have done nothing to dull its impact-- it sounds as unaccountably grand now as it did in 2001.</p><p>
<em>The Glow Pt. 2 </em>wasn't conceptualized, then recorded; Elvrum figured out where it was going even as he committed it to tape. He strived to document the esoteric flights of his imagination, and produced appropriately intuitive music: Vocal harmonies blur, disappear, return as ragged organs. Creaky percussion sounds like it might give way at any moment, and sometimes does. Staticky thumps that could level forests give way to calm acoustic expanses. The bum notes peppering the acoustic riff of ""Headless Horseman"" are reminders that Elvrum was lunging impulsively from one idea to the next. In this, it's a perfect mirror of Xiu Xiu: While Jamie Stewart's music fumbles in pitch darkness, Elvrum's gropes through blinding light.</p><p>
    That easy but deliberate rhythm, along with Elvrum's mossy production, makes <em>The Glow Pt. 2 </em>feel uncommonly organic. Many of his songs move with the naturalistic but formalized cadence of an iambic meter. ""I Want Wind to Blow"" is cut by a heartbeat, plunked out on an acoustic guitar's low E string. The hardier pulse of ""The Gleam Pt. 2"" turns pitch-shifted guitars into a stately march. These could have been average indie pop tunes were they not shaped by Elvrum's unique sense of non-linear arrangement and space: He often gives us a few moments to acclimate ourselves to the Dub Narcotic studio's seething room tone before, with a sudden flourish, flooding it with energy, as he does on ""Map"" and ""My Roots are Strong and Deep"". Therefore, everything he records sounds huge and hollowed out, a little bigger on the inside than on the outside. Death Cab for Cutie would have written the frilly arpeggios of ""You'll Be in the Air"" and stopped there, but Microphones fans wait on tenterhooks for the moment when it inevitably shudders and begins to pile up on itself. 
    </p>
<p>
    Bonus discs are typically the province of demos and remixes. Because of <em>The Glow Pt. 2</em>'s piecemeal construction, Elvrum has none of the former-- everything was taped over or went on the album. As something of an artistic hermit, he's constitutionally inclined against the latter. But, wanting to give fans something in addition to the existing songs, Elvrum spent some time in 2007 recording bonus material for the reissue. These additions range from the obvious (like the acoustic version of ""I Felt My Size"") to the arcane (like a vaguely dub-influenced version of ""I Want Wind to Blow""). There are also essential sketches of new material such as ""I'm Like You, Tree"", which expand the album's already-deep relationship to nature. Of course, none of the new lyrics clarify the overarching story; they're further snapshots of Elvrum feeling small and serene in a big, scary universe. But these snippets are thrilling for Microphones fans-- they reveal a few more glimpses of a distant, haunting world that's all the more alluring for its incompleteness.

    Next to Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson is arguably the most
    anthologized artist in country music history. Even before 1975, when <em>The Red Headed Stranger</em> made icons of his
    braids and beard, Nelson had already toiled as a songwriter and performer for more than 20 years, long enough to release his first greatest hits compilation just a
    few years before his greatest hit. In the 30-plus years since that
    benchmark album, Nelson has interspersed his prolific new recordings (often two
    full albums a year) with a steady stream of hits repackagings. Most of his recent
    albums have consisted of new recordings of old material, which reinforces the
    impression of an artist constantly taking stock of his career, his life, and
    his legacy.</p><p>
    It seems strange that with so many compilations on the
    market, so few of them even attempt to take in the full half-century breadth of
    Nelson's career. Granted, capturing such a wide-ranging, musically omnivorous
    artist in a limited space is always a daunting task, especially when
    affordability is a concern. In 1995, Willie released the 3xCD <em>Revolutions of Time: The Journey 1975-1993</em>,
    whose subtitle is revealing: Far from comprehensive, the set ignores his pre-<em>Stranger</em> output, including early hits
    like ""Shotgun Willie"", ""Crazy"", and ""Bloody Mary Morning"", in order to document
    his post-fame highlights. Two more recent retrospectives, the 41-track <em>Essential Willie Nelson</em> in 2003 and the
    20-track <em>Songs</em> in 2005, take a wider
    view of Nelson's canon, but are necessarily hampered by their cursory
    tracklists.</p><p>
    In Nelson's case, quantity ensures quality, which means that
    <em>One Hell of a Ride</em> is so far the best
    Willie retrospective by simple virtue of its size. Across 100 tracks on four
    CDs, the handsomely packaged set, which commemorates Nelson's 75th birthday,
    traces his career from his first known recording in 1954 to one of his most
    recent tracks in 2007. That they're both the same composition-- ""When I've Sang My
    Last Hillbilly Song""-- provides a nice symmetry, bookending all the hillbilly
    songs that came in between.
    </p>
<p>
<em>One Hell of a Ride</em>
    culls a full disc from Nelson's work in the 1950s, 60s, and early 70s,
    representing early albums like <em>...And
    Then I Wrote </em>and<em> Texas in My Soul</em>,
    which are sadly out of print, as well as slightly more popular releases like <em>Shotgun Willie</em> and <em>Phases &amp; Stages</em> (reissued in 2006 as <em>The Complete Atlantic Sessions</em>). After Willie released <em>Stranger</em>, the various labels he had
    recorded for began cleaning out the vaults, repackaging his older hits and
    selling them to new fans, and this set draws liberally from some of these
    reissues: three tracks from <em>Willie--
    Before His Time,</em> a 1977 release of tracks from the previous decade (remixed
    by Waylon Jennings); one each from 1980's <em>Minstrel
    Man</em> and 1984's <em>Don't You Ever Get
    Tired</em>; and two from his <em>All Time
    Greatest Hits Vol. 1</em>. By comparison, <em>Stranger</em>
    itself gets only one track, <em>Stardust</em>
    two. 
    </p>
<p>
    This is significant. Nelson lives and dies by the song,
    whether he wrote it himself or is just covering it. With compositions like
    ""Crazy"", ""Sad Songs and Waltzes"", ""Bloody Mary Morning"", ""Too Sick to Pray"",
    and many others, <em>One Hell of a Ride</em>
    showcases Nelson's unparalleled songwriting skills, but with covers of
    compositions by Jimmy Cliff, Hoagy Carmichael, Bob Wills, Paul Simon, Fred
    Neil, and the Muppets, the set highlights his intuitive interpretive skills. Despite
    the decades in between, the leathery texture of his voice is immediately
    recognizable on the first disc as it is on the final disc, as idiosyncratic as
    Cash's grave baritone or Elvis Presley's full-bodied croon, and his behind-the-beat
    cadence, which draws from jazz and gospel as heavily as from country, makes
    every performance singular.
    </p>
<p>
    In tandem with taking stock of his well-known hits like ""Whiskey
    River"", ""Night Life"", and ""Blue
    Eyes Crying in the Rain"", <em>One Hell of a
    Ride</em> pays particular attention to Nelson's many collaborations, the number
    of which suggests he might have been contractually obligated to sing with
    anyone who stepped within the Nashville
    city limits. The second disc kicks off with the first of five duets with Waylon
    Jennings, ""Good Hearted Woman"", from <em>Wanted!
    The Outlaws</em>, which not only helped popularize outlaw country but was for
    many years the best-selling country album ever. But the collaborators on <em>One Hell of a Ride</em> are admirably
    diverse: old timers like the Highwaymen (Cash, Jennings, and Kris
    Kristofferson) and Rays Price and Charles rub elbows with Lee Ann Womack, Leon
    Russell, Daniel Lanois, and even Julio Iglesias, on the gloriously cheesy ""To
    All the Girls I've Loved Before"". This emphasis on his friends means the third and
    fourth discs nearly lose Willie in the crowd, but it barely matters. <em>One Hell of a Ride</em> is perhaps the first
    Willie retrospective to portray him not simply as the famous long-haired
    singer-songwriter who penned hits and dodged the IRS, but as something more
    complex: an American artist who spent decades struggling in the country music
    industry, then spent decades redefining it.

    enthusiasts, anyhow) as what the Velvets would sound like if they ""had ever been deported to an island of 6 million sheep."" Pete and the Pirates, 
    then, are the Clean if Kilgour &amp; co. forsook their homeland's livestock-freckled 
    landscape for a thickly populated post-industrial UK burgh. ""Ill Love"", lead-off track 
    on the Reading band's inaugural LP <em>Little Death</em> could, with 
    its babbling bass, rattling guitar, and infectious-as-ringworm melody 
    be Dunedin, 1981, all over again.</p><p>
    Any Kiwi bloodlines, however, 
    are diverted through the now-hegemonic channels of 1990s American indie 
    rock. So as much as the album sounds like a lost tape from the <em>Boodle 
    Boodle Boodle</em> sessions, that's probably only because it rings 
    with scrappy, melodic Pavementisms, amber-toned Yo La Tengo chords, and 
    the genial chug of Superchunk's brake-free singles. ""Come on Feet"", one of 
    the year's most potent earworms dangles a 
    couple shallow hooks before plowing into a tent revival of maniacal 
    handclapping and late-night, lager-sotted <em>ooh-oohs</em>. Singer/guitarist 
    Tom Sanders previously recorded ""Feet"" (as well as ""She Doesn't 
    Belong to Me"", née ""She Doesn't Belong"") for his Tap Tap solo project, but the full-band 
    version of the song, which now also includes vocals from second guitarist 
    Pete Hefferan (one of two Petes in the Pirates) exercises the song's 
    full anthemic potential. ""Knots"" is a two-and-change blast of chipped 
    guitar and oscillating rhythm. Even tracks that start woozy like ""Eyes Like Tar"" 
    are pebbles on an incline; once kicked they can't seem to defy the 
    laws of physics.</p><p>
    Producer Gareth Parton (the 
    Go! Team, Foals) wisely handles <em>Little 
    Death </em>with a light touch, engineering some fantastic vocal interplay 
    (like less dramaturgical versions of the Futureheads), and otherwise 
    leaving things the hell alone. The Pirates aren't up to anything fancy lyrically, 
    either. They ply several clever turns of phrase, even passages of rueful 
    wit (""You and me trying hard to remember/ How we ever started out with 
    our sights so high""), but most songs couch romantic travail and workaday 
    worry in familiar pop music terms. There are endless references to 
    bed-- knocking boots, passing out, and just plain sleeping. But unlike 
    that of their laddish contemporaries, the Pirates' version of debauchery 
    is mostly milquetoast, the Saturday night escapades of guys who don 
    collared shirts and brave the M4 each weekday to get to their entry-level 
    insurance jobs. In other words, a welcome respite for anyone weary of the tabloid exploits of that other Pete, Doherty (which is <em>everyone</em>, 
    right?).
    </p><p>
    Even if you'd be loathe to 
    admit it to your friends, ""Dry Wings"", with lines like, ""Time 
    for bed/ Find a girl and go to bed/ Close your eyes/ Stars are falling 
    from the sky,""  is mighty affecting-- a winking galaxy of jangled wist, 
    sweet, staggered harmonies and a gawky, yearning sense of wonder. And beneath 
    the crusty shell of apathy and cynicism and the buzz and fuzz and hiss isn't that, fundamentally, what the best indie rock is always trying 
    to communicate?

After the initial stumble of 1994's <span id=""n7jz"" style=""font-style: italic"">Lunar Strain</span>, the Gothenburg-based quintet released <span id=""bjn6"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Jester Race</span>, <span id=""zaf8"" style=""font-style: italic"">Whoracle</span><span id=""h8u1"" style=""font-style: italic"">, </span><span id=""h8u1"">and </span><span id=""h8u1"" style=""font-style: italic"">Colony</span><span id=""zaf8"" style=""font-style: italic""></span>. 
    This trilogy is widely considered In Flames' ""classic"" period.  In
    contrast to the rough-hewn death metal of the early 90s, the Swedish
    melodic variant sped up Iron Maiden and replaced singing with
    growling.  The result was aggressive yet accessible.  Peers like Dark
    Tranquillity and At the Gates helped propagate the Gothenburg sound, but In Flames were arguably its bellwether by being
    its least idiosyncratic.  Though limited to standard minor tonalities,
    their riffs and harmonies were exuberant and sometimes epic.  Imitators
    quickly arose; the guitar harmonies of today's metalcore and emo owe
    much to In Flames.</p><p>
    On 2000's <span id=""s-g_"" style=""font-style: italic"">Clayman</span>, the band began to tinker with its formula.  Riffs contained more space, and clean tones occasionally leavened the heaviness.  <span id=""i1-s"" style=""font-style: italic"">Clayman</span> was the transition to In Flames' current sound, which began with the aptly named <span id=""p2v-"" style=""font-style: italic"">Reroute to Remain</span>. 
    Industrial/electronic touches popped up, as did male and female
    singing.  A slight rock feel began to alloy the previous metallic
    precision.  For metal, such changes were experimental, but they yielded a more mainstream sound (one later-era <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3I3i0R_IL4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a></strong>
    featured a most un-metallic wet t-shirt car wash).  Accordingly, In
    Flames' appeal broadened and now they shift six figures per record.</p><p>
<span id=""t9lh"" style=""font-style: italic"">A Sense of Purpose</span>
    continues along this path, and is neither the triumph nor disaster
    it has been held up to be.  Its one experiment is an eight-minute
    attempt at Radiohead that feels much longer.  Otherwise, the band
    revisits its latter-day ideas: hooky riffs, mid-paced tempos, and a
    tug-of-war between rock's immediacy and metal's ambition.  ""The
    Mirror's Truth"" and ""Delight and Angers"" are basically the same song,
    toggling between simplistic riffs and baroque harmonies.  ""Move Through
    Me"" is a dead ringer for Soilwork, a Swedish colleague whose
    artistic trajectory has mirrored In Flames'.  Anders Fridén is still
    screaming about nothing, though his disclosure that ""I feel like shit/
    But at least I feel something"" is clumsily poignant.  The plodding
    ""Alias"" is catchy through perseverance, ramming home its melody until
    the listener capitulates.</p><p>
    Yet grace
    abounds. Eighteen years into their career, In Flames wield a subtle
    instrumental fluency, almost in spite of their songs.  Adherents like
    Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage merely run through thirds-based
    harmonies, but In Flames dissect and upend them.  The guitar break in
    ""The Mirror's Truth"" flowers into luscious blues bends and darting
    neoclassical runs.  The fluid solo in ""Move Through Me"" recalls Marty
    Friedman's succulent licks in Megadeth.  ""I'm the Highway"" has soaring
    harmonies that evoke In Flames' classic records.  The bridge in ""Alias""
    is also old hat, but it's some of the tastiest acoustic work in metal
    since Metallica's glory days.  Unlike that band's wild stylistic leaps,
    In Flames have steadily continued to advance the ball.  They may not
    gain much yardage sometimes, but they're still in possession.<br/></p></div>"|11357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11357-a-sense-of-purpose/|7.0|Cosmo Lee

    Here Tom Cruise has been replaced by new wave-singer/possible-alien<strong><em> </em></strong>Klaus
    Nomi. The film is run at half speed. Pink snow falls on a gray meadow while
    Nomi strikes the pose of an anguished clown. Unicorns weep. This just about sums up the mood that dominates <em>Love Is Real</em>, the second
    record by Ariel Pink associate John Maus. Here the tragic collides with the
    ridiculous in the most garish way possible, and it's never quite clear whether
    you're supposed to laugh or cry. It's as if a gang of drag queens walked into
    the sessions for Joy Division's <em>Closer</em> and exploded.</p><p>
<em>Love Is Real </em>finds Maus putting synth-pop through the
    washing machine until all of its vibrant sounds have turned to colorless
    reverb-drenched mush. On ""Heaven is Real"" the Austin, Minnesota-based
    musician projects sticky melodrama through new-age keyboards and half-hearted
    drum machines. ""You don't have to run anymore,"" chants Maus in a
    warbling baritone that sounds positively cadaverous.
    Similarly, ""Do Your Best"" brings the pulse down to a crawl
    as Maus slow-motion croons ""Reach out to the one you love/ In the city
    tonight/ You've got to get it right/ In the city tonight"" through a bed of
    shimmering synthesizers. It's gaudy, glittery, and cold-- simultaneously a parody
    of overwrought balladry and the loneliest, most desolate song ever. These are <em>Love Is Real</em>'s finest songs and they're really, really creepy.</p><p>
    But if you can't get into Maus' whole
    lo-fi-spiritual-anguish-as-brought-to-you-by-Falco thing, there's not much else
    here to pick over. For every thrillingly creepy 80s dirge that the record has
    to offer, there's at least two tracks of boneheaded filler. ""Too Much Money"" and
    ""Don't Worship the Devil"" are thin and skipable gags. The less said about
    ""Rights for Gays""-- a faux-disco prank where Maus sings the lyrics ""Tie them to a
    fence post/ Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow/ Rights for gays and medical care for every
    one!""-- the better.
    It's hard to make an album that's truly creepy these days.
    You can only get so far detuning your guitar and cribbing your lyrics from the
    back pages of <em>Fangoria</em>-- that path has been worn bare. But through a surprising combination of nostalgia and clumsiness Maus has stumbled into an eerie and claustrophobic realm that most full-on rock bands can't access anymore. As <em>Love Is Real</em>'s
    Catholic Mass-inspired elegy ""Tenebrae"" escalates towards an ostentatious climax of <em>Clockwork
    Orange</em>-style keyboard fanfare Maus begins to chant the words ""Sing to the
    mystery of his blood"" and it's obvious that-- even if it is diluted by trifling
    filler-- <em>Love as Real </em>has succeeded in finding a softer, gentler way of guiding
    you to a gothy place.</p></div>"|11283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11283-love-is-real/|6.4|Aaron Leitko

    Moby's controversial strategy of licensing the hell out of 1999's <em>Play</em> proved, not surprisingly, something of a devil's bargain. After years of hard work on the club scene and as a cult crossover star, <em>Play</em> was the big payoff and big payday all wrapped up in one. But the downside was that Moby's sudden ubiquity, and the seeming effortlessness with which <em>Play</em> proliferated, downgraded the Moby brand. The guy actually accomplished quite a bit creatively before he became a commercial force, but making it look easy made a lot of detractors think it actually <em>was</em>.</p><p>
    Still, at the same time, there may be something to that in light of Moby's post-<em>Play</em> output. Given that Moby has total autonomy, both creatively and financially, it's disappointing that the past several years have seen him do little in the studio to take advantage of freedoms many artists would kill for-- all while dozens of boundary-pushing DJs and producers circulate in and out of fashion. Maybe Moby sensed it himself, and, rejecting complacency, set himself some ambitious goals with <em>Last Night</em>, a concept album that serves as a nostalgic trip down clubland lane. This being Moby, it even comes with an explicit statement of purpose. ""It's me trying to take 25 years of going out in NYC and condensing it into a 65-minute record. It's also trying to condense an eight-hour night into just over an hour of music.""</p><p>
    Distilling 25 years of material and an eight-hour experience into a 60-minute record is no small feat, and to Moby's credit <em>Last Night</em> isn't a totally pedantic drag. Moby's never been shy about tipping his hand when it comes to his influences, and returning to dance music for inspiration makes perfect sense at this point in his career-- especially after the relatively uninspired <em>Hotel</em> and <em>Baby Monkey</em> (recorded as <em>Voodoo Child</em>, his last stab at a ""straight"" dance record). But there's ""inspired"" and then there's inspired. Compared to (for example) Hercules &amp; Love Affair's own recent stroll through New York's varied club history, the relatively indifferent grooves on <em>Last Night</em> don't quite cut it. These may be songs designed to make you move but the results are only intermittently rousing.</p><p>
    ""Ooh Yeah"" and ""I Love to Move in Here"" (featuring the Cold Crush Brothers' Grandmaster Caz) start the album out with cool (as in cold) disco diva vocals and hip-house, respectively. Retro cred established, the disc then moves into peppier territory with ""257.zero"". The track doesn't really go anywhere, but it still feels like it could go on longer than three and a half minutes. ""Everyday It's 1989"", on the other hand, so perfectly encapsulates the spirit of rave that it might as well be drawn from a comp circa that titular year. If Moby wanted to distill that hour further down to just a single track, it would be this one.</p><p>
    The track's also a reminder of Moby's prowess as a producer, but unfortunately too much of <em>Last Night</em> stresses his recent bona fides as master of the middle of the road. The hip-hop spiced single ""Alice"" (featuring members of Nigeria's 419 Squad) rides a moody subterranean bass but ends pretty much where it begins. ""Hyenas"" is all swoon and no drama. ""Disco Lies"" and ""Stars"" (anthems, both) are more perfect late-80s/early-90s club recreations that nonetheless miss an opportunity to mix (or at least bridge) the past with the present. Somewhere in the middle are tracks like ""Live for Tomorrow"" and ""I'm in Love"", sexy, moody things that are equal parts bedroom lures and hints at the beckoning chill-out room.
    </p>
<p>
    That chill-out atmosphere kicks in for the album's final stretch, gloomy tracks such as the woozy trip-hop of ""Degenerates"" or the circular, minor key dirge ""Mothers of the Night"" that act as the big comedown after the implied narrative's night on the town. By dedicating such a big hunk of the album to the early morning, however, the lasting vibe conveyed by the record is not euphoric or even nostalgic, but oddly elegiac. In the end, lost amidst the faithfully reproduced house piano progressions and familiar melodies is anything signaling that those epiphany-filled late nights were actually, you know, fun. If Moby's glory days were anything like this, <em>Last Night</em> never quite makes an entirely convincing argument why anyone would ever want to go back.

    I've always liked Apples in Stereo as an idea and as a band, an affection that stems from their status as one of the flagship bands of the 90s' Elephant Six collective and doesn't wane even when they release something of which I'm not entirely fond. In a decade full of sad sacks showcasing their pain, the Apples were a little ray through the gray, a band that actually sounded happy to be playing music. What a concept.</p><p>
<em>
    Electronic Projects for Musicians</em> isn't the kind of disc that's going to make the band new fans-- quite to the contrary, it's aimed at fans, offering 14 tracks and 32 minutes of rarities going all the way back to 1995. It scoops up a decade's worth of compilation tracks, Japan-only bonus songs, and other ephemera, including the band's 2006 ode to Stephen Colbert, ""Stephen Stephen"", recorded for the extravagant rock-a-thon episode of ""The Colbert Report"" that resulted from the show's feud with the Decemberists over a similar video concept.</p><p>
    One inclusion I was particularly pleased to hear is ""The Apples Theme Song"", which played on the band's splash page a few years ago. The lyrics ""We are the Apples in Stereo/ You hear our music on the radio,"" are a bit of a fantasy (you're actually more likely to hear them on the Cartoon Network, soundtracking ""The Powerpuff Girls""), but Robert Schneider, the band's everyman leader with the helium-injected voice, doesn't seem to mind. In his mind, he might as well be on the radio, and as long as you're listening to the Apples in Stereo, they may as well be your favorite band.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite the range of years covered here, the fidelity is pretty uniform, and the band's essentially optimistic, sunny disposition holds true across ballads and pop songs alike. Little hints of Schneider's experimentalism crop up here and there as well. UK B-side ""So Far Away"" has electronic beats and a coating of processed guitar, while ""Shine (In Your Mind)"" spikes its slide-guitar-laden pop with strange electric keyboard phrases that add just a touch of clang to the song. And it's not all sunshine, either: ""The Oasis"" sounds like a descendant of ""Across the Universe"", but the lyrics are unusually dark: ""You're such a star/ But don't let it feed your head/ Because the music scene is dead/ Now where you are.""
    </p>
<p>
    There are a number of somewhat bland mid-tempo tracks and a few sketchy incidental things, like the ultra-brief vocal exercise ""Thank You Very Much"", but this is a worthy addition for Apples fans who haven't already tracked down every flexi-disc, Japanese import, and vinyl edition in the band's large catalog. One of the best tracks is saved for last. <em>Tone Soul Evolution</em> outtake ""Dreams"" is a truly pretty song with some nice lead guitar and a bed of mellotron that would have nicely closed the album it was cut from. 
    </p>
<p>
    This is a great companion to the 1996 loose-ends compilation <em>Science Faire</em>, but if you're not into the band, it's no place to start. The band's debut, <em>Fun Trick Noisemaker</em>, 1999's <em>Her Wallpaper Reverie</em>, and last year's comeback <em>New Magnetic Wonder</em> are all better introductions to a band that these days is often curiously overlooked. Schneider's band never became as notorious as its E6 cohorts Olivia Tremor Control and Neutral Milk Hotel, but he had a huge hand in the sound of both groups (producing <em>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</em>), and today must be considered one of indie rock's unsung heroes.

Perhaps the law of inverse aggression governs the Chicago band's claims to Fleetwood Mac-style breakups, and to engage in serious ball-breaking everywhere else. A Forkcast track review compared them to an Elephant Six band, but they lack most E6 bands' abstraction and eccentricity. Closer, vocally and ideologically, maybe, are Belle and Sebastien and Sufjan Stevens (violinist <span class=""hover_target"">Andra Kulans</span> has played backup for Stevens), artists known more for great arrangements and delicate lyricism than a visceral pull.</p><p>
    This is elegant pop, 1960s radio pop, yes, but 1900s should also cop to some less cool influences:  Carole King (""When I Say Go""), or ""Danny's Song""-era Kenny Loggins (""City Water"") lurk on <em>Cold &amp; Kin</em>d alongside the Mamas and Papas-style harmonies. But the overriding theme here, despite their debt to pop tearjerkers, is an emotional distance that invades each track. The album title hints at a familiar personality type that, I'm guessing, describes either someone you know or something you recognize in yourself. It's the romantic partner that handles every step of a relationship, from first crush to fight to breakup to infidelity, with a frustrating calm. ""I can't tell you I love you until I see you crying,"" sings 1900s vocalist/guitarist <span class=""hover_target"">Edward Anderson</span>. And later: ""Everyone goes crazy except for me."" The arrangements warm up words like these, whether it's the clean and muted violin on""Georgia"" or the strings on ""Cold &amp; Kind"" or ""Two Ways""' lead guitar sent through a tube amp.</p><p>
    Every song is arrangled perfectly. But sometimes what I long for, and don't get here, are longer instrumental passages, the breaths that reflect the emotional space and quiet for which the album's protagonist longs. Perfection, like a distant boyfriend's impassivity, is a perverse, grotesque quality masquerading as something admirable. You might find yourself wanting to kick this sandcastle in by the 10th song, except the last two are totally worth saving.</p></div>"|11340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11340-cold-kind/|7.9|Jessica Suarez

    Within the span of a few short years, James Blackshaw has established himself as the gold standard among the crowded field of contemporary acoustic guitarists. On 2007's brilliant <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em> and throughout the course of his ever-expanding discography, he has drawn on an unusually broad array of influences, even by the voracious standards of his American primitive peers. So it comes as little surprise to find that on <em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em>, a new collection curated by Blackshaw for Important Records, he has sought to draw connections across some unlikely musical borderlands.</p><p>
    For the compilation, Blackshaw has gathered solo works for various acoustic string instruments, including performances by cellist Helena Espvall, Japanese koto expert Chieko Mori, and Renaissance lute player Jozef van Wissem. These musicians each bring a highly individualized approach to their instruments, yet each displays a similar balance of reverence and disregard for traditional form and technique. Despite the musicians' diverse musical and cultural backgrounds, however, the collection is able to accent the many subtle echoes between each of these pieces, resulting in an engaging set that provides a refreshing alternative to the recent deluge of folk-based guitar records. <em></em></p><p>
<em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em> takes its title from the celebrated short story by Jorge Luis Borges, which is a dazzling meditation on time and the possibility of infinite simultaneous realities. It's a title that seems to suit this collection especially well, as the music here sounds unified enough to suggest that the performers have all been traveling parallel routes to reach the same destination. (And they each certainly appear capable of Borgesian bursts of virtuosity.) The album was recorded at various locations around the globe in 2006 and 2007 with a minimum of overdubs. Yet these are not wild flights of improvisation but are instead measured, deliberate compositions that progress to their natural conclusions with a quiet sense of purpose. 
    </p>
<p>
    It is left unclear whether the musicians had the opportunity to work together or hear one another's contributions prior to recording their own, but nevertheless the album's casual symmetry is impressive. Jozef van Wissem's lengthy ""The Mirror of Eternal Light"", in particular, seems to breeze across musical boundaries with an effortless fluency. As the piece opens, van Wissem patiently repeats a hypnotic, minimalist figure that sounds remarkably koto-like, before moving into a rippling torrent of notes that could have easily come from Blackshaw's own 12-string. Blackshaw himself submits ""The Broken Hourglass"" which, like all of his best work, sounds immediately accessible and yet somehow strangely alien, as his intricate playing grows further removed from standard blues and raga formula.
    </p>
<p>
    It is Swedish-born cellist Espvall, best known for her work with acid-folk group Espers, who delivers the collection's most surprising and dissonant work. Her solo piece ""Home of Shadows and Whirlwinds"" is filled with darting overtones and ominous, scraping drones to provide a dark reflection to Blackshaw's more sun-sparkled illuminations. The album is framed by Chieko Mori's two koto pieces that draw as much on Western tradition as Eastern, especially on the resonant ""Spiral Wave"", whose layered harmonies and rhythms achieve their own singular, almost rock-like propulsion. In the time since this collection's completion, Blackshaw and van Wissem have resumed their collaboration under the name Brethren of the Free Spirit. And judging from the brilliant <em>The Garden of Forking Paths,</em> we can only hope this is just the opening statement in what will prove to be a fertile, ongoing joint dialogue. <br/>

    Baton Rouge's Trill Entertainment clearly has their heroes-- UGK, Trick Daddy, Scarface-- but more important than that, they've got models: business models. In an age where a respected Def Jam lieutenant (that'd be Freeway) can barely lift a glossy, sturdy soul-rap album past 100,000 units, Trill's Standard Oil/Cash Money/Apple vertical integration has let Lil' Boosie, Webbie, and the label's comparatively forgettable posse albums routinely flirt with gold plaques. They keep their shows rowdy, packed, and staged in B-list cities and backwater towns no one at Clear Channel could find with a GPS. They keep their producers in-house and overworked. They could give a collective fuck when it comes to courting HOT 97 and MTV. Sound familiar?</p><p>
    Call it Cash Money-lite. Producers Mouse and BJ understudy Mannie Fresh with Delta bass-bounce and zydeco flourishes. Lil' Boosie, though he's been rapping for as long as anyone in Cash Money, still scans like a mid-shelf Lil Wayne: a temperamental, ecstatic, vowel-chain loving whelp. Executive producers Turk &amp; Mel are as invisible as Baby's silent partner and brother, Cash Money co-owner Slim Williams.</p><p>
    Webbie's role is a bit harder to cast. Since his first appearances for Trill he's been paired with Boosie. Their duo album, 2005's <em>Gangsta Muzik</em>, collaborations across Webbie's debut <em>Savage Life</em> and Boosie's <em>Bad Azz</em>, and their obvious leadership roles on Trill's label album <em>Survival of The Fittest</em> pegged him as the Juvenile to Boosie's Wayne. Webbie plods where Boosie yelps; he extends his drawl where Boosie snips his lines into chain-link patterns; he wrestles with adulthood while Boosie plays Peter Pan.
    </p>
<p>
    Fitting for an album that documents a perhaps unwilling crawl to maturity, <em>Savage Life 2</em> succeeds when it sticks to the specific, discrete, and (relatively) adult. Webbie certainly sounds like he's done some growing up since his debut. It shows on ""Independent"", the album's lead single and one of the year's most refreshing jams. Webbie dishes out acclaim for his vision of full-fledged women-- ""She ain't waitin' for no man to take care of her/ She'd rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule""-- on a barking, two-tone bubble beat. He provides the steady drawl, newcomer Lil' Phat bricks a few lines (""She cook/ She clean/ She smell like onion ring""-- whatever works, brah) and Boosie steals away the final verse in a whorl of giddy shrieks. Nothing revelatory, nothing too illuminating, just lovely, reasonable olive branches served for a post-Imus rap world.
    </p>
<p>
    Webbie finally has a wheelhouse. Like Trick Daddy he tells you not only what he has, but why, honestly, he values it. ""Your shit is the cheapest, you might blow out your speakers/ Sound we blowin' and all, got warrants and all, done look down at the phone, I done missed a few calls/ Me and Boosie was thuggin', he was telling me something but I couldn't much hear."" Sound systems are just that, but at least he's at least made his material concerns immersive and earnest. Webbie, like it or not, evolves. Better still, Webbie has earned a sense of monologue. ""Just Like Me"" is a caustic, direct speech by a father to his son, peppered with asides (""Hell yeah I'm a good dad/ But I don't know if that's good or bad"") and doubt: ""You gonna end up dead/ You gonna be just like me/ They gonna bust your head/ You gonna be just like me."" And paternal concern: ""All I can say is be safe.""
    </p>
<p>
    But there's no hiding how much of a drop off the second-half of <em>Savage Life 2</em> from the first. Webbie regresses and slides into the sloppy themes of self, self, and fantastic self. He's ""Too big to forget/ Too slippery to hold."" He's makin' money, you aren't. He's gonna hit it on the first night; you, of course, are not. Adulthood has its moments of regression; Webbie stumbles on more than a few on <em>Savage Life 2</em>, but at least there's a sense of forward momentum. When the whole rap world seems to be playing Chicken Little, at least there's a corner of this art that's climbing the ladder to maturity, undisturbed by the commercial world knocking on its door.

Then, when not enough people paid actual money for the thing, he bitchily blogged about it. Now he's doing it again, this time under his own name. If you want the new NIN all-instrumental 36-track drone-marathon, you can pay as little as $5 or as much as $300. (Or, rather, you <em>could</em> have once paid as much as $300; the 2,500-copy limited run of the deluxe-packaging version of <em>Ghosts I-IV</em> sold out within three days.) That Radiohead model, it turns out, only works if you're a band on Radiohead's  or Nine Inch Nails' level-- one with an arena-rock history and a rabid internet fanbase. Reznor stands to make millions from <em>Ghosts</em>, something that certainly wouldn't have been true if he'd released this two-hour 4xCD instrumental work on a major label. Reznor's defection from the music business might be the best thing that ever happened to him financially and ideologically. Aesthetically, it might be the worst.</p><p>
    Reznor's greatest strength has always been his ability to let his fundamental pop sensibility show through his fuzzed-out industrial signifiers and screaming-at-a-wall tantrum-rock pretensions. For all its heavily processed walls of guitar and reptilian electro lurching and cusswords, <em>Pretty Hate Machine</em>, still my favorite of Reznor's albums, is basically a dirtied-up Human League album (and Human League albums, it turned out, could stand to be dirtied up). The gas-masks, megaphone yowls, and apocalyptic despair of his subsequent albums were fun, but his old-school devotion to song form and titanic hooks were the real reasons I once carved the NIN logo on a treehouse wall. As a producer, Reznor knows how to stack drones on top of each other and crystallize pianos like nobody else, but those studio tricks don't add up to much when he's not welding them to actual songs. There's not a song to be found anywhere on <em>Ghosts</em>; nearly every one of the untitled instrumental sketches here feels emaciated and half-finished. What we're left with is two hours' worth of really good soundtrack music for American remakes of Japanese horror films.</p><p>
    In the 90s, Reznor played patron saint to IDM OGs, commissioning Aphex Twin remixes and signing Meat Beat Manifesto to his nothing label. In that regard, <em>Ghosts</em> is <em>almost</em> Reznor's IDM record, only he's never been all that interested in jittery side-panning drum programming or vintage-synth blob-farts. And this isn't ambient music either; nearly every piece here feels like a piece of a Nine Inch Nails song, a DVD extra to a movie we might never see. Many of the best tracks here are straight-up fuzz-rock stomps, but without the burden of lyrical conveyance or song-progression, that riffage just hangs there, churning without purpose.
    </p><p>
    Elsewhere, Reznor pits staticy drones against each other to see what happens, and often there's a built-in sense of melody and a dynamic force at work; it's just frustrating that we never hear what Reznor might do with it. Sometimes he'll bury chattering electro beats under forebodingly tortured synth-tones. Sometimes he'll offer shockingly clear impressionistic Erik Satie-esque pianos, letting them plink prettily away for minutes at a time before sending some new ominous machine-hum to molest them. Every once in a while, he'll use a riff or a bassline that I could swear he's used before but can't quite place. But even if every one of these tracks stands as a formal experiment unto itself, after an hour or two these half-formed ideas begin to bleed indistinctly into each other, evolving into puddles of vaguely ominous aural mush.</p><p>
    When <em>Ghosts</em> works best, it's as a showcase for Reznor's estimable studio skills. Plenty of the individual sounds here are just gorgeous, and Reznor even expands his palette a bit to encompass marimbas, banjos, and percussively Beck-like slide-guitar. He layers these sounds expertly, setting glassy pianos against distant roaring-siren counterpoints or interrupting a pulsing drone-hum with a surprisingly accessible bar-rock chug. But even as the tracks progress, nothing really goes anywhere or stands on its own-- even the best track here is essentially half of a really good Nine Inch Nails song. And maybe it still will be; Reznor could take the pieces here and and make great songs out of them, sort of like how James Murphy took a beat from his Nike-sponsored long-form LCD Soundsystem piece <em>45:33</em> to make the incandescent ""Someone Great"". Until then, though, we're left with pieces of songs, nothing more. If I were one of those early deluxe-pacakge customers, I'd want my $300 back.

But Sian Alice Ahern, leader of the London, UK-based Sian Alice Group, is none of these things-- as a frontwoman, she's as likely to recede as take the lead. With her band's debut charting transformations from psychedelic rock, pastoral folk, and piano-lounge balladry into analog-synthtronica, free-jazz breakdowns, pounding Afro-tech grooves, and avant-classical composition, Ahern is the sort of vocalist who patiently waits for the songs to settle into shape before stepping up to the mic.</p><p>
    In their open-ended, exploratory approach to songwriting, Sian Alice Group-- co-founded with Rupert Clervaux and Ben Crook-- are logical additions to the Social Registry stable. But they'd be even more at home on the early 1990s Too Pure roster, which seemed to produce an inordinate amount of female-fronted bands (Stereolab, Laika, Th' Faith Healers, Pram) who severed psych from its 60s-rock roots and applied its principles to non-rock musical forms, emphasizing the music's hypnotic, repetitive qualities-- and, more often than not, sublimating their singers into a textural detail.</p><p>
    Ahern spends <em>59.59</em> vacillating between presence and absence. But her turns in the spotlight contribute a considerable amount of heat to an album mostly set on simmer, no more so than on the sinister swamp blues of second song ""Way Down to Heaven"": ""I'm on my way to heaven now,"" Ahern declares, but the dirty PJ Harvey riff sounds like it's pulling her down in the other direction before setting the song alight in a blaze of distortion and ear-piercing organ tones. ""Contours"" is another early standout, with Ahern's choral vocal leading the hazy, synth-swathed hymnal before the drums come crashing in and start hunting for Caribou.<br/>
<em><br/>
    59.59</em> could use a few more fiery moments like these; as the album settles into its more temperate second half-- marked by sullen, straight-forward piano lullabies like ""Murder"" and ""Heartless""--  the titular album length seems less a product of fortuitous circumstance than a premeditated goal, with the tracklist deliberately padded to arrive at the numerically neat running time. But the beauty of Sian Alice Group is that formalism is ultimately a temporary condition, and that the band is capable of creating highly effective music even when they stray far from traditional torch-song territory: ""Days of Grace III"" is built on a striking, repeated piano motif that accrues an almost ""Tubular Bells""-like tension, while the closing, free-floating instrumental ""Complete Affection"" (featuring Spiritualized/Spring Heel Jack member John Coxon on guitar and Gang Gang Dance's Brian DeGraw on piano) is messy, pained and cathartic-- like all good crying fits should be.</p></div>"|11316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11316-5959/|7.7|Stuart Berman

Indeed, covers have forensic value, revealing what a band has ingested. They also have sartorial significance; whose mantles do bands wear, and how do they fit? On <em>Cover Up</em>, Ministry rev up bluesy chestnuts, mostly from the 1970s.  2007's <em>The Last Sucker</em> was the band's final album of original material, but this odd coda may be more of a statement.</p><p>
    Ministry have gone through so many phases-- synth-pop, industrial dance, industrial metal, digital grunge, political thrash-- that their only connecting thread is Jourgensen. Even early on, he defied genre expectations. While his industrial peers wore fishnets, Jourgensen donned a cowboy hat and threatened to record a country album under the name Buck Satan. Amid Ministry's thunder lay flashes of humor: the scat-singing thrash of ""Jesus Built My Hot Rod""; a strangely affecting cover, included here, of Bob Dylan's ""Lay Lady Lay""; and scabrously edited soundbites of George W. Bush, Jourgensen's anti-muse on Ministry's final three records.</p><p>
    On <em>Cover Up</em>, Ministry send up heroes, not villains. The results are quite fun. Whether political or personal (Jourgensen's 20-year heroin addiction begrimed his late-90s/early-00s output), clouds have always hovered over Ministry; hearing them lift is refreshing. This is the afterparty for Ministry's career, and Jourgensen has brought out his oldest bottles. The Rolling Stones' ""Under My Thumb"" gets a tinkly intro that recalls Ministry's synth pop days. In 1990, Jourgensen covered Black Sabbath's ""Supernaut"" under the name 1000 Homo DJs; his howl was younger and more caustic then, and its inclusion here contrasts his lower, almost death metal-like growl on a bullheaded version of ZZ Top's ""Just Got Paid"". In its range, <em>Cover Up</em> subtly assays Ministry's decades-long run; a hidden track roasts their own hit ""Stigmata"" as an easy-listening a cappella. </p><p>
    In the last half of their career, Ministry loosened up, fuzzing up their guitars and slyly slipping in blues licks. After his seminal Wax Trax! days in Chicago, Jourgensen relocated to a Texas ranch which had formerly been a brothel. He refers to his current recording studio as a ""compound""; <em>Cover Up</em> only reinforces his outlaw image. Instead of preaching the apocalypse, he now runs a circus inside it.  Jourgensen sets the Doors' ""Roadhouse Blues"" to machine-gun thrash, yet warms it up with Hammond organ. On traditional work song ""Black Betty"", he revisits Ram Jam's classic, disco-tinged arrangement, but with huge, metallic riffs. Guitarist (and Prong frontman) Tommy Victor sings on two raucous cowbell workouts, Mountain's ""Mississippi Queen"" and Deep Purple's ""Space Truckin'"". Hearing the voice of Prong belting out Deep Purple over Ministry's hyperactive drum machine is simply sublime. </p><p>
<em>Cover Up</em> completes Ministry's transformation from industrial icons to beer-chugging humans. On Louie Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World,"" Jourgensen emits a lovably Tom Waits-esque croak over teary-eyed barroom piano. Then the song inexplicably becomes a British punk raveup, albeit with battering ram percussion and walls of digital distortion. It's elegiacal yet triumphant, crazy yet logical, ironic yet sincere. One can practically see Jourgensen's musical life flashing before his eyes.</p></div>"|11329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11329-cover-up/|7.5|Cosmo Lee

    Ah, the young, introverted male's bedroom. Home to countless hours of video games, classic rock albums, and sexual discovery-- it's no wonder ""Paperboy"", Jenna Jameson, and <em>Ziggy Stardust</em> blend together so seamlessly in the collective brain of many twenty-something males. New York five-piece Apes &amp; Androids have got a particularly bad case of this phenomenon. So bad that on their debut album, <em>Blood Moon</em>, it's difficult to determine where the digital sci-fi fantasy ends and the IRL hot-blooded yearning begins. Never before has a stronger case been presented for a <em>Nintendo Power</em> swimsuit issue.</p><p>
    Riding a Mountain Dew high, <em>Blood Moon</em> never meets a dramatic pose it doesn't like. All your late-night movie marathon heroes are here in some incarnation, from Robocop to Rocky Horror, and the band's not afraid to reach into the gooey middles of gauche genres like glam rock or John Hughes soundtracks. Opener ""Blood Moon I"" acts as a movie trailer for the album, suspensefully playing monkey, spaceship, and horror scream sound effects before launching into the alpha dog strut of ""Make Forever Last Forever"".</p><p>
    Not that it's a surprise, but <em>Moon</em>'s biggest slap-you-in-the-face moments come during the band's robo-Queen numbers. Although their itchy-finger synth arrangements wouldn't fly in any opera house, the neurotic arias on songs like ""Hot Kathy"" and ""Doyle is Dead"" feel like an accurate Information Age update of Freddy Mercury vocals. When their libidos spill over, those hyper vocals take on the glitchy plastic soul of <em>Midnite Vultures</em> or <em>Hissing Fauna</em>. ""Golden Prize"" pulls out all the stops, its melody hijacked by countless falsetto interruptions along with a cartoonish Arabian outro. There are even a few tender moments on the album, though they naturally come off more as tongue-in-cheek send-offs of 1980s sentimentality. ""Nights of the Week"" tackles the plight of the over-zealous party-goer, replete with a guitar riff modeled after ""Every Breath You Take"" and a touching reflection on college-aged burnout: ""These are the nights of the week when you pull yourself out of bed.""
    </p>
<p>
    The final third of <em>Moon </em>wades a little long in the soft stuff and loses the rest of the album's punch, but it could be so much worse. A&amp;A have earned a reputation for garish stage outfits and dance party concerts, and we've seen bands like this too often overlook their music, practically beating the listener into partying with cheap gimmicks and shock jokes. Fortunately, these guys know they're cuter than they are shocking. Like equally goofy acts Junior Senior and Datarock, A&amp;A find a happy medium between irreverence and ingenuity, doing their guilty pleasure touchstones a better service than today's deeper-browed bands ever could.

    Perhaps inevitably, an ability to easily find free music combined with user-friendly web technology has resulted in an increased ability to praise every fucking mp3 under the sun. Keeping up with every song and artist praised somewhere by someone feels less like a labor of love and more like a crushing obligation.  So imagine seeing Bell X1 getting the web in a titter with their stateside debut (and third album overall) on the strength of the following nugget of trivia: Damien Rice used to be in this band.</p><p>
    Whatever caused Rice to jump, it probably wasn't the band's (formerly known as Juniper) lack of commercial prospects. These guys aren't performing Rice's decaf froth, but plenty of other satellite radio stations could play <em>Flock</em>, which aims to be a sort of good ol' gloopy, romantic, somewhat psychedelic record á la the Verve's <em>Urban Hymns</em> or Coldplay's <em>X&amp;Y</em>. Unfortunately, like so many other middling bands from this decade, they see themselves as not just ubermenschen of empathy, but also disco infiltrators.</p><p>
    ""Reacharound"" manages to bring to mind John Wooden and R. Lee Ermey; the former because ""don't confuse activity with achievement"" applies to the aimless guitars, the latter for obvious reasons when lead singer/studio drummer Paul Noonan belts ""always good for a reacharound!"" in a horribly indecisive almost-falsetto.  As for would-be banger ""Flame"", it aims to capture that record-review chestnut ""angular"" but that would imply this shit is supposed to have <em>angles</em>, something to prod bodies into movement or draw blood.  Instead, ""Flame"" is like getting pelted with a mouse pad before closing with an embarrassingly unearned round of applause.  </p><p>
    At least those tracks are somewhat energetic; otherwise, Bell X1 uses a breakout as an excuse for ""Bad Skin Day"", six minutes of bedsitting (literally) self-pity over glassy cymbal washes and acoustic glaze.  Closer ""Lamposts"" is like this as well, only two mintues longer.  What ultimately undermines the group's attempts at resonance are vocalist Paul Noonan's stabs at bon mots-- see: ""Maybe it's a seasonal affective disorder"" or ""Maybe we're just sad or makin' V's like Nixon.""  Since I had a college roommate who loved the Barenaked Ladies, I'm at least prepared.  Check the bulletproof fly shit from single ""Rocky Took a Lover"" (aka ""Travis Made a B-Side""): ""[He said] You're such an asshole when you're drunk/ He said 'At least I'm OK in the mornings'/ She said 'I don't believe in any old Jesus/ If there was a God, then why is my arse the perfect height of kicking?'""  Astoundingly, that's not the track on <em>Flock</em> that's titled ""He Said She Said"".</p><p>
    At the very least, <em>Flock</em> allows me to clarify why I found <em>A Weekend in the City</em> to be woefully underrated-- the Bloc Party record managed to prove that ""strident"" and ""sappy"" weren't mutually exclusive, that you could pound your broken heart with a clenched fist.  And they did it under the weight of overwhelming expectations.  Bell X1 generically compartmentalize everything instead and end up with a record that doesn't even top the work of their former bandmate. <br/>

Great for fans, a little tricky for the media (print especially). But despite (or even because of) expediting the process, they've still effectively given the media its hook: Raconteurs flout the system, bend the (one would assume) will of their record company, and hurry their album's release, hacks like us be damned. The cynical might say this is a red flag and a marketing gimmick, comparable to the press being denied advance screening to an upcoming movie, but that's not the case here. It's not a challenging record, nor one with any otherwise presentable narrative around it; it's four accomplished musicians making a decent-to-great record.</p><p>
    For all their similar backgrounds, you'd think Raconteurs debut <em>Broken Boy Soldiers</em> would have come across as a little more fun to create. Their sophomore record seems hammered-out quickly, honing on what you'd expect from the members' pedigrees-- big hooks and bigger guitars, stuffed arrangements, and plenty of instrumental shock and awe. Or rather, it just makes all that sound easy. Even the fussiest arrangements feel natural, like friends screwing around rather than two songwriting talents facing off. This album isn't about the thrill of the new; the White Stripes have bent arenas to fit their particular vision, and the Raconteurs are grinning through their opportunity to fill them. From the first staccato scrape of guitar in the opening title track, White is easy to pick out of the mix, but the track's strolling swagger sounds like an easy compromise. A sudden eighth-note skip of the bass leads the band into a tempo boost that would be bar-rock by-the-books, were it not hiding a moment of cascading vocal harmonies and preceding a neck-constricting guitar solo. Other songs lean on overdone Ribfest-appropriate templates as well, but they all feature distinctive little details-- the Celtic violin of ""Old Enough"", the warm Memphis-borrowed horns on the tempo-shifting waltz ""Many Shades of Black"", the tweaked and overdriven licks of ""Hold Up"" or ""Five on the Five"".</p><p>
    Many of those touches will sound familiar to White Stripes fans, of course, not to mention indulging White's Zeppelin fandom just one more time on ""Top Yourself"" (this time with banjos!). More of that teeth-rattling circus organ from <em>Icky Thump</em> hides in the corners of the strutting ""Salute Your Solution"", while ""The Switch and the Spur"" mashes spaghetti-western horns and regal cascading piano lines with echoing guitar chords out of a reggae track, all cramped together like a tiny budget Tarantino soundtrack. Maybe the best the Raconteurs can deliver is something like closer ""Carolina Drama"", a shaggy dog song-story featuring the attempted homicide of a priest and a rogue milkmen in its lyrics-- it's a song that tweaks tradition with a knowing wink, but doesn't disavow the power of continuing it.
    </p><p>
    Despite leading much of the material, Brendan Benson doesn't contribute any ""Brendan Benson songs"" here; both he and White simply step forward as the occasion demands. The two vocalists, therefore, blur into one another in their roles as dual frontmen. White grows tremendously as a singer and gets a little of his mania back, while Benson tightens his belt a few notches and manages to sound just as excitable, notably on the tag-team vocal of ""Salute Your Solution"". Whether it was intended or not, White's personality sometimes overwhelms, and makes <em>Consolers</em> sound like a little sibling to <em>Icky Thump</em>-- a little less unique, certainly, but another loose, comfortable affirmation of what they do well.

That's perhaps unfair: Akron's Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney have perfected their own brand of Delta-tinged, garage minimalism. But after four albums, even they seemed to realize they had hit a creative wall. Luckily, in 2007, they were tapped by producer Danger Mouse for a collaboration with Ike Turner, though when he passed away last December, the project left the duo with a host of material. This became the foundation of their fifth and most adventurous album to date. Maneuvering between the King of Rhythm's <em>joie de vivre</em> and their crestfallen, crossroads-blues heritage, <em>Attack and Release</em> subtly expands the Black Keys sound.</p><p>
    An auteur raised on hip-hop, DM keeps the record from staying overly loyal to the Creedence or Free templates. This is a small but crucial difference from 2006's <em>Magic Potion</em>. He colors the band's no-frills narratives with futuristic accents or, on the opposite end, rural flourishes of psychedelia and folk. On each track they add a bolt of surprise that amplifies the pitch-black mood and message. Take the flutes and feedback of ""Same Old Thing"", which in combination suggest a childlike innocence peeled away by a cold, indifferent world. Likewise, a tension opens between the peppy xylophone and world-weary, Waitsian tremolo on ""So He Won't Break"". Longtime Waits and Elvis Costello guitarist Marc Ribot lends his powers to this song and to the anguished 6/8 masterpiece ""Lies"". Here (and elsewhere: ""Psychotic Girl"", ""I Got Mine"", ""Strange Times"") Danger Mouse's layer of backing vocals imbue these earthly stories with a beyond-the-grave air, taking lost-love themes to an eerily literal but quintessentially blues-y level. The unexpected organ line of ""All You Ever Wanted"" feels like a police ambush on this jilted-John ballad. We almost forget that, in light of the band's uniformly lo-fi discography, nearly every fresh sound on <em>Attack &amp; Release</em> should strike us as alien.</p><p>
    A sequence of slow burns, the record's tempos allow you to relish the details and the textures. ""Remember When (Side A)"", with its eddies of reverb, envisions nostalgia as something dim and meticulously crafted, with a touch of the fantastic. Speaking of the past, the raw, amplified wallop of the Black Keys' old days is still here, too. Given that Ike Turner was partly responsible for rock'n'roll's love affair with distortion, it would have been wrong for <em>Attack &amp; Release</em> to discard fuzzy riffs. The other side of ""Remember When"" will sooth anyone longing for their sinewy <em>Nuggets</em> rave-ups. Fans of previous BK records will find this song and the first single, ""Strange Times"", the bluntest weapons here.
    </p><p>
    ""Things Ain't Like They Used to Be"" leads the album to a grim finish. Auerbach's sluggish, hung-over melodies, echoed by teenage protégé Jessica Lea Mayfield's distant singing, carry an air of defeat. Addressed to an old lover, the lyrics describe a happier past, overgrown yards, a man blindly walking into battles, and other ingredients of lament. Yet Carney and Auerbach know that there's more to the blues than bad news. These men are stoics to the fingertips. ""It doesn't mean a thing to me,"" Auerbach repeats on the chorus. The jaded ex of ""Same Old Thing"" speaks the same language: ""It don't matter where you been."" We know better.

He's got an agile but easygoing rapping/singing voice, a murmuring rumble that he can switch from a deep raspy whisper to a piercing, high-pitched buzz on cue. He brags without being arrogant, his anger is short on rage and his sex rhymes are of the happily married, mild innuendo variety. There's not much glamor or danger in his lyrics or his persona; it seems more likely that a listener would want to hang out with him as a peer than live vicariously through him as an icon. I can't recall ever hearing about any beefs he might have had with anybody, and I can't imagine him getting involved in one any time in the future. He creates rap records Bill Cosby would find no problem with, records that your mom would probably like if she were young in the early 1980s, and it is almost impossible to feel like a hardass while listening to his music.</p><p>
    That last paragraph might have read like a condemnation, which is kind of sad in a way. Lyrics Born's brand of uplifting, inoffensive party rap is maybe the least cred-boosting form of hip-hop outside of nerdcore, the kind of stuff we worry that real heads from the street are laughing at us for listening to. But it's also likeably unpretentious, and the best parts of <em>Everywhere at Once</em> show Lyrics Born as a sort of lighthearted yet substantially energetic vocal presence at the center of a big, shameless funk record. After swapping sample-based production for a sound largely centered around the live band that's been backing him up during the many live gigs he's played since the release of 2003's <em>Later That Day...</em>, he's filled a pretty comfortable groove on this CD, front-loaded as it is with the sort of Rick James/Gap Band/Cameo turn-of-the-80s style that complements him well. Even when he's going full tilt at his modern SoleSides-cultivated West Coast backpacker smooth-and-assonant style, the band really brings out a halfway old-school vibe in his rhymes.</p><p>
    Despite a few underlying themes to some of the cuts-- ""Don't Change"" is the archetypal be-yourself anthem; ""Differences"" and ""I'm A Phreak"" and ""I Like It, I Love It"" cover the spats, sex, and love-struck excitement in relationships-- most of <em>Everywhere at Once</em>'s first half is geared towards flat-out lyrical gymnastic party rocking. Early single ""Hott 2 Deff"" (featuring a sharp verse from Chali 2Na's familiar basso profundo) is probably the biggest potential crowd-pleaser, riding on a ""Give it to Me Baby"" bounce and stacking hooks upon hooks. But it's the way Born builds up and rolls out each syllable to play off that groove that really makes it; it's one thing to read a verse of his to try and diagram where all the gears in his flow start meshing (""Then I'm jetty like a Chevy on fresh Pirellis/ I'm talking veni, vidi, vici, baby, rest is history""), but to hear it in action like its own kind of instrument, whether rapping or singing, is where the power actually lies. There's plenty more moments like that, like the way the semi-conversational tone he affects in ""Don't Change"" subtly acts as a second bassline, or the rasp that harmonizes with the ""Fopp""-esque guitar in ""I Like It, I Love It"", or one bit in ""Differences"" where he rattles off a string of words where every long ""e"" sound hits in time with the rhythm guitar. But as intricate as it all gets, none of it really sounds smothering or self-indulgent; if Lyrics Born has one defining strength it's his ability to get structurally and rhythmically adventurous in his flow while still remaining perfectly simple to follow linguistically.
    </p><p>
    The upbeat electro-funk mood eventually flags a little in the second half of the record, though part of that can be attributed to a couple of tracks that work on their own terms as more contemplative and personal moments. The downtempo ballad ""Is it the Skin I'm In?"" is subtly reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield, both in its plaintively-sung chorus and its reflections on racial self-consciousness. And ""Whispers""-- about the passing of his friend Benjamin Davis, aka rapper and KPFA rap radio show host Mack B. Dog (cop his short-but-great ""Hot Breath"" off <em>Solesides Greatest Bumps</em>)-- is a stirring eulogy with a Houston-tinged g-funk intensity and a laid-bare grief. Less effective are a couple diversions that stray a bit too far out of Lyrics Born's admittedly broad stylistic range; ""Top Shelf (Anything U Want)"" is a stab at dancehall that rarely gets deeper than its endless, smushed-together chorus, and hearing Lyrics Born tackle a bizarre Devo knockoff on the political screed ""Do U Buy It?"" only proves that there are limits to his singing voice's versatility (Mark Mothersbaugh being well outside them). But with only two weak tracks and some deletable skits outweighed by a dozen good-to-great cuts, <em>Everywhere at Once</em> is one of the best albums to come from a Solesides alumnus in along time-- and if anyone wants to give you shit for liking it, just turn it up until Shimura's voice drowns 'em out.

    It came from a basement in Malton, Ontario.
    The Toronto suburb seems ill-positioned to be the source of a
    dubbed-out catalog of unique and innovative roots reggae, but a wave of Jamaican
    immigration in the 1960s brought with it one Jerry Brown, an auto body mechanic
    who also happened to be a singer. Before leaving Jamaica, Brown had been an original
    member of the Jamaicans, the group that went on to record the rocksteady
    classic ""Ba Ba Boom"" after his departure.</p><p>
    Brown fell easily into the West Indian music scene that was
    exploding in Toronto in the late 60s, but it wasn't until 1974 that he got down
    to the business of establishing Summer Records and its accompanying recording
    studio in the basement of his Malton home. It was a shoestring operation, a
    labor of love, but it played host to some truly huge names in reggae, including
    former Skatalites keyboardist Jackie Mittoo, former Treasure Isle keyboardist
    Lloyd Delpratt, Leroy Sibbles, Stranger Cole, Johnny Osbourne, and producer
    King Jammy, who was still only Prince Jammy when he helped wire the studio.</p><p>
    That studio became the focus point for an aggregation of
    local talent, mostly from Jamaica,
    but also a few Jamaicans from England
    and even one local kid. The regulars at Summer coalesced into a house
    band with a firm grasp on the tight groove that anchors most good reggae. They
    took the name Earth, Roots &amp; Water, and in 1977, cut the first Summer
    Records LP, <em>Innocent Youths</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    The record went nowhere-- how could it have? It had an
    original pressing of just 500 copies, one of which was given to Sting by
    guitarist Matt Shelley when the band opened for the Police, who were touring North America for the first time. Despite its obscurity,
    though, Light in the Attic's new reissue reveals it as a creative and absorbing
    roots album. It flows like a dubbed-out late night jam session, moving from
    idea to idea as the musicians come and go and take breaks to smoke a little
    herb. The record's original Side Two is essentially a dub suite, skanking
    slowly from one section to another as a rotation of male and female vocalists
    take their turns at the mic. 
    </p>
<p>
    The three songs that made up Side One were more discrete.
    The opening title track features a haunting melodica lead and a deep, hollow
    rhythm track that houses rolling echoes and a rich bass line. ""Tribulations""
    could hardly have been a more powerful roots anthem in the hands of Burning
    Spear or Yabby You, with its slippery bass line, spectral vocals and spidery
    guitar work, though the tone of the string synth is admittedly a little weak. 
    </p>
<p>
    True to the previous volumes of the Jamaica to Toronto
    series, the album has been given a sonic dusting-off and comes with a thick
    book full of primary source information and amusing anecdotes, such as the
    story of the band playing between a local punk act and the Stranglers, and
    bluntly admonishing the crowd not to spit on them after seeing it happen to the
    opening band. It strengthens your connection to the men who made the music to
    hear it told in their own words. There's word that this is possibly the last
    title in the series, which is sad news, but the six volumes we've received have
    illuminated a treasure trove of great music from a scene that wasn't nearly as
    marginal as a first glance might make it seem.

    Jason Amm (aka Solvent) certainly isn't the first or last composer of happy ""robot music""; as one example, Jimmy Tamborello was similarly bubbly in his synth-pop alter-ego James Figurine before he was hammering out the electro-emo-pop of the Postal Service. But Amm's Solvent work is notable for its special melodicism and, more importantly, for its longevity. As this compilation's title suggests, Solvent has been around for over ten years now.</p><p>
    Amm originally compiled this retrospective as a tour-only primer for his tour supporting VNV Nation. The two-disc set certainly shows off the remarkable consistency of Solvent's run, so Ghostly's decision to release it isn't too much of a surprise. Older tracks like ""My Blue Car"", always in limited release and often out-of-print, are treats for fans, and later cuts like ""My Radio"" nicely chronicle Solvent's timely entry into the techno-pop revival of the early part of this decade. His work exhibits influences of the new wave as well as older, progressive electronic artists like Kraftwerk and YMO.</p><p>
    Solvent has at times been lumped with electroclash or IDM, but these comparisons never quite made sense. Artists such as Adult. (who turned in one of the four remixes on <em>Demonstration Tape</em>) or the IDM acolytes advocated sonic aggression as either an intensifier or an alternative, respectively, to the club. Though he uses heavier beats and more obtuse synthesizers than many of his contemporaries, Amm seems caught up in the idea of a boutique style of electronic music. He concocts pretty confections with buzzy drum machines, major-key synth lines, and sparse, faraway vocals that long for the pristine infinities of the future. It's almost difficult to sit through what appears to be the same message over and over: We're moving towards an age devoid of conflict, and our greatest challenge is to revel in the patterns constantly emerging from the complexities of time.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, the threat of conflict isn't necessary for a bunch of pretty songs or even an artistic statement. But instead of fully exploiting his palette, or hinting at the seemingly inevitable crises ahead, he's telling us over and over again to appreciate beauty. His approach, applied over ten years and distilled into two discs, washes together in a sea of ebbing, ever-evaporating, synthesized waves. It's certainly tempting to imagine such an elegant future. But even for all his major-key optimism, Solvent's is an outlook with only a disheartening modicum of stability: a homogeny that, quite simply, gets by.

That was the final R.E.M. disc to feature drummer Bill Berry, and in retrospect, Berry brought a lot more to the band than simply his drumming. But that hasn't stopped R.E.M from awkwardly furthering the plot. First came the often pretty but not quite rewarding <em>Up</em>. Next, the pleasant but uneven <em>Reveal</em>, and then <em>Around the Sun</em>, which even most hardcore fans disdained as lackluster at best.</p><p>
    But if rock-star longevity is at least partially political, the savvier-than-ever R.E.M. took it upon themselves to control their message. As the band's studio output dragged, it presented itself as a revitalized live outfit, turning out inspired performances that seemed wildly disproportionate to its increasingly dull LPs. <em>Reveal</em> didn't warrant a tour, but tellingly, the band's 2006 greatest-hits collection did, and on stage, R.E.M. relished the opportunity to disprove naysayers with blistering sets that spanned their entire career.</p><p>
<em>Accelerate</em> is the name of R.E.M.'s new album, the band's 14th, and it attempts to port that newfound vigor to the studio, not just by trading longtime producer Pat McCarthy (on board since 1998's <em>Up</em>) for U2 associate Jacknife Lee, but also by paring down the excess and sharpening the focus. <em>Accelerate</em> might as well be called <em>Reverse</em>, as it self-consciously aspires to recapture the spirit (if not necessarily the sound) of R.E.M.'s prime. Throughout its 11 songs and 35 minutes, only two tracks top the four-minute mark, and many run less than three. But velocity is not the same thing as vitality, and brevity is not the same thing as urgency. <em>Accelerate</em> ultimately isn't so much a back-to-basics move as a redefinition of what ""basic"" even means to an arena rock band. <em>Accelerate</em>'s broad strokes, big riffs, and beefy production (the album was reportedly recorded in ""just"" nine weeks) are admirable, as is the disc's concision, but its success is still more as a step forward than a slam dunk.</p><p>
    Still, the very fact that R.E.M. recognized a problem and made an effort to remedy it is pretty impressive from a band of their stature. You can immediately hear the results on the lead song ""Living Well Is the Best Revenge"": Jacknife Lee has given the track (and the rest of the album) a refreshing sense of grit that's at odds with McCarthy's fussier studio constructions. Peter Buck's guitar rings and chimes with a layer of aggression one step beyond that of <em>Monster</em>, the band's previous ""rock"" record. Drummer Bill Rieflin plays with a Ministry-honed power, Mike Mills' backing vocals are absolutely key, and Michael Stipe's vocals are gruff, pissed off, and mixed low enough to make the lyrics tricky to make out.</p><p>
    But ""Man-Sized Wreath"" is no match for that airless rush-- its vague 60-isms might make a solid B-side, but it's hardly a continuation of the opener's call to arms. The same can be said of the slick, safe single ""Supernatural Superserious"", the kind of song R.E.M. could write in its collective sleep. ""Hollow Man"", aside from its piano intro misdirection, might as well be the Gin Blossoms, Counting Crows, or any other middle of the road band R.E.M. influenced. ""Houston"" is about as weird as R.E.M. allows themselves to get these days, but against the odds the track's a highlight. It's a curious 6/8 dirge adorned with what sounds like a wheezing organ, featuring some nicely enigmatic lyrics and a musical toughness that updates the insular world the band introduced with <em>Automatic for the People</em>. Again, like ""Living Well Is the Best Revenge"", it unfortunately highlights the relative mundaneness of the next two songs, the title track and ""Until the Day Is Done"". </p><p>
<em>Accelerate</em> make a surprise finish, though, with its last four songs pushing the band to fresh places. ""Mr. Richards"" is a vaguely blurry hybrid ballad that hints at shoegaze, invoking the band's staid studio experiments but connecting them to the group's more aggressive origins. Similarly, the self-referential ""Sing for the Submarine"" recalls an <em>Up</em>-era waltz while name-dropping some blasts from R.E.M.'s more distant past. ""Horse to Water"" is pure rush, just over two minutes of condensed energy unlike anything R.E.M. has done to date, a kick in the nuts to anyone not impressed by what came before it. And as closers go, ""I'm Gonna DJ"" is an oddball but memorable choice, perfectly selected for its gonzo agitation. </p><p>
    If you forgot the last couple of R.E.M. discs as soon as they were released, love it or not, ""I'm Gonna DJ"" and much of what precedes it at least ensures that <em>Accelerate</em> won't be forgotten quite as quickly. But, like any act of rehabilitation, it's no seismic shift, just a move in the right direction. It's as if the band strived for resonance but settled for a satisfactory glimmer of renewed relevance.</p></div>"|11308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11308-accelerate/|6.7|Joshua Klein

    By the late 1960s, Simon &amp; Garfunkel had become the folk
    establishment. The duo-- who had been together since their teenage years, when
    they were known as Tom and Jerry-- were unfailingly polite, earnest, and very,
    very serious, singing gorgeous harmonies and guided by their belief in popular
    music as big-statement art. Even as they drew inspiration from the Greenwich
    Village folk scene of the early 60s, they were never quite part of
    it, and never quite so stringent as some of their peers-- simultaneously too
    straight-laced and too ambitious. Dispensing studious allusions
    to Dylan Thomas, Robert McNamara, and Frank Lloyd Wright, they were and remain
    primarily unthreatening and accessible, which forty years later makes them an
    ideal gateway act to the weirder, harsher, more complex folkies of the 60s
    counterculture. Since the duo's infamous break-up, how many teenagers have
    closed themselves up in their rooms poring over the lyrics to even Simon &amp;
    Garfunkel's most overwrought songs (like the high school poetry of ""The
    Dangling Conversation"") before graduating to Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, or Fred
    Neil?</p><p>
    Their status as a jumping-off point for further musical
    exploration might explain their durable legacy even four decades later, but
    Simon &amp; Garfunkel have a deeper, more consistent catalog than most of their
    peers. For all their politeness, they still took risks, still tried to
    innovate, as this document of their short 1969 tour proves. Released exclusively
    to Starbucks with a wider release planned tentatively for this fall, <em>Live 1969 </em>collects performances from
    their six-city run, which culminated in a two-night engagement on their New
    York home turf. Along the way, they premiered new songs from their forthcoming
    album, which would be titled <em>Bridge Over
    Troubled Water</em> and would prove to be their swan song. Part of the pleasure
    of listening to <em>Live 1969</em> is hearing
    early versions of ""Why Don't You Write Me"" and ""Song for the Asking"" and
    imagining what it would have been like to hear them with fresh ears, well
    before they became lodged in the American music culture. As Art Garfunkel
    remarks, ""This is also one of our new songs. It's called 'Bridge Over Troubled
    Water'."" Five and a half minutes later, the hall erupts in rapturous applause.</p><p>
    Another part of this album's appeal is hearing Simon &amp;
    Garfunkel's backing band rip through numbers like ""Mrs. Robinson"" and even ""The
    Boxer"". Having already played on their two previous albums, the ensemble-- Joe Osborn
    on bass, drummer Hal Blaine, pianist Larry Knechtel, and Nashville picker Fred
    Carter Jr.-- give these songs a spark of energy, loosening them up where the
    studio versions were tight and tasteful. When someone in the audience yells for
    more piano, Garfunkel replies, ""The keyboard should be louder, huh? What label
    do you produce for?"" That's pretty dickish stage banter, but sure enough, a few
    songs later Knechtel's more prominent piano puts extra bounce in ""Why Don't You
    Write Me?"", which here sounds like it should be a break-out hit.
    </p>
<p>
    In addition to offering proof that someone once yelled for
    ""Richard Cory"", <em>Live 1969</em> represents
    a turning point for Simon &amp; Garfunkel. By this point they were all but
    broken up, with Garfunkel ready to try an acting career and Paul Simon destined
    for a more productive solo venture. They played some of their last live dates
    together on this tour, and wouldn't play together again until their official
    reunion thirteen years later (unless you count their brief reunions on ""Saturday Night Live"" in the 1970s). The
    tension with which their partnership famously ended is nowhere apparent on <em>Live 1969</em>, although Simon seems to hang
    back while Garfunkel dominates, introducing the songs and running through Simon's composition ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" solo. 
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, <em>Live 1969</em>
    succeeds on the merits of its tracklist, which mixes hits like ""Homeward Bound""
    and ""The Sound of Silence"" with lesser-known tracks like ""For Emily, Wherever I
    May Find Her"", ""Leaves That Are Green"", and the lone unreleased cover, ""That
    Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine"", which had previously been covered by their heroes
    the Everly Brothers. Late on the album, the back-to-back sequencing of the
    quiet, self-consciously poetical ""Sound of Silence"" with the defiantly
    self-delusional ""I Am a Rock"" feels particularly inspired-- two takes on
    loneliness whose contrast makes it possible to hear both songs somewhat afresh.
    In fact, that seems to be the primary and most compelling goal of this belated
    release: to let us hear these songs as if for the first time, as a means to

    Repetition has always been Thomas Melchior's forte. Like any good minimalist, he knows how to drive a point home by tapping away, favoring patience over force. And after tapping away, in his inimitable style, for a long time now, he's made the best record of his career.</p><p>
    That doesn't mean that Melchior makes ""minimal,"" much less what might once have been called ""microhouse."" Yes, he favors a stripped-down palette, usually just a couple of drum machines and analog (or virtual analog) synthesizers, judiciously fleshed out with a captivating vocal sample. (<em>No Disco Future</em>, Melchior's second solo full-length, is one of his first productions using Logic software; previously he programmed everything into hardware sequencers.) But house music, in its origins, was more authentically minimalist than most of what flies under the banner of ""minimal"" today, if only by virtue of necessity: Most of Chicago house's classic tracks made do with a handful of machines at most. What has always driven Melchior's productions is less a fetish for reduction than an affinity for Afro-American dance music's lean aesthetic, bumping and flexing down a road potholed with silence. Melchior's economical sense of the groove descends directly from early 1990s pioneers like Ron Trent, Chez Damier, and Blaze (in their ""Lovelee Dae"" phase). His beat structures-- swung, skippy, with rubbery bass lines beneath and high-flying ""wildpitch"" ostinatos above-- don't seriously deviate from blueprints drawn two decades ago. What he brings to the music is an esoteric sense of sound design and an irresistibly hypnotic charge.</p><p>
    Melchior was born in Germany but spent much of his adulthood in London, before returning some years ago to Berlin. He got his start, in the early 90s, making acid, house, techno, and unusually danceable IDM in the duos Yoni and Vulva, for the labels Source and Rephlex, as well as working alongside the UK's house and techno pioneer Baby Ford in groups like Soul Capsule and Sunpeople. Melchior's multinational background goes some way towards explaining the unique character of his sound, just as his childhood education in Rudolf Steiner's unconventional Waldorf Schools suggests the origins of his dryly psychedelic, almost mystical approach to sound sculpting. (Fun fact #1: Sufjan Stevens is a fellow Waldorf alum. Fun fact #2: Melchior is a non-ironic student of astrology.)
    </p>
<p>
    For listeners acquainted with Melchior's earlier works, like his 2004 Playhouse album <em>The Meaning</em> and his various singles for Perlon, much of <em>No Disco Future</em> will sound familiar at first. He still makes the most out of an electronic drum kit that's been pared down to kick, snare, hi-hats, handclaps, a clave or shaker or two-- and very little else. As always, his tumbling rhythms are both headstrong and reserved, as though pulling in two directions at once. (Like Matthew Herbert's, Melchior's beats follow their own time, not the MIDI clock's.) He still favors stubby bass lines that stumble around the tonic, and he still uses synthesizers as though they were watercolors, splashing color here and there like a particularly slapdash Fauvist. Often, his melodies are only implied, pieced together out of carefully tuned drums and samples to suggest a continuity that's only half there. Listening to Melchior feels more active than usual because he invites you to do half the work.
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps most crucially, he still uses voices-- usually speaking, not singing-- to add a human element to his music. Often, the words or phrases are so indistinct to be meaningless, but their cadence adds an incalculable sense of life and breath to the tracks. (Not that the music would sound inhuman without them; skeptics who persist in criticizing electronic dance music for being cold, or programmatic, owe themselves some time with Melchior's fraught, fallible grooves: the white noise off his hi-hats alone burns hotter than your average indie four-piece.) Elsewhere, as with the titular phrase of ""Coming Up"", repetition blunts the words' signifying power, opening up a world of free associations. When, on ""The Hypnotist"", a woman intones, over and over, ""People smiling,"" and a man responds, equally deadpan, ""A nice warm feeling,"" you don't think of smiling people, or warm feelings: you just zone out on the assonance, transported by the mantra.
    </p>
<p>
    Compositionally, though, <em>No Disco Future</em> is a major step forward for Melchior. He's taken a penchant for the vertical axis-- accidental harmonies that arise from piling tone on top of tone-- and welded it to an increased focus on the long, horizontal line. ""Prepare for Love"", the album's opening cut, may lay out a familiar, shimmying groove, but it coats it in a layer of honeyed melody unlike anything he's done before. Like a melting sitar, it drizzles down over a four-bar structure in such a way that you can't tell where it begins and ends; it suffuses everything. ""Her Majesty"" follows a similar tactic, this time with slowly blooming pads vaguely reminiscent of the melancholic changes of Ricardo Villalobos' ""Dexter"". ""Don Juan"" represents Melchior's first foray into (quasi-)tango, with a backmasked accordion line that encloses its rollicking rhythms and Cuban-sounding vocals in a kind of protective cocoon, while the closing ""Water Soul"" swirls together strings, piano, and coolly ecstatic vocals in a manner recalling Melchior's collaboration with Luciano, 2006's ""Father""/""Solomon's Prayer"".
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, all of this is academic: either it grabs you or it doesn't. And <em>No Disco Future</em> grabs: it grabs, it blankets, and it holds. To return to the cocoon metaphor, it spins a dense web, a mutable and malleable shell that conforms to your moods and imparts an almost amniotic sense of security. I can think of few albums in all of house and techno that feel warmer or more comforting. Not that this is your garden-variety chillout disc: every cut here is made for dancing. That the album is simultaneously as cozy as a cashmere throw is entirely fortuitous. And there are moments of rare sublimity as well, moments that fly in the face of domestic comforts: ""Her Majesty"" is so sweeping, so grandiose, that it makes you want to rip out your heart and toss it off the highest cliff you can find. Taking flight, of course, is part of cocooning. Melchior's skill is taking those moments of abandon and weaving them seamlessly into the enclosure, until every action, and every object, becomes its opposite: every rhythm a melody, and vice versa; every beat a caress, every shove an embrace. It takes a particular kind of hypnosis to make such equations possible, and once you've submitted to Melchior's even back-and-forth, you won't be able to turn away.

In different circumstances, I would've gladly leaned on the astute description that WFMU's Tom Scharpling offers in the liner notes to the 3xCD <em>Supercluster</em>.  He paints the group as the end result of a sonic Venn-Diagram between the three groups (Dumptruck, the Embarrassment, and Volcano Suns) to whom Big Dipper's four members used to belong.  Of course, if someone already knows at least two of those three groups, then it's a safe bet that they already know about Big Dipper, and the logistical gymnastics I was putting myself through were unnecessary.  After careful deliberation-- I spent at least five whole minutes of the work day on this-- what I came up with is the sort of vague description that's exemplary of the stuff that inspires the sort of burn-the-witch rhetoric you'll find in any number of lazy newspapers and blogs looking to zing music reviewers-- ""they sound kinda like early R.E.M., but nerdier and with more heft.""</p><p>
    To translate into words that aren't as glib: I meant that Big Dipper shares early R.E.M.'s penchant for writing frisky pop tunes, but Big Dipper has a beefier bottom, and, well, they're nerdy.  They write songs about hunting down the Loch Ness monster, they pen paeans to former bandmates and their destructive house parties, they make reference to UFO enthusiasts and astronomers.  In even simpler terms: they sound a lot like what folks used to consider the sound of ""indie rock"" before the term became a meaningless catch-all banner for anything rock-like, unpolished, idiosyncratic, and potentially ""difficult"" for the average listener to dig.</p><p>
    In a lot of ways, Big Dipper's story follows the mythical story of indie rock (the culture) during those halcyon pre-grunge days.  If VH1 ever decided to revive their ""Behind the Music"" series to focus on the Homestead/SST underground, the general plot line of every episode would go something like this: ""As pedigreed underground darlings, with a small but loyal following within and outside the United States, [INSERT GROUP HERE] generated enough buzz to prick up the ears of the corporate music world.  But with big money came big pressures, and the group's major label dalliance proved to be their undoing.""  Whether by choice or circumstance, <em>Supercluster</em> opts to not include Big Dipper's one and only Epic Records release, <em>Slam</em>, which is probably for the better-- it's not awful, but horns and strings make awkward appearances on a good portion of the album, and the less adorned songs are too listless to make up the lost ground.
    </p><p>
    What's left of Big Dipper's discography is what's on <em>Supercluster</em>-- their debut EP <em>Boo-Boo</em>, two full-lengths (<em>Heavens</em> and <em>Craps</em>), a collection of Homestead-era outtakes and demos, and 15 previously unreleased tracks from post-<em>Slam</em> recording sessions that would have comprised, in the words of guitarist Gary Waleik, ""the make-good follow-up LP.""  The collection's first two discs show why long-time fans like Scharpling have kept the faith for so long.  Whether they were bashing out slabs of rock such as ""Younger Bums"" and ""Easter Eve"", or winding their way through alternate-universe radio hits like ""She's Fetching"" or ""All Going Out Together"", the group's awkward yet winning charm never faltered.  
    </p>
<p>
    While the polish of <em>Craps</em> seems to come at the expense of the friskiness evident on the <em>Boo-Boo</em> / <em>Heavens</em> tracks mentioned above, songs like the shimmering ""Semjáse"" and shame-free ballads like ""Bonnie"" show the group spreading its songwriting wings.  As for Waleik's claim about the demos available on the collection's third disc (titled ""Very Loud Array"") doing right by fans turned off by their first Epic offering: He's not just pissing in the wind.  If the group had the chance to record and release songs like ""Restaurant Cloud"", ""Edith"", and ""Silentium"" on Epic's dime, it might have had an album on par with its earlier work, something that found a happy middle ground between the group's herky-jerky quirks and its burgeoning musical maturity.  Instead, as with most groups of their era, it was remaindered by the industry, forgotten by all but a few loyal fans, and almost always referenced in a respectful, reverent fashion.  
    </p>
<p>
    There's a tendency with projects such as <em>Supercluster</em> to go overboard when trying to establish the excellence or greatness of the work being reissued, blowing all sorts of well-intentioned smoke up any available opening.  Scharpling, to his credit, expertly plays the role of shameless hype-man in his essay, going so far as to call this multi-disc set a ""crucial"" compilation of ""one of the best bands ever.""  You'll have to forgive me for not being as smitten with this otherwise enjoyable set of tunes.  Where he sees a grand artistic statement trumpeting the group's neglected importance, I see a small piece of graffiti in the back room of a club saying ""BIG DIPPER WAS HERE.""  The latter might not seem as big a deal as the former, but it's a part of history, and it's important for that reason.  Whether this group becomes someone's <em>Citizen Kane</em> or a listener's <em>American Pie</em> should be left in the hands of the listener. What really matters is that the listeners are given a chance to find out for themselves.

    A greater emphasis on country music elements was arguably the chief
    reason Band of Horses evolved from a pleasantly forgettable amalgam of
    My Morning Jacket and the Shins on the group's debut album into
    something noticeably more distinctive and satisfying by last year's
    follow-up, <em>Cease to Begin</em>.
    Without selling the newfound twang too thickly, the band nonetheless
    made a shift towards a down-home earthiness that
    tethered some of its more evanescent tendencies.</p><p id=""cg68"">
    Having formerly played with members of Band of Horses in the defunct
    sad-eyed Seattle outfit Carissa's Wierd, then-drummer Sera Cahoone
    followed its offshoot act long enough to handle kit duties for the
    aforementioned debut, departing prior to the recording of <em>Cease to Begin</em>.
    Clearly, however, she was on the same wavelength as her erstwhile
    bandmates regarding the need to temper ephemerality with something
    sturdier. Cahoone's own sophomore full-length, <em>Only as the Day Is Long</em>,
    could easily have wafted into the realm of wispy noncommittal Cat
    Power soundalikes itself if not for the reassuring presence of certain
    rustic-signifying instrumentation and arrangements.</p><p id=""j1oj"">
    Cahoone enacts this push-and-pull from the opening track, ""You Might as
    Well"", girding gently clomping drums and a folky guitar figure against
    her lambent, echoing vocals, the song's subtle country underpinnings
    turning it into something hypnotic as opposed to hazily undefined. Its
    successor, ""Baker Lake"", nicely introduces the banjo and pedal steel
    that will likewise help anchor Cahoone for much of the remainder of the
    album, the latter instrument superlatively decorating ""Runnin' Your
    Way"" and ""Tryin'"" in particular. A couple of times (""Happy When I'm
    Gone"", the title track) Cahoone's assembled players even rustle up a
    knotty acoustic groove near-worthy of Iron and Wine's last record. The
    record's most significant musical disappointment is that Cahoone
    doesn't grace the drum stool more herself, with ""Baker Lake"", which
    features the record's most sublime percussion by some measure, being her
    sole turn with the skins. 
    </p>
<p id=""extd"">
    As a singer and lyricist, Cahoone doesn't do
    terribly much here to shake herself from the shadows of luminaries like
    Cat Power, Lisa Germano, and Azure Ray. That's not to say there aren't
    plenty of nicely evocative moments, as Cahoone does an especially nice
    job of describing the physical spaces of tousled and fraying love
    affairs on ""Shitty Hotel"", the exquisitely languorous ""Seven Hours
    Later"", and the title track. A wearied but welcoming tone of acceptance
    also permeates several of these songs, including ""You're Not Broken""
    and ""Baker Lake"", and Cahoone mostly does a good job of skirting
    banalities, though ""Runnin' Your Way"" comes mighty close with
    pick-me-ups like ""You've got so much left in you/ And a big old world
    to see."" Once she catches wind that real country immersion demands
    narrative heft as well as music solidity, Cahoone will be a true
    earth-bound force.

For me, his pin-up status de-authenticated his music, which seemed     mopey and unsubstantial. He sounded detached, like a stoner at a funeral, and     the songs on the Lemonheads' break-out album, <i>It's a Shame About Ray</i>, were so short (several under two minutes)     and the hooks so nonchalant they sounded accidental, all of which suggested a     paucity of ideas and a short attention span reinforced by song titles like     ""Rudderless"" and ""My Drug Buddy"".</p>
<p>So, when Rhino's new reissue arrived in the mail a few weeks     ago, I put it in my early 90s boombox out of pure nostalgia, mildly curious to     hear how or if it had aged. Since then, I've kept playing it for very different     reasons, which are more difficult to pinpoint and hopefully say as much about     the music as they do about me. Almost 16 years after its initial release, Dando's     slacker pop sounds almost Zen. Those short songs now seem concise and even     disciplined. What was once mopey now plays as something much more complex and     contradictory: exuberant pop melancholy.</p>
<p>Some background: The Lemonheads formed in Boston     during the mid-1980s and released three albums of fuzzy punk-pop on local label     Taang! Records before signing to Atlantic in 1989. Their 1990     major-label debut, <i>Lovey</i>, wasn't a     huge return on the investment, but in the two-year interval between that album     and <i>Ray</i>, Nirvana and the ensuing     alternative boom proved that smaller bands and unlikely signings could have     enormous commercial prospects. The Lemonheads both benefited and suffered from     this new pop cultural climate: Just as <i>Ray</i> found a more open-minded audience, it was also disregarded by so many kids like     me, who were suddenly very serious about music, <i>man,</i> and saw only Dando's model looks, not his songcraft. Never     mind that <i>Ray</i> is as much a junkie     album as <i>Nevermind</i>, written and     partly recorded during a particularly narcotic-heavy trip to Australia.     No wonder Dando was a pin-up: He was handsome but damaged, a fixer-upper. If he     was the Jordan Catalano before Jared Leto, then the do-they-or-don't-they     controversy between him and roommate/bassist/kissing partner/self-professed     virgin Juliana Hatfield made them the Ross and Rachel of the ""120 Minutes"" set.</p>
<p>Now that all of that hubbub has died down and Dando is just     another alt-act trying to make a comeback, <i>Ray</i> sounds nearly revelatory in its restlessness, mixing college pop with country     flair and relocating Gus Van Sant's Portland     atmosphere to New England. The most beguiling aspect of     the title track, one of Dando's best compositions, is its impenetrability: It     could be about anyone or pertain to almost any bad situation, and that     ambiguity suggests some tragedy that can't be named or faced. ""The Turnpike     Down"" descends on a tripping hook that sounds altogether too bubbly for the     material, while ""Alison's Starting to Happen"", inspired by a friend's ecstasy     trip, sounds genuinely excited, especially when Dando starts rushing his words     towards the end. ""Kitchen"", with its handclaps and effervescent jangle, rubs     elbows with the tense chords and casually manic repetitions of ""Rudderless"",     where the acoustic guitar sounds spikier than the electric. And the bow on the     package is the not-necessarily-ironic cover of ""Frank Mills"", a song from the     musical <i>Hair</i> that Dando sings with a     charmingly goofy bliss.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a reissue of a reissue: Less than a year     after its initial release, <i>Ray</i> was     re-released with that cover of ""Mrs. Robinson"" as a bonus track. It was more of     a marketing than a musical decision, some suit's confounding idea to commemorate     the 25th anniversary of <i>The     Graduate</i>. So, take a red fine-point Sharpie and write ""(bonus track)"" next     to that song title, and pretend it's a curious rarity rather than the lame     album closer it became. The song is more endearing as a lead-in to Rhino's     unearthed bonus tracks, which sound like they've still got dust on them. Aside     from the B-side ""Shaky Ground"", which doesn't need the full-band treatment to     convey its slept-on melody, there are nine rough demo versions featuring mainly     Dando accompanying himself on guitar. That's three-quarters of the album, which     isn't bad.</p>
<p>There's also a DVD of videos and live performances from the     Lemonheads' Australian tour, showcasing the circle of friends who inspired the     album as well as a dated title-track clip starring Johnny Depp. But the real     attraction here is that set of demos: Dando's songs stand up exceptionally well     stripped to their barest essentials, especially ""My Drug Buddy"" and ""Bit Part"",     which loses Peggy Noonan's shouted intro but features tender backing vocals     from Hatfield. Ultimately, these demos prove how much craft and care went into the     album's unique blend of levity and gravity, which sounds so unaffected it could     easily be missed.</p></div>"|11324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11324-its-a-shame-about-ray-collectors-edition/|8.4|Stephen M.

    Like recognizes like, and nowhere in music is that better articulated than in the hyper-stratified world of techno, where labels, rhythms, cities, and influences combine to make co-ordinates, and by extension, neighbors. If message boards are anything to go by, many bristled when Berlin's Get Physical first commissioned the latest installment of its <em>Body Language</em> DJ mix series from non-DJs Junior Boys, and yet both sides' co-ordinates are similar enough that the pairing actually makes sense; melody, warmth, a dollop of retro, and the renaissance of the artful dance vocal are just a few of their shared affinities.</p><p>
    The Junior Boys might not be expert mixologists, but as their LPs and remixer choices imply, they are voracious listeners with a clearly defined aesthetic. <em>Body Language 6</em> plays to those strengths, shuffling between straightforward minimal techno, tracks from modern vocal-led dance contemporaries, and a handful of electro, disco, and new wave obscurities with the free-associative looseness and comfort of someone half-drunkenly interrogating their own LP collection.</p><p>
    This eclecticism is both <em>BL6</em>'s greatest strength and weakness. Mixwise, it plays more like a loosely assembled block of individual moments rather than a fully formed set, the emphasis seeming more on the selection process of the pieces themselves rather than the way they hang together, as and such, might not fare well with those accustomed to <em>Body Language</em>'s typically immaculately rendered rises and falls. As a panoramic snapshot of sounds and influences, though, it works beautifully. In fact, the range of variety on display in <em>Body Language 6</em> conjures up comparisons to January's <em>DJ-Kicks</em> entry from Get Physical's flagship act, Booka Shade, which melded offbeat retro and sleek, streamlined techno to similar effect. </p><p>
    Structure-wise, <em>Body Language 6</em> can be broken down into three basic acts. There's the rhythm-centric first third, which leans hard on techno and house, intercutting favorites like Supermayer's ""Saturndays"" and DJ Hell's remix of Chelonis R. Jones' ""Deer in the Headlights"" with more obscure sidebars like Love Nine's grinding ""Feedback"" and the brokedown rhythms of Kreon &amp; Lemos' seasick ""Fola"". The familiar, whirligigging synths of Kelley Polar's ""Rosenband"" introduce the album's second and meatiest portion, a colorful half-hour of texture, synth and vocal-rich house and electro.
    </p>
<p>
    Not surprisingly, it's in this section that the mix sounds at its most authoritative; after softening things up with Steadycam's pressurized ""In the Moog For Love"" and Todd Terje's groove-heavy take on Studio's ""Life's a Beach!"", the pair sandwich bits of obscure italo (Pushé's ""Don't Take Your Love Away"") and spangly retro (Visage's ""I'm Still Searching"") between three newer tracks: Matthew Dear's superb ""Deserter"" B-side ""You Know What I Would Do"", Stereo Image's ""Dark Chapter"", and their own, previously unreleased orphan ""No Kinda Man"". Even though there's an ocean of 25 years between the five songs, their connections come logically and easily, making for one of the most satisfying stretches on the mix.</p><p>
    The fading strains of ""No Kinda Man"" (itself a serviceable but perhaps unremarkable b-side) give way to the album's final third, which consists of a quick squiggle of noir techno from Rework, Chloé (whose thrilling ""Be Kind to Me"" is clipped after two minutes) and F0st3r (aka Junior Boys' touring drummer Dave Foster). An appropriately off-brief non-sequitur from new wave alchemist Bill Nelson closes out the mix, underlining, in its three minutes, the set's devotion to materials over transitions. If cohesiveness and a DJ's artfulness are what you're after, <em>Body Language 6</em> probably won't do much for you; those more interested in some fast and thoughtfully compiled glimpses of what gets spun on the Junior Boys' private time will find lots to like.<br/>

As the Brooklyn group's mix of bleeping sub-disco, stoned moaning, and Casio dub has slowly expanded, the latter faction seems to have grown, too. Even positive reviews often seem bemused by Excepter's peak-and-valley drift, especially their meandering live shows, which can alternate between magic and tedium. But if you've drank the Excepter Kool-Aid, the group's ""boring"" stretches are part of their charm, as they can sneakily morph into epiphanies. In that sense, Excepter are a psych group, their music mimicking the way drugs kick in right after you stop checking to see if they have.</p><p>
    The funny thing is, there actually aren't that many dead spots on Excepter albums. <em>Throne</em> and <em>Sunbomber</em> are filled with peaks, and even less consistent efforts like <em>KA</em> and <em>Alternation</em> have minimal valleys. It helps that singer John Fell Ryan is an excellent editor, mining musical gold from raw sonic murk. Still, the threat of boredom always lurks, which explains how music this passive-sounding can be so tense. Ryan knows when to let ideas work themselves out, allowing generic sounds to gestate into something new. Sure, Excepter's music could be sharper and tighter-- but it would probably be drier and less interesting, too.</p><p>
<em>Debt Dept</em>, Excepter's first release on Animal Collective's Paw Tracks label, is neither sharp nor tight, but simply another solid addition to the band's oeuvre. It takes the shape of an Excepter show, starting slow and a bit lifeless, as if the musicians are warming up separately. The lumbering ""Entrance 08"", thin ""Shots Ring"", and hip-hop-ish ""Kill People"" are all interesting but skeletal, like promising tracings that the band forgot to ink in. But <em>Debt Dept</em> rewards patience; once ""Any and Every"" launches into a Black Dice-like mix of beats and yelps, Excepter ride a unwavering high the rest of the way.</p><p>
    Much of this high comes from standard Excepter strengths-- rolling loops, clicking drum machines, and droning synths woven together deftly by Dan Hougland, Jon Nicholson, and Nathan Corbin. But there's also a boost from new singers Clare Amory and Lala Harrison, who hum hypnotic circles around Ryan's zombie moans. It recalls Excepter's early days, when previous vocalists Caitlin Cook and Calder Martin made the band sound like a cemetery full of ghosts. No one will confuse <em>Debt Dept'</em>s sparseness with <em>KA'</em>s noise, but it's nice to hear that element seep back into the band's elastic approach.</p><p>
    All these factors make ""The Last Dance"" smoothly hypnotic, ""Walking Through the Night"" gorgeously eerie, and ""Sunrise"" (which ends with a strange semi-cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Higher Ground"") insistently tense. And they peak in ""Greenhouse/Stretch"", whose two mesmerizing halves-- one a wavy synth stomp, the other a trippy dub loop-- are bridged by sublime female vocals. Such highlights would be impossible without Excepter's willingness to risk tedium, and <em>Debt Dept</em> is a testament to the value of ambition over perfection.</p></div>"|11323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11323-debt-dept/|7.8|Marc Masters

From Sun Records through Suicide and Spacemen 3 to Bruce Springsteen's <em>Nebraska</em> and so on, it's hard to go wrong submerging your songs in sonic soup or a comforting cloak of cool, mystery, and sometimes both. In the wrong hands, though, it can be a real crutch, studio shorthand that confers mood at the expense of the music. Trevor Montgomery, who records as Lazarus, loves reverb, and one assumes Jason Quever (of Papercuts not-quite-fame) loves reverb, too. Quever produced <em>Hawk Medicine</em>, the third disc from Lazarus, and from the humming organ to the drums to the vocals, everything seems to be draped with reverb.</p><p>
<em>Hawk Medicine</em> could have been a complete mess, but like the best conflations of song and sound (Lee Hazelwood's ""Some Velvet Morning"", for example) it succeeds as more than just a superficial exercise in style. Here the pervasive reverb, combined with Montgomery's slightly adenoidal croon, creates an almost timeless late-night vibe, certainly indebted to the 1960s but still drawing from the dark corners of the last several decades of folk, country, and rock music.</p><p>
    The key is that Montgomery's songs would likely work in any setting, even stripped down and laid bare. The melodies coursing steadily through songs like ""Baby True"" and the instrumental ""Disco"" are subtle, to be sure, but they're there, and they have a tendency to grow in power the longer they stick around, often with modestly cathartic results.
    </p><p>
    If not exactly tormented by demons, Montgomery clearly has a lot on his mind, too. ""It hurts when we talk, it burns when we pray,"" he mumbles in the dirge-like ""The Manic"", like a guy about to throw himself off a bridge, ""So who gives a fuck?"" ""Hawks"" is similarly a downer, brightened only a bit by some embellished picking before giving way to a dark, noisy release, Nick Cave by way of Ian Curtis. In ""The Sky of the Tall Sun"", Montgomery rails against materialism like a guy who had it all before seeing the anti-consumerist light. ""Surrender to the heart, surrender to the sun,"" he seems to be commanding near its conclusion, as if finding salvation from the oppressiveness of the almighty dollar in the only two things that give us unconditional life.
    </p>
<p>
    Songs like ""Breathe"" and ""Sister"" take great advantage of the spacious yet intimate atmosphere, with Montgomery sometimes almost lost amidst the deceptively spare but very effectively earthy instrumentation. These bleaker sketches heighten the impact of ""Sewest"", one of the few places where <em>Hawk Medicine</em> picks up the funereal pace, at least before Montgomery leaves us with ""Forsaken"", its final notes fading like a sinister sunset. When the album ends, the stillness and silence that follows feels almost like an intended coda.

I wish I'd never heard <em>Comin' Out Hard</em> or <em>Ridin' Dirty</em> or even <em>www.thug.com</em>. I wish we could all just be droll about Rick Ross' need for a bra, his insistence on rhyming the same word with the same word multiple times a verse, and his little waddle in the opening 45 seconds of the ""Speedin'"" video. But here it comes, marching into the commercial American sunlight. The second album from the Miami rapper whose sole strength as an MC is that he may or may not have touched a kilo of soft a few times in his life. <em>Trilla</em>, Rick Ross's inexplicable second album, is every bit a fatty contemporary American disaster.</p><p>
    Synthesizers fill every space where things like human voices or silences might go. Ross struggles with negotiating the most basic couplets. He doesn't so much articulate words and phrases as simply drop his jaw and eject whatever. The only moderate successes are songs (""Luxury Tax"") where Ross lets MCs like Trick Daddy and Lil Wayne focus on things like diction and syntax. ""Speedin'"", the sole arena of fun on <em>Trilla</em>, at least has Ross trying to squeeze out some item-based personality: ""Caesar's salad/ Caesar's palace/ You not a boss little nigga 'cause your cheese is average!"" Of course, that fun is all part of an unconscious self-parody-- DJ Khaled and Diddy and Fat Joe and the Runners (whose presence on a CD is becoming reason enough to shred it) each helming their own speedboat, the horsemen of a delusional costume party.</p><p>
    Hip-hop fans invested in history and emotion are bound to recoil at song titles like ""DJ Khaled Interlude"" and shake their heads at Ross' eleventh-hour attempts at humanizing himself (they're on album-concluding ""I'm Only Human"" and involve chocolate milk-related flatulence). Ross's attempts at self-definition-- ""This Me"", ""Here I Am"", ""The Boss""-- are as calculated and chilly as his odes to consumption are revealingly spirited (""Maybach Music"", ""Billionaire"", ""Luxury Tax""-- in that sequence, no less). Repetition is one thing, but having America's favorite ASIMO, T-Pain, squawking ""Boss! Boss! Boss!"" is something else entirely.
    </p><p>
    Maybe it's a question of geography. A friend from Florida explained to me last week why non-Floridians could never ""get"" Miami rap. He illustrated it as a matter of utility: New Yorkers listen to rap composed in and designed for suffocating, intimate, cell-like rooms. California rap is for slow cruising, oven-baked afternoons, and suburbs that can turn deadly on you, literally, around the corner. Miami? Peacock posing on South Beach, tops down, windows down, and vacuum synthesizers spilling into the atmosphere like digital locust hordes. In that case, consider <em>Trilla</em>, in all its deaf, shrieking power, a sound that sadly symbolizes the blissful complacency of now.

    To put it (very) lightly, the B-52's have never felt at home completely in the here-and-now, preferring to mix together modern and outmoded styles in a parallel universe of garish fashion.  The band's stone-cold classic 1979 debut still sounds like nothing else before or after: A surf-rock soundtrack to an early 60s spy film about a gay underground dance culture from the future.  The band's self-consciously retro appeal was never a gimmick, and still isn't: It's rooted at the foundation of the genre they created and own, to the extent that it's their brand.</p><p>
    Like their debut's late 70s debts to new wave and garage rock, there's a lot about <em>Funplex, </em>the band's first album since 1992's <em>Good Stuff</em>, that says 2008 loud and clear.  The visual elements that make the B-52's undeniably themselves-- Pierson's and Wilson's dos and dresses, Schneider's gaze and pose-- are present on the cover, but on top of a stark white infinity backdrop and with the sterile clarity of digital photography.  The band brought in producer Steve Osborne, who's got some experience giving old bands new sounds-- he helmed New Order's 2001 comeback <em>Get Ready</em> and Suede's electro-pop departure <em>Head Music</em>--  and he gives the band its most massive sound yet, as if they've returned to reclaim their dance-band throne through volume and size alone.</p><p>
    While <em>Funplex</em>'s super-sized dance pop can't quite compare with the band's best moments, there's plenty of residual B-52's-ness to
    satiate longtime fans.  The title alone, which hints at a self-contained universe of good times and weirdness, is appropriate for a band so prone to creating self-contained worlds like ""Planet Claire"", ""Private Idaho"", ""53 Miles West of
    Venus"",  and of course, ""that little old place
    where we can get together.""  Though the band members' average age is now in the mid-50s, they still navigate their surroundings with the naivete of tourists.  When Fred Schneider paves the way toward the chorus with the lyric ""Faster, pussycat/ Thrill, thrill!/ I'm at the mall/ On a diet pill!"", I can't tell if he's being sarcastic or honestly reveling in his superficial surroundings, and that alone is evidence that the band hasn't lost much of what made it so great in the first place.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Funplex</em>'s songs are just as jubilant as they were on <em>Cosmic Thing</em> and <em>Good Stuff</em>, with bits of dark surf guitar, outer space, travel themes, and of course, kitsch culture bleeding through the high-gloss electro-pop.  ""Deviant Ingredient"" brings some lounge and exotica along for the ride down ""that Martini mile,"" and ""Hot Corner"" sneaks a dark guitar rumble under the verses with a with an ebullient Cindy Wilson/Kate Pierson chorus, as the band transforms a 3 a.m. bus stop into a dance party.  Even a bit of the band's political bent comes across on closer ""Keep this Party Going"", but in a pleasingly non-didactic manner that would fit any era: ""Take this party to the White House lawn/ Things are down and dirty in Washington!""   
    Most importantly, though, all of it's delivered in three
    of the most recognizable timbres of the past 30 years, which sound as wonderful
    as ever. When they harmonize, Pierson and Wilson
    conjure a giddy, yet spooky femininity attributable only to the band,
    and as for Schneider,
    there's still no one else making music who can pull off the ""Ultraviolet""
    lines ""There's a rest stop/ Let's hit the G-Spot!"", or ""Tell your skirt
    to take a hike!""   
    </p>
<p>
    This isn't to say that the band is above its more confessional bits:  At one point, Schneider blurts out a line that might have come fro<em>m Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer</em>: ""I am a fully eroticized being! No more neuroses!""    This overriding theme of <em>Funplex</em>-- temporarily forgetting your troubles and giving over completely to the pleasures of getting down-- underscores the album's two best moments, ""Juliet of the Spirits"" and ""Eyes Wide Open"".   ""Juliet"" is the album's ladies-only electro-jam, Pierson and Wilson's voices pushed into a deleriously high register, and asserting on the wide-eyed chorus ""I'm not afraid anymore.""  ""Eyes"" moves from a dark, claustrophobic verse to an expansive disco-tinged refrain, triggered by Strickland's crisp, echoed guitar:  ""I don't wanna clash/ I don't wanna rehash the past/ I just wanna release!""</p><p>
    There will always be those boring purists who think that punk bands should forever play punk or die, or that people over 50 shouldn't have sex or, you know, fun, two silly myths more than debunked here (as well as with Bob Mould's latest reincarnation).  <em>Funplex</em> is a place, but it's also a condition.  No matter what the B-52's do, they can't help referencing what they're doing and how great of a time they're having while doing it, and wonder, Why aren't you doing it too?   It's fitting that, along with R.E.M.'s <em>Accelerate</em>, both canonized groups to crawl from Athens at the dawn of the 80s have reappeared nearly 30 years after forming to release pretty damn good pop-rock records.  Records that thankfully emphasize a way to age gracefully that takes the sonic shape of stuff traditionally associated with those much younger.  The B-52's may have no desire to rehash the past, sure, but they know how to adapt.

The effects of his best tracks, among the best in techno history, tend to be more incremental than incendiary. The arc of his career, so long and actually arcing, has never swerved through the kind of progressive flashpoints that make for grand narrative. Craig has always been about reform more than revolution-- even for his most stalwart fans, voicing support has been less a matter of redrawing electronic music borders than of waving flags for whatever Craig happens to be doing at any given time.</p><p>
    But not all of it: Another reason Craig is hard to talk about is that a fair amount of what he's done has been less than essential. It wasn't long ago that Craig seemed to be going the way of other aging Detroit techno artists whose reputations owe more to legacy than to potential. However interesting his forays into jazz fusion, however stirring the occasional track that reiterated his influence, Craig remained stuck somewhere foggy between the there-and-then and the here-and-now. And the problem was compounded by the fact that there was never a single manageable manifesto-- a lone album, mix, or compilation-- that you could hand a new initiate and just say ""...<em>here</em>.""</p><p>
<em>Sessions</em> is that manifesto, at long last. Gathering 23 original tracks and remixes on two continuously mixed CDs, it catalogs all the hallmarks that have come to define Craig from the start: his concise beats, his distinctive warmth, his fluency with all the different subtleties and nuances of ""soul."" All prove abundant on Disc One, which moves between tracks made from 1992 to 2007 without showing the slightest bit of strain. The newest cut is one of the recent epics that have reasserted Craig's importance in the present: a remix of Junior Boys' ""Like a Child"" that plays arpeggiated vertigo games with source material whose emotive delicacy Craig retains while piling on sci-fi strings and a hissing beat that creeps until it cracks. The nature of that crack-- into a crevice burrowed between a spirited house-y saunter and robotic techno drive-- figures in other tracks as old as Paperclip People's ""Throw"" and as new as a remix of Delia Gonzalez &amp; Gavin Russom's ""Relevee"", which pushes cosmic synth patterns past the red-line toward something more majestically black and blue.
    </p><p>
    Disc Two features fewer remixes of other artists and more tracks of Craig's own-- either under his given name or aliases like 69, Tres Demented, and Innerzone Orchestra. Though two of the highlights are in fact more remixes: a steaming, stomping, strobing rework of Faze Action's ""In the Trees"" and a tender take on X-Press 2's ""Kill 100"", whose fleshy vocals and dark acid lines signal Craig's facility with both pop humanism and techno alienation. Plus, like so much on <em>Sessions</em>, it's hard to place in time. Indeed, the most noteworthy aspect of this invaluable set is that there's so little disparity in terms of quality between tracks that span 15 years. They're all just simply, extremely, uncommonly, uniquely... well, <em>good</em>.

    The relationship between drone and noise can be hard to define. Sometimes they are sides of the same coin; other times they conflict like boxers in a clinch. It's easy to say that not all drones are noisy, and not all noise is drone. But when a band combines the best of both, making something bigger than either could muster alone, words tends to fall short.</p><p>
    At least, it's tough to capture the power of <em>At All Ends</em>, the umpteenth release from Portland's Yellow Swans. Since 2001, the duo of Pete Swanson and Gabriel Mindel Saloman have used vocals, guitar, and a wide array of effects to make music that constantly resists definition. They can sound abrasive, industrial, dreamy, electronic, even symphonic. Though they've earned a spot among the cream of the American noise underground, their music is so versatile and malleable, it's tough for any genre to fully claim it.</p><p>
    Which means Yellow Swans haven't always made drones, nor have they always made noise. But they are certainly great at making each, and <em>At All Ends </em>shows they are even better at making both at once. This is an unashamedly epic album of grand noise-drones, with ambitious pieces in search of infinite expansion. Terms like ""end,"" ""stretch,"" and ""mass"" pop up in the song titles, suggesting that for Swanson and Saloman, universes of sound can fit into 10-minute chunks of music.
    </p>
<p>
    If that's what they believe, <em>At All Ends</em> offers a convincing case. The album opens with the title track, a 12-minute journey to the center of guitar drone. Building into a holy mountain of static, it should be example number one in some future Wikipedia entry for ""noise-drone."" ""Stretch the Sands"" follows with long, screeching tones, like a horror-movie negative of the opening track's soothing waves. Those are two daunting pieces to start a record with, but <em>At All Ends</em> continues to rise, peaking with the masterfully-constructed ""Mass Mirage"". Here, Yellow Swans turn four shimmering guitar chords into first a sonic cathedral, then a trembling earthquake, and finally a pensive denouement, as the original four chords return like a phoenix escaping quicksand.
    </p>
<p>
    This all might sound a bit lofty, but Yellow Swans' music is far from pretentious. It's actually pretty visceral, often as fun as a rollercoaster. And they can tell a joke, too: The title of the closing track, ""Endlessly Making an End of Things"", must be a self-deprecating reference to the band's sonic tail-chasing. But even if they acknowledge their ambitions, Yellow Swans don't apologize for them, and they shouldn't. <em>At All Ends</em> is as huge as it wants to be, maybe even more.

    When two artists with résumés like Jarboe and Justin Broadrick join forces, it's hard not to have high expectations. It would take many more words than this review warrants to describe the immense influence these artists have had on underground music: Between Broadrick's work with Napalm Death, Godflesh, Final, Techno Animal, and Curse of the Golden Vampire-- and that's leaving out a bunch (!)-- and Jarboe's with Swans, World of Skin, her solo albums, and numerous collaborations, all kinds of genres have been touched upon, if not entirely reworked: ambient, blues, cabaret, digital hardcore, doom, drum'n'bass, dub, grindcore, electronica, gothic, industrial, shoegaze, pop, psych folk, regular ol' rock, tribal. An open-eared musicologist could notice how these various strains grew horns, fangs, and wings and evolved into a whole new kind of beast after one of the Js left their golden touch. (For example, follow the way industrial metal and ambient guitar drone got a facelift by Broadrick, or note the weird and wonderful cross-pollinations Jarboe crystallized from mixing cabaret, blues, and goth with electronica sounds.)</p><p>
    This pairing comes at an interesting juncture in both of their careers as both are possibly at their peak of recognition. For Broadrick, his brilliant Jesu project (a kind of epic and melodic, shoegaze-glazed Godflesh) has been like the elder master responding to the work of his students (primarily the whole Neurosis-Isis-Pelican post-rock metalgaze school) and in turn, blowing open the whole genre, yet again. Whereas with Jarboe, her Diamanda Galas–gone-(even more)-ballistic demon-diva thing has come home to roost among a new generation of extreme music lovers via her recent metal-related spin-offs: The last several years have found her involved with a Neurosis collaboration album, a band called Byla (featuring members of NYC-based prog/death bands Dysrhythmia and Behold...the Arctopus), a tag-team with black-metallers Cobalt, a guest video appearance with the Agony Scene, as well as loaned vocals for Tool's Maynard James Keenan–related projects A Perfect Circle and Puscifer. And there's more, but we still have a <em>new</em> album to talk about...</p><p>
    Sonically, <em>J2</em> sounds most like the terrain Jarboe has been exploring as a solo artist: dark electronica, laced, bound, and gagged with goth, psychedelia, and metal. Yet the seeds of this album were planted during the Jarboe-sung ""Storm Comin'"" from Jesu's recent <em>Lifeline</em> EP-- a dance-y, swirly, poppy track, perhaps even recorded during the same session as these. <em>J2</em> opener ""Decay"" begins with eerie, heavily effected Jarboe yodels with a spooky synth-bass churning underneath. Then you get blasted with that thunderous distorted bass-- also an echo of sorts, showing how Broadrick's grit-doom bass from the first few industrial-based Godflesh albums owed a ton (operative word meaning <em>heavy</em>) to the Swans' early nightmare stomps.
    </p>
<p>
    As to be expected, these six songs are packed with the signature components that make each artist so strong, but also included are their weaknesses: As ""Let Go"" and ""Magick Girl"" exemplify, sometimes the keyboard tones and drum machine choices that J &amp; J have <em>both</em> chosen over the years leave something to be desired-- sound choices that are often an overlooked mainstay of Jesu and most of Jarboe's solo output. If watery, cheesy keyboards, not-so present piano, and canned drums with tinny sampled cymbals don't bother you, then it's easily overlooked. But still, those songs also show off some individual genius: While Jarboe explores different voices colored with different expressions of fire and air, often repeating and slowly building, Broadrick drops in his stupidly/brilliantly primal guitar sludge. The rest of the album splits the difference between the two: the heavy keyboard trip-out of ""Romp"" (Jarboe) and the My Bloody Valentine dream-drone of ""Tribal Limo"" (Jesu), and then there's the more overtly electronica closer ""8mmsweetbitter"" sounding like Jarboe dancing along to one of Broadrick's <em>other</em> bands-- Techno Animal perhaps? An interesting meeting of minds with majestic moments, but unfortunately, like most big name pair ups, this EP sounds like it could've used more time to really pull from each artist's grandiosity. With luck, they'll do it all over again.

<em>On High</em> is Kate
    Maki's U.S.
    debut, but it's actually her third album. The Sudbury, Ontario-based singer-songwriter,
    whose folksy ruminations have earned her a following in her home country,
    released <em>Confusion Unlimited</em> in 2003
    and <em>The Sun Will Find Us</em> the next
    year, but neither is available south of the Canadian border. Shortly
    afterwards, she met Giant Sand frontman Howe Gelb and made a small appearance
    on his album <em>‘Sno Angel Like You</em> in
    2006. Ostensibly returning the favor plus heavy interest, Gelb signed Maki to
    his OW OM Recordings label, and co-produced her third album,<em> On High</em>, which was recorded in five
    days with a small band of friends. Gelb himself plays guitar on almost every
    song, and he even duets with her on ""Don't Look Down"".</p><p>
    Maki and Gelb make a fine match. Along with co-producer Dave
    Draves, he creates a dusty, twilit setting, full of junkyard guitars and
    ghost-town saloon pianos, and she settles in nicely, penning a collection of
    songs that use few words but are never simple. Maki, who teaches French and
    science when she's not touring, is rarely showy in her songwriting, and she can
    sell a song with only her voice and an acoustic guitar. ""Wanted Ads"" and ""We Are
    Gone"", two of the album's standouts, are delicate wisps of melody that
    would crumble under one more instrument. Occasionally Maki overreaches, as on
    the pseudo-philosophical ""Beyond the Sun"", and she can be cloyingly precious,
    as on ""Badminton Racquet"", a duet with Royal City's Nathan Lawr that sounds like a <em>Juno</em> outtake in the worst way: ""We keep
    together like a badminton racquet/ Bouncing little birdies everywhere."" Even
    when she strays, Maki's voice, which recalls early Suzanne Vega, remains
    delicate and invested with personality, often fading at the ends of words to
    intensify the sense of intimacy.</p><p>
    For better or worse, Gelb is just as formidable a presence
    on these songs as the woman whose name graces the album cover. He contributes
    some curious flourishes here and there, such as the ruptured electric guitar on
    ""Highway"" and the echoey old piano on ""White Noise"", which sounds like it's
    mic'ed on the floor to capture the workings of the pedals. Occasionally, he threatens
    to overshadow her, and <em>On High</em> begins
    to sound more like another Gelb project than a Kate Maki album. She sounds a
    little lost on the over-orchestrated ""Beyond the Sun"", which eventually
    descends into meandering piano and organ solos. But generally such
    inventiveness is welcome, especially when it results in a song like ""To Please"",
    which scrambles along on a modified jugband beat while Gelb and steel guitar
    player Dale Murray perform solos by blowing on bottles. It sounds completely
    different from anything on the album, yet its spiritedness sounds like the
    flipside of Maki's slow, sad songs, revealing her willingness to stray from the
    typical strictures of this brand of folksy roots music.

    Since Gnarls Barkley jumped into everyone's consciousness on the back of a single called ""Crazy"", would you forgive me the groaning joke if I said their follow-up sounded a little like someone prescribed mood stabilizers? That's the gripe you'll probably hear from most people: <em>The Odd Couple</em> is flatter, in both directions. The joy of this duo's debut was a kind of erratic, anything-goes lightning-bottling; its chintzy, slapdash qualities were more than made up for by the number of bottles containing honest-to-god scraps of actual lightning. Hit the big time on the strength of one of those, though, and the world has big-time demands. It was inevitable that these two would have to fight past their idiosyncrasies (producer Danger Mouse's short attention span, singer Cee-Lo's ease with throwing vocals together on the fly) and deliver something more focused, something that doesn't require so much sorting through. They've done that, to an extent-- not by any huge, transformative leap, but a little. And much like your average SSRI, it means less of the unpredictable magic and the sideways song-notions that sold the first album.</p><p>
    It'd be cruel and point-missing to pick on them for this-- as cruel as it'd be to tell your friends they're more ""fun"" when they're off their meds. More importantly, there are times, as DM's beats trail by in their muddy, tasteful way, where Cee-Lo sets to work developing something terrific, even if it's not the shiny pop thrill a lot of fans might want. What Cee-Lo seems to be after is a kind of restrained, gut-searching soul music, packed with even more self-doubt and self-laceration than the first record. Get over the lack of colorful pop baubles, and you'll notice that the best work here comes in the form of low-key cuts about isolation and uncertainty, like ""Who's Gonna Save My Soul"". Oddly enough, that means this album will be a grower-- dead opposite the flash and fade of that debut.</p><p>
    Danger Mouse, meanwhile, is tackling a different set of challenges. Somewhere between Outkast's ""Hey Ya"" and this group's ""Crazy"", the formula for success with this stuff became clear: Make hip-hop-styled music based around the sound of the 1960s-- the old soul music that's a common ancestor to nearly everything going today-- and you'll bring in fans from every direction. DM's taken that to heart here, and he keeps his beats warm and organic, with none of the futurism that came through on <em>St. Elsewhere</em>, and plenty of straight-up 60s grooves: ""Surprise"" drops in a vocal harmony that may well be sampled from the 5th Dimension, ""Going On"" works its organ and hand-claps, and ""Charity Case"" even has Cee-Lo recreating the ooh-aah backing vocals from Sam Cooke's ""Chain Gang"". Where the last album covered a 60s-styled track from the Violent Femmes, this one has Gnarls writing what <em>might as well</em> be one-- a great bratty thing called ""Whatever"", filled with half-mocking sympathy for the teenage loser pining for girls and yelling at his mom. 
    </p>
<p>
    But it's not always in the way you'd think; most of DM's warm, organic vibes here are dark, slow-creeping, blunted, psychedelic ones, and they don't stop him from trending left-field. (The shaky syncopations and grotty sound of ""Open Book"" could have come straight from Tricky.) In the end, that leaves the bouncy pop tracks here seeming like the odd ones out: This album might be more focused than its predecessor, but what it's focused on is a the kind of murky, paranoid weight and depth that doesn't much make for chart-climbing singles. Gnarls Barkley's combination-- an r&amp;b singer and an ""underground"" hip-hop producer (roughly)-- isn't so much of a novelty these days; it's essentially the same thing you'd get from Erykah Badu's newest album, a pretty apt peer for <em>The Odd Couple</em>. Listen to this album in that context, and you'll be a lot more likely to hear the progress they're making. The next pressing question, besides what we can do to help Cee-Lo cheer up, is this: If this is the album where we watch patiently as this duo develops its third dimension, what are the chances that these two guys-- who, unlike the average rock band, have plenty of other projects they could be off working on-- stick around to show us what their ""maturity"" might look like?

    Godspeed You! Black Emperor spawned numerous post-rock imitators, most playing rock-infused chamber music and looking to bridge the gap between whispers and roars. This is old news, but the career of Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band has been a crescendo itself. You can see it in the band's name, which began in 1999 as A Silver Mt. Zion, a trio comprised of Godspeed guitarist Efrim Menuck, violinist Sophie Trudeau, and bassist Thierry Amar (also of Godspeed). Over the course of several albums, ""Memorial Orchestra,"" ""Tra-La-La Band,"" ""with Choir,"" and an extra ""e"" were introduced, as the trio swelled to a septet with various auxiliary players.</p><p>
    This increase in personnel was reflected in the band's music. Their debut, the serene <em>He Has Left Us Alone But Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corners of Our Rooms</em>, was like Godspeed in miniature. Even on that album, vocals were featured prominently, which they rarely were in Godspeed. Their second album, <em>Born Into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward</em>, was still dominated by blustery strings, but Menuck's tomcat yowl and the flashes of rock were more pronounced. By this point, the band's anarchist bent was made clear in their terrorist-letter liner notes and the theory they cited, although their music still sounded more like an uneasy slumber than a violent insurrection.</p><p>
    Then Silver Mt. Zion made a definitive break with their origins and transformed into a band almost completely distinct from the one that made <em>Shafts of Light</em>. <em>""This Is Our Punk-Rock,"" Thee Rusted Satellites Gather + Sing</em> featured heavy rock drums and even more of Menuck's elongated, off-key moaning. The albums featuring the ""choir"" had a whole host of Menuck-alikes caterwauling away, and by 2005's <em>Horses in the Sky</em>, Silver Mt. Zion sounded more like an experimental rock band with strings than anything post-rock. 
    </p>
<p>
    New album <em>13 Blues for Thirteen Moons</em> is the weakest entry to date in Silver Mt. Zion's catalog. It gets off on the wrong foot with a conceit that seems pointless at best: Twelve tracks, each just a few seconds long, of high-pitched, modulating drones. Why? Maybe it was conceptually important to the band that the album begin on track 13, but there's nothing to suggest it should be important to anyone else. Of course, these drones would be inconsequential if they were a prelude to inspiring music, but their mysteriousness is the most interesting aspect of the record.
    </p>
<p>
    Here, strings have moved into the background and guitars into the foreground of Silver Mt. Zion's music, inverting their original template. They no longer erect shimmering palaces in the distance, preferring instead to drop the great marble slabs directly on our heads, over and over again. The song's artillery drums and napalm riffs sound exciting on paper, and there are indeed a few thrilling moments (swoony trumpets!), but the turgid arrangements, which lack enough content to justify their length (each is around a quarter-hour), reduce them to isolated moments that don't feel hard-earned when they arrive.
    </p>
<p>
    ""1,000,000 Died to Make this Sound"" begins and ends as a post-apocalyptic chorale, and while the moment when the bludgeoning riff that dominates its middle section roars to life is tingly, the feeling soon becomes a dull ache. The title track is more dynamically arranged, with swells of battery-acid guitar, but its rippling pattern makes it feel preordained, like Explosions in the Sky gone psych-rock. Nevertheless, the final movement, where Menuck's voice is chopped hard across stereo channels (lending it a rhythmic force it often lacks) is the album's most credible climax. The last two tracks are better: ""Black Waters Blowed/Engine Broke Blues"" makes room for gusty organ-and-string dirges amid the brambly rock, enhancing its contrast, and ""Blindblindblind"", with its gradual increase in wattage, exemplifies the kind of nuanced upsweep that most of the album unfortunately sacrifices.
    </p>
<p>
    Righteous anger is the emotion that dominates <em>13 Blues for Thirteen Moons</em>, leaving its listeners feeling rather scolded. When Menuck sings, ""One million died to make this sound,"" you get the impression that the romance of disaffection might be dearer to him than the social reforms that would mitigate it. When he sings about ""your band's bland ambition,"" you have to wonder if his self-regard has completed a crescendo of its own, one disproportionate to the actual political efficacy of his-- or anyone's-- music. Overall, it's this sense of forced importance that makes the album no fun: You feel like it's meant to do something <em>to</em> you, not <em>for</em> you. I don't know about you, but I've got more than enough tyrants and oligarchs talking down to me already, without getting browbeaten by anarchists, too.

    Don't freak, but the first thing that comes slithering out of the new Bauhaus record aren't ghoulish echoes from these goth godfather's past. Instead, on the album opener ""Too Much 21st Century"", a ""Taxman""-like bassline shepherds a procession of T. Rex guitars and lush Love &amp; Rockets–styled backing vocals. And herein suggests some of the challenges faced when a band with such a singular voice like Bauhaus takes 25 years to write its fifth studio album. Especially considering the many career <em>re</em>-defining moments between the final chapter-- when in 1983 these legendary post-punks threw in the towel (the first time) and eventually formed the two less-goth and more commercially successful acts, Love &amp; Rockets, and frontman Peter Murphy's solo work. A more recent epilogue-- a series of reunion tours-- eventually birthed this impressive and surprisingly true-to-form swan song.</p><p>
    Yes, sadly, this is the final (!) slab from these insanely influential art rockers, who managed to wield epic, moody masterpieces from such unlikely materials as glam, dub, punk, and funk. After more than two decades painting (primarily) pop songs with a different pallet, when they reconvene as Bauhaus they can't seem to shake the shapes and sounds they developed decades ago-- even if they're still filtered through the work of Love &amp; Rockets and Murphy solo. Tracks like the aforementioned opener, plus rockers ""Adrenalin"" and ""International Bulletproof Talent"", sound like the glam-side of Bauhaus-- complete with Murphy's Transylvanian Bowie vocals-- but re-worked with the Rockets' detached and breezy sensibility. Then there are tunes like ""Saved"", ""Zikir"", and ""Undone"" that feature a pronounced Murphy influence: synth-heavy Middle-Eastern–flirting drones and/or 80s-esque alterna-pop. Elsewhere, authentically retro numbers like ""Endless Summer of the Damned"" (an obvious shout out to goth nation) and ""Mirror Remains"" would've fit nicely either on <em>The Sky's Gone Out</em> or <em>Burning From the Inside</em>.</p><p>
    The real gems here, however, are the tunes that point to what Bauhaus could've become had they continued this comeback for another album or two. Both ""Black Stone Heart"" and ""The Dog's a Vapour""-- the latter was actually recorded back in 1998 during their initial reunion shows and previously featured on the soundtrack for the animated film sequel <em>Heavy Metal 2000</em>-- wheeze with brooding atmospherics and shine with a playful sense of experimentation. ""Black Stone"" melds dark and dancey rhythms and Murphy's novel multi-personality melodramatics with hand claps, whistling, and stilted piano while ""Vapour"" creeps around in the fog slowly building into ominous guitar sirens. Bauhaus can hold their head high, mission accomplished; but with no victory-lap tour, no more studio albums, and several awesome new tunes pointing at an un-actualized future, it all feels rather anti-climatic and lacking closure. One more time: Bauhaus are dead. Undead, undead, undead.

    A few years ago, when Kristin Gundred and John Paul Labno were jamming drummerless, the duo eschewed Craigslist-fishing for trap-work, and Gundred decided to hop behind the set herself.  For a band trying to make noise in a crowded field playing basic blues-based pop-rock, moving the attractive female lead behind the most cumbersome instrument around was a gamble to say the least, but a few years later, it's starting to pay off.  GOP's MySpace page fell under the sniffer of Rilo Kiley/the Elected's Blake Sennett, who saw potential enough to produce the trio's first full-length record <em>Humanimals</em>, as well as convince his manager Dave Holmes (who also handles Coldplay and Interpol), to release their debut on his DH Records.</p><p>
    Once writers got wind of them, comparisons between the GOP and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs came fast and furious.  At least superficially, there's something there: both are trios with a bold chick singer and two less-bold dudes, and both share a generalized orienting framework toward rock-- <em>Nuggets</em>-style blues-riff variations and howling female vocals.  What separates the GOP from the YYYs is evident in the former's moniker, really: Instead of lacquering on the gallery grime and experimenting with texture and meter, Grand Ole Party's fifth-generation blooze is as uncomplicated and artless as nickel beer night or a sweaty, jam-packed house party. A lyric from the surf-rock inflected ""Belle Isle"" should give a good-enough idea of GOP's M.O.: ""How can the young things keep at bay/ The dark shadows, if they can't drink them away?""</p><p>
    The San Diego trio is certainly self-aware, as well, and wears its starkness as honesty.  During the refrain of the call-to-arms ""Turn on, Burn on"", Gundred asks, ""Why can't we be simple, and enough to matter""?  There's not much new on <em>Humanimals</em>, but its simple, spacious throwback rock is rendered ingratiatingly, recalling the re-energized greaser rock of Mink Deville and Richard Hell, with occasional hints of a boiled-down Pretenders in the cooed background vocals of Labno and bassist Michael Krechnyak-- especially on the catchy choruses to ""Insane"", ""Redrum Heart"", and ""Dirty Spirit Rag"".  Lyrically, Gundred indexes the time-tested signifiers of rock-as-rebellion-for-lost-youth, her strained howl showing naïveté and toughness in equal parts.  <em>Humanimals</em>' brassy opener ""Look Out Young Son"" casts her as the ""bastard child"" of ""rough love and abandonment,"" and ""Bad, Bad Man"" is a lesson learned: another Little Red Riding Hood caveat against men who would ""lead you down temptation lane.""  As might be expected, Gundred occasionally veers off course from simple to simplistic, relying on moon-spoon-June rhyme schemes and iffy attempts at social comment.  The chorus of ""Nasty Habits"" tells us that they not only ""make us who we are,"" but also ""take us very far,"" and the more ham-handed, Hell-in-a-handbasket nihilism of ""Insane"" offers a take on this thing called ""reality television,"" which apparently isn't very ""realistic"" at all.  
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, however, it's not the lyrics that stop <em>Humanimals</em> from rising too far above pleasant pastiche.  Much more is GOP's resistance to doing what it seems built for: revving up to an explosion.  Gundred's singing voice has tons of energy, to be sure, but it needs to mature past the blues-rock mirror stage to push the band into its own space.  Sennett does a fine job of reining in Labno and Krechnyak to give the songs a sense of space and liveness, but I found myself on more than one occasion waiting for a big pop that never comes.  Like thousands of singers before her, Gundred tries to start some shit on ""Turn on, Burn on"", recommending, ""let's just start a fire."" Despite GOP's kinetic energy, however, <em>Humanimals </em>stays a collection of smoldering embers that never fully ignites.  <br/>

    The impending demise of <em>No Depression</em> magazine,
    brought on by declining ad revenues symptomatic of the music industry's
    general malaise, is undeniably sad. It likely didn't help matters that <em>ND</em> was a niche
    publication, and that its niche was alt-country, a genre whose hippest
    days are, at least for the time being, solely in its rearview.
    The height of alt-country's visibility and <em>No Depression</em>'s prominence
    coincided with the success of unpolished, deeply twangy throwbacks like
    Uncle Tupelo, Gillian Welch, and Whiskeytown. In recent years, however,
    the roots movement has cleaned up its act, and the emergence of
    competing rags like <em>Paste</em> and <em>Tracks</em> that lack <em>ND</em>'s gritty legacy
    points to a new landscape where safer, less-regionalist performers like
    Norah Jones and Josh Rouse hold greater sway.</p><p>
    Whether intentionally or
    not, Tift Merritt has managed some savvy positioning throughout this sea change. Merritt's 2002 debut, <em>Bramble Rose</em>,
    introduced the North Carolina native as one in a then-steady succession
    of insurgent sweethearts, alongside the likes of Kasey Chambers and
    Kathleen Edwards. As a Southern-bred critic's darling with a fragile,
    honeyed voice that brought to mind the irreproachable Emmylou Harris,
    it seemed fated that Merritt's fortunes would be tied to
    alt-country's as a whole. However, as the genre's trendy cachet began
    to erode, Merritt herself started moving away from those dirt-road
    influences and towards a more MOR, pop-flavored take on roots, namely the
    laidback stylings of Bonnie Raitt or Carole King. The
    shift was already evident in 2004's <em>Tambourine</em> (ironically
    nominated for a Grammy for Best Country Album), and is only further
    crystallized by Merritt's newest record, <em>Another Country</em> (its title, of
    course, representing another irony). Time will tell whether Merritt's
    artistic adjustments will make business sense (<em>Tambourine</em> barely
    outsold its predecessor), but what's more important is whether
    distancing herself from <em>No Depression</em> tropes has made Merritt a better
    or a poorer artist. At first glance I'm inclined to say it's a boon,
    recognizing that alt-country is an enticing trap most of its greatest
    practitioners (Ryan Adams, Lucinda Williams, Jeff Tweedy) eventually freed themselves from, to at least some degree.</p><p>
    Then again, results speak for themselves, and <em>Another Country</em> just
    isn't nearly as consistently satisfying as Merritt's earlier offerings.
    Her voice is still the same willowy, sigh-inducing instrument, and it
    shines as ever on ""Hopes Too High"" and the admittedly powerful title
    track, both of which nonetheless move with the same kind of pleasantly
    distracted amble that tows most of Merritt's compositions. A little
    juice is typically a solid cure for lazily shuffling ingenues, but the
    jauntier likes of ""My Heart is Free"" and the horn-aided ""Tell Me
    Something True"" actually squash the melodic effects that go a long way
    towards redeeming her songwriting. At least until a line like ""start
    revolutions with a glint in your eye"" jumps out and makes you wince a
    little.
    </p>
<p>
    Regarding what I suggested above about alt-country's enticements, I
    really do believe that a little pedal steel can cover up a multitude of
    sins. I wouldn't go so far as to call Merritt's initial recordings a
    smoke-and-mirrors act-- something else besides dirt was under her
    fingernails then, something that's been lost in her subtle-but-definite
    folk-pop reinvention. But will she have to return to a genre struggling
    to put even its niche status on steady legs in order to recover it?

He yelps that bit here on a, um, <em>repeat</em> performance of a track from the Swan Lake album, which you will remember, because the next line is, ""Saw you in Swan Lake."" The vibe of this moment hews close to the one conveyed by Destroyer labelmate, hero, and fellow English-accent-faker Robert Pollard on Guided By Voices' ""The Official Ironmen Rally Song"" back in 1996: ""Crawling people on your knees/ Don't take this so seriously/ You just have to hum it all day long.""  (Except, well, Bejar even hums seriously.)</p><p>
    In 1996, GBV were where Destroyer is today: facing a not-quite-backlash because the act's longevity had begun to work against the initial reasons for fan excitement-- what were once singular eccentricities now have become anticipatable. Through some kind of consumer transference, the audience, having seen the magician do its favorite trick so many times, convinces itself that it has actually gone backstage.  That most Destroyer listeners could likely pen and perform a decent Destroyer spoof is the reason some now (via projection) accuse Bejar of parodying himself, just as folks used to act like they had Pollard's genius ""figured out"" because they could joke, ""Alright kids, this one's called 'Logo Manchild Umbrage Saloon' off our new EP, <em>Sanguine Flake Emperor</em>! One, two, three, four--""</p><p>
    Mockery usually lacks its target's magic, though, and Bejar is pretty much an untouchable wizard. <em>Trouble in Dreams</em> succeeds despite itself, despite contemporary tastes, and despite the cynicism its grandiosity triggers in us breathing, farting pedestrian mortals. Anyway, one can't be embarrassed for Bejar re: this album's hyperdramatic wince-worthy turns-- or an uptick in his nonsense-syllable scatting thing-- because he clearly does not care what we ""think."" He's so dedicated to his unbearable fringes that he sells them-- like the kid from junior high so unconcerned with cool that he had to settle for being totally fucking awesome.
    </p><p>
    Not that Destroyer doesn't try to have it both ways: The risky, invested intensity of the delivery, leavened with the detachment of it not being so gauche as to specifically mean anything. What a <em>performance</em> the whole album is<em>.</em> The vocal inflections, the real words, the nonwords, the handclaps, the whistling, the guitars, keys, drums, tempos, and spaces combine to create not so much a sound as a (gulp) spirit. Spirit is another word, of course, for alcoholic beverage, and <em>Trouble in Dreams</em> is shitfaced, from the leery cover's stash of bottles to the wine, sherry, drugs, drunkenness, and high-ness referenced inside. For all the music's deliberate flailing, the speaker lacks agency-- he wanders around not knowing what time it is (""Foam Hands"") in disbelief at decibel levels (""Plaza Trinidad"").  The most rousing, antic, and fun number, ""Dark Leaves Form a Thread"", is about terror, depression, abandonment, and waitress fatigue. The closing track, a coherent (for Destroyer) character study about the ominous redemption of a ""wasted"" ""boozing"" woman who's ""been fucking around,"" suggests a Bejar strutting and fretting his way onto the Hold Steady's stage.
    </p>
<p>
    Revisitations abound. In addition to the Swan Lake do-over, a verse from a song Bejar did to accompany a 2005 children's book pops up in a decidedly adult context. The guitars continue Destroyer's blend of geek-rock and classic rock, ranging in the same tune from stately to anti-subtle, like an XTC Skynyrd with pinches of Marr and Malkmus sautéed in Beatles and Bowie. The hotfoot confidence of a certain recent celebrated Destroyer album gets paired with the disheveled sprawl of another-- if only Pitchfork would pay me for a three-word review, I could have just typed: <em>This Night's Rubies</em>. Which is to say that <em>Trouble in Dreams</em> offers all the hookiness of pop with none of the concision.

    For a recombinatory effort, though, some elements are missing. <em>TID</em> might be Bejar's most pompous, profane, and pastoral record, but it's also his least ""intelligent,"" rational, or linearly clever. Bejar denies fans old modes of dorksport:  I caught only one pun, two snippets of others' famous lyrics, and two references to other bands. Plus ""Introducing Angels"" just sounds like Air Supply.  And part of me buys the argument that this is the rock equivalent of <em>Mars Attacks</em>, going through the motions of creating a blockbuster without allowing the audience a legitimate ""in."" At first listen, the album seemed long because something was running a little lean. I thought I'd gone from the enjoyable thrill of wondering what Bejar was talking about to the jaded position of not caring. But after multiple spins, I'm confusingly seduced by the vermouth-versus-absinthe reverie of its arrangements, pronouncements, and elliptical solos. Here's a guy fussily throwing his whole soul into his camouflage.</div>"|11327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11327-trouble-in-dreams/|7.7|William Bowers

There's the name, for one thing: a question whose only tempting reply is an exaggerated shrug. But at least ask yourself what kind of sonics might fit that name. Howling batteries of unreconstructed noise? Try again. High-strung mall-emo with serious entitlement issues? If only. Barely adequate dance-rock to keep you occupied until the next Klaxons record? Now we're talking!</p><p>
    As this album trundles on, its title turns unpleasantly sarcastic. Any one of these tracks will give you a very strong idea what you've gotten yourself into, and that'll be the only strong idea you meet. Does It Offend You, Yeah? play doggedly ugly, riff-driven electro. Their harsh, crunching keyboards might sound raw and immediate, if it wasn't for the way the hooks slide out your brain so fast. Their ranting vocals might seem confrontational, but they're autotuned so often they feel diffident and defensive. Their beats might be so propulsive as to make all that irrelevant-- except all the band's rhythmic ideas are stuck a decade ago, like they've bought up some old Chemical Brothers kit on eBay and haven't read the manual yet.</p><p>
    So this record's creative and artistic value is pretty much nil-- in fact it only just hits competent. But that's OK-- I don't get the feeling the band are shooting for ""art"" anyway, and competent music can still be functional music: a good accompaniment to more exciting activities. Does It Offend You, Yeah? have already licensed songs to the FIFA Street 3 game, for instance: I can imagine the yelpy ""Battle Royale"" sounding fine if half-heard while doing digital ball-juggling.  </p><p>
    Other songs will also have their uses. It's probably a bit stale for advertising, but the tolerably aggressive ""We Are Rockstars"" might work over a montage of camphone footage in a sales presentation. Partygoers throughout 2008 may wake up grateful the band wrote a song called ""Let's Make Out"" so they could burp the title into someone's ear. The best track, which for two minutes does recapture Klaxons' playful frenzy, could be great on a sweaty college dancefloor. It is still called ""Attack of the 60 Ft Lesbian Octopus"", but you have to start somewhere. </p><p>
    The closing songs do find the group stretching themselves a little more-- ""Epic Last Song"" and ""Being Bad Feels Pretty Good"" lose the electro-vox and go for something a little slower and a lot more pained. To no great surprise, when they drop the nu-rave trappings the band fit perfectly into a long-shuffling queue of British plod-rock, somewhere between Shed Seven and Gay Dad.  </p><p>
    But the thing about offending people is that you can nearly always find someone to take the bait. In the band's own world, Does It Offend You, Yeah? are electro punks with nostalgia in their sights: They talk in interviews about how old-school ravers are disgusted by their rock sounds and instrument-smashing stageplay. I suppose it's possible-- maybe they're just rightly pissed at the band's tired ideas and terminal complacency.</p></div>"|11291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11291-you-have-no-idea-what-you-are-getting-yourself-into/|2.3|Tom Ewing

    Murderer, arsonist, racist-- Varg Vikernes is all these and more. Yet his most enduring legacy isn't the corpse of Euronymous, his band mate in Mayhem, whom he stabbed to death; nor the ashes of the Norwegian churches he was convicted of torching; nor his rambling writings on race and nationalism that have led weaker minds to tie Nazism to black metal. Vikernes will live on longest with Burzum, his one-man band that redefined black metal's parameters.</p><p>
    Burzum made black metal an open system. No longer was the music just a blastbeat-driven blur. Burzum slowed it down, bent it into strange angles, and pushed and pulled them into long, exploratory tracks. Denied a guitar while incarcerated, Vikernes turned Burzum towards keyboard-based ambience with wispy, faux-classical melodies. The astral synths of ""Rundtgåing Av Den Transcendentale Egenbetens Støtte"", from 1996's <em>Filosofem</em>, could have been on Warp. Freed from strictures like bandmates and song structures, lone wolves the world over have explored Burzum's template. To name but a few-- Leviathan, Krohm (USA), Nortt (Denmark), Hypothermia (Sweden), Elysian Blaze (Australia), and Taarma (Afghanistan). (Ironically, the most prominent of Burzum's progeny, Xasthur, has developed such a defined sound that it's become a closed system.)</p><p>
    Buffalo, New York's Wrath of the Weak is a worthy, if unlikely, addition to Burzum's brood. The few pictures that exist of ""Jordan,"" the band's mastermind, are startling-- a kid with glasses and a baseball cap, jeans, and sneakers. He should be strumming in coffeehouses, not unleashing feedback-soaked dirges that update Creation Records with corpse paint. 
    </p>
<p>
    Much has been made of black metal's connection to shoegaze. Both prize texture over definition, and transcendence through fuzz. While Enslaved occasionally evoke a ballsier Swervedriver, Wrath of the Weak pins that band's abstract emotion in the red. <em>Alogon</em> chains together digital distortion into scathing sheets of sound, recalling early Jesus and Mary Chain. The core sound is thin, but multiplied in layers of noise and harmonics, it becomes torrential. Yet the muck is surprisingly easy to penetrate. The chords are hardly metallic in the conventional sense. No macho machine-gun riffs here, just smears of melancholy. 
    </p>
<p>
    This record armors a very vulnerable center. The vocals hide behind distortion and reduce to strangled cries in the distance. Like with My Bloody Valentine, they're simply another texture. However, they're so sparse that the record is essentially instrumental. In their fearsome fragility, the guitars go far, becoming hypnotic through repetition. After too long, though, they become repetitious. More, and stronger, vocals might help. Unlike Xasthur, who's mired in a self-created miasma, Wrath of the Weak might have something to say.
    </p>
<p>
    But even Burzum was a perpetual work-in-progress, and not all brilliant. That happens when one breaks old rules to make new ones. <em>Alogon</em>'s greatest misstep is its most blatant Burzum worship: a 21-minute ambient snoozefest. Otherwise, it's a diamond in the rough. Its obscuring is sublime; its unveiling might be more so.

It's a bit of a mischaracterization even when you account for the fact that the last Comets record, <em>Avatar</em>, made such strident moves toward that same mix that Howlin Rain became all but superfluous. The issue, more so, is that on their second album, <em>Magnificent Fiend</em>, Howlin Rain make absolutely no attempt to incorporate Miller's sturdy noise background into their tracks, unless you count mixing the organ so high that the songs take on a hallucinatory vibe that was not, in all likelihood, intentional.  Instead, the aim was admittedly to complicate Miller's songwriting via layers of classic rock filament.</p><p>
    What's left is an album heavy on signifiers, even in comparison with Howlin Rain's eponymous 2006 debut. Howlin Rain are from San Francisco and have some beards so they'll be compared to The Grateful Dead; Howlin Rain are from California and most of their songs have thick, muddy grooves so they will be compared to Creedence Clearwater Revival. But in terms of both sound and execution Howlin Rain share more with, say, the Faces, at least in so much as Miller, like Rod Stewart, is less interested in crafting perfect melodies as he is in doing some hollerin' and yellerin' on the same stage as four or five of his boys, one of whom goes sort of nuts on an organ.</p><p>
    Ethan Miller doesn't have Stewart's hilarious foxiness; hell, he may not even have the panache and flair of 2006 Ethan Miller-- something ""Calling Lightning Pt. 2"" goes (literally) lengths to illustrate.  ""Calling Lightning with a Scythe"" was the finest, Dead-iest track on the band's debut, featuring a mélange of strummed acoustics, banjo, and wonderfully confused electric gnashing. Miller reached for his sweetest, stoned-est falsetto and shyly navigated his way through the band's bushy terrain. A side-by-side comparison of ""Calling Lightning"" and ""Pt. 2"" highlights most of <em>Magnificent Fiend</em>'s shortcomings: the latter is obnoxiously full of big, beefy rock sounds-- tube amps, Hammond organs, a Rhodes piano solo-- so familiar that they are nearly impossible to differentiate. Miller drones about ""distant youth"" and being a ""hard-workin' stiff.""  Something about the ""Golden Age."" </p><p>
    Call it a period piece if you must, but <em>Magnificent Fiend</em> doesn't hold up there, either: ""Lord Have Mercy"" might've been a higher fidelity cousin to Built to Spill's spectacularly referential ""You Were Right""-- ""That was the dawning of the age…"", ""Down by the river,"" etc.-- but it's telling that Miller manages to sink a song already leaning on homage with cliché: his churchy choruses have enough ""Mama have mercy on my soul""'s to stuff even the campiest appetites.  </p><p>
    It's not until <em>Magnificent Fiend</em>'s closing trio of seven-minute behemoths that Howlin Rain find traction, though it's the band's willingness to tweak its grand appropriations, rather than the tracks' epic lengths, that helps the songs stick. ""El Rey"" finds Miller, for the first time, curling his voice around a chorus before attacking it, and the brass that backs him contributes in making it the most sprightly and limber track on <em>Magnificent Fiend</em>. ""Goodbye Ruby"" succumbs to funk in a way that allows Joel Robinow's organ to bounce instead of splat. ""Riverboat"" succeeds further, building towards a sweetened piano coda with-- surprise!-- a hearty, cheesy synth that aims, if not for ELO, at least for Yes. These triumphs, however, don't overpower the album's tepid overflow. Of all the rock stereotypes adopted, the one that ultimately damns Howlin Rain is extra-musical: a big, technically skilled band with good vibes but nowhere to go.  <br/></p></div>"|11304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11304-magnificent-fiend/|6.0|Andrew Gaerig

    There's a moment toward the end of ""Hometown Hooray""-- from <em>Phylactery Factory</em>, Casey Dienel's debut
    as White Hinterland-- that reveals her range and potential impact under this
    new moniker. The song begins as a breezy ditty, with a girl, Dienel's narrator,
    carving her lover's name into the trunk of a cypress. He leaves for war and, of
    course, doesn't return, inspiring the townsfolk to tie yellow ribbons around every
    tree in the typical patriotic memorial. Seeing this marker over his name,
    Dienel sings, ""I rip that ribbon off the tree, burn it down by the river that
    now shares your name."" It's a startling, simple, and poetically defiant act,
    neatly and decisively wiping away the politics and statistics to find the human
    being. ""No one wants to believe you died in vain,"" Dienel concludes, as her
    piano returns to that original breezy theme: There is a bittersweet freedom,
    she discovers, in accepting the meaninglessness of the tragedy.</p><p>
<em>Phylactery Factory</em>
    is Dienel's follow-up to her 2006 debut, <em>The
    Wind-Up Canary,</em> a loose collection of quirky pop songs delivered with a
    light touch-- always an underrated quality. Since then, she has signed to a new
    label, adopted a new stage name (but why not something that doesn't sound like
    a death metal band?), and assembled an impressive backing band that features
    Laura Gibson and members of Norfolk &amp; Western. Nevertheless, White
    Hinterland remains essentially a solo project that showcases Dienel's songwriting
    and vocals, and <em>Phylactery Factory</em> is
    a more ambitious, more professional, and more complicated record than its
    predecessor, with dark jazz-pop flourishes and compositions heavy with words. It
    is, however, not quite as rewarding.</p><p>
    After the seven-minute ""Hometown Hooray"", which is heartbreaking
    despite her self-consciously Homeric affectations, comes ""Lindberghs + Metal
    Birds"", with its bouncing bassline from the Village Green's Dave Depper and an
    energetic performance from Dienel. It's a perfectly acceptable, if somewhat
    self-satisfied, anti-military/industrial/what-have-you anthem, but on <em>Phylactery Factory</em> it completely ruins
    the solemn tone of the song that came before. More than a mistake of
    sequencing, this abrupt transition reveals Dienel's divided interests with this
    new project. She has one foot in the real world, with its insoluble tragedies,
    and the other foot in her own private imaginarium, with its eccentric wordplay
    and clever anachronisms. 
    </p>
<p>
    Given that a whole arm of indie pop seems devoted to
    storybook lyricism, this could be an intriguing stance, but Dienel's mix of
    willed naïvete and kneejerk cynicism creates some jarring shifts on <em>Phylactery
    Factory</em>, muddying instead of illuminating her songs. Occasionally, but not
    often enough, the force of the music compensates. ""Napoleon at Waterloo"",
    the album's most uptempo song, rounds out the wartime trilogy, disconnected
    from the present but still worth it for its spiraling momentum and Dienel's
    spirited, even angry repetition of ""There goes another man down."" Likewise,
    ""Dreaming of the Plum Trees"", about vast class discrepancies, alludes slyly to
    Suzanne Vega's ""Luka"" and Paul Simon's ""Me &amp; Julio Down by the Schoolyard"".
    But mostly, her wordy compositions make for dense, leaden songs like opener
    ""The Destruction of the Art Deco House"" and ""Hung on a Thin Thread"", which move
    slowly and sometimes not at all. Ultimately, what was intended as an ambitious
    artistic leap forward feels more like a slight step to the side.

Which is as it should be, because their music, a singular mix of complexity and immediacy, deserves its own notch on any post-punk measuring stick. Though popular in their hometown of Boston, they weren't really part of a scene. And though their early 1980s music overlapped with the bass-driven post-punk of Joy Division and PiL, the heroic hardcore of Black Flag and Hüsker Dü, and even the contrarianism of New York No Wave, it mostly sounded like nothing else. Twenty-five years later, Mission of Burma's fusion of brainy experiments and anthemic rock remains unique.</p><p>
    That's due in part to how unique the recordings actually were. Where most indie bands at the time recorded in less-than-ideal circumstances, Mission of Burma were supported by Boston label Ace of Hearts, whose owner Rick Harte produced them with meticulous precision. For these three Matador reissues, Harte himself re-mastered the original analog tapes. The resulting clarity adds power to songs that have reverberated loudly through alternative rock for three decades, influencing everyone from R.E.M. to Fugazi to Nirvana. Ironically, these recordings were somewhat misrepresentative, as Harte's production cleaned up the band's brutally-loud live sound. But that's why ""Academy Fight Song"" and ""That's When I Reach For My Revolver"" were instant post-punk classics. As guitarist Roger Miller explains in his notes, ""Revolver"" came out ""much milder than we thought it should be...[and] that probably helped it become as big of a 'hit' as it was.""</p><p>
    Burma formed in the late 70s after Miller and bassist Clint Conley left Boston group Moving Parts, recruiting Peter Prescott to play drums and Martin Swope to add tape loops. Miller and Swope had backgrounds in avant-garde music, but the band was equally interested in rocking out (Conley and Miller bonded initially over a love of the Ramones). This dichotomy is encapsulated by ""Max Ernst"", the B-side to their first release, the ""Academy Fight Song"" 7"". The band swerves seamlessly from chugging beat and jangly guitar to off-key chords and off-kilter rhythms, ending with a chant of ""Dada!"" that's both goofily artsy and seriously infectious. That 7"" opens Matador's reissue of the band's second release, the <em>Signals, Calls, and Marches</em> EP. From the spine-stiffening ""This is Not a Photograph"" to the post-rock-presaging ""All World Cowboy Romance"", this CD is impeccable. Even two new cuts, instrumental tracks from 1981 to which the band added vocals and guitars last year, are forcefully memorable. Add a DVD of two stunning shows (the black and white multi-camera shoot from a 1980 set at Boston's Underground is almost too good to be true), and this is probably the best Mission of Burma release ever. </p><p>
    The two other Matador reissues are nearly as essential. <em>Vs.</em>, the band's sole full-length, sees them stretching their sound without overreaching. There are more anthemic gems, like the Modern Lovers-in-a-blender ""Ballad of Johnny Burma"" and the frantic ""That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate"". But there is also a moody Joy Division-ish exploration (""Train""), chiming meditations (""Dead Pool"", ""Einstein's Day""), and a dissonant stomp (""New Nails"") that predicts Sonic Youth's marriage of Glenn Branca and the Ramones. <em>The Horrible Truth About Burma</em> was a posthumous live release, its title a reference to the group's unruly concert sound. Live, Swope often recorded the band and looped them back through the PA, so that the musicians didn't know exactly what the audience was hearing. This album has been faulted for its sonic clutter, but its raw energy is fascinating, especially in covers of the Stooges' ""1970"" and Pere Ubu's ""Heart of Darkness"", as well as a version of ""Peking Spring"", an early fan favorite Burma never recorded for Ace of Hearts because they had already tired of it by the time of their debut single.</p><p>
    Both <em>Vs.</em> and <em>Horrible Truth</em> include bonus material, most of which has been released in some form before. So, aside from excellent re-mastering, their main attractions are their companion DVDs, offering two sets from the band's final Boston show in 1983 (originally available as an abridged VHS on Atavistic). Though not as visually enticing as the <em>Signals </em>DVD, the footage is still invaluable, if only as a document of Burma's enthusiastic hometown following. Conley, Prescott, and Miller (clad in ear-protecting headgear due to a case of tinnitus that would ultimately cause the band's demise) perform in workmanlike fashion, unfazed by the ecstatic bodies that flail past them. It's an apt visual metaphor for their place in history: As trends have flown by, Mission of Burma's music has held firm, unaffected by fashion, unsullied by imitation, and undiminished by the passage of time.</p></div>"|11662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11662-signals-calls-and-marchesvsthe-horrible-truth-about-burma/|9.8|Marc Masters

And though their early 1980s music overlapped with the bass-driven post-punk of Joy Division and PiL, the heroic hardcore of Black Flag and Hüsker Dü, and even the contrarianism of New York No Wave, it mostly sounded like nothing else. Twenty-five years later, Mission of Burma's fusion of brainy experiments and anthemic rock remains unique.</p><p>
    That's due in part to how unique the recordings actually were. Where most indie bands at the time recorded in less-than-ideal circumstances, Mission of Burma were supported by Boston label Ace of Hearts, whose owner Rick Harte produced them with meticulous precision. For these three Matador reissues, Harte himself re-mastered the original analog tapes. The resulting clarity adds power to songs that have reverberated loudly through alternative rock for three decades, influencing everyone from R.E.M. to Fugazi to Nirvana. Ironically, these recordings were somewhat misrepresentative, as Harte's production cleaned up the band's brutally-loud live sound. But that's why ""Academy Fight Song"" and ""That's When I Reach For My Revolver"" were instant post-punk classics. As guitarist Roger Miller explains in his notes, ""Revolver"" came out ""much milder than we thought it should be...[and] that probably helped it become as big of a 'hit' as it was.""</p><p>
    Burma formed in the late 70s after Miller and bassist Clint Conley left Boston group Moving Parts, recruiting Peter Prescott to play drums and Martin Swope to add tape loops. Miller and Swope had backgrounds in avant-garde music, but the band was equally interested in rocking out (Conley and Miller bonded initially over a love of the Ramones). This dichotomy is encapsulated by ""Max Ernst"", the B-side to their first release, the ""Academy Fight Song"" 7"". The band swerves seamlessly from chugging beat and jangly guitar to off-key chords and off-kilter rhythms, ending with a chant of ""Dada!"" that's both goofily artsy and seriously infectious. That 7"" opens Matador's reissue of the band's second release, the <em>Signals, Calls, and Marches</em> EP. From the spine-stiffening ""This is Not a Photograph"" to the post-rock-presaging ""All World Cowboy Romance"", this CD is impeccable. Even two new cuts, instrumental tracks from 1981 to which the band added vocals and guitars last year, are forcefully memorable. Add a DVD of two stunning shows (the black and white multi-camera shoot from a 1980 set at Boston's Underground is almost too good to be true), and this is probably the best Mission of Burma release ever. </p><p>
    The two other Matador reissues are nearly as essential. <em>Vs.</em>, the band's sole full-length, sees them stretching their sound without overreaching. There are more anthemic gems, like the Modern Lovers-in-a-blender ""Ballad of Johnny Burma"" and the frantic ""That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate"". But there is also a moody Joy Division-ish exploration (""Train""), chiming meditations (""Dead Pool"", ""Einstein's Day""), and a dissonant stomp (""New Nails"") that predicts Sonic Youth's marriage of Glenn Branca and the Ramones. <em>The Horrible Truth About Burma</em> was a posthumous live release, its title a reference to the group's unruly concert sound. Live, Swope often recorded the band and looped them back through the PA, so that the musicians didn't know exactly what the audience was hearing. This album has been faulted for its sonic clutter, but its raw energy is fascinating, especially in covers of the Stooges' ""1970"" and Pere Ubu's ""Heart of Darkness"", as well as a version of ""Peking Spring"", an early fan favorite Burma never recorded for Ace of Hearts because they had already tired of it by the time of their debut single.</p><p>
    Both <em>Vs.</em> and <em>Horrible Truth</em> include bonus material, most of which has been released in some form before. So, aside from excellent re-mastering, their main attractions are their companion DVDs, offering two sets from the band's final Boston show in 1983 (originally available as an abridged VHS on Atavistic). Though not as visually enticing as the <em>Signals </em>DVD, the footage is still invaluable, if only as a document of Burma's enthusiastic hometown following. Conley, Prescott, and Miller (clad in ear-protecting headgear due to a case of tinnitus that would ultimately cause the band's demise) perform in workmanlike fashion, unfazed by the ecstatic bodies that flail past them. It's an apt visual metaphor for their place in history: As trends have flown by, Mission of Burma's music has held firm, unaffected by fashion, unsullied by imitation, and undiminished by the passage of time.</p></div>"|11662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11662-signals-calls-and-marchesvsthe-horrible-truth-about-burma/|8.0|Marc Masters

Sure, the last two Low albums had downright loud moments, and there's that bluesy side project the Black Eyed Snakes that Sparhawk had a few years back. But on the Retribution Gospel Choir album, the dude channels his inner Crazy Horse with dark dirge-y anthems. He even curses and stuff!</p><p>
    It's taken Retribution a few years to make a full-length; the group's been around since 2005 and have released two tour EPs. Eric Pollard plays drums and new guy (in this band as well as Low) Matt Livingston plays bass, while Sparhawk plays guitar and sings, and he wrote the songs, too. Three aspects of the group's live shows and EPs are missing on their debut. First and foremost, there's singer-songwriter Mark Kozelek, who did produce the record, and it's on his label. But Kozelek was once a member of the band, and his guitar playing is missed (as are a few songs they played with him, notably the great ""Hatchet"").</p><p>
    Not missed so much are the group's penchant for cool covers (though two songs-- ""Breaker"" and ""Take Your Time""-- could be called self-covers, as they have already appeared on the last Low record). Sure their live take on ""Sandinista"" is great, but the covers felt like concert or B-side material, so it's good that they realized that. Finally, the group's experimental and dubby aspects are relegated to subtle sound effect elements. That's made the album more cohesive but less diverse than their music is live.</p><p>
    Sparhawk knows how to wring emotional depth out of the most tired lyrical clichés, and he's clearly dissected rock dynamics to the point that when he does them ""straight"" it's either boring (as on ""They Knew You Well"") or something to behold (""Easy Prey"", ""Somebody's Someone""). Songs like ""Holes in Our Heads"" and ""Take Your Time"" are dynamic in a loud/louder/soft/loudest way that works well in service of decent songs and melodies. (By now, Mogwai and Sigur Rós devotees have copied those tricks to death-- contemporary math rock is so simple it may as well be called subtraction rock.)</p><p>
    Entire swaths of the Retribution Gospel Choir album are reminiscent of the slash-and-burn imitation classic rock found on the Bush League All Stars' 1995 Pop Narcotic album <em>Old Numbers</em> (albeit with odder tunings). At the time, that fine album sank like a stone in the indie music scene; RGC arrives after a decade's worth of stoner metal has convinced kids it's OK to enjoy back-to-basics riff-heavy rock'n'roll-- even without the irony that was so heavily drizzled atop 80s and 90s revisionings of 70s conventions. To address the album on 70s turf, <em>Retribution Gospel Choir</em> may not be as great as a Neil Young with Crazy Horse album, but it's better than any of the albums Crazy Horse made on their own.</p></div>"|11317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11317-retribution-gospel-choir/|7.5|Mike McGonigal

    little movie about a pregnant teen, the Moldy Peaches can now count 
    Whoopi Goldberg and my 57-year-old mother amongst their fans. That's 
    great news for erstwhile Peach Adam Green, who, with his fifth solo 
    album, has finally created a collection that's ready for mass-consumption. 
    The prolific, potty-mouthed former anti-folkie was an acquired taste 
    back when he was singing naughty throwaways like, ""Choke on a Cock"", 
    but following in the footsteps of <em>Jacket Full of Danger</em>'s pretty 
    (if slightly corny) soft-rockers, he offers more palatable, grown-up 
    fare on<em> Sixes &amp; Sevens</em>.</p><p>
    Green has long possessed a 
    mature voice-even in his faux-naif, Robin-Hood-costume days, his resonant 
    baritone was startlingly emotive-and, finally, his songs are worthy 
    of his warm, velvety delivery. ""Getting Led"", for example, 
    bolsters his buttery tones with the sweet levity of a gospel choir, 
    showing off a developed croon that's as richly colored and evocative 
    as Elvis'.</p><p>
    Thanks to legendary arranger 
    David Campbell-- he's worked with fellow lounge-loving singer, Beck-- Green's often squirrelly songs are now filled out by swooning 
    orchestrations of wistful pedal steel, soaring strings, and (as on ""You 
    Get So Lucky"", his dusty, pan-Latin homage to Simon And Garfunkel's 
    ""El Condor Pasa"") even some wily pan pipes. And though on previous 
    albums, Green's ornate orchestrations often read as winking hipster 
    re-imaginings of schmaltzy easy listening, the 70s radio that he and 
    Campbell evoke here has a playlist that's part 60s hangover (wall-of-sound 
    album opener ""Festival Song""), part swaggering disco-funk 
    (""Tweet Tweet Dee""), and part sax-fueled Bowie ""plastic 
    soul"" (""Morning After Midnight""). Straddling a precarious 
    line between ""classic"" and ""cheesy,"" Green sounds most assured 
    and comfortable against those sorts of vintage arrangements.
    </p><p>
    But listeners 
    looking for lyrical meaning will still be disappointed, searching in 
    vain for hidden significance in these nonsensical love song lines. (Though 
    Green insists his prose isn't the product of any cut-and-paste or 
    stream-of-consciousness method, with lines like, ""I finally grew 
    a leg in Thailand/Marauding on a typhus flu,"" they might as well 
    be.) A word of advice: It's best to just accept his words as conduits 
    for his dreamy voice, and give in to his charming tunes. The best ones-- like 
    ""Tropical Island"" (which is, strangely, about smoggy Los Angeles) 
    and ""Be My Man"", an acoustic country-folk riff on ""Sweet Jane""-- are 
    built on such appealing pop melodies that their lyrics feel unimportant 
    anyway. 
    </p>
<p>
    They aren't all winners though. 
    ""That Sounds Like a Pony"" features the kind of rhythm-driven, 
    unfunny ""rapping"" that the Peaches did back in the day on 
    ""D.2 Boyfriend"", and the gimmick was already moldy then. And 
    the vaudevillian Leon Redbone paean ""Grandma Shirley And Papa"" 
    feels like a half-hearted genre exercise in the company of the album's 
    more straightforwardly pretty songs. But in an era where a 10-song record 
    is basically one or two iTunes-ready singles cushioned by some extraneous 
    fat, this ambitious 20-song opus is, percentage-wise, a success.  <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Reinvention isn't easy, especially 
    when your past work is newly popular. But Adam Green has managed it, 
    embracing sincerity and musical extravagance in a way that ""Anyone 
    Else But You"" never intimated was possible. Whoopi and my mom will 
    be pleased.

Certainly, there was enough Blue Cheer riffing and 1960s gloom on the band's self-titled debut to cast them as convincing nu-stoner attachés. But when their beefier brethren straight-copped Tony Iommi doom and dingy Horsemen thrash, these Portland space cadets were accentuating druggy astro-rock with slightly more obscure cues. Think Hawkwind instead of High on Fire, Magma rather than Maiden.</p><p>
    But the wire-crossing of prog, glam, and academic metal only worked in spells in '06. They peaked early on the UFO dragstrip ride of <em>Invaders</em> stand-out  ""By the Mark"", but Danava never really found a comfortable or convincing step afterwards. No-frills freakouts seemed a bit too dead-eyed, the big art-psych foibles seemed unsure, and the in-betweens didn't really exist.</p><p>
    On <em>UnonoU</em>, the focus has rightly shifted to the idiosyncrasies and outliers that made them special (and occasionally gave them trouble) last go-round. Naturally, guitars are still doing most of the heavy lifting. ""Spinning Temple Shifting"" is probably as snarling as Danava will ever be, and for a four-minute stretch it nearly rivals the Pentatonic calisthenics of solo-kings Earthless. And despite its somewhat cheesy boogie, ""A High or a Low"" is the best T. Rex these dudes have ever attempted-- believe, they've tried their hand a couple times.
    </p><p>
    But singer Dusty Sparkles and one-namer Rockwell's synth work is the real treat throughout, turning ""way too long"" into ""rewardingly ornate"" on tracks like the symphonic Atari grinder ""The Emerald Snow of Sleep"". Seriously, without the alien tones and <em>War Games</em> final third of ""Where Beauty and Terror Dance"", the album's Reaper-fearing lead single is little more than a three minute guitar somersault with a decent rhythm section shuffle. As it stands, its laser-light coda is one of the record's finest moments.
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, just when the eight-minute-plus sprawler ""Down From a Cloud, Up From The Ground"" is about to over-stay its welcome, a giant swatch of synth turns things downright operatic, casting Sparkles' boney, revered voice in the most flattering, spaced-out light it's ever seen. Scattered throughout <em>UnonoU</em>, and rarely birthed by six-string rumble, these grandiose moments showcase a band able to do much more with heavy armor than recite Sabbath scripts. Indeed, while not yet fully formed, Danava's voice has grown surprisingly unique on the band's second outing.

Doughty, 
    not to be confused with <em>American Idol's </em>
    Daughtry, was once my idol, playing music with Soul Coughing that was 
    as similar to rap as could be expected from a white Army brat, and writing 
    for the <em>New York Press</em>. Fortunately I never lived 
    up to my dream of being him, because then I'd have to be signed to 
    Dave Matthew's ATO Records and probably practicing Matthews' lines 
    with him for the next time he's on <em>House</em>.</p><p>
    One tries not to judge Doughty 
    by the company he keeps, of course, and though his singing is sometimes 
    compared to Matthews', their voices are actually quite distinct. Matthews' 
    sounds like roofies, while Doughty's just wants to invite you up for 
    a couple beers and get to know you. (He understands that no means no.)</p><p>
    Moving on: <em>Golden Delicious</em>'s 
    first two tracks are among the best I've heard from him. Both borrow 
    ditties from outside sources, ""Fort Hood"" from <em>Hair</em>'s ""The 
    Flesh Failures (Let The Sunshine In),"" and ""I Just Want the Girl 
    in the Blue Dress to Keep on Dancing"" from ""The Little Drummer Boy""'s 
    ""ba-rum-ba-bum-bum""-type thing. Hell, the third track, ""Put It 
    Down,"" is full of nonsensical, recycled-feeling sing-along tidbits 
    (""put it downtown, put it down, down"" ""let it go go, let it go 
    go,"" ""drop it in the mail, drop it in the sauce, bottle up the sauce"") 
    and it's good, too. Doughty's former hip-hop mentality is 
    probably what allows him to engage in this free-association, homage/rip-off 
    technique, and there's no reason why more earnest singer-songwriters 
    shouldn't adopt pastiche approaches.
    </p><p>
    Things are actually tighter 
    here musically than his last album, <em>Haughty Melodic</em>, which this website complained was ""full of jam-band percussion, vanilla-funk 
    basslines, and the occasional strings and horns, played with an affected 
    worldliness."" It surely helps that ever-unpretentious producer and 
    Semisonic alum Dan Wilson-- who also produced <em>Haughty</em> and won 
    a Grammy with the Dixie Chicks-- has had three years to step his game 
    up. Production-wise, <em>Golden Delicious </em>
    splits the difference between <em>Haughty</em> and <em>Free Life</em>, Wilson's 
    solo debut from last year which strayed far too close to the adult contemporary 
    flame. Only 37 minutes long and mostly recorded live, <em>Golden Delicious </em>
    has crowd-pleasing on its mind, so much that it even features ""The 
    Final Countdown""-style solos from keyboardist John Kirby.
    </p>
<p>
    Doughty's solo career trajectory 
    is clearly headed skyward since the days of his first two solo works, <em>
    Skittish </em>and <em>Rockity Roll</em>, fairly granola affairs both. Why, 
    then, have the powers-that-be (Matthews?) chosen a <em>Rockity Roll </em>
    outtake as <em>Golden Delicious</em>' first single, the boring ""27 
    Jennifers""? It sounds just like the old version, which was no fun 
    to begin with. (Perhaps it has some sort of subliminal commercial appeal 
    I can't hear. A young Texas girl in hot pants has a YouTube video 
    of herself vamping to it, after all.)
    </p>
<p>
    But ""27 Jennifers"" isn't 
    the worst song on the album -- that would be ""More Bacon Than the 
    Pan Can Handle,"" a self-consciously weird clunker which retreats from 
    the album's ""hum first, think later"" ethos. The ship is righted 
    by the efficient, na-na-na-y ""I Wrote a Song About Your Car"", but 
    riffing and borrowing aren't going to work for him forever, just as 
    Soul Coughing's (I almost said Soul Asylum's) beat-poetry and upright-bass 
    oeuvre sounds ridiculously dated nowadays. Eventually Doughty is going 
    to have to do something about his lyrics, because ""The moonlight shines 
    like a luminous girl tonight/ Yeah, Jesus Christ like a luminous girl 
    tonight"" isn't going to hack it. My advice: stick with Wilson, but 
    hire Pharoahe Monch to ghostwrite.

Outliving just about every other original E6 band, they've made a career flirting with both commercial and critical success only to come up empty-handed in relation to their E6 peers. Their mainstream coup, 2004's <i>Walking With the Beggar Boys</i>, eschewed the band's lo-fi safety net in favor of pristine power-pop and unmitigated T. Rex-isms, failing at a genre shift that ironically would prove fruitful in 2007 for fellow E6 elders Of Montreal. So as reparations, fans first received 2006's no-frills <i>Back to the Web</i> and now <i>In a Cave</i>, the tail end of an extended sigh that started after <i>Beggar Boys</i>' glam rock blowout.</p>
<p>Like any Elf Power effort, the songs here are built around frontman Andrew Rieger, and they sink or swim based on his intermittent sparks of creativity. At its brightest, <i>Cave </i>evokes the lysergic escapism of E6's glory days. The meaty bass riff on ""Spiral Stairs"" gets diluted with vintage fuzz effects and Rieger's consistently sedated delivery, creating yet another gem from the template of Olivia Tremor Control's ""The Opera House"". The band sounds even fresher when digging through a dusty attic's worth of eccentric instruments and sound effects. Drowsy dirges like ""A Tired Army"" and ""Window to Mars"" feel tailor-made for Rieger's unflappable droll, and their disjointed yet catchy melodies-- which are too seldom on this album-- even raise the question of whether or not this band should be doing more drugs.</p>
<p>Working with such a canonized palette, the pressure's constantly on Rieger to transcend his band's stylistic limitations. In the E6 universe, nothing does this better than a Beatles-esque hook. Unfortunately, he's only got a handful to spare on <i>Cave</i>, and for every heart-melting ditty like ""Softly Through the Void"", he's likely to lull listeners with lazy folk numbers like ""The Demon's Daughter"" or closer ""Midnight Crawls Out"". Even worse, the residual effects of <i>Beggar</i>'s libidinous strut plague some of the filler tracks here, their hazy boogie beats giving Rieger an excuse not to be as engaging as he could be while sounding way less sexy than needs to.</p>
<p>For all these drawbacks, <i>Cave </i>will still provide a quick fix for psych fans. In fact, they've even managed to exorcise most of the demons from their ill-advised geek glam dabbling. But while <i>Cave </i>represents a return to form, the band hasn't recaptured the beauty of early highlights like <i>When the Red King Comes</i> or <i>A Dream in Sound</i>. Instead, the band churns out another canned acid trip that only hints at E6's salad days, their mind-freeing mysticism stripped away long ago to leave nothing but rote psych manufacturing.</p></div>"|11246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11246-in-a-cave/|5.9|Adam Moerder

On a Friday, they did a campus show for USC students; but when a miscommunication foiled their next day's plan to play at the Smell-- the venue at the epicenter of the local scene-- they ended up joining a bill with Thee Oh Sees and the Crystal Antlers at a birthday party at the Silverlake Lounge, an intimate, cozy space where you can't see a thing if you're more than five feet from the stage. It's within those coordinates (campus-quad pop,  art-punk, and communal, lo-fi folk) that their Frenchkiss debut <em>Visiter</em> exists; an acoustic-and-percussion duo at their core, Dodos manage to hit with a full-band force that's even more pronounced in their astounding live sets.</p><p>
    On <em>Visiter</em>, Dodos guitarist Meric Long alternates between fingerpicking and breakneck
    strumming while playing in confounding alternate tunings. Logan Kroeber's clattering, locomotive percussion (which includes shoes outfitted with tambourines) is every bit a lead instrument as Long's guitar, and a big reason the band's music has garnered comparisons to the less abstract moments of Animal Collective and the output of other new-primitivist bands like High Places and Yeasayer.</p><p>
    The first quarter of <em>Visiter</em> marries those impulses with fantastic results. The banjo playing and female harmonies on opener ""Walking"" echo <em>Michigan</em>-era Sufjan, but the connection ends at Long's stridently confident vocal delivery. That song immediately segues into the maniacal ""Red &amp; Purple"", a bewilderingly worded love song accompanied by a toy piano and fuzzy bass. And after the brief ""Eyelids"" comes ""Fools"", which has been bouncing around the web in some form for months, and is fast
    becoming the Dodos' signature tune-- although it may soon be eclipsed by the rollicking, Feelies-esque ""Jodi"".</p><p>
    From that point on, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Visiter</span> alternates between longer, more improvisatory material and near-interludes, which can leave a slightly spotty impression on its first few listens. With more exposure, the record reveals the celebratory acoustics of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Led Zeppelin III</span> or a more song-oriented take on tourmates Akron/Family. Playing with infectious fervor, Long runs through tricky blues-boxing and molten slide riffs on the galloping ""Paint the Rust"" and the second half of the epic ""Joe's Waltz"". </p><p>
<em>Visiter</em>'s second half is anchored by ""The Season"" and ""God?"", two massive shapeshifters that help define the record. Long and Kroeber here don't seem wedded to power duo minimalism-- and it's intriguing to wonder how they could incorporate their backgrounds in metal, African Ewe drumming, and gamelan beyond a sense of rhythmic intensity. These possibilities could also make more streamlined, Magnetic Fields-like numbers ""Winter"" and ""Undeclared"" seem vanilla by comparison to some, but by making room for both, <em>Visiter</em> ends up being one of the most welcoming (and welcome) records of 2008 so far.

It is not going to clue you into the new hot scene. It was not ""curated"" by a major magazine, PR company, or Devendra Banhart. It does not even hope to hang together as a cohesive album; its 57 contributors are presented in alphabetical order. Many of the bands are from the Cardboard label's home of Brooklyn, but on the whole the record has no geographical center.  Given that the contribution from Trey Told 'Em (Greg Gillis aka Girl Talk and Frank Musarra) is a mashup of the record's other 56 tracks, the compilation is almost a love letter to overstimulation and information paralysis.</p><p>
    I've seen the words ""scene report"" around <em>Love and Circuits</em>, and while there are some similarities to be drawn between the bands-- kinda punk, kinda dipping their toes into noise or drone or folk or or experimental music or muscular rock-- its overwhelming diversity is its highest strength. By abandoning notions of scenes, enclaves, genre, and anything else but bands still plugging away at a (mostly) small DIY model, it's a much more accurate representation of whatever passes for ""indie."" I mean, I guess it could have No Age on it, come with a bonus DVD, and could give you beer candy every time you played it, but otherwise it's pretty hard collection to fault. Its compilers, Dan Friel and BJ Warshaw of Parts &amp; Labor, say he hopes you find your new favorite band here. If you have any taste for left-of-center punk and indie, you likely will.</p><p>
    Most of the artists tend towards the more discernibly melodic side of the noise spectrum, and no one's afraid of electronics (no matter how cheap they sound), but there's plenty of room here for variation. Arch hypnotists like Fuck Buttons or These Are Powers (both among the few who contribute previously released songs, alas) go up against pagan primitivists like Fathers Day, offering up the desperately ironic ""I Have So Much Respect for Women"". Relative OGs of the indie underbelly like the mighty Oneida or Japanther turn in exemplary tracks, making sense of  incidental noise within their own skewered yet effective songwriting, while newcomers like Bipolar Bear and their crumbling swagger or indie's latest soundtrack for finger-painting, High Places, put forth fine arguments for why they belong in this company. Treble-heavy Big Black acolytes like Action Beat or Tunnel of Love sit next to blink-and-you'll-miss-them Casio workouts, one of which is called ""I Smell Poop Gub"". It sounds like every support act Parts &amp; Labor ever shared a bill with, and that turns out to be a great thing.
    </p><p>
    While <em>Love and Circuits</em> ranges from ear-splitting upstarts like Jerk to the sunny one-finger keyboard anthems of Best Fwends or Matt &amp; Kim, it might be the artists actually repping Cardboard who make the biggest impact: Parts &amp; Labor turn in more gritty synth-punk with supercharged straight-ahead rhythms on ""No Night"", while P&amp;L offshoot Shooting Spires cover Bad Brains' ""Sailin' On"" in ominous washed-out electronics. New signeess Ecstatic Sunshine coast further on the quirky charm of their guitar-duet debut on ""Crystal  in the Sky"", and Pterodactyl provide another gleeful slice of squealing psychedelic noise on ""5 Minutes in 2 Minutes"". Gowns, however, add the sparest bit of electric guitar to serve as a downbeat to their painfully austere horror folk, and the result, ""What if Not You"", is their very own ""Under Pressure"".
    </p>
<p>
    Chaotic or serene, minimalist or balls-to-the-wall, there's a similarity between these disparate artists that's hard to define-- and maybe for the better, <em>Love and Circuits</em> doesn't try. A new prefix or genre tag belittles the diversity of this compilation, as well as the eclectic scene that inspired it. Market-clogging compilations like <em>Next</em> can make some forget that there's more to indie than adult-contempo for snobs, but the interesting bands just below the surface of that are legion-- and <em>Love and Circuits</em> offers curious listeners a running start.

    There's one heck of a conceptual framework behind Einstürzende Neubauten's <em>Alles Wieder Offen</em>. By now, if you're at all interested in the band, you've  heard the story: The classic proto-industrial Berlin quintet funded the album via subscriptions to their <strong><a href=""http://www.neubauten.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a></strong>. Kind of like <em>In Rainbows</em>, but before Radiohead did it, and in reverse. Subscribers had the ability to critique the album while it was being made, suggesting a final sequence or telling the band to pick up a scrap they decided to leave behind on the studio floor. Additionally, a subscription gave the lucky EN fan access to webcam performances and rehearsals. Again, <em>tres</em> Radiohead. The subscriber service isn't new to EN's practice: Their last ""official"" release was 2004's <em>Perpetual Motion</em>, but the group's self-released more than ten collections via the website between <em>Perpetual</em> and <em>Alles</em>. Increasing the meta, some of that material made its way-- chopped, diced, or re-envisioned-- onto <em>Alles</em>.</p><p>
    And that's only <em>part</em> of the frame. If you go to the band's web page, they provide usual EN-style background info-- source material, anecdotes, and/or inter-oeuvre references-- for the 10 tracks. For instance, ""Susej"" is based on a piece for rhythm guitar vocalist Blixa Bargeld recorded in a flooded cellar in Hamburg in the early 1980s. We also learn <em>Alles</em> features the band's first use of a box of aluminum sticks as an instrument (can you guess which tune?). There's too much to absorb-- you could spend nights reading the supporting materials (including the lyrics  handily translated into English) without finding the time to listen to the music. Thing is, when you do get around to listening, the background isn't all that interesting or integral. In fact, it actually takes away from collection's sonic purity. It makes it feel too self-important. <em>Alles</em> works wonderfully as music when divorced from its press releases: The collection definitely includes uninteresting passages, but on the whole,  it also introduces some of the band's most sublime work to date.</p><p>
    This isn't the Neubauten of your childhood. There are moments of dissonance (see the anti-climax of the 9-minute ""Unvollständigkeit"") and the sheet metal's all over the place, but from ""Die Wellen""'s opening pulsation swell to the strummed and then screeched finale ""Ich Warte"", it's a relatively smooth ride. On ""Die Wellen"" (""The Waves""), for example, Bargeld whispers soothingly. He does that sorta thing often. This is the first time you hear him on the record, and as the vibrations accrue volume and a little bit of violence-- guitar, organ, piano, drums viola, and cello are interwoven-- he grows angstier, but remains controlled all the way to the final poetic exclamation: ""I hold my own, shout at each single wave: Are you staying?/ Are you staying?/ Are you staying, or what?"" It's like a tuning of strings before an orchestra starts. Then it cuts. 
    </p>
<p>
    The following track, ""Nagorny Karabach"", has a mellow, gentle, 70s proggy feel. The song's somewhat reminiscent of Fritz Ostermayer's <em>Kitsch Concrete</em>, or, more intriguingly, the recent nighttime baroque of Ulver, another European shape-shifter mellowing ecstatically with age. It includes an e-bow guitar (which I could hear), a jet turbine (maybe), and samples from a 16th century church organ (which I read about on their site). Lyrically, there are ""Two large black ravens/ Devouring the plums in the tree"" and a man in exile, ""hiding in Nagorny Karabakh."" Like a lot of the tunes here, it reminds me of Shakespeare, if only because EN wrestles with huge human themes. 
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe the most surprising song is ""Let's Do it a Dada"", which could seriously work as a dancefloor hit. When placed beside the work of some of the more adventurous producers on pop radio, it feels like clattering electroclash, complete with a huge chorus. (Wonder what the Dada would look like as an actual dance step?  If anything, hopefully there's a lobster suit involved.) There are a number of other interesting moments, like the nursery rhyming ""Ich Hatte Ein Wort"", which reminded me of old
    Siltbreeze noisemakers the Shadow Ring: we hear storytelling voices over a
    clamoring, but skeletal background, muted rock guitar, and an infectiously insane ""de de
    de de de"" hook. ""Von Wegen"" has a similar feel, but seemingly stays quieter-- midnight rumbles, nocturnal taps-- until Bargeld pilots into a ""wegan"" loop, repeating the word, as though mantra. After which, strings cascade with the clamor of metal alongside downward-drifting vocalisms (bum, bum, bum), and this line: ""Dissolve me like sugar/ If you find the time for it."" A love song! Sort of.
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe it's coincidental, or I'm over doing it because of all the materials they attach to the album, but EN save what could be read as the album's moral (or punchline) for the ending. ""Ich Warte""-- which the website tells us ""probably includes more untranslatable German puns than any EN song""-- starts with a pastoral guitar and Bargeld's gently spoken words; somewhat surprisingly, it shifts into crazy ride-em-cowboy noise-slapping. You get the sense Neubauten's reminding us they don't plan to go quietly. Some of the lyrics, minus those German puns? ""I'm waiting for there to be nothing left to wait for/ Life is not an error, not error and music/ I'm waiting/ I'm waiting still."" That restlessness keeps the band ferocious even when they're singing these semi-lullabies.
    </p>
<p>
    Einstürzende Neubauten have been together for more than three decades, and it's satisfying watching (and listening to) them at the height of their powers, constantly using an exploratory virtuosity to push their practice into ever newer realms. The album's title might be translated ""All Open Again,"" but no real need for that ""again.""

Their novelty is clear, present, and safe; their assortment of 1960s minutiae-- from strange Cambodian translations of U.S. and UK psych-rock to spy movie soundtracks to surf-- is charmingly jumbled and affable. Every element shiny and signifying, straightforward and appealing.</p><p>
    And yet their style creates a little dissonance in me. Celebrating Cambodian garage rock-- a music whose practitioners were systematically executed by the Khmer Rouge in the late 70s-- is an odd thing to do without historicizing it, especially when the history deserves so much sober attention. But my frustrations with them aren't conceptual, they're practical. Vocalist Chhom Nimol has an elevatory, radiant voice that would overshadow pretty much any band she might be in. In the case of Dengue Fever, that's a special blessing. Even when their songs pass muster, the performances feel ineffectual, which makes long stretches of <em>Venus on Earth</em> drag semi-miserably. Even the styles they so dutifully ape had an imagination about what to do with the aural character of their guitars, whether through distortion, other effects, or a particular production style. Dengue Fever's textures are straight out of the box, as if what they thought what they're doing between the bars is novel enough. Sometimes it is. Usually, it's not.</p><p>
    While Chhom used to sing almost exclusively in Khmer, almost half of <em>Venus on Earth</em> is in English. There's such a thing as subpar lyrics that don't distract from the gestalt of a band's sound, but Dengue Fever don't find the balance. Instead, narratives about the strains of cross-continental love (""Tiger Phone Card"") or the distinctly Southern Californian pain of having to pick up your drunk girlfriend from parties across town (""Sober Driver"") tend to act more as a compounding element for than a distraction from the band's distinctly okay music. Gone are the few dazzling mutts that skulked through 2005's <em>Escape from Dragon House</em> (particularly ""Sui Bong"" and ""One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula""); here are 11 well-forged set pieces that don't really add up to great songs.</p><p>
    I feel anal-retentive and self-loathing saying that I <em>want</em> to like Dengue Fever, but it's true: I appreciate that they're making indie rock music informed by a foreign stylistic context, I appreciate the mix of non-Western music with Western, and I love Chhom's voice. But there are better ""foreign"" bands, and musicians making more interesting mixes at the moment-- M.I.A., Tinariwen, and even some of Ricardo Villalobos' recent singles sound like they could be from more than one different place, and I mean that as a compliment. While Dengue Fever's intentions are good, their expressions verge on vacuous. <em>Venus on Earth</em> is the kind of benign aural tourism that always made me a little bored and suspicious of Air and even, occasionally, of Stereolab. But what those bands might've lacked in sincerity (if that's what you could call it), they covered for with diligence of craft. I'm generally up for pledging to lightness of mind and the revelations of exoticism, but if <em>Venus on Earth</em> is their idea of, well, Venus on Earth, I'll stick with Earth as is.

They've traded in a bluesy, overdriven sleaze that's served many a duo well in recent years, blurring the edges between their tandem vocals, staccato guitars, and vintage drum machines. On albums such as <em>Keep on Your Mean Side</em> (2003) and <em>No Wow</em> (2005), they managed to take a classic rock template and turn it into something more modern and audibly dangerous. <em>Midnight Boom</em> pushes those edges even further, and has its own kind of swagger that stands apart from anything they've done so far. Despite hammering on its titular phrase like it's a lip gloss for sale, opener ""U.R.A. Fever"" manages to sound like an <em>XTRMNTR</em> outtake that substitutes seduction for violence, with a slinky backbeat made from equal parts purring bass and jarring phone noise.</p><p>
    Many Kills reviews suggest romance in between the two principals-- Alison ""VV"" Mosshart and 
    Jamie ""Hotel"" Hince; the masterfully sustained tension of their previous music practically invited the guesswork. But in comparison, <em>Midnight Boom</em> is limp. The album's beat-heavy inclinations are supposedly inspired by playground chants (specifically a film documentary called <em>Pizza Pizza Daddio</em>), which is easy to pick out from handclaps and martial drumbeats that run through almost every track here. But that same inspiration extends to the sing-song vocal melodies, and much of the lyrics. Now, lyrically, the Kills never had to do any heavy lifting; so long as the words sounded vaguely sexy and/or badass, they fit perfectly. However, the tawdry cheerleader chanting of ""Cheap and Cheerful"" quickly move past intriguing to inane, and the wordless chorus of ""Getting Down"" recalls all the inspiration and verve of the Greg Kihn Band. They just don't write 'em like that anymore, and with good reason.</p><p>
    The saving grace of <em>Midnight Boom</em> is the Kills' desire to break these songs open and see how they work, what makes them tick. The beat-first approach is just window dressing on tracks like ""Cheap and Cheerful"" (despite some production help from Armani XXXchange of Spank Rock; maybe the remix will fare better), but others like ""Tape Song"" jump from coy and insinuating to the album's most blistering chorus. Throughout, Mosshart's vocals are fuller and reflect more character than before. On one of the best rock songs I've heard so far this year, ""Last Day of Magic"" trades the stiff pinball plink of its verses with a tease towards catharsis on a tantalizing two-chord chorus that gets a little longer with each return, until it's finally revealed unmolested as the song's melodic anchor in maybe the last half-minute. By the time you get the full impression of the song, it's over. It's a great trick of rearranging that pulls back the curtain dramatically, but nearly every other song on <em>Midnight Boom</em> seems to be waiting for this kind of moment, losing it to a pile on the cutting-room floor. </p></div>"|11302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11302-midnight-boom/|6.8|Jason Crock

Murray begged for the listener to use his body as if it were their own on <em>With Love</em>'s<em> </em>""Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt"", and on his new record he sounds like someone who's been taken up on the offer far too often-- ""We all recognize that I'm the problem here"" (""Ghouls""), ""I realize that I am naturally inclined just to let you down"" (""Let's See It""), ""Listen, I may have given you the wrong impression"" (""Spoken For"").  You get the idea, but rarely does it come off as self-pitying so much as self-deprecating.</p><p>
    Modesty, however, can create problems for a band that lives three minutes at a time. While <em>With Love and Squalor</em> was frequently, oddly tagged ""dance punk""-- a claim that stretched the sub-genre to the breaking point-- We Are Scientists here rely heavily on synthetics, which don't suit them. There's no point in taking a band to task for shitty mastering if it's countered by melodies or emotional resonance (see: Neutral Milk Hotel), but it's troubling for a record that's pursuing more surface thrills.  The dominant sound of <em>Brain Thrust Mastery </em>is a synth wash that tries to excite like cocaine but ends up numbing like Novocaine, effectively narcotizing what are mostly bland arrangements to begin with.  We Are Scientists got accused of coming on too strong on <em>With Love</em>-- uptempo pop-rock, almost entirely about girls and embarrassing drunkenness-- and they do the same thing here, only from a sonic angle; namely, there's no empty space at all.</p><p>
    The lurching fuzz bass and ticky-tack 808 hi hats of ""Ghouls"" suggests seriously intense study of TV on the Radio's ""Staring at the Sun"", but it all goes to highlight the importance of David Sitek's production. Despite inevitably blasting into more traditional rock, ""Ghouls"" still goes nowhere-- each element desperately groping at each other in a cluttered mix like horny teens in the dark.  ""Lethal Enforcer"" comes equipped with a serious mid-1980s Cure jones, and far too much extraneous baggage.  The imitative strings are a decent touch, but they keep getting inappropriately prodded by popping bass and chicken-scratch guitar.  Even the palm-muted aimlessness of ""Spoken For"" eventually gives way to distended guitar blasts that come off more like pressure hoses than a sound emanating from wood and string.
    Still, as far as mainstream pop-rock records go, <em>Brain Thrust Mastery </em>occasionally gets the job done. Lead single ""After Hours"" bops along like the second single Jimmy Eat World's <em>Chase This Light </em>sorely lacked, while the dramatic ""Tonight"" finally makes good use of their Korgs.  Both are good enough to make you marginally interested in what We Are Scientists will do next, at best.  Those who fail to learn from Hot Hot Heat are doomed to repeat them.</p></div>"|11274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11274-brain-thrust-mastery/|5.3|Ian Cohen

This New Jersey band harkens back to a time when these genres were bedmates. Before recording <em>Bleach</em>, Nirvana listened to Celtic Frost incessantly. This was before Butch Vig polished off their edges, before Marc Jacobs had a ""grunge"" collection. In the late-1980s/early-90s, Amphetamine Reptile belched forth West Coast grit (the Melvins, Steel Pole Bath Tub), East Coast noise (Helmet, Unsane), and Midwest dirt (the Cows, Hammerhead); Touch and Go-- pre-indie rock days-- likewise issued filth and difficulty via Big Black, Butthole Surfers, and the Jesus Lizard. Though sonically disparate, these bands shared a contemptuous disregard for rock's playbook.</p><p>
    Thus, Fight Amp aren't revelatory: They're drawing on established models of rebellion rather than drawing their own, but they're no less potent for it. In fact, hindsight has honed their influences with fearsome focus. Guitarists Mike McGinnis and Rebecca Burchette slice out riffs with metallic accuracy. In the liner notes, Jon Dehart slings a duct-taped P-Bass; the black-and-white photo could have come from a Sub Pop sleeve. But unlike his forebears, Dehart can play his instrument. Scott Hissem's precise pounding opens big holes, into which Dehart pours throbbing pulses. The overall effect recalls the Jesus Lizard, who had one of the most punishing rhythm sections of the 90s.</p><p>
    The payoff, then, is different. Instead of the white-knuckle anarchy of AmRep 7""'s, <em>Hungry for Nothing</em> is a calculated beatdown. Even the band's name reflects this. As Fight Amputation, the band raggedly sprawled with hardcore punk influences. But as a leaner Fight Amp, they've slowed down, making each punch count. ""Late Bloomer"" punctuates verses with pregnant pauses, building to churning climaxes. Air raid unisons then announce the return of Black Sabbath. ""Dead Is Dead"" rides train tracks of chugging riffs, as Hissem drops hi-hat accents like elbows.  In ""Get High and Fuck"", low end snarls the titular mission, while drones descend like distant warplanes. Scarred-throat howls erupt from the next room. The hollow-eyed filth of early-00s Ministry comes to mind. </p><p>
    Peers like Akimbo, Black Elk, and Blues mine similar inspirations, but Fight Amp stand out with metallic atmosphere. ""What a Drag"" drowns in sheets of doomy desperation. ""Bound and Hagged"" gives Jesus Lizard dissonance Danzig-esque brawn. Three-fourths through, it slouches into a shuffle, which is really a ruse; after a tense pause, hammering re-commences. Danzig glowers throughout, in the song title ""Samhain"", the horror comic book artwork, and the lyrical altitude set at six feet under. This is no mere garage punk; this is a finely tuned assault with booming, modern production. It's not ""dope, guns, and fucking in the streets,"" but it's pretty fucking dope.</p></div>"|11251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11251-hungry-for-nothing/|7.8|Cosmo Lee

But I do respect its seven unflinching, unapologetic seven-to-15-minute guitar monoliths, not to mention Barr's technical ability and his sense for compounded sounds. This isn't strict minimalism, but it carries that sense of devotion to sound and idea, to chasing a notion from one end of an album to another. Barr's piercing multi-tracked electric guitars build deep beds at the base. On ""Part 1"", he sporadically stops his static sound to unload a thin riff, which gets longer each time he plays it. Before the 13 minutes of ""Part 1"" expire, he's playing over the static, augmenting it and bending it from above. Barr is a composer in search of a single epic and a guitarist in search of a million thrills, and here he proves he's got the tools and the mindset to procure both.<br/></p><p>
    But <em>Annwn</em> is a little unkind to most every audience, save perhaps the most attentive. It's more of a workshop than an album, really. Casual listeners will get lost in Barr's long-form excursions after 90 seconds. If you're willing to hang on Barr's every riff and layer time and again, <em>Annwn</em> is full of rewards. The record is at its most effective when it is rapid on top and glacial beneath, as during the midsection of 15-minute ""Part 2"". Barr moves between small intervals in slow, jolting steps, and each drop or lift feels like a revelation, even though he's shredding above the stasis with thin, high, impatient lances. The effect is one of simultaneous and alternate allusions-- of sprinting but getting nowhere, of crawling but watching mileposts click past. Whenever Barr creates conflicts and resolves them while baiting the listener with serpentine riffs, <em>Annwn</em> is exhilarating. On ""Part 4"", for instance, he lets riffs whiz by one another, tugging attention in multiple directions, only to circle the wagons with harmonies you never saw coming. It's composition disguised as chaos, more meticulous than masturbatory.</p><p>
    As another symptom of <em>Annwn</em>'s workshop feel, Barr saves the most triumphant and accessible illustration for ""Part 7"", the last and shortest thing here: It's an anthem from the start, several circular parts interconnecting with one another, rising and falling constantly.

    In 2003, the Detroit band Electric Six found some fame, especially in England, through their transcendently dumb singles ""Gay Bar"" and ""Danger! High Voltage"". The songs were over-the-top and showed the jesters' almost encyclopedic hold on every brand of rock theatrics from 1975 to 1985. Sure, this may describe about 70% of your student center's Battle of the Bands entrants, but this band spiked the brew with heaping helpings of irony and self-consciousness. Kings of Leon they are not.</p><p>
    Electric Six are chuckling at themselves, yes-- and they also seem to be poking fun at those hammy, cartoonish expressions of manliness that crowd the playlists of every nipple-ringed Delta pledge. Thus the Electric Six discography abounds with wry renditions of cock- and garage-rock that the gender-studies set can comfortably load onto their iPods. It is quite a coup. Yet on <em>I Shall Exterminate Everything Around Me That Restricts Me From Being the Master</em>, the revolution sputters. It's not the old case of a perfectly low-rent aesthetic becoming somehow ""compromised"" by the more upmarket production you'd find on MTV, lacquered and Autotuned to oblivion. Simple predictability is to blame. When Dick Valentine opens the record, bellowing on the saloon rambler ""It's Showtime!"" in his mock-macho growl, over mock-operatic riffs, and clarinets and pianos, you quickly get your fill. Soon you yearn for the old Electric Six, with its perfect quantity of smarty-pants pomp, when there was a little energy and wit behind their disco infiltrators.</p><p>
    This just feels derivative. Once upon a time, being derivative was half of the band's shtick-- but never more than half. They cleverly and shamelessly used MOR clichés as touchstones for their twisted imagination. So the other half was the act of poking fun at this source material, as they remade all that high-stepping 1980s swagger into memorably silly, truly postmodern dance music. (Of course, this only applies to 2003's <em>Fire</em>.) Electric Six defenders may answer that these judgments miss the point, that there's far more to the band than tongue-in-cheek appropriation of the past. They may say their whole body of work takes aim at the carnival of American culture. Free of any ""Danger""-grade hits, 2005's <em>Señor Smoke</em> is held up as proof of the band's satirical, capital-s Seriousness. But the fact is that ""Jimmy Carter"" says exactly as much about presidential folly as ""Down at McDonnellzzzzz"" says about the nation's waistlines. Valentine wants to decry our excess by turning it into a punchline, yet thanks to the cheese-ball arrangements and childish lyrics, neither comic effect nor social critique is ever attained. Given that Bush's America is more than a little like Weimar Germany, this should have been like fish in a barrel.
    </p>
<p>
    More evidence of a hidden Swiftian intellect, supposedly, is that the title of the new album comes from an anti-Weimar George Grosz cartoon. Defying any rumors of thematic gravity, Dick Valentine himself crunched the numbers, once declaring that ""80 percent of our songs, maybe even higher than 80 percent"" are about nothing at all. On the gleefully nihilistic <em>Fire</em> that was fine. But five years later, without glee, we're left with boring nihilism. Without any attempt to elaborate their sound, without dance-floor contenders or striking hooks, without straying meaningfully from the templates of straightaway rock, <em>Exterminate</em> simply fulfills the promise of its title: like most Dadaist jokes, this one isn't funny.

    Be Your Own Pet's latest output includes two songs that give an indication of just how well these kids can grow. ""Becky"" (available only on XL's UK version of the album) has a faint girl-group tinge and a classic girl-group subject: It's an over the top best-friend break-up song, running from tears in the lunchroom and final demands (""Give me back all the clothes you borrowed/ Don't give me bullshit, bring them to school tomorrow"") to after-class ambushes and knife-fights in the halls. High-school snot, right? But then there's lead single ""The Kelly Affair"", which cribs from <em>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</em>: Now it's the story of a hot young band, just arrived in Southern California and surrounded by high-rolling, pill-popping sex addicts. ""It could be dangerous,"" says singer Jemina Pearl, ""living in this valley."" But she sings it like someone who's not particularly worried, and smirks it out like someone who's hungry for a little of that danger.</p><p>
    So Be Your Own Pet have graduated from high-school sass to world-conquering-- with a new drummer, no less-- without losing any of the lovable Muppet-like punk enthusiasm of their first record; they still come at you in a way that could probably make college kids feel ancient. On <em>Get Awkward</em>, the band has become a lot more precise, which always happens when you're developing your songs in a studio instead of just rampaging over crowds in bars. And what happens when you combine teenage punk, chops, and precision is, well, a little bit of glam: The guitar work here is still ten times rangier and more inventive than you'd expect, but it takes a few very professional steps back, nailing down its snappy flourishes amid ecstatic ""whoo!""s, new-wave poses, and occasional clouds of glitter and confetti. With the band members' ages now clustered somewhere around 20, that glam is still the fascinating thing about this act-- they're from what might be the first generation to see American hardcore punk not as a venue for intense, frustrated guys to scowl at the world, but for good-time kids to bounce around like insane teddy-bear rock stars. It's not as if Black Flag never indulged in happy gang chants about watching TV, but they never sounded as thrilled about it as this band does on ""Bummer Time"", let alone on the song about food fights (timeless chorus: ""Sucks to be the janitor!"").</p><p>
    That's not to say that this album's half-hour running time doesn't sag in spots. Once you start sounding a little more slick, it can get hard to keep selling that rickety energy, song after song. And while Pearl's singing voice has developed beautifully, she has some nagging bad habits with the lyrics-- sometimes it's the kinds of rhymes that make you cringe once you pass legal drinking age, and sometimes it's the way she'll get stuck for subject matter and riff off whatever movie was on TV the night before. (""Bitches Leave"", a piece of girl-on-girl crime in that mid-album sag, jumps off from a line in <em>Robocop</em> but gets points for a great snarky aside about women trying to impress people by claiming to like anal sex.) It's a surprise, because some of her lyrics here are terrifically blunt and on-point, especially when she's singing about liking guys she shouldn't: ""Heart Throb"", the album's best song, may be addressed to the man in the title, but it feels more like she's coaching herself on how not to go boy-crazy when she's already with someone.</p><p>
    That's what's less of a surprise: Pearl continues to make being young, blonde, awesome, zombie-obsessed, and in a cool band seem entirely relatable, like her rock heroism is genuinely on behalf of smart-ass misfit girls the whole country wide. When she's giving the kiss-off to that former best friend on ""Becky"", the guys in the band step up for some backing vocals, shouting ""We don't like Becky anymore!"" in unison. There's something in that, and in the three-song run of perfect enthusiasm near the start of this record, that makes it easy to look past any moments where the steam runs out: They might be out of high school, but these kids sound tight-knit and generous, exactly the kind of Muppety teenage punks you'd want to drink beer with and have backing you up in any knife-fights after homeroom.<br/>

    DeVotchKa's career bio is so unlikely that we pitiable reviewers usually have to indulge our inner allusion-making spazzes to give the impression that we're not just recasting the interesting facts from the band's press releases as zingers. I, for one, was going to utter something like, ""This band will be perfect to replace Jose Feliciano in the <em>Celebrity Room</em> scene when Guy Maddin remakes <em>Fargo</em>, setting it at the turn of an imaginary century."" See, right there, you get the exoticism, the uncouthness, the kitschy passion (or earnest camp?), the hint of menace, and the nostalgia so nonspecific that it seems forward-looking. Woodchipper-bound criminal Carl Showalter even (mis)references the work from which DeVotchKa's name derives, <em>A Clockwork Orange, </em>during that segment, when he tells his prostitute date he's only in town ""for a little of the old in-and-out.""
    Seriously, I can't compete: A professorial classical violinist. A sousaphone player from a Civil War recreation band. A punk-turned-mariachi-enthusiast drummer raised by polka musicians. A Gypsy-descendant singer more multi-instrumentalist than the other three band members that I just reductively identified according to their ""main"" pieces of equipment. DeVotchKa invented the Diablo Cody arc, as they've gone from accompanying burlesque/fetish shows to getting a Grammy nod, despite being unsigned at the time. Sire reportedly couldn't have them because parent company Warner thought them ""unmarketable""-- and yet they just no-thanxed an offer from McDonald's to feature their music in the ubiquitous carcass-merchant's, um, marketing.</p><p>
    An odd byproduct of the band's matriculation to Anti- Records is realizing that one of their new labelmates already ""did"" their blend of oompah/Morricone/lounge/Latin/etc textures, though with an entirely different vocal approach: the arrangements on Tom Waits' late 1980s and early 90s Island work could be just as baroque. Nick Urata's croon, however, is, whew, like Caetano Veloso had a declamatory baby with each of the Traveling Wilburys. His intensity and, fuck it, beauty is probably what keeps the music's globe-groping cleverness from coming off as sorta quirque-du-soleil. I mean, Urata can sell impresario, lothario, and tragic romantic hero within a single track.</p><p>
    Plus, the balanced, stately-but-dreamy production is pristine-- jams with urgent pulses á la the National/Constantines somehow feel nimble. The band adopts modes from several cultures' wedding- and-funeral traditions, yet never sounds simply ritualistic. Again, once Urata opens his trap, the proceedings immediately feel more the Cure than curated. But something mysteriously blocks this very good record from being great. I wanted it to inspire obsession, I wanted it to break my heart, I wanted its graceful fusion to borrow so freely from so many musical worlds that it achieved worldlessness. 
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe DeVotchKa's vibe is difficult to withstand for the duration of a long player. ""Head Honcho"", included here, is a revisitation of a song from the release on which they coined the term for their style: <em>Supermelodrama</em>. Stretching its sweetness out further than an EP can result in a new form of aesthetic torture: syrupboarding. (The two instrumentals kind of acknowledge that the listener might need a boutiquey break from how Urata's epic tremble-slur has the potential to make someone so manic that they'd practice ocular aversion to keep from believing that whoever's in their sightline is ""the one."") And the standard relationship-disillusionment lyrics are lacking. You get a (true, reckon) cliché about the winner of the rat race still being a rat, and bits such as ""You can bury it deep inside but you can never hide."" Worse, half of the songs hit such impressive peaks that the rest seem slight by comparison. But oh, those peaks-- buy this disc for ""Along the Way"", for ""Undone"", or just for the spooky dip of ""New World""'s eww/oohs. That these are the album's ballads might be testimony that what we have here is a group heartily willing to pen raucous romps for clubs and festivals while secretly wishing to go quiet.

Arcade Fire, Hold Steady, Constantines, even the Killers-- several of the most acclaimed/successful bands of the last three years have taken up influences Marah's been hammering for a decade, and if this trend wasn't already flying high on the fiery eyes of your lover's dying pride when <em>If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry</em> dropped in early 2006, it definitely is now.  Say what you will about Marah's spotty recordings, but if you were going to set <em>Kids in Philly</em> as the over/under for the quality of the next Killers album, how many of you are taking the over?  For the next Arcade Fire album?</p><p>
    Okay <em>okay</em>, but it would still be some kind of nasty irony if the reason Marah didn't catch a break in 2008 is because they don't sound <em>enough</em> like Brooce.  It's no secret that Marah, through personnel changes-- <em>Angels of Destruction!</em> features four new members-- or general restlessness or maybe a shredded throat, have abandoned their reedy, rambling <em>The Wild, the Innocent, &amp; the E Street Shuffle</em> sound. Today, they're a beefier band that has more in common with the Strokes or Wilco than the 1970s groups to which they're more often compared.  Singers Serge and Dave Bielanko disappointingly leave one another alone too: sloppy buddy-choruses have given way to polite turn-taking.</p><p>
    None of this really changes the fact that listening to Marah is sort of fun, if for no other reason than in the middle of a Marah album you can rationalize a lyric like ""Reelin' from a tongue-kiss/ On the outskirts of foreverness"" in way that you mostly cannot when you are reading or writing about the band.  Marah's reputation has probably suffered among critics for that very reason, but it's a phenomenon that <em>Angels</em> will absolutely not correct: at this point in their career Marah hardly need black-and-white photos of sparking cigarettes, exclamation points, or 10 minute multi-part album closers (""Wilderness"") to prove to the world they are very, very serious about rock'n'roll.  </p><p>
<em>Angels</em> contains plenty of good Marah-y things, too. Marah are best when they boogie or slow-dance (as opposed to the alt-rock in-between). Marah find the former on opener ""Coughing Up Blood"" and ""Wild West Love Song"", both of which blitz along quickly enough to make you forget about dynamics or even great hooks-- the rush is its own atmosphere.  True to their tendency to include one readymade prom-night song on each album, ""Blue But Cool"" features ""wooo-oooh"" backing vocals and loping piano chords.  It is likely not the album's most ridiculous set of lyrics, but it seems so because they're the slowest, and the best too: ""Two heart-sick fools drinking beer on the kitchen stools/ And we're scared/ Yeah we're blue, but cool.""  </p><p>
    Also: ""Now that we're talkin' at it/ How the hell are we gonna pay for all your clothes?""  Marah have the infuriating ability to sketch scenes that actually bust hearts, such that it's impossible not to think that their romance-junkie tales wouldn't be better served by the above than by meaningless horseshit like ""Angels will rip your chest open/ And fill it with flowers.""  This is, of course, a long-winded way of saying that <em>Angels</em> is a Marah album, which sort of sucks, but that ""Blue But Cool"" and ""Santos De Madera"" and the title track might still make you a little misty eyed and/or end up on a mixtape. More to the point, <em>Angels</em> will cause no one to forget <em>Separation Sunday</em> or even <em>Kids in Philly</em>.  <br/></p></div>"|11247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11247-angels-of-destruction/|6.9|Andrew Gaerig

    Let's do a little free association. The word is Iraq. What
    comes to mind? I bounced this off a few people in the past few days, and got
    back answers that included war, violence, Islam, Sunnis &amp; Shiites, Arabs,
    Saddam Hussein, oil, WMDs (answer given as an acronym) and suicide bombings.
    You'd barely even know there was an actual country, much less any kind of
    culture, behind all that if you just looked at the collection of words. Really,
    the responses I got were a collection of impressions (very similar to my own)
    culled from news reports dating back to the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s-- it's
    exceedingly easy in our media culture to forget that behind all the no-fly
    zones, Sunni Triangles, concrete barriers, smart bombs, and corpses there are
    more than 25 million people trying to lead somewhat normal lives.</p><p>
    Amir ElSaffar doesn't live in Iraq
    and wasn't even born there-- he was born in Illinois to an Iraqi father and an American
    mother, but you can imagine that ever since 1991 his Iraqi heritage weighed
    heavily in his mind. He's played jazz and classical trumpet since the 90s,
    including stints with Cecil Taylor and Vijay Iyer, but in 2002 he traveled to
    Baghdad as the drum beat of war was slowly rising to learn to play the santoor,
    a Mesopotamian hammer dulcimer. He also learned to play traditional <em>maqam</em> music. The <em>maqam</em> is built around a <em>ruhiyya</em>,
    which is a basic modal melodic framework for improvisation-- the same
    approach taken by a great deal of modern jazz.</p><p>
    This trip back to his cultural roots led directly to his
    first recordings as a bandleader, including this one. The title <em>Two Rivers</em> refers to the Tigris and
    Euphrates, the two principle rivers of Iraq, and the water sources for
    some of the world's earliest civilizations. The record isn't a <em>maqam</em> recording in the strictest
    sense-- rather, it blends the techniques of <em>maqam</em>
    with modern jazz (Iraqi <em>maqam</em> is also
    a vocal form, but ElSaffar keeps it mostly instrumental for this record). The
    sextet  includes trumpet, santoor, alto
    sax, oud, violin, bass drums, and hand percussion (not all at once, obviously)
    and swings back and forth between mellifluous themes, complex rhythms and time
    changes, and diffuse semi-free passages that often feature multiple instruments
    playing against a single one that holds down the theme. 
    </p>
<p>
    ElSaffar carefully annotates each of his compositions in the
    liners, explaining where the rhythms came from and the origins of the <em>maqams</em> his own tunes are drawn from-- reading them, I got the rare feeling that I was actually learning
    something from the album notes. That's all great, but it wouldn't be worth much
    if the music didn't move me as well. And it does. The unique rhythms (one track
    is in 17/8) create an interesting framework for jazz improvisation, and the
    tension between structure and anarchy is high throughout the album. One of the
    record's most gripping moments occurs on ""Khosh Reng (Maqam Awj)"", when
    ElSaffar puts down the trumpet and sings. The phrases tend to begin with a few
    words sung on a single note and move away microtonally at the end. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's also great to hear a new recording that showcases the
    santoor, a beautiful instrument that sounds somewhere between a piano, a
    mandolin and a harp. It's an instrument most people in the West don't even know
    exists, played in a style most people in the West aren't aware exists, and it
    gives us a piece of Iraq
    we can't get on CNN. In fact, apart from Sublime Frequencies' excellent <em>Choubi Choubi!</em> compilation, it's hard to
    hear any Iraqi music today and rare to get a glimpse into the country's
    incredibly rich cultural history. <em>Two
    Rivers</em> provides that, and it's also a great modern jazz album.

Shelby Lynne released several albums of contemporary country throughout the late 1980s and early 90s before reemerging (and recreating herself) on 1999's renewed statement of purpose <em>I Am Shelby Lynne</em> (in true Grammy fashion, she won a Best New Artist award for this, her sixth album). Yet despite that album's relative success, Lynne proved as restless as ever with 2001's poppy <em>Love, Shelby</em>, 2003's aptly named <em>Identity Crisis</em>, and 2005's <em>Suit Yourself</em>, which further toned down the twang in favor of spare, moody rock (not nearly as eclectic as some claimed, even as Lynne showed clear, confident growth as a songwriter).</p><p>
    Lynne has made another about face, this time with <em>Just a Little Lovin'</em>, a tribute to Dusty Springfield. The timing of the disc is curious, to say the least. A known quantity, Lynne seems to be trying re-establish herself once again, gaining a new foothold as a chanteuse and interpreter with a critical catnip move that, at least on its face, appears pretty safe. After all, a Springfield tribute would have been the perfect attention-gaining move, say, 10 years ago. In 2008, it seems a bit like playing a ""get out of career jail free"" card she's been holding in her pocket for at least as long.</p><p>
    Lynne (and, for that matter, little sister Allison Moorer, also out with a new covers disc) has been earning comparisons to Springfield for years, but to her enormous credit seems to have been the first to acknowledge the 800-lb gorilla in the room: <em>Just a Little Lovin'</em> may pay tribute to Springfield, but it treads very lightly when it comes to Springfield's definitive <em>Dusty in Memphis</em>, whose sessions inspired just four of the remakes on this disc. The rest come from Springfield's 1964 debut <em>A Girl Called Dusty</em>, plus a pleasant run through the oft covered (by Dusty and others) ""The Look of Love"" and ""How Can I Be Sure"". </p><p>
    And then there's ""Pretend"", the biggest risk on the album, an original song inspired by Springfield and as good a place to start as any when tackling such a loaded disc. Respectfully deferring to the legacy of <em>Dusty in Memphis</em> (and, specifically, ""Son of a Preacher Man"", which Lynne wisely did not record) is one thing. But including an original song on a disc otherwise composed of songs associated with Springfield is another. It's a tall order to summon up a song Dusty Springfield might have sang. Then again, few would have ever imagined Springfield would  have a hit collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys, so who knows.</p><p>
    But does ""Pretend"" work? Sure, why not, which  gets to the conflicted crux of this project. Lynne could have easily attempted to emulate Springfield, but she doesn't. <em>Just a Little Lovin' </em>could have easily attempted to emulate Springfield's arrangements, too, with horns or strings, but it doesn't. Instead, both Lynne and album alike attempt to pay tribute to the songs Springfield sang and made famous as much as the singer herself.</p><p>
    That's an honorable approach, to be sure, with one catch: Springfield didn't write her songs, so if you take away the things that made them hers what's left are songs that may as well be anyone's. With jazzy, crystal-clear production favoring intimate acoustic guitar and upright bass, Lynne does justice to these tracks, her voice just the right mix of smoky, sad and soulful even if the milquetoast backing lends it little muscle. The title track and ""I Only Want to Be With You"" are light and airy, with extra credit to the latter for twisting such a standard into an entirely new shape. The Delta blues underpinnings of Lynne's ""Willie and Laura Mae Jones"" may not quite be a revelation, but the swamp vibe feels perfect.</p><p>
    On the other end of the spectrum, while Springfield might have recorded the first version of ""The Look of Love"", the song's since moved well past any claim to ownership. Just as Lynne steered clear of ""Son of a Preacher Man"", she should have steered clear of this over-exposed cliché of a song, too. But a bigger problem can be found in the sultry gait of ""Breakfast in Bed"", which boasts (and highlights) something missing from much of the rest of the record: some playful sexiness. By stripping them down to their bones, Lynne gets the skeleton of these songs right, but in the end you can't help but miss the meat that made Springfield who she was. Springfield never made music meant for the background, but that's unfortunately just where Lynne's emotional in intent but passive in execution take on Springfield's legacy ultimately belongs. <br/></p></div>"|11256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11256-just-a-little-lovin/|5.3|Joshua Klein

Though the microphones have proliferated in the     studio, they still record their harmony-heavy bluegrass in live takes, and     apart from the occasional steel guitar, it's all acoustic.

<p>Dave Wilson's songwriting has a very distinctive harmonic     feel-- his chord sequences seem chosen for their relative lack of resolution, and     the banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and guitar parts seem to float around on the     rhythm. Opener ""Chip of a Star"" is even kind of spacey, with bassist Greg     Readling's pedal steel additions heightening the song's cosmic country feel. Wilson also has his     moments lyrically. ""Country Boy/City Boy"" isn't quite the typical boosterism     for the rural life you hear on albums like this-it's really more about how we     all wish we could experience another life. ""If I was a country boy, I'd wish     for the city lights/ If I was a city boy, I'd wish for a quiet night,"" he sings,     taking the air out of the country/city divide that modern country music plays     so heavily on.</p>
<p>Outside of Wilson's     strengths as a songwriter, he simply has the right voice for the music, a soft     tenor with a bit of a twang and accent that never fails to be melodic. Even on     ""Birmingham Jail"", a darker, more intense song than any of the ones around it     he dips and dodges around John Teer's searing fiddle part with ease. That sense     of interplay between the band members is evident all over. The dynamics of the     gently bouncing ""The Carolinia"" feel natural and unstudied, with the mandolin     and banjo practically having a conversation around the lead vocal. The band     lets that interplay loose on banjoist Chandler Holt's brief instrumental ""Clear     Blue Sky"", a too-brief showcase for the band's old-time mountain music     leanings. The other instrumental, ""Paige"", is a gorgeous mandolin fantasia by     Teer that owes a little something to Bach is its delicate chords.</p>
<p><i>IV</i> is the most rewarding     offering from Chatham County Line to date. It's a little bit bigger and a     little more elaborate than its predecessors, but it's an incremental step     toward something more expansive. It still retains the best elements of the band's     music-- its separation from the moment. This music isn't a     product of its era, but nor is it married to a bygone one. It's essentially     timeless, both in terms of era and when I find I can listen to it. That's a     quality any band would be happy to claim.</p></div>"|11236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11236-iv/|7.4|Joe Tangari

Pop music is seldom this fierce and purposeful, rock music seldom this melodic and thoughtful. <em>This Year's Model</em> is fully realized in style and substance, both unique and unassuming.  You can tell an Elvis Costello song from melody alone, but the arrangements and performances offered up by the attractions are no less distinctive and recognizable.  There is not a single bad song on <em>This Year's Model</em>, and the one moment on the record that kind of goes clunk (the opening line of ""Lip Service"") still gets stuck in my head all the time. If you don't own a copy of this record, you should...</p><p>
    ...seek out the cheaper, better (and sadly out-of-print) Rhino reissue.  Sorry, folks. <em>This Year's Model</em> itself is a 10.0 in most any context as far as I'm concerned, but reviewing a value-added ""deluxe"" edition warrants an interrogation of, uh, the added value.  A thoughtful, reasonably priced, and only-six-year-old 2xCD version of this album is no longer available new, and Universal's latest  ""deluxe"" reissue feels bloated and dubious by comparison.   Going through the bonus tracks in detail is almost entirely fruitless here; every single extra included on the first disc of this reissue was also available on the Rhino edition (with the exception of the excellent ""Tiny Steps"", which was included on Rhino's <em>Armed Forces</em>).  Three good bonus tracks versions from Rhino's reissue are omitted here, leaving this reissue with only the live disc to recommend it.</p><p>
    Thankfully, this time around it actually does.  A complete concert recording from a 1978 show in Washington, D.C. fills out the second disc nicely.  The recording lacks the crackling frenzy of the classic Live at El Mocambo recording, or even the enlightening tenuousness of the Nashville Rooms show included on Universal's <em>My Aim Is True</em> reissue.  Simply put, it comes off as an average night on tour for a spectacular band, marked by a few stray sour notes and chords but still nothing short of inspiring.  Perhaps owing to their position after that ampersand, the Attractions still don't really get their due as one of rock and roll's truly great bands, and this live recording shows Elvis Costello and the Attractions as an inseparable and forceful group, not a songwriter and his backing band.  Does a good live recording of a great band warrant dropping $25 on a reissue?</p><p>
    So there you have it-- plus one for a better live disc, minus one for zero new bonus material.  This looks and feels like a ""deluxe"" version, for sure, but lacks the curated and cared-for feel (and the liners, provided by Costello himself) of the Rhino reissue.  Indeed, the problem with this ""deluxe"" series so far isn't that it's poorly conceived, or poorly designed, but rather it feels so generic and uninspired, right down to (and, yes, I will mention this in the review of every single reissue from this series) the ad for ""ELVIS COSTELLO RINGTONES"" in the back of the liners. <em>This Year's Model</em> is a sharp and brilliant album, rife with wit and cynicism; it's hard not to be put off by a reissue whose last words are ""RINGTONES ARE FOR PURCHASE ONLY, NOT PART OF EXCLUSIVE COMPLIMENTARY BONUS MATERIAL.""<br/></p></div>"|11276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11276-this-years-model-deluxe-edition/|7.0|Matt LeMay

But out of all the British bands still playing under the umbrella of post-punk, there's so much that TNP get right about the sound: scraps of syncopated guitars making the barest insinuations of melody, stiff electronic beats that sound like factory noise, and singer who barks excitedly but whose message is initially cryptic. The pattern suits them well and doesn't sound derivative or dated; that may be in part to this record owing as much to its heavy, ominous beats as its guitars or melody. ""Numerology (AKA Numbers)"" has a bludgeoning thump driving its layered keyboards and chicken-scratch guitars, while ""Doppelganger"" has atmospheric effects that would fit onto any Prefuse 73 record.</p><p>
    Moreover, there aren't any wide-eyed ballads or snappy, ingratiating choruses here. These New Puritans come at their songs as if they were challenges presented to them and they write them to their own distinctive logic. It's simpler than it sounds: Finding just the right amount of verse to fit in 60 seconds on ""Swords of Truth"" or how much tension they can wrest from (and how long they can get away with playing) one open note on ""Elvis"". Rather than verse to chorus and back, the songs seem like chunks of raw riffage and misbehaving machinery sewn together, their sleek edges fitting perfectly. Electronic interludes flow expertly between the tracks, never sounding extraneous, while the songs themselves are full of jagged transitions, like the percussive rant of ""C 16th"" or the seething patchwork of ""Colours"": A flurry of drums into a strutting chorus and simmering bridge section. Meanwhile, lyrics bleed from one song to the other, melodies and themes are recycled, titles blur into each other-- the album is almost remixing itself as it moves along, adding to its chaotic overall feel.</p><p>
    Tantalizing advance singles ""En Papier"" and ""Elvis"" are both here, with ""En Papier"" veering between from winding guitar licks to anchorless electronic textures, and ""Elvis"" maybe the album's most insistent track-- its tension and release is much simpler than many of the other tracks, but the chorus is monstrous, as is the payoff. They're among the album's best, but they don't outshine the rest, and <em>Beat Pyramid</em> proves to be an affirming and promising first step. The mystery and paranoia are mostly communicated through the music rather than the heavy repetition of the lyrics, with their questions about numbers and sums of money coming through in impatient monotones.  Making a genre that's become a bankable prospect sound earnest and exciting is no easy feat; hopefully the next step is finding room for some more trenchant messages along with it.</p></div>"|11295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11295-beat-pyramid/|7.5|Jason Crock

    In the first half of the decade, 
    rapper and producer Black Spade repped St. Louis crew Soul Tyde, that 
    city's neo-soul answer to Wu-Tang Clan, maxing out at about 14 highly 
    motivated members. Spade had been compiling solo album material since 
    1997, and even had a hit of sorts on local radio, ""2 Step"", but 
    his album was delayed partly because he was boxed in by the group's 
    overzealous leadership. He kept at it, however, and was eventually discovered 
    by Om Records' brass at a Bay Area show he played in 2004.</p><p>
    And now, 11 years after 
    its inception, the 32-year-old MC's debut is finally out, squinting 
    at the sun after having undergone major reconstructive surgery. Gone 
    is its turn-of-the-century <em>Like Water 
    for Chocolate</em>/Black Star vibe in favor of a fairly psychedelic, 
    electronic overhaul that seems to draw as much influence from Radiohead 
    as Common. (There's also reggae, r&amp;b, soul, jazz, and even indie 
    rock in there.) This is certainly for the better; <em>To Serve With Love</em> 
    is that rare future-sounding, cohesive rap album that doesn't really 
    feel like much else out there.</p><p>
    Opener ""To Serve With Love (Intro)"" is a gleeful, quirky, off-beat, Kurzweil 
    2000-crafted electronic tune that shows off Spade's ample 
    ability with a synthesizer. Spade 
    produces all the tracks on this CD, sampling Cheech &amp; Chong DVDs, 
    Flora Purim, and even an uncredited song or two spun backward. Many 
    were recorded in the St. Louis basement studios of Kenautis Smith, a 
    mixer/beatmaker/magician who has produced for approximately every good MC in the lower Midwest (he now lives in Chicago), and the CD is 
    brimming with current and former St. Louis underground talent, including 
    Rockwell Knuckles, Wafeek, and three ex-Soul Tyde members: Coultrain, Spade's younger brother Tef 
    Po, and Gotta Be Karim. Spade, who now spends part of his time in L.A. recording and enjoying 
    the sunshine, also pays respect to his Big Muddy affiliation with a 
    bit of Chingy-style slur on ""Not for the Bullshit"" (""I show you 
    how to do that thurr/ Pay dues but no one currr/ See it's so unfurr.""). 
    </p>
    The album was named for the 
    1967 Sidney Poitier movie <em>To Sir, With Love</em>, and in total it's about Spade's 
    loves-- of girls, friends, possessions, and weirdness, even when said 
    love is destructive. But mostly it's about his endearment for music. 
    This is not the most novel concept, and while one never doubts his sincerity 
    the lyrics aren't quite as interesting as the tunes, full of cute 
    but not really memorable turns like, ""I want to take from the rich 
    and give to the poor/ So we can buy fly shit at the clothing store."" 
    It really doesn't matter too much, though, because this is not a lyricists' 
    album; it's barely even a hip-hop album. ""Everything's gonna be 
    all right,"" he sings on ""Good Crazy"", ""everything's gonna 
    be crazy."" Exactly.</div>"|11232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11232-to-serve-with-love/|7.7|Ben Westhoff

The label's prominence and a growing critical reputation have yet to elevate the awareness of the series to those not predisposed to German electronic music. But <em>Pop Ambient 2007</em> offered the previously unthinkable: a breakout star.  The Field's ""Kappsta"" was the standout track on <em>PA07</em>, nominally the album's least ambient tune but its most pop. ""Kappsta"" helped kick-start the Field's impressive 2007, a year highlighted by as much crossover indie success as a low-key sound architect could ever expect. If ever there were a year for the <em>Pop Ambient</em> series to stake a bigger foothold in the experimental and pop music consciousness, 2007 would've been it.</p><p>
    It's perhaps with this missed opportunity in mind that Kompakt constructed <em>Pop Ambient</em>'s 2008 edition, which with 10 of its 12 tracks provided by artists featured on last year's model (including, no joke, ""Kappsta 2"") is as much <em>Pop Ambient 2007: II</em> as an entirely new entry into the series. It's clear, though, that <em>Pop Ambient</em> is less a showcase for new talents and more an annual hello from the draftiest corners of Kompakt's roster.  Pretty flowers, pretty tones, etc.: <em>Pop Ambient</em> volumes have always benefited from an homogeneity of tempo and wordless sprawl, such that they have always felt very ""album-y.""</p><p>
<em>
    PA08</em> is no different, though if it differs from the other volumes-- even <em>PA07</em>-- it is due to an ever so slight shift towards rhythm and beats. The warm, sunrise tones that so many of <em>Pop Ambient</em>'s tracks have employed are still present, but they more often congeal into patterns that suggest a throbbing or pulsing, if not propulsion or percussion. All (Wolfgang Voigt)'s ""Sag Alles Ab"" is a sly, hypnotic break; Thomas Fehlmann's ""Camilla"" bandies about before finally welcoming in a shallow bass pounding. Markus Guentner's ""Oceans Day"" is all treated guitar brushing against a long drone, but the lapping click that sits under the surface sets it apart. ""Kappsta 2"" improves on its predecessor by sharpening the lines of the vocal loop and adding a muffled kick drum sound to further distinguish the track's linear movement.  </p><p>
    Elsewhere, the composers play with the seasons and sort of generally make good on the ornate foliage that adorns the cover: Klimek's ""The Ice Storm"" is the most aptly named track here, and perhaps the most dynamic as well. A string section waxes in and out of focus as a sharp, high-pitched melody plays over the top producing an effect not unlike William Basinski's looped orchestrations. DJ Koze provides a summery counterpoint with ""Nymphe Und Schäfer"", using a similar loop but placing it under vinyl crackle and an unobtrusive field recording of insects.  </p><p>
    Still, though, with the weight of seven preceding volumes on its shoulders, <em>PA08</em> can't afford the uninspired soundwash of Ulf Lohman's ""My Pazifik"" or Popnoname's ""Fembria"".  <em>Pop Ambient</em> has grown into a bit of institution, a haven for listeners dipping their toes into accessible ambient music or for dedicated electronic fans seeking calm water.  <em>PA08</em> does nothing to distract from this purpose, nor does it expand upon it.  Stasis, right: <em>Pop Ambient</em>'s glacial progression as a series mimics the ""nothing to see here folks, move along"" rallying cry of the artists it houses.  </p></div>"|11279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11279-pop-ambient-2008/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

    Floating around the internet last fall before emerging on a 7"" in November, Fuck Buttons' ""Bright Tomorrow"" proved surprisingly resilient. The duo's blunt repetition of simple elements-- metronomic drum-machine, chugging synth, blissful keyboard, and distorted screams-- seems like a formula for tedium. But the song somehow gets stronger with each replay. For a noise group, Fuck Buttons are surprisingly welcoming-- for noise music, anyway-- and their mix of dreamy melody and abrasive climax evokes strange stylistic bedfellows: Yo La Tengo and Ministry, My Bloody Valentine and Prurient, Spacemen 3 and Black Dice.<br/></p><p>
    ""Bright Tomorrow"" wasn't the web's first glimpse of Fuck Buttons, or even of this album: <em>Street Horrrsing</em> was available for free from the band's website (under a since-forgotten alternate title) when Pitchfork <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/40882-fuck-buttons-sweet-love-for-planet-earth-mp3""><strong>first wrote</strong></a> about the duo in Forkcast more than a year ago. But with the record now seeing official release, anyone hoping for an LP-length version of ""Bright Tomorrow"" will not be disappointed<em></em>. For 50 minutes spread across six tracks, Fuck Buttons craft hypnotic patterns with the same set of sonic tools (plus live-sounding drums, in tribal Boredoms-meets-Animal Collective mode). Long chords drift over oscillating tones and pounding beats. Simple figures build slowly into cresendos punctuated by fiery howls. Sounds and ideas repeat constantly, yet <em>Street Horrrsing</em> never feels redundant.</p><p>
    The key to how Fuck Buttons pull this off lies in their creative origins: Brits Andrew Hung and Benjamin John Power formed the group in 2004 with the goal of creating pain-inducing noise music, but soon became curious about mixing in prettier sounds, and adding structure and melody to their brutal tracks. Still, they never lost the aggression and abstraction of their noise leanings: They're not afraid to let a beat pound forever, or let a drone wash slowly, or let a pedal loop endlessly. Where more traditional groups might worry that a part goes on too long, Fuck Buttons seem fascinated by what will happen if it does, riding it just past the point of expectation before hitting you with the next big switch-up. It's a trick that gives <em>Street Horrrsing</em> a sense of constant tension, with another surprise detonation always looming around the corner.</p><p>
    The album begins with ""Sweet Love For Planet Earth"", whose sparkly synths and pulsing drone bring to mind Gang Gang Dance's starry-eyed explorations. The patient power of that track courses through the rest of this seamless record. It's in the drum circles and chants of ""Ribs Out"", the chopping drift of ""Okay, Let's Talk About Magic"", and the blown-out metal vocals of ""Race You To My Bedroom/Spirit Rise"", which seem to make time melt away. Throughout, Fuck Buttons stick religiously to simple ideas, but mix them in surprising ways. When you expect a scream to burst forward, a synth figure slides in, or a bass rumbles up from the background. Still, the duo's signature is devout repetition. And by the time the loops of album closer ""Colours Move"" finally dissolve, <em>Street Horrrsing</em> has become one big loop itself-- an unbroken sonic circle.

    Crystal
    Castles prefer traveling light. While the hotly-tipped and already
    hotly-contested Toronto duo's basement party set-up doesn't look like
    it'll fill up the passenger seat on a tour van, they also like to play
    fast and loose with their associations. They've remixed at a Hot
    Chip-like pace for everyone from Bloc Party to Uffie to Klaxons, but
    they're not a part of your nu-rave genre (really, who is?), or blog
    house for that matter. Their debut LP partly picks from 7"" and 12""s
    that have been available in some format since 2005, and it's every bit
    as difficult to pin down.<p>
    The lead track samples DFA 1979's ""Dead Womb"" and places those vocals atop a cyclical synth loop
    while they get disembodied and chopped up-- both function as
    song-length hooks. But the thing's called ""Untrust Us"" (natch) and by
    the next one, they're making good on that claim. ""Alice Practice""
    absolutely sears with megaphoned (emphasis on mega) barking and
    Ethan Fawn's Atari-laced keyboards going on the fritz and racking up
    free plays. Ah, so this is what an arcade fire sounds like.</p><p>
    They don't stay in one place for too long, but the body of the album
    can be distilled to an essence of the glassy, ten-lane stare of Last
    Exit with Ed Banger's egg-frying EQ. Well, except when it sounds more
    like ""Alice Practice"" (""Xxzcuzx Me"" and ""Knights"" are a bit interchangeable
    in their diminishing returns). Whether it's a thank you or challenge to
    everyone they've worked with, <em>Crystal Castles</em>
    opens up endless remix possibilities. Though hardly minimal, there's
    plenty to easily pick apart and work with-- ""Good Time"" is a veritable
    toybox with undulating octaves, an almost Eastern-sounding riff and
    tweaked nice-guy vocals which combine the Knife and New Order. Even if
    you can't really make out the words, the call-and-response chant of
    ""Courtship Dating"" glows amidst fizzy synths and Triple 6 drum clicks.
    And ""Crimewave (Crystal Castles vs. HEALTH)"", is a collaboration with
    the LA noisemongers that builds from now-retro electroclash to a
    clattering
    mix of drums.</p><p>
    Just when you think you've gotten your paragraph-long blurb ready for
    the internet's approval, the last two tracks offer a bait and switch;
    the mad dash of ""Black Panther"" is probably what nu-rave was supposed
    to sound like (the Goth! Team?), and then the record ends on a
    disquietingly beautiful shoegaze comedown played on an acoustic guitar
    of all things (""Tell Me What to Swallow""). That they play such hide and
    seek musically should've come as no surprise anyway; despite the fact
    that there's literally an Atari game named ""Crystal Castles"", they named
    themselves after a She-Ra playset, which is like finding out LeBron
    James chose to wear uniform number at #23 as a tribute to his favorite
    Jimmy Eat World song. Then again, it's fitting for a record that draws so much of its power from unpredictability.<br/>

They are at once the seekers and the source of mysterious, mystical art. Led from from tattered subways to temple rubble, flutes to feedback, by their guru Masaki Batoh, their constant motion also allows them to easily elude the reviewer's labels. Not surprisingly, they get lumped in with the psychedelic rockers. It is easy to forget that, before Ghost's stylings puffed over the Pacific like a bloom of hashish smoke, an Eastern echo of King Crimson and Cluster, these six artists chased after a different form of transcendence: improvisation.</p><p>
<em>Overture: Live in Nippon Yusen Soko 2006</em>, their first entirely improvised release, draws a sharper picture of these early days. Actually, it is multimedia: apocalyptic Powerpoint rather than nostalgic Polaroid. (There were even projectors at the venue.) A Yokohama warehouse for mailboats, now an art gallery, lent the eerily vacant, urban-cavern space proper to a Ghost show. Each of the members stood behind tall curtains, veiled from the audience and from each other. A reverent silence was the rule. ""Once the door is closed,"" the crowd was told, ""you cannot enter or exit the space until the performance is ended."" And the boom of the iron door shutting is the record's first sound.</p><p>
    As soon as that crash rumbles outward, trailed by a moment of quiet, we sense how perfectly the acoustic properties of the warehouse suit the band's art. That expanse, that tangible nothingness, is more than negative space. It envelops you like the clouds and waves wrap around Winslow Homer's lonely boaters, making them somehow lonelier and that loneliness more heroic. Likewise when Michio Kurihara lays siege to the venue's architectural emptiness with his electric guitar, it feels like a struggle against cosmic emptiness. Ultimately that is the mood of <em>Overture</em>. While it does feel introspective, this wandering inward is no cakewalk: it is a bumpy travel through turmoil and discord and nonstop tension.</p><p>
    Every element seems to partake in this shakiness. Cymbals and shakers tinkle in the shadows, a steady radiation of yellow-wallpaper delirium that never quite lets up. Meanwhile, battling out center stage, you always find a brilliant rivalry of sensibility. Taishi Takizawa's saxophone reels out these stretched-out ribbons of film-noir sadness, for instance, which calmly coexist with Kazuo Ogino's lute as a union of the country and the city, the forest and the dark alley. Any instrument, any musician, can go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde without warning. One minute, Takizawa's playing is sober and serene; the next it assumes a frantic, trash-compacted quality that is nearer in spirit to free jazz. The same goes for Ogino's piano improvisations, which unfold without drama at many points, only to incarnate it, in full-on Max Steiner mode, at others.</p><p>
    While it may not push the band's aesthetic forward, <em>Overture</em> serves as a document of the band's astonishing evolution. Batoh has drafted the old gang, from Takizawa to Ogino to Kurihara, and recreated the searching, schizophrenic vibe of their self-titled debut. Beyond merely evoking their beginnings, the record follows their restless quest for a higher consciousness: from the idyllic, acid-folk woodwinds and finger-picking to the more brooding and hypnotic Krautrock rhythms, rewinding all the way back to the AMM order and Colemanesque chaos of their jam-session roots. Overture may not attract long-time fans, who have already experienced this variety. Nevertheless, even at 56 minutes, this is a warp-speed tour of Ghost's 20-year history of genre bending and blending.</p></div>"|11270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11270-overture-live-in-nippon-yusen-soko-2006/|7.6|Roque Strew

    Al Jourgensen hates George W. Bush. And Dick Cheney. Hell, republicans in general. <em>The Last Sucker</em>, Ministry's 11th and ""last"" studio album, as well as the final piece in his anti-Bush trilogy that also includes 2004's <em>Houses of the Molé</em> and 2006's <em>Rio Grande Blood</em>, makes that pretty clear. Again. The subject matter of the 11 tracks should be familiar territory for Ministry fans or anyone who's attended a collegiate anti-war rally-- typical, tame anti-Bush shit, but Jourgensen sounds so angry, it hardly matters what he's
    ranting about. Like, you don't need to give a shit about Satan to get into
    Marduk or Gorgoroth-- it's the bleak, intense atmosphere that's conjured.</p><p>
<em>The Last Sucker</em> does have powerful <em>sonic</em> moments. The amped Texas two-step of ""Let's Go""'s like an updated ""Jesus Built My Hotrod"", despite an incredibly goofy vocal sample. The guitar parts on it are intense. The fuzzed bass and nu metal chops of ""Watch Yourself""-- divorced from the ""Big Brother"" theme-- has some chunky riffs and head-wagging grooves. And it is pretty rousing when Jourgensen shouts, ""There's no running away/ This is the U.S.A."" Likely because it sounds like it could be a chant that means a thousand different things. The non-specificity works.</p><p>
    One of the best tracks, ""Die in a Crash"", maintains whiplash intensity throughout, upping it a tad for an ""I can feel it/ I can feel the pressures of this life"" chorus that, as I write this, should be going over well in gymnasiums everywhere. Jourgensen also turns in a fun cover of ""Roadhouse Blues"", which is prefaced by an ""All I wanna do is get my kicks before this whole shithouse goes up in flames."" And get his ""kicks"" he does.  
    </p>
<p>
    The percussive ""Death &amp; Destruction"" pieces together Bush's creepy laugh (sounding <em>very</em> devilish) and a bunch of samples from the big guy that fit with and echo the title. Then Jourgensen puts his back into it. ""The Last Sucker"" is another catchy tune that traces Bush-- ""I never studied but I got my degree/ I didn't need to with my family tree""-- in all the usual ways. The best example of the weak content destroying an otherwise enjoyable track is ""The Dick Song""-- explosive musically, but the dorky samples and ""run run run Cheney's got a gun"" chorusing feel like a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. On the other hand, samples are put to good use on ""No Glory"", which discusses the pointlessness of the war in Iraq, punctuating the buzzing instrumentation with a-capella spoken ""greed,"" ""power,"" and ""corruption."" It creates a dynamic, instead of stealing the band's thunder.
    </p>
<p>
    In the end, though, <em>The Last Sucker</em> goes out in a blaze of glory, largely because the last three songs are also the album's best. First is the aforementioned ritalin-chomping ""Die in a Crash"" and then ""End of Days"", Parts I and II. Fear Factory's Burton Christopher Bell adds vocals to all three. The two ""End of Days"" tracks are a combined 14 minutes long. The first part is more of the nu-metal, Bell howling and barking angrily: ""Judgment day's upon us and I see no one cares,"" etc. Kinda sounds like Fear Factory. The second is a long, somber, meditation on the end of things. The vocal part is kinda Vincent Price-in-""Thriller""-- and there's a fucking kid's choir! Threaded into the end of the piece, too, is Eisenhower's well-known farewell speech. Pretend it's Jourgensen speaking, because it is: End of Bush, end of the world, end of Ministry. It's his State of the Union. The last words conjured by Ministry before Eisenhower checks the mic are ""Face down on pavement and drunk at the end of my days/ The end of days."" Defusing the pomp, it's a suitable ending to an overblown exeunt.  
    </p>
<p>
    Otherwise, <em>The Last Sucker</em> isn't as huge as <em>Psalm 69</em>, but it is Ministry's
    most exciting record since. Just don't go into it thinking you'll get any astute politicizing -- but then,
    that's not what we go to Ministry for, right? And, as tear-jerky as the finale is, this isn't the end for Uncle Al! A covers collection called <em>Cover Up</em>-- with takes on the Stones, Beatles, and others-- should be out soon.  And he's basically halting Ministry so he can spend time building the stable at his label, 13th Planet, a subsidiary of Megaforce. Plus, the final tour-- the he ""C-U-LaTour""-- includes Meshuggah as a supporting act. So, even if you're showing up to theater to see the Swedish tech-metal gods bring their brilliant, apocalyptic <em>obZen</em> to life, Ministry should have some new jams to keep you interested. Though I imagine the between-song bantor could get pretty painful.

That's a little mean, but I can't help feeling equally frustrated (and sleepy) when I find that, two albums into their career, the Big Sleep still haven't fully harvested the crop  of mind-blowing music they take half-hearted stabs at emulating. Unlike so many other similarly knowledgable bands, the Sleep's fatal flaw isn't poor taste or a sycophantic rehashing of their influences-- they just need a shot in the arm, something to remind them of the power of rocking out.</p><p>
<em>Sleep Forever</em>, like its predecessor <em>Son of the Tiger</em>, contains mostly instrumental tracks, an odd move considering that the band's most notable songs have used vocals. Riding the momentum from <em>Tiger </em>standout ""Murder"", this album's highlight ""Bad Blood"" follows the Pretty Girls Make Graves formula to similar success, with bassist Sonya Balchandan's vocals remaining icy despite the searing guitar riffs and chugging percussion accompanying her. Coupled with ""Pinkies"", a head-in-clouds dream pop song somewhere between TV on the Radio and Coldplay, these two melodic tracks constitute the crux of <em>Sleep Forever</em>. Excepting the impressive two-minute powder keg ""Tigers in our Hearts"", the rest of <em>Sleep Forever</em> struggles to maintain a pulse-- a desired quality only when they shoegaze. Drone instrumental ""Slow Race"", for example, smacks of Mogwai's ""Like Herod"", and the filching's worsened by a ""climactic"" guitar line that predictably walks down the scale. The tragically named ""Chorus of Guitars"" buckles even more, attempting to build a wall of sound with a flimsy piano line and languishing, scattershot vocals.</p><p>
    Lacking the necessary grandeur to pull off godlike post-rock, the band mines some instrumental gems when they set their sights on more nuanced numbers. The cartoonish swagger of ""The Big Guns"" sounds like the Octopus Project 'roid raging-- not tough enough to soundtrack an actual fight, but perfectly suitable playing in a <em>Double Dragon</em> stage. The latin-inspired acoustic ballad ""Little Sister"" represents an even bolder experiment, and while they don't quite pull it off the track succeeds as a welcome changeup. Unfortunately the Big Sleep is faced with the problem of mystifying a doomsday post-rock sound that's very familiar to fans of the genre, and it's a fight they're often not up for. Despite its slightly more diverse palette, <em>Sleep Forever</em> merely dabbles in more styles rather than explores them, and as soon as their creative finger slips off the pleasure button, it's hard to resist from dozing.</p></div>"|11227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11227-sleep-forever/|5.3|Adam Moerder

    Where we're going, we don't need roads. Remember with me, if you will, a time when cocaine was as rampant as synthesizers. When a wave of unprecedented M&amp;A activity and yuppie-style prosperity was driving Wall Street to record heights. Sequels and superhero movies dominated at the box office, while starlets with limited discernible musical talent were releasing remarkably enduring pop songs. A conservative Republican was in the White House, giving aid and comfort to Iran as if he were someone who wasn't quite all there.</p><p>
    I'm talking, as you know if you're reading two words ahead, about 2006, when Gruff Rhys and Boom Bip first announced their collaboration under the name Neon Neon. Just as a yearning for the 60s characterized much of the indie pop and indie rock of the 1980s-- from R.E.M.'s jingle-jangle mourning to C86's ""perfect pop"" to the slowed-down garage-y guitar heroics of Dinosaur Jr.-- so the memory of the 1980s has dominated certain music circles in recent years. Whether electrohouse, new wave, new rave, synth-pop, Miami bass, Detroit techno, Chicago house, Italo disco, Balearic, or, most recently, the revival of what used to be called ""world music"", the 80s have left their mark on the YouTube era. Now if only the 49ers could win four Super Bowls again.</p><p>
    Rhys, solo artist and frontman for Welsh psych-poppers Super Furry Animals, and Boom Bip, the electronic/hip-hop producer known to his folks as Bryan Hollon, bring an eclectic background to the early-1980s revival. For an album conceived two years ago<em>, Stainless Style</em> captures a lot of what's been in the past few years' zeitgeist-- from Alan Braxe and Fred Falke's ""Rubicon"" to Chromeo and Cool Kids (if not quite all the way to Yeasayer); a recent Neon Neon ""influences"" mix included the Italian prog song that lays the foundation for Justice's ""Phantom"". And then the bright, 1980s-style guitar pop, murky electro rap, and cybernetic white-boy funk make for an album that upends some of the stereotypes about the hollowness of sleek 80s chrome. Hey, there's heart behind all this silvery excess.
    </p>
<p>
    The more melodic, Rhys-fronted tunes sped up on me first, and they're also the most chronologically displaced. Bizarre Princess Leia brush-off ""I Told Her on Aderaan"" puts the Cars beneath 1980s snare sounds, angelic synths, kitschy spoken-word interjections, and one of the catchiest choruses so far this year. The midtempo candidate for a weepy beach break-up music video, ""Steel Your Girl"", comes close, with chiming soft-rock guitars and phased keyboard. ""Video games are nothing but illusion,"" Rhys begins. Factory farewell ""Belfast"" leans more toward wistful Duran Duran synth-pop. To all this, the herky-jerk call-and-response ""Dream Girls"" and shades-are-good electro creep-out ""Michael Douglas"" are wrecks by comparison. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not that there's a clear divide between songs where Rhys seems dominant and ones where Boom Bip takes over. Raquel Welch ode ""Raquel"" and its Miami Sound Machine (and then Run-D.M.C.) beats comes closest to melding the SFA frontman's skewed pop vision and Hollon's electro-conscious hip-hop. On ""I Lust U"", meanwhile, Rhys duets with Welsh singer Cate Le Bon, trading one-liners on an Italo-tinged dream not too far from something like Simian Mobile Disco's ""I Believe"". Spank Rock and Sean Tillman get in a couple of snappy verses amid the Prince-ly groove and <em>Midnite Vulture</em>-isms of Har Mar Superstar on first single ""Trick for Treat"". A messed-up title pun and Rhys's fuzzed-out oddness sort of redeem Yo Majesty's heavy-breathing shtick on ""Sweat Shop"" (where's Missy Elliott?), but Fatlip's scene-setting rap on ""Luxury Pool"" is more biography than biopic, helped by a hiccuping, fame-pimping hook.
    </p>
<p>
    As a crossover side project involving an artist linked to 1990s Britpop, Neon Neon were bound to get compared to Gorillaz. <em>Stainless Style</em> is more consistent as an album than Damon Albarn's output with his first non-Blur group, and the potential hits, for what it's worth, hit equally hard. ""Oh, how many are my foes?/ How many rise against me?"" Rhys sings, with a choir of himself, on the title track and finale. Tuneful and engaging, though not flawless, <em>Stainless Style</em> holds a mirror up to a generation of 1980s nostalgia and, by warmly and humorously depicting a human being behind the bizarre rise and fall an engineer playboy, reminds us there's more to that most notoriously superficial decade than, well, surfaces. There's Huey Lewis, for example.

    Snoop Dogg was more famous for being famous than for rapping long before the E! network gave him a reality show. His pimp persona hardened into shtick at least a decade ago, and music has felt like an afterthought for him ever since he embarked on an endless run of stoner-comedy cameos. The dangerous urgency and viciously charismatic lean of his early <em>Doggystyle</em> peak are distant memories. And yet he's somehow managed to evolve into a model of gangsta consistency, a sort of rap version of Tom Petty or Alan Jackson. He cranks out lazy, effortless hits at a scary clip, slightly tweaking his formula as the musical climate changes without ever leaving his comfort zone. On ""Neva Have 2 Worry"", the fifth track of his ninth album, Snoop reminds us that he ""ain't never went gold""; every one of those previous eight albums sold a million copies. Those numbers are worldwide, not domestic, but still. He's doing something right.</p><p>
    ""Neva Have 2 Worry"" is a lean autobiographical track, but it's not a frustrated emo-memoir like Nas' ""Last Real Nigga Alive"" or Bun B's ""The Story"". Snoop doesn't do self-disclosure. Rather than giving us inside glimpses of his triumphs and failures, Snoop calmly recites his accomplishments, taking quick pauses to remind us of his murder trial and to defend himself from accusations of misogyny by kicking more misogyny. We don't learn anything from ""Neva Have 2 Worry"", but it <em>sounds</em> great: Snoop's craggy sing-song purr sinking deep into his own lush, smooth, low-key track. It doesn't reward close attention, but it fills the air beautifully.</p><p>
    That's true of almost all of <em>Ego Trippin'</em>. Snoop says basically nothing new over the course of the album's way-excessive 21 tracks, but he usually sounds good saying it, and the expansive, expensive production gives him the sort of luxuriant bed that few rappers can afford anymore. First single ""Sexual Eruption"" might find Snoop cooing though one of T-Pain's vocoders and extolling the virtues of bedtime reciprocity, but those tweaks are subtle; it's not like Snoop is diving headlong into feminism or electro. Rather, the slight, unremarkable track seems to exist mostly as an excuse for its retro-VHS video than as a song in its own right. That video is the best thing Snoop's done in years, a better vehicle for his sly, self-aware persona than any of the songs on this album. And yet there's something encouraging about endless confidence and professionalism on display here. In a time when the rap industry is in serious money-drain tumult, Snoop sounds as unperturbed as ever, and better for it.</p><p>
    Many of the tracks on <em>Ego Trippin'</em> come from some iteration of the newly-formed QDT, a production trio of Snoop, new jack swing architect and former Blackstreet frontman Teddy Riley, and g-funk architect and former convict DJ Quik. All of these guys are pros, and it's great to hear Snoop using his enviable position to play patron to those two underrated pop veterans. Quik's beat for ""Press Play"" is all fluid soul-rap, its Isley Brothers sample twittering gorgeously over its rippling guitars and horn-stabs. And on ""SD Is Out"", Riley somehow pulls off the neat trick of crafting a lush snap beat, its spare production absolutely at home in its pillowy layers of bass and vocoders. But tracks as pretty as these can't erase the sad reality that Snoop is running through trite pimp-life clichés for the billionth time, talking about macking hoes with Leonardo DiCaprio and never quite sounding enthused about the women he's reportedly fucking. Even the love song he dedicates to his wife turns out to be more about Snoop's globe-trotting exploits than anything resembling actual sentiment.</p><p>
    So it comes as a relief whenever Snoop deviates from his usual talking-points to give us the odd stylistic curveball. And those curveballs can often be pretty great on their own merits, as when Snoop covers the Time's Minneapolis new-wave funk manifesto ""Cool"", singing in a self-obsessed whine about diamonds on his toes while Riley faithfully recreates the original's Princely synths. And then there's the utterly inexplicable country-fried ""My Medicine"", which Snoop dedicates to ""my main man Johnny Cash, a real American gangster"" before intoning ""Grand Ole Opry, here we come"" and sing-rapping about weed over Everlast's respectable Tennessee Three pastiche. It's the closest thing we've ever had to a straight-up country song from one of the world's most recognizable rappers, and it's also a celebration of drugs dedicated to a beloved figure whose pill habit almost killed him more than once; I sort of can't believe it exists.
    </p>
<p>
    As batshit awesome as ""My Medicine"" is, the best two moments of <em>Ego Trippin'</em> are its two last songs, ""Why Did You Leave Me"" and ""Can't Say Goodbye"", both wide-open heartbroken emo-pop-soul lilts on which Snoop sounds more like an actual human being rather than a walking catchphrase dispenser. The first is a generous, bedraggled breakup track with an absurdly catchy beat from Hitboy and Polow da Don; three months from now, it'll probably be inescapable. And on the second, Snoop and the Gap Band's Charlie Wilson moan empathy for the people who share their backgrounds over a gorgeously elegiac Riley track. These are some grown-up songs, and Snoop probably has a whole album of them somewhere in him. But as long as the pothead-pimp shtick keeps selling, we'll probably never hear it.

    According to their website, the full name of Malmø, Sweden's
    the LK is The Love of Kevin, Colour, Chaos and the Sound of K (no word on how
    to say that in Swedish). This ungainly phrase, wisely abbreviated for general
    use, seems like an oblique reference to member Lindefelt's synaesthesia, which
    causes him to mentally associate colors with timbres. Synaesthesia's one of
    those weird brain glitches that seems like it could actually be cool to have,
    though I imagine that for those afflicted, the novelty value of being able to
    see sounds isn't quite as apparent. Lindefelt's partner in the LK, Fredrik,
    can't see sounds, but is apparently a good chef.</p><p>
    Both men have their own projects-- Fredrik's is a band called
    Fredrik, and Lindefelt performs solo electroacoustic shows with his cello-- but
    together they make some pretty awesome synth-pop. The music has a spiky
    immediacy, with Lindefelt's vocals way up front, backed by sharp beats and
    electronic collages. Fredrik's guitar and Fender Rhodes provides the harmonic
    structure, but the timbres of the instruments are rounded off and subsumed into
    the overall texture. It's a sound superficially similar to the Cansecos and Russian
    Futurists.</p><p>
    The key to the album's infectiousness, though, lies not so
    much in the vocals as in the bouncy basslines that percolate at the bottom of
    the songs. ""Tamagotchi Freestyle"" rides one of these , a disco-worthy
    descending phrase that perfectly backs up the instrumental hook, which Fredrik
    swaps between guitar and cornet. The lyrics mercifully skip any references to
    the once-ubiquitous digi-pets of the title in favor of calls to burn Elvis
    alive, and the immolation of a pop icon has never sounded quite this appealing. 
    </p>
<p>
    I would've called ""Tamagotchi Freestyle"" a standout, but
    frankly by that standard half the album would be standouts. In addition to
    being a good pop record, it's a good details record-- dig the echoing pings and
    odd, watery guitar tone on closer ""Yellow Ribbons"", for instance. ""Stop Being
    Perfect"" has a great verse melody to set up the chorus, but the bed of
    electronic tones that worms its way through the beat is just as interesting.
    Then there are the staccato blasts the underpin the beginning of ""Private Life
    of a Cat""-- what are they made of? It sounds like guitar and trumpet and white
    noise all smashed together to make one sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    And speaking of cats, one of mine
    was completely freaked out by the way the backing vocals on ""Eurovision"" are
    injected into the song. He was convinced the sound was coming from someone in
    the room. The album hits a bit of a lull toward the end, with a few slow
    tracks that don't grab with nearly the force of their neighbors, but overall <em>The LK Vs. the Snow</em> is a sharp
    collection of songs that keeps pulling me back for more.

But he's also a fine and patient formalist, most of whose work is built on formal constraints; a typical Youngs record from his Jagjaguwar era is an extended exploration of a particular idea, usually meditative and melodic, ""singer-songwriter"" music from a distance but rather more peculiar when you pay close attention.</p><p>
<em>
    Autumn Response</em> is constructed around what might be some kind of divided-consciousness metaphor. What sounds at first like Youngs' voice and acoustic guitar recorded with heavy slapback echo quickly resolves itself into what's actually going on: A pair (or more) of overdubbed copies of Youngs playing the same song, not quite in synch. At the beginning of the album, sometimes one voice follows the other by a few seconds; sometimes they harmonize by accident; sometimes they're separated by a fraction of a second, so that they sound like Youngs is singing in the old Sun studio.</p><p>
    Before long, the second voice deviates a little from what the first is singing, or sings a different note or two, or a single voice may actually be enhanced by delay and echo. ""One Hundred Stranded Horses"" introduces a third voice, interrupting the first two mid-verse to interject a few related lines of its own. ""How many horses in the wood?"" Youngs sings. ""How many running free? How many horses are in the bay, and how many on TV?"" (The song was written in 2006, too early to be a response to M.I.A.'s ""Boyz"", but you can sing it to the same tune if you like.) </p><p>
    These songs are more or less of a piece-- Youngs' lyrics are evocative but nonspecific (""sound through the night and the color of day""), and he repeats and shuffles individual phrases, sometimes altering them a little, weighing each one for its value. As usual, Youngs takes his time getting where he's going, playing simple repeating riffs and creeping forward to the next chord whenever it pleases him. The guitar part to ""Paths in the City"" is nothing more than a five-note figure, duplicated hundreds of times (by hand, or digitally? it's hard to tell) and scattered in clumps until it sounds like a bizarre set of wind chimes. The shortest song here is under a minute and a half long; the longest, the concluding ""Something Like Air"", is more than 16 minutes long, and doesn't seem appreciably longer. By the end of that final piece, Youngs' voices have diverged from each other almost completely in words and tone, as if the song they're singing is no longer the same. It's a static record, even by Youngs' standards, but its near-stasis is the source of its loveliness. You can let it run its duration, hearing the slow moiré patterns rippling over its surface while you wait for something to happen, or you can focus on it and be swept away by how alive and complicated those ripples are.</p></div>"|11249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11249-autumn-response/|7.4|Douglas Wolk

    The ever-present guitars and tight, unpredictable rhythms on the Exit
    Strategy's latest cover familiar ground, to be sure, but the band play

    paves the way for a fade in of cascading quick strums, but it's a
    fake-out for the beefier, syncopated strut of ""X-Rays"". Its lyrics are
    vague
    (""performing research, performing X-rays from A to Z""), but the hook is
    broad and quickly ingratiating, and the ominous full-band patter of the
    bridge is where the Exit
    Strategy flash a little instrumental muscle. More manic
    Muppet Show drums bring in ""Addition by Subtraction"", along with a
    properly snaky guitar line and a breathless tempo throughout.</p><p>
    There are some obvious references in the songs on <em>Fear of Microphones</em>,
    but the Exit
    Strategy, rather than revive any one band or scene's particular sound, nod to any band that they likely grew up on. There's a line between staying varied
    trying to sound like more than a few bands at once, and it's that
    balancing act that here keeps the Exit Strategy from asserting any real
    personality of their own. Take the first few moments of
    ""Motorcade"", which is essentially what the opening of Jawbox's ""Savory""
    would sound like if sped up from 33 to 45 rpm-- bear in mind that J.
    Robbins actually recorded this album, so playing it in front of him
    must have taken, as the Brits say, considerable cheek. Still,
    ""Motorcade"" is the track where the band lays all it's cards on the
    table: working up a tense and furious rhythm in the verses, alternating
    quickly between clipped octaves and wide-armed strums, and soon adding
    whole new counterpoint from the guitar, they pile on the changes and make three minutes feel a whole lot longer.</p><p>
    But while the Exit
    Strategy take a bite off of Jawbox or name one of their songs
    after a familiar XTC lyric (turn your monitor upside down at the end of
    this review to read the answer!), they make these offhand references
    without bringing the same studiousness to their own sound. Despite the
    energy of the first three tracks, ""System of Youth"" aims for the woozy
    lurch that bands like the Jesus Lizard were so good at, and makes an
    awkward fit for  the Exit Strategy. Elsewhere, the full stops in ""What the
    Fuck is Low Art?"" nod to Fugazi's
    ""Repeater"", though you may be
    distracted by the singer's strange accents on every other syllable, getting
    higher each time, like singing can stave off his narcolepsy. Singer
    Mark Constantino has a brighter, almost cheerful voice that suits songs
    like the opener just fine, and adds a youthful, spirited feel to many
    of these tracks. But his refrains can be just silly (""X-Rays""; ""The
    First The Finest The Future""), and it's awkward to hear him adopt a
    neurotic talk/sing style on ""Judas Kiss"".
    </p>
<p>
    The band keeps things interesting, the rhythm section especially--
    while the punk discipline and dub-leaning ear of Fugazi is a clear
    influence, they actually do a fair impersonation, adding double-time on the
    early songs like ""Addition by Subtraction"" or a global flavor to the
    bridge of ""Judas Kiss"". There's really no need to mimic or steal when
    your band is clearly capable of subtlety. ""All Circuits Are Dead""
    features some of the same spring-like guitar work as Don Caballero, but
    in this song and in the the album's best moments, the band has the
    momentum to make up any lack of originality. The Exit Strategy aren't
    really concerned with changing the face of the musical landscape, and
    that's fine. But as a group of flexible and talented players, they
    should be more worried about finding their own voice.

    one of indie rap's leading stars by the end of 2000, and he did it with a pair
    of albums that couldn't be much more diverse: <em>Deltron 3030</em>, a conceptual
    space-rap opera about an AWOL mech soldier turned supernaturally powered anti-corporate
    freedom fighter, and <em>Both Sides of the Brain</em>, where his
    lyrics concerned things like Dreamcast games and weed and people who smell
    really bad. The next year, he appeared on two singles from the smash hit
    Gorillaz album-- a brush with mainstream pop fame he capitalized on by dropping
    a few verses on Hieroglyphics' <em>Full Circle</em> in 2003 and then disappearing from the public radar almost
    completely save the occasional guest spot. This wouldn't be the first time Del's
    been on semi-hiatus; 1993's <em>No Need for Alarm</em> took seven years to
    receive a mass-market solo follow-up, thanks in part to Elektra terminating his
    contract and relegating 1998's lost classic <em>Future Development</em> to a
    delayed indie distribution four years later. But there's still cause to wonder
    how much popular momentum Del
    might have lost by ducking into the sidelines all these years.</p><p>
    Especially once you take into
    account how much momentum he's retained in just about every other department,
    at least if <em>11<sup>th</sup> Hour </em>is any indication. Del's newest album and first for Definitive Jux is a
    straightforward and uncluttered record that flows surprisingly naturally for an
    album that's been so repeatedly delayed. Part of this could be credited to the
    production: This is one of those strange records where you forget most of the
    beats 15 minutes after you put away the CD but get completely hooked by them
    while they're playing. Del's production skills have been largely underrated as
    one of the things that keeps his albums held together, and he's stated in a few
    interviews that the beats on <em>The 11<sup>th</sup> Hour</em> came before the
    lyrics did-- maybe it's not obvious at first, but once it sinks in how that
    unobtrusive digital funk is complemented and augmented by a voice that knows
    every in and out of the beat's mechanical structure and jabs back at it in
    intricate ways, the more that the production's unpretentious simplicity makes
    perfect sense.</p><p>
    As a lyrical exhibition, almost
    everything that makes Del the MC he is is in full effect: A taunting, sing-songy
    flow, internal rhymes that remain intricate without getting too convoluted or
    highfalutin', and the tendency to mix tightly-packed gymnastic verbiage and
    straightforward talk. One vital component that's missing, however, is the
    detailed storytelling and earthy day-to-day humor that informed records like <em>Both
    Sides of the Brain </em>and 1991 debut <em>I Wish My Brother George Was Here</em>
    alike. What we're mostly left with, aside from a few stress-rap cuts like the
    self-conscious ""Hold Your Hand"" and the anti-rumormongering ""I'll Tell You"", is
    Del sticking to one aspect of his subject repertoire-- his skills. He's got 'em, you don't, he likes MCing and making beats, rocking
    crowds because he's good at it-- yeah, it's the alpha and omega of rap lyricism
    to big up yourself, and it's not anything Del can't back up. But
    the more he flaunts it-- on ""Raw Sewage"", ""Bubble Pop"", ""Naked Fonk"", ""I'll
    Tell You"", ""Workin' It""-- the less it seems to stand out from one boast to the
    next. It actually comes as a relief when he manages to express it as a
    basketball metaphor (""Slam Dunk""), which says a lot coming from someone who sat
    through that tiresome Dan the Automator <em>NBA</em> <em>2K7 </em>comp in its
    entirety.
    </p><p>
    Still, for an album that pushes the limits of how much you can say about
    so little, the stuff that's said rarely fails to be entertaining in the pure
    linguistically structural sense. That aforementioned flow of Del's prods into
    your subconscious when you're focusing on anything but the lyrics, like you're
    hearing fragments of a spirited conversation in an adjacent room, and when you
    switch your attention to the words themselves they click so well it's almost
    hard to believe they sound like that and still make some kind of sense, even if
    they look perfectly normal on paper. (One highlight, from ""Last Hurrah"": ""The
    faintest notions that they're finna get some/ It's dumb, I spit some of this
    wickedest wisdom"".) And the barrage of lyrics is exhausting without being
    tedious, with endlessly-parseable knots of phraseology and weird little asides
    everywhere to keep your attention. With the battle-centric focus of <em>No Need
    for Alarm </em>given an additional 15 years' worth of experience and
    perspective, <em>The 11<sup>th</sup> Hour </em>is a tight and ruthlessly
    efficient 48 minutes of boasting-- if only its lyrical personality was as
    outsize as the voice delivering it.

    Montreal's music scene is 
    like a clown car: just when you think it couldn't possibly have room 
    to contain any more talent, some more emerge. The City of Saints can 
    already lay claim to Billboard chart-toppers (Arcade Fire), Polaris Prize 
    winners (Patrick Watson), punky Francophone ambassadors (We Are Wolves), 
    no-wave revivalists (Les George Leningrad), noise rockers (AIDS Wolf), 
    rappers (Gage), electro-funk party-starters (Chromeo) worldly indie 
    pranksters (Islands), plus all the members of Wolf Parade and their 
    many side projects. And now it can add ambitious, sun-baked trio Plants 
    And Animals to the ranks of its growing community of celebrated 
    musicians.</p><p>
    Like a distant Canadian cousin 
    of Blitzen Trapper, this three-piece spins shaggy songs into expansive, 
    genre-bending symphonies. And though last year's too-brief <em>
    With/Avec</em> EP hinted at Plants and Animals' expansiveness, it didn't 
    fully prepare listeners for <em>Parc 
    Avenue</em>, a sprawling collection of rootsy melodies, majestic 
    arrangements, and classic rock riffs that owes as much to jam-band 
    psychedelia and it does to delicately orchestrated chamber-folk.  <br/></p><p>
    The album kicks off with ""Bye Bye Bye"", which sounds, initially, like a Coldplay ballad led by Neil Young. But, mere seconds into the 
    song, it explodes into a choral epic built on a foundation of jaunty 
    pianos and embellished with plangent autoharp runs and bursts of stately 
    brass. Tellingly, the track's infectious climax is more satisfying because it comes in fits and starts, its anthemic 
    build interrupted several times by quiet interludes of noodley folk.  <br/>
</p>
<p>
    That, in short, <em>is</em> Plants 
    And Animals. They offer up explosive, Polyphonic Spree-sized choir choruses, 1970s AM radio guitars, cozy folk balladry, and rambling stoner boogie-often 
    in the course of one song-- and switch between them with little warning. 
    Many of their songs clock in at over five minutes long, but that's 
    all the better for them to pick up steam, stylistically mutate, or expand. 
    ""Faerie Dance"", which also appeared on the EP, explores 
    multiple genres and tempos within its seven-minute run. Its dreamy opening 
    is marked by ethereal backing vocals, but then gives way to 
    a wiry, disorienting guitar melody that churns in opposition to melodramatic 
    strings. Just when you've given in to its post-rock vertigo, a lackadaisically 
    strummed guitar pushes the tune into slacker-blues territory à la <em>
    Mellow Gold</em>. Likewise, the album's centerpiece, ""Mercy"", marries 
    a Phish-like guitar vamp and jazzy, cymbal-heavy drumming to Go-Team!-ish 
    cheerleader chants and handclaps. Saxophone belches add some welcome 
    hard-edges to the loosey-goosey jam, and singer Warren Spicer offers, 
    as counterpoint to the chipper cheering, a growling Sean Connery impression.  
    </p>
<p>
    Spicer's lithe tenor, in 
    fact, proves malleable over the course of the album, adapting 
    to dispassionate talk-singing, raggedy country warbling, and arty, dramatic 
    vibrato. His Beck impersonation on ""Faerie Dance"" is followed by 
    ""Feedback in the Field"", on which he cops a convincing Tom Petty 
    accent (""Somethin' in the air to-nye-ite""). ""New Kind of Love"" 
    begins like a spare Iron &amp; Wine ballad, but builds to theatrical, 
    Arcade Fire levels of orchestral splendor. And 
    on ""Sea Shanty""-- which starts out like Ryan Adams' ""Amy"", 
    minus the confessional self-pity, and evolves into meandering Lynyrd 
    Skynyrd-style Southern rock-- Spicer is able to affect a 
    honeyed croon.  
    </p>
<p>
    From its scrawled, lower-case liner notes 
    (complete with mistakes and cross-outs) to its sound, everything about <em>Parc Avenue</em> 
    feels homemade. Its analog recording, which took place, in part, in 
    Spicer's apartment, crackles with warmth and intimacy, and because 
    the guest artists who fill out these orchestrations (including Arcade 
    Fire/Bell Orchestre's Sarah Neufeld) are friends of the band, a sense 
    of camaraderie prevails. Plants and Animals may not be the first band 
    to put Montreal on the musical map, but, with this album's there's-no-place-like-home 
    vibe, they are certainly the first to celebrate it so warmly.

    Too often, it seems, songwriters 
    must choose between the intimate and the anthemic. Portland, Oregon's 
    A Weather, however, have managed to create an album full of songs that 
    are both sonically expansive and painstakingly private. Their debut 
    full-length is bursting with intricately plotted melodies and lush arrangements 
    that sound like they were made in a bedroom, but meant for a ballroom.  <br/></p><p>
    Sure, the news angle here is 
    how a relatively unknown quintet from the Rose City snagged an opening 
    slot on last year's Bright Eyes tour and a spot on Team Love's roster. 
    But, despite their organic instrumentation and reluctance to deviate 
    from sad, slow songs, they have little in common with their labelmates, 
    and thus Conor Oberst's involvement is a mere parenthetical to the 
    real story: these elaborately plush songs. Like Beach House without 
    the gossamer reverb or Stars stripped of their most upbeat pop impulses, 
    A Weather uses warm organs, folk-influenced guitars and the hushed interplay 
    between the male and female vocalists to weave a tapestry of tenderly 
    crafted chamber-pop that pays as much attention to its straightforward 
    choruses as it does to its evocative details.</p><p>
    Singer/drummer Sarah Winchester 
    has an emotive yet controlled coo reminiscent of Aimee Mann's, and sexy, 
    sad album opener ""Spiders, Snakes"" sounds like ""Save Me"" from 
    the <em>Magnolia</em> soundtrack if Mann's version was fleshed out by 
    fuller instrumentation and complemented by breathy male vocals. (Also, 
    notably, that track references Bedhead, another band that knew that 
    slow and somber didn't mean boring.) 
    </p>
<p>
    Those male vocals are provided 
    by frontman Aaron Gerber, who, against his partner's Mannish tones, 
    shapeshifts his winsome, pliant voice into disparate pop guises depending 
    on each song's mood. For ""Pilot's Arrow"", a muted acoustic number 
    that uses flight as a metaphor for a failing romance (and, curiously, 
    finds Gerber singing to his drummer by name), he gets in touch with 
    his inner whispery Elliott Smith. And on ""Hanging Towers of Baltimore"", 
    he embodies the creamy-smooth tenor of Paul Simon, which is apt since 
    the track softly alludes to the parts of <em>Graceland</em> that Vampire 
    Weekend didn't already steal.  
    </p>
<p>
    Though the interaction between 
    Gerber and Winchester's voices is the dramatic throughline of the 
    album, its heart is her drumming. She plays a threadbare three-piece 
    set, but its sparseness anchors these tracks-whether they're plumped 
    with layers of instruments or spare and folky-in immediacy. ""Pinky 
    Toe"", which takes the most familiar and banal hurt in the world (that 
    of stubbing a toe) and turns it into a meditation on personal pain, 
    builds anticipation with its raindrop-delicate percussion simmering 
    against the withholding electric guitar line that never seems to fully 
    fill out its melody.  
    </p>
<p>
    Assured in their quietness, 
    A Weather don't back away from their most vulnerable moments-Gerber 
    and Winchester inhaling in tandem or the rustle of their mouths against 
    the microphones-and it is those tiny, aural imperfections that make 
    this collection so sensual. But unlike the slowcore heroes who 
    have influenced them, this fivesome isn't restrained or 
    careful. Even if the volume on <em>Cove</em> is ubiquitously low and primed 
    for headphone listening, there is a crashing power within. No wonder 
    they named themselves for meteorology; A Weather are, quite literally, 
    a quiet storm.

    I'll give this to Sub Pop: They certainly know what's in their wheelhouse.  The mitosis of the Band of Horses stem cell resulted in the more streamlined and sedate <em>Cease to Begin</em> and Mat Brooke's Grand Archives...a band that sounds like they'd end up on the label any damn way.  Or, how about this: The band that pulls off what the Elected were supposed to, a mixture of hayseed indie, bashful singer-songwriter comedowns, and sunny, orchestral pop.<br/></p><p>
<em>Grand Archives</em> won't have the same impact of either Horses record, since it's more about hooks than heft and certainly less scrutable in topicality.  But after hearing ""Torn Blue Foam Couch"" spiral endlessly upward, the ""Bungalow Bill""-quoting harmonica/whistle riff of ""Miniature Birds"", or the playful jig in the chorus of ""A Setting Sun,"" you begin to suspect the root of <em>Cease to Begin'</em>s occasional dourness.  Brooke did manage to salvage a sense for the anthemic, although it isn't quite as barnstorming-- ""Swan Matches"" and ""Index Moon"" come girded by strong, but slow-evolving melodies that reveal themselves as stop-motion lighter wavers.</p><p>
    Brooke's c.v. might be the main draw for rubberneckers here, but Grand Archives are far from a plug'n'play set-up; Brooke's slight voice, more airy than airborne gets plenty of help in from his backing band (which includes Carissa's Wierd's Jenn Ghetto and Ghost Stories), all of whom contribute strong vocals.  ""Sleepdriving"", the album standout, is a monument of gauze, slowly evolving harmonies lingering before the coda breaks into a triumphant string uplift straight from Sigur Ros.  While it's tempting to lump them into the ever-increasing pile of 70s California daytrippers, there's actually more forensic evidence of <em>Summerteeth</em> in the perfectly laconic horns on ""Miniature Birds"" and mandolins of brief closer ""Orange Juice"".     </p><p>
    The melodica instrumental ""Breezy No Breezy"" is a bit of trifle, but ""The Crime Window"" is the only real clunker on<em> Grand Archives</em>-- and it's a doozy.  Relentlessly loud with power chords, bleating horns, and an unbecoming/unconvincing shoutiness, ""Crime Window"" shows the band trying to traverse the entirety of Montreal in four minutes, and by comparison, <em>Neon Bible</em> is a case study of subtlety.  At the very least, the recording sessions for ""Crime Window"" must've been a blast, a feeling you get from just about everything else here.  The insularity of <em>Cease to Begin</em> certainly has its merits, and it's pointless to argue about who comes out on top here, but the way Grand Archives come forth with arms outsretched results in a debut that likely exceeds most expectations.   <br/>

<em>Return of the Giant Slits</em> is a slippery, glorious
    mess that will infuriate anyone expecting the Slits to revisit their debut. The
    nervous energy that powered <em>Cut</em> is seemingly replaced with a relaxed
    smoked-out vibe that belies the group putting their Jamaican influences-- as well
    as their interest in other world musics-- front and center. At times, this
    might make the record sound like aimless noodling, the band just biding time on
    the label's dime while someone behind the mixing board packs a new bowl.
    However, while this tact has little in common with the pogo grind essayed by
    their more traditional punk rock contemporaries, they're right in line with the
    off-the-wall antics of their more open-minded countrymen, like This Heat and
    especially the Pop Group. For <em>Return</em>, it's not a case of less energy,
    but repurposed energy.</p><p>
    The inclusion of Pop Group drummer Bruce Smith in the group has a lot to do
    with the album's success. He provides a deceptively primal backbeat that meshes
    perfectly with the odd angles the group explores. On ""Earthbeat"", he
    pounds out a simple tribal beat, a fine backdrop for the song's two-note bass
    motif and Ari's environmentally-conscious warbling. He's just as comfortable
    providing a grounding rocksteady shuffle for ""Difficult Fun"" and
    ""Or What It Is?"" as he is following the group's shambling muses into
    the ether (as on ""Animal Space/ Spacier""). Viv Albertine's guitar
    playing, already fragmented and skittish, is even more skeletal here, her
    scratches and stabs flitting about the record's periphery (aside from some
    wah-wah work on ""Walkabout""). On the other hand, <em>Return</em>'s
    rhythmic bent allows Tessa Politt's loping and nimble basslines to take center stage.
    And amidst the flourishes of melodica and trumpet is Ari Up's unmistakable
    croon, attacking the songs the way one would expect a five-year-old to approach
    them-- shamelessly singing notes for the sake of the notes instead of for the
    sake of some stodgy old melody. While the lyrics, moving from personal to
    global concerns, might not pack as much punch as they once did-- don't hurt
    yourself trying to delve deep into song-long couplets like ""Difficult fun
    is hard to come by/ And empty fun is easy to find""-- it's the way she's
    saying what she says that matters most. <em>Return of the Giant Slits</em> isn't
    as easy to love as its predecessor, but it could turn out to be the more
    rewarding album of the two.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the extras tacked onto <em>Return</em> might make that reward
    seem less valuable. Finally having this album in print is a blessing in and of
    itself, and the label's dedication to offering folks everything related to <em>Return</em>
    is commendable from a completist's standpoint. Unfortunately, there's not much
    in the vaults, which is why the eight-track bonus disc contains FIVE versions of
    ""Earthbeat"". Offering just ""Dub Beat"" (which sounds as you
    would expect) and the version from the ""Earthbeat"" 12"" (which three minutes to the original's running time) would have been plenty. But why stop there when
    you can have a version sung in Japanese that sounds just like the 12""
    version, a version sung in German that sounds like the Japanese version, and an
    ""extra"" version that sounds almost exactly like the version on the
    album proper? And then there's a twelve-minute radio interview where the group
    (stopping off during a U.S. tour) treat almost every caller with charming
    disdain and disrespect. It's a cute curio, but might be worth only one listen,
    if that. A more judicious compiler could have gotten away with grabbing the
    aforementioned good ""Earthbeat"" outtakes, the re-dubbing of
    ""Face Place"", and the re-dubbing of ""In The Beginning, There Was
    Rhythm"", and fit them nice and snug onto the end of the disc containing
    the proper album. Of course, this re-issue is aimed squarely at the sorts of
    folks that probably want to hear Ari Up <em>sprachen zie deutsch</em>, so better
    to err on the side of offering too much. And given that this is the first time
    in twenty-six years that the album's been available on CD outside of Japan,
    letting a few dull outtakes spoil the album proper is just silly.

The most significant thing about the debut album from New York's Hercules and Love Affair has less to do with revival than arrival-- that of a compelling new voice in American dance music. Not Antony Hegarty's, of Antony and the Johnsons, even though his pipes are an integral part of Hercules' aesthetic, but Andrew Butler, a twentysomething resident of New York who has made one of 2008's great albums, and one of the best longplayers from DFA. (DFA's Tim Goldsworthy surely deserves some of the credit as well, as the album's co-producer and the programmer behind most of the record's beats.) Butler got his start writing music for art projects in college-- ""like a remake of Gino Soccio's 'Runaway' done in the style of Kraftwerk,"" he told <em>Fact</em> magazine-- but Hercules and Love Affair's music doesn't require Fischerspooner-type theatrics. This debut album is a self-contained, self-assured, 10-song set that runs vintage styles through a restless compositional imagination to create something joyfully, startlingly unique.</p><p>
    Of course, you can't entirely forget about disco; the record owes a debt to the dance-music of the 1970s and 80s, from Gamble &amp; Huff-style strings to the camp sensibilities of Sylvester or Patrick Cowley. Butler has clearly studied Arthur Russell: His dancefloor jams have the same energy that drives uptempo Russell numbers like ""Go Bang"" and ""Is It All Over My Face?"", and his arrangements-- as when he nestles Kim Ann Foxman's voice in a bed of spongy keys and bass on ""Athene"", like an Easter egg in plastic grass-- recall Russell's facility for space and timbre.</p><p>
    There are plenty of signposts for disco, the genre: octave-toggling bass lines (played by Automato's Andrew Raposo and !!!'s Tyler Pope), rattling congas, bouncing 4/4 kicks, and insistent open hi-hats. There are references to house, as well, as would be expected from a record whose lead single features a Frankie Knuckles remix. But they point less to the 90s version of house as a distinct genre, whether sleek and lush or raw and machinic, than to house music in its origins, when it was simply disco music that was played at the Warehouse. Only ""You Belong"", with its taut, spiky drum machine programming and pistoning chords, engages the formalism of early Chicago house.</p><p>
    And it engages it brilliantly. What is often forgotten when talking about music so steeped in tradition is how it actually sounds-- how it works, how it conjures. It would be a shame if Hercules and Love Affair's music were to be reduced to the sum of its references, even in shorthand, because Butler's music is too complex, too lovingly stuffed with ideas. That <em>Hercules and Love Affair</em> is as unwieldy as its name-- and also just as passionate, camp, and muscular-- is one of its great pleasures. ""You Belong"" begins as a faithful exercise in acid-house revivalism, from the syncopated cowbell patterns to a looped vocal sample recalling the classic house invocations to ""Jack, motherfucker."" (It doesn't matter that the indistinct sample says something different; its cadence triggers something like an unconscious memory of acid house's vocal tropes.) It's the way that Butler and his collaborators mold formalist fidelity into something stranger that makes the track really sing, beginning with keyboards that seem to float on a cushion of air, and extending to the way that the singer Nomi's lead vocals are mimicked by a multitracked backing refrain from Antony that sounds as though it's been run through a prism. For its minor-key structure, the song's augmented chords give it the quality of an exploding rainbow.</p><p>
    Not everything here is designed as ""dance music."" The opening ""Time Will"", one of the album's highlights, mutates a standard disco framework into a weird and gelatinous torch song. ""Iris"", likewise, slows house music's pitter-patter dramatically, leaving the rhythm a framing device for the interplay between horns, synthesizers, and Foxman's sentimental lead vocals. And ""Easy"", the album's most understated song, sounds so different from the rest of the record that it suggests an alternate trajectory Hercules and Love Affair could presumably pursue-- a dusky noir somewhere between the Knife and Shriekback.</p><p>
    But while more than half of the album's tracks would easily work on forward-thinking dance floors-- ""Hercules' Theme"", ""You Belong"", ""Athene"", ""Blind"", ""This Is My Love"", ""Raise Me Up"", and ""True False, Fake Real"" all cruise comfortably between 110 and 120 bpm-- what really shines is the songwriting. The album brims with hooks, choruses, bridges, strange twists, and turns. It's hardly maximalist-- every song feels like it could be played by a four-or-five piece band with a few overdubs-- and yet the record expands and contracts, pressing tones together before zooming outward to present each element in stark, shining relief. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the rollicking ""Hercules' Theme"", which opens with a spare loop of percussion, Rhodes, and electric bass and gradually balloons into a soaring mess of horns, string vamps, and vocal harmonies. Few producers can pull off excess as well as Butler and Goldsworthy; that they balance their outré tendencies with moments of careful restraint only confirms their finesse.</p><p>
    If the record has a flaw, it might be its overall pacing. ""Time Will"" and ""Hercules' Theme"" feel like they're vying for the opening slot, a sense confirmed by the fact that they're in the same key. And the flow of the record's latter half feels off, with the subdued ""Iris"" and ""Easy"" followed by another muted disco number (""This Is My Love"") before jumping back into the jaunty ""Raise Me Up"" and ""True False, ""Fake Real"". But these are quibbles. <em>Hercules and Love Affair</em> is a phenomenal album, one destined to save disco not from its detractors but rather from those fans and revivalists who would calcify the music as a set as a set of tropes and reference points. Lush, melancholic, gregarious, generous, both precise and a little bit unhinged-- this is the most original American dance album in a long while.</p></div>"|11269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11269-hercules-and-love-affair/|9.1|Philip Sherburne

    I think it was summer 1997 when I saw my first and only
    Whiskeytown show. My memory is cloudy and I don't have the ticket stub anymore,
    so I don't recall who they opened for (I'm pretty sure it was Son Volt) or which songs they played. I do
    remember that it was at the New Daisy Theatre on Beale Street in Memphis, and
    that I was pleasantly surprised by their performance. Of course, I'd heard of Whiskeytown: <em>Faithless Street,</em> the North Carolina
    band's full-length debut, had been trumpeted by <em>No Depression</em> (R.I.P.) and had become an alt-country touchstone. Still, I thought that album sounded
    derivative and a little dull, too indistinct up against bands like the Old 97's
    and Freakwater. So I was only mildly curious when Whiskeytown took the stage and
    played new songs from their upcoming major-label debut, <em>Strangers Almanac</em>.</p><p>
    Scruffy Ryan Adams, who looked muscular in a black
    t-shirt, had a good rapport with violinist Caitlin Cary, who stood off to the
    side and handled most of the between-song banter. There was an easy chemistry
    between them, guitarist Phil Wandscher, and the new rhythm section, and they
    funneled all that famous band tension into a tight, energetic show. I left
    convinced that they would make a great album someday.</p><p>
    Sadly, <em>Strangers
    Almanac</em> wasn't it. Alternately confident and overreaching, original and
    derivative, it showed a band still coming into their own and a
    singer-songwriter still settling into his voice. The band borrow obviously from
    the Replacements (""Yesterday's News""), Bruce Springsteen (""Houses on the Hill""),
    Uncle Tupelo (""Losering""), Gram
    Parsons (""Dancing with the Women at the Bar""), and the True Believers
    (Alejandro Escovedo sings the bridge on ""Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart"").
    At the time, they were unable to integrate these influences into a distinctive,
    personal sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    More than 10 years after its initial release, <em>Strangers Almanac</em> is getting the deluxe,
    two-disc reissue treatment, complete with five live tracks from the band's
    studio performance at KCRW, the complete Barn's on Fire and Baseball Park
    sessions, and a handful of stray covers and soundtrack contributions, which
    vary from excellent (the darkly urgent ""Breathe"") to the throwaway (the
    overwrought ""Wither, I'm a Flower""). Despite the official plastic ""deluxe""
    slipcase and thoughtful liner notes by <em>No
    Depression</em> co-founder Peter Blackstock, I get the impression that the album's
    reputation has more to do with the music the band made afterwards than with the
    music the band made at this particular point in their careers. 
    </p>
<p>
    Adams in particular sounds like he's
    still finding his voice on the album, despite the many accolades for his
    songwriting. The album proper is littered with clunky lines and unwieldy
    imagery, such as the lame pun that anchors the drowsy opener ""Inn
    Town"", which plays out in the
    chorus as ""When I'm in(n) town..."" The verse melody on ""16 Days"" sounds awkward,
    never quite resolving itself satisfactorily, and Adams
    writes some of his most maudlin lyrics on the bridge: ""Old tin cups, little
    paper dolls/ All wrapped up, in ribbons bowed with hearts."" 
    </p>
<p>
    His subjects-- broken hearts, unspoken apologies, lonely
    roads, cheap motels-- were common to almost every alt-country band in the late
    90s, but somehow his treatment sounds obligatory, as if he's learning to speak
    a new language. On ""Dancing with the Women at the Bar"", the father-and-son tale
    of life on the strip lacks that one crucial detail that would make it
    believable or lend it personal gravity, but fortunately, the song veers into
    one of Adams' loveliest and most forlorn choruses, which producer Jim Scott
    underlays with a thrumming organ more evocative than any of the lyrics. In
    fact, Scott, who had previously worked with Tom Petty and Wilco and who has
    since worked with Foo Fighters and Wilco again, helps Whiskeytown put many of
    these songs over, adding those explosive chords to the chorus of ""Yesterday's
    News"" and those ghostly doubled vocals to ""Not Home Anymore"", which reinforce
    its sense of isolation. The alarm clock that ends the album, however, remains a
    needless gimmick.
    </p>
<p>
    Several weeks after the Memphis show, <em>Strangers Almanac</em> arrived in stores heralded with a lot of hype,
    but due to either Outpost's lackluster promotional push or to the growing rift
    between the band members, it was not the predicted break-out (Even Grant Alden,
    <em>No Depression</em>'s other co-founder,
    gave it only three stars in <em>Rolling Stone</em>,
    calling the band ""still tentative, still learning""). Before breaking up, the
    band-- well, Adams, Cary, and guests-- recorded a follow-up, which was shelved
    until 2001. That album, cryptically titled <em>Pneumonia</em>,
    was the great album I wanted <em>Strangers
    Almanac</em> to be, a well-written and wide-ranging collection of songs that
    nicely realized the possibilities of Adams' voice
    melding naturally and beautifully with Cary's.
    </p>
<p>
    In some ways, <em>Strangers
    Almanac</em> is a relic of late-90s alt-country, representing a moment just before
    so many of its most popular acts broke free of the genre's conservative
    strictures and began experimenting with a wider sonic palette. As such, the
    album feels a little dated; it's hard to understand how it would have been
    revolutionary eleven years ago. Either the aesthetic of country embellishments
    on a rock framework has been so absorbed by Starbucks roots music or maybe I've
    just gotten too old, but very little about <em>Strangers
    Almanac</em> feels especially innovative in 2008. It just sounds like another rock
    album, sturdy enough but rarely engrossing.

    As an BFA student at the Kansas City Art Institute, Ssion leader Cody Critcheloe produced an animated short called <em>The</em> <em>Lemon Cookie Revolution</em>.
    Effectively, and often hilariously, blurring the two most popular
    definitions of ""cult"" beyond recognition, Critcheloe imagined himself
    poisoning his
    heroes with delicious snacks of the film's title, thereby assuming a
    place among them in the cred-fed indie pantheon. It's a crude and
    campy stop-motion animation piece with a soundtrack
    boasting Wire and the Pet Shop Boys, and it allows Critcheloe to
    indulge his two fascinations: ironically chiding subcultural
    ""outsiders"", and indulging in over-the-top wish-fulfillment fantasies.
    In his narrated introduction to the film, he introduces its two themes
    thusly: ""Underground music cult figures you've probably never heard of,
    nor do you even care about. My second favorite thing in the whole wide
    world is, without a doubt, revolution.""</p><p>
    If ""Fear Us"", from <em>
    Fool's Gold</em>, Ssion's second album, is any indication, Critcheloe 
    is now a member in good standing. The song documents (as ""we"") 
    a caricatured, nihilistic hipster netherworld-- mirrored in the album's 
    butched-out cover image-- as a cartoonish, unambiguously bold amalgam 
    of gay subcultural stereotypes, which Critcheloe both calls attention 
    to and celebrates. In the <em>Revolution</em> short, an ejaculating penis 
    is a recurring motif symbolizing rapture, and <em>Gold</em>'s first single, 
    ""Street Jizz"", similarly approaches orgasm and its byproducts 
    as the (equally metaphoric and literal, no doubt) quintessence of experience, 
    the ""white light"" that pierces the dark of night. Any revolution 
    needs converts to succeed, though, and the song's chorus doubles as 
    a recruitment slogan: ""It feels more dirty than it really is."" 
    As an anthem, ""Jizz"" is also ridiculously catchy and simple: 
    Critcheloe's exhortations echo atop a buzzing synth melody doubling 
    a spry disco bassline, with a refrain dripping with affirmation and 
    aspiration.</p><p>
    Appropriately for music that makes smut sound so enticing, <em>Fool's Gold</em> vacillates between glossy disco and squalid electro-punk.  Between the kinky ""Warm Glove"", the petulant screamalong ""Dayjob"", and ""Bullshit"", Critcheloe's voice, buffered by plenty of fuzz and the occasional sax squonk, finds a middle-ground between the late-1990s incarnation of Royal Trux's Neil Hagerty and a spit-shined Darby Crash.  Despite the textural shifts, the optimistic sentiment stays the same throughout: like CSS' ""Fuckoff is Not the Only Thing You Have to Show"", or Scissor Sisters' ""Mary"", Critcheloe keeps his advice blissfully simple: ""Don't let the bullshit get you down."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Ssion's tendency to weave sympathy 
    and encouragement through the naughty bits-- erasing the boring distinctions 
    between partying, sex, music, and boundless, delirious dreaming-- clearly 
    aligns them with CSS, Scissor Sisters, and Junior Senior, their fellow 
    purveyors of devilishly simple, self-reflexive, and undeniably catchy 
    dance-pop.  <em>Fool's Gold</em> kicks off with ""Clown"", 
    a sinuously funky piano-driven disco jam that extols the virtues of 
    using the club to take (not lose) control. It's impossible not to hear 
    the refrain ""pride, faith, heart and soul"" as anything other 
    than a statement of purpose, and in this context, the decision between 
    living in the ""trenches,"" or in a ""house with picket fences"" 
    shouldn't take very long to make. 
    </p>
<p>
    While it's clear which of the 
    two is more enticing, the glimmering banger ""A Wolves Eye"" still 
    allows for keeping ""your head in the clouds"" while slinking 
    through the underground.  That metaphor extends to <em>Fool</em>'s 
    close; over an ecstatic, quasi-gospel synth shriek, ""Heaven"" 
    proffers the same sort of take-no-prisoners approach from <em>The Lemon 
    Cookie Revolution</em> (and hinted at in the title to the band's 2003 
    album <em>Opportunity Bless My Soul</em>): ""Just to get you all dancin'/ 
    I'd hold god up for ransom."" In order to find redemption, sometimes 
    it's just easiest to take out the deities and install yourself in their 
    place.

As foils they were as complementary as they were contradictory, Forster's arch, assertive delivery often serving as a front for a bruised sensitivity; McLennan's more genteel voice and agreeable melodicism often acting as decoys to his matter-of-fact observations and disarming punchlines. But even if McLennan wrote the kind of love songs that could become tough and unsentimental at the turn of a couplet, it was never for pure shock or subversive effect-- rather, it felt like sage advice for old-fashioned romantics in a world that has no time for them.</p><p>
    News of McLennan's sudden passing in 2006 came with all the sucker-punch surprise as one of his lyrical twists, and it was particularly tragic in light of the fact that, since a 1999 reunion with Forster, the Go-Betweens were once again a going concern. But there was some consolation in the fact that McLennan's death-- brought on by heart failure during an afternoon nap-- reflected the same quiet dignity he carried himself with in life and song. And it's this very spirit that <em>Love Goes On</em> seeks to honor. It says a lot about the intensity of admiration McLennan inspired that an obscure Long Beach-based micro-indie-- headed by superfan David Buckner-- could round up various indie luminaries (Stars, Portastatic, the Clientele) and long-time associates (the Bats, former Saints founder Ed Kuepper, Black Box Recorder's Luke Haines) to donate self-financed covers to the album. (Though the project's modest means are unfortunately betrayed by Jack Rabid's liner-note essay, which would've benefited from another round of proofreading-- to wit, ""Cattle and Cain"" [sic].)<br/>
<em> <br/>
    Love Goes On </em>smartly frontloads some of McLennan's lesser-known work before delving into his signature material, with the Clientele turning in a seductively swirling version of ""Orpheus Beach"" (from 2000's Go-Betweens reunion album <em>The Friends of Rachel Worth</em>), and Ed Kuepper recasting ""Finding You"" (from 2005's <em>Oceans Apart</em>) as a solitary blues that's almost murder-ballad-like in its desolate air of despair. Kuepper's contribution is especially notable in that he's the only singer here operating well outside of McLennan's gentle, relaxed vocal register, adopting a deep, throaty tenor closer to fellow Aussie Nick Cave. The artists entrusted with McLennan's more revered songs tweak the material in much more subtle fashion. Stars pull the long straw by claiming arguably McLennan's greatest and most poignant song, ""Cattle and Cane"", and their take is actually more revelatory as a Stars track than a McLennan cover, with an uncharacteristically stripped-down acoustic arrangement and dry, unaffected vocal from Torquil Campbell that makes the original's themes of faded memory and lost innocence feel all the more present-- however, the closing, climactic charge to the finish line feels at odds with the original's muted melancholy. McLennan's other masterstroke of ordinary-people portraiture, ""Streets of Your Town"", is likewise reduced by Ivy to a metronome-click and piano figure, with Dominique Durand's coo lending it a newfound space-age bachelor-pad allure.</p><p>
    The ageless integrity of McLennan's songwriting naturally encourages a simple approach-- one heard on everything from Portastatic's folk-circle adaptation of ""Bye Bye Pride"" to Haines' spectral, Elliott Smith-like treatment of ""You Won't Find It Again"" to Future Pilot AKA's dreamy piano-lilted zone-out on ""Dusty In Here"". The net effect both emphasizes McLennan's lyrical charms, and liberates some of the Go-Betweens' material from its occasionally dated 80s production (most notably, ""Bachelor Kisses"", whose soft-focus surface is given a mild scuffing by UK songwriter Paul Handyside). The bittersweet inspiration and homespun origins of these covers means that <em>Love Goes On</em> is not really a forum for lofty reinterpretation, and in some cases the overly tasteful handling of the material (see: ""Haunted House"" by Brookville, aka Ivy's Andy Chase), can nudge the tracks toward Starbucks-scented AC. <em>Love Goes On</em> feels most rewarding when approached as an intimate, quietly celebratory wake among friends-- and if the readings of their favorite McLennan songs are too faithful to warrant much revisiting in lieu of the originals, as the man himself once famously sang, ""faithful is not a bad word.""</p></div>"|11221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11221-love-goes-on-a-tribute-to-grant-mclennan/|7.0|Stuart Berman

After the departure of co-founding member Larissa Loyva, P:ano's remaining threesome have returned as No Kids, changing course from 2005's ukulele-driven <em>Ghost Pirates Without Heads</em> for a debut that rivals the Dirty Projectors' <em>The Getty Address</em> in its art-saturated omnivorousness, though its appetites aren't always within its means. On <em>Come Into My House</em>, everything from present-day urban radio to kitchen-sink chamber-pop to college glee clubs serve as fodder for F. Scott Fitzgerald-esque depictions of effete East Coast student loneliness. This old beach house is an extravagant one, peopled by characters who probably weren't hurt by the housing-market slump.</p><p>
    Plenty of indie pop bands borrow from 1960s Motown, but No Kids' appropriation of contemporary r&amp;b puts them in a lineage that runs from Orange Juice's Chic-style guitars and Scritti Politti's soulful balladry to Hot Chip's self-aware electropop-- and, alas, labelmate Hey Willpower's un-<em>FutureSex</em>-y Timberlake sounds, too. When the compositions are as engaging as the intricate percussion, as on advance mp3s like piano-based male-female duet ""For Halloween"" or the falsetto-frosted ""The Beaches All Closed"", songwriter Nick Krgovich conjures a world of empty vacation homes and full scrapbooks. The T-Pain-esque Auto-Tuning on ""Listen For It/Courtyard Music"" comes off as an eccentricity next to what sounds like bassoon, but Krgovich's protagonists have eccentricities instead of girlfriends. ""Neighbour's Party"" interpolates the slinky piano riff from Amerie's ""Crush"" as if it were a sample; the obviousness of the reference is a painful reminder that Amerie would be a <em>lot</em> more fun to hear blasting from your neighbor's party.</p><p>
    Of course, No Kids know this, too. ""It's a dance in my heart,"" Krgovich and Julia Chirka sing-- not a night in the club. Opener ""Great Escape"" describes ""wandering around the gardens on this great estate"" with the band's Jimmy Jam-Terry Lewis fascination hidden behind lush orchestration, marching-band drum rolls, and quiet wistfulness. When the time comes for celebration on ""I Love the Weekend"" or ""Old Iron Gate"", Krgovich's melismas flit over Brazilian rhythms instead of icy-hot r&amp;b. ""Four Freshmen Locked Out as the Sun Goes Down"" sets barbershop-style harmonies atop unobtrusive strums. Lyrical mentions of upper-crust academic life are about as frequent here as musical allusions to the pop charts.
    </p><p>
    In Fitzgerald novels like <em>The Beautiful and Damned</em>, the characters may come from the WASP elite, but their passions burn like the booze in which they can't help but overindulge. <em>Come Into My House</em> represents another side of paradise-- the yearning of the well-to-do young intellectual who doesn't do well when it comes to matters of the heart, the insider who finds himself on the outside (with his pockets full of saltwater taffy). The album could use a little more of Fitzgerald's fiery extremes, and a bit less of meandering disappointments like ""You Looked Good to Me"" or ""Dancing in the Stacks"", but at its best it's a clever piece of musical storytelling by a band unintimidated by genre.

    Eyebrows raised when Why? were chosen to support the Silver Jews on a 2005 tour, but that seemingly incongruous bill made more sense when considering one of Berman's better lines: ""All my favorite singers couldn't sing.""  Likewise on <em>Alopecia</em>, Yoni Wolf doesn't seem to know he isn't a diva on ""Simeon's Dilemma"", that he isn't a New Pornographer on ""Fatalist Palmistry"", or that he's not a grizzled battle-rapper on ""The Fall of Mr. Fifths"", and he won't let any of it get in his way. He's got too much to say to be concerned about it.</p><p>
    ""Unclassifiable"" is usually lazy shorthand for albums featuring both guitars and keyboards. <em>Alopecia</em> is a liquid in the sieve of genre: put it on headphones and it begs to bump; recite lyrics aloud and people will look at you with loathing usually reserved for religious leaflet canvassers and slam poets; try and decode the words in your head and you'll only hear the melodies behind them. As for his lyrics, it's wrong to call them stream-of-consciousness, since that implies Wolf is a poor self-editor; nothing about <em>Alopecia</em> is lazy. It's more like 5 a.m. journal entries cut up and turned to collage. Clearly, every line won't be pure gold, but they all add up to something.</p><p>
<em>Alopecia</em> opens with the chain-gang lurch of ""The Vowels Pt. 2"", its slow claps and big, watery bass hits rubbing against Wolf's most insistent rap/sing delivery, and the unlikely hook of ""Cheery-ay, Cheery-ee..."" somehow becoming the record's most ingratiating. Funnily, the first two lines (""I'm not a ladies man, I'm a landmine, filming my own fake death..."") reveal most of the record's preoccupation. No matter what he's on about on <em>Alopecia</em>-- although most of the time, he's pretty easy to follow, especially compared to his Anticon brethren-- sex and death are never far from Wolf's mind. The former is pretty evident on ""Good Friday"", a crisper revisiting of the acoustic plucking-plus-beats of Why?'s earlier work, and an uncomfortable litany of perversions Wolf ""wouldn't admit to his head-shrinker"" that includes forgetting Elton John lyrics in karaoke. Wolf's voice is (putting it delicately) distinctive, but his monotone murmur here is just one example of his ability to change up his delivery.</p><p>
    Not that he needs to-- while Wolf fearlessly splays  open his head for all to see its contents, the band is the real star (the core of Yoni, brother Josiah Wolf, Doug McDiarmid, and here fleshed out by Fog's Andrew Broder and bassist Mark Erickson). They're what make ""The Hollows"" work as both tentative and propulsive guitar-rock under Wolf's paranoia, and make ""Palmistry"" cheerful and memorable pop under the sobriety of his lyrics. ""These Few Presidents"" is stiff indie rock, with drum-machines and the polite blurt of an organ, until the bottom drops out and cascades of clattering percussion and yawning low frequencies soundtrack the most sincere Hallmark card ever: ""Even though I haven't seen you in years, yours is a funeral I'd fly to from anywhere.""</p><p>
    ""Mr. Fifths"" returns to bouncy, rap-minded delivery, with tongue-twisting lines about syphilis and the sound of high heels on marble. But they've got some nerve here, making us wait until the record's last third for its best songs: ""A Sky for Shoeing Horses Under"" is some strange, sublime triangulation of Steve Reich, deadpan rap swagger, and blustery multi-tracked choruses you could link to Alice in Chains. But trainspotting is beside the point-- the band creates a musical landscape so vivid that every cryptic line doesn't seem inscrutable, but more like puzzles worth unlocking.</p><p>
    The stalker's serenade, ""Simeon's Dilemma"", is creepy, sure, but then Wolf busts out the falsetto like he's a supporting character in a boy band getting his big solo moment-- you can almost hear him pointing at notes on the invisible scale with his hand. Then there's the disorienting and dreamy behind-the-beat thump of ""By Torpedo or Crohn's"", featuring what I guess you might expect from underground white-guy rap: cryptic lyrics about throwing up behind Whole Foods, the admission that as a kid he ""didn't shit his pants much,"" and hoping for health food in hell. It contrasts with the rest of <em>Alopecia</em>, but even as a portrait of a medium existence, it's still a complicated one, and its most lasting impression after the lulling sing-song of the chorus is pervasive anxiety. It's weird to think that 2008 could be a year of reaffirmation for Anticon, but along with Subtle, they just won't adhere to the boxes we've tried to stuff them into.</p><p>
    If there's anything that drags down <em>Alopecia</em>, it's that ""Fatalist Palmistry"" is the only real sigh of relief on a very sober record (and even that song begins and ends on thoughts of death). Even as it charted a difficult breakup, 2005's <em>Elephant Eyelash</em> had a few more moments of relative sunshine. Here, Wolf's exhaustively catalogued his sins and imperfections as on ""Good Friday"", and even the stalker in ""Simeon's Dilemma"" has no release or acknowledgment to look forward to; he braces for the fall, and prepares to ""deny, deny, deny."" Wolf seems doomed to feel too much here-- to take in everything, and take it all very, very seriously.

    If the most pure rock'n'roll is all about excess, emancipation, and sexuality, then 55-year-old Parisian composer Rhys Chatham makes Mick Jagger seem like a Sunday school teacher: Chatham's second 3xCD box set for Table of the Elements, <em>Guitar Trio is My Life!</em>, collects 10 performances from Chatham's 2007 14-city North American tour. Every night, Chatham and a different ensemble of musicians performed his most famous work, 1977's ""Guitar Trio"", twice. It's about time: For too long, Chatham's massed guitars have been a footnote to those of the more famous Glenn Branca. But Branca--- like Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore, Swans' Michael Gira and Jonathan Kane, and the Modern Lovers' Ernie Brooks, many of whom appear here-- was an early student of and member in Chatham's New York ensembles. This exhausting, exhilarating collection, though, should confirm both Chatham and ""Guitar Trio"" as staples in the rock and 20th cenury composition canons. At the very least, from the first E note to the last E chord three hours later, it proves that Chatham-- also significant for his curatorial role at New York's The Kitchen in the 70s  and in the establishment of No Wave later that decade-- fucking rocks.</p><p>
    The ""Guitar Trio"" score is deceptively simple: ""In this century, it has never taken more than an hour to teach 'Guitar Trio' to everyone's satisfaction and comfort level,"" Chatham wrote in the score notes circulated for the 2007 tour documented by <em>Guitar Trio Is My Life!</em> ""So please don't worry about anything."" Several guitar players gather around a drummer and an electric bassist. Their amps are clean, loud, and high on treble. The drummer counts off, and Chatham strums an open low E string, his rhythm a bit like a jumpy 60s Brit Invasion tune. The drummer plays a cantering, steady rhythm restricted to the hi-hat. One by one, Chatham signals each guitarist to join. The bassist enters. After several minutes, Chatham begins strumming the top three strings and then signals each guitarist to do the same. Later, Chatham begins strumming all six strings, fretting only the second string to B. Eventually everyone stops playing except the drummer, still using only hi-hat, and Chatham, again playing one string. The entire process repeats, and it's generally a bit briefer the second time around. The music fades out with a final chord played on a conclusive downbeat. Chatham announces the ensemble, bows, turns to his band, and starts again in the exact same way. Except this time, the drummer is given use of his full kit, especially the snare and kick drums. The only previous version of ""Guitar Trio"" (available on the long-since out-of-print 2002 box set <em>An Angel Moves Too Fast to See</em> and on the 2006 disc <em>Die Donnergötter</em>) was eight minutes long (first cycle only). The shortest take on <em>Guitar Trio Is My Life!</em> is the second Brooklyn cycle, which ends after 16 driving minutes.</p><p>
    But the ""Guitar Trio"" sound is surprisingly dynamic: Chatham does not specify when any given player should play above any given fret or for what length of time. Such inherent indeterminacy means that what begins as a stately, strummed guitar pattern begins to mutate and grow into surprising shapes. This variety of sounds builds cumulatively into a thick swath of high and low overtones bouncing off of each other like long-lost kin at a crowded family reunion. All of the sounds are made from the same E string or E chord, but none of them are exactly the same. By the time ""Guitar Trio"" hits its six-string segment, it's as thick as a furious blizzard. When the notes really come down, it's beautiful and overwhelming.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, 10 versions of the same 16-to-30 minute piece of music? Boring, right? Perhaps were it not for the musicians included here-- from members of Tortoise, Sonic Youth, and Thee Silver Mt. Zion to an unknown but incredible Buffalo drummer named Jim Abramson, who gloriously mauls his 21 minutes of Table of the Elements time on Disc One. ""Guitar Trio"" ingests individual talents and funnels them into a composition loose enough for new ideas but tough enough to test physical and mental limits: On the full-drum version from Toronto, then, you get a six-piece string section (including Final Fantasy's Owen Pallet), thickening the guitar sound into a viscous smear. But after the one-string turnaround, it sounds like Chatham's worn them out. Same for Tortoise's John McEntire, who turns in the best brass-only drumming with his Chicago performance, riding his hi-hat with impeccable time and finesse. But he gets lost inside the nine-guitar storm on the full-kit version, unlike improvisational heavyweight and Collections of Colonies of Bees drummer Jon Mueller. Like he does on this year's solo drum Table of the Elements release <em>Metals,</em> Mueller rattles speakers from the frame. His kick drum and heavy snare slap fearlessly. They lash at the six guitars like the only way out is revenge. Same for Ernie Brooks' bristling bass pops on the second set from Brooklyn: With a rhythmic sense that sounds like whiplash must feel, he folds his own aesthetic beneath Chatham's masterful umbrella work.
    </p>
<p>
    When considered alongside Chatham's statement that he can teach anyone this piece in an hour, such variety is exhilarating. ""Guitar Trio"" was composed after Chatham, then a New York composer taking a somewhat academic approach to minimalism, saw the Ramones play CBGB. Their music shocked him into redirecting his sonic approach within his own pre-existing ideas. The result is glorious, one-chord, electro-orchestral, garage-band minimalism. Anyone can learn this music. Anyone can play this music. Anyone can enjoy this music, rhythmically and tonally electrified as it is. This is a popular inroad for both understanding and participating in sound fields generally relegated to academia. ""Guitar Trio"" suggests infinite possibilities for this music, for all music, really: If you can combine basic ""punk"" ideas with basic ""classical"" ideas to create something that will forever alter the shape of both memes (see Sonic Youth and Glenn Branca), what can't you do?

Guitarist Robin Staps writes their music, then teaches it to a rotating cast-- basically, whomever is around. Staps estimates that the Ocean has five guitar players, but no more than two at a time. On a recent tour, one was a Swiss 19-year-old plucked from the Internet. Twenty-six musicians played on <em>Precambrian</em>, including a British vocalist (also found via the internet), various hardcore punk luminaries, and members of the Berlin Philharmonic (the band is currently seeking a long-term live cellist). Drums were recorded in Finland, while vocals were recorded in the U.S., Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany. Staps assembled these materials at his home base, a former aluminum factory for U-boats in World War II. Now dubbed Oceanland, it houses a recording studio, rehearsal space, and sleeping quarters.</p><p>
    Such spaces are distinctly European, as is the Ocean's scope. The band has two sides; the first blends Neurosis' heaviness with Converge's angularity, while the second tempers the first with atmospheric keys and strings. To showcase these sides, the band's first two full-lengths, <em>Fluxion</em> and <em>Aeolian</em>, were originally planned as a double album. Their record label nixed this idea, but agreed to it for <em>Precambrian</em>. Its first disc is 22 minutes of metallic hardcore punk, while the gentler second disc sprawls across an hour. One 11-minute song combines 84 tracks of audio. Even the packaging is epic-- in Europe, anyway. There, <em>Precambrian</em> comes in a colorfully layered, die-cut digipak. Metal Blade's U.S. arm, citing American apathy to artwork, issued the album in a standard jewel case.</p><p>
    Even such flat presentation requires two booklets of liner notes. Ostensibly, the album revolves around the Precambrian era, the first chapter in the earth's history. The discs are subtitled ""Hadean/Archaean"" and ""Proterozoic"", the two halves of the era; their subdivisions are the song titles: ""Siderian"", ""Rhyacian"", and so on. Staps wrote the music first, then applied this conceptual framework. </p><p>
    Such post hoc construction risks pretension, but the framework fits. Unlike Isis' minimalism and Neurosis' elemental bent, the Ocean is beautifully baroque. Even its harder side is artsy. ""Neoarchaean"" begins with early-Spoon indie-arena rock, then detonates with drum rolls and spiraling guitars. ""Eoarchaean"" throws sharp elbows, but tags on a Middle Eastern-flavored coda. Disc two parallels the reconstruction of life after the Oxygen Catastrophe. It starts as a clean-toned spaghetti western, patiently building before exploding with distortion. ""Statherian""'s 6/8 recalls Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"", then leaps into synth-sprinkled thrash. ""Cryogenian""'s piano ostinato suggests ""Linus and Lucy"" dressed in black. The Ocean had such colors before, but they pulse more vividly in these spacious settings. ""Calymmian"" layers Pink Floyd slide guitar over mournful cello. In ""Stenian"", Radiohead does ""Hotel California"", as strings keen underneath. But crushing distortion buries the dirge; there will be blood, indeed. </p><p>
    Unlike Mastodon's <em>Leviathan</em>, which simply set <em>Moby Dick</em> to song, <em>Precambrian</em> isn't about rocks and lava. The lyrics bristle with natural imagery, but they're metaphoric. During the Precambrian era's Oxygen Catastrophe, oxygen and methane products of photosynthesis built up and caused mass extinction of anaerobic organisms. The obvious parallel is global warming. <em>Precambrian</em>, however, addresses human destruction more generally. ""Hadean"" declaims, ""Sitting out the goosestep of the long march of the yes-men/ As their gold card-wielding wives are consumed by bitterness."" ""Archaean"" is likewise anti-consumerist: ""We'd pay any price to buy everything/ We stand in line and smile...Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives."" ""Paleoarchaean"" sets Baudelaire's ""Man and the Sea"" to ripping hardcore punk; the vocals draw out the English translation and grind it on gravel: ""The sea is your mirror; you contemplate your soooooul/ In its eternal waves that chafe and roooooll."" When man fights the sea, he ultimately fights himself. </p><p>
<em>Precambrian</em> is gaudily dense with literary references. Quotes from the Comte de Lautréamont's <em>Les Chants de Maldoror</em> fill the liner notes, as well as the entirety of ""Mesoarchaean""; ""Neoarchaean"" draws from de Lautréamont's ""Poésies"". ""Ectasian"" sets Austrian poet Georg Trakl's ""De Profundis"" to Pantera-esque hemiolas. In ""Rhyacian"", Staps mixes his words with those of Nietzsche and de Lautréamont. He over-reaches, as his lyrics are bluntly unpoetic. But even if his references aren't narratively coherent, they're spiritually congruent. Staps is fighting for the human soul. His liner notes contain a mission statement: ""<em>Precambrian</em> is our stance against MySpace-induced volatileness and transience...It is an album for people who still believe in the idea that an album can be more, and should be more, than the sum of its tracks.""  In concept, packaging, and strata, <em>Precambrian</em> defiantly shakes up the human fossil record.</p></div>"|11214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11214-precambrian/|8.3|Cosmo Lee

    Germany's Basic Replay specializes in near-facsimiles of reggae obscurities. Though it tends to focus on highlighting weirdness at the genre's margins, there aren't stylistic or regional boundaries on what the label reissues; though it primarily culls from the mid-1970s to the mid-80s, there's no tight historical scope, either. <em>Basic Replay</em>, the label's first CD compilation, collects a sampling of the 20 or so singles it's released since 2003.</p><p>
    And though there's no real organizing principle at work, the compilation does a decent job of demonstrating how radically Jamaican music changed when the roots sound popular in the mid- and late-70s gave way to dancehall in the early- to mid-80s. Imagery in roots reggae, as the name suggests, was fixated on the past; its molasses-thick, groaning sound suggestive of the trudge-- both physical and metaphysical-- back to God-sponsored homelands. Vocalists du jour tended to either be deep and foreboding (Prince Far I, Yabby You) or clumped into sweet, transportive trios (the Congos, the Mighty Diamonds, Culture); roots' productions sounded foggy and lumbering. By comparison, dancehall was dapper and uptempo, littered with sequenced drum-machine sounds and digital frills. On <em>Basic Replay</em>, tracks like Jackie Mittoo's phantasmagoric ""Ayatollah"" or Keith Hudson's back-to-loincloths fantasy ""Hunting"" rub against Prince Jazzbo's ""Replay Version"" or Ackie's ""Call Me Rambo"", a plasticky, mid-80s production inordinately proud of its machine-gun samples.</p><p>
    What I've always loved about this era of Jamaican music is its aloof experimentalism. Like early hip-hop, it's a record of a group of people confronted with a lot of technology they had no idea how to use. Instead of spending a lot of time with pedestrian tasks like ""figuring it out,"" they pushed a few buttons in the name of novelty, etched them into vinyl, and moved on to some new, inscrutable buttons. It's the DIY aesthetic without the self-conscious politics, or progressivism without the pretension of being progressive. The best music on <em>Basic Replay</em> shows how far a little courageous ignorance can go.
    </p>
<p>
    Reggae reissues tend to enter the market either in trickles from boutique imprints like Basic Replay, or the diarrheic, fire-hose force spray of repackages from Trojan or Greensleeves. With the smaller labels, it's customary to get a more lovingly curated, aesthetically pleasing product. Basic Replay's reissued singles tend to look exactly like the out-of-print originals, logos and all, but with a small ""Basic Replay"" stamp. It's surprising and disappointing, then, that <em>Basic Replay</em> doesn't come with any liner notes. (Given the lack of chronology, it's really surprising to not have recording dates for the tracks.) And though I think it's a disservice to keep curious listeners in the dark as to a music's history (especially when it's an obscure history), it's hard not to concede to the magic of the music itself, which bubbles, squeals, and clangs around with the amazing gracelessness of an animal struggling to make sense of its brand-new body.

    When we first heard from him in 2005 after nearly ten years
    without a proper album, Eric Matthews didn't sound much different from
    the guy we heard in the 1990s. It was as if that decade hadn't even happened. But
    on this, the second full-length of his return, the feeling of déjà vu is mostly
    gone. Whereas I got the sense his last album and the couple of EPs that orbited
    it were a clearing of house from all that time off, <em>The Imagination Stage</em> seems to be the record that tells me what he
    sounds like now, a genuine move into new territory.</p><p>
    The building blocks for Matthews' brand of indie
    pop-- careful, ornate arrangements, steady medium tempos, breathy vocals,
    restraint-- are still in place, but this album slows down that sound and
    stretches it over an atmospheric hour. The result ranges from pretty to dull,
    and the album suffers from the same basic problem as 2006's <em>Foundation Sounds</em>: it's way too long. Of
    the album's 56 minutes, far too many consist of little more than keeping time,
    and on the few songs that feature drums, they never do anything more
    interesting than an entry-level rock beat.</p><p>
    As usual, Matthews uses his vocals as another instrument in
    the texture, but this time around the approach denies the songs a gravitational
    center more than usual. Certain tracks get by mostly on feel. ""That Kiss of
    Life"", for instance, doesn't have a strong melody and the
    Bacharach-ish horns repeat a simple phrase that doesn't quite amount to a hook,
    but it all coalesces to create a plush, echoing aural pillow that at least
    sounds nice. On the title track, he sings, ""I tried like hell to make the music
    beautiful,"" and he mostly succeeds at that, but beautiful and memorable aren't
    necessarily the same thing.
    </p>
<p>
    That's illustrated amply on ""Don't Take Light"", which
    wanders through an ambient haze of piano, vocals and strings, and sounds pretty
    but never hooks you with anything more than its prettiness. It is one of the
    few songs, though, to feature real dissonance, which sets it apart some. Most
    of the rest of the record is heavily diatonic and unsyncopated, leading it all
    to blur together. The church organ of ""Her Life"" provides another spike of
    darkness, but again, it's mostly just atmosphere as the vocal never latches on
    to a real melody. 
    </p>
<p>
    This is an album that, despite possessing many of the
    signifiers of pop and surrounding them with pretty chamber orchestra
    arrangements, doesn't stick with you. It's the age-old wallpaper effect:
    it sounds good, and it's hard to pick out any one thing that's terribly wrong
    with it, but it's also hard to find a reason to listen again. Even after
    several listens, I felt like I was hearing each song for the first time, not
    because there was a lot to listen to, but because none of it had stayed with
    me. It's good to hear Matthews challenging himself and exploring a different sound,
    and his most ardent fans will want to hear where he's gone, but in his comeback
    he's yet to equal his first two solo albums from so long ago.

The male with the objective pronoun is Matt Ward, the John Fahey and Hank Williams acolyte who in eight years has risen from indie label obscurity to, arguably, the three or four spot in the active Merge Records rotation. Both Deschanel and Ward have their own successful careers, but on <i>Volume One</i>-- the first offering from their new collaborative band She &amp; Him-- him is less than she. Although Ward produced the record and closet songwriter Deschanel only started sharing her songs at his request, the album succeeds mostly because those songs feel like familiar AM radio classics and because her voice offers instant emotional empathy. Ward's tasteful playing and sparse arrangements just serve to make something good that much better.</p>
<p>She also narrates the 11 songs here, all about her changing relations to an anonymous him: On the charming ""Sentimental Heart"", she's wrecked, crying on the floor, lonely without him. One song later during ""Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?"", she's sitting on the shelf, playfully waiting for him to come over. On the petulant ""Take It Back"", she doesn't want to be loved, fooled, or wooed by him. One song later during ""I Was Made for You"", she's giddy over the smiling him in the street. The him in question changes throughout <i>Volume One</i>, but she relates to the masculine through a consistently naïve romanticism, whether it's riding a tandem bicycle alone on the somehow upbeat ""Black Hole"" or cheerfully telling girlfriends that love is a glorious but interminable conquest on ""This Is Not a Test"". Aside from two duets and obscurant backing vocals on one track, Ward serves as him only sonically, servicing the songs from the wings; thematically, Deschanel sings about a him that's not Ward at all.</p>
<p>But Ward and the team he gathered for two Portland, Ore., sessions in Fall 2006 and Winter 2007-- Norfolk &amp; Western/Decemberists/M. Ward drummer Rachel Blumberg, Saddle Creek production mainstay Mike Mogis, Devotchka violinist Tom Hagerman-- are invaluable to <i>Volume One</i>. Deschanel writes old pop songs built around black-and-white, simplistic emotions and dotted with vintage sexual innuendo (see ""Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?"" and ""Black Hole""). Her precious delivery suggests Loretta Lynn or any number of jazz vocalists minus a bit of brio, and the band-- which either builds gradually into its walls of sound or keeps things spartan and pristine-- helps the songs make sense. Ward provides an anxious staccato string arrangement and a Mellotron hum on ""Sentimental Heart"", teasing an optimism that, like Deschanel's romanticism, is always denied. Above Mogis' plaintive steel sighs and Ward's indifferent acoustic waltz on ""Change Is Hard"", her fragility becomes personal and endearing. Blumberg's big drums and Ward's stuttering electric line offer a platform for her elation on ""I Was Made For You"", and when Ward trails her voice on ""You Really Got a Hold on Me"", he's the perfect complement, his voice the shadow behind her sunlight.</p>
<p>Deschanel is more convincing when she's on an extreme end of romance-- either losing it or being swept into it-- than when she's trying to rationalize it. She makes that mistake three times on<i> Volume One</i>. The other sense of disappointment here comes from the promise <i>Volume One</i> suggests but doesn't deliver: Deschanel's writing is too canny (""Why do you edit? Give me credit"") and her voice too natural (listen for that Feist-like crack on ""Change is Hard"") to sit on the tribute shelf very long. Granted, the retro exuberance here will be what sells She &amp; Him to those beyond the indie realm. Don't be surprised when Garrison Keillor jumps on board. But with this successful introduction and the admitted homage to influences it entails finished, Deschanel has a solid foundation for building her own classic sound. After all, she's a readymade star who's already found a pretty fantastic facilitator in him.</p></div>"|11260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11260-volume-one/|7.4|Grayson Currin

    Kelis' 2006 hit ""Bossy"" was an oddly insecure piece of metatextual boasting, the R&amp;B star making sure to remind us exactly who she is and what she's done. ""I brought all the boys to the yard""-- yeah Kelis, we remember, that song was absolutely inescapable just two years previous. ""I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm""-- don't worry, Nas enjoys being photographed in wifebeaters far too often for us to easily forget the image of you rendered topless in ink.</p><p>
    Yet if anyone should feel paranoid about their status in the U.S. pop landscape, it's Kelis. Even with the ubiquity of ""Milkshake"", Kelis' career in her home country has been frustratingly checkered, exemplified by the fact that her second album, 2001's <em>Wanderland</em>, wasn't even released at home. Little surprise then that her newly released compendium, <em>The Hits</em>, isn't slated to hit shelves here either. While the Brits seem to have always gotten Kelis, America has never quite known what to do with her. I guess we tend to like our R&amp;B singers more earnest and workmanlike than the mercurial former Neptunes protégé-- the duo produced her first two records (1999's <em>Kaleidoscope</em> and <em>Wanderland</em>), while contributing heavily to 2003's <em>Tasty</em>. Of course, as the messy, mishmashed <em>The Hits </em>attests, Kelis herself rarely seems certain of her persona either. Perhaps the affirmations of ""Bossy"" are just reminders to help herself stay on terra firma.</p><p>
<em>The Hits </em>conspicuously kicks off with Kelis' two most indelible songs, the angrily empowered nu-soul shouter ""Caught Out There"" and ""Milkshake"", but slamming these two wildly divergent tracks against each other does us no favors in helping to figure Kelis out. They're followed by the infamous ""Got Your Money"", the Ol' Dirty Bastard hit for which Kelis merely provided the hook. You'd think the decision to include this song, as well as Kelis' abbreviated turn on N.E.R.D's ""Truth or Dare"" would've given her label pause about putting out a best-of comp at all, until you remember her last record, 2006's <em>Kelis Was Here</em>, performed poorly even in her most enthused European marketplaces. Suddenly, <em>The Hits </em>looks like an exercise in salvaging a few bucks from a money pit.
    </p>
<p>
    That said, there's plenty of essential material here that's been mostly overlooked over the course of Kelis' spotty-selling career: The winsome, skipping ""Get Along With You"" from her debut record and the arcade-effects thumper ""Young Fresh N' New"" from <em>Wanderland</em> are two particularly exemplary Neptunes-produced examples. Of course, Kelis is no mere vessel, and she expertly provides sass on ""Trick Me,"" lust on ""In Public"", and false modesty on ""Lil' Star"". Still, there's plenty of space between vessel and visionary, and this compilation does a worse job of focusing Kelis' artistic aims than either of her first two albums. The result is half-exhilirating, half-maddening, and comes across as oddly middle of the road.

It's danceable, hook-oriented funk-punk with real-band dynamics and focused songwriting.</p><p>
    The change unfortunately strips Panther of many of their defining elements: Salas-Humara's surprisingly passable falsetto and overdriven Casio tones disappear in favor of cellos, violas, and Joe Kelly's live drumming.  Failed compositional choices no longer pass as googly-eyed pastiche. <em>14 kt God</em> benefits, though, from sturdier arrangements, legit funk rhythms, and instrumental interplay that erases the image of a rogue latch-key kid wilding out over an 808.  <em>14 kt God</em> opener ""Puerto Rican Jukebox"" crystallizes the differences: a jittery guitar locks step with a descending bassline.  Salas-Humara keeps phrases short and shouted, like the Rapture's Luke Jenner, as the track cycles through two or three distinct motifs that never explicitly establish a verse-chorus-verse relationship.</p><p>
    So, you may long for the busy/mad skree of <em>Secret Lawns</em> but <em>14 kt God</em> makes good use of its lithe, malleable guitar/bass/drum setup.  ""Her Past Are the Trees"", ""Decision, Decision"", and ""Beautiful Condo"" jig and writhe around Salas-Humara's spindly axe work.  Kelly earns his keep with spastic, controlled rhythms, coloring ""Her Past"" with orbiting cymbal crashes and adding a backbone of kickdrum to ""These Two Trees"".  Panther sound best, though, when throwing change-ups: The album's only slow burner, ""Glamorous War"", lurches with an in-the-red electric organ.  ""Take Yr Cane"" grooves on a distorted viola riff before a string section ushers in the chorus.  ""On the Lam"" and ""These Two Trees"" abandon hooks in favor of dub-plate putty.  The title track alternates between a playful chant and chunky, attenuated bursts of synth, as indecisive as anything from <em>Secret Lawns</em> but with greater sonic heft.</p><p>
    Salas-Humara doesn't have the pipes to carry a rock band long-term-- see the cringe-inducing ""Violence, Diamonds"", whose ""Cave In, but funkier!""-patter almost sinks the first half of the album-- and he'd do well to incorporate more of <em>Secret Lawns</em>' goofball mannerisms: His Prince jones would sound comfortable inside ""Jukebox"" or ""Take Yr Cane"".  <em>14 kt</em>'s move away from playful pop to rhythm-focused punk leads to some awkward groping, but there's enough hop in Salas-Humara and Kelly to keep the floor vibrating, even if the party has moved elsewhere.  </p></div>"|11197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11197-14-kt-god/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

    It's been five years since Pacific UV's last full-length, with only a brief EP in 2006 to tide fans over. And yet, the first track on <em>Longplay 2</em> (""Alarmist"") takes about three minutes to completely fade in from silence. I guess that's just how they roll-- none of Pacific UV's members will be mistaken for Bradford Cox, at least since the time they faked people into thinking they added two Swedes to their lineup and had a minor controversy about what the actual title of their debut. <em>Longplay 2</em> comes in a no-frills package that keeps facts and talking points at a minimum, in accordance with the functionality of its title. This could be seen as a risk for a band whose amorphous lineup and drone-heavy mien threatens to brand them as more academic than personally approachable. Fortunately for the Portland-by-way-of-Athens group, it's able to stand on its own regardless of who's propping it up.</p><p>
    Due to its rotating cast of vocalists (including guitarist Clay Jordan and Carolyn Berk of Lovers), <em>Longplay 2</em> feels more like the work of a collective than a ""band"" and more of a collection than an ""album""; maybe something like a post-rock version of Studio's <em>Yearbook 1</em>. ""Alarmist"" and ""Orson"" function as the centerpieces (eight and ten minutes each, respectively), tapping into well thought-out twinkles like Sigur Ros' <em>()</em> on fewer Ambiens and more Vitamin Water. Which arguably makes things a little lacking in the white magic department, but if that record was your sort of thing to begin with, <em>Longplay 2</em> will certainly prove every bit as comforting even if they sometimes choose to move icebergs with tugboats. The movements in ""Alarmist"" are slight, but necessary for the illusion of space flotation, while ""Arson"" unhurriedly shimmers towards a choir of chattering electronics. Among others, Pacific UV point to Mazzy Star and Spacemen 3 as influences, which might be the coordinates for Brightblack Morning Light; certainly, ""If So"" and ""Tremolo"" aren't giving off the same moonchild whiff, but they'd still sound fantastic in lunar rovers.</p><p>
    In response to a criticism that Pacific UV's melodies were ""derivative,"" former member Lucas Jensen posted on a defunct blog (to paraphrase) ""Well, we only use two chords."" He's got a point; this sort of thing isn't meant to be nitpicked so much as consumed whole, and a tolerance for a high ratio of delay pedals vs. innovation is reasonable fee for the rewards reaped. ""Waiting"" takes the verse riff of Def Leppard's ""Hysteria"", of all things, and stretches it to infinity over washes of cymbal and a repeated incantation of ""I'm waiting for you to come home."" It might not sound like much on paper, but your significant other could be running 15 minutes late from work, and ""Waiting"" could make that time feel like an eternity of longing.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Longplay 2</em> glides with such ease that the only real fence-sitter is ""Need"", a BRMC-evoking battle of fuzz soloing and detached vocals that's either a welcome kick in the pants or a mismatch with the rest of the material. It can't really be both, but in context of such a welcoming security blanket for the winter's thaw, it's merely a loose thread.<br/>

    Ida,
    aka Daniel Littleton and Elizabeth Mitchell, have been playing together
    for
    about fifteen years and have been married for nearly ten. Though
    they've played in other bands, as Ida they've
    released
    several records, in a typical roller coaster from indie label, to major
    label,
    and back to indie label (the latest is Polyvinyl, on which they
    released 2005's <em>Heart Like a River</em> and this album.) The couple has been accompanied by
    drums and bass in the past, but on this release, they are mostly
    independent
    and acoustic, bending more in the direction of soft, folk-tinged pop--
    mostly string-and-voice with some crucial piano additions-- and oozing
    the reflection that comes from living ""in the
    woods,"" as Mitchell described it at a recent New York show.</p><p>
    While
    the title track is the most notable, a focal point with percussive
    oomph,
    there are a lot of others that are quietly impressive, percussion-free,
    and
    piano driven, like ""Surely Gone"". It hearkens back to the most touching
    songs of
    a contemporary like Liz Phair, though there is just as much flavor as a
    simple
    Beatles or Van Morrison ballad, and the easy but memorable tune from
    the piano
    saves the sweetness from getting cloying or the structure too clunky.
    In fact,
    the piano is really the star of the show here, as ""Lovers Prayers"" is
    well punctuated by the thick bass notes
    of the keys. Like many of their melodies, this one is wandering yet
    repetitive;
    a syncopated rhythm and peddling keys saves the whole thing from
    floating away. On ""Weight of the Straw"", the fluttering brush of the
    drums
    and voice take us to a Bacharach-like world of delicate strings and sunny
    vocals. Yet Mitchell and Littleton, often in duet, sound no more
    powerful than
    Low, who croon from deep inside a thicket of noisy and lush
    instruments. Here, Ida's instruments
    are just a legato backup, an airbrush of atmosphere, and it works to
    their
    advantage, even if the voices occasionally sound like mere powder puffs
    of
    color themselves.</p><p>
    Ida
    have no concern whatsoever for what's cool, but they seem to instinctively know
    that an old traditional of string-and-piano aperitifs, which take several listens
    to know intimately, are enjoyable to a broad and patient selection of music
    lovers. Like Nina Nastasia's collaboration with Jim White, this album has just
    the right balance of popular ideas and remote ones; all are familiar, but those
    languorous tempos and scintillating guitars, as on ""First Light"", are wise and
    grown-up, not trite or somnolent. And  knowing the relationship between the two
    performers certainly gussies up our reading of the songs; their partnership is
    strong and secret, yet it's being narrated rather openly to us: Here's how we
    jointly see things. There are a few songs on this release that mumble and pluck
    incoherently, though still prettily. And to be honest, the harmonies between
    the two are more impressive live, where an assortment of covers and older work
    peppers this mix. But the verdant, peaceful atmospheres of songs like ""Kora"" can
    thankfully be taken anywhere, and communicate a warmth and privacy that a stage
    just can't replicate.

    The cover art for the Ruby Suns' sophomore disc, <em>Sea Lion</em>, is a fitting allegory for head Sun Ryan McPhun: A boy on an island takes pains to try to costume himself, tangling himself in lights and string, and wearing a feather in his hair and a crown on his head.  McPhun's work as the Ruby Suns functions in much the same way: Stationed on New Zealand's North Island, the California native dresses his work in global music, nibbling at the edges of unfamiliar sounds but, ultimately, skillfully creating sunny psych-pop.</p><p>
    The result is an album of environments, both natural and imagined, hinted at by the cover art's pastel Candyland, the collage of African wildlife on the CD insert, and McPhun's tributes to his home state's Mojave desert and Joshua Trees (""Oh, Mojave"").  The album's title refers to the colony of animals that sun in the ocean off of California's Highway 1, and on ""There Are Birds"", co-vocalist Amee Robinson pines for a world where ""there are birds and it is calm.""  A host of animal references doesn't equate to an environmentally conscious album, but <em>Sea Lion</em> takes to heart quaint state park signage: take only pictures, leave only footprints.  The Ruby Suns visit the world via an array of global signifiers-- pinging conga drums, field recordings of animals, slight, sunny harmonies-- but as they do, the band sounds genuinely curious and respectfully adoptive rather than calculating or opportunistic.</p><p>
<em>Sea Lion</em>, therefore, has a fair amount of clutter-- expect comparisons to musically busy peers like Panda Bear or the Russian Futurists, and to the jumbled orchestral experimentation of Olivia Tremor Control-- but the album's building blocks ooze with a homespun grace. Opener ""Blue Penguin"" rubs the sleep out of its eyes before grinding a dirty acoustic guitar into overdriven tape. The tender horns on ""Remember"" are reminiscent of the gentle indie rock of Beulah before introducing a coda of warm, looped sighing. ""Adventure Tour""'s high-pitched, descending choruses recall Avey Tare.  ""Tane Mahuta"", sung in indigenous Maori, provides the sole link to McPhun's adopted home, but the song's furious strumming and dewy harmonies are straight from power- and African- (think Tabu Ley) pop.</p><p>
<em>Sea Lion</em> likely will be pegged a great guitar-pop album, but it's more sonically complex than that suggests. Intriguingly, some of its stylistic conceits-- the 4AD hum of ""There Are Birds"" or the New Order-via-<em>Graceland</em> second half of ""Morning Sun""-- are found on both their most straightforward and best pop moments. Meanwhile, the unfortunately titled ""It's Mwangi in Front of Me"", and the even worse ""Kenya Dig It?"", provide the record its most abstract, collage-inspired moments. <em>Sea Lion</em>'s one constant is its hard-charging positivity; even songs that begin with a slow drizzle (""Ole Rinka"") or hesitant atmospherics (""Blue Penguin"") end up as paeans to suns or birds or-- most traditionally-- love. <em>Sea Lion</em>'s artwork, song titles, and McPhun's background all suggest something pan-global and yet the album shines brightest when it stays closest to its indie rock roots-- a reminder that despite their escapist charms, exploration and travel work best as an accent to the familiarity and comfort of home.<br/>

Her voice often seems more typical of shoegaze or introverted folk than 1980s-cribbing pop, but she strikes the right note of dreaminess and cool drama     in Sambassadeur's songs. The band gently buttresses her vocals with guitar     and synth rhythms that percolate playfully, creating a wistful contrast with     her sustained vocals. This combination of textures-- like tweed under silk-- lent     past singles like ""Between the Lines"" and ""Kate"", from the band's 2005     home-recorded self-titled debut and their <i>Coastal Affairs</i> EP respectively, their melancholy charm and distinctive personality     among their Swedish contemporaries.</p>
<p>The big news on the band's follow-up LP, <i>Migration</i>, is that Sambassadeur have     changed their sound considerably. If they flirted with lo-fi indie pop in the past,     these new songs sound triumphantly hi-fi circa 1986, fitting lush, rainy-day     pop melodies with the ornate flourishes of Book of Love-- singles ""Final Say"" and ""Subtle Changes"" explode out of their     verse-chorus-verse, three-minute restrictions. Nine tracks clocking in at     just over half an hour, <i>Migration</i> manages to sound simultaneously sprawling and succinct. ""The falling of stars     will come back in fashion again,"" Persson sings on ""Subtle Changes"", and it     sounds less like nostalgia than a musical mission statement. The song's     galloping pace pushes Persson's vocals into her upper range, suggesting     hopefulness in the face of so much hurt and regret. On opener ""The Park"", she     pleads with a friend or lover to ignore their big problems for the moment and     just enjoy a park bench together, ""making comments on the people passing by,""     and the chipper synths and the keyboards set to woodwind-- familiar enough to     make you <i>think</i> you recognize it-- give     her plea a sense of desperation.</p>
<p>Even as these new bells and whistles make the songs more     elaborate and immediate, in actuality Sambassadeur sound more or less the same.     The style is still subdued baroque, the overriding mood still dreamy and     downcast, their primary subject still romantic disillusionment. It's fitting     that their cover of Dennis Wilson's ""Lady (Fallin' in Love)"" comes across as ruminative     and rueful instead of celebratory. Singing ""I'm in love in love in love with my     baby,"" Persson doesn't sound like she's shouting it from the rooftops, but     resigning herself to the inevitable heartache ahead. For her, love is bad, bad     news. Immediately following ""Fallin' in Love"", the title track sounds even more     like a cover, sporting a 60s-style hook that makes a sad pun of the marital     declaration ""I do."" This pair of songs, adorned mostly with guitar and drums,     recall the Sambassadeur of previous releases, but with a stronger interpretive     bent and a grimmer sense of humor.</p>
<p>So it's a little disappointing when Daniel Permbo takes over     vocals for ""Someday We're Through"". Instead of forming a he-said, she-said     dialogue with Persson, the change is simply abrupt, isolating the song from the     album. He does a passable job with the slightly more bitter song, but it only     reminds you how much more commanding Persson is. Between that song and the     instrumental closer ""Calvi"", <i>Migration</i> ends on a sleepy note, where once it had been subtle and insinuating. Even the     relatively upbeat ""Something to Keep"", sandwiched between the two, can't rouse     the album's final third out of this dreary daze.</p></div>"|11220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11220-migration/|7.0|Stephen M.

But up on the Other Stage, Rocket From the Crypt are looking like a million bucks (or, roughly  £500,000). Halfway through their set, John ""Speedo"" Reis parts the crowd and challenges the more daring members of the audience to use the empty space as a mud slide; after five minutes of watching inebriated Englishmen hurtle themselves face down into the brown, Reis stops mid-song, flashes a shit-eating grin a mile wide, and announces, ""Ladies and gentlemen, if we have learned anything here today, it's that you can dive face first into pig shit, and still not be famous.""</p><p>
    Sadly, for Rocket From the Crypt, you could haul ass for 15 years, release 11 albums, and even get Interscope to pay for two of them, and still be only slightly more famous than a bunch of British knuckleheads swimming in mud. But then Rocket From the Crypt were early 1990s punks who operated much like an indie rock band circa now, releasing a seemingly inexhaustible supply of quality singles and EPs at a clip that hearkened the current post-blog de-emphasis on the album, while their atomic fusion of Springsteen and the Stooges foreshadowed indie rock's now-perfunctory Boss worship. But where so many contemporary indie rock bands pay lip-service to Bruce's all-American authenticity, RFTC were more proponents of the E Street big-band theory, favoring breathless, soul-revue-styled set lists, titanic blasts of brass, and only the most self-aggrandizing stage banter.</p><p>
    So it's fitting that when the San Diego sextet announced their final show on Oct. 31 2005-- as per their tradition of Halloween homecoming shows-- the venue of choice was not a local punk-rock landmark like the Casbah, but rather the ballroom in the Westin Horton Plaza Hotel. However, as last-show documents go, the CD/DVD package <em>R.I.P.</em>-- arriving perhaps two years too late, but just in time to herald the arrival of Reis' new band, the Night Marchers-- is determinedly low on sentimentality. It's hard to get too choked up when you've got El Vez reading your eulogy (""they were so young!""), and Reis taking the stage dressed as Screaming Jay Hawkins-- complete with nose bone-- to warm up with a goofy riff on ""I Put a Spell On You"". But after this awkwardly stagy intro-- Reis admits himself it's ""long, boring and [goes] nowhere"" in the entertainingly no-bullshit liner notes-- it's all business.</p><p>
    ""We invented this type of music,"" Reis declares six songs in, ""it's called rock'n'roll."" He's half right: What RFTC really do is rock'n'roar-- you don't so much listen to songs like ""Boychucker"" and ""Don't Darlene"" as brace yourself for their rib-bruising onslaught of sax and violence. The chain-fight menace is reinforced by the fact that <em>R.I.P.</em>'s career-spanning set-list is stacked with one-two punches pulled sequentially from the original albums: ""I'm Not Invisible""/""Get Down"" (from 2002's <em>Live From Camp X-Ray</em>), ""Light Me""/""A+ in Arson Class"" (1995's <em>The State of Art Is on Fire</em> EP), ""Middle""/""Born in '69"" (1995's <em>Scream, Dracula, Scream</em>!). Like all great prizefighters, Rocket give you nary a second to figure out what hit you before hitting again. </p><p>
    The 51-minute CD portion of <em>R.I.P.</em> features only part of the full 95-minute set documented in grainy digital video on the DVD, and with good reason: this chaotic concert is marked by the sort of intrusions-- a tossed plastic gun to Reis' head during ""Jumper K. Balls,"" an over-eager stage diver derailing ""Carne Voodoo"" mid-song-- that make for more interesting viewing than listening. But you still have to question some of the editing choices: a meat-slab-tough version of <em>Hot Charity</em>'s ""My Arrow's Aim"" doesn't make the album cut at the expense of momentum-curbing selections like ""Shy Boy"" and ""Velvet Touch"" (both from 1991's <em>Paint as a Fragrance</em>), and while the CD omission of RFTC's one alt-rock semi-hit, ""On a Rope"" suits the band's contrarian attitude (says Reis in the liners, ""[it's] the song that will forever be our piss stain on the footnotes of underground 90s rock lore...I still get checks for $13.92 every year. In some parts of the world I can buy an ox and fuck it for that price.""), <em>R.I.P.</em> feels less like a definitive career-capper as a result.</p><p>
    But such quibbles are forgotten by the time we hit the late-set airing of <em>Circa: Now</em>!'s triumphant grunge waltz ""Ditch Digger"", where, even without the benefit of a DVD, you can just picture the costumed crowd raising their arms to valiantly brandish those RFTC tattoos that can no longer be used to get into shows for free. Even in its dying moments, a Rocket From the Crypt show is no place to get all emotional, but if only for a few minutes, you just might confuse all that sweat for tears.</p></div>"|11250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11250-rip/|7.6|Stuart Berman

    The cover of Throw Me the Statue's debut album, <em>Moonbeams</em>, features a topless swimmer arced
    in mid-air, turning a fall into a graceful dive.
    Taken by Norwegian photographer <a href=""http://heidijohansen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Heidi Johansen</strong></a>, the
    image has the feel of an unstaged vacation souvenir: There's a boat in the
    background, a towel draped loosely around another woman's head, and a big toe
    intruding into the lower-left hand corner. It's well chosen: The casual
    composition and playful flash of nudity say quite a bit about the music
    contained therein, despite not including the name of the band or the title of
    the album. <em>Moonbeams</em> is a collection
    of loosely staged fuzz-pop songs about travel and sexual treachery, possessing
    a lens flare of regret even as they portray the singer-- or at least his
    first-person counterpart in these songs-- as a ""lusty"" soul living from one hook-up
    to another.</p><p>
    Throw Me the Statue is the clunky pseudonym for Scott
    Reitherman, who
    plays almost every instrument on <em>Moonbeams
    </em>and even released it on his own label before signing with Secretly Canadian.
    He introduces opener ""Young Sensualists"" with a brief overture of bright synths,
    then fades into darker, droning chords for his tale of a beach-set love
    triangle. The simple plucked strings, programmed beat, and melodic guitar solo
    give the impression of one guy turning himself into a band. And yet, just as
    the title hints at youthful self-mythologizing, the vacation details suggest
    that the inspiration came not from a postcard tacked to a bedroom wall, but seemingly
    from real experience.</p><p>
    The rest of <em>Moonbeams</em>
    bolsters that impression. Reitherman comes across as far too social-- and far
    too well-traveled-- for such a solitary pursuit; as the cover art suggests,
    he's too worldly and musically curious to shut himself in. <em>Moonbeams</em> features a small backing band and a revolving roster of
    guests, including multi-instrumentalist/producer Casey Foubert, who has worked
    with Pedro the Lion and Sufjan Stevens. There are horns on ""Groundswell"",
    samples on ""Yucatan Gold"", and what sounds like an ambient accordion on the
    title track. Occasionally Throw Me the Statue's musical range seems like an end
    in itself, as if eclectica were its own genre, but generally Reitherman's
    range highlights his hooks and wordplay. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""About to Walk"" begins with a static-crusted pong beat
    before Reitherman launches into a vocal melody that has him reaching into his
    upper range. ""Yucatan Gold"", another tale of a vacation dalliance, begins with
    a syncopated percussion sample that nods to Latin American music, but as the
    other instruments enter, all that remains of it is the cowbell, twitching on
    offbeats. ""She's a crazy animal when she screams,"" Reitherman sings. Overly
    dramatic and more than a little self-satisfied, it's a silly refrain-- an
    indie-pop nod to <em>Girls Gone Wild</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    Following the ""juvie malaise"" of ""A Mutinous Dream"" and the
    hopped-up horn section of stand-out ""Groundswell"", the Hallmark imagery and
    funereal trumpet on the title track sounds too pedestrian, even for a song
    about his dead grandfather (well, especially for a song about his dead
    grandfather). Sure, it leads Reitherman to realize he'll be dead a hundred
    years from now, but that's a well-worn idea. <em>Moonbeams</em> is best when it is least sentimental, when Reitherman's
    antihero coldly accounts for his own actions and confusions. Fortunately, the
    album doesn't end with Reitherman flipping through old family photos, but with
    him softly singing ""The Happiest Man on This Plane"", a drifting acoustic valedictory
    that confuses sex with love. Again. Adding a bit of carnality to an often
    asexual genre, Throw Me the Statue's candor is compelling.

    Aside from a few leftfield fetishists like Abiku, Philly robo-blasters Genghis Tron don't have many stylistic confidantes. And for better or worse, dudes stick religiously to their script on three EPs and one full-length for Crucial Blast-– each an elemental gush of drumerless pixel-skree, nothing more, nothing less. Which is all just to say that GT have always seemed pretty comfortable in their own tiny, claustrophobic box. So it's kind of cute they've dubbed their Relapse debut <em>Board Up the House</em>.</p><p>
    But take a minute to figure out what Mookie Singerman is hollering about (hint: it's in the booklet), and the album title takes on a bit more than half-jokey overtones. At its core, <em>House</em> is a record about the psychology of claustrophobia, about feeling <em>un</em>comfortable in that tiny box this band calls home. Here, characters are trapped in horrible lives, hiding from endless wars, boarding themselves up in houses and eventually, NSFW, rotting to death (check the album-opener).</p><p>
    Overtaken by the same sort of cabin fever that sacked Singerman's pen, guitarist Hamilton Jordan and keyboardist Michael Sochynsky are doing the unthinkable this time out: they're writing conventional(-ish) songs. With verses and choruses and codas, even. Hard to believe, but from the <em>House</em>'s first blow, the frenzied clutter of<em> Dead Mountain Mouth</em> gets packed into something much more focused, even refined. It's a sort of distilled clatter that forgoes the few dozen weedles of ""The Folding Road"" or the electro-grind mish-mash of <em>Cloak of Love</em> standout ""Arms"", for a handful of fat, gnarled riffs, some mega-huge Kurt Ballou guitar sounds, and a whole lotta order.
    </p>
<p>
    Sure, ""The Feast"" is still a wild Agoraphobic Nosebleeder, getting by on the strength of the epileptic fits that won these guys the love of Relapse. But often the new, slightly more restrained Tron is capable of melding its poles-– the coarse grinds and the smooth electronics-– in much more convincing, cohesive ways. Take, for instance, the methodical beatdown of ""City on a Hill"", a track that relies on dynamic building blocks (blastbeat, keyboard patch, blastbeat <em>and</em> keyboard, keyboard patch, sputtering outro) over sheer force to achieve the same end result.
    </p>
<p>
    Obviously, though, a band this used to blowing its load for three-minute intervals is going to make a few missteps. The tepid Team Sleep syrup of ""I Won't Come Back Alive"" forgets what made their music compelling in the first place: the energy. Plus, it's about three minutes too long. And the NIN flatness of ""Colony Collapse"" doesn't do the song any favors. But when they're on, tracks like ""Board Up the House"" make the first compelling case for Singerman and company as actual songwriters. Yeah, the strongest moments on <em>Mouth</em> occasionally suggested it, but here Genghis Tron establishes once and for all there's more to their sound than Cephalic Carnage records and Atari Teenage Riot worship. And now that they're out of that pesky box, it's going to be pretty interesting to see where they wind up. <br/>

    In a
    recent interview, electronic music producer Chris Clark admitted he's ""a
    bit of a perfectionist"" when it comes to producing his beyond-intricate
    instrumentals. This is an understatement. Considering the Warp
    disciple's flair for pinpoint micro-rhythms, Clark's compositions come across like the inner whirlings of a
    beautifully disturbed mind. His beats rev up only to exhale
    into cleansing waves of static; each synthetic echo is draped with an echo of its own; oscillating fragments drift in and out of songs
    like unsettling half dreams-- this is imposing music. And
    without Clark's penchant for bruising emotion, it would be as useless as a stack of crashed, clicking hard drives. The
    human logic within his wave forms is convoluted but nonetheless
    present; Chris Clark is the guy with the bomb-rubble room-- a leaning
    pile of CDs here,
    gear head mags there, questionably clean clothes everywhere-- in which
    everything is oddly in its right place.</p><p>
    Across
    his first three albums, Clark utilized his talents with steely machines
    and warmer acoustic instruments-- including pianos and drums-- to assemble increasingly fluid tapestries, culminating with 2006's
    masterful <em>Body Riddle</em>. That album-- which attempted to answer the body's
    queries from the inside out-- assured its longevity with an all-encompassing attention to detail: Two years later, fresh folds continue to reveal themselves.
    <em>Turning Dragon</em> takes a detour from Clark's ultimate goal of meshing man
    and machine into one seamless, clattering bundle. Consisting of
    material tailored during frenetic live gigs and pegged as a counterpart
    to <em>Body Riddle</em> rather than a proper follow-up, <em>Dragon</em> finds the
    robots taking the upper hand. Clark's OCD tendencies are still apparent,
    but they're conveyed in a markedly brasher manner-- snares snarl,
    samples fire off semi-automatically, and the compression gets
    bumped up to Justice levels. It's the fire-breathing flipside to <em>Riddle</em>'s contemplative stateliness.</p><p>
    And it's liberating to hear
    this sonic manicurist doing his best to freak out. Clark
    wastes no time in addressing his newly hedonistic agenda with the
    appropriately titled ""New Year Storm"". Ostensibly, this is his take on straight-up techno, but the near-industrial 4/4 pummels more
    than it pulses as it attempts to push through the producer's constant
    barrage of air-raid assaults-- this is what Trent Reznor wants to sound like in 2008. Galvanizing beasts ""Volcan Veins"" and ""Truncation Horn"" both employ micro-sampling to punctuate their soaring-BPM onslaughts; in the midst of these recklessly caffeinated raves, Missy Elliott and INXS are nothing but scattershot
    pawns in Clark's twisted game. 
    </p>
<p>
    After the record's initial manic three-track bum rush, things settle into a slightly
    less leg-cracking groove. ""For Wolves Crew"" is the requisite Chris
    Clark album-within-a-song stunner: Before the seven-minute epic is
    through, we've heard the sound of a wood plank falling down metal
    stairs, a remixed alien transmission, and even some sped-up
    grime backed by a soothing, circular synth line. The whole disc sometimes risks becoming a tiresome test of modern beatmaking
    at its noisiest, but Clark is wise to include small-yet-essential
    breathers into the mix-- ""Hot May Slides"" acts as a side B sigh before
    ""Beg"" and ""Penultimate Persian"" close this scarily accomplished
    excursion with genre-melting finesse.           </p><p>
    So
    while <em>Dragon</em> may be billed as a visceral antidote to Clark's
    impossibly complex Erector Set productions, it still has all the markings
    of a confessed perfectionist. Yet, as Clark himself said last year, ""To
    make complex music with machines is actually pretty easy-- it's the
    mastering of technology rather than the mastering of music."" While <em>Dragon</em> lacks some of the pathos of Clark's richest work, he's
    still much more than a mere button-pusher chasing the next plug-in. The
    struggle between his superhuman technical acumen and his desire to
    access nothing less than the secrets of the human condition continues
    to play out here, albeit on a more brazen plane. He's the ideal type of
    musical perfectionist-- one who realizes flawlessness is unattainable,
    but strives for it headlong all the same.

Stacked up against an increasingly cluttered media climate, bands can sometimes slip through the cracks simply because the pleasures they offer don't translate well to one-liners and pithy blurbs-- especially when what sets them apart isn't style, ambition, or personality so much as warm, welcoming production and reasonably sharp hooks. This three-piece from Champaign, Ill., introduced themselves as another such sleeper band on 2006's <em>Kill Them With Kindness</em>: a varied, melodic indie-pop debut album recalling New Pornographers, Grandaddy, and Stars.</p><p>
<em>Some Racing, Some Stopping</em> is another disc of unassuming, well-crafted charms, sweetening its predecessor's already gentle brew with splashes of folk-pop, alt-country, and 1960s girls groups. Erin Fein still trades her light, airy vocals with Tristan Wraight's indie-dude murmurs, but here Wraight is more likely to be strumming an acoustic guitar than crunching out electric guitar chords. Headlights drummer Brett Sanderson helms the production, and like Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla, he proves himself able to get out of the way, so that chiming percussion, Fein's pealing keyboards, and even a bit of accordion by Decibully's Nick Sanborn can all pass by without calling attention to themselves for those who might dislike twee-pop, synth-pop, or accordion. Strings were the most grandiose thing about <em>Kill Them With Kindness</em>, opening the album in chamber-pop finery;  <em>Some Racing, Some Stopping</em> integrates orchestral touches more fully into the songs, none of which linger past the four-minute mark.</p><p>
    Slog dutifully through as much self-important art music as we do and such restraint seems even more admirable, but it's hardly Headlights' greatest strength. Bands like Rogue Wave and Rilo Kiley <em>also</em> make clean, concise guitar pop that's easily palatable for everyone from indie kids to TV licensing crews to your aunt whose last musical purchase was Norah Jones-- the second one. But not since <em>The Execution of All Things</em>, or possibly not even then, has either band done anything as flat-out <em>pretty</em> as <em>Some Racing, Some Stopping</em>'s first mp3, the love-blissed <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/48183-headlights-cherry-tulips-mp3stream"">""Cherry Tulips""</a></strong>. See? That wouldn't be a pithy blurb.
    </p><p>
    Other songs aren't always as distinctive, but do have appeal. ""Towers"" is a slower song with a ""Cherry Tulips""-like arrangement, Fein singing softly about summer breezes and skinned knees, though all you'll probably remember is a wordless ""ahh ahh"" or ""ooh ooh"" here or there. Sanderson's drumming fills the air with hi-hats and early-Beatles snares on ""On April 2"", while the stripped-down title track gracefully confirms that <em>Some Racing, Some Stopping</em> refers to, aww, hearts. ""So Much for the Afternoon"" is dream-pop that glides by like a lazy summer Sunday.
    </p>
<p>
    That tendency to drift, to fade into the background, is part of what makes the album such an effortless listen, but it also makes some tracks unremarkable. With ringing, wistful acoustic guitar, ""Market Girl"" could be a latter-day Death Cab for Cutie song, though Wraight's vocal and lyrics are both more anonymous than I'd expect from Ben Gibbard. And Wraight's whispers are jarringly Elliott Smith-like on plodding nadir ""January"", one of the rare moments on the album where a single element calls attention to itself at the expense of the track as a whole.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Some Racing, Some Stopping</em> is the kind of record, in
    other words, that you'd expect casual listeners to enjoy and critics to
    unfairly malign. Like I said, I'm not thrilled about it, but I don't think
    I'm being unfair. For all the giddy heights of ""Cherry Tulips"", it's hard to imagine many people ending a hard day rushing to their headphones so they can lose themselves in opener ""Get Your Head Around It"", where Wraight sings, ""The things I will keep/ Are never in my sleep."" If you can stick to moderation, the album has its share of contentments-- and a couple of real delights, too.

Promise and the Monster is also the adopted name of Swedish singer/multi-instrumentalist (guitar, cello, flute, organ, glockenspiel) Billie Lindahl, who, at 19, isn't that far-removed from picture-book reading herself. As if traced from some market-tested ""indie girl"" template, Lindahl has Feistian dark bangs and a coltish, eye-skirting demeanor, and sings in a high, breathy, elfin chirp in the neighborhood-- though with nowhere near the fence-building potential-- of Joanna Newsom. That sounds unbearably precious, but it isn't. Lindahl's songs are as indebted to pre-adolescence as her moniker, but they don't document devotion to ponies or, I dunno, Disney's mind-bogglingly successful <em>High School Musical</em>, but anxiety over skin, bodies, adult sexuality.</p><p>
    ""I think I'd rather be made out of porcelain. Because I hate the body as a physical object,"" Lindahl has said, sounding like that girl at the party with her nose defensively buried in a battered copy of <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>, wishing she had the courage to speak to someone (so stated, hopefully, with a smidgeon of self-mockery). But her first LP, <em>Transparent</em><em> Knives</em>, pursues this theme relentlessly with a succession of frigid motifs: shivering lips, frozen sheets of skin, steel veins channeling cold, roots recoiling into winter soil. Lindahl's vocals perch high in the songs' chilly mixes like carrion birds dispassionately surveying snow-sheathed hills for fresh kill. At the same time, she articulates repulsion's inevitable corollary-- attraction. ""When I watch you sing/ Along with that song/ I love the way you move,"" she coos contradictorily in ""Night Out"", more fire than ice.</p><p>
    Lindahl shares a label (and has toured) with countryman José González, and fingerpicked figures and classical guitar cadences mark <em>Transparent Knives</em>' surfaces. The common carp about González-- that all the songs sound the same, even the covers-- might also implicate Promise and the Monster. ""Antarktis"", ""Light Reflecting Papers"" and ""Trials"" are powered by low steady currents rather than fuse-blowing surges, their arabesque guitar figures shapeshifting languorously via subtle tempo and tone permutations. This makes for ethereal and mesmerizing, but not always memorable, music. Lindahl's capable of dynamic arrangements, though. ""Night Out""'s chorus explodes like a thicket of fireflies against the midnight sky, its double-tracked vocals and string section marking the album's warmest, and Euro-poppiest, moment. While ""Sheets'"" organ vamps aren't exactly electrifying, they shade the track with spooky gothic menace. And her version of Carter Family staple ""Single Girl, Married Girl"", trades mountain-folk fatalism for percolating plucked strings and a sprightly singsong.</p><p>
    Sweden's thick on the ground with chanteuse-troubadour types these days, and the more obviously charismatic El Perro del Mars and Jens Lekmans of the scene could easily overshadow Promise and the Monster's dark, diffident presence. Which would be a pity. <em>Transparent Knives</em> is a tuneful, complex-- and surprisingly mature-- debut from a kid who's likely to have even more to say as she accumulates life experience.</p></div>"|11196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11196-transparent-knives/|7.7|Amy Granzin

Like the potent potable its name suggests, the band increasingly feels like a gateway to the harder, better stuff.</p><p>
    If <em>What Doesn't Kill Us</em> carries anything over from <em>Trying to Never Catch Up</em>, it's a sense of variety, although that feels less like the result of artistic restlessness than a buffet-style approach to the Hear Music rack.  The first time around that could be attributed to the fact that the record was Frankensteined from a 2004 release, but excuses are harder to come by here. The sludgy waltz of ""Blood, Sweat &amp; Fears"" attempts to mate the brooding masculinity of Britt Daniel with the fevered literacy of Will Sheff in some sort of Austin dream sum, but it doesn't go much beyond ""sludgy waltz."" As far as science experiments go, however, it's better that than ""Sultan"", which brazenly solders together Billy Joel's ""My Life"" and Spoon's ""The Beast and Dragon, Adored"" with astonishingly flip transparency.</p><p>
    The sense of resolve suggested by a title like <em>What Doesn't Kill Us</em> is contradicted by the album's hangdog lyrics. The self-pitying Ryan Adams grab bag ""Cheap Wine"" sounds suspiciously jaded for a band that finally got a chance to break out of the SXSW holding pattern.  ""When I come into your town/ All it ever does is bring me down"" Michael Kingcaid sings before his band explodes into a ruckus that's right in line with the topical search for easy answers. Half as long, and exponentially more successful, is the two-minute rave-up of ""The Right Place"", but all this blind dart throwing and we're only a third of the way through.</p><p>
    So, you get the idea; most of what follows can generally be filed under ""indie rock"" not so much for a pioneering spirit, but...well, you have any better ideas? At least some songs bring energy to the proceedings: After ""And the Grief Goes On...,"" you'll be headed back to Wilco's <em>Sky Blue Sky</em> to remember what it did right, and ""Resistance St."" or ""Prevailing Wind"" throw up softball progressions that sound like they could've been something with soaring vocal melodies.  </p><p>
    ""In the middle of the night,"" Kingcaid declares on the dorm-room strummer of the same name, ""Everything's gonna be all right/ What you need is love, sweet love.""  Freed by the liberty of succumbing to cliché, they repeat it over and over again before you can hear the brooms sweeping during the last call of ""The Other Side"", which bares little divergence to any other song about the same thing.  That shouldn't come as much of a shock, considering these guys are obviously fond of slogans-- but you can't help but think that records such as <em>What Doesn't Kill Us</em> inspire movements like Keep Austin Weird.   <br/></p></div>"|11204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11204-what-doesnt-kill-us/|5.8|Ian Cohen

    At the climax of ""Pipe Dreams"", the opening song from Magic Weapon's <em>Residue Hymns</em>, Jordan Robson-Cramer nonchalantly sings, ""I've got my blood in you."" To that point the song has been a complex argument of some sort, and this quiet statement could be a declaration of love or a recognition of some hereditary overlap (or both.) As on much of his work under this title, Robson-Cramer doesn't seem to care about discovering or revealing details as much as reveling in the absurdity of bewilderment. On <em>Hymns</em>, the Sunset Rubdown drummer's second EP as Magic Weapon and first with the lineup of drummer Matt Shane (Think About Life) and guitarist Rory Seydel (Shapes &amp; Sizes), he creates a hallucinatory borderland between the real and imagined, his songs taking place in dark alleyways, film fantasies, dashed empires and-- appropriately for an indie band with such a pedigree-- music scenes.</p><p>
<em>Hymns</em>' murkiness is matched by its sense of magnitude. Robson-Cramer mashes surreal lyrics with grandiose, organ-driven backdrops, clattering rhythmic patterns, and peals of distended guitar, like Spencer Krug minus Bowie plus the sounds associated with another trio of interchangeable parts, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. The title track's opening organ sounds like something from ELP's <em>Pictures at an Exhibition</em>, but is lent a modern sense of grotesque majesty with the refrain ""She's having a seizure in dark alleyways and coughing up globs of light."" Robson-Cramer toys with ideas of sovereignty-- ""Charles (the Red One)"" sounds like the tale of a boy king-- and ties empires and epitaphs together with his chosen profession on the torrential ""Sandstorms"".</p><p>
    More concerned with getting the point across than with staying on key, Robson-Cramer's singing voice situates Magic Weapon in the here and now. His vitriolic, emotive, indie sing-yell splits the difference between trumpeting and, well, whining. Maybe long ago mastery could be attained at such a young age, but in 2008, Robson-Cramer's tentative grasp on expressing intensity hints at why <em>Hymns</em>-- while a big improvement over its comparatively muddy predecessor-- is his second EP instead of first LP.
    </p>
<p>
    Robson-Cramer's intonations locate Magic Weapon in a mythical realm, but his antiquarian leanings run head-first into the post-modern via ""Blood Songs"", where he pricks himself and bleeds blue, railing against charlatans who phone in meaningless, pre-fab indignation for rent check money. Appropriately for someone so swathed in sincerity, Robson-Cramer goes scorched-earth against those who opt for the ironic as a misguided strategy of ""embracing all the worthless"" which follows ""the tune of all misguided exclamations."" I probably shouldn't expect anything less than archaic fire and brimstone rhetoric from a record titled <em>Residue Hymns</em>, of course; but it also results, more often than not, in the music itself resonating as warmly as a weathered limestone monument.

    There was a time in the late 1990s when Autechre embodied
    one way of thinking about music's future. Producers exploring the infinite
    possibilities of increasingly complex software were creating new sounds on an almost weekly basis.
    Autechre were recognized as the leading edge of this clan. Their music, while
    not always alien in terms of texture-- they've often favored timbres that
    reference electro and early techno in one way or another-- was difficult to get
    a handle on; the beats were hard to follow; the spaces in which the music
    breathed impossible to define. Music this strange was only possibly through
    accelerating technology, and you got the idea that Autechre's music would
    continue to accelerate in parallel. They were pioneers.</p><p>
    One of the ironies of Autechre a decade on is that they
    still more or less occupy the same position, while trends in experimental music
    have drifted elsewhere. While some laptop producers began to think about songs
    again-- working with vocalists, putting their own spin on krautrock, or seeing
    how shoegaze might sound coming through a computer-- a younger generation came
    at abstraction in an analog frame of mind. They began with crude electronics,
    incorporated tribal metaphors, and forewent the beautiful pure math of the
    circuit board for the messy concerns of the body; instead of shaved heads, they
    sported wild hair and beards and maybe a bit of face paint.</p><p>
    I thought of these contrasts with regard to <em>Quaristice</em>,
    Autechre's first new album in three years, when listening to ""The
    Plc"", the album's second track, which follows the ghostly synth-drone
    opener ""Altibzz"". ""The Plc""'s reference point is electro--
    the stiff and mannered snare drum, seemingly fashioned from tin, marks every
    measure robotically. But swirling around the steady-state beat are a number of
    odd sounds that lend a decidedly psychedelic cast. In purely sonic terms, it's
    not all that far from something like Excepter in their more beat-oriented mode,
    but Autechre's way of getting there couldn't be more different, and process is in part what defines them.
    </p>
<p>
    Autechre's research-and-development-style approach to music making is one of
    the things they're known for, but <em>Quaristice </em>is said to be special in
    that regard. Instead of focusing on the micro, painstakingly stitching together
    each track second-by-second, this album grew out of jamming, with Sean Booth
    and Rob Brown reconfiguring and ""versioning"" elements of their by all
    accounts formidable live show into new tunes. It's hard to tell exactly how
    that plays out, but one thing about this record is very different from anything
    else Autechre has done this decade: The tracks are short (most around three or
    four minutes) and there are lots of them (20).
    </p>
<p>
    While it's tempting to think of this collection of sonic
    miniatures as a set of ""singles,"" <em>Quaristice</em> winds up working
    in almost the opposite way. Since the bulk of these pieces each explores one
    focused idea without a lot of variation, they don't make a whole lot of sense
    when removed from the album. Autechre have always made music of changes, where
    part of the interest was in hearing the gears of the music slipping as rhythms
    fell in and our of sync with each other and wound up somewhere different from where they began; development within most of the tracks on <em>Quaristice</em> is
    smaller and less noticeable, and many are over before you know it. So it might
    be more useful to think of the short tracks as sort of miniature movements
    within the album's suite-like whole.
    </p>
<p>
    Which is another way of saying that I've most enjoyed this
    record when I've had the time and focus to allow me to listen to the entire
    thing straight through. It's then I can follow the arc of the record as it
    moves from the billowy opening of ""Altibzz"" past the menacing,
    high-speed future-shock fuckery of ""IO"", to the nervous
    ghost-in-the-machine drone of ""SonDEremawe"", on through the
    positively AFX-ian ""Simmm""-- with its wired gamelan percussion hits
    and too-bright melody that makes you think of an artificial sun-- stopping
    along the way for the towering beat and acid riff of ""Rale"", the
    disorienting implosion of ""Fol3"", and the double-speed Detroit
    assembly line of ""bnc Castl"".
    </p>
<p>
    As they move from ambient washes to classic-sounding IDM to
    their usual variations on techno and electro, I'm hearing more overt
    referencing of sounds of the past on <em>Quaristice</em>, like Autechre are more
    readily glancing and poking at genre, perhaps in an attempt to escape the
    oppression of so much focus on detail. So <em>Quaristice </em>also feels a bit
    like a survey, an esoteric and abstracted summary of electronic music's past
    that also glances toward what might come. After the hyper techno of
    ""chenc9"", the album folds back in on itself in the final two tracks,
    allowing space for contemplation of where the music has been. ""Notwo""
    is so moody it almost sounds like Angelo Badalamenti; with its a dubby
    underwater drone and clipped upper range, it wouldn't sound out of place on <em>Amber</em>.
    And then lengthy ""Outh9X"" finishes the album on a more neutral note,
    as a steady electronic pulse is stalked by bassy tones that eventually trail
    off into mist in an extended ambient coda.
    </p>
<p>
    It's been some time since we've heard Autechre sounding as
    purely beautiful as the opening and two closing tracks on <em>Quaristice</em>,
    but these moments aren't indicative of the record as a whole. Even while <em>Quaristice
    </em>is in some ways the most listenable album they've created in a decade, it's
    ultimately no easier to parse, and can be very rough going indeed if you're not
    in the mood for their peculiar world. Ultimately, this is still the same
    Autechre, remaining apart from trends as the rest of electronic music world
    goes on its way, their steadfast commitment to their vision being both their
    greatest strength and most confounding obstacle.

For some it was a fascinating glimpse at Diamond Dave's hyper-stylized faux-blues wail, stripped bare of the Van Halen brothers' virtuosity. For most, it was pure comedy gold-- long gaps of silence pierced by a cartoonish falsetto croak--  that quickly gave way to the realization that, wow, as great a song as that is, David Lee Roth is, technically, a pretty shitty singer.</p>
<p>The moral: A voice alone, especially one that doesn't add up to much more than a well-intentioned set of signifiers, does not a great band make.  Freddie Mercury had some killer pipes, but he also had Brian May and the uncanny ability to craft wonderful pop melodies.  Aaron Behrens, the vocalist for Austin's Next Big Thing Ghostland Observatory, is the latest in a long line of supplicants to the Queen leader's throne.  Ghostland's schtick doesn't go much further than Behren's pipes and prance, on which the duo relies to fill in the significant gaps of Thomas Ross Turner's spare electronics. Sure, Behrens' voice is a fairly good bar-band approximation of hair metal timbral wankery, yet Turner's sketchy electro backdrops provide only the most rudimentary assistance.  The album's title-- a semantic nod to a certain pair of majestic French robots-- is pure wishful thinking.</p>
<p><i>Robotique Majestique</i>, which opens with the instrumental ""Opening Credits"" and includes meandering instrumentals for nearly a third of its 39 minutes, could have worked well as the score of a 1981 techno-horror shlock-fest.  ""Dancin' on My Grave""-- passable synth pop that circles around a solid hook without ever landing-- would have run under the closing credits, but here, it's the only even slightly recommendable moment, the highlight of one song after another that finds ways to excise the energy and excitement from dance music.  ""Heavy Heart"", the title track, and the<i> Downward Spiral</i> pastiche ""HFM"" rely on Behrens' empty vocal histrionics to carry the songs, but they don't gloss as much more than extended glam-vamps. Like hearing DLR's lonely voice doing its best in the absence of accompaniment, most of <i>Robotique</i> is just sort of depressing.</p>
<p>Pop trends and genre hybrids don't just fall out of the sky; despite all signs pointing toward unlimited choice and fan freedom during industry restructuring and p2p smash-and-grab, repertoires are still being created to fill market gaps.  In those terms, Ghostland Observatory are even more depressing:  They're a duo, one of whom wears a cape while the other patrols the stage howling atop generic electronic noodling-- not dissimilar from recent Columbia signees and Of Montreal tour openers MGMT. In addition, the first time I heard of Ghostland Observatory was from a DVD sent to me of their December '07 ""Austin City Limits"" gig, coming on the strength of two completely-ignored self-released records on a self-created label (it doesn't hurt that they're from Austin, <i>but c'mon</i>). And: They've already played Lollapalooza twice and appeared on freakin' Conan. I'll guess they'll sell 150k of <i>Robotique</i> and stick around to haunt us with their Daft Punk-for-frat-boys schtick for years to come.  Boo.</p>

    Any follower of recent metal trends will have noticed a huge rehashing of the early-1980s thrash, as made famous by Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Megadeth, Exodus, and others. L.A.'s Warbringer are, well, not only bringing the, um, war-- and as their debut verifies, bringin' it without end (!)-- but also building an impressive underground buzz as one of the premier new school thrash bands. They allegedly range in age from 17 to 22 years, and march in stride with other young metal militia such as Municipal Waste, Fueled by Fire, Toxic Holocaust, and Meltdown. Warbringer's debut isn't only fun and nostalgic, however, but a hugely impressive, geeked-out style-study of the albums that have become the thrash blueprints.</p><p>
    These kids have either listened to the same six-to-eight albums so incessantly that they've internalized every <em>Kill 'Em All</em>/<em>Reign in Blood</em> riff, or these dudes literally sit down and have a caucus deciding which passages sound like they were appropriately crafted between 1983 and 1987. Essentially, Warbringer sound like modern-day E-string chuggaholic purists, and they've made a record that sounds exactly like slightly altered phrases from the early classics. Unlike new school thrash-y bands such as Shadows Fall they don't dabble in metalcore, death-metal, or anything except old-school speed. Assisting these insanely specific and spot-on recreations is
    the production work of Bill Metoyer, the noted knob-tweeker behind
    early albums from Slayer, D.R.I., and Dark Angel.</p><p>
    On the anthemic album opener (and likely live mainstay) ""Total War"", vintage Slayer and Exodus chunklets lock horns while blown out Dave Mustaine–like solos get WWF smackdowns via Kerry King-esque dissonant tremolo bar dive bombs. Extra party-dude testosterone comes courtesy of gang-chorus backup vocals à la Anthrax. Elsewhere, ""Systematic Genocide"" begins with an intro a smidge too similar to key moments from Metallica tracks ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""Trapped Under Ice"", and ""Creeping Death"", but it's then tickled with a little of Anthrax's ""Caught in a Mosh"".
    </p>
<p>
    Vocals and lyrics are also time machine-authentic, lyrically oscillating between quasi anti-war teenage deep thoughts and generic war slogans (""kill with no remorse,"" ""shoot to kill,"" ""time to die,"" etc.) and vocal barks reminiscent of a youthful Tom Araya (Slayer) or Paul Baloff (Exodus). In a recent thrash-revival feature in <em>Decibel</em> mag Warbringer frontman John Kevill declared that they don't write about politics and even purposefully use incorrect grammar to make things sound more ""deranged."" That's fairly appropriate from a sound steeped in mushroom clouds and inverted-crosses-- not always as a political or anti-religous statement, but a fashion accouterment. As we slide into-- or, as some would say are already deeply in-- a recession, it's interesting to note that the blue-collar ethos of thrash metal (originally birthed in the cold war of Reagan's frightening version of GWB's fear politics) is back, loud and proud, and almost totally pretension free. (Goodbye metalcore white-belt whine-scream?) It's a welcome retreat, even if it comes at the price of some envelope-pushing.

    Playing in a modern psych-rock band is, in many ways, like being a guitar-toting Live Action role-player-- reliving 1969 not as it was, but as we feel it
    should have been. The genre can be a playground of vintage
    instrument-wielding longhairs clad in period frock-- if you're at a Mammatus or Acid Mothers Temple show you
    might even see a wizard cloak or two.</p><p>
    Boston's Major Stars, however, have a pretty unique voice for a psych-rock band, but it's kind of hard to hear it on their latest album, <em>Mirror/Messenger</em>. On 2005's <em>4</em> Major Stars
    guitarists Wayne Rodgers and Kate Biggar labored under the
    pretense of verse and chorus only for as long as it took somebody to drop a
    lead foot on the wah-wah pedal and send the band choogling off into
    shred-oblivion. But <em>Mirror/Messenger</em>
    revels in fuzzy freak-outs-- it's pleasantly free of retro-stoner
    affectations and heavy on punk-inspired edge.</p><p>
<em>Mirror/Messenger</em> therefore finds Major Stars at their most accessible-- there
    are verses, choruses, and only a few songs that stray over the four-minute
    mark. The record's best moments, like the laid back ""East to West"", are
    loud and heavy, but sound familiar to
    anybody who's listened to Dinosaur Jr. Rodgers has wisely ceded vocal
    duties to Sandra Barrett and, while her classic rock tenor is more than
    a little reminiscent of Heart's Ann Wilson, it's a step forward from
    Rogers, whose dull growl recalled a despondent Dave Grohl. Meanwhile
    Rogers is left free to join fellow guitarists Kate Biggar and Tom Leonard (who handed bass
    duties off to Dave Dougan) in kicking up a larger and wilder noise-- so
    much noise in fact, that it's hard to fit anything else comfortably on
    the record. 
    </p>
<p>
    The three-guitar approach allows everything on <em>Mirror/Messenger</em> to
    sound thrillingly heavy. The album's title track and closer fits a
    guitar into every spare inch of space-- there's always somebody with a
    spare limb to jimmy the wah-wah pedal up and down, bend notes, and
    pummel strings into dust. As a result the rhythm section winds up
    buried. On ""Portable Freak Factory"" Casey Keenan's drums crumble into a
    dull racket as soon as the song's chugging core riff vanishes.
    Meanwhile, the only way to shoehorn in Barrett's vocals is to dial them
    way up into the mix, making her sound awkwardly and
    disproportionately present. On ""No More"" she comes across like an
    afterthought-- unnaturally Frankensteined over the top of an otherwise
    tight instrumental jam.  
    </p>
<p>
    Plenty of good psych records have sounded bad in the past; indeed
    many of them even made a virtue out of sounding bad. Nobody bought a
    Mainliner record for clarity (although, nobody really bought them in
    the first place). But <em>Mirror/Messenger</em> deserves better than that. For
    the first time in Major Stars' career they've produced a set of
    structurally tight compositions that stand out stylistically among
    their peers-- songs that deserve to be heard with some sort of clarity.
    But as it is, <em>Mirror/Messenger</em> doesn't cut through the din.

    It's hard to believe that back in the 1980s, long before
    forming the Aluminum Group, John and Frank Navin were in a hardcore band. It's
    about as opposite to the sensibilities they tap for their current project as you
    can get; when you listen to the music and take into account the fact that
    they've now pursued this concern for over ten years, it's clear that they
    followed their hearts into the Aluminum Group. Their choice to go with a sound
    heavy on the vintage easy listening seems more apt every year, too-- when they started there weren't a whole lot of people outside of Stereolab, Jim
    O'Rourke, and some scattered lounge revivalists doing this kind of thing, but
    breezy, plush indie pop has since become a much larger niche.</p><p>
<em>Little Happyness</em>
    theoretically closes out a trio of releases that began with 2002's <em>Happyness</em> and continued with 2004's <em>Morehappyness</em>, but apart from titles and freaky fractalized faces on the
    covers it's hard to see what exactly unifies the three works thematically. They
    are similar sonically, though, and these three albums could be seen as
    something of a second phase for the band, a sleeker descendant of the heavily
    orchestrated music they made on their early albums.</p><p>
    The Navin brothers have always had a penchant for literate
    lyrics sprinkled with references, and that persists here. It's hard,
    actually, to think of a lyrical approach that would fit better with their
    sophisticated, highly designed, and reserved aesthetic. John McEntire of
    Tortoise and the Sea &amp; Cake, the latter of whom is the Aluminum Group's
    closest point of comparison, is back in the producer's chair, oddly joined by
    Prada designer Fabio Zambernardi, whose presence makes more sense once you've
    heard the music.
    </p>
<p>
    The first thing that's apparent-- and you already know this if
    you've followed these guys-- is just how much control they have of every aspect of their sound. There is not a note or phrase out of place--
    which could be a recipe for sterility, but rarely is for them. ""Headphones"" is a smooth-as-silk anthem for the iPod generation with
    a  superb chorus and memorable verses,
    all sung from the perspective of a guy on an elevator standing next to someone
    listening to music so loudly that he can hear all 16 tracks of the recording.
    The band's trademark close harmonies and lightly buzzing synths make it go down
    easy.
    </p>
<p>
    The album's bookends, ""Milligram of Happiness"" and ""The
    World Doesn't Spin on Us"", are likewise superb pieces of well-cushioned indie
    pop, with airy harmonies and swaying beats-- the first one in particular feels
    like an update of Steely Dan's best moments. ""Paper Crowns (Runaway Bride)"" has
    a different feel from anything I can think of in their catalog, with a dancier
    beat, an assertive post-punk bass line, and a bed of synths that suggest a lost
    Stereolab backing track. They flirted with this type of thing on <em>Pelo</em>, but didn't nail it so precisely.
    </p>
<p>
    Not every track has a grabbing melody to build around, and
    these are naturally the lowlights of the album (""Atlantic""
    and ""Post It"" are especially sketchy), but even a few of them grow on you.
    ""Checking Out"" slipped right past me on the first several listens but
    eventually revealed itself as an engagingly mysterious track that even expands
    their range a bit. <em>Little Happyness</em>
    is a more-than-satisfying conclusion to the <em>Happyness</em>
    series and, after <em>Pedals</em>, is in fact one of the band's best albums.

    While so many other 1990s alt-rock acts are rehashing their hits on
    nostalgia package tours, Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan have pushed ahead
    musically without having to rely heavily on past triumphs. Dulli continues
    his surprisingly tenacious Twilight Singers project, and Lanegan has released six fairly well-received solo albums, although he's better known for collaborating
    with Isobel Campbell and Queens of the Stone Age.</p><p>
    Dulli and Lanegan have spent most of the 2000s collaborating
    flirtatiously, touring and recording together-- check out Lanegan's vocals on
    the Twilight Singers' cover of ""Flashback"" by Fat Freddy's Drop, from their
    2006 EP <em>A Stitch in Time</em>-- but <em>Saturnalia</em> is their long-in-the-works
    debut as the Gutter Twins, a partnership that Dulli describes as ""the Satanic
    Everly Brothers."" The ""Satanic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" might be a
    little more apt: The album finds them bursting forth from their studio, guns
    blazing but no clean getaway in sight. Musically, <em>Saturnalia</em>, named after the Roman festival where slaves and masters
    switch roles, is a concentrated dose of their usual badassery, never straying
    too far from the territory Dulli explored on the last three Singers albums, and
    even includes many of the same collaborators: wayward troubadour Joseph Arthur,
    Mathias Schneeberger, Dave Rosser, Martina Topley-Bird, Queen of the Stone Age
    Troy Van Leeuwen, and New Orleans organist Quintron (who illuminates ""Seven Stories
    Underground"").</p><p>
    The project's sense of familiarity, however, is not a negative. ""Each to Each"" revisits the eerie electronica of
    the Twilight Singers' debut, a welcome compliment to Dulli's vocals courtesy of
    guitarist Jeff Klein and synth player Natasha Schneider. With its odd chorale
    intro and a string arrangement that shifts chords tectonically, ""Idle Hands""
    builds to a chorus that could scale a skyscraper. Scavenging the gutter, though,
    Dulli and Lanegan come across some new flourishes. Discordant strings add
    tension to opener ""The Stations"", which marches along at a midtempo before
    Schneeberger's churchly organ raises it aloft. Before the Twins can build to
    the expected finale, the song simply fades out, redemption thwarted. ""God's Children""
    settles into a Whigsy blaxpoitation mood before drummer Greg Wieczorek hammers
    out a soaring chorus. ""Who Will Lead Us?"" is part folk and part gospel, so subdued
    that the tension never releases but bubbles into ""Seven Stories Underground"". 
    </p>
<p>
    With a billion cigarettes between them, the Twins are well
    matched vocally: Lanegan sings like he's rising from the dead, Dulli like he's
    falling from grace. Together, they can make a line like ""We're gonna have some
    fun"" sound utterly sinister, which lends these lecherously slow burners their
    peculiar gravity. Lanegan sings ""All Misery / Flowers"" like a Tom Waits song,
    his vocal delivery tripping against the song's rhythms as he conjures junkie
    afflictions: ""Little girls might twitch at the way I itch, but the way I burn,
    it's a son of a bitch."" Dulli closes the album with ""Front
    Street"", which begins, somewhat morbidly, with the
    chirping of birds. It's no joke, but a chiaroscuro contrast with the song's
    pitch subject. ""People to use, lovers to break, handful of pills, no life to
    take,"" he sings, flirting with the masochist lover/confidence man he perfected 15 years ago on <em>Gentlemen</em> and
    seemed to abandon with the Twilight Singers. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's no coincidence that Sub Pop is releasing <em>Saturnalia</em>: The label was home to both
    the Whigs and the Trees, as well as to Lanegan the solo artist. These songs
    plumb their persistent themes of sin and redemption, damnation and salvation,
    but in a way that sounds like they're taking stock of their own long and
    undeniably tough careers, in which disappointment, death, and drug addiction
    are public record. As such, the album possesses a gruesome attraction for fans
    of both musicians, who will hear it as a bloodletting, as well as for
    newcomers, who may hear it as a violent shoot-out-- Dulli and Lanegan against
    the world, their fates undecided. The Twins push each other to go darker and
    deeper, to bare more of their souls, so <em>Saturnalia</em>
    sounds heavier, bleaker, simultaneously more desperate and more content than
    anything either musician has done in years. As they both sing on ""All Misery /
    Flowers, ""I did all I did just to get through to heaven."" Dulli and Lanegan haven't
    reached the Pearly Gates yet, but that's our good fortune.

The sparse Canadian rap canon afforded him plenty of room to maneuver, and he used it to execute acrobatic feats of self-invention. As the son of Teddy Pemberton, the radio DJ for the seminal Canadian hip-hop program ""The Black Experience in Sound"", the junior Pemberton must have been acutely aware of his tacit responsibility not just to make hip-hop, but to create a strain of it from the ground up.</p><p>
    Aggressive mechanical drum patterns, gnarly electro synths, oddball samples, rubbery vocal cadences, pop-cultural punch lines, honor-roll puns: All of these comprised the broad strokes of Pemberton's musical identity, and now, on <em>Afterparty Babies</em>, they feel like the fixed elements of a mature style. But at the time, hedged in by leftfield excursions, they felt tenuous, as if Pemberton were testing a variety of directions before choosing one. Skewed instrumentals like ""Those Sliders"", hallucinatory mash-ups like ""The Anthem (Cadence Weapon National Remix)"", and bizarre Reichian beats like the one on  ""Fathom"" made Pemberton's style sound marvelously curious and questing.</p><p>
    If the satisfying <em>Afterparty Babies</em> doesn't have the same thunderclap impact of its predecessors, it's because that element of adventure is subdued. This record has a clearer idea of what it wants to be, with seams neatly tucked away under a monolithic style. Pemberton's knack for massaging startling sounds into hyperkinetic dance tracks flares up periodically: ""Do I Miss My Friends?"" is built upon a Hanson-baiting <em>a capella</em> ""mmm-bop."" More often, he sticks to a reliable blend of techno and vintage electro. But if <em>Afterparty Babies</em> solidifies the musical nature of the Cadence Weapon project, Pemberton's identity seems as fluid and unresolved as ever
    </p><p>
    Pemberton himself is not quite a hipster rapper, although he does have lots to say about Friendster, emoticons, and Heiro-logo tattoos. He's not quite a nerd rapper, although he does drizzle juicy 8-bit blips and molten, neon synths over ""Limited Edition of OJ Slammer"" while rapping about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. He's not quite an undie messiah, although he takes a few potshots at what he perceives as a vacuous mainstream, especially on the stabby neo-disco track ""Real Estate"", where ""rappers on the radio don't talk about shit"" and choruses are fast-food jingles. He's not quite an old-skool preservationist, although <em>Afterparty Babies </em>is awash in scratching and sturdily linear sample beds, and he's not quite a party-and-bullshit MC, although he's fond of house beats and clubland send-ups like ""Unsuccessful Club Nights"". Instead, Cadence Weapon is a panoramic, everything-but-the-gangster portrait of modern hip-hop offshoots.
    </p>
<p>
    ""The New Face of Fashion"", a nasty electro banger with funk accents, is a screed against trendy couture. On the album's back cover, Pemberton appears in a red hoodie and a peppermint-striped tee with abstract lightning bolt patterns. ""Limited Edition OJ Slammer"", a diatribe against celebrity-obsession that finds Pemberton ""wiping the fame off [his] mouth,"" seems rather ironic on a record characterized by lyrics like ""Say you spray the nina when you're fey like Tina"" (on ""Your Hair's Not Clothes!"", amid fluttering bat-wing synths and deep tone umlauts). At their core, most of the songs here are critiques of the same fast, slick youth culture in which Pemberton is an avid participant, and this paradox is what gives <em>Afterparty Babies</em> its self-contradicting aura. The cover sums it up: In a yearbook-style photo, Pemberton sits on a stool in front of a gallery of standard-issue indie-hipsters (and one Kid Rock clone), included yet apart. 
    </p>
<p>
    This sort of self-contradiction is really just honesty. Internally consistent points of view are rare, and Pemberton makes no attempt to construct a false one. A thin seam of personal archaeology lends another layer of biographical complexity to the statements and contexts that negate each other. ""Do I Miss My Friends?"" is dedicated to ""all the accidents out there;"" the afterparty babies for which the record is titled. A skit at the end of ""In Search of the Youth Crew"" finds a relative reminiscing about young Rollie's desires to play with dolls. When Pemberton says, ""Allegory I label a true story,"" he's talking about girls again. But he's also talking about <em>Afterparty Babies</em>, which finds him attempting to reconcile his beliefs, lifestyle, and origins, yet finding no place where they neatly align.

His bass is the first thing we hear on ""Waiting Room"", and since then his supple, spacey, propulsive basslines have anchored too many jams to count. Fugazi's ideological ferocity and hometown boosterism always got the press, but they also had one of the most capable and economical rhythm sections working; Lally and drummer Brendan Canty's beats could imply funk or reggae without ever drifting from their post-punk rigor, and they had a way of maintaining absolute stillness while Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto thrashed off into the void. From Fugazi's 1987 inception until they went on hiatus sometime after <em>The Argument</em>, Lally remained among the most dependable foot soldiers in punk rock, a born sideman who made everyone around him sound stronger and more focused.</p><p>
    But it's equally hard to imagine Joe Lally without Fugazi. At his old band's shows, Lally would lurk off to the side of the stage, bobbing his bald head in monastic concentration while MacKaye barked and Picciotto wriggled. Every so often, he'd move toward centerstage to deliver a whispery lead vocal, but then he'd just recede back into the shadows just as quickly. He never exactly came off as someone eager to be noticed. And yet here we have a Fugazi-less Lally. <em>Nothing Is Underrated</em> is Lally's second solo album following 2006's <em>There to Here</em>, and the ghosts of Fugazi are still all over this thing. MacKaye and Picciotto both make cameos, as do various other D.C. scene-vets. And Lally's basslines here are basically Fugazi basslines without Fugazi songs attached. As basslines, they're great: sparse and ringing and indelible. But they scream out for more than the unfinished song-sketches Lally grants them here.</p><p>
    The main problem here, if it's a problem at all, is that <em>Nothing Is Underrated</em> never sounds anything less than pleasant, which means it always sounds polite. Besides the basslines, Lally's low-key mutter of a voice is the focal point. Everything else comes in minimal flourishes: muted brush-drums, warm swells of feedback, something that sounds like a jewsharp being run through an effects pedal. Lally's lyrics usually take the form of vague, aphoristic musings, doodles and half-ideas that don't bear much scrutiny (""No destiny/ As seen on TV,"" that sort of thing). As background music, it's not unpleasant; there's a soft, soothing tone in Lally's voice, and he never throws any leftfield noises at us. When he ran the indie Tolotta, Lally released records from D.C. psych- and doom-metal bands Dead Meadow and Spirit Caravan, and that influence shows up from time to time in the form of freaked-out acid-rock organ, but that stuff stays firmly in check, never giving the songs the electric charge they might need. Even ""Motora"", which is mostly just Lally reciting pseudo-beat poetry over guitar feedback, somehow manages to sound polite and unobtrusive, which is surely some kind of accomplishment.</p><p>
    As nice as all this sounds, though, the sense of near-messianic purpose that drove Fugazi is missed. But near the album's end, Lally at least moves towards it on two songs. ""Mistaken Identity"" rests on nothing but bass and reverb, but Lally's lyrics make for a really simple, powerful, and direct statement of negation:  ""I am not a list of desires/ I am not the hopes of others/ I am not a warehouse of memory."" And ""Painfully Aware"" has some seriously funky Curtis Mayfield cymbals to go with its monster bassline; it's a simple stylistic flourish that pushes the track that much further toward Fugazi territory. Most of the time, though, <em>Nothing Is Underrated</em> is an easy record to like but a hard one to love.</p></div>"|11207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11207-nothing-is-underrated/|6.2|Tom Breihan

Mapped out, the members of Black Mountain, Pink Mountaintops, Blood Meridian, and Lightning Dust resemble a topographic chain with shifting features-- a drummer moves here, a bassist plays for this band, sometimes, and so forth. For Blood Meridian, the hashchild of Black Mountain bassist Matthew Camirand, the mission is clear: Create rust-belt ballads that sound like the bawdy, direct, rye-drenched barroom underneath Black Mountain's splashy art studio.</p><p>
<em>Liquidate Paris!</em>, a limited-edition, nine-song CD and vinyl  release from Michigan's Elevation Recordings, is the latest Blood Meridian record, and the follow-up to 2006's <em>Kick Up the Dust</em>. <em>Liquidate Paris!</em> has all the elements of Blood Meridian's sound: dusty vocals, guitar lines like steel twine, trotting, patient drums, and occasional moments of tremolo guitar. As durable and effective as their sonics are, there's a bewildering set of mixed messages on <em>Liquidate Paris!</em>. The title, taken from Danish author's Sven Hassel pulp WWII novels, proclaims a set of intentions: brutal, visceral, and portentous. Even better, it's an album title fitting for their band's name-- that in itself an explicit nod to contemporary lit-don Cormac McCarthy's agnostic, blood-fed opus.</p><p>
    The products, however, barely resemble the intentions laid out in the title. The nine ballads here are lyrically derivative-- ""We were drunk as fuck/ We were down on our luck""-- and more plaintive and petty than any of songs in their catalog. Where Camirand was at least giddily petulant on <em>Kick Up the Dust</em>, here the lyrics are ham-fisted in their solipsism (""Some people say I'm out of my head/ But they don't see what I see"") and maudlin in their stabs at romance (""Turning slowing to the beating of your chest/ Ocean breezes sticking to your skin/ The world goes on without you, while you remember everything she said"").</p><p>
    Trailblazing lyrical insight isn't Blood Meridian's forte, but there's no getting around how detrimental the songwriting is to the overall craft. There are stirring musical moments here-- the glistening piano on ""Walk Through the Door"" for instance-- but they are nullified by lyrical passivity. Blood Meridian aren't designed for dramatic peaks and vistas-- they deal in nostalgic compositions and have influences (Leonard Cohen's moods, Neil Young's settings, the Replacements' adolescent disappointment) inseparable from their form-- but even the modest hills in a range deserve resonant words.<br/></p></div>"|11192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11192-liquidate-paris/|5.8|Evan McGarvey

    When you listen to singer-songwriter Jack Peñate you feel you're listening to an honest fellow with bags of integrity: just as well, as otherwise you might suspect the dark arts of the focus group at work. He has some of Pete Doherty's visionary busker schtick, some of the cosy chattiness of Kate Nash, and some of the brisk optimism of goofy UK chart darlings Scouting For Girls. It's no surprise that he's done rather well in Britain.</p><p>
    This debut album opens with ""Spit At Stars"", all his signature elements on show: the chunky, quick-strummed acoustic guitar, the undeniably sticky hooks, and most of all the breathless vocals and philosophical lyrics. Peñate's thoughtful bent is what sets his approach apart from his pop friendslist: he sings like he's just read the secrets of the universe in his fish and chip wrapper and is bursting to pass them on.</p><p>
    So what are they? Here's where the trouble starts. ""Made Of Codes"" and ""Learning Lines"" tell us that society's structures come pre-scripted: ""Deciphering is the game we're all in."" On ""We Will Be Here"" he takes a still wider view: ""So small, oh so small are we/ By 'we' I mean all humanity."" What's the solution? Well, like he says on ""Spit At Stars"", ""we all got our dreams,"" and it turns out our smallness is what makes us human: ""The stars can't feel a lover's touch."" <em>Matinée</em> is full of these little aphorisms, and Peñate's heartfelt presence means that your impression of the album is going to be quite closely related to whether you think they're full of shit or not.
    </p>
<p>
    One of Peñate's problems is that his gift for showing gets overtaken by his penchant for telling. ""Got My Favourite"" runs through some of his most treasured clothes, noting who gave him each of them. The point is clear and sweet-- our lives are a collection of connections-- but he has to ram it home with a chorus that clumsily explains exactly what he's saying. His quirky observations are always crushed by explanations, and only on his ballads does he stop cramming in thirty words per line. Listening to <em>Matinée</em> straight through is exhausting, like being trapped in the kitchen at a college party while someone with curiously wide eyes Explains It All to you.
    </p>
<p>
    Mind you, those wide-eyed guys tended to have pretty intriguing love lives: <em>Matinée</em> is at its best when Peñate turns his eyes from the cosmos and attends to matters of the heart. ""My Yvonne"" keeps it simple and gentle, a hushed infatuation ballad which gives Peñate's melodic touch much needed space. The best of his upbeat tracks, meanwhile, is ""Have I Been A Fool?"", where he's the one doing the unrequiting and worrying he's leading a girl on. The song isn't much more than a pretty piano figure and a sense of rhythm but it suits Peñate's intimate style.
    </p>
<p>
    The most interesting track, though, is ""Run For Your Life"", partly because it appears to be starting a beef with Dizzee Rascal. ""Don't fix up or look sharp"", he says, while calling out bullies everywhere with the passion of the sometime victim. It's brave, and not disagreeable, and it nails Peñate's appeal: everything on <em>Matinée</em> suggests he's a decent guy. But just as you're warming to him he comes out with another one-liner like ""no one owns what nature's grown,"" and you're forced to remember that good men can also make bad records.

    The first line of <em>Real Emotional Trash</em> begs to be read autobiographically: ""Of all my stoned digressions/ Some have mutated into the truth/ Not a spoof.""  It's the same tease that Malkmus pulled by calling his last album <em>Face the Truth</em>, in spite of its characteristically elusive contents. While that record featured Malkmus fully indulging his penchant for eclectic basement tinkering, <em>Real Emotional Trash</em> is an unabashedly rock'n'roll band album.  It's the most aesthetically cohesive album of Malkmus' solo career (which is good), but also the jammiest (which, here, is bad). The record may sound like it would have been a blast to play on, but that doesn't always make for an engrossing listen.</p><p>
    On the plus side, <em>Real Emotional Trash</em> is still a Stephen Malkmus album, and it's host to all his pursuant charms and quirks.  As a writer, Malkmus remains in top form; the album is rife with character-based songwriting that seems increasingly rare and valuable as songwriters increasingly grapple with overstated signifiers of sincerity. Even the album's title is characteristically apt-but-not-apt; though the material on <em>Real Emotional Trash</em> could hardly be considered straightforwardly ""emotional"" (even in comparison to Malkmus' output at large), there's a very real sense of excitement that comes from its communal sound.</p><p>
    The excitement is justified, too; these Jicks (Malkmus included) are stellar musicians. Malkmus shows off his band's strengths right off the bat; ""Dragonfly Pie"" is equal parts swaggering indie and 1970s AOR, coupling simple and memorable melodic phrases with synchronized, fuzzy guitar riffs.  There are some moments of extreme understated structural elegance here; as the song's chorus emerges from a tangled verse, Sleater-Kinney/Quasi drummer (and now Jick) Janet Weiss' muscular and precise drumming lends the song a unified sense of purpose that's largely been absent from Malkmus' solo work.
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, it doesn't last.  Many of the songs on <em>Real Emotional Trash</em> start promising, but quickly become frustratingly repetitive and aimless.  At times, the album veers satisfyingly into proggy excess or White Stripes-like forceful minimalism, but never commits to either.  If anything, it sounds like the work of a band that knows how to play well together, but can't necessarily convey a purpose beyond that.  ""Hopscotch Willie"" starts out with a pleasant verse (that actually brings to mind the melody from Sade's ""Smooth Operator""), but by the six-minute mark you're, uh, well aware that you've hit the six-minute mark.
    </p>
<p>
    The album drags even more with its title track, one of many on <em>Real
    Emotional Trash</em> that struggles to construct an epic from just a handful of memorable moments. The song’s extended midsection deftly
    shows off the band’s ability to work in tandem, but it's not a gesture
    that rewards repeat listens. Thankfully, the album picks up with
    lead single ""Baltimore"" and the under-three-minute, almost-""Reelin'
    in the Years""-quoting ""Gardenia"", both of which use the band’s strength
    to put some extra oomph into already-great songs. Closer ""Wicked
    Wanda"" is great, too, incorporating enough musical curveballs to keep things interesting.
    </p>
<p>
    Then again, ""Wicked Wanda"" is a fitting end for a record that is something of a curveball itself.  <em>Face the Truth</em> overflowed with incongruous musical ideas, but <em>Real Emotional Trash</em> is determinedly unified, even if it isn't always clear to what ends.  At its best, the record hints at opening a whole new musical world for Malkmus-- one in which his well-worn style is effectively played down in the service of a mighty rock'n'roll band. Otherwise, it's simply a satisfying, if underdeveloped, gesture towards something much greater than itself.<br/>

    ""At the top of the mountain, there is a special sensation at the centre of your body, and you can feel the earth moving underneath your feet. In the deepest part of the ocean, there is a cool and special place that is good for thinking. It happens to all of us at the same time. A feeling of the All-Thing.""</p><p>
    If you were to come across that blurb on a back cover during a random bookstore browse, you'd hot potato it to the back of the display table. But that's exactly what emanates in faintly recognizable vocodered waves, line by line and time-delayed, from the flowery but strangely alluring intro to Kelley Polar's flowery but strangely alluring second full-length, <em>I Need You to Hold on While the Sky Is Falling</em>. Like a grisly opening scene in a slasher flick, that extravagantly over-the-top curtain raiser sets the parameters for what's to come next. An unashamedly earnest record full of with waterlogged synths, classics references (Greek, not Kraftwerk), and above all else a sense of theatre, <em>I Need You</em> is an album which, for its many conceivable annoyances, genuinely doesn't sound like anything else before it.</p><p>
    Sonically, there is a lot to like. A talkative mixture of fizzy electronic timbres, soft disco strings, tumbling harmonies, and smart rhythms, the music isn't really that far removed from the fulsome and verdant template that Polar, a Juilliard-trained violinist, established with 2005's minor breakthrough <em>Love Songs From the Hanging Gardens</em>. But where that debut found the then-unknown musician in mostly timid voice, <em>I Need You</em> depicts him, one album under his belt, as a bolshier and far more assertive presence. The change is most plainly evident in his singing, where the unassuming, rounded off sweetness of his former vocal style has been replaced by a breathless, compulsively enunciative delivery. At times, as on ""Zeno of Elea"" and ""A Dream in Three Parts"", he sounds almost possessed by his own wonderment; the effect is so pronounced that at first, you suspect he's play-acting as much as he is singing.
    </p>
<p>
    And then you realize: Actually, it feels more like he's play-<em>imagining</em>. From the frequent references to ancient Greek philosophers and Greek cities to the physics and science-leaning asides to Polar's constant spiritual assertions (in a nutshell: everything in the universe is connected), <em>I Need You</em> feels like a soundtrack for an alternate universe of his own creation. Much like his dialed-up vocal presence, the change in this regard is every bit as dramatic-- <em>Love Songs</em> certainly never wanted for the occasional proggy inflection; this practically demands a footnoted lyric sheet.
    </p>
<p>
    The highlights come easy and often. The aforementioned album opener ""A Feeling of the All-Thing"" turns that churning spoken-word passage into the skeleton for a celebratory sliver of symphonic electro; ""Roseband"" opens on a set of string trills before blossoming into a brisk, stuttery bit of disco; the throbbing ""A Dream in Three Parts"" rests on a gooey analog synth and Polar's even gooier delivery; and the sumptuous, string-drenched boy-girl duet of ""Entropy Reigns (In the Celestial City)"" is one of the best of the year so far.</p><p>
    Never mind that all that hokum isn't actually so hokey, that the ideas that form the backbone of the album's intro sequence-- that mind/body divide-- have functioned as dance music critic catnip for the better part of the last 15 years; by working them into a strain of music that walks the tightrope between that divide, Polar's managed a neat rhetorical track. More than anything else, it's really Polar's willingness to extend himself beyond dance music's often frustrating, low-risk, low-reward tendency towards po-faced seriousness that excites. Regardless of how you square with his overly-besotted singing style, his new age proselytizing, his occasionally agonizing earnestness-- and make no mistake, some people will <em>hate</em> this record-- it's hard to debate the artistic impulses that led him to make it.

    Food for Animals come at hip-hop from an oblique angle. Or, to put it less
    gently, they do it ass-backwards, inverting the traditional roles of beats and
    rhymes. MCs Vulture Voltaire (aka Andrew Field-Pickering) and Hy
    (aka Sterling Warren) hold down the rhythmic pulse with their flows, while the
    beats-- well, the beats just fly all over the fucking place. Producer Ricky
    Rabbit's loops sound like a Stan Brakhage Nintendo game-- P.A.-pulverizing fits
    of chopped and screwed digital squalor that mash up lo-bit Pita-style
    electronics with breakcore, Baltimore club, dubstep, and techno. But the
    topsy-turvy ethos and gurgling electronics hardly make <em>Belly</em>-- the
    group's first full-length-- a headache-inducing mess. Rather, <em>Belly</em> is a
    giant step forward for the trio in just about every regard. The hooks are
    stronger, the verses are tighter, the noise is, well, better.</p><p>
    In 2004 Food for Animals were loud and messy. Rickey Rabbit used to perform live by routing his iTunes into a smorgasbord of
    pedals while Vulture rapped through a delay and a now absent guitarist plucked out circuit-bent Atari sounds. They produced a formidable speaker-cone-busting racket, which-- more
    often than not-- soundsystems weren't quite up to. Likewise the <em>Scavengers</em> EP--
    the group's overlooked first release-- was structurally loose and sonically
    raw. Ricky Rabbit regularly made use of frequencies so severe that it often felt
    like your hearing was shutting on and off in time to the music.</p><p>
    On <em>Belly</em>, Food for Animals haven't gone smooth-- the
    record is still loud enough to shorten the lifespan of your high-range
    hearing-- but they have tightened up. ""Shhhy""'s shattered synth-loop
    bursts from of a cloud of murmurs and chopped piano samples, with Vulture's rapping anchored by coarse bass thuds. But the tight chorus--
    with its layered vocal samples and psyched-out chipmunk octave chant-- is
    where ""Shhhy"" will make you lose it like  a 14-year-old at a Rage Against the Machine show. ""Yeah my generation got
    clowned and still my surroundings can't even make a sound,"" raps Vulture. ""You look at me nervous with your finger on your
    mouth-- but you don't have to be so shy."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Vulture's lyrics have also come up a notch since <em>Scavengers. </em>Where
    old songs might have found the imposing 6-foot-plus beardo rapping about
    ""elephants humpin' in your trunk,"" on <em>Belly </em>he delivers tighter
    and deeper rhymes about everything from hot days spent with Arthur Russell
    records to his mother's untimely death. ""Every time I hear the word cancer
    I need a cigarette/ I'm not sure I get it yet,"" he raps in a
    poignant moment on the unexpectedly heavy album closer ""Grapes"". The
    arrival of Hy also adds a little more flavor
    to the proceedings by giving the songs the fuel of another personality. 
    </p>
<p>
    But it's producer Ricky Rabbit who really pushes <em>Belly</em>'s game forward. Despite Vulture and Hy's ample charisma, without the upside-down
    rhythm, skull scraping buzzes, and stereo-bong samples, <em>Belly</em> might struggle to stand out at a Takoma Park open-mic night. Instrumentals like the
    gentle and trippy synth-blips of ""Grapes (Preprise)"" or ""Virgogo""--
    a slanted pass at Baltimore Club-- show off his talent for taking the
    navel-gazing sounds of digital minimalism and making them bounce. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Belly </em>may be a weird and noisy hip-hop album, but it's still a
    hip-hop album, and by that measure it's more <em>3 Feet High and Rising </em>than <em>Death Certificate</em>. Food for Animals bring the noise, but they don't want to
    bludgeon you with it. On <em>Belly</em>, they drop some
    incomprehensible beats, make sounds that recall a box of light bulbs rolling
    down a flight of stairs, and put down some pretty heavy lyrics-- the name is
    after all a reference to the belly of the beast, to being pulverized and
    digested-- but it's not a some head-grinding avant-deathtrip.
    ""I get nice and fuzzy with my buddies cause they funny and I love y'all/
    We chuckling and coughing and laugh for no reason while we talkin',"" raps Vulture on ""Swampy (Summer Jam)"", a song that's as much about
    healing as it is about murky underpants. <em>Belly </em>may be all about getting
    turned upside down and inside out, but when it's over, all that tumult will
    leave you feeling pretty good.

    Son Lux's debut, <em>At War With Walls &amp; Mazes</em>, resembles the classical concerto. Electronic composer and Son Lux leader Ryan Lott is the soloist, with gentle, sparse vocals, against a backdrop of classical instruments. Occasionally a single organic sound rises behind Lott's utterances, like the bass guitar peeling away from the timberline drum creaks and overlapping whispers on ""Raise"". These are rarities; for the lion's share of the album's 45 minutes the mood is severe. Son Lux perches over a digital wilderness-- a wilderness of recreated crowd noise, cracked samples, and mutated loops. Laid out as a narrative (beginning with ""Prologue"" and tidying up with ""Epilogue""), with sharp, direct titles (""Wither"", ""Stand"", ""War""), <em>Walls &amp; Mazes</em> has a coarseness, a fatalism, between Lott and the landscapes he creates. It's a heaviness of heart relieved only when those interceding instruments (cello on ""Stay"", the supple, measured piano on ""Break"") twine with the vocals against the molded chaos.</p><p>
    But there are lights in the darkness and a holy ghost in the Son Lux machine. <em>At War With Walls &amp; Mazes</em> is an album infused with a religiosity that's at times humble and unnamed and at times romantic. ""Where have all the holy gone?/ Is there no one to condemn you?/ Where have all the wicked gone?/ Is there no one left to beat you down?"", he asks on ""Break"". The imagery is clear, the sentiment classic, and the delivery hushed and awed. It's the sonic background that's so affecting. That twist in the combination produces odd troikas of comparison: the lyrical concerns of Sufjan Stevens circa <em>Seven Swans</em>, production techniques from Massive Attack, and the classical habits of Nico Muhly.</p><p>
    And even when Lott is playing for us here on Earth, the album's concerns are stained. ""Will you love me/ Like he loves me?"" Son Lux mews on the clinging, almost uncomfortably sensuous ""Stay"". That ""He"" should probably be capitalized. Later, on ""Betray"": ""You will betray me baby/ And I will be true."" (Sucks to be ""You""). Lott is a performance artist at heart-- he's had his multimedia projects featured in the Guggenheim and produces as much music for choreography as he does for just listeners. As an album, <em>Walls &amp; Mazes</em> may have moments of gauzy, near-inert tinkering-- ""Stand"" and ""Tell""-- and it's no doubt an emotionally draining listen, but as a project, as an aesthetic, there's a resonant, engaging conflict. A good friend of mine once said there were only three proper subjects for rock songs: God, Girls, and Growing Up. Ryan Lott proves with Walls &amp; Mazes that he's got the first one down. How orthodox will the next ones sound?</p></div>"|11178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11178-at-war-with-walls-mazes/|7.0|Evan McGarvey

    The conceit of this record-- mixing aggressive rock with dub reggae-- isn't new. Bad Brains were the first notable practitioners, inserting clean-toned dub between bouts of hardcore punk. Blind Idiot God were like if Bad Brains were white, instrumental, and played avant-garde metal. Fugazi's rhythm section had heavy dub influences. For the most part, though, these bands kept rock and dub separate. The innovation of Brooklyn's Dub Trio is mixing them within songs-- or more precisely, smashing them together.</p><p>
    Dub Trio arose out of Actual Proof, a drum'n'bass-inspired band of Berklee College of Music alumni. The members are in-demand session musicians, with credits including 50 Cent, Mos Def, the Fugees, and Common. Two studio albums on ROIR (which issued Bad Brains' legendary debut) led to a collaboration with professional collaborator Mike Patton, whose Ipecac imprint released this record.</p><p>
    Dub is about emptying space, while rock, to an extent, is about filling it up. Midrange is the contested territory, and Dub Trio negotiate it awkwardly. Most songs here abruptly toggle between rock and dub. ""Agonist"" begins as one-drop reggae with plaintive organ mutterings. However, it suddenly becomes fast, mid-1990s punk; one expects Bad Religion's Greg Graffin to start singing. Just as suddenly, it returns to dub. Three minutes later, punk drops in again, apropos of nothing. In ""Regression Line"", the band brilliantly recreates J Dilla's laidback kick-snare patterns, but the hip-hop feels airdropped into its Jesus Lizard-esque surroundings. ""Safe and Sane"" starts with an angry Pearl Jam riff, but cools down before settling into dub. Thankfully, the rock doesn't return-- so what was the point of it? 
    </p>
<p>
    Pouring distortion into the midrange (rock) and then yanking it away (dub) can be fruitful, though. It creates tension, which Dub Trio sometimes finesse, between foreground and background. ""The Midnight Rider"" layers rock and dub in an uneasy simmer. Such coexistence creates cross-rhythms between guitars and dub echoes, which would otherwise merely dissipate. ""Jog On"" keeps its guitars at a muted roar, so that when it goes dub, the shift feels organic. ""Felicitacion"" feints rock, goes dub, then blossoms into beautifully gauzy, Mono-esque textures. Dub may be about space, but it's often merely cavernous; here, the song goes widescreen. However, it cruelly and suddenly dials the reverb back to zero, returning to cast-off Helmet riffs. 
    </p>
<p>
    Dub Trio are a formidable dub unit. But as a rock band, they're only passable. This is not for lack of chops; in fact, they're almost too good. They're referencing the Big Dumb Rock of 90s Amphetamine Reptile and Touch and Go. But while they have the notes, they lack the attitude. Prime AmRep seethed in cauldrons of noise and feedback; this record has a clean, upfront recording. Mr. Bungle also genre-hopped, but Patton's vocals were a glue that this instrumental outfit lacks. (Patton does make a cameo in the nu-metal-esque ""No Flag"".)  Dub Trio are on to something, but they've yet to fully grasp it.

    The opening track on Fleet Foxes' debut EP is the perfect introduction
    to this Seattle band, whose carefully
    fashioned songs reward more active listening than your typical indie-roots outfit. ""Sun
    Giant"" begins with their soft harmonies reverberating in what sounds like
    a cathedral space. With no accompaniment, their sustained a cappella
    notes fade slowly, adding gravity to this hymn of contentment: ""What a
    life I lead in the summer/ What a life I lead in the spring."" The only
    other instrument is Skyler Skjelset's mandolin, which enters late in the song
    playing a delicate theme as singer Robin Pecknold hums quietly.</p><p>
    The <em>Sun Giant</em> EP-- sold on tour and digitally through <a href=""http://www.subpop.com/releases/fleet_foxes/eps/sun_giant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Sub Pop</strong></a>, with a proper release forthcoming-- contains familiar sounds,
    but Fleet Foxes make something new and special with them, following their own
    musical whims as closely as they follow tradition. (Maybe more closely.) These
    five songs-- modest but never spare, atmospheric but never as an end in
    itself-- change shape constantly, taking in elements of classic rock, church
    music, old-timey folk, and soundtrack flourishes. Already mistaken for Southern rock (there's not enough boogie in Nicholas Peterson's drums for that), Fleet Foxes will bear repeated comparisons, both praising and disparaging, to groups like My Morning Jacket and Band of Horses, but those connections are based on superficial similarities like geography or the heavy use of reverb. In fact, Fleet Foxes' touchstones are much more diverse than that-- and not necessarily so contemporary. Until recently, their MySpace page
    listed Judee Sill, Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, and Fairport Convention as influences, although now it reads ""not much of a rock
    band."" That's not especially true. You could also make a case that Fleet
    Foxes' demonstrative harmonies recall Fleetwood Mac; that their rearrangement
    and recombination of traditional styles hints at the Band or, more recently,
    Grizzly Bear; that their short, evocative instrumental
    phrasing bears similarities to Pinetop Seven.</p><p>
    Such comparisons accompany the arrival of most young bands, but Fleet
    Foxes' songs inhabit a very specific, very rural space that's as much a product
    of how these songs are assembled as it is of how they sound. Like a novelist
    writing intricately winding sentences, the band craft hummable melodies that
    never quite go where you expect, but sound neither manipulated nor directed.
    After the quiet title track comes ""Drops in the River"", which builds
    gradually as the band patiently add instruments-- strange ambient clattering in
    the background and simple floor toms in place of a drum kit, accentuated with
    tambourine and a snaky electric guitar. Halfway through the song, Fleet Foxes
    reach a dramatic peak, and their next move is surprising: The music ebbs
    momentarily, as if to build anew through a second verse, but then picks up at
    that same dramatic level. Like the rest of the EP, ""Drops in the
    River"" possesses an intriguingly blunt concision, as though Fleet Foxes have
    no time for the luxury of long, slow crescendos or meandering jams. They focus
    their arrangements finely, emphasizing Pecknold's rustically impressionistic
    lyrics as much as their organic and inventive sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""English House"" and ""Mykonos"", the longest and most
    obviously ""rock"" songs, comprise the EP's rising action and reveal
    more of Fleet Foxes' range. The former is a graceful downward rush of guitars
    and percussion, with a falsetto chorus trimming the music like Christmas lights
    in the rafters. ""Mykonos"" doesn't travel as far as its title suggests,
    but thrives on the tension between Pecknold's wordless vocal intro and the
    band's intricate harmonies. Of course, it careens off in new directions.
    ""Brother, you don't need to turn me away,"" Pecknold pleads, bringing
    the song to a dramatic standstill. Then the band just runs away with the song
    again. 
    </p>
<p>
    The <em>Sun Giant</em> EP ends with Pecknold alone once more, singing
    ""Innocent Son"" with only a few brusque strums as accompaniment. With
    only the sparsest elements, he turns the song into a sort of rough county-road
    soul, his voice unceremoniously fading out on the final words. This song, and the others here, reinforce the impression
    that <em>Sun Giant </em>is more than a tour souvenir or
    a promotional teaser for a proper release. It's a sovereign work: a statement EP, supremely crafted
    and confident.

    Earth's ""Miami Morning Coming Down II (Shine)"" is a steady, sedate,
    chiming march, a primary-colored burst of guitars, organs, drums. For a
    man whose scuzzy, Melvins-mainlined <em>Earth 2</em> remains <em>the</em>
    document for drone-and doom-minded depressives-- some of whom actually
    named their bands after Earth songs/guitar equipment-- Dylan Carlson's
    return as the Ennio Morricone of metal continues to confound. The band
    that borrowed their name from Sabbath's earliest, nuclear-paranoid
    incarnation have become optimists, purveyors of uplift. Where Earth
    once pounded chords flat, the newly reconfigured quartet pulls them out
    like taffy. ""Miami Morning Coming Down"" nods at Johnny Cash, spaghetti
    twang, gospel hymns; even Carlson's newest title, <em>The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull</em>, turns his band's fearsome reputation inside out, offering up metal's ubiquitous skull as the birthplace of something sweet.</p><p>
    Earth's hiatus, from 1996 to 2002, turned Carlson into a cult figure,
    and his return was fretted about by the acolytes he'd picked up while
    he was gone. Sunn0))), Boris, and Sleep had turned Carlson's sound
    into a movement-- a slow one, to be sure-- waiting eagerly for his
    return. Perversely, he came back with 2005's <em>Hex, or Printing in the Infernal Method</em> instead, a demoniacally glacial deconstruction of the post-rock twang that had abounded in his absence.  <em>Hex</em>
    was heavy in the sense that it kept time even as Carlson meandered and
    detoured and wandered through melodic progressions so spaced out they
    sounded like jazz; one thing it definitely wasn't was Sunn0))).</p><p>
    Carlson's concept for <em>Bees</em> was even more abstract.  ""After we did <em>Hex</em>,
    we thought, 'Let's do a kind of gospel record,'"" Carlson told Pitchfork
    last year. Perhaps Carlson just meant strength in numbers: <em>Bees</em>
    is probably the most band-oriented thing Carlson's ever done, as much
    about drummer Adrienne Davies and organist Steve Moore as Carlson's
    guitar lines, which for the first time were added not first but last.
    The result is an imperceptible relay between keys, guitars, bass, and
    drums, with any given melodic line handed off three or four times in
    the course of a song. Over time, the parts stay the same, the
    instruments change, and time slows down-- after a while, the songs
    shrink down to exact moments, static pictures that morph so gradually
    you never spot the change.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, <em>Bees </em>is the biggest, cleanest, and most flagrantly
    melodic record Earth's ever recorded. ""Omens and Portents I: The
    Driver"" has the kind of mildly ominous, lazily distorted tone that
    soaks Beach House records, while ""Omens and Portents II: Carrion Crow""
    offers up the exact same five-note ascending harmony as the
    Microphones' ""I Love it So Much!"" It's left to Davies to provide the
    weight: ""I've always noticed that it's hard to get your playing down
    towards where your heartbeat is... It's all about keeping your heartbeat
    down, for me,"" she told Pitchfork. Carlson's always played slow, but
    six years of playing with Davies (and touring with bassist Don
    McGreevy) has given every Earth improv the same massive feel of doomy
    inevitability. Even as Carlson opens up, and looks up, Davies keeps his
    compositions anchored to the ground. 
    </p>
<p>
    But what melodies. ""Engine of Ruin"" deadpans a kind of flat keyboard
    line which Carlson expands, alternately following along and filling in,
    stalking down every harmonic permutation. ""Miami Morning Coming Down""
    has probably Carlson's purest and most ravishing pattern ever, a trebly
    rise and fall that triggers nostalgia, sunrise, sunset, panic, elation,
    resignation. For a heavy record, <em>Bees</em> spends a lot of time just staring into space, thinking.
    </p>
<p>
    When Earth started, in 1990, it was an oddball project among friends;
    Carlson was better known for being pals with an aspiring musician
    named Kurt Cobain than he was for being one in his own right. In a way,
    <em>Bees</em>
    feels as quixotic as anything he was doing then: where once he spent
    his days stripping down Sabbath to a single ringing chord, now he's
    stripping chords for parts. Amazingly, the results are just as huge.
    Who knew you could do so much so slowly?

    The premise behind the Jet Age's heart-pounding rocker <em>What Did You Do During the War, Daddy? </em>sounds outlandish at first, although on record it's subtle: You wouldn't know what the story's really about unless you dug into the key lyrics and made a few leaps.  Although this is staged as a concept album, it feels more like a 35-minute rush through the head of a man who's about to blow himself up.  And by the way, that's the storyline: Eric Tischler has organized his latest songs around the story of a father and husband who, upset at the government and scared for the future of his family, becomes an American suicide bomber.</p><p>
    Tischler-- the singer, guitarist and writer of the album-- acknowledges his debt to Pete Townsend and the Who, and a story this emotional but outlandish could bring back memories of <em>Quadrophenia </em>or maybe <em>Tommy</em>.  But the end result isn't bombastic or over-complicated; there are no instrumentals, soliloquies, or drawn-out explanations.  Tischler's trio, which includes fiercely melodic bassist Greg Bennett  and the Keith Moon-esque fills of Pete Nuwayser, works across the board better than on their fine debut, <em>Breathless</em>.  In fact, if it didn't have stop for the shoegazing catharsis of the Bennett-co-penned ""Now We Are Three"", it would almost end too quickly.</p><p>
    The album is divided into three parts, where the protagonist-- who is not given a name-- has married a girl and sired two kids, and he's happy.  But he's also growing frustrated with his country. Specific references to the Republican administration, Dick Cheney's promise to take us to ""the dark side,"" or the mother of all sudden terrors, 9/11, are unnecessary, and Tischler doesn't use any of them; the real subject is the character's state of mind. 
    </p>
<p>
    Anyone who's had a couple kids or owns even so much as a nice piece of furniture has probably, at some time, felt the fear that they can't protect any of it-- that while we're supposed to be adults with rights and protections, someday those protections could just vanish.  Sleater-Kinney also aced this theme on their song, ""Far Away"", about how vulnerable you can feel for your kid all the way on the other side of the country from a terrorist attack.  I'm not sure if the sentiment-- or the ferocious, taped-in-Tischler's-basement classic rock production-- speaks as deeply to younger rock fans who are in the ""nothing left to lose"" stage.  But Tischler tries, with the falling-in-love-again rocker ""O, Calendar"". And all of the riffs are stellar. 
    </p>
<p>
    Personally, the album's heart comes right in the middle, on ""Dumb""-- an interior monologue from our hero, waiting out a long commute and mulling over his uselessness.  He confesses he's scared to fight, but he's tired of accepting the ""fear"" and ""shame"": ""this world gave you to me, it can take you away.""  This is fueled by the politics of the day, but the fear he nails is timeless.

The lyrics take a kaleidoscopic look at the slow decline of civilization, through such as the eyes of Alan Moore (the lyrics for ""Leopardman at C&amp;A"" were taken from Moore's <em>Songbook</em>), militant and wasted northwestern youth (Dead Moon's ""Fire in the Western World""), rebels on the run (""I Hear the Sirens""), and, uh, in French (""La Fin du Monde"").</p><p>
    Which, in theory, should work out just fine, as the Dirtbombs were first and foremost a theoretical band. Every record was to work around a new concept and a different sound entirely-- garage punk, classic soul, ""car-commercial"" ready pop-rock (the bubblegum record still sadly postponed). With this, Collins and co. should be able to just line up the records from their collections that correspond with the theme of paranoia and put the pieces together. No sweat.</p><p>
    But with that distinctive instrumental lineup, that priceless fly-buzzer fuzz tone, and Collins wailing above it all, the Dirtbombs always sounded pretty much like themselves. Songs like ""Ever Lovin' Man"" won't get mistaken for anyone else, but this might be the first record where they make decisive leaps from their signature sound: Rather than becoming a new band, they simply shoot for being a more versatile one. It should be well within their grasp, but <em>Surrounded</em> was originally slated to be a five-song EP, and I have the sneaking suspicion that ""Wreck My Flow"" and ""Pretty Princess Day"" weren't among them, nor were odd transitions like ""They Have Us Surrounded"" or an eight-minute noise track. ""Wreck My Flow"" is a leaden litany that's like a garage-punk ""We Didn't Start the Fire"", and Collins sounds like he's being forced to record at gunpoint as he talk-sings through ""Pretty Princess Day"".
    </p><p>
    But there are curveballs that work, for sure: Sparks' ""Sherlock Holmes"" gets the breathless ""Crimson and Clover"" treatment, making it all the more seductive without erasing the trace of malice in the original (""Dogs bark and he knows their breed/ And knows where they went last night...""). And the band sticks to a lovingly familiar script on ""Ever Lovin Man"", where the band cries ""yeaaah"" before its cathartic chorus like the crowd at a rally race, and chimes in on the silly a capella spy riff on ""Indivisible"". Not only does it keep things light, they're moments when, perhaps more so than on any previous record, The Dirtbombs sound like a band of five musicians with distinct input, rather than the many arms of Mick. 
    </p>
<p>
    In contrast, ""Leopardman"" seems too sober for the urgency of its lyrics, despite having a few choice dystopian images (including ""turning CDs into wind chimes,"" to which longtime vinyl supporters like the Dirtbombs add another layer by claiming here.) ""Race to the Bottom"" is an aimless collage of laser noises and shortwave radios gone mad, sounding like the robots-fucking track hidden at the end of <em>Odelay</em>, but without the rhythm. ""La fin du Monde"", however, might be the prettiest Dirtbombs track yet, with the same lo-fi bluster but guitars that shimmer rather than scratch while Collins croons a lullaby-like melody in French.
    </p>
<p>
    The band mixing up the palette isn't a bad thing, and Collins, for all of his garage-rock pedigree, has always been a musical dabbler, not least in techno. But a transitional record? Now? After Jim Diamond left and they cleaned house in 2005 with the exhaustive compilation <em>If You Don't Already Have a Look</em>, the pessimist in me thought they were pretty much done. But they came back swinging, and while they swing a little wildly, there are enough safe plays here balanced with new strategies. So what if the best track is a cover, when they're one of the best and cleverest covers acts running (and most of their originals careful tributes besides)? The band's intermittent release schedule just makes them an inflatable clown you can't really knock down; all part of the luxury of only pulling your band together when the fancy strikes you-- or, more importantly, only when you want to.

It's pretty and beatific, but also unadventurous and a bit dull-- a rote version of what it emulates. In Kiln, Boards of Canada have found an Album Leaf of their own. The Michigan trio processes guitars, drums, and electronics into warm headphone tapestries of lambent melody and skittering rhythm, and while <em>Dusker</em> is dense with seductive ambiance, it seems like a rather disinterested seduction: plenty of stuff to flirt with the ear, little to close the deal.</p><p>
    On paper, it's a little bit tough to pin down what makes <em>Dusker</em> less than satisfying: Everything appears to be in its right place. This album is obviously the result of meticulous editing: The melodic figures are deceptively stagnant, rolling through seamlessly blended iterations of various color and tone, and the even-keeled beats are syncopated with precise yet splintering percussive embellishments. The album flirts with ambient music and dub (the sort of nebulous electronic composition we file away under the catch-all ""IDM""), often simultaneously, as on ""Fyrepond"", with its echoing, clip-cloppy cadence, sputtering loop-ends, and glassy duotone melody, and ""Rustdusk"", a molten pool of swelling deep-tones and fizzy live-wire drums. Both of these compositions are skillfully turned, so why do they sound so affectless? While sonic fussiness is a prerequisite to making this sort of music, <em>Dusker</em> sounds like it fell prey to overzealous micro-management. Since one spitting drum program much resembles another, we count on artists to imprint some aspect of their personality into the medium, and Kiln appear to have scrubbed their music so clean that not a fingerprint remains.</p><p>
    Nothing on <em>Dusker</em> offends, but much of it is forgettable. The exceptions are the tracks where Kiln doesn't rely on boggy rhythms alone to hold our interest, but enlivens them with emphatic melodic content, which makes for more balanced compositions. ""The Colorfreak"" is enhanced by a lively down-sweeping tune, adroitly capering across stereo channels. The hushing ""Airplaneshadows"" glows with a sprightly yet recessed piano theme, and the staticky ringtones of ""Arq"" are closer to Dntel's indie-rock-in-electro-clothing than anything IDM. For what it's worth, I think the Album Leaf gets a bad rap-- sometimes, all you need is some pleasant wallpaper, and they're great at plastering up the stuff. Ditto Kiln, whose staunch formalism works against their music's conceptual strength, but bolsters its modest functionality.</p></div>"|11172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11172-dusker/|5.9|Brian Howe

    The most famous recording from 1969 isn't a piece of music
    at all. It's a muffled, static-soaked transmission from the moon, Neil
    Armstrong announcing that he'd taken a giant leap for all of mankind as he left
    the first footprints in the gray dust. What an odd time 1969 was in the U.S. Here we had
    a man walking on the moon while halfway around the world we had kids getting
    dropped in the jungle to be killed and maimed by bullets and punji sticks.
    Dozens of cities were still recovering from destructive riots
    (a few, including Detroit-- which saw rioting in 1967-- never did) and we had new President Richard M. Nixon urging the ""Silent
    Majority"" to come forward and support an impossible war.</p><p>
    Where had that giant leap for mankind actually taken us? If
    you were a poor, disenfranchised black man living in a Detroit neighborhood full of boarded-up shops
    you could be forgiven for wondering. This was the very type of neighborhood
    Motown was busy vacating as the year dawned-- all that remained of the original Hitsville
    cluster of houses that served as the company's early headquarters was the Snakepit studio. The rest had moved downtown to a towering office building, forever
    altering the dynamic of the label's creative process. Even as the operation was moving
    downtown, Motown was already beginning its transition to Los Angeles, to where founder Berry Gordy had
    decamped the previous year without fanfare.</p><p>
    1968 had been a rough year for Motown, with the riots and
    the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy serving as a
    backdrop for the legal proceedings that followed the rancorous departure of the label's most productive and
    successful songwriter/producer team, Holland Dozier Holland, in 1967. There was a sense,
    not unfounded, that Motown was falling a bit behind the curve, sticking to its
    guns as funk, psychedelia, and flower power passed it by. The hits were still
    coming, but the people in the trenches-- the producers, writers, and
    performers-- realized in 1968 that the signature Motown Sound needed to change
    and get with the times. That meant getting funkier, heavier, more topical, and
    taking better advantage of the album format that had previously ridden in the
    back seat while 45-RPM singles drove sales.
    </p>
<p>
    The Supremes and the Temptations were the label's two banner
    acts, and they'd joined forces in late 1968 for a television special that
    ultimately spawned a couple of LPs and a raft of hit singles, not to mention a
    second TV extravaganza in 1969. Both acts had also ended the year with singles
    that were among Motown's most socially conscious to date-- the Supremes'
    child-out-of-wedlock narrative ""Love Child"" and the Temptations' thunderous
    psychedelic soul masterpiece ""Cloud Nine"". The latter, with its traded leads
    between all five voices, hard beat, and crunchy wah-wah guitar, became the A-side blueprint for the Tempts and producer Norman Whitfield in 1969, from
    ""Runaway Child Running Wild"" (edited down from its nine-minute LP runtime for
    the single) to the funked-up love song ""I Can't Get Next to You"". By the end of
    the year, they were off to the ""Psychedelic Shack"" and in the middle of a
    mind-blowing run of hits.
    </p>
<p>
    The Supremes, on the other hand, were in for a world of
    change. They'd officially been Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes since mid-1967,
    and Gordy was dead-set on breaking Ross out of the group and getting her solo
    career started. He spent most of the year looking for a high note for her to
    leave the group on, which finally came in October, when Johnny Bristol, who
    spent 1969 establishing himself as one of the label's top producers, dusted off
    an old gem he'd written in 1961 for himself and Jackey Beavers, ""Someday We'll
    Be Together"". It was a wistful, weightless track that became the label's last
    number one of the 60s and gave Ross her final peak with the Supremes, the other
    two of whom didn't even appear on the single.
    </p>
<p>
    It's narratives like this that Hip-O Select's <em>Complete
    Motown Singles</em> series follows so well-- you can listen to what each artist did
    each year, how the label chose follow-ups to big hits, where the ups and downs
    were, and what the label tried that didn't work, all together in chronological
    order and with hugely informative notes for every release. It's these last two
    things that really spike the value of the sets-- almost everybody knows the hits,
    and soul collectors are bound to know the B-sides, but the forays into country
    and crooner records, half-hearted attempts to crack the rock market, and weird
    novelties tend to get lost in the shuffle.
    </p>
<p>
    Some get lost for a reason, of course. This set includes a
    single by Soupy Sales parodying ""MacArthur Park"" (which itself was written by
    former Motown songwriter Jimmy Webb) that is just not funny, and the ""punch-in""
    comedy routine ""The Luney Landing"", which features corny announcers asking
    questions of astronauts and receives answers in the form of brief song clips,
    is best forgotten. There are a few easy listening sides that don't wear very
    well either, but for sitting through each of these you get treasures in return.
    For instance, there are two brilliant singles by the Fantastic Four, a vocal
    group that regrettably never managed to get much attention during its time at
    the label. There is also a scattering of jazz instrumentals worth hearing.
    </p>
<p>
    Another thing that makes this set fascinating is that it catches
    Motown in full-fledged transition, casting a much wider net than usual and
    upgrading the equipment. Motown got its first 16-track boards that year, and a
    cover of the Band's ""The Weight"" by Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes and the
    Tempations became the label's first stereo single. Shorty Long and original
    Funk Brothers drummer Benny Benjamin both died far too soon, Harvey Fuqua and
    Billy Eckstine left, and the Marvelettes, Motown's first hit girl group, called
    it quits. Whitfield's aggressive new funk style paid dividends not only the
    Temptations, but for Marvin Gaye and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips as well, while
    Johnny Bristol was busy taking Junior Walker, long the personification of grit
    at Motown, in the other direction, sanding off the hardest edges to deliver a
    truckload of hits.
    </p>
<p>
    Two new labels joined the fold that year as well, essentially
    making 1969 the year Motown stopped dabbling in other sounds and started
    genuinely branching out. Hugh Masekela and Stewart Levine's Chisa label was
    founded in 1965 to promote African sounds in the U.S., and it became part of the
    Motown family in 1969. Actually, there aren't any African artists in the clutch
    of singles Chisa released that year, but there are a number of adventurous jazz
    and funk sides, including Monk Montgomery's wild electric bass-lead cover of
    Stevie Wonder's ""A Place
    in the Sun"". If only James Jamerson had been given a similar chance.
    </p>
<p>
    The other new label was Rare Earth, Motown's rock label,
    coined for a Detroit
    rock band of the same name that would become its flagship act. Early on, Rare
    Earth focused on licensing British and Australian rock singles for the U.S.
    market, including discs by the Pretty Things and the Easybeats (none of these
    are included here because Motown never owned them), but the intention was
    always to produce new material. Rare Earth's first single flopped, but it's
    worth hearing. The real gem from that label's first year, though, is former
    Vancouver Wes Henderson's ""In Bed"", b/w ""Reality"", a double-sided blast of
    psychedelic soul that's the closest thing to an answer to Hendrix Motown ever
    put out.
    </p>
<p>
    There are other tremendous sides lurking on these six discs.
    Chuck Jackson's ""Are You Lonely For Me Baby"" is a brilliant, funky song that
    hints at Southern soul and balances the heavy beat of its verses with a subdued
    chorus featuring the Andantes, Motown's long-time female backing vocal corps,
    singing the title. And Edwin Starr's first smash, ""Twenty-Five Miles"", kicks
    the whole thing off with a stomping, powerhouse performance, both from Starr,
    who's at the peak of his screaming, grunting brilliance, and the Funk Brothers,
    who hammer home the song's fitting message of resolve to reach a goal. The goal
    in the song is a woman, but it could easily scan as a metaphor for Motown
    itself as the calendar flipped.
    </p>
<p>
    All of this is fantastic, but we haven't even gotten to the
    biggest seismic event of 1969 for Motown: the arrival of the Jackson 5. Gordy
    had been hearing about them from his artists for about a year, but remained
    skeptical, being generally against the concept of ""kids groups,"" as he called
    them. And then he heard them. This was no ordinary kids group-- they'd been
    drilled into a dynamic unit by their father, and they possessed a magnetic
    focal point in young Michael, who tackled adult lyrical themes with a range of
    expression well beyond his years. Deke Richards had been kicking around a song
    called ""I Wanna Be Free,"" intended for Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, but
    brought it to Gordy when the Five joined the label. A few re-writes later, it
    was ""I Want You Back"", an instant number one and one of the best debut singles
    ever.
    </p>
<p>
    Tellingly, ""I Want You Back"" was written, rehearsed, and
    recorded in L.A., and Gordy generally kept the Jackson 5 away from Detroit. The song's
    writing credit also went to The Corporation<sup>TM</sup>, a group of long-tenured Motown
    writers (including Gordy) who'd previously credited themselves as the Clan
    several times. This L.A.-centric approach and depersonalization of the credits-- to
    something called the Corporation, no less-- signaled a huge change for the
    company's way of doing business, and solidified the various arrows pointing
    toward the company's future out West. Crediting a song to the Corporation just
    a couple of months after Woodstock had re-energized the hippie movement also
    strikes me today as woefully out of step with the zeitgeist of the era-- Motown's
    own Temptations had scored a huge hit earlier that year with ""Don't Let the
    Joneses Get You Down"", a sharp-tongued takedown of rampant consumerism.
    </p>
<p>
    And in the end, the hippies carried the day, as far as
    popular memory is concerned. Motown had hit after hit in 1969, but perhaps the
    signature musical moment of the year came far away, on a farm in upstate New
    York, when Jimi Hendrix had his electrified way with the ""Star Spangled Banner"",
    a rendition that captured in the starkest possible terms the complex feelings that came with being an American. There
    we were on the moon, and there we were in Vietnam, and finding the thread
    between those things was tough. Motown couldn't find it either, but the label
    did regain its footing in 1969, and this set makes that fact undeniable.

    Calling Valet constant Honey Owens a Portland musician is a
    simplification: Aside from two LPs in two years as the spectral Valet,
    Owens has contributed to Jackie O-Motherfucker and Dark Yoga. She's a
    member of broken funk trio Nudge and the touring bassist for Kranky
    labelmate Atlas Sound. She also co-owns Rad Summer, a hand-me-down and
    homemade clothing store that sells local music, hangs local art,
    repurposes used bikes, and, of course, hosts shows. Owens also
    co-founded and booked Dunes, a music club that the <em>Portland Mercury </em>calls
    the city's ""hippest dark hallway/dance club,"" and she runs the tiny
    Yarnlazer label with her longtime boyfriend, White Rainbow's Adam
    Forkner. Owens, if anything, is a Portland mixed-media outlet and
    conduit.</p><p>
<em>Naked Acid</em>, the follow-up to 2007's Valet debut <em>Blood is Clean</em>,
    functions with the same parts-into-a-whole synergy as its creator. The
    first five songs work almost exclusively through distended sounds,
    creeping up through patient drones, manipulated vocals, and
    echo-in-canyon drums to slow payoffs. The sixth song, ""Fire"", is a
    lovesick ballad, an elliptical guitar/voice/tape-hiss first-take that
    Owens admits is about giving up drugs. The final song explodes the
    sounds of the first five beneath a noisy, throbbing beat, like Neil
    Campbell's Astral Social Club ripping Valet apart and spinning
    everything back on the faster reel. On first listen, such a sequence
    may seem like a ruse or even an apology: After 35 minutes of long-form
    washes and only slightly comprehensible vocals, ""Fire"", the shortest
    thing here and the most straightforward Valet song released to date,
    could be an attempt at relief or a stab at a single (which it was, in
    2007, as a 7"" for Burnt Brown Sounds). The same goes for beat-and-synth
    closer ""Streets"", a track that could give attention-deficient mp3
    bloggers a toe-tap inlet into a record they'd otherwise ignore. Or
    perhaps Owens is offering herself an outlet for how future Valet
    records may sound.</p><p>
    But keep listening, and it seems that the album-length incorporation
    of three distinct Valet styles is more a reflection of individual
    tracks themselves than an attempt to find common ground with a new lot
    of Kranky converts (see also: Deerhunter/Atlas Sound patrons). The
    ""ambient"" songs aren't ambient at all. Nothing is played too straight
    on those first five, their textures teeming with variety: Over a matrix
    of manipulated chimes and bowls, Owens and Adrian Orange combine for a
    ghastly duet on opener ""We Went There"". Her acid guitar tone slowly
    spills over the singing before an enormous electronic wash supplants
    it, too, sustaining the mood but slowly fading away. ""Kehaar"" sounds
    like Delta blues choking on lithium pills, a direct beat pulsing behind
    one chord and Owens' wounded whisper. Over five minutes, sheets of
    noise appear from beneath, slowly drowning Owens. They're all that
    matter as the song peaks, as with album highlight ""Fuck It"": In five
    minutes, it goes from a dramatic poetry reading backed by ragged,
    glorious guitar into a restrained Magik Markers noize + drumz berating.
    </p>
<p>
    Thing is, these layers aren't immediately apparent: <em>Naked Acid </em>is a well-conceived and executed <em>album</em>, all its variety sewn into a single quilt that's strangely comforting and surprisingly sensible. The advance of <em>Naked Acid</em>
    is substantial if subtle, as with most everything Owens has committed
    to tape. Owens has finally incorporated her varied musical interests
    into one record, something she implies with the first five tracks but
    explains with the last two. After all, she says these songs--
    elliptical but elegant, woven from phrases like ""trees susurration,
    influential lake"" and ""warm kept my future cat""-- were written about
    specific people and events in Portland. These are things she's seen and
    lived. <em>Blood is Clean</em> was a fine series of snapshots connected by poetic vagaries, warped tones, and low-lying dynamics. <em>Naked Acid</em> is that, too, but here, Owens' different ideas finally feel like one long thought from one highly engaged person.

This might be a little of what went on with His Name Is Alive's last record, <em>Detrola</em>. The album was a gorgeous accomplishment, pulling threads of American music-- folk, blues, r&amp;b, gospel-- together with synthesizers and obsessive attention to sound and space, and coming up with a sound that was entirely unique, remarkably natural, and thoroughly pop; it collected, quietly, a decent number of glowing reviews. (That includes <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/18514-detrola""><strong>one from me, here.</strong></a>) But it also has a lot of the qualities that make critical darlings hard to make big waves about: This was sedate and cerebral stuff, on a ""small"" release from an older guy, holed up in his studio, working in an aesthetic that felt insular, personal, not-for-everyone. Not exactly the kind of thing that goes in headlines and on covers, even if it turns out incredibly well. And hey, what do I know: Plenty of people listened to it and didn't hear much of interest to fuss over.</p><p>
<em>Xmmer</em>, the latest from Warn Defever and company, is a sort of companion piece to <em>Detrola</em>, but it goes a whole lot further in that not-for-everyone direction. The tracks here have less of the pop precision that marked its predecessor, as if they were side material from the same sessions; they're also a lot more synth-free, focusing in on the twang of more traditional instruments. The set sprawls and meanders, and the vocals-- unlike <em>Detrola</em>'s rotating cast of singers-- come entirely from the close-miked, sleepy-sounding woman called Andy FM, whose voice and melodies always feel more like chants or humming; they're incredibly low on affect, a dealbreaker for the many, many listeners who justifiably expect singers to be expressive. These songs don't reach out and grab you: They sit patiently, waiting for you to dive and sink even further into the band's current sound-- specifically the droning, old-weird-America side of it, where everything sounds like dive-bar jukeboxes and dirges.</p><p>
    They're also filled with great ideas, though-- even if a lot of them are the sorts that'll mostly blow the minds of other people who play or record music. The most arresting is ""The Wolf Put His Mouth on Me"", and its curious arrangement is more proof that Defever can organize sounds in ways you're not likely to get from anyone else. Maybe he's just been listening to the African band Konono No. 1: First comes what sounds like a slightly overdriven thumb piano, then a clean one; then a tense clatter of drums, spread interestingly across speakers; then saxophones pushing along; then a psychedelic guitar line. These are the thrills of a studio rat-- you don't look for the melody to develop or the chords to change, you just marvel at the tones, the rhythms, and the astounding and original ways noises are being arranged in space.</p><p>
    There are plenty of those moments, many of them in minor keys, and many of them finding the kinships and middle spaces between different strains of music: central-African rhythm and dark folk, funeral marches and r&amp;b, bluesy country and sunny pop. There's some of <em>Detrola</em>'s dabbling in Bacharach-styled pop (""This Is My Confession""), a few looks back at the kind of work this band did in the 1990s (""Oh Miss Flower""), some weirdified German-style pulse (""Sangaree""), and another ""Wolf""-style clatter on ""Come out the Wilderness"". And yet, for such a grab-bag of interesting sonic ideas, it floats by with a certain dirgey sameyness, as if melody and motion are far from its chief concerns. Think of this one as a B-album-- all the fascinating ideas that require more of your patience and indulgence than <em>Detrola </em>ever did, something for fans to chew on while we wait to see if another great one is on the way.</p></div>"|11175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11175-xmmer/|5.8|Nitsuh Abebe

Just as Lupe Fiasco diverts interviews to boast about his gully Chicago upbringing, Stones Throw interrupts its wise exploration of alternative hip-hop and puts its goodwill on the line in order to release a thoroughly mediocre gangsta rap album.</p><p>
    Not that <em>Ode to the Ghetto</em> was likely to be any better in the event it was inspired by cartoons and video games instead of more traditional muses, since like his namesake, Simpson creates a document of violent crime that's hard to take seriously even if it's based in reality.  Detroit's reputation obviously precedes itself, and yet Motor City native Simpson robs the city of its menace by presenting it in the most generic terms possible here, rendering it as replicable as a Levittown.  Dope boys have the block on lock (""Footwork"") and are more admirable than the cops trying to stop them (""Pigs"").  Guns pop off and mouthy bitches won't shut the fuck up (""She Won't Stay at Home"").  Perhaps it's meant as some sort of commentary on the universality of ghetto hardship, but I think that's giving Simpson far too much credit after suffering though the pointedly low ambitions of ""The Real Me"" and ""Getting Bitches"" (rhymes with ""getting riches""), or hearing Sean P show him how this C-list rap shit is done (""Run"").</p><p>
    At the very least, Simpson finds more inspiration in popular undie rap's leading beatsmiths; Madlib, Oh No, Black Milk, and J Dilla (oddly responsible for championing this dude) gamely give ""A"" efforts while Simpson ramrods everything with a bullish flow reminiscent of a blue-collar hardhead like Obie Trice.  At times, he'll wisely refrain from any sort of attempt at a hook, but the times he goes in-- the off-key ramble of ""Robbery"", for one-- are painful. And his attempted slang-slinging on ""Footwork""
    makes Juelz Santana's awkward ""Clockwork"" sound Webster's-bound.</p><p>
    If you're feeling generous, you might call ""I Must Love You"" Simpson's Mike Skinner moment; potentially penetrating in its detail, an already faltering relationship is upset by a perceived flirtation in a Red Lobster.  But Simpson's boredom with the actual argument with his girlfriend spills over to him sounding bored relating the story, at which point you want to be involved in this about as much as he did.  He eventually closes it with ""why you actin' like a bitch again,"" a question that really can never be answered, but it's appropriately honest for a record that's mostly incapable of inspiring any sort of meaningful reaction.</p></div>"|11171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11171-ode-to-the-ghetto/|4.5|Ian Cohen

Between 1978 and 1984, they made some extraordinary records-- explicitly political, full of raging wit and anarchist-utopian harangues-- and wrote some great songs in response to the headlines of their moment. But even their best songs depended on their cultural context. What mattered with Crass was the entire package: not just the music, as explosive as it sometimes was, but the way it was a part of their organization, their ideas about politics and economics, their design sense, and the autonomous way they lived their lives. Covering their songs makes about as much sense as covering ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"".</p><p>
    So jokey NYC singer-songwriter Jeffrey Lewis making an album of a dozen re-arranged Crass songs is an audacious idea, but it's also a terrible idea. What Lewis has in common with them is frustrated-idealist politics and a penchant for lyrics that rattle on and on. He's a funny lyricist and a good cartoonist, but his recordings are almost entirely a delivery system for words; it's hard to imagine anybody listening to them for their sound. It's also hard to imagine anyone wanting to hear <em>12 Crass Songs</em> more than once when listening to one of Lewis's ""real"" albums, or alternately an actual Crass album, is an option.</p><p>
    Thankfully, Lewis doesn't try to sound at all like Crass-- he translates all the songs into his own idiom. But that idiom mangles them. His voice is flat and uncertain, both in affect and in pitch; he mostly sticks to one or two notes, which gets old fast when he's delivering Crass's 800-word lyrics; his arrangements, for the most part, are straightforward guitar/drum acoustic-antifolkie stuff, with occasional string and organ parts or Helen Schreiner's equally wobbly voice chiming in. The formal disconnect between source and style actually sort of works once, on the anarchist manifesto ""Big A Little A""-- partly because the song's almost a jumprope rhyme (""No one ever changed the church by pulling down a steeple/ Systems aren't made of bricks, they're mostly made of people""), partly because Lewis doesn't shy away from its potential for big noise.  </p><p>
    Twelve is eleven too many, but that song, by itself, would've been a clever gesture. Still, to make music in Crass's spirit isn't to repeat their utterances but to follow their example. (No American musician has come up with a response to the Iraq war as furious, direct and daring as Crass's string of records about the Falklands war: ""Sheep Farming in the Falklands"", ""How Does It Feel to Be the Mother of 1000 Dead?"", and ""Yes Sir, I Will"".) When Lewis and Schreiner chant the 27-year-old couplet ""Be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do/ I am he and she is she, but you're the only you"", it's hard to tell if they're missing the point on purpose.</p></div>"|11170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11170-12-crass-songs/|2.3|Douglas Wolk

Sweden's Sarah Assbring sculpts her high-concept pop out of similar emotional extremes-- and quasi-religious themes-- on her third album as El Perro del Mar, <em>From the Valley to the Stars</em> (out now in Sweden, and coming to the U.S. in April on <a href=""http://www.controlgroupco.com/tcg.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>the Control Group</strong></a>), which suggests in its title both the deepest depths and the most exalted heights. On El Perro del Mar's self-titled 2006 breakthrough album, the agony rained down from Assbring's voice, contrasting exquisitely with the ecstatic Phil Spector-style production, sashaying girl-group rhythms, and songs about candy. Her latest leaves its ecstasy to uplifting lyrics and lets the vocals' agony seep into starker, sadder arrangements. The result is an album that's more conceptually unified than its predecessor and has its share of intimately compelling songs, but could also stand to give its misery a little more company.</p><p>
    Last year, ex-Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman made her solo debut under the name Taken By Trees with an album that put Spectorian instrumental flourishes into the sparser vocabulary of melancholic folk-pop. Called <em>Open Field</em>, the introspective record found a barren, beautiful middle ground <em>between</em> El Perro del Mar's valley and stars. Here, Assbring sends out forlorn-sounding songs about hope, happiness, imagination, the sun, the time we have left, and other precious things from the place where prayers are usually cast aloft: a church. A church-ready organ underpins most of the songs on <em>From the Valley to the Stars</em>, and combined with mantra-like lyrics and choir-like harmonies, particularly on ""Happiness Won Me Over"", for a set of modern love songs. Strings, horns, some subdued drums, and a few times some jingling piano also round out the arrangements, and sly references to pop history (the jaunty ""Somebody's Baby"" finds joy where Jackson Browne found jealousy) still recur, but this time the effect isn't cinematic so much as ecclesiastical.</p><p>
    Humble religiosity and downcast optimism resonate throughout the album, offering both love and music as redemption. Still, as on El Perro del Mar's previous outing, Assbring is at her best when her heart-wrenching songs can stand (or at least kneel) on their own. ""Glory to the World"" has the most in common with the smiling-through-tears pop that made the last record so endearing; Assbring's layered vocals bring us flowers and ambiguous glory as shrill woodwinds chirp over a descending organ progression. Slow, restrained first single ""How Did We Forget"" returns to the prior record's doo-wop feel. Despite the understated loveliness of Assbring's ""baby, baby""s, the track is an oddity on <em>From the Valley to the Stars</em>-- a song with lyrics as heartbroken as the music. Elsewhere,""You Can't Steal a Gift"" joins ""Somebody's Baby"" as a piano-based, (relatively) upbeat song giving a glimmer of hope that still sounds barely out of reach throughout most of the album. ""You just can't hide away,"" Assbring repeats, joined again by woodwinds and horns over organ triplets and walking piano bass notes.
    </p><p>
    Repetition was a big part of <em>El Perro del Mar</em>, but on the new album, it's carried out to new lengths, not always rewardingly. Opener ""Do Not Despair"" finds reassurance in the stars, and its organ-- together with its subtle, optimistic wordplay, ""Today's gone to bed and tomorrow's unmade""-- gives the song a psalm-like resonance. ""To Give Love"" tries to extract maximal meaning out of its title's three words, straining against the bounds of language like classic Van Morrison: ""There's still time/ To give love, to give love, to give love, to give love, to give love."" But the wandering bells and synths of the title track and the wedding-recessional organ peals of ""Jubilee"" anchor songs slight enough to float away, while ""Inner Island"" admonishes us to hold onto the place inside where we'd escape as kids-- for four minutes. Instrumental ""Inside the Golden Egg"" and one-sentence ""The Sun Is an Old Friend"" come off as little more than fragments. 
    </p>
<p>
    If Taken By Trees' debut did spare yet Spector-informed depressive pop better than <em>From the Valley to the Stars</em>, then fellow Swedes Club 8's ""Jesus Walk With Me"" more effectively found religion. Relying on acoustic guitar arpeggios and plainspoken, communicative lyrics rather than vague repetitions, the song from last year's <em>The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming</em> found parallels between faith in God and faith in a lover, as Assbring's latest also does, and hit upon something poignant. <em>From the Valley to the Stars</em> has hills that rise close to <em>El Perro del Mar</em>'s peaks, and its cohesive vision is a pleasure to behold. At the same time, though, it harps on its themes with an overzealous single-mindedness, occasionally letting flimsy stuff support an overarching conceit that requires foundations of marble. Or at least a really big old Italian ceiling and a whole lot of paint.

    Scenes often imply a style, but for the most visible exports of Toronto's post-millennial indie-rock scene-- Broken Social Scene, the Constantines, the Hidden Cameras-- the unifying principle has been not so much a common musical aesthetic as a communal ethic: the compulsion to crowd the stage with players and audience members alike, turning observers into participants and vice versa. Arriving in Toronto three years ago from the nearby town of Midland, on paper Born Ruffians seemed antithetical to the prevailing group-hug atmosphere: they boast no auxiliary horn or string sections, no spotlight-stealing guest female singers, no balaclava-clad dancers-- just three unassuming kids in standard guitar/bass/drums formation. But Born Ruffians haven't let their personnel deficiencies and basic instrumentation stop them from thinking and functioning like a mass collective-- they simply hoot and holler and make a spectacle of themselves (a cappella group-huddle sing-alongs, anyone?) like a band three times their size.</p><p>
    Born Ruffians' 2006 debut EP packed this restless vigor into six compact but complicated songs: wiry frontman Luke LaLonde shrieked about getting laid and getting paid, while bassist Mitch DeRosier and drummer Steve Hamelin seemed to be reacting not to the singer's melodic cues, but the convulsions in his puberty-freaked voice. So compared to this petulant precedent, the opening title track to the band's first full length, <em>Red Yellow Blue</em>, goes down like a horse tranquilizer: amid a rippling, hypnotic guitarpeggio, the sound of distant whistles and an eerily expansive sense of space, LaLonde's voice assumes a Panda Bear-like levity, as he sings of a fantasy to start his own country and choose the colors for its flag: ""Such a myriad to choose from/ I pick red, yellow, and blue."" Of course, he would go with primary colors-- for all their spastic outbursts and time-signature trickery, at the heart of every Born Ruffians song is a plea for simplicity.</p><p>
    That a band as tightly wound as Born Ruffians would eventually loosen the noose is not surprising; perhaps all those unwanted copies of <em>Some Loud Thunder</em> sitting in record stores served as a sobering reminder of what happens when a nervy indie-rock band sticks too close to type. But <em>Red Yellow Blue</em> plays out not as some premeditated step toward maturity-- following that opening reverie, the giddy one-two punch of ""Barnacle Goose"" and ""Hummingbird"" reassert equal proportions of the herky and the jerky-- rather, it explores different shades of the young-man's blues. Almost every song here sounds like a defense of some innocent ideal-- cooking dinner for ""ma and pa and grand mama"" (""Hedonistic Me""), a promise of unconditional love even ""when the money's gone"" (the Built to Spillerific stomper ""Badonka Donkey"")-- which, of course, makes LaLonde something of a modern-day outlaw. Hamelin and DeRosier's cheeky back-up harmonies reinforce the image of a 1950s doo-wop gang, summoned by LaLonde as if they were his own personal Sha Na Na.
    </p>
<p>
    But for all their childlike abandon, Born Ruffians are still too twitchy to ever come off as twee. For a three piece, they're like an anti-power-trio: LaLonde's tinny guitar tone is as thin as his frame, and Hamelin seems more intent on hitting the rims than the skins. But the threadbare presentation means the band never lets itself get too comfortable, instead introducing novel mid-song change-ups to elevate a track (the winsome two-part campfire serenade ""Little Garcon, Little Fille""), or in some cases, salvage them (""In a Mirror"", which, just as its circular melody crosses the line from insidious to annoying, kicks into a rousing victory-lap send-off). Or sometimes, it's just an easy but effective ploy to heighten the drama, like the middle break in ""Kurt Vonnegut"" that halts the song's drum-rolled momentum but sets up its heart-rending climax, where the Ruffians gradually lay off their instruments and, in three-part harmony, coax a girl to her bedroom window like a multi-headed Lloyd Dobler.
    </p>
<p>
    After this grand finale, it's surprising that Born Ruffians have anything left for closer ""Red Elephant"", and as such, the song feels like an unnecessary addendum, its repeating pattern of dirgey verses and sped-up choruses constituting one of the few instances here where the songwriting feels routine. But even if <em>Red Yellow Blue</em> overstays its welcome for one song, it still counts as one of this new year's most engaging and endearing indie-rock debuts. Which may echo the sentiments attributed to another debut album on this site recently, but then Born Ruffians are the Vampire Weekend you don't have to fret over-- all the witty wordplay and jingle-jangle joy, none of the nagging questions about Afro-pop appropriation and Ivy League privilege.

I've never been able to
    enumerate a list of things I like or don't like in music, and I don't always
    necessarily know why I like something-- it just flips that switch we all have inside
    of us. Ultimately, I don't think it's important to
    know why we like the music we do, because the act of liking it is
    self-justifying. I'm saying all this in part because I couldn't immediately
    think of a way to describe what's so great about Kutiman. I know one thing,
    though: I like this.</p><p>
    Ophir Kutiel (the Kutiman moniker stems from his family
    name, but could as easily be read as admiration for Nigerian Afrobeat icon Fela
    Kuti) is a solo act from Tel Aviv, Israel, a one-man band who occasionally
    brings in his friends when he thinks they can improve the sound or he needs
    some horns (he needs them often). His music is something like Israel itself,
    a mishmash of things from all over the world, the old and the new side by side,
    a melting pot with a common overarching identity. He's schooled in the funk and
    fusion of the 1970s, Afrorock and Afrobeat, heavy psych from the 60s, hip-hop and
    modern R&amp;B, a bit of reggae and dub, a couple decades of electronic music,
    and the general art of the groove.</p><p>
    This comes together in a fantastic, head-spinning debut
    album, a psyched-up groove monster that can't decide between vintage and modern
    and instead just has it both ways. It works in the same way a lot of releases
    on the Ubiquity label, like Shawn Lee's Ping Pong Orchestra or Will Holland's
    Quantic, work, by finding that switch that makes you forget about the why and
    just enjoy the what. It opens with a light appetizer in instrumental ""Bango
    Fields"", a basic funk track topped with a squiggle of ring-modulated analog
    synth that suggests Kutiel might be able to make a pretty good living as a hip-hop producer, but that barely prepares the listener for the album as a whole.
    </p><p>
    ""No Reason For You"", one of several tracks that features
    vocals by Elran Dekel, follows with a crushing Led Zeppelin beat, heavy Fela horn
    section, huge, sweeping chorus, and a towering, psychedelic hook that sounds
    like a cross between a choir and a string section but actually probably comes
    from a synthesizer. The synthesizer on ""Once You're Near Me"" is more playful,
    sort of an electro-exotica hook for Dekel to play off. He's a pretty
    versatile singer, giving a pointed, almost ominous performance on ""No Reason"",
    while his contribution to ""Once You're Near Me"" sounds like a lounge signer
    sucked into an
    echo chamber. 
    </p>
<p>
    Kutiel's other principle vocal collaborator, Karolina, has a
    voice sort of like a melting trumpet-- you can tell she's listened to a least a
    few Billie Holiday records. She sounds especially great on the jazz-inflected
    ""Trumpet Woman"", wherein she imitates the titular instrument to great effect
    over a miles-thick bass line and chilled-out drumbeat. She gets a little more
    down and dirty on the spectacular funk workout ""Music Is Ruling My World"",
    given a kickass drum break and a big horn section to duke it out with. Even
    when the album moves away from funk workouts, it remains engrossing. ""I Just
    Wanna Make Love to You"" provides a chilly interlude at the album's midpoint,
    with muted trumpet and saxophone wandering through an R&amp;B fog driven by a
    downtempo funk beat. The closest thing I can think to compare it to is DJ
    Shadow's ""What Does Your Soul Look Like? (part 1)."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Somewhere in all that, there are a whole lot of reasons to
    like this record. It's an album that feels right all over the place-- in the car,
    at home late at night, on a large soundsystem at a party...Kutiman takes all his
    influences, gives them a swirl and emerges with a great debut that hits that
    elusive switch over and over.

I mean, have you ever tried talking to a Dropkick Murphys fan? All the regular punk shit-- youthful rage, middle-fingers-to-the-man, no perspective-- all that plus regional pride. It's intimidating. Consider, then, the Pine Hill Haints: On the scale of unreasonable bands and fanbases, defiantly Alabamian punk/rockabilly troupe who used to practice in a graveyard should rank really, really high.</p><p>
    Strange, then, just how patient and precise the quintet's third full-length and first for K Records, <em>Ghost Dance</em>, sounds.  In the midst of what should be a near-insufferable territorial pissing contest, the Haints have stumbled on a winning formula: choppy, rhythm-centric odes to Buddy Holly and Carl Perkins-- mostly about girls, but often about ghosts, too.  This, to be fair, is how the Haints have always operated, but <em>Ghost Dance</em> distinguishes itself with deft arrangements and an old-hound's sense of restraint.  Frontman Jamie Barrier has plenty of fire but tired bones; he dutifully carries out those ""whoa-oh-oh""'s by himself, like this rallying cry shit is sort of silly but has nonetheless got to get done.</p><p>
    The world is changed when a band signs to K and gets <em>less</em> lo-fi, but no doubt some of the credit lies with label-guru Calvin Johnson who produced more than half of <em>Ghost Dance</em>'s 20 tracks.  Barrier's pattering guitar is allowed plenty of acreage to pound out slyly danceable rhythms.  Drummer Ben Rhyne breaks his martial snare into fractal riffs.  Occasional swaths of accordion, mandolin, fiddle carry traces of bluegrass and Celtic music.  Sometimes things are wacky: Rhyne is credited with playing a ""snake rattle"", Matt Bakula with washtub bass.  Tracks like ""Death by Stereo"" and ""For Every Glass That's Empty"" don't offer a lot of low-end but their hollowed-out take on sock-hop rock shake with teenage familiarity.  Several public domain covers-- ""You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond"", ""St. James Infirmary Blues"", and ""Columbus Stockade Blues"", among others-- don't differ substantially in style or sound but suggest the Haints are paying proper attention to their roots.  </p><p>
    All of this attention to history and form give more than adequate weight to Barrier's love-slush nonsense.  During ""I Never Thought the Day Would Come"" the drums drops out in one of those romantic punk moments: ""To the people in the city/ Where you would disappear/ I follow you in the dark light of every street my dear"".  Elsewhere he smokily urges, ""Shine on/ Catfish angels"", whatever the hell that means, likely something about a girl.  Or a ghost.  Mostly, though, clichés abound, and they are welcome clichés.  Refreshingly restrained, pleasingly punk, <em>Ghost Dance</em> goes to great lengths not to overextend itself; what might've been a tireless four-on-the-floor is instead a boxful of tender, shaky paeans.<br/></p></div>"|11169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11169-ghost-dance/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

    Each of Sia Furler's albums has been released on a different label, but it should come as no surprise that her fourth, and most promising, comes on Starbucks' label Hear Music. (It also should be no surprise that Hear Music has helped make this her most commercially successful record.) The Adelaide-born English crossover, who has worked with Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, and Zero 7, has been a likeable, clean-voiced accessory for years, but she got her first (independent) big break when ""Breathe Me"", off 2004's <em>Color the Small One</em>, was featured in the final episode of <em>Six Feet Under</em> and caused a minor that. <em>Some People Have Real Problems</em> tries to be something else: brazen yet fun, sophisticated yet goofy. Composed in large part by Sia in conjunction with her supporting instrumentalists, the songs are full of bounce, springtime, and California cool. And Beck is featured on two tracks, ""Academia"" and ""Death By Chocolate"". But it doesn't help.</p><p>
    From the start, <em>Problems</em> nods to both Sia's résumé and to her neighbors on the latté bar: Feist's playful, smokey ballads and Zero 7's drum-and-bass slugs. ""Little Black Sandals"" screams failure just by mentioning a pair of shoes in its title (see: Katherine McPhee) and the R&amp;B reaches are dreadful. ""Lentil"" is brave and explorative by rhythm and melody, inserting a pinch of Regina Spektor-via-Tori Amos into the mix. Still, the chorus is too bland and the rhythm too slow. This andante dullness is prevalent on the album, as if Norah Jones were going about stealing Feist's audience.</p><p>
    has potential, but where this song could actually use the heat and the punch of percussion, there is none. ""The Girl You Lost to Cocaine"" is stellar, but like Esthero before her, Sia so often concedes to choruses that are rote and thin on the ground, packed full of airy, electrified harmonies. I want soars, climbs, and surprising bridges; instead there are puffed up harmonies and a tad of decoration from the brass and keys. The anticipation of the chorus is enough to play the song on repeat for a couple of days, but the chorus is still there, irritatingly memorable, and, in fact, it seeps into every part of the song, dominating the subtle inventions of melody and Sia's clear talent for deft hops around the scale. ""Electric Bird"" is a winner, though it, too, has stock elements in its alternatively languorous and rushed lyrics, pumps from the brass, and tricky shifts into minor key. ""Playground""'s all click-clacking and hand-clapping and more overused vocal multi-tracking. I'd venture to say Sia has not penned a single song without this feature.
    </p>
<p>
    The perfect balance-- and the potential that few of the tracks reach-- is uncovered on ""Soon We'll Be Found"", which is sexy and balladic, yet dark and raging. It's surprising, colorful, and complex. But there are too many attempts at this type of song, and not enough of the springtime fun suggested on the ridiculous cover. If Sia spent more time at the piano, and/or hired Robyn to write her a couple of tracks, the results could be marvelous. But as it stands, Sia is not aware of her potential-- or rather, her options.

    Baltimore is as musically diverse as anywhere else, but in 2008,
    indie
    rockers associate the city with colorful, energetic music, from the
    expatriated Animal Collective to Dan Deacon's Wham City crew. The music
    of Beach House, the Baltimore-based duo of multi-instrumentalist Alex
    Scally and vocalist/organist Victoria Legrand, is a shadow narrative
    running parallel to this trend: Their delicate, lovelorn pop comes in
    the form of deathly waltzes and dark pastoral dirges on which Legrand
    sings about desire, loss, and dreams as if telling a ghost story,
    splitting the difference between lovely and creepy.</p><p>
    For
    pristine pop, Beach House's self-titled 2006 debut was awfully raw:
    Legrand downplayed her classical piano and voice training in a humble
    negation of virtuosity. The organs sounded like something thick and
    coarse being pulled through a small, jagged opening; chord structures
    were simply suggestions; imperfections were kept intact. That balance
    of beauty and imprecision made inspired songs like ""Saltwater"", ""Tokyo
    Witch"", ""Apple Orchard"", and ""Master of None"" easy to fall in love
    with.</p><p>
    The duo's songwriting hasn't fundamentally changed on <em>Devotion</em>;
    they've simply cleaned up their act. These are crisper, brighter,
    bolder songs, retaining Beach House's sense of elegant decay while
    sweeping up the debris. ""Gila"" is a funeral on a sunny day; its
    shimmering organs are controlled, never bleeding chaotically as they
    did on the debut, and are complemented by frilly but steadfast guitar.
    ""Turtle Island"" reaffirms Beach House's preference for simple, skeletal
    percussion, but its dense melody is a marked advancement. The result of
    this pre-spring cleaning is that <em>Devotion</em> lacks some of the
    immediate highs of the first album-- you no longer get the sense of
    rooting for an embattled underdog-- but winds up consistently stronger.
    </p>
<p>
    Even though it's tidier and more streamlined, the music surrenders none of its autumnal charm, and there's still a sense of eavesdropping on a private, ongoing dialogue between Legrand and a ghost. Of course, we only get to hear her side of the story. As on the first album, which began with the words ""Love you all the time, even though you're not mine,"" she favors second-person assertions that speak of self-effacement, dependence, and sinister dream-world conversations. ""Your wish is my command,"" she intones on ""Wedding Bell"", becoming a genie in a puff of smoke. And on ""Gila"", she sings in a world-weary wheeze, ""Man, you've got a lot of jokes to tell."" But instead of the punch line, we get the sort of jarring shift that characterizes dreams: ""So you throw your baby's banners down the well.""
    </p>
<p>
    ""Invite your sister into the garden,"" she drones on the wind-up waltz ""You Came to Me"", concurrently inviting us into the murky depths of her romantic consciousness. There's a sense of latent danger in the invitation, like a siren song luring us toward sharp clusters of rock. Portals into mysterious spaces pockmark <em>Devotion</em>; none of them promise a way out. Perhaps this explains why an album that takes its title and concept from a superficially sweet concept has such a subtle bite: Legrand's devotion is a dungeon into which she tosses her own desires like coins into a wishing well, a one-way conduit from which only echoes return.

    Even on a label dominated by techno-pop fetishists, gushy romantics, and campy sentimentalists, it doesn't take a giant leap of imagination to picture Justus Köhncke as Kompakt's resident odd man out. A meandering blend of naval-gazing techno, burlesque pop, and German-accented disco, his 2002 debut <em>Was Ist Musik</em> was a sometimes difficult record that felt like a private, closed-door articulation of the same sensibility his labelmates were dutifully trying to popularize at the time. Since then, Köhncke has gone on to enjoy his fair share of commercial high points as well (most notably with 2004's still pretty brilliant ""Timecode"", easily his defining single), but his seeming refusal to elaborate further on any of those singular moments paints a picture of an artist for whom success is more often than not accidental.</p><p>
    While <em>Safe &amp; Sound</em> marks Köhncke's first full-length since 2005's <em>Doppelleben</em>, there's nothing celebratory or assertive about his return. If anything, <em>S&amp;S</em> is a bloody-mindedly unassuming record; it's almost as if Köhncke made a conscious decision to fly low. With the exception of the spangly ""Parage"", one of the album's pastichey highlights, and the shimmering ""Molybdan"", Köhncke's trance-inflected revisiting of ""Timecode""'s tick-tocking rhythms, everything on <em>Safe &amp; Sound</em> lingers shyly in the mid-tempo range, much of it threatening to lift off but never leaving the ground.</p><p>
    Those without much patience for Köhncke's hit-and-miss predilection for kitsch German-sung pop will be pleased to know that, having recently completed a string of Iggy Pop and Velvet Underground covers under the pseudonym Kinky Justice, he's completely done away with the on-album vocal sidebars. In their absence, though, his productions seem to have taken a more conversational tone. Gone is the sleek, streamlined retro disco that categorized a lot of <em>Doppelleben</em>; the pulse on <em>Safe &amp; Sound</em> is much more finely rendered, its level of detail and gristle implying a sturdy reverence for early 1990s techno. In fact, from the skittering patterns and analog synth washes of opener ""Yacht"" (which rests on a tantalizing sliver of Grace Jones' ""Slave To The Rhythm"") to the chattering, almost industrial rhythms of the dark and metallic ""$26"" to the lumbering album closer and title track, <em>Safe &amp; Sound</em>'s most recurring touchpoint is probably early IDM.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, this being Köhncke, the quiet skill and confidence with which it's all assembled is hard to deny. Even more so than with his previous outings, there's a subtle craft and a generosity of at the heart of <em>Safe &amp; Sound</em> that emerges with repeated listens. As evidenced by the album's centerpiece, a buzzing cover of Michael Rother's (Kraftwerk, Neu!, Harmonia) ""Feuerland"", this is very much a producer's record. With its refined palette of sounds, sonic textures, and subtle melodic hooks, it's an easy enough record to like. Nonetheless, those who were hoping for an album full of the slow-burning disco that Köhncke has proven such a skill for in the past might come away feeling a little underwhelmed. But I suppose that's part of the deal with any Köhncke record; the man has such a wide array of tastes and influences that some are always going to be left undeveloped.

    It took time for 2005's low-flying <em>The Complete Guide to Insufficiency</em> to penetrate even fringe-folk's radar. But many who now know it consider David Thomas Broughton's gutting first LP a minor masterpiece. Notorious for lines like, ""I wouldn't take her to execution/ I wouldn't take her to a live sex show/ I wouldn't piss or shit on her would I/ Because I love her so,"" the album paces the vague, uneasy borderlands between horror and comedy, danger and play, reality and performance. Just as arresting as his narratives of murder, dismemberment, rape, suicide, and other themes more typical to Norwegian death metal bands than polite singer-songwriters are Broughton's thick and knotty ropes of sound-- his quavering wounded-beast baritone woven with guitar and ambient noise loops.</p><p>
<em>David Thomas Broughton vs. 7 Hertz</em> is the London-based musician's first major, or majorish (even though it exceeds an hour, Spanish label Acuarela is marketing it as a mini-album), release of new material since then. Like <em>Complete Guide</em>, <em>vs. 7 Hertz</em> memorializes in five tracks a largely improvised live performance, with minimal post-production mop-up. Supported-- perhaps I should say goaded-- by Leeds chamber quintet 7 Hertz, Broughton notches up the noise and maximizes the meander. So this probably won't be the record that wins the unconverted. Still, there's plenty here for Broughton faithful. ""Weight of My Love"", with its desperation, plain-cloth melody, and archaic syntax (""I dig you a grave for to sleep, my love""), draws on ancient murder balladry while voicing the sharp and specific woes-- too skint to afford a pasty from the corner shop or transport to Leeds-- of contemporary Britain's margin-dwellers. ""River Outlet"" is a mesmerizing 22-minute meditation on memory and loss, and ""Fisted Hand"" is disconcertingly lovely as it swathes violence in tender string-plucks and lilting melody.</p><p>
    Despite its pugilistic title, any implied opposition between the folkie and classically schooled combo proves a feint. Broughton's amalgam of Northern soul, Faheyesque blues, pastoral folk, and machine manipulation pairs surprisingly well with 7 Hertz's classical-jazz-experimental palette, and the ad-hoc band seems unanimously committed to the aesthetics of chance and privileging of process over product. Compositional free-form occasionally, as in ""No Great Shakes"", finds Broughton awkwardly bumping elbows with 7 Hertz. And ""Hands""'s spitting amp is more annoying than conceptually provocative. But the spontaneous arrangements usually work. Rusty violins saw and a double bass pecks at ""Weight""'s simple reiterated chord progression, building to a combustible convergence of scribbled strings and lowing clarinet. ""River""'s sampled fret squeaks chirp like sonar signals and loop, unnervingly, like hungry sharks, so when the track finally erupts into a hysteria of noise, it's the only satisfying resolution.
    </p>
<p>
    At just over a minute, ""Jolly (Interlude)"" seems like a spell-breaking joke, a crude rebuttal to anyone who'd assert that the guy never lightens up. But it's actually integral to <em>vs. 7 Hertz</em> and any complex understanding of Broughton-- whose maudlin vibrato always holds a hint of perverse humor and whose stage manner reportedly swerves from downcast to slapstick. ""Jolly"" signals, if it weren't already apparent, that Broughton isn't going to provide emotional shortcuts for his audience.

    Ever since people began to appreciate the world around
    them, storytellers have represented the natural world through the ""mother"" metaphor.<span> </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Glory Hope Mountain</span><span>, the title of the debut LP from Ottawa's the
    Acorn, is a loose translation of Gloria Esperanza Montoya, the given name of
    group-leader Rolf Klausener's mother. In a touching, symbolic
    representation of her life as told to her son, these songs are Klausener's own reinscription of his mother's life story onto the landscape that helped shape
    it.</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> Mountain</span><span>'s lyrics are rife with anthropomorphic surroundings-- ""mounatins like diaphragms,"" ""scenery painted by brushes of hair,""
    ""a landscape that is breathing,"" ""the heavy clouds that crowd your head""-- and
    maps made of stars and rivers, binding the journey it chronicles with the earth
    that facilitates it.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mountain</span><span>
    came together in a manner similar to the Fiery Furnaces' own oral-history
    project with their grandmother, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Rehearsing My Choir</span><span>: Klausener recorded a series of lengthy
    conversations with his mother-- about </span><span>her childhood </span><span>escape from a troubled, abusive environment in Honduras, and journey
    north to Canada, where she re-settled, married, and had a son</span><span>-- and </span><span>set them to music.<span> </span>Where </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mountain</span><span>
    parts formally from </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Choir</span><span>,
    however, is in the details-- or more specifically, the lack thereof.  The album is dedicated, through a small mention in the lower right corner of the liner notes, to Montoya, but the only time we hear her actual voice is on
    ""Sister Margaret"", as it bookends a wistful piano and lapsteel instrumental.<span> </span></span><span>Specific references are dotted throughout, but <em>Mountain </em>is no biography.  </span><span>Instead, Klausener crafts from her
    stories an allegorical narrative of strength, perserverence, love, and redemption.    </span><span></span><span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The record has some ethnomusicological underpinnings: While writing it, Klausener researched Honduran indigenous music, which has connections to
    the West African roots of many of its practicioners, but stopped short of
    replicating it outright, preferring to learn from its rhythmic pecularities and
    translate them to his own folk-collective worldview. ""Crooked Legs"" is easily
    the best example of the band's strengths; a melodic hodgepodge of brass, rumbling
    drums, intricately plucked guitars, and Klausener's plangent vocal melody do
    more than their parts to propel a charming, inspirational lyric.<span> </span>Elsewhere, the group (five core members
    and a dozen or so hired hands) avoids generic world-music traps,
    using dynamic shifts and evocative instrumentation to forward the narrative:
    ""Hold Your Breath"", for instance, opens the record-as-journey by replicating the quiet of a
    nighttime escape before expanding into a jammy coda of sun-soaked
    freedom and the wonder of the natural world, seguing into the tribal percussion
    and chanting of the dramatic ""Flood Pt. 1"".<span></span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Maybe appropriately for an album devoted to finding one's
    way through unknown territories, there are times when Klausener's muse
    wanders.<span> </span>His drive to globalize
    musically pays off more often than not, but in terms of sentiment, he
    occasionally catches himself in thickets.<span>
</span>Declarations like ""my blood runs through your heart with every beat,""
    which echo throughout, are touching if not a touch hokey and simple, while a
    line like ""whitewashing avenues of our widening disparities"" veers off too far
    in the other direction, trying for highminded poetry but landing in the purgatory
    of the too-wordy.  A concentration on the intricacies of Klausener's own verbiage raises a final, fleeting, and speculative question, however: How much is lost when Montoya's story is shook down to a series of pretty, impressionistic renderings?  It's nice to approach <em>Mountain </em>in the manner of any sentimental gift from a son to his mother, but in terms of its circulation outside the two of them might we be equally enlightened by, say, her actual words?  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    That first
    lyric, though, functions as <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Mountain</span><span>'s
    solemn conclusion, to the song ""Lullabye (Mountain)"", which affirms Klausener's
    own recognition of the inevitable course that life takes.<span> </span>Regardless of what happens between
    birth and death, all stories must eventually conclude, and those endings so
    often mirror the beginnings.<span> </span></span>

He could probably live the rest of his life off the radio residuals from ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" alone, he already made the indie kids dance over 20 years ago with Big Audio Dynamite, and his suitably gritty production work on the Libertines' two albums should've satisfied any lingering, late-career urges to score cred points with the skinny-jeaned set. So it's encouraging to see the enthusiasm with which he's hurtled himself into his latest project, Carbon/Silicon, a prolific collaboration with Generation X's Tony James that's rooted in DIY principles both traditional (booking weekly residences at London pubs) and modern (releasing a steady stream of albums and EPs through free downloads on their website). With the two principals evenly sharing the songwriting and vocal duties, Carbon/Silicon resemble a sort of pared-down Travelling Wilburys for the class-of-77 set: A good-natured get-together of old mates who seem happy to play purely for the pleasure of one another's company.</p><p>
    Which isn't to suggest the two are eager to shut out the world around them. Their chosen Carbon/Silicon moniker can be interpreted as a response to a world overrun with pollution and plastic, and <em>The Last Post</em>-- comprised mostly of re-recordings from the band's web-only releases-- touches on all the Big Issues (the Iraq war, terrorism, materialism) with news-ticker efficiency and expediency. But the overall attitude of the album is not one of anger so much as shrugged-shoulder bemusement, perhaps resulting from the fact that the modern world looks no more sane or dignified than the garbage-strewn London streets that spawned Jones and James' former bands. You can hear their sardonic detachment simmering underneath the up-with-people exuberance of opener ""The News"", in which Jones fires off a laundry list of utopian ideals-- ""people started caring about what they eat/ and people started smiling at everyone they meet""-- while the song's ringing, repetitive guitar riff and sprightly rhythm coat the lyrics in a synthetic sheen that underscores their inherent, pipe-dream fallacy.</p><p>
    But this surface simplicity exposes both Carbon/Silicon's charms and their limitations. The band may have evolved from a two-man team to a full four-piece band, but the recordings still possess a demo-like quality-- not in the raw, primal sense, but rather what sounds like home-computer-generated blueprints begging for embellishments that never come. The grinding riffs and metronomic drum tracks pretty much map out entire song structures within the first 10 seconds, with verses and choruses often following the same melody line (see: the ersatz Oasis of ""Tell it Like It Is""). The result is a sometimes awkward disconnect between intent and execution: with its descending central riff, agit-folk sloganeering (""what they're trying to sell us is really just a con"") and immediate, anthemic chorus, you can't help but wonder how exciting centerpiece track ""War on Culture"" would've sounded had Jones or James recorded it 30 years ago; instead, it exists today as an amiable mid-tempo chugger that cruises along for six minutes without ever really accruing any of the fury seeping out of the lyric sheet.</p><p>
    So with the parameters so rigidly defined, success boils down to the spirit of the performances: James' ""Magic Suitcase"" recasts its disarming images of airport security and concealed bombs into an enchanting bit of Robyn Hitchcockian psych-pop whimsy, while the fetching ""National Anthem"" sublimates T. Rex's ""Bang a Gong"" groove into a sly, soul strut. But within <em>The Last Post</em>'s stately surroundings, it follows that the most invigorating song is also its silliest: a ""Clash City Rockers"" redux called ""What the Fuck"". Jones may be stretching things a touch when he links the title's punk-perfect sentiment with the existential angst of Fyodor Dostoevsky, but the song marks the rare moment where Carbon/Silicon sound like a product of ""Garageland"" rather than GarageBand.</p></div>"|11164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11164-the-last-post/|5.7|Stuart Berman

    One thing writers often don't give musicians enough credit for is the rationale for their restlessness. If a well-known pop artist alters their style-- especially if it deviates from a sound that made them a commercial success-- there's often this urge to label the musician as bored and impulsive, chasing new trends or jumping off bandwagons as if holding off stagnancy is their only motivation to test their creativity. It can be upsetting to longtime fans, but often times the only real hurdle to these new directions is unfamiliarity-- just look at Goldfrapp, who startled their earliest fans by shifting from the surrealistic elegance of their 2000 orchestral-pop debut <em>Felt Mountain</em> to a beat-heavy mid-decade run at the dance charts. With two hard-to-top electro-pop albums under their belts-- 2003's <em>Black Cherry</em> and 2005's <em>Supernature</em>-- it's safe to assume that Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory are perfectly happy with getting some closure on what they've accomplished in the last few years and are moving on to something else out of a feeling more substantial than impatience. It was unprecedented enough that a group which started out trafficking in cabaret eeriness and cinematic grandiosity would ease so naturally into club-pop, so it's not out of the question that dialing back to pastoral, folksy indie-electronica would unearth another side of a duo that was shaping up to be one of the decade's most versatile.</p><p>
    So how could a group that's already established success with slow, lush ballads-- think 2000's ""Pilots"", 2003's ""Forever"", or 2005's ""You Never Know""-- release an album filled with a whole bunch of uncompelling attempts at them? It could be because Goldfrapp's best songs, regardless of how downbeat they were, at least had something to grab the ear melodically, where most of the material on <em>Seventh Tree</em> focuses more on subtle, slow-moving ambience. This ambience is often so subtle and slow-moving it doesn't seem to go anywhere, and it coasts on some frothy sense of pleasantness that evaporates the moment the song ends. Like the bulk of the album, there's a certain beauty in opener ""Clowns"", but it's an empty one-- more lullaby than pop song, it's symptomatic of what happens when you take all the grandeur out of big sweeping melodies.</p><p>
    Other songs attempt to use these flimsy backdrops to build up to big, epic crescendos-- the Nick Mason drums cutting into the narcoleptic Air-circa-<em>Virgin Suicides</em> swoon in ""Little Bird""; the latter-day Moby bombast that rears its head in the second half of ""A&amp;E""'s Sarah McLachlan-isms-- and it feels false and gratuitous, as if it were the only way to maintain any actual momentum. At its best-- the desolation of ""Cologne Cerrone Houdini"" and ""Some People"", which inject the ambience with a much-needed eeriness-- this stuff's fairly soothing; at its worst it evokes that old ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" bit about the two-note chords of New Age music: ""Put your finger down here...now put another finger down...now hold it down for an hour...now hold it down 'til you get a record contract from Windham Hill."" At least ""Caravan Girl"" provides a nice, upbeat Neu!-meets-ABBA distraction, but it's too little too late.</p><p>
    All of Gregory's codeine melodies would be a lot more salvageable, however, if Alison undercut it with the trademark strengths of her voice. It's what made the Marlene Dietrich mood of <em>Felt Mountain</em> so intriguingly weird, while <em>Black Cherry</em> and <em>Supernature</em> would have simply been slightly-above-par electro-glam ephemera without her Kylie-gone-sinister purr. But she's not assertive or seductive or mysterious here; what she's offering is the kind of mannered, chirpy delicacy you could get from any number of indie-folk and adult contemporary artists piped through off-brand coffeehouses everywhere. There's still some interesting dissonance in hearing this fragile version of Goldfrapp's voice wrap around lyrics that occasionally match the ominous nature of her older songs; ""A&amp;E"", shallow as it sounds, hints at a pill overdose.
    </p>
<p>
    But with all the excitement and decadence drained out of the music and the voice, the trite themes stand out a bit more clearly: you can be happy if you give money to people who promise to make your life better (""Happiness""); birds have wings and are free (""Little Bird""). That's assuming you can understand Goldfrapp's lyrics in the first place, since she mumbles incoherently and is muffled under a swampy mix through half the record, which only highlights the feeling of sleepy halfheartedness. Even if <em>Seventh Tree</em> is sonic dishwater, I'll give Goldfrapp enough credit to assume that this isn't change for its own sake, that the motivation for this album's tone wasn't simply a fatigued boredom with their old sound. It's just too bad most listeners won't be able to say the same about their own reactions to this new one.

So it makes sense that Vernhes chose to inaugurate his new label with a compilation of groups recorded in his Brooklyn lair. The surprise with <em>Living Bridge</em> is how cohesive and consistent it is. Whether it's Vernhes' production, the groups' stylistic overlaps, or simply the high quality of the music, something makes this 25-track, 2xCD collection sound more like an album than any compilation should rightly be expected to.</p><p>
    Vernhes creates <em>Living Bridge</em>'s flow by mixing the songs roughly like a DJ (as he told Pitchfork in January, he ""made sure to record extended intros and outros so the songs merge together into one long, but indexed, piece of music""). But that approach would be just a gimmick were the songs not so congruous, so alike in tone and mood. It might be hard to imagine Black Dice and Tara Jane O'Neil sounding similar, and no one will mistake the former's throbbing bleeps for the latter's soft musings. But both of their contributions possess a subtlety and restraint that runs throughout the majority of <em>Living Bridge</em>.</p><p>
    That common feel is strongest on disc one, which progresses almost seamlessly. The loping hum of Telepathe's ""I Cant' Stand It"" climbs to a shoegaze pitch, which melts nicely into Palms' minimal trance ""Der Koening"". Later, Blood on the Wall adorn a simple bass line with the haunting chill of <em>EVOL</em>-era Sonic Youth, a vibe that perks up in Silver Jews' aching melodies, then rises into Charles Gansa's piano-driven croon. The peak of all this building intoxication is Samara Lubelski's ""Ego Blossoms"". Diverging from the version found on her recent <em>Parallel Suns</em> album, it forgoes percussion for layers of mesmerizing keyboards.</p><p>
    Disc two continues that aura, opening with the a cappella freeze of Theo Angell, the clipped hooks of Rings, and the airy pop of Deerhunter. But the remainder doesn't catch quite the atmosphere of disc one. The moods are less consistent, and Vernhes' transitions aren't as effective. But the music is still pretty good, from Enon's pulsing new wave to John Wolfington's majestic melody to Sam Jayne's Malkmus-like sway. Only after Jayne's cut does <em>Living Bridge</em> falter, finishing with generic punk, synth-pop, and painfully-bad soft-rock that would embarrass even Journey, by someone called the Jewish.</p><p>
    Still, on the whole, <em>Living Bridge</em> is so strong that it's tempting to draw overreaching conclusions-- that this represents the most interesting indie rock around, or that it proves that sonically less is more, or that it's a model for compilations that hope to be more than just a highlight reel. But like any good album, <em>Living Bridge</em> is valuable primarily as an aesthetic experience, its music a stronger statement than any thesis one might try to impose on it.</p></div>"|11194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11194-living-bridge/|7.9|Marc Masters

    Whether talking Jandek or Albert Ayler or La Monte Young, some musicians-- even if their work is inventive and perhaps revolutionary-- owe their reputations-at-large to public personality. Jandek, the recluse; Ayler, the firebrand; Young, the hoarder: These musicians have calling cards somewhat removed from their art. You don't have to know their music to know their personas.</p><p>
    If you've heard the name Steve Reid at all, his story is probably familiar: Berry Gordy paid him $75 in the early 1960s to play drums on Martha and the Vandellas' ""Dancing in the Street""; he gigged regularly at the Apollo; he drummed his way through college; he moved to Africa, working with Guy Warren and Fela Kuti; he was arrested for draft-dodging back in America; he recorded and toured with Sun Ra and Miles Davis; now 64, he's recorded four albums with Kieran ""Four Tet"" Hebden since 2005. What's more, the liner notes for both of Reid's albums with the Steve Reid Ensemble have included breathless writing by BBC Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson: 2005's <em>Spirit Walk</em> used a long-form interview with questions and answers about Africa, influences, and adolescence; this year's <em>Daxaar</em>-- captured last January during Reid's first trip back to Africa in four decades-- includes a Peterson essay that reads, ""For Steve Reid to return to the home of the drums... was a natural trip.... If the quest is to 'keep in the rhythm' then Steve Reid is The Man and <em>Daxaar</em> is the lick.""</p><p>
    Lucky for us, the music on <em>Daxaar</em>'s not bad, either: Recorded by a septet that recalls only Hebden and keyboardist/music director Boris Netsvetaev from the octet that made <em>Spirit Walk</em>, <em>Daxaar</em> uses Reid's tight, steady grooves like loam. The band's textural nuances and unorthodox solos spring above his traps, but they always trace back to the rhythms, acknowledging the fecundity of the soil beneath. The trumpet of Roger Ongolo and the guitar of Jimi Mbaye, for instance, weave through the hi-hat tap of ""Dabronxxar"", slipping into and stepping out of the rhythm, emphasizing its tiny waves. And on closer ""Don't Look Back"", everything funnels into the groove one layer at the time-- bass, electronics, drums, keys. Again, the guitar and trumpet lock around that meter, darting between its cracks. All five tracks operate under the same premise: Let the rhythm be the foundation, and surprises will surface. That principle has been evident in Reid's work since 1975's excellent <em>Rhythmatism</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    The outlier, though, is the disc's intro, performed solo by singer and kora player Isa Kouyate: Titled ""Welcome"", it's a prelude that functions like a string section opening a black metal album or a well-placed skit opening a hip-hop album: Except for fundamental ideas, it has little to do with the nearly familiar jazz that follows. It's only an invocation opening the curtains on the homecoming, the communion, the recontextualization. ""Welcome"" is such a successful gambit because, for the rest of the record, Reid and his four-sevenths-native band don't emphasize region or sentiment. Aside from an African-American émigré living in Switzerland returning to Africa with an English electronicist and a Russian keyboardist, there's no agenda in the music they're making. Instead, Reid coasts with his crash and ride, leaning forward against the beat on the title track, as Netsvetaev builds wide organ arches. Khadim Badji's hand drums complement Reid's stick-and-metal lead, and bassist Dembel Diop lopes around the basic rhythm, always pulling on it or pushing against it with a brilliant, buxom tone. Hebden sparkles with some of his best moments in his prolific if patchwork collaboration with Reid. His young mercury has hamstrung his duo records with Reid, although he's excellent at identifying interesting sounds and tinkering with them: Here, as he's often done as Four Tet and on last year's <em>Fire Escape</em> with Sunburned Hand of the Man, he's content to play that role. Hebden accents and warps but doesn't define.
    </p>
<p>
    No one else does, either: Taken as a whole, <em>Daxaar</em> is fun if somewhat static. <em>Spirit Walk</em> was an essential listen, its hymns to heroes and its huge, charging arrangements signaling Reid's renewal and new status with force. <em>Daxaar</em>, then, is the other side of the picture-- a lot more comfortable, a little more nuanced, a bit too stable. But, again, Steve Reid is 64, and this jazz is far outside of the supper club. And it gets by on more than its backstory.

    Whether it's the jaunty player piano that kicks things off, Matt Costa's
    over-syllabified singing of the title, or just due diligence on his bio,
    there's plenty of ways one can deduce that ""Mr. Pitiful"", the first
    single from <em>Unfamiliar Faces</em>, is not autobiographical. Indeed, it's a
    send-up of an upwardly mobile peer that implies that Costa's been listening to the National recently. But while the latter's ascendance has coincided with
    their increased willingness to empathize rather than accuse, as a kid from
    Huntington Beach barely in his mid-20s, Costa just kinda sounds like a dick--
    ""I hope you see through your big yard and white picket fence...don't make me
    feel bad that we're still friends.""</p><p>
    So if Costa makes it appear that home-ownership is the realm of true squares,
    it's easy to chalk it up as a collateral effect of trusting your major label
    debut to the hands of Jack Johnson (who released <em>Unfamiliar Faces</em> on his
    Brushfire imprint) and producer Tom Dumont (clearly with some time on his
    hands, post-No Doubt). I'd imagine most people reading this actively loathe
    Johnson not so much for his music, innocuous to the point of invisibility, but
    for a McConaughey-esque ascription to carefree living that is feasible only
    after achieving massive success; paradoxically suggesting money <em>can</em> buy
    happiness. And as was the case with Rogue Wave's most recent album, as well as
    Johnson's, the holistic vibe undermines just about any chance Costa has of
    showing a dark side or artistic unrest, leaving mostly a chamber-singer/songwriter
    record for people who think Kelley Stoltz is too edgy or are scared that Sondre
    Lerche might not speak English.</p><p>
    Certainly there's more to Costa than a one-man acoustical jam, even if his
    pleasure zone isn't far from the AM Gold dial. ""Lilacs"" evidences a
    proclivity for psych-tinged lyrics (""I choked on your kaleidoscope""),
    and I won't even knock its frothy David Gray guitar strum; the track
    itself sorta outstays its welcome. There's plenty of nice production touches
    from Dumont, like the acid-washed backing vocals of the title track and the
    Stephen Street-tipping tones of ""Vienna"". But when Costa tries to
    convincingly ply his ""hypochondriac blues"" on ""Emergency
    Call"", he's clashing with overly peppy horn charts. And then there are the
    times when Costa's got no one to blame but himself: ""Cigarette Eyes""
    hosts one of the more baffling metaphors this side of Tom McRae and has an
    undercurrent of domestic violence, but Costa slowly lets the air out with a
    chord progression too ambitious for his melodic sense and an unrealistic Brit
    affectation.
    </p>
<p>
    It's unfair to write off these guys completely considering Radiohead is
    signed to a label that owes its creation to Dave Matthews. But thus far,
    Brushfire (whether intentionally or not) is keeping their artists on a tight
    leash. Whatever Costa is attempting to convey in ""Trying To Lose My
    Mind"", it gets lost in a Johnson-worthy platitude: ""Put it in a song
    and I know we can get along."" But when ""Miss Magnolia"" tries its
    hand at applying that philosophy to a Grateful Dead tribute, it ends up
    sounding way too much like Mungo Jerry to be unintentional. Really, in the way
    that Johnson embodies the Hawaiian lifestyle, Costa reps for Huntington Beach--
    an archly conservative dreamland that most of its residents secretly wish they
    could leave.

Listening to Mike Bones' (née Strallow) voice on his debut album, <em>The Sky Behind the Sea</em>, is a lot like hearing your own through a set of speakers; the experience is disarming, odd, and above all sort of unpleasant. This is not to say that Strallow is a bad singer-- he doesn't sing off-key or lose breath, and indeed, a limited-run 2007 live show suggests that his pipes hold up better in a club-- just one whose voice never quite shakes that alienating feeling of hearing something unexpected for the first time. It's like he's trying to sing like Hank Williams, or maybe trying hard not to. It's a sensation that colors all of <em>The Sky Behind the Sea</em>, Strallow's debut as a singer and songwriter.</p><p>
    To learn that Strallow actually made his name as a guitarist on New York's underground circuit-- he has backed Damon McMahon and Lizzy Trulie and plays with members of Oneida and Oakley Hall-- is like that time everyone told you Jeff Buckley's <em>Grace</em> was one of the best guitar albums of the 90s. Really? The insistent emphasis on Strallow's voice throughout <em>The Sky</em>-- only ""Town Crier"" makes an attempt to shift weight to the arrangement-- seems like a willful subordination of talent. When he steamrolls the final minute of ""Pope John Paul"" with rough distortion or disrupts the middle of ""Love's Not Yours"", his fingers expose a flare and complexity that his lumpy verses rarely achieve.</p><p>
<em>The Sky</em>'s eight songs are almost relentlessly tuneless and dour. If Strallow has a sense of humor or lightness-- a clever song title like ""The Enemies of My Enemies Hate Me Too"" suggests he might-- he rarely exposes it. Even ""Enemies"" loses its wry punch when you realize that it's quite literally a tale of spiteful persecution (""They would not let me be/ They took all I had from me and left me desired and diseased""). Strallow occasionally offers a strong image-- during ""Do You Wish I Left?"" he mutters ""I don't want what I came here for/ Still I beat my knuckles upon his door""-- but too much of <em>The Sky</em> is a self-serious stew. When Strallow does break the mold, you wish he hadn't: the album's most memorable line bookends ""Pope John Paul"", ""Pope John Paul/ You're my man and all/ But you wasn't always fair"".
    </p><p>
    Strallow's most obvious sonic parallel is Leonard Cohen (even on the outliers: compare ""Town Crier"" to ""First We Take Manhattan""), and like a Cohen album, <em>The Sky</em> contains quiet, woven arrangements subservient to their bandleader's maundering. Strallow's voice, odd though it may be, never growls or whispers or contorts. Instead, he hangs in the air, humidly, casting himself over every moment of <em>The Sky</em>, save those rare occasions when he allows his guitar to speak for him; Strallow can only wonder at his instrument's articulation and passion.

<em>Alegranza! </em>does two things that often
    appear separately in records you fall in love with, but rarely together: On the
    one hand, it reminds you of so much other music you love, and on the other, it
    sounds little like any of them. Spanish artist El Guincho
    (real name: Pablo Díaz-Reixa)
    makes music from Spanish chanting, thudding tribal rhythms, ghostly harmonies,
    and the bits and pieces of a thousand as-yet-unwritten pop songs. It's a combination that won't be appearing in any pop how-to guides any time soon. The
    impressive and probably unwittingly fashionable source material-- Afrobeat,
    dub, Tropicália, and early rock'n'roll-- and the irresistibility of
    these songs can only briefly obscure the fact that no one else is really
    making music quite like this.</p><p>
<em>Alegranza! </em>has already been compared
    extensively to Panda Bear's <em>Person Pitch</em>,
    and the two records do share a hazy, sampladelic love-in feel (hypnotic,
    interlocking sample loops; delirious, auto-harmonizing pop song choruses). I'm
    more strongly reminded of Animal Collective's <em>Strawberry
    Jam</em>, even though this record sounds very different: Both it and <em>Alegranza! </em>are
    spikier, less pristine, and less invested in images of the past.
    There's no sacred totem in <em>Alegranza! </em>to
    play the role that the Beach Boys do for <em>Person
    Pitch</em>-- opener ""Palmitos Park"" may sound a bit like Richie
    Valens, but otherwise El Guincho's songcraft resemblances are at once so broad
    and so diffuse that they feel osmotic rather than deliberate: Confused chants
    coalesce into brain-teasingly familiar vocal hooks, while quicksilver flashes
    of guitar trace echoes of melodies you feel you must already know like the back
    of your hand.</p><p>
    While the ""What if...?"" experiments of <em>Person
    Pitch </em>suggested a future and a past in secret communication with each other, <em>Alegranza! </em>is locked into
    an endless now: a fusion of songful simplicity and unpolished production
    wizardry that feels <em>right </em>more than
    it feels startling. It's nice, too, that this music resists the
    easy tag of ""dreamlike""; there's a sharpness to the detail and to the
    buoyancy of Díaz-Reixa's
    vocals and rhythms that suggests a state of gleeful alertness. This is
    music for children, in the best sense-- wide-eyed and excitedly open to the
    whole spectrum of possibilities out there in the world, devoid of past baggage
    or future anxiety. (In fact, it's not at all coincidental that one of the best
    reference points I can offer for this album is British post-rock band Disco Inferno's final EP, <em>It's a Kid's World</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's something childlike, too, in
    the way El Guincho's chants and harmonies seem to shift between (relative)
    tension and release with delighted and purposeless ease, shuttling between the
    registers of high and higher for the simple thrill of confounding expectations,
    as if reaching a peak and staying there would be a cop-out. The madly hopping
    ""Kalise"", at first ridiculously and hypnotically repetitive, is
    ultimately exposed as a giant tease for an astonishing, panoramic chorus, whose
    multi-tracked ""ah ah ah!"" might be the most utopian moment in music
    you'll hear this year. There's little subtlety here: ""Fata Morgana""
    may begin with ambient washes of sound, disconcerting looped string riffs, and
    abstracted wails in the background, but again it's a trap: the song soon morphs
    into a triumphant anthem, zooming across the stereo mix as if on a trapeze. 
    </p>
<p>
    Most of all, it's Díaz-Reixa's
    intuitive feel for rhythm that marks out <em>Alegranza!
    </em>as such an unusual and enticing listening experience. Deceptively
    simple and surprisingly prominent in the mix, his drum patterns shock not just
    by their variety (how do you get from the charged booty grind of ""Cuando
    Maravilla Fui"" to the spacious underwater kraut-dub of ""Buenos
    Matrimonios Ahí Afuera""?) but also by their suspicious habit of mutating
    almost imperceptibly from comforting to impressively alien: Check the way
    ""Costa Paraíso""'s clattering tribal rhythms fold themselves into ever
    tighter coils of frenzy, like a crowd of dancers about to spontaneously
    combust. Rather than stretch out on endless expanses of sound, El Guincho's
    music is all about sharp and sudden peaks and valleys-- the idea isn't to tune
    in and drop out, but to revel in being surrounded by something larger than
    yourself, swept along on the rapids of rhythm.

    In early 2006, Belong's <em>October Language</em>, the debut album by Turk Dietrich and Michael Jones of New Orleans, was discussed in the context of Hurricane Katrina. That they had recorded the album before the catastrophe didn't seem to matter; ""Katrina"" was the first and only thing that came to mind when you thought about New Orleans in those days, so <em>October Language</em> became for many a kind of response. If nothing else, the association said something about Belong's approach to shoegaze: Where <em>Loveless</em> and its kind tend toward the swooning, sensual, and feminine, using noise to suggest a protective womb into which one can withdraw and dream, Belong's walls of distortion were a shade darker, a few degrees colder, more isolationist. The stuff of an aftermath.</p><p>
    These qualities are magnified on the brief EP <em>Colorloss Record</em>, but something additional is brought to the table: All four of these tracks are covers, complete with vocals. For artists in Belong's sphere, the tendency when covering songs has been to pull the tune apart and reassemble it in a barely-recognizable configuration, using noise to smash the pop confection into a million glittering slivers. Belong have a different M.O. Deep down in the belly of the track, you sense that these songs are intact and functioning normally, but Belong use feedback and drone to overwhelm the tunes, to make them sound small, like something you're straining to hear and can't quite make out. Voices inside a collapsed mineshaft, maybe, or echoes from a kid stuck in a well.</p><p>
    That the four songs chosen are obscure psych-pop tunes adds to the effect, making the voices sound even more distant, harder to hear under an additional layer of dust. The Cleaners From Venus' early-80s take of Syd Barrett's <em>Madcap Laughs</em> closer ""Late Night"" (the version that Belong say they're referencing) is a thin, spiky new wave spin on <em>Nuggets</em>-era psych; Belong take the happy-sad melody and banish it to the horizon, where it can just barely be heard through the thick chords. Someone overhearing it in my vicinity likened it to Robert Pollard trapped inside a seashell, which made some sense; the Technicolor loopiness of the melody survives intact, despite sounding tiny and frail. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Beeside"", originally from Tintern Abbey, is altered most radically, the peppy melody being basically stretched like taffy to such a length that it's hard to tell where the vocals leave off and instruments begin. Because of this transformation it also sounds like the most like traditional (if well done) drone here, like it could have been made by a lot of bands. For Billy Nicholls' ""Girl from New York"", Belong replicate the chords with unstable, static-ridden held tones, but the vocal melody is revealed only gradually, first appearing as short, clipped notes and then hitting the full refrain about halfway in. It's pop song length (three and a half minutes) but still feels epic, as it slides uneasily through its clearly delineated sections. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""My Clown"", originally by the band July, ends the set closer to where it began with the Syd Barrett tune. The plaintive ""But I love my clown more than you know/ Stop fooling around"" chorus sounds like it's addressed not to anyone in particular, but rather to anyone who might hear it, a message in a bottle rolling along on the heavy waves of the chords. As the track progresses-- it's the longest, stretching almost to seven minutes-- the voices become more abstracted, not-quite-lost in the din, which eventually swells into the most richly textured construction on the record. It feels important that the voice is still in there somewhere, but by this point, you feel ready to let it go, to follow the pure sound of Belong wherever it may lead.<br/>

    It's been the mantra of the hardcore vinyl lover since 1982.
    Hell, I was two years old when the CD was introduced and it was the dominant
    medium by the time I could string together a few allowances to buy an album,
    but even I've never found the shiny, lightweight discs half as lovable as the
    good old grooved 45 and 33 1/3 RPM
    LP (to say nothing of 78s, 10""s, and those 16-RPM
    super LPs that never caught on). A jewel case just can't compete with the
    one-foot-by-one-foot cardboard canvas LPs came in for decades. The insert's not
    even as big as a 45 picture sleeve, and we won't even bother talking about
    jpegs. I've never honestly had much of a stake in the argument over whether the
    old grooves have a better sound than the new ones and zeroes, not being much of
    an audiophile, but it's hard not to love the crackle of an aged, well-loved
    piece of vinyl.</p><p>
    Norton Records was founded in 1986 by Brooklynites Miriam
    Linna and Billy Miller. They shared a mutual admiration for West Virginia one-man-band Hasil Adkins,
    whose outsider rockabilly recordings from the 50s were difficult to find at the
    time but presented a lo-fi musical vision that, for their time, bordered on the avant-garde. Their first release was a compilation of his
    work that helped put him back on the map and led to a long and wild run
    of releases of raw and unfiltered rock'n'roll and r&amp;b mayhem, including
    reissues of dozens of obscurities and classics from the 50s, 60s, and 70s and
    releases of numerous contemporary bands that fit the label's basic aesthetic
    preferences. Their catalog these days is an 80-page book dedicated to Adkins,
    who passed away in 2005 just days after being assaulted in his front yard by an
    asshole on an ATV.</p><p>
    Norton has actually released plenty of CDs over the years,
    generally paired with an LP version, but it was one of several labels to keep
    the old 7"" and 12"" formats alive during the late 80s and early 90s,
    when it seemed like they were destined for rapid extinction. The purpose of
    this cheekily named compilation, though, is to offer the internet generation a
    way to hear three CDs worth of wild 45 sides the label has reissued over the
    years. The irony of releasing a compilation called <em>I Hate CDs</em> digitally is entirely intentional.
    </p>
<p>
    If you've been attuned to the Norton ethos over the years,
    chances are the contents of this thing won't surprise you much. It's full of
    brawling garage-rock, demented novelty records, solid rhythm &amp; blues
    obscurities, surfy lead guitars, untrained vocals, and bucketloads of energy. Some
    of the artists included are acknowledged greats-- the two Ramones tracks, ""Judy
    Is a Punk"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend"", are songs everyone should know, and the Sonics are essential to any understanding of
    where punk rock as we know it came from. Big Star's gorgeous power pop
    masterpiece ""September Gurls"" is here, too, as are tunes from Doug Sahm, Link
    Wray, ? &amp; the Mysterians, and Mary Weiss of the Shangri-Las.
    </p>
<p>
    A few tracks are the kind of basic, punk-pop that can serve
    as a gateway drug to crazier stuff. The Real Kids' ""All Kindsa Girls"" is a
    melodic, punchy song that's more than happy to get its handful of chords stuck
    in your head, and the Dictators offer an even more potent earworm with ""Who
    Will Save Rock'n'Roll?"" The guitar riffs, economical solo, and instantly
    memorable ""my generation is not the salvation"" hook make you wonder if it
    really needed saving, because it sounds pretty alive and well on this song.
    </p>
<p>
    There's a raft of seat-of-the-pants blasts of garage rock
    among these 45 tracks, from the primal, indistinct stomp and grotesque fuzz of
    Roy Loney &amp; the A-Bones to the piano-pounding rockabilly thrash of Scotty
    McKay's ""Bad Times"". You can probably guess what the Neanderthals' ""Twinkle
    Toes"" sounds like without much help. This all sits quite comfortably next to
    shuffling r&amp;b bruisers like Don Covay's ""Switchen in the Kitchen"" and
    Esquerita's juke-joint jam ""Rockin' the Joint"". Andre Williams' funky ""The
    Monkey Speaks His Mind"" offers a brilliant inversion of the old evolution
    debate, with a monkey claiming that it's insulting to arborial primates to say
    that man descended from them. ""No monkey ever deserted his wife, starved his
    baby and ruined her life,"" says the monkey. We could learn from this guy.
    </p>
<p>
    The compilation is nicely spiked with a few flat-out strange artists, with the two weirdest grouped together at the beginning of disc two.
    Screamin' Jay Hawkins is a legend in oddball music circles and had a personality
    to match the crazed, bizarre vocal style that gave him his nickname. There's an
    actual club for all of his illegitimate children, who outnumber the broods of
    most Egyptian pharaohs, and his onstage presence was a thing to behold, as he
    emerged from a coffin at the beginning of his sets and used a number of macabre
    props, including a skull that appeared in a great many of his publicity photos.
    His ""I Hear Voices"", included here, is a brilliant and totally
    warped piece of nightmare exotica, with an apocalyptic organ part and frenzied
    voices tugging at his heels as he undergoes a massive vocal freakout. You just
    have to hear it. It's followed by Wade Curtiss &amp; the Rhythm Rockers' ""Puddy
    Cat"", a hard-to-describe rip-off of the Trashmen's ""Surfin' Bird"" that features
    vocals that imitate an angry cat from way back in the throat, giving them a
    simultaneous psychotic and robotic feel.
    </p>
<p>
    This set is great for anyone who's into raw garage-rock, the
    roots of punk, rockabilly, or good-old-fashioned rock'n'roll. And
    despite focusing on mostly unknown old 45 sides, it's not only for fanatics-- a lot of this stuff (certainly not all of it, though) will have
    very broad appeal, and the Adkins track, ""Chicken Shake"", gives newcomers to
    his music a pretty good taste of his style. And then there's the format issue.
    Frankly, most of these records aren't hi-fi enough for anyone to notice much
    difference in quality between the 45s and mp3s, and that exposes the most basic
    fact that gets overlooked in the format debates: it's what's in the grooves
    that counts, and the grooves they've digitized for this comp are a hell of a
    lot of fun to listen to in any medium.

    Wielding a blocky 8-bit arsenal, the Depreciation Guild's more likely
    to attract attention from video game blogs than music publications.
    Considering the tacky rep the video game aesthetic carries in indie
    circles, this doesn't seem like such an unfair relegation for the
    Brooklyn duo. However, as the Nintendo generation continues producing
    new bands-- especially those who know no world before the Famicom
    system-- the use of these 8-bit blips doesn't smack so strongly of
    nostalgic novelty so much as it represents an integral musical element in
    these people's lives. In that vein, the Guild's debut <em>In Her Gentle Jaws</em>
    sticks its neck out further than Nintendocore staples like the
    Advantage or Minibosses, never resorting to tongue-in-cheekery while
    decorating its original compositions in NES furnishings.</p><p>
    As appropriate as it is that <em>In Her Gentle Jaws</em><em> </em>kicks
    off with a cinematic title track tailor-made for an RPG start screen,
    it's the only song here that could plausibly come from an NES
    cartridge-- and even that's a stretch. Despite being heavily steeped in
    the four-channel efficiency of legendary Nintendo composer Koji Kondo,
    the instrumental turns to moody <em>Disintegration</em>-style reverb
    guitar for some extra muscle by the song's midway point. By the dense
    shoegaze of second track ""Sky Ghosts"", the duo's already winnowed their
    virtual stylings into mere ornamentation for <em>In Her Gentle Jaws</em>' two weapons of choice-- laptop pop and shoegaze.</p><p>
    Surprisingly, the mishmash of these two genres with video game music feels organic, and by the end of <em>In Her Gentle Jaws</em><em> </em>these
    monophonic pulse channels don't stick out any more than a guitar with
    fuzz distortion. The Guild pull this off especially well when they play
    up the genres' least common denominators-- escapism, emotional
    expression, and, of course, the fact that these styles of music are
    conducive to brooding alone in your bedroom. Nothing cures the blues
    like a few levels of ""Super Mario Bros."", so naturally the romantic pathos
    of ""Butterfly Kisses"" gets introduced by spaceship launch SFX straight
    from ""Metroid"". The bouncy laptop melodies and tender vocals of
    Kurt Feldman and Christoph Hochheim may bite Ben Gibbard a little, but
    the Guild's seldom so up front about their feelings. For example, is
    the chorus of Cocteau Twins 2.0 song ""Sky Ghosts"" (""Whatever cloud
    you're on/ I will find you"") a heartfelt plea to a lost love or a
    trash-talking gamer threatening the Hammer Brothers?
    </p>
<p>
    The back half of <em>In Her Gentle Jaws</em><em> </em>jettisons any emo
    tendencies, instead opting to explore the recesses of this semi-digital
    realm they've created. Although not quite as enticing as the first
    half's rapid-fire hooks and ADD song structures, the latter tracks form
    a formidable wall of sound, albeit one built using a lot of coin
    blocks. Closer ""Heavy Eyes"" builds mostly on ethereal guitar and
    vocals, but it can't climax until the 8-bit lead comes in, sounding
    strangely feasible in what could pass for a Slowdive song. If video
    game music's ever to have a <em>Loveless</em>, the Guild's taking a serious stab at it, regardless of how many mushroom power-up jokes you got for them.

    Even 20 years after its release, the main appeal of <em>The Trinity Sessions</em>, the Cowboy Junkies'
    second album, remains its lo-fi sound. The ambient buzz of Toronto's
    Church of the Holy Trinity, where the Junkies recorded the album around one
    microphone, colors every song, reinforcing the live setting and generating
    vinyl intimacy even on CD. It's as if the church itself was an instrument, one
    that Junkies could play pretty well. It allows Margo Timmins' voice to fill your field
    of vision, simultaneously soothing and unsettling, while her brother Michael's
    guitar rumbles through the songs, a little louder and sharper than anticipated.
    In 1988, <em>The Trinity Sessions</em> sounded
    old but felt new, a sensation amplified by the liberties they took with cover
    songs. The Junkies brought out the danger of Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I
    Could Cry"" and Patsy Cline's ""Walking After Midnight"", which echo each other
    creepily. They rewrote ""Blue Moon"" as a paean to Elvis, and their slowed-down
    ""Sweet Jane"", endorsed by Lou Reed himself, remains one of the best
    Velvet Underground covers put to tape.</p><p>
    Two decades later, instead of releasing the expected 2xCD special edition with dry liner notes arguing for the band's impact on, say, the
    next decade's alt-country movement, the Junkies came up with a different way to
    celebrate the anniversary of their breakthrough. The band, whose line-up hasn't
    changed since then, returned to the Church of the Holy Trinity and re-recorded <em>The</em> <em>Trinity
    Sessions</em> song by song. There were rules, of course. To capture the loose
    spirit of the originals, they held few rehearsals, allowed themselves only one
    day to record, and again played live in the round. On the other hand, they used
    much more sophisticated equipment; invited Ryan Adams, Vic Chesnutt, Natalie
    Merchant, and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird to play along; and had the
    performance filmed.</p><p>
    The performance has been released on CD/DVD as <em>Trinity Revisited</em>, and it is certainly
    an odd product-- redundant to anyone familiar with <em>The Trinity Sessions </em>and unconvincing to everyone else. This isn't
    a reinterpretation, but a re-enactment. The Junkies run through songs almost
    note for note, and when they go off-script, as on the overly dramatic reading
    of ""Sweet Jane"", they display only their limitations. The Junkies don't really
    jam, nor do they do noise very well. Thank God for Vic Chesnutt, whose
    idiosyncratic phrasing and ghostly moans add new twists to ""Blue Moon
    Revisited"" and ""Postcard Blues"", as if he's been singing along to them for
    years. Ryan ""Bedhead"" Adams fares nearly as well,
    turning ""200 More Miles"" into a rolling trucker's anthem. Unfortunately,
    Natalie Merchant's presence, as always, is overly somber, especially on
    ""Misguided Angel"". At no point in her career has she ever mustered the
    sexuality needed to convey the song's conflicted desires. 
    </p>
<p>
    What is perhaps most disappointing is that the gentle
    irreverence of the original, which had the temerity to take liberties with traditional
    blues and country, has been commemorated with such a respectful performance.
    Covering their own originals or covering themselves covering others' songs, the
    Junkies surrender fully to their own history, adding nothing to songs they once
    proved could always be newly reimagined. Amid all the back-patting, the lo-fi
    sound that so distinguished <em>The Trinity
    Sessions</em> is lost completely, and the church becomes nothing more than a
    pretty backdrop. The worst I can say for <em>Trinity
    Revisited</em> is that it sounds utterly placeless; the best I can say is that
    it made me dig out my old copy of <em>The
    Trinity Sessions</em> and give it another spin.

TWO! THREE! FOUR!</strong></p><p>
    Every musician is also an audience, and if the ever-growing pile of new music my exhausted mailman brings me every day is any indication, more and more audience members are becoming musicians, too. Since long before ""indie"" was a buzzword, the loosely defined scene has celebrated participatory self-expression-- whether in the first independently released punk records (""It was easy, it was cheap, go and do it,"" sang the Desperate Bicycles in 1977, on one of the first ever), the hand-assembled 7"" singles of 1980s indie pop, the four-track cassettes of 1990s lo-fi, or even the revival-meeting catharsis of the Arcade Fire and ""Form a Band"" exhortations of Art Brut. Nobody writes them like they used to, so it may as well be you.</p><p>
<strong>(WITH MY WALKMAN TUCKED UNDER MY FOREARM)</strong>
</p><p>
    Few bands have made as much out of this ideal of enthusiast-as-artist as Los Campesinos!. Formed two years ago at Cardiff University in Wales, the indie-pop septet first grabbed attention on MySpace, but their music embodies some the best elements of the past 30 years of indie music. It's not just the superficial connections, like their Ramones- or Pastels-style surnames, band-made zine, or the cover of Pavement B-side ""Frontwards"" on last year's slept-on <em>Sticking Fingers Into Sockets</em> EP. With boy/girl exclamations (!) befitting a punkier Heavenly/Calvin Johnson collaboration (!!), the lavish instrumentation of Broken Social Scene (whose Dave Newfeld produces), childish glockenspiels, and exuberantly buzzing guitars, debut album <em>Hold on Now, Youngster...</em> is a giddy, tuneful love note to individuality, pathos, smarts, silliness, and everything else indie pop built its name on. There's even the requisite ironic self-mockery-- nobody actually thought this stuff was <em>cool</em>, did they?
    </p>
<p>
<strong>FOUR SWEATY BOYS WITH GUITARS TELL ME NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Like indie bands from the Smiths to Vampire Weekend, Los Campesinos! pack their songs with lyrical specificity, only their lives are apparently full of internet surfing, indie fandom, and absurd humor. ""Stick with the imprints/ With the hieroglyphics that the fan club sent us,"" Gareth Campesinos! hollers with every exclamation point in his young being on ""Broken Heartbeats Sound Like Breakbeats"", which claps into an Aleksandra Campesinos!-sung chorus about Spiderman. This bunch are as apt to sing about CTRL-ALT-DEL, LiveJournal entries, and that old blogger standby ""throwing up in my mouth"" as they are about B-sides, K Records T-shirts, or C-90 cassettes. Hey, this is what they know, and they document it with an emotional vividness that should have Pete Wentz friending them in no time. (Even though he probably won't get most of their jokes.)
    </p>
<p>
<strong>THE OPPOSITE OF TRUE LOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: REALITY!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Depressive gloominess is, of course, another indie hallmark, perhaps put most succinctly by a certain former K Records affiliate in the Nirvana title ""I Hate Myself and I Want to Die"". <em>Hold on Now, Youngster...</em> takes on the topic with wit, sure, but also an ache that suggests that such feelings are still all too real to them. Asked what character from <em>The Breakfast Club</em> he would be, Gareth proclaims, ""I'd be the one that dies."" Told by Aleksandra that ""no one dies,"" he retorts, ""Well, then what's the point?"" Then again, ""...And We Exhale and Roll Our Eyes in Unison"" flirts with sex-- starting with the coy opening line, ""It's bad enough you ever use the word as an adjective""-- so Los Campesinos! have also shed some of indie-pop's stereotypical puritanism.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>AND EVERY SENTENCE THAT I SPOKE BEGAN AND ENDED IN ELLIP...SES!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In contrast with the often exclusively macho male archetypes typically offered by mainstream rock and hip-hop, indie-oriented bands since the Modern Lovers have offered new visions of masculinity. And <em>Hold on Now, Youngster...</em>'s masterful update of indie tropes goes as far as embracing indie pop's bookish wimpiness for both boys and girls, from the <em>Jane Eyre</em> disses of the colorfully chiming ""Don't Tell Me to Do the Math(s)"" to the ""damn extended metaphors"" of ""My Year in Lists"" to, well, there's a song called ""We Are All Accelerated Readers"". The best holdover from the <em>Sticking Fingers Into Sockets</em> EP, ""You! Me! Dancing!"", is a shy acknowledgment that as much as indie audiences may have come to love dance music, not everyone can do the <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6vdD5HOSgw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dude 'N Nem</a></strong>.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>I SPENT THE LAST SEVEN YEARS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF MY BED SCRATCHING ""I AM INCREDIBLY SINCERE"" INTO MY FOREARM!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Wry self-criticism has been arguably another of the most integral aspects of indie fandom for decades. If you're going to be a lonely obsessive carting around boatloads of worthless records and even more useless knowledge, you'd better at least have a sense of humor about it. And Los Campesinos! do: ""Well, I need new hobbies, that's one thing for certain,"" they shout on ""Knee Deep at ATP"" after overturning <em>High Fidelity</em>'s hypothesis that ""what really matters is what you like, not what you are like."" The aforementioned ""My Year in Lists"" starts to apply the music fanatic's favorite pastime, list-making, to New Year's resolutions, then thinks better of it. You won't admit to reading about it in Pitchfork. Whatever.<br/></p>
<p>
<strong>I GET CARRIED AWAY...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For all its unabashed indie fandom, <em>Hold on Now, Youngster...</em> varies from the music it worships in a very fundamental way. No one will ever call Los Campesinos! ""shambling"", as John Peel termed the twee-pop set, nor will they be called slackers, like their heroes Pavement, because this debut is unusually taut and polished, with hooks, crescendos, and clever turns of phrase nearly always in the right place. Yeah, they've started recycling a couple of their tricks, like Ballboy-esque spoken-word outros, and their youthful, shouty vocals won't be for everyone. But in the album's highlight, ""Sweet Dreams, Sweet Cheeks"", the guitars jangle in one speaker and squawk in the other, building up to a gleeful chant-- ""One blink for yes, two blinks for no!""-- that caps one of the most triumphant indie-pop songs you're likely to hear in 2008. Cynics will no doubt tar the band's admirers as undeveloped, ignorant, or stupid. But we're happy.

Bassist Liam Wilson once dubbed his band ""The Dillinger Insurance Plan."" DEP's brutal live shows (at New York's Virgin Megastore in 2005, singer Greg Puciato literally <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-lxwlgyhhA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ran over the crowd</a></strong>) are partially responsible for the group's high rate of attrition. Only one member, guitarist Ben Weinman, remains from the original lineup.</p><p>
    Despite a turnover of four guitarists, two bassists, one singer, and one drummer, DEP's sound has retained its foundation, mathcore, which it nearly perfected on 1999's <em>Calculating Infinity</em>. Around that time, Converge, Cave In, and Botch also twisted hardcore punk into angular, metallic shapes. But DEP were twice as spastic and technical, spraying odd meters and dissonant lines like epileptic machine gunners. <em>Calculating Infinity</em> was an instant classic, inspiring a new generation of mathcore bands like Psyopus, the End, and Thumbscrew.</p><p>
    However, DEP branched out. In 2001, vocalist Dimitri Minakakis left the band. <em>Irony Is a Dead Scene</em> followed, an explosive collaboration with Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle) which included a cover of Aphex Twin's ""Come to Daddy"". In DEP, Puciato replaced Minakakis' one-note bark with an extremely wide range. 2004's <em>Miss Machine</em> deployed this range over varied tempos, electronics, and occasional pop moments. Faith No More and Nine Inch Nails were obvious influences; on 2006's <em>Plagiarism</em> covers EP, Puciato did a note-perfect Trent Reznor-- and a passable Justin Timberlake. Such moves are pure Patton, and Puciato's voice is startlingly similar in timbre.</p><p>
    But unlike Patton, DEP don't colonize their experiments. Inevitably songs return to quirky, jerky cores. On <em>Ire Works</em>, the ""Living Colour as white boys"" falsettos of ""Black Bubblegum"" are startling at first-- not to mention its recent <strong><a href=""http://www.redlasso.com/ClipPlayer.aspx?id=16869727-f821-49e5-8c5e-fdddf9d81b9e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performance</a></strong> on ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"". But even such a poppy song has a churning, abrasive bridge. Half of <em>Ire Works</em> is still mathcore. Unlike <em>Calculating Infinity</em>'s sprawling roundhouse kicks, though, <em>Ire Works</em> throws short, hard jabs. Most songs clock in well under three minutes. New drummer Gil Sharone is much to credit for the punchiness. His predecessor, Chris Pennie, was a formidable technician, but Sharone adds a palpable sense of groove. More than ever, DEP have songs.</p><p>
    They're also the band's most colorful to date. Glitchy electronics palpitate ""Sick on Sunday"" and ""When Acting as a Wave"". Strings flutter like insect wings on ""When Acting as a Particle"". The piano soundscape of ""Dead as History"" could come from NIN's <em>The Fragile</em>. ""Milk Lizard"" oozes sleazy horns over saucy rock, while ""Mouth of Ghosts"" unfurls psychedelic, jazzy jamming. These are elephants in the mathcore room; then again, Faith No More was about elephants in the room, and DEP now pick up where Faith No More left off.</p></div>"|11156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11156-ire-works/|8.0|Cosmo Lee

    Hands"", the most well-known release from dubstep producer (and co-owner of
    label Skull Disco) Shackleton, succeeds by restraint, its scintillating percussion loops so clearly and carefully etched that it's difficult to know
    what to make of the song's ghostly narrator: ""When I see the towers fall, it
    cannot be denied/ That as a spectacle it is a realization of the mind."" In any other
    dubstep producer's hands such a vision would be married to a groove
    of apocalyptic violence, or at least uncompromising grimness, but Shackleton
    realizes just how unnerving beauty can be. It's this (and the hi-hat quietly
    ticking on every half-beat) that allowed the track to cross over to minimal
    house dancefloors-- indeed, the subsequent Ricardo Villalobos remix, included
    on this two disc Skull Disco retrospective, had to stretch out past 18
    minutes just to ward off charges of redundancy.</p><p>
    ""Skull Disco"" is
    often used as shorthand for the refined, delicate sound of the label's main
    producer Shackleton, ignoring the sound of the label's other owner-producer
    Appleblim, and the distance that separates the two. On the first disc of <em>Soundboy
    Punishments</em> their tracks
    are counterposed, only emphasizing their respective strengths and weaknesses.
    Appleblim, who contributes almost a third of the tracks here, is surprisingly
    close to dubstep hegemony, his stunted, slow-motion ""halfstep"" beats,
    nihilistic basslines, and overwrought breakdowns distinctive only for their
    relative subtlety and high production values.
    Appleblim is
    clearly a student of music history, and his productions bear the strong imprint of
    early techstep drum'n'bass' moody, midnight noir vibe-- in fact the stomping ""Fear"" is an open (and pretty great) homage to this sound. But what Appleblim and other halfstep
    producers often inherit from techstep are
    grooves that sound wounded and even crippled, dragging themselves forward in a
    painfully lopsided manner, as if all their limbs ended in bloody stumps. The
    crucial difference is tempo: The faster speeds of techstep allowed the grooves
    to be dynamic and fleet-footed in spite of their blood and gore; Appleblim's
    grooves mostly just stagger unpleasantly, their accumulated menace excreted in blaring explosions of bass.</p><p>
    Shackleton's work
    raises entirely different questions: If his fluid, multi-textured rhythms
    clearly share dubstep's lineage, they're too ornate and perfect-sounding to be
    mistaken for any other producer's work.<span> 
    Set opener ""Hamas Rule"" is even more painfully refined than ""Blood on My Hands"", each percussive
    rustle placed with agonising care, while underneath the sub-bass roams and
    prowls with a lazy, feline grace. Shackleton's flair for intricacy
    is impressive and almost unmatched-- of all the dubstep producers operating,
    only Pinch and Mala can concoct such thrillingly delicate grooves, and then
    even they fall short of Shackleton's single-minded devotion to the cause. 
    </span></p><p>
    But the formalism
    and reserve of Shackleton's arrangements can render them as claustrophobic as
    they are compelling, like staring at beautifully sculpted (but locked and
    unscaleable) wrought iron gates. If Appleblim marshals together bundles of
    energy and menace without knowing what to do with them, Shackleton's production
    can seem like statues of invincible soldiers, only waiting for someone to
    enliven and animate them. I keep expecting these grooves to ""brock out""-- to
    borrow a term from drum &amp; bass-- but such brute physicality is rarely on
    the producer's agenda. Perhaps he thinks such displays would undermine the
    impressive self-containment and majesty of his arrangements, and he might be
    right.
    </p><p>
    Still, when he
    succumbs (mostly on disc two) the results are stunning: ""I Want To Eat You"", at
    first slow and reverent, shifts from poised vigilance into a double-time and
    deadly battle, its rippling, snaking drums
    slicing through the majestic arrangement like glittering blades. And while
    Appleblim's line-towing conservativism largely bores, some of <em>Soundboy
    Punishment</em>'s most
    enjoyable moments are
    those where Shackleton drifts closer to the scene orthodoxy of his partner in
    crime. The jittery grime/dubstep fusion of ""Stalker"" wears the producer's sonic signature more
    lightly than anything else by him, but its tense, paranoid stutters brilliantly
    live up to the track's title.
    </p>
<p>
    Likewise, the
    spacious but restlessly energetic closer ""You Make Me Cry"", all fluttering
    bongos and stabbing halfstep beats, flawlessly appropriates the best ideas from Benga and
    Skream's more agile dubstep productions. Not surprisingly, it's on these
    excursions away from his perfected template that Shackleton can sound almost
    lighthearted. He should try it more often: The weight of possibility is enough
    that he hardly needs to make things heavier.

While I'm sure they have their own ambitions (and lives), they should still be hired out in an act of musical socialism, or be hired guns for some label like the Memphis Horns, pushing the music of their peers forward with their fluid and distinctive patter, mined from Motown and forged in D.C. Take Statehood's ""End the Moderation"": verses where manic drumming barely leave room for the morse-code rhythm of the chicken-scratch guitars, bookended by huge, dramatic strums, before they lay back and breathe for a dreamy, but driving chorus, and finally collapse in a pile at the end of each refrain. It's a relay-race performance for all involved, but even the sharpest songwriter on their own couldn't make these transitions without sounding ostentatious about it or tripping over their feet. With Axelson and Easley, it's another day on the job. Musicians sound better when these two are behind them.</p><p>
    But despite the presence of the two of them and guitarist Leigh Thompson, Statehood's 2007 debut is pretty much a vehicle for singer and guitarist Clark Sabine. <em>Lies and Rhetoric</em> is a record that still has one foot in the bedroom, and the other in the melodic, but twisted D.C. post-hardcore that  plenty of listeners will never tire of. ""A Story's End"" and ""Giants"" start the record off with nervous energy and distinctive melodies, but don't quite transcend the anxious pulse of the post-punk we've heard much of before. The guitars grind out tense progressions in syncopated bursts while Sabine flips between his nervous croon and choked, emotive yelp (not too far from another area luminary, J. Robbins). The rhythm section asserts themselves more in the steady sidestep of ""Save Yourself"", but more than that, its chorus is a surprise dreamy cool-down with just a bit of minimal, textural guitar, like falling rain on a rooftop, courtesy of Thompson. Sabine's lyrics are unfortunately broad here (""The house we built has crumbled""), but it's a moment where the four of them congeal into a passage that's creative and surprising.</p><p>
    The aforementioned rhythm section add ghostly percussion to ""Every Single Question"", making Sabine's distorted vocal all the more ominous, and a sleek mechanical thump to closer ""Jailer's Daughter""; you wouldn't think it from the rest of the record, but the influence of dance music is integrated in thoughtful, unobtrusive ways that always serve the song. Thompson acquits himself well on the sparkling textures of ""Hidden Views"" and even some talkbox-like effects on ""Transfixed"". The lyrics on the latter offer vague notions of dissent without digging into themes of ""lies and rhetoric"" the song mentions offhand, alluding more towards interpersonal relationships in pattern with most of the record.
    </p><p>
    The interplay is seamless in ""No, I Don't Think You Want to Know"", which features both a familiar loping disco beat as well as a spacey, almost drum-n-bass bridge, as well as woozy, delirious guitar bends and another indelible chorus. Likewise, the deft curveball chorus of ""Still Spinning"" is both gorgeous and chest-beating, and it's on these tracks where Sabine shows off his New Pop side just as much as the side steeped in post-hardcore. These moments are obvious standouts, but the rest remind us of that one thing that's hard to write about because it's impossible to quantify: chemistry between musicians. It's where prior influences and new ideas go in, and come out as something entirely different; when a band is more than the sum of their parts. The Dismemberment Plan was a shining example, and all the later projects of their members have just reminded how rare that quality is. Songs like ""Disconnect"" were near finished (and even available on the band's myspace page) before Sabine hooked up with his current cohorts, and there's a fine singer-songwriter's record here, one that's angrier and funkier than most, and benefits from some talented and sensitive accompanists. But what I'm really looking forward to is future releases where Statehood might start to sound like more of a full band.

    Cabaret music can be played as camp or played as kitsch, but it's best when it's played straight. Not that Baby Dee cares much about playing it straight. A loud and proud transgender performance artist, Baby Dee's a self proclaimed former ""traveling hermaphrodite"" who spent time working a Coney Island freak show (a family show, she says) before ditching New York and returning to her home town of Cleveland, where, if you believe her autobiographical press notes, she ran a tree removal service (imagine being on the receiving end of that service call). It was there that fan Will Oldham came knocking, rescuing Baby Dee from can't-pay-the-bills obscurity.</p><p>
    Oldham wasn't exactly calling blind, however. A friend of Antony Hegarty, Baby Dee also found support from early Antony benefactor and Oldham pal David Tibet (of Current 93). Tibet had released Antony's debut on his Durtro label, and he would do the same for several of Baby Dee's recordings. In Cleveland, Oldham invited Baby Dee to support him and Matt Sweeney on their <em>Superwolf</em> tour, and apparently she made enough of an impression that Oldham and Sweeney subsequently signed on to produce and play on her excellent Drag City debut <em>Safe Inside the Day</em>, the album rounded out by vets of Hegarty's band, Chavez, Current 93, and no less than incredible hulk Andrew WK on bass.</p><p>
    Even were the Antony connection not explicit, there's no missing some musical similarities. As with Antony, Baby Dee gets over on her total, naked sincerity, the kind of presence and honesty that pushes right through any preconceived notions. She shares this quality with a host of fellow outsiders and eccentrics, everyone from Tiny Tim through Tom Waits, artists who approached cabaret and vaudeville in a manner that transcended categorization.
    </p>
<p>
    Baby Dee's earlier releases were solo affairs, and while she's certainly surrounded by steady hands here, she's hardly leaning on her collaborators for support. If anything, given the explicitly autobiographical bent of <em>Safe Inside the Day</em>, it's overwhelmingly Baby Dee's show, and for better or for worse her outsized personality dominates, even on instrumental tracks like ""A Christmas Jig for a Three-Legged Cat"" or ""Flower on the Tracks"". Those instrumentals come late in the album, and since by then you've been well-immersed in her world, lyrics or not those instrumentals continue in the mode established earlier by songs like the title track and ""The Only Bones That Show"".
    </p>
<p>
    It's on cuts like these that Baby Dee brings us back to her Cleveland roots, from whence stem memories dark, wistful, and sometimes even a tad humorous. In the latter category falls ""The Dance of Diminishing Possibilities"", about a pair of neighborhood characters who take an ax to an upright piano. The rest of the disc is populated with drunks and daddy, damaged goods and dreamers, subjects given arrangements that wouldn't have been out of place on Waits' <em>Rain Dog</em>s but here are offered with a confessional edge.
    </p>
<p>
    The twisted piano ditty ""Big Titty Bee Girl (From Dino Town)"", for example, denotes a litany of abuses levied on an albino victim, with Baby Dee's voice a mix of ironic sun and menacing snarl. In ""The Only Bones That Show"", it's teeth that link smiles with violence, vulnerability, and viciousness. In ""You'll Find Your Footing"" Baby Dee makes hope sound like an illusion embraced by the desperate at rock bottom. ""You'll find your footing/ In another world/ On another day/ And in another time/ You'll find your footing there.""
    </p>
<p>
    It probably goes without saying that Baby Dee has had something of a tough life, but what makes <em>Safe Inside the Day</em> so palatable is its tenderness. If Baby Dee's voice is something of an acquired taste, there's no faking the conviction as she exorcises her demons. Besides, rarely has an exorcism come off so resoundingly beautiful. A heart of darkness and a heart of gold need not be mutually exclusive, and in Baby Dee's world, even a sunrise in hell is no less pretty for its surroundings.

On smoldering rockers like ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" and ""Patriot's Heart"", AMC's Mark Eitzel was a bar-stool prophet calling the nation to account for its moral hypocrisies and empty promises. These polemics, rendered as character sketches, were softened by the profound empathy the singer displayed toward his subjects. Four years later, we're still at war, and like many of us, Eitzel seems to have found his anger shading into weariness. There are still flashes of bile: ""The Sleeping Beauty"" makes time, amid its autumnal romanticism, to fire a potshot at ""the bankers, the liars, and the thieves"" that ""want to sell you into a life of fear,"" while on ""The Dance"", a cop's sunglasses ""show the world who's on the winning team."" But by and large, <i>The Golden Age </i>is a relentlessly interior record, from the contemplative nature of its quiet arrangements to its dreamy, sentimental lyrics.</p>
<p>Besides exceptionality and archetypal purity, golden ages are typified by brevity. As such, AMC's <i>The Golden Age </i>is appropriately obsessed with the hemorrhaging of time; many songs here find Eitzel grasping at the stuff even as it spurts through his fingers. ""It's hard to love when you only see the dust,"" he mopes amid the wistful acoustic arpeggios of ""All My Love"". Eitzel's view of life as something one snatches from death's clutches, bit by bit, is the motif that drives the album. ""Time is a current that only flows from warm hands to warm heart,"" he asserts on the darkly rushing ""Decibels and Little Pills"", after observing that ""names are only good for grave stones.""</p>
<p>It's undeniable that, as a lyricist, Eitzel works in homilies and clichés. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" finds him driving over the dead leaves of a southern town, watching someone wave goodbye in his rearview mirror. On ""The Stars"", a monochromatic dirge with a prismatic rock chorus, he sings, ""We marry our fear/ But what makes the night not so deep/ Is someone watching over us/ While we sleep."" And on ""Who You Are"", he offers, ""I'm stuck in my confusion/ I hope you'll go far/ You're chased by the horizon/ Because you know who you are."" Frankly, these lyrics might be intolerable if melodrama were Eitzel's thing. But his gruff gentility, and his masterful command of his voice, redeems them. In going for the soft-sell, the light touch with the heavy sentiment, Eitzel doesn't try to make more of his truisms than they are, letting their time-worn wisdom carry their own weight.</p>
<p>It's the same story with the music: AMC works a deceptively simplistic vein of shadowy Americana, characterized by seductive blurs of acoustic guitar, twinkling leads, and circular compositions that complement the album's obsession with the wheel of time. There's just enough variation to keep it from being homogeneous: ""The John Berchman Victory Choir"" proceeds as a series of pauses and flourishes, breaking the album's metronomic regularity; the organ-fueled ""All the Lost Souls Welcome You to San Francisco"" (one of a pair of picturesque odes to Eitzel's hometown) bounces instead of slinking; and ""The Windows on the World"", a character-driven meditation on the tourist's urge to scale great heights, sloshes woozily. American Music Club's central values-- humility, self-effacement through musical understatement, sentimental candor-- may be currently out of fashion, but <i>The Golden Age</i> proves that, handled with care, they never truly go out of style.</p></div>"|11185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11185-the-golden-age/|7.7|Brian Howe

At a medium volume, it loses     vitality. Any lower and it's a complete waste of time. Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo's twisted update on early rock riffs     and Jesus and Mary Chain distortion was built for intensity, and when cranked up to speaker-rattling levels, that agenda is clear. Granted, any album would     gain new (and not necessarily pleasing) power at exaggerated volumes, but <i>Lust Lust Lust</i> sounds specifically engineered     for eardrum-exploding impact. The few instruments-- guitar, drums, bass,     guitar, synths, vocals, and guitar-- all bleed together into an aggressively trebly jangle, Wagner's riffs and waves     of distortion washing over you like a bad trip.</p>
<p><i>Lust Lust Lust</i> is     the Raveonettes' third full-length, and on first spin, it might sound like a     step backwards. Their previous effort, 2005's <i>Pretty in Black,</i> was a look-at-me effort that scrubbed the     grime off their past work and expanded the duo into a full band with guests like     Mo Tucker and Ronnie Spector. But it also proved the Raveonettes don't clean up     very well; they're most presentable when they're <i>not</i> presentable, so the     return to distortion is a welcome regression.</p>
<p><i>Lust Lust Lust </i>relies less heavily on     the early-rock influences that informed the 2002 EP <i>Whip It On!</i> and 2003's <i>Chain     Gang of Love</i>, as the Raveonettes have learned to better integrate them into     a fuller arsenal of sounds. Opener ""Aly Walk With Me"" is the record's best argument for maximum volume. Over a coldly steady heartbreak-stroll drumbeat, Wagner and Foo chant verses between eruptions of scalding guitar     distortion. ""Aly, walk with me in my dreams/ All through the night,"" they sing in dead-eyed harmony. Part wet-dream manifesto, part invocation to a soiled     muse, the track makes an ideal introduction into the gutter world of <i>Lust Lust Lust</i>, where Foo's gauzy vocals     rise out of the din and where desire can seriously fuck with your color     registration.</p>
<p>What makes the Raveonettes so compelling-- and what elevates their nostalgia above pure gimmickry-- is their refusal to separate sex from drugs from     rock'n'roll. They're all the same sin, and all worthy of the same distortion.     ""You Want the Candy"" disguises its sordidness (""tastes so sweet makes good love     bad"") with sugary pop hooks that might have you believe Wagner means ""candy""     literally. The Raveonettes usually sound best when they play fast: ""Blush"",     ""Dead Sound"", and ""Blitzed"" rush by on Foo's shoegaze/girl-group vocals, synths     that sparkle like stars over slums, and Wagner's back-alley Silvertone     approximation, quickening the pace as they convey barely contained excitement     of some dark need. But slower songs like ""Expelled From Love"" and ""Sad     Transmission"" allow Wagner to play around a little more, crafting pulsing beats     from a drum machine or a guitar and translating old styles into new contexts.</p>
<p>In the past, Wagner has held himself to certain restrictions     as a means of sonically defining a release: On <i>Whip It On!</i> the Raveonettes played all their songs in the key of B-flat minor     using only three chords. For <i>Chain Gang     of Love</i>, they switched to B-flat major. On <i>Lust Lust Lust</i>, there are no stated restrictions, just the     unavoidable limitations of one guy playing only a few instruments. Wagner can     only get so many sounds out of this array, so even at 12 well-sequenced     tracks (14 counting the U.S. edition's two bonus tracks), the album occasionally     seems overlong and repetitive, not because the songs are weak but because not     every one of them shows us something new. A case could be made that this musical     dynamic mirrors the machinations of desire, as <i>Lust Lust Lust </i>details the many ways that good love can grow stale,     with or without new things to want. But really, for the most part these shortcomings can be drowned     out with sheer volume.</p></div>"|11184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11184-lust-lust-lust/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

    Originality is overrated. Indeed, there's something pleasantly, comfortably, even lovingly familiar about just about every last element of <em>Mission Control</em>, the second album by Athens, Georgia's the Whigs. A riff there, a crash here, a little bit of purloined melody there, a little bit of swagger here. Taken as a whole, however, the disc adds up to... OK, so it basically adds up to latter day Local H, redux. But it's hard to fault the Whigs for trying, since they try so damn hard. The secret to the (conditional) success of <em>Mission Control</em> is that the band tackles every last rock'n'roll beat (both literal and figurative) with maximum energy and enthusiasm, mashing rock's rich history, both mainstream and underground, all together into a sharp power-pop collage.</p><p>
    Typically, that's the kind of approach that gets bands signed to desperate and easily impressed majors-- enthusiasm over talent-- and indeed <em>Mission Control</em> marks the group's first album for Dave Matthews ATO imprint. But in the Whigs' case more than a little bit of honest to goodness hard work played into the equation: non-stop touring, good buzz, and most of all the satisfying feeling of calories well burnt.</p><p>
    In fact, one of the most lasting pleasures of the disc is the sense that the Whigs left the studio each day drenched in sweat-- band and board alike. Expertly and very loudly produced by Rob Schnapf, there's not a track on <em>Mission Control</em> that isn't primed for maximum impact, not in the slick spit-and-polish sense but in the explosive sense. Yet for all its intensity, the album's hardly intense. The group's pop instincts are simply too strong, and if the studio magic threatens to steamroll right over the tunes, the band confidently holds its own.
    </p>
<p>
    Pixies, late-period Replacements, Spoon on steroids-- these are just a few more touchstones for the openers ""Like a Vibration"" and ""Production City"", songs that showcase Parker Gispert's perfectly rough rock voice and in particular Julian Dorio's indomitable drums (here paired with a couple of strong stand-in bassists while the group's lineup was in flux). But familiarity in this case is no grounds for discontent, especially since the Whigs never resort to pastiche.
    </p>
<p>
    Everything about the slight breather ""Sleep Sunshine""-- from the waltz time to the keyboard intro to the slide guitar-- rings a bell, but the band makes the confection work. Same thing for the 1960s jangle of ""Hot Bed"" or the huge wall of guitars and pounding drums that comprise ""Right Hand On My Heart"", or the hooky quiet/loud dynamism of ""I Got Ideas"". It takes cojones to do this stuff as if no one has ever done it before, but you've got to respect the outcome, and, over-the-top or not, at least <em>Mission Control</em> doesn't fuck around. Like some big car-driving bad seed pulling up outside the high school, it's an easy album to fall for.

After two minutes of this enjoyable ruckus, the disc jumps into a 16-track mix of modern-day post-punk and indie-approved dance tracks that I assume by the incongruous Refused intro is meant to signify the ""new noise"" of a 21st century American Apparelled rock/dance zeitgeist that's not at all played out in the slightest.</p><p>
    Granted, this thing passes the American Bandstand test just fine, which is its primary purpose. That said, a broken dishwasher also has a beat to it, and sticking someone's gussied-up 1987 Maytag front and center at the trendiest L.A. hot spot would undoubtedly get both scene-stealers and scene-makers on the floor in time for a Cobrasnake photo op. So we have a guitar-flavored version of the boundary-busting credo offered in Green Velvet's ""Shake and Pop""-- ""I like electro/ I like retro/ I like ghetto/ House &amp; techno""-- never mind that kicking those doors down in a Daft Punk world doesn't take all that much effort.  That said, whenever Aoki tries to bring two (or three) purportedly great tastes together, the end result is the aural equivalent of mixing toothpaste and orange juice.  In Aoki's mind, Mickey Avalon can offer a verse on a perfectly fine little electro squiggle like K.I.M.'s ""Wet 'N Wild"" without gumming up the works, while Pase Rock can pinch a horny-backpacker loaf on one of two Justice tracks and not sound like an assclown. For what it's worth, Pase does his business all over ""Waters of Nazareth""-- take a wild G.U.E.S.S. what the other Justice track is (and guess which indie-rooted RMXGRP worked their magic on it).</p><p>
    Guests of similar quality pepper the disc, with only Kid Sister's turn atop ""Shake and Pop"" being worth a damn.  Turns by the vocalists for Hot Hot Heat and the Faint come off more like extraneous cameos than the spotlight-grabbers they should be.  If only other folks followed suit: Har Mar Superstar fronts like <em>Licensed to Ill</em> is the be-all and end-all of hip-hop, Spank Rocker Amanda Blank manages to make a turgid remix of Does It Offend You, Yeah? even worse, and Santogold damages one of the mix's more enjoyable tracks (""Licky [Work It Out]""), with her bargain-basement-Peaches turn at the mic.
    </p><p>
    If you're the sort that accepts no substitutes, then you'll be happy to know that the original shows up on this thing as well, thanks to Weird Science, a remix duo featuring a member of Moving Units and a certain Mr. Aoki. Peaches emerges relatively unscathed on their manhandling of ""Boys Wanna Be Her"", but then there's her turn atop a castrated version of Bloc Party's ""Helicopter"".  Weird Science take a perfectly fine guitar-driven track, strip out its frenetic drive, add a lumpy sea-sick strobe-bass beat, and put the track's focus entirely on Kele Okereke's and Peaches' vocals, because that's supposedly where the party is.
    </p>

    After 50 minutes of this tired nonsense, with the highlights (like the bloops and bleeps of Yelle's thankfully untouched ""Je Veux Te Voir"", or the bits of Datarock's strummy ""Fa-Fa-Fa"" that aren't beset by hot hot air) sorely outnumbered by the lowlights, the mix ends with another turgid rock-meets-dance-with-guest remix, this time a track by Dim Mak group (and post-punk aficionados) Scanners with additional words of wisdom offered by Justice labelmate Uffie.  By this point, whatever ""new noise"" Aoki seemed to promise at the start comes off as just futile sound and fury signifying the number of folks he has in his iPhone and/or under contract.

<em>Songs From the Bigtop</em>
    is the soundtrack to Devon Reed's movie musical <em>The Bigtop</em>, a movie about a kid from the prairie who runs away with
    the circus and, in Reed's description, ""essentially becomes a monster in his
    quest for power."" He also falls in love and there's apparently a subplot about
    industrial sabotage-- I can't elaborate much beyond that, because the film isn't
    out yet as of this writing and I've naturally not been able to see it. The
    soundtrack, however, functions fine without the movie: These are fully
    developed, listenable songs, all written by Reed but performed by
    an assortment of indie rock names and newcomers-- in some cases, before the screenplay was even written.</p><p>
    Fittingly then, most of the music has no circus feel in
    either the writing or the instrumentation, so don't come hoping for calliopes,
    trumpets, and barrel organs. Instead, it's pretty straightforward indie pop and
    indie rock, but performed by an all-star cast: Built to Spill's Doug Martsch, the Clientele, Damien Jurado, Robert
    Schneider's Marbles project, Eleventh Dream Day, Lisa Germano, Matthew Sweet,
    and Howe Gelb all contribute tracks built on his lyrics.</p><p>
    Generally, the artists are well-suited to the material,
    though Reed's songwriting tends to lean heavily on the easy rhyme, a
    trait that becomes noticeable over the course of the album. Reed also allows
    the artists to stick to their respective sounds, so the Clientele's too-brief song plays like it could easily have fallen off one of their LPs, and Matthew
    Sweet digs his husky voice into fuzzy power-pop that recalls his early
    90s output more than anything he's done recently. A couple of tracks do hint at
    the film's circus elements: Tullycraft's ""The Girl Who's Above Us"" has a
    staggering waltz feel backed with a couple accordions, while Howe Gelb goes
    more for the scary clown angle on the 54-second spoken word/noise track ""Falling
    in Love"".
    </p>
<p>
    Thing is, none of this material is all that exceptional-- Communiqué's
    ""Way to Walk"", for instance, is a carefully crafted indie rock could-be anthem that
    never quite breaks out into that huge chorus it's reaching for. ""I Only Want
    the Sky"", arranged and sung by Michael Leviton, pokes along without much of a
    melody, and as gamely as Doug Martsch tries to fill ""Cracked and Crazed"" with
    the natural ache that suffuses his own work, the song doesn't give him a whole
    lot to work with.<em> Songs From the Bigtop</em>
    is an interesting project, and the contributions of each artist will be attractive to their fans, but on the whole the
    disc feels scattered and devoid of any standouts.

    Bradford Cox spent the summer he was 16 in a children's hospital having multiple surgeries on his chest and back. His condition, Marfan syndrome, has proven difficult to separate from his music. Cox's lost summer hangs over his songs, and his gawky physique has been the dress-draped centerpiece of his band's confrontational live shows. At the same time, he can also be defensive about his appearance, using it to explain why his music's detractors are sometimes as hyperbolic as his most fervent admirers. Thousands of words later, other music critics still ask me what I could possibly like in Cox's work.</p><p>
    Cox plays and sings in Atlanta five-piece Deerhunter, but it's tempting to say he actually lives as Atlas Sound. He's used the name for his solo recordings ever since the sixth grade, and lately his output has been almost nonstop: He's posted roughly 70 new tracks, mostly originals, on his <a href=""http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>blog</strong></a> since last July. Deerhunter's <em>Cryptograms</em> and <em>Fluorescent Grey</em> EP expertly brought together elements of krautrock, psych, shoegaze, ambient, post-punk, and indie rock, but Atlas Sound's full-length debut turns inward from that band's high-volume squall. Cox also trades the four-track of previous Atlas Sound vinyl splits for a laptop. The result is a gauzy bedroom pop album that drifts from ambient bliss-outs to sadsack avant-garage, from hospitals to heartache, as if passing through different stages of sleep on a sunny afternoon. No previous interest in Deerhunter required.</p><p>
    Cox spent the summer he was 25 touring and recording <em>Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel</em>. But the fears of nine years earlier stalk the album's corridors. Opener ""A Ghost Story"" sets a hissy sample of a young boy clumsily narrating over the fluorescent hum of treated, sampled glockenspiel. Childhood innocence gives way to to adolescent confusion on the waltz-like ""Recent Bedroom"", as a music box crashes headlong into squiggly guitars and bustling percussion. A Zimbabwean instrument called a mbira and some bells from Ghana waft through guitars and collaged drums on ""Quarantined"", a song that evokes both children's hospitals and a sense of unresolved metamorphosis: ""I am waiting to be changed.""
    </p>
<p>
    By the time of his summer in the hospital, Cox had already met Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, to whom he dedicated this album. A sample of Pundt's slender, bouncing guitar lick forms the basis of seventh cut ""Cold as Ice"", the way a Flamingos or Lionel Richie snippet might become a track by the Field, although Cox adds his own frail tenor and jangling tambourine along with a driving beat. The first half of the album watches the world from afar, but from here on, Cox's narrator directly addresses an unattainable love interest.
    </p>
<p>
    The difference between the album's halves is clear from just its catchiest few songs. On what would be side A, the clipped drum rolls and treated harps of ""River Card"" can't make the object of Cox's doomed whispers (""River so clear and blue/ I'm so in love with you/ But you'll drown me"") any easier to hold, just as the narrator can't cry on ""Recent Bedroom"", see his friends on ""Quarantined"", or make friends at all on ""On Guard"". Near the end of the album, though, the guitar-driven, spring reverb-drenched ""Ativan"" goes into bitterly specific detail about sleeping in while a person has ""lunch with a girl/ who takes time to listen to every single word you utter."" Two tracks earlier, ""Bite Marks"" describes self-inflicted scars-- not surgical ones-- as two guitar notes drone and buzz. Weezer's ""Only in Dreams"" probably isn't the comparison Cox would pick for his achingly nostalgic bass line, but then again, the title fits.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Let the Blind</em>'s beauty is in the way the music renders Cox's plaintive themes, not in the impressionistic language he chooses to express them. The closing, instrumental title track returns to the glockenspiels from opener ""A Ghost Story"", joined by organ and mbira for a flickering, look-ma-no-drums ambient piece recalling the ""pop ambient"" of Kompakt's Gas and Markus Guentner or the psychedelic electronic space-outs of the Orb; wordless ""Ready, Set, Glow"" achieves something similar with nylon-string strums, shakers, glockenspiel, and Cox's own sampled vocals. Later, ""After Class"" reshapes Deerhunter's contribution to the recent <em>Living Bridge</em> compilation into another lyric-less track that builds up nicely to ""Ativan"", like a skilled DJ keeping the room on edge before a climactic break. Out of context, it's the least essential thing here, but it seems significant that the original's coda (""Strip down, strip down"") implies a release this album's lovelorn central figure never finds.
    </p>
<p>
    When there are words, they're often simple and repetitive, or else overshadowed by the lush sonics. The chiming prettiness and misty vocals of Kraftwerk via <em>Ralf &amp; Florian</em>'s ""Tanzmusik"" help set the template for more than a couple of tracks on <em>Let the Blind</em>, including the terse, jittery ""On Guard"". Brooklyn-via-Detroit techno-pop savant Matthew Dear would probably give up one of his pseudonyms for the way ""Winter Vacation"" merges glistening, euphoric pop with a minimal techno beat. Music boxes no longer sound so innocent on the clanging, alarm-like ""Scraping Past"", the track that will interrupt your reverie.
    </p>
<p>
    Then again, the <em>last</em> thing you'll notice about ""Small Horror"" is the lyrics, but they're naked, a little naïve, and utterly human. Nothing but droning, treated guitar and Cox's crying, defeated voice, the track is a desperate plea that finds a certain hymn-like exaltation in its own sadness. ""Hold me even though you couldn't care less,"" Cox murmurs slowly.
    </p>
<p>
    ""I woke up,"" Cox sings on both <em>Cryptograms</em> and <em>Fluorescent Grey</em>. Atlas Sound's debut ends with the protagonist going back to sleep, the dreamer dreaming. As with each of Cox's projects, <em>Let the Blind</em> works best as a swirling, disorienting whole, organizing traditionally abstract styles like graphic-design elements within his unifying vision until they communicate like good pop. If <em>Cryptograms</em> was a puzzle, Cox's latest is a cocoon. Strange as it may seem to admit, how much time you choose to spend in it could depend on how you react to Cox's persona. Those drawn to his lovesick, evolving audio presence have, like Morrissey or Belle &amp; Sebastian obsessives, an entire world to explore. Hell, none of these 14 tracks are even on the blog.

""The Johnny Cash Show"" was shuffled in as a summer replacement for another song-and-skit show, ""The Hollywood Palace"", and featured Cash and his touring company: His wife June Carter, various members of the Carter Family, Carl Perkins, the Tennessee Three, the Statler Brothers, and a series of rotating guest stars (beginning, rather auspiciously, with the camera-loving Bob Dylan). Each of its 58 episodes were shot before a live audience in Nashville's legendary Ryman Auditorium, the former home of the Grand Ole Opry. It was the first network television show ever produced out of Nashville.</p><p>
    At the time, Cash was hitting his popular and personal apex: <em>At Folsom Prison</em> had enjoyed a remarkable 92-week run on the pop charts, a Grammy (Best Male Country Vocal) gleamed on his mantle, he was newly married, he was sober and devout. Johnny Cash was a rehabilitated outlaw, a Christian, a husband, a real, earnest American. And for home viewers in 1969, Cash was a welcome antidote to flag-draped coffins.</p><p>
    A 2xDVD best-of featuring 66 of the show's musical performances was released in September; the punctuated CD version features 16 songs, including nine that didn't make the cut for the DVDs. <em>The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show</em> is a remarkable collection, featuring live performances by Cash's country peers (Waylon Jennings, Bobby Bare, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Kris Kristofferson) and, perhaps more compellingly, tracks from folk, pop, and rock superstars (Ray Charles, Joni Mitchell, Roy Orbison, Derek and the Dominoes). The CD's production is impressively fluid, given the source material (8-track reels operating at half-capacity, recorded from scattershot stage mics), and was lovingly remixed and remastered after the tapes were pulled from Cash's personal vault.  </p><p>
    Some of the best bits include the pre-song banter-- before Waylon Jennings performs ""Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"", the former roommates rib each other gently: ""He was my cook,"" Jennings explains. ""Can you imagine Johnny Cash in a black suit with baking powder all the way down and gravy in the hair?"" ""I was a good cook,"" Cash retorts. ""You couldn't do nothing."" Ray Charles' rich, sultry rendition of ""Ring of Fire"" is stunning, riddled with organ, piano, and brash horns; Charles' transforms the song from an obtuse acoustic tale into high drama. Joni Mitchell duets with Cash on ""Girl From the North Country"" (ironically, the same song Dylan performed for the show's opening night), while Cash and Lynn Anderson kick out a sprightly version of Geoff Mack's ""I've Been Everywhere"". Still, Cash's rendition of Carl Perkins' ""Daddy Sang Bass"" is the record's highlight. The track, which, occasionally dips into the Carter Family's legendary ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken?"", works as a parable for the entire two-season run of ""The Johnny Cash Show"", with Cash intoning: ""We'd get together in a family circle, singing loud/ Daddy sang bass, Momma sang tenor/ And me and little brother would join right in there/ Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul."" </p><p>
    Although anyone who's checked out the DVDs will find themselves maniacally restructuring the track list (it's not hard to assume that the label wanted a hook to get fans to buy both documents, padding the CD with a handful of second-tier, if still outstanding, cuts), <em>The Best of the Johnny Cash Show</em> is still a tough testament to the grand fluidity of American music. Cash acted as a perfect conduit for cross-genre pollination, and the class, race, gender, and regional divisions that plagued America in the late 1960s are rendered perfectly irrelevant here.</p></div>"|11191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11191-the-best-of-the-johnny-cash-tv-show-1969-1971/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

It's a little slip of paper folded around the spine of the CD case on which the price and CD information are printed, and it's highly sought after by collectors to prove the authenticity of their import purchases. Obi strips often include marketing phrases, similar to the shrink-wrap sticker you see in the States and elsewhere, that can offer intriguing Japanese descriptions for music that so often has to haltingly speak for itself to the Western world. On <em>Suuto Breakor</em>, Osaka girl duo Afrirampo's newest disc, the message is pretty clear, if roughly translated: ""Forty-plus minute long trip song! In the lost forest, the swirling comet appears! Hey everyone, come play in the same forest as Afrirampo!""</p><p>
    This zany missive is sort of a statement of purpose for the twentysomething pair Oni and Pikachu, who have become famous thanks to a mixture of humorous noise and dangerous chaos. The girls have played varying shades of old-school Borebox-inspired ""idiot-rock"" since their inception in 2002, their guitar and drums enduring heavy punishment and their voices rising to banshee level and then to whisper in a breath-beat. Their eccentric, batshit-crazy ramblings have attracted such fans as Acid Mothers Temple, who has recorded with Afrirampo multiple times, as well the Boredoms, Sonic Youth, and Lighting Bolt, who have all taken the girls out on tour.</p><p>
    As mentioned, <em>Suuto Breakor</em> is basically one 42-minute song, but it's broken into seven discrete parts. As ""1"" skitters to a start, it seems business as usual for Oni and Pikachu, drunken slide guitar entering with nonverbal chants from the girls. But somehow the pair end up settling down into a more centered kind of groove than they've really ever played before. By the time ""2"" enters the picture, it's clear that <em>Suuto Breakor</em> tempers the loose, fierce, and generally chaotic noise-mongering by piercing into melodic spaces reminiscent of their contemporaries OOIOO.  </p><p>
<em>Suuto Breakor</em> is an especially tuneful record; it might also be their most focused. At no point do the girls scream at the top of their lungs, and only briefly does Pikachu bash on the drums, as she is prone to do, as hard as she fucking can. Between the serenely arpeggiated guitar of ""5"" and the spare jungle drums of ""2"" (accompanied by some <em>Seadrum</em>-esque piano), Oni manages to actually communicate a fully-formed melody. The climax of the CD is found on tracks six and seven, where the girls establish a sing-song melody that rises and falls to a sweet little guitar riff. </p><p>
    Interviews with the pair are always a little baffling. The girls tend to act a bit off-the-wall and salty to interviewers, (Q: ""What are your hobbies?"" A: ""DRINKING""), but they also front this ineffable sincerity towards their music, and seem to practice some form of feel-good feminism (""Woman never die!!""). Oni and Pika seem determined to keep any questions of their values, even their actual humanity, at arm's length. But it's certain that whatever random forest they managed to land in, whichever backwoods tract they've managed to spiral down into, it really wouldn't be a bad idea to track out there and learn a bit about whatever random-ass philosophical truths they've obviously already figured out and serenely communicate on this album.</p></div>"|11133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11133-suuto-breakor/|7.5|Mike Orme

But if we are going to appropriate the name of a debilitating mental disorder simply to quantify an artist's musical whims, best to apply it to a band that actually sounds like two split personalities fighting for control over the same vessel, where the songs share a certain elemental consistency but behave in markedly different ways. By that measure, San Francisco trio 60 Watt Kid are certifiably schizo.</p><p>
    Every song on the band's debut utilizes the same rudiments-- reverbed guitar ripples, distorted organ drones, spare tambourine-rattled rhythms and frontman Kevin Litrow's mantric incantations-- but their interaction produces two distinct outcomes: serene, psychedelic reveries and sleazy garage skronk. Litrow is at least self-aware enough to recognize his band's internal contradictions; as he sings at the outset of one song: ""I've been thinking of things that confuse me."" But it's this very sense of bewilderment that keeps you intrigued even throughout this lengthy, 14-song debut's more ponderous passages, to see if 60 Watt Kid's dichotomous dispositions eventually work toward a peaceful reconciliation.</p><p>
    And peace does seem to be the end goal here, if the album's best and most fully realized song is anything to go by: The eight-minute ""Ocsicnarf Nas"" is a marvel of sustained, slow-release euphoria, its glistening guitar trembles and tribal drum builds working together to send Litrow's indecipherably echo-drenched vocals skyward in triumph. But the song's entrancing effect is immediately shattered by the first installment of the two-part ""American Standard"", an excerpt from what sounds like an endless ""Sister Ray""-style organ grind, wherein Litrow assumes the megaphoned voice of a mad auctioneer barker. It's a pattern that repeats itself throughout the album's duration: ""Chem Trials""-- a similarly styled and, as such, somewhat less striking companion to ""Ocsicnarf Nas""-- is rudely up-ended by the broke-down blues of ""Need a Job"", which sounds like something Jon Spencer might sing to himself in the welfare line, complete with affected fat-Elvis drawl; the lighter-waving Floydian psych-folk anthem ""The Road"" works itself up into a cacophonous freak-out to set up the throat-shredding, ""96 Tears"" garage-slop of ""I Got Money"". </p><p>
    Perhaps these jarring juxtapositions are 60 Watt Kid's comment on modern life, where dreams of escape are inevitably undermined by the harsh, day-to-day realities of trying to make rent. Or maybe they simply can't figure out if they want to be Animal Collective or the Blues Explosion. But the album's conclusion suggests they may not have to make a decision: Following a suitably sodden last-call shanty called ""The End of the War"", 60 Watt Kid get on with peace process, in the form of a hidden-track instrumental jam that finds the band's dreamy organ swirls and gutter-blues grittiness coalescing into a steady, motorik motion-- one that proves the difference between 60 Watt Kid's split personalities is really just a function of whether they're taking bong hits in the basement or gas-huffing in the garage.</p></div>"|11131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11131-60-watt-kid/|6.9|Stuart Berman

    For a guy who can count five records of unapologetic sad-sacking to his name, Canadian husky Paul Hayden Desser sure has a cumbersome time with his chosen subject matter on <em>In Field &amp; Town</em>, an album primarily concerned with-- nope, no surprises here-- a failed relationship. The snag: While past releases allowed Hayden to hang his hat on the fresh embers of harsh breaks, or the occasional song about Alan Balling for a sixteen-year-old, the mostly-yawn greys of the doomed romance he eulogizes here don't offer much in the way of inspiration.</p><p>
    ""Take it easy, it's what we need to do now,"" Desser sings on the album-opening title track. What he means, of course, is a break. And considering the even-keeled delivery, and the songs that follow, nobody seems to argue with his reasoning. Which is either fodder for an interesting look at the death knell of a relationship, or the making of a totally boring break-up record. Hint: it's the latter. Hayden's depiction of restless bedmates (""The Hardest Part""), lying just to get caught (""Did I Wake Up Beside You?""), and oops, we-made-a-mistake incongruity (""More Than Alive"") ring hollow throughout. So, understandably, the only song that doesn't focus on romance is the strongest. ""Lonely Security Guard"", a narrative about underestimating an origami-loving rent-a-cop (no, really), acts mostly like ""Bass Song Part 2"", complete with the line ""so I grabbed the first thing that I saw,"" and a protagonist who spends at least part of the run-time laid out on the floor.</p><p>
    Musically, <em>In Field &amp; Town</em> often eschews the proven strength of Desser-plus-guitar(-plus-harmonica) for sagging, if competently arranged, flesh-outs. ""Worthy of Your Esteem"" is a whirring synth-led pulse not far from the stuff Dave Bazan filled his last Pedro The Lion record with. Meanwhile, ""Where and When"" is a scuttling guitar strum set against insistent drums, and big, uncharacteristically prominent bass hustle. Sure, he's dabbled in this territory before, only with much more compelling material to back it up.
    </p>
<p>
    Even when the album plays to Desser's strong suits, exemplified in the short, sweetness of piano-led ""The Hardest Part"", it's not enough to overcome the prevailing semi-felt-ness of the thing. Such a problem that it curses the moments Desser actually dares to go for it, leaving his most diary-page lyrics seeming, at best, brash, and at worst, unbelievable. ""I'm going to miss how bad this has felt,"" he sings on ""Damn This Feeling"". Nu-uh. On another record, it would seem old hat. Here, too left-field not to peg as melodrama. And that's the problem: after years of high highs and lower lows, such a flatline seems, well, pretty boring.

    The Mountain Goats' John Darnielle has written songs about speed-freaks, drug-dealing high school running backs, short-time jail inmates, big rabbits, debt collectors, garden-seed salesmen, bootleggers, alcoholics, and attic-dwellers.  In the whole lot, the only honest man Darnielle ever bothered writing about was himself.  <em>We Shall All Be Healed</em>, <em>The Sunset Tree</em>, and <em>Get Lonely</em>-- his last three albums-- were the autobiographical invocations he'd staved off for over a decade and some 400 songs. Since 2004, he's been his own only subject, after 12 years of avoiding a biography full of sharp objects.  ""As you all know,"" Darnielle used to say from stage, ""I don't write songs about myself.""</p><p>
    On <em>Heretic Pride</em>, his newest, the ""I"" is once again someone else: hopeless urchins, spies from China, a girl in a Marduk t-shirt, a young father, a kid in a Marcus Allen jersey, H.P. Lovecraft in Brooklyn, a reggae singer with a bullet hole in his chest.  The antic, hammering thrum of the Mountain Goats' tape-grind era-- before the finer arrangements, the ornamentation, the orchestration of the band's first four 4AD releases-- returns.  As before, John Vanderslice and Scott Solter produce.  Old usual suspects Peter Hughes, Franklin Bruno, and the Bright Mountain Choir are re-enlisted. St. Vincent's Annie Clark, Erik Friedlander, and Superchunk's Jon Wurster are sworn in.  Darnielle wrote songs in Fairbanks, Seattle, San Franscisco, and Durham; their subjects stray as far as the Xinjiang Province, Spanish Town, East Berlin.</p><p>
    Darnielle's characters are back where they know best.  They join cults (""New Zion""), huddle together in cars (""So Desperate"") or gather in smoke-filled rooms (""In the Craters of the Moon"").  Many do not survive.  ""Spoiler Alert!"" reads the characteristically bombastic liner note to ""Heretic Pride"": ""The main character here will not live long after he gets done lauding his imminent demise.""</p><p>
    What a difference two years makes.  <em>Get Lonely</em> (2006) was a agonizingly introspective dissection of a dissolving relationship, the logical finale to Darnielle's trilogy of self-revelation, the final unburdening. The Mountain Goats-- champions of the low-fi, singer-songwriter-subverters-- had become scrupulously hi-fi, confessional.  Gone was the guitar that played its own drums, gone was the tape-hiss, gone were the doctrinaire fans. Only you and Darnielle remained.  ""When the villagers come to my door,"" he sang on <em>Get Lonely</em>'s ""If You See Light"", ""I will hide underneath the table in the dining room, knees drawn up to my chest.""  On <em>Heretic Pride</em>, the villagers return to find their victim no longer afraid.</p><p>
    ""They come and pull me from my house, and they drag my body through the streets"" declares Darnielle on ""Heretic Pride"": ""I will feel so proud when the reckoning arrives.""  Of all the musicians that have come and gone in the 4AD era, Superchunk's Jon Wurster is-- Peter Hughes aside-- the first to hear, and replicate, the precise, surging, and teeth-chattering headlong rhythm that is Darnielle's stock-in-trade. Behind Wurster's ""high-spirits-on-fire"" (Darnielle's phrase) four-four, ""Heretic Pride"" is the most immediate thing the Mountain Goats have done since ""The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton"".  Elsewhere, ""Sax Rohmer #1"", ""In the Craters of the Moon"", and ""Lovecraft in Brooklyn"" are seething throwbacks-- taut, propulsive, paranoid, furious.  ""Lovecraft"" imagines the writer come to Red Hook, xenophobic, terrified, filled with hate, switchblade in hand.  ""Someday, something's coming from way out beyond the stars,"" snarls Darnielle. ""To kill us while we stand here."" </p><p>
    ""San Bernadino"": the paranoia relents, the sun rises over the mountains, a young couple with a son on the way checks into a motel; the father runs a bath, scatters rose petals into the water. Composer Erik Friedlander provides the sole instrumentation, a humming cello pluck and a smeared, gorgeous chord progression.  <em>Heretic Pride</em> is the first since <em>The Coroner's Gambit</em> to lack a unifying concept, but it has balance: For every furious declaration, there's a moment of uncertainty-- the unresolved lovers and muted chords of ""How to Embrace a Swamp Creature"", the neutral meeting place the two estranged people pick to reconcile in ""So Desperate"".
    </p>
<p>
    As in most of the post-<em>Tallahassee</em> Mountain Goats material, Darnielle's <em>Heretic Pride</em> writing tends towards themes rather than details, movements rather than moments.  But human beings stride through his songs once again; for every broad-stroke metaphor-- ""Autoclave"" heart-as-surgical-purifier, ""Tianchi Lake"" swamp-monster-- there's a ""Marduk Men's Room Incident"" disco-refugee, her head against the sink, trying to cool down.</p><p>
<em>Heretic Pride</em>'s title is lifted from an Aura Noir's ""Black Deluge Night""-- ""Soaring demons now swarm the skies/ In awe and heretic pride,"" goes the couplet-- but Darnielle's got his own invasion stories. <em>Sunset Tree</em> outtake ""The Day the Aliens Came"" imagined a smoldering planet, rooftops and sidewalks ""melted like plastic,"" one man still standing: There's Darnielle, wearing Italian shoes and a white tuxedo jacket, a survivor explaining himself for the sake of the rest of us.

These images are perfectly considered, down to the facial hair stylings and thematically appropriate guitars-- but Lowe comes off goofy and unconvincing in every guise.  The cover images are apt not for their evocation of ""cool,"" but rather for their combination of impeccable artifice and raw, gawkish charm. Indeed, <em>Jesus of Cool</em> sounds more like the work of a crafty fan than that of a self-serious auteur.</p><p>
    Thankfully, Lowe's fandom was quite broad; <em>Jesus of Cool</em> is equal parts shimmering disco and dingy pub, with frequent surprisingly coherent stylistic asides.  That this record came out in 1978 is nothing short of a small miracle; while punk rock and disco were battling it out in an all-too-familiar dialogue of authenticity and reactionism, Lowe cut the crap and made a clever, fierce, and far-reaching record.  Chalk it up, perhaps, to the degree and nature of Lowe's experience; by the time he set about recording <em>Jesus of Cool</em>, Lowe was already a veteran of the decidedly more populist pub rock scene.</p><p>
    Though <em>Jesus of Cool</em> is technically his debut, Lowe was already the elder statesman and in-house producer for the fledgling Stiff Label, positioning himself as the clever and detached pop craftsman to protégé Elvis Costello's angsty, spittle-flecked firebrand.  Fans of Costello's early records, or those of the Damned, will find the sonics of <em>Jesus of Cool</em> immediately familiar.  Recorded largely on borrowed studio time at a variety of locations, <em>Jesus of Cool</em> covers a lot of ground fidelity-wise, but is aptly produced throughout.  The album's more polished cuts are studio-immaculate, and its rockers are gritty and packed full of energy, demonstrating the production style that earned Lowe the nickname ""Basher"".  </p><p>
    Lowe certainly knew well enough to avoid trying to make a straight-up pandering pop record, and his experience in the record business is written all over <em>Jesus of Cool</em>, in the words of songs like ""Music for Money"" and ""Shake and Pop"", and in the album's overall feel and conceit. These flip-offs at the record industry underscore the album's unerring ease and strength.  Perhaps Lowe's deep familiarity with the ins and outs of the business cured him of the something-to-prove overzealousness that kills many records this ambitious.  Indeed, <em>Jesus of Cool</em> comes across with little to no agenda; it draws from a wide and diverse pool of influences, but never in a way that seems showy or forced.</p><p>
    Backed by an all-star cast of friends and contemporaries, many of whom shared time with Lowe in pub rock legends Brinsley Schwarz, Lowe tries on many different vocal personas on <em>Jesus</em>, cooing the ballad ""Tonight""  and barking the new wave stomper ""Music for Money"". Early singles ""So It Goes"" and ""I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass"" are highlights, remarkable for both their strength and for their disparity.  ""So It Goes"" is driving, chiming melodic rock, while ""I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass"" is piano-tickled disco-pop. The diversity of <em>Jesus of Cool</em> helps keep even its weaker tracks sounding unique and interesting; the slightly reggae-toned ""No Reason"" and dark, synthesized ""36 Inches High"" would be distracting detours on a more myopic record, but make perfect sense in this context.</p><p>
<em>Jesus of Cool</em> has been sadly out of print for years, and Yep Roc's reissue is impeccable. The complex digipak fold-out is beautiful, and Will Birch's liner notes do a great job of explaining the record's origins without falling into hyperbole.  The bonus tracks here are generally quite good as well, not surprising considering the singles-y feel of the album itself.  ""Rollers Show"" and ""They Called It Rock"" (a reworking of ""Shake and Pop"" that lacks the album cut's gritty force) were both included on the U.S. release of <em>Jesus of Cool</em> (retitled <em>Pure Pop for Now People</em> for more sensitive U.S. audiences), and their inclusion here is welcome.  Other highlights include an early version of Lowe's sole U.S. hit ""Cruel to be Kind"", the hilarious ""I Love My Label"", and a cover of Martha Sharp's ""Born a Woman"" from 1977's <em>The Bowi EP</em>.</p><p>
    As guitar pop music comes back into fashion among indie rockers, more and more albums are sounding like awkward and self-aware approximations of the very thing that <em>Jesus of Cool</em> does so effortlessly. In a sense, Lowe's unpretentious inclusiveness may have stopped <em>Jesus of Cool</em> just short of becoming a huge record in any one world; the album is far too unabashedly admiring of pop music to be seen as a punk rock classic, but too gritty and ramshackle to be considered a seminal new wave pop record. Thankfully, <em>Jesus of Cool</em> is a rarer thing still: a timeless and bullshit-free masterpiece.<br/></p></div>"|11183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11183-jesus-of-cool/|9.3|Matt LeMay

    On their past two releases, Scotland's Sons &amp; Daughters
    staked out a unique sound built around tense rhythm, static harmony, hints of
    Scottish folk, and strong male/female spoken/sung vocal interplay. On <em>This Gift</em>, they give back a bit of that distinctive ground, more frequently
    adopting a more conventional rock approach, while Adele Bethel moves into more
    of a frontwoman role, taking nearly every note of lead vocals. Scott Paterson,
    who once played deadpan foil to Bethel
    with his dry lead vocals, is now mostly focused on the guitar and backing
    vocals. This doesn't compromise the band's quality much, though-- it just gives
    them a somewhat different look that's backed up by slightly brighter production from ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler.</p><p>
    In fact, I'd say that if anything, re-structuring their
    approach has given them a bit more songwriting leeway, and this album has
    bigger choruses and better riffs than its predecessor, 2006's <em>Repulsion Box</em>. One thing it
    doesn't have, though, is any kind of lower gear-- the band is pretty much all-out
    the whole way, which can be a little tiring. Even places where they let you think they're dialing
    back, like the wispy, piano-backed intro to ""Split Lips"", soon give way to fast
    tempos led by David Gow's aggressive drums.</p><p>
    While they've given up some of the folk dual lead elements
    that were once their calling cards, they have hit on a unique way of adding
    memorable choruses to their songs, augmenting the chorus lyrics with big,
    melodic phrases built around simple words like ""yeah"" or non-words like ""oh""
    and ""ah."" It sounds simple, but they make some huge hooks harmonizing on ""oohs""
    and ""aahs."" These bigger hooks play into the overall streamlining of their
    sound, and it's not hard to imagine a few of these songs crossing over.
    ""Darling"" has a bit of a ""Town Called Malice"" feel to it (albeit at a much
    higher tempo), with Bethel's
    layered vocals creating the band's poppiest texture yet. 
    </p>
<p>
    The band wraps it up with one of its best songs yet, the
    fuzzed-out rocker ""Goodbye Service"", which backs Bethel up with little falsetto
    harmonies and makes the most out of the sour tone of Paterson's guitar-- it's
    like a harder update on something that could have come out of Boston in 1968,
    and there's even a psychedelic breakdown. It's a good closer for such a loud
    and propulsive album, an LP that finds the band no worse for the wear after
    modifying its sound to go more directly for the jugular. The biggest critique
    is that as an album, <em>This Gift</em> is
    perhaps too far in the red too much of the time, but even that complaint is
    tempered by the fact that the ride is so good.

    but Bob Mould has fully made the transition to shiny, happy, gay man. 
    Anyone who reads his <a href=""http://modulate.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>blog</strong></a> knows that the 47-year-old 
    legend spends his days working out, writing music, and enjoying the benefits 
    of being comfortably out in Washington D.C.'s gay community. Though 
    you may prefer to remember him shredding on the First Avenue stage with 
    Hüsker Dü, he looks back on that time without much pleasure. In fact, 
    in commemoration of the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the band's 
    dissolution, he recently posted his resignation letter, with commentary: 
    ""Freedom, sweet freedom! One of my best decisions ever. The end of 
    one trip, the beginning of an amazing journey."" Though he's resumed playing electric guitar on tour, for five years one of his main gigs has been running a D.C. 
    dance event called Blowoff, which expanded to New York last year. (He 
    recently described it as a ""really sexy party"" to a D.C. gay magazine.) 
    Long reticent to make details of his private life public, Mould has 
    opened up and is finally happy.</p><p>
    So, what does this mean for 
    his music? Unfortunately, on <em>District Line </em>
    he has largely abandoned the snappy, acerbic poetry that characterized 
    the first decades of his catalog in favor of rambling journal entries. 
    ""The shape shifting, weightlifting,"" he sings on the chorus-less 
    ""Who Needs To Dream?"" ""Hope the presentation will catch his eye/ 
    And it did, and then he saw the string/ He grabbed it and leads you 
    on your leash/ You offered it up/ So don't blame anyone but yourself."" 
    Angsty-sounding song titles like ""Return to Dust"" betray Hallmark 
    sentiments: ""True blue star/ Would you stay in my heart/ Or will you 
    fool me once again?"" ""Old Highs, New Lows""'s lyrics seem lifted 
    from a note passed between junior high students: ""We lock the gaze 
    tightly upon each other/ No others come near, no others come between.""</p><p>
    That said, Fugazi drummer Brendan 
    Canty is again along for the ride, and <em>District Line</em> hits all 
    the right rock touchstones. The tempered, driving guitar bliss of ""Return to Dust"" sounds like a <em>File Under Easy Listening </em>
    outtake, while ""Walls In Time""-- the album's six-minute, acoustic, 
    heart-on-sleeve closer-- actually <em>is</em> a <em>Workbook</em> outtake. 
    Meanwhile, ""Stupid Now"" is that head-banging jock-jam Mould's 
    fans have been craving during his poison, er, electronic years. Indeed, 
    much of the club music influence that informed <em>Modulate</em><em> </em>
    and <em>Long Playing Grooves</em> has been eliminated here, although 
    there are hints of vocoder and snippets of synth. Like Mould's previous 
    disc, <em>Body of Song</em>, <em>District Line</em> contains one out-and-out 
    dance track, ""Shelter Me"", which could be described as a great club 
    track for people who don't like going to clubs.
    </p><p>
    If only Mould weren't so 
    gosh-dang happy, this might be an essential album. It's not that it 
    lacks tension -- indeed, almost every song touches on relationship strife-- it's just that the squabbles are gentle, the rage subdued. ""Watch 
    me walk the ledge, I am comfortable out here by myself,"" he sings 
    on ""Again and Again"". Sure, he's contemplating suicide, but he's <em>
    comfortable</em> doing it. Sheesh.

The record seems mindfully considered with proper (if not particularly hip) sonic touchstones in mind, and it's easy to imagine Kelley Stoltz laying down the clip-clop percussion to the loping ballad ""Gardenia"" with a mile-wide grin after his thousandth listen of <em>Pet Sounds</em>.   Whether politely rocking out or spinning something pastoral, <em>Circular Sounds</em> manages to come across as casual without seeming tossed-off.  If could all sound good on the radio, even if you know that particular station exists in an alternate universe and probably switched over to reggaeton in 2006.</p><p>
    You have to wonder why Stoltz insists on the innocuously self-centered act of putting his own name on his records when he's spent so much of his time trying to be someone else, whether it's Jeff Buckley (answering fan mail as one of his interns), Ian McCulloch (covering <em>Crocodiles</em> in its entirety), or a cavalcade of 60s icons (his last LP, <em>Below the Branches</em>). Even the tracks that can remotely be considered contemporary still
    conjure bands steeped in canon, as in the figure 8s of Elliott Smith
    guitar work (""Tintinnabulation"") or Spoon's brassy r(y)hthm and soul on
    the grating character study ""The Birmingham Eccentric"".</p><p>
    Stoltz jokingly described the step up in production on <em>Circular Sounds</em> as ""mid-fi,"" about right for someone who sounds like his home studio is overrun with every instrument he's ever come across except a computer.  ""Everything Begins"" scampers about with woozy horns and piano, as welcoming as it is disorienting.  More than last time, the album's got enough meat and gristle during the midsection to avoid the thing being swallowed whole.  The pre-disco string hits of ""Your Reverie"" are his canniest production trick yet and ""When You Forget"" supplements its vocal melodies with ringing guitar lines that avoid becoming flavorless.</p><p>
    Yet the sum of <em>Circular Sounds</em> can feel impersonal, especially in how Stoltz hopscotches from voice to voice, some far stronger than others-- he doesn't have near the range to pull off the high notes on the village green waltz of ""Mother Nature"".  ""Put My Troubles To Sleep"", a ""what if?"" proposition of Damon Albarn covering Graham Coxon, finds Stoltz trying to cope with an empty bed with everything from tequila to counting sheep. But its impact is dulled by a fussy music hall chord progression that makes everything feel preordained instead of inspired.  Even the catchiest numbers derive their impact more from earworm repetition than any sort of pristine melodic architecture.  ""To Speak to the Girl"" will wind around your brain in the same manner it's composed, as in a continuous, nagging loop of the title.</p><p>
    Waffling on Stoltz begs the question, ""What would happen if he decides to scuff his treasured record collection with some of his own grooves?""  2007 was a great year for guys who channeled the 60s into a personal vision, but Caribou and Panda Bear did it from the mindframe of electronic music, whereas Stoltz is strictly a singer-songwriter.  Desiring a Kelley Stoltz record with no outside artistic guidance is to wish for something that probably doesn't exist, so once again <em>Circular Sounds</em> renders Stoltz a non-entity, subject to your expectations alone.</p></div>"|11137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11137-circular-sounds/|6.7|Ian Cohen

<em>Thriller</em> is the biggest-selling album of all time; it says so on the cover of this reissue package. What it doesn't say is that, on a worldwide scale, it outpaces the Eagles, Pink Floyd, and Celine Dion by more than just a marginal million or so: At 100 million+ copies sold, it's estimated to have sold more than twice its nearest rival.</p><p>
    And so people try to concoct explanations. The album was focus-grouped for broader appeal-- but then why haven't focus groups worked so well since? Jackson made the racial crossover breakthrough on MTV-- but once that door was opened, why didn't the sales crossover work for others? Jackson's stunning dancing and videos exploded pop's visual formatting-- but the <em>Thriller</em> album, until DVD-era reissues like this one, wasn't a visual experience.</p><p>
    When <em>Thriller</em> opens, those 100 million sales feel just. ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" is pure confused, shocked teenage rush. So there's another theory: <em>Thriller</em> is the best-selling record ever because it's the best record ever. That one holds up for six minutes and two seconds, during which Jackson and Quincy Jones mix the tension of rock'n'roll with the rapture of disco and hit perfection. But then you get ""Baby Be Mine""-- one of the original tracks that wasn't a single-- and the momentum fades: On the heels of ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"", it should maintain the temperature; instead, it   goes nowhere, starts nothing.</p><p>
<em>Thriller</em> is inconsistent in style, which gives it something to appeal to everyone, but it's oddly tough to listen to even the great bits sequentially-- its peaks are from different mountain ranges. ""Thriller""'s joke-shop horror segues well into Eddie Van Halen's headbanging guitar on ""Beat It"". But to follow that into the paranoid celebrity funk of ""Billie Jean"", the meltingly tender ""Human Nature"", and the smooth R&amp;B of ""P.Y.T.""? These are all brilliant singles, though; <em>Thriller</em>'s greatness lies in its great songs not in it ""working like an album.""  </p><p>
    For this edition Jackson's called in some current big guns to provide remixes, and sadly they do provide the consistency the originals gloriously lack. Will.i.am sets the tone: He takes Macca off ""The Girl Is Mine"" but decides it can't work without someone sounding like an idiot and steps manfully in himself. There's a general reluctance to use what these guest stars are good at: will.I.am is a consistently slick, inventive pop producer but nobody wants to hear him rap, whereas on Kanye West's ""Billie Jean"" a guest verse might have added dynamics to the mix's clumsy claustrophobia. Fergie's gift as a pop star is the way her crassness shifts into oddness-- so on ""Beat It"" her nervous reverence is a waste of time. Only Akon comes off well, flipping the meaning of ""startin' somethin'"" and turning the song into a joyful seducer's groove, and here it's Jackson's own mush-mouthed new vocal that spoils things. </p><p>
    The remixes aren't a missed opportunity-- they're an imaginative way to wring bonus material from sessions overseen by a notorious perfectionist. It could be a lot worse. The last time <em>Thriller</em> got reissued it included ""Someone in the Dark"", a horror from the <em>E.T.</em> soundtrack showcasing Jackson's most saccharine side. We're spared that, and the token MJ rarity here is ""For All Time"", recorded during the <em>Thriller</em> sessions (and then later rejected for <em>Dangerous</em>). A glistening, slightly overdressed piano ballad, it might have made a nicely sappy album closer-- if we didn't already have the subtler, understated, and underrated ""The Lady in My Life"", possibly Jackson's most soulful solo performance on the record. </p><p>
    The DVD footage, with all the videos you'd expect, is much better. Watching the famous Motown 25th Anniversary performance of ""Billie Jean"" in particular I'm struck by how angular Jackson's dancing is, how tense: Knees and elbows spiking out, body freezing into indecipherable alphabets. And then how beautiful, the way he simply flows out of each position, the release that made his music so joyful given kinetic form.</p><p>
    The biggest-selling album of all time, then, and you should probably take the ""of all time"" literally. His highest-clout guest stars here have shifted around one-twentieth the copies <em>Thriller</em> has, and in a dwindling industry it's hard to imagine anything similar happening again. Fluke it maybe was, but as a unification move it worked-- the last time, maybe, one person could incarnate almost all of pop, all the corny and all the awesome in one mind. We live now in the world of the ""long tail""-- <em>Thriller</em> was the big head.

    Some bands have all the luck: In 1998, Swedish D-beaters Disfear replaced original vocalist Jeppe Axelsson with At the Gates frontman and extreme-freelancer Tomas Lindberg. Talk about an upgrade (oldskoolers gasp!), the personnel shift gave the band the proper mouthpiece to keep up with its in-the-red pace, while basically guaranteeing extended ownership of the D-beat crown. So the entrance of Entombed guitarist Uffe Cederlund on this year's <em>Live the Storm</em> is almost unfair. As if <em>anybody </em>playing second fiddle wouldn't stoke the flames just fine, these guys went knocking on the door of the best Swedish death metal band <em>not </em>formed by Lindberg. Result: A death'n'roll supergroup, and one of the best heavy records of this still-young 2008.</p><p>
    But surprisingly, the most vital newcomer on <em>Live the Storm</em> is behind the boards. Filling the void left by engineer Mieszko Talarczyk (the Nasum grindcore legend who died in the 2004 Tsunami, and to whom the album is dedicated), Converge guitarist and God City impresario Kurt Ballou turns in some inspiring work. Though they try repeatedly-- on the fire-breathing title track, and the propulsive speed demon ""Maps of War""-- Ballou never lets Disfear swing as low and scuzzy as they did on the dirt-sucking early stuff, or even on the Talarczyk-helmed 2003 grime-fest <em>Misanthropic Generation</em>.</p><p>
    Instead, his production offers a clarity and separation that serves this bulkier version of Disfear perfectly, underscoring the band's hardcore/D-beat roots (see: barreling drum sound) without eclipsing their death metal chops (see: hefty guitar tone). But best of all, Ballou is ultra-reverent toward that joyful beer-metal bluster that creeps out whenever Lindberg and co. decide its time for a fist-pumping gang-chant. Cue half-palmed feedback. Cue pick scrapes. Cue full band hollering the lines ""A testament! Born out of desperation!"" You get the picture.
    </p>
<p>
    Except for the extended intro on album-closing ""Phantom"", the tracks here almost always cut straight to the chase, hurdling straight for the chug. Lead salvo ""Get It Off"" finishes before it even starts, with bare-bones gusto and a nose-punch call-and-response chorus about freedom. Meanwhile, there's no bells or whistles on hulking album-standout ""The Furnace"", whose climax comes with the introduction of a simple riff-following police siren sandwiched between two choruses. And as far as beer-buddy moments go, ""In Exodus"" stands beside ""Testament"" as the album's paramount, peppered with a basement full of ""whoa-oh-oh""'s. 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, if moments like these don't boil your blood, <em>Live the Storm</em> won't go down easy. It sticks pretty resolutely to the D-beat formula: hardcore drumming set against breakneck riffage and unintelligible howls about anarchy, working-stiffs-as-rats, and banding together to, you know, fight. But for anyone who digs the blue-collar energy of Darkest Hour, the focused assault of From Ashes Rise, the beer-swilling madness of Motörhead (or the fact that metal could actually be <em>this</em> fun), Disfear has written a great rock record-- way long on aggression, way short on bullshit, and boundlessly enjoyable.

    The 14 tracks on <em>Rivers Arms</em>, the second album from twenty-something Texas duo Balmorhea, sound much like the band's list of influences probably reads. For that matter, such a strong, select lexicon could be a subset of most 2007 bands making instrumental music with folk, classical, jazz, and 20th-century classical inspirations: There are the swells of Stravinsky, the mercurial keyboard majesty of Debussy, the triad-based romanticism of Arvo Pärt, the clangorous sensuality of Keith Jarrett, the electronics-meet-acoustics approach of Max Richter, and the beaming melodic flashes of the Takoma Records cartel (from John Fahey to George Winston, mind you).</p><p>
    If those names don't mean much, think of Balmorhea as a freshman-level seminar in making pretty music that works on multiple levels. Most everyone should make it through class and carry something away, while others may use it as an inlet into deeper lessons: On the surface, Balmorhea's music is gorgeous, dynamic, and emotive, a bit like Sigur Rós with an interest in understatement. <em>Rivers Arms</em> combines piano, acoustic and electric guitars, banjo, strings, and samples into short passes, so that nothing's too consuming or exhausting. Though it lasts just less than an hour, <em>Rivers Arms</em> cycles through motifs without wasting many seconds or losing interest.</p><p>
    A closer look, though, reveals accomplished mechanics that allow (perhaps old and familiar) influences to filter into something refreshing. Michael Muller and Rob Lowe (not the 90 Day Man/Singer/Lichen or the sex-tape teen idol/George Stephanopoulos stand-in) are Balmorhea, and they're assisted here by violinist Aisha Burns, cellist Erin Lance, and bassist Jacob Glenn-Levin. <em>Rivers Arms</em> charms so easily because Muller and Lowe separate and integrate so many styles and ideas in small spaces. Several songs based in ivories and bows (""Baleen Morning"", ""Barefoot Pilgrims"") hint at the dramatic climaxes of fuck-all, quiet-loud Texas post-rock. Balmorhea, though, always tug the reins just right, insuring that any incandescence doesn't torch the more journeyman guitar tracks, like the Six Organs-shadowing ""Greyish Tapering Ash"" or the Album Leaf electronics of ""Process"". The pieces fit, and the colors blend.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Rivers Arms</em> offers little in terms of technical or compositional innovation, but it does capitalize on a facet of instrumental music that's constantly suggested but rarely accomplished: Despite its often elegiac turns and always graceful maneuvers, the music here leaves itself open to individual interpretation. The songs certainly have their moods, and titles taken from seasons or places suggest inspirations and implications. But these songs never exist in a vacuum, and any dominant air always makes room for the counterpart that's just around the bend. Like ""The Winter"": All twinkling guitars, fleeting sheets of strings, and piano lines that drift downward in diagonal columns, it feels like the season it proclaims. But traces of hope flicker from twinkling guitars, lining the melancholy. The melody is handled meticulously, too, creating stillness and movement in the same space. ""The Summer"", which precedes ""The Winter"", opens with atonal cello sustains. Even though a duet of bucolic acoustic guitars eventually dances above those strings, the foreboding drones hover at the brink, threatening from a distance like a surprise Texas snow cloud. 
    </p>
<p>
    Such is Balmorhea: Texas gets a rough (if deserved) rap for its extremes, from Plano football games and their cinematic scores to obstinate world leaders and their stubborn ideas. But Balmorhea flashes brilliance only to highlight a slow-burning constancy that's at the core of one of the year's early slow wonders.

    Saviours are calling their second record <em>Into Abaddon</em>, but
    partying so hard you think you're going to die ain't exactly like
    entering the realm of the dead. ""We partied really hard in 2006-- it was
    the gnarliest time,"" singer/guitarist Austin Barber told <em>Decibel</em>.
    ""So there are songs about drugs and songs about the end of the world.""
    This opposed, I guess, to the time Barber and Saviours drummer Scott
    Batiste made a record called <em>Syncopated Synthetic Laments for Love</em>, in 2001, with their former emo-yelp outfit Yaphet Kotto. Of course, <em>Laments for Love</em> did have a gnarly locked groove that would repeat ""Bush is a dickhead"" until you picked up the stylus-- into abaddon indeed.</p><p>
    Today Saviours talk more about ""this burning plane of Earth,"" although
    ""Firewake Angel""'s ""unearthed beast"" might well be how you'd describe
    Bush after six more years of acid tabs. Their particular corner of this
    burning plane remains Oakland, where bassist and Drunk Horse ax-slinger
    Cyrus Comiskey shares an apartment with High on Fire's Matt Pike. <em>Into Abaddon</em>, like 2006's <em>Crucifire</em>,
    borrows some from the Pike catalogue, speeding up the unruly weeded-out
    riffs Pike played in Sleep, setting them to HoF's d-beat pummel. But,
    like fellow hardcore vets Tragedy, Saviours still retain a kind of
    careening punk DNA in their sound; Batiste, lurching from one sludgy
    trapdoor to the next double-bass gallop, is too versed in the dynamic
    hurdles of his old outfits to spend much time sticking with any one
    part, no matter how much it might slay. It's that California Swing Kids
    swing, stretched out to slow motion.</p><p>
    Since <em>Crucifire</em>, Barber's shaved a few registers off his
    voice, tarnishing it with what sounds like the most epic tour-van cold
    of all time. ""Into Abaddon"" shudders with rolling drum unfurlings,
    boozy shouts, and bearded backing vocals. ""Mystichasm"" starts out like
    the band's trying to pin the insufficiently faithful to an opposite
    wall. Chalk some of the heft here up to Melvins/Tool producer ""Evil"" Joe
    Barresi, who's got to be the guy responsible for the wicked low-end
    that bashes along during ""Cavern of Mind""'s wahed-out guitar solo. In
    almost every song comes that moment of payoff where Saviours clear
    space around Barber's ravaged throat and plummet into a howling,
    half-time breakdown. Barber shouts ""UNHOLY SEAL"" just as his band drops
    through it.
    </p>
<p>
    Anyone familiar with the teetotaling basement-show grind out of
    which Saviours emerged should be able to spot how vengefully the
    pendulum is now swinging back. Saviours retail on Kemado, the same
    label as the Sword, but their greasy Motörhead appropriations have the
    messy punk momentum absent from the Sword's mannered, denim-clad
    reenactments. In Barber and Batiste's pasts are no shortage of
    straightedge band members and underpowered amplifiers. They're now
    furiously making up for both.

    Rings are a band with their own private logic. At least, they seem like one, which constitutes about half their appeal. You could call them an ""outsider"" band, but that's indulging a fetish term-- instead, think of them as ""insider"" music: Intimate to the point of obscurity, so keenly aware of their own self-fashioned world that they ignore everything around it. The three women in the group-- keyboardist Kate Rosko, guitarist Nina Mehta, and drummer Abby Portner (sister to Dave, aka Animal Collective's Avey Tare)-- follow in a tradition of spooky post-punk that eschewed rock for reggae, dub, and folk (the Raincoats' second album, <em>Odyshape</em>, is an obvious touchstone; some Slits songs qualify, too).</p><p>
    They affect naiveté because naifs exist unencumbered by their surroundings; they play like the music lies just outside of them, like it's warm and raw-- like it's the first time. Mehta's guitar lines spurt from her fingers with half-random haste and Portner pants behind like she's being dragged by her own drumkit. They all yell and it's shrill as heck.</p><p>
    The frustrating truth about <em>Black Habit</em>, however pretty and enchanting and strange, is that Rings' songs sound beyond their grasp. Not because they've created something with a life of its own, but because their implicit ambition-- to make secret-sounding, powerful, hypnotic music-- outweighs their verve. When Mehta flatly yelps ""I want to be free!"" over and over in ""Scape Aside"", the mantra coaxes the band to a frenzy and almost carries them over, but instead of goddesses baying moonward, they sound like irritated girl scouts banging on the ceiling from the top bunk. ""Is He Handsome"", the most bewitching track here, is interrupted by first-take giggles. Rings are always on the tail of a vibrant eco-force, it's just that sometimes it's a monster through uncertain woods, other times it's a kitty in a living room.</p><p>
<em>Black Habit</em> has the makings of a great album, but it isn't one. It's irritating, alluring, brief, and sweetly aloof. The vocals shoot through the din like primary colors over charcoal. The crypto-sexy music clatters and tumbles, a perpetual ruffling of the feathers. There might be great moments, and there are at least half-great ones. Rings' pretense is to freedom, I guess, and it's a warranted one. They're free, and as much as I want to come with them-- an embarrassing amount-- <em>Black Habit</em> resonates like a preacher unconvinced by his or her own sermon; it keeps me at its threshold and stays inside itself.

<span lang=""EN-AU"">""Electro-house,"" sceptics complained in a
    teacher's pet tone, ""is neither electro, nor house."" True enough, and not just
    because cross-breeds rarely look just like their parents. The point of this
    ungainly tag was to say ""not-techno"": Electro-house set itself up
    as both techno's opposite and its substitute, reversing the traditional
    combination of cold rhythms and warm melodies. If techno is typically restless
    and fidgety in spite of its four by four kickdrums, the ""house"" in
    electro-house envisioned a flat landscape of sameness for the synth riffs to
    spitefully dance over.<span> </span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">

    certain plateau of intensity usually paid enormous dividends. ""Our World (Our
    Music)"", a 2003 collaboration with the Sunsetpeople, is humbling in its sublime
    simplicity-- it's little more than minor key chords, insistent bass pulse, and a nourishing strings. ""Body Language"", the duo's
    official collaboration with Booka Shade and biggest hit, is a similarly perfect
    example of the virtue of restraint. Given its ubiquitous presence (now even
    underwriting a Will.I.Am single), the track remains surprising in its
    refusal to climax, simply coiling and uncoiling with a suave, poised air of unconcern.</span>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">Very few moments on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">12 Great Remixes for
    11 Great Artists </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">can rival this sense of
    perfection. The earliest remixes (for Sugababes, DJ Monique, and Röyksopp) come
    close at times, concocting a sugary, echo-strewn and stadium-sized electro-house
    sound well ahead of its time. By comparison, the more recent efforts can feel
    unnaturally stunted and held in check: You can spot the moments where
    production partners Booka Shade probably said, ""We can add strings and a big
    chord change here,"" and M.A.N.D.Y. responded with a ""No, let's cut back to a
    kickdrum and add some disconnected electronic squiggles and an inscrutable film
    sample instead."" </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">Perhaps when Booka Shade emerged in their
    own right as German house's most anthemic duo, M.A.N.D.Y. felt pushed into
    turning their commitment to restraint into a hardliner stance, determined <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">not </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">to go for the peaktime jugular, tearjerker chord, or
    obvious hook-- <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">not </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">to be seduced into unabashed
    prettiness (they made an exception for their wonderfully soppy remix of
    Chelonis R. Jones' ""Le Bateau Ivre"", shamefully not included here). Of their
    recent remixes, only their rave-dub take on Rockers Hi-Fi's ""Push Push"", a mix of
    trembling, bouncing synth chords, is outright irresistible.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">The impeccable production ensures that
    these productions <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">sound </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">lovely throughout, but
    it doesn't always protect them from an air of pointlessness, especially when
    the duo approach remixes of good songs with the apparent intention of
    quarantining their hooks. Remixes for </span><span lang=""EN-AU"">Röyksopp</span><span lang=""EN-AU"">'s ""49 Percent"", Lindstrøm's ""I
    Feel Space"", and Rex the Dog's ""Prototype"" all follow the same basic structure:
    1) Spend several minutes wandering directionlessly within an atmospheric but
    Spartan house groove, 2) Effectively splice in a large chunk of the original
    song, sans climax, 3) Subside back into anorexic pulses, and 4) Fade out. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">Perhaps there's a good reason for this:
    M.A.N.D.Y. are DJs first and foremost, and most of these tracks sound
    structured for long blends with other complementary grooves. The ""I Feel Space""
    remix in particular sounds great in a club context, the pre-echoes of the
    original's anthemic italo march tickling at your brain as they oh-so-gradually
    coalesce into something recognizable. But there's a built-in lifespan for this
    ""slight return"" style of remix, even if you love the original songs to death.
    And I wonder at the sense of releasing an unmixed compilation of these tracks
    for the home listener, especially when M.A.N.D.Y.'s ethos is compared to a
    whole host of producers who used electro-house's widescreen sensibility as a
    template for constructing remixes of extravagant architectural grandeur,
    rendering the original tracks irrelevant (see Tiefschwarz, Jacques Lu Cont,
    Ewan Pearson).</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">What can be a liability in M.A.N.D.Y.'s
    production work is a strength in their DJ mixes: Their anti-linear approach
    to track selection can make for subtle and hypnotic mixes of compelling
    laterality. The duo's opening contribution to Get Physical's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Body Language </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">series remains their highpoint: at first seeming almost aimless, its
    slow survey of the breadth of German house ultimately reveals itself as
    obsessively structured and surprisingly anthemic-- a friend described the mix
    as revealing ""hidden shallows"" over time. But while their last official DJ mix,
    2006's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">At The Controls</span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">, seemed to want to cover
    every single possible reference point, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fabric 38 </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">finds them unusually focused, carefully navigating the thin space
    between minimal house and techno (much has changed since the ""not-techno"" of
    five years ago). </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">In fact, many of the selections strongly
    reflect the legacy of Derrick May in particular, toning down the ""plip plop""
    that made minimal vulnerable to ridicule, but remaining too fitful and fidgety
    and insectile to rest easily within the bracket of ""house."" In most other
    senses, though, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fabric 38 </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">sounds like the
    kind of mix that Loco Dice was making in 2005: melodic but dry, setting layers
    of percussion and clouds of echo over sandpaper-rough textures. The set doesn't
    sound out-of-date, but it sits at odds with the prevailing consensus that the
    ""new"" direction for German house and techno entails a re-engagement with deep
    house's organicism. For its long but busy middle stretch in particular, the mix
    is almost defiantly uniform and machinic, light on charisma or memorable hooks,
    but obsessed with depth-- every track feels like staring into a bubbling swamp.
    </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">It may just be a personal bias that finds <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fabric
    38 </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">more engaging at its most gentle and twinkly
    and, well, house-like, from the whimpering, descending chords of Crowdpleaser's
    remix of Quarion's ""Karasu"", to the interweaving layers of chimes on Lucio
    Aquilina's ""My Cube"". But it's also these moments (weighted towards the
    beginning and the end of the mix) that are the album's most diverse and
    expansive. The extravagant percussion of Guillame and the Couto Dumont's
    ""Mederico"" is the set's most exciting and memorable inclusion, not least
    because its captivating syncopation shines a light on M.A.N.D.Y.'s superlative
    mixing skills-- the dexterity of which can be obscured by the general
    succession of like-minded tracks. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">If <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fabric 38 </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">12 Great Remixes for 11 Great Artists </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">fall short of their aims for apparently opposite reasons (one too
    focused, the other not focused enough), the common thread for both is an
    unnecessary fear of obviousness. Yes, M.A.N.D.Y., subtlety is your <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">thing</span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">, but when the strings break on ""Our World (Our Music)"", only a

<span lang=""EN-AU"">The impeccable production ensures that
    these productions <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">sound </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">lovely throughout, but
    it doesn't always protect them from an air of pointlessness, especially when
    the duo approach remixes of good songs with the apparent intention of
    quarantining their hooks. Remixes for </span><span lang=""EN-AU"">Röyksopp</span><span lang=""EN-AU"">'s ""49 Percent"", Lindstrøm's ""I
    Feel Space"", and Rex the Dog's ""Prototype"" all follow the same basic structure:
    1) Spend several minutes wandering directionlessly within an atmospheric but
    Spartan house groove, 2) Effectively splice in a large chunk of the original
    song, sans climax, 3) Subside back into anorexic pulses, and 4) Fade out. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">Perhaps there's a good reason for this:
    M.A.N.D.Y. are DJs first and foremost, and most of these tracks sound
    structured for long blends with other complementary grooves. The ""I Feel Space""
    remix in particular sounds great in a club context, the pre-echoes of the
    original's anthemic italo march tickling at your brain as they oh-so-gradually
    coalesce into something recognizable. But there's a built-in lifespan for this
    ""slight return"" style of remix, even if you love the original songs to death.
    And I wonder at the sense of releasing an unmixed compilation of these tracks
    for the home listener, especially when M.A.N.D.Y.'s ethos is compared to a
    whole host of producers who used electro-house's widescreen sensibility as a
    template for constructing remixes of extravagant architectural grandeur,
    rendering the original tracks irrelevant (see Tiefschwarz, Jacques Lu Cont,
    Ewan Pearson).</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">What can be a liability in M.A.N.D.Y.'s
    production work is a strength in their DJ mixes: Their anti-linear approach
    to track selection can make for subtle and hypnotic mixes of compelling
    laterality. The duo's opening contribution to Get Physical's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Body Language </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">series remains their highpoint: at first seeming almost aimless, its
    slow survey of the breadth of German house ultimately reveals itself as
    obsessively structured and surprisingly anthemic-- a friend described the mix
    as revealing ""hidden shallows"" over time. But while their last official DJ mix,
    2006's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">At The Controls</span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">, seemed to want to cover
    every single possible reference point, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fabric 38 </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">finds them unusually focused, carefully navigating the thin space
    between minimal house and techno (much has changed since the ""not-techno"" of
    five years ago). </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">In fact, many of the selections strongly
    reflect the legacy of Derrick May in particular, toning down the ""plip plop""
    that made minimal vulnerable to ridicule, but remaining too fitful and fidgety
    and insectile to rest easily within the bracket of ""house."" In most other
    senses, though, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fabric 38 </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">sounds like the
    kind of mix that Loco Dice was making in 2005: melodic but dry, setting layers
    of percussion and clouds of echo over sandpaper-rough textures. The set doesn't
    sound out-of-date, but it sits at odds with the prevailing consensus that the
    ""new"" direction for German house and techno entails a re-engagement with deep
    house's organicism. For its long but busy middle stretch in particular, the mix
    is almost defiantly uniform and machinic, light on charisma or memorable hooks,
    but obsessed with depth-- every track feels like staring into a bubbling swamp.
    </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span lang=""EN-AU"">It may just be a personal bias that finds <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fabric
    38 </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">more engaging at its most gentle and twinkly
    and, well, house-like, from the whimpering, descending chords of Crowdpleaser's
    remix of Quarion's ""Karasu"", to the interweaving layers of chimes on Lucio
    Aquilina's ""My Cube"". But it's also these moments (weighted towards the
    beginning and the end of the mix) that are the album's most diverse and
    expansive. The extravagant percussion of Guillame and the Couto Dumont's
    ""Mederico"" is the set's most exciting and memorable inclusion, not least
    because its captivating syncopation shines a light on M.A.N.D.Y.'s superlative
    mixing skills-- the dexterity of which can be obscured by the general
    succession of like-minded tracks. </span>

High Places' indulgence in nursery rhymes aside, the kinship is mostly an ideological one: Like Beat Happening, they exult in the simple.</p>
<p><i>03/07 - 09/07</i>, a collection of the band's first 7"" and stray compilation tracks (released through the mp3 subscription service eMusic), shows a group whose comfort zone isn't the folky imperative, but heady, hippyish imprecision. The songs here are almost all identical: polyrhythmic miniatures built by small drums and shakers, clouded by blankets of echo and reverb; deliberately basic structures; short, and in their own way, catchy and pretty. Rhythms suggest provinces a step removed from where other white, arty urbanites tend to dwell: There are flashes of soca, reclined bounces that remind me of Indian music, and though ""Sandy Feat""'s swing could be Tom Petty's ""American Girl"" or David Bowie's ""Modern Love"", they inflect it they way Brazilian bands like Os Mutantes did (or Paul Simon on <i>Rhythm of the Saints</i>)<i>. </i></p>
<p>High Places' trunk-rattling impulses are juxtaposed with a spacious, almost tranquil atmosphere, with Rob Barber's percussion chiming and floating rather than physically hitting, and Mary Pearson's sweetly flat vocals layered to the point that her lyrics often become indistinguishable. That blur makes High Places' music hypnotic: Pearson chatters away like a light-headed kid on the playground on one song and intones a mantra on the next, and it's only then that you notice how both forms operate on the same principle: repetition induces calm. (Full disclosure: Pearson's sister is a former Pitchfork employee.)</p>
<p>Pearson's vocals and the duo's lyrics are charmingly coquettish: She reduces falling in love to ""Oh, you're a pretty boy, a pretty boy"" and writes letters to Martians. ""Jump In"", penned for Pearson's Michigan elementary school, is so full of encouragement that it scans like the transcription of a guidance counselor or junior minister. ""Canary"" apologizes to animals displaced by ecological warfare-- ""we really messed up."" The sentiments are frank, but I out them for three reasons: There's nothing wrong with being positive, the band's confident enough to handle it, and they make me happy.</p>
<p>""Universe""'s lyric makes this clear: ""It takes a lot of guts to be a little baby in this place."" The idea of returning to infancy might resonate as a dippy bohemian nightmare,     but in a society where moderate cynicism is considered a higher road to intelligence than acceptance and curiosity, and where sarcasm is considered a social reflex, you'd be hard pressed to argue with them-- it does take guts.</p></div>"|11150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11150-0307-0907/|8.3|Mike Powell

    Jake Fairley is one of a few North Americans to figure into the grand narrative of techno over the past few years. He made his name in Toronto before moving to Berlin, where he joined hordes of expatriate DJ/producers-- is there a census yet to track such an epochal migration?-- keen to play routine gigs bigger than what would qualify as career highlights at home. In his transplanted role, Fairley was one of many, another promising player on a deep bench busy making Berlin a story. So what made him special?</p><p>
    Not much, at the start. Or, in another fashion: versatility. The ability to wander meaningfully between different styles isn't often valorized within the delirious techno glut, but Fairley is a prime example of the kind of artist who benefits from time on the sidelines. He made solid but less-than-starry singles for good labels (Traum, Sender, Kompakt), and in 2004 he crafted an album, <em>Touch Not the Cat</em>, that failed to win due appreciation even though it ranks now with the best realizations of the late glam-stomp techno style known as ""schaffel.""</p><p>
    Then he blew up. Under his guise as Fairmont, at the end of 2005, Fairley made one of those storied dance tracks that introduce a new sound (not a style, but a specific sound) to mark a time and place on techno's long-term trajectory. In the case of ""Gazebo"", it was an ethereal synth bauble thrown into a perpetual falling action over the span of several bars, a protracted melodic idea that suggested the structure of a ""round"" but teasingly refused to coalesce. ""Gazebo"" played as an instant anthem at the time, and its influence remains in a realm where significance is measured in terms of months more often than years.
    </p>
<p>
    Nothing on Fairmont's <em>Coloured in Memory</em> proves quite as wondrous, but the craft remains. ""Fade and Saturate"" opens in a dramatic mood, with series of reversed-tape smears and ashen synths building over vocals by Fairley himself. Unlike on <em>Touch Not the Cat</em>, which cast him as a bashful singer not quite sure how to hold a microphone, Fairley sounds now like he means it. And his hissy whisper haunts even when he's not there: In similarly keyed highlights like ""Darling's Waltz"" and ""Mobula"", suggestive shadows of songs fall over tracks made up of just washes and beats, all of which hit big but rustle or spray accents to make them register as more holistically musical.
    </p>
<p>
    A lot of <em>Coloured in Memory</em> sounds like Superpitcher and Michael Mayer, two fellow song-minded producers (and reigning icons of the Kompakt label) whom Fairley clearly reveres. Superpitcher plays out in the matter of moods-- brooding, gray, sensuously in love with sadness and detachment-- while Mayer figures into Fairley's dramatic knack for moving parts in and out of place like a DJ. ""I Need Medicine"", the biggest dance track on the album, showcases the latter with movements arranged around throbs, taps, snaps, and finally a beat that bangs with all the concision of a stamping machine.
    </p>
<p>
    The final third of <em>Coloured in Memory</em> downshifts into a spell of midtempo meditations and ambient murmurs. It's the kind of direction known to derail techno albums by even the best, but Fairley makes good on the habit for expansiveness he's earned. <em>Coloured in Memory</em> meanders, but never less than meaningfully so.

<em>Guitar Soli</em>, the Numero Group's collection of obscure solo acoustic guitar instrumentals, professes to explore the ""private side of the solo guitar movement from 1966-1981"". The public side needs no introduction here, having been documented by Martin Scorsese in his revealing 1983 documentary <em>The Last Raga</em> about the decadent concert blowout for solo guitar's leading lights. Davey Graham did a load of blow off of a Martin D-28 and Bert Jansch nearly choked Sandy Bull with a nickel-wound 46-gauge string. Wait, no, that never happened. The scene's leading lights used 1966-1981 to move into some combination of obscurity, poverty, and cult worship. Solo acoustic guitar is not by definition a private affair but its conventions-- and the personalities that are drawn to those conventions-- are not typically the public type.</p><p>
    But I'm being a shit: surely Numero means only to show a side of acoustic composition and performance outside the genre-defining names like John Fahey, Robbie Basho, and Leo Kottke, none of whom were really public figures but all of whom enjoyed (or enjoy) critical acclaim and understanding audiences. <em>Guitar Soli</em> collects fourteen such pieces, focusing neither on technical achievement nor on any coherent historical narrative. Freed of even minor stylistic excesses-- like Fahey's collage or Basho's chant-- <em>Guitar Soli</em> defies categorization as anything but six-string plainsong.</p><p>
    So silly miniatures help focus <em>Guitar Soli</em>. Ted Lucas, who turns in the comp's most furiously picked track, ""Raga in 'D'"", was Motown's Indian-music session man, playing sitar for the Temptations and the Supremes. Richard Crandell has found work after learning the mbira while driving Thomas Mapfumo's bus. Daniel Hecht knew Moondog and now writes mystery novels. Best of all, Mark Lang's ""Strawberry Man"" is sunny and weightless in its contemplation of a beachside fruit vendor but it never would've hit the tape if Lang hadn't grown jealous of his brother Peter, who cut an album with Fahey and Kottke. Other tracks require no backstory at all: Stephen Cohen's ""No More School"" is exactly as red-faced and dimpled as its title suggests, while Jim Ohlschmidt's ""The Delta Freeze"" is <em>Guitar Soli</em>'s most singular sonic statement, a mess of strangulated slides that grow denser and angrier until the tape saturates.
    </p>
<p>
    The music only gets so peculiar, though: these are acoustic guitar tracks mostly in the folk mold with occasional Eastern influences. <em>Guitar Soli</em> doesn't even contain a proper blues; its most far-off cut is its last, Dwayne Cannan's ""One Forty Eight"", which features an electric guitar part best described as...Carlos Santana-y? Strange, but it fits: these artists, along with Fahey, Basho etc., were important bridges between the American Primitive style birthed by the 1960s folk movement and the New Age 80s. <em>Guitar Soli</em> is no missing link but its placidity, a product of carefully minded source music and the subtlest of desires to innovate, suggests that the artists of <em>Guitar Soli</em> belong in the discussion, however private and odd their endeavors.

    Like many other Los Angeles
    indie bands, Biirdie are beholden to the city's musical history and to the
    larger perceptions of SoCal pop, Laurel
    Canyon folk, and Sunset Strip rock.
    However, unlike their peers over in Silver
    Lake, many of whom use those styles
    as jumping-off points for further sonic experimentation, Biirdie aren't trying
    to get out from under the past. The Glendale-based trio embraces history, and
    occasionally on <em>Catherine
    Avenue</em><em>,</em>
    their second album, they sound content to summarize primary sources rather than
    offer original analysis of these styles.</p><p>
    ""L.A. Is Mars"",
    a meandering locals anthem with <em>Sophtware Slump</em> synths, an unironic guitar solo,
    and stoner vocals from Jared Flamm, borrows its sound from a variety of lower
    West Coast sources and its municipal observations (""where the wind blows money
    and stars"") from so many other depictions of the city-- <em>L.A. Story</em>, ""Welcome to the Jungle"", even Shawn Mullins' ""Lullaby"".
    But the band does too little with the title's planetary imagery and, despite the
    landmarks that litter their lyrics, never give us their own personal view of
    the city. A few tracks later, ""Life in a Box"" plays like a better ode to L.A.;
    its trippy chorus fuzzes out into a harmonica solo as Flamm namedrops Warren
    Zevon in the lyrics and the Byrds in the music, but by the time the song
    reaches its end, Biirdie are trying to be the Flying Burrito Brothers, which
    doesn't suit them quite as well.</p><p>
    Biirdie's reliance on the past doesn't make them a bad band
    by any means, just one with a flair for period costumery. Often, these songs
    can be charming. Their cover of the Texas Tornados' ""Who Were You
    Thinkin' Of"", with its killer organ licks and jubilant harmonies, sounds like
    the Carrie Nations playing behind chicken wire at an Amarillo
    roadhouse. Gleefully singing about getting some with someone who's getting some
    more on the side (""You got more out of it than I put into it""), they make
    self-deprecation sound pretty far out. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's not too surprising that the best song on <em>Catherine Avenue</em> is the one that pushes
    the envelope the most, i.e., the title track. Flamm takes us on a walk from
    Embarcadero to Dennis Lane
    as he laments lost friends and the other band members ""ooh"" like Fleetwood Mac.
    Then comes a cosmic guitar solo, followed by an out-of-nowhere spoken-word
    bridge from bassist Kala Savage that sends the song spiraling into another
    realm. Savage (who, yes, has an actor brother named Fred) takes vocal duties on
    ""Petals"", pushing the album away from the needless digressions of the previous
    track, ""I'm Gonna Tell You Something"", and toward a dusty canyon folk sound
    that suits her voice. With moments like this scattered throughout <em>Catherine Avenue</em>,
    the album proves simultaneously ambitious and complacent, which is a strange
    combination. Biirdie want to give us a walking tour of their city, but they
    don't realize we've seen all these sights and heard all these sounds before.

    ""I'm not part of your coke rap genre,"" seethes Clipse's Malice on the third installment of Re-Up Gang's stellar <em>We Got It For Cheap</em> mixtape
    series. While an estimated 90% of the lyrics on <em>Vol. 3</em> deal
    with the illicit exchange of  various forms of cocaine, there's some
    truth to Mal's assertion. Along with Clipse partner Pusha T and cohorts
    Ab-Liva and Sandman, the threateningly whiny MC isn't part of anyone's
    convenient hip-hop trend: The Re-Up Gang belong to a genre unto themselves. That intense singularity culminated with the release of 2005's
    <em>Vol. 2</em> and 2006's <em>Hell Hath No Fury</em>, two insular triumphs that
    solidified the group's current cult status: They've sold more
    than a million albums, chilled with
    Pharrell, and had 17,000 sun-stroked indie kids rat-a-tatting at last year's Pitchfork Music Festival. Let's see Young Jeezy pull off all that.</p><p>
    But while Clipse have operated largely within their own bubble since the fluke-ish explosion of ""Grindin'""
    back in 2002, they've always had an enemy to rail against. The <em>We Got
    It for Cheap</em> series originated as a not-so-subtle ""fuck you"" to the
    record labels that consigned <em>Hell Hath No Fury</em> to backburner status for years. These mixtapes-- laced with jacked beats and immortal industry put-downs-- were legitimate acts of protest. That indignant anger and
    uncompromising spirit (combined with their unparalleled way with Pyrex
    punchlines) turned <em>Vol. 2</em> and <em>HHNF</em> into two of this decade's most striking rap LPs. But now, graced with blinding critical kudos, a modest-yet-loyal
    platoon of fans, and a $1.8 million record deal co-signed
    by hip-hop icon Rick Rubin, the Re-Up Gang don't have much to complain about.</p><p>
    Without a clear-cut target, Clipse &amp; co. start to expose the limits of their style on <em>Vol. 3</em>. The beginning of the tape finds Pusha spitting a couple jaw-dropping (albeit inaccurate) Lil Wayne
    take-downs, but the pseudo beefing comes off half-hearted. (Funny enough,
    Malice recently admitted, ""I think Lil Wayne gets more burn than the Clipse
    in my house,"" while talking about his kids' listening habits.)
    Elsewhere, the crew tries to create drama with references to vague
    haters, ""tree-hugging-ass bitches"" and disposable pop rappers. At one point,
    commenting on the state of hip-hop, Pusha claims, ""All that super stupid shit is done""-- a delusional-at-best statement in the Soulja Boy era. 
    </p>
<p>
    Malice eventually comes through with a wrought passage about the strained relationship between his clique and Pharrell while referencing a conversation with Clipse's manipulative former label boss Barry Weiss: ""<span id=""more"">Barry
    said P is selfish as hell/ I was like, Stay in place homey, watch
    yourself/ Now this man could place my life upon the shelf/ And, as for
    P, he has yet to wish me well."" The tension contained in those lines is more revealing and powerful than a million bullshit call-outs.</span></p><p>
    Compared to <em>Vol. 2</em>, where the Gang snatched beats from Cassidy's ""I'm a Hustla"" and Tony Yayo's
    ""So Seductive"" to serve as a nearly flawless backdrop, <em>Vol. 3</em>'s beats
    aren't as immediate or rewarding. They convincingly roll over Obie
    Trice's underrated ""Cry Now"" but can't match the
    effortless celebration that marks Jay-Z's ""Roc Boys"". Kanye's ""Good Morning"" and Raekwon's ""Rainy Dayz""
    are well-chosen introspective picks, but the group's trademark eye-widening bangers are
    lacking here-- the tape could use a couple more ""1 Thing""-type change ups
    to lift the sometimes morose vibe.   </p><p>
    Still, this is a characteristic Re-Up record. The quartet-- especially Clipse-- still turn plenty of phrases that can crack you up while trapped in a rush-hour subway car (two personal favorites from Pusha: ""Under my cuticles proof the pies that I sell/ Guess life in
    jail's but a manicure away/ Well I don't feel like gettin' my nails
    done today-- yuchk!"" and ""I pull from the ghost of the dead greats/ Ouija board flow, all you niggas
    is dead weight""). And though Ab-Liva and Sandman fare better than your
    typical auxiliary crew dudes, it's becoming increasingly clear they'll never come remotely close to
    matching the Thornton brothers' talents.  </p><p>
    On ""Re-Up Gang (Intro)"", Liva raps, ""We on the rise but I'm bothered by this view."" Granted, the quartet haven't reached Kanye levels of Olympus-dom but, in an industry where loyal fandom
    is becoming an increasingly prized commodity, these niche artists are
    doing pretty well. Even their label troubles seem safely in the rear view. So who'll be the next object of this group's acid-tongued wrath? Malice offers an intriguing possibility on ""Emotionless"":  <span id=""more"">""Truth be told, I been feelin' different lately/ Like, fuck money and the dollar is the devil's baby."" Man in the mirror, meet your neighborhood drug dealer.</span>

    unavoidable when you're trying to classify or keep straight hundreds or
    even thousands of artists that fall beneath the banner of
    indie rock. Hence, Vampire Weekend gets likened to <em>Graceland</em>
    even if the resemblance is slight rather than exact, while thanks to
    the nasally pipes of Alec Ounsworth, assessors of Clap Your Hands Say
    Yeah will probably always evoke Talking Heads regardless of where the former group draws its inspiration. Associations
    with better and more established artists may add pressure
    to musical up-and-comers, but it also piques the interest of said artists' fans and
    admirers, and at least put these listeners in a positive frame of mind
    when putting the record on. Then again, it can work just as easily in opposition when the point of reference leaves you cold.</p><p>
    The potential side effects of prejudicing a listener's first
    impressions is something I've been thinking about since encountering Lightspeed Champion. Lightspeed
    is the current project of Devonte Hynes, most notably a
    member of now-defunct dance-punks Test Icicles. A
    head-spinning 180-degree turn from his previous group's beat-fueled
    mayhem, the new project finds Hynes assuming the role of a florid troubadour, dewily emoting
    over well-manicured strings and acoustic guitars.</p><p>
    Because Lightspeed Champion has toured with Bright Eyes, and
    because longtime BE collaborator and go-to Saddle Creek producer Mike
    Mogis helmed this record, Hynes' latest effort has earned him a slew of
    misleading comparisons to Conor Oberst's acclaimed-yet-divisive outfit-- an association that not only misrepresents Hynes' positive attributes, but his
    shortcomings, too. Oberst has an awkward way of shoehorning
    twang into his unchecked poetic rambling, but on <em>Falling Off the Lavender Bridge</em>, Hynes<em> </em>offers
    a comfortable (and more interesting) marriage of lush Brit-pop and
    Omaha-flavored country-rock. 
    </p>
<p>
    On
    the other hand, Hynes' lyrics aren't quite up to par with his tourmate
    Oberst. And while Hynes' voice isn't carefully spotlighted as Conor's, you can unfortunately still make out what he's saying. A precocious
    young man himself, Hynes has an awful predilection
    towards the kind of ""transgressive"" lyricism that's less
    shocking than just plain silly. Pick your poison: ""I'm sick in your mouth,"" ""Wake up, smell the semen,"" or
    something that certainly <em>sounds</em> like ""until they cum down his throat."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Given
    the way Hynes has transitioned from disco-thrash to roots-pop, I suppose it's possible his next record might be
    hair metal laced with r&amp;b or punk-rock opera. If he's patient
    enough to dig deeper into his current terrain, though, he could cultivate a sound distinctive enough for other artists to begin garnering ill-fitting comparisons to <em>him</em> instead.

    Besides rapping for a stellar, 
    relatively unknown St. Louis record label, L.A. resident Umar Rashid 
    is a t-shirt designer, painter, and the author of a graphic novel for 
    children, <em>The Hunter and the Teardrop</em>. According to a description, 
    the book is ""a moral tale about an interstellar hunter who kills all 
    the great beasts in the universe, and one day finds he has nothing left 
    to kill.""</p><p>
    Rashid's nom de hippity-hop 
    is Hi-Fidel, and his second album is not really what you'd expect 
    from a West Coast renaissance dude. Entitled <em>The Company 
    of Wolves</em>, it tells the tales of sad-sack characters plucked from 
    the swampy muck of his imagination. As he explains on ""Barbara Kruger"": 
    ""These are people that I've never known/ But I'm pretty sure they're 
    out there/ Hope your cover's not blown."" Some are alcoholics, some 
    are crackheads, nearly all are depressed, and the government and big 
    corporations are just making things worse. The anti-hero in ""The Thin 
    Wall"" is headed off to Iraq: ""And he realizes when the man on the 
    TV screen fumbles/ It's just a game/ And in real life everything crumbles."" 
    ""Jimmy""'s title character, meanwhile, may have issues, but he 
    takes solace knowing he's not as bad as ""that crazy president who 
    killed them babies/ Or that prime minister that slaughtered those ladies.""</p><p>
    The tone is quite different 
    from Fidel's 2002 debut, <em>Traveling Between St. Louis And Chicago</em>, 
    in which the cynicism was tempered by a hopeful enthusiasm. But it's 
    not just Fidel who has changed; equally responsible for <em>Wolves</em>' 
    death march feel is DJ Crucial, who produced both albums. <em>Traveling</em>'s 
    looser, more energetic setting was fitting for one of the Midwest's 
    great acid-rock-sampling DJs, but here Crucial has largely forsaken scratching 
    and sing-alongs in favor of flutes and jazz-influenced noir beats. We're 
    left without a song to rock out to, or even a head-nodder like <em>Traveling</em>'s 
    masterpiece, ""Tenth Wonderful"".
    </p>
<p>
    But there's a Bukowskian 
    beauty in all this pain, and even a few laughs. ""Gordo 3003"" borrows 
    Dr. Octagon's twinkling space-age bleeps and imagery, down to the 
    ""iguana-like reptiles armed with projectiles, criss-crossing the night 
    sky like African textiles."" Fidel is nonetheless better served when 
    he leaves the goofy surrealism to collaborator Serengeti, who raps on 
    ""Party Farmington"" about a cougar who seduces young men while her 
    man is working at a weapons factory in the suburbs. (""We spoke about 
    steroids, and her husband's bed wetting."") Serengeti is joined on 
    the album by other underground ringers including recent Om: Hip Hop signee 
    Black Spade, L.A.'s Pigeon John, and St. Louis' Mathias, the latter 
    two of whom are responsible for the album's single uplifting track, 
    ""Small Victories"". The pair reportedly had a tough time convincing 
    Fidel to record this hopeful song, but it nonetheless inspired him to 
    deliver his most impassioned verse on the album, one which may also 
    offer a clue as to his evolving mindset: ""I know there'll be brighter 
    days ahead but for now/ I gotta stay fit and maintain my style.""

    Conventional wisdom says that if you go out of your way to
    establish a side project, it should sound different enough from your main gig
    to actually justify its own existence. It's one thing to recommend Monade on
    the basis that you'll probably like them if you like Stereolab, given the
    pivotal involvement of singer/lyricist Laetitia Sadier. But after listening to
    Monade's 2005 album <em>A Few Steps More</em>,<em> </em>it gets a bit perplexing when you
    hear how much a band containing precisely one member of Stereolab sounds so much like their parent group, right down to the
    motorik beats and the way the guitars and electric pianos create that familiar
    harmonic drone.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Then again, that's just another sign of how well the members
    of Monade have come together to work under Sadier's vision, and if you can
    create even the slightest variation on one of the most distinct sounds in indie
    rock without losing what makes it work, the question of stylistic redundancy
    feels a bit like nitpicking. <em>Monstre Cosmic </em>lies somewhere between
    comfort food for Stereolab fans and a cohesive work that gives Sadier and her
    group a bit of leeway to stretch. While <em>Monstre Cosmic </em>does what many of
    Sadier and Tim Gane's compositions have done in the past-- finding pop in the
    avant, reshaping and extruding weighty concepts into easily graspable doses of
    simple, riff-heavy rhythms-- it also tends to do so in a slightly more elegant
    context, trading in the subtle and thoughtful quirk of recent records like <em>Fab
    Four Suture</em> and <em>Margerine Eclipse</em> for an equally subtle and
    thoughtful grace.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Sadier has stated that <em>Monstre Cosmic </em>is<em> </em>thematically
    held together by an abstract conceptual notion of how light and shade interact.
    If it doesn't always come through clearly in the lyrics (which, per usual, are
    in French half the time), it does seep through in a compositional sense. ""Étoile""
    and ""Elle Topo"" use these contrasts to great effect, with the former shifting
    from post-dusk reverie to summery noontime buoyancy and back like a 72-hour
    time-lapse photo, the latter ricocheting between delicate country-psych and
    high-speed Kraut-pop, before letting the two gradually merge. Most of the other
    songs on the album do so in a less-spectacular fashion-- the transformation of
    ""Entre Chien et Loup"" from a sleepy Moog-meets-chamber music dirge into a
    punk-velocity percussive workout is more admirable on a technical sense than an
    emotional one, and the rhythmic transitions of ""Invitation"" happen just as each
    groove has just about lost its steam-- but strung together as a unified work, <em>Monstre
    Cosmic </em>runs a remarkable gamut of tones and moods, even if you have to try
    and forget over 15 years' worth of Stereolab records to hear its freshness.

Opener ""This Place in Time"" kicks off with a panoramic cacophony of viola and cello that quickly fades out to a pretty, filmic harmony of long, drawn-out chords and tension-building silences. Colleen's usual urge to interweave loops of electronics with vocals and strings is absent here; instead, the opening track is so listless and chord-driven that it sounds like an exit-- either to an album or an Ang Lee film.</p><p>
    For much of the album, there's no palpable machinery at hand except a microphone. There are subtle effects lent to the classical guitar on ""Le Labyrinthe"", Colleen's seeming homage to Renaissance-era lyre ballads. Precise rhythms and ever-climbing scales between two guitars may suggest ""computer,"" when in fact the song is simply a study of musical dialogue, and of polyphony. It's free of percussion and completely a relic of a distant past. Similarly, ""Blue Sands"" is breezy, inviting, and ancient. Slightly reverbed guitar plucks and windy strums recall Joni Mitchell at the dulcimer or Arthur Russell at the cello. Hollow harmonics on the viola reel and see-saw in the song's gorgeous climax, and the guitar remains in the background, adding a subtle counter-rhythm.</p><p>
    ""Echoes and Coral"", with its hints of watery field recordings and gong-inspired melody, sounds more like Mira Calix, to whom it's increasingly easy to compare Colleen since the latter relinquished the laptop in favor of a global range of strings and percussion. The song could easily be bells heard far off during a walk through a Buddhist courtyard, and yet there's a clear, traditional composition behind the seemingly random, relaxed taps of metal. ""Le Bateau"", also suggesting Calix's creeping, melody-free wanderings about strings and keys, knits itself into a cohesive, cognizant melody-- just the thick plucks of a viola shifting from mood to mood, relaxation to urgency.</p><p>
    The other star instrument here is the clarinet, which notably appears on ""Sun Against My Eyes"" and makes a pretty, but a little hokey, complement with the guitar. The tempo on this and most of the other tracks is so slow that it can be frustratingly lulling. But I can think of many situations when ""Sun"" could render a scene, a meditation, or a non-automobile TV commercial perfectly sad and memorable, and in fact it's one of few well-paced songs here. It's energetic in places, even urgent, and feels fully fleshed out, while many others here are sheer ruminations. Lovely as they are, many of these songs are little watercolors that might not find the same kind of audience as Colleen's electronics. However, they might find a new audience in those that dug Greenwood's score to <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, classical string fans or players, and anyone with painterly patience to spare on a crisp winter afternoon. <br/></p></div>"|11096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11096-les-ondes-silencieuses/|6.8|Liz Colville

From     their first guitar scribbles on 2003 debut, <i>The Decline of British Sea Power</i>, through the more streamlined     songwriting on the 2005 follow-up, <i>Open     Season</i>, the Brighton band have pushed themselves and their craft beyond     simply re-creating rock music: The band perform dressed in vintage military uniforms on stages decorated with foliage, yet they never come off as ironic. Their approach is playful yet cerebral, like a logic puzzle. So, although the title     of their third album, <i>Do You Like Rock     Music?</i>, might seem overly straightforward for such a elusive group, its     inquisitiveness is crucial: British Sea Power would like us to abandon our genres, subgenres, and microgenres. To hell with     indie, post-punk, and new wave; for British Sea Power, all of these fall under     the rock rubric.</p>
<p>To this rock-critical end, the band recorded <i>Do You Like Rock Music?</i> around the world--     in a Czech forest, in a crumbling fort in Cornwall,     and most tellingly, in Montreal     with the Arcade Fire's Howard Bilerman and Godpseed You Black Emperor's Efrim     Menuck. This is a band going for broke by going global. They inflate the     plaintive guitar pop of <i>Open Season</i> to monumental proportions, amplifying every element until it sounds enormous     and overwhelming. The epic choruses and chiming guitars on ""Waving Flags"" and ""Down     on the Ground"" sound immodest, as if the overzealous band wants to convert all     you nonbelievers: You don't just <i>like</i> rock music, you love it, you need it, you worship it. Rock music has a     wonderful plan for your life.</p>
<p>That's a huge undertaking for any artist, and     of course British Sea Power come up short. <i>Do     You Like Rock Music?</i> doesn't fail miserably-- which at least might have     been more interesting-- but disappoints gently. These songs sound big in the usual     ways, and that's a genuine shortcoming for a band that's made so much of its eccentricities     over the years. Where formerly they made glancing references to bands     like the Pixies and the Psychedelic Furs (singer Yan still sounds studiously like     Richard Butler), the primary touchstone on <i>Do     You Like Rock Music?</i> is U2. And not 1980s U2, 2000s U2. Too often the     drama sounds painstakingly deliberate, rising and falling expectedly. ""No Lucifer""     even bullies you into chanting along with its shouted refrain ""Easy! Easy!     Easy!"" but offers no cathartic reward or explanation for what will seem to many like an     esoteric repetition. (It's actually a reference to a British wrestler.)</p>
<p>The recording work by producer Bilerman, along with Menuck and Graham Sutton (of     Bark Psychosis), sounds decorous but often impersonal. A quick-moving     guitar winds through the first measures of ""Lights Out for Darker Skies"", but the band's wall of sound violently overtakes     it. Later, the scrappy guitars on ""A Trip Out"" sustain the song from start to     finish before ""Open the Door"" dials it back for a     surprisingly tender folk-pop chorus and a strong, short guitar solo. But ""Canvey     Island"" weighs down the album's     middle section with its hesitant pace and expository lyrics: ""Like     Canvey Island,     1953. Where many lives were lost, and the records of a football team."" This     type of matter-of-factness forestalls any real wonder at the serendipity of     nature and history (the song references a fatal flood), which British Sea Power conveyed so eloquently on previous     albums.</p>
<p>Despite the implications of the band name, British Sea Power     don't work as well at this size and scope. They're in danger of becoming the Alarm to the Arcade     Fire's U2. Curiously, these stadium-sized songs channel less passion, anger,     or awe than their earlier work. Granted, emotion has never been the band's strong suit, but here,     British Sea Power speak the language of big feelings with little to back     it up. <i>Do You Like Rock Music? </i>sounds     empty at its core, with a rock where its heart should be.</p></div>"|11152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11152-do-you-like-rock-music/|8.2|Stephen M.

    But for anyone who's followed the Mae Shi, this has to come as some sort of payoff. The band has quit cramming as many breakneck riffs as possible into each convulsive track, chilled the fuck out, and begun to focus on linear songs. More than that, the L.A. six-piece has finally made an album that matches their grand ambitions, one that weaves most of their songwriting tricks together with some new ideas, and manages to be listenable and cohesive.</p><p>
    This is the band who sold ""mixtape"" CD-Rs containing several hundred of their favorite songs at a few seconds each and DVDs with 30-plus videos, built their own synths, called previous albums ""hip-hoperas"" while sounding like the ugly rejected bits of new-wave at 77 RPM, and talked all sorts of shit while reigning spaz-rock terror on any club, supporting slot, or Bar Mitzvah that would have them. No longer; they now walk the walk.
    </p><p>
    Vocalist Ezra Buchla (late of the excellent Gowns) has left the group, and his strangulated squall has been replaced by Jonathan Gray, who's got a slightly calmer yet still excitable voice. The band itself retains a caffeinated anxiousness that can make the hairs on your arm stand up, and Gray's self-harmonizing sounds desperately cheerful and pained to persuade, like the last plea for everyone to take the first sip of spiked Kool-Aid. That's no accident: Many of these songs aim for ""inspirational."" But even with the relentless perk and the seemingly Bible-thumping lyrics, they're still subversive and individualist.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Run to Your Grave"" is the best summation of the record, and its high-water mark. Here, the lyrics sidle basic can't-take-it-with-you sentiments next to more subtle observations (""Emotion is a simple test to the synapse/ Don't let it fool you into thinking that you've got brains""), while the keyboards are sunny enough to burn flesh. On this track and elsewhere, Gray over-eagerly pushes us towards rapturous surrender, including a maybe-too-excited call for some old fashioned soul-reaving on ""Pwnd"" (""Do it fast! Make it hurt!"") and a lockstep denial of emotion and independent thought on ""Grave"". Likewise, the singer of ""Young Marks"" praises holy war as ""noble and divine"" through enough Autotune to induce laughing fits, and the campfire over-assurances of closer ""Divine Harvest"" (which let us know ""It'll be over when you die,"" with a rousing clamor at the end) are hardly calming. 
    </p>
<p>
    Even without those themes, the Mae Shi run through a gauntlet of gaudy ideas without ever losing steam, like the fleet-fingered riffs of ""Boys in the Attic"" (see what they did there?) or the community-theater shuffle of ""7xx7"", while memories of Nintendo loom large on ""The Melody"" and the ominous closing minutes of ""Leech and Locust"". All the shrill exultation and greasy glisten of hyper-compressed guitars and loping Casios build up to something like an album-length musical for the tweakers in after-school detention by a band that sounds the way Ecto-Cooler tasted.
    </p>
<p>
    But it wouldn't be the Mae Shi without pushing themselves just beyond the reach of their ability, or letting listeners get too comfortable for too long. To wit: ""Kingdom Come"" is an 11-minute techno megamix of every song on the album, and it sits right in the middle of it. It's awful. But it would have been an enormous cop-out to put it at the end of the record or bury it as a hidden track, which they're probably aware of. Kudos to them for running headlong into their ambitions; they've earned the privilege.

His second LP for Sony is a bracing throwback of sorts to the angry-man hip-hop that got me started in 1991 or so, back when Ice Cube, Treach, Willie D, and Chuck D rewrote the rules of ""conscious rap"" to incorporate the conscious desire to knock some sense into you.  And while <em>Ghetto Extraordinary</em> could possibly have been seen as a refinement of 2006's monstrous, trend-chasing <em>I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind</em> mixtape, there's one sad irony that hangs over these volatile narratives; Killer finished recording unaware that he'd have to give it away on the internet almost three years later just to let it see the light of day.</p><p>
    As Scott Plagenhoef wrote in his ""Through the Cracks"" column earlier this month, getting the shit end of the stick from a major often results in knee-jerk critical sympathy, but it's not like Sony missed out on a Dixie Hotel Foxtrot here-- <em>Ghetto Extraordinary</em> is all over the place, and while it's not particularly jarring for a record you can download for free, as a major release, it can certainly be seen as a victim of overeager retooling.  In the event that it does gain a reputation as a buried treasure, it won't be a result of the bougie Jagged Edge track, ""Niggaz Down South""'s serviceable but reductive trap-hop or David Banner's umpteenth cannibalization of the ""Rubberband Man"" beat (""Aye-O"").  What makes the delay of this thing so curious is how it manages to open a time warp into the year it was supposed to drop; considering his debut <em>Monster</em> went gold, it's hard to believe this wouldn't have made sense in a year when the public was enamored with all things Atlanta.</p><p>
    Drums go off like mortar rounds on the club-razing ""Get 'Em Shawty"", a reminder that Three 6 Mafia used to produce some of the most frightening music in hip-hop before they limited their palette to Willie Hutch samples (granted, the second half does interpolate their colossal beatdown anthem ""Who Run It"").  Meanwhile, ""Gorilla Pimpin'"" is one of the few beats of the 21st century that 8ball &amp; MJG sound comfortable on and even the track featuring estranged partner Big Boi (""My Chrome"") could pass for a budget ""The Way You Move"".</p><p>
    But the emotional core of <em>Ghetto Extraordinary</em> can be found in ""Bad Day/Worst Day""'s two and a half minutes of epic negation; less than 60 seconds in, Mike has called out C. Dolores Tucker, Bill O'Reilly, Al Sharpton, Kobe Bryant, BET, MTV, the new hos on ""Soul Train"", and the old hos on ""Soul Train"".  It's no mere bitchfest, even if it barely stays on the rails-- his insights on hip-hop go from trenchant (""Q Tip singin', 'dre 3000 actin'/ Goddamn niggaz too good for this rappin'?"") to hopelessly lame (""We went from 'too black, too strong'/ To Sisqo and the goddamn Thong Song'""), before excoriating the church (""I'd rather let Eminem call me 50 niggaz/ Than break bread with a rich nigga readin' scripture"") and making an open-ended claim about sharing the same birthday as Hitler.  </p><p>
    Mike manages to sell these contradictions, not so much as a manner of charisma, but in the way his authoritative bark bullies his thoughts into line.  ""Mama Said"" starts out evoking Biggie's ""Everyday Struggle"" (""I'm sick of waking up fucked up""), but as opposed to being a revelation about his foul lifestyle, his remorse comes from having no product to sell.  By the end, his issues with the opposite sex have him espousing Chris Rock-style sympathy for his long-departed father and O.J. Simpson but he closes with pointed words for would-be trappers (""Throw the book at your black ass for cocaine/ I got a partner who ain't coming home til LeBron James in the Hall of Fame"").  </p><p>
    Not that <em>Ghetto Extraordinary</em> lacks a sense of humor.  ""Gonna Go to Ghana"" pump-fakes as bullshit Dead Prez posturing before Mike puns off his atlas over the limber, Zapp-ed out funk of Andre 3000.  Even the police brutality dissection of ""Shot Down"" is all the more effective for its caustic one-liners: ""I'm a young black male, that's a deadly profession/ Got more gun questions ask Charlton Heston.""  It's one of the many times you can practically hear the classic vitriol of Ice Cube, at least until he shows up for the remix of ""Bad Day/Worst Day"". Cube famously cast himself as a rapper you love to hate, even if anyone who listened to his records couldn't help but love or at least admire him, period.  If Killer wants it, he might be the second coming; by nature of its circumstances, <em>Ghetto Extraordinary</em> can't help but feel comparatively minor, but when he's hitting his targets this often, Killer Mike demands you make way for the South's prophet of rage.    <br/></p></div>"|11087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11087-ghetto-extraordinary/|7.9|Ian Cohen

    The Busy Signals make it look it easy. Their self-titled 2007 debut deserves being mentioned in the same reverent breath as their one-time lablemates, the Exploding Hearts, as it has the same unabashed hero adulation and the same brash attempts at
    reaching those impregnable heights. Their overall sound never varies, with plentiful hooks and searing guitars that recall plenty of 1970s punk rockers and
    power-poppers like the Buzzcocks and likely a dozen more obscure acts. There's
    no hoarse screaming, political posturing, or desperate panting from lead singer Ana McGorty;
    just a frontwoman who sings and acts like she belongs up front. There are only
    so many words to relay this record's spot-on reverence, really; the relentless guitars,
    the harmonies, the treble, the echo, the energy-- they're all here, faithfully
    delivered and impeccably produced.</p><p>
<em>The Busy Signals</em>
    is a well-executed stab at punk rock comfort music. But within that tried-and-true
    formula, the band finds ample room for variation and surprise-- the album is
    consistent without ever getting homogeneous, and without really reveling in how
    exacting the songwriting is. ""Plastic Girl"" is a patchwork quilt dizzy
    from chord changes you'd never notice for its infectiousness and it's devilishly
    simple chorus, while ""Look the Other Way"" has slick single-note
    guitar leads and a short cool down with bassist Jeremy
    Thompson (formerly of Carbonas) raising his voice before, yes, another great
    chorus. All the songs show that the devil is in the details: a windmilled chord
    up against a well-timed, economic lead; a sudden unaccompanied bass part that
    pivots and pushes; an boy/girl baton hand-off vocal in ""Matter of Time""; just an ""Oh"" or ""woah-oh"" at the right moment. Songs
    like ""Matter of Time"" and ""Patterns"" are the most
    hero-cribbing, but stand ably on their own with clean, simple
    guitar lines that sound almost like Western soundtracks in how they wrangle and
    lead the song.</p><p>
    But like many a band of
    spurned and jilted outcasts before them, the Busy Signals' bratty
    attitude lifts to reveal a bruised interior: the energy of the record
    hits first, but more
    listens reveal the hopeless romanticism of tracks like ""Tell Me"" or
    ""Kiss and Tell"", doo-wop laments in overdrive. One side of the band
    shakes out their troubles to instantly-memorable songs like ""Stereo"",
    the other gives teary-eyed relationship woes a pretty stirring
    soundtrack in their own right. Both sides are worth checking out and
    keeping tabs on, and, as
    McGorty sings ""young, young, young"" over and over in ""Patterns,""
    they all sound like their unyielding enthusiasm will never dim.

    Last year, Tilly and the Wall's 
    Derek Pressnall had what was either a mental breakdown or a hallucinatory 
    case of mono. Feverishly convinced that he could sense the future, the 
    Omaha-based musician was compelled to create, transforming the pressure 
    of those premonitions into his new band: Flowers Forever. Accordingly, 
    the trio's self-titled debut rings with the urgency of newfound creative 
    rejuvenation while also wallowing in painful vulnerability and flickering 
    with anger.</p><p>
    With baroque orchestration, 
    often aggressive rhythms, and crunchy, buzzing textures, these songs are 
    an obvious departure from the cheery tap-dancing pop of Tilly. But what 
    they've lost in exuberance and childlike sweetness, they make up for 
    in sober (if a tad heavy-handed) maturity and artistic ambition. Unsurprisingly, 
    given that it's being released by his Team Love imprint, the album's 
    closest relative seems to be early Conor Oberst recordings (albeit without 
    the lo-fi tape hiss). It's nearly impossible to not hear the Bright 
    Eyes frontman's influence when Pressnall's voice cracks and strains 
    with desperation on ""Wet Diamonds"" and ""Black Rosary"". But with 
    a shambolic orchestra of carnival organs, mournful horns, fuzzy guitars, 
    and trembling tambourines, Pressnall (aided by drummer Craig Dee and 
    Baby Walrus multi-instrumentalist Chris Senseney) sidesteps the boy-and-his-ballad 
    traps of other Conor wannabes, embracing the artier, more aggressive 
    sounds of those other Saddle Creekers in Cursive. <br/></p><p>
    Unfortunately, Flowers Forever's 
    unchecked cynicism and anger can seem overindulgent-- on the expletive-laden 
    ""Happy New Year"" where Pressnall rages against, what, the holidays?-- but 
    when it is earned, as on the galloping, gypsy-brass re-imagining of 
    Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit"", Pressnall's emotive, electrifyingly 
    tuneless shout-singing is incredibly powerful. It is put to its best 
    use on ""Golden Shackles"", when, in one of the album's most affecting 
    moments, he repeatedly screams, ""Change better come/ We're not fucking 
    around no more,"" reminding listeners of the desperation that spurred 
    him to create these tracks in the first place. Standout song ""American 
    Dream"" enlivens his disillusioned lyrics with whirling, celebratory 
    orchestrations of Continental accordions and western-standoff horns 
    then devolves into a dissonant, drowsy vocal outro. Amidst such heightened 
    drama, the album's more buoyant moments-- the delightfully jaunty 
    piano track ""Beach Bum"" (the only clue here to Pressnall's Tilly 
    heritage) and the all-too-brief acid-fried Pavement paean ""Beautiful 
    Tornado""-- are welcome bursts of modulation.  
    </p>
    Though Flowers Forever's 
    songs aim to be anthems, their disorienting melodies aren't quite 
    accessible enough. And though there is plenty of crashing cacophony, 
    most of the silvery percussive bursts are too jagged to get fists pumping 
    in the air. That's not a criticism. There is something intriguingly 
    off-kilter about these tunes that warrants repeated listens.  And after 
    all, for an accidental clairvoyant, Pressnall's songs are surprisingly 
    prescient.</div>"|11105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11105-flowers-forever/|6.5|Rebecca Raber

First, there was the     popular late-60s beat combo, who made a few waves in Australia before returning     to England, where the three Gibb brothers-- Barry, Maurice, and Robin-- had     lived before moving down under as kids. They enjoyed hit singles like ""New     York Mining Disaster 1941"" and ""To Love Somebody"" and at least     one great album, <i>Odessa</i>. Many of those early songs endured, but the Bee     Gees were no longer household names by the time they teamed up with Atlantic     Records house producer Arif Mardin to record an album called <i>Main Course</i>,     the group's 11th,<i> </i>in 1975. That changed quickly.</p>
<p>They cut <i>Main Course</i> in Miami, everyone involved was     listening to Philly soul, and Mardin encouraged Barry Gibb to try singing some     tunes in falsetto. You know what happened next: Singles ""Jive Talkin'"" and     ""Nights on Broadway"" hit #1 and #7 in     the U.S., respectively. Ten months later, journalist Nik Cohn would write a <i>New     York </i>magazine cover piece called ""Tribal Rites of the New Saturday     Night"" (a story later revealed to be completely fabricated) about a young,     working-class Italian-American kid finding some kind of existential meaning in     the new dance clubs that were popping up everywhere. The article led to a     movie-- the soundtrack of which Bee Gees dominated-- and disco was on its way     to taking over popular culture in the U.S. at the tail end of the 1970s.</p>
<p>To a lot of people at the time, the Bee     Gees <i>were </i>disco. They were the sun around which the rest of the     not-so-brief fad revolved, the form's most important auteurs, the gold     standard. This may come as news to younger music obsessives for whom disco was     the underground movement that birthed Italo and house and techno and brought us     Larry Levan and Arthur Russell. In this century, disco has undergone an     interesting critical rehabilitation, with early figures like, say, the Loft's     David Mancuso and the Gallery's Nicky Siano being celebrated for their     contributions to underground dance music while the pop stuff has, for the most     part, been pushed aside.</p>
<p>This shift in emphasis was necessary. Disco needed to be     understood in terms of its roots among marginalized subcultures (gay, black,     Latino) and reclaimed by the people who made it happen in the first place, away     from the glare of the media. Not to mention, the narrative of those years, as     told in books like <i>Last Night a DJ Saved My Life </i>and <i>Turn the Beat     Around</i>, is fascinating. Still, you can't help but feel that something     important is being overlooked: Just how phenomenal some of this stuff was as     pop, especially the <i>Greatest </i>of the Bee Gees.</p>
<p>Here, on an expanded version of a 2xCD compilation that     first appeared in 1979 and covered just five years, are 20 or so arguments.     Some of them-- ""Jive Talkin'"", ""Stayin' Alive"", ""You     Should Be Dancing"", ""Night Fever"", ""More Than a     Woman"", ""Nights on Broadway"", ""Love You Inside Out"",     ""How Deep Is Your Love""-- are unassailable. The Gibb brothers were on     a dazzling songwriting roll during these years, penning Top 10s for themselves     and others almost at will, and they also had a firm grasp on the possibilities     of disco as a sonic phenomenon. They understood that it was a culture of     records and not bands, so they strove to make the records perfect, polishing     the mechanized beat to a blinding sheen. The liner notes to this reissue give     this credit: ""Recorded on MCI's JH-556 Console and JH-16 24 Tape     Recorders."" Sound mattered then, as it does now-- the mastering on this     reissue is excellent.</p>
<p>Beyond the overly familiar hits are a number of other     good-to-great songs. ""Too Much Heaven"" from 1978 is a ballad with a     winding structure Burt Bacharach would admire, though its extra saccharine cast     puts it far below ""More Than a Woman"" and ""How Deep Is Your     Love"" as far as Bee Gees slow-dance numbers. ""You Stepped Into My     Life"" has a tougher, more funk-influenced beat that serves as an     interesting contrast to Barry's falsetto, showing a possible road not taken had     the ultra-smooth sound not panned out. ""Wind of Change"", from <i>Main     Course</i>, with Ray Baretto on congas and Barry belting out the melody in his     natural range, transposes the meatier Philly soul aesthetic without the     refinement of later hits. ""Rest Your Love On Me"" is a welcome change-up--     a straight country ballad complete with pedal steel, hearkening back to the     early Bee Gees' interest in rootsy forms, but doing do now with bright, twinkly     production. There are four or five duds among the originals here, but that's     still a good ratio for a half-decade.</p>
<p>The extras are disappointing. The seven-minute 12"" remix of     ""Stayin' Alive"" rules, with subtle edits, a bit more percussion, and a     nice inversion of the horns stretching it out to a length that doesn't overstay     its welcome. But the newly commissioned remixes are not just mostly dull but     also weirdly dated, sounding very late 1990s. The Jason Bentley/Philip Steir     remix of ""You Should Be Dancing"" turns it into a generic club fodder,     the ""Count Da Money"" remix of ""If I Can't Have You"" by     Julien and Raphael Aletti and the Supreme Beings of Leisure remix of ""How     Deep Is Your Love"" are sterile neo-trip-hop seemingly designed for a Gap     store soundsystem. The outside package doesn't mention the Teddybears remix of     ""Stayin' Alive"" that closes the set, suggesting that was added later     by someone who thought <i>Greatest </i>needed at least one remix that didn't     adhere to a ten-year-old formula. While it's nothing amazing, its gritty,     rockified neo-Justice squelch is worth a few plays at least.</p>
<p>Weak remixes and a few duff songs aside, <i>Greatest </i>is     the definitive statement of the Bee Gees peerless pop-disco prowess during the     second phase of their career. The albums, especially <i>Main Course</i>, are worth tracking down; but <i>Greatest </i>is a convincing demonstration of why the Bee Gees     mattered.</p></div>"|11153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11153-greatest/|8.8|Mark Richardson

On the heels of November's <i>Ask Forgiveness</i> EP, these releases risked giving off a ""Dear Fans: Thanks, also fuck off""-vibe, but since precisely no one's child is going Ivy League off of 10,000 copies of <i>Wai Notes</i> it's probably safe to assume we're being asked to pony up again in the name of Art.</p>
<p><i>Wai Notes</i> comes impeccably wrapped in stamped cardstock, its cover featuring a woman…in a woman suit, the backside boasting a glossy of a hambone Oldham sitting with <i>The Letting Go</i> collaborator Dawn McCarthy.  What's not clear is why these 10 demos weren't packaged with their parent album instead of the more useful rarities disc <i>Little Lost Blues</i>, now difficult to obtain itself.  The fickle nature of the Oldham cult all but assures that had <i>Wai Notes</i> preceded <i>The Letting Go</i> it would've been hailed as a return to sonically quaint beginnings; on at least two occasions Oldham sings the wrong lyric and immediately mutters a correction into the margin.  And it is worth wondering why Oldham no longer makes records like ""The Signifying Wolf"", on which a tiny guitar unravels and exposes horny animal chants.</p>
<p>But hell: <i>The Letting Go</i>, driven by Nico Muhly's tempest string arrangements, was the most clearly conceived record of Oldham's career.  Airing the dirty laundry of sleepy-dog ballads like ""Then the Letting Go"" or ""I Called You Back"" does them no favors.   Hearing Oldham tiptoe his way through ""Wai""-- his fingers hang over chords, as if he's trying to remember the changes-- is thrilling in a voyeuristic sort of way, but Oldham's is a catalog that already contains its share of flubbed notes.</p>
<p><i>Wilding</i> is harder to pin down but seems more useful.  Recorded live in ""central coastal California"" (no specific venue or date is named), <i>Wilding</i> is pressed by Oldham distributors P-Vine (Japan) and Spunk (Australia), and it's a bit difficult to sort out: Hagerty's unexplained ""remix"" work includes the random and indecipherable ""Naked Lion"" and, more intriguingly, a cut-up of ""Lost Blues"" and ""God's Small Song"" deft enough to pass as one coherent piece.  Ponder also the market that sees ""Little Small Song""'s ""fuck"" intrusively censored but ""Naked Lion""'s looped ""Yeah shit's hard"" given a pass.</p>
<p><i>Wilding</i>'s tenuous cohesion still fares better than 2005's cobbled-together <i>Summer in the Southeast</i>.  No one does loins-as-rock better than Oldham and he accordingly wrestles a set of quiet older tracks to the ground: ""O Let It Be"" and ""Three Questions"" are pugnacious, and Oldham has never presided over a moment as turgid as this band's teetering ""Master &amp; Everyone"".  Keyboardist Azita tenderly augments deep cut ""Weaker Soldier"" with barroom piano ambience.   McCarthy shows for the <i>Letting Go</i> material, which sees its strings replaced with haughty electric keys and the burly electric guitar of Emmett Kelly.</p>
<p>Then there's ""Magnificent Billy"", which is either a goof on ""Lay and Love"" or a live recording spliced with show banter: between harmonies Oldham and McCarthy alternate ""Just sayin' what's on my mind"" and ""Bonny Billy!…Bonny Billy!""   <i>Right</i>.

    For as long as indie drummers have been riding hi-hats, Mahjongg
    have taken up the noble mission of keeping their home city weird. No one knows
    exactly what to expect from any given performance of theirs, and they've kept
    up the struggle of cultivating that spontaneity on record-- which has
    proven a much more difficult task. On their first EP, <em>Machinegong</em>, they were
    plastic pop purveyors, afro-poppers, dance-punkers, and whatever else the hell
    they felt like; scattered as the styles might have been, they struck an
    incredible balance on that first EP that they've less successfully charted on
    the records that have followed.</p><p>
    But I can't blame them for not readily turning out another ""Aluminum""
    or ""Hot Lava"". It must be chafing to be lumped in with the masses of
    one-trick ponies when Mahjongg were one of the only bands toying with beats
    from around the globe, not just early-eighties England. Now with the distance
    of a few years' time, we can hear how far apart Mahjongg are from the trend--
    queasier, druggier, far more adventurous, and less likely to edit. Opener
    ""Pontiac""
    plays with polyrhythms to get heads bobbing, starting out sounding like Konono
    no. 1 before arriving on a thick early 80s syncopated boom-bap.
    ""Problems"" gets more interesting and more seasick  in its wobbling keyboard tones, and by the
    time the chimes come in near the end, its downtempo bounce sounds like a cousin
    to LCD Soundsystem's ""Someone Great"", like the early-morning hangover
    to that track's bittersweet euphoria.</p><p>
    But there's plenty of moments where they're staking their own trail, far
    from what any similar artist might be doing. ""Tell the Police the
    Truth"" implores honesty in the face of legal confrontation, but you can't
    help but read sarcasm over its pounding doorknocker beats and myriad laser
    effects. It's part of <em>Kontpab</em>'s strong middle section, bolstered by ""Those
    Birds Are Bats"", the track that shakes off any of the album's prior
    restraint as the singer belts out his most melodic turn and the drummer pounds out
    a 4/4 on the bass drum in heaving release. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Wipe Out"" is perhaps too stiff and amelodic,
    reminiscent of some of the aimless experiments that dragged down <em>Raydoncong 2005</em>. The following track
    ""Teardrops"" is equally stiff, but far more layered and bewildering. Both
    this and ""Mercury"" seem to toy with modern minimal r&amp;b--
    ""Mercury"" more explicitly, as it's led by warbling vocals that
    follow the nimble two-step of the keyboards while alien chimes hover above it
    all. But closer ""Rise Rice"", for lack of a better word, is bonkers--
    more polyrhthyms, more scary noises, and more drums that sound like the world
    is ending mark the band's own blazing, singular path. It's clearly the most
    stunning moment on an album that's stylistically all over the place; but does
    this make them underachievers, or are they leaving us wanting more? With an
    album this layered and omnivorous, there's not much to complain about, but if
    they'd used all the time they've spend on writing quasi-mystical press releases

Which seemed like a fool's errand to me, since Chicago's native sons seem more united by geographical circumstances than a clutch of easily identifiable sonic signifiers.  Judging from the likes of Lupe Fiasco, 
    Kanye West, Common, or even Twista, it could just be a tendency to flip nerd status to a sword 
    from a shield. If that's the case, Second City upstarts Yea Big and Kid Static 
    certainly carry on the tradition.  They met as a result 
    of a message-board flame war, the CD insert is fully rendered in comic 
    art, actual pictures have them capering like an interracial Junior Senior, 
    and they unironically open up for Rhymefest.  Safe to say they 
    do this for the love.     <br/></p><p>
    Prefuse 73 is frequently mentioned as a touchstone for Yea Big's production, probably 
    because it's the easiest shorthand for ""hip-hop with glitch influences"" 
    (poor Mush Records!).  While Big isn't on some beats, rhymes, 
    and life shit, he's also nowhere as confrontationally jarring as Herren; 
    the way ""Static Leads the Coup"" stitches together new beats every 30 seconds is genuinely thrilling and organic, and yet, nothing 
    feels like leavings from Warp's cutting-room floor.  He does share 
    a certain proclivity for exotic instrumentation-via-keyboard patches, 
    but even the roly-poly tablas (""Joining Forces"") and gamelan tappings 
    (""The Final Chapter"") play it four-on-the-floor.  Cut out the 
    half-minute interludes, and the exposed-wire ProTooling could pass for 
    a lost Viktor Vaughn album.      <br/></p><p>
<em>Yea Big &amp; Kid Static </em>indeed shares the democracy of Doom's records, 
    but it might have scratched the surface of Madvillain or similarly fashioned 
    projects (Foreign Exchange, DM &amp; Jemini, DangerDoom) if it was a 
    more equal partnership.  At first blush, Kid Static has to do a 
    lot to win you over with that overeager upper-register spit of his; 
    he gradually eases into a comfort zone that's somewhere in the realm 
    of Fatlip or even Sadat X, though he lacks either one's microphone 
    presence or wordplay.  It's mostly his job to keep things moving 
    while Big chops it up, and he rarely strays far from rapping about the 
    fact that he is currently rapping, even if there's supposedly some 
    sci-fi storyline buried in here.  Really, it's the sort of thing 
    where you cringe in anticipation of him talking about ""real MC's"" 
    or ""true hip-hop"" or something, but thankfully, that moment never 
    comes.  He can ride a beat with decent agility but other than a 
    few lines about Jager shots and beef stew, the vocal parts of this tend 
    to be serviceable, if not interchangeable.   <br/>
</p><p>
    Good ideas, bad ideas, it doesn't matter-- they don't stay on anything for very long, and the 16 tracks clock 
    in at a bullet-train velocity.  Granted, their press kit has them in the lineage of Digital Underground, De La Soul and Biz 
    Markie as an alternative to all the ""serious"" rap music (there it 
    is), which is giving them too much credit; <em>Sex Packets </em>
    and <em>3 Feet High And Rising </em>obviously had far more going for them 
    than a vaguely elucidated aversion to gangsta shit, and even though the duo intends ""get up and dance"" music, the actual result is more liable to put a pep in your step as you take a post-lunch scroll through the internet's finer hip-hop blogs.  Nonetheless, <em>
    YB&amp;KS </em>is as much a tribute to the more playful forms of rap 
    as it is a contribution to its survival, and it's hard to argue that the two fail 
    to fulfill their modest ambitions.

    Opposites attract. Opposites react. If you've ever taken or even
    pondered physics or chemistry, you've heard these generalizations. The
    positive pole of a magnet pulls against another's negative pole, and
    sodium (a soft metal that can be cut with a butter knife at room
    temperature) reacts quickly with chlorine (a pale green gas much more
    dense than air at room temperature) to make table salt. Then Human
    Bell-- the instrumental two-guitarists-and-whoever collaboration
    between Arbouretum's David Heumann and Lungfish's Nathan Bell-- is the
    sound of two substances with like properties entering a room, filling
    a room, and leaving the room. Their presence is felt, but-- in their
    separate, simultaneous and similar states-- they affect little.</p><p>
    That's not to say <em>Human Bell</em>,
    the Paul Oldham-tracked debut from the Baltimore-based duo, is
    noxious or even unpleasant. Rather, it's a collection of seven carefully
    played instrumentals too monotonous with regard to mood, composition
    and sound to make much of a lasting impression at all. <em>Human Bell</em>
    has its wondrous moments, like ""Splendor and Concealment"", which starts
    slow and spacious, like a rusty two-guitar theme for a field hand
    moseying along a stretch of barbed wire, looking for gaps in
    the barrier. It quickens and tightens suddenly, breaking the reverie as
    the guitars slip into tongue-and-groove, lick-and-complement
    counterpoint. ""Hanging From the Rafters"" works with similar two-part
    juxtaposition, opening through an ethereal vamp that moves with the
    spectral grace of a Loren Connors piece before abruptly shifting into a
    crusading march. Peter Townsend's circular drumming and Matt Riley's
    distorted washes of bowed guitar hold the interwoven guitar lines to the
    flame. It builds and releases, pauses, and finally erupts into the last
    five minutes. It's a victory march with a deserved denouement.</p><p>
    But ""Hanging"" is as close as <em>Human Bell</em>
    comes to moving its audience or to creating a new atmosphere through its
    own reactions. The other tracks slowly move to points of high drama only
    to release suddenly, self-consciously aborting ideas that promise
    catharsis or conversion. Opener ""A Change in Fortunes"" spends
    seven minutes climbing to nothing, and ""Outposts of Oblivion"" ebbs like
    a tide above a tiny sea of quartz singing bowls. It's constantly
    foreboding, but that sense-- present from the start-- just looms and
    never delivers. The counterargument, of course, is that these are mood
    pieces, and that tracks without climaxes are more open to
    interpretation. Ironically, the track ""Ephaphatha"" (an Aramaic
    expression meaning ""to be opened"") is most guilty of the tease, Bell
    surrounding Heumann's guitar in ghastly trumpet tones. Always on the
    edge of eruption, it's easy to ignore.
    </p>
<p>
    This give-and-retraction only reinforces monotony: Heumann and Bell
    compose differently, with Heumann preferring cyclical progressions
    and sudden arrivals to Bell's narrative logic and steady delivery. But both approaches mean these tracks all drive towards climaxes but grind into tedious halts. This half-commitment comes to a head in
    the closing 80 seconds, wherein opener ""A Change in Fortunes"" is
    reprised after the disc's mildly abrasive closer corrodes into a wash of
    echoes and refracted guitar tones. The glockenspiel's notes again
    twinkle above the dual crags of guitar, and the whole thing fades into
    the distance, announcing its own poetic significance through a musical
    inclusio. Trouble is, it feels neither like redemption nor realization;
    rather, it's just a reminder that-- for the past 45 minutes-- you've
    been sitting alone in a room with stable gases. Nothing has changed.

He's Humpty Dumpty <em>and</em> the king's men, pushing rock music over a ledge with Broken Social Scene, reassembling the pieces under his own name. And he draws a fairly strict line between these two manifestations of his music-- banjos on one side, distortion on the other-- although occasionally, a fugitive sound slips across the divide, such as the sequenced background twitter that underpins the clicky acoustic rock of ""Roll on Oblivion"", the first track on his new album. But by and large, there's no indication that Collett's two styles are heading for an intersection. His eponymous music is like an abandoned railway line-- an evocative relic from a bygone era-- running parallel to the newer, shinier tracks he's laying with Broken Social Scene.</p><p>
    As was the case with Collett's last album, <em>Idols of Exile</em>, his latest is a loving ode to his fellow Americana-obsessed Canadians in the Band. As a singer, charitable ears might hear Collett splitting the difference between Levon Helm's gritty soul and Rick Danko's cartoonish over-enunciation. Less charitable ones will notice that he's pilfered Bob Dylan's vocal tics wholesale, evoking an alternate universe where <em>The Basement Tapes</em> were the beginning of a long unbroken collaboration, not a prelude to divergence. ""Southern gentleman and your Bonaparte ways,"" he keens on ""Roll on Oblivion"", ""no need to get philosophic,"" the last vowel going reedy and nasal.</p><p>
    Like Dylan, Collett also likes to periodically let his vocal melodies flatten out into monochromatic smudges, as he does on the opening line of punchy rocker ""Papercut Hearts"". And he has a romantic attachment to highways, slum-dwellers, saints, harmonicas, and roadhouses. But all of this happens at the surface level, while at heart, Dylan and Collett are very different singers. Dylan has a way of feeling out his voice like a cautious swimmer probing uncertain depths: he pushes out into it, decides it feels okay, pushes a little further. Collett, quite simply, can sing, and lacks Dylan's sense of hesitancy and prodigious effort. His voice is naturally expressive and supple, capable of smoothly moving from a dusty wheeze to a weightless falsetto. When he sings, amid the smoky piano chords of ""Henry's Song"", that he's ""drunk on the blood of <em>luuuh-huuuv</em>,"" it sounds more like an aesthetic choice than an impassioned loss of vocal control.
    </p><p>
    This mannered, understated virtuosity permeates Collett's music, just like it did the Band's. The simple hitch and glide of ""Roll on Oblivion"" gets dressed up with reverbed guitar leads, judicious fringes of maraca, and vocal echoes. The blues licks prickling through the lite-groove of ""Sorry Lori"" are downright foppish, and ""Somehow"", with its carefully tended disembodied harmonies, sounds like something Thom Yorke might make were his computer confiscated. Collett's songs seem to begin with emotional and melodic immediacy but end in embellishment. These highly polished exteriors, paired with his superficial similarities to Dylan, make Collett's music seem like an art of pure surface, no matter how sincere his declarations of heartbreak may be. This isn't a strike against him, because the surface is quite fine. It simply reveals a telling inversion: Collett's indie rock-- typically the province of irony and disaffection-- smolders with spontaneous inspiration, while his trad-rock, which is typically the province of direct emotional candor and raw-boned effusion, sounds more academic. Perhaps there's more of a dialogue happening between Collett's two personae than is immediately apparent.

Because he toured with Sunn O))) and has been releasing albums on Hydra Head the past couple of years, he's often one of the few USBM     acts those new to the genre know about, and so his hate-filled one-man     post-Burzum (and Graveland) riffing appears particularly central to ""the scene.""     But then, there are the countless USBM acts who prefer to remain on much     smaller labels than Hydra Head -- labels that only deal in black metal     -- and would consider being spoken about in a non-metal rag anathema     and counterproductive (believe me, there are dozens of hardliners who've     politely declined inclusion in Show No Mercy).</p>
<p>Conner pulls distancing moves like refusing to do interviews for his     newest record and his press information for 2007's     <i>Defective Epitaph</i> made fun of the idea of listing ""selling points"" for     a black metal album, but c'mon: Most of the USBM underground doesn't have P.R.     guys or one-sheets to even tell you that. It's not that Conner's an outcast-- USBM acts like Texas one-man project Brown Jenkins or Seattle's     Krohm, thank Malefic in their liners -- though he's certainly not without his detractors.     See, for instance, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/fuckxasthur"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>this</b></a> sort of rage.</p>
<p>Outside of that kind of scene silliness or, conversely, hipster festishization, when     Conner's on, his shit's among the best on any continent (stop booing,     Norwegians). He has a brilliance for     creating suffocating atmospheres that are both beautiful and     claustrophobic (sometimes it's impossible to believe his homegrown recordings weren't captured in the basement of a cathedral). On top of production prowess, his unique whispered,     dry-rot, bird-like voice is piercing, chilling, and light as air, all at the same time. It's a unique, influential delivery...those who sound     like him have usually copped his style.</p>
<p>Interestingly, pairing Conner's 2001 <i>A Gate Through Bloodstained Mirrors</i> with 2007's <i>Defective Epitaph</i> feels     like entering the crossroads (of someone who's already made his deal with the     devil, natch), witnessing the musician wrestling with where to go next with his project. The excellently bleak, pummeling 2006 release <i>Subliminal Genocide </i>continued and deepened the template of Conner's past raw melodic black metal (see, for instance, 2002's <i>Nocturnal Poisoning </i>or 2004's <i>Telepathic With The Deceased</i>). He didn't do anything too radically different than before -- he just mastered his art. A year later on <i>Defective Epitaph</i>, though, he boldly mixes it up some by introducing live drums. That may not     sound particularly significant, but those programmed beats provided the     steady skeleton for his psychedelic spiraling. Conner still has the     snarl in his signature ghostly throat-shredding and the gloomy, phased guitar     layers, but he loses much of the propulsion -- like ""Purgatory Spiral""     kinda does feel a tad like Purgatory -- when he picks up sticks. He just isn't that great a     drummer. The other weakness here? The guitar sound isn't up to the     standards of his past output.</p>
<p>There <i>are</i> gorgeous (as well as relatively blistering)     moments that overcome his skinsman and production shortcomings. It's     not a <i>bad</i> album -- hell, the layers of noise he achieves on     something like ""Oration of Ruin"" are truly glorious. Elsewhere, out-of-twang,     ethereal treks like ""Dehumanizing Procession"" and the lovely super     atmospheric cello scraping of closer ""Unblessed Be..."" collide like the     angular weirdness of Blut     Aus Nord. ""Cemetery of Shattered Masks"" includes a streaming guitar and     synth-y combo that bolsters the percussion. More than ever before,     there's a certain natural spaciousness like Drudkh's <i>Anti-Urban </i>EP.     So, again, it's a matter of whether you prefer Malefic recorded in a     coffin inside a hearse or outside in the cold Cali mountains. For the     more whirlwind tracks, like ""A Memorial To The Waste Of Life"" or     ""Legacy Of Human Irrelevance"", it's the drums that become irrelevant,     disappearing into the feedback, mucking up the bluster instead of     increasing its power. His playing works when he's able to plow ahead     (like a drum machine), but if he tries to switch it up, it lags. This     isn't to say live drums couldn't work on a Xasthur album -- he started     out with a drummer, Ritual -- but they'd be more successful, perhaps,     with someone else playing them (like, maybe Wrest from Leviathan, who     can pound with the best of 'em).</p>
<p>For a look at Conner at his best, grab a copy of <i>A Gate Through Bloodstained Mirrors</i>,     a massive document that was first released in an edition of 150 CD-R's by in 2001, then     remixed and reissued by Total Holocaust in 2004. This 2-CD set is purportedly     the definitive edition and it's a melancholic, depressive, atmospheric masterpiece. For     those unfamiliar with the collection it also tellingly includes     Burzum (""Black Spell Of Destruction"") and Mütiilation (""Eternal Empire     Of Majesty Death"") covers. What, no Graveland? Additionally, this reissue     comes with a second disc featuring six previously unreleased     tracks from the same period-- including, fascinatingly, ""Untitled -     Rehearsal June '97"". There really is something about watching Conner's     process, because when he's at his peak, what he does feels very much     like art.</p>
<p>Throughout the proper 15-track album the mix is deep with waxy     counterpoint and expressive clean lines. Unlike <i>Defective</i>,     the vocals aren't placed so upfront: Wisps of agitation and anger,     they're buried more in the mix, occasionally surfacing and piercing     the clatter. There are more vocal layers-- almost spectral, albeit     homemade choirs. Take the excellent 12-minute ""Suicide In Dark Serenity"". As     its drums speed up into a sorta march, it feels like sounds are filling     a room from all sides, sucking out the oxygen. And even tiny moments     like the closing ""Lost Behind Bloodstained Mirrors"" or the synthesized     instrumental ""Storms Of Red Revenge Part 2"" drip with a concrete sadness. You'll also hear the title track, which later showed up in different form on <i>Nocturnal Poisoning</i> and (truly excellently) on <i>To Violate The Oblivious</i>. Throughout, there's a strong sense of narrative and procedural push,     exploration than with <i>Defective.</i> The entire album  -- though ragtag and numbingly long -- feels more like a whole. Its massiveness is its strength, the obsessive noise of one man careening.

Its massiveness is its strength, the obsessive noise of one man careening. Try to find a dull spot.</p></div>"|11652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11652-defective-epitaph-a-gate-through-bloodstained-mirrors/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    Samamidon (or Sam Amidon, as he sometimes bills himself)
    hails from Vermont and is the scion of
    a musical family with roots in Appalachia. A contributor
    to such indie projects as Doveman and Stars Like Fleas, he recorded five albums
    with his band Assembly before releasing a debut solo album of traditional Irish
    tunes performed on solo fiddle. A second full-length, <em>But This Chicken Proved Falsehearted</em>, out last year on Plug
    Research, might be called his first ""proper"" release, if only because it was
    the first with a marketing push and a wide availability. Even so, it didn't
    move too far from what came before: old folk songs translated to new, modern
    contexts. And a Tears for Fears cover.</p><p>
    Amidon's new album, the ominously titled <em>All Is Well</em> (very little is ever well in
    these songs), again includes new readings of public domain compositions, and
    yet it feels like a great leap forward, thanks to Amidon's more relaxed
    approach and the contributions of composer Nico Muhly, himself a Vermonter.
    Where <em>Chicken</em> was well-meaning but
    occasionally dry, the trio of artists responsible for the record-- Amidon,
    Muhly, and Icelandic producer Valgeir Sigurðsson (<em>All Is Well</em> was recorded at Sigurðsson's Greenhouse Studios in
    Reykjavik and released on his Bedroom Community label)-- create a very specific
    space with these arrangements, which goes beyond simply setting mood and
    atmosphere. These songs inhabit their own world, closed off from the rest of
    humanity. Eschewing the hammy theatrics of indie folkies like Langhorne Slim
    and Two Gallants, <em>All Is Well</em> is an
    exceedingly private album, designed to usher you in and shut out everything
    else around you. It's a headphones album, but not one that relies on studio
    effects to maintain your interest.</p><p>
    It helps that these songs typically traffic in internal
    monologues with a first-person narrator. In ""Saro"" Amidon sings the part of an immigrant
    from an unnamed country who describes the vast land around him and takes both grief
    and solace in missing his true love back home. Later, the singer inhabits the
    title character of ""Prodigal Son"", matter-of-factly recounting his fateful
    homecoming. Amidon sells these sentiments with a soft croak, not unpretty but
    also not expected. Despite his lifelong training, he manages to sound untrained--
    a regular soul comforting himself with music before confronting a bleak world
    again. His voice breaks evocatively when he hits the high notes on Dock Boggs'
    ""Sugar Baby"", conveying the continual ache of a lost loved one: ""I'll rock the
    cradle when you're gone,"" Amidon sings, as if mustering the stoicism needed to
    face the next day.
    </p>
<p>
    Muhly's arrangements prove decidedly more modern, drawing
    inspiration from the repetitions of Philip Glass, the drones of Max Richter,
    and the flutteriness of Sufjan Stevens. ""Little Johnny Brown"", a folk tune popularized
    by Ella Jenkins in the 1960s, percolates with ambient noise-- fragments of piano,
    pots and pans percussion, unidentified thumps-- that coalesces into a calamitous
    drone. Surprisingly, it works. Throughout <em>All
    Is Well</em>, Amidon, Muhly, and Sigurðsson slow these songs considerably, but the
    curious instrumentation ensures they never lose momentum. Banjo and spoons
    generate tension on ""Fall on My Knees"" as a lone fiddle swirls in the
    background, and ""Wild Bill Jones"" and ""O Death"" are anchored by mournful horn fanfares
    and sustained piano notes that fade in and out between Amidon's vocals. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>All Is Well</em> is
    sequenced so that the uptempo tunes crowd the album's middle section, offsetting
    the gravity of what comes before and will come afterwards with a pair of
    celebratory songs. Flickering woodwinds and heavy strings add a sense of
    theatrical expectancy to the relatively spry ""Wedding Dress"" and ""Little
    Satchel"", which complement each other nicely and give a hopeful spin to an
    otherwise grave album. Occasionally, Muhly's score sounds too busy for such
    modest songs, but mostly the instruments interact so closely with Amidon's
    understated vocals that the arrangement and the performance become
    indistinguishable. This quality makes <em>All
    Is Well </em>a very forward-thinking album, despite its reliance on traditional
    tunes. With his team of musicians working so closely together, Amidon doesn't
    just update the old world to the new, but finds the roots of the new world in
    the old.

    Ross Johnson isn't much of a singer. He's a talker, taking
    the stage to rant and howl and generally hold forth on life, booze, women,
    music, booze, women, and death. For thirty years he's has been a mainstay on
    the Memphis roots punk scene,
    starting as a drummer for the locally famous Panther Burns and as a cohort of
    post-Big Star Alex Chilton. That's Johnson ranting on ""Baron of Love Pt. I"" on <em>Like Flies on Sherbert</em>. Over the years
    he has played in groups that could barely be called bands, like the short-lived
    Our Favorite Band, American Musical Fantasy, and the even-shorter-lived Young
    Seniors. <em>Make It Stop! The Most of Ross
    Johnson,</em> from Memphis-based Goner Records, is his first ""career""
    retrospective, featuring 24 tracks that include an assortment of sloppy covers,
    inspired digressions, and gloriously messy rockabilly and garage-band riffs served
    up like local delicacies. If you were to ask him, Johnson would likely say the
    comp doesn't warrant your money or your time. ""The main feeling I have when I
    listen back to these pieces (I won't call them songs) is discomfort,"" he writes
    in the liners. ""I loved recording them, but I can't listen to them without
    cringing and feeling ashamed.""</p><p>
    The self-denigration continues: ""To be a real musician takes
    a certain amount of conceit and bravado that I just don't have. Oh, I've got
    plenty of sociopathic nerve when it comes to performing."" Thank God he's not a
    real musician. A ""real musician"" wouldn't be able to turn his middle-class
    autobiography and mental and moral ailments (both real and imagined) into
    Southern monologues that are simultaneously hilarious, uncomfortable, and
    tragic. ""So I says to her, 'What part of I have a personality disorder don't you
    get?'"" Johnson exclaims on the short, stubby live track ""My Mission"", then
    admonishes the crowd: ""Ya get it? You should be ashamed! Man, I hope I make
    somebody feel uneasy, 'cause that's my mission."" No critic could put it more
    succinctly, although Johnson himself lists critic on his c.v. (he wrote for <em>Creem</em> when Lester Bangs was editor).
    How's this for uneasy? The virtuously obnoxious ""Signify"" begins with this
    confession: ""Did you ever get drunk at your daughter's birthday? I have. Ah
    boy. I got caught, too!"" The matter-of-factness of his delivery makes you
    believe he speaks from personal experience.</p><p>
    That Johnson, a self-described ""Southern sissy,"" has managed
    to eke out what some might call a career from his hysterical ravings is
    testament to his onstage charisma, his singularly ""sociopathic nerve."" Even
    when he's talking about being ten and seeing his first naked girl (one of the
    twelve-year-old twins next door, on ""Nudist Camp""), he's always funny,
    charming, dignified-- not to mention a little taken aback at his own
    self-destructive tendencies. This self-realization makes him ultimately
    sympathetic and in turn earns him the loyalty of local musicians like Jay
    Reatard (who mastered this comp) and Monsieur Jeffrey Evans (with whom Johnson
    currently plays) as well as writers like Robert Gordon (author of the
    indispensable <em>It Came from Memphis</em>)
    and Andria Lisle, who recounts booking Johnson as an opening act for
    unsuspecting groups like Smog and Palace Bros. Wish I could have seen that.
    </p>
<p>
    Currently a librarian at the University
    of Memphis, Johnson is not acting
    the rock star part, but simulating and satirizing it. He realizes that between
    his talents and the rock star ideal lies a vast, unbridgeable schism, and whenever
    he tries to play down his reputation as an object of notoriety, he does so with
    such grizzled <em>savoir faire</em> that he
    only feeds the legend. As a rock antihero, what makes Johnson special is
    precisely his lack of talent-- which impels him to redefine what it means to be
    a real musician. He challenges our expectations, parodies our need to know the
    person behind the song by giving us too much of himself, by going waaaaaaaay
    too far. These chunks of autobiography are as grossly revealing as GG Allin's
    shit, Sid Vicious' bloody chest, or Iggy Pop's cock, and yet, Johnson doesn't
    appear to be exaggerating or gratuitously exposing himself. Instead he's storming
    the castle through a back entrance, a beer bottle in one hand and a spittle-wet
    mic in the other. He knows he can't bring the fortress down, but he can be better
    heard shouting from the turrets. Mission
    accomplished.

The band's frontman, ex-Propagandhi bassist John K. Samson, shares the literary storytelling and slightly nasal vocals of such singer/songwriters as the Mountain Goats' John Darnielle, Darnielle collaborator John Vanderslice, and (well, except for the nasal bleat) his own wife, Christine Fellows. As with Darnielle after he ditched the boombox for an actual studio, Samson's biggest challenge has always been coming up with musical accompaniments that live up to his expertly rendered narratives-- a task at which the Weakerthans, even at their best on 2000's <em>Left and Leaving</em>, have only partly succeeded. Like its predecessors, <em>Reunion Tour</em> sets Samson's brainy, sensitive lyrics to direct, melodic post-Built to Spill indie rock, with occasional alt-country twang. But the album still reads better than it sounds, and even on paper only sometimes lives up to past glories.</p><p>
    Samson spins his yarns out of intense, intimate details, and when the greater fabric is as vibrant as those densely wrought fibers, <em>Reunion Tour</em> can be almost the match of those other musical storytellers' recent records. Witness the lonely bus driver of opener ""Civil Twilight"", who tries to take his mind off of lost love by reciting ""the names of provinces or Hollywood actors/ Oh, Ontario, oh, Jennifer Jason Leigh."" On ""Relative Surplus Value"", a businessman heads for the airport, his ""heart pumping pure mini-bar""; after he recounts losing his job, the song ends with a roundabout, conversationally phrased plea for help. ""Tournament of Hearts"" borrows its title from former Weakerthans tourmates Constantines' most recent album (which borrowed its name from the Canadian womens' curling championship), for a power-chord propelled vignette of a man shouting his insecurities at the yellowed sports championship banners on the bar wall.</p><p>
    On ""Plea From a Cat Named Virtute"", from 2003's <em>Reconstruction Site</em>, Samson challenges another diffident protagonist to overcome his lack of self-confidence-- all from the point of view of a cat. The feline returns on <em>Reunion Tour</em>'s ""Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure"", building from keyboards and shuffling drums to a scraggly, dueling guitar solo on the album's most emotionally charged moment (at least if you like cats). But ""Hymn of the Medical Oddity"" is a midtempo plodder that makes more sense if you know it's about a man who was sexually reassigned at birth and ultimately committed suicide. And ""Elegy for Gump Worsley"", about a late hockey player with a rich punk-rock history, is an overwrought spoken-word piece that exposes how much the entire album has in common with book readings, not just rock tours, reunion or otherwise.
    </p><p>
    ""Got more faults than the state of California/ and the heart is a badly
    built bridge,"" Samson sings on finale ""Utilities"", over weeping steel
    guitars. ""Make this something somebody can use,"" he adds. It's to the
    Weakerthans' credit that their lyric-driven songs can be, in a way,
    useful, at least by helping reassure the sentimental souls with whom
    Samson's deftly told stories resonate. Still, they're rarely as
    striking here as on the groups' previous albums. And even when the tales bear retelling, the staid accompaniment limits <em>Reunion Tour</em>'s potential utility in a medium that's-- how did Gary Cherone put it?-- more than words.

A good educational record has to make kids want to hear it over and over, until the intended lesson sinks in, but it also has to make their parents not want to stab themselves in the ears on the thirty-seventh play. They Might Be Giants found a new niche for themselves with their second children's album, 2005's <em>Here Come the ABCs</em>: Their goofy-little-tunes engine was on precisely the right setting to hold the attention of goofy little people, and the formal constraints of writing songs about letters and the alphabet spurred the Johns' inventive impulses. There were still too many half-developed throwaways, but they came through with some genuinely funny conceits like ""Can You Find It?"" and ""Alphabet of Nations"", the latter of which actually ended up on their set lists at shows for grown-ups.</p><p>
    The video version of <em>ABCs</em> went gold, so they've come through with a sequel-- this time, naturally, it's a set of songs about numbers. The high water mark in that category is still <em>Multiplication Rock</em>, an ingenious set of three-minute tunes written by Bob Dorough for the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" Saturday-morning cartoons in the early 70s: perhaps you've heard De La Soul sampling ""Three Is a Magic Number"" or the Lemonheads' cover of ""My Hero, Zero"". TMBG's number-songs, though, aren't anywhere near as neatly crafted, and the problem comes down to the fact that they simply aren't math guys. They're language guys, and they only really have a use for numbers as linguistic constructs. Dorough's <em>Multiplication Rock</em> songs worked because they were about the mathematical properties of numbers, and the Giants' mostly just incorporate the names of numbers. The lyrics to the John Linnell-sung ""Figure Eight"" cover the same territory as the Dorough song of the same name-- that ""skate"" rhyme is, admittedly, pretty obvious-- but Dorough also managed to throw in its multiplication table all the way up to 96, and TMBG don't get much beyond the shape of the numeral.</p><p>
    If there's a song from <em>123s</em> that the Giants' older fans are likely to embrace, it's probably ""Seven Days of the Week"", a deeply daffy singalong in praise of indolence with the parping, galumphing beat they adopted back in the ""Particle Man"" days. Beyond that, the keepers are ""Eight Hundred and Thirteen Mile Car Trip"", a headlong one-minute rocker, and ""Nine Bowls of Soup"", a deadpan conversation with an icthyosaur that's a conceptual cousin to Ivor Cutler's ""Bicarbonate of Chicken"" and also gives John Linnell the excuse to sing ""icthyosaur"" repeatedly. </p><p>
    The rest, though, is a wearying slurry of not-quite-clever-enough lyrics and brightly colored plastic genre pastiches-- Giants by, well, numbers. ""Zeroes"" starts with a cute bossa nova riff but never goes anywhere with it; ""High Five!"" does the same thing with Eurodisco, and throws in a bridge copped from Devo; ""Ooh La! Ooh La!"" is dreadful fake jumprope funk. The title of ""Triops Has Three Eyes"" is almost its entire conceit (near the end, it's replaced by ""tripods have three legs""). ""Ten Mississippi"" might be passable as a bit of ""Sesame Street"" filler-- three funny voices singing ""one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi..."" in turn-- but it's hard to bear more than once. To their credit, the Johns perpetually sound enthusiastic. (""I don't even know Spanish! But I'm gonna sing it in Spanish!"" declares John Flansburgh in the middle of ""I Can Add"", before doing just that.) But every bouncy tunelet whose catchiness isn't paired with depth or wit lowers the most crucial number on the album, its Parental Ear-Stabbing Index.  </p><p>
    There's also a DVD version of the album, featuring cute animated (and felt-puppet) videos for all of the songs. The two-year-old critic in the house sat raptly in front of it, although he lost interest during the two TMBG-written Mickey Mouse jingles tacked on at the end (regrettably, they're also on the CD). Then he asked to hear <em>Multiplication Rock</em> again.</p></div>"|11132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11132-here-come-the-123s/|5.2|Douglas Wolk

To them, Dead Meadow made (I'm paraphrasing from hazy memory) ""blunted head-nod shit."" And so, for at least a few, the D.C. band's endlessly languid psyche-rock riffage made them functionally pretty similar to, say, Pete Rock. Like Pete Rock, Dead Meadow have spent years working variations on an introverted thump, switching up their endless-repeat rhythmic ebb and flow just enough to stay interesting. Running out of ideas has never really been a problem for these dudes, since ideas are not their stock and trade. They make a dreamy shoegaze-informed strain of early-1970s blooz-choogle power-trio rock, and that's all they've ever made. But now they're 10 years and five albums into their existence, and at this point, it's hard to stay patient with this stuff. At their live shows, Dead Meadow sound gorgeously heavy for the first 20 minutes or so and then progressively more boring for every minute afterward. By now, their albums are starting to work the same way, and that's sort of a problem.</p><p>
    Since the release of 2005's <em>Feathers</em>, the band has relocated from D.C. to L.A. and returned to being a trio after additional guitarist Cory Shane came and went. Listening to <em>Old Growth</em>, though, there's barely any indication that anything has ever changed for this band. They've curbed some of their most indulgent impulses; there's no equivalent here to ""Untitled"", the 14-minute jam that ended <em>Feathers</em>. And they've made a few fruitful inroads into Espers-esque acoustic acid-folk; the vaguely Middle Eastern flourishes of ""Seven Seers"", in particular, stand out from an otherwise indistinguishable set of watery ambling riffage. It's weird how Stephen McCarty's drums seem to bang harder when they sound like they're being played on a phone book rather than on actual drums.</p><p>
    For the most part, though, <em>Old Growth</em> is exactly what this band has always done. The guitars lazily sprawl skyward, the bass burbles steadily, the cymbals splash. As autopilot as this band can be, there's always <em>something</em> there: A nice longing vocal melody, a beautifully assured guitar solo, a droning Mellotron that sets everything else off just right. But the record is dominated by nodded-out midtempo chugs like ""I'm Gone"" and ""The Great Deceiver"" and ""Hard People/Hard Times"", the last of which features some awfully incongruously angry protest lyrics even as the music exudes something less than apoplectic rage. Dead Meadow can write songs like these in their sleep, and they probably do.</p><p>
    Tidal drift is nothing new to this band. They've never made anything that much resembles metal, mostly because they've always buried their Sabbath-stomp riffs under layer upon layer of sleepy reverb and because Jason Simon's voice is a dead ringer for Jason Pierce of Spiritualized's icy nasal monotone. Inertia's always been there in the music, but it's never made its presence felt quite as much as it does on <em>Old Growth</em>. And so the album's standout moment is the only one where they show some teeth. ""'Till Kingdom Come"" is a slow, woozy jam, and nothing immediately sets it apart from anything else here. But then you notice that the central riff is genuinely heavy, that the band seems locked-in and alive. Drugs and diffusion will always be big parts of Dead Meadow, but those things can exist alongside discipline and purpose. It'd be nice if they just seemed a little more, I don't know, awake.</p></div>"|11126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11126-old-growth/|6.5|Tom Breihan

But ""jingle writer"" is his most salient CV line regarding his new album, <em>Sex Death Cassette</em>. It's an eclectic reel of curios and bagatelles that stick in your head the way good jingles do, though since they aren't selling anything besides Rafter's sensibility, their compositional craftiness is wedded to a lo-fi humility. Some of them are just little jags of inspiration: ""I Love You Most of All"" is a half-minute refrain for spooky falsetto and awkward acoustic guitar, like a lost Shudder to Think interlude. ""Cuddling Raccoons"" is a minute-long burst of handclaps and knob-twiddled garage riffs. And ""Adventures"" is a verse in search of a chorus, with a tripping groove and hearty brass flares making its concise point.</p><p>
    While the brief songs are satisfying fun-- they sound more economical than half-cooked-- Rafter does a good job of building more spacious scaffolding around his little lightning flashes when he cares to. The frilly vocal refrain of ""Sleazy Sleepy"" is parroted by horn line that would've made a nice little mini-song in itself. ""Sleazy Sleepy"" also features the kind of staticky, simple groove-- a simple template ready to receive Rafter's judicious embellishments-- that characterizes the album, from ""ZZZPenchant"", a baggy lockstep with snapping brass banners, to ""Love Time Now Please"", a Caribbean cameo with more of Rafter's beloved, jubilant horns.</p><p>
    The album's title is two-thirds red herring: It has indie rock's typically circumspect relationship to sex, and good luck finding it on cassette. ""Death"" is the key word here, as the lion's share of these overcast yet stubbornly sunny songs revolve around it, albeit usually in a playful, almost irreverent manner. This is largely because Rafter practices a sort of laughing-to-the-gallows eschatology; he rages against the dying of the light with a smirk. ""They left us here to die,"" he sings on ""Asking"", ""but we're not ready to die!"" The sentiment is exactly opposite to the one prevailing in current big-ticket indie rock, exemplified by the Arcade Fire, where the magnitude of the end of self is tacitly conflated with the magnitude of global apocalypse.
    </p><p>
    Rafter doesn't wallow in, despair of, or mythologize death; he healthily accepts it as a natural and absolutely necessary facet of life, which perhaps explains how such a death-obsessed record can be so innocent of grand statements and undue angst. He celebrates life by acknowledging its brevity. ""Life is good, you can't complain,"" he shrugs during the quicksilver indie-rock of ""Chances"". ""We are the lucky ones."" And on the junkyard indie-blues of ""Slay Me"", he gently chastises musicians who ""throw it all away for a sad melody that you can't even hum."" While everyone needs a sad melody sometimes-- Rafter gets off a few himself, although they're always hummable-- it scans as a subtle dig against the kind of self-serious, dour indie rock that <em>Sex Death Cassette</em> is such a relief from.

Since its 1982 release, the film has gone back to the editing room a number of times-- for separate U.S. and European theatrical releases, as well as an unauthorized <em>Director's Cut</em>. Scott released his own <em>Director's Cut</em> in 1992 that removed the voice-over by protagonist Rick Deckard, and also suggested he was-- <em>gasp</em>-- a replicant. With <em>Final Cut</em>, Scott seems to have settled on the story he wanted to tell: No voice-over, re-inserted footage, scrubbed-up sound, and another possible change regarding Deckard.</p><p>
    Greek composer Vangelis's Golden Globe-nominated <em>Blade Runner</em> score has taken a similarly ephemeral path. The first version released of the film's soundtrack wasn't even done by Vangelis, but consisted of adaptations from the New American Orchestra that Scott disparagingly calls ""muzak."" Vangelis himself didn't release his version of the soundtrack until 1994, and his version included a number of ""inspired by"" pieces, but paradoxically left out a big portion of his score. For the <em>25th Anniversary</em> edition, much of that missing music is finally released.</p><p>
    The 1994 version of the soundtrack appears here in its entirety on the first disc, finally getting remaster treatment after the questionable sound quality of the original release. Vangelis's enduring classics like ""Love Theme"" and ""Memories of Green"" have never sounded clearer or more timeless: stunning synthesized counterpoint to the bleak, noirish landscape of Scott's 2019 Los Angeles. Certainly not as iconic as the title theme to <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, and not as busy or sunny as his late-70s sequencer-driven albums like <em>Spiral</em> and <em>China</em>, Vangelis's score nevertheless effortlessly evokes the seamy underbelly of a futuristic megapolis. </p><p>
    The unreleased material of the second disc is the second treat offered by this re-issue. The disc includes classic works like the piece accompanying Dr. Tyrell's death and the theme to Deckard and replicant Roy Batty's duel. Vangelis organizes the disc much like his original, setting up loose transitions between works and letting themes wash in and out with little discernable chronology. These pieces are of no less quality than the original soundtrack pieces, but they fit more into the background. These stylized impressions are certainly some of the most ambient works in Vangelis's decidedly ambient score. One of two bonus tracks, ""Desolation Path"", appeared in the unauthorized <em>Director's Cut</em> but is given wide release for the first time, and its stark, cathartic synth may just be the best new material. </p><p>
    Given the much-discussed nature of <em>Blade Runner</em>, it's a little confusing that Vangelis tacked on a whole disc of new compositions and didn't just release the entire score. The works on the third disc are certainly fine on their own, a nice return by Vangelis to the synthesized new age that he doesn't compose much anymore. The work on this disc sounds dated at times, and sort-of purposelessly includes muffled spoken-word performances from the likes of Ridley Scott, Oliver Stone, and Roman Polanski. Is it really necessary to include, as Vangelis does on ""No Expectation Boulevard"", actual dialogue of Ridley Scott discussing the <em>Final Cut</em> project? </p><p>
    Little details like this are inexplicably slapdash. There are no liner notes from the composer himself, and only a page of exposition from Scott. The greatest surprise is the unedited main title theme wasn't included. Still, it's a major improvement over a soundtrack that has been, like the film, a narrative in flux. We're a little more certain now of Vangelis's desolate near-future vision, rooted in his ambient and new age roots but rarely sounding like a product of its time. Too bad it's not quite <em>The Final Score</em> we all were waiting for.</p></div>"|11110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/|7.7|Mike Orme

    When Yakuza hits the bulls eye, they bludgeon. ""Meat Curtains"", the opening track on <em>Transmutations</em>, the Chicago progressive metal quartet's follow-up to 2006's <em>Samsara</em>, is one hell of a song. From its opening distorted chords (slow, barely tapped out) and vocalist/saxophonist Bruce Lamont's heart attack-inducing bellow through the nimble but messily clamoring drums, jagged guitars, and sludgy stoner harmonies, it's like a Baroness/Mastodon hybrid slowly flailing for life and moving toward its spastic grindcore-like close. A couple of tracks later, ""Congestive Art-Failure"" finds Lamont doing some underwater gargle before peeling into a heavier slam that reminds me of ""In The Meantime"" when it starts cycling forward, though that's likely weird pesonal residue (it's way crustier than Helmet would've been with their tight-on-the-side cuts and Branca calling cards). The one clean voice/one shredded tongue chorus is also legtimately catchy, like a fucking Neurosis pop song.</p><p>
    What happens when they miss? It's not that they whiff...they wander. I've been living with the album for quite some time and whenever I plop it in my expectations are high after ""Meat Curtain""'s seven minutes and ""Congestive Art-Failure""'s quick jabs. Somewhere around the halfway point, though, when one too many songs have meandered or pummeled somewhat generically or felt like not-grand-enough grand finales, I leave disappointed. It's not that I don't enjoy the excursions: ""Meat Curtain""'s followed by the slower, Eastern-tinged
    ""Egocide"". Lamont plays sax on this one (and on the upcoming
    Nachtmystium album <em>Assassins</em>). It has an almost cool-jazz vibe, only more psychedelic and downcast, and with lines like ""tear out your
    eyes/ So you can see."" It works. It's the first of these sorts of pieces on the record. It's almost eight minutes long and it slays. After you've run into the third or fourth of the smokey, waylaying jams...the initital charm turns a bit into tedium.</p><p>
    It doesn't help that the tracks <em>always</em> alternate slow, fast, slow, fast. The wax on/wax off ends up feeling calculated-- like things are never allowed to flow naturally. This is an actual order: ""Raus"", Isis-style with doubled echo-y
    harmonies, is followed by ""Steal the Fire"", which races by in two minutes and change. Then comes ""The Blinding"", slower but with bigger yowls, wicked atmospherics, more Eastern tunings and ""Existence Into Oblivion"", another fast one (with great harmonies this time). The best of the sax-y slow ones, ""Perception Management"", opens with sinewy clean guitars and after the two-minute intro the moody sax develops and attitude-- by the end of the track's seven-plus minutes, it's shredding in some kinda possessed call and response with the rest of the band. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album's plenty intense. It lulls and then attacks-- but it strays too much to nail things into the ground. Conversely, it's expansive, but only teasingly so. Yakuza have been around a long time, are known for their interest in, and interweaving of, various strains of world music and psychedelia into their metal. It can be totallly gorgeous. The percussion, or one, is always varied, interesting-- Hand drums to oil drums. Each player has a lot to offer: They're great musicians with an interesting sense of space. 
    </p>
<p>
    So, what the fuck? Maybe they need an editor type to tell them where to nip and tuck, where to let it out. Each song has so much in it, you're exhausted, but the exhaustion never goes far enough. Neither path's followed far enough. See the issue? All this back and forth and public self-debate and new math is coming from someone who swears by <em>OV</em>, Asunder,<em> </em>Deathspell Omega, Merzbow, and the La Monte Young back catalog in equal parts. Which is why I'm going into such detail. <em>Transmutations</em> has the ingredients and indulgence and eccentricity I normally love. Too much of the time, it just doesn't get the job done.

    to exploring wonky pop and rock as any of its predecessors. This isn't a
    barrier to greatness: The burbling, slightly skanking electro-pop of
    Fischerspooner's ""The Best Revenge"" demonstrates how well this approach can
    work, seamlessly triangulating ""Being Boiled"", ""Ghost Town"", and ""(Don't Fear) The
    Reaper"". It's also by far the most expansive and expensive-sounding production
    on the disc. ""They belong to a different age"", you might say, but nevertheless

    The Mars Volta discography carries an astronomical risk/reward potential, and so it is no surprise that the band's latest record, <em>The Bedlam in Goliath</em>, is yet another all-or-nothing entity. Pitchfork has tended to be in the ""nothing"" camp: Their first three studio LPs bombed but did so in entertaining and spectacular fashion, clusterfucks of Cedric Bixler-Zavala's incomprehensible lyrical jabberwocky and <em>Rock Band</em> feats of strength.  But every now and again, even we'd catch a glimpse of their undeniable upside.  Few bands in popular modern rock share their technical prowess, super-adventurous listening habits, or K2 conquering ambition.  If they could somehow manage to channel all of it into something other than a tribute to their own excess, even we believe it would probably be totally fucking awesome.</p><p>
    Despite its surface similarities to 2006's <em>Amputechture</em> (decoder ring title, <em>Street Fighter II</em> cover art), it's possible that Mars Volta were finally willing to meet non-converts halfway.  First single ""Wax Simulacra"" clocked in shy of three minutes without a single edit, and while they're still using a compact disc's capacity as a starting point, this time it's broken down into a relatively manageable 12 tracks-- most of which begin with a vocal riff of instantaneous impact.  Of course, this is still <em>Mars Volta's</em> idea of accessibility; having left the earth's orbit sometime in 2003, they can only go further into the cosmos.  If you can commit any of these attention deficit disorders to memory, you're probably in Mars Volta.  If you can explain the concept (something about a cursed Israeli ouija board) without having read any of the pre-release materials, you've recently done drugs with Lil' Wayne.</p><p>
    The general ""pro"" argument for Mars Volta is that they're a true anachronism of the iPod age, but <em>The Bedlam in Goliath</em> goes great lengths towards actually <em>rewarding</em> short attention spans.  Between Bixler's preposterous lyrics (no need to quote them, you've already gotten the idea by now), the fractious time signature switcheroos of ""Metatron"", and Ikey Owens' keyboard globules on ""Agadez"", you'll find plenty of moments worthy of high-fiving, but they lack any sort of meaningful big picture context or contrast. (Oh, excpet for that Israeli ouija board stuff.) It used to be you could rely on them to toss in some aimlessly ambient smoke breaks for variety's sake, but save for the turgid wolf cry of ""Torniquet Man"", <em>Bedlam</em> plays like the true soundtrack to <em>Katamari Damacy</em>, indiscriminate consumption set to a relentless beat.</p><p>
    Opener ""Aberinkula"" is typical of the dynamic assault, erupting like it was in a stepped-on firehose for the past year and proceeding to just get fucking louder and louder until the free-time saxophones confirm the scent of apeshit.  I swear there's a legit funk-metal groove in ""Ilyena"", but Thomas Pridgen doesn't agree.  Ignoring the basic drumming priority of keeping time, Pridgen solos for about six minutes-- or as much you can ""solo"" while the rest of the band does their own thing.  ""Goliath"" has an appropriately mountainous riff and lumbering rhythm, but guitarists John Frusciante and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez deface it with rote pentatonic wah-wah soloing in the same manner people use the word ""like"" in conversation.  And in the most preposterous production trick you'll (likely not) hear in 2008, 90 seconds into ""Cavalettes"", the mix gets fried and then sounds like it's being sucked down a toilet before spitting back up.  And then they squander any WTF impact by repeating it every two minutes.</p><p>
    Bixler comes off the best here; not since Chris Cornell on <em>Superunknown</em> has there been a lead man who can do a more convincing job of peddling obvious hokum through sheer force of primal will.  He isn't as interested as testing the boundaries of his falsetto this time around, and it results in some of the most melodically satisfying tune fragments the Volta have ever come up with.  But he can't leave well enough alone, and whatever restraint he shows on the mic fails to make it to the production board, as Bixler filters his vocals through the last 30 years of voice-manipulating technology.  Obviously, recent developments have caused for reassessment of the effect, but once again, it's a matter of context.  Whereas the robo-pimping of T-Pain or Snoop Dogg at least is juxtaposed with the smoothness of their backing tracks, here it's just another wanky sound effect from a band that can't get enough of them-- Bixler's most recurring guise has him sounding like an insectoid clone of himself.</p><p>
    And I suppose none of this should've been a surprise, but whether it's At the Drive-In's enduring goodwill, a fear of preemptively dismissing the band that could be seen as the premiere 21st century schizoid men, or the brazen conviction with which Mars Volta sell their shtick, they always manage to make you at least second-guess your own instincts.  But consider what the similarly constructed virtuoso collective of Battles have accomplished with their chops this past year-- embracing technology, humor, groove, and concision into something that actually sounds like the future as opposed to the refrying of decades-old noodles in dry ice and snake oil.  I'm sure defenders of the band will champion Mars Volta as a keeper of the prog-rock flame, but <em>The Bedlam in Goliath</em> renders the term meaningless-- the result couldn't be more averse to actual progress in rock music.  <br/>

    Burnt Friedman has a rep for flirting with the funk. Early
    on, his approach and his output-- intricately polyrhythmic, meticulously
    crafted ""hypermodern jazz"" tracks full of shimmering vibraphones and
    cheeky Latin percussion-- often found him branded as an ironist. But his
    productions, whether solo, with Atom Heart (as the duo Flanger), or alongside a
    growing cast of collaborators-- like Root 70 saxophonist Hayden Chisholm,
    improvising/experimental guitarist Joseph Suchy, vocalist Theo Altenberg and,
    perhaps most importantly, Can drummer Jaki Liebezeit-- have never been
    reducible to kitsch. Listen to Burnt Friedman &amp; The Nu Dub Players' 2003
    album <em>Can't Cool</em>: for all the obvious digital traces (oddly truncated
    hi-hats, drum patterns physically impossible for a single percussionist to
    play) there are no winks or nudges. To say that ""Fuck Back"", the
    record's lead cut, is a postmodern take on Afrobeat is hardly to deny its
    ferocity: no matter how many steps removed from the source, urgency remains coded
    in the music's DNA.</p><p>
    Indeed, it's in the collaborative work that Friedman has really dug into the
    groove, particularly on his two records with Liebezeit: both volumes of <em>Secret
    Rhythms</em> offer an approach to polyrhythm rarely heard in electronic music.
    By slowing everything down, the two amplify the wiggle room, leaving more space
    for drum hits to bounce beyond the strictures of quantization, allowing for
    rhythms that restore liquidity to the idea of pulse.</p><p>
    After 2006's sublime <em>Heaps Dub</em>-- in which the jazz quartet Root 70
    performed acoustic versions of Friedman and Flanger classics that Friedman, in
    turn, remixed into 10 tracks of exactly five minutes apiece, a sort of dub of a
    dub of a dub-- Friedman, aided by an expanded cast of characters, returns with a far
    more conventional album. Formally, it's probably the most conventional of his
    career: these aren't krautrock jams or ambient dub meditations or
    electro-cumbia dustups, they're proper songs fronted by a rotating crew of
    vocalists. Longtime Friedman collaborator Theo Altenberg lends a Tom Waits-like
    croak to three songs; Hamburg soul singer Daniel Dodd-Ellis, Berlin's Barbara
    Panther, Funkstörung collaborator Enik and UK broken-beat veteran Steve Spacek
    all guest on two apiece. All of them dusky, throaty singers, they give <em>First
    Night</em> an unmistakably late-night vibe.</p><p>
    The closest reference point might be to the acoustic-guitars-and-edits approach
    to soul practiced by His Name Is Alive on 2001's <em>Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth</em>, which might not be as surprising as it first seems:
    Friedman actually covered ""Someday"" on <em>Can't Cool</em>, and he also
    remixed H.N.I.A.'s ""Nothing Special"" for a set of <em>Someday</em>-derived
    singles.</p><p>
    Timbre and voicing play a central role, because these songs hardly live and die
    by their chord changes: propelled by scraggly guitar figures and dub's
    ruminative bass lines, they remain classically minimalist in spirit, splitting
    the difference between Steve Reich and Roy Ayers' RAMP (or Philip Glass and
    Tony Allen). What makes even the most static of the songs so engaging is the
    way they seem to shimmer in place, as diverse lines of winds, strings, guitar,
    accordion, synthesizers and effects weave porous webs. It's somewhat shocking
    that only two tracks are credited to a session drummer, Root 70's Jochen
    Rückert-- the majority of the record's rhythms are presumably Friedman's own
    programmed creations. If true, it's one hell of a percussive coup; for all
    their understatement, these are among the most sophisticated beats Friedman's
    ever come up with. Like virtually everything on the album, they never call
    attention to their own virtuosity.</p><p>
    The whole record, in fact, has been put together so subtly that at first it may
    fail to stick. For a long time, I thought of <em>First Night Forever</em> as a
    nice, relaxing mood piece, and bided my time for a new Friedman/Liebezeit
    collaboration. But somehow I kept coming back to the album; where most records
    on my review-assignments list find their way back to the shelves, this one
    crept into regular rotation in those rare slots I listen to music for pleasure:
    morning coffee, cooking dinner, the bedtime wind-down. Such domestically
    functionalist music often gets the short end of the critical stick; 30 years
    after <em>Music for Airports</em>, we still have an innate distrust of music as
    wallpaper. <em>First Night Forever</em>'s trick is that it functions on two
    levels at once: behind that calming, rippling, jazzy veneer there are strange
    forces at work, peeling back the wallpaper to reveal a passageway to points
    unknown.

The songs on <em>The Lost One</em>, his second album on
    Birmingham-based Skybucket Records, are all about downtrodden men nursing dark
    thoughts like whiskey, ruminating over marriages, sex, children, jobs, friends,
    life. ""Hair's fallin' out and my back's got a pain,"" he sings on opener ""Pretty
    Girl's Going to Ruin My Life (Again)"" (that parenthetical aside stings like a
    punchline). ""I've been drinking my scotch in my truck in the rain/ I think
    it's a fine way to spend the day."" Like Freedy Johnston, to whom he bears more
    than a passing resemblance, Carroll writes in character, filling his songs with
    the kind of everyday people you might pass on the street, with no bigger story
    than the gradual onset of disappointment and regret.</p><p>
    On the elegantly epistolary
    ""Those Days Are Gone, and My Heart Is Breaking"", which could be a male response
    to Michelle Shocked's ""Anchorage"", a man writes a letter to an old friend,
    catching up on the ""years between us,"" including a failed marriage, an
    estranged son, and a series of go-nowhere jobs. ""I guess the damage is done,""
    he sings, ""and there's no way I can fake it."" Like most of <em>The Lost One</em>, the song works because Carroll never inflates his
    characters' circumstances beyond the mundane and possibly hopeless.</p><p>
    ""There's a mean streak in me,"" Carroll sings on ""Those Days
    Are Gone"", but as dark as these songs may be, Carroll himself sounds like a
    nice, good-humored guy, maybe someone you'd like to have a beer with. He has a
    high-pitched voice that recalls Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and he enunciates
    perfectly with no trace of an accent (the North Carolina native moved to the Pacific
    Northwest years ago). As such, he doesn't inhabit these
    characters, but he certainly identifies with their predicaments and their
    working-class roots. On ""Brooklyn Girl, You're Going to Be My Bride"", the
    album's funniest track, he comes off like a good-hearted blue-collar suitor
    trailing a pretty Vampire Weekend fan: ""I know she's drowning in boys and a lot
    of hipster noise,"" he sings.
    </p><p>
    When Carroll missteps, the cracks become particularly
    noticeable, as on ""Laurie, Don't Go"", which relies on lyrical clichés to force
    a clunky rhyme scheme: ""Don't take my boy,"" Carroll sings. ""What is this ploy?
    He's my only joy."" Carroll claims ""Small Thing"", which appeared on his 2006
    album <em>Love &amp; War</em>, is about the
    Soviet occupation of Berlin, but
    history makes the song sound completely out of proportion with the rest of this
    studiously life-size album. 
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, the mean streak in his lyrics and the softness
    of his voice aren't as irreconcilable as you might think. For the most part, he
    sells these characters as people he's had beers with-- an impression bolstered by
    his modest, but by no means mild-mannered folk-rock sound. Carroll, who has
    played with Crooked Fingers, Azure Ray, Dolorean, and Micah P. Hinson, bases
    all the songs on acoustic guitar, but rustles up harmonica, organ, and trumpet
    when the mood hits and makes the most of his full band on the organ-heavy ""Ramona""
    and the stomping ""Dark Place"".
    An ominous slide guitar offsets his falsetto vocals on ""Burning Red and Blue"",
    and a rickety trap set on the traditional folk song ""Her Bright Smile Haunts Me
    Still"" sounds like the creaking boards of an empty house, as if the owner of
    that bright smile were literally a ghost. Putting his songwriting at the
    forefront, the straightforwardness of the arrangements make his character
    sketches sound believably plainspoken instead of clever. <em>The Lost One</em> is a fine way to spend 42 minutes, and probably
    best served with scotch.

    The worst moment for a record reviewer is the one when
    you're assigned to write about a charity album that it turns out you don't like.
    Even people who don't want to admit that there's no objective standard for
    judging music's quality know deep down that what winds up in a review, at least
    in a forum like this site, is someone's opinion of what they just heard and extenuating
    circumstances are just a side story. My basic opinion of the Cake Sale is that
    it's consistently uninteresting-- it's so stridently middle-of-the-road that
    there's little to get excited about. But I'd be a heartless bastard if I didn't
    make it clear that all profits from this record benefit Oxfam's <a href=""http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Make Trade Fair</strong></a>
    program (this still applies to their U.S. deal with Yep Roc).</p><p>
    The band is really more of a loose collective, helmed by
    Brian Crosby of Ireland's Bell X1, and it includes
    Damien Rice, Nina Persson, Josh Ritter, Rice's former vocalist Lisa Hannigan,
    the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon, Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody, Crowded House
    bassist Nick Seymour, and members of Frames, the Thrills, and Turn, among
    others. Fans of some of those bands may have things to latch onto here-- think a
    softer, plusher Snow Patrol with less memorable songwriting. It was also
    recorded all over the place, with basic tracks done at one point and vocals
    tracked in different countries at different times, which could account for some
    of the lack of energy and sense of interplay that weighs it down. It sounds
    cohesive because the very refined (one might say sterile) production keeps it
    that way, but it can't mask the missing group dynamic.</p><p>
    For my donation, the best track is the last one, the Neil
    Hannon-led ""Aliens"". I can't really get behind the chorus lyric, ""I've been
    speaking with aliens/ They've agreed to abduct everyone but you,"" but the way
    it's delivered, piped-in choir and all, makes it far and away the record's most
    dramatic and lasting moment. It's the unselfconscious way it embraces its
    cheesiness that makes it endearing-- this is something Hannon's always been good
    at, and he plays it perfectly here. Much of the rest of the record is an adult
    contemporary smear, with xylophone and violin accents at the edges that don't
    add much more than texture and a raft of too-subdued vocal performances that
    allow your mind to wander too easily.
    </p>
<p>
    Josh Ritter does a better job than most of grabbing the
    melody at his disposal and giving it some rhythm and personality on ""Vapour
    Trail"", bringing a sort of country twang to the song that sets it apart-- it's
    also more sparsely arranged than the rest of the record, which gives the song
    some room to breathe and just be what it is. Meanwhile, I had to listen to
    ""Black Winged Bird"", sung by Persson, several times just to remember the
    refrain, and the Hannigan-led opener ""Last Leaf"" never gets off the ground,
    dragged down by a leaden melody. ""Good Intentions Rust"" sounds like a rejected
    Grandaddy B-side.
    </p>
<p>
    As much as I'd like to, I just can't recommend
    this-- good intentions aside, it's pleasant but totally non-descript and devoid
    of energy. In short, it's boring-- if you want to support Fair Trade
    initiatives, you'd probably just be better off donating straight to Oxfam or
    buying one of the interesting <em>Think
    Global</em> comps that have come out in the last few years-- if you're in the UK, you could
    even hit up one of their used book stores.

    The received wisdom on London's Hot Chip is that they're equal opportunity funsters who'll pinch from any old genre in the name of a grin. But after the potent combination of ""Over and Over"", ""Boy From School"", and all the attendant remixes increased their festival bill font size by about 20 points, there was good reason to believe that the London quintet's next record might find them rectifying their cartoonish pop into something sleeker and more streamlined. They might have, for instance, decided to expand on the soul and R&amp;B influences that occasionally pepper their music; or to smoothen the undanceable rumples of their creaky, short-circuited pop with a few well-placed blasts of minimal techno; or maybe, to topple their previous output with an even more dazzling pastiche of color, candy, and complexity.</p><p>
    Any one of those paths would have served Hot Chip well. But of all of their many virtues, focus isn't one, and instead they took them all. A string of self-conscious interruptions, perfect pop moments, show-offy sonics, and inscrutable non-sequiturs, the lovable but flawed <em>Made in the Dark</em> has moments that come off as almost gluttonous-- and that's even by Hot Chip's standards. And while the majority of the material here ranges somewhere between inoffensive and fantastic, momentarily obnoxious misfires (the funhouse mirror horrorshow ""Bendable Poseable"", the impish ""Don't Dance"", and the weirdly overrated ""Shake a Fist"") underscore why ""all of the above"" is not a tenable long-term formula for the band: That level of consumption can't stay charming forever.</p><p>
    Which is to say that Hot Chip have a big record in them and this isn't it. Once you do away with that disappointment, though, there's plenty to appreciate. There might not be anything as definitive or as moment-making as ""Over and Over"" or ""Boy From School"" here, but once you've acclimatized to <em>Made in the Dark</em>'s sonic trills and party poppers, some affecting songs emerge. On the pop side, none are as lovable as the tender-hearted electro of ""Ready for the Floor"", in which the band once again finds comfortable middle ground between Alexis Taylor's balladesque vocal and vibrant, electro-pop dressing. Elsewhere, the feelgood ""Touch Too Much"" cruises by on a big chorus and some characteristically clattering percussions, while the infectious ""One Pure Thought"" opens against a backdrop of gnarled guitar chords and keening synths.
    </p>
<p>
    Unhampered by the otherwise relentless hairpinning subjected to all their uptempo material, Hot Chip's ballads do better service to the band's songwriting skills. With a serpentine vocal melody, a healthy backbeat, and a gently unfolding array of whistles, pinging guitar notes, and reverbed backing vocals, album centrepiece ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"" is an easy highlight. Meanwhile, with its slow changes and melting analog pads, the two-minute dirge ""Whistle for Will"" provides Low-style gravitas, closer ""In the Privacy of Our Love"" flirts with gospel, and the album's title track is an exercise in lazy, Sunday morning soul. 
    </p>
<p>
    On paper, those individual components read like they might make for a patchy, turbulent record, and to be honest, that's pretty much how <em>Made in the Dark</em> plays. For all the talk about them being genre agnostics, they're just as beholden to everyday rules of pace and structure as anyone else. So: Good record but not a great one. By the time you see them this summer, they'll have it sorted out.

    Back in 1978, Konono No. 1-- going under the unabridged name
    Orchestre Likembé Tout Puissant Konono No. 1 (All-Powerful Likembé Orchestra
    Konono No. 1)-- was one of four bands recorded for a compilation called <em>Zaire: Musiques Urbaines a Kinshasa</em>.
    Their contribution, a stunning and absolutely epic 26-minute track called
    ""Mungua-muanga"" vividly illustrated the sound we associate them with today. Except nobody had a chance to
    notice-- the compilation didn't come out until 1985 when Ocora finally released
    it, by which time the music industry had already constructed its world music
    ghetto.</p><p>
    It's intriguing to think about what might have happened had
    that record been released in 1978-- the conditions were so ripe for something
    like this to catch on. Punk was giving way to post-punk, many of whose
    exponents incorporated global sounds into their own; punk also lionized the DIY ethos, and there's no band more DIY than Konono No. 1. How many
    punk bands have made their own microphones out of carved wood and car parts? As
    it happened, it took all the way until a few years ago for Vincent Kenis of Belgium's venerable Crammed imprint to find the
    band still hard at work on the streets of Kinshasa,
    plying their roughly amplified folkloric trance music for the citizens of Congo's
    bustling capital.</p><p>
    Kenis offered them a chance to record again, and this time,
    everything happened as it should have the first time: When Western audiences
    heard the band's whirlwind sound of chanting, scrap-metal percussion, and
    slightly distorted electric likembé (thumb piano), they were widely embraced as
    the unique and powerful band they are. Their music, which was never intended to
    be avant-garde, fit perfectly at the heart of the experimental rock and
    electronic music scenes without even trying to. <em>Live at Couleur Café</em> captures them at the Belgian festival of the
    same name and also gets them at their fiery, swirling best.
    </p>
<p>
    If you're not already familiar with them from their previous
    two albums, this is as good a place as any to get acquainted. All but three of
    the songs are new, and the interplay between the musicians is ultra-tight. The
    three likembés swarm around each other, deftly working off of
    bouncing rhythms played on a combination on snare drums and scrap metal. Leader
    Mawangu Mingiedi, now in his 70s, controls the stage, leading call-and-response
    chants with the dancers. The show's most climactic moment comes when the
    storming version of ""Mama Liza"" thunders to a close, its outro serving as the
    intro to ""Mama Na Bana"", an 11-minute flurry of relentless polyrhythms and
    virtuoso likembé playing.

    About the only thing better than listening to this record
    would be to stand a few feet from the band's gigantic megaphone while they
    played a show. It's fun enough just to look at the Mad Max assemblage of gear
    they bring to the stage, but to hear the sound they can make with it really
    knocks you on your ass. They may have found their global audience a couple
    decades later than they should have, but Konono No. 1 have nonetheless earned it on the merits of their music.

    Five minutes into ""Sing Your Own Song"" a woman starts
    yelling at you. She's encouraging, like mom but angrier, like traffic. And her
    wording is awkward, so like church, too. ""You are a natural-born music
    maker in the chief position of your life! The music and lyrics within your soul
    anxiously await to be expressed in sound!"" Under the
    up-with-people-and-feelings sermon Tom Greenwood and whoever comprised Jackie-O
    Motherfucker that week gnash on electric guitars and set Slinkys down
    staircases. The whole thing feels like that episode from ""Funkadelic: The
    Sitcom"" where Eddie Hazel hung out with Swamp Thing against his parents'
    wishes. The remaining three tracks of <em>Valley of Fire</em> suggest that the
    music and lyrics within Greenwood's soul are rarely as dynamic and far-reaching
    as ""Sing"" but surprisingly do aim for the same brand of uncalculating
    emotion.</p><p>
    JOMF unfortunately no longer have an ear for true sonic disruption, and of
    course it would have been awkward if yelling woman had gone on like ""You
    are a modestly revered post-rock veteran of some influence! You used to record
    turntables and construct amateur choirs and pawn off important pieces of
    American musical history!"" which is probably what Greenwood actually needs
    to hear. To his credit, he injects <em>Valley</em> with enough subtle
    idiosyncrasies-- Public Enemy is hilariously credited for its contribution to
    20-minute jam/chant closer ""We Are/Channel Zero""-- that it outpaces
    its predecessor, 2005's almost sycophantically reverent <em>Flags of the Sacred
    Harp</em>.</p><p>
<em>Valley</em> smartly sandwiches two slowly plucked sub-folk tracks between
    ""Sing"" and ""We Are/Channel Zero"". On ""The Tree""
    Greenwood re-imagines the Beach Boys' static, muddy dirge ""The Day in the
    Life of a Tree"" as... a static, muddy dirge with acoustic guitars. It's a
    great fit lyrically, though, as Greenwood contentedly mutters, ""Trees like
    me/ Weren't meant to live/ If all this world can give/ Is pollution and slow
    death,"" repeating the last phrase as someone slowly approaches harmony
    behind him. The Greenwood-penned title track is a pleasant intermission hummed
    in baritone, sweeter and less substantial than should be allowed of a band with
    ""motherfucker"" in its handle. Sequenced after these two relaxants, the ""We
    Are/Channel Zero""'s improvised jam jumps off the plastic, roughed up by
    spurious snare patterns and smeared by Greenwood and Inca Ore's Eva Salens'
    sailing voices. Tough to definitively say that it's <em>not</em> a proper
    meditation on a 1988 hip-hop song about media and vacuity, so give JOMF the
    benefit of the doubt on one of the best long form piece they've submitted in
    years. </p><p>
    Back to ""Sing"", then, which comes by its religious overtones
    honestly, the product of Greenwood's collaboration with Salens and
    Charlottesville preacher/author/poet Uriah J. Fields. Fields operates the
    Beautiful Living website, which invites you to learn about ""Three
    important books by Uriah J. Fields"" alternately about race relations and
    God. This sort of unconscious emotionalism persists throughout <em>Valley</em>,
    in ""Sing""'s earnest declarations, in Greenwood's po-faced deliveries,
    in a Beach Boys song about an outwardly depressed tree. Even the free-form jam
    is given purpose via its title and writing credits, no matter the vagaries of
    execution. <em>Valley</em> nabs the musical pieces of JOMF's dedicated free-form
    past and recent fondness for public domain hymns, but its refreshingly
    embarrassed affectations are its own.

    While similar tastes and inclinations often transfer from one generation to the next, the passage of actual talent from parent to progeny is far from a guaranteed thing. While a famous last name can at least help you fake it, Julian Lennon sure ain't living off royalties from ""Valotte"".</p><p>
    Crowded House's Neil Finn is another musician living off the legacy of Lennon, albeit more indirectly. But as the frontman for Crowded House and former pop anchor of Split Enz, Finn is one of only a scant handful of songwriters completely indebted to Lennon and the Beatles as a whole who has successfully placed his own stamp on such a tried and true melodic passport. You can hear the Beatles in nearly everything he does, but first and foremost you hear Neil Finn.</p><p>
    That son Liam follows closely in dad's footsteps will surprise no one. The question is, exactly when did Liam realize his talents fell so closely in line with Finn senior? As recently as 2004, Liam and Neil were even covering the Beatles' ""Two of Us"" together on the <em>I Am Sam</em> soundtrack (albeit only as an import-only bonus track). Preceding that (public) collaboration, the younger Finn had been getting his ya-yas out in the forgettable alt-rock act Betchadupa, an aggressive riposte to dad's classy pop. He's since toured as part of Finn's band and, more recently, Crowded House proper, where as an opening act Liam also got to show off his one-man-band skills, as well as songs from his excellent debut <em>I'll Be Lightning</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    It's uncanny how much Liam Finn recalls Neil Finn not just vocally, but also lyrically and melodically. Yet while Liam may sound a lot like Neil (and the Beatles, for that matter) on songs like ""Energy Spent"" or ""Music Moves My Feet"", he's not exactly aping him. As the tune goes, it's only natural, and besides, Liam's got a few things going for him that even dad doesn't.
    </p>
<p>
    Production-wise, <em>I'll Be Lightning</em> (recorded in Neil's studio with Liam behind the boards) shows the younger Finn has learned a few tricks from dad's friend Tchad Blake. Odd instrumental touches crop up throughout the album, and there's a welcome layer of grit and murk to even the prettiest songs here, lovely stunners like ""Fire in Your Belly"", ""Lullaby"", and ""Remember When"". When layers of Liam's overdubbed background vocals swell up in the immaculately arranged ""Wise Men"", the result is like discovering a lost chorus setting on a creaky old Chamberlin.
    </p>
<p>
    Liam's no snotty punk, but there is also a welcome looseness to songs such as ""Better To Be"", ""Lead Balloon"", ""This Place is Killing Me"", and even the lopsided ballad ""Wide Awake On the Voyage Home"" or the wistful ""Second Chance"". These songs are neat but not tidy, coming across a bit bashed out despite the conspicuously perfect placement of all their parts. And that's where Liam's relationship (both literally and figuratively) to his father really comes to the fore. Liam is just 24. At that age, Neil had yet to leave Split Enz and strike out on his own, yet here's his son who already seems to have absorbed a career's worth of musical lessons in half the time. Dad must be pretty proud, but at the same time, one can only imagine he's keeping a close competitive eye on the kid.

    The indie world's embrace of pop for pop's sake finally ended a nasty, decades-long habit of ignoring the top 40 in favor of navel gazing. There's been some reciprocity, too-- it's just as nice to hear of Arcade Fire fans saving iPod space for Justin Timberlake as it is to hear Timberlake namedrop David Byrne or appear propping up the Flaming Lips. Out of this collision has come the likes of Junior Boys and Fujiya &amp; Miyagi, indie-rooted but pop-friendly acts whose lack of smug, distancing irony (plus ample hooks, of course) is partly what makes them so enjoyable.</p><p>
    There's a potentially so-so album swimming around somewhere in Hey Willpower's <em>P.D.A.</em> It's not impossible to go top 40 without a chance of radio play. Green Gartside isn't the most soulful of dudes, but his pure, honest affection for pop comes through loud and clear with Scritti Politti. At the same time, Junior Senior get such an obvious kick from paying tribute to their funky, freestyling forefathers that their obnoxious pastiches can be downright contagious.</p><p>
    But the stylistic affectations and vocal tics of Hey Willpower (Imperial Teen's Will Schwartz and Tussle's Tomo Yasuda) start out irritating and go downhill from there. The thin, squelchy synths of ""Double Fantasy II"" could be an OK stand-alone goof, but no, it's followed by ""Uh-Uh-Uh"", which seems every bit the joke as Babyface's ""Backdoor Lover"" (credited to Du Jour) from the <em>Josie and the Pussycats</em> OST. Minus the joke. ""Retail Heaven"" features a cheeseball spoken word intro and gratuitously breathy MJ/JT it-hurts-to-sing vocals. The unjustified ""Silent Ring"" is even worse, and if ""Hundredaire"" aims for the conjoining of Prince and George Michael, no doubt those two auteurs would politely decline the honor.
    </p>
<p>
    Hell, that's only the halfway mark. Giving up early, you'd miss the masochistically stupid street-smart turn ""Magic Window"" and the not hot ""Too Hot"". At least a doo-wop foundation gives the final track, a reworking of Architecture in Helsinki's ""Heart It Races"", enough of a novelty vibe that it could probably run inconspicuously over the ending credits of some tween flick, a dubious achievement (assuming you're aiming for more than just a big paycheck): like too much of what's come before it, it's music meant to play when you're filing out and no one's listening.
    </p>
<p>
    If there's anything Hey Willpower needs, it's maybe a little more winking self-awareness. No doubt it's there, but the pop simulacrum is played so straight you can only take it at face value. Timberlake is one of the acts obviously in the sights of Schwartz and Yasuda, but generously speaking, Hey Willpower's debut <em>P.D.A.</em> would at best play like a parody of JT (or JC, or hell, George Michael), were it the least bit amusing. If it's meant to be a joke, it's not funny. If it's not meant to be funny, it's a joke. Neither here nor there, the funklesss would-be dancefloor fodder of <em>P.D.A.</em> frankly comes off D.O.A.</p></div>"|11085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11085-pda/|3.0|Joshua Klein

As Morrissey's solo career hits the two-decade mark you'd think he's earned one-- and so he has, but this is by no means the first draft. In fact, his discographical scorecard now reads: Studio Albums 8, Compilations 6. Though some of these collections have been the result of his label changes, Morrissey's always seemed an obsessive curator of his own work: His career is studded with mixtapes made for himself, whether as monumental as <em>The World Won't Listen</em> or as odd as <em>World of Morrissey</em>.</p><p>
    The outrageously imbalanced <em>Greatest Hits</em> falls somewhat on the odd side. Eleven of its 15 tracks come from the last three years, the career renaissance kicked off by his <em>You Are the Quarry</em> album. Of the five full-length records he put out in the 1990s, one song survives-- the imperiously creepy ""The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get"". It's not for casual fans who want a retrospective; it's not for new listeners who'd like to play catch-up. Who is it for?</p><p>
    If nothing else it's an opportunity to check the state of his art. His basic approach no longer varies much: A comfortable modern rock sound, muscular but curiously unshowy, light on instrumental hooks. The number of great Morrissey songs that are great for a reason other than Morrissey is small, and you get the feeling that's how he likes it. The music he uses these days is designed to give him maximum space-- lots of room for his still-stirring vibrato, his meandering melody lines, and the recurring themes which define his career and his public personality.
    </p><p>
    One of those themes is how potential gets used, squandered, or curdled. How do sweet boys turn into criminals, or pampered kids turn into killers? He's been writing about this since 1989's ""Last of the Famous International Playboys""-- something of a touchstone song, it appears on more of his endless compilations than any other. ""These are the ways in which I was raised,"" the song claims. ""I never wanted to kill, I am not naturally evil."" His explorations of the idea have become starker and more powerful as he's shifted from first-person to third-- the best of his recent songs, ""First of the Gang to Die"" and ""The Youngest Was the Most Loved"", have a sinewy economy, getting quickly to the murderous crux of their protagonists' lives.
    </p>
<p>
    The idea that all this is rooted in a fascination with rough trade has become a cliché of Mozology. Listening to these singles, it seems to be more about kindred spirits: If Morrissey can work out how these destinies became so twisted, he might be able to track his own strange development. This is the other main Morrissey theme-- the singer as a loveless freak of emotional nature, doomed to endless rejection, if not death-- and unlike his lost-boys songs, his explorations of the topic haven't advanced much in 20 years. ""You Have Killed Me"", ""Let Me Kiss You"", ""I Have Forgiven Jesus""-- none of them are bad songs, but they're all more facets of what's become a dulled jewel.
    </p>
<p>
    ""That's How People Grow Up"", one of two new tracks, proceeds along these familiar lines: ""Let me live before I die-- not me, not I."" To be fair to Morrissey, nobody mines this self-deprecating seam as thoroughly or effectively, but when the song's sudden ending flips into the magnificent ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"", I'm reminded of how much wider and fresher his perspective used to seem. The other new track, ""All You Need Is Me"", is much better-- a venomous glam-rock rumble with his haters, accusing them of being more than critically obsessed with him. ""There's a naked man standing laughing in your dreams/ You know who it is, but you don't like what it means"": Who else would sing that?
    </p>
<p>
    The paradox of Morrissey is that he's generally the most confident loner around, and <em>Greatest Hits</em> bears this out, presenting his current work as his best ever. Some would agree-- and surely it's not his <em>worst</em>. Anyone who still cared when he slunk into seeming obscurity in 1997 singing songs about window cleaners and raging at long-gone bandmates must be thrilled by his renewed vigor and purpose. But even if you agree with the sentiment, it's a statement best made in interview rather than by this oddly assorted compilation.

    The past few years have given us scores of adolescently
    regressive males presented as pop culture heroes. In fact, it's become
    something of a cliché even to note that movies and sitcoms typically pit schlumpy,
    carefree, childlike guys against willful, no-fun, grown-up women. Depending on
    whom you ask, <em>Knocked Up</em> managed to
    find some middle ground between the two poles, but it seems to be an exception.
    Until Hollywood gives us a good
    portrayal of the adolescent-leaning female, we have Portland-based Thao Nguyen
    and her backing band the Get Down Stay Down, who specialize in galloping indie
    pop with sugar-coated hooks, a frosting of horns, and a considerable dark
    streak. The 23-year-old singer-songwriter, whose expressive voice suggests an
    earthbound Beth Orton, sings about such youthful concerns as ice cream cones
    and cannonballs off diving boards, but with unexpected maturity, dignity, and
    charm. These qualities make her second full-length, <em>We Brave Bee Stings and All</em>, sound so immediately distinguished and
    spirited. Even that title makes a child's fear sound as epic as <em>300</em>.</p><p>
    At this retrospective time of year, this point of view feels
    especially fresh and significant. Nguyen isn't merely the old archetype of the
    female as innocent naïf, but rather one who takes that youthful vision and
    marries it to a sly and incisive wisdom. Nguyen's is a remembered childhood
    both personal and universal. Describing herself as ""a small kid at the big kid
    table,"" Nguyen has a sharp eye for small, telling details, which could form the
    bedrock of a young adult novel but here inform songs simultaneously life-size
    and larger-than-life. ""We brave bee stings and all,"" she sings on ""Swimming
    Pools"", as her banjo pushes the music to a running pace. ""We don't dive, we
    cannonball."" She beatboxes at the beginning of ""Geography"", whose opening line--
    ""Geography is gonna make a mess of me""-- could be about a long-distance
    relationship or third period.</p><p>
    ""Feet Asleep"", which appeared on last year's Kill Rock Stars
    comp <em>The Sound the Hare Heard</em>, begins
    unassumingly, with Nguyen singing against a folksy acoustic guitar theme, then the
    band launches into a brassy Dixieland-style chorus-- one of the album's fullest
    and most joyful moments-- as Nguyen turns bad circulation into a metaphor for
    romantic complacency. Those horns pop up again more quietly on ""Violet"",
    drawing frowns across the song as she bids farewell to a friend. Throughout <em>Bee Stings</em>, the Get Down Stay Down keep
    the music light and fast-paced, revealing a broad range of styles but never
    boasting about it, and Tucker Martine's suitably slack production emphasizes
    the sharpness of her voice and the playfulness of her melodies. On ""Fear and
    Convenience"", she asks, ""Did he hurt you in a new way?"" Nguyen sounds generally
    curious, even as the darker implications of her question loom over the song. <em>Bee Stings</em> is, in a sense, a
    coming-of-age album, as serious themes underscore her jaunty melodies and adult
    concerns encroach on her summery youthfulness. Nguyen strikes a fine balance
    between the two, but here's hoping she doesn't grow up too much.

If <em>Discreet Music</em> demonstrated the aural wallpaper aspect of the system of overlapping loops (legend has it hospitals regularly piped in the LP during childbirth), Eno's earlier experiments with guitarist Robert Fripp were somewhat less, well, discreet. In fact, in a lot of ways the equally epochal Fripp/Eno albums <em>No Pussyfooting</em> (1973) and <em>Evening Star</em> (1975) brought ambient music firmly to the foreground. Eno would run Fripp's guitar through his rudimentary synth system, looping the guitarist's increasingly abstract tones into a shimmering cloud of sound, over which Fripp would unspool one of his famed liquid solos in real time.</p><p>
    Of course, some 35 years later Fripp and Eno's advances have been boiled down the banality of various effects pedals, bringing their technique into play with just the tap of a foot. Yet no other guitarist sounds like Robert Fripp, and an effects pedal is no substitute for Brian Eno. What Fripp and Eno always emphasized through their collaboration was the human element-- how instincts and input can subtly alter and warp the parameters of a closed system.</p><p>
    Needless to say, Fripp and Eno-- both collectively and respectively-- are revered by their flock. <em>Beyond Even (1992-2006)</em> was originally released as <em>The Cotswold Gnomes</em>, a download-only collection released via Fripp's Discipline Global Music Live site winkingly subtitled <em>Unreleased Works of Startling Genius</em>, and posted fan reviews run mostly along the lines of ""this is the most amazing thing I've ever heard."" Save one: ""I must say, you've got some audacity to charge money for this rubbish,"" writes a lone dissenter, and he's got a point, though not exclusively based on the quality of the music.</p><p>
    The only difference between <em>Beyond Even</em> and <em>The Cotswold Gnomes</em> (other than the title) is that initial runs of the former come with a second disc, reprising the album in its entirety but as a single flowing piece rather than a collection of tracks. Repackaging a previous release with a new name but no new content is indeed a dubious proposition. For that matter, little effort has been made to document the origins of these outtakes, at least none beyond the new title's stated time span. Some tracks sound akin to Fripp and Eno's digital-era  2004 collaboration <em>The Equatorial Stars</em> (itself pretty but also pretty inessential). Others sound more in line with Eno's sometimes abrasive and fitfully funky ""juju space-jazz"" explorations (indeed, the span of the set stretches back to Eno's <em>Nerve Net</em>). But like Eno's own half-assed and aptly named <em>Curiosities</em> collections (compiled from old work tapes by an assistant), nothing here sounds like more than a minimum of effort went into its composition.</p><p>
    That it still sounds occasionally compelling is testament to Fripp and Eno's good taste and talents, and it's easy to appreciate the team's dedication to ambient menace over mere passive mood. In fact, some of the best tracks here, like ""Sneering Loop"", ""The Idea of Decline"", and ""Cross Crisis in Lust Storm"", hint at an aggressiveness neither artist has seemed terribly interested in pursuing as of late.  But at the same time the two, even with nothing left to prove, remain capable of so much more than just the occasional chance studio meeting or one-off collaboration might evince. That the <em>Beyond Even</em> sop is just second helpings of leftovers to begin with only rubs it in even more.</p></div>"|11074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11074-beyond-even-1992-2006/|4.7|Joshua Klein

    There are worse yokes to bear than ""thinking man's metal."" If anything, Sweden's Opeth is surely proud their efforts at combining the intensity of death metal and the pastoral qualities of prog have gone over so well. But ""thinking man's metal"" or not, it's probably not wise to think too hard about what Opeth is up to. Like 99% of music, close scrutiny reveals the seams, and like too much metal, a close look reveals just how silly the stuff ultimately is. No, better to just give in to the thrill of the playing: the tightrope precision, the velocity, the sheer intensity.</p><p>
    Opeth fans have gotten plenty of opportunities to get used to those qualities on the band's <em>Ghost Reveries</em>. The album, originally released in 2005, was re-released with extra stuff the very next year. And in late 2007, fans got yet another taste of the album with a live disc, <em>The Roundhouse Tapes</em>, recorded back in 2006 on the G<em>host Reveries</em> tour.</p><p>
    Yet to the band's credit, <em>The Roundhouse Tapes</em> includes just a single track from <em>Reveries</em>-- the nearly 11-minute ""Ghost of Perdition""-- with the rest of the setlist serving as career overview, welcome to new drummer Martin Axenrot, and sendoff for longtime guitarist Peter Lindgren, who left amicably at the end of the epic tour.
    </p>
<p>
    It's also a showcase for Opeth leader Mikael Akerfeldt, an odd contradiction in the world of metal who is not only adept at vacillating between gentle crooning and harsh growling but seems to equally appreciate the two singing styles. He also comes across one of the most genteel, soft-spoken frontmen you'll ever encounter, at a metal show or not. He's no Cronos or Paul Stanley, but Akerfeldt's polite introductions are almost worth the price of the double-disc.

    ""Do you hear that?"" he asks before launching into a full-barreled ""Ghost of Perdition"". ""That is the sound of a tuned-down guitar...Please enjoy this one.""
    </p>
<p>
    ""Just listen to the title and enjoy the song,"" he suggests, like a good sommelier, before leading into the classical guitar stylings of ""Under the Weeping Moon"", from 1995's <em>Orchid</em> (the concert begins with the strains of Popol Vuh's ""Through Pain To Heaven"", and a lengthy instrumental passage in the middle of the song nods to those mood-minded German prog pioneers).
    </p>
<p>
    ""We were quite pretentious in those days,"" Akerfeldt admits, talking about the band's second record, <em>Morningrise</em>-- the reverie interrupted by him politely telling someone in the crowd to ""Shut. The. Fuck. Up.""-- ""I brought a lute to the recording session, thinking I was going to be a minstrel. It was never used, but this song was recorded nevertheless with the thought of the guitars being lutes.""
    </p>
<p>
    Usually when a band as technically proficient as Opeth hits the road the idea is to replicate the recorded arrangements as closely as possible, if only to show you've done your homework. But the group's first proper live album pushes boundaries further than that, with few of the minor concessions (if they can be called that) that have made their albums more palatable to the casual listener. No track here runs shorter than eight minutes. Five top 10 minutes. ""Blackwater Park"" stretches close to the 20-minute mark.
    </p>
<p>
    No doubt there are some for whom Opeth's prog side gets in the way, but you've got to love any band so unafraid to embrace its inner nerd. Like pals Porcupine Tree, Opeth seems uninterested in courting any single audience, and knowing that they've done things their way gives the group ample ""fuck you, too"" fodder. A live release could have been a ""fuck you,"" but in this case-- especially arriving via the band's old, pre-Roadrunner label-- it feels more like a modest thank you the stave off the wait for the next studio record.<br/>

""Back to Sleep"", a standout track here, has been around since about 2005, and it returns, re-produced, a little more precise, deliberate, and a touch slower than the first version. It was always one of the loveliest, most promising of the band's tracks, a long hangover nap that coddles the listener with a languorous guitar pattern dipped in the sweet, echoed flavor that has come to define the band's sound. But like many of their songs, it has its dingy, frazzled moments-- in this case, a chorus, then a whole comedown that launches back into that brief and deep vacation from prettiness, plunging into a murk that's anything but lethargic. No doubt, these are the emotions that the line ""Go back to sleep"" tried to warn you about.</p><p>
    An energetic continuation of this atmosphere is ""Send Me an Angel"", a cover of Real Life's 1983 hit. Naturally, it's extraordinarily reminiscent of the hazy disco rock that was reemerging when Dirty on Purpose was emerging-- I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness, Kasabian, et al. It's a fun choice-- sexy, grumpy, and nearly fist-pumping; it's also the closest the EP gets to being instantly accessible. ""Airshow Disaster"", the final mark of this five-song set, is vocal-free and breathtaking, delivering all the grit, desire, and passion of the band's debut. Energetic and static-laden, yet firm and controlled, it has more in common with the band's clear influences (My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth), who completely dispersed on ""Angel"" but are otherwise close at hand.</p><p>
    The title track, placed second, is the clearest example of this EP's ultra-comfortable production, heavy with bass, creating a firm, enveloping, Tempur-Pedic experience for the ears. It's akin to the muscular and lustful atmosphere that Electrelane created on <em>No Shouts, No Calls</em>, except instead of adding more cheek-close warmth (an organ), Dirty on Purpose just add atmosphere: the gorgeous, diaphanous guitar that winks a couple of times here, and gets in full swing on ""Back to Sleep"", which follows. The group excels at a drowsy, spare songs, heavy with perceptions and moods. Perhaps to wish for something more from this band-- a little more pop, bombast, or rage-- is to wish for its demise. Clearly, the group has more to tell us from the edge, surveying the muck below.</p></div>"|11081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11081-like-bees-ep/|6.5|Liz Colville

Factor in work with the Bad Seeds, solo albums, Grinderman, novels, scores, collaborations, and 2005's <em>The Proposition</em>-- the brutal, fly-specked Australian western that Cave wrote and (with the help of Warren Ellis) also scored-- and the man appears a veritable cottage industry.</p><p>
<em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em> (directed by Cave's fellow Aussie indie iconoclast Andrew Dominik and beautifully lit and shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins) is, like <em>The Proposition,</em> an eccentric western. But unlike most eccentric westerns, in <em>Jesse James</em> the dread is balanced by a hypnotic, elegiac quality, and the plot's inevitability (see: the title) is tempered by Brad Pitt's and Casey Affleck's haunting and enigmatic performances (the latter has earned an Oscar nod and a ton of critics prizes for his turn as a would-be stalker, as did Deakins for his lensing).</p><p>
    If <em>The Proposition</em> is heavily indebted to the sadistic violence of spaghetti westerns, <em>The Assassination of Jesse James</em> owes much to the impressionistic work of Terrence Malick, and for that it paid a price: The average moviegoer had to work overtime just to find the artful film playing anywhere on the big screen, and even then likely missed it-- which of course meant missing yet another evocative, doom-draped Cave/Ellis score.</p><p>
    With long stretches of no dialogue and a focus on landscapes as much as characters, there's a lot of room in the movie for the cues devised by Cave and Ellis to take center stage. ""Rather Lovely Thing"" (later reprised as ""Another Rather Lovely Thing"", naturally) sets the tone of the film with its melodramatic droning, melancholy piano, and folky fiddle. Meanwhile, ""Song for Jesse"" is the cue that seems to crop up the most in the film, its eerie bells and keys are thoughtful, menacing, pretty, and ghostly all at once.  </p><p>
    A few other passages feature more traditional orchestration; among them, the dark, dreamlike ""The Money Train"", the strings and percussion of ""What Happens Next"", and the bittersweet eulogy ""Song for Bob"".  Others are more abstract, like the harmonium-lead ""Last Ride Back to KC"". ""Cowgirl"" and ""Carnival"" provide a tiny hint of relief from the oppressive moodiness of scene-setters such as ""Falling"" and ""Destined for Great Things""-- the latter's foreboding vibe magnified when you think back to the film's early moments, where the movie's central tragedy is set in motion.</p><p>
    In fact, when Cave makes a brief appearance in the film's waning minutes-- playing a grungy troubadour, of course, strolling the length of a bar as he growls the oft-sung folk tribute to Jesse James-- you almost get the feeling that in some ways it's been Cave, by way of his score, telling the story all along. At the very least, he and Ellis are providing some much needed punctuation when Dominik chooses to, for example, linger on a pained Pitt as he plays James in one of his inscrutable manic-depressive funks. Of course, minus those unforgettable images, the Cave/Ellis score loses much of its vital context, but that's what DVDs are for.<br/></p></div>"|11121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11121-the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford/|7.2|Joshua Klein

    Thankfully, five-dollar music crit adjectives don't fit Montreal DJ and producer Ghislain Poirier's style. So we can torch words like ""gossamer,"" ""delicate,"" ""woozy,"" or ""gauzy."" As Peter Macia said in Pitchfork about Poirier's 2005 <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/21164-breakupdown-bounce-le-remix""><strong><em>Breakupown</em>,</strong></a> Poir's at his aesthetic best when ""frivolities have been ground to dust."" <em>No Ground Under</em>, Poirier's sixth album-- and first on Ninja Tune-- has that same commitment to uncluttered, cutting bass while still packing a full range of machine gun beats. It may also be the best entryway into his work.</p><p>
<em>No Ground</em> is taut, alkaline, and-- in its sharpest places-- it lives up to its title. Poirier still hacks and welds and splices, but instead of throwing around cheap, sometimes irritating digital-dust effects, he redlines instruments to their lab-doctored optimum. On ""Hit &amp; Red"", bass kicks flap and flatten and pump like Andre the Giant's iron lung. When the guitar strum on ""No More Blood"" finishes its one-second loop, it cuts like a razor, rendering what should have been a matte into something lacerating.</p><p>
    Listeners familiar with Poirier's brassy remixes (of everyone from Lil' Wayne to Lady Sovereign), will recognize his favorite techniques, a sort of wish list for contemporary rap instrumentals: Hard, traditional 4/4 drums with a grab-bag of loops that aren't so much mutated as made superhuman. On ""Exils"", the song's strings loop back as they tune, swarming together and whipped into something that resembling the ESG classic ""UFO"".
    </p>
<p>
    Poirier's MC selection skews appropriately to the underground (Chicago's Zulu, Français Ambitieux) just as the album's aesthetic goes the way of fellow po-mo deconstructivists (Weezy, Foster Wallace). He touches on all your tropes and lets his MCs grab for intellectual flash points like so many brass rings: He titles a song ""Diaspora"".  He has an MC shout: ""Lebanon! Up in England! Over Syria! In Nigeria!"" 
    </p>
<p>
    Yet there's something somethingly deeply vivifing about Poirier's blend of spartan yet far-flung sonic DNA and his naked political ambitions. Maybe it's how fantastic he sounds alongside contemporary American hip-hop and how successful he might be hawking album beats to everyone from MF Doom to Redman. Maybe it's because even with his sloppy, earnest political ambitions, indeed nothing about his execution feels frivilous. Maybe it's simply the drum and bell on ""One Hand Can't Clap"" and a dozen other sounds besides.

    Blind Alfred Reed would have hated the world of today. Hell,
    he thought the 1920s were loose and immoral, which they probably were if you
    were born in the 1880s. Armed with a fiddle and a sandpaper voice, the Hinton,
    West Virginia, native called out the gamblers, fast women, high-falutin' men,
    hooch runners, high-tech locomotives, and price gougers, and would
    have been scandalized by a women even running for president and disappointed by
    the idea of Wal-Mart. For proof, see <em>Always
    Lift Him Up: A Tribute to Blind Alfred Reed</em>, which is presented by the West
    Virginia Music Hall of Fame and features exclusively West
    Virginia singers, pickers, and fiddlers like Little
    Jimmy Dickens, Tim and Mollie O'Brien, and Kathy Mattea. Instead of
    sidestepping Reed's staunch moralism, these artists present his lyrics with a
    straight face (except for performance artist Ann Magnuson) and let his
    contradictions and convictions explain themselves.</p><p>
    Starting the disc with the one-two punch of Dickens'
    ""Woman's Been After Man Ever Since"" and Mollie O'Brien's ""Beware"" is something
    close to brilliance, as both songs warn listeners away from the temptations of
    women (""We can plainly understand woman was made after man/ And she's been
    after man ever since"") and men (""He smokes, he chews, he wears nice shoes/ Beware, oh take care""), respectively. Both Dickens and O'Brien wring out all
    the Christian paranoia while keeping the proceedings spry. Reed sang his songs
    like a preacher preaches sermons: His compositions are full of moral
    instructions and warnings, yet to ensure his audience listened and remembered,
    he wrote in a popular vein, drawing from lowly Appalachian ditties to sell a
    higher power. Only Ann Magnuson takes a tongue-in-cheek approach on ""Why Do You
    Bob Your Hair, Girls"", in which she introduces herself as Sister Alice Tully
    Hall (apparently not <em>the</em> Alice Tully
    Hall, which is a building) and has her children sing the jaunty chorus. It's a bit offputting in the
    middle of a generally sincere tribute, but it helps that the song is both well
    performed and genuinely funny.</p><p>
<em>Always Lift Him Up</em>
    does not focus on Reed's finger-wagging exclusively, but includes many of his
    hymns to God as well as to the American poor. The Nichols Family, an a cappella
    gospel choir from the rural community of Swiss, perform a swooning version of
    ""Walking in the Way with Jesus"", accentuating the song's forthrightness with graceful
    harmonies. If his heavenly songs sound hopeful, his earthly songs sound grimly
    pessimistic and extremely suspicious of emerging technologies and staid
    politics. Charlie McCoy's stoically strummed ""Fate of Chris Lively and Wife"",
    about a couple run over by a train, drips with dread and grief: ""They were
    killed/ Engine crushed horse and wagon/ Oh how sad to know they never can
    come back."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Even if they live, the people in Reed's songs meet a fate
    worse than a speeding locomotive: poverty. As vehemently as he warned against
    bathtub gin and flappers, Reed-- who allegedly died of starvation in the
    1950s-- stood for the little guy, singing songs like ""How Can a Poor Man Stand
    Such Times and Live"", here covered mournfully by Tim O'Brien, that tell of such
    everyday troubles and tribulations as the rising price of dry goods, the
    dangers of working in the mines, and the general ignorance of politicians. The
    tribute title derives from the song ""Always Lift Him Up and Never Knock Him
    Down"", here sung by Dwight Diller and John Morris, who preach to hate the sin
    and love the sinner. ""When he's sick and tired of life and takes to drinking/ Do not pass him by, do not greet him with a frown,"" Diller sings. ""Do not fail
    to lend a hand and try to help him/ Always lift him up and never knock him
    down."" Even if you don't agree with all of Reed's steadfast opinions, <em>Always Lift Him Up</em> presents him with all
    his contradictions in tact, and lifts up his generous populism and
    unforgettable tunes as his true legacy.

An artist turned musician, Luke Temple discovered that a four-track layers audio the same way an artist slathers paint, though the former offered him endless chances for reconfiguration. His story, and even this easy equation (""music is painting""), builds the gentle naiveté that runs throughout Temple's second LP.</p><p>
    ""Saturday People"" leads off <em>Snowbeast</em> and it's easily Temple's strongest song and showcases everything that's good about the singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist. Temple's banjo carries the brisk waltz through dynamic shifts that move him from a easy lope to a section of harmonies straight out of an early CSNY record. In fact the lines ""People/ Looking-glass people/ Saturday people/ Will live one final time,"" when sung in that harmony (and perhaps coupled with the over-the-top ""A mescaline freak-out in an off-Broadway show in the morning"") invoke a variety of romanticized and alienated imagery that's snatched straight from a time when squares were there to be looked at and made strange. In that sense, ""Saturday People"" is a period piece, or maybe a period triptych. Aside from the outro, the song's three parts are miniature gems grouped by time signature and quasi-pyschedelic inflections; they refract and reflect each others' brilliance.</p><p>
    ""Saturday People"" is solid through and through, and it's really no surprise that Temple can't keep up the momentum through the rest of the record, the song really is twice as good as anything that follows. Most of the rest of the songs seem to hinge on one melodic idea that comes and goes. Consequently, I spent most of my time waiting for those moments to crop up. In ""Medicine"" an almost-dramatic minor-key melody lends the opening line (""Better take your medicine"") a paternalistic threat that simply peters out as the song progresses, only to revive itself when the hook returns. But it dies away again as it turns out, ""your medicine was love."" Oh. It's always disappointing when a songwriter tries to decode his music for the listener, but when it turns out that the equation is ""x=love,"" there's no hope for redemption.</p><p>
    Yet it's no surprise that the ""answer"" to the question ""What is 'medicine'?"" is ""love."" It's a totally conventional answer, and ""Medicine"" is a conventional  song by design. Another acoustic slow-poke, ""People Do"", follows similar constraints. Though it showcases Temple's strange, lovely voice and those harmonies again, there is little to listen for besides the sheer pleasure of hearing his vocal turn miraculously from bloodless to soulful with just the slightest application of vibrato.</p><p>
    The acoustic tracks are few and far between, though. For the most part Temple favors a melange of tinkling synths and keyboards. When he uses them for their rhythmic qualities, as on ""Family Vacation"", he's on firm footing, threading his melodies through a Timbaland-ish tom beat until the frenetic releases that serve as choruses. ""Family Vacation"" is a fun track, and it's woefully brief. More often, though, Temple uses his keyboards as texturing devices, and he tends to favor sounds somewhere in the range of his voice. This means that a song like ""Serious"", though it's a fine song, suffers from treble overload. The lone bass cannot support the layers and layers of high-end piled upon it.</p><p>
    Temple is a relatively young songwriter and this, his second full-length, shows promise. Its unevenness seems like a result of his struggle with ideas, rather than a lack of ideas worth filling out. The fuller the palette he works with, the better the result. Such a frail, pretty voice needs something to support it, and in songs like ""Saturday People"" where it finds itself in a niche carved out especially for it, rather than adrift on a see of aimless synths, Temple's various gifts amplify each other.</p></div>"|11113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11113-snowbeast/|7.4|Jessica Suarez

Just listen to their music. Or read their lyrics. Or look at their album art, watch their videos, play their records in reverse, expose their press releases to an ultraviolet light source, or-- well, you get the point. Oh yeah, they also occasionally play rock'n'roll, which I hear is this style of music with an accentuated backbeat or whatever, but that's only to receive inspiration to fuck more. So now that that cat's out of the bag, we turn to follow-up <em>Slick Dogs and Ponies</em>, where apparently the sex sometimes goes bad, or at least grew boring enough to force our lotharios into trying new tricks.</p><p>
    While I hesitate to call <em>Slick Dogs</em>'s night vision sex tape cover ""deep"" or ""poetic,"" following their debut's asscrack-on-bathroom-tile smut, it looks like a freakin' Van Gogh. Fittingly, Louis XIV try pretty hard to pass as artists here, as opposed to distilling classic rock libido into something you can simply inject in your ass. Frontman Jason Hill expresses some pathos here, a tad more profound than the pain of getting an erection while wearing tight jeans, but not far off. For an even <em>crazier </em>conceit, the band decides to actually work for their self-appointed sex symbol status, whether via Electric Six-style stabs at lunkheaded disco or big, dumb, ultra-schmaltzy morning-after ballads.</p><p>
    Single ""Air Traffic Control"" gets some sleazy mileage out of the aviation metaphor (""Well you were high when I met you""), but overall the track sounds like an unironic plea for help, especially when Brian Karscig's chirpy vocals kick in: ""Air traffic control/ I've been gone, I've been up away from home/ Now my gear is down, I'm circling round, and I am coming in."" The hushed psychotic thriller ""Stalker"", a surprisingly subtle, clever song, almost encroaches on Gorillaz territory, with Hill doing a pretty spot-on Damon Albarn impression. Of course, the band hasn't been properly neutered, and they're up to their old shenanigans on piss-drunk stompers like ""Misguided Sheep"" or ""Guilt By Association"", the latter announcing, basically, that they're scandalous enough to implicate anyone of breaking the law who's in close proximity to them.</p><p>
    Sadly, while Wal-Mart and Christian censor groups will bristle at these obscene sounds and images, there's really nothing uniquely shocking about Louis XIV, just disgusting or, even worse, plain dull. If they really wanted to ruffle feathers, they'd be championing ideas like ""global warming is a myth,"" not graphic but predictable sex romps or even the half-assed Iraq War rants on ""Free Won't Be What It Used to Be"" (""March out, soldier, the bugle calls""). The sentimental dimension of <em>Slick Dogs</em> only further depicts Louis XIV as an embodiment of everything American audiences just never ""got"" about glam rock. They're dazzled by the hedonistic aspects of the genre-- the (heterosexual) sex, the drugs, the big guitars-- but completely overlook the more complicated nuances. There are no sci-fi or fantasy themes explored here, and <em>certainly </em>no gender-bending. Instead, the slightly more dynamic Louis XIV only give you testosterone-fueled rock at its least appealing extremes: heedless lust or, arguably even more repulsive, cheesy balladry.<br/></p></div>"|11106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11106-slick-dogs-and-ponies/|2.5|Adam Moerder

Not that some other producer couldn't help shape Ben Gibbard's songs and the band's performances into their just-mysterious-enough but still easy-on-the-ears albums. But Walla seems to be the perfect fit.</p>
<p>No question, the guy knows how to make an album. One of Walla's greatest talents is his ability to step out of the way, allowing the attributes of whomever he's working with to shine through while still putting his sonic stamp on things.  Maybe that's why Walla doesn't seem like the type to stew on the sidelines, or complain that his voice isn't being heard, and why anyone expecting Walla's solo album, <i>Field Manual</i>, to unleash some kind of pent-up ego is bound to be disappointed. Beyond the opening track ""Two Fifty""-- an arty wisp that suggests the disc could have been the showy (though not flashy) producer's album some expected-- the most remarkable thing about <i>Field Manual</i> is how generally unremarkable the long-simmering project turns out to be.</p>
<p>Freed from his work-for-hire commitments, Walla has made an album in line with... all his previous endeavors. In fact, with a new Death Cab album already in the pipes, it's hard to know what might have prompted Walla to push this impeccably crafted but insignificant detour through to completion. And why now? Just about every track on <i>Field Manual </i>would fit comfortably somewhere in Death Cab for Cutie's catalog, and Walla's singing voice even turns out to be cut from the same cloth as Ben Gibbard's.</p>
<p>If anything, Walla's a little easier to take than Gibbard, free of some of his bandmate's more twee affectations. What hurts Walla, though, is that on <i>Field Manual</i>, he's hardly whispering sweet poetic nothings. Instead, as promised, there's an explicitly political undercurrent to the disc, and on paper Walla is pissed. As he sings in ""Sing Again"": ""No, this is not a test/ Let's sing again/ Sing together without disguise/ Let's raise up a song in unrest.""</p>
<p>But the track sends a milder message, as its unconvincing mid-tempo pace, bittersweet melody, and Walla's gentle delivery hardly adds up to an anthemic rallying cry. The same holds true for the vaguely Big Star-esque (or Matthew Sweet-esque, or Pernice Brothers-esque) ""Everybody On"", a ballad that could be about the immigration debate. Elsewhere, he addresses the Hurricane Katrina aftermath with typically soft-spoken emo earnestness-- an oddly dissonant approach.</p>
<p>The sensitive act is a better fit for songs like ""Geometry &amp;C"", a pretty conventional alt-rocker, and the romantic ruminations of ""Our Plans, Collapsing"", whose pessimism is subversively paired with some of the album's most grown-up hooks. Sure, there's some muscle backing up ""Archer V. Light"" and ""The Score""-- where finally some actual big riffing supports a bring-home-the-troops missive. Too often, though, Walla takes the easy way out. Obviously, a host of issues-- from downtime to headlines-- compelled Walla to make this record, and his effort shows. What's missing is a compelling reason to listen.</p></div>"|11112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11112-field-manual/|5.9|Joshua Klein

    ""I can't believe my heart"": Tim Midgett offers that thought in the middle of ""Human Out of
    Me"", the sixth track from Bottomless Pit's debut album, <em>Hammer
    of the Gods</em>. Ideally, this album wouldn't even exist. 
    If anything, some of these songs, or the seeds of these songs, would
    have ended up on another Silkworm record-- what would be their 10th full-length. 
    It would be an album full of Andy Cohen's Neil-Young-as-post-punk
    guitar heroics, and Midgett's thick but nimble bass plucking, with
    Michael Dahlquist flailing away at what sounded like the biggest drum
    kit in the universe.  Instead, the woman whose vehicular suicide
    attempt claimed the life of Dahlquist and two others has been
    sentenced to 10 years in prison, and while Silkworm's abrupt ending
    is obviously inconsequential in light of these events, it doesn't
    make the band's demise any less disappointing.  Thankfully for fans,
    Cohen and Midgett are still making music together, and <em>Hammer
    of the Gods</em> is as fine a debut as folks could hope for.</p><p>
<em>Hammer of the Gods</em> is a solemn affair, both
    in sound and spirit.   It's arguably the prettiest record either
    Midgett or Cohen has been associated with, but it's a prettiness that
    comes with a mournful pallor. New drummer Chris
    Manfrin, who had a tenure in Seam, may have fashioned a link between that group's
    shimmering torpor and the angles Bottomless Pit chooses to measure
    out over the course of eight songs. Just as likely, the distance
    the songwriting duo attempts to establish between their new endeavor
    and previous works extends beyond just picking a new band name and
    some new bandmates (Manfrin, bassist Brian Orchard).  Cohen's three contributions aren't dissimilar from what he offered in Silkworm.  But where his lyrical
    fondness for hard luck and harder knocks was usually abetted by
    furious and frequent cone-shredding guitar solos (both on his and
    Midgett's songs), Cohen shows restraint on this record.  He only cuts
    loose on his tracks, and only in brief spurts, making those moments
    of distortion (especially on the war-torn ""Greenery"") all the
    more bracing.</p><p>
    Midgett, on the other hand, forgoes any sort of storytelling
    pretense in his songs, choosing instead to simply come clean with
    what he's feeling.  The lyric quoted at the start of this review is a
    fitting summary  of what drives his five tracks-- trying to come to
    grips with a powerful and terrible event, and how such a thing can
    change you.  It's there in the album's lead-off track (fittingly
    called ""The Cardinal Movements""), when he wonders about
    ""[getting] it in your mind to live again.""  It's there in the few
    lyrics found in ""Leave the Light On""-- ""someday you'll wake
    up.""  It's especially present on ""Human Out of Me"", an awkward
    yet proud tribute to an unnamed person that honors without succumbing
    to treacly sentiment (""you were a king when you knew what you were
    worth""; ""you helped teach me how to talk/ Showed me how to work
    a room"").  I won't attempt to assert that Midgett means the song to
    be explicitly about what Michael Dahlquist meant to him, but it would
    be a fitting tribute if it were the case.  In fact, the entire album
    could be seen as a tribute to both Dahlquist's memory and Silkworm's
    legacy-- a bittersweet yet hopeful remembrance of fond memories, and the hope of more such moments in the future.

I love them so much that I cling to my belief that they're simply miniature, catastrophically insane humans, not evil geniuses from space, despite all evidence to the contrary. Nevertheless, it's no secret to anyone that the little tykes are getting crazier and crazier all the time. Some blame reality television, or MySpace, or violent video games, but I have a pet theory-- their teachers are all too busy recording indie rock into their four-tracks, trying to nail that perfect balance of mono guitar lines and tape hiss, to properly socialize the brood. Seriously, can you imagine Bob Pollard being one of your formative models for responsible adulthood?</p><p>
    Like the prolific GBV frontman, Duncan Sumpner is a teacher whose bedroom dabbling snuck into our earbuds via a side door marked ""outsider artist."" Unlike Pollard, Sumpner's debut album didn't convey the impression that catchy indie rock nuggets effortlessly sifted off of him like dead skin cells. His hazy, lugubrious folk songs were carefully tended moods, not Pollard's weird-pop epiphanies, and while the album was garlanded by the crown prince of new folk, Devendra Banhart, I found the title highly ironic-- where, in fact, were the songs? On his debut, Sumpner was a whiz with tone and color, but to hear one of his sepia-toned dirges was to have heard them all.</p><p>
    Pitchfork<em> </em>enthused over the album, but even we admitted that it ""lacked enough swirling builds and surprises to sustain its initial birr over 10 tracks."" The same cannot be said of <em>Gyllyng Street</em>, which trades early Pheasant's lo-fi folk for expansive, psychedelic shoegaze, with improved results. What Sumpner's voice actually adds to the music remains questionable-- for the most part, it's an unintelligible moan that seems dwarfed by the clear-cutting percussion and long arcs of eldritch guitar. But the music is buoyed up by a newfound flair for drama, unfurling with magisterial simplicity, and while it retains that homespun feel, it sounds larger by several orders of magnitude. ""Boats"" starts off drizzly, but instead of petering out, it limps toward a glistering guitar lead crescendo, while the cascading reverb of ""King Friday"" eventually, through a maze of growling distortion and capering piano keys, hits on an honest-to-god groove.
    </p><p>
<em>Gyllyng Street</em> also makes Sumpner seem more team-player than lone-gunman-in-the-bell-tower. It has a feeling of collaborative spontaneity that you just can't access when multi-tracking yourself, and even loosely arranged songs that resemble those from the debut, like ""The Ballad of Century Paul"", sound livelier. And trumpeter Clive Scott proves to be Songs of Green Pheasant's most valuable player: He scores the record's best moment on ""Alex Drifting Alone"", when his mournful theme returns with ragged emphasis for a weary yet triumphal climax. It's a warm, welcome contrast to the glassy hymns, ""West Coast Profiling"" and ""Fires P.G.R."", that bookend it. If our teachers keep cranking out music like this, little Johnny may never learn to read properly, but at least he'll have some enchanting tunes to succor him through his illiteracy.

These Are Powers' dubbed their sound ""ghost-punk,"" and more than a few rock chroniclers have eaten it right up. But to be fair, there's something to the name. These Are Powers' late 2007 debut <em>Terrific Seasons</em> is propelled by the energy and anarchy of punk, to be sure, but there's something more mysterious lurking beneath the surface. Guitars emulate warping sheets of metal, and drums and vocals alike sound like they're bouncing off the walls of a cavernous abandoned warehouse. Couple these opposite poles of aggression and elusiveness, and sure, why not? ""Ghost-punk"" it is.</p><p>
    Yet as evocative and original a name as that may be, These Are Powers aren't exactly blazing a new path in modern music, and not just because the group recalls some of the tribal chaos of member Pat Noecker's former band Liars. While Liars casts a slight shadow over <em>Terrific Seasons</em>, the disc is most reminiscent of early Sonic Youth, when the skronky noise of No Wave, proto industrial music, musique concrète, ugly scum rock and avant garde experimentation collided and exploded like an underground Big Bang. Sonic Youth, Swans, PiL, Mars, even the Birthday Party-- it's all churning around in here.</p><p>
    That's hardly bad company, and it helps that These Are Powers largely make good on their borrowed legacy. ""You Come With Nothing"" kicks off the album in rousing fashion, with frenetic drums, throbbing bass, and caterwauling vocals coalescing into a condensed, ruthlessly efficient two-minute epic. ""Makes Visible"" is spookier and more hypnotic, while ""Cracks in the Lifeline"" makes good use of still more mysteriously sick sounds pulsing against the percussion. </p><p>
    The bursts of noise, screaming, skronk, and rhythmic terror are often as exhausting as they are exciting, which may or may not prepare you for the penultimate ""Pizza Master Ice Cream Palace"", a 20-minute monster that at times makes what came before it feel like a warm up. Heck, the ten-minutes of vertigo-inducing racket that conclude the track make the 10 minutes that came before that sound like a warm up, too, which is what happens when improv becomes such a key compositional asset. Once you get going there's no stopping the groove, and in fact even at their most discordant and disjointed, These Are Powers do groove. </p><p>
    By the time the twisted-metal (most likely) guitar of ""Nubians on Franklin Avenue"" kicks in to end the disc, it's clear that for all its familiar elements, These Are Powers has over the course of the album managed to scramble out from under the burden of comparison and establish an identity of its own. Yes, you can still hear all those other acts, but you can also hear the core trio of Noecker, Anna Barie and Bill Salas working hard to recombine those strands of post-punk DNA into a wonderfully ugly mutation, the kind you don't necessarily want to bump into in some dead end back alley but one which sounds more than satisfying ringing, clanging and resonating in the comfort of home.<br/></p></div>"|11076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11076-terrific-seasons/|7.2|Joshua Klein

    Now that just about any schmuck with a guitar can make a
    reasonably professional-sounding recording of himself and slap it on a MySpace
    page for all the world to hear, the days of four-track bedroom recording seem
    like ancient history, even though the medium still exists and its heyday only
    ended about ten years ago. Home four-track recording began life as a crude
    means to an end, a way to make that record no one would pay you to make, but by
    the early 1990s, it had become its own ethos, essentially a different medium from
    professional recording studios. It had limitations but also
    possibilities, and an entire indie rock subculture grew up around lo-fi aesthetics.</p><p>
    June Panic recorded about a dozen cassette releases on his
    four-track in the first six years of the 90s, distributed mostly by hand to
    local record stores, friends, and friends of friends. He was adventurous in his
    use of the medium, recording himself and occasional friends on a band's worth
    of instruments and working on a vast array of ways to layer his voice and
    complete a mix. His output ranged from pensive folk to indie rock with the
    occasional spike of feedback, ultra-distortion, or screaming punk fury. Here,
    Secretly Canadian has shown its commitment to its artists by allowing Panic to
    compile three whole discs worth of his cassette recordings, which had been
    rescued from flood waters in North
    Dakota and meticulously restored in his kitchen. They
    also let him narrate the compilation with a set of liner notes that build up to
    a theory that purgatory is where souls can most easily be themselves
    (interesting stuff in light of his spiritually-themed recent output).</p><p>
    Theological concerns aside, the 53 tracks compiled here form
    a scrapbook of Panic's early artistic life that will be interesting for his
    fans and hardcore 90s lo-fi buffs but really no one else. There's frankly not
    much that transcends the medium or begs to be listened to out of context. It's
    a record that really needs to be listened to on a moment-to-moment basis rather
    than a track-by-track one, because the interesting bits are often right up
    alongside tiresome, ponderous, and obnoxious bits within the same song. For a
    quick example, ""Fountain of Youth"" has a nice Spanish-tinged acoustic guitar
    part moving in tandem with a totally forgettable vocal that's undersung to a
    fault (it's rather slurred, actually), and then sticks a lovely, crystal-clear
    acoustic guitar solo in the middle. 
    </p>
<p>
    Panic had a strange penchant for making his already nasal
    vocals even more pinched by speeding them up. He also liked recording loud,
    driving indie rock songs with the guitar pushed all the way into the red-- there
    are quite a few of them scattered across the set, and none of them is
    particularly satisfying. He was much more suited to quiet, tense songs like
    ""There Is a Tool"", which backs up his voice with sparse guitar, mandolin, bass,
    and organ for a floating effect-- it still doesn't have a grabbing melody or much
    else to hang your hat on, but it's at least an intriguing sonic environment. The tracks with exceptionally clear sound and a few comments in the
    liners make it clear that Panic was one of the first to view lack of fidelity
    as a stylistic choice rather than an economic necessity (for him, it was really
    both). 
    </p>
<p>
    It's hard to recommend this to anyone but devotees of the
    lo-fi ethos and extremely dedicated June Panic fans. For everyone else,
    subjecting yourself to the excesses of the set is probably not worth it-- you'll
    find your mind wandering quickly, and the sheer volume of material makes it
    unlikely you'll ever get to know it well without really working at it.

But with Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart everything spills out unmediated and mucky. To put a fine point on it, on <em>Women as Lovers</em>' ""Black Keyboard"", over a serpentine acoustic guitar and synth dirge, Stewart sings, ""Why would a mother say such things/ Why add tongue to a kiss goodnight?"" That line is an attack against commonly held virtues of understatement and discretion, and Stewart's willingness to revolt audiences with squeamish personal details that make him seem more scarily fucked-up than sensitive or emotionally open is what makes his music unique. His art seems to be more about who he is than who he'd like to be, and it's the tension between the mores of taste and Stewart's honesty that brings us back, despite ourselves, time and again.</p><p>
    And, of course, the music itself, a nebulous but forceful concoction of sopping wet harpsichords, detonating percussion, submerged rock, atonal scaffolding, and unhinged electro-pop. Recent Xiu Xiu albums have been less likely to make me feel nauseous than <em>Fabulous Muscles</em> and its forebears, and I figured I'd just gotten acclimated to their approach. But the rawness of <em>Women as Lovers</em> indicates that maybe, for awhile, they'd gotten acclimated to it themselves. <em>The Air Force</em> found Xiu Xiu in full-bore confessional mode, yet it was so mannered that the confessionals lost their seamy edge and verged on pure aesthetics. ""Buzz Saw"" and ""Boy Soprano"", great songs both, were uncommonly buttoned-down for Xiu Xiu, and ""Hello from Eau Claire"" was almost a Moldy Peaches song. But where <em>Air Force</em> made venting seem rather academic, <em>Women as Lovers</em> is frantic and wild, with swatches of noise skidding around and Stewart's voice quivering on the edge of a panic attack-- even in the whispery sections.</p><p>
    In this light, ""Under Pressure"" is an apt cover choice, as the whole album conveys the sense of something about to boil over. With homely, impassioned vocals by Michael Gira, and the song's slick iconic bassline contrasted by a ragged interpretation of its arrangement, it takes on an air of desperation. Xiu Xiu's music is all about discomfort, but Stewart and co. have become quite comfortable in this conceptual space, and are able to inhabit it like painters making wild, broad smears that intuitively cohere into a look that is distinctly theirs.
    </p><p>
    On ""I Do What I Want, When I Want"", a pummeling post-punk groove dressed up with strident synth peals and pitched percussion, Stewart sounds direly imperiled, especially when the free-jazz horns start ripping through the already-claustrophobic mix. ""In Lust You Can Hear the Axe Fall"" is an apocalyptic atonal composition with a driving backbeat, and Stewart commands it masterfully, his voice sometimes climbing the slope of the wreckage, sometimes punching in abruptly at its screaming peaks. ""No Friend Oh!"" thrums like an engine, with anxious flurries of touch-tone synth and manic brass. The quieter compositions offer no relief from the mounting sense of impending catastrophe. ""Guantanamo Canto"" smears bending chimes, headachy percussion, loony-bin whistles, and allegorical sirens across a disorienting blankness, as Stewart says it plain: ""My country needs its freedom/ To contradict your humanness."" <em>The Air Force</em> gave us Xiu Xiu as a crystallized concept, but <em>Women as Lovers</em> sounds no more conceptual than a spurting artery. On ""F.T.W."", a clicky acoustic ballad that eventually erupts into a squeaking-helium hell of noise, Stewart whimpers, ""Am I all right? Do I look all right?"" He doesn't, and one feels for him, although maybe there's some small solace in that fact that as a musician, not-all-right is his best look.

Soulwax were a rock band who realized how liberating, delightful, and profitable a lack of respect for music could be as their 2 Many DJs alias became mash-up figureheads. That early-decade boom was a fad that managed to be a nexus point for other key developments-- critical appreciation of pop; indie's rediscovery of dancing; the rise of web creativity and distribution networks. This compilation of Soulwax's remixes for other people suggests these trends still drive their work.</p><p>
    The acts whose music hatched the mixes are a snapshot of omnivorous 00s Eurotaste-- Gorillaz, Klaxons, Kylie Minogue, LCD Soundsystem, the Gossip, Muse. Nothing too self-serious, nothing too tacky either, and mostly the kind of songs that already do brisk trade on indie dancefloors. Soulwax's handling of these tracks works best when they continue to think like bootleggers, approaching each with the spirit of forced collaboration and surprise. Minogue's iconic ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"", for instance, gets spliced with a scuzzy Kyuss guitar line. Kylie...Kyuss...Kyluss...geddit? But the desert rock backing somehow brings out a hidden hunger in Kylie's teasing vocal line, and there's a need in the song which wasn't there before. Another standout simply blends two old rave-era favorites, Human Resource's ""Dominator"" and 808 State's ""Cubik"": The former's brutalism might feel as dated as the latter's abstraction, but they refresh one another wonderfully.</p><p>
    More often Soulwax use their remixes as a way of expanding a track. They came of listening age in the 1980s, when every single had a sumptuously extended 12"" mix, and that's the spirit behind their reworkings of Gorillaz's ""Dare"" or the Gossip's ""Standing in the Way of Control"". These aren't always so successful. Soulwax are fond of the cruder, more visceral end of dance music-- lots of rough acid squealing and hollow drum sounds-- which ought to play well with guitar rock but doesn't always: The transition in the Gossip mix feels especially forced. Also, Soulwax are better at build-ups and releases than in structuring an extended groove within a track-- most of the longer mixes here bring the euphoria upfront but run out of steam a few minutes in.</p><p>
    Luckily, they've brought their alter egos along, and the second disc, a 2 Many DJs mix of all these tracks and more, brushes this problem aside by focusing on the one or two good ideas in each tune. Some of these ideas are obvious-- ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"" with added Daft Punk, the Klaxons remix mashing old-rave and nu-- but they're marvelously effective when they don't hang around. This disc also lets Soulwax show more range-- a highlight is a joyful re-edit of Ladytron's ""Seventeen"" where the group dial back the beats and embrace their indie rock heritage. And by only working with their own remixes, there's a consistency to the mix disc that compares well to the slightly exhausting eclecticism of most 2 Many DJs projects.</p><p>
    Soulwax are part of a generation of remixers who've come to prominence alongside mp3 blogs, whose hunger for new and exclusive material has transformed and grown the remix market. Mixes now don't necessarily have to do more than divert-- the aim is to extend a band's shelf life and keep them or their remixer front-of-mind for a fickle audience. Individually, almost everything here would be a highlight of an idle afternoon roaming the blogosphere-- no surprise that they're rather indigestible en masse. In the end it's Soulwax's gifts as mixers, not remixers, which provide the best reason to listen.</p></div>"|11107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11107-most-of-the-remixes/|6.9|Tom Ewing

    If you've followed Numero Group's <em>Eccentric Soul</em> series for any amount of time, you've likely been to
    Deep City,
    the Miami
    label that essentially birthed the city's soul scene and laid the groundwork
    for the Henry Stone funk/soul/disco empire that hit nationally during the 1970s.
    Their retrospective of that label was fantastic, unearthing 17 mostly forgotten
    tracks that added up to a formidable body of work. While Deep City was the main
    operation of its founders Willie Clarke and Johnny Pearsall, though, there was
    a small constellation of other labels they and their associates were involved in
    between 1963 and 1971 that also helped shape the character of Miami soul,
    including five that only released one 45. This compilation focuses on those
    peripheral activities, with a few additional Deep City
    cuts included as well.</p><p>
    A few of the names are new, even if most of the players are
    essentially the same collective documented on the first Deep City
    volume. Frank Williams &amp; the Rocketeers and other alumni of Florida A&amp;M University's
    Incomparable Marching 100 man many of the instruments, Clarence Reid, in his
    pre-Blowfly days, has two tracks and lends his writing and production skills to
    many others, and Helene Smith and Betty Wright duke it out for the title of
    Miami Soul Queen. Some of the tracks are previously unreleased, pulled from a
    beat-up box of reels Clarke retrieved from his ex-wife's house. According to
    the amusing liners, the Numero guys badgered him for years to go and get them.</p><p>
    Those same liners, which include a Miami soul glossary,
    track notes, photos, and a multi-label 45 discography, also mention that there
    were originally no plans for a follow-up volume, but I'm glad they made one,
    because most of these tracks simply didn't deserve to stay in a musty old box
    decaying in a closet or locked on obscure singles. Helene Smith's four tracks are real
    finds-- her crushing deep soul ballad ""True Love Don't Grow on Trees"", with its
    towering, symphonic horn arrangement and brooding rhythm section, is simply
    brilliant and makes me sad that she gave up music after the demise of Deep City
    (a demise she was partly responsible for). 
    </p>
<p>
    Smith's (somewhat unwitting) rival, Betty Wright, counters with
    two tracks of equal power. Her ""Mr. Lucky"", cut through with gunshot sound
    effects and an organ hook that borrows from Chopin's funeral march, is a gutsy
    soul stomper right on the border of funk-- her gritty, badass performance on the
    song makes it hard to believe she was only <em>14
    years old</em> when she recorded it. Unbelievable. As the years wore on, funk
    became a much heavier influence on the Miami
    sound. Perk Badger's ""Do
    Your Stuff"", from 1970, is built on a thick rhythm and even features Badger's
    James Brown-ish instructions to the band members, while Frank Williams &amp;
    the Rocketeers cut a heavy JB groove on 1966's ""Show Me What You Got"", clearly
    building on the innovations of ""Out of Sight"" and ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"".

    Deep
    City's Criteria Studios
    actually hosted recording sessions by James Brown, and it's clear from these
    cuts that Clarke would have had no trouble getting a sound that was right for
    him. But whether it was hard, raw funk or lushly arranged deep soul, the Deep City
    crew didn't really seem to have trouble making anything sound good. This volume
    is almost as strong as its predecessor, a superb document of the early evolution
    of the Miami
    sound that anyone into old soul or funk should hear.

Instead of a giant pyramid, the L.A. producer performs on top of whatever rickety table the club has on hand. His lightshow is a custom-made Monome, a minimalist sample trigger box connected to his Powerbook which represents his Showtunes-era samples as lights whizzing across the unit's wood-paneled display. But on <em>Live at Low End Theory</em>, recorded in June at the well-known L.A. club night, his gauzy re-interpretations of his own work take on a whole new life as dance music just as critics and fans were writing him off as a niche commodity.</p><p>
    After <em>The Weather</em>, a successful collaboration with Busdriver and Radioinactive, Daedelus was criticized for turning his old-timey samples into a schtick rather than exploring his compositional prowess. Subsequent releases <em>Of Snowdonia</em> and <em>A Gent Agent</em>-- as well as his side-project Adventure Time-- had the feel of an artist not quite commanding his source material, like a flea-market collector content to hang a record's quaint, dated album art on his walls rather than spin the disc.</p><p>
    But in 2005, he staged a virtual hip-hop punch-out with <em>Exquisite Corpse</em>, delivering on his promise as a producer and featuring rappers like MF Doom, Prefuse 73, Mike Ladd, Cyne, and TTC. And 2006's <em>Denies the Day's Demise</em> was one of his best releases since his <em>Invention</em> five years earlier. It might not have done so well in the market, even given its high-profile release on Ninja Tune, but his dreamy hip-hop/samba time capsules was at no time better parceled. Daedelus' shows have for a long time employed a breakbeat-friendly ethos, but <em>Denies</em> was perhaps the first record to actively sell his affinity. <em>Low End Theory</em> may be essential to proving to larger audiences that Daedelus can break out of the rubric of aged source material and home-made fuzz without seeming a novelty or getting walked on by underground rappers. </p><p>
    The Low End Theory club night at the Airliner in L.A. is a perfect place for Daedelus to throw down. Hip-hop and assorted electronic performers knock elbows to an audience of urbane and avant-garde types. Daedelus himself has always trodden this line by mixing his readily parsible concept (old records with glitch laid all-up-ons) with varied production stints in the underground hip-hop community. He even places himself outside of easy identifiers by performing in Edwardian coats, tails and ascots. There's no better way to identify yourself as a hyperbolic, rap-obsessed white man than to chill with Busdriver and Madlib while dressing like a dandy, right? But it's the added punch of heavy breakbeats on ""Press Snooze"" (using the sample from ""Like Clockwork Springs"" off <em>Demise</em>) that really shy away from his duality of old-time sample-monger and poor man's Prefuse. </p><p>
    Daedelus' live show shares elements of Prefuse 73's <em>Preparations</em>: this relentless stream of off-white noise, a dense heap of familiar, pleasing sounds with beguiling dance appeal. Even a Daedelus fan has to delve deep into this disc to get to points of familiarity, since none of the track names match the studio works that feature the old samples or compositions. Instead of the pristine ""Something Bells"" off 2004's <em>Of Snowdonia</em>, we have to deal with the shark-toothed dance beats of ""Now's the Time"", with the addition of a tinkly synth line from <em>Denies</em> dipping in and out of coherence. Come to think of it: Lucidity is a key to Daedelus's work, which at its low points seems like he's planning his next move with a bit of uncertainty and at its high points can't be forgotten without pointed effort. </p><p>
    Daedelus' heaped-upon layers of samples sometimes lack the direct impact he seems to strive for. His live show is a relentless assault of sampled and constructed melodies which evolve with toe-tapping, but not body-moving, spontaneity. His timeless eccentricity, his penchant for the coats-and-tails, certainly takes listeners out of the contemporary, incestuous interplay between electronic and hip-hop music. It's not that he can't host a damn good party or re-examine and brilliantly re-combine his work. Daedelus just seems more at home in the herky-jerky company of clockwork, steam-powered robots whose interstella exploits have as of yet only aspired to the levels of Jules Verne and Little Nemo. If you're an electro-romantic, you'll feel right at home.</p></div>"|11077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11077-live-at-low-end-theory/|7.1|Mike Orme

    As hundreds-- if not thousands-- of blog-house DJs have spent the past few years illustrating, some aspects of rock'n'roll can be imported pretty readily into dance. From the Fender-aping crunch of Justice's hyper-compressed chords to the noodly, scale-running arpeggios that have fast become Daft Punk's stock-in-trade, the traditional, most populist idea of rock has enjoyed a keening resurgence courtesy the unlikeliest source: the DJ. The ultimate answer to the question of whether that synergy works in both directions-- which is to say, whether dance music functions as well as a seasoning within a predominantly rock sensibility-- is still up for grabs, but as albums like this remind us, the truth is: uh, probably not.</p><p>
    Midnight Juggernauts are a three-piece from Melbourne, who, like the New Deal before them, are all about merging the musicianship and bombast of arena rock with the textures and physicality of dance. And while, after Justice and Kanye and T.I., it makes a strange kind of logic that the next iteration of French house in the mainstream should be by the hand of some dilettantish rock band, <em>Dystopia</em> inadvertently points to the practical hurdles to such a union. These are mostly producerly concerns: since French house is powered by massive sonic shifts like EQ sweeps and filters, it commands, by definition, a pretty massive chunk of the frequency spectrum on its own; and so, any attempts to harness that sound into functioning like just another instrument in a rock band are going to leave you with something that either sounds comically overstuffed or sadly tokenish.</p><p>
    It's a problem you can hear the trio grappling with over the course of the record. One of their favorite workarounds is to use instruments for the verses and have their burlier electronic arrangements take over for the choruses, but this constant baton-passing quickly starts to wear. The irony is that when they're not worrying so much about how or where to fit all their instruments into the mix, they sound more comfortable; between the juddering chorus to ""Ending of an Era"", the Gallic throwback of ""Road to Recovery"", and the rolling synth bassline in album highlight ""Shadows"", there's enough here to suggest they'd actually be better served by ditching their stubborn insistence on live material outright.
    </p>
<p>
    The kicker is that, without their live/electronic shtick to distinguish them, Midnight Juggernauts don't seem to be anything other than gifted mimics. As great as it is, ""Road to Recovery"" is de Homem-Christo &amp; Bangalter with proggy lyrics, the awful ""Tombstone"" is a completely shameless Ratatat rip, and the title track, with its dreamy acoustic guitars, synth clouds, and hairpinning major chords, might as well have been lifted straight off one of the lesser Air albums. If you like all that stuff and you're forgiving enough that you're willing to put up with a band that does slightly inferior versions of same while simultaneously somehow sounding uncannily like the Moody Blues, well, these are the dudes for you. Everyone else: to the Roulé back catalogues you go.<br/>

That     of course, isn't their fault, or anybody else's. But rather than     theatrically bemoan the nature and economics of cross-cultural     exchange, let's focus on what we do have, namely <i>The Voice of     Lightness</i>, collecting 29 of the omnivorous tenor's sides spanning     1961-1977 (admittedly, only about half his career).</p>
<p>Rochereau was, primarily, a showman and politician. Groomed     to be a preacher-- a happy irony and no coincidence, I don't think-- he     started writing songs for Joseph Kabasele's African Jazz (then Congo's     most popular band) when he was about 16, eventually joining as a     backing vocalist. Fame came early and thick, in part because Rochereau     wanted it: When he took a lead vocal on ""Succès African Jazz"", he     bragged about their popularity in Cuba when Cuba didn't even carry     their records; in his own career, he occasionally sang in a made-up     language resembling Spanish (a tactical move, a move for the vote); he     sang from a woman's perspective on ""Mongali""; on ""Mokolo Nakokufa"",     he assumes a series of characters musing on mortality, including     a man wondering about who will weep for him when he dies, and, curiously, a     woman who moans, ""I'll miss African Fiesta."" He recorded a song about     how remarkably clean Omo laundry soap kept his shirts.</p>
<p>But Rochereau's impulse to boast and pander in his lyrics,     however sweetly, didn't make him a philistine. When he left African     Jazz to form African Fiesta, he took some of their best musicians with     him (hooking the brilliant Nico, then one of three guitarists behind     African Jazz, with the opportunity of a more central role). And with     them-- and in his later 1960s and 70s bands, African Fiesta 66 and     Afrisa-- he created an incredibly diverse catalog of pop music. The same     impulse that made him make up a language probably inspired him to mix     Congolese musics other than rumba into his style; his cautious interest     in James Brown-- whom Franco once called a ""monkey""-- half-inspired the     evolution of soukous, where songs broke down partway into a frenzied     dance; and ""Aon Aon"", named onomatopoetically for the wah-wah guitar,     is the sound of African funk before Fela. There's almost never a limp     moment or dull melody; the songs are as accommodating to dancing as     they are to whistling; and when Rochereau makes radical little plays at     genre-bending and stylistic experimentation, he does what few     innovators bother to do-- puts the people first.</p>
<p>Mbilia Bel's story, like half the stories in the history of     Congolese pop in the 20th century, involves Tabu Ley Rochereau (the     other half, of course, involve Franco). Rochereau saw her on TV one day     in 1981, performing as a backing vocalist for Abeti Masikini, and, in     the way I imagine only famous pop musicians and royalty and law     enforcement can do, sent for her presence. Within a couple years, she'd     reached the front the stage with Afrisa International; she and Tabu Ley     got married, and he started writing songs for her. <i>Bel Canto</i> is as much     a retrospective of her as it is of Afrisa in the 80s, when soukous had     fully flourished, when nary a guitar wound its way into a record     without passing through a chorus pedal first, when increased production     quality showed rhythms to bubble and crisp where before they'd only     gently percolated.</p>
<p>Lingala, the Congolese language Bel sang in, has a naturally     percussive inflection, but the traces of French and Portuguese make it     sound fluid; as for Bel, she sings in it beautifully-- a smooth voice     that flutters in upper ranges and croaks in lower, embodying its     natural tensions. The grooves are somewhere between Rochereau's and     Fela's in length-- usually between eight and 12 minutes, just enough time to     cook, but not enough time to truly bore (as, I hold out heretically,     Fela always ends up doing to me). With the 80s came better access to     synthesizers, which explore the mix with charming clumsiness, sometimes     trying to imitate guitars, sometimes horns, sometimes just squelching     around just for the heck.</p>
<p>Having the lyrics help, too: Though written by Rochereau and     probably not given the most attentive English translation, they're gems     of self-conscious femininity that, if not exactly liberated, sound as     compromised and intimate as couplets from Slits or Raincoats records.     Mbilia talks about the beauty of her husband's mistress without envy     and being in a bloodless marriage to a rich man, sure-- but then turns     her nose up at a jealous lover with a dignity that probably makes him     frustrated enough to scream and shamed enough to cry: ""You act as     though an insect has bitten you. Where did it bite you?"" she chirps, gliding away. Rochereau's the man here, of course, and for however     much she was beloved, Bel was first and foremost his protégé. He gave her lyrics and a band, but there was one thing she found on her own (though he had plenty of it in reserve): charm.</p></div>"|11650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11650-the-voice-of-lightness-bel-canto/|8.3|Mike Powell

Chronologically, it's an apt assessment: Cobain killed himself on April 5, 1994; ""Loser"" peaked at #10 on the <em>Billboard</em> charts three weeks later. But back in the mid-90s, Beck was practically Cobain's polar opposite. Whereas Kurt exuded raw power with every phlegm-spewing roar, Beck rapped in monotone (when he wasn't crooning like a sleep-deprived folkie). Kurt hunched and staggered; Beck pranced, did splits, and mimicked robots. Kurt raged against a doomed world with a vitriolic mix of anger and sincerity; Beck took the piss out of a doomed world with a mix of irony and showmanship. Admittedly, they were both known to wear flannel shirts from time to time.</p><p>
    Beck's popularity can not only be read as a consolation prize to Cobain's legend, but as a reaction to it-- the weirdo L.A. huckster who could sing ""I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me"" as a t-shirt-ready slacker joke rather than a seething slacker lament. So, after getting their hearts busted by an unlikely savior, Alternative America turned to a cheese-whiz rhyming folk-hop clown who treated death as just another convention to flout. With ""Loser"", Beck was the rebound boyfriend, the one who'll make you laugh for the time being. And then came <em>Odelay</em>-- a thoroughly carefree-sounding affair that made everyone take this boyish imp very seriously. It's the album where he managed to combine the disparate noise, blues, and subverted hippie-isms of his early work into a showy post-modern marvel.</p><p>
    In hindsight, the record sounds like the world's most accomplished demo reel-- an introductory smorgasbord pumped-up on its own premeditated randomness. The origins of <em>Mutations</em>' shambling acoustic blues can be found within come-down closer ""Ramshackle"". And <em>Odelay</em>'s funkiest, most scatterbrained tracks like ""Where It's At"" and ""High 5 (Rock the Catskills)"" were later pushed to their logical extreme on <em>Midnite Vultures</em>' ingenious Prince-isms. Add some sweeping strings and ""Jack-Ass"" easily becomes a <em>Sea Change</em> highlight. So while Beck has spent the last 12 years largely sampling and expounding upon the ideas he presented on his most popular album, <em>Odelay</em>'s most distinguishing feature is its effortless summation of decades of popular music by-way-of the Dust Brothers' still-fresh production.
    </p><p>
    From the nervy opening chords of ""Devil's Haircut"" (based on the garage-rock classic ""I Can Only Give You Everything"") to the signature sax riff of ""The New Pollution"" (lovingly pilfered from forgotten tenor player Joe Thomas's ""Venus""), <em>Odelay</em> is the album every record-diving MPC-phile wants to make. Though the LP was a huge commercial success, its sound was never successfully equaled by savvy opportunists. Chalk it up to the increasingly complicated legalities of sampling, as Beck explained in a 2005 interview: ""Back [on <em>Odelay</em>] it was basically me writing chord changes and melodies, and then endless records being scratched and little sounds coming off the turntable. Now it's prohibitively difficult and expensive to justify your one weird little horn blare that happens for half of a second one time in a song and makes you give away 70% of the song and $50,000."" And, of course, it's the little lifts-- the sex-ed dialogue on ""Where It's At"", the snippet of Schubert's ""Unfinished Symphony #8 in B Minor"" on ""High 5"", the dozens (hundreds?) of unique drum hits and perfectly placed sonic scribbles-- that makes <em>Odelay</em> such a deep and engaging listen even after all the headphone sessions and Best Album of the 90s accolades. Tellingly, when Beck and the Dust Brothers tried to recreate their signature style on 2005's <em>Guero</em> they couldn't pull it off, inadvertently reinforcing <em>Odelay</em>'s lasting appeal in the process.
    </p>
<p>
    To some, it may seem a bit premature for this 12-year-old LP to get the deluxe treatment, but in this age of shameless instant-reissues put forth by disintegrating major labels, it's a relatively classy (if not exactly indispensable) barrel scrape. Along with a playfully drawn-over cover and liner note contributions from Thurston Moore and Dave Eggers, the reissue is padded with an entire disc of era-appropriate B-sides along with two previously unreleased tracks. While sometimes intriguing and ecstatic, the bonus tracks rarely live up to anything from the proper album. Of the unearthed songs, the schizophrenic dial-flip pastiche ""Inferno"" contains many genre-hopping ideas across its seven minutes but none are fully realized. And ""Gold Chains"" is a decidedly less funky version of ""Sissyneck"" with lyrical hip-hop symbolizers in place of country tropes. Unwisely, the extra disc begins with U.N.K.L.E.'s never ending ""Where It's At"" redo, which at 12 minutes is easily nine minutes too long. Elsewhere, semi-songs, stepping-stones, and studio wankery abound, revealing Beck's growth post-<em>Mellow Gold</em> in real time-- they're interesting in theory, at least. The most enduring tracks-- ""Feather in Your Cap"" and ""Brother""-- are somber ballads Beck recorded before he hooked up with the Dust Brothers. With lines like, ""Disappointment is a feather in your cap/ You want the truth so you can crush it in your hand,"" these songs suggest the straightforward emotionalism of <em>Sea Change</em>-- an approach Beck would need a few more years to feel comfortable bringing to the fore.
    </p>
<p>
    For all of their differences, both Kurt Cobain and Beck had overarching obsessions with death and decay. Kurt took his preoccupation with the ultimate end to its ultimate end, but Beck chose to gussy it up on <em>Odelay</em>, going on cryptically about Gods and devils while hip-hop-tinged party music juxtaposed the existential angst. On ""Novocane"", he screams through a bullhorn: ""Got so numb, longhorn drums/ Detonate with the suicide gate."" Later on, he's ""more dead than alive"" over a distinctly lively old-school jam. ""Put a song in your throat/ Let the dead beats pound all around,"" he hums on ""Ramshackle"". Through ingenious technical savvy and an ear for hooks that span generations, Beck and the Dust Brothers managed to turn many dead beats into signs of life on <em>Odelay</em>.

He wasn't too far off the mark. OK, so maybe Jones' frantic falsetto isn't quite let's-get-it-on smooth, but his mention of the glam-rock musical was no gross overstatement: <em>The Evening Descends</em> is bursting with balcony-pitched histrionics, molten Brian May leads, and standing-ovation-worthy crashes. But what really makes this album special is the ways in which the Evangelicals pull off big-stage spectacle on what still sounds like a public-access cable-show budget.</p><p>
    More than their shared zip code and mutual affinity for lysergic pop songs, it's this thrifty ideology that most closely relates Evangelicals to the Flaming Lips-- specifically the anarchic mid-80s incarnation that proved a few well-utilized Christmas lights and fog machines can make a bar band look like Pink Floyd. But where <em>So Gone</em> deployed the kitchen-sink aesthetic in a more chaotic fashion-- with recording levels and synth squelches dropping in and out of the mix without warning-- on <em>The Evening Descends</em>, the production quirks and strange background noises mostly serve the songs' momentum rather than subvert them. Mind you, that's not a conclusion you'd immediately draw from the opening title track, a deconstructed lullaby that takes all of the Evangelicals' signature devices-- ghostly hums, glammy guitar swirls, video-game synth effects, subliminal conversations and Jones' fragile croon-- breaks them down and pieces them back together at random. But after this curious opener-- perhaps their fucked-up idea of a storybook-like introduction to set the album's nocturnal mood-- Evangelicals don't look back.</p><p>
    Like <em>So Gone</em>, the songs on <em>The Evening Descends</em> find Jones toeing the blurry lines separating ennui, intoxication and insanity. But the more patient, assertive performances (unlike <em>So Gone</em>, Jones recorded the new album with bassist Kyle Davis and drummer Austin Stephens) lends Jones' peculiar musings a greater degree of sincerity. When he sings ""please don't tell my mother/ She wouldn't want to know/ I've been goin' crazy"" (on ""Midnight Vignette""), it sounds less like paranoid stoner-speak than a portrait of a very real domestic drama. The triumphant ""Skeleton Man"" presents an even more poignant portrait of an outcast in search of acceptance, his pleas for understanding set to a resolute, bouncing-ball march-- in step with Arcade Fire's ""Rebellion (Lies)""-- that retains its composure even as the strangulated voices and mad-cap laughter inside his head threaten to overcome him. But it's a tentative peace: ""How Do You Sleep""-- <em>The Evening Descends</em>' most over-the-top gesture-- gushes forth with a multi-tracked miasma of arpeggiated guitars and operatic shrieks; however, unlike the John Lennon classic of the same name, the song is not a scathing indictment but rather a genuine inquiry into overcoming recurring nightmares.</p><p>
<em>The Evening Descends</em>' more considered depiction of Jones' psychosis does not come at the complete expense of Evangelicals' more playful whims: ""Snowflakes"" is a charming winter-wonderland ballad that's a close companion to <em>So Gone</em>'s standout serenade ""My Heartache"", and the bad-trip breakdown of ""Party Crashin'"" is framed by cheeky faux hospital-drama dialogue between a doctor and an amputee, Jones' cries undercut by a chipper acoustic riff and wailing sirens. Evangelicals are mostly careful to not let their found-sound chicanery overwhelm their songs, however, ""Bellawood""-- <em>The Evening Descends</em>' one out-and-out misstep-- is guilty of over-selling the drama, its story of institutionalization delivered with an uncharacteristically contrived performance by Jones and bogged down by B-movie shtickiness (Hitchcockian strings, Theremin effects). Perhaps it's an instant self-correcting measure that the song is immediately followed by ""Paperback Suicide"", a simple, glockenspieled power-pop number whose breezy, blissful demeanor craftily belies its tale of a frustrated writer who kills himself just to hear his own obituary-- a requiem for every struggling artist who's pondered infamy through the afterlife. And so <em>The Evening Descends</em>' storybook structure yields an important lesson: There's no need to fake the weird when you live in the real world.</p></div>"|11095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11095-the-evening-descends/|8.3|Stuart Berman

    Let's face it-- when it comes to pairing two genres, sounds, or
    ideologies to create a new musical hybrid, rock long ago ran out of all
    its natural ""you got chocolate in my peanut butter"" combinations. For
    better or worse, this is how we end up with stuff like the Advantage, <em>A Hillbilly Tribute to AC/DC</em>
    and ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"". And now, joining the
    mayonnaise-on-french-fries sweepstakes with an unholy union of
    post-hardcore and hi-NRG keyboards, is Enter Shikari.</p><p>
    While it doesn't match <em>Switched-On Bach</em>
    for instant illogical strangeness, this upstart quartet's
    inspired decision to laminate energetic synthesizer blasts onto their
    cacophonous thrash does sound like a recipe for disaster on first
    blush. Surely one component of the combo will be made to suffer, either
    by the peppy keys rendering the metallic clatter toothless or the
    head-banging stuff turning the dance touches into brittle irony.</p><p>
    Fortunately, the synth treatments on <em>Take to the Skies</em>
    are sufficiently superficial that there's no real threat of
    obtrusiveness on either side. The trance and rave elements-- almost
    invariably shimmery, galloping little things-- are just pronounced
    enough to lend a happy novelty to the proceedings, occasionally buoying
    the likes of ""No Sssweat"" and ""Labyrinth"" but rarely dictating the real
    pulse or tenor of a song.
    </p>
<p>
    What we're left with then is a schizophrenic
    post-hardcore outfit, oscillating at expected junctures between
    unmitigated thrash and conventional rock passages. Lead singer Roughton
    ""Rou"" Reynolds transitions ably between larynx-shredding sandpaper
    yelps (plus occasional Cookie Monster growl) and cleanly plaintive
    emoting, with bassist Chris Batten also adding pristine pipes to
    fulfill the Daron Malakian role for a band that quite often evokes
    System of a Down (particularly on the anthemic ""Mothership"").
    </p>
<p>
    As it is with many debuts, <em>Take to the Skies</em>
    reveals a band working to pin down what it does well, trying on several
    hats and seeing which ones fit. Surprisingly, many do-- songs like
    ""Sorry, You're Not a Winner"" and the single ""Anything Can Happen in the
    Next Half Hour..."" showcase a facility with riffage, while ""Jonny Sniper""
    and ""OK, Time For Plan B"" nicely proffer tuneful, searching pop-rock,
    the latter sounding downright New Romantic in spots. At the same time,
    however, many of the conventional rock moments sound, well, blandly conventional, and the utterly inconsequential comedown
    ""Today Won't Go Down in History"" suggests it'll be some time before
    Enter Shikari masters quieter, more ruminative fare.
    </p>
<p>
    In order to make sure they get that time, the band will likely need to
    either refine or ditch altogether the synthesized window dressing-- in
    its current incarnation it's the kind of semi-clever gimmick that's
    practically guaranteed to grow stale if overused. Surely it'll take a
    little more than a simple formula of ""sonic blitzkrieg + cheesy keys""
    to keep the majority of Shikari's 183,900-odd MySpace buddies compelled
    for the long haul.

    Whenever any hack musician 
    puts out a new record, his publicist will inevitably trumpets it as more personal. 
    Radar Bros. leader Jim Putnam, however, has actually sought to make his band's fifth 
    CD, <em>Auditorium</em>,<em> </em>less<em> </em>
    personal. ""I kind of wanted to write more obvious, literal type stuff,"" 
    he told me recently. ""A lot of times people will say, 'What the 
    hell is that song about?' And I'll say, 'It's obvious,' and 
    they'll say, 'No it isn't.'"" Radar Bros. songs were never 
    about the lyrics, anyway. Putnam doesn't do a whole lot of singing 
    in the first place, and when he does he has a way of making simple words 
    difficult to understand. Instead, the band focuses on its huge sonic 
    landscapes, which permit the listener to burrow into-- or, at worst, 
    fall asleep inside of-- whichever little part they feel most comfortable.</p><p>
    But this time around Putnam 
    wants a stronger musician/listener connection, so <em>Auditorium </em>
    gives us songs like ""Brother Rabbit"", which memorializes a boring 
    day hanging out in the yard with the dog. ""I'm going to sit here/ 
    I'm going to whittle away on an old green chair/ You're going to 
    sit there/ And you're going to watch the paint gently flake away,"" 
    he sings. Perhaps this is a political statement of sorts, but he gets 
    more overt on ""Happy Spirits"", which concerns George Bush and slain 
    soldiers: ""These things you say make it all right/ But happy spirits 
    make to the sky."" ""A Dog Named Ohio"" alludes-- duh-- to election 
    fraud. This type of lyricism is at best preaching to the choir and at 
    worst completely irrelevant, making you wish you still had no idea what 
    the hell he was talking about.
    Which leaves us with those 
    signature Radar Bros. horizontal melodies, which consist mainly of echoing, 
    inoffensive electric guitar and metronomic drums, and add up to bong-hitting 
    mood music that makes Putnam's side project, Mt. Wilson Repeater, 
    sound absolutely giddy by comparison. Though recorded at Putnam's 
    L.A.-area home, <em>Auditorium </em>would have made a great soundtrack 
    for the Oregon-set, quasi-mystical, earth-worshipping movie <em>Old Joy</em>. 
    Like that film, the band's measured, washing melodies always feel 
    like they're heading somewhere but rarely seem to arrive. In a way, 
    Putnam is the anti-Ben Bridwell, trying his damndest to avoid cliché 
    and displays of emotion, to the detriment of any real tension. It's 
    a bit of an affectation, one suspects, because from time to time Putnam 
    betrays himself by actually getting excited, such as on ""Watching 
    Cows"" which-- despite its innocuous subject matter-- climaxes nicely, 
    both musically and lyrically. Suffice it to say, he really envies those 
    fucking cows.</p></div>"|11078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11078-auditorium/|5.5|Ben Westhoff

    If there's anything the happy New York kids in this band have learned from listening to African music, it's the difference between ""pop"" and ""rock"": Vampire Weekend's debut album announces straight off that it's the former. The first sound on the first song, ""Mansard Roof"", comes from Rostam Batmanglij's keyboard, set to a perky, almost piping tone-- the kind of sunny sound you'd hear in old west-African pop. Same goes for Ezra Koenig's guitar, which never takes up too much space; it's that clean, natural tone you'd get on a record from Senegal or South Africa. Chris Baio's bass pulses and slides and steps with light feet, and most of all there's Chris Tomson, who plays like a percussionist as often as he does a rock drummer, tapping out rhythms and counter-accents on a couple of drums in the back of the room. And yet they play it all like indie kids on a college lawn, because they're not hung up on Africa in the least-- a lot of these songs work more like those on the Strokes' debut, <em>Is This It?</em>, if you scraped off all the scuzzy rock'n'roll signifiers, leaving behind nothing but clean-cut pop and preppy new wave, tucked-in shirts and English-lit courses.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    This Afro/preppy/new-wave combination has a history-- Brits like Orange Juice, Americans like Talking Heads. For now, though, it's one of the most deservedly buzzed-about things around: People have been chattering over Vampire Weekend ever since a CD-R demo of three of these songs started circulating last year.  (Full disclosure: One of the sound engineers of that CD-R now does freelance audio work for Pitchfork.) The excitement isn't hard to fathom. People spend a lot of time poking around for the edgy new underground thing, convinced that plain old pop songs have been done to death. But Vampire Weekend come along like Belle &amp; Sebastian and the Strokes each did, sounding refreshingly
    laidback and uncomplicated, and with simple set-ups that make good songs sound
    exceedingly easy. (The result being not ""this is mind-blowing,"" or ""this is catchy,"" but ""I have listened to this, straight through, four times a day for the past month"".)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    No surprise, then, that their first hit mp3 would be a song called ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"", which is sly, quiet, and casual in a way that blows away so many other bands who actively try to get your attention. Their label seems to have understood this effect, and so they've left these demos sounding as natural as they were: This release just fiddles with the mastering, switches out a few takes in ways you wouldn't much notice, plays with the sequencing, relegates one song to a B-side, and adds a couple of great ones that you can nonetheless understand being omitted the first time.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Most of the credit will wind up going to Koenig, who's the star presence here. By the second song, ""Oxford Comma"", the band is ticking along on little touches of keyboard and the tap of a snare drum, and he's still keeping the empty space captivating: There's a little indie yelp to his voice, but mostly he's relaxed, conversational, and wry. (Not unlike another guy who's tried on an Afro-suave sound-- though Paul Simon never sounded this exuberant.) The person who'll probably never get enough credit turns out to be Batmanglij, whose pat, classicist keyboard arpeggios lead the way through tempo shifts and transitions, occasionally locking in with some sprightly violin parts. It all comes off as simple, jaunty, and homespun, but there's a lot of precision lurking beneath-- exactly what happens when you combine a music major and indie-pop. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Koenig is smart and lucky, in that he gets to play the preppy angle both ways: Like a guy who's read a lot of Cheever, he can summon up the atmosphere of kids whose parents use ""summer"" as a verb and give it all the hairy eyeball at the same time. ""Oxford Comma"" is spent picking on someone who brags too much about money: ""Why would you lie about how much coal you have?/ Why would you lie about something dumb like that?"" (Then again, there's nothing more moneyed than having the luxury to find money tacky, and when Koenig adds that Lil Jon ""always tells the truth,"" you kind of suspect Lil Jon wouldn't find how much ""coal"" someone has to be all that irrelevant.)
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Later, walking across the Columbia University campus, Koenig drops a detail whose delivery always gets a smile from me, even if its thrust is hard to gauge: ""You spilled kefir on your keffiyeh."" Koenig is a detail <em>guy</em>, a happy observer who never much bores you with how he feels; mostly, as befits a recent college grad, he's singing about location, about where people will go and whether they'll come back with new faces. In non-album B-side ""Ladies of Cambridge"", he can't decide whether to move there with the girl or mourn letting her go alone; ""Walcott"" whirls you through Cape Cod and then suggests getting the hell out (""Bottleneck is a shit show/ Hyannisport is a ghetto""); the twitchy ""A-Punk"" sees one person off to New Mexico while another stays near college and finds a place in Washington Heights. And while the faux-African backing vocals on ""One"" might be the album's only real misstep, the final line sums up where its concerns are: ""All your collegiate grief has left you/ Dowdy in sweatshirts/ Absolute horror!""
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Of course, while Vampire Weekend have certainly benefited from our new music world of internet buzz, plenty of people have found reasons to hate Vampire Weekend from the first note, many of them having to do with their prep aesthetic and Ivy League educations-- Oxford shirts, boat shoes, Columbia University. But it just so happens that we're in a moment where such things matter to people: As interest grows in clean-cut, clever indie-pop, plenty of folks would like to hear things get dirtier, riskier, less collegiate-- and in a lot of corners of the indie landscape, they thankfully are. But here's another odd parallel with that first Strokes record: Vampire Weekend have the same knack for grabbing those haters and winning them over. Bring any baggage you want to this record, and it still returns nothing but warm, airy, low-gimmick pop, peppy, clever, and yes, unpretentious-- four guys who listened to some Afro-pop records, picked up a few nice ideas, and then set about making one of the most refreshing and
    replayable indie records in recent years.

Timeliness is     the attribute of the artisan, cannily anticipating and servicing customer     demand; artists must either be tragically ahead of their time or blissfully     oblivious to it. One senses Booka Shade are keenly aware of this distinction: Their     early work as in-house production team for German house label Get Physical was     thrilling in its superlative, undemonstrative timeliness, while few dancefloor     anthems have felt more ""right now"" than their mid-decade anthems ""Mandarine     Girl"" and ""In White Rooms"". But herein lies the rub: Having carved out a sound     that was increasingly identifiable, the duo risk being left behind by European     dance music's relentless march toward the new, the next thing.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-AU""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-AU"">If Booka Shade were feeling exhausted by     the prospect of keeping pace, a contribution to !K7's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">DJ-Kicks </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">series offers the perfect escape route: Dominated by performers with     a tenuous foothold perch on the dancefloor (Annie, Erlend Øye, Hot Chip),     its best efforts have been from dance producers (Playgroup, Henrik Schwarz)     stretching to paint on a broader canvas, using polystylistic, multi-era     selections to </span><span lang=""EN-AU"">precariously walk the artist-artisan tightrope</span><span lang=""EN-AU"">, suggesting that they, too, were more than just a passing fad. Booka Shade dutifully follow     suit, but their leap towards artistic eclecticism can fall short of its     destination. For the most part, the tried-and-true insertion of ostentatiously     individual and antiquarian favourites into their first DJ mix is a strategic     error:<span> </span>the use of John Carpenter     instrumentals works well, and I'll allow the inclusion of Yazoo and Heaven 17's     jerky synth-pop, but tracks by Aphex Twin and the Streets in particular stand     out as great pieces of music whose sore thumb status here does them no favors-- the painful slow-down and speed-up in and out of Aphex's ""Alberto Balsam"" is     probably the album's most forced-sounding, artificial moment.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-AU""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-AU"">Ironically, the most captivating moments on     this mix are the string of spectral and dazzlingly unpredictable recent house     tunes: Amir Ad Fontes' Amazonian ""Virtual Nature"", Quarion's rippling and     rhapsodic ""Play Your Part"", Noze's darkly romantic ""Slum Girl"", or the duo's     own glittering ""Estoril"". Were they too quick to abandon up-to-date production     as a reigning principle? It's hard to say: it would be a shame to lose Carl     Craig's glittering classic ""Landcruising"". Perhaps the issue is that Booka     Shade are sound-designers and collaborators more than they are DJs: Their true     talent is not for creating links between disparate sounds, but rather for     swelling up one sound to suit a variety of purposes, and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">DJ-Kicks </span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">is strongest when it remains within the duo's own vein of highly     polished sci-fi romanticism. This isn't a limitation: The mix's most impressive     quality is how vast and all-encompassing this niche can feel.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-AU""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-AU"">And when the sonics fit, Booka Shade's     aesthetic expands effortlessly to embrace songfulness: the Wahoo remix of Ben     Westbeech's ""Hang Around"" is gorgeously dramatic house-pop (and marvellously     buffed up in this mix with atmospherics from Cerrone's ""In the Smoke""-- the     album's most impressive mixing feat), but I particularly like the winsome vibe     of Hot Chip's sighing remix of Matthew Dear's ""Don &amp; Sherri"" and Booka     Shade's own, achingly perfect ""Numbers"". Both circulate around plaintive     refrains: ""How can I let you forget me/ If you don't even know me already?"", and     ""What's your number?/ I really want you…"" What the latter lacks in lyrical     clarity it makes up with sweeping grandeur, decomposing synth chimes and     lachrymose strings somehow conveying perfectly that implausible (but     nonetheless real) coincidence of dancefloor seduction with metaphysical     redemption. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-AU""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-AU"">It's one of the duo's great and inscrutable     production tricks that their descents into outright tearfulness always come as     a slight surprise, even on the umpteenth listen-- but then, it's precisely at     these moments that the relationship between art and craft in their music becomes mysterious     and indecipherable. The ultimate timeliness and sonic precision of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">DJ-Kicks</span></span><span lang=""EN-AU"">' best moments shouldn't come as a disappointment: if Booka Shade     remain ""mere"" craftsmen, their capacity to unexpectedly tug so hard on the     heartstrings is a skill more artists in dance music should strive for.</span></p></div>"|11059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11059-dj-kicks/|7.4|Tim Finney

Though Pollard is often thought of as something of a savant, his best records have been products of intensive craft and focus.  As a collection of reworked outtakes, <em>Superman</em> is innately handicapped and limited; not one song on the album is host to the inspired energy that characterizes Pollard's best work.</p><p>
     
    There is little to be gained from harping on the differences Pollard's lo-fi and hi-fi material. Pollard is capable of turning out a versatile array of extremely strong songs regardless of recording quality, and <em>Bee Thousand</em>'s greatest strength is most certainly not its veil of tape hiss.  Perhaps the most exciting facet of Guided by Voices' ""classic"" albums is their variety; Pollard has always been a fan of crediting his music to imaginary bands and conceptualizing his records as fictitious radio programs.  Several of the songs on <em>Superman Was a Rocker</em> would work fine as stopgaps between undeniable jams on a proper Guided by Voices record, but fail to constitute an enjoyable album on their own.</p><p>
    That said, <em>Superman</em> is not without a handful of decent-to-good tracks. ""Love Your Spaceman"" is a solid Pollard outtake, on par with some of the better tracks on the <em>Suitcase</em> box sets. The instrumental on ""Back to the Farm"" is wisely left vocal-free, and makes for far and away the best moment here.  The radio interview excerpt that precedes it is hilarious but, like many of the goofs on <em>Superman</em>, doesn't warrant repeat listens, and takes up an awful lot of space on an already-thin record.</p><p>
    Some of the most promising tracks on <em>Superman</em> seem thoroughly compromised by the album's approach; in ""Peacock"", some good vocal ideas are stifled by the instrumental's rigid and predetermined structure. <em>Superman Was a Rocke</em>r is host to its share of entertaining gags and solidly musical moments, but even at a scant thirty minutes it feels stretched and slight.  While it's impressive that there's still halfway-decent archival material for Pollard to dress up and put out, it's hard to recommend <em>Superman Was a Rocker</em> to anyone who hasn't already exhausted the three or four hundred better songs Pollard has already released.<br/></p></div>"|11102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11102-superman-was-a-rocker/|5.0|Matt LeMay

    Ed Askew's ""Little Eyes"" should've launched a career. At the very least it should've launched a massive cult following and astronomical eBay bidding wars, maybe a passing mention in one of those old San Francisco Rolling Stones. ""Little Eyes"" sounds like Bob Dylan, and not <em>Blood on the Tracks</em> Dylan, but blush-faced<em> Freewheelin' </em>Dylan<em>.</em> Which can't be, of course, but it's a nice thought to have during the opening moments of an album.</p><p>
    All that minor fame couldn't have been either, as <em>Little Eyes</em> languished unissued after Askew put it to tape in 1970 up until De Stijl drug it up. This is not entirely surprising: Askew's debut, re-released in 2005 as <em>Ask the Unicorn</em>, was an obscure record on the obscure (now revered) ESP-Disk label. It is difficult even to confirm if Askew was Ed's given name or a cute label befitting his appearance and sound. Still, with his ESP-Disk flailing, Askew sat down to ""capture his live sound,"" a hilarious put-on given that <em>Unicorn</em> didn't exactly sound like a Phil Spector joint.</p><p>
    The Dylan parallels are superficial and obvious; Askew's high-tenor sounds like yarn looks and he works on the trebly tiple-- ten-stringed (sometimes twelve) national instrument of Colombia-- that sounds a lot like a poorly recorded acoustic guitar bleating knotty rhythms. There is a harmonica. Unlike many artists to whom the tag is applied, Askew's sound actually fits in pretty well with the ""freak folk"" sound and aesthetic, or at least he looks better there than in ""next Dylan"" fatigues.  <em>Little Eyes</em> accrues a vaguely psychedelic sheen both through Askew's lyrical fascinations-- cosmos, nature, things phantasmagorical-- as well as through tonal slurring: remember the last time you listened to an album with no bass tones of substance, how the whinnies and pitters suck and distort.
    </p>
<p>
    Surprisingly, Askew's best when he forces this issue, partly because his attempts at standard folk/blues constructs-- ""Waiting in the Station"", ""My Love is a Red, Red Rose""-- make him sound either unnecessary or amateurish. So it's the narrow, strangulated sounds of ""The Face of Fire"" or ""Oh, All the Gold and Green Eyes"" where Askew excels. On ""Old Mother Moon"", the only track to noticeably feature any instrument other than a tiple or a harmonica (Askew plays a piano), Askew sputters his words with weird accents and in unconnected patterns, such that it sort of sounds like someone trying valiantly to turn the Velvet Underground's ""The Murder Mystery"" into music for a doctor's office. The title track, as smitten as Askew ever seems, alternates simple harp with prim romantic verse: ""Ohhhhhh what have I/ I see you/ In the sun/ But the sun never sets and the moon never shines/ Little eyes.""
    </p>
<p>
    The six live tracks added to the end of <em>Little Eyes</em>-- only ""Red Rose"" is repeated-- are a nice bonus and mostly indistinguishable from the ""studio"" material, much of which was reportedly recorded in one take anyway. Sixteen tracks, though, of a folksinger who neither frightens nor soothes, who's never angry and only a little in love, chafes. Askew plays a tiple and sounds a little bit like Bob Dylan, and for three in a half decades people all but forgot he existed; ""Little Eyes"" is the loveliest of songs, its creator a fanciful what-if.

    a fine line between crazy-stupid and crazy-genius. In the 1970s George
    Clinton and his P-Funk crew typified the latter concept; They devised
    album covers inspired by both Stanley Kubrick's <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>
    and <em>Shaft</em>, freaked out like the universe's most flamboyant muppets,
    and concocted grooves with a warped funkiness that has yet to be topped. Whacked-R&amp;B purveyors Georgia Anne Muldrow and
    Dudley Perkins most likely have multiple copies of almost every LP George Clinton ever had a hand in. Everything about <em>The Message Uni Versa</em>--
    from its trippy illustrated cover to its outer space-inspired title to
    its bulbous beats and Utopian lyrics-- feels like a well-meaning
    tribute to the P-Funk aura. But the love letter often sounds like a
    parody thanks to its overwhelming sense of half-assed-ness. While the
    loping, bass-heavy genre was born with a satisfied casualness, this
    is just ridiculous-- of the album's 20 tracks, only about half are
    true-to-life songs and the central hippiefied messages are afterthoughts at best. And instead of Clinton's bracing LCD-laced absurdity, <em>Uni Versa</em> finds Perkins and Muldrow huffing and puffing their way to becoming babbling peaceniks too high to think clearly but not high enough to enter another realm of thought all together.</p><p>
    There's
    no doubt this couple are soul mates-- Perkins is the eternally
    smoked-out, goofy-voiced Stones Throw rebel too unfocused to ever
    achieve greatness, Muldrow is the eternally smoked-out, second rate-Badu-style Stones Throw rebel too spacey to ever make some genuine
    earth-shaking funk. They're the bumbling duo who would sneak
    into the trees behind the high school come lunch time. Encouraging
    each other's most flighty tendencies, the record is peppered with three
    stupendously dumb and unfunny skits in which the duo converse in faux-medieval accents while the MIDI soundtrack to <em>King's
    Quest VI</em> diddles away (sample exchange: ""Hark, who goes there?"" ""It is
    I, fair lady!""). The skit trilogy makes Martin Lawrence's King Arthur
    farce <em>Black Knight</em> seem like a haughty slice of period piece Oscar bait. And the filler doesn't stop there: lazy, abbreviated
    beats, new reverb plug-in tests, and five full minutes
    of ambient party noise waste time in-between the duo's more legitimate
    attempts at modern hip-hop funk.</p><p>
    Even on the few odd tracks that could pass for P-Funk C-sides including ""One"" and ""Godunit"", Perkins manages to tank them with his wearisome ODB-meets-Chappelle flow and sub-""Sesame Street"" motivational gobbledygook  (""We came here to light your way/ 'Til you see a brighter day""). Funkadelic's
    sometimes brutal commentary and harsh realities are diluted into the
    sound byte nostalgia of an over-the-bend Deadhead. This album couldn't
    get the most funk-starved nation under its groove. No asses will follow
    it. It will not lead to anyone having sex. It's perfunctory funk for desperate neo-soulsters. ""Wake up and don't sleep -- don't be so lazy,"" advises Perkins on the
    numbingly vague anti-Bush diatribe ""War Drums"". Message, meet mirror.</p></div>"|11073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11073-the-message-uni-versa/|4.0|Ryan Dombal

Using the broadest strokes imaginable, gravelly and grizzly Hood is the endlessly vigilant, fiercely protective papa bear, while laconic slick-talker Cooley the hell-raising, yarn-spinning fuck-up.</p><p>
    There's always been plenty of wiggle room on either side, of course (Cooley's tensely domestic ""Loaded Gun in the Closet"", Hood's ball-busting ""Aftermath USA""), but with the departure of talented third songwriter Jason Isbell, DBT's two founding members solidify their positions within the group on its seventh studio album, <em>Brighter Than Creation's Dark</em>. What at first blush might sound like unhealthy entrenchment turns out to be a brilliant study in duality, as Cooley and Hood-- seemingly in
    conversation with one another-- weigh the respective pulls of decadence and dependability.</p><p>
    The more conventional, traditional Cooley may not win as many critical plaudits as the idiosyncratic Hood, but he's outclassed his comrade over the group's last two, uneven records, contributing gems like ""Where the Devil Don't Stay"" and ""Space City"" while Hood was busy handing out self-help bromides. A tougher, smarter, funnier version of the prototypical alt-country gunslinger, Cooley's in rare wise-cracking form this time around, unspooling quick-witted, sin-soaked vignettes of colorful loners and losers that hearken back to DBT's pre-<em>Southern Rock Opera </em>incarnation as supreme<em> </em>underground redneck jokesters. ""Bob"" and ""Lisa's Birthday"" are both superbly funny character sketches (sorry, no Leon Kompowski cameo on the latter), while ""Self Destructive Zones"" offers a head-spinning, sardonically knowing tour of the past 20 years of angst-rock. But Cooley's most welcome contribution might be the blistering ""3 Dimes Down"", a loose-limbed groover from a story-centric band that's too often a lumbering musical beast.
    </p><p>
    While brother-in-arms Cooley tosses off seemingly effortless odes to fast cars and booze-fueled loving, Hood is still busy being the Tony Soprano of southern rock, an imposing man's man who nonetheless opens up his rawest emotional wounds for inspection. Bathos may have burdened much of his songwriting post-<em>SRO</em>, but Hood sounds reborn here thanks to a newly crystallized focus-- fatherhood. In a less emotionally seasoned songwriter's hands such frequent invocations of dads and kids might seem like a gimmick, but Hood has long been amused, compelled, and inspired by the family, going back to ""Zoloft"", ""Sink Hole"", and the immortal ""The Southern Thing"". Here though, Hood's hearth-honed eye is specifically trained on children, the ones we try to support and protect (""The Righteous Path"", ""Goode's Field Road""), and the ones we sometimes tragically leave behind. Such is the self-excoriating scenario that drives the war-themed ""That Man I Shot"", wherein our protagonist kills an enemy combatant and can't help wondering about the little ones he may have rendered fatherless. That emotional crescendo is followed closely by the similarly pained ""The Home Front"", which tautly conveys the worry of a wife and mother waiting for her man to come back from battle. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's a mostly harrowing cycle that Hood has woven in the midst of Cooley's debauched ditties (with first-time frontwoman Shonna Tucker striking an equitable balance with her three appropriately gritty but generically sung contributions), but it's not all fatherly hand-wringing, thanks at least to the succinctly-phrased ode to decompression, ""Daddy Needs a Drink"". Irresponsible rabble-rouser or put-upon parent, that's a sentiment every grown-ass man can appreciate.

    Aloha's history is geographic distance (the members spread across the eastern half of the country) bridged by sporadic meet-ups to record-- best illustrated by <a href=""https://www.polyvinylrecords.com/press/photos/high_res/singapore4am.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong></strong><strong>
    this photo</strong></a>:<span><span></span> the four members sitting next to one another in an airport terminal,
    carry-on luggage at their feet.<span> </span>On
    the far right T.J. Lipple, with headphones on, taps away at a MacBook.<span> </span>When the members of Aloha get to the studio, they treat it like a hotel, as well; milking it for all its amenities, and possibly
    sleeping there while tweaking their music to ensure a sound that
    reflects the mutually loved labor of a group of session musicians.<span> </span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    From their initial EPs through the two LPs that first gained them notice, Aloha's music has certainly always sounded good. Rich with dense textures and non-traditional arrangements and instrumentation (vibraphone, mellotron), their music rewards a good set of headphones and a preference for refined, at times pristine architecture.  The mini-LP <em>Light Works</em> continues that tradition, but removes the quasi-prog ornamentation and offers a disrobed version of the essential stuff that's always been at the core of Aloha's compositions: heart-on-sleeve indie built from acoustic guitar and piano.</p><p>
    In the past, with vibraphone, sustained organ tones, and staggered drumming poking at Tony Cavallario's eerily calm vocals, Aloha built their reputation on radiating breezy calmness amidst palpable disquiet. There's much less decor on <em>Light Works</em>, but still a palpable push-pull between composure and consternation, Cavallario's lyrics gaining weight via a cavernous mix and the subtle instrumental shadings of Lipple, the band's not-so-secret weapon. On ""Body Buzz"", Cavallario re-connects with a long-lost and apparently unstable acquaintance, and comes to terms with what's happened in the interim. ""Gold World"" is less fraught, but still colored by the anxiety that comes with anticipating some sort of companionship.
    </p>
<p>
    Much of <em>Light Works</em> is influenced by faith, and at times, even piousness, with ""Passengers"" offering a delicate admonition that sums up the emotional as well as musical content of the record: ""too much of anything is wrong."" The two best songs here directly address the perceived work of an almighty, and the serenity in these moments comes across as an eerie sign of existential acquiescence. The quick, meticulous picking on ""Trick Spring"" evokes a time-lapse view of a seasonal flower blooming, and the song periodically opens up to ethereal chants and church organ, as Cavallario marvels at the perceived work of his creator. ""The End"", with its instantly appealing melody, is much more direct: ""The devil may deliver me an easy time/ There's riches I'll deny or oblige/ When I'm leaving.""  Perhaps to those who share Cavallario's epistemological framework, this might offer comfort.  Personally, I find it yet another form of disquiet from a band known for eliciting unease-- gentle compliance with unseen forces shakes out for me as unnerving-- but one I thus find hard to fully engage. I don't feel Cavallario is critical enough here, and while it warms his own heart, it leaves me a bit cold. 
    </p>
<p>
    While Ben Gibbard doesn't typically trade in songs about metaphysical destinations, the most ready comparison for <em>Light Works</em> is Death Cab for Cutie's <em>Transatlanticism</em>-- another pretty and precious record about the emotions that arise between arrivals, real and imagined. Yet despite the music's residual elegance, there's not a lot else to recommend returning to it.  Similar to the songs about higher powers, Aloha seems to work better if they work more on the musical edge instead of in the middle. Given this context, the record title seems appropriate, though: With a couple of exceptions, much of <em>Light Works</em> simply wants to float away.

    In its three years of existence, Carlos Giffoni's annual No Fun Fest
    has become an international noise summit, bringing together like-minded
    artists who might never meet face to face otherwise. It has also served
    as an informal history lesson. Giffoni strives to include veteran noise
    musicians in every lineup, so attendees can connect the dots between
    forefathers like Borbetomagus or Macronympha and relative youngsters
    like the Skaters or Lambsbread.</p><p>
    Giffoni started his label, No Fun Productions, with a similar
    intention: to document today's noise alongside what preceded and
    inspired it. Until now he had only put out contemporary recordings, but
    his first archival release is a stunner, a beautifully-packaged,
    highly-detailed 4-CD set by 1990s Japanese juggernaut C.C.C.C. Though
    the group generated at least 20 releases, only one-- 1993's <em>Loud Sounds Dopa</em>-- was ever widely available in the U.S. So <em>Early Works</em> is an excellent opportunity for noise-geeks to fully immerse themselves in this group's enveloping sound-world.</p><p>
    C.C.C.C. were a four-piece centered around Hiroshi Hasegawa and Mayuko
    Hino. The former started the group to try his hand at guitar, but soon
    moved to electronics and synth; the latter, previously an actress in
    ""pink movies"" (Japanese soft-core porn), joined to add voice
    and homemade electronics. Rounded out by the drum programming of Fumio
    Kosakai and the bass of Ryuchi Nagakubo, C.C.C.C.'s sound was sometimes
    called ""psychedelic noise,"" and it certainly had a hallucinatory
    quality-- even their most abrasive pieces are so dense with ideas it can
    be hard to process them all in one sitting.
    </p>
<p>
    Such a detailed style encouraged long durations. <em>Early Works' </em>four
    discs offer only eight tracks, most hovering near the half-hour mark.
    (The first six tracks are previously-unreleased live cuts recorded
    between 1990 and 1992, while the final two are taken from rare,
    out-of-print releases.) Given the time and attention they require,
    pieces this long can be daunting even for noise aficionados. But none of
    these tracks are unvaried or forbidding. C.C.C.C.'s work can be harsh
    and aggressive, but it's always busy, never content to sit in one place
    for long. If you're even slightly inclined toward the hypnotic powers of
    noise, you're bound to get hooked by at least some of <em>Early Works</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    The tracks most likely to snare ears are those whose noise is in
    constant motion, traversing so much sonic ground that it finishes
    miles from where it began. On ""Live at Donzoko House #1"", thick drones
    recall the dense layers of Double Leopards, while on ""Live at Dozonko
    House #2"", naturalistic noises evoke a campsite, synths whir like
    spaceships, voice-like whines conjure nightmares, and guitar achieves <em>Metal Machine Music</em>-worthy
    dissonance. All this bubbling activity can be dizzying, but C.C.C.C.
    could be starkly minimal too: check out ""Live at Gospel #2"", whose
    clanging Kosakai percussion feels like the score to a documentary on the
    beauty of construction sites.
    </p>
<p>
    Since C.C.C.C. disbanded in the mid-90s, Kosakai
    joined Incapacitants, who played last year's No Fun Fest, while Hasegawa
    has pursued a solo project called Astro, which will play this May's
    installment, the first to be held at the Knitting Factory. In his liner
    notes, Kosakai suggests that a C.C.C.C. reunion is unlikely to occur.
    But in a better world, the achievement of <em>Early Works </em>would propel
    the group to reform, just in time to headline the Madison Square
    Garden edition of No Fun Fest that's surely on the horizon.

Depending on taste, the defiant strains of ""Burning"" either hang in the air like a big ball of exhilaration or a knot of frustration. Complicating matters (for those on the fence, at least) is the tauntingly spare drumming of Ian Antonio, who supports the staccato playing with only the most reserved sort of aggression, letting a feigned backbeat or an oddly-placed tom flutter suggest an entire dimension to the song that only half-exists. Sure, for a few blissful seconds, Zs are a rock band. But anyone aching for 60 minutes of that stuff, or hoping to find out where those backbeats and tom flutters might, you know, go, oughta look elsewhere. After all, Zs offer no illusions of conventional rockness. They stare through reams and reams of sheet music when they play live, and, taken as a whole, <em>Arms</em> is a lot more ephedrine Earle Brown or Mark Feldman than, say, Mick Barr or Don Cab.</p><p>
    Remember: This is the kind of band that takes the buckshot vocal melody of ""Nobody Wants to be Had"" and commands its instruments to follow, tit for tat. In choral music, unison voicing spreads a single melody wide, creating a singular, massive voice. Here, Zs use unison to achieve the opposite effect, hammering identical (or rigidly contrapuntal) melodies out on strings, reeds, and skins, all delivered with a fervor that splinters and sharpens the phrases into razor-y points. Tracks like the 11-minute ""I Can't Concentrate"" aren't one massive voice-- they're a scary-sharp mouth of fangs.</p><p>
    But, counterintuitively, it's when the band reins things in that its at its most compelling. In the last minute of ""Concentrate"", Zs-as-rock-band hit their stride when the collection of stair-step sax passes suddenly turn into a squealing, skronking Luttenbacher jam, complemented by the album's only conventional drum beat. Then Antonio's rolling tom figures extend Charlie Looker's guitar part underneath the hissing brass, and usher in the record's quietly rewarding homestretch. There, the bubbling brass micro-rhythms of ""Except When You Don't Because Sometimes You Won't"" resemble the lassoed moments of Storm and Stress, before uneventfully disappearing into the wind chimes of ""Z Is for Zone"". It's this smartly placed reserve, a beautifully smooth valley after a harsh peek, that makes a decent case for <em>Arms</em>.<br/></p></div>"|11063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11063-arms/|7.8|Robbie Mackey

Frontman Sam ""Mother"" Smith mumbles something about a stormy night in his best Mark E. Smith mutter, while his band kicks into a gritty, repetitive groove that sounds like it's being broadcast live from the floor of BBC Radio's Maida Vale studios. ""We're moving north, we're going native,"" the Mother goes on to say, presenting us with a fitting mission statement for a band that dutifully follows the lead of every important north-country indie export-- from the Fall and Orange Juice to Happy Mondays and Pulp-- of the past three decades.</p><p>
<em>Science Fiction Illustrated</em> rarely ventures beyond well-established student-disco parameters, but Mother and the Addicts at least seem particularly attuned to crafting smart, snappy songs that will keep both 20-year-old white-jeaned scenesters and their 40-year-old aging-punk art-school professors on the dancefloor. Smith's lyrics hew closely to the wry, observational commentary that is Jarvis Cocker's stock in trade, pointing out other people's flaws and foibles, but in a manner that's as sympathetic as it is critical. (As he's fond of pointing out, our perceived problems are often ""all in the mind."") As such, Mother sounds conflicted over whether to maintain his vantage on the sidelines or just join the party, a quandary reflected in his songs' linear but ramshackle presentation -- as he admits on ""Going Native"": ""we tried to sell our souls, but our songs wouldn't let us.""</p><p>
    So Mother and the Addicts split the difference between cynicism and populism, alternating regularly between urgently strummed locomotive rockers (the best of which, ""Yeah Next"", underpins its nervous energy with piercing piano stabs) and some hot shots of white funk that show the band's secret weapon is its rhythm section: ""Watch the Lines"" is a Madchester flashback given a few extra inches of bounce by a synth line that's just waiting to be mashed up with Yazoo's ""Don't Go""; and the glam-disco centerpiece ""Are Others"" provides formidable evidence that Orange Juice's Glasgow School is still producing skilled graduates some 25 years on.

    What's that old saying-- friends don't let friends release remix albums? And yet even Love Is All-- a band whose songs sound like an air-raid attack on the mindless consumerism and unnecessary noise that drowns out more substantial cultural and emotional discourse-- is not immune to cobbling together a stopgap release of recyclables. And in their case, the gap being filled is particularly wide. It's been three years since the signature tracks from their <em>Nine Times That Same Song</em> debut were first hyperlinked across the blogosphere, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that the window to give them a remixed afterlife on the dancefloor has long since closed.</p><p>
    But it appears <em>Love Is All Mixed Up</em> was not inspired by dreams of a clubland crossover. As the band admits on its MySpace blog, the source material comprises songs ""that we honestly were beginning to grow a little tired of,"" and so the act of re-imagning (or in some cases, savaging) their repertoire would seemingly endear them more to the idea of having to perform ""the hits"" for the rest of their career. Besides, it's not as if Love Is All required any more dancefloor traction: The strobe-lit sensory assault of ""Busy Doing Nothing"" and ""Talk Talk Talk Talk"" get that job done just fine. But for a band that so often sings about music itself, as both a liberating (""Spinning and Scratching"") and distracting (""Turn the Radio Off"") force, the remix album presents an opportunity to reposition Love Is All's songwriting into the pop realm they seem so conflicted about.</p><p>
<em>Mixed Up</em> makes guinea pigs out of five Love Is All tracks, so maybe a better title would be <em>Two Times That Same Song</em>: Four of those songs (""Felt Tip"", ""Make Out Fall Out Make Up"", ""Busy Doing Nothing"", and ""Turn the Radio Off"") receive the twice-over treatment, with an alternate ""Spinning and Scratching"" thrown in if just to keep the band's nine-song theme running.
    </p>
<p>
    Not surprisingly, the band's more melancholy material produces this record's most inspired reworkings. London-based Ben Garrett (aka frYars) outfits the humbly triumphant lullaby ""Felt Tip"" with a laptop-pop transformation, coloring in the original's grayscale backdrop with kaleidoscopic synth loops. Garrett also downplays Love Is All's most distinctive characteristic-- Josephine Olausson's glass-shattering voice-- in order to claim the lead vocal for himself, playing out the fantasy of every bedroom-bound recluse who's wanted to live inside their record collection. (Interestingly, frYars effectively shows up marquee remixers Hot Chip, who take a similarly futurist if ultimately less affecting approach to the same tune.) That feeling of euphoric escapism carries over to Maps' overhaul of ""Turn the Radio Off"", where a swelling intro that recalls Underworld's massive 1995 techno hit ""Born Slippy"" explodes into an orgiastic tech-house rush, recasting the song's centerpiece lyric (""hey world, I've had enough"") from a statement of resignation to one of resolve. But these hardly constitute the disc's most radical reinventions: Metronomic completely discards the maniacal ska-punk blitzkrieg of ""Spinning and Scratching"" to reclaim the song as the early-80s B-boy rap its title demands, with the song's ""clap your hands"" refrain turned into a Kurtis Blow directive.</p><p>
    Love Is All's more danceable songs result in more typical remixes: Scottish DJ titans Optimo give ""Busy Doing Nothing"" a decidedly LCD-like build-up, gradually layering a sinister bass pulse with triggered tambourine rattles, handclaps, and samples of the song's staccato riffs and chanted chorus, but it's hardly a bold revision. Tapedeck subjects the same song to a more extreme electro/disco deconstruction, although the off-beat vocal samples give the impression of random mixing-board level tweaking. Of course, even this seems more considered than the Bees' prankster version of ""Make Out Fall Out Make Up"", which simply sets a loop of Olausson yelping the chorus line to a slack Hammond-organ Afro-funk jam, if only to contrast her screaming petulance against the band's nonchalant groove. It's amusing at first, but with the joke having run its course 90 seconds in, the Bees have nothing left to do but to accelerate the track into an anticlimactic, brass-slathered breakdown.</p><p>
    Coincidentally, British acid-house dons Chicken Lips use the exact same vocal sample as the basis for their own ""malfunction"" of ""Make Out Fall Out"", but instead of a running gag, here it works as a suitably disorienting entry point to a masterful eight-minute Italo-disco workout that repositions the song's tale of morning-after regret back onto the crowded peak-hour dancefloor where its fateful one-stand likely originated. And though remix albums are subject to random sequencing by nature, the Chicken Lips track is smartly followed by the Studio's 10-minute comedown take on ""Turn the Radio Off"", which stretches the core melody out into a trippy, tropical odyssey redolent of mid-70s Can.</p><p>
    On their own, these two extended plays are enough to tilt <em>Mixed Up</em>'s hit-to-useless ratio toward the favorable side. But the collection's success will truly be measured in a few months, when Love Is All release their second studio album-- because then we'll know for sure if <em>Mixed Up</em>'s rhythmic reinventions have inspired the band to rethink their defiantly lo-fi aesthetic, or if it all just amounts to another nine times with the same songs.

And perhaps rightly so: Anniversaries are by their very nature round-number arbitrary, and punk was always about rejecting that kind of fanfare, not embracing it. 1976? 1977? 1978? Another year, another anniversary.</p><p>
    But considering the Buzzcocks are one of the few class of 76 acts still in action, maybe it's less a surprise that the venerable Manchester band decided not to sit out the celebration, playing a gig last year at London's forum in honor of their own specific anniversary (the group's <em>Spiral Scratch</em> EP was released in 1977) as much as punk's anniversary in general. Of course, the Buzzcocks have more to celebrate than most of their peers, given how well their catalog of melodic and smart slash-and-burn punk has held up over the years. No simple-minded 1-2-3-4 primitive, Pete Shelley (and, to a lesser extent, Steve Diggle) wrote songs built to last: short, sharp and clever rather than bombastic or abrasive.</p><p>
    While the Buzzcocks' post-prime output has been respectable, the vast majority of the songs on <em>30</em>, a live album (the group's third) drawn from that London date, remain the same songs that drew people to the band in the first place. Of the 28 (why not 30?) songs, about three-quarters date to the group's essential first run of singles, EPs, and albums. It's a testament to Shelley's and Diggle's enthusiasm that the remaining seven songs-- tracks of a more recent vintage such as ""Isolation"", ""Reconciliation"", and ""Speed of Life""-- fit in pretty well with their tried-and-true predecessors. </p><p>
    As for those immortal predecessors, songs like ""I Don't Mind"", ""You Say You Don't Love Me"", ""What Do I Get?"", ""Autonomy"", ""Promises"", and ""Ever Fallen In Love?""-- just the tip of the iceberg, really-- have sounded both better and worse, capturing an honest but pointless warts-and-all performance from a band not quite at its peak, yet still far from anyone's idea of a nadir. In this context, Shelley and Diggle are reduced to shouting over their own rumble, with the former's incisive sneer losing some of its edge and the latter's bark  no match for the buzzsaw guitars.</p><p>
    In other words, it's basically an official bootleg, a you-were-there document no doubt recorded in front of an audience that largely wasn't. At least, not originally. After all, the thrill of 1976-77 was that no one had any idea if the music exploding out of England was built to last or, as its critics claimed, was merely the latest flash-in-the-pan manifestation of youthful rebellion. In this sense, <em>30</em> is nothing more than another nostalgia-driven fete of what once was, featuring all the hits fans new and old have come to love.</p><p>
    But there is something here beyond its face value. The Buzzcocks have spent the past 30 years saddled with the reputation as a singles band, but between the hits and scattered new songs, <em>30</em> makes a case for many of the group's album tracks, too. No best-of collection would toss in less ubiquitous songs like ""Moving Away From the Pulse Beat"", ""Running Free"", or ""Why She's a Girl From the Chainstore""-- all of which are pleasant surprises for any sucker convinced that ""Orgasm Addict"" and its more familiar ilk are all you need from the Buzzcocks. No, from a band this great you need it all, and if the proficient but perfunctory <em>30</em> helps send you back down that three-decade path, then so be it.</p></div>"|11079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11079-30/|6.2|Joshua Klein

    There are a lot of interesting contradictions going on with Brooklyn singer-songwriter Samara Lubelski. She's recorded a diverse range of bands at the Rare Book Room (Fiery Furnaces, Deerhunter, Sightings, Magik Markers, etc.), yet her own music sticks to a pretty small sonic range. She often uses multiple guests on her albums-- <em>Parallel Suns </em>includes Metabolismus, P.G. Six, the Clean's Hamish Kilgour, and more-- yet her orchestrated tunes have an intimate, private feel. Most interestingly, her musical approach seems like a recipe for banality, offering slight variations on the same stylistic theme. Yet her songs are rarely boring, and often rich and nuanced. Like many musical minimalists, Lubelski finds variety in consistency, coaxing a rainbow from a few sonic shades.</p><p>
    Lubelski does this better than ever on <em>Parallel Suns</em>, her third solo album. The key is the way she straddles moods, creating an emotional depth that fascinates regardless of how much each song sounds like the last. Here, she mixes sweetness with melancholy so tightly that the two sentiments sound like sides of a twirling coin. That effect is strongest in her hypnotic voice, whose soft semi-whisper evokes the muted hush of Vashti Bunyan, but is even more transfixing. Check out how her thick breaths lift the lullaby-like ""Snowy Meadows II"", or how her cool hum rises to meet the swells in ""Greener Grass"". Her voice has a knack for shaping each song without ever outrunning it.</p><p>
    Still, Lubelski's singing has always been this good, as have her songs. What makes <em>Parallel Suns </em>her best record is its sequencing, as it moves smoothly through subtle ebbs and flows. The first three tracks set this pattern: the slow awakening of ""Have You Seen the Colors"" melts gradually into the insistent pulse of ""Taste the Candy"", which rides into the reflective, organ-driven instrumental ""Meeting of the Sun"". Eventually things peak with ""The Cloistered Palace"", whose irresistible hooks seem to climb higher with each verse. The final three tracks offer an extended denouement, like a descent back down from an eye-opening mountain climb.
    </p>
<p>
    It would be easy to fault Lubleski for lack of sonic variety, and admittedly her appeals aren't universal. If her style doesn't grab you on first listen, all the small shifts and slight curves probably won't register on subsequent attempts. But for anyone inclined toward her brand of gentle magic-- and really, it's pretty hard not to like-- <em>Parallel Suns </em>is the musical equivalent of a hypnotist's swinging timepiece, blissfully entrancing in its steady beauty.

    My knowledge of the Tampa metro area is limited to historically inept
    professional sports teams and a prevalence of the elderly, so I won't
    be so foolish to suggest that there's such thing as a ""Tampa sound.""
    But judging from the sort of bands that catch on with the New Granada
    imprint, one could argue that it's almost like an indie Houston where
    bands name themselves like rappers and prefer absorbing Codeine to
    downing drank. As was the case with Candy Bars on their fantastic 2006
    record, Zillionaire
    debuts with a brazenly 1990s slow flow appropriate for the coldest
    stretch of the year, or at least people who were into ""indie"" before
    the palefaces all got into that beat-driven stuff.</p><p>
    The
    uncluttered arrangements are easy enough to pick apart: unhurried
    tempos, wallflower vocals, and the sort of clean octave/third chords
    favored by early Smashing Pumpkins or current Silversun Pickups. And at this point, it's difficult not to associate Zillionaire with slowcore-ish
    superheroes. ""I Won't Let You Down (This Time)"" swishes between two queasy chords like
    the first five seconds of ""Ten Years Gone"" stretched to infinity, while
    Heath Dupras
    intones ""Get your shotgun...make sure it's loaded"" as if each repetition
    multiplies the intended portent. Things get genuinely discomforting as
    the overdubs chime in, but it makes for a curious first step,
    particularly in relief of its follow-up, ""Loose Leaf"". That the album
    title includes ""Turn"", ""The"", and ""Lights"", brings to mind a pretty
    obvious touchstone, and Zillionaire does a decent job of reenacting some of Interpol's more zippy moments, albeit without the cavernous reverb or the urbanite
    sexual malaise that eventually were revealed as load-bearing. It's a
    far better fit than ""Tonight Will Be Alright"", which tries to cop a
    feel in that sweetly awkward record-nerd way (see: <em>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out</em>)
    but with strangely unbalanced harmonies and placeholder rhymes
    (""tonight""/ ""alright,"" ""song,""/ ""singalong""), it's legitimately
    awkward...like having someone ask you to dance at a Yo La Tengo show.</p><p>
    What Zillionaire
    is far more adept at during this go-through is their ability to suggest
    mood with the comfort of being sad, often when they split the
    difference between clock-stoppers and foot-tappers. ""The Occasion of
    the Water Heater"" provides the record's most gorgeous moments,
    flickering with sad delay and atypically demure invocation of loss--
    ""You won't ever know what it feels like when you try/ It's a scam but
    it gets you every time."" Over its seven minutes of dour New Year's Eve
    recollections, ""Jesus Told Me So"" builds to a noisy climax obvious from
    two towns over from a near free-time pulse, but its tundric space leaves enough to the imagination to avoid becoming ponderous. And while <em>The Street Lights</em> technically ends up with a friends-and-family-only 20-minute drone, ""New Cymbal"" is a more fitting endpoint, with Dupras at his most vulnerable, falling apart over the band's most bittersweet arrangement.
    </p>
<p>
    If
    it sounds like I'm selling these guys short, it comes with the caveat
    of playing another black-and-white game: easy to learn, hard to master.
    Had Zillionaire
    traded in their feathery guitar willows for acoustic strums, we'd
    probably be talking about their ""hushed intimacy"" or some such, but as it is, <em>The Street Lights Have Been Turned Down</em>
    is the sort of thing where it will be tough to block out imagined
    concertgoer talk poking into the moments of silence. If this results in
    a pushier, more forceful Zillionaire, the next time around could be something special.<br/>

Yet despite the fact that Rob Sonic released his second album, <em>Sabotage Gigante</em>, back in September, ohhla.com doesn't even have an entry for him. It's probably not because he's too obscure or not well-established enough; he's been an integral part of the Definitive Jux roster for years. A more likely explanation is that, when faced with a Rob Sonic album, most potential transcribers would probably wind up furrowing their brows, wearing out the rewind button and eventually giving up in total defeat. The thing about <em>Sabotage Gigante</em>, like 2004's <em>Telicatessen</em>, is that it's got an approachable incoherence-- listening to it, you feel like you know English but somehow you don't really know English. Sonic's got a sharp, punchy voice, sort of like labelmate Aesop Rock only with a little less sneer in his inflection. And, much like Aes, he strings together perfectly clear and often catchy fragments of phrasing in a way that turns a full verse into a long string of question marks. Some critics have made the smarmy assertion/joke that Bob Dylan invented rap with ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", but Rob Sonic actually gives you an idea of what it'd be like if that was actually true.</p><p>
<em>Sabotage Gigante</em> has been said to be Sonic's political album, at least in a more wide-ranging and universal way than <em>Telicatessen</em>'s the-personal-is-political themes, but there are so many generalities, abstractions, reappropriated slogans, moments of quadruplespeak, and pseudo-non-sequitur asides that much of the listener's time between headphones is spent trying to untangle it all. ""Dead as Disco"" seems to be a diatribe concerned with the need for escapism during times of national upheaval (""I'll hit the nail on the head tonight/ And no I won't believe another thing that's said tonight/ 'Cause that tiny little radiating engine light/ Means that they wanna make us party like we're dead tonight""), but it's expanded past the usual backpacker/punk rock ""stupid happy music distracts you from What's Really Going On"" didacticism into a fractured anti-narrative that curses out oil barons and the mayor's mansion in the same verse he expresses an urge to ""fuck Mona Lisa 'til her smile is gone."" ""Rock the Convoy"" launches into a CB-jargon-filled bit of trucker references before gradually turning its pill-riddled road-fatigue paranoia in on itself and metaphors start collapsing into each other like an Escher room. And when it's all tossed at you in fast-rap mode, like in the confounding ""Ready Aim Shoot"", it's probably better to hang back and wait for some insight to jump out from between all the verbiage. The only guest rappers, Busdriver and the aforementioned Aesop Rock, seem to be taken along for the ride largely for their ability to keep pace with the kind of baffling, elusively-deep lyrics Rob Sonic specializes in.</p><p>
    All this lyrical density does discourage passive listening, though, and it's a good thing that the repeat listens that are positively essential for getting to the bottom of this record are made easier with an immediate catchiness. Sometimes it helps to just wait for the chorus, which is often where Rob hangs the clearest declaration of the lyrics' real meaning. ""Felt kinda strange when I woke up this morning/ Like thousands of weapons were aimin' at me,"" he spits sing-song in the early moments of ""Teeth Eat Her"", while the hook for ""The Over Under"" makes like a hectoring take on A Tribe Called Quest's <em>Low End Theory</em> quickie ""What?"": ""You can't do the dirt and then use a bath towel/ No milk and honey if you kill your cash cow/ Can't make the moves if you throw your back out/ You can't get your rocks off in a glass house."" (That's half the hook; the other half consists of the phrase ""I wanna do the bump, but there's bombs in the way."") And even if the production eventually starts to congeal into a soupy glop of mid-uptempo stoner-rock-- dude sure likes that synthesized, fuzzed-out bass/guitar sound, putting his <em>Sabotage</em> closer to Sabbath than the Beasties-- at least it's a soupy glop with some bump to it, a simple and straightforward counter to the lyrical barrage that he flows over with a more-than-competent authority. It's not the most involved album of 2007's decent-enough indie-rap contingent, but once you get through your 10th listen-- or at least get your hands on a lyric sheet-- it'll sound a lot deeper. Assuming it doesn't get even more confusing, which to be honest is probably just as good an outcome.</p></div>"|11037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11037-sabotage-gigante/|6.9|Nate Patrin

To further up the ante, the band made little effort to shroud their classic rock fanaticism. Whatever you wanna call them-- revivalists, re-interpreters, or even rock fundamentalists-- that first record provided an engaging snapshot of late 1960s/early 70s AOR. With that in mind, sophomore effort <em>In the Future</em> faces the challenge of holding our attention amidst all these Guitar Hero games and Led Zeppelin reunions <em>without</em> puffing itself up to the ridiculous levels of more mainstream retro-stoners like Wolfmother and the Mars Volta.</p><p>
    Thanks to the emergence of side projects Blood Meridian and Lightning Dust, the curtain's been lifted, and suddenly Black Mountain sounds more complicated and conflicted than the bleary-eyed grin their debut flashed. The Debbie Downer pathos of Amber Webber, who until now had sounded like an afterthought on the band's recordings, spills over from her sobering Lightning Dust material, recorded with fellow Mountaineer Joshua Wells. Coupled with Blood Meridian exposing the bluesy id of bassist Matt Camirand, Black Mountain had no choice but to make room for these burgeoning personalities. While the debut grooved on a countercultural us v. them moral trip, <em>Future</em> raises the stakes considerably, leaving the band's musical talents to play catchup with their new material's epic-sized dimensions.</p><p>
    Simply juxtaposing <em>Future</em> opener ""Stormy High"" with the debut's first track ""Modern Music"" suggests that the band's more profound than playing Nintendo while high, but not entirely immune to ""J.R. Tokin'"" jokes. Starting with a lugubrious, ""Hell's Bells""-style arpeggio before launching into stoner-metal chanty, McBean repeatedly belts the song's title as Wells's banshee howls in the background, foretelling McBean's lyric about ""witches on your trail."" A fitting way to kick off the album, ""Stormy High"" gently eases the listener into Black Mountain's increasingly fantastical world. The eight-minute ""Tyrants,"" on the other hand, sounds like a Middle Earth baptism by fire. With its sprawling sections and gauntlet of brain-numbing riffs, ""Tyrants""'s best analog would probably be ""Don't Run Our Hearts Around."" However, where the latter dims for hushed verses of traditional blues bellyaching, the former's eerie, calmer moments wrench the soul just as violently as the louder ax assaults.</p><p>
<em>Future</em> provides a wide spotlight, and McBean's much more willing here to pass the shine to Wells when she's better suited for the part. ""Queens Will Play"" essentially beefs up Lightning Dust's threadbare palette of organ and guitar, changing a simple church house hymn into a menacing cathedral dirge. She even gets to carry the torch to the finish line with closer ""Night Walks"", a dreamy ballad that offers spiritual replenishment after a mystically taxing hour of dense music.</p><p>
    That's right, <em>Future</em>'s hardly a smooth ride. Whether verified or not, drug use has always gone hand-in-hand with these guys, but here they either smoked too much and lost focus on some of these winding mini-sagas or remained painfully sober and sacrificed much of their debut's mind-freeing vibe. <em>Black Mountain</em>'s strategic sequencing of long-track/short-track managed to keep listeners locked on, particularly for its dazzling first half. <em>Future</em>'s valleys sag slightly lower, giving the listener less incentive to motor through this psych jungle. The sappy <em>Spider-Man 3</em> soundtrack ballad ""Stay Free"" comes off the heels of the ho-hum ""Wucan"", a six-minute piece of all-too-canonized psychedelic sounds, and the nearly 17-minute (!) ""Bright Lights"" finds the band's creativity running on fumes by its midway point. Fortunately, buried in this massive time capsule you find some succinct nuggets, particularly the Tom Petty-esque swagger of ""Angels"" and crying-into-beer lurch of ""Wild Wind"". Ultimately, <em>Future</em> can't compete with the classic rock divinity that's been worshipped in countless high school parking lots and shag carpeted basements for the last 40 years, but you gotta love them for trying. After all, in a time when four rock gods reuniting for a one-off concert becomes the music story of the year, what can any of us mortals do?<br/></p></div>"|11056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11056-in-the-future/|7.4|Adam Moerder

That fact has made the blue rose a plant rich in metaphor, from the Victorian language of flowers to Tennessee Williams play <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. In the latter, one character tells another she has the illness pleurosis, and he thinks she says ""blue roses."" Vancouver-based Hello, Blue Roses are the romantically entangled duo of Dan Bejar (Destroyer, New Pornographers, Swan Lake) and visual artist Sydney Vermont, and the title of their debut full-length, <em>The Portrait Is Finished and I Have Failed to Capture Your Beauty...</em>, may suggest an attempt to achieve something as impossible as blue roses-- express the inexpressible.<br/></p><p>
    These flowers are of a more common variety. Bejar's blogger-friendly presence may be Hello, Blue Roses' sharpest hook, but the album is mainly a vehicle for Vermont's lilting folk lullabies-- she writes every song except the finale, a boy-girl cover of UK psych-folkie Kevin Ayers' ""Hymn""-- and most are relatively indistinguishable. The couple of times the tracks cohere into something more solid than sleepy acoustic-guitar strums, drippy vintage synths, and Vermont's frilly, ambling soprano vocal lines, they do hit upon something fairly pleasant. Too often, though, they don't really work, nor do they give much reason for repeat spins. Hello, Blue Roses? Behold, the lilies of the field.</p><p>
    When the duo's ""Shadow Falls"" hit the internet last fall, it sounded like a reasonably auspicious beginning. Turns out it's atypical in both style and quality, its tuneful romanticism a rare moment of warmth and clarity on a record that otherwise easily fades into the background. Bejar and Vermont's voices ably complement each other, blanketed by Prefab Sprout-minded synths, restrained electric guitar, and a pulsing kick drum on an album otherwise pretty short on beats. There's a throwaway rhyme about ""the mange"", but at least you can hum along. Well-placed wordless vocals by Bejar make the shambling, almost Softies-like ""Scarecrow"" one more standout. Another exception to the album's overall drabness is ""St. Angela"", the only track featuring a full band. A rollicking ""Maggie May"" guitar solo, organ, and, yes, drums, all help to support Vermont's staid, Christine McVie-like lead vocal.
    </p><p>
    Fuzztone guitar and the occasional woodwinds dress up the many
    slow-paced songs, but repetitive, fragmentary compositions such as
    ""Paquita Reads by Candlelight"", Vancouver-repping ""Skeleton Aim"", and
    the typically moribund ""Come Darkness"" sound more concerned with
    melisma than memorable melodies or vibrant production. The piano-based
    ""Sunny Star"" has plinking, rudimentary piano reminiscent of underrated Cat
    Power and Yoko Ono collaboration ""Revelations"", but in contrast to that
    song's poignant directness, we get more vocal flights and vague
    imagery. On ""Coming Through Imposture"", Bejar repeats the phrase ""coming through
    imposture,"" a chorus not so much ""cryptic""-- Bejar's own songwriting
    rep-- as turgid.
    </p>
<p>
    Not long into opening track ""Hello Blue Roses"" (no comma), Vermont sings, ""The time has come."" That's also the title of a beautiful, long-overlooked 1971 album by English folkie Anne Briggs. While Vermont is a fine singer, she doesn't have Briggs' effortlessness, and there's a shaky, naturalistic imperfection to her vocals on songs like ""Golden Fruit""-- in which she blandly asks, ""When will the world change?""-- that would be better suited to a less flowery vocalist. 
    </p>
<p>
    All happy couples aren't alike, but they each live in their own world, full of shared confidences, intimate moments, and stupid inside jokes. If we're to take <em>The Portrait Is Finished and I Have Failed to Capture Your Beauty...</em> as a document of Bejar and Vermont's love, the album's shortcoming might not be so much that Hello, Blue Roses have failed to capture their love's beauty-- nor that expressing love is, like blue roses, fundamentally impossible. Instead, the problem might be that as much as everybody likes to gossip about unhappy couples, happy couples are only interesting to themselves.

<em> Black Mirror: Reflections in Global Music (1918-1955)</em> is an
    enthused, superbly-curated collection of rare 78s. The set was compiled
    by Ian Nagoski, who runs the respected True Vine record shop in
    Baltimore, Md. 
    Nagoski-- a righteous bliss-drone musician whose own recorded output is
    worth hearing-- was once an intern for La Monte Young's long-running
    ""Dream House"" installation in New York. He's written about music for <em>The Wire</em>, and in the 1990s he was a contributing editor for the exceptional and sorely-missed 'zine <em>Halana</em>.
    Nagoski's been collecting 78s since he was in high school, intrepidly
    and often blindly looking for stuff that sounds cool, even if the
    labels were all in Russian and he had no idea what it was going to
    sound like. As you can guess from the title, this assemblage of material comes from
    long ago and far away, all over the globe: Syria, Thailand, Laos,
    Yugoslavia, Scotland, Cameroon, China, Vietnam, England, Turkey, and a
    dozen more.</p><p>
    It's always a treat to be reminded of how much amazing music there is
    in the world that you've never heard. Seventy-five percent
    of this material has never been issued on CD, so both bushy-eyed world
    music newcomers and intrepid crate-combers will find an awful lot to
    dig in these 24 songs. In fact, only one track's ever been released on
    a CD in the States before. <em>Black Mirror</em>
    stacks performers of great renown (at the time) next to uncredited
    musicians performing folk musics that stretch back for centuries. All
    of them are obscure today, of course.</p><p>
    Most people associate 78s with inferior sound quality. The word
    ""scratchy"" seems quite nearly wedded to the numbers ""78,"" in fact.
    However, nary a scratch, pop, or crackle is to be heard here. Great
    care has gone into transferring and mastering these tracks. And unlike a
    lot of digital processing done in the 90s (when this kind of
    technology first became affordable), it hasn't heavy-handedly lopped
    off entire frequencies in the process. Sure, there's a little
    background hiss in the back of Nino de Priego's gorgeous, flamenco-y
    ""Envidia Yo No Tengo A Nadie"", but whatever. There's far more hiss on a
    Sebadoh record.
    </p>
<p>
    It's tough to say what unites these recordings, aside from the fact
    that they weren't made for export and most
    represent a tradition in danger of extinction. Highly mannered female
    vocals flutter on top of string orchestras on a few tracks, while
    there's a delightful Cameroonian rumba and ""Songs in Grief"" from Japan
    (which lives up to its name). A monk rhythmically and effortlessly
    recites a prayer for what might be the millionth time; he's devoted his
    life to this particular chant. But some other kind of glue holds all
    these pieces together: the sequencing, the way the songs
    unfold, is a large part of the pleasure here. A woozy, melted-sounding
    ""horizontal monochord"" recording from Vietnam in 1930 segues perfectly
    into a passionate recording of Handel performed on a piano in Germany
    in 1931.
    </p>
<p>
    When a thing is done with absolute love, it tends to show. I'm not a
    huge fan of CDs myself; I have a lot of vinyl and more mp3s than I can
    count. But it's awfully hard to imagine these songs without
    the lovely 24-page booklet that comes with the set. The liner notes are lush with
    information about each track, as much as Nagoski could find
    anyway. He also brings the listener back to the very dawn of recorded
    sound by reproducing some of the earliest reactions to Edison's great
    invention, the phonograph. Nagoski writes with awe himself about
    finding a special, strange record in a dusty corner, and about how
    amazing it is that these round, brittle discs can transfer such
    absolute magic from one generation to another.
    </p>
<p>
    There are indeed magical possibilities when it comes to assembling and
    editing a collection such as this; it's no accident that alchemical
    symbols dot Harry Smith's liner notes to his celebrated urtext, the
    three-volume <em>Anthology of American Folk Music</em>.
    Nagoski also quotes from his own translation of the
    spiritual-minded, avant-garde poet Roger Gilbert-Lecomte, even
    borrowing the album's title from one of his works. All that places the
    material in a different context than one usually finds in globetrotting collections of <em>ye olde</em> records, which often
    suffer the post-colonial hangover of exoticism. Here's to hoping that
    Nagoski compiles at least a dozen more records like it. <em>Black Mirror</em> just might be the most remarkable collection of its sort since Pat Conte ceased his CD reissue series <em>Secret Museum of Mankind</em> in 1998.

But now with their contemporaries having gone prog (...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead), broken up (the Blood Brothers), become more huggable (Les Savy Fav), or withered on the major-label vine (Rye Coalition), the Fatal Flying Guilloteens must feel a lot like Will Smith in <em>I Am Legend</em>: The last of the post-millennial pig-fuckers. In this sense, the mock cowboy get-ups that marked the band's early performances seem less a cheeky nod to their Texan roots and more a prescient signifier of the band's outlaw status.</p><p>
    But it's not as if this state of affairs has sullied their spirit. <em>Quantum Fucking</em> is the Guilloteens' first full-length in four years, but they've hardly spent this extended absence rethinking or refining their aesthetic. The Guilloteens still sound every bit as greasy and gruesome as they did back on 2001's <em>Now Hustle for New Diaboliks</em>, and, at this point in the game, it's safe to say this band is genetically incapable of writing a linear, palatable melody that'll pique A&amp;R interest. But what makes them a band worth embracing is that they take a genre not exactly known for its crowd-pleasing approachability-- post-hardcore math-rock-- and make it feel like the most natural choice of party music.</p><p>
    So between the bruising basslines, the bee-swarm guitar discord, epileptic drum spasms and bastardized blues riffs (you can take the boys out of Texas), you hear the sound of joy: the revved-up Rocket From the Crypt chorus of ""Hello, Boss!!!"", the excitable holler-and-response between vocalists Mike and Shawn Guilloteen (the former playing David Yow to the latter's Rick Froberg) on ""Chart"", the contorted Led Zep crunge-funk of ""Great Apes"", not to mention perhaps the best Yes joke  (""Long Distance Reacharound"") since The Germs butchered the intro to ""Roundabout"" on <em>No God</em>. <em>Quantum Fucking</em>'s 12 songs convulse through enough abrupt structural shifts and false stops to make the track designations seem almost arbitrary, the between-song gaps feeling more like necessary breathers than markers distinguishing two separate compositions. But it's all part of an ideology where brevity increases the severity-- by confining their missives to brief two-minute bursts, the Fatal Flying Guilloteens ensure that your ass is sufficiently kicked before their heads go too far up their own.</p></div>"|11039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11039-quantum-fucking/|7.5|Stuart Berman

    Since forming in 2000, Witchcraft's made no bones about their adoration
    of Roky Erickson and Pentagram's Bobby Liebling. However, despite both
    figures receiving nearly equal shine in Witchcraft interviews, the
    latter's left a disproportionately large mark on these Swedes' doom
    metal assault. Like equally cartoonish countrymen the Hives, Witchcraft
    doesn't flinch when copping their beloved retro bands, refusing to
    update even the most garish traits of classic metal, most notably Black
    Sabbath and Pentagram. <em>The Alchemist</em>, Witchcraft's third LP,
    sticks to many of these traits-- the compulsive riffing, Renaissance
    Faire charade, dramatic builds upon dramatic builds-- though it's also
    Witchcraft's first overt display of a Roky Erickson influence, and a
    better album for it.</p><p>
    On part one of the epic three-part, 14-minute title track, singer Magnus Pelander declares he ""can blow your mind,"" and most of <em>The Alchemist</em>
    seeks to do just that in the old school stoner rock style. This is
    music for blazing in your parent's basement, the band no longer
    posturing as Satan's messiah but rather hedging their apocalyptic metal
    with a psychedelic euphoria. Of course, overall there's still a
    self-serious tone, with lots of phrases suitable to hear only at
    Comic-Con (e.g. ""Constitution of murder!...Institution of sadness!"" or
    ""In our darkest hour/ When the dragon releases its power""). Regardless
    of what yarn he's spinning, though, Pelander's vocals really pop from
    the mix, a welcome change from most of the band's previous work
    recorded on vintage 1970s studio equipment. Opener ""Walking the Line""
    will cause many double-takes, the song's bouncy melody taking a cue
    from Josh Homme's catchy brand of stoner rock. You can even feel the
    13th Floor Elevators love on ""Remembered"", its death march verse
    contrasted by a trippy chorus and wah-wah guitar solo too loopy by
    metal standards.</p><p>
    With all the Arthurian lore and story-telling zeal, <em>The Alchemist</em>
    could actually be a fun record with a little tongue-in-cheekiness
    thrown in. But despite the looser psych vibe, the album follows the
    well-trod path to Mordor (or something like it). Along the way Sabbath
    riffs and scene-stealing howls cue us in when the stakes get
    particularly high, but the music often sounds as hyperbolic as the tale
    its soundtracking. That said, Witchcraft's made leaps and bounds since
    their debut, back when they'd be confused for the kind of macabre
    Scandinavian metal act that'd murder its bassist for inspiration. If
    these guys could just quit letting their Tolkien complex overwhelm the
    music, they might someday do their touchstones justice and escape their
    current snicker-inducing status.

Millions raised on MTV saw her playing fiddle in John Mellencamp's videos-- there she is, dancing in the ""Paper and Fire"" clip-- and millions more saw her perform with him on stage. But it's a given that only a fraction of a fraction of those audiences have followed Germano's career since striking out as a solo artist, as she's plumbed the depths of depression. Her music is tempered by only the barest glimmer of wry humor, much of it self-effacing. <i>Geek the Girl</i> and <i>Excerpts From a Love Circus</i> remain lost classics of the mid-1990s, but since then she's been hopping between gigs and labels, hoping for the best while knowing full well that few will ever listen to her music.</p>
<p>Germano's <i>Lullaby for Liquid Pig</i> was released back in 2003 on a fly-by-night label fueled by the fast-fading promise of the internet boom. Needless to say, it's been out of print for years, and as per the rules, its elusiveness has in turn perhaps over-inflated its stature. Regardless, the disc has now found a sympathetic ear in Michael Gira, who released Germano's most recent solo disc, the ghostly <i>In the Maybe World</i>, on his Young God label, and last year re-released <i>Lullaby for Liquid Pig</i> as well.<i> In the Maybe World</i> hardly lit the planet on fire, so good for Gira for helping Germano get <i>Lullaby for Liquid Pig</i> (her sixth album) back in circulation, even if its resurrection doesn't reveal the disc to be some sort of forgotten masterpiece so much as yet another strong, spooky, deceptively lush record from a niche songwriter who seemingly makes nothing but.</p>
<p>As with most Germano albums, the album's fleshed out by such friends and regular collaborators as bassist Sebastian Steinberg, drummer Joey Waronker, Wendy Melvoin, Johnny Marr, and Crowded House's Neil Finn, but as usual no one gets in Germano's way. It's not that she's forceful so much as a force of personality, her plain whisper the kind of delivery that gets you to lean in and focus. What you hear isn't terribly fun, but it is frequently beautiful, even as Germano sings of faded dreams and the perils of alcohol on woozy, headphone-friendly dream-state songs such as ""Paper Doll"", ""Liquid Pig"", ""Candy"", and ""It's Party Time"".</p>
<p>Added value aside, <i>Lullaby for Liquid Pig</i> doesn't benefit dramatically from a neither here nor there bonus disc of demos and rarities. However, the spare home recordings of several <i>Lullaby</i> tracks (as well as songs like ""It's a Rainbow"", from Germano's Giant Sand collaboration OP8) show Germano could probably get away with a totally DIY effort. The uptempo demo of ""Dream Glasses Off"" may even be a bit better than its murky, molasses-slow album version, though it's understandable why she might want some extra input to keep from totally insular indulgence.</p>
<p>And indulgent she is, but only in the most noble record-sales-be-damned sense. The scattered live tracks, recorded in Lisbon as well as at L.A.'s hangout showcase Largo, serve a more important purpose than the demos, emphasizing the fact that as glum as Germano can come across on record, she's still an entertainer, with actual applauding fans who aren't all slumped over in their seats overdosing on painkillers. In a lot of ways the modest and totally down-to-earth live tracks work as a sort of pull-away-the-curtain, anti-Tori Amos device, demonstrating that one needn't pose as a magician to make magic.</p></div>"|11033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11033-lullaby-for-liquid-pig/|7.8|Joshua Klein

After two releases on the recently returned Siltbreeze label, Times New Viking have become better songwriters, but thankfully don't change much of anything from their humble home-recorded beginnings. An effusive press release for <em>Rip It Off</em> draws a line from the Sex Pistols through <em>Slanted and Enchanted</em> and <em>Alien Lanes</em> to end at these guys and girls, and while those claims are a bit too bold to take at face value, they make a certain kind of sense: The Pistols ended up holding the banner for all the bands who realized they could do it themselves, and the songs written by Pavement and especially Guided By Voices swelled with the pride that their basement tapes could stand ably next to their heroes' carefully constructed classics.</p><p>
    That DIY spirit is key to Times New Viking, but there's a different sort of reclamation going on here. Yes, the instruments sound like off-brand department store toys, the speaker cones are blown-out, and the recording equipment is rudimentary. They're noisy enough to put off even fans of the 90s ""lo-fi"" generation. But every chord, every note, every yelped vocal, every grizzled and treble-tearing tone is one of sheer exuberance-- they may act aloof, but TNV get off on the privilege of just making a sound.</p><p>
    In a time when technology makes professional-sounding recordings accessible to even the smallest bands, that exuberance is refreshing and becoming rarer. TNV continue to straddle a sort of middle ground that might be too melodic and structured for real noise fans and too sludgy for indie-pop shut-ins, but by honing the hooks a little more, <em>Rip It Off</em> leans ever so slightly towards the latter. It doesn't rock as hard as the band's debut, nor does it have anything quite as instantly memorable as ""Teenage Lust!"", but it's their most satisfying front-to-back listen.</p><p>
    On the surface, this is simply another batch of lo-fi indie-pop songs, but the band refines the lessons of earlier records and improves on them, all congealing into a capital-A album. The clumsy thwack of ""Come Together"" recalls the swagger of their debut, while the irrepressibly cheerful ""Rip Allegory"" and ""The Early 80s"" are unabashed pop hewn from lazy arpeggios, bubbling one-finger organ riffs, and desperately shouted boy/girl vocals. ""The Wait"", with its deliberate tempo and sing-along chorus, is TNV's most discernible anthem yet, but they mostly stand their scuzzy ground-- the slow echoing notes of ""Relevant: Now"", and all their attendant feedback, cements the group as self-lacerating rockstars; too seasoned to avoid writing pop songs, but still too smart to take them seriously.</p><p>
    The layer of fuzz works like a security blanket-- a way of creating not just a distinctive sound, but of putting up an awning of safety over them and their listeners. Only the slightest bit of straining brings you to the pop virtues of these songs, on the band's own terms. Sure, it's an affectation, but its just another way of using the studio as an instrument in a way that makes these songs more intimate by design-- for better or worse, you can't sell a Volkswagen with a Times New Viking song. If cleaner production means truckloads of new bands who can summon their influences with little effort, and even less enthusiasm or creativity, then I'll stick with my tinnitus, thanks.</p></div>"|11066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11066-rip-it-off/|8.4|Jason Crock

<em>Live at the Avalon
    Ballroom</em> is the rock equivalent of the Jackson Pollock discovered at a flea
    market, or the first-edition William Faulkner found in the dollar bin at a used book
    store. These recordings of the Flying Burrito Brothers' two shows in San
    Francisco in April 1969 were long buried in the Grateful Dead vaults (which
    many listeners speak of in the same terms explorers once used for El Dorado)
    until Dave Prinz, the co-founder of Amoeba Records, tracked them down and
    worked for more than a year to secure permissions from the Dead's soundman,
    Owsley ""Bear"" Stanley. Prinz compiled the recordings into a 2xCD set (one
    for each show) and released them on the newly launched Amoeba Records label-- its
    second release, in fact. The title, <em>Archives
    Volume 1: Live at the Avalon Ballroom 1969</em>, teases with the tacit promise
    of a second volume-- more buried treasure.</p><p>
    For Parsons fans, this constitutes a major event-- perhaps more
    anticipated than even Rhino's long-awaited reissue of his two solo albums in
    2006-- not only because it contains numerous unheard covers, but primarily because
    Parsons didn't leave a whole lot of live material behind when he died in 1973.
    Even the supposedly ""live"" medley from <em>Grievous
    Angel</em> was just a studio re-creation, and the real live recordings that
    survive are marred by poor sound quality or, in some cases, poor performances.
    Live documents of Parsons' short tenure with the original Flying Burrito
    Brothers line-up are even scarcer. What makes <em>Live at the Avalon Ballroom</em> so special is that the performance is
    just as good as the sound quality. As professional hanger-on Pamela ""Burrito
    Sister"" Des Barres writes in the liners, ""I have literally been waiting for
    this album for decades.""</p><p>
    As promising as that title is, the artist credit-- Gram Parsons
    with the Flying Burrito Brothers-- is misleading. Parsons may have stood center
    stage in 1969, but this was truly a Burrito Brothers show. The band sounds tremendous
    on the first disc, with a superlatively tight rhythm section carrying each song
    and Sneaky Pete Kleinow adding flourishes of pedal steel. Striking the right
    balance of tight C&amp;W showmanship and loose hippie slack, they plow into Little
    Richard's ""Lucille"" and the Buck Owens hit ""Close Up the Honky Tonks"", which
    opens the show on a raucous note. But the Burrito Brothers prove just as adept
    and controlled on slower songs like the down-hearted ""Dark End of the Street""
    and ""Hot Burrito #1"", one of the band's best compositions. ""Hot Burrito #2""
    breaks down into a short jam lead by Parsons' organ licks, and ""Sin City"", the
    band's contribution to country music moralism, sounds sturdy and steadfast as
    it closes the first night with apocalyptic images of ""the Lord's burnin' rain""
    falling on Los Angeles. Of course, they all flub their cues on the later performance
    of Delaney and Bonnie's ""We've Got to Get Ourselves Together"", but there's a
    certain charm to their stoner haze, especially on their nearly a cappella
    reading of the Everly Brothers' ""When Will I Be Loved"" (a bonus track on what
    might be considered a bonus release), which emphasizes their homey harmonies.
    </p>
<p>
    But it's Parsons who remains squarely in the spotlight, then
    as now. The late musician has become such a legend that it's nice to hear him
    sound so human on <em>Live at the Avalon
    Ballroom</em>, haphazardly addressing the audience or even simply introducing
    the songs. It's all so mundane that it makes him much more compelling than the
    myths that surround him. Furthermore, these two concerts showcase his
    effortless vocals; Parsons may not have had the most commanding voice, but he
    used it well, intuitively interpreting songs like ""Undo the Right"" and ""Dark
    End of the Street"" so that they fit perfectly and naturally among the Burrito
    originals. George Jones may still have the definitive take on ""She Once Lived
    Here"", but Parsons makes the song newly devastating, affecting a precarious
    quaver in his voice on the verses and keening more boldly on the chorus. And
    his solo piano performance of ""Thousand Dollar Wedding""-- not part of the concert,
    but a demo dug up by Parsons' road manager Jimmi Seiter-- completely reinvents
    the song, slowing it even more from its familiar country gait and reveling in
    its left-at-the-altar heartbreak.
    </p>
<p>
    Ultimately, <em>Live at
    the Avalon Ballroom</em> shows these songs in continual flux, as the band
    constantly reinvent and reinterpret them via the circumstances of the
    performance and the whims of the individuals. Even though the tracklists for these discs are nearly identical, the shows themselves aren't redundant. Instead,
    they reveal the Burrito Brothers' considerable musical chemistry
    while providing a useful historical document of the nights they turned the
    Avalon into a rowdy roadhouse.

    world, makes music for the patient. It's rare for their singles to run shorter than nine minutes.
    Their only guiding hand is the thunk-thunk-thunk of the bass
    drum-- techno's definition and essence. After that, though, Cadenza's tracks are definitively
    unruly: sound effects jut into the mix for a half-second and never come
    back; songs swell and deflate without ever erupting; synth patterns
    emerge, but fester, slipping out of synch for a bar or two, or suddenly
    sprouting a few extra notes. ""Minimal"" only seems to address their
    casual relationship with a sense of climax; everything else about the
    music is busy, funky, and disorienting. Even patterns in the tracks-- thick enough to hypnotize Reich and Reilly devotees-- wind up kinky and restless. <em>Contemporary 01/Classics</em>, a 2xCD compilation featuring Cadenza's first six singles and an
    hourlong mix of some of its recent output by label head Luciano, is like a musical cold war, where everything clashes but nothing ever explodes.</p><p>
    Getting hung up on the tensions in Cadenza's music, though, is
    to miss its strongest suit: Its sense of space. Many dance records are
    slathered in reverb so vast the textures of the track vanish, or echoes
    so infinite that they flatten the sonic field more than deepen it.
    Cadenza tracks are sharp and discrete: Sounds ricochet like bullets in an airshaft or leap from the bass
    drum's bedrock on the spring of a quick echo. Signals rarely fade away;
    instead, they're abducted. If some dance music suggests the sky or the
    ocean, Cadenza tracks function like sonar in a living maze.</p><p>
<em>Contemporary 01/Classics</em> is also the label's first CD issue,
    so it's tempting to give it a free pass where it fails. The mix is more
    demonstrative of the label's sound than Luciano's abilities as a DJ,
    but I'd be remiss to not mention that in squeezing 10 tracks into 67
    minutes, he doesn't give some of the songs room to work their full
    tantric weirdness. And by limiting the collection to the earliest and
    latest singles, some of Cadenza's best material gets lost: Loco Dice's
    <em>Harissa</em>, Ricardo Villalobos' <em>Achso</em>, and Luciano's own remix of Selif
    Keita's ""Yamoré"". But I'll leave hairsplitting to the handwringers.
    It's got Luciano's ""Bomberos"", his and Quenum's ""Orange Mistake"", and the
    queasy piano runs of NSI's ""Max Binski"" on its second disc; on the
    first, tracks like Alejandro Vivanco's ""Madre Tierra"" prove that the
    most innovative dance music last year wasn't by Justice or the Field,
    but the same stable of batty Europeans and South Americans who've been
    putting it out for the past four years.</p></div>"|11642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11642-cadenza-contemporary-01classics/|8.2|Mike Powell

    On the opening track of this Atlanta quintet's first full-length, the acidic washes of the Verve's less commercial songs meld with the whiney inflections of, say, Placebo's Brian Molko. The guitars eventually move toward the falsely epic Edge of reason (the lick is virtually lifted from U2's ""New Year's Day"") before mechanical strums change tack again, pulling the potential of all this inattentive variety into a heap of head-tossing joy, more hapless crux of overwritten Dandy Warhol song than prologue track of festival-gracing rock newcomer. Andy Hull, the singer, lends the dullest songs an attitude; sometimes that attitude is simply warmth, other times it's an ornery kind of emotional outpouring. But when the better songs succeed, they leave the singer in the dust, his vocal twists and turns a cacophony among the seamless, inventive components of guitar, keyboard, drum, and bass, particularly noticeable on ""Now That You're Home"".</p><p>
    Much of the album has a road-bound, breezy, wistful tone, well-produced on the band's own label by Dan Hannon. On ""I Can Barely Breathe"", the sea-like gurgles of the guitar meld with car window-gazing plucks, and the torrid yelps of the chorus take us back to another moment of the 1990s, the almost furry thickness of guitars in songs by bands like Weezer and Toadies. The song's devolution is welcome; it's an impenetrably sad loop of descending chords mimicked in every instrument, and while there's nothing complex or entirely innovative about it, it's moving all the same.</p><p>
    The effect is similar to that of the candid lyrics of ""Sleeper 1972"", which recounts the most biological and vapid parts of death and their repercussions on the living. Accompanied only by an organ, Hull's voice takes on a sweet, hushed quality, and on this track the comparison to Ben Gibbard starts to make sense. Who else is able to discuss the morbid with such sugar in his voice?
    </p>
<p>
    The subjects here, musically grungy and convincingly adolescent, are, verbally speaking, full of references to childhood, family, relationships, desire, and sympathy. In ""I Can Feel Your Pain"", Hull sings into the microphone like it's a voicemail we're not really supposed to hear. But we become stand-ins for a distant addressee who might have never heard the message. While this personal bit of memorabilia, acoustic and nicely undercooked, is lovely, like many of the other tracks, it achieves this via atmosphere, with nebulous ideas rather than a riveting melody or story. And ""Pain"" is so different from the rest that it feels like a mere interlude. By contrast, the vocal synths on ""Where Have You Been"" help make the song sound majestic, so perhaps it's commendable that Hull can direct songs that are both miniscule and mountainous in volume, and can achieve the same emotive weight in either case.

    A lot of water has gone under the bridge since Cat Power's
    last covers record in 2000. In the intervening eight years, she has undergone a
    musical and characteristic evolution that's as surprising as it may have been
    necessary. Following her 2004 album <em>You
    Are Free</em>, which perfected her music's transformation to scrawled blues folk, she appeared on Handsome
    Boy Modeling School's
    otherwise vanilla <em>White People</em>. Her track, ""I've Been Thinking"", was a risky gambit that moved beyond the introverted
    waif persona of previous albums and revealed a new facet of Cat Power: credible soul singer. The point of ""I've Been Thinking"", which still holds
    up, is its sultriness; it's a striptease on a dare, complete with smoky
    ambience, a halting chorus, and an unbelievable spoken-word passage. Speed it up,
    add a flashier beat, and the song could be a Beyoncé hit.</p><p>
    That track signaled a newly emboldened Marshall, as she began to refine
    her emotionally precarious live shows. For her next album, <em>The Greatest</em>, she would return to Memphis, the birthplace of her 1996 Matador debut <em>What Would the Community Think</em>, to fully embrace soul music, recording with members of
    Al Green's Hi Records band. Her trajectory is familiar, but the
    unspectacular <em>Jukebox</em>, a sort of sequel to <em>The Covers Record</em>, reaffirms
    what she's gained during this musical growth spurt, and what she's lost.</p><p>
    Marshall
    has become a confident and charismatic vocalist, with subtle nuances and deft
    combinations of phrasing styles. She's no powerhouse like Aretha Franklin or Irma Thomas, but
    she sings well in a low, smoky croon, just a notch above conversational. I
    would have loved to see Marshall wander a few blocks south of Hi and end up at
    Stax, either recording with the MGs (how natural she would sound with Steve
    Cropper) or maybe with Isaac Hayes circa <em>Hot
    Buttered Soul</em> (who could do orchestral wonders with her songs). Instead, Marshall
    has moved a few decades forward, assembling a band of 1990s contemporaries for <em>Jukebox</em>. Jim White, the Dirty Three
    drummer who backed her on <em>Moon Pix</em>,
    and Judah Bauer, late of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, pound out dramatic
    accompaniment, but are never quite as smooth, as supple, or as inventive as her
    <em>Greatest</em> band. 
    </p>
<p>
    Marshall uses
    these covers albums not so much as a personal mixtape but as a
    state-of-the-career address. Like <em>The
    Covers Record</em>, a more self-critical work that traced her own
    influences through rock and folk, <em>Jukebox</em>
    exposes the roots of her newfound soulfulness. At a time when genres seem
    discouragingly fragmented and crossovers few and far between, <em>Jukebox</em> is admirably diverse, straddling
    country, blues, R&amp;B, folk, and showtunes. Few other albums, at least in
    the indie realm, will skip so effortlessly from Hank Williams to James Brown,
    from Billie Holiday to Janis Joplin, from Jessie Mae Hemphill to the
    Highwaymen. 
    </p>
<p>
    Marshall sounds
    most comfortable with the country songs. Changing the pronouns in Williams'
    ""Ramblin' (Wo)Man"", she instills the song with a bluesy drama that's all grit
    and wanderlust. Similarly, she plays up the erotic twang in the Highwaymen's
    ""Silver Stallion"", stripping the song it to its barest acoustic accompaniment.
    I doubt Merle Haggard or Johnny Cash considered the sexual implications of a line like,
    ""Just a touch of sadness in his fingers/ Thunder and lightning in his thighs"";
    they were talking about a horse, but Marshall
    gamely emphasizes the entendre<em>.</em> Marshall
    even covers herself again, as she did on <em>The Covers Record</em>: Her new band generates some bluster on the <em>Jukebox</em> reworking of ""Metal Heart"", originally a standout track on 1998's <em>Moon Pix</em>, but never exhibits the dynamic and control of the original.
    </p>
<p>
    Aside from the supremely awkward reinterpretation of ""New
    York New York"", the soul covers
    are the least impressive here. Marshall's
    pleading doesn't sound credible or committed on James Brown's ""Lost Someone"" or
    George Jackson's ""Aretha, Sing One for Me"". She doesn't savor these songs the
    way she savored ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" and ""Sea
    of Love"" on <em>The Covers Record</em>. The woman who got such an obvious kick out of
    doing her best Bob Dylan on ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again"" on
    the <em>I'm Not There</em> soundtrack is
    largely absent here, even on the sluggish cover of Bob's Christian-era ""I
    Believe in You"".
    </p>
<p>
    It's worth noting that <em>Jukebox</em>'s best moment comes not with a cover, but with a Cat Power original-- and fitting, too, that it's a mash note to Dylan. On the epistolary ""Song for
    Bobby"" she recounts in conversational lyrics her youthful infatuation with
    Dylan and how her professional love for him blurred into something like
    romantic affection. The song is funny, endearing, and even revealing. Still, a covers album like <em>Jukebox</em> should reveal new facets of a performer in its selection and
    interpretation of favorite songs. That's how (and why) <em>The Covers Record</em> worked. But eight years later, only ""Song for
    Bobby"" tells us anything new about Chan Marshall. The rest of <em>Jukebox</em> doesn't even
    say much about Cat Power.

The band grew up on the hallowed early-90s American indie/alternative/college rock boom, and a decade or two later, they pulled themselves up by the bootstraps to throw the Pixies, Pavement, Sebadoh, Sonic Youth, and all the rest into one messy blender. Fearing accusations of cheap mimicry, many bands with an equal admiration for this period over-think their music, becoming paralyzed by a tendency to tip-toe around the aesthetic. In contrast, Blood on the Wall don't try to hide the fact that they're trying to write another ""Gigantic"", so they often succeed.</p><p>
    They do forget, though, to wipe away the elbow grease: <em>Awesomer</em>, while impressive, never sounded anything close to effortless. If Blood on the Wall are considered some sort of indie revivalists, they're rebuilding the genre Jason Bourne-style, mostly with fractured bits of nostalgia, and the frustration from this less-than-total recall is apparent in every chorus where a scream takes the place of a catchy hook. On <em>Liferz</em>, they use even less finesse. Here, the blender setting's switched from ""medium"" to ""high,"" making the constituents harder to pick out. Whereas <em>Awesomer</em> made <em>some</em> effort to match up the puzzle pieces, <em>Liferz</em> readily uses force to make the pieces fit.</p><p>
    The opening one-two punch of ""Hibernation"" and ""The Ditch"" brutally lays down this law. In a tale of the tape, <em>Liferz</em>'s brutish introductory salvo may not measure up to <em>Awesomer</em>'s craftier ""Stoner Jam""/""Reunite on Ice"" combo, but these newer songs wield far greater muscle. Siblings Courtney and Brad Shanks continue to rank as one of the best male/female vocal tag teams in the business, unselfishly spreading the wealth and appropriating songs best suited to their tics. While both can spew bile at the drop of a power chord, Courtney grows into a more mature big sister role on the hazy ballad ""Lightning Song"", and even on the grimy power pop number ""Rize"" she holds back her screams to do her surprisingly expressive, coherent lyrics justice. Of course, brother Brad pokes holes in any lingering sentimentality, using his indoor voice sparingly and hamming it up like a class clown. Whether pining for the next heroine hit in ""Junkee... Julieee..."" or playing the slapstick victim of blooper anthem ""Acid Fight"" (""There's something in my face!""), Brad never shies away from sacrificing tonality for character acting.</p><p>
    Though it lacks some of <em>Awesomer</em>'s scintillating highlights, <em>Liferz</em> unequivocally proves that Blood on the Wall may slice and dice the holy scripture of 90s indie rock, but in a way that's more orthodox than heresy. Instead of, say, adding a keyboardist or lavishing their music with effects pedals or studio tricks, Blood on the Wall stick  to their guns, laughing in the faces of the indie gods by blasting another faux-Pixies song dangerously into the red. Excuse them for being irreverent: They're just punking their touchstones the same way those bands did to their own 20 years ago.</p></div>"|11070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11070-liferz/|7.8|Adam Moerder

    two-piece band and your third man is a vocalist, there's not much
    margin for error. So their sparse take on punk rock is either minimal
    by design or necessity, and, given their background as graphic
    designers and their thoughtful lyrics, it's probably the former.</p><p>
    They've progressed as players between records: I can't imagine the band
    on their debut pulling off the swelling-tide riff of ""The Psychic"" or
    its artful guitar squiggles in the outro, let alone the skipping groove
    of ""Empty Dictionary"". They've gotten a bit cleverer as well, building
    tension with simple but crucial harmonies in ""Form + Function"" and
    ""Rearranging Digital Deck Chairs"", or with curveballs like the fake
    applause in ""Stripes"". Many of the songs on <em>Ragged Rubble</em>
    are brittle, impassioned screeds like standout ""Luxury Condos for the
    Poor"", but in other tracks, like ""ITCFGDIY"", the grooves become more sophisticated and
    elastic, the notes of the riffs ring out a little longer, and the
    pendulum subtly swings from flailing punk into an anemic version of
    two-man metal. Here, Double Dagger seem a
    little less comfortable.</p><p>
    But don't underestimate the man with the mic, whose desperate
    delivery
    give these fiery anthems their spark. Singer Nolan Strals sounds like
    either a disgusted scenester or a frustrated art student in the lyrics
    to ""Form + Function"": ""It's something called context... and without it,
    you're just fucking around."" Insightful commentary either way, and words
    I wish more bands would take to heart as Double Dagger have. ""Luxury
    Condos"" insists that developers are ""building a ghost town"" from
    ""waterfront gravesites 30 stories high,"" and while ""Army vs. Navy"" is a
    little heavy-handed (""Is this the Super Bowl, or a Holy War?"" is either
    awesome or moronic), it's at least trying to get a point across. His twisting of the phrase ""hearts and minds"" shows concern for
    the
    mangling of language and rhetoric, both here and where he insists
    ""language is dead"" on ""Empty Dictionary"". When Strals opens his throat
    to squall, he has an idea of what should be at stake.
    </p><p>
    The more minimal, melodic tracks sound like strident, heartfelt
    political punk, while the heavier ones sound like half-hearted sludge--
    but there's less of them then there are home runs like ""Form +
    Function"" and ""Luxury Condos for the Poor"", both of which are plenty
    cogent arguments for agit-punk in 2007 (er, 2008). Closing track
    ""Rearranging Digital Deck Chairs"" splits the difference, interrupting
    slow-motion headbang-worthy riffery with nervous, pleading verses and
    finding a happy medium, promising more territory unexplored in the
    band's austere framework. Despite paring down to the bare essentials,
    Double Dagger's sound is only as limited as their imaginations-- and
    frustrations.

    bruise-covered limbs will probably seem ominous, or worse, for a while. Black-and-blue-- badge of
    bands too far gone onstage to feel pain, of fans in the front no matter how
    unforgiving the barricades, kids who could never call it a night without some
    solid contact from 10 or 20 of their best friends-- will have to go into
    hiding, or at least off your Flickr account. Shots of Pre singer Exceedingly Good Keex, alias Akiko Matsuura, will
    now have to be regarded with dread, not awe.</p><p>
    Still, I doubt Matsuura will clean up her act, or even cover
    up her act with anything beyond the green bikini top and gold lamé bottom
    ensemble she sported when last in New York. There, her band showed up a crowded field of CMJ noise-rock comers--
    HEALTH, Ruins, Sightings-- by enjoying herself. <em>Epic Fits</em> is more fun than any number of last year's
    punk releases, too, if nowhere near as accomplished. ""No shirt, no shoes…ACE COCK!"" Keex shrieks on ""Ace Cock."" Uh, exactly?</p><p>
    Pre aren't total naïfs. Underneath their ultra-distorted, shrill
    merry-go-round grind (see all 47 seconds of ""Slash in the Snakepit"") are a lot
    of perfectly wound-up, hand-me-down Devo riffs and Monorchid rips (""Nope Fun"",
    ""Dude Fuk"", ""Popping Showers"")-- the type of outbursts that might allow Matsuura
    to acquire her bruises in a pattern, rather than just here or there. But it probably goes without saying that
    London's new heirs to Melt Banana, who recorded <em>Epic Fits</em>
    as
    quickly as they possibly could in a frozen pizza storage facility, won't be
    seeing a lot of imitators. Unless you
    count hanging from the rafters live, which though she sometimes acts like it,
    Keex did not invent. Or even
    perfect-- though lurching around gracelessly is not an insignificant chunk of
    their charm.</p><p>
    By way of salute to X-Ray Spex, whose Poly Styrene Keex can
    sometimes sound a lot like, someone blows a saxophone on ""Popping
    Showers"". Then she blows it some more,
    and then some more. If Pre have a
    trademark it's that they'll derail anything moving. Pile-up's the point. Two
    bassists knock each other's riffs off course. Matsuura yells until her
    microphone distorts. No wonder they
    live for their live show, where no one has to pretend to savor any given
    track. Why bother, when another one is
    already on the way?</p></div>"|11029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11029-epic-fits/|7.0|Zach Baron

    Like labelmates the Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance blurred genres like
    few acts before them. Goth, rock, medieval, world, ambient, new age,
    classical-- any and all of these descriptors were fair game, their
    various hyphenate combinations more often than not reflecting the
    tastes and preferences of the listener rather than accurately capturing
    the group's slippery, essentially unclassifiable collision of exotic
    sounds.</p><p>
    Yet just as with the Cocteau's enigmatic chanteuse Elizabeth Fraser,
    Dead Can Dance singer Lisa Gerrard was something of a genre unto
    herself. No disrespect intended her longtime Dead Can Dance
    collaborator and fellow singer Brendan Perry, but it's Gerrard's voice
    that remains the band's most identifiable component, which also
    explains Gerrard's relatively high profile outside of Dead Can Dance.
    She's continually tapped to lend a certain atmospheric imprimatur to
    movies from such mood masters as Michael Mann and Ridley Scott, and
    over the course of the last ten years she's recorded a handful of solo
    albums and collaborative projects that have kept the Dead Can Dance
    thread going (especially given former partner Perry's
    less-than-prolific nature).</p><p>
    The totally unnecessary <em>The Best of Lisa Gerrard</em>,
    however, is as one might presume not really part of that ongoing
    thread. Instead, the disc attempts to encapsulate Gerrard's career--
    both with Dead Can Dance and beyond-- over the course of a scant 13
    tracks. In its defense, the impeccably designed (but of course) disc
    was compiled and sequenced by Gerrard herself, but squeezing a voice so
    expansive down to a space this small remains a Pyrrhic victory, really,
    no matter who's doing the heavy lifting. The results mostly serve as a
    reminder that's there's so much more out there beyond this modest
    collection.
    </p>
<p>
    The disc starts out with ""Sacrifice"", a collaboration with Pieter
    Bourke that trainspotters may recognize from Mann's <em>The Insider</em>
    (among other places it's been used), then segues back a few years into
    the Dead Can Dance catalog for ""Ariadne"" before offering a live version
    of that band's ""Sanvean"". From there on out it smoothly glides back and
    forth through these two major settings-- solo and Dead Can Dance--
    hitting such predictable, ethereal highlights as DCD's ""The Host of
    Seraphim"" and scattered tracks from her solo career.
    </p>
<p>
    And therein lies the rub. It's probably safe to assume that fans of
    Gerrard's solo work are already fans of her Dead Can Dance work, or
    vice versa, and have already heard or bought everything included on
    this best-of. It's probably also safe to assume that this disc was
    instead intended for those who may have only encountered Gerrard's
    voice in passing, were intrigued by what they heard and wanted a simple
    one-stop-shopping place to start.
    </p>
<p>
    That's fair enough, except that Gerrard's not much of an iPod-age
    track-by-track sort of artist, and best-of or no best-of, searching for
    a simple place to start simply isn't as easy as it seems. She's more an
    all or nothing proposition, and if you like something from her you'll
    likely like almost everything, which would of course then render
    something like this set moot. Which boils down to this caveat: if
    you're at all curious, just grab a Dead Can Dance album, pretty much
    any of them. And if you like what you hear, buy more. Time will
    determine a best-of for you.

    The name of the label is appropriate-- these discs are delivered in a sort of ""oh, by the way... listen to this"" fashion, packaged in attractive cardboard gatefolds that mimic LP sleeves in miniature, each with its own set of extensive liners stuffed with primary source quotations and old photos. The spines all match up with each other, practically begging you to put them next to each other on your shelf, but the music ranges far and wide, from the harmony soul of Columbus, Ohio's Four Mints to post-hippy folk by Propinquity, complex but unheard rock from Connecticut's Johnny Lunchbreak, and mind-blowing art-funk from Chicago's Boscoe.</p><p>
    Of the four volumes, the best and most vital is definitely Boscoe. Their 1973 self-titled album sank without a trace as the band toiled in the shadows of Chicago's South Side scene. They fit right in with the other challenging acts in the scene, including the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Sun Ra, Phil Cohran, the Pharaohs and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (in their pre-disco days), but in the end they just couldn't get themselves heard over their neighbors.
    </p><p>
    Their album is a swirling near-masterpiece that pulls together smoking funk rhythms, strands of free jazz and deep soul, conscious lyrics, amazingly complex and harmonically sophisticated horn arrangements, and assorted other ingredients to make music that fell outside the lines of any particular genre. ""If I Had My Way"" is a stone-cold classic of socially aware funk that never got its chance to reach a wide audience, ""I'm What You Need"" is a surprisingly tender, harmony-drenched ballad that proves they could write a pop tune when they wanted to, and ""Writin' On the Wall"" is a tortured, lurching plea for people to wake the hell up and look at the problems of the world around them with an eye to solving them.
    </p>
<p>
    While none of the other volumes hit with the same fresh immediacy of <em>Boscoe</em>, there's some great stuff on offer. The Four Mints first entered Numero's universe on the label's very first release, a retrospective of Bill Moss' Capsoul label on which they had a couple of great tracks. Their album, 1973's <em>Gently Down Your Stream</em>, was cobbled together from singles, and with the three studio outtakes appended by Asterisk, constitutes their entire body of recordings. It's great early-70s smooth soul, essentially from the Philadelphia school, with creamy harmonies and a lot of call-and-response. But it's also a great example of how the quirks of old small-label soul can make it so interesting to listen to: the drums on this thing, played by Bobby Allen and Dean Francis, are freaking loud, and the utter rawness of the backing tracks creates a tension between the silky vocals and the music that would be hard to achieve if you were trying.
    </p>
<p>
    On the back of the CD sleeve, Propinquity member Jason Potter writes that his old band was, ""neither the most nor the least creative, but we had the joy of exploration and made some interesting stuff along the way,"" which is a decent review of their sole album, recorded in 1973. The album was barely heard on its release in their home state of Colorado, and wasn't heard at all anywhere else (the tiny label that released it, Owl, has a story worth telling itself), but it's a pleasant excursion into acoustic 70s folk by a talented quintet. With three male vocalists topped by the fragile soprano of 18-year-old Carla Sciaky, they had a rich harmony sound, best heard on the stunning album opener ""People Come"", where the group creates kaleidoscopic layers of melody. Their name connotes nearness and affinity, and the spirit in which they chose it is evident in the music.
    </p>
<p>
    The final band resurrected here, Johnny Lunchbreak, never even released an album. The band had roots at King Philip Junior High in West Hartford, Conn., and their story is a prototype for thousands of groups-- start out playing because it's fun, get serious, find success elusive (complete with cool reception by the NYC press), call it quits in frustration when you realize that feeding your child is more important than gigging at bars in Vernon for chump change. But what most of those other bands didn't have was an album's worth of really good, unique songs that show a band tantalizingly close to a breakthrough. ""Tinsel Days"" has a colossal power pop hook and a great independent bassline, but the killer is ""Not a Dry Eye in America"", which shows off their harmonies and fakes you into believing it's a ballad before ramping up to a moody, blues-inflected climax. The recording quality is clean but not clear (these are demos in the true sense), but these guys had it, and it shows through the relatively murky sound.
    </p>
<p>
    Asterisk is off to an intriguing start with these four discs, and the message sent by the early release schedule seems to be that anything goes as long as the story is worth telling and the music is worth hearing. The Four Mints, Propinquity, and Johnny Lunchbreak volumes are niche recordings to a degree-- rare soul, folk, and power-pop hounds seem to be the ones most likely to pursue each one, respectively. And then there's Boscoe, who should be heard by just about anyone who has ears and an appetite for something funky that will blow them off their head.
