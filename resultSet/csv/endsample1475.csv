Zion|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Constellation']|2000-03-31 00:00:00|2000|2016-06-11 22:00:02.254801|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".gv7if9b18g.1.6:0.1.0.$7165/=1$7165.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Is it me, or was Y2K a total bust? Call me crazy, but I was genuinely hoping that
    something interesting would happen. To tell you the truth, I didn't care if the
    light bulb in my living room blew or a giant animated foot descended from heaven
    and crushed Times Square-- I just wanted something, anything, to happen.</p><p>
    Blame it on too much Godspeed You Black Emperor. When I started listening to the
    band last year, I became unhealthily fascinated with the idea of Armageddon.
    <i>f#a#oo</i> and <i>Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada</i> played out like
    monolithic reminders of the temporary nature of our civilization-- two separate
    scenarios for the imminent demise of western culture. The former pointed toward
    a brooding, gradual disintegration; the latter suggested an explosive, blood-
    soaked revolution.</p><p>
    A Silver Mt. Zion, a Godspeed side project featuring guitarist Efrim Menuck,
    bassist Thierry Amar, and violinist Sophie Trudeau, forgoes the thick, orchestral
    sounds of the Montr√©al nine-piece, opting instead for a more subtly orchestrated
    three-to-five-piece arrangement. The result is a sound that, while every bit as
    powerful as that of Godspeed, is in many ways more affecting. Whereas Godspeed
    present a sometimes overwhelming wall of sound, A Silver Mt. Zion have turned
    that intimidating sonic behemoth into a sparse, penetrating beast tearing limb
    from limb.</p><p>
    Musically, <i>He Has Left Us Alone but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corners
    of Our Rooms</i> lives up to its name; silence is prevalent throughout the record.
    Painting analogies are natural when discussing this kind of music-- the musical
    elements are arranged in strokes of color on a white canvas. But an abstract art
    analogy is even more appropriate, as <i>He Has Left Us Alone</i> is almost completely
    devoid of percussion, allowing the album to achieve a more sweeping dynamic.</p><p>
    Adding to the profoundly personal nature of the record is the relative lack of tape-
    recorded wackos ranting about the end of the world. There's some highly jumbled
    speech about Jesus on the opening track, ""Broken Chords Can Sing a Little,"" but
    aside from that, Efrim Menuck himself has taken on the majority of the record's
    vocal duties. Initially, it's quite clear why this is the first time you've heard
    Menuck sing-- his voice sounds like a more nasal (yes, that's right-- <i>more</i>
    nasal) Wayne Coyne. But on further listen, the inherent nervous and unrefined
    nature of Menuck's voice becomes remarkably affecting.</p><p>
<i>He Has Left Us Alone</i> is a work in two movements, ""Lonely as the Sound of
    Lying on the Ground of an Airplane Going Down,"" and ""The World is SickSICK; (So
    Kiss Me Quick)."" While the former does feature occasional lapses into very
    Godspeed-esque taped vocals and reverb-drenched drumming, the latter marks the
    most beautiful music Efrim Menuck has ever committed to tape. Angelic violin
    and plucked cello floats over sparse organ chords, with indistinguishable noises
    playing through the background.</p><p>
    Of course, <i>He Has Left Us Alone</i> will not rub everyone the right way.
    Godspeed, if not the most pretentious band ever, is certainly the most pretentious
    band ever to come out of Canada.  And in case you haven't figured it out from the
    album and movement titles, this record carries all the same elements of
    pretentiousness as Godspeed, including the long album title and cryptic cover
    art. But rather than using pretension as an excuse for a shitty record, A Silver
    Mt. Zion utilize the universally binding emotional effects that this particular
    brand of ""pretentious"" music can have on listeners.</p><p>
    For the most part, <i>He Has Left Us Alone</i> breaks little ground in how it
    conveys emotion, employing descending chromaticism coupled with occasional major
    thirds to evoke a perpetual sadness, broken by occasional glimmers of happiness.
    What makes the album such an accomplishment is the fact that these standards have
    been implemented with passion, skill, and above all, an almost supernatural
    talent.</p><p>
<i>He Has Left Us Alone</i> serves as the perfect companion to <i>f#a#oo</i> and
    <i>Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada</i>. Those records are haunting reminders that
    the world must eventually come to an end; this album is a reminder that when the
    world ends, you end, too.</p></div>"|7165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7165-he-has-left-us-alone-but-shafts-of-light-sometimes-grace-the-corners-of-our-rooms/|9.0|Matt LeMay

Are things really that bad?  We've been listening to this grizzled old bastard's
    miseries since his self-titled, indier-than-Mary Lou Lord 1995 debut on Kill Rock Stars.  And
    what has it gotten us?  Well, those of us addicted to Smith's plug-and-play hooks got it in the
    ass-- we've invested well over $50 on his entire catalog.  Ah, but it's a value, I guess.  After
    all, it's a pretty rare event when we find someone this effortlessly capable of crafting whole
    albums of instantly accessible pop.</p><p>
    
    When we last left Elliott Smith, his Dreamworks debut, <i>XO</i>, was being called the best
    album of 1998 by all your dad's periodicals.  His songwriting had clearly advanced since
    the release of his heralded indie classic, <i>Either/Or</i>, and songs like ""Bottle Up and
    Explode"", ""Tomorrow Tomorrow"", and ""Pitseleh"" featured far more intelligent lyrics and melodies
    than the songs off its predecessor.  But Smith's long-time followers-- Olympia indie punks and
    emo kids-- saw a problem.  <i>XO</i>'s multi-layered vocal harmonies, syrup-drenched string
    sections, polished effects and warm atmospheres detracted from the intimacy of his semi-confessional
    earlier work.  It also didn't help that, from out of nowhere, he was nominated for a very un-punk
    Academy Award for his song ""Miss Misery"", which was featured prominently in the also very un-punk
    <i>Good Will Hunting</i>.</p><p>
    
    A minor indie backlash ensued shortly after the record's release, but the songs spoke for
    themselves, and despite the record's overwhelming studio sheen, <i>XO</i> still holds up today
    as a damn fine record.  The new album, of course, will be a major determining factor in the
    course of his career.  It could break new ground in the genre, taking a hammer to conventional
    pop rules and re-writing music history (don't count on it), or it could establish him as the new
    king of adult contemporary radio, virtually erasing his name from punk's history books.  Of
    course, it comes out somewhere between the two.  <i>Figure 8</i>, ultimately, isn't as good
    a record as <i>XO</i> or <i>Either/Or</i>, though the man's not out of the picture yet.</p><p>
    
    Punk fans will be pleased to know that <i>Figure 8</i> is a bit more raw than <i>XO</i>, though
    the same production team-- Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf-- was called in again.  The album
    accomplishes more with less saccharine perfection.  But sadly, Smith still goes a little
    overboard here and there.  The throwaway toy-piano honky tonk of ""In the Lost and Found (Honky
    Bach)"" is a giant, airy studio disaster complete with high-treble piano, a rambling, go-nowhere
    melody, and a glistening chamber hall effect that sounds like someone dropped a reverb bomb by
    the mic.  ""Wouldn't Mama Be Proud"" is a grasp for the VH-1 ring that puts Reef to shame.  And
    the first single, ""Son of Sam"", hasn't got a damn thing on ""Sweet Adeline"" or ""Speed Trials"",
    Smith's previous album openers-- it's one of the least infectious songs this guy's written since
    <i>Roman Candle</i>.</p><p>
    
    But while Elliott Smith includes some of his least inspired music of all time on <i>Figure 8</i>,
    he also surprisingly pulls out some of his best to date.  The simple, jerky, acoustic melodrama
    of ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" proves that Smith can sing in other tones than his standard
    shy whisper.  ""Everything Means Nothing to Me"" harbors an unpredictable, evolving, vaguely
    psychedelic tune, and uses the album's massive major label budget to its advantage by
    incorporating creative, unique ideas and not overdoing it with the Neil Diamond Orchestra.
    ""I Better Be Quiet Now"" serves as the most affecting ballad here with its acoustic intimacy,
    gentle guitar strum, and Smith's lyrical honesty: ""If I didn't know the difference/ Living
    alone would probably be okay/ It wouldn't be lonely/ I got a long way to go/ I'm getting
    further away.""</p><p>
    
    But ""Pretty Mary K"" sums up <i>Figure 8</i> most ably.  It carries the burden of that ""wall of
    Schnapf"" reverb overdrive, and is a shining example of Smith's sometimes lumbering songwriting
    which, in its attempts to remain original, can become unbearably random-sounding-- a problem
    that plagues this record from start to finish.  Yet, it also pulls some of the album's most
    impressive twists, and most clearly recalls the Beatles of any of these songs.</p><p>
    
    16 Elliott Smith songs is a lot to plow through, though-- even 16 of his greatest tracks would
    be a task.  The question here is: is it worth wading through the filler to get to the good
    stuff? In some cases, as with ""Color Bars"" and ""Everything Reminds Me of Her"", it can be.  But
    how much ""Honky Bach"" can one person stand?  <i>Figure 8</i> is, without a doubt, another step
    down from <i>XO</i> in terms of songwriting, even if its production has taken a step in the
    right direction (that is, away from Michael Penn's house).  In the grand scheme of things,
    however, you only need to hear so much Elliott Smith before you get the point.</p></div>"|7267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7267-figure-8/|6.9|Ryan Schreiber

    can occur at any time. I could get hit by a car while crossing a street tomorrow. I could choke
    on my daily scuz-deli chicken cutlet sandwich. More likely still, I could get e-coli from my
    daily scuz-deli chicken cutlet sandwich. The bottom line is, we're all treading on thin ice.
    I'm going to die, you're going to die, and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.</p><p>
    
    Enter Bill Callahan's latest Smog opus, <i>Dongs of Sevotion</i>, to make me even more insecure
    about my mortality.  See, thoughts of death can linger, but they can also be displaced.  A song,
    on the other hand, can remain lodged in one's brain like a hairball in a sink drain. And
    <i>Dongs of Sevotion</i> is just brimming with the kind of unsettling tunes that remain
    skull-trapped for days on end, like dreams in the back of your mind. Over the past few weeks,
    I've found myself returning to <i>Dongs of Sevotion</i> just to stop myself from replaying it
    internally. The chanting cheerleaders on ""Bloodflow"", the impeccably placed piano riff on
    ""Easily Led""-- these are the kind of things that see repeat play deep in the recesses of
    your mind, reminding you of your imminent demise whether you like it or not.</p><p>
<i>Dongs of Sevotion</i>'s opening track, ""Justice Aversion"", sounds like it could have been
    lifted directly off last year's brilliant <i>Knock Knock</i>. But, whereas <i>Knock Knock</i>
    saw Bill Callahan slipping in and out of the personas of prison security guards and teenage
    spaceships, <i>Dongs</i> takes a less schizophrenic approach to the inner workings of this
    guy's mind. Instead, the album tills the always-fertile topics of sex and death, coupling them
    with hypnotic six-minute dirges of sparse piano, guitar, and percussion. Every note and every
    word here has its purpose.</p><p>
    
    I could fill a whole review with choice quotes from this album. In ""Nineteen,"" Callahan mutters:
    ""Without her clothes she looked like a leper in the snow/ I left her in the snow/ Without her
    clothes."" On ""Cold Discovery"", he mumbles: ""I can hold a woman/ Down on a hardwood floor/ And
    her teeth can gnash right through me/ Looking for a soft place."" I could keep going; every
    track on <i>Dongs of Sevotion</i> is chock-full of some of the most poignant, disconcerting
    lyrics you should ever have to hear. And Callahan's voice makes it all the more disquieting.
    It's as if the guy's dishing out his brains, thought by shameful thought, and feeding it to
    you with a baby spoon.</p><p>
    
    It's also worth noting that <i>Dongs of Sevotion</i> has one of the single greatest closers
    I've ever heard. The final track, ""Permanent Smile"", couples an ethereal, ever-repeating
    piano theme with a few absolutely huge-sounding percussive hits. This, while Callahan croons:
    ""Seven waves of insects make families in my skin/ It's just like animals at play/ And the flesh
    rotted off my skull/ And then I will have earned my permanent smile/ Oh, God, I never, never
    ask why."" And just as you find yourself lulled into a trance by the boundless ocean of sound,
    everything stops suddenly. The reassuring piano melody that has played uninterrupted since
    the track's opening comes to an unexpected halt, its final note echoing through your cranium
    like some cerebral church bell. And trust me, it's an awfully scary moment. All the thoughts,
    fears, and worries that have surfaced in you over the record's duration come to an overwhelming
    climax.  I don't know what sudden death is like, but I would imagine it's quite akin to the final
    seconds of this album.</p><p>
    
    Over the course of his prolific career, Bill Callahan has wrapped himself in an almost
    Hamlet-like enigma. Is he really a tortured soul, destined to be plagued by violent memories,
    fear of death, and an overly potent imagination? Or is he just a master of disguise, a man with
    such a proficiency in the language of human emotion that he can draw hopes, dreams, fears, and
    defeats from the well of human experience, and seamlessly weave them together into a work all
    his own?  I don't know.  But I do know that Callahan has cemented his place among America's
    finest dongwriters.</p></div>"|7284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7284-dongs-of-sevotion/|9.3|Matt LeMay

Don't you just want
    them to get to the point?  Well, now it's your turn to ask those direct, to-the-point
    questions you wish we'd ask ourselves before we go off about some trip we took
    to the Northwest or our adventures in college.</p><p>
<i>Why did you buy Sparklehorse's </i>Distorted Ghost<i> EP?</i></p><p>
    I'd already stopped at two record stores, where I'd purchased a combined total
    of nine CDs.  That I bought this EP anyway-- when I saw it at yet another record
    store-- is a testament to my hopes for the future of Sparklehorse.</p><p>
    But there was point in 1996 when it seemed Sparklehorse frontman Mark Linkous had
    no future. While on tour in England to support his debut album, <i>Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot</i>,
    he overdosed on a mixture of valium and antidepressants that left him legally
    braindead for three minutes.  As his legs were pinned underneath him while he
    lay unconscious for 14 hours, he was also nearly crippled by the incident. Three
    years later and fully recovered, he released his second full-length, <i>Good
    Morning Spider</i>, one of the darkest lo-fi records of last year.  Equal parts
    rage and submission, the album was a disturbing reflection of Linkous'
    post-overdose mentality, but concerned critics urged him to improve the
    production for his next album.  So, in short, I was hoping this EP might
    indicate what direction Sparklehorse is headed in.</p><p>
<i>Did it?</i></p><p>
    No. It's all old stuff.</p><p>
<i>Then why did Sparklehorse release it?</i></p><p>
    I don't know.  The only discernable difference between this EP's ""Memphis Version""
    of ""Happy Man"" and the LP version on <i>Good Morning Spider</i> is that it reduces
    the opening trebled, radio static from 2\xBD minutes to under one minute. The next
    two numbers, ""Waiting for Nothing"" and ""Happy Place,"" contain the simplistic,
    mechanized drumbeats and fragile vocals that characterize the Sparklehorse sound,
    but offer little innovation on the formula.  We also get another cover of a Daniel
    Johnston song (""My Yoke Is Heavy"") to supplement the one Linkous recorded for
    <i>Good Morning Spider</i> (""Hey, Joe"").  This cover is the EP's high point, if
    only because curt power chords are dispersed throughout the song with Linkous
    holding fast to the reins, never letting it become the loud mess it wants to be.
    This is classic auditory blueballs.  As for the final two live tracks, all I can
    say about them is that they're truly unexceptional.</p><p>
<i>That sounds just like a promo Capitol Records sent out after </i>Good Morning
    Spider<i> was released.</i></p><p>
    That's basically what this is. They just decided to sell it to unwitting fans.</p><p>
<i>Like you.</i></p><p>
    Yes.</p><p>
<i>Okay. Well, how does Sparklehorse's future look?</i></p><p>
    It could still be alright. Apparently, Dave Fridmann is producing the next album,
    and he might be just what Sparklehorse needs to make a brilliant record.</p><p>
<i>Dave who? Oh, he's the producer for Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips, right?
    I'm sick of hearing about him.</i></p><p>
    I'm not.</p></div>"|7400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7400-distorted-ghost-ep/|4.0|Ryan Kearney

    pop music formula, it takes a particular breed of musician to elevate the
    juxtaposition to an art form all its own. Elvis Costello and the Smiths would
    probably be the best-known practitioners of this craft-- I'd even go as far as
    to establish a new microgenre of pessimistic pop.  The likes of Quasi, Elliott
    Smith, and Magnetic Fields would easily make the list.  Of course, given such
    lofty company, you couldn't expect the Mendoza Line to stand out in the crowd,
    but as also-rans go, you could do much, much worse; over the course of two
    full-lengths and two EPs, they've proven themselves as a band beholden of an
    uncanny songwriting intelligence, impressive lyrical aptitude, and the most
    defeatist attitude since Archers of Loaf imploded.</p><p>
    
    On <i>We're All in This Alone,</i> the Mendoza Line makes a tremendous effort
    to implode as well.  With its sloppy production, half-finished packaging, and
    comically hyperliterate liner notes detailing the band's many (fictionalized,
    or at least hyperbolized) interpersonal conflicts, the album reeks of studied
    underachievement. The sneering woman on the cover-- looking bored, drunk or
    both-- is the perfect visual analog to the album.  The songs are still textbook
    Mendoza Line-- a mixture of buzzy indie-pop and slow-paced, country-tinged
    ballads-- but they sound as if the band banged them all out in half an
    afternoon, as if they couldn't wait to get back to moping around the around
    the house and bickering passive-aggressively with each other.</p><p>
    
    But while the band attempts to come off as characters in a Neil LaBute play,
    they end up hitting closer to the <i>High Fidelity</i> mark; at heart, they're
    just overeducated music geeks most comfortable with expressing themselves
    through their songs. However hard they try to intentionally annoy-- be it
    with the 20-second digital hiccup that kicks off <i>We're All in This Alone</i>,
    their collective trademark style of penning astoundingly bitter lyrics like,
    ""Strategizing over lunch, the worst starfucker in the bunch/ Your eye for talent
    never yielded much/ Hey, it pains me watching you compete/ At the slut fair
    down on Barber Street/ But if you feel it makes your life complete, good
    luck""-- there's a tenderness and a pathos at the core of the band that elicits
    empathy. ""Idiot Heart"" is a prime example: starting off as Neutral Milk Hotel-
    esque fuzz-bash-pop with Margaret Maurice's detuned, bored vocals detailing a
    ""daily production of idiot hearts,"" the song splits itself in half by the end,
    exposing its saddened, empty insides as Maurice slowly croons, ""I am lost and
    the only way to find my way is to lose my way.""</p><p>
    
    As the album progresses, the annoyance factor subsides considerably, and the
    production even improves a bit.  Or maybe the songs just mold themselves better
    to the production.  ""A Bigger City"" oozes midnight melancholy with a lone
    acoustic guitar and reverbed wistfulness; ""Yoko's in the Band"" is a pretty
    solid Yo La Tengo imitation with its joyous, roaring distortion and deadpan
    singing; and ""Where You'll Land"" ends the album with a heartbreaking swoon
    (""It's a lonely road that you're choosing to go/ And though it's exciting
    you'll always end up alone"") that morphs into a battery of mournful piano and
    horns, and then dissolves into the feedback ether.</p><p>
    
    Begging to be loved, daring to be hated, <i>We're All in This Alone</i> succeeds
    despite itself, thanks to its clever lines and sticky melodies.  Since Pavement
    packed it in, smug, self-absorbed slacker snobs everywhere have been without a
    band to call their own; to my fellow brothers and sisters, I say, look no farther
    than the Mendoza Line.</p></div>"|5223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5223-were-all-in-this-alone/|7.8|Nick Mirov

What do we know about Fatboy Slim?  He's fat, he's a little boy, and he's slim.
    That's not much to go on, I know, but we'll have to work with it.  One day, this slim boy of
    fat went to Claire's Boutique.  There, he bought dangly, plastic earrings in the shape of
    glittery orange stars.  He also bought three bottles of Hard as Nails brand nail-polish and
    a blue and white plaid scrunchie.  Then he flew to England where he would spend the next
    few years.  While hiking through an English forest in the early 90's, he lost one of his
    glittery plastic earrings.  He feared it would never be seen again, and locked himself in his
    room for a week to mourn.</p><p>
    
    In 1996, he was visited by a tall stranger dressed in black robes.  The stranger said,
    ""I have spent many long years and traveled many long miles to seek you out, Mr. Fat.
    Long ago, I discovered an object of yours in the woods of Birmingshire.""  The strange
    man extended his hand and revealed the plastic earring.  ""I have come to return it to
    you, provided you do me one favor.""  Well, Fatboy Slim wanted this earring very badly--
    having been given to him by a clerk at Claire's Boutique, it held great sentimental value.
    ""I will do anything, anything at all,"" replied Fatboy Slim in earnest.  ""You must become
    internationally recognized as the leader of a new movement of a style of music I have
    created, and you must give it a name.""  Fatboy thought very hard about this for a moment.
    Then, he exclaimed: ""I will do it!""</p><p>
    
    The stranger went to his car, retrieving an 808, and returned to Fatboy Slim's doorstep.
    He pressed a button on the machine, and loud dance music began to pump forth.  The room
    was soon filled with this music-- it combined the repetition of house music with loud
    beats sampled from old hip-hop tracks and rock music.  Fatboy Slim loved what he heard
    and named the genre immediately.  ""The beat is so big!""</p><p>
    
    And so, the beat is so big music-- or ""big beat,"" as it came to be called-- spread through
    England like wildfire.  After the release of his first album, <i>Better Living Through
    Chemistry</i>, rumors circulated among the press that Fatboy Slim was actually a man named
    Norman Cook, who used to be in a band called the Housemartins.  Fatboy Slim was unable to
    confirm or deny this rumor due to a serious concussion that left him an amnesiac.  And so,
    it was taken as truth.</p><p>
<i>Better Living Through Chemistry</i> was picked up by Astralwerks in the U.S. and, riding
    on the success of the American electronica craze, the album became an instant hit.  Shortly
    thereafter, Fatboy released his sophomore effort, <i>You've Come a Long Way, Baby</i>-- an
    inside reference to the stranger who had traveled so far to return the treasured earring--
    which sold many thousands of copies.  Fatboy was now recognized as an international superstar,
    and his hit songs, ""The Rockefeller Skank"" and ""Praise You,"" were played daily on MTV.</p><p>
    
    But the mainstream electronica craze proved to be somewhat short-lived when the masses of
    teenagers turned their attention to KoRn and polished boy bands.  At the turn of the new
    millennium, in March of the year 2000, Fatboy had not yet completed another album, but knew
    he had to release something, and fast!  Who knew how much longer public interest might hold
    out?  So, he decided to release a compilation of tracks in a DJ mix called <i>On the Floor
    at the Boutique</i>-- he felt that he could not name the album <i>Claire's Boutique</i>,
    because he might run into legal problems with the Beastie Boys-- and it was indeed an
    interesting moment in Fatboy Slim history.</p><p>
<i>On the Floor at the Boutique</i> compiled 19 songs, released together in a non-stop
    continuous mix.  The record opened with a telling sample of one of the Jungle Brothers saying,
    ""I never worked a day in my life.  I just laid back and let the big beat lead me,"" before
    kicking into the lead-off track.  ""Apache"" by Michael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band, served
    as a great starter track-- it was an excellent, obscure 1968 number featuring lively horns
    and out-of-control psychedelic organ.</p><p>
    
    Highlights from the album included the Spanish horn-tinged 1988 rap cut ""Because I Got It
    Like That"" by the Jungle Brothers, the 1991 straight house number ""Can You Feel It"" by CLS,
    the insane late-60s organ spaz-out/go-go funk hybrid of Psychedeliasmith's ""Give Me My Auger
    Back,"" and of course, the Fatboy Slim classic ""Michael Jackson.""  In all, <i>On the Floor at
    the Boutique</i> proved itself a truly exceptional mix of obscure big beat tracks, and
    certainly, a ""block rockin'"" party album.  Unfortunately, it came out about one year too
    late-- after big beat had enjoyed its moment in the sun and retired to Jacksonville, 
    Florida.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>Boutique</i> did serve as a worthy document of the entire big beat genre, and
    fans of the style found great pleasure in Fatboy's choice of tracks and ""mad mixing skillz.""
    In Pitchfork, the record drew comparisons to earlier big beat mixes, especially Bentley
    Rhythm Ace's superior two-disc installment of the UK-only <i>FSUK</i> compilation series.
    It was eventually decided that the album would be enjoyed most thoroughly by Fatboy Slim's
    die-hard fanbase and folks that wanted to own a small library of great big beat tracks, and
    that everyone else should pretty much ignore the thing.  And that's precisely what happened!</p></div>"|3007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3007-on-the-floor-at-the-boutique/|7.3|Ryan Schreiber

Keep your brain on Earth, and that worm will slowly imbibe,
    satiated. But launch your self-opinion into space, perhaps to some desert planet, and that worm
    will tear shit up like in ""Dune.""  Ego can make a band say such things as, ""This one is a true
    marvel,"" or ""I don't feel awkward in saying that we never recorded a song that we didn't think
    was good,"" or ""Even the mistakes sound good,"" or ""It warms me every time I listen."" Ego can
    make a small band from Champaign-- a band that made only one good album-- say these things
    in the liner notes of their posthumous 2xCD retrospective.</p><p>
    
    Consider for a minute that, not counting their forthcoming live video, Braid have released as
    much posthumous material as the Pixies. The Pixies! Keep in mind that Braid broke up seven
    months ago. This self-appointed importance clouds whatever actual musical merit Braid might've
    squeezed out over their nearly 100 career songs. Their relative unimportance shines when
    they set forth to cover actual landmark bands on the second volume of <i>Movie Music</i>.  The
    rhythm section struggles to keep up with the Pixies' ""Trompe Le Monde"" as the guitarists trace
    the original in shaky, soulless lines.</p><p>
    
    Braid's music never sounded effortless.  And despite whatever theories William Gaddis may spout,
    knock-offs are never as good as the real thing. So here we're given 36 songs of pretentious
    hardcore-- which is a bit like making a punch tickle-- and circuitous songwriting dumped on
    top of overwrought drumming. It wasn't a working day for Braid unless they pounded out a
    three-minute burner with four time changes, eight drum fills, and lyrics chockablock with puns
    and maladroit wordplay. ""Club starlight where your eyes round brown and shine/ Darted out for
    the dimes in world record time,"" serves as example enough.</p><p>
    
    Frontman Bob Nanna always seemed to favor searching for the Holy Grail of Homonym over striking
    a real emotional chord. And this was supposedly the archetypical ""emo"" band! Even Shaquille
    O'Neal and the guy from ""The Real World"" can figure out the poetic riddle of substituting
    ""reign"" for ""rain."" So excuse me if I find it difficult to file ""the current erode it/ I rode
    it"" and ""I'm an immobile mobile"" under brilliance.</p><p>
<i>Volume One</i> packs an EP's worth of killer songs. ""I'm Afraid of Everything,"" ""Forever Got
    Shorter,"" ""(Strawberry Ann) Switzerland,"" and ""Please Drive Faster"" swerve through enough
    unexpected hooks to warrant their collection.  Yet, the last three songs Braid recorded portray
    a band stuck in a comfortable pop rut. Their tarots show that little would have come from
    another full-length album. ""You're Lucky to Be Alive"" might as well be the coda to ""Please
    Drive Faster."" Top it all off with Bob Nanna's horribly strained vocals and Chris Broach's
    Sen Dog-like screamed reiterations, and the water ceases boiling the dry ice, and the fake
    mystical fog passes.  We're left with a mediocre hardcore pop band.</p><p>
    
    The inexcusable slaughtering of two Smiths classics suitably ruins <i>Volume Two</i>. For good
    measure though, the songs are buried under sloppy early work and an even worse Billy Joel cover.
    There is absolutely no reason for a band to compile this sort of half-assed material. The
    mistakes <i>don't</i> sound good.  Braid will always be a legend in the house show circuit,
    but the studio is another matter. A handful of great songs out of almost 100 begins to look
    a bit like a monkey-and-typewriter scenerio when it's all laid out in front of you.</p><p>
    
    Braid would like to convince you they're the Jawbox of the late 90's, a mantle already taken 
    by Burning Airlines.  But as much as Bob Nanna tried to be J. Robbins, he will simply be
    remembered as a smudged carbon copy that fell behind the desk.</p></div>"|905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/905-movie-music-volumes-one-and-two/|4.3|Brent DiCrescenzo

Not that my skin color actually deepened
    at some point in time, but I had a serious soul deficit.  I thought Bach's ""Tocatta and
    Fugue"" had a thick bass line going on.  Growing up in Oregon, not quite an ethnic mecca, my
    knowledge base of black culture was derived from reruns of Fat Albert (""You mean black people
    don't always say 'hey hey hey?'"").  I couldn't have found my groove thing if you'd given me
    a map.  One day, Richie from ""Happy Days"" walked up to me and said ""Damn!""  In short, if I'd
    been any whiter, I would have been clear.</p><p>
    
    And then I discovered Aphex Twin.  Alright, that was later.  What I did find was my father's
    record collection.  I found Miles.  I found Thelonius.  I found Jimi.  I found the Godfather
    of Soul himself.  Changes commenced immediately.  Suddenly, I knew what the scenario was.
    Stakes was high.  I was rhymin' wit' Biz.  I found myself asking, ""What is this shaking
    phenomenon that is happening with my booty?  I must say, this is almost as pleasurable as
    reading Dante!""</p><p>
    
    Of course, right around this point, it all went to hell in the rap world.  Organics in hip-hop
    were replaced with electronic skitter and weak rhymes.  Heart and soul were supplanted by speed
    freaks like Bone Thugs N' Harmony.  Machismo and money superseded authenticity and love for
    music.  ""Entrepreneurs"" like Master P began serving records like hamburgers, inundating the
    industry with clone rappers whose most impressive attributes were their ice and gold teeth.
    The outlook was bleak.</p><p>
    
    Common's <i>Like Water for Chocolate</i> occupies a pivotal position in the current Black
    Renaissance that has emerged to rescue hip-hop music from decaying into a soulless nightmare.
    On the heels of seminal releases from the Roots and Mos Def, <i>Like Water for Chocolate</i>
    engenders an ongoing sense of hope in those who pine for a new school of black intellectuals,
    making heads bop in the process.  Common pays apt tribute to the forefathers of black music
    throughout his opus, infusing tracks with an invigorating hybrid of cool jazz, bebop, funk,
    and hip-hop.</p><p>
<i>Like Water for Chocolate</i> is a musical gift from a man who clearly paid attention in
    ""How to Rock Rhymes 101,"" bringing a guest list that would make any MC drool.  The entire
    album is produced by the talented ?uestlove of the Roots, who verifies that he has more than
    enough musical acumen to go around.  Fellow Roots Black Thought and Rahzel provide raw backing
    vocals on ""Cold Blooded,"" a relentless rhythmic cacophony in which deep horns and concussive
    funk guitar rattle the brain harder than a Mack truck.  ""Heat"" brings the spirit of battle raps
    back to the forefront, floating above an off-kilter drum loop by ?uestlove.  On ""The 6th Sense,""
    Common gets iller than Syphilis over an addictive track supplied by Gang Starr's DJ Premier.
    Cee-Lo's awe-inspiring vocal arrangements on ""A Song for Assata"" make it the most beautiful
    hip-hop piece by a rapper to appear in years.  The list is seemingly unending, also featuring
    D'Angelo, Mos Def, MC Lyte and the Ummah production crew.</p><p>
    
    Like the Roots' <i>Things Fall Apart</i> and Mos Def's <i>Black on Both Sides</i>, this record
    is certainly the product of much thought and work, but it's a labor of love.  Right before our
    eyes, rappers like Common are laying the foundations for a closely-knit family of hip-hop
    zealots who eat, sleep and breathe positive, intelligent hip-hop-- a network of men and women
    who share a mutual respect and can address serious societal issues that plague us all (and
    wreck MCs) without coming off as pedantic or absurd.  In 2000, this is just about as good as
    hip-hop gets.</p></div>"|1564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1564-like-water-for-chocolate/|8.7|Taylor M. Clark

    actually a 10- track long- player, the album covers only 27 minutes
    worth of musical territory.  Don't worry-- <i>Like Someone In Love</i>
    may be shorter than a sitcom, but there aren't any commercial breaks
    and 10 songs means 10 songs-- brevity is irrelevant.</p><p>
    
    Core members Timothy Bracy and Peter Hoffman are a songwriting duo in
    the tradition of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Bob Mould and Grant
    Hart, Rufus and Chaka Khan-- you get the picture. The differences between
    the two are audible-- Bracy is the down- homebody, Hoffman likes his
    guitars shaken, not stirred-- but neither is willing to sing above a
    dusty whisper. And in case any number of Replacements/ Uncle Tupelo
    (they're not as different as you think) disciples haven't proven that
    country is just fine with fuzzy guitars, <i>Like Someone In Love</i>
    will testify.</p><p>
    
    Don't mistake this for a punk- rock hoedown though; the Mendoza Line is
    a strictly low- key affair. ""Wiretapping"" keeps a two- step beat going as
    melancholy seeps into the cryptic vocals. Before you know it, the two-
    step's done and the fuzz-fi peach ""I Know I Will Not Find The Words""
    looks at like- minded lyrics through a pure pop lens. Bracy and Hoffman
    grew up in the Washington, D.C. area and the influence of such brainy
    popsters as Unrest and Velocity Girl is obvious and welcome. But there's
    no need to pigeonhole.  Pop is just one element of many crammed onto this
    disc.</p><p>
    
    The Mendoza Line seem to relish the thought that what they're doing is
    mostly mediocre.  The name itself is the term used to describe when a
    baseball player falls below .200 (for those not familiar with baseball
    terminology, .200 really sucks). By doing so, they're guaranteeing
    themselves musical happiness, because while none of these 10 at-bats
    goes long enough to be a home run, there isn't a strikeout among them.</p></div>"|5226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5226-like-someone-in-love-ep/|6.8|Shan Fowler

    scoring with hot chicks, is a co-producer of the <i>High Fidelity</i> soundtrack. In this case,
    ""producer"" simply means, ""Guy who forks over big bucks and chooses what songs are used on the 
    soundtrack,"" rather than twiddling knobs on a soundboard and getting stoned on hashish.  Cusack
    and his co-producers take care to choose music that very specifically fits the themes,
    characters, and situations of the film. It's an ideal collection of songs for all us
    semi-geeky, under-sexed fellows who idolize Cusack, and sublimate untapped sexual energy in the
    form of esoteric rock lists, bitchy reviews, obscure album collections, and late-night
    rock-related trivial pursuits (such as: ""Hey, man, did you know that Mike Nesmith's mom
    invented Liquid Paper?"")</p><p>
    I was pleased to find that ""You're Gonna Miss Me,"" the 13th Floor Elevators' 1966 semi-hit, was
    served as the leadoff cut on the soundtrack. The damn song still sounds as advanced as ever. No
    one's been able to come up with a better psychedelic gadget than that bubbly electric jug sound
    of theirs; its strange sonic emanations percolate up through the drip-drip-drip of the reverb
    guitar. And LSD-crazed Roky Erickson had a fire in his belly, set by some evil female arsonist.
    His voice is demonic, like a male Janis Joplin. He emits primal rock 'n' roll shrieks unequaled 
    by few men or beasts, other than maybe John Lennon on that hellfire <i>Plastic Ono Band</i>
    album.</p><p>
    Arthur Lee's Love provides a potent combination of Motown soul and intelligent pure pop on
    ""Always See Your Face."" Lee's lyrics here make a straightforward and direct plea for help in a
    world that done him wrong. He forgoes the usual psychedelic imagery to assure an estranged
    lover that she'll never be able to forget his ugly mug.</p><p>
    Bob Dylan's last studio album, <i>Time Out of Mind</i>, was one of the best lovesick breakup
    albums he's ever released. Here, he continues in that same psychologically-shattered vein with
    ""Most of the Time,"" a song about convincing yourself that the harpy you were just jilted by
    never actually existed.</p><p>
    And let's not forget those two Lou-less Velvets tunes. Get a load of the pathetic creatures
    that inhabit ""Oh! Sweet Nothin'""-- the poor sods that keep getting dumped out into the street,
    and who ""ain't got nothin' at all."" And ""Who Loves the Sun"" is another lovably sappy sad-sack 
    lament from the Velvet Underground's <i>Loaded</i> period, with Doug Yule doing his effete Lou
    Reed impersonations.</p><p>
    Laetitia Sadier's sexy French vocals are enticing as ever on ""Lo Boob Oscillator,"" an
    extraordinary early Stereolab composition centered around a simple E-A change.  The six minute-
    long track stretches itself out over six minutes, gradually evolving into an amazingly
    compelling rhythmic continuum-- possibly the musical equivalent to the kind of incredible sex 
    the characters of <i>High Fidelity</i> can only dream about.</p><p>
    The Beta Band, a group I'm convinced is actually Gilbert O' Sullivan on Quaaludes fronting the
    remnants of the Stone Roses, articulate the soporific side effects of contemporary sexual
    frustration on ""Dry the Rain."" Laced with a little trip-hop and mesmerizing dobro slide guitar,
    the song begins at a trickling pace, then slowly and almost subliminally surges and builds in
    tiny increments, finally settling into the kind of pulsing repetition that turns you into a
    drooling, sexless vegetable.</p><p>
    And of course, there are a few songs here that simply should've been scrapped.  The annoying 
    Jewel-wannabe warbling of Sheila Nichols on ""Fallen for You"" belongs alongside the hellish 
    croaking of Aimee Mann.  Elvis Costello turns in one of his worst tracks, revealing the soft-
    hearted simp side of himself as he plods his way through the tuneless Bacharach-influenced
    ""Shipbuilding."" And Smog, current standard-bearer of indie rock impotence, yawns through some
    lugubrious funeral music on ""Cold Blooded Old Times.""</p><p>
    John Wesley Harding turns in a typical sorry-for-himself performance, in a song that sounds
    like every other one of his generic folky exercises in over-sensitive white-guy blandness.
    On ""I'm Wrong about Everything,"" he capitulates to his ball-breaking mate. Someone must've
    advised him that his music would be more readily accepted by the kids if he learned and applied
    this all important commercial equation: bad folk-pop + repetitive neo-trip-hop beats =
    frighteningly sudden commercial acceptance.</p><p>
    Oh, and hey, let's not forget the ""soul"" portion of the soundtrack. ""Let's Get It On,"" covered
    here by <i>High Fidelity</i> character Jack Black, is a male fantasy irrelevant to the sexual
    mores of today-- it's a too-direct plea for sexual satisfaction that hasn't worked on any woman
    since the sexually-liberated '70s. This na√Øve song overlooks the deception, manipulation and
    mind games required to get laid consistently in the contemporary <i>High Fidelity</i> society.</p><p>
    Overall, there's not that much to complain about on this one, though I'm sure there are a
    million other songs that would've been right for this soundtrack. Where's Iggy's ""Your Pretty
    Face is Going to Hell""? The Standells' ""Why Pick On Me""?  The Rolling Stones' ""Bitch""?  Oh
    well, no matter. Wisecracking, obsessive music nerds with women troubles, this is undoubtedly 
    the soundtrack for you. Wait for the movie to come out on video, though, so you don't have to
    sit in a movie theater next to 20 or 30 other self-conscious, lonely chumps with problematic
    body odor.</p></div>"|7865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7865-high-fidelity-ost/|7.2|Michael Sandlin

    convince myself that the country was truly respectable until Godspeed You Black
    Emperor eradicated any thoughts of Alanis or Sloan, and slapped a hefty amount
    of cred on the Yukon.  Godspeed labelmates Do Make Say Think further the velvet 
    Canuck revolution with their own brand of maddeningly affecting slow burn
    compositions, but they mine common ground to very different effect.</p><p>
    Do Make Say Think's extended developments of melodic themes are driven principally
    by guitar, but soon explode into grand crescendos that run the gamut from free jazz
    (""When Day Chokes the Night"") to pensive lock-grooves (""Minmin"").  Their work is
    definitely a certain kind of ""post-rock,"" but thankfully, they steer clear of generic
    Tortoisisms.</p><p>
    Two drummers duel subliminally for the rhythmic steering wheel while warm keyboards
    and effects do their part in articulating the distinctive texture.  However, it's
    the sound of the guitar that lends this album its cohesive sound.  The six strings
    creep around corners with repeated melodic refrains, a rough sound played with a
    delicacy that belies the stamping of the distortion pedal that will strike as
    surely as the apocalypse.</p><p>
    Each song has its particular crest, and while Do Make Say Think follow the formula
    religiously, the tension they build with each release cancels any lethargy.
    Fittingly, the final track, ""Goodbye Enemy Airship,"" erupts as if the previous
    tracks were mere tremors.  It's this band's ""Mogwai Fear Satan,"" an effects-laden
    cloud enveloping a determined bass pulse.</p><p>
    The six-strong line-up recorded this album in a barn, and a moving sense of
    dramatic isolation is felt as the song-cycle of <i>Goodbye Enemy Airship the
    Landlord is Dead</i> unfolds.  It's like walking down a beaten country road
    littered with inclines and declines at night and not daring to deviate from the
    path or look back.  Each chord is a step forward, each outburst a cathartic cry
    to the domineering starry sky.  Do Make Say Think have imbued their second album
    with such a strong sense of purpose and an indefatigable belief in their
    characteristic sound that comparisons become largely irrelevant.  That they
    succeed so well on their own terms without weighing their music down with 
    tired post-rock clich√©s makes their work that much more compelling.</p></div>"|2398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2398-goodbye-enemy-airship-the-landlord-is-dead/|7.9|S. Murray

    has now nearly completely resigned its role in the musical world to fodder for car
    commercials?  It's getting to the point that the only notion that traditional drum-n-bass
    inspires in me is the sudden urge to rush out and take a Pontiac for a test drive. 
    Lamentably, Spring Heel Jack were one of the few reputable drum-n-bass acts to allow
    the man to devour their soul by signing to Island back in the mid 90's and utilizing the
    big corporate dollar by releasing two strikingly mediocre albums, <i>68 Million Shades</i>
    and <i>Busy, Curious, Thirsty</i>.  Both of these can now be discovered in dollar bins
    throughout this great land of ours.</p><p>
    
    ""Taylor,"" you may ask. ""Is there any one aspect of drum-n-bass which has brought about
    its impending demise?""  Why, yes.  I'm glad you asked.  The answer is that stupid
    two-step beat which is the foundation of your archetypal drum-n-bass track.  Regardless
    of how much bleeping and rapid-fire drum machine skitter is layered over this rhythm, it
    all still sounds fundamentally the same after a certain point.  Incidentally, that point
    was late 1998.  To its credit, <i>Treader</i> kicks off with ""Is,"" a nice serving of
    sample-funk which slices up intriguing beats and serves them with an electric garnish in
    the temperament of a good Clifford Gilberto or Coldcut track.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, ""Is"" is a lonely, deserted island amidst a vast 73 minute ocean of
    prototypical drum-n-bass, inundated with two-step.  Even tracks like ""Toledo"" and
    ""Winter"" which start out promisingly enough eventually sink under the weight of the
    ubiquitous two-step.  As the genre goes, <i>Treader</i> exemplifies skilled production
    and attention to detail, but falters in the innovation department.  The digital creations
    concocted by Spring Heel Jack are nicely textured and evolve naturally to a degree, but
    never manage to escape repetitiveness.  Merely altering the drum sounds used to make the
    same beat from song to song doesn't qualify as sufficient modification of the genre.</p><p>
    
    Also grazed by <i>Treader</i> is avant-garde symphonic electronica which fails to spark
    much interest, as it's comprised simply of linked chords which seem totally incongruous. 
    ""More Stuff No One Saw"" and ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" could have been stellar with a finer
    touch of rhythmic variety, yet ultimately end up repetitive.  In all, the typical
    drum-n-bass explored on <i>Treader</i> becomes rather inane somewhere around the seventh
    minute of each song.  Those who'd harbored a fondness for drum-n-bass back in the day are
    hereby duly notified that the genre has not expired, but mutated.  The future of
    electronica is being realized by those like Amon Tobin and the kind people at Ninja Tune,
    whose blood is infused with the irrepressible seeds of innovation.</p></div>"|7436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7436-treader/|5.4|Taylor M. Clark

    prowess.  Their 1997 self-titled debut presented an incredibly sloppy band whose sometimes
    epic songs carried enough personality and originality to transcend their inability to hold
    music together.  The drums were offbeat, the guitars were out of tune, and vocalists Tom
    Cullinan and Nina Pascale weren't going to win any awards for pitch.  <i>Precious Falling</i>
    showed a much more proficient Quickspace willing to add more layers to their generally simple
    song structures.  Sadly, the album was padded with a bunch of bizarre, experimental filler
    which failed to interest anyone.</p><p>
    
    On their third album, the band fronted by Th' Faith Healers' Tom Cullinan are in full form.
    <i>The Death of Quickspace</i> offers a new batch of nine of the band's trademark subtlety
    and inexplicably seductive melodies.  Not that you'd know it from the way the record opens.
    ""The Lobbalong Song"" fades in quickly, fades out, then fades back in with uncertainty.  This
    weirdness is followed by an unexpected jolt from Nina Pascale's heavily-distorted Cockney
    banshee wail.  She shrieks with an intense conviction-- whatever she's yelling about, she
    means it.</p><p>
    
    ""The Lobbalong Song"" is by far the record's most abrasive moment, but by sequencing it as the
    opening cut, Quickspace are laying exactly who they are on the table.  Initially, Pascale's
    aggravated cry grates, but midway through the track, the melody becomes strangely irresistable.
    Then, suddenly, the gentle picking of electric guitar strings introduces the album's dark
    highlight, ""They Shoot Horse Don't They,"" over a naive pop drumbeat. Over seven minutes, the
    song works up to a frenzied climax, piling on layers of distorted guitar-pounding and howling
    keyboard effects.</p><p>
    
    Quickspace are out on tour right now with Yo La Tengo, and it's not hard to see why.  In many
    respects, Quickspace are a more rhythmically-oriented Yo La Tengo.  The band's melodies are
    always passionate and engaging, but surprisingly simple.  Whether cranking out a three-and-a-half
    chord, angular sans-vocal screamer like ""Munchers No Munchers,"" or the psychedelic electric slide
    guitar ballad ""The Rose,"" their songs are inescapably catchy without resorting on cloying twee
    pop tendencies, conventional pop song structures, or even hooks at all.  Yes, this is pop music,
    but not at all in a traditional sense.</p><p>
    
    It should be amazing that Quickspace can stretch these raw, basic songs out to over five (and
    sometimes ten) minutes without becoming boring, but it's not-- that's largely due to the amount
    of variation their songs contain.  On the winding, 10+ minute ""Climbing a Hill,"" the lyrics--
    divided into two seperate vocal parts-- bounce over minor-key resignation.  A few minutes later,
    we're thrust head-first into an elaborate and expertly delivered four-minute guitar part that
    switches from delicate picking and sliding to Kaplan-esque steel-scraping buzz.</p><p>
    
    The album ends somewhat strangely, with the violin-laced instrumental ""Lob It"" and the
    30-second-long punk riff, ""4.""  I can't say I'd have gone out like that, but then again,
    I'm not a talented five-piece with a history of great albums behind me.  Still, a track
    like the standout pop ballad, ""Gloriana,"" with its beautifully produced, thick, multi-tracked 
    vocal harmonies, and exploding, mangled guitar would serve as the ultimate closer to any
    album.  But the end songs, weird as they may be, are still great for what they try to
    accomplish, and when the disc stops spinning after its 45-minute duration, we're left with
    an album that finally realizes the potential that has always surrounded this band's records.
    I think it's only gonna get better from here.</p></div>"|6603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6603-the-death-of-quickspace/|8.3|Ryan Schreiber

Generally speaking, the boredom factor
    increases proportionately as a song lengthens.  There are some notable exceptions to this
    rule, but it's only the truly gifted band that can pull off an epic without sounding
    presumptuous or sedated.  As Six by Seven proved on their last outing, the somnolent <i>The
    Things We Make</i>, they're definitely not one of those bands.</p><p>
    
    Wisely, on <i>The Closer You Get</i>, Six by Seven shun any epic aspirations, opting instead to
    streamline their sound.  Gone are the interminable, lazy guitar noodling of ""European Me.""
    Petals are pressed to the floor.  Guitars mimic helicopters.  Drums resemble a bumpy subway
    ride.  And frontman Chris Olley sounds positively rabid beneath the raging volume.  No longer
    finding solace in drawn-out detachment, Six by Seven are now focused and agitated.  The results
    are immediate, and, at the very least, demand to be heard.</p><p>
    
    From the explosive opening monolith, ""Eat Junk Become Junk,"" Six by Seven bristle with an
    intensity that would have been unthinkable on their previous LP.  ""Sawn Off Metallica T-shirt""
    mines a cutthroat fearlessness, the chainsaw guitars and thumping bassline threatening to erupt
    at any moment.  Even when the lyrics disappear altogether or become indecipherable under the
    layers of noise, as on ""Another Love Song,"" the band exudes an unmistakable menace.</p><p>
    
    This newfound attitude doesn't always serve them well, though.  The melodic aspirations of
    ""Don't Wanna Stop"" and ""Slab Square"" are swept away in a tuneless, guitar maelstrom--
    surprising when considering they're two of only four tracks on <i>The Closer We Get</i>
    produced by the untouchable John Leckie.  Strangely, other tracks simply fail to reach their
    potential for <i>lack</i> of production.  Relying on light guitar plucking and a touch of
    feedback, ""England and a Broken Radio"" is so slight it leaves you wishing Six by Seven had
    parked their social commentary at the door.</p><p>
    
    All told, <i>The Closer You Get</i>, winds up with more bluster than substance.  These guys
    have the roar, now they just need to temper the assault and give the melodies some breathing
    room.  Too often they allow the noise to compensate for underdeveloped material.  However,
    given their rapid progress and attitude change, this misstep is both understandable and
    forgivable.  For the time being, their remarkable stylistic transition is enough for us to
    keep listening.</p></div>"|7195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7195-the-closer-you-get/|7.2|Beatty & Garrett

    music has been mired in a serious creative stasis. True, she's endured some
    personal tragedies along the way-- namely, the untimely death of both her
    husband and brother. But the real tragedy, I'd say, is her growing inability
    to write a decent song.  Hobnobbing with hip celebs at trendy Manhattan
    bistros may indeed be a hard-won privilege she deserves.  But regular
    indulgence in the archetypal fruits of success also brings to mind an age-old
    Faustian trade-off: she'll be financially stable, globally worshipped, and
    able to enjoy all the perks acclaimed rock legends are showered with, but
    she'll never again be visited by the same demons responsible for inspiring
    her best work.</p><p>
    
    By best work, I mean, of course, 1975's <i>Horses</i>, and songs like ""Pissing
    in the River,"" from <i>Radio Ethiopia</i>, and ""Rock n' Roll Nigger,"" off 1978's
    brilliant <i>Easter</i>.  This exemplary stuff was obviously fueled by true
    starving-artist anger, and borne out of a life ""outside of society,"" as she
    once sang about. Yep, she regressed from being the 20th Century female answer
    to Baudelaire to a pretentious, incoherent Ginsbergian babbler.  Instead of
    lines like, ""Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine,"" and ""Baby was a
    black sheep/ Baby was a whore,"" we're now offered such lackluster toss-offs
    as, ""In the garden of consciousness/ In fertile mind there lies the dormant
    seed."" Call this a sign of ""maturity,"" if you must, but once most
    singer/songwriters begin regarding themselves as serious ""poets,"" their work
    slips into a steady decline.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Gung Ho</i>-- much like 1996's <i>Gone Again</i> and 1999's <i>Peace
    and Noise</i>-- Patti and the band aren't exactly bad, but they hardly rock
    like they did back in '77.  And, honestly, has anyone understood a word
    Patti's written since 1979?  In recent years, she's not only taken to
    schoolmarmish Catholic moralizing, but she also tends to write more songs
    overloaded with vague moon-child spiritualism and ridiculously ornate
    neo-Biblical language.</p><p>
    
    And as Patti's ideas dwindle, her faithful band follows suit with typically
    bland, unchallenging classic rock gestures.  Sure, Lenny Kaye is still
    capable of penning a clever riff here and there, but mostly, he just follows
    the notes and pockets his paycheck. Guitarist Oliver Ray, Smith's
    sometime/former love interest, half-handles some of the songwriting chores,
    but is absolutely inconsequential as a backing instrumentalist.  As expected,
    there's very little stylistic variation in these new songs-- two
    middle-of-the-road guitars, a competent bass, and lethargic drums interact
    with predictable results. At least (as with any Patti Smith album) we're
    offered the requisite Tom Verlaine guitar solo. The enigmatic former Television
    axeman never fails to satisfy during the brief space he's allotted.</p><p>
     
    And of course, Smith loves to be taken seriously as a poet, so I'll pretend
    to be Harold Bloom and deal with her so-called poetry as if I were analyzing
    the great works of the Western Canon. On ""Grateful,"" I stopped paying
    attention as soon as she employed that hackneyed ""ship in a bottle"" metaphor:
    ""Like a ship in a bottle/ Held up to the sun/ Sails ain't going nowhere.""
    Uh, is that anything like time in a bottle? A message in a bottle, maybe?</p><p>
    
    ""Upright Come"" is a condescending Jim Morrison-esque sermon to the lumpen
    rabble. See, Patti ""Moses"" Smith looks down upon you and I as entranced,
    mystified mortals desperately in need of her spiritual guidance counseling:
    ""Awake, people, arise!/ Fortune is falling like tears from the skies/ Open
    your eyes!"" Ah, blow me, Patti! How's that for a Harold Bloom impression?</p><p>
    
    ""Glitter in Their Eyes"" is Smith's bitter rant against the rampant materialism
    of twenty-something dot-commers: ""Children, children everywhere/ Selling souls
    for souvenirs.../ Our sacred stage has been disgraced/ They'll trade you up/
    Trade you down/ Your body's a commodity.""  Accusing the young 'uns of selling
    out too easily to the Man, eh? I can't say I disagree with her, but let's face
    it-- you don't hear Patti mentioning piggy capitalist exploiters like her
    longtime corporate sugar daddy, Clive Davis.</p><p>
    
    ""New Party"" is another weak, one-woman attempt at sparking a worldwide uprising:
    ""We got to get off our ass or get burned/ The world's troubles are a global
    concern."" So, what're we supposed to do, fly to Kosovo and hand out band-aids?
    But no, ol' Peacenik Patti explains that, in the end, all you really need is
    ""Love, brother."" Shit, somebody call Michael Jackson and Bob Geldof-- Patti
    wants to change the world with love! Sorely missing that long-extinguished
    flame of youth, the more she tries to seem anti-establishment, the more she
    sounds like a boring, bitchy old folkie.</p><p>
    
    True, Smith can still be a great live performer. Unfortunately, though, she's
    begun to lose relevance as an original counter-cultural voice in the vanguard
    of American rock.  I mean, there's a reason audience members scream out requests
    for ""Piss Factory"" instead of hollering, ""Just play something from <i>Gung
    Ho</i>!""  Creatively, Smith's not doing much more than keeping up appearances
    and proving she still has a pulse.  Yes, she has yet to become a blatant nostalgia
    act like the Who or the Sex Pistols.  But still, when you listen to <i>Gung Ho</i>
    and forget about myth, legacy, mystique and all that crap, you have to wonder--
    does Patti Smith really matter anymore?</p></div>"|7275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7275-gung-ho/|4.6|Michael Sandlin

In that year, the Nigerian police persistently raided his compound, the Kalkuta     Republic, as a result of Kuti's growing public opposition to the ruling junta.  Having beaten     a narcotics charge, the Lagos police swarmed Kuti's home in an attempt to plant a big fat     joint on the premises and arrest him for possession.</p>
<p>Quick in thought as well as funk, Fela swallowed the joint.  The on-looking officers promptly     pushed him into the back of their wagon. Their immaculate plan was to wait for Kuti to dump     his morning load for proof.  They would then test the turd for THC and, according to the     cunning plan, throw Kuti in the choky for a very long time, effectively ridding the Nigerian     police of their number one gadfly.  Though raised in what might be termed a middle-class     environment, Fela Kuti was very much a people's champion, and his famous testing of authority     was what saved him in the end-- he was able to exchange his stool for a less-enhanced specimen.</p>
<p>Fela Kuti had been an attentive apprentice when he jammed with some of James Brown's band     members in a Los Angeles recording studio in 1969.  But sadly, Kuti failed to secure the     proper work Visas, and after four days, the Immigration and Nationalization Service threw     him out of the country.  Of course, Kuti had already gotten what he needed-- James Brown's     funk and some Black Panther literature. He would turn his old band into a JB's-style groove     machine, re-name it the Africa 70, and bring it on to the worms in power.</p>
<p>1975's <i>Expensive Shit</i> is paired on this new MCA reissue with <i>He Miss Road</i>,     another Kuti release from that same year.  The album's centerpiece, lead-off and title     track was undoubtedly one of the most influential tracks to the Afro-beat movement, and     to artists like the Talking Heads, who experimented with similar tribal rhythms on <i>Fear     of Music</i> and their landmark album, 1980's <i>Remain in Light</i>.  Its complex, bongo-     centric percussion is tempered with funk guitar, discordant piano, and brass eruptions.     And when, six minutes into the semi-improvisational, instrumental jam, Kuti awakens with     a yowl and begins his political rant, he changes music forever.</p>
<p>""Water No Get Enemy,"" <i>Expensive Shit</i>'s second track, is more philosophical than     political, postulating the motion of water as a metaphor for human interaction and the     rhythms of society. The music is lighter-- almost poetic-- but no less moving.  After     these two extended, 10+-minute affairs come three more, in the form of Kuti's follow-up     album, <i>He Miss Road</i>.  The title track here is a less strident affair than either     of the cuts off <i>Expensive Shit</i>.  Lyrically, Kuti comments on people's stupidity;     he mocks an incompetent lawyer for handing over his brief to the prosecution, and tells     of a band that turns up at a colony for the blind and the deaf.  After a squall of noise,     a summery, psychedelic groove settles the mood until finally giving way to an ambient     organ.</p>
<p>Fela's tenor saxophonist, Igo Chico, surpasses all his other performances on this disc     during ""Monday Morning in Lagos,"" which is up there with the Kinks' ""Waterloo Sunset""     for magical evocations of cities. Chico's glimmering lines perfectly represent the rays     of the rising sun while Kuti's Yoruban vocals add the necessary otherworldliness to the     track.</p>
<p>The disc closes as it begins-- with bombs.  On ""It's No Possible,"" drummer Tony Allen     imposes a polyrhythmic torrent that locks in the rest of the Africa 70. They have no     choice but to grab hold of the music and further jazz it up.  Fela's lyrics denouncing     those who break promises effectively counterpoint Africa 70's joyous riot of uplifting     funk. But then, that was Fela. Always contradictory-- a champion of women's rights who     kept a harem of dozens of girls (pictured on the front cover of <i>Expensive Shit</i>).     But there's no denying the guy's blatant courage in the eye of government, or the     legacy of his musical vision.</p>
<p>With DJs steadily picking up on Francois Kervorkian's championing of Fela Kuti's work,     it's all too easy to get caught up in Kuti's discography. Start with <i>Expensive Shit</i> and don't miss the road onward.</p></div>"|11769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11769-expensive-shithe-miss-road/|8.5|Paul Cooper

    never quite satisfied with the song selection. The situation is intensified
    for bands of only modest mainstream success, whose completist fans will likely
    comprise 90% of the album sales for such a compilation.  In the Posies' case,
    the label that underpromoted their albums and eventually dropped them is almost
    certainly using this release as one last excuse to screw the band over,
    distilling their major label output to one album so they can later delete the
    band's three proper titles from the catalog with little fanfare.</p><p>
    
    That said, the Posies managed to take full advantage of one more opportunity to
    look back on the 10 years they gave to their label before they ran out of steam.
    <i>Dream All Day</i> is packed to nearly the maximum running time, offering a few 
    songs from each of the band's DGC albums, and completely overlooking the indie-
    issued career bookends, <i>Failure</i> and <i>Success</i>.  The record also contains
    several non-album tracks, along with some previously unreleased and otherwise hard-
    to-find material.  The liner notes are lovingly detailed, complete with a chronology
    of the band's history and a ranting essay about how the Posies really ""mean it,"" 
    whatever that's worth.  Of course, such backpatting is to be expected of a band that
    announced their breakup, then recorded one last album, did a few final tours, and
    released a live album.  Maybe they have a bet running with Braid as to who can turn
    out the most posthumous material.  (We're still waiting on that <i>Never Has Come for
    Us: Best of Braid 1993-1999</i> three-disc anthology, guys.)</p><p>
    
    The collection kicks off, as did 1990's <i>Dear 23</i>, with ""My Big Mouth,"" a snappy,
    smartass tune that comes and goes long enough to trap its hook in your head without
    coming close to wearing out its welcome. But while that album seems to be the 
    preference of most critics and fans, its other tracks simply don't live up to the
    insistence and quick payoff of the opening track.  Recorded by legendary British 
    hitmaker John Leckie, <i>Dear 23</i> sported that confused, muddled sound that
    permeated most early '90s rock before grunge hit big and gave producers an easy sound
    to latch onto.  The hooks were there, but the acoustic-and-electric guitar strumming 
    and glossy harmonies make it relatively toothless compared to the Posies later work.
    If only Leckie could have done for the Posies' second album what he did for Radiohead's.</p><p>
    
    By the time 1993's <i>Frosting on the Beater</i> came around, the aforementioned grunge
    thing, compounded with their vicinity to Seattle, had become an unavoidable direction.
    But instead of tossing out their pop smarts for more attitude, they settled for writing
    better songs and letting Gumball's Don Fleming add the necessary heaviness to the 
    production. The result was a modest hit in this collection's title track, ""Dream All
    Day."" On ""Solar Sister,"" Jon Auer unleashes one of the most jawdropping guitar solos 
    of the period, perfectly locking in with the dynamic drums and bringing the song's 
    already catchy melody to unexpected heights.</p><p>
    
    After a detour into ""Going, Going, Gone,"" a fine contribution to the otherwise mediocre
    <i>Reality Bites</i> soundtrack, the compilation proceeds to short change the album 
    that got the Posies dropped from DGC, 1996's <i>Amazing Disgrace</i>. The press for the 
    record stubbornly insisted that it was the loud, raw work of a band fresh off their
    tour bus. The meager selections here follow suit, offering the crunching but still
    hummable singles ""Please Return It"" and ""Ontario,"" as well as the band's absolute low-
    point, the wanton angst of ""Everybody is a Fucking Liar.""</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the whole of <i>Amazing Disgrace</i> is by far the most varied and interesting
    Posies album. The fanboy in me weeps for the grand ""Song #1,"" the supremely rocking ""Grant
    Hart,"" and the small, eloquent ""The Certainty."" At least <i>Dream All Day</i> does include
    ""Throwaway,"" one of the strongest tunes in the Posies catalog, despite the song's
    uncharacteristically tuneless introductory guitar solo.  Also salvaged is the outtake ""Sad
    to be Aware,"" which sounds way too good to have been left off <i>Disgrace</i> in favor of 
    filler like ""Broken Record.""</p><p>
    
    If <i>Dream All Day</i> indicates anything, it's that the Posies probably deserve a little
    better than the footnote status they've been granted in retrospect of their 10 years as an
    entity. While the elements that comprised their sound were not so unique in and of themselves,
    it's hard to think of many other bands of the past decade who combined smart, subtle lyrics
    with traditional pop/rock dynamics and pitch-perfect male harmonies.  That's gotta count
    for something, eh?</p></div>"|6426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6426-dream-all-day-the-best-of/|7.4|Al Shipley

    gleeful opener, sent one key question coursing through my headphones and into my mind:
    ""Why isn't Robert Schneider's name all over this record?""  Amazing though it may be,
    the answer is simple: he's not involved.  Turning the collage-ridden artwork over in
    my hands, I see no ""Robert"" or ""Schneider"" listed in the credits.  I see butterflies,
    but no elephants.  And the only ""6"" I can find is in Sub Pop's P.O. Box number.</p><p>
    
    Even as I write this, I question my own literacy and sanity.  ""Desert Skies"" sounds too
    shamelessly wrangled from Elephant 6's ""too country-ish"" outtake pile for it to not be
    related.  I'm actually surprised the album isn't credited to a band called the Apples in
    Rodeo. Maybe it's the pastoral and escapist lyrics that caulk the deal most solidly:
    ""Desert skies kept me dry from the city rain/ The stars poked holes in the sky.""  I mean,
    was I or was I not ragging on Great Lakes for similar lyrics about three months ago?  But
    derivative and ultra-twee as this song may be, I just can't bring myself to dislike it.
    Like ""Seems So"" did for the Apples' <i>Tone Soul Evolution</i> way back in '97, ""Desert
    Skies"" hooks you solidly into the Sparks' comfortably non-insurgent and spaghetti-free
    western atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    In typical fashion for this pedigree of pop music, the Beachwood Sparks lean inexplicably
    hard on some of psychedelia's uglier crutches.  Both ""Ballad of Never Rider"" and ""Singing
    Butterfly"" plug songwriting gaps early on in the record, and each spends about two minutes
    on half an idea.  In attempts at texture or creativity, the band employs backwards loops
    and gurgling synths on these tracks.  But these sounds only serve to place the Beachwood
    Sparks on some far-westward leg of another band's mysterious and magical tour.  And fear
    not; the ""ba-ba-ba"" quotient is filled handily on ""This is What It Feels Like,"" a Beach
    Boys throwaway that the Wilsons would have been wise enough to actually throw away.</p><p>
    
    ""Sister Rose,"" however, finds the Sparks getting back to the business they're best at.  Its
    Hammond organ and simple, punchy guitar combines with a lonesome, travel-weary lyric. Tasteful
    slide guitars even fuse Sloan with Marty Robbins for a manic pop moment or two.  Later, the
    album slows to a mosey through ""New County,"" a tired, hopeful ballad that might have seduced
    us through the middle of Beck's <i>Mutations</i> (an artist they've fittingly opened for).</p><p>
    
    It's just that pace that protects the Beachwood Sparks' credibility.  Whereas E6-ers have
    notoriously flogged the cheap irony of embedding downtrodden lyricism into upbeat pop tunes,
    these guys get down more emotionally than musically, and manage to mean it.  Lines like, ""Deep
    down inside, I thought I'd find/ Something more than the same canyon ride,"" strike chords of
    withering honesty when a patient tempo allows that twang of high-E to burrow into this
    bleached skull of a song.</p><p>
    
    Sub Pop and the media alike have admitted to the derivative nature of the Beachwood Sparks'
    output without shame; comparisons as far-flung and high-falutin' as Gram Parsons and Buffalo
    Springfield do hold water.  Nicer, though, is the fact that if current pop music is a race
    through a desert, the Beachwood Sparks are beating a certain collective of elephants to the
    shimmery oasis ahead.</p></div>"|600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/600-beachwood-sparks/|7.1|Judson Picco

The old anarchist
    revolutionary was actually taking a stand against behavioral fascism, but modern pop music has
    misinterpreted her in the best possible way. These days, the smart sonic insurgents employ the
    old bait-and-switch on their audiences, kicking out a booming beat to capture ears and rears
    alike before dropping the science on them. But this is hardly necessary when the message is
    melded with the music as eloquently and seamlessly as Asian Dub Foundation does it; in their
    collective hands, the protest song is not only alive and well, but thriving and evolving.</p><p>
    
    As much musically innovative as they are politically active, Asian Dub Foundation's sound is
    a melting pot of jungly breakbeats, dub and dancehall flavors, and snaky guitar lines that
    morph from rock riffs into Indian sitars and back again, every element of which manages to
    stand out in the mix as often as it complements the others. <i>Rafi's Revenge</i>, the only
    other album of theirs readily available in the U.S., may have featured slightly better
    songwriting, but its thin, sterile drum-n-bass-style production detracted from its impact.
    In contrast, <i>Community Music</i> fills the empty spaces with exotic atmospherics that tickle
    the ear while the thicker, beefed-up production firmly plants a boot in it.</p><p>
    
    I remember reading a review of Primal Scream's <i>Exterminator</i> that praised the band's
    newfound political anger and snarkily nicknamed the album ""The Battle of London."" This is
    complete and utter bullshit. Compared to <i>Community Music</i>, <i>Exterminator</i> is a
    slick, empty style exercise, reducing powerful rhetoric to incoherent sound bytes that mostly
    serve as accouterments to Kevin Shields' fancy-schmancy noisemaking. The real British analog
    to Rage Against the Machine is undeniably Asian Dub Foundation, but that's still being unfair
    to both groups. Rage's blustery, in-your-face punk anger is uniquely American-- as much a
    hindrance as an asset; Asian Dub Foundation's sublimation of their discontent beneath their
    interest in getting people moving on the dance floor is, well... pretty British.</p><p>
    
    Where Zack de
    la Rocha hisses and screams, Deedar sports a mush-mouthed dancehall phrasing that sounds at once
    laid-back and urgent; Chandrasonic is as adept a guitar technician as Tom Morello, deploying
    riffs that sear and snake or disappearing into clouds of delay noise. And instead of bleak
    teeth-gnashing and finger-pointing at The Man, Asian Dub Foundation sport a particularly
    positivist, unity-building vibe that in the hands of lesser artists would become peace-and-love 
    sappiness or multicultural-studies didacticism, but the band makes sure to keep the edges rough
    while still making protest seem like celebration.</p><p>
    
    If <i>Community Music</i> is flawed in any way, it's that at 70+ minutes, it can be an
    exhausting listen. Asian Dub Foundation jump out of the gate with a furious triple dis of Cool
    Britannia nostalgia (""Real Great Britain""), historical revisionism (""Memory War""), and police
    corruption (""Officer XX"") before settling down into more uplifting grooves, praising their
    immigrant ancestors on ""New Way New Life"" and urging listeners to get into the ""Collective
    Mode.""</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the energy level begins to sag just as your pulse rate rises; ""Crash"" and ""The
    Judgement"" lean a bit too heavily on mellow reggae styles, and Deedar cedes vocal duties to
    spoken-word samples and other singers with varying success. While A. Sivanandan's speechifying 
    on ""The Colour Line"" gets a bit heavy-handed, ""Taa Deem"" succeeds brilliantly on the strength 
    of the sampled vocals of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan meshing with fierce, metallic guitar
    distortion and impossibly booming percussion. ""Truth Hides"" slinks along for a while on the
    strength of squeaky alien ambience and an enchantingly dark chorus, but it can't quite justify
    its eight-minute length.</p><p>
    
    For all its rough spots, though, Asian Dub Foundation maintains the delicate balance between 
    raising consciousness and shaking booty; the message never gets preachy, and the music can
    certainly stand well on its own, as it does on the instrumental coda ""Scaling New Heights.""
    <i>Community Music</i> is incredibly ambitious, and amazingly, it delivers everything it
    promises and then some. It's a revolution, <i>and</i> you can dance to it.</p></div>"|321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/321-community-music/|8.7|Nick Mirov

The     sonic hybrid on both records made for an engaging listen, focusing attention on the chunks     of melody that staggered from the wreckage. While I found both albums stunning in their     execution, rock fans turned off by more abrasive music were left scratching their heads and     plugging their ears. Admirers of more traditional structures will be glad to know that the     second Califone EP finds the focus returning to Tim Rutili's powerful songwriting, a move     that's also certain to please admirers of the band.</p>
<p>Remnants of the older records' exotic production remain on this brief five-song record. The     opening ""Electric Fence"" features booming, heavily manipulated drums in addition to a bagful     of indiscernible sound fragments bouncing dub-style off the studio walls. But these flourishes     are backgrounded often enough to reveal what is arguably the most beautiful song Rutili has     written.  The song's wistfully sad melody, tragic, descending piano line and impressionistic     word fragments (""lit a blue tip match off the white of your eye"") turn profound when considered     as a whole.</p>
<p>The next three songs feature more subdued studio work. ""St. Martha Let It Fold"" has an eerie     melody that draws heavily from rural depression-era music. ""Beneath the Yachtsman"" starts with     clattering Meat-style beats before morphing into a nugget of exhausted soul music, complete     with quivering gospel piano. And the guitar-and-voice-only ""Don't Let Me Die Nervous"" is a     song halfway between Appalachian folk and Bob Dylan's ""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding,""      with an intensity to match.</p>
<p>The closer, ""Dock Boggs,"" is named after an artist featured prominently on the <i>Anthology of      American Folk Music</i> box set, and it serves as a kind of restatement of thesis. Combining     a melody adapted from one of Boggs' songs with rattling percussion and buzzing electronics,     ""Boggs"" again captures that out-of-time feel where studio technology smashes up against classic     American songwriting. Califone have a knack for artfully blending these disparate worlds.</p></div>"|1241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1241-califone-ep-1999/|8.3|Mark Richard-San

    Passamonte), depicts a silver-eyed alien standing in a deserted forest, occupied only by
    trees, a white moon, and the alien himself.  The jewel case's back insert depicts a small girl
    standing alone on a beach, surrounded only by sand, sky, and water. They're fitting images for
    the record-- <i>One on One</i> is an album of alienation, desolation, emptiness, and uneasiness.</p><p>
    
    Listening to <i>One on One</i> is like standing alone on an ever-mutating alien landscape.
    Indecipherable noises echo in the distance, subtlety modulating and shifting into other sounds.
    These hardly noticeable changes, which permeate every track, create a nauseating undertone,
    making the record a truly unsettling listen.  It's heightened by the fact that many of the
    <i>One on One</i>'s sounds don't seem ""right."" The dense rhythm on ""Sparrow"" never fully
    settles into a steady beat. The melody on ""Schmyk"" begins as a simple, minimalistic tune in 
    a minor key.  Then another melody, slightly out of tune with the original, enters the mix,
    establishing its own complimenting tune.  But before the track gets stagnant, the second 
    melody frantically shifts its tonal center, leading to some of the most fucked up harmonies
    this side of a bear quartet.  These unexpected changes leave the listener lost.  But never
    bored.</p><p>
    
    Another contributing factor to the album's otherworldly tone is Passamonte's extra-terrestrial
    vocals. On ""Ms. Meteo,"" Passamonte sounds like Patti Smith filtered through a vocoder.  She
    sprinkles barely coherent whispers throughout <i>One on One</i>, most of which wind up buried
    at the very back of the mix. But the farther Passamonte's voice drifts into the background,
    the more intently you find yourself listening, trying to decipher her cryptic murmurs.</p><p>
<i>One on One</i> has led me to two conclusions:  1) Chantal Passamonte is fucked up.  2)
    Music can be nauseating in a good way.  And while the album may be a bit abrasive at times,
    it's abundantly clear that Passamonte intended it to be that way-- it's not pretty, and that's
    what makes it good.</p></div>"|1247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1247-one-on-one/|8.4|Matt LeMay

    live shows, and I namedropped a few that I knew they'd recognize to bring
    them into my world of general agreement.  Then, to finally win them over, I
    said, ""I've heard that the Mates of State are great live.""  Bam! I'd dropped
    a big one on them: an obscure, somewhat local band they'd never heard of,
    that they were sure to love, and that they would be able to thank me for
    after hearing them.  Smooth move.  ""Really? Do they play around here? What
    are they like?"" The obligatory follow-up questions.  My response: ""Well,
    they're a two-person line-up... organ and drums, a girl and a boy...""</p><p>
    
    And just as quickly as I'd won them over, they turned against me. ""That sounds
    like Quasi. Quasi rip-offs!"" I pleaded with them to hear my side: ""No, not at
    all, really! They're nothing like each other!"" But to no avail. They walked
    away laughing, leaving the phrase, ""They can't be as good as Quasi!"" echoing
    repeatedly in my ears. I was hurt. Permanently scarred. Traumatized.</p><p>
    
    So I'd like to think of this as my therapy review. Sure, the Mates of State
    have a similar line-up to Quasi.  And yeah, they make irresistible pop music,
    too. But that's it! The similarities end there!  So now that you've read this
    far, why not continue, even if it's only out of pity?  The healing can now
    begin.</p><p>
    
    Mates of State are a pop duo based in San Francisco. They are half-male and
    half-female.  Their halves are named Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel.  And as
    luck would have it, they are, shall we say, romantically entangled. Gardner
    rhapsodizes vocally (as well as through her Yamaha organ) while Hammel
    simultaneously shares vocal duties and masterfully handles the many tempo
    changes on his drumsticks.  Meanwhile, the mood of the record, whether it be
    bittersweet or rapturous, is solely melodically based, with carefree and
    nonsensical lyrics accompanying.</p><p>
    
    The Mates of State's debut album, <i>My Solo Project</i>, has two key elements.
    The first is the gleeful, sincere enthusiasm. There's more of it here, in true
    and genuine form, than could be located on any co-ed high school cheerleading
    squad. The duo's vocals explode harmonizing into the air, and though these two
    aren't the best singers in the world, they want to sing and they're gonna sing,
    damnit!  The most sincere moment here comes with ""Everyone Needs an Editor,""
    when they each trade off singing the lines, ""I color the sky with you/ I let
    you choose the blue."" You can hear their eyes meet in a gaze of gory love.
    At times, Gardner and Hammel almost seem like they're trying to surpass each
    other and miss the note, and these moments stand out-- a few even border on
    cringe-worthy.  But when the awkwardness passes, we forgive the smitten couple
    anyway because they're so damn cute.</p><p>
    
    The second key element is the song structure. Each song has multiple parts,
    and they're each virtually always in a different key, with a different hook,
    in a different tempo.  These hooks could easily have stood on their own, but
    that didn't satisfy these Mates.  Instead, they chose to pack each song with
    the punch of two or three, playing with your expectations.  On ""What I Could
    Stand For,"" they sing the lovely refrain of ""And I won't pass you by"" the
    traditional four times, until the music comes to a dead halt and briefly
    pauses before they reiterate for emphasis and move on to the third part of
    the song.</p><p>
    
    This 12-track album basically only has 10 songs. The first and last
    are total throwaways. Thankfully, they're at the beginning and end, and
    don't disturb the flow.  But it makes one wonder why they're included. The
    first track is a 50 second cover of... the ""Cheers"" theme song, sung by a
    relative of Gardner's on a boombox when she was in her early teens. Badly,
    I might add.  It's the same basic deal with the closer; trust me, you don't
    need to hear about it.  But aside from these easily avoided blunders, <i>My
    Solo Project</i> manages to remain consistently high in quality within its
    tight 34-minute length. It's unique, fun, and worth your time. And it
    certainly sounds nothing like Qu--</p></div>"|5147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5147-my-solo-project/|7.6|Spencer Owen

But, like it
    or not, there are a few things that will never, ever receive over an 8.5, barring an act of
    government or God. These include, but are not limited to:</p><p>
    1. Promise Ring side projects<br/>
    2. Nazi electronica<br/>
    3. ""Comeback"" albums by washed-up '70s rockers<br/>
    4. New Elephant 6 groups dedicated to the sounds of dying rodents<br/>
    5. Disco revivalism<br/>
    6. Overproduced three-or-four-chord punk records</p><p>
    If you so much as snickered at #6, you can probably imagine what <i>Come Clean</i> sounds like:
    trite, overused guitar progressions, incompetent pentatonic solos, and seriously fucked-up
    lyrics. Over the course of <i>Come Clean</i>'s 21 minutes, you'll hear tales of 14-year-olds
    who complain about not getting fucked properly, rape, and-- everyone's favorite-- tits! Maybe
    when the Dwarves started out in the mid-'80s, this was unique and shocking. But at this point,
    it really doesn't have all that much impact. It's all been said before. Shit, the Dwarves
    themselves have been saying it for over 10 years, and even they've said it better.</p><p>
    If you strip away all the gimmick from the Dwarves, you're pretty much left with an average
    punk/pop band. <i>Come Clean</i> uses the same old chord progressions you've heard on every
    other punk/pop album. Come to think of it, the Dwarves' subject matter might be the one thing
    that's been keeping them from having any kind of mainstream success. If they were singing about
    being 20 instead of fucking 14-year-olds, they could hit it big! Then again, they probably
    haven't been 20 for at least 60 years. But thrashy, poppy tunes like ""How It's Done"" and
    ""Better be Women"" sound like they could have been written by Rancid, or another of today's
    generic Clash-worshipping punk-pop bands.</p><p>
    While this stuff is immensely unoriginal, it somehow rarely reaches the point at which it
    becomes painful to listen to.  When it does, of course, it ain't pretty. Take ""Deadly Eye,""
    an insufferable, Kid Rock-ish Dwarves theme song, or ""Act Like You Know,"" a disjointed blast
    of fuzz that will leave you craving the kind-hearted fun of ""I Want You to Die.""</p><p>
    So right now you're probably wondering, ""If it's so bad, why give it a 6.0?"" Well, there are
    two reasons for that. First of all, interesting sounds do occasionally pop up amidst the 
    otherwise trite instrumentation. A lot of the tracks on <i>Come Clean</i> contain a few welcome
    seconds of synthesizer noises, and ""Way Out"" features a pretty cool vocoder introduction. (Hey,
    I didn't say it was original.) But these are just minor details.</p><p>
    When taken on the merits of
    its music alone, <i>Come Clean</i> barely warrants a 4.  The one thing that really pulls the
    album out from the depths of complete mediocrity is the fact that, unlike a lot of today's more
    popular acts, the Dwarves fully embrace the role of fucked-up punk rockers. Whereas watered-down
    punk/pop groups like Blink 182 appear ""nude"" on MTV with their genitals conveniently blurred,
    the Dwarves have no reservations about whipping out their dicks. Every aspect of <i>Come Clean</i>
    seems designed for the sole purpose of pissing off your parents. And in the end, isn't that what
    punk rock is all about?</p></div>"|2496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2496-come-clean/|6.0|Matt LeMay

The collection of singles includes live and recorded work garnered from b-sides     and compilation tracks, as well as unreleased material.  In other words, this is not Oldham's     <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>. In fact, it's more akin to ""The Collected Letters of Emily Dickinson;""     fragments, which are valuable primarily in their relation to other work. Together, these pieces     grant a bit more access into the open wound of Oldham's dark but sober poetic vision.</p>
<p><i>Lost Blues 2</i> recalls Roland Barthes' account of sorting through piles of family     photographs in his seminal text, ""Camera Lucida."" His search for a photograph that marked the     essence of photography became conflated with a search for his dead mother, as he discovered     ""that rather terrible thing which is there in every photograph: the return of the dead.""     Barthes did find the photograph that invoked both his dead mother's presence and the defining     essence of photography.  He refers to this image as ""the wintergarden photograph.""</p>
<p>The remnants of <i>Lost Blues</i> to sort through are diverse in quality and style as they     span the course of seven years. ""The Risen Lord,"" a D.H. Lawrence poem sung over a weak drum     machine beat and synthy organs doesn't produce the creepy tension you'd expect Oldham to pull     off in such an unlikely juxtaposition.  Live recordings of ""For the Mekons et al,"" and ""Stable     Will"" are uneven recordings, but show off some of Oldham's least restrained singing. ""Gesundheit""     starts off relaying, ""I dreamed I saw Phil Ochs last night/ Alive as you or me,"" before heading     into a tape collage that ranges between a religious children's tape and a soundscape reminiscent     of Angelo Badalamenti's ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack.</p>
<p><i>Lost Blues 2</i> isn't greater than the sum of its parts. It inspired thoughts of Emily     Dickinson and French photographic wounds-- how rock is that? Those uninitiated into the Oldham/     Palace canon would be better off picking up a copy of the Palace Brothers' <i>Viva Last Blues</i> or Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's <i>I See a Darkness</i>. If you get dragged in deeper, spend your     money on <i>Joya</i>, Oldham's high-strung and sublime ode to terror. But for others of you--     and you know who you are-- <i>Lost Blues 2</i> is an irresistible bundle of odd and ends which     has the potential to contain that note or phrase which unsettles.  Or rather, it's just another     record in which you might find your wintergarden photograph.</p></div>"|11792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11792-guaraperolost-blues-2/|6.8|Kristin Sage Rockermann

His search for a photograph that marked the     essence of photography became conflated with a search for his dead mother, as he discovered     ""that rather terrible thing which is there in every photograph: the return of the dead.""     Barthes did find the photograph that invoked both his dead mother's presence and the defining     essence of photography.  He refers to this image as ""the wintergarden photograph.""</p>
<p>The remnants of <i>Lost Blues</i> to sort through are diverse in quality and style as they     span the course of seven years. ""The Risen Lord,"" a D.H. Lawrence poem sung over a weak drum     machine beat and synthy organs doesn't produce the creepy tension you'd expect Oldham to pull     off in such an unlikely juxtaposition.  Live recordings of ""For the Mekons et al,"" and ""Stable     Will"" are uneven recordings, but show off some of Oldham's least restrained singing. ""Gesundheit""     starts off relaying, ""I dreamed I saw Phil Ochs last night/ Alive as you or me,"" before heading     into a tape collage that ranges between a religious children's tape and a soundscape reminiscent     of Angelo Badalamenti's ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack.</p>
<p><i>Lost Blues 2</i> isn't greater than the sum of its parts. It inspired thoughts of Emily     Dickinson and French photographic wounds-- how rock is that? Those uninitiated into the Oldham/     Palace canon would be better off picking up a copy of the Palace Brothers' <i>Viva Last Blues</i> or Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's <i>I See a Darkness</i>. If you get dragged in deeper, spend your     money on <i>Joya</i>, Oldham's high-strung and sublime ode to terror. But for others of you--     and you know who you are-- <i>Lost Blues 2</i> is an irresistible bundle of odd and ends which     has the potential to contain that note or phrase which unsettles.  Or rather, it's just another     record in which you might find your wintergarden photograph.</p></div>"|11792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11792-guaraperolost-blues-2/|6.8|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    huge ramshackle constructions, piled on the buildings of years past?  Well,
    the reason that hasn't happened is that the ""new"" world would rather throw
    out the ""old"" unless they're too poor not to use it.  Really the only old
    shit you see around now is preserved up all untouchable, museum-style.
    Practical application of existing structures just isn't viable in this modern
    urban landscape of ours.</p><p>
    Look at the cover of Mike Ladd's <i>Welcome to the Afterfuture</i>.  It's an
    awful electrical mess, superimposed onto old building walls.  Ladd's music
    reflects the artwork with chunky, pharmaceutical beats that sneak past dim
    strings.  It's nasty New Orleans bounce with lyrics about listening to bootlegs
    of the Fall.  And even though it looks kinda like a Marlboro ad, it's still a
    dope cover.</p><p>
    The record starts with ""5000 Miles West of the Future,"" violently switching up
    from an analog keyboard assault to a sweeping ambient flow and back again, all
    while jazzy horn progressions seep through the background and make like Sun
    Ra handwriting.  Ladd's rhymes on <i>Afterfuture</i> are at their most
    conversational, especially in breaks where he casually explains, ""I'm gonna
    steal from the foreign merchant.../ For the cinnamon peeler's wife.../ Like
    I was bedding down with Isis.""</p><p>
    As the buzzing keyboard stabs fade out,
    ""Airwave Hysteria"" begins, and the rest is swapped for rising strings and
    faux-Hindu chants, drifting yet again into some funky, bugged-out Casio shit
    over which Ladd first hits his lyrical stride, MCing with self-assured flow
    and coming with dense rhyme content to match (""Breakbeats from Thailand down
    over by the Ku Klux Klan chapter in Croatia/ We've come a long way from
    migrating crustaceans/ Generations of relations, history of violence/ I
    talked along in Babylon, next time I'll try silence"").  Unlike many
    poet-turned-MCs, Ladd manages to go off like a motherfucker, and it all ends
    with a classic scratch breakdown, cut open with more of those damned trilling
    strings of his.</p><p>
    ""Planet 10"" breaks from these jams to bust on the simple beauty of a simple
    song, an intricate nautilus of synth tones and deep-space vocals stretching
    over junkyard ambience to some kind of nappy-haired slow-grind trajectory.
    Fuck neo-soul, this is post-soul, only somehow better than something called
    that should ever be.</p><p>
    Nothing else here really touches these first three tracks, but the rest comes
    close-- the lilting rush of the mostly instrumental ""Takes More than 41,"" and
    the slow-to-start ""To the Moon's Contractor,"" a song more summery than its
    interstellar title might lead you to believe.  ""I Feel Like $100"" sounds like
    Warp Records unfavorites Red Snapper with actual forward drive and rhythmic
    interest, even with its dodgy ""Strawberry Fields"" reference.</p><p>
    Amazingly, Ladd goes for delf on every cut except the Company Flow-assisted
    ""Bladeruners,"" a violent fucking storm of next-level racial and sexual
    articulation, wide string samples criss-crossing like frozen rivers, and a
    plodding organic bassline. It's perhaps the closest to rap traditionalism
    the album ever flirts with-- something for BET to sneak in on that lazy
    Thursday afternoon to give you a <i>Videodrome</i>-style brain tumor.</p><p>
    ""It's all confused and beautiful"" are the lines Ladd chooses to open ""Feb.
    4 '99 (For All Those Killed by Cops),"" and it's exactly that.  Besides Ladd's
    waxen imagery of childhood memories, the lyrics are mostly befuddling and his
    delivery is unconvincingly wide-eyed enough to fuel a thousand Bj√∂rk videos.
    I know good and well that Ladd's trying to make this closing track a ""Strange
    Fruit"" for a future of money, women and computers, and I'll be damned if he
    doesn't actually come shockingly close.  It's a stunning end to the album.</p><p>
    For all the obvious influences (""Starship Nigga"" is pretty much just Bj√∂rk's
    ""Pluto"" instilled with spaced-out black rage), the album still manages to
    sound pleasantly <em>new</em>, taking all the bits from the past that demand to
    be resurrected, and recontextualizing them into Ladd's own brainspace.  Of
    course, this sort of thing has been done before, but I can't think of anything
    that's ever sounded as genuinely beautiful at the same time.  It's all the
    wires from the liner notes covering children while they spread Christ-like
    onto antique brownstones.  It's the genius of Ezra Pound and Greg Nice over
    tinny, rolling drums, and the awkwardness of my first paragraph over beautiful
    dimethicone symphonies.  It's Mike Ladd assembling his personal afterfuture
    over the ramshackle remains of a distant past.  Fresh!</p></div>"|4621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4621-welcome-to-the-afterfuture/|8.6|Ethan P.

Airbrushings of buxom valkyries
    heaving halberds take up no space at MOMA. ""Beastmaster"" failed to garner Mark Singer a single
    Oscar nod. Wilt Chamberlain's tomahawk dunks come to most people's mind before his role as
    Bombata in ""Conan the Destroyer."" A simple method for avoiding small talk with the businessman
    squeezed into the seat next to you on flights is to hunch over a 900-page fantasy epic. Answer
    his inquisitions with, ""Excuse me, but I'm reading 'Path of Daggers,' the eighth volume of
    Robert Jordan's <i>Wheel of Time</i> series."" It works like garlic breath.</p><p>
    While we may occasionally enjoy an escape into Arrakis or Ringworld, they're hardly worlds worth
    living in. The Renaissance Faire is only open one week a year for a reason.  Likewise, listening to
    Mary Timony's twelve-sided die and aromatic candle companion piece, <i>Mountains</i>, is like
    eating every meal at Medieval Times.</p><p>
    Timony weaves a sparse tapestry of piano, chiming electric guitar, bells, and gong-like
    percussion into castle-pop as two-dimensional as a Holy Roman triptych. Imagine a Gaul Liz
    Phair strumming in the 14th Century, exiled in ye olde Village of Guy.  Musically,
    <i>Mountains</i> is an often dreamy departure. Timony's work with Polvo frontman Ash Bowie
    in Helium has evidently rubbed off.
    </p><p>
    With the magical wand of whammy attached to her guitar,
    she bends clean chords into melting diffractions, sounding much like Polvo's Eastern-influenced
    discursions from <i>Exploded Drawing</i> and <i>Shapes</i> on tasty songs like ""The Bell,""
    ""Painted Horses,"" and ""Valley of One Thousand Perfumes."" It's a sound that's been missed since
    Polvo's demise.  ""Poison Moon"" and ""The Golden Fruit"" pulse with tinny knocks of an echoing
    drum machine. It throbs with an anxiety-building pace, as if to say, ""Blue Wizard, your
    lifeforce is running out!""  Vibraphone and gooey analog organs drip from snapping drums and
    repetitious guitar plucking on the two-minute instrumental, ""An-deluzion."" Those're your
    highlights.
    </p><p>
    When Timony attempts ""period"" sounds with maudlin violin, chimes, lute, harpsichord, or whatever
    modern equivalent, the album falls into what I like to call the ""laughable parts."" The delicate
    pipes of pan make their inevitable appearance on ""Tiger Rising."" Timony never once looks up from
    her fantasy epic, constantly dancing around her maypole with ribbons of black and olive.
    </p><p>
    Yet it's the lyrics and vocal delivery that go down like 700-year-old salted ham. ""Will you
    dance with me?/ The kind of dance in the iron shoes/ Into the dungeon,"" she begs on ""Dungeon
    Dance."" Sorry, I've... uh... got some... uh... jousting to do. The songwriting veres dangerously
    close to the intro Spinal Tap's ""Stonehenge."" ""I walk through an everlasting pit/ By the
    mountain of fire and the fountain of spit,"" is better growled over some good old Norwegian
    death metal. Over plonking piano and handclaps, it just tickles. The lazy, forced vocals waver
    in similar fashion to those church hymns where it's evident they focused on writing the praising
    the Lord parts before the melody. Hearing a roomful of tongues trip over ""give us our tresspasses""
    is enough to keep one home on Sunday. (Please excuse my narrow-minded allusions to Christian
    doctrine.  Judeocentric readers should picture a temple full of weekend believers bellowing
    ""Baruch atah Adonai."")
    </p><p>
    Still, if audacity counts, there's a strange allure to <i>Mountains</i>. It's certainly not the
    same tribute John Denver gave. Music should offer escapism in some form. But travelling to
    Timony's world is not a real trip. The voyage is more akin to a zoo. We watch for a few passing
    moments in our rush to the reptile house. We point and mock as our feelings shift from awe to
    pity to blithe. There, beyond the retaining cement moat, Mary sits strumming at the harp in
    velvet robes amongst gnarled trees filled with ravens. Mary, come back! Helium is a band, not
    an inhalant!

    star.  He does hold a venerable position in the pantheon of twee-pop, having 
    fronted the Field Mice, the late-'80s missing link between the Smiths and Belle 
    &amp; Sebastian.  But as always seems the case with these sensitive fey-pop types,
    Wratten's never quite gotten over the girl, and his music remains as resolutely
    precious now as ever.  This is both good and bad news.  For devotees to the
    softly sung, broken heart aesthetic, Wratten's mournful nuggets from the old-
    school of twee are just what the doctor ordered.  For those whom the twee phase
    has come and gone, Wratten's pleasant work merely betrays a stylistic cul-de-sac.</p><p>
    
    In either case, Wratten's mastery of the form and elder statesman status merit 
    acknowledgment.  The man can write a catchy tune, and what's more, his work 
    with the Trembling Blue Stars evinces a greater appreciation and grasp of 
    texture.  Working closely with producer Ian Catt, noteworthy for his work with 
    St. Etienne, <i>Broken by Whispers</i> shimmers and glitters, alternating from
    hushed ambience to ringing guitar and synth interplay.</p><p>
    
    Opening with lingering bird chirps and a softly picked acoustic guitar, ""Ripples""
    soon erupts into emotively detached guitar pop reminiscent of '80s balladeering.
    Wratten intones: ""I want to write songs about/ Two strangers starting out.""
    Things get pastoral on ""She Just Couldn't Stay,"" with soft percussive effects and
    strings accompanying a smart melody and a chorus that laments, ""The person you
    were/ I know you're not her.""  Curses upon the cruel woman that broke Wratten's
    sensitive soul, for confining his wretched lyrical muse.  ""Sometimes I Still Feel
    the Bruise"" is a touching slice of new wave synth-pop, and on ""To Leave It Now,""
    Wratten enlists a French chanteuse to realize his passive mixture of melancholy
    and melody.</p><p>
    
    The songs on <i>Broken by Whispers</i> are resolutely catchy, simply bogged down
    by tried-and-true heart-on-the-sleeve sentiment.  It's too late in the game to
    entertain the notion that Wratten might venture off his beaten path.  But for
    folks smitten with heartbreak, it's just as well.</p></div>"|8147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8147-broken-by-whispers/|6.4|S. Murray

Through
    meticulous study, they have completely mastered the architecture of the
    transcendent rock jam. But instead of celebrating their achievements,
    they choose to undercut their monuments to riffology in service of the
    first commandment of Dadaism: Thou Shalt Fuck With People's Heads.</p><p>
    
    Just as Kaufman's killer Elvis impression turned his hapless, unfunny
    ""foreign man"" character into a surreal comic enterprise, so does the
    Boredoms' overreaching rock power achieve extra poignancy through their
    unwillingness to leave well enough alone. The classic Boredoms song
    inches us ever closer to the brink of orgiastic musical communion,
    until Yamatsuka Eye and Co. derail the groove train at the last minute,
    sending us spinning off into a ditch in a messy tangle of open reel
    tape. We are frustrated, but as Frank Sinatra once said, ""That's life.""</p><p>
    
    The best example of this sort of monkeywrenching on <i>Vision Creation
    Newsun</i> (the follow-up to 1998's <i>Super Are</i>, which is currently
    only available as a pricy Japanese import) comes with the second track.
    The song (there are no titles here, only unpronounceable symbols) begins
    in a swell of chiming guitars and shimmering percussion, opening slowly
    like a lotus flower, and eventually takes root as a driving, circular
    psychedelic guitar workout reminiscent of Spacemen 3's ""Suicide.""</p><p>
    
    As the band moves through variation after variation on the simple theme
    and the track gains in volume and power, Eye suddenly seizes the tape
    machine and begins cutting the song to ribbons, splicing in air raid
    sirens, EQing, and phasing like a tone-deaf janitor trapped in the Radio
    One control booth.  In this instant, Eye makes an unholy pile of shit
    from a perfect specimen of guitar rock ecstasy. How could he do such a
    thing when we were feeling so good? But then, just as we're about to hit
    the Stop button in disgust, he gets the song back on the rails and shoves
    it forward with even more thrust. And as we appreciate the authority of
    the song that much more, we thank him for the moment of discord.</p><p>
    
    No music writer can resist the occasional ""x meets y"" sort of comparison,
    and the one that describes latter-day Boredoms is too unusual to pass up:
    The Ramones meets the Grateful Dead. Strange as it may sound, it could be
    the only way to describe a band that once cut a 34-minute cover of a single
    Mekons riff-- it appeared on <i>Super Roots 7</i>, a tremendous achievement
    that remains the band's trance rock pinnacle.  But if anything, this odd
    amalgamation only points out what's so great about Japan: musicians there
    don't waste time trying to figure out why the Sex Pistols are cooler than
    King Crimson, they merely combine the best elements of both.</p><p>
<i>Vision Creation Newsun</i> takes the Boredoms even further into neo-hippie
    psychedelic territory, though a few songs (like the aforementioned Track Two)
    rock more thoroughly and convincingly than any pre-punk band apart from the
    Stooges. Though there are a handful of lengthy, evolving crunchers, the
    majority of the album consists of exercises in atmosphere.  This largely
    instrumental LP leans mostly on plucked guitars, gurgling synths, and tribal
    drumming, sometimes reminiscent of folky psyche travelers Ghost. It's a
    beautiful sound-- one that gains in complexity with repeated listens-- but
    it never quite reaches the heights of <i>Super Are</i>. I guess you have to
    take what you can get with the Boredoms.</p></div>"|863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/863-vision-creation-newsun/|7.9|Mark Richard-San

    figuring out how this whole ""Internet"" thing works.  The computer commercials promise
    plug-in-and-surf, but there's always a glitch.  At work you're too embarrassed to ask the 
    young tech guys how the ""web"" works.  They'd snicker before cranking <i>The Fragile</i> back
    up and turning back to their monitors.  Never show inferiority to subordinates.  So, you
    pony-tailed Jeep-drivers and terrier-walkers, I'm crawling inside your minds like ""Reeling
    in the Years"" did so many decades ago.  I know you've held silly suspicions, if just for a
    moment, that your ponytail was perhaps pulling back your hairline.  I know that this review
    might hurt your feelings.  Here, play with this shiny silver Nokia while I chat with somebody
    else.</p><p>
    
    If you're a regular Pitchfork reader... why are you even curious about Steely Dan in 2000?!
    Only their 20 year absence gives them any press or assumed credibility.  Unlike Chicago, Rush,
    or Cheap Trick they did not slip down a steep staircase of increasingly prosaic Prozac records.
    Steely Dan dodged the 80's and they didn't make a <i>Woke Up with the Monster</i>.  One can
    imagine the hype Rush would receive in 2000 if they'd jumped 20 years from 1981's <i>Moving
    Pictures</i> straight to <i>Test for Echo</i>.  This would not make <i>Test for Echo</i> a
    desirable album.  For those worth risking it, extended absence makes for great publicity.</p><p>
    
    Some of the smoothest objects know to humankind include the buttock of a baby, the belly of an
    otter, Downy-laden terrycloth, Palmolive, and rose petals.  Add to that list <i>Two Against
    Nature</i>.  The lengthy, indistinguishable tracks could pass for a Daniel Lanois-produced
    collaboration between the Dave Matthews Band and Kenny G.  This putrid bait lures both the
    smooth jazz aficionados and the hackysackers.  ""Fusion"" is too caustic a verb, better suited for
    nuclear physics and Don Caballero.  ""Making pudding"" better describes this genre blending.</p><p>
    
    ""Jamming"" sax solos glide over neutered, bassless funk.  Glass guitar and percussion clink
    along steadily like a chorus of jangling Tag Heuers, automatic Lexus locks, popping Le Croix
    cans, clicking laptop covers, crystal Cristal toasts, and smacking Hollywood cheek-kisses.  The
    same slow-bop pace is rigorously maintained.  Vocals exhale so innocuously you have to hold a
    mirror up under the speaker to make sure it's alive.  The credits list 13 producers (!) who
    tackle tasks such as ""editing,"" ""horn arranger,"" ""consultant,"" ""project manager,"" and-- most
    tellingly-- ""copyist.""  This is less music than ""production.""  23 musicians took part in this
    album's design, four of which simply played ""snare.""  At least at the end of ""Wild Wild West""
    Will Smith destroys the giant, evil machine.</p><p>
    
    Music is more than craft and technique.  Steely Dan's seams are hidden, the instruments are
    digitally lacquered, and the edges are buffed.  20 years have passed since <i>Gaucho</i> and
    Steely Dan seem content to completely ignore them.  Amazingly, Steely Dan's name has been
    popping up as a hip musical crush.  Remember, this glossy bop-pop was the indifferent
    aristocracy to punk rock's stone-throwing in the late 70's.  People fought and died so our
    generation could listen to something better.  Okay, so they died of overdoses and car crashes.
    They still had soul.  Keep up the good fight.  Put down this sports-utility vehicle of a
    record.  As with the urban yuppie driver, the four-wheel drive is never activated.</p></div>"|7486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7486-two-against-nature/|1.6|Brent DiCrescenzo

    EP, Air haven't striven for much more than to bring a French flavor to spacy
    electronic pop.  Even back then, this was by no means an original concept.
    Hundreds of bands-- Stereolab, Dimitri from Paris, Komeda, etc.-- preceded
    Air with Bacharachian melodies and Moog hisses scattered throughout their
    albums like trademark logos.  But while their predecessors carried themselves
    on kitsch value and band-of-the-moment media praise, Air seemed somehow more
    serious about their music.</p><p>
    Is the world really interested in another Air release, though?  <i>Premiers
    Symptomes</i> and <i>Moon Safari</i>, while intriguing albums for their genre,
    were somewhat similar in mood and direction.  Both showed a band whose intent
    was to create instrumental French space-pop, and not much else.  And with the
    ""French space-pop revolution"" pretty much over and done with, what could a new
    Air record possibly offer that the duo hasn't already accomplished?</p><p>
    Well, from the sound of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>, the score to Sofia Coppola's
    directorial debut, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno\xEEt Dunckel have a bit more to
    achieve before their 15 seconds tick to a close.  Though the record does
    aim for the same kind of prog-rock atmospherics as their earlier releases, Air
    have managed to alter their sound this time out, drawing from a wider array
    of rock influences, instead of limiting their scope to Perrey and Kingsley.</p><p>
    Godin and Dunckel have a larger arsenal of instruments here.  The bulk of the
    equipment implemented still seems to be a diverse assortment of analog keyboards,
    but Air also incorporate those dependable traditional rock instruments, guitar and
    bass.  It's a marked improvement from the synth surplus of their previous material.
    The band also seems more influenced by the melodic psychedelic rock of the late 60's
    and early 70's than before.  There are distinct nods to Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of
    the Moon</i> and especially the Beatles' <i>Abbey Road</i>.  The Beatles' influence
    is most notable on ""Bathroom Girl,"" ""Cemetary Party,"" and ""Highschool Lover (Theme 
    from 'The Virgin Suicides'),"" during which several of the drum fills and guitar
    squalls sound almost directly snatched from <i>Abbey Road</i>.</p><p>
    Of course, <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> has its dry moments, but surprisingly,
    they're few and far between.  For the most part, the album showcases Godin and
    Dunckel's dramatically improved songwriting skills.  The majority of these 13
    tracks actually feature a true rarity for rock music these days-- unpredictable
    chord progressions. And the album undeniably serves its purpose: it's a film score.
    The fact that it holds your attention, despite being created solely as incidental
    music, says something about the guys playing it.  Whether we want to admit it or
    not, Air are pretty good at what they do.  Still, the backlash is well underway
    at this point, and it seems doubtful they'll hold up quite as well by the time
    their ""official"" follow-up to <i>Moon Safari</i> sees release later this year.</p></div>"|74.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/74-the-virgin-suicides/|7.2|Ryan Schreiber

    we mean within the last hour):</i> Buy this CD.  Get someone to take you to Coconuts and ask the
    cashier about Non.  In sign language, if necessary.</p><p>
<i>Review for people who can and have been able to hear:</i> We live in a city.  A big city.
    Not an especially nice part of a big city.  For us, muggings, police sirens, and the stench of
    raw sewage is part of the scenery.  As we walk to and from class, the homeless accost us, cars
    run stop signs and narrowly avoid taking us out, and students with bullhorns complain about the
    administration.  To put it mildly, we're bombarded with the bustling noise and activity of a
    city on a daily basis (the emphasis being on ""noise"").  It's never really quiet here.  But
    we've grown accustomed to it and it's not much of an issue.</p><p>
    
    But we understand that not everyone has the privilege of living in such a cacophonous
    environment.  Fortunately, Non (aka Boyd Rice) had these people in mind when he recorded
    <i>Receive the Flame</i>.  For those of you from the dust bowl states who feel that you've
    been missing out on an entire world of noise, this album puts you right in the thick of it.
    We can imagine how much someone-- say Marlee Matlin-- would enjoy Non, if her hearing was
    to be miraculously restored by faith-healers or voodoo shamans.  If you lived in a world of
    deafening silence, 35 minutes of random screeching, helicopter sounds, and the rare suppressed
    organ or violin would be a welcome change.  Not so for the rest of us.  And even if you did
    like it, that's no reason to buy <i>Receive the Flame</i>.  You could get a more-than-decent
    facsimile of the Non experience by sitting on a airport runway with a boombox blaring classical
    music with the bass turned off.</p><p>
<i>Receive the Flame</i> is experimental music, and any music fan can appreciate the spirit in
    which it was created.  But, hey, guess what?  The experiment failed!  It might have seemed like
    a good idea to create an unnecessarily dense collage of sound, but we can't imagine the end
    result spending much time in anyone's stereo.  There have been many others before Boyd Rice
    who've made incoherent noise with much more inventiveness and pizzazz, and surely many more will
    follow.  But in the unlikely event that we ever do get the yen for Non again, we'll just put
    a Dictaphone cassette of whale songs inside a refrigerator and pack our ears with cigarette
    butts.</p></div>"|5827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5827-receive-the-flame/|1.5|Beatty & Garrett

    album that's still very nearly great. Compared to the innumerable rows
    of drivel that constitute the ""electronica"" section of your neighborhood
    Sam Goody, <i>Niun Niggung</i> is a sharp realization of Kraftwerk's
    emotional man/machine promise. But when judged against the Mouse on Mars's
    finest work, namely the vinyl-only LPs <i>Instrumentals</i> and <i>Glam</i>,
    this is merely an entertaining and technically accomplished diversion.
    Though they're capable of transcendent beauty, these Germans just want to
    have fun for the time being.</p><p>
    
    Six full-length albums into their career, the Deutschland Duo of Jan
    St Werner and Andi Toma exhibit two distinct musical personalities:
    there's the abstract, glitch-wielding ambient side displayed on
    <i>Instrumentals</i> and St Werner's solo work as <i>Lithops</i>, and
    there's the humorous, off-kilter take on electronic pop as heard on
    <i>Autoditacker</i> and <i>Niun Niggung</i>. If anything, this new
    album takes the pop direction even further, harnessing the group's
    trademark electromagnetic flatulence, amplifying it, and shaping it
    into a strangely melodic but bizarre collage of fragmented sounds.
    Nowhere is this more evident than on the second track, ""Yippie"", which
    twists sampled horns and heavily processed analog synths into a frantic
    cyborg polka. Roll out the 55-gallon barrel of WD-40-- we'll have a
    barrel of fun.</p><p>
    
    And it <i>is</i> fun, too, but it's just not as affecting as ""Download
    Sofist"", the leadoff track that also happens to be <i>Niun Niggung</i>'s
    only real slice of Mouse on Mars's ""serious"" side.  With its striking
    arrangement of classical guitar, treated electronics and French horns,
    the too-brief ""Download Sofist"" soundly beats Stereolab at their own
    game.  As great as the song is, it also points out that the album as a
    whole could use more of this kind of risk-taking.  Mouse on Mars have
    now completely mastered the transatlantic bump of ""Pinwheel Herman"",
    but they've yet to hit the wall on their more experimental side.</p><p>
    
    After all, the slower and more drawn-out Mouse on Mars's tunes are, the
    more time you have to absorb all the astonishing sonic minutiae. For
    example, I first heard a handful of these songs on the <i>Distroia</i>
    EP in the Spring of '99. I was particularly taken with the a track
    called ""Super Sonig Fadeout""; it had the sensuous feel of something off
    Prince's <i>Sign O' the Times</i>, yet the texture was completely robotic.
    When I finally heard <i>Niun Niggung</i>, I discovered that the song was
    actually punchy and fast, and that I was playing my <i>Distroia</i> 12""
    at the incorrect speed of 33 1/3 rpm.  This embarrassing mistake (which
    I never discovered during six months of solid listening) gave me a chance
    to discover what I love most about Mouse on Mars: the gooey, dense details.</p></div>"|5459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5459-niun-niggung/|7.9|Mark Richard-San

    of sleek pop, Matt Johnson is a sort of flipside: the quintessential purveyor
    of bleak, gritty, introspective emotion.  Johnson's diverse arrangements and
    intimate songwriting set him apart from a host of other contemporaries who
    don't have the confidence to pull off direct statements about the heavier
    issues-- religion, the meaning of life, unrequited love, all-pervading
    lust, suicidal destruction.</p><p>
    It's these deep spiritual, carnal, and moralistic pools that The The most
    often dive headlong into.  You'd have to pick the back catalogue pretty thin
    to find an example of Johnson grasping at straws.  Profound, then, is a good
    word to describe his consistently haunting songs, which, even at their most
    detached, resonate somehow deep in their core.  It's as if the distilled
    essence of each and every one is never hidden by the production, no matter
    how detailed.</p><p>
    Eight years on from their classic, <i>Dusk</i>, and five more since their
    competent, if unnecessary Hank Williams cover album, <i>Hanky Panky</i>,
    <i>NakedSelf</i> once again finds Matt Johnson in his element, tackling
    issues of alienation, global corruption, and urban squalor and decay with
    potent, more succinct lyrics and some of his most affecting melodies in
    ages.
    </p><p>
    Johnson has always been the driving force behind The The, but he's managed
    to surrounded himself with tasteful, restrained, and prodigiously talented
    sidemen throughout the years.  The band's alumni-- like Johnny Marr and D.C.
    Collard (whose keyboard work on <i>Dusk</i> was particularly essential to
    its success)-- have always made sure that The The albums were indeed a band
    effort.  <i>NakedSelf</i> finds Johnson with a whole new group of collaborators,
    all of whom ably acquit themselves.  Earl Harvin's hard-rocking, spare yet
    varied approach to drumming provides a muscular backdrop for Johnson's powerful
    vocals and the pervading atmosphere of a city's dingy shadows and less-travelled
    side streets.
    </p><p>
    It's sort of a clich√© to talk about an artist's ""maturation,"" especially one
    the occurs 20 years into their career, but the direct nature of many of the
    songs on <i>NakedSelf</i> make it hard to ignore.  ""My life is halfway through/
    And I still haven't done/ What I'm here to do,"" Johnson powerfully emotes on
    ""Soul Catcher,"" one of the album's immediate highlights.  The suspicious INXS-
    via- Dylan cue-card introduction on ""Global Eyes"" (""Hypnotize/ Homogenize/ Shut
    your eyes/ Don't criticize"") is a bit worrisome, but fortunately that's where
    the similarities end.  Johnson consistently marries thoughtful, vaguely
    apocalyptic lyrics to strong and dusty guitar figures, all skewered with the
    sharp aim of a perfectionist craftsman, and stamped with his unmistakable
    creative seal.
    </p><p>
    That said, <i>NakedSelf</i> is far from easy listening-- not even for the
    seasoned fan.  It's by far the dirtiest, darkest album Matt Johnson has
    released to date, lacking the rather 80's sheen of <i>Infected</i> and <i>Mind
    Bomb</i>, the ambiguous production of his 4AD debut and follow-ups, and the
    slight indulgences and retreats of <i>Dusk</i>.  The rhythm section chugs and
    clangs along loosely and purposefully, and all manner of both deliberately
    strummed and on- the- verge- of- imploding guitar lines fill any sonic space not
    already occupied by Johnson's vocals.
    </p><p>
    This isn't an album likely to evoke memories of summer passions.  Menacing
    lyrics like, ""The train rises up out of the dark/ Above the boarded up
    boulevards/ And burnt out cars,"" probably won't become sing-song choruses for
    drunken college parties.  And certainly, these songs aren't as immediately
    accessible as recent hook-driven efforts by Grandaddy or the Magnetic Fields.
    But these aren't Matt Johnson's intentions.  <i>Nakedself</i> requires your
    interest-- you have to be willing to sit down and actively listen to Johnson
    unravel a few yarns out of his deeply troubled psyche.  Background music, this
    isn't.</p></div>"|7980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7980-nakedself/|7.1|Dan Gardopee

You know who 'They' are: book critics.  Are
    you really going to listen to those bastards? They're just in the business for the press junkets
    and free bookmarks shaped like giant squid, gavels, abducted babies, and other subjects of current
    bestsellers.  But you <i>can</i> judge a book by its cover!  A man with a beard swings from a
    helicopter shooting medieval knights: probably not a good book. 'By Harmony Korine': probably not
    a good book.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, you can judge an album by its cover. Legendary rock critics Lester Bangs and Richard
    Meltzer admit to reviewing albums without a single listen.  We at Pitchfork afford albums the
    luxury of being listened to, naturally.  But still, after all this listening, as we sit before
    our keypads, we notice that, in most cases, all the clues to the album's quality had laid
    hidden in the packaging.  With training, a critic can excavate a review by merely brushing the
    dust from the milky shards of information that poke through the soil of artwork and liner
    notes. Enon's <i>Believo!</i> serves as an adequate example.  Perusing the band's 'thank you'
    list is convincing enough to warrant immediate purchase of this sparkly pop gem.</p><p>
<i>""Enon would like to thank: Les Savy Fav...""</i></p><p>
    
    Right off the bat, Enon thanks their closest musical brethren. Both Les Savy Fav and Enon
    hammer intelligent art-pop that juices familiar nuggets into fresh shakes. Les Savy Fav bark
    awkward/winning slogans over zealous future-punk.</p><p>
<i>""...Jenny Steube...""</i></p><p>
    
    In Danish, ""steube"" means ""very similar, yet opposite in one way,"" and ""jenny steube"" translates
    as ""vice versa."" Thus, by thanking Jenny Steube, coincidentally named after this Danish phrase,
    Enon specify their relation to Les Savy Fav. Les Savy Fav rule in the live environment, but their
    albums have yet to capture the dazzle that nearly frightens audience members, in that fun
    rollercoaster frightening way.  Enon, on the other hand, have mastered the studio.</p><p>
<i>""...Robin Taylor...""</i></p><p>
    
    Robin shares a surname with tragically departed Brainiac singer Timmy.  Enon mastermind John
    Schmersal played guitar for the greatly missed Brainiac, and his presence generated the obvious
    creative leap from the Pixies-ish <i>Smack Bunny Baby</i> to the facemelt of <i>Bonsai
    Superstar</i>. <i>Believo!</i> is an obvious sonic continuation from Brainiac's final release,
    the <i>Electro Shock for President</i> EP. The electronics-drenched, subdued pop of ""Flash Ram""
    echoes in the whistle-along ""Get the Letter Out"" and the organ-driven ""Come Into.""  Enon are
    also less afraid than Brainiac of venturing into simple pleasure and sheep's-clothing
    accessibility.  Yet digital funk like ""Biofeedback"" carries the baton from Brainiac's latefound
    obsession with guitarless rock, like on <i>Electro-Shock</i>'s ""The Turnover.""  If anything,
    Enon are dipped deeper in silicon chips and flossed-out with discovered sounds.</p><p>
<i>""...Mendelsohn Electronics...""</i></p><p>
    
    Ah, yes. That would explain it.</p><p>
<i>""...GvsB...""</i></p><p>
    
    Girls Against Boys' Eli Janney connected the wires from Brainiac's brain to the studio.  Enon's
    bass-heavy opening track, ""Rubber Car,"" takes GvsB's abstract sex-rock to new depths. The double
    bass noir of ""Cruel"" one-ups New Wet Kojak in the rain-slicked, red-lit cocktail lounge
    soundtrack department.  The crackling in its background could be tube television static or
    fat taxi tires splashing through puddles.</p><p>
<i>""...Rick Rubin...""</i></p><p>
    
    This hints at the fist-pumping rock factor. As Rick Rubin had his hand in lots of hip-hop, so
    too does the title track pop along on wild junkyard funk.  ""Conjugate the Verbs"" breaks into
    blissful riffs after a lovely interludes.  ""Rubber Car"" thrusts robotic hips like Beck
    choreographing blacksmiths in an Audi plant.  For <i>Believo!</i> brushes new textures against
    your ears.  The production sounds of an ambiguous fidelity.  Although lo-fi techniques and tools
    are utilized, they're piled in wanton abundance. In concert, Enon play from beaten antique
    suitcases crammed with jury-rigged appliances such as samplers, battery powered turntables,
    and chintzy Casios.</p><p>
<i>""...Drummer's World...""</i></p><p>
    
    Much of this invention comes from the manic mind of Rick Lee, former percussionist for Skeleton
    Key and Butter 08, a man who builds kits from wagons and hubcaps.  His garbage-drumming is
    heard throughout <i>Believo!</i>. ""For the Sum of It"" tumbles along cartoon jungle jazz breaks.
    The result of these three wonderfully demented minds blossoms into surreal structures.  Although
    the molds are familiar, the filling certainly isn't.  Much like a brick house made of ham.  A
    house made of ham bricks.  (<i>""...Debbie Hambrick...""</i>)</p><p>
<i>""...D8N OH10...""</i></p><p>
    
    Who would have thought this little city off I-75 could play to womb to such essential pop?  For
    an much as Enon obviously owes to Brainiac, there is equally as much Breeders powerglee and
    Guided by Voices two-minute hook factory. What's exciting is not so much the overwhelming
    success of this debut, but the notion that Enon still squiggle in their larval state. Anxiously
    await the moth.</p></div>"|2816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2816-believo/|8.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

    yuppies!  Amidst our flaring economy, the cash-obsessed, egocentric
    'elite' have more cash to blow than ever before, and you know what
    that means: they're hip!  Especially in major American cities, these
    wealthy professionals are flocking to upscale outlets such as Borders,
    Barnes &amp; Noble and other places with lots of fancy faux-oak shelving
    to purchase their copies of <i>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</i>.</p><p>
    
    But if there's anything we've learned about these socially, culturally,
    economically, and apparently now, musically conscious individuals is
    that they'll only flock to something for one of three reasons:  1) the hype
    is overwhelming; 2) it's the biggest, most expensive, highest-quality item
    of its kind; 3) Eric, the office trendsetter, recommended it.  My question
    is, where does Yo La Tengo fit into this picture?  A conspiracy theorist
    might conclude that some high-ranking Matador executive slipped a few
    copies of <i>Inside-Out</i> into the offices of large mortgage companies,
    advertising firms, and stockbrokers.  Sadly, it's probably much simpler
    than that.</p><p>
    
    For years, Yo La Tengo have cranked out incredibly diverse albums with
    songs ranging from gentle western twang, to noise-fueled indie anthems,
    to lengthy, distortion-soaked instrumental epics.  But here, Yo La Tengo
    have eliminated the noise they built their name on.  'Upbeat' is no longer
    an accurate descriptor for the trio's music.  Rather, this is an album
    filled with songs in the vein of <i>I Can Hear the Heart</i>'s ""Shadows"",
    <i>Electr-O-Pura</i>'s ""The Hour Grows Late"", and the droning seven-minute
    version of ""Big Day Coming"" off <i>Painful</i>.  And nothing else.</p><p>
    
    So it makes sense when you consider the music-buying trends of the upper
    class.  In the early 90s, they were all over Enigma, the Eagles, Billy Joel
    and Steely Dan.  While bland VH-1 genericism still rules over the majority
    of rich, white folks, they have been catching on of late-- The Flaming Lips'
    <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>, Beck's <i>Mutations</i>, and Mercury Rev's
    <i>Deserter's Songs</i> have all become big sellers in their demographic.
    Of course, this doesn't mean the underground can't enjoy it, too.  Oh,
    sure, we're used to a slightly different Yo La Tengo-- one that once
    burned through rockers like ""From a Motel 6,"" ""False Alarm,"" and ""Sugarcube,""
    and kept it loud even during the quiet tracks.</p><p>
    
    Among <i>Inside-Out</i>'s sea of gentle lullabies, it's easy to long for
    the stunning diversity this band is known for.  However, it's clear they
    were shooting for something different this time around.  The album's cover
    depicts quiet dusk in a common outer suburb.  Electrical wires stretch over
    a standard one-story home.  The backyard is crowded with pine trees.  To the
    far right, a man stands at the end of the driveway, a spot of light beaming
    down around him from the darkening sky above.  It's a traditional image of
    alien abduction that encapsulates the peaceful ringing of the record's gently
    picked electric guitars and serene vocals.  The cover speaks to the band's
    intentions behind the music: a dreamlike state, lulling, serene, tranquil.</p><p>
    
    Despite <i>Inside-Out</i>'s tendency to fade to background music during the
    first couple of listens, the album features few songs in need of omission.
    Only the album's later material seems less inspired.  ""Madeline,"" at times,
    recalls the melody of the album's only driving, uptempo rock track, ""Cherry
    Chapstick.""  The rhythmic instrumental ""Tired Hippo,"" while an excellent fit
    on this record, could have been better served as a b-side.  And of course,
    everyone's biggest gripe, the 17 minute-long closing track, ""Night Falls on
    Hoboken,"" is pretty lacking when compared with their past epics.</p><p>
    
    Regardless, the first three-quarters of <i>Inside-Out</i> contains some of Yo
    La Tengo's best work to date.  As a whole, however, it may be one of their less
    ear-catching records.  If recorded by an aspiring young band, <i>Inside-Out</i>
    would be deemed the next big thing by all music press.  However, people are
    used to Ira Kaplan's masterful electric assaults and the broad range of sounds
    that generally appear in spades on Yo La Tengo's LPs.  Still, this record is
    among the best I've heard so far this year, and will likely remain that way.</p></div>"|8870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8870-and-then-nothing-turned-itself-inside-out/|8.1|Ryan Schreiber

It's a simple black-
    and-white photo, featuring a dark-haired girl facing away from the camera, staring out onto an
    endless black-and-white beach. It's somber and cosmic, conjuring images of those freaky 1920's
    German expressionist silent films. It's subdued, restrained and, in a weird, bleak way, kind of
    beautiful.</p><p>
    
    Given all of this album's subliminal, smooth cover-art warm-up, it's a damn shame that Vue's 
    music couldn't sound a little more like a silent film.  However, after building up listeners'
    hopes for a cool, artsy album with their cool, artsy cover, Vue instead turn around and piss
    in everyone's eye by dishing out 11 tracks of smarmy, glitzy, flash-and-trash rock music.
    Sounding like a strange blend of soulless southern rock, lazy college rock and bad, bad late
    70's glam-rock, Vue's music blends everything that is already wrong about rock music with
    their own even worse Euro-trash tendencies.  This album gives rock music such a bad name that
    it makes me wonder if these silly fuckers might not be the indie rock Antichrists, sent here 
    to destroy good rock music for us all.</p><p>
    
    After listening to the first few songs of the album, I little voice in my head started saying,
    ""You've heard all of this before."" ""But,"" I replied to the voice, ""if I had ever heard music 
    this bad before in my life, I'm sure I would have remembered it."" The voice spoke back, saying,
    ""Ah, listen more closely, grasshopper."" That's when it hit me. I <i>had</i> heard music this
    awful before, but I'd never heard so much awful stuff squeezed into such a tiny space-- so much
    concentrated shit making such a shamelessly terrible final product.</p><p>
    
    Mixing the irritating pretension of a Sonic Youth spoken word track with a grungier Mott the
    Hoople, <i>Vue</i> is so cluttered with nonsense that listening to it is an exercise in
    patience. The five-member band produces an amazingly empty and joyless sound.  There's no fun
    or electricity whatsoever. The songs have all the thematic range of a 2 Live Crew album (sex,
    boys, weird chicks, boys and sex) and all the lyrical ingenuity of a Bon Jovi b-side. With this
    delicate mixture of musical crap and verbal crap firmly set, Vue manage to set new a standard 
    for complete and utter sonic retardation. The result is music that's about as subtle as a
    flying mallet and half as much fun to listen to.</p><p>
    
    Taken separately, the pieces of this music suck just as much as the whole.  Frontman Rex
    Shelverton, isn't so much singing as he is painfully over-emoting unconvincingly. Using
    irritating repetition and endless vocal effects to try and disguise his toneless whine, Rex
    screeches his way emotionlessly through the album's 41 long, long minutes.  The most profound 
    line Shelverton manages on the entire record is, ""Try, try, try, try"" from ""We Were Here.""
    Though, the three separate songs in which a chorus builds around slight variations of the
    line, ""I want to see you undress,"" are nice, too.  Apparently, Rex didn't think anyone would
    pay much attention to his lyrics, either.</p><p>
    
    Every track on <i>Vue</i> sounds identical to the last.  Its opening track, ""White Traffic,""
    blows the band's wad early in the game, running through Vue's very small bag of tricks within 
    the first 20 seconds of the record.  So the rest of the album, on top of being lame, isn't even
    surprisingly lame-- it's just lame. You could listen to this unmanageable pile of crap backwards
    and it would make as much sense as if you played it straight through.</p><p>
    
    I firmly believe that there should be some sort of legal penalty for making an album this bad.
    We could say that it's slanderous against all rock music, then we could start dishing out some
    much-deserved ass-kicking. Maybe Sub Pop should have to pay us all punitive damages and Vue
    should be forced to be pick up trash along the highway. This just goes to prove my theory that
    if new bands were forced to take some sort of written test before we let them in the studio--
    possible an essay exam-- we'd never have to worry about Cro-Magnons like this making an album 
    this worthless again.</p></div>"|8502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8502-vue/|0.2|Steven Byrd

After having in rotation about 20 discs of varying
    genres for about two months, I reach the final offering: <i>Tragic Epilogue</i>. When writing 
    reviews, you soon see that the best discs and worst discs make themselves evident early on,
    begging immediate attention. It's the unspectacular discs that linger. Thus, we come to Anti
    Pop Consortium.</p><p>
    Perhaps I'm spoiled.  <i>Tragic Epilogue</i> will surely remind you of Kool Keith's
    cock-rocking rhymes ensconced in twisted samples and off-kilter beats, but without many of the 
    things that make his style so effective. Where Keith's rhymes veer from the preposterous to the
    ridiculous and back again, Anti-Pop Consortium rhymesters Priest, Beans and M. Sayyid wallow in
    enervating obscurity that, while sometimes fresh and dead-on, is too often flat and unworthy of
    interest. Where Keith's verbose wordplay winks sarcastically, Anti-Pop is disappointingly
    earnest, as if by taking themselves seriously, we will, too.  No.</p><p>
    Generally minimal, preferring repeating loops over cut-n-splice, much of <i>Tragic Epilogue</i>
    is occupied by one rapper rhyming over a loop that cycles repeatedly, giving many tracks an
    unpleasant endless feel. This sense transfers to the album as a whole with few sonic mileposts
    to signify what track-- or even what half of the album-- you're hearing. Most of the juiciest
    soundbytes are laid down at track openings, only to vanish and not be revisited.</p><p>
    Yet, <i>Tragic Epilogue</i> is clearly fresh by overall rap standards.  There are few rappers
    around these days that could even compare to Kool Keith, and that's to Anti-Pop's credit. The
    track transitions and a few of the beats are interesting, pulling together a combination of
    clich√©d 4/4 rap beats and edgy Autechre-inspired electronic mutations. It's a hopeful
    combination, but my sense is that Anti-Pop Consortium is clinging to the tired rap paradigm of
    rhyme and simple beat. They take small risks that beg bigger ones, and finally disappoint when
    the goods aren't delivered.</p><p>
<i>Tragic Epilogue</i> is riddled with a feeling of unrealized potential that doesn't quite go
    the distance. It's an auspicious debut, but one that's more likely to draw your attention to
    the band's future than to send you scattering for spare change to pick it up.</p></div>"|209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/209-tragic-epilogue/|6.5|James P. Wisdom

    entertainment. I felt that that whatever happens when the Web and TV merge for good, it won't
    make anybody happier. I said that my present Internet experience gives me what I need-- even
    over a 56k modem I can read news, check out music, and so on-- and I don't feel like I'm
    wanting. And my friend said that you never know what you need until somebody gives it to you.</p><p>
    
    Something similar seems to have happened with instrumental rock. Ten years ago, there was very
    little of the stuff around, and nobody seemed the worse for it. There was fusion, sure, but the
    only fusion people would admit to liking back then had much more to do with jazz and funk--
    stuff like Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock. True rock instrumentals were limited to surf bands,
    and the occasional side-long prog opus.  The prospect of instrumental rock music back then
    actually seemed pretty damned boring. Then Slint came along and changed things, and Tortoise
    finished what they started.  These days, most indie rock children need some instrumental music
    in their collections, even though they'd never have considered it in 1990.</p><p>
    
    This brings us to Billy Mahonie, an instrumental rock band from the UK.  One thing I've learned
    from listening to bands like Mogwai (whom Billy Mahonie have been compared to) is that you need
    to hear some records a half-dozen times or more before they mean anything. Mogwai's last
    full-length, in fact, is still keeping me at arm's length, even after having owned it for
    nearly a year. Similarly, the first few passes through Billy Mahonie's <i>The Big Dig</i>
    reminded me of chugging a glass of warm water when you're not even thirsty. But the more I
    listened to it, the more often interesting subtleties kept popping up.</p><p>
    
    Billy Mahonie don't bring anything new to the table, and <i>The Big Dig</i> certainly isn't
    going to change anybody's life, but this is definitely a solid album. These guys can all play
    (guitar, two basses, drums) and they have a knack for solid riffs and catchy guitar leads.
    But since they don't rock very hard and aren't into studio manipulation (my favorite part of
    the Mogwai experience), the prettiest tracks on <i>The Big Dig</i> are the best.  Of these,
    ""Drago"" is the most immediately engaging, with a wandering, wistful melody that begs for soft,
    pleasing visuals.</p><p>
    
    ""William Derbyshire"" has a gently uplifting chord progression that glows extra bright with
    ringing acoustic guitar accents. More uptempo but equally as effective is ""Watching People
    Speaking When You Can't Hear What They're Saying,"" which layers slide guitar right out of U2's
    ""Bullet the Blue Sky"" over a frenzied, propulsive rhythm before breaking down into a slow, airy
    section with a lovely guitar melody. And so it seems that while I may not have needed another
    instrumental rock record in my collection, I wound up enjoying <i>The Big Dig</i>.</p></div>"|696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/696-the-big-dig/|6.5|Mark Richard-San

I've been subconsciously neglecting the Poster
    Children's latest, <i>DDD</i>, since I received it from Pitchfork Central.
    For months now, this album's been inexplicably buried beneath a stack of
    sadly forgettable CDs-- bands that will almost instantly be flushed from
    my memory after I melt down their worthless plastic to make homemade
    explosives. But my mysterious subconscious reluctance to review <i>DDD</i>
    is all too appropriate if you consider that, throughout most of their
    productive 13-year career, the Poster Children's achievements have been
    mysteriously obscured by many flavors-of-the-month and flashes-in-the-pan.</p><p>
    
    Yes, the Poster Children have always been underrated and overlooked for no
    good reason, if you ask me. True, they've resigned themselves to residing
    in their native Champaign, Illinois, dodging the limelight. They've endured
    the major label swine, and apparently, learned a thing or two from the
    experience: the band now records in their own studio for the New York-based
    indie, SpinART.  On <i>DDD</i>, they sound like a band with nothing to lose,
    and under no obligation to please some fat-assed, cigar-chomping record exec
    looking for the next Oasis.</p><p>
    
    Guitarists Rick and Jim Valentin expertly intertwine their respective parts,
    referencing '60s psychedelia, punk, and the more obvious hook-driven pop that
    Doug Martsch's Built to Spill has executed since their 1993 debut. And it's
    probably a good thing critics don't often wax hyperbolic over the Valentin
    brothers. Who knows? Rick and Jim might lose their heads and release a live
    album containing a 20-minute version of ""Cortez the Killer"" or something
    unthinkable like that.</p><p>
    
    Now, it's true that, on <i>DDD</i>, the Poster Children uncharacteristically
    force some funky elements into their usual guitar/bass/drums barrage, as on
    ""The Old School and the New,"" which is a kind of self-conscious attempt to
    put the Poster Child past forever behind them and look to the future. ""The
    past is not the place to die,"" they insist.  But don't let the word ""funk""
    throw you-- we're talking maybe some sped-up, warped Railroad Jerk blues here,
    not some cut-out bin G. Love/R. Kelly hybrid.</p><p>
    
    Actually, on ""Daisy Changed,"" the Poster Children integrate some early '80s
    neo-funk Moog junk with commendable skill.  The song appears to be a clever
    allegorical commentary on assholes like me who never listened to Boston's
    advice on ""Don't Look Back.""  The Poster Children's feelings on this track
    are pretty clear to me, and I'll take my lumps: ""Daisy changed/ She's not the
    same girl/ You knew back in school/ She's all grown up/ How 'bout you?""</p><p>
    
    Valentin and crew always pick great lead-off tracks, setting just the right
    tone for the rest of the album.  Listen to the simple air-tight structure
    of ""This Town Needs a Fire"" and its rocket-blast tempos, punchy rhythm guitar,
    and volatile, exploding chorus. Meanwhile, ""Strange Attraction"" gives a slight
    nod to early '90s navel-gazing-- delayed guitars soar off into space, flutes
    coo, feedback fuzz-blankets unfold all around-- yet the band kicks it up a
    notch, driving it into a blazing rock anthem.  And check the biting stab they
    take at their own semi-obscure underground status on ""Zero Stars:"" ""We're
    not on the TV/ We're not on the charts/ We don't know our places/ And we don't
    know who we are.""</p><p>
<i>DDD</i> is much more sonically ambitious and melodically inventive than
    1999's <i>New World Record</i>, or 1997's <i>RTFM</i>, and quite possibly their
    second-best album ever. Yes, I'll have to admit, <i>DDD</i> isn't their greatest
    work.  Inarguably, that award goes to their thrilling post-punk guitar blow-out,
    1990's <i>Daisychain Reaction</i>, a glorious artifact the band will probably
    never improve upon.  But given the other highly-touted 2000 releases I've suffered
    through this year, <i>DDD</i> may as well be the <i>White Album</i> of our
    generation.</p></div>"|6436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6436-ddd/|7.8|Michael Sandlin

    of the British invasion (the Animals, Small Faces, the Kinks, the Yardbirds, Rolling Stones,
    Creation, the Beatles) or its influence on American garage bands (he's the expert on this topic--
    I'd ask him to name a few but he's in the bathroom right now). 1966 was the year music changed.
    It lost its innocence. Drugs, new recording techniques, stereo sound-- all these factors pushed
    rock and roll from out of the nest to about six inches above the ground, where it learned to
    soar.""</i></p><p>
    
    ""Yes, yes, yes. To all of our listeners, we're here with Pitchfork music critic Chip Chanko.

    call yourself a music critic?""</p><p>
    
    ""Brian, I'm just here doing my thing. I'm listening to the stuff and getting the word to all the
    fans out there. Here's another part of my latest review... and a one...""</p><p>
<i>""The Who manifest the change music was going through.  From straight-ahead rock to the broad
    scope of Pete Townshend's later works, they evolved as the scene evolved.  </i>BBC Sessions<i>
    captures on-air performances from 1965 to 1973.  The band routinely stopped by Radio 1 Studios
    between albums and tours.  The radio format limited them to the basic song structures (no long
    jams) without being able to perform any studio tricks, so energy is the most important
    ingredient here.""</i></p><p>

    ""Well, I think I'll do a little more from my latest review, The Who's <i>BBC Sessions</i>...
    Ahhhhhhhh Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaahhh!!!!""</p><p>
<i>""The fact that these songs are presented in a live format makes this a great documentation
    of the transitional periods of the Who's career, stripped of their studio effects and complex
    production. From their early hits ""My Generation,"" ""See My Way,"" and ""Substitute"" to the more
    expansive ""A Quick One (While He's Away),"" these versions span the pre-</i>Tommy<i> days to the 
    follow-ups like ""The Seeker,"" ""Relay,"" and ""Long Live Rock.""  The collection works as kind of a
    greatest hits antithesis to </i>Tommy<i> or </i>Quadrophenia<i>, and as a counterpart to 1970's
    </i>Live at Leeds<i>.""</i></p><p>

    electronica.  The fact that pop and rock are principally derived from the
    organic unity of several instruments combining to create a singular sound
    is rendered moot by the reality that electronic music begins with organic
    unity as an immediate instance of synchronicity.  So one could posit the
    viewpoint that the attempt to create organic unity in electronic music is
    pointless.</p><p>
    
    Of course, electronic music has caused something of a viral infection in
    pop music. Whereas before it was content to keep pace with digital media and
    exercise developmental innovation in the processing of sound, the genre has
    now begun to appropriate the intent of pop.  The role of guitar as an organic
    cog-in-the-wheel has died, and pop music has since begun to resemble a cyborg.</p><p>
    
    DAT Politics is a laptop quartet from Lille, France.  An offshoot of the much
    whispered about French post-rock group Tone Rec (of which three of these four 
    guys are members), <i>Villiger</i> is their second album of sharp, densely
    arranged electronic product.  It's an amazing picture of where electronica
    and pop music meet, a jaw-droppingly consistent instance of glitchy electronics
    and massively processed tones wedded to a more traditional musical heritage.</p><p>
    
    The band applies a more populist approach to the groundbreaking static
    orchestrations exemplified by Mego artists like Fennesz and Pita without
    diluting the sonic edge of the work.  The four members interact and bounce
    ideas off one another relentlessly, using shards of overheated electronics to
    sculpt a profoundly melodic musical interplay.</p><p>
    
    The tracks range from miniature exercises in digital sound processing to 
    full-blown beat-driven electro-pop songs, each track blazing its own stylistic
    trail as it develops.  On one track, they manage to evoke a horn section
    tripping over a distinct melodic theme.  The song's subsequent breakdown even
    seems to approximate something like what George Martin might produce if locked
    up in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.</p><p>
<i>Villiger</i> is the heavy-handedness of experimental music skillfully
    tempered by a refreshingly engaging approach.  DAT Politics provide a vibrant
    fusion of electronic music with a pop sensibility without sacrificing the
    edge of its musical process.  That their work is the product of an organic
    group dynamic lends this album its immediacy and verve.  Two members of Tone
    Rec have recently abandoned guitar and bass for notebook computers.  As it
    should be.</p></div>"|2173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2173-villiger/|8.3|S. Murray

    dinner.  Except it was one of those nights when what we referred to as ""swordfish"" 
    took the form of a giant slab of ground beef.  The bloody hunk of meat covered
    three square feet of counter space and towered six inches thick, and after
    preparing a small portion, we were left at a loss as to what to do with the unruly
    leftovers.  Since it's unsanitary to keep so much raw meat in the fridge, we were
    faced with only two options: we could either cook the rest of it and pack up the
    tamed result in Tupperware, or better yet, we could look into returning the unused
    portion to the supermarket.</p><p>
    Naturally, I felt extremely uncomfortable with the idea of returning the meat.
    We'd already handled it and eaten part of it.  It was left at room temperature
    for 20 minutes!  If the Stop &amp; Shop took it back and sold it to another customer,
    what would that say about where the meat had already been when we purchased it?</p><p>
    I woke up in a cold sweat with clenched teeth and my nails driven into my palms.
    As a long time vegetarian who recently began experimenting with fish, the excess of
    bloody carnage I referred to as swordfish seemed somewhat creepy, as it hinted that,
    in my waking hours, I might naively be consuming a ""gateway meat.""  Yes, I'm
    concerned that eating swordfish will lead first to ""harder meats,"" and eventually
    to heroin addiction.  Third Eye Foundation's <i>Little Lost Soul</i> is a soundtrack
    for such nightmares.</p><p>
    Just kidding! Like fellow Bristol natives Portishead, the Third Eye Foundation
    (otherwise known as TEF, 3EF, or Matt Elliot) is endlessly compared to soundtracks
    of nightmares, creepy sleepless nights, and haunting films that haven't been made.
    <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> called Third Eye Foundation's music ""like a soundtrack
    to some great lost surrealist film."" <i>Flagpole</i> writes that Elliot, who
    collaborated with Flying Saucer Attack in their earlier days, comes up with ""some
    most disturbing dream soundtracks.""  Wasn't this clich√© beaten into submission like
    three years ago?</p><p>
    Third Eye Foundation's third full-length on Merge can be aptly described with 
    the vocabulary of nightmares.  That is, the album's mood could be described as
    ""haunted,"" ""lonely,"" ""lingering urban darkness,"" ""chilling ambient constructions of
    uncertain sonic terrain,"" ""layers of bleak drones that crumble under breakbeats and
    digital bleeps,"" ""spooky pastiche,"" ""eerie,"" and ""otherworldly.""  But any respectable
    nightmare isn't comprised of haunted-house synths and spooky loops of minor-key
    drones.  Truly disturbing dreams are made of uncomfortable pacing, plodding
    anticipation, and disarming juxtapositions.  And that's what's missing from <i>Little
    Lost Soul</i>.</p><p>
    A lack of reference to relevant cultural narratives is what separates <i>Little 
    Lost Soul</i>'s innocuously pleasant spook-out from albums like <i>Endtroducing</i>
    that manipulate you into sonic spaces in which you might feel hesitant to step
    forward before finding yourself pushed.  DJ Shadow's uncomfortably alluring
    concoction of cultural references and urban found-sound tag-teamed familiar beats
    with cinematic pacing.  Clearly, it has a far greater chance of approximating the
    world of dreams than bent drones and choirgirl vocals run through reverb pedals.</p><p>  
    When Matt Elliot rid himself of the rougher textures and harder jungle beats of his
    1997 LP, <i>Ghost</i>, some of Third Eye Foundation's nervous energy was traded in
    for a sound palate that shared more than just a few tricks with the more goth end of
    the new age spectrum.  On <i>Little Lost Soul</i>, Elliot has pointlessly sugared the
    pill with smoother production, and as a result, the album lacks the power of the
    dreamworlds its eerie textures allude to.  Personally, I'd rather swallow the less
    refined <i>Ghost</i>.  If we're going to sugar the pill, it better not be a placebo.</p></div>"|8010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8010-little-lost-soul/|5.9|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    project your fantasies onto. Perhaps we thought of her a la Prefab Sprout's ""The Ice Maiden""--
    the high-class, hyper-stylish beauty that was manipulative and cold, yet irresistible. But
    unlike Paddy, we had no illusions that we could singe her pretty blond lashes.</p><p>
    
    We also had no illusions about whether or not she was what made Saint Etienne work-- she
    obviously wasn't. ""She could be replaced with one more from the assembly line!"" we quipped.
    So, what would it take to get us to change our minds?  A new, similar frontwoman stepping into
    her shoes after a split over ""creative differences?"" How about a Sarah Cracknell solo album?
    Initially, this seemed like some sort of sick joke.  And damn her if she didn't confound us
    all by releasing an album on which neither Etienne bandmates Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs were
    anywhere to be found. On top of that, she co-wrote every track. And on top of <i>that</i>,
    most of the songs were good. So, there we were back in 1997 with a really nice Cracknell album,
    left to wonder what Saint Etienne sound like without her.  This re-release gives us another
    chance to evaluate the whole situation.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately (or unfortunately for you what-if'ers out there), Cracknell has continued to front
    the rather prolific Etienne bunch, without releasing any new solo material. <i>Lipslide</i>
    makes it abundantly clear that Ian Catt, co-writer of a few tracks on the record, is a damn
    fine arranger. Techno-pop refuses to die as long as every single blasted one of us has that
    musical sweet tooth for precision cheese. Finally, we come to realize that her lack of a
    distinctive, forceful voice actually doesn't matter one damn bit. Let's get real, naysayers.
    Can you imagine Sleater-Kinney belting out ""Coastal Town?"" How about Cat Power doing ""Fifth
    Floor?""  No?  What about Whitney Houston belting about a sensitive English lad on ""Ready or
    Not?"" Hopefully, this is getting through to you.</p><p>
    
    The bottom line is that Cracknell's voice suits these songs.  Despite the fact that she
    doesn't have many tricks in her vocal bag, her keen sense of pitch makes those upper-register
    harmonies a real treat. Unfortunately for those who loved her ultra-soprano wind-chime vocal
    lines on early Etienne records, she stays in a relatively middling range for the better part
    of this record.</p><p>
    
    Blond dance-pop diva. Six or seven people working on the record. It sounds like a page out of
    a Madonna biography.  But if we can grudgingly admit that Madonna pulled it off, surely we can
    give as much credit to Cracknell and her co-writers, right? Sure, we can! This is dance-pop
    fluff of the highest order. Anyone who wants to challenge me on that can go to hell with
    headphones glued to their ears, a discman with batteries that never die, and Mandy Moore's
    <i>So Real</i> on shuffle-repeat. Then you will know true pain.</p><p>
    
    The tracks on <i>Lipslide</i> are accomplished synth-pop productions with relatively fluid
    writing, appropriately simplistic lyrical content, and almost disgustingly memorable melodies.
    Things get shaken up a little bit here and there-- Ian Catt's Spectorian sheen on ""Can't Stop
    Now"" turns Cracknell into a whitebread Ronette (I'm going with Ronnie, actually) faster than
    you can get up the energy to groan. ""Oh Boy, the Feeling When You Held My Hand"" is a drumless,
    acoustic guitar-driven Latin number which draws a simple poignancy from its pared down
    arrangement.</p><p>
    
    For a twelve-track album, there's remarkably little throwaway filler, although it's highly
    likely that certain unnamed individuals in certain unnamed publications may consider the
    entire thing filler. However, select tracks fall short of the mark due to generic,
    by-the-motions writing (""Desert Baby"") and, disturbingly, sounding a whole lot like Berlin
    (""4 Months, 2 Weeks"").  So, let us sit back and once again reflect on Cracknell's minor
    triumph over the daunting obstacles we all placed before her. We treated her like a poodle.
    ""Jump through hoops,"" we said. ""We dare you."" She did us one better by throwing the hoop up
    in the air, setting it on fire, jumping through it, and giving us one of those lovely
    fingers-- probably the middle one. We surrender, Sarah. How about a kiss?</p></div>"|1652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1652-lipslide/|7.9|Dan Gardopee

Sure,
    minimalist pioneers like Steve Reich and Philip Glass used simple patterns and constant
    repetition, but every subtle change in the music was carefully thought out.  Each theme was
    left unchanged long enough to create an enthralling rhythm, and rarely hung around long enough
    to become stagnant. Each tiny shift in the music seemed greatly magnified, and took on huge
    significance.</p><p>
    I'm a big fan of early minimalist works, most notably Steve Reich's 1970-71 masterwork,
    <i>Drumming</i>.  Over the course of its 55 minutes, <i>Drumming</i> takes a simple rhythmic
    figure, and expands upon and mutates it.  On <i>Clicks and Cuts</i>, each track averages about
    four minutes-- hardly enough time for the type of development that makes minimalism interesting.
    And while the variety of artists mixes up the sound, the real beauty of minimalist music, the
    subtle shifts and transitions, is almost completely lost.</p><p>
    Of course, this album is not without its interesting moments. Ester Brinkmann's ""Maschine""
    could have been a fascinating piece, with its rhythmically complex static patterns and distant
    synthesizer noises.  About halfway through the track, though, an intolerably simple drum machine
    beat instantly robs the piece of its intricacy, and some guy who sounds like Doctor Strangelove
    enters the mix with an annoying refrain in that passionate, romantic language of love, German.</p><p>
    Interesting though they may be, these pieces are hard to take. Rhythmically manipulated analog
    noise can be interesting, but it rarely makes for a truly compelling listen. The only track on
    <i>Clicks and Cuts</i> that seems truly awe-inspiring is All's ""√úberall,"" a beautifully layered
    piece of music that commands every iota of your attention with its contrasting rhythms, and
    hypnotizes with its ever-repeating bassline.  But again, at only four minutes, it leaves you
    craving more.</p><p>
    What hurts is that there's so much potential in this music.  A few of these pieces could present
    a truly intriguing future for electronic minimalism.  Unfortunately, too many of these tracks
    follow the same dreadfully uninteresting formula: cheesy drum machine beats, grating hisses, 
    and nondescript beeps repeating into infinity.  Sure, sometimes less is more.  On <i>Clicks and
    Cuts</i>, less is just less.</p></div>"|1935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1935-clicks-and-cuts/|5.0|Matt LeMay

Although not as cool to look at and play with as 
    7"", you usually get a couple more songs, and generally at a similar price.
    They're even more fun when you're dealing with a band like Superchunk, whose
    recorded output is pretty consistently enjoyable-- you're pretty much
    guaranteed a couple of pleasant tracks.</p><p>
    
    On <i>1000 Pounds</i>, we get the album version of the title track, a great
    studio outtake (""White Noise""), a David Bowie cover (""Scary Monsters""), and
    a lovely acoustic reworking of ""1000 Pounds,"" wherein Mac McCaughan's
    outrageously catchy lead guitar is replaced by... a xylophone!  It comes
    across as bunch of friends sitting on a porch in the summertime, knocking
    out a tune for the sake of knocking out a tune. The laid-back feel of this
    track is totally infectious-- there's even a banjo plucking along
    good-naturedly in the background for good measure.</p><p>
    
    As for the other two non-album cuts, well, ""White Noise"" is a cool song.
    Sure, it's not quite up to the standards of most of <i>Come Pick Me Up</i>'s
    material.  Hey, maybe that's why it's a b-side.  The Bowie cover is a bit
    stranger.  ""Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)"" is culled from Bowie's 1980
    album of the same name, which is generally considered his last hurrah before
    the downhill slope of <i>Let's Dance</i> and everything else that followed.
    Here, Superchunk make the song their own-- if you hadn't heard the original,
    you'd suspect nothing.  It makes for a few truly endearing minutes, and
    fits in alongside the rest of the EP's songs nicely.</p><p>
    
    Certainly, the single is a must for Superchunk fans.  I mean, it's Superchunk!
    Of <i>course</i> the fans are going to buy it.  And of course, if you've never
    heard Superchunk and you've only got $5 to spend, <i>1000 Pounds</i> will make
    as good an introduction to their music as any of their other EPs.  But be
    forewarned-- once you listen, there's no going back.</p></div>"|7619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7619-1000-pounds-ep/|7.0|Jeremy Schneyer

It's an institution.  Unfortunately for
    Turing Machine, it's an institution that's already been founded and largely
    drained of its grant money.  Countless bands have approached its information
    desk, filled out their forms, collected their funding, recorded timeless
    albums, and faded back into obscurity.  Sure, the genre spawned its share of
    legends, but these days, it takes more than just repeating unusual melodic
    and rhythmic patterns to warrant peoples' interest.</p><p>
    That said, the main problem Turing Machine faces is that they aren't fronted
    by a lyricist.  The music is fine on its own, recalling bands like Unwound,
    Shellac, and these guys' former full-time outfit, Pitchblende.  But without
    a vocal melody to hold things together, this is just another faceless indie
    band rehashing what Trans Am and Don Caballero have already accomplished.</p><p>
    Still, the New York-based trio have made the most of their craft and their
    execution is almost flawless.  These seven tracks are no less listenable
    than anything issued by Turing Machine's predecessors.  Distorted guitars ring
    through <i>A New Machine for Living</i> like windchimes in a tropical hurricane,
    the drumset is mercilessly punished for refusing to follow orders, and time
    signatures go through more changes than David Bowie's sexual preference in a
    London nightclub.
    </p><p>
    Other things Turing Machine have going for them are their tightness, their
    raw vigor, and their technical prowess.  If nothing else, this album is a
    great example of what can be achieved on a technical level when a band truly
    puts their heart into the music.  The best part is, this band is rumored to
    be as proficient live as they are on record, if not more so.  Sadly, that
    doesn't make their album any more interesting.  (Though, I probably will
    check them out when they come through town.)
    </p><p>
    It's not as much the kind of music these guys play as <i>when</i> they're
    playing it.  In the critical indie rock climate of 2000, this style of music
    has not only been done before, its time has also practically passed. The
    1990s saw plenty of this type of stuff going on, specifically from labels
    like Touch and Go and Thrill Jockey, but if people wanted to hear the same
    type of thing done over and over again, they would have cloned Menudo years
    ago.  We're in a new decade now, and just as disco withered at the end of
    the 70s, the time has come to lay pretentious instrumental indie rock to rest.
    </p><p>
    Nope, it didn't take long to mine and hollow this limited genre.  Any original
    sound that could be drawn out of guitars, bass and drums has long since been
    extracted.  Yeah, there are probably a few things that haven't been tried out
    yet, but I can't think of what they might be.  And apparently, neither could
    Turing Machine, a band whose ferocious sound will either mark the last time
    anyone attempted this kind of aggressive background music, or be forgotten
    among stacks and stacks of similarly artsy noise-rock LPs.
    </p><p>
    It's conceivable that Turing Machine could offer an infinitely more creative
    follow-up sometime next year.  After all, this is only their debut album.  But
    if <i>A New Machine for Living</i> is any indicator of things to come, this band's
    tragic downfall will have been that they simply didn't introduce enough of their
    own vision into the mix to make their music relevant.

The piece
    depicted Europe with substituted country names and surreal clippings. Scandinavia was dubbed
    ""Cock &amp; Balls""; Switzerland was noted only for their chocolate. Humorous cut-and-paste crafts
    aren't typical rock 'n' roll hotel room behavior. Yet after hearing the Beta Band, little else
    is expected. It's reassuring to step behind the curtain and realize the giant talking head of
    the wizard is actually a giant talking wizard's head. The Beta Band really do live in their
    pastiche pastures and carry Dada handbags. Their new stand-alone single proves they're still
    burning fuel past escape velocity-- they effortlessly surpass their peers with two seemingly
    simple songs.</p><p>
    
    ""To You Alone"" opens with a bellowing bass pulse and tantric humming before stuttering into
    epileptic beats and a plaintive keyboard melody. The song punches a hole through the back of
    TLC's ""No Scrubs"", rips out the spine, and reconstructs an interstellar psychedelic booty call.
    Further blurring the line between dance, jazz, rock, and folk, ""To You Alone"" manages to make
    an 808 blurt out hair-raising space-pop. A crescendo of drums pile up during the chorus.</p><p>
    
    Steve Mason weaves a unique take on unrequited love with his longing lyrics. ""You do not realize
    the line that runs from me across the universe to you alone,"" he sadly observes. The impending
    doom of the one-way relationship is wonderfully wrapped in the metaphor: ""A black box inside my
    mind recalls the time we spend together."" Finally, he proclaims in a mix of pride and resignation,
    ""I'm gonna sing it like a fool/ I've been singing like a fool.""  The Beta Band's ability to touch
    on such emotions while simultaneously expanding pop music's vocabulary justifies every ounce of
    hype surrounding them.</p><p>
    
    ""Sequinsizer"" provides more of an instrumental funk. The nocturnal urban pulse blends Aphex
    Twin's ""Windowlicker"" and Primal Scream's ""Swastika Eyes"". A clarinet drifts over basslines
    that rocket like metro lines. Fat keyboards make the groove positively nasty. With a single
    track, the Beta Band offhandedly outdate everything Underworld pumped out in the last couple
    years. If Miles Davis worked with Warp Records, this might be the result.</p><p>
    
    On this single, the Beta Band recontextualize hip-hop and city rhythms into their sylvan
    fantasy planet. You can take Mos Def, your so-called hip-hop savior, and shove him up your
    Monch-- you can find him ""keeping it real"" on the new Scritti Politti record.  When it comes
    to futuristic hip-hop-- and rock for that matter-- I'd rather place my bets on these four
    scruffy Scots.</p></div>"|667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/667-to-you-alone-ep/|8.5|Brent DiCrescenzo

    illustrious educational institution that I attend, which happens to be overwhelmingly white.
    The Roots, if you didn't know, are overwhelmingly black, which made for quite an interesting
    evening.  'Fork editor Ryan had sent me <i>The Roots Come Alive</i> for review, so I felt it
    my duty as a critic to pay far too much cash in order to bear witness to this live music
    phenomenon.  And what a spectacle it was.  As the seething throng of white bodies lurched
    quasi-rhythmically to the abundance of soul presented on stage, I began to wonder if The
    Roots really felt compelled to try very hard to impress the crowd.</p><p>
    
    I would imagine that this is something of a burning question for The Roots, who play a massive
    250 shows each year.  They could be doing crossword puzzles up there while halfheartedly
    rapping, and the vast majority of the crowd would still be jumping around madly.  This
    particular crowd was so thoroughly unfunky that when Black Thought thrust the mic toward the
    crowd for an exhaustively planned and explained ""rock, rock on"" for the tenth time, the
    crowd still seemed genuinely surprised and temporarily stunned.  So something just seems
    fundamentally askew when, for example, Black Thought busts out with a ""y'all wit' me,
    Switzerland?"" after an ill groove on <i>The Roots Come Alive</i>.  Grandmaster Flash would
    roll over in his grave, and he's not even dead yet.</p><p>
    
    Regardless, The Roots' devastatingly funky show is represented pretty accurately on <i>The
    Roots Come Alive</i>.  The problem with this record is that the group is fairly rugged and
    raw, replete with their live instrumentation, on their proper LPs.  Thus, a live album by The
    Roots adds very little beyond crowd noise and many extra ""y'know what I'm sayin'""s.  The songs
    are more or less faithfully recreated, with highlights being the creative beatboxing and vocal
    scratching that are absent from the originals.  Black Thought continues to be one of the most
    intelligent and skilled MCs in the business, but this is no more apparent here than on their
    prior works.  For the amount of talent ?uestlove has, the beats he throws down are too often
    trite, with a hard snare hit inevitably falling on counts two and four.  He does break it down
    for the people on ""You Got Me"", just as he does on the <i>Things Fall Apart</i> version, but
    such moments are too few and far between.</p><p>
    
    The primary appeal of <i>The Roots Come Alive</i> for fanatics is the inclusion of two new
    studio recordings on the disc, the weaker of which also appears on the soundtrack to <i>The
    Best Man</i>.  (You're about as likely to remember this Taye Diggs classic as you are to
    recall <i>The Wood</i>.)  On ""The Lesson-- Part III"", however, The Roots are in top form,
    offering a promising vision of continued mastery on forthcoming records.  Overall, though,
    a live album should be awfully exceptional in execution or reinvention to garner a high rating,
    regardless of the quality of the original tracks.  As fresh as The Roots can be onstage, this
    performance resembles the majority of other live records on the shelves today-- it's merely
    average when held against the studio material.</p></div>"|6833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6833-the-roots-come-alive/|5.7|Taylor M. Clark

    has been done yet. To avoid a potentially disastrous situation in the future-- which would inevitably involve
    accusations of fraudulence-- I'll fess up now: I didn't grow up on indie rock. I know everyone has had their
    embarrassing early years, but I didn't get into indie rock until the Pixies' <i>Bossanova</i>. After that
    discovery, I backtracked to Fugazi, Big Black and other revelatory bands.  But before I knew it, Nirvana's
    <i>Nevermind</i> had arrived and I was off to boarding school.</p><p>
    
    Nirvana, of course, was the beginning and the end, all at once.  College confined me within ivied brick walls
    that refused entrance to any music that didn't ""jam."" The Internet did not exist then. I was isolated and
    force-fed Phish and the Grateful Dead, among others.  As no one shared my interests, these bands soon fought
    The Pixies and Fugazi for space in my CD player. Then, after graduating, I entered a university with a
    burgeoning indie scene.  Sadly, I was four years behind.  I slaved to catch up.</p><p>
    
    Luckily, I haven't forgotten my roots. The Pixies still sound as fresh as they did back in 1990, and my
    loyalties remain true. Which is why I followed Pixies frontman Black Francis' transformation into Frank
    Black.  His self-titled debut and <i>Teenager of the Year</i> are inarguably brilliant pop records, doused
    with Black's trademark weirdness and originality.  1996's <i>The Cult of Ray</i>, on the other hand, was a
    heinous letdown, and Frank knew he had to change direction.  He did.  His next two albums, <i>Frank Black
    and the Catholics</i> and <i>Pistolero</i>, were strong, straightforward rock 'n' roll records recorded
    live to two-track.  Now, don't take that the wrong way--  I said they were strong, not incredible; one
    wouldn't necessarily want to hear the songs that were left off.</p><p>
<i>Oddballs</i>, though, is a collection of such leftovers-- you know, b-sides and outtakes-- that were
    recorded between 1994 and 1997. These were his less innovative years, so it's no surprise that this record
    is about as dispensable as the plot of <i>Gladiator</i>.  The opening track, ""Pray a Little Faster"", is the
    encapsulation of Frank Black at his weakest, replete with basic chord variations and an unexceptional solo.
    ""Village of the Sun"" (circa <i>The Cult of Ray</i>) is yet another song that opens with hushed vocals over
    buried keyboards.  And the punk opening of ""At the End of the World"" is reminiscent of <i>Teenager of the
    Year</i>'s ""Bad, Wicked World"", yet the song slows for the chorus, apparently so that Black can showcase
    his vocals at their most Dicky Barrett.</p><p>
    
    His lyrics don't help matters, either.  Where Black once effortlessly spewed line after line of unquestionable
    genius, he now resorts to lines like, ""Well, I've been hanging downside-up."" Not quite as eloquently stated
    as, say, ""We go to sleep/ As breathing flows, my mind secedes.""  On ""Hate Me"", he must be joking when he
    screams, guttural as ever, ""Hate me/ My jacket's not right.../ Hate me/ My shirt is shitty."" At least, I
    hope he is.  And if you thought ""I Don't Want to Hurt You (Every Single Time)"" was his corniest song ever,
    meet its contender, ""Can I Get a Witness"", which features the spectacular awakening, ""Maybe you've got faith
    in where this is going/ Maybe I'll pull up the stakes, and I'll be letting go.""</p><p>
    
    As one would expect from a legend, though, there are some redeeming moments.  ""Just a Little"" is a catchy,
    Western guitar-tinged cover of the folk-rock band The Beau Brummels' 1965 track.  The tempo of ""Jumpin'
    Beans"" cleverly befits its title, and its simple poetic phrasing ranks it alongside Frank's best solo work.
    And the title track is another rare gem; ""Odd-balls,"" he chimes during the simple, yet affecting chorus,
    ""Well, everybody's different.""  And even if the music here still isn't up to par with his Pixies days, at
    least it includes lines like, ""Mathematics moves at such a crawl/ And gravity is a-mighty strong.""</p><p>
<i>Oddballs</i> also ends fittingly. The last two minutes of the closer, ""Man of Steel"", a track culled
    from the <i>X-Files</i> soundtrack, <i>Songs in the Key of X</i>, is utterly repetitive, forcing one to

The angel has apparently taken
    a break for now, but it might have said things like, ""No, Billy, you're not Nicky Nosferatu,
    the Cabbage Patch Kid""; ""No, Billy, black leather trenchcoat-dresses do not flatter you"";
    ""No, Billy, working with Flood will not make your records sound good""; and most importantly,
    ""No, Billy, some of those songs are better left in the ProTools wastebasket.""  Somebody needs
    to have line-item veto power over the one-party congress of Corgan's ego.  Over half of the
    Pumpkins' 103 post-<i>Siamese Dream</i> songs could have been cut to make three decent albums.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes I wish you readers could sit on this side of music criticism. It's amusing to see
    how many writers mine bands' official press releases and follow the leader.  The press on
    <i>MACHINA</i> serves as an interesting example.  Nearly every review I've read proclaims the
    new record to be ""a return to form"" or ""a return to their hard rocking days"" or ""the true
    follow-up to <i>Siamese Dream</i>.""  Obviously, they're trying to distance <i>MACHINA</i> from
    <i>Adore</i>, the least successful Pumpkins record to date. The whole thing stinks of PR.</p><p>
<i>MACHINA</i> just sounds like a continuation of <i>Adore</i>.  It's the infinite sadness to
    <i>Adore</i>'s <i>Mellon Collie</i>.  In fact, <i>Adore</i> showcased greater variation, better
    production, and about as much ""rocking.""  Writers keep focusing on Jimmy Chamberlin's return,
    but the venerable Joey Waronker, who played all over <i>Adore</i>, was similarly talented.
    Besides, Chamberlin's overproduced, steady clicking on <i>MACHINA</i> sounds exactly like--
    and might as well be-- a drum machine.</p><p>
    
    Every track on <i>MACHINA</i> sits in a heavy syrup of synthesizer.  Flood deep-fries the sound
    in golden calf fat.  Guitars hiss like hig pressure hoses.  Gelatinous bass issues from the crust
    like pus.  The psoriatic sound comes off like infected yellow scabs growing on fragile frosted
    glass.  If this is a ""return to form,"" Billy Corgan has thrown his baby-head out with the
    bathwater. <i>Siamese Dream</i> never utilized computer and keyboard crutches to such a
    degree.</p><p>
    
    Every generation of kids in black needs a goth martyr, and Billy vies for their troubled hearts
    throughout <i>MACHINA</i>.  Plodding numbers like ""The Crying Tree of Mercury"" and ""Blue Skies
    Bring Tears"" steal liberally from the cemetary-obsessed Cure songs that never seem to make it
    to singles compilations.  Even the albums strongest tracks-- ""Wound"", ""Raindrops + Sunshowers"",
    and the ironically titled ""Try, Try, Try""-- lugubriously cruise along like New Order in a
    crystal convertible flossed out with chrome.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, an ego scud has detonated on Corgan's muse, distributing the gore between the territories
    of 4AD, Windham Hill, Cleopatra, and Elementree.  The result is songs like ""Heavy Metal Machine"",
    a static-drenched dinosaur that slowly shits Soundgarden's ""Rusty Cage"", and the hysterical
    ""Glass and the Ghost Children"", in which Chamberlin pulls his best Neil Peart imitation while
    Corgan and Iha spittle fuzz like Orgy covering Cream's <i>Disraeli Gears</i>.  Midway through
    the ten-minute bulk of ""Ghost Children"", a lone piano interludes while tapes of Corgan
    confessionals crackle on top: ""I always assume that the voice I hear is the voice of God,"" he
    proclaims. ""So I'm operating on the premise that I hear the voice of God."" Atheists rejoice.
    Then, four more minutes of underwater gongs and seagull guitars bring you back down from the
    laughter.  And just to put the official seal on The World's Most Pretentious Stadium Rock Song
    Ever certificate, Corgan finishes with the refrain: ""As she counted the spiders/ As they crawled
    up inside her.""</p><p>
    
    The Pumpkins' fascination with sepia tones, parchment, and God kills whatever joy might otherwise
    be gleaned from their fifth LP.  Filling the entire capacity of a compact disc, <i>MACHINA</i>
    simply blabbers on far too long.  Even grating tracks like ""The Everlasting Gaze"" become
    appreciated for the fact that they at least grate.</p><p>
    
    The problems with Billy Corgan are conveniently packaged in the track ""I of the Mourning"" (note
    the fucking ""u"").  Over reheated new wave pop and fluff-metal that sparks under microwaves,
    Corgan whines through his wax-paper septum, ""Radio/ Play my favourite song/ Radio/ Radio/ Radio/
    I'm alone/ Pick up where my thoughts left off.""  Radio is a commercial-bloated joke. When's the
    last time, Pitchfork reader, you heard your favorite song on the <i>radio</i>?  Who even listens
    to the radio?  Who finds solace in FM?  I mean, shit, what do they even play these days?  Oh.
    The Smashing Pumpkins.</p></div>"|11829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11829-machinathe-machines-of-god/|4.2|Brent DiCrescenzo

On the back, it says ""Manda White House"" in penciled     cursive.  A Spanish style, two stories, vines growing across the railing of the balcony. It     looks like California.</p>
<p>I didn't find this in a scrapbook, an old photo album, or a newspaper clipping. This photograph     was Elmer-glued to the front cover of the new record from the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up. Not printed     on, not drawn on, but glued by hand. For some of you, this may be all you need-- a record so     lo-fi, so DIY, and so indie that the band sat up all night in their garage gluing old Kodaks     to the cover of their record.  But I'm not writing to you-- I'm writing to people like me who     are sick of lo-fi, a sound whose aesthetics take more studio time to perfect than if a band     just sat down and produced the damn album.  People have used cushioned toilet seats as bass     drums.  Nice gimmick, but how does it sound?</p>
<p>The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up would never pull that stunt.  If lo-fi is banging on toilet seats then     this album is a velvet-topped throne.  It's soft and gorgeous-- as opposed to tape hiss and     drenched reverb, these guys pull out clean guitars, restrained beats, rolling bass, and     whispering vocals-- and it could be the soundtrack for the most relaxing bath you've     even taken.  Trust me.  Put away the candles and whale sounds.</p>
<p>But the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up isn't all candlelit baths (or as I call them, Friday nights without     a date). The guys crank it up a notch on songs like ""Harmless Hobby or Bicycle Crash"", a song     with the best build since Slint's ""Washer"".  It opens with the low rumble of a fiery bass and     a fierce staccato guitar line. Three minutes in, the dissonance arrives.  Clashing riffs     culminate into an overwhelming crescendo before Yoshii's voice re-enters the mix, calming     the struggle.</p>
<p>Looking at the cover photograph, it somehow makes sense.  The same way that ""Everybody's Talkin'""     worked so well in <i>Midnight Cowboy</i>.  A slow pan from one window to the next, peering in the     shutters for the forbidden sight of a naked girl as echoing Gibsons climax.  The rhythm matches     the slow turn to the photographer, lovelorn and looking for a way in.  As he makes up his mind,     resolutely walking to the front door, the camera clicks, the record ends, and the uncertainty     begins.</p></div>"|4256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4256-jim-yoshii-pile-up/|8.0|Yancey Strickler

    expect Sonic Youth's <i>Goodbye 20th Century</i> to be the band's cataclysmic
    soundtrack to the Last Times. Failing this vast millenarianism, we might
    at least expect a new <i>Daydream Nation</i> to capture the <i>fin de siecle</i>
    as that earlier album had lent words and noise to the wane of the Reagan
    years.  <i>Goodbye 20th Century</i>, the fourth release in the ""SYR Musical
    Perspectives"" series, is no such thing. In fact, rather than apocalyptic,
    the somber dissonance on <i>Goodbye</i> waxes somewhat elegiac. The album
    offers very little by way of grand proclamations; <i>Goodbye 20th Century</i>
    is very much about listening: listening to the composers, listening to the
    past, listening to one another.</p><p>
    Although much more turbulent than the distant electric storms of the series'
    last release, the ethereal <i>Invito al Cielo</i>, <i>Goodbye 20th Century</i>
    conjures similar alchemies of cacophony and serenity. But the new album has
    less to do with free improv extensions of <i>SYR3</i>. Rather, we hear the band
    (boasting an impressive roster of guests) interpreting the work of past masters.
    Along with more renowned modern composers like John Cage, Steve Reich and Pauline
    Oliveros, Sonic Youth &amp; Co. play pieces by Stockhausen prot√©g√© Cornelius
    Cardrew, experimental violinist Takehisha Kosugi (who performs on the album),
    and atonal-chromaticist James Tenney. Sonic Youth is joined again by Jim
    O'Rourke, along with New York downtown turntablist Christian Marclay, composer
    Christian Wolff (who also contributes a piece), percussionist William Winant,
    and longtime Sonic Youth producer Wharton Tiers.</p><p>
<i>Goodbye 20th Century</i>-- over a hundred minutes in length-- rewards
    the patient, and will confound those fans still holding out for another
    <i>EVOL</i>. But those who criticize the late-90s Sonic Youth for straying
    far from its art-punk, no-wave roots would level criticism at the band
    for trying to pull off another edgy, noisy <i>Sister</i> in the 18th year
    of their career. To their credit, Sonic Youth has not made any last ditch
    attempt to conform to any estimations of what they should be doing.  <i>Goodbye
    20th Century</i> is not a renunciation of their post-punk roots, but rather
    a tribute to those more difficult influences that have always been present
    in their music-- aside from the chosen compositions, one could make out the
    presence of Coltrane, Cecil Taylor and Glenn Branca as well as Varese. Nor
    could one accuse Sonic Youth of parading this wide array of distinguished
    composers and players in front of the listener only to position themselves
    as masters and inheritors of the 20th century new classical tradition. If
    anything, <i>Goodbye 20th Century</i> is an album of humility, displaying
    devotion and awe on the part of the musicians for the sheer possibility
    coded into the compositions.</p><p>
    The half-hour-long interpretation of John Cage's 1992 composition ""Four6""
    stands at the heart of the two-disc set, and best exemplifies the work's
    aesthetic of entwined beauty and monstrosity. Other highlights include ""Six for
    a New Time,"" a piece that Pauline Oliveros composed specifically for the occasion,
    and James Tenney's ""Having Never Written a Note for Percussion,"" an uprising of
    droning guitar under the direction of Jim O'Rourke.</p><p>
    But let's not kid ourselves. <i>Goodbye 20th Century</i> is difficult music:
    music that is not supposed to be enjoyed so much as to be endured. To purchase
    this album is to purchase over an hour-and-a-half of some of the most abrasive
    noise imaginable outside of an industrial factory setting.  And you must find
    what's beautiful. This is perhaps why I have found the SYR series so engaging--
    because the experience of listening to these releases amounts to a considerable
    amount of introspection: you must rethink your categories every minute, you must
    continuously reassess the boundaries of music and noise, structure and disorder.
    But if all you hear is dissonance and feedback and Kim Gordon's hot, ghostly
    musings, you're not listening.</p></div>"|7344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7344-goodbye-20th-century/|8.5|Brent S. Sirota

    sings Eric Bachmann on his eponymous Crooked Fingers album.  It's a line
    that seems less suited for his latest project than a perfect summation of
    his former band, onetime indie-rock heroes Archers of Loaf. Throughout
    their bruised and battered lifespan, it seemed as if the Archers were intent
    on digging their own grave, eschewing the heady guitar squall of <i>Icky
    Mettle</i> for increasingly darker tales of despair and collapse.</p><p>
    
    On their final album, <i>White Trash Heroes</i>, they managed to achieve the
    kind of self-negating, black-hole sonics that few bands besides Nirvana or
    Radiohead have ever reached (or <i>tried</i> to reach). Where before the
    Archers' guitars would ramble and bump into each other with clumsy abandon,
    on <i>White Trash Heroes</i> they were strung with razor wire, wrapping
    lacerating riffs around Bachmann's ruined throat, and hurling the songs
    headlong into the void. You can almost hear the band itself blinking out
    of existence as the searing tones of the last track are cut short in
    mid-flight.</p><p>
    
    Crooked Fingers is the sound of Bachmann finally reaching the bottom of the
    bottomless pit and finding that it isn't such a bad place after all. Despite
    his recurring lyrical themes of drinking, darkness, decay, being broken,
    being set on fire, creeping evil, and more drinking, the music possesses a
    sort of dignified grace, illuminating crumbling and bombed-out neighborhoods
    with a few sepia-toned rays of light. Gone are the Archers' distortion pedals
    and conventional guitar-rock context.  They're replaced by countryish
    fingerpicking, chiming arpeggios, and warm, sweeping strings. It's easily
    the most thoughtful, cohesive work Bachmann has ever recorded.</p><p>
    
    Archers albums were inventive yet haphazard affairs, with one or two tracks
    that felt out of place or were just plain bad; <i>Crooked Fingers</i> is the
    product of a more focused artistic vision, and thus has a welcome
    consistency of tone and quality. Of course, one man's consistency is another
    man's ""repetitive and boring."" And yes, Bachmann does tend to repeat himself
    lyrically, but at least he's rediscovered the time-honored pop-music tradition
    of juxtaposing his depressing lyrics with pretty melodies (a trait noticeably
    lacking from later Archers material-- at least the pretty melodies part).</p><p>
    
    The believability factor of <i>Crooked Fingers</i> might also be an issue for
    some; while we hear Tom Waits' weathered croak of a voice and can imagine that
    he's lived through the songs he's written, the same voice and songs coming from
    an indie rocker like Bachmann are slightly less convincing. Regardless, his
    singing has clearly improved over the years and complements the newfound Mercury
    Rev-like lushness of the music well-- be it his trademark growl on rousing
    beer-hall singalongs like ""New Drink for the Old Drunk"" or a wistful falsetto
    on shimmery ballads such as ""Crowned in Chrome"" and ""Broken Man.""</p><p>
    
    So go ahead, have another drink or three.  Stay up all night wallowing in
    self-pity and disgust. Crooked Fingers understands; Eric Bachmann will be right
    beside you, waiting to greet the crack of dawn with bleary eyes and a mixture of
    disappointment and relief that the rest of the world hasn't yet been destroyed.</p></div>"|1671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1671-crooked-fingers/|8.4|Nick Mirov

Millions of
    Americans stopped eating lunch when that news hit.  After all, Crosby isn't
    exactly the ideal sperm donor.  He's bald, a reformed coke/heroin addict,
    overweight, friends with Graham Nash and Neil Young, not pretty, and really
    old.  The guy is as pure as Bayonne.  (Personally, I'd have gone with Pete
    Sampras or Paul McCartney.)</p><p>
    
    This child will live its life under the constant observation of secondary media.
    And odds are, the kid will eventually end up in music (give it 15 years or so).
    Now, there's a pretty good chance, based on his genealogy, that Junior's rock
    will sound like AM/FM.  Okay, yeah, so that's in no way a great endorsement for
    this album, but hear me out.</p><p>
    
    After Junior goes through that inevitable punk phase-- which will result from
    the emotional turmoil of growing up as celebrity offspring, making headlines
    as an ""Access Hollywood"" lens target, and teenagers' innate reflexes to rebel
    against their parents-- he'll settle down and realize that his dad had it going
    on in the 1960s.  All of these accumulated influences and tastes might meringue
    up into the frothy multi-track folk of <i>Audiot</i>.</p><p>
    
    There's a Byrdsian, tambourine-slapping sincerity throughout this record.  Brian
    Sokel, the brain of AM/FM, normally punches timecards as the guitarist for
    dub-punk Clash revivalists Franklin.  Traces of Franklin's relaxed, spread
    guitar effects trickle into AM/FM, like the scribbling palm-muted guitar and
    above-the-fret plucking under the acoustics in ""The Death They Claim.""</p><p>
    
    Sokel's attention to detail buries subtle perks throughout the EP.  Organs, lap
    steel, backwards effects, treated vocals, tin whistle, and layers of guitars
    blend together into a nice, if not somewhat irresolute, foam.  But AM/FM's quest
    for the ""nice"" leaves them short of pertinence.  Advice: highlight those backward
    swirls, let the guitar solos rip forth from obnoxious red levels, let the guitars
    hide under the organ (not vice versa), and raise your voice above a sighing
    croon.  Of course, these are typical shortcomings on a solo debut, and thankfully,
    Sokel shows enough audiophilic retentiveness to promise greater things.</p><p>
    
    At EP length, <i>Audiot</i> makes a welcome skip through suburban fields.  Even
    the design is fresh and shows some effort outside of an Adobe program.  Yet
    oddly, every photograph is taken with high overhead light, turning Sokel's eyes
    into gaping black sockets.  Throughout the liner notes, not a single eye can be
    seen.  This small shortcoming reflects the songwriting.  Brian, let us look into
    your eyes!</p></div>"|146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/146-audiot-ep/|7.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

That's what I say.  These unfortunate souls-- and I think we all know a     handful-- will never quite grasp what it is that makes the rest of us so     enamored of the work of Pan American's Mark Nelson, and other cinematic     ambient artists.</p>
<p>Patience is a virtue.  The Best Things Come to Those Who Wait.  Ah, which     clich√© shall I evoke next?  Tempting as it may be for Mr. Casual Listener,     as mentioned above, to dismiss music that takes its time to get going, he     does it a great disservice by actually doing so.  Nelson revels in the small     details-- the subtle shifts in texture and sound.</p>
<p>When recording with his creepy Virginian avant-o-mates in Labradford, Nelson     concentrates on instrumental interplay in pieces that are simultaneously     soothingly static and unsettling.  But when left to his solo devices, we find     Pan American notching out the more dub-influenced groove sensibilities that     lingered in some of Labradford's work.  It's been said that Lab-mate Carter     Brown's more typical muso approach to composition tempers Nelson's electronics-     descended leanings.  That argument is given credence here on this second-- and     quite remarkable-- album under Nelson's Pan American moniker.</p>
<p>All manner of vaguely eerie atmospheres abound on this record, yet for     all the surface iciness, there's a beckoning textural warmth that keeps     it from sounding distant.  With headphones, the craft of the sonics is more     readily absorbed-- at wimpy low levels, this stuff would probably be     about as interesting as listening to distant street traffic.  But, as     anyone who's truly had their ass kicked by great music knows, volume gets     results.  Quickly.  Turn this shit up if it isn't rocking your boat, in other     words.  Only then will the lovely clanging and dubby bass of ""Double Rail""     nail all the right places in your little black heart.  At low levels,     guest vocalists Low and backing music on ""Code"" could be mistaken for     some crazy religious radio station with some worrisome repeated chanting.     Up goes the listening level, and you're being grooved along thusly by the     pounding kicks, ringing dub-rhythmic chords and echoed hats and cymbals,     while the rather lovely minor-key chant drills itself into your brain.</p>
<p>Nelson's work here is not too derivative in itself, but traces of artists     like Pole, Global Communication, and the Basic Channel/Chain Reaction     stable are in attendance.  Here and there, Nelson goes on auto-pilot for     a little too long: ""Coastal"" seems a bit too content to ride a vaguely     lovely but ultimately too-featureless pattern to its inevitable end several     minutes later.  Bits of ""K. Luminate"" meander, which is understandable over     the course of a nine or ten minute track.</p>
<p>The addition of Chicago Underground Duo cornetist Rob Mazurek would seem     to be a nice avant touch to the otherwise electronic tracks, but it works     better on paper than on the record.  His playing, while a warm complement     at times, usually sticks out like a sore thumb. It seems particularly forced     into unlikely spots on the closer, ""Both Ends Fixed,"" a track which otherwise     follows another savory recipe of deep bass, echoing percussion, and laidback     chordal repetition.</p>
<p>All in all, chalk up another worthy and fascinating chapter to Kranky's     already formidable post-rock/experimental catalogue.  Come, Mr. Casual     Listener, pray with me and my congregation at the Sonic Altar in the     Church of Studio Wizardry, won't you?  We're a fine bunch, once you get     to know us.</p></div>"|11798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11798-360-business360-bypass/|7.8|Dan Gardopee

It's been said that Lab-mate Carter     Brown's more typical muso approach to composition tempers Nelson's electronics-     descended leanings.  That argument is given credence here on this second-- and     quite remarkable-- album under Nelson's Pan American moniker.</p>
<p>All manner of vaguely eerie atmospheres abound on this record, yet for     all the surface iciness, there's a beckoning textural warmth that keeps     it from sounding distant.  With headphones, the craft of the sonics is more     readily absorbed-- at wimpy low levels, this stuff would probably be     about as interesting as listening to distant street traffic.  But, as     anyone who's truly had their ass kicked by great music knows, volume gets     results.  Quickly.  Turn this shit up if it isn't rocking your boat, in other     words.  Only then will the lovely clanging and dubby bass of ""Double Rail""     nail all the right places in your little black heart.  At low levels,     guest vocalists Low and backing music on ""Code"" could be mistaken for     some crazy religious radio station with some worrisome repeated chanting.     Up goes the listening level, and you're being grooved along thusly by the     pounding kicks, ringing dub-rhythmic chords and echoed hats and cymbals,     while the rather lovely minor-key chant drills itself into your brain.</p>
<p>Nelson's work here is not too derivative in itself, but traces of artists     like Pole, Global Communication, and the Basic Channel/Chain Reaction     stable are in attendance.  Here and there, Nelson goes on auto-pilot for     a little too long: ""Coastal"" seems a bit too content to ride a vaguely     lovely but ultimately too-featureless pattern to its inevitable end several     minutes later.  Bits of ""K. Luminate"" meander, which is understandable over     the course of a nine or ten minute track.</p>
<p>The addition of Chicago Underground Duo cornetist Rob Mazurek would seem     to be a nice avant touch to the otherwise electronic tracks, but it works     better on paper than on the record.  His playing, while a warm complement     at times, usually sticks out like a sore thumb. It seems particularly forced     into unlikely spots on the closer, ""Both Ends Fixed,"" a track which otherwise     follows another savory recipe of deep bass, echoing percussion, and laidback     chordal repetition.</p>
<p>All in all, chalk up another worthy and fascinating chapter to Kranky's     already formidable post-rock/experimental catalogue.  Come, Mr. Casual     Listener, pray with me and my congregation at the Sonic Altar in the     Church of Studio Wizardry, won't you?  We're a fine bunch, once you get     to know us.</p></div>"|11798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11798-360-business360-bypass/|7.8|Dan Gardopee

    ringing distortion, interstellar radio transmissions and bursts of sonic noise
    like crashing tides.  Usually, a delicately-plucked acoustic can be distinguished
    underneath the dense layers of static.  Around 1996, Rachel Brook departed,
    leaving only Dave Pearce to continue the Flying Saucer Attack legacy.  Soon
    after, Pearce released <i>New Lands</i>, an album similar to its predecessors,
    but with no real sign of drive or inspiration.  Surprisingly, just when it
    looked as though Flying Saucer Attack had done all they were capable of,
    the long-awaited <i>Mirror</i> is finally issued, restoring fans' faith in
    Dave Pearce's ability to record original music.</p><p>
    
    From straight out of left field, Flying Saucer Attack present their best
    album since 1995's <i>Further</i>.  Sonically, it's Pearce's most accessible
    and melodic record to date, due largely to the fact that the levels seem to
    be switched-- on most previous outings, atmospheric feedback and buzzing
    dominated the mix while Dave Pearce sang quietly in the background; on
    <i>Mirror</i>, it's quite the opposite.  Here, the songs are the main focus
    (as they should be), and the effects are pushed just below the surface.</p><p>
    
    Songwise, though, Pearce is still riding the same wave.  His somber acoustic
    folk still recalls the gentle melancholy of Nick Drake, but for the first
    time, the melodies and lyrics can actually be clearly deciphered.  Of course,
    the entire album isn't composed of simple folky musings-- that'd be boring!
    Pearce keeps it varied this time around, implementing actual percussion on
    a few of the numbers, and being generally inventive.  Even when songs run
    past the eight minute mark, like the beautiful ""Islands,"" they morph through
    distinct and attention-grabbing phases, beginning sparsely and building into
    spiraling crescendos of drug-addled bliss.</p><p>
    
    And speaking of drugs, how about that packaging?!  Flying Saucer Attack
    albums have always been easily characterized by their vast stretches of
    flatland and other places uninhabited by humans.  When I first saw the
    cover of <i>Mirror</i>, I honestly thought I was looking at a Grateful
    Dead reissue.  And in place of liner notes is a blatantly hallucinogenic
    image of a psychedelic rainbow over a body of water, with creepy mutations
    of animals splashing about, and warped, gloopy flying saucers zooming past
    pink clouds.  In a time when drugs are so revered by the hipster elite,
    it's good to see somebody living it up a little.</p><p>
    
    But the cover art isn't all that's changed for Flying Saucer Attack.  On
    <i>Mirror</i> Pearce experiments with new sounds and genres.  In between
    his standard spacy acoustic numbers, he also jumps on the electronic
    bandwagon (albeit a little late), fusing beats copped from drum-n-bass and
    hip-hop into the latter sections of the album.  Interestingly, the track
    that benefits most noticeably from the newly-incorporated drum tracks is
    ""River,"" which employs a basic rock beat that fuels a rare ethereal,
    distortion-soaked pop song.</p><p>
    
    If you're new to Flying Saucer Attack and are looking for a good
    introduction to their twisted world of mind-bending space-psych, <i>Mirror</i>
    is probably the place to start.  As I said, it's easily the most accessible
    of the bunch.  Of course, <i>Further</i> is still a more cohesive, better-
    orchestrated effort.  You make the call.  I'm just happy the guy's still
    creative.</p></div>"|3124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3124-mirror/|7.5|Ryan Schreiber

Personally, I am never in the mood for egg salad.
    Occasionally, I am in the mood for Stockhausen's <i>Helicopter Quartet</i> (the one where each
    member of a string quartet is aloft in a helicopter and skronking out bizarre musique concrete
    accompanied by the drone and swoop of rotorblades!). I am rarely in the mood for exotica. And
    <i>Stop the Panic</i>, sadly, is an exotica album.  Ugh!</p><p>
    The project all started when electro-acoustic egghead David Toop and veteran pedal steel
    guitarist BJ Cole were yakking on about Les Baxter, Yma Sumac and the other luminaries of
    that 50's bachelor pad sound. Toop had just published his book on the subject and was filled
    with the promise that what Stereolab, Plone, and Broadcast had been achieving with their fusion
    of exotica and Krautrock could also be accomplished in the electronic avant-garde. Toop played
    Cole some Plug discs and Cole decided that Wagon Christ himself, Luke Vibert, was just the
    beatnik he wished to get all gaudy and South Sea Islander with.  Ugh!</p><p>
<i>Stop the Panic</i>, luckily enough, is not geared for a Tiki Hut experience. I'd feared that
    Vibert would churn out 13 versions of that wretched ""Lovely"" track that so marred his <i>Tally
    Ho!</i> record. Though Cole runs through the primer on the Hawaiian glide and the Nashville
    glissando, Vibert's straight-ahead beats cut the cheese to a tolerable minimum.
    </p><p>
    As Cole blithely swoops and curls his pedal steel line on ""Dischordzilla,"" Vibert slams down
    rhythmic slabs like he's trying to crush his collaborator. ""Cheng Phooey"" begins life as a
    low-rumbling 303 line before releasing a venomous burst Polynesian acid. Cole's reaction--
    to use his pedal steel as a machine of avant tonal color, as if wishing to wash away the
    spikes of the bassline. All of this recalls Cole's work with Billie Ray Martin (""4 Ambient
    Tales"") and starkly demonstrates that the pedal steel associations with beach huts and
    Nashville can be rent asunder.
    </p><p>
    The duo pay another quick visit to the Land of Shriekin' N' Hollerin' on ""Watery Glass Planet
    (Part 3)"" and, as with ""Cheng Phooey,"" the pair manage to heighten the gracious beauty of the
    pedal steel guitar by placing it in an atypical setting. There's a palpable watery glassiness
    to Cole's solos and Vibert deftly sets Cole's shimmering lines in just the right subtly spacy
    frame.
    </p><p>
    It's clear that Vibert and Cole haven't jumped on this project as an opportunity to wank
    around. These talented musicians have considered the profound complexities (and negotiated the
    fault lines) inherent in exotica.  So the big pay off of <i>Stop the Panic</i> is that Cole and
    Vibert manage to subvert the genre without shoving its most gangrenous aspects in our faces. It
    was no accident that during the culturally repressed and globally paranoid 1950's, the American
    market became susceptible to sanitized, surreal images of the peoples who lived in steamy,
    aboriginal or Communist climes.  Exotica was the pop culture banalization of the First World
    condescension of Joseph ""The Impenetrable"" Conrad.   It was such a weird time-- I mean, at what
    other point in history would a new design of bathing suit was named in honor of a Pacific atoll
    that had just been cored by the test of a U.S. A-bomb?  Yes, the bikini is a memento of First
    World entitlement.  Wear yours with pride!
    </p><p>
    David Toop understands all the cultural resonances within the exotica genre, and Cole and Vibert
    have listened well to his sherpa-like guidance. <i>Stop the Panic</i>-- I hope-- will be the
    last word on this fusion of the avant-garde and the lei. However, a sinking feeling nags at me,
    and reminds me that the Stormtroopers of Marketing will surely seize this album and demand 
    a truckload of tiki-ready platters from far less conscientious musicians.  In fact, I'd start
    panicking now, if I were you-- but that's just the mood I'm in.

    release the <i>Ode Music</i> EP.  He was probably most concerned with fulfilling the
    New Year's Resolution he seems to have made way back in 1993.  You know the one I'm
    talking about. That year, Will Oldham began competing with such corporate giants as the
    ""Book of the Month Club"" and the ""Fruit of the Month Club"" by unofficially creating the
    ""Will Oldham Release of the Month Club.""  Since then, Oldham has recorded music under
    more monikers than most bands have songs: Palace (Brothers/Music/Songs), Bonnie ""Prince""
    Billy, the Sundowners, Will Oldham and Friends, to name just a few.  He's been true to
    his convictions thus far, sometimes sacrificing quality for quantity, but churning out
    records at a frantic pace nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    The <i>Ode Music</i> EP is a particularly confounding case to examine.  On one hand, you
    can't fault him too much, because he never intended for the album to stand alone--  it was
    composed as an instrumental soundtrack to the Kelly Reichardt film of the same name.  In
    that regard, it succeeds admirably.  I imagine that this music would be quite a pleasant
    addition to any movie with ""Ode"" in the title.  On the other hand, I have to be somewhat
    upset with Oldham.  Somehow, he's managed to get his hands on the first five songs I ever
    wrote for guitar back in High School.  Frankly, I'm a bit embarrassed.  To make matters
    worse, I'm not mentioned anywhere in the liner notes.</p><p>
    
    The five unique songs on <i>Ode Music</i> are so incredibly simple, you may even be
    inclined to believe me upon actually hearing the album.  Allow me to list the chords
    Oldham demonstrates a thorough mastery of on ""Ode #1,"" for example: C#.  Impressive.
    And it's probably just a C with a capo on the first fret, anyway.  What's more, he
    doesn't stop demonstrating this proficiency for almost eight minutes.  And that's not
    even mentioning the two negligibly different reprises of the song which also appear
    on the EP.  <i>Ode Music</i> is like Will Oldham's acoustic guitar version of house
    music: each composition is comprised of one basic short riff in either one or two chords,
    repeated into infinity with almost no variation.  After a minute or so, you tend to
    forget that you're even listening to music at all.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of the music's redundancy, though, it's still quite beautiful in its simplicity.
    <i>Ode Music</i> utilizes not only guitar, but also sparse piano and synthesizer.  After all,
    the primary goal of the record was to create a soothing atmosphere, and you'll never be caught
    off guard while listening to this EP.  Once you've heard the first 15 seconds of each song,
    you've basically heard the entire thing.</p><p>
    
    Despite the sheer volume of material he's issued in recent years, Oldham has managed to
    create a few stunning albums.  <i>I See a Darkness</i>, recorded as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy,
    is such an extraordinary piece of work that I was initially tempted to conveniently forget
    to say much about <i>Ode Music</i> in this review and simply praise <i>Darkness</i> instead.
    After all, there's not much substance behind <i>Ode Music</i> to examine; it's just a whole
    lot of quantity.  But don't despair-- there are still about 50 better Oldham releases out
    there worth scooping up.</p></div>"|5974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5974-ode-music-ep/|5.8|Taylor M. Clark

I highly recommend this activity.  For the most part,
    the Pop Tart is quite a delicious toaster pastry, replete with tasty frosting and sticky
    filling.  But sadly, the Pop Tart is not without its ailments.  The first of these is the
    Crust Problem-- for every delectable, filling-enhanced bite, one must also endure an equal
    number of bites sullied by what is mostly flavorless crust.  The discerning Pop Tart
    enthusiast will go to such lengths as to actually eliminate all crust-only zones before
    attempting the more flavorful middle area.  This is something of a pain.  The second problem
    is the Unnecessary Multiplicity Problem, which is that Pop Tarts are packaged in groups of two.
    In order to maximize freshness, one must eat both at once or risk a stale Pop Tart.  Except in
    rare occasions, the marginal utility of the second Pop Tart is greatly diminished to the point
    of seeming bland, as its consumption is a totally identical experience to the previous Pop
    Tart.</p><p>
    
    The Anniversary's <i>Designing a Nervous Breakdown</i> is quite like a package of 10 Pop
    Tarts; it flourishes and fails in the same capacities.  Upon listening to the first track,
    one is immediately struck by its sugary sweet goodness.  Still, the listener finds himself
    mentally trimming away some of the blander passages in order to more greatly enjoy the really
    good parts, in a fashion similar to the Crust Problem.  The Unnecessary Multiplicity Problem
    also crops up, as every one of the 10 songs is nearly indistinguishable from the last.  Same
    guitar distortion.  Same harmonies.  Same emo lyrics.  Same moog.  Sure, the first song is
    delicious, but after eating virtually the same Pop Tart a few times, they will invariably
    irritate your stomach, no matter how palatable they initially seem.</p><p>
    
    Sonically, the Anniversary is an interesting amalgam of pop styles.  Do you remember
    ""Friends of P"" by the Rentals?  Yes, the one with the ultra-catchy moog riff in the
    chorus that was impossible to banish from your head, as much as it embarrassed you to
    be humming oscillating octaves.  Don't make degrading jokes about that riff around the
    Anniversary-- they won't laugh.  The Anniversary really enjoyed that song.  At least
    enough to include the exact same kind of moog riff in literally every song on
    <i>Designing a Nervous Breakdown</i>.  Add equal parts 80's New Wave and slightly
    derivative punk-ish chord progressions reminiscent of the best moments of early
    Blink 182 (which are not many) and you have the foundation for virtually any Anniversary
    song.  The opening guitar parts for both ""All Things Ordinary"" and ""The D in Detroit"" are
    almost absolutely identical, down to the same chords.  And the two are only one song
    apart.  They could have at least changed key!</p><p>
    
    But despite the obnoxiously prominent similarities between each song on <i>Designing a
    Nervous Breakdown</i>, the format from which they mold the songs is still rather tasty. 
    Much like a savory Pop Tart, I plan to consume the Anniversary again in the future, just
    not in vast quantities at one time.  What a shame that <i>Designing a Nervous Breakdown</i>
    isn't also an excellent source of 7 vitamins and minerals, as its edible colleague is.
    Perhaps it would enhance the appeal of future Anniversary discs if they offered a variety
    pack, hopefully including a ""S'mores"" flavor.  Just an idea.</p></div>"|199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/199-designing-a-nervous-breakdown/|6.8|Taylor M. Clark

Flurries were the
    forecast, but they soon turned to showers, covering the brick walkways that pass between the
    17th century buildings. On this first day of snow-- the first true day of Winter in this
    section of the Atlantic coast in ages-- I sit with the thermostat cranked 85 degrees high,
    listening to the new album from Tara Jane O'Neil.</p><p>
    
    I'm sure some of you recognize this name, and even more recognize such band names as Rodan,
    Retsin, and the Sonora Pine, bands O'Neil has worked with in the past. With flakes easing past
    my window, I feel an affinity for O'Neil and her first true solo album, <i>Peregrine</i>.  But
    not for reasons you may think.</p><p>
    
    According to the liner notes, this entire album-- instrumentation and songwriting-- was recorded
    by Tara in her New York City apartment. A brief outline of the many tools she uses includes
    piano, balla laika, banjo, and thumb piano. This complex arrangement should be an immediate
    red alert to the ambitiousness of the album. While the songs are restrained to the point of
    being timid, a close listen to the album's empty space shows just how aggressive and engaging
    her songwriting can be.</p><p>
    
    O'Neil's voice is strong, propelling lyrics about butterflies, the moon, and childbirth over
    the reverb and ring of electric and acoustic guitars.  Sparingly used double-tracked vocals
    help emphasize themes of lost hope and despair. I realize this may sound obnoxious to some,
    but after two or three listens I began to look forward to lines that made me cringe the first
    time through.</p><p>
    
    Although the volume of the album remains constant, O'Neil moves in many different directions
    stylistically. ""A City in the North"" is reminiscent of the Cowboy Junkies' <i>Trinity Sessions</i>,
    a relaxed piece of melancholy lament. Its companion piece, ""A City in the South,"" however, has
    the tone of a Carter Family waltz on a hungover Sunday morning. ""Asters"" alternates between the
    manic train rhythms of Captain Beefheart and a cowgirl ballad cooed around a campfire.</p><p>
    
    But considering the circumstances around the album, the range of styles feels out of place. The
    problem is not the monstrous sonic differences between Rodan and O'Neil's post-Rodan work. That's
    an issue that most fans of the early 90's Midwest sound have had to deal with (think of King Kong
    or the For Carnation). The problems with <i>Peregrine</i> are the contradictions it creates based
    upon the arrangements that O'Neil chooses.</p><p>
    
    First off, let's talk about the rural tone of an album recorded New York City. This music is
    for summer nights on the back porch shucking corn somewhere in the Midwest, not while begging
    for change in front of a ghetto McDonald's.  Another strange aspect of <i>Peregrine</i> is how
    aggressive the lyrics are in their claustrophobic and intimate content. The subject matter
    of O'Neil's lyrics doesn't usually match the way she sings them, which makes her seem less
    connected, and occasionally, less interested.</p><p>
    
    On the surface, <i>Peregrine</i> is a beautiful album.  ""Sunday Song"" is an absolutely gorgeous
    cut whose acoustic guitars chime under a chorus in which O'Neil's voice is particularly strong.
    On the other hand, there's an adherence to standards of sorts. Whether it's country rock or the
    post-rock wanking of ""Flash Thumb Blues,"" the music serves to keep the meaning on a very basic
    level.</p><p>
    
    The disorientation I felt seeing snow here in eastern Virginia is the same sensation I've had
    trying to examine this album. The conventions that I would expect from Tara Jane O'Neil have
    been pushed to the margins in favor of extreme simplicity.  She's describing gritty, graveled,
    yellow snow, but covers it with a lily white blanket.  And while the surface still looks
    beautiful, the elements underneath prove too cluttered to make a snow angel.</p></div>"|6003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6003-peregrine/|6.2|Yancey Strickler

    world these days.  Every label that's been in existence for more than
    three years seems to have issued at least one.  There are hundreds
    of variations on the theme-- it can be composed of any or all of the
    following: 7""s, rarities, b-sides, greatest hits, live tracks, on-air
    performances, remixes, demos, covers, and even other compilation
    appearances (including soundtracks).  For the most part, these tend to
    be relatively throw-away jumbles of odds-and-ends, and a strictly
    for-the-fan experience.</p><p>
    
    A quick glance at the track listing here proves it's no different for
    Mudhoney's <i>March to Fuzz</i>, a two-disc compilation of greatest
    hits and rarities.  It's no surprise that a package like this is seeing
    release through Sub Pop.  They have to remind people of a time long ago
    when credibility ran rampant through their offices.  Plus, what better
    way to make a crisp dollar than issuing ""the best"" songs of a band's
    career?  After all, it's Sub Pop's early days that made them the official
    label of grunge music and, to this day, one of the wealthiest independents
    on record.</p><p>
    
    After the extremely timely passing of grunge, Sub Pop managed to sustain
    their fanbase by releasing critically-acclaimed records by Five Style,
    Sebadoh, the Spinanes, Sunny Day Real Estate, and more debatably, Damien
    Jurado, Looper, and Eric Matthews.  But now, as the label's second wave of
    esteemed bands die off, Sub Pop has to attempt self-resurrection a third
    time.</p><p>
    
    It's easy to see how a reissue of Mudhoney's best songs correlates with
    the type of stuff Sub Pop is releasing these days.  Some of their newest
    signings-- bands like Nebula, the Go, Gluecifer, and the Hellacopters--
    are more similar to grunge than 90% of the Seattle label's recent output.
    If Sub Pop is trying to make a return to their roots, why not celebrate
    their existence with new comps of their baddest-ass bad-ass bands?  We've
    already received the best-of treatment from both the Reverend Horton Heat
    and the Supersuckers.</p><p>
    
    Mudhoney weren't drastically different from their contemporaries, and
    perhaps for this reason, these guys are the defining sound of grunge (next
    to Nirvana, of course).  They could sound like Soundgarden, Nirvana, Mother
    Love Bone, Hole, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Green River, Screaming Trees,
    and-- sorry, guys-- Temple of the Dog.  With their several good records
    (<i>Superfuzz Bigmuff</i>, <i>Mudhoney</i>, <i>Every Good Boy Deserves
    Fudge</i>, and <i>Piece of Cake</i>) and more recent mediocre-to-bad ones
    (<i>Five Dollar Bob's Mock Cooter Stew</i>, <i>My Brother the Cow</i>, and
    1998's <i>Tomorrow Hit Today</i>), Mudhoney were responsible for much of
    the way grunge sounded.  They had an album out on Sub Pop even before
    Nirvana.</p><p>
    
    Like most bands of their ilk, these guys drew their sound most directly from
    the Stooges and Black Sabbath.  They've got Mark Arm's growling, snotty,
    angstful vocals, the aggressive drum fills at the end of every measure, the
    heavily distorted Hendrix-inspired roar of guitars, and the omnipresent thick,
    muddy bass.  But they'll probably always be best known for their anthems,
    ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" and ""Suck You Dry"" more than they will for any of their
    complete albums.</p><p>
    
    Naturally, the anthems are included on <i>March to Fuzz</i>, as are a
    staggering 50 other songs.  Yep, this disc has it all-- a few cuts from
    their prime, and more embarrassing stuff off their later records.  In short,
    you get Mudhoney's best moments with a bunch of filler.  And that's just the
    first disc!  The second features practically every song the band never released
    on their albums, and for the most part, it's pretty evident why.  There's
    virtually nothing of worth on the second disc unless you're diehard Mudhoney
    completist, in which case you've probably already got this stuff.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's impossible to overlook the fact that <i>March to Fuzz</i>
    stumbles into the same pitfall that so many previous ""best of"" packages before
    it have been laid to rest in: if you want an introduction to an album-oriented
    band like Mudhoney, you're probably going to be better off listening to...
    one of their albums!  Even with Sub Pop's added ""bonus disc"" incentive,
    <i>March to Fuzz</i> isn't a spectacular deal compared to the equally-priced
    Mudhoney classic <i>Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge</i>.</p></div>"|5494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5494-march-to-fuzz/|7.5|Ryan Schreiber

    taking, I became suddenly convinced that my airplane luck had finally run out.  Over the
    past 20 years, I've enjoyed what I view as an unprecedented streak of not dying brutally
    in a cataclysmic fireball sent at high rates of speed from the ominous skies above.  Nor has
    my entire body been sucked through a little airplane window and dropped headfirst onto
    jagged rocks from a height of 35,000 feet.  Hell, I haven't even been violently flung
    against the ceiling by abrupt turbulence.  It's been all too easy for me in terms of
    airplane travel.</p><p>
    
    So, as my girlfriend drove me to the airport, completely unaware of my impending demise,
    I decided to soothe my jangled nerves by putting on the Kingsbury Manx's eponymous debut.
    Amazingly, it helped.  Sweeping folk tones mediated the struggle between my overactive brain
    and taxed nervous system.  Serene vocals calmed, saying: ""Taylor, once you set foot on a plane,
    your actual chances of death are around 1 in 7 million.  Relax. You are 4 times more likely to
    be killed by lightning than in a plane accident.  Let us ease your preposterously troubled
    mind.""  Of course, they were actually saying something much more artful and appropriate than
    that, but the overall effect was roughly the same.</p><p>
    
    The Kingsbury Manx do not craft songs that will stun you with their ingenuity and proficiency. 
    Rather, the album recalls a tranquil mountain lake scene: they're peaceful and beautiful,
    sometimes even unique, but they so resemble other similar scenes that they seem a bit common.
    Songs like ""Pageant Square"" and ""Piss Diary"" offer a pronounced soft folk vibe that is both
    gorgeous and soothing in its simplicity.  Steadily-picked guitars and light drums comprise the
    delicate setting in which ethereal vocals blossom slowly.  Occasional strings and ambient 
    synthesized sounds pepper many of the tracks, lending the music an almost New Age feel.  This
    isn't meant in the pejorative John Teshian sense, but instead in the sense that the Kingsbury
    Manx capture the broad, gentle tones inherent to that much maligned genre and meld them with
    mild folk instrumentation and mentality.</p><p>
    
    The effect of this hybrid isn't quite stunning, but makes for a peaceful listen that's active
    and engaging enough to hold attention.  The band also sporadically produces a track like ""Cross
    Your Eyes"" that inspires a bit of bodily movement, but <i>The Kingsbury Manx</i> is mostly
    comprised of placid gems like ""How Cruel"" that meander into the sunset at a leisurely pace.
    It's a record that doesn't set out to dizzy listeners with a focused sonic punch, but rather
    comforts and tranquilizes them with calm, golden tones.  In this manner, the Kingsbury Manx
    have succeeded at creating a very nice, listenable record that won't bowl you over with glee
    but could entrench itself in your playlist over time.</p><p>
    
    So, I credit the Kingsbury Manx with preventing harm to myself to the degree that they
    eased me into a state where I wouldn't try to claw my way out of the plane (or airborne
    death trap as I was calling it) in mid-flight.  Unfortunately, the Kingsbury Manx couldn't
    hinder Northwest Airlines from sending my bags to Detroit and finally getting them to me
    at 5:00am the next morning, but I'm hoping that sort of thing will be covered on their next
    record.</p></div>"|4452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4452-kingsbury-manx/|7.0|Taylor M. Clark

    1. The only color represented on either the cover art or the CD itself is a
    particularly melancholy shade of blue. The disc itself has no writing or 
    identifying marks on it at all, save for its blueness.</p><p>
    
    2. The seventh song on <i>Chappaquiddick Skyline</i> is entitled ""Theme to
    an Endless Bummer.""  This could just as well have been the album title.</p><p>
    
    3. The first words out of Joe Pernice's mouth on the opening track, ""Everyone
    Else is Evolving"" are: ""I hate my life.""</p><p>
    
    Yes, this is the latest installment of Joe Pernice's terminally-depressed
    orchestral pop musings, and as if you haven't already gathered, this album
    is a <i>downer</i>.  Someone needs to give this guy a hug before he jumps
    off a building.</p><p>
    
    You might have thought that the Pernice Brothers' <i>Overcome by Happiness</i>
    was in need of a good dose of Prozac, but that disc is positively sunny in
    disposition compared to this latest effort. And the fact is, Pernice
    definitely knows what he's doing-- these songs'll tug at your heartstrings
    as impatiently as any sad song ever penned.  However, some problems arise here.</p><p>
    
    Pernice's past efforts-- whether with the Pernice Brothers (the lineup of which
    is virtually the same as Chappaquiddick Skyline, minus Joe's brother Bob), or
    his first group, the underrated Scud Mountain Boys-- have always included at
    least a few up-tempo tracks to alleviate the gloom.  Not so here.  And it
    wouldn't even be so bad, except that the album is also sadly lacking in
    Pernice's beautiful ethereal vocal melodies, which graced <i>Overwhelmed by
    Happiness</i> so plentifully.</p><p>
    
    With the exception of the cover of New Order's ""Leave Me Alone,"" every song
    on <i>Chappaquiddick Skyline</i> drags its feet.  Too many of these songs float
    by on nothing more than a breathy Pernice vocal and a chiming guitar progression. 
    This lends the album a breezy, nonchalant air, but it also leaves the listener
    precious little to sink teeth into.  Tracks like ""The Two of You Sleep"" and
    ""Knights of the Night Volume 1"" sound like half-baked demos. It doesn't help
    that Pernice's vocal style is so deliberate that you can practically see him 
    enunciating each word.  Sadness and pain resonate in his voice, but it's almost
    as if that he's so bummed that he feels like he can't afford to let a little
    personality show through.</p><p>
    
    On a more positive note, there are a few songs here that replicate the standard
    Pernice formula with quite a bit of success. ""Courage Up"" and ""Hundred Dollar
    Pocket"" are both examples of Pernice at his best-- lilting melodies, beautiful
    arrangements and thoughtful (if still pretty depressing) lyrics. However, that
    the most successful track here is a cover of a New Order song doesn't lend much
    to Joe's credibility.</p><p>
    
    It's unclear whether Pernice has shelved the Pernice Brothers moniker in favor
    of Chappaquiddick Skyline, or if this is just a side project that utilizes many 
    of the same players he usually works with.  If the side project scenario is
    accurate, he can certainly be forgiven this slight misstep. After all, if this
    disc had been recorded by a no-name with no previous recordings to judge by, I
    would probably be much more forgiving in my judgment.  However, on this release,
    Pernice doesn't quite live up to his legacy, and what I and many others know he's
    eminently capable of.  Here's hoping he's feeling a touch more motivated next
    time around.</p></div>"|1399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1399-chappaquiddick-skyline/|6.0|Jeremy Schneyer

    ""The ______s"" releases an album called <i>For Nick Cater</i>. It's just a
    matter of time until an indie rock collective devoted to resurrecting the
    sound of Led Zeppelin arises in Olympia, Athens or D.C. It's just a matter
    of time before Superchunk releases an album with ""keyboards and loops and
    stuff."" It's only a matter of time before Dan Fogelberg is somehow dubbed
    a misunderstood genius in Chicago's avant-pop circles.  Rock music has sunk
    to some pretty low levels recently.</p><p>
    
    But lately, I've experienced a little metanoia; the thin jaded layers that
    built up in 1999 have flaked away. Chalk those layers up to loitering in
    the grime of mid-20's doldrums. I'm just in love with music. This is why
    I eat hotdogs and oatmeal and type until 4:00am instead of cutting up
    cadavers at Emory.  And what sort of angel-driven crane has pulled me up
    from the quagmires, you ask? A handful of bands. One of which, of course,
    is Modest Mouse.</p><p>
    
    I've listened to Modest Mouse grow progressively better and more profound
    since their 1996 debut, <i>This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing
    to Think About</i>. I read Pitchfork's official ""weirdest interview ever""
    with Modest Mouse before I was even on the staff. I've witnessed Isaac
    Brock scream into his guitar pickups inside a packed bar in Atlanta while
    my then-girlfriend got sick and fainted. But it wasn't until <i>Building
    Nothing Out of Something</i> slipped into my possession that I became
    convinced that Modest Mouse, strangely, might be saviors.</p><p>
    
    Not that <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i> wasn't amazing. It was just a
    tad overlong, and the climate has worsened in those couple of short years
    since.  Here's a band for us to wave at the UK and sneer, ""Haha, you don't
    have this!""  For Modest Mouse are inherently and inseparably American.
    Isaac Brock's brain is fed through the umbilical of strip malls, religion,
    blues, prairies, automobiles, and dysfunction. The trio is bare, raw,
    howling, and beautiful.</p><p>
    
    There's always been a visceral thrill in rock's revolutionaries that
    comes from a twinge of danger. In Modest Mouse, this danger stems from a
    sense of rural dementia-- the sort of fear Flannery O'Connor and James
    Dickey would love to mill. The roar of punk splashes against the melancholy
    of roots music. There are trailers in Modest Mouse's past, and likely their
    future.</p><p>
    
    Though <i>Building Nothing Out of Something</i> merely compiles old singles
    and rarities, it might be the best Modest Mouse release for newcomers'
    initiation, as well as instant gratification for long time fans. This batch
    of songs is easily their most varied. ""Never Ending Math Equation"" tick-tocks
    to a screeching turntable crescendo. ""Medication"" floats a slow, crystalline
    guitar line over muted field recordings of traffic, foghorns, and railroad
    bells before trotting into an acoustic coda with blithe organs.  The most
    beautiful near-seven minutes of Modest Mouse's career rumbles throughout
    ""Workin' on Leavin' the Livin'""-- a psychedelic testimonial to the afterlife.
    ""Sleepwalkin'"" mines the 1950s ballad of the same name, but sets the affair
    in an underwater chamber of whale-call guitars and aching melodies. And a
    suitable meltdown climaxes in the closer, ""Other People's Lives,"" when Brock
    treats his guitar like solder.</p><p>
    
    Yet what truly bowls me over is the savant-like lucidity in Brock's pinpoint
    prose.  Most people in their young 20s can't nail the malaise, prayers,
    frustrations, and joys of life.  The record opens with the brilliant lines,
    ""I'm the same/ As I was when I was six years old/ And oh my god I feel so
    damn old/ But do I really feel anything?"" Brock may look like a gas station
    employee but he rambles off quips like, ""The universe works on a math equation
    that never really ever even ever is in it and/ Infinity spirals out creation.""
    One doesn't normally expect metaphysics from a lumberjack rock band.  And
    this line comes from the same song.</p><p>
    
    Everything is delivered with utmost sincerity, is perfectly phrased, and
    drips with emotion.  As Ryan observed, ""Anyone else would put those lyrics
    on top of mopey minor chords."" Anyone else would simply fail if they tried
    this. Terse, original observations are delivered throughout. ""Workin' on
    Leavin' the Livin'"" refrains the lament: ""In heaven everything is fine/ In
    heaven everything's alright.""  This only works for the fact that Brock
    sounds ready to die over guitars that cry and shimmer.</p><p>
    
    An undercurrent of honesty, and the juxtapositions and surprises are what
    make Modest Mouse.  Forget the fact they have the name of a 1970s Oxford
    prog band.  This band, one of the few truly original voices in modern rock
    music, grants me visions of a near-future where their major label debut
    strikes that new, long-awaited revolution. And in 2001, I want to hear
    people asking, ""Who's going to be the next Modest Mouse?""</p></div>"|5361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5361-building-nothing-out-of-something/|8.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

Their formula
    isn't difficult to figure out-- herculean, face-punching bass, meatgrinding guitars,
    lumber-and-cement drums, and a reckless, penis-exposing singer who gargles the microphone.
    (Though, some Jersey kids in Rye Coalition have almost cracked the code.)</p><p>
    
    The absense of cacophonous, piss-drinking, steel-chewing rock sums up the current climate.
    Young musicians seem hesitant to frighten and discomfort.  The grail of indie rock these days
    is an erasable hook, odd time signatures, and/or trembling beauty.  The Jesus Lizard wanted
    to chisel bone and blister tissue.  Even in Chicago, the birthplace of this rusty genre, the
    sound seems to have died out with Lustre King.  Yet loud, obnoxious music rules the charts
    these days.  The Jesus Lizard never slapped their bass.  They never wore warm-ups.  There
    was no DJ.  David Yow never rapped.  The guys were certainly loud and obnoxious, practically
    threatening, but there was a visceral charge in listening to their titanic pulse-- their sheer
    volume majestic.</p><p>
    
    Nestled between the Fall's growling stomp and Shellac's akimbo attack, the Jesus Lizard earned
    the reputation of ""the best live band.""  This was due mostly to belligerence and precision.
    Mac McNeilly summoned John Bonham, treating each drum like the DEA treats a crackhouse door.
    David Wm. Sims needed one E-string and a pick to put tremble in your duodonem.  Duane Denison
    cauterized the damage with guitar.  Their simplicity allowed room for attitude.</p><p>
<i>Bang</i>, a loose-ends collection of 7""s and compilation tracks, contains several live
    tracks.  While not as imposing as their previous live album, <i>Show</i>, they nonetheless
    only hint at the power.  There's little difference between live and studio versions, as Steve
    Albini essentially perfectly put the sweat and gristle to analog tape.  Lizard classics like
    ""Gladiator,"" ""Killer McHann,"" and ""Seasick"" sear in these live versions.  Rare treats such as
    the two Trio covers demonstrate the band's sense of humor and pop/new-wave affections.
    Fortunately, neither of these songs are ""Da Da Da.""</p><p>
    
    For those unfamiliar with the band's body of work, <i>Bang</i> offers their best songs from the
    pre-Capitol days with a mix of live and studio versions.  It's essentially like <i>Show</i>
    packaged with a greatest hits.  Which makes it pretty inessential for pre-ordained fans.  But
    something tells me the 2000 release of <i>Bang</i> serves only to remind and recruit in the
    new decade.  No arguments here.  The Jesus Lizard were one of the loudest, tightest, toughest
    rock bands ever.  They were the Stooges of the 90's.  And we don't have to worry about David
    Yow making solo albums like <i>Avenue B</i>.</p></div>"|4246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4246-bang/|7.3|Brent DiCrescenzo

    song.  Whether this was due to a lack of appropriate music or a lack of
    appropriate kissers in my life I don't care to speculate, the point being
    that in 1999 things finally came together for me.  The song was Songs:
    Ohia's ""Captain Badass,"" and despite its decidedly unromantic title, the
    pairing of Jason Molina's solemn vocals with guest Edith Frost's sultry
    ones was strangely affecting.  Molina managed the challenging task of
    penning heartfelt, desperation-tinged lyrics with a dignity rarely
    witnessed in modern indie rock.</p><p>
    
    Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not an emo fan, and Songs: Ohia are not an
    emo band.  Jason Molina may be more sincere than most, but he's more a
    musical peer of Will Oldham and Manishevitz than the Gloria Record.
    Songs: Ohia records are composed of melancholy acoustic ballads fusing
    folk and country, and while Molina doesn't shy away from writing about
    love, his aren't songs that could be subtitled, ""How I Felt When the
    Second Girlfriend in a Row Left Me for a Member of Hot Water Music.""</p><p>
    
    Aided this time around by members of Arab Strap and Appendix Out, Molina
    has crafted a more subtle and consistent record.  ""Tigress,"" ""Coxcomb Red""
    and the album's title track each come close to achieving the status I've
    granted to ""Captain Badass.""  And it may be that the only thing preventing
    me from fully embracing these songs is the stereotype of the predatory
    woman that runs theme-like throughout them.</p><p>
    
    At any rate, Molina's songwriting here is much stronger than on last
    year's <i>Axxess and Ace</i>, but he's abandoned some of the guests who
    helped make the album so affecting when he opted to record in Scotland,
    rather than the U.S.  Edith Frost's absence is felt most notably, since
    her vocals added a compelling counterpoint to Molina's somber delivery.
    Appendix Out are, on the whole, probably better suited to the Songs: Ohia
    style, but some of the freshness and novelty of the live <i>Axxess</i>
    sessions, recorded with collaborators Michael Krassner and David Pavkovic
    of Boxhead Ensemble are lost, making <i>The Lioness</i> a decidedly more
    resigned and less passionate affair.</p><p>
    
    So despite hot lyrics like, ""And I wanted that heat so bad/ I could taste
    the fire on your breath,"" Songs: Ohia will not claim the dubious honor of
    my make-out artist of the year twice in a row.  It's nothing personal; 2000
    just hasn't found me requiring that tinge of desperation.</p></div>"|7334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7334-the-lioness/|7.6|Meg Zamula

    sound. In jazz, Blue Note was known for the funky hard-bop of Art Blakey
    and Horace Silver, while Impulse! cultivated a roster of avant-garde
    explorers like John and Alice Coltrane and Archie Shepp.  In the indie
    rock universe, those who buy something on K or Kill Rock Stars can usually
    depend on hearing some amateurish post-punk, while Kranky remains the
    home of ambient dreamers. But Perishable, the label begun initially to
    release Red Red Meat's debut album, is developing two identities: a
    clearing house for the rhythm experiments of the Chicago instrumental
    scene (Him, Drumhead, Out in Worship) and the keepers of the pawnshop
    folk-blues flame, as previously burned by oRSo, Loftus, and now Sin
    Ropas.</p><p>
    
    That Sin Ropas sounds like a Red Red Meat side project-- complete with
    outdated drone machines, banjos, acoustic guitars and abrasive
    percussion-- is no surprise: it's essentially the work of RRM's Tim
    Hurley.  Hurley has always been the second songwriter in Red Red Meat.
    He contributed ""Airstream Driver"" to <i>There's a Star Above the Manger
    Tonight</i>, and sang a couple of songs on the Loftus record.  And he's
    always been more about mood than melody.  Indeed, while few of these
    compositions would hold up well if separated from the complicated
    production that characterizes the work of this collective, they still
    hit with all the impact of a shovel to the face, due to a Hurley's talent
    for instrumental nuance and shading.</p><p>
    
    Hurley's grizzled voice (which bears a passing resemblance to an
    exhausted Neil Young) lacks depth of expression, but holds a certain
    downcast sincerity that suits these songs well.  And in the end, this
    album seems to be about the finished recording, anyway-- you won't be
    humming the tune to ""Snakes in Shoes,"" but you'll remember the bouncy
    slap of the snare drum.</p><p>
    
    A few of these tracks are instrumental, including the almost Calexico-like
    ""I Found Your Teeth."" It combines wonderfully controlled guitar feedback,
    melodica and upright bass to conjure a vivid scene of some booze-ravaged
    hero prowling the warehouses down by the wharf, in search of a beautiful
    woman best forgotten.  From the tender metallic drone of ""You'll Take the
    Knife Out"" to the spacy, down-the-hole weirdness of ""Rabbit Dream,"" this

    player.  It was the first time I'd ever seen such niceties.  I remember that the 8-track deck
    came with a tape bearing the elegant title <i>Oldsmobile</i>, which compiled songs that were
    popular on AM radio at the time. There was ""The Theme from 'M*A*S*H,'"" a Gordon Lightfoot tune,
    B.J. Thomas' rendition of ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,"" something by Earth, Wind and
    Fire, and, I believe, a track by Dionne Warwick.  My memories of styling in that gas-guzzling
    Cutlass, listening to that <i>Oldsmobile</i> comp, are some of my earliest and best. I'd kill
    for a copy of that 8-track now, just to hear those tunes laid out in order.  Of course, it'd
    be impossible to track down something so obscure.  But now, thanks to Arling and Cameron, I
    don't have to.</p><p>
    
    This <i>is</i> that <i>Oldsmobile</i> tape, remade by a couple of Dutch clowns in their own
    image. It veers from late 60's cabaret to disco to easy listening to lounge-- a retro blend
    which admittedly is not very original at this stage in the game.  But through a combination of
    Arling and Cameron's sharp studio skills, their sure feel for genre, and most importantly, an
    unfailing sense of humor, these two manage, somehow, to make the zillionth such retro LP sound
    fun and cool.</p><p>
    
    Though Arling and Cameron are a duo, they bring an army of collaborators into the studio, from
    crack session musicians to singers of every stylistic and linguistic stripe. ""Le Flit Et La 
    Fillie"" opens the album with a Continental go-go theme, ""W.E.E.K.E.N.D."" is a hilarious (and
    impressively accurate) homage to easy listening, with a man and a woman harmonizing on the
    virtues of each day of the week (and spelling out the chorus in a goofy Dutch accent). ""Hashi"" 
    is a spy theme tribute to a drug-sniffing canine, another witty cut that includes echoing dog
    barks in a parody of dub style. ""Let's Get Together"" is a spot-on blend of house and disco that
    could've been recorded in 1980 if the engineers of yesteryear had a studio setup this
    sophisticated.</p><p>
    
    And so it goes for the 14 remarkably consistent but, naturally, far from groundbreaking songs
    on this strong collection; <i>Music for Imaginary Films</i> is retro music with tasteful modern
    flourishes and a good sense of fun.  Now all I need is to track down a '70 Cutlass...</p></div>"|286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/286-music-for-imaginary-films/|7.2|Mark Richard-San

The Hippie thought I'd
    strained something, but I knew it was Goldie. As <i>INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass</i>
    piped through my speakers and 'phones, I began to think of another album-- <i>Urbal Beats
    2</i>.</p><p>
    
    Y'see, 1998's <i>UB2</i> was a double-disc compilation of skillfully DJ'd tracks that served a
    higher purpose. Disc One was nu-skool, fresh hits and Disc Two brought back some fat-ass gems
    from the vault, again proving that old techno isn't necessarily bad techno. <i>INCredible Sound
    of Drum-n-Bass</i> works on a similar premise-- <i>Spectrum</i> (Disc One), splits drum-n-bass
    into a wide range of colors ranging on the new side, most tracks coming from '97 to '99.
    Goldie's Metalheadz label is represented heavily-- tracks by Alex Reece, Doc Scott and Codename
    John give way to acid-jazzy compositions like Digital's ""Space Funk.""  It's comprised of tight,
    well-chosen tracks that stretch boundaries instead of pants.</p><p>
<i>INCredible</i>'s second disc, <i>Retro</i>, recalls the Disc Two of <i>UB2</i>.  It's
    largely composed of older tracks that sound, frankly, like a walk down memory lane. I remember
    back in the day when ""Terminator"" was on all the floors. Used to be, you could got a pill for
    just $10 bucks back then, but half'd kill ya.  In any case, even if you haven't necessarily heard
    all of these tracks in this mutation, you've likely heard pieces of them sampled on other songs.
    Goldie contributes not only 1993's ""Terminator"" but 1994's ""Manslaughter.""  He also brings Neil
    Trix, Optical, J Majik, Source Direct and Matrix, mixing house-fun sensibility with live
    drum-n-bass intensity to pleasing effect.  But as with <i>UB2</i>, the older sounds almost 
    surpass the newer material-- the hindsight of a couple of years provide clarity for Goldie's
    vision.</p><p>
    
    In short, <i>INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass</i> is for the following people:</p><p>
<li> Old people trying to fit into their baggy pants<br/>
<li> Pacifier-suckers whose teeth have fallen out<br/>
<li> Youngsters that are curious about ""the old days"" but want a disc of new stuff, too<br/>
<li> The bi-curious: those willing to try drum-n-bass, but frightened of the ""harsh stuff""<br/>
<li> Worshipers of the Metalheadz crew, Goldie, and the jungle/techstep way<p>
    
    It is <i>not</i> for the following people:</p><p>
<li> Your mom<br/>
<li> The lady downstairs whose breath stinks of cigarettes and coffee<br/>
<li> People in search of relaxation<br/>
<li> Swing dancers<br/>
<li> Baba booey<p>
    
    That's it. Move along. Nothing to see here.</p></li></li></li></li></li></p></li></li></li></li></li></p></div>"|3509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3509-incredible-sound-of-drum-n-bass/|7.3|James P. Wisdom

    Show.""  Rather questionable marketing decisions lurk behind that.  Should we slip 'n' slide or
    witness a desperate DePaul drama grad carry the zero?  ""The Homework Show"" is like showing
    <i>Die Hard 2</i> on a flight to Dulles.  It's like a rib joint in the West Bank.  It's like
    Arab on Radar in your ears.</p><p>
    
    While they've successfully nudged the guitar a few steps closer to dentistry tools, Arab on
    Radar pound on the same bathroom-stall joke for 19 minutes on <i>Soak the Saddle</i>.  The
    opening track chugs away like a Brainiac knock-off in a combine, only it's recorded with
    microphones made of a tin cans and yarn.  The result is neither menacing or powerful.  Crusty
    drums jackhammer.  Guitars whistle like tea is ready.  It's shrill and calculated.</p><p>
    
    Though it may be considered punk in some circles to aggravate the listener, it's pretty unpunk
    to charge people money for it.  This relentless grind and screech could suffice as passable
    garage scrape-core if coupled with an intelligent, provoking singer.  Sadly, the enigmatic Arab
    on Radar seemingly employs a congested Jon Lovitz reading the men's room graffiti in Bard's 
    student union.</p><p>
    
    ""Nice girls don't soak the saddle/ Judy Garland doesn't use tampons,"" the knob whines. ""Hard-ons
    for home runs/ Hard-ons are unamerican.""  Each slogan is spat with such uninspired contempt that
    the tone is difficult to discern.  Is ""the quality of bedwetting is conflict"" humor?  Is ""his
    nuts inflate like a blowfish"" a mockery of modern <i>Maxim</i> masculinity?  Probably not when
    backed with a line like, ""Have you ever seen a teenager with a package quite like that?""  Potty
    humor it is, then. Let's not discuss the homosexual shower rape song.</p><p>
    
    To make it ""art,"" Arab on Radar title their songs ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.""  And in further attempts
    to be difficult, the tracks are sequenced in a different order!  Brilliant!  Bands like the
    Jesus Lizard and U.S. Maple have already done this with sincerity.  Orifice obsession and trashy
    noise may get you big in Rhode Island, but those unrelated to the band will be unimpressed at best.
    Perhaps parents can get their tots in front of the set for ""The Homework Show"" by threatening
    them with <i>Soak the Saddle</i> on repeat.</p></div>"|268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/268-soak-the-saddle/|2.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

    who focus on sound. The former are willing to accept sub-par instrumentation
    for the sake of strong lyricism, while the latter are willing to ignore poor
    lyrics, so long as they're accompanied by strong instrumentation. From <i>The
    Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</i> to <i>Kid A</i>, this has been a major source of
    division in the music world.</p><p>
    This, of course, is one of music criticism's worst myths, perpetuated no doubt
    by fans of Maya Angelou. But let's pretend, for the sake of this review, that
    the myth is true. Then For Stars are for all you ""sound"" people. During the
    opener, ""At the End of the World,"" you'll notice an innocent acoustic guitar,
    tentative percussion that includes a maraca, and a subtle glockenspiel. It's
    all very nice-- too consciously nice, in fact. But then frontman Carlos Forster
    and a set of more feminine pipes join together for the opening lines: ""At the
    end of the world/ I am yours, you are mine/ When the walls come caving in/
    I am yours, you are mine."" ""Lyrics"" people worldwide are using Dylan for
    cotton balls, while ""sound"" people are rocking back and forth in feigned
    ignorance.</p><p>
    The rest of this five-song EP-- a collection of outtakes from the band's first
    two U.S. albums-- is more of the same: a quaint indie-folk band stuck in Frisco
    circa Scott McKenzie's suggestion to hippie pilgrims that they ""be sure to
    wear some flowers in [their] hair.""  If I were a ""sound"" person, I'd invoke
    rainy days or summer's twilight. I might even use words like ""bittersweet"" and
    ""heartfelt."" But I must be a ""lyrics"" person, because I can't help but point
    out the revelatory chorus of the next track, ""Brown Skin Saint"": ""We have
    dreams, they make us laugh/ We have guns, they make us cry/ We have cars, we'll
    get there fast/ We have airplanes, for the sky."" And sung in a whiny falsetto,
    even!</p><p>
    The one true bright spot on <i>Airline People</i> is ""The Racecar Driving
    Scene,"" where the Belle and Sebastian influence is, as opposed to the other
    tracks, more palpable in the lyrics than the music. ""I got involved with the
    racecar driving scene/ We'd act like heroes, and smell like gasoline,"" sings
    Forster, the more subdued vocal route serving him well. Over the course of
    4\xBD minutes, the song builds into a crescendo of distorted guitars and roused
    drums that signals an awakening-- literally-- of band and listener alike. But
    even this song raises the question: why does it takes five guys to make music
    this sparse and simple?</p><p>
    No one may ever know why, but here's a question you should be able to answer:
    are you a ""lyrics"" person or a ""sound"" person?  Don't know?  Here's how you
    can tell:  if you've found the horrible pun in their name, then you're the
    former; if you haven't, then maybe For Stars are <i>four</i> you.</p></div>"|3152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3152-airline-people-ep/|4.9|Ryan Kearney

Just ask Vanilla Ice.  When he ""sampled"" the bassline     from Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure,"" he was faced with a     multi-million dollar lawsuit, rather than a complementary napkin and     toothpick.  Sure, nobody bats an eye when copyright law takes some money out     of the shiny, rhinestone-encrusted pockets of Rob Van Winkle or Puff Daddy,     but as soon as lawsuits trip up avant-hoodlums like John Oswald of     Plunderphonics fame, the concept of thievery-as-art becomes a hot topic, and     the line between sampling and stealing becomes fiercely contended.</p>
<p>Given the fact that <i>Since I Left You</i>, the debut album from Aussie party     animals the Avalanches, contains over 900 individual samples, it's pretty     incredible that this thing got released in the first place.  The fact that     they sample everything from long-forgotten R&amp;B; records to golf instructionals     to Madonna's ""Holiday"" makes it even more impressive.  But what really makes     this album brilliant is not as much the volume or quality of the samples used     as the way that they're employed. The Avalanches have managed to build a     totally unique context for all these sounds, while still allowing each to     retain its own distinct flavor.  As a result, <i>Since I Left You</i> sounds     like nothing else.</p>
<p>Much of the beauty of the opening title song and its accompanying track,     ""Stay Another Season,"" lies in the way that the Avalanches turn obvious sonic     mismatches into something all their own. It's not too common that you'll     hear a sample of a horse, a rastafarian singer, and an invitation to a Club     Med disco all in the same song, but somehow it makes perfect sense under the     masterful direction of the Avalanches.</p>
<p>Indeed, many of the most interesting moments on <i>Since I Left You</i> come     with these mismatches. ""A Different Feeling"" sets horn blasts from 1974 against     video game sounds from 1988-- the kind of bizarre pairing of classic soul with     futuristic sounds that constitutes a substantial part of Avalanches magic.     ""Radio,"" which is slated for release as the band's next Australian single,     centers around a mantra-like vocal sample, a thick disco bassline, and bits     and pieces of filtered guitars and synthesizers.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Since I Left You</i>, sampled vocals are used almost like     percussion. But rather than utilizing the frenetic, intricate rhythms seen in     most contemporary rap, the Avalanches repeat small vocal samples over and over     again, melding them into their rump-rocking grooves.  And while many of these     songs rely heavily on the repetition of beats and samples, no single part of     the record is allowed to stagnate. Something is always being mixed up-- a     sample transposed up or down a few steps, a beat chopped up into little pieces     and seamlessly restructured, an unexpected vocal sample popping up out of     nowhere before being swallowed up by the massive sound the Avalanches have     concocted.</p>
<p>Another key element of <i>Since I Left You</i> is the keen sense of humor the     Avalanches display throughout. And ""Frontier Psychiatrist,"" one of two singles     already released from the album, is simply one of the funniest songs I've heard     in ages. Relying on a heavy, Ninja Tune-style beat for backing, ""Frontier     Psychiatrist"" busts out samples from 37 spoken word recordings, resulting in     an oddball, hilarious pastiche of phrases like, ""You're a nut! You're crazy in     the coconut!""  And some brilliant scratching on a sample of a parrot.</p>
<p>Though it contains many distinct songs and moods, <i>Since I Left You</i> is     a remarkably coherent record on all fronts. Aside from the fact that the     Avalanches achieve a certain uniform ""sound"" on this album, subtler elements     come into play as well. Songs blend seamlessly into one another. Samples     reappear from song to song. And the album's final cut, ""Extra Kings,"" with     its breezy flute and psychedelic swells of sound, puts a brilliant twist on     the album's title track, fading out with that same chipmunky voice lamenting,     ""I've tried but I just can't get you/ Ever since the day I left you.""</p>
<p>In releasing <i>Since I Left You</i>, the Avalanches have essentially brought     hundreds of slabs of inanimate vinyl to life. Though it was no doubt     meticulously constructed, this is an album brimming with spontaneity, joy,     sadness, humor, reflection, and general human-ness. With its high fun factor     and subtle traces of deeper emotion, <i>Since I Left You</i> is the perfect     record for the party, and for the period of regret and recovery after the     party.</p></div>"|385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/385-since-i-left-you/|9.5|Matt LeMay

The
    upside: musicians can begin producing music as soon as they've gathered together a few hundred
    bucks, and release that music without financial backing from a record company. Thus, musicians
    are free to pursue whatever musical inclinations they wish, no matter how freaky and/or
    experimental. The downside: Kelley Stoltz. <i>The Past Was Faster</i> is a collection of
    mediocre, generally bad lo-fi, about as refined and likeable as a syphilitic chancre.</p><p>
    From the first fuzzy seconds of <i>The Past Was Faster</i>, you can pretty much expect what's 
    to follow: unmelodious, uninteresting four-track music. Kelley Stoltz wants to be Bob Pollard so
    bad, you can just picture him standing in front of a mirror, swinging a microphone over his
    head, pursing his lips, and singing ""My Valuable Hunting Knife.""  What Stoltz lacks is the
    ability to infuse a few chords with the kind of energetic delivery and strong vocal melodies
    that have made Pollard the veritable indie rock god he's become.</p><p>
    While most of <i>The Past Was Faster</i> is merely lackluster, some of it is absolutely awful.
    After listening to the faux-country disaster, ""The Fog Has Lifted,"" I'd have to say that Stoltz
    could be the worst Tom Waits impersonator of all time. Seriously-- rev up a vacuum cleaner for
    a while, and run an old rag through it, and you get a better Waits impression than Stoltz can
    pull off.</p><p>
    Perhaps the most depressing aspect of the album is that every time Stoltz stumbles upon a
    halfway decent riff, he spends at least three minutes repeating it ad nauseam. After about two
    minutes of nondescript blandness on ""Permafrost,"" the song breaks into a perfectly serviceable,
    pretty acoustic guitar riff. But the riff long outstays its welcome-- those same three or four
    notes repeat over and over again, as if Stoltz is saying to us, ""Listen! I finally figured out
    how to write a song!""  To make matters worse, <i>The Past Was Faster</i>'s relative best track,
    a mellow number reminiscent of (but not nearly as good as) new Yo La Tengo, is actually a
    hidden track, buried deep into the album's last song, ""Lonely Star State.""  And while the
    track is pretty decent, it certainly isn't worth the effort required to find it.</p><p>
    Yes, this album is not without its pleasant moments.  But even when it's pleasant, it's still
    immensely derivative-- and not nearly as good as the material it rips off.  <i>The Past Was
    Faster</i> plays like one man's botched attempt to try his hand at being a ""musician."" And when
    all is said and done, the record is to be taken for exactly what it is-- Kelley Stoltz playing 
    with himself.  We can only hope, for his sake, that he's better at that than he is at
    songwriting.</p></div>"|7521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7521-the-past-was-faster/|3.5|Matt LeMay

    away. Their show was unannounced. I luckily stumbled across the club's listing that morning
    at work in ""Creative Loafing."" I'd been yearning to witness Les Savy Fav's live show, which
    had been garnering disciples along the upper industrial coast. And there I was, alone. Les
    Savy Fav were essentially playing just for me. Typically this scenario would be embarrassing--
    a band outnumbering the crowd-- but Les Savy Fav rocked like I was Budokon.</p><p>
    
    Tim Harrington
    stepped off the stage to sing in my face. His eyes bulged with fervent adrenaline in a near
    thyroid- deficient manner. One guitarist stepped off the stage and flanked me. This band,
    with the audacity and zeal to rock an audience of one (not including the bar staff who were
    wiping up in back), instantly won my heart. They worked up a sweat for me. They stormed the
    vault in my brain where I keep my favorite bands, awoke some slumbering old-timers with slaps,
    and kicked some undeserving squatters out the ear.</p><p>
    
    Most reviews of Les Savy Fav inevitably mention the band's live show. On one hand, it
    demonstrates the band's stage dominance, but it also points to the fact that their two LPs
    to date have been unable to capture that intensity.  This is not to say the albums haven't
    been vital slabs of modern American punk. More so it reveals the effects of the modern digital
    age on the underground.  Pro-Tools and CDs have spoiled the rural and suburban audience.
    Production quality has grown crisp, polished and cheap. Kids can hear more music, faster.
    Distribution with the internet and the matured market puts CDs in Wyoming and Andorra.</p><p>
    
    Les Savy Fav's approach rouses the early days of punk-- the late 70's and 80's. Fans still claim
    the Clash couldn't make a great record, which seems preposterous these days. But those fans
    saw the Clash live. Certainly Minor Threat's live shows punched the gut harder than their 7""s.
    Seeing a band live was essential. Back then, attendance and word of mouth mattered more. Don't
    take this as a discount of the modern scene. What I'm trying to get at is that Les Savy Fav
    make great records, which are not necessarily meant to out-do their live show, but to document
    and supplement the band's physical presence instead. So just listen.</p><p>
<i>The Cat and the Cobra</i> progresses further than Les Savy Fav's debut, <i>3/5</i>, with a
    richer mix, added instrumental elements, and a slightly more confrontational sound. The once-
    subtle Brainiac elements have blossomed into obvious touchstones. The Frankenstein bass and
    sparking guitar of ""We've Got Boxes"" brings to mind <i>Hissing Prigs in Static Couture</i>.
    Warbling vocal effects and unnatural bass undulations under ""Wake Up!"" also recall Dayton's
    late innovators. ""The Orchard"" opens with resigned, sighing vocals and chiming melodic picks
    that eventually add hammers and dynamite to Smart Went Crazy's style of art-pop. Elsewhere,
    the attitude and duel guitar punji stabs continue the spirit of the Pixies.</p><p>
    
    But clearly the focus of Les Savy Fav is the brilliantly demented Tim Harrington. He spits
    the most contrived sentiments with such conviction that it immediately becomes new gospel.
    On ""Who Rocks the Party,"" cries of ""Who rocks the party like we rock the body body!"" lead into
    declarations of, ""They can let loose the dogs on us/ Because the dogs like us more than the
    dogs like them!"" It may read stupid, but how often have you shouted ""I am un chein andolusian!""
    along with Black Francis on ""Debaser?""  Meanwhile, drums throb underneath. No fills. No high
    hats. Guitars screech. It's primal and reviving.</p><p>
    
    Let's face it, there aren't many bands keeping

    represents the last frontier of rock star sexuality?  You know, the one
    that goes on and on about how impotence is symbolic of the last ""fuck
    you"" left in rock n' roll (the final frontier being ""I'm gay"")?  Well,
    in case you didn't get around to hearing this guy's debut, the utterly
    manic <i>Rise Up</i>, this is how you know Bobby Conn: a man with a
    lovingly warped obsession with himself and his limp, shriveled place
    in it.</p><p>
    
    Conn is less a musician than the leader of an elaborate musical sideshow.
    He gets outrageously talented members of the brain rock set (Jim O'Rourke,
    Julie Pomerleau) to partake in his frantic funk orchestra.  He screams and
    whines and moans across the studio, sometimes spewing about revolution,
    sometimes moaning about wanting to see everyone's choda.  Some see divinity
    in this amalgamation of toasted insanity with three kinds of melted cheese.
    Others listen to this balladry mixed with 70's jazz- fusion workouts and
    tsk like their slutty stepmothers.</p><p>
    
    But having received two Bobby Conn records from the Pitchfork Ass Separator
    Dispersion Service, I must confess that I've had enough.  <i>Llovessonngs</i>
    is a four- song EP which continues in the anything- goes vein of his last
    record.  But whereas <i>Rise Up</i> was saved by some sort of coherent
    vision (if you can call fin- de- siecle hormonal nihilism a vision),
    <i>Llovessonngs</i> is too brief to make the impression it wants.  Ranging
    from ""Hair"" outtakes like the Bobby Conn original ""Free Love"" to the
    whiny, orchestral death balladry of ""Without You"" (a cover), Conn is
    simply too sweaty to sleep beside.  The last track ""Maria B"" is a standout,
    however, propelled by a pulsating percussion break and Conn's silky
    falsetto.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of this opinion, one is forced to consider Bobby Conn on one's
    own.  Conn's crap is urgent and odd enough to at least demand your attention,
    if not your adoration.  For us, <i>Llovessonngs</i> only had the former.</p></div>"|1578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1578-llovessonngs-ep/|4.2|Samir Khan

    music fan. Barbara the musician turns out some smart coffeehouse pop
    albums like <em>Lately I Keep Scissors and, with her erstwhile backing
    band the San Francisco Seals, </em><em>Truth Walks in Sleepy Shadows</em>.
    Barbara the music fan goes off to record with her idols, such as with
    Stuart Moxham on <em>Barbara Manning Sings with the Original Artists</em>,
    but to call it a ""Barbara Manning solo album"" is a bit misleading. The
    latter is mostly Barbara singing Young Marble Giants songs, so anyone
    expecting a songwriting collaboration between Manning and Moxham would
    inevitably be disappointed. Her voice is pretty enough, but her
    personality tended to get lost in the mix. <em>In New Zealand</em> is
    another such ""solo album,"" albeit more of a collaborative effort, and a
    slightly more successful one at that.</p><p>
    
    When Manning toured New Zealand in 1997 with Texas noir- rockers Calexico
    as her backing band, she took the opportunity to lay down tracks with some
    of her favorite local musicians. The resulting seven tracks comprise a
    pleasant trifle of an album that merely hints at the potential of a
    collaboration between Manning, Calexico, and folks like the Clean's David
    Kilgour, the Bats' Robert Scott, and the Verlaines' Graeme Downes. The
    wistful, airy ""Everything Happens By Itself"" is the best example of a
    group songwriting effort, while ""Lover's Leap,"" a gently spooky tune
    written by Calexico's Joey Burns, offers hope for a future Manning album
    should she and Calexico continue to record together. On the downside,
    though, Chris Knox's particular brand of creepy weirdness on ""Your Pies""
    disturbs the otherwise mellow vibe of the rest of the album, and the
    closing track ""Aramoana"" is a crystalline Seam- like instrumental which
    would be great if it didn't drag on for so long. <em>In New Zealand</em>
    ends up being a nice keepsake for fans of Manning and/or New Zealand pop,
    but it's not really a must- buy.</p></div>"|5086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5086-in-new-zealand/|7.0|Nick Mirov

    <i>Homespun</i> is a strange one. These are the demos of the entire <i>Apple Venus Vol. 1</i>
    record, sequenced in the same order. This means that those who buy this record after knowing
    and loving <i>Apple Venus</i> will have to sit through essentially the same album again, while
    those who don't own <i>Apple Venus</i> would probably be better off with the real deal. So
    what's the thinking here, exactly? I can see the Beatles releasing those <i>Anthology</i> tapes
    after all those years, given their status, but why would XTC follow up a record with another
    record containing demos of the same tunes?</p><p>
    
    The decision to release these tapes seems even stranger when you consider that most of these
    demos don't differ much from their studio-recorded counterparts. When you hear the word ""demo""
    associated with <i>Homespun</i>, don't go in expecting it to sound like it was recorded in
    Robert Pollard's garage or anything.  Frontman Andy Partridge and cohort Colin Moulding have
    what sound like extremely sophisticated setups in their home studios, and the fidelity on this
    record would put many professional recordings to shame.  And they don't sound like they were
    shotgunning Budweisers between takes, either.</p><p>
    
    So, the differences are in the details, as on the orchestral backing of tunes like ""River of
    Orchids"" and ""Easter Theater,"" where Partridge triggers the string parts (with identical
    arrangements to the final versions) with a sampler. It's a convincing replication of a chamber
    orchestra, especially for demo purposes, but it obviously doesn't sound as rich and full as the
    final <i>Apple Venus</i> take. More valuable are the skeletal versions of songs like ""I'd Like
    That"" and ""Harvest Festival"" (both of which contain a brief selection from an earlier, rougher,
    dirtier take) that sound almost like proper demos. These particular tracks chip away at the
    glossy veneer of the final album recordings, revealing a melodic sense solid to the core.</p><p>
    
    For XTC fanatics, who this collection is surely geared toward, <i>Homespun</i> comes with
    detailed liner notes that give an entertaining overview of the genesis of every piece. But
    mostly, this record stands as a further testament to a great songwriter. Partridge has spoken
    in interviews of hoping to achieve the melodic prowess of heroes like Burt Bacharach and
    Brian Wilson.  Judging from his life's work, I'd say he's made it.</p></div>"|8832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8832-homespun/|7.6|Mark Richard-San

When
    so many bands tack on throwaway lines, inside jokes, the label's pick for the first single, or
    random acquisitions that require extended narratives that tax even Serena Altschul's
    near-beatific tolerance for rock and roll bullshit, one simply has to give credit when someone does
    it right. Naming an instrumental album with artistic conviction requires no small degree of
    insight and introspection; an artist must stand far enough from the work to see it clearly.
    Ui's <i>The Iron Apple</i> EP simply could not stand under any other banner.</p><p>
<i>The Iron Apple</i>, like Burgess' ""A Clockwork Orange"" and Burroughs' ""The Soft Machine,""
    struggles with lines between organic and inhuman. This is Ui at their most experimental and
    tweaked. Ui's 1995 debut, <i>Sidelong</i>, used the irresistible force of twin Fender Bass
    guitars to twine grooves around a solid, if mildly uninteresting, skein of funk drumming. Last
    year's <i>Lifelike</i> went farther into New York post-rock, where the bands' natural funky
    leanings served as the thinnest of lifelines while the music itself rocketed start- and- stop
    into the oddest time signatures and bizarre sonic hybrids.  The album was weird, but surgically
    so-- all of its exhilarating strangeness smacked of calculation-- which alienated many and     
    enthralled others.</p><p>
    I sincerely hope that <i>The Iron Apple</i> EP is stalking out the future trajectories of Ui's
    strange wanderings. The five-track EP progresses from the very <i>Lifelike</i>-sounding
    opening track, ""Mrs. Lady Lady"" into cooler and cooler dimensions of abstraction. The title
    tracks is the sound of music being pumped full of strange inert gasses: one notices the
    signature grooves fail to synch up, and the spaces between instruments and notes becomes
    unbridgeable. The tendency is always from groove to mechanism, from the camaraderie of a trio
    of humans jamming with fluidity to musical miscommunication and alienation-- which is not to
    suggest musical ineptitude but rather an ear for sounds in insolation.  The third track, ""Ms.
    Lady,"" is undergirded by squawks of fuzz noise as the guitars proceed tenuously into the
    disorder and attempt to construct precarious grooves which never seem to hold together.
    Something else always emerges.
    </p><p>
    ""Golden Pietro"" makes nods to the style of futurism explored by Trans Am on <i>Futureworld</i>
    with sparse drum machines and looming synths. A Fender jazz bass plucks desperately at odd
    intervals; frightening whines of buzzsaw sounds starting cutting up the background. The
    buzzsaws become talk box guitar for the last few seconds of the track. The effect is unnerving.
    </p><p>
    ""Run Pietro"" is the least coherent track on the disc and somehow the best and most emblematic.
    The noisy analog effects are held in perfect sway with limpid acoustic guitar lines. That Ui
    groove is there but you have to stand far back to see it, to hear it unfolding over a greater
    sense of time. In some sense, they've lost the ass-swaggering bass guitar love that made
    <i>Sidelong</i> such a great album to party to, but <i>The Iron Apple</i> puts Ui's closet
    funk algebraics to such impressive use. This is why the title of the disc struck me as so
    telling: there still resides a deep, soft sensuality in Ui's music, but the fruit is armored
    now and the apple has sharp corners.

    singer/songwriter, and that guitarist Bob Mould was typically seen as the
    creative center of the band.  That's unfair, of course, since Hart was
    responsible for close to half of their oeuvre. But it's equally unfair that,
    in the 13 years since the H√ºskers split, Mould's solo career has overshadowed
    Hart's, both in prolificacy and measure of success.  <i>Good News for Modern
    Man</i> is Hart's first solo release since 1990's <i>Intolerance</i>, and more
    than six years have passed since the last release by his ill-fated Nova Mob
    project.  It's a shame, really, because this album proves he's equally capable
    of delivering the goods as his former bandmate, even if it takes him longer to
    do it.</p><p>
    Even at their most hardcore, H√ºsker D√º were pop lovers at heart.  Hart
    indulges that tendency here and makes literally no concession to his punk
    roots-- a good thing, since he possesses a fantastic knowledge of the form
    and turns out a terrifically diverse set of songs.  While he's at it, Hart
    takes it upon himself to play all the instruments, too, and displays a
    facility for tight, inventive, multi-layered arrangements.</p><p>
    The huge guitar chords of ""Think It Over Now"" ride equally huge Spector-sized
    drums, while ""Nobody Rides for Free"" recalls Bob Dylan's character-sketching
    heyday.  The awkwardly titled ""Run Run Run to the Centre Pompidou"" combines
    Dick Dale-styled guitar work with Brian Wilson vocal harmonies without a trace
    of retro-kitsch.  ""You Don't Have to Tell Me Now"" is one of the most gorgeous
    songs Hart has ever written, closely resembling his ex-band's quieter moments.
    And sudden left turns, like the cheesy keyboard and ominous layers of reverb
    that crop up in ""Teeny's Hair"" only serve to prove Grant's mastery of his
    craft.</p><p>
<i>Good News</i>' five songs are all so well crafted, in fact, it's surprising
    when the album starts to wear thin around the halfway point.  ""A Letter From
    Anne Marie"" begins pleasingly enough, with some effective (if synthesized)
    horn and string arrangements.  But all too soon, it becomes insufferably
    repetitive, as the title refrain is repeated endlessly over the same four
    chords.  Eventually, Hart's warbly falsetto begins to grate, and the song
    completely fails to justify its six-minute length.  The following track, ""In
    a Cold House,"" despite its tasty baritone guitar riff, quickly stumbles into
    the same pitfalls.  Yet even in these weaker moments, the production and
    arrangements remain top notch.  The album doesn't stay down for long, luckily,
    though the proceeding tracks can't quite erase the effects of that brief loss
    of momentum.</p><p>
    ""Seka Knows"" trots along in \xBE time, pleasantly reminiscent of <i>New Day
    Rising</i>'s ""She Floated Away.""  The fragment ""Let Rosemary Rock Him,
    Laura-Louise,"" though grippingly titled, hardly seems a necessary inclusion,
    but it precedes one of the album's best tracks, the closer, ""Little Nemo.""
    ""Nemo"" builds from cut-up piano parts and subtle guitar and percussion into
    a steady rocker before disintegrating a la ""A Day in the Life,"" only to slowly
    coalesce again around cascading piano and brisk guitar chords masked by waves
    of distortion.  The attention to craft and detail is what carries the final
    product, and it's no wonder it took Grant three years to record it on his own.
    <i>Good News for Modern Man</i> sounds remarkably fresh for guy who's released
    so little over the past decade.  For now, I'm just glad he's still making
    records, and hoping this isn't his last.</p></div>"|3749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3749-good-news-for-modern-man/|7.7|D. Erik Kempke

    Well, Q-Tip thinks it's booty.  Booty?  Booty.  That's what it is.  In fact, booty is just
    about all Q-Tip seems to think about these days.  On his first effort since the separation
    of A Tribe Called Quest, Q-Tip makes the transition from the familiar pensive Abstract Poet,
    prominent like Shakespeare, to a different breed of MC who seems interested only in
    ruminations of the booty-esque.  For purposes of simplification, we may postulate his
    Three Commandments of Booty, if you will:</p><p>
    
    1)  Any booty located in or near a venue at which a Q-Tip joint is being broadcast shalt not
    refrain from both shaking in a frenzied manner and being scantily clad.</p><p>
    
    2)  Any jeep-like motorized conveyance belonging to or operated by Q-Tip shalt not be lacking
    a satisfactory supply of booty, which may be employed in an erotic capacity.</p><p>
    
    3)  Any personage whose lyrical flow is pertaining to booty and its ilk shalt not attempt to
    handle a microphone, nor shall said individual be let near such a device.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the above sums up the content of <i>Amplified</i>'s lyrics almost entirely.
    Gone from the wax is Abstract the storyteller and social critic.  He's been replaced by a
    scarcely recognizable, sex-obsessed MC who declares:  ""While we're in the heat of the moment,
    fuck morality.""  This is a disconcerting metamorphosis, indeed.  For years, Q-Tip was the
    paragon of taste, intellect, and awareness in hip-hop, dropping true wisdom through incredibly
    clever verse.  But instead of maturing with age, Q-Tip has regressed substantially.  His lyrics
    now float awkwardly between sexual fascination and indictment of ""weakling rappers,"" and often
    in the same track.  Of course, Q-Tip's delivery is still smooth like caramel, but his rhymes
    are markedly less crafty and more repetitive than any of his past works.</p><p>
    
    Of course, this is all relative.  Even Q-Tip's not-so-relevant work on <i>Amplified</i>
    confirms his place in the highest echelon of lyricists-- despite the nature of his rhymes,
    his timing is unequaled.  <i>Amplified</i> exhibits new methods of delivery for Abstract which
    demonstrate just how diverse his styles can be.  Musically, most of <i>Amplified</i> sounds
    absolutely nothing like Tribe's material, but on tracks like ""Let's Ride"" and ""Things You Do,""
    a palpable Quest vibe emerges.  The Ummah production crew lays down tracks which are less
    melodic and organic than typical Tribe fare, but are rhythmically frantic and induce abundant
    head nodding.  It's a whole new realm for Q-Tip, replete with peculiar synthesized noises
    and rapidly administered samples, which he adapts to with such expertise that one can nearly
    forget the track featuring a guest appearance by Korn.</p><p>
    
    Yes, I said Korn.  I'd like to shake hands with the genius who thought to couple Q-Tip with the
    water faucet drip of talent that is Korn.  I mean, it's not like he spotted Korn puffing L's in
    kilts on the Ave in Queens and the notion just knocked him to the ground with its brilliance.
    Did he ask Richard Simmons for music advice?  Could he be related to the mastermind behind such
    feats of intellect as Crystal Pepsi and ""The Magic Johnson Show?""  At any rate, it goes without
    saying that he's not exactly hitting them out of the park.  Let us examine a brief encapsulation
    of Jonathan Davis' lyrical wizardry from ""End of Time,"" a track on which Tip appears for
    probably 45 seconds: ""It's kind of scary, you see/ How fucked up things can be/ Each time you
    take a breath/ Hell, it could be your last.""  Wow.  If you need to stop reading for a minute in
    order to ponder this goldmine of metaphysical significance, please do so.  Fortunately, this is
    followed by the excellent ""Do It, See It, Be It,"" the only truly introspective track <i>Amplified</i>
    has to show for itself.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, when faced with an artist who has produced such an extraordinary body of work
    within the context of a whole group, we can't pretend that his solo work should stand somehow
    beyond comparison with that of the group.  Tribe had a positive group mentality that manifested
    itself through the message behind the music, and this element is painfully absent in <i>Amplified</i>.
    Without a crew whose virtues he may also extol, Q-Tip's self-praise comes off as exceedingly
    arrogant.  And while the music is fresh and Tip's new look is slick, we know that Abstract has 
    much more to bring to the table lyrically.  Or does he?  It seems that most people reach a
    certain age and, without warning, shed their talent.  Only Q-Tip's next solo effort can be the
    true indicator of whether or not he's lost it.</p></div>"|6622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6622-amplified/|6.8|Taylor M. Clark

A good PR man would tell
    Raczynski that press releases are meant to introduce journalists to the artists and provide
    some background information that could be used in a review. Raczynski writes his own press
    releases, and he sees them as a forum to tell me (the reviewer) what a worthless, lazy,
    unoriginal parasitic worm I am. I quote: ""Let's be honest... you just write shit-ass reviews 
    and interviews to further your own career.""</p><p>
    
    Fair enough. But I refuse to be dragged down into the mud with Raczynski, and rather than
    panning his album in retribution, I'm giving it a fair listen.  So it kind of sucks that
    Raczynski has actually gone and made a good (if a bit odd) record. The 11-track <i>Thinking of
    You</i> is a concept album of sorts, supposedly about the pain of unrequited love.  And judging
    from the harshness of these digital textures, there's much pain in Raczynski's life.  But
    there's beauty, too, and he knows how to shuffle and mingle the two in a compelling way.</p><p>
    
    Witness the opening track, ""All I Want is to Be by Your Side But You Don't Care."" It begins
    with a choppy, hip-hop-inspired drum break that wouldn't sound out of place on a DJ Shadow
    record.  Then, it folds in spoken words (I believe, Raczynski's native Polish), building
    tension slowly until releasing into a synthesized music box melody combined with some distorted,
    horribly out of key-- but strangely affecting-- singing.</p><p>
    
    This swirling of the pretty and the ugly in a whirlpool of erratic beats and cheap, customized
    synths will undoubtedly remind many of the work of Raczynski's label boss, Aphex Twin. And
    indeed, much of <i>Thinking of You</i> compares to Aphex's work circa <i>Come to Daddy</i>.
    There are fewer moments of transcendent beauty here-- the lovely, minute-long ""Thinking of You
    Thinking of Me"" is the only beatless ambient track-- than on an Aphex Twin record, but
    Raczynkski exhibits the same skill for constructing beats and twisting sounds into something 
    alien and new.</p><p>
    
    The interplanetary ""Unsatisfied Consumer"" sounds like the work of a programmed Groovebox
    accidentally plugged into a 220-volt socket, with hectic, splattered beats and impossibly high
    vocal samples. More menacing still is ""You As an Out-of-Control Extension of Me,"" which
    features a drawn-out, orchestral string sample beneath a bed of booming drums and a throbbing,
    ominous bassline. Raczynski may not be the most ingratiating Polish expatriate, but he knows
    how to work his laptop.</p></div>"|6638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6638-thinking-of-you/|6.6|Mark Richard-San

    head-scratching and very little bum-waving.</p><p>
    A quick listen to a handful of Two Lone Swordsmen releases might have
    the neophyte writing them off as ""self-consciously strange lads"" were
    it not for the men involved.  Yeah, guys, Andrew Weatherall and Keith
    Tenniswood's names cast long, if spotty, shadows on modern music.  Some
    would say their credentials make anything they're involved with worth
    listening to.  I wouldn't go that far, but it's true that a lot of what
    they've put out would have received a muted response (if any) were it
    not attached to their moniker and the famed electronic label they
    record for.</p><p>
    Two Lone Swordsmen have a lot of character, though.  Their sound has a
    playful, in-jokey sort of levity that has also characterized fellow madcap
    ambient-electronic auteurs the Orb (whom Weatherall has often remixed and
    worked with).  You almost get the idea that their obscure song titles
    (""Brother Foster Through the Phones,"" ""Cloned Christ on a Hover Donkey
    [Be Thankful]"") are not random at all, but in fact tied to some shared
    joke between which is no doubt utterly hilarious ""if you were there.""
    </p><p>
    It's just one of the elements that make up a project which, for the most
    part, consists of two guys making music for themselves and having a good
    time with it.  Some would say good music is always made with an audience
    in mind, lest it be impersonal and without significant weight. However,
    music made with an audience in mind also has the conspicuous additional
    baggage of being aimed at a demographic; albums may be cut down or edited
    in keeping with possible audience reaction, at the expense of the artist's
    vision.  Weatherall and Tenniswood don't seem to give a good goddamn about
    demographics or audience perception, and it's unsure as to whether even the
    most devoted Richard D. James-obsessed Warpite would find much to latch on
    to, here.
    </p><p>
    The songs don't differ too much from each other, although if pressed,
    I'd probably say that the subtly menacing ""Our Kid's Berwick"" would be the
    best of the bunch.  There's a sort of cohesiveness to the whole affair
    that's a breath of fresh air compared to older releases by these fellows,
    just as last year's lovely <i>Stay Down</i> full-length seemed tied to
    some manner of ""underwater"" concept.  It almost gives you the impression
    the bastards really know what they're doing now.
    </p><p>
    If these two had a formula (and this is stretching it), it would be this:
    first, ready an arsenal of wobbly sounds, all set to cause various degrees
    of uneasiness in the listener.  Drop some deceptively simple slow beats
    into the mix of wobbly sounds, which are now shooting about in some sort
    of warped, angular, methodical groove.  Sprinkle odd washes of background
    ambiance and spoken word bits in there.  Occasionally power this concoction
    with a rubbery woofer-pummeling bassline.
    </p><p>
    This probably sounds interesting to many of you, and by and large, it is.
    However, one gets the feeling that an ""EP"" like this (it's album length, for
    sure) could be churned out once a week without much sweat.  These guys are
    in control of their gear, and their sounds, but perhaps not their collective
    noggins.  A little quality control could go a long way to cleaning up their
    releases, and though the anything-goes aesthetic is endearing at times,
    there are definitely times when you wish you didn't feel like skipping to
    the next track so damned often.
    </p><p>
    In a time with so many balls-and-all electronic albums which, some claim,
    have something for everyone, this is an album which has a whole lot of
    something for a particularly odd sort of person.  I guess that person could
    be described as ""a Two Lone Swordsmen fan.""  Maybe they're aiming at a
    demographic after all.

Though you may have loved their
    initial sound, it gets tired after a few records and you find yourself
    hoping they'll try something new to stave off your boredom.  Other bands--
    bands like Duster... you like what they have going and hope they stay the
    course. Duster's slow, noisy and frayed sonic sludge is a thing o' beauty
    for those willing to look closely enough, and while their <i>1975</i> EP
    shows not a whit of growth from their two previous 7"" or their 1998 debut,
    <i>Stratosphere</i>, it still delivers the sad space rock goods in fine
    form.</p><p>
    
    The only minor adjustment on <i>1975</i> is a slight- but- noticeable shift
    to a more song- oriented, and less sonic- dependent environment. On tracks
    like ""Memphis Sophisticate"" and ""And Things (Are Mostly Ghosts),"" the lyrics
    are clear and easy to discern, a rarity for a band this in love with
    distortion and cheap recording methods. Both these tracks jettison the
    layered guitars and meandering organ for a more stripped down approach,
    and while this uncluttered backing highlights what turns out to be pretty
    fair songwriting chops, something of Duster's singular identity is lost in
    the process.  Yeah, these are good songs, but they sound like they could
    have been recorded by any number of other ""slow"" bands.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, Duster make their name as a band that focuses on the blurry edges
    around the picture and leaves the deeper meaning to the imagination.  ""The
    Motion Picture,"" with drums that crawl by like a wounded sloth and an
    indiscernible vocal track that cuts in and out in double time, is closer to
    the Duster I've grown to love. Same goes for ""August Relatively,"" which uses
    the timeworn technique of backward drums to lend an otherworldly feel to the
    skeletal melody. But ""Want No Light to Shine,"" the EP's closer, is by far the
    highlight: with a gentle organ filling the spaces left by a nervous, trembling
    guitar, it seems so fragile it could disappear at any moment. And then it does,
    into a lovely coda played on an upright piano, a heartbreaking ending to another
    fine example of the Duster sound.</p></div>"|2494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2494-1975-ep/|7.1|Mark Richard-San

    year when his <i>Fell in Love at 22</i> EP saw him taking an abrupt stylistic left turn.  It
    was nothing short of a total revision of the band's sound.  The guitars blanketed instead of
    fuzzed.  Hushed pianos and hypnotic keyboard effects gave his songs a newfound sophistication.
    And his voice, previously coated by layers of syrupy distortion, was not only audible, but
    genuinely agile.  For those who heard it, the EP came as a surprise.  Martin had scrapped the
    ""American My Bloody Valentine"" label and crafted songs that by turns caressed and entranced,
    and proved he was not only better than an above-average imitator but actually an original
    artist.</p><p>
    
    While his new effort, <i>Everybody Makes Mistakes</i>, doesn't exactly pick up where that EP
    left off, it does preserve the same whimsical sense of experimentation.  This time out, Martin
    has opted to scale back some of the loftier ambitions of the EP in favor of simpler song
    structures.  And though the results might not be drop-your-jaw astounding, it's a beguilingly
    pleasant listen.  The fuzzy guitars have returned, but the songs are no longer permitted to
    fray at the edges or drift off into a sludgy sonic netherworld.  The chord changes are
    discernable; the melody is the focus.</p><p>
    
    While they don't deviate too far from the non-stick surface of the Starflyer Pop Frying Pan,
    the melodies of <i>Everybody Makes Mistakes</i> wind their way down a more countrified route
    at times, and even occasionally find their way to the land of New Wave.  The opening track,
    ""Play the C Chord,"" demonstrates the power of Starflyer's lethal catchiness, invading the
    brain without the benefit of a distinct chorus.  The New Wave surfaces on the second track,
    ""No New Kinda Story,"" which flashes a ticklish, shimmering guitar hook before spinning into
    something downright sinister midway through.  Another highlight comes with the morose ""A
    Dethroned King,"" a track that pummels with angst.</p><p>
    
    If one criticism can be leveled at Jason Martin, it's that he sounds at times-- particularly
    on ""No More Shows"" and the aforementioned ""A Dethroned King""-- like he's reaching for that
    elusive Radiohead sound.  To his credit, though, he never attempts to scale the signature vocal
    and musical peaks that would be required, contenting himself instead to take a more even path
    through the sonic foothills.</p><p>
<i>Everybody Makes Mistakes</i> clocks in at a misleading 40 minutes, which includes 8 minutes
    of silence and a woefully out-of-place Kenny G bootleg following the final track.  But what it
    lacks in length, it compensates for in girth.  This is chubby pop, dense and rewarding.  One
    night of this album feels like a week-- a sleepless week.  Martin artfully churns out well-
    crafted pop without ever sinking into a quagmire of repetition.  It's not anything that hasn't
    been done before, of course, but it is damn good music.</p></div>"|7461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7461-everybody-makes-mistakes/|7.8|Beatty & Garrett

    chaser, then Sally Timms' collection of country-tinged tunes might be like sipping
    a cup of Earl Grey tea. And I guess by ""genuine"" country I mean the bastard
    shit-kickin' Johnny Paycheck and Merle Haggard kinda country. Timms' take on
    the genre isn't exactly strong, intoxicating medicine for your troubles, but it
    might do just fine on a lonely winter's eve.</p><p>
    I'll carry the beverage motif no farther, and just say that Sally Timms is by no
    means a great traditional country singer or songwriter. Truthfully, though, her
    voice never sounded better. It's dreamy, angelic, and totally guileless, not
    artificially countrified. But then again, she sang with those country-lovin'
    Brits, the Mekons-- a band that blended punk and rootsy Americana influences
    with British Isles folk. They never intended to be musical purists in the least.
    And here, Timms is paying her own distinct tribute to the music she loves. It's
    all elegantly rendered in her laid-back, monochromatic vocal style.  There's
    no hipster irony, no feigned country accents, and no obnoxious posing here.</p><p>
    I recently read a review in which Timms' latest album is denounced as a sham of
    sorts-- the treatment of these songs was evidently too un-country to register
    with this particular expert on the aesthetics of Hick.   I mean, is it so
    inconceivable that the Beatles' versions of Buck Owens' ""Act Naturally"" or Carl
    Perkins' ""Matchbox"" could rival the originals? Here, Sally's just doing a little
    pretending, too. Nothing to get uptight about.
    </p><p>
    Hell, for years now the Brits have been obsessed with the American West-- the
    frontier myths, cowboy culture, and especially the music associated with the
    region. Timms is simply living out her fantasy of being a barefoot, backwoods
    hillbilly songstress; she's sitting by the campfire, strumming her acoustic
    guitar, singing to the tumbleweeds and coyotes.  Sure, there's nothing brilliant
    or ground-breaking about it, but no harm done on the ears, neither.
    </p><p>
    And no, the production isn't the earthiest in the world, but the arrangements
    are simple and tight: it's mostly pedal steel guitar, fiddle, and occasional
    banjo-picking over delicate acoustic strumming.  And it's damn hard to argue
    with the material Timms chooses to cover, namely Johnny Cash's brutal caveat
    to a lover gone astray, ""Cry Cry Cry."" Other highlights include a Timms original--
    the Tex-Mex spice of ""Canciones Para Mi Padre""-- and even a little contemporary
    alt-country in the form of Jeff Tweedy's ""When the Roses Bloom Again"" and Jill
    Sobule's ""Rock Me to Sleep.""
    </p><p>
    The title is appropriate, too, since the album really is catered to the buckaroo
    that's simply ""lost.""  However, if you're a lost, lonely, jilted, drunk,
    unemployed, emasculated, near-suicidal buckaroo, maybe you should try some early
    Tammy Wynette, or a Merle Haggard Christmas album. Then you'll be shocked into
    existential contentment by what real country-fried pain and heartbreak is like.
    But if you're not quite ready to wallow in the ""authentic"" country music pigpen
    of abject sadness and depression, maybe try <i>Cowboy Sally's Twilight Laments
    for Lost Buckaroos</i>.

But that only means sick from work, not sick from Pitchfork.
    Actually, it doesn't really mean I got sick <i>from</i> work.  Well, it could.  It was
    either from one of my roommates or from someone at work-- which, of course, would make
    it from work.  So today I was sick from work.</p><p>
    
    Things to do on a sick day:<br/>
    1 Sleep<br/>
    2 Drink water<br/>
    3 Watch a movie you've been putting off (""The Sweet Hereafter"")<br/>
    4 Make some chicken soup (I did, I really did)<br/>
    5 Put up plastic sheeting over the window that leaks cold air into your
    room, since it doesn't have a storm window-- something else that helped
    make me sick.<br/>
    6 Drink tea</p><p>
    
    So I did all those things and here I am now after dark in the basement with
    a wool hat on and a blanket wrapped around me.  Do I feel any better?  Not
    really.  My condition has gotten better, yet worse. If I get lots of sleep
    tonight, I'll probably feel better in the morning.  I hope.</p><p>
    
    Fiona Apple is playing on my computer.  And actually, I wasn't going to
    review it.  I was just listening to it-- and enjoying it.  ...Wait.  Fiona
    Apple?  Two years ago I hated her.  Actually, up till a month ago I hated
    her.  I thought she was just an annoying girl who'd been offered the microphone
    <i>way</i> too many times to voice conclusions she had spent her <i>whole life</i>
    (read: not that long) coming to. Why was this pretentious girl so famous? Why
    did they keep handing her the mic to quote Maya Angelou?  Why did I keep
    watching her?</p><p>
    
    The music on her first album failed to interest me.  I thought it rambled.
    It drooped and moped.  It dragged itself into bed and went to sleep.  Ah,
    that actually sounds nice right now.  It put <i>me</i> to sleep.  In a bad
    way. The songs seemed to ramble on with a synthetic soul that spoke of a
    young girl admiring and trying to duplicate the styles of days past.</p><p>
    Then, a couple months ago, the story broke that Apple had given her next
    album a 90- word title. Perfect! I hadn't thought that she could take the
    pretension to another level.</p><p>
    
    A few weeks ago, I saw the video for ""Fast As You Can,"" the first single off
    <i>When the Pawn</i> (the short, 1/30th version of the album's title). This
    was an upbeat and energetic video-- far from the pedophilic ""Criminal"" off
    her last album.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson perfectly matched visuals with
    the music (as he did in ""Boogie Nights""): Apple stays just out of sync the
    whole time, as if the camera can't keep up with her and she can't keep up with
    herself. Now this was interesting. This was different. This was worth a little
    attention.</p><p>
    
    So I got the album.  The one with 90 words on the cover.  So what?  It's
    good.  Apple kicks in with ""On the Bound,"" a lumbering opener that starts
    with some heavy Portishead-esque beats, but coming through the bass notes
    of a piano. Lyrically, it sounds like a personal examination: ""I don't know
    what I'm doing, don't know should I/ Change my mind, I can't decide, there's
    too many/ Variations to consider.""</p><p>
    
    ""To Your Love"" follows and picks up with a pulsing piano chord and the lyrics:
    ""Here's another speech you wish I'd swallow/ Another cue for you to fold your
    ears.""  Apple confronts a would-be lover, but it also seems directed towards
    critiques of her early outspokenness. She almost acknowledges the hordes of
    people turned off by her younger ramblings.</p><p>
    
    But now Fiona seems older. Her voice is full of a heartfelt soul that seems
    almost timeless. While Billie Holiday would never have considered the
    possibility of lines like, ""It won't be long till you'll be/ Lying limp in
    your own hand,"" Apple executes them flawlessly with a modern passion. It's
    also important to note that her musical ideas and lyrics have caught up with
    the ability of her voice. The songs are well varied, and transition smoothly
    from one to the other whereas her first album all sounded the same to me.
    She finally got the concept [cough].</p><p>
    
    Yeah, I'm still sick. I'm forgetting how to type.  But I feel like an end
    is near. One more night's rest. Another tall glass of orange juice. More
    echinacea tea. Two more Tylenol. It's been rough, but better than living the
    life of Fiona Apple's songs-- constantly fighting anger, apprehension, fear,
    and passion.</p></div>"|247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/247-when-the-pawn/|8.0|Chip Chanko

It's the one with the kid midget and
    the witch. The witch brought a giant doll to life, you see, who is played by this kid midget
    with rosey dots on his cheeks and white gloves awkwardly slipped over his tiny hands. Naturally,
    most of the show is family drama posed by the gorgeous, but it's worth sitting through the
    arguments and kisses to get to the kid midget. Last week, a girl threw the midget behind a
    couch, where his archnemisis, the cat, tore him apart. This in daytime! It's David Lynch meets
    ""Sunset Beach!"" And after a while, those plastic characters and mangled monologues intrigue
    even more than the ""kidget.""</p><p>
    
    Similarly, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci operates on this fascinating dementia versus dogmatic principle.
    <i>Spanish Dance Troupe</i> bursts occasionally with pixelated pop. ""Poodle Rocking"" and the
    title track gleefully purge with Welsh harmonies and halucinations-- like a hybrid of the Super
    Furry Animals and Belle and Sebastian, who are both blessedly demented in their separate ways.
    These moments spring from a field of moss- covered acoustic Saxon- ballads. Gossamer guitar and
    weeping fiddle drift through oddly affecting Renaissance fare. ""Freckles"" and ""The Humming Song""
    pluck like a druid Elliot Smith. Simon and Garfunkel are occasionally invoked in songs as gentle
    and refreshing as tissues and ponds. A fog of harmonies hangs over duvet- covered horns and
    sighing pianos.</p><p>
    
    Gorky's can commendably serve country and folk flavors to doggedly indie- rock palates. No
    matter how seemingly innocuous the tunes can seem, they'll subtly float you like chunks of dry
    ice on hard wood and leave beads of dew under your shoes. Treeless hills and Tolkein spill from
    their lips. Except, of course, when the disease claws their brains and another kid midget- esque
    gem tickles your armpits.</p></div>"|3527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3527-spanish-dance-troupe/|7.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

No doubt Mr. Thirp thought he was imparting in that vaguely oriental, gnomic nugget some great wisdom that would see me through my turbulent adolescence and ready me for the tangles and thickets of adulthood. Well, I have found disappointment, and I'm ready to testify that I was not prepared.</p>
<p>Now I'm ready to confess that I'm not the most dyed- in- the- wool Pet Shop Boys fan, but I do appreciate urbanity, wry wit, sly verbal parries and a fine, stompin' four- to- the- floor amyl groove. But I'm so upset, it's the utmost I can do to stifle my tears, lest I short out my laptop. <i>Nightlife</i>, the follow-up to the Boys'sizzling fusion of Latin rhythms, deep house and jaded insouciance, <i>Bilingual</i>, is a mush of half- arsed trance, lyrics worthy of a late- middle- aged romance authoress and misguided R&amp;B.; But it's Neil Tennant's wanton disregard for his own talents that's the real shame here.</p>
<p>Now, I believed Tennant wholeheartedly when he sang ""Do I Have To?"" and ""I Would Normally Do This Kind of Thing."" I swooned when he crooned the chestnutty ""Always On My Mind."" He were almost the Noel Coward of dance pop-- the Cole Porter of Mies van der Rohe- furnished house! But now he tries us with clunky would- be aphorisms and bon mots. Did he think we wouldn't gag on lines like, ""Hear a song/ That's the bomb!/ If you don't get that mix/ It's gone '86!"" and ""When loneliness induces fear/ Like waves against a ramshackle pier""?</p>
<p><i>Nightlife</i> opens with the Rollo- produced and consequently extremely radio- friendly, ""For Your Own Good,"" a cautionary tale about the dangers of paying for sex when Neil Tennant is waiting to give you a cuddle and sympathy for free. Of course, one shouldn't expect a Pet Shop Boys album to open like a Jansky Noise/ VVM soundclash, but the rococo blandness of ""For Your Own Good,"" which relies heavily on samples from Rollo's Faithless project, sets one up for the mightiest disappointment since the lonesome evening you discovered that you couldn't perform auto- fellatio.</p>
<p>Much in the same, erm... vein does Tennant work out his theological conundrums and his highest falsetto on ""Closer to Heaven."" The song isn't the rapturous disco paean to the profound beauty of the Trinity as one might have believed, though. Rather, Tennant dwells on the fact that whomever he's smitten with is-- gasp!-- both an angel and a devil. Yeah, only in a dance track could one hope to astound a captive audience with such insight. I just hope those shimmying to this effort are astoundingly bolloxed on a nine inch line of Special K snorted off some rank club urinal.</p>
<p>Matters marginally improve with ""I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Anymore."" Here, Tennant develops and extemporizes on the theme of material gain and its inability to satisfy the desires which prowl our base natures. Or else he reckoned that being Everything But the Girl for a day would be beezer fun. But unlike ETBG's Tracey Thorn, Tennant doesn't have the dramatic vocal skill to make this song anything more than first- single- off- the- album radio fodder.</p>
<p>Yeah, <i>Nightlife</i> has tracks that you could play on the radio, and then there are those that should be played only to those willing to be subjected to the utmost degradation and dehumanization. How else are we supposed to describe the computer- as- metaphor conceit of ""Happiness is an Option"" (as though emotions were selected in the preferences dialog box of the human mind) or the undying irritation induced by ""Vampires.""</p>
<p>It doesn't pain me in the slightest not to delve into the swill that marks out the collaboration with Kylie Minogue (""In Denial"")-- suffice to say it's an ever- so- dramatic dialog between a daughter and her gay dad. But the rank slurry that is ""New York City Boy"" demands my attention (and your avoidance).</p>
<p>Superficially, the track is a sort of coming home song and a reply to the Boys' version of the Village People's ""Go West."" But, taking a second to examine ""New York City Boy"" (for that's all you'll need), you'll soon realize that it's actually just a blatant rip off of that song. The track boasts a chantably identical chorus in addition to the same massed choir belting out the song in the worst Andrew Lloyd Webber fashion. Tennant barely makes an appearance; I hope that his decision to cop out of vocal duties was prompted by his shame and putting his band's name to such goop.</p>
<p>One moral I've drawn from this wretched record: don't have high expectations of pop stars. Despite their protestations, they'll never fail to let you down. Despite myself, I'll seek solace in my beloved Gay Dad album.</p></div>"|6247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6247-nightlife/|3.2|Paul Cooper

    band.  Toeing the line between sloppy noise screes and sincere pop beauty,
    they peppered their songs with cryptic subculture references and served them
    up with huge ironic smirks. Sound familiar?  Nope, I'm not talking about
    Pavement; before <i>Slanted and Enchanted</i> was even a gleam in Steve
    Malkmus' flinty eye, there was Unrest and their veritable cavalcade of
    self-released cassettes and 7""s that reeked of proto-slacker chic, punkish
    energy and collector geek enthusiasm.</p><p>
<i>Malcolm X Park</i> is their second
    proper full-length, originally released on Caroline in 1988 and now seeing
    re-release through No. 6/Teenbeat.  It's a far cry from the classic Unrest
    of 1992's <i>Imperial f.f.r.r.</i> and 1993's <i>Perfect Teeth</i>, but if
    you squint just right, their metamorphosis from jokey garage band to love-pop
    crooners makes intuitive sense.</p><p>
    By today's rather conservative musical standards, <i>Malcolm X Park</i> is
    way too amateurish and scattershot to be taken seriously, but it possesses a
    certain endearing anything-goes vibe that causes it to grow on you in ways
    that would make fungi jealous.  More importantly, Unrest can actually pull
    off the dozen or so costume changes they make during <i>Malcolm X Park</i>'s
    17-track marathon, never allowing you to forget that behind all the noise, they're still just skinny
    white kids from the D.C. suburbs.
    </p><p>
    Unrest run themselves ragged through punk-flavored riffs, screams and snarls
    on the title track and ""Castro 59;"" they goof relentlessly on old-time rock 'n'
    roll on ""Ben's Chili Bowl"" and ""Stranger in My Own Hometown;"" they make it
    clear they dig Kiss the most direct way they know how-- by covering ""Strutter""
    and quoting ""I Wanna Rock and Roll All Night"" at the end of ""Disko Magic.""
    After all this, they still have time to toss off pretty pop songs like ""Can't
    Sit Still"" and ""Christina,"" as well as delicate instrumentals like ""Dalmations""
    and the album's closer, ""The Hill.""
    </p><p>
    Unrest's greatest and most frustrating asset is their lyrical obscurity; they
    drop enough hints throughout their music that you get the feeling they must
    be referring to something specific, but it's impossible to figure it out for
    sure unless you're seriously in the know. I got the Kenneth Anger reference in
    ""Lucifer Rising,"" but still have no clue as to what the fuck Mark Robinson is
    talking about during ""Castro 59"" or ""Dago Red.""
    </p><p>
    But this band's motives have always been somewhat unclear; the most sensible
    explanation is that they simply wanted to catalog their own personal obsessions
    without explicit explanation.  Listening to <i>Malcolm X Park</i> now, a
    staggering 12 years after its original release, the mystery has diminished
    a bit.  In the end, <i>Malcolm X Park</i> has its advantages and disadvantages;
    not being in on the joke won't necessarily detract from the enjoyment of hearing
    a young, inspired Mark Robinson at his strangest.

    Schwarzenbach fronts both groups. Backed by the taut, hyperkinetic rhythm section of Chris
    Bauermeister and Adam Pfaler in Jawbreaker, Blake's vocals seemed to sneer and spit in
    frustration. But in Jets to Brazil, backed by That Guy From That Band That Had That Guy From
    Quicksand and That Guy That Drummed In That Emo Band Named After That Misfits Songs, Blake's
    voice comes across as a forced Oxford affectation-- a bad Richard Butler impersonation. The
    difference is a testiment to the power of punk rock, and more importantly Chris and Adam. Let's
    be honest-- the world needs a Jawbreaker song (perhaps even the Queensrychian ""Jet Black"") over
    any Jets to Brazil keyboard ballad.</p><p>
    
    The continued trend of making live albums exclusively from one late- career performance has
    given the world some impotent live records. This basic bootlegging seems rather effortless.
    For Jawbreaker fans, it means sitting through the slower, over- thought material from <i>Dear
    You</i> instead of ""Want,"" ""Chesterfield King,"" or ""Incomplete."" ""Save Your Generation"" and
    ""Accident Prone"" are not bad songs-- and hearing them here is more economically beneficial than
    dropping $30 for a copy of the out- of- print <i>Dear You</i> on eBay-- but they're not exactly
    representative of Jawbreaker's greatest moments. It also baffles that a band would release live
    material recorded so close to their break-up. This period of a band's career has never been the
    most fruitful for ""classic live performances""-- especially when the show is a shortened set
    from a Rock for Choice benefit with the Foo Fighters.</p><p>
    
    This being said, <i>Live 4/30/96</i> merits purchase for three unreleased songs. ""Gemini"" shows
    that the band was leaning more towards the sound of <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>'s thick punk
    after the mildly disappointing <i>Dear You</i>, and ""Shirt"" similarly smokes with bratty energy.
    Thankfully, these songs' velocity never afford Blake his heavy- handed lyrical tendencies.  The
    line, ""You're not punk and I'm telling everyone/ Save your breath I never was one"" from ""Boxcar""
    punches harder than ""I have a present: It is the present/ You have to learn to find it within
    you.""</p><p>
    
    Blake's attempt at stage banter is pretty unintentionally amusing, too.  ""It's a thrill for us
    to play here... and have it be... fun,"" he mumbles between songs, stumbling through the worst
    segue of all time: ""Because we live here and it can be scary sometimes... this is about a scary
    time we had last year."" His stage presence is comparable to a shy ninth- grader's advanced-
    placement science project presentation or a disorganized DJ on low bandwidth college radio.
    The stammering nearly discredits his songwriting. Fortunately, the bubbly, larynx- booting
    rhythm section kicks in.</p><p>
    
    The representation of <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>-- namely ""Jinx Removing,"" ""Ashtray
    Monument,"" and ""Boxcar""-- still sharpen the point on Jawbreaker's flagpole claiming the land
    of Greatest Punk Band of the '90s. Then again, you can get those songs on the classic <i>24
    Hour Revenge Therapy</i>. And so we come again to the tired Live Album dismissal: for fans
    only.</p></div>"|4212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4212-live-43096/|6.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

    fearlessly experimental as Unrest-- and even fewer who would dare issue so
    many experiments on one album. Can you imagine if Jim O'Rourke released a
    record that contained his early tape-manipulation work, avant-garde guitar
    strangling, minimalist orchestral pieces, <i>and</i> a few songs from his
    current Bacharach-worship period?  It'd be pretty fucked up, and maybe even
    mind-blowing, but definitely not very listenable.  Which sums up <i>Kustom
    Karnal Blackxploitation</i> excellently.</p><p>
    Really now, how are we supposed to feel about an album with a title like that?
    And what are we supposed to think of song titles like ""Black Power Dynamo"" and
    ""Kill Whitey""?  How about a 10+ minute-long spoken-word piece about Sammy Davis,
    Jr.'s car accident?  Tuneless grunge-metal scowling like on ""Invoking the
    Godhead"" and ""Click Click""?  A jokey wah-funk song called ""The Foxey
    Playground"" where every time Mark Robinson sneers ""She's Foxey!"" it recalls
    the Beastie Boys' ""She's Crafty""?  <i>All on the same album?!</i></p><p>
    Overall, the best thing about <i>Kustom Karnal Blackxploitation</i> is that
    Unrest had sharpened their focus a bit since their previous album, the
    seven-layer-dip <i>Malcolm X Park</i> (both of which, incidentally, were
    first released by Caroline in 1988 and 1990 and are now being reissued
    through No. 6 and Teenbeat). More so than <i>Malcolm X Park</i>, <i>Kustom
    Karnal</i> reads like a catalog of Mark Robinson's various obsessions, from
    Kenneth Anger to blaxploitation films to Butch Willis, a little-known
    Beefheartian drug casualty that haunted the D.C. music scene in the mid-to-late
    80's.  While such name-checking and full-throttle irony was acceptable-- even
    cool-- back when this album first came out, these days it's a little bit harder
    to handle.
    </p><p>
    If nothing else, Unrest earned its rightful place in the indie rock canon by
    being smart enough to take the five-second snippet of the song ""Teenage Suicide""
    from the movie ""Heathers"" and complete it, turning it into a spot-on expression
    of confused adolescent melodrama. And then there's ""Chick Chelsea Delux"" and ""She
    Makes Me Shake Like a Soul Machine,"" two soft, pretty songs which point in the
    direction Unrest would take their next album, <i>Imperial f.f.r.r.</i>.  But
    these three tracks aren't quite enough to recommend <i>Kustom Karnal</i>, since
    the quality of the other songs depends entirely on your willingness to forgive
    Unrest their stylistic excesses.

    on Both Sides</i> back to back.  The result:  I spent the entire afternoon chanting the mantra,
    ""Warn Defever ain't got no soul/ Warn Defever isn't rock and roll...""  And, frankly he doesn't
    and he isn't, at least not this time out.  For <i>100 Years</i>, His Name is Alive's chief 
    executive oddball assembled 11 faux-folk originals and a Willie Nelson cover, gave his various
    ethereal female vocalists the day off, put aside his normal bag of production tricks and just
    recorded himself playing the guitar and actually singing for a change.</p><p>
    
    The result, not surprisingly, is one strange little album.  The songs are interspersed with 
    excerpts from a bizarre record featuring a man (coincidentally named Warren) capable of producing
    uncanny imitations of saws, trains, chickens, and fire dogs.  These interludes add a sort of
    texture to the experience of the album, turning it into an impossible found document, perhaps
    discovered among the contents of a recently uncorked time capsule.</p><p>
    
    The songs themselves aren't far off from imitations of popular music from an alternate past.  Good,
    old fashioned hearth-side singalongs, Depression-era blues and imaginary Baptist hymns are mixed
    with bizarre lyrical turns (""The food I like is natural food, wooden fork and wooden spoon"") to
    reconstruct a musical tradition that never exactly existed to begin with.  The effect is heightened
    by low fidelity recording techniques and the fact that Defever, in his characteristic duplicity,
    has shrouded the album in the sonic equivalent of a layer of dust, water stains and scratches.</p><p>
    
    Underneath the crud are some excellent songs.  Defever's songwriting is at the heart of His Name
    is Alive, and this setting creates a fascinating picture of what a HNIA album might be like in its
    nascency.  It's easy to imagine any of these songs suddenly transformed by Defever's hand into a 
    dub anthem or a tape-spliced surf-rock freakout; that he resists those temptations proves
    surprisingly gratifying.</p><p>
    
    Cynics will say that Defever really shouldn't be singing-- hey, they've said the same thing about 
    Mos Def-- and it's true that this album sheds some light on his decision to remain silent through
    most of His Name is Alive's material.  Somehow, though, his quavering voice is oddly endearing on
    <i>100 Years</i>, and the album's 31-minute running time gives the songs room to breathe without
    grating.</p><p>
    
    Though it's most likely to appeal to rabid His Name is Alive fans and elderly Mormons nostalgic for
    their pioneering days, <i>I Want You to Live 100 Years</i> is a fascinating album and well worth 
    looking into.</p></div>"|2259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2259-i-want-you-to-live-100-years/|7.0|Zach Hooker

In the beginning was the deed. This is the first line of Goethe's
    <i>Faust</i> and arguably the most famous words in the German language. The opening lines of the
    Gospel of John, ""In the beginning was the Word"" are inverted in a penstroke. The whole Christian
    tradition is turned on its head. We do not originate in the benediction of an incarnated word,
    but in the hazard of an unmediated act. That single line contains an entire manifesto of work,
    the rough beauty of human effort and human suffering. Can anything be quite as Protestant,
    quite as German as that?</p><p>
    If ever there was a band to whom the Protestant work ethic could be applied, it is undoubtedly
    Can. If there was music that discarded the timelessness of pop for the earthbound temporality of
    experimentation, it is Can music. The sound of Can is the sound of labor, of unbelievable human
    exertion. Other collective improvisers like the Mahavishnu Orchestra approach the idiom of the
    mystical, while Can seems geared for construction. They had mastered a true industrial sound
    before that term was squandered on the sound of sparse rhythm and dreary, martial noise under
    Genesis P. Orange screaming: ""Discipline!"" ad nauseam.  Can is itself an industry. Indeed, an
    industrial revolution. Their product strains description.</p><p>
    The double disc <i>Box Music (1971-1977)</i> also eludes language. If architecture is frozen
    music, then Can is liquid architecture. These five men build earthworks so impossibly elaborate
    that it cannot even survive the process of its own construction: when the workmen have disappeared,
    so has the building. <i>Box Music</i> outstrips the tight tapeloop experimentalism of classics
    like <i>Tago Mago</i> and <i>Future Days</i> precisely because it is so heavy, so material: Jaki
    Leibezeit's jackhammer drums, the pig-iron slabs of Holger Czukay's bass, Irmin Schmidt's bright
    sheet metal keyboards, and the relentless industrial drill of Michael Karoli's guitars. The
    cumulative effect would be machine-like if the collective sound were not so violent and haphazard.
    The music remains organic because it sweats and suffers; you can hear fatigue and elation, strategy
    and struggle. Silence is weakness.</p><p>
<i>Box Music</i> culls non-professional recordings-- mostly cassette-- from the group's most
    experimental years, the years when Japanese street poet Damo Suzuki handled the vocals, following
    the departure of their original lead singer, the African-American Malcolm Mooney (who actually
    appears on a track from 1975). Suzuki's role on <i>Box Music</i> is somewhat limited, but then
    again, Can's music was never driven by vocals. The sound is too intensely collective to allow
    space for a single voice, almost tribal. The title of their earliest recordings captures it:
    <i>Future Primitive</i>. One can never tell whether it's the music of civilization coming or going.
    It is always devouring itself.</p><p>
    The 14-minute ""Voo Doo Right"" from a 1975 show, is tribal savagery at its zenith, spiraling guitar
    and keyboards into a huge bonfire, burning over wartime drums. The audience applauding cannot even
    disrupt the listener; the whole affair approaches religion. The pyre skitters out into tight,
    phase-shifted funk as Schmidt's keyboards surface. Karoli's guitar is lyrical and lysergic, looping
    the upper air in serpentine passes before devolving into mechanized crunch. There is a momentary
    interlude of jagged no wave exchange of sloppy strums and broken drums, coalescing into a graceful
    bluesy reunion.</p><p>
    The jazz-fusion of ""Fizz"" and the calypso-classical of ""Cascade Waltz"" reveal a sense of humor that
    would be unthinkable in the fractured noise of the 37-seven minute ""Colchester Finale"" from 1972.
    ""Colchester"" completely dominates the second disc of the collection, chugging sloppily along like
    the Velvet Underground's locomotive signature ""Sister Ray"" in space. Suzuki's beat whispering is
    unnerving, rinsing in and out with the lightning cymbals, occasionally lashing out as sadistic
    howls. The recording on ""Colchester"" is wretched, but the low fidelity effect is perfect. Flying
    Saucer Attack might have been born out of this matrimony of lockstep synchronicity and dead,
    white interference.</p><p>
    Eventually, the reviewer must concede that <i>Box Music</i> is simply a critical black hole,
    swallowing every turn-of-phrase lightlessly; it will evade all my descriptions, comparisons and
    evaluations. Nobody's thoughts can keep up with this music. It was born of deed, not of word; it
    is from a time before or after language. <i>Box Music</i> is perfect work, pure expenditure.
    Like a fire, it takes everything into itself, into its own all-consuming energy. All these words
    we can toss on the fire, because you and I, we can't even come close.</p></div>"|1271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1271-box-music-live-1971-1977/|9.5|Brent S. Sirota

    Happiness</i>, an album that asked a lot of questions and never answered any of
    them.  For example, our neighbors are still wondering what that bizarre, strangled
    moan was.  And the Violent Femmes' Gordon Gano is still wondering who made off
    with his vocal chords.  I, of course, am wondering how anybody could possibly
    have so much to worry about at the age of 19.  Actually, now that I think of it,
    Bill Gates was 19 when he made his first million (probably).  And in that respect,
    you could say Oberst is the Bill Gates of mid-western adolescent rage-- he's got
    way more than any of us will ever need.</p><p>
    
    Now, somebody once said that money can buy a certain amount of happiness, but after
    that, all it can get is more money.  Ditto to Midwestern adolescent rage, if you
    substitute ""punk rock"" for happiness.  There exists a threshold for yelling and
    screaming about how much stuff sucks, and crossing that threshold cam only make
    your music suck, too.  Thankfully, Bright Eyes doesn't cross that line.  Oh, but
    he's toeing it!  Those of us who don't spend our days sitting in our bedrooms
    counting spiders may find the occasional lyric here cringe-inducing.</p><p>
    
    But for the most part, Bright Eyes writes songs that are unlike most other peoples'
    songs.  Despite the aforementioned similarity to early Violent Femmes, and the
    annoying fact that this EP's best song (""A Perfect Sonnet"") pretty much mimics
    Soul Asylum's ""Runaway Train,"" the five tracks here are pretty unique.  Oberst's
    death-obsessed lyrics may be tough to swallow now and then, but when they hit their
    mark, they're undeniable.</p><p>
    
    The instrumentation on <i>Every Day, Every Night</i> is varied and accomplished, and
    flaunts the same raw production values that made Elliott Smith's <i>Either/Or</i>
    sound both graceful and believable.  It also doesn't hurt that Oberst's voice is
    left a little lower in the mix.  To supplement the acoustic guitar, Bright Eyes
    draws sounds from an array of sources, from backwards drums to Chinese language
    tapes.  And somehow, the various bits never seem gratuitous or disingenuous.</p><p>
    
    What seems most important about these songs, though, is that they never really
    become self-indulgent.  As more and more schmoes out there scrape up a couple of
    bucks to buy guitars and four-tracks, it's becoming increasingly important to set
    some standards.  (Hey, no one wants to wade through EPs from every third person in
    America.)  The ongoing democratization of music could be either a miracle or a
    disaster.  It's just good to know that there are people like Connor Oberst out
    there raising the bar.</p></div>"|942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/942-every-day-and-every-night-ep/|7.2|Zach Hooker

    Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium, I found myself contemplating the band's meandering history
    and its latest release, <i>The Days of Our Nights</i>.  In the context of Beulah's inspired
    opening set, Luna's Dean Wareham is easily pegged as a progenitor of '90s indie rock.  His
    seminal band Galaxie 500 set the table in the late '80s, updating the Velvet Underground's
    rhythm guitar- based rock and serving as a reference point for the explosion of indie bands
    that would crowd the coming decade.  Just as it's hard to imagine Galaxie 500 or Luna without
    the Velvets, imagining Beulah without Wareham's work is equally as difficult.</p><p>
    
    Upon first hearing the news that Wareham had left Galaxie 500 to team with the Feelies' drummer,
    Stanley Demenski, I remember thinking it was a good idea. And largely, it's been one.  With
    Luna, Wareham has produced a consistent if not earth- shattering catalog in the '90s, never
    quite matching the surreal jamming and energetic brilliance of their first effort, 1992's
    <i>Lunapark</i>, but never quite embarrassing himself, either.  Somewhere between 1995's
    <i>Penthouse</i> and 1997's <i>Pup Tent</i> (which also marked Demenski's departure) the band
    shifted to a warmer, more sultry sound-- a trend not entirely abandoned on <i>The Days of Our
    Nights</i>, and most evident on the album's opener, ""Dear Diary.""</p><p>
    
    Heard amidst favorites from throughout the band's career (unlike many long- lived recording
    artists, Wareham seems neither in denial nor ashamed of his past), the songs off the new album
    blend nicely.  ""Superfreaky Memories"" is this album's ""Bobby Peru,"" an instant pop gem, while
    ""Four Thousand Days"" and ""Seven Steps to Satan"" both mark a return to the band's more
    instrumental, Velvets roots.  That the album so effectively captures the band's sound is to
    its detriment, though, as the songs lack some innovation and surprise.  Where <i>Pup Tent</i>
    seemed a step up for the band, <i>Days</i> is another <i>Penthouse</i>- ish respite.  ""The
    Slow Song"" is another creepy foreign language affair, while their cover of Guns N' Roses'
    ""Sweet Child o' Mine,"" comes off disappointingly similar to what one imagines it to be.</p><p>
    
    There's a story to this album, too-- one that will likely taint most consideration of it.
    Dropped by Elektra just before the album's scheduled release earlier this year, the band and
    album sat in limbo through the summer and early fall until Luna hooked up with Jericho Records.
    Thus, <i>The Days of Our Nights</i> carries with it the added weight of anticipation and the
    aura of transition sparked by a label change.  Considered correctly, however, outside this
    context (after all, the change was not made on an artistic basis), the album is the estimable
    follow- up to <i>Pup Tent</i>, and neither ground- breaking or transitional.  Yep, it's a
    Luna album, alright.  But as we've come to expect, it isn't half bad at all.</p></div>"|4917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4917-the-days-of-our-nights/|6.8|Neil Lieberman

The hyperdimensional
    elves are here with me again, but they appear to be on a coffee break this
    time. Usually when I visit, they're hard at work weaving the fabric of the
    universe from superstrings; now, though, they're dancing amongst these
    wispy clouds that seem to have music emanating from them. It sounds
    like... well, like the kind of music that hyperdimensional elves would
    dance to. The clouds bounce around in a sort of Brownian motion as the
    elves dance, but when I try to reach out to touch one, it evaporates in
    a chilly mist. I try to ask one of the elves what the music is, but my
    mouth is made of foam, and the word bubbles float away without popping.</p><p>
    
    Then I wake up and go to this party. It's one of those faux- classy
    casual- formal affairs that I feel compelled to attend because I'm
    supposedly an ""adult"" now.  Anyway, the party's dull and I barely know
    anyone. At least the bar is fully stocked. As I mix myself my fourth Sidecar,
    I begin hearing it again... the music. I experience a brief moment of inward
    panic: am I having some sort of drug flashback? I follow the music to the
    huge speakers in the corner of the living room, but with each step I take
    towards the stereo, the music grows quieter. When I stand directly in front
    of the speakers, I hear nothing except the low- level chatter of the party.</p><p>
    
    I feel the presence of a person next to me. ""You like?"" A woman's voice
    says. I pause. No one has spoken a single word to me since I arrived.
    Am I being hit on? Am I obviously so drunk as to be an easy target for some
    freakish desperate person? I don't turn to face her, but instead attempt to
    exude an exterior of detached cool. ""What is it?"" I ask offhandedly. ""Guess,""
    she says. ""Hmm..."" I hum. ""I can't tell...""</p><p>
    
    ""You can't hear it because you're listening to it,"" she says.  ""You must learn
    not to listen to it in order to listen to it.""</p><p>
    
    My bluff was called.  ""Uh... how?"" I ask.</p><p>
    
    I feel someone take my hand. ""Dance with me,"" she says.</p><p>
    
    We dance. She holds me so closely that I still can't see her face. Her
    hair smells faintly of cookies. She whispers into my ear, ""Now do you hear?""
    ""I do,"" I say. It's some sort of retro- futuristic easy- listening lounge
    music, except it's very... strange. Chirpy, yet laid- back. ""That singer
    sounds like Laetitia Sadier from Stereolab.""</p><p>
    
    ""It is,"" she says.</p><p>
    
    ""But it's not Stereolab, because there's a guy singing too,"" I say.</p><p>
    
    ""No, it isn't Stereolab,"" she says.</p><p>
    
    ""Well, it's definitely not Combustible Edison,"" I say.</p><p>
    
    We continue to dance, not listening to the music. ""Why can't I hear the
    music when I try to listen to it?"" I ask.  She says, ""Because it ceases to
    exist when you do. It's only meant to provide atmosphere, not to act as
    the center of attention. Is that not the nature of all music?""</p><p>
    
    I am taken aback. ""No, it isn't,"" I blurt out. ""Music shouldn't exist as
    mere sonic punctuation unworthy of closer inspection.""</p><p>
    
    I feel her tense up slightly. ""What are you saying?"" she asks. ""Are you
    saying you don't like this music?""</p><p>
    
    I know I have offended her somehow, but keep talking nonetheless. ""Well,
    what good is music if you can't listen to it? What good is it if you can
    only perceive it peripherally, but never directly?""</p><p>
    
    ""It's just <i>fine</i> the way it is,"" she says, a trace of anger in her
    voice.</p><p>
    
    ""No, no, it's not,"" I say. I don't know why I persist-- maybe I'm more
    drunk than I thought. ""It's not that it's necessarily bad, I mean, it's
    pleasant enough to listen to like this, but it's really the only way to
    listen to it. It carries no emotional weight. It's pretty, but it's
    empty.""</p><p>
    
    ""How dare you!"" she says, casting me aside and stomping away. I lay on the
    floor, disoriented, looking up at the stern faces of the other partygoers.
    ""Why did you have to do that? Do you realize you've ruined a perfectly good 
    party again? Don't you know who that was?"" Looking at the now-hazy figure 
    storming from the room, I suddenly come to a horrific realization...</p></div>"|3855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3855-snowbug/|5.8|Nick Mirov

The crowd
    was a tan sea of fraternity types who likely showed up because Sonic Youth is, like, really
    loud. When Ian Svenonius grabbed the mic (and his crotch) and began yelping like Prince was
    bursting through his chest, the fraternity types looked at each other silently and decided in
    a wave of raised eyebrows that this singer was a ""pussy."" The heckling soon followed. Even
    before a mob of extracurricular athletes Ian Svenonius continued to scream bloody soul. If
    anything, the man had frightening conviction. These were the ""formative years"" of the Make-Up.</p><p>
    
    Now what are those fraternity types up to? Most likely they're consultants of some sort who
    drive Altimas. They probably spent $85 to see Bruce Springsteen at the Target Center. Yet,
    somehow, strangely, those guys might dig the new Make-Up record. ...Well, okay, it's more
    likely they'll dig the new Tonic album, but I can dream of a rock renaissance.</p><p>
<i>Save Yourself</i> smells like the '60s. It smells like leather Chevy seats soaked with ass
    sweat. It smells like incense and pepper. It smells like stems and seeds on a cardboard record
    sleeve.  This greasy, haunted spectre of a record bears disturbed spirits of bands long dead,
    like the Doors, the Rolling Stones, and Prince. The band brilliantly and concisely sums their
    image with the song title ""White Belt."" In the mouth of Beck, this might come across as a retro
    songwriting prop. Yet the Make-Up spit ""White Belt"" like activists, and that track spanks
    ridiculously funky keys like the soundtrack to a Black Panther being chased in his Nova.</p><p>
<i>Save Yourself</i> stubbornly eats from the salad days of rock and roll, specifically the
    late '60s, as contemporary music continues to spin toward sardonic Pro-Tools pastiches. The
    album can proudly stand next to the Rolling Stones' <i>Between the Buttons</i> in even the
    baldest, pony- tailedest guitar shop employee's collection. Raw and clean with a touch of
    psychedelica, <i>Save Yourself</i> punches the perfect buttons with devilish effeciency.</p><p>
    
    These obviously analog, airy recording techiniques in an era of digital gloss feel like a 
    juicy peach after a diet of Mesquite Fritos. Somehow, even a Jimi Hendrix cover manages to
    sound tougher and more vital 30 years after the original. It's amazing that most of the
    Make-Up's post- Nation of Ulysses fanbase has dropped off as the band has steadily grown into
    America's rock and roll saviors. The Make-Up approach the history of rock and soul like a
    lover, like a scientist, and like a preacher. This record can make even the most jaded Punk
    Planet columnist proud to be an American. The British had their day in the '60s-- now they'll
    have to settle for the Manic Street Preachers.</p></div>"|5053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5053-save-yourself/|8.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

    early '90s riot-grrl movement.  When Bikini Kill formed in the late '80s, their mix of catchy
    punk tunes and hard-hitting politics were a timely wake-up call to the male-dominated
    alternative rock scene in the Pacific Northwest, positioning the band as icons and role models
    to girls across the country.  But cultural climates change quickly and alarms are intended to
    wake people up, not to go off all day.  Once the shock of the new of the riot-grrl movement
    wore thin, few were listening short of riot-grrls themselves.</p><p>
    Rather than continuing to preach to the choir, Hanna has called off mass in favor of a dance
    party.  As Le Tigre, she teams up with fanzine producer Johanna Fateman and independent video
    and filmmaker Sadie Benning.  Let's compare Le Tigre's self-titled debut to the most famous
    use of music for political ends ever.</p><p>
    CASE STUDY #1: THE USES AND ABUSES OF FLEETWOOD MAC IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE<br/>
<i>Hypothetical excerpt from a transcript of a Clinton campaign strategizing sessions:</i></p><p>
    Bill Clinton: I think people are saying we will stop.  What's up with that?</p><p>
    George Stephanopolous: Bill, don't stop!</p><p>
    Bill Clinton:  Stop what?  Hey, I saw that fine program, ""Behind the Music: The Stevie Nicks
    Story"" for the 10th time on VH1 again this afternoon.  Do you think either of you boys could
    arrange for Stevie to drop by the White House tomorrow evening?</p><p>
    James Carville: Look, Bill. As your advisor I have to tell you, I don't think getting any
    further ""behind her music"" will help your presidential campaign.</p><p>
    George Stephanopolous: Actually, James, you are totally wrong.  It's perfect! <i>[singing:]</i>
    Don't/ Stop/ Thinking about tomorrow/ Don't/ Stop/ It'll soon be here...</p><p>
    Bill Clinton:  I won't stop thinking! James, did you find Stevie's number?  I could be her
    Silver Spring! I know I could do it!  Do you think she's available tomorrow?</p><p>
    The rest is history.  Fleetwood Mac's ""Don't Stop"" was programmed to play on repeat at the
    Democratic National Convention, culminating in an unforgettable saxophone rendition of the
    classic by Clinton's recovering brother, ""Roj,"" and the song became inextricably tied to
    Clinton's campaign.</p><p>
    ""Don't Stop"" was then put in higher rotation by so-called-leftist media outlets such as Easy
    Listening KISS 105.1FM to bolster the Democrats in the Presidential race. Yet, there was no
    obligation to report the airplay as campaign spending.  Meanwhile, the target demographic
    car-danced to the album in their yuppie-mobiles all the way to the voting booth.  Money spent
    on broadcasting ""Don't Stop"" across America was softer than wet camel food (an anagram for
    Fleetwood Mac).  Outcome: a Landslide!  ""Don't Stop"" was played at the inaugural gala.</p><p>
    CASE STUDY #2: THE POTENTIAL OF LE TIGRE IN THE CULTURAL AND POLITICAL SPHERES<br/>
<i>Hypothetical excerpt from a transcript a Le Tigre campaign strategizing sessions:</i></p><p>
    Kathleen Hanna: I think people are saying we will stop.  What's up with that?</p><p>
    Johanna Fateman:  Kathleen, don't stop!</p><p>
    Kathleen Hanna:  People are saying that ""girl-rock"" is either angry and aggressive replays of
    riot-grrl clich√©'s or over-produced bubblegum schlock.</p><p>
    Johanna Fateman: Well, sure, there's a lot of crap out there.  But there's also a lot of stuff
    out there that doesn't fit into either of those categories.  I mean, Kathleen, you're like the
    riot poster-grrl, and even if your last project as Julie Ruin wasn't incredibly successful, it
    certainly wasn't riot-grrl clich√©.</p><p>
    Kathleen Hanna: Do you think we could make a record that more girls and boys listen to without
    abandoning the politics that inspire our music?  The music could then inspire the girls'
    <i>and</i> boys' politics!</p><p>
    Johanna Fateman: We could sugar the pill!  Coat our politics in pop that's a little bit easier
    to swallow.</p><p>
    Sadie Benning: Sugar the Pill?!  Why not go all the way and lace our feminist lyrics with
    pop-crack?!  Even the boys will like our pop-crack!</p><p>
    RECIPE FOR LE TIGRE POP-CRACK:</p><p>
    1. Take basic garage rock song structures that make you want to sing along and update them with
    some pop, punk, and surf-guitar.  Think Slits, Raincoats, and later Bikini Kill in a blender.</p><p>
    2. Layer the songs with lots of samples to create atmospheres that will inevitably be described
    as ""cinematic.""</p><p>
    3. Frost the songs with hip-hop-infused drum machines, old-school electronics and new wave
    keyboards.</p><p>
    These songs are addictive.  They will be the soundtrack to kitchen dance parties in every house
    this album enters.  Le Tigre brought their multimedia dance party to Providence, Rhode Island a
    few weeks ago and I went to buy the album a few days later.  I needed the crack, and I wasn't
    alone.  Right now, Le Tigre is the Amazon.com's #2 best-selling album to University Students in
    Rhode Island!</p><p>
    The lyrics are less didactic than Bikini Kill's and are geared for the repeated listens these
    well-crafted pop songs beg for.  The catchy ""Hot Topic"" includes a list of musicians, writers
    and activists whose work deals with ""hot topics."" The chorus repeats: ""Hot topic is the way
    that we rhyme.""  Hanna sings, ""You're getting old/ That's what they say/ But don't give a damn/
    I'm listening anyway.""  Remember how people raced to figure out who all those names were in
    Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" and Madonna's ""Vogue?""  ""Hot Topic"" will work the same
    way.  Most listeners will already recognize names like Joan Jett and Sleater-Kinney, but what
    about Billy Tipton and Vaginal Cream Davis?</p><p>
<i>Le Tigre</i> leads off with ""Deceptacon,"" a hook-driven number that satiates your desire for
    no-strings-attached entertainment with lyrics such as, ""Wanna disco?/ Wanna see me disco?/ Let
    me hear you depoliticize my rhyme,"" and then moves into a lament on the lack of meaningful
    lyrics in popular rock.  The band also takes a shot at experimentalism with ""Slideshow at a
    Free University"" and ""Dude Yr So Crazy,"" which pairs a collage of descriptive phrases with a
    sound-loop that humorlessly conjures stalkers and psychopaths from classic American films.</p><p>
    Radical feminist and anarchist Emma Goldman once said, ""I don't want to be part of your
    revolution if I can't dance."" Like Fleetwood Mac before them (but with more politically
    relevant lyrics than, ""All I want is to see you smile/ If it takes just a little while""), Le
    Tigre's debut will provide anthems for their target demographic.  Fleetwood Mac reached out
    to hippies and people who liked to look at Mick Fleetwood's faux-testicles.  Le Tigre aims
    for anyone interested in an addictive pastiche that could ultimately lead to metaphorical
    ""voting-booths"" for the cultural and political issues they're singing about.</p></div>"|4703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4703-le-tigre/|8.5|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    rock for a few years, and now have two sublime albums and a lengthy EP, all on Kindercore 
    Records, to their credit. Their latest effort, <i>I Like You When You're Not 
    Around</i>, is chock- full of the homey melodies, shuffling beats, wry
    lyrical twists, and guitars that range from sweetly- plucked to fully
    fuzzed- out that made their first two records so appealing. Co-singer/
    guitarists Peter Hoffman and Timothy Bracy both sing as if they're half-
    asleep with a mouthful of mashed potatoes (which is a shame when they're
    singing lines as great as ""Three A.M./ You're crawling 'neath the bar
    stools/ Tying together some poor fucker's shoes/ Whispering the Catholic
    girl's blues/ In coffee shops and neon bars/ All the places we played
    cards/ We are not welcome anymore"" on ""You Twitch When You Dream"").</p><p>
    Many of the songs on <i>When You're Not Around</i> have a small town feel
    to them-- most of them are about nothing more profound than hanging out
    with friends, getting drunk, and complaining about crappy relationships.
    The songs themselves range from quiet, navel- gazing contemplative numbers 
    (""Social Thursday,"" ""The Kissing Rocks"") to relentless rockers (""Pushing 
    Buttons,"" ""An Enterprising Molecule"") with pretty much everything you can 
    think of thrown in between, from slightly psychedelic instrumentals to 
    brilliant power-pop.  There's even a self- proclaimed ""new wave"" tune
    (""We'll Never Make the Final Reel"").</p><p>
    But for all its musical variation, pretty much all of the songs on the
    record carry the same bleary- eyed, back- porch kinda vibe that lends
    the album, depending on your point of view, either a numbing, pharmaceutical
    sameness, or a sleepy, comfortable ambience akin to your favorite flannel
    shirt. I guess my main complaint with <i>When You're Not Around</i> is that,
    for some odd reason, they only included lyrics to about half the songs.
    This means that, aside from the few catchphrases that manage to break
    through the hung- over mumble of the Mendoza Line's vocalists, many of the 
    subtle nuances of the songs are lost because, without a lyric sheet,
    Bracy and Hoffman's utterances are pretty unintelligible.  Let me put it
    this way: if you like the new Pavement record but just wish that Steve
    Malkmus would quit enunciating his words so clearly (or if you're just
    down with that aforementioned utterly lovable back porch- style indie rock),
    you should be handing your $12 over to these guys.</p></div>"|5227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5227-i-like-you-when-youre-not-around/|7.5|Jeremy Schneyer

    North America that didn't quite hold. Walk the streets on a Sunday night-- it's completely
    empty. Even the residents seem resigned to the city's shortcoming. Walking back from the
    waterfront at dark, I encountered no one. The subway (which had a lengthy French acronym
    that slips my mind) was deserted.</p><p>
    
    My stop was Olympic Park, a ghost colony of decaying sports facilities and lawns on the west
    outskirts. The entire complex was abandoned in the 70's.  The domed stadium juts from the
    grass like an Atlantaen ship poured of molten bone.  The giant vertebrae-shaped structure
    seems slick, but closer inspection reveals fissures and chips. In fact, the removable roof
    never works. Limp cables keep the dome closed eternally.  Rumor has it that a baseball team
    still occasionally plays there.</p><p>
    
    Understandably, this is the home of Fly Pan Am.  Their very name suggests rusted nostalgia,
    cosmopolitanism, and sleek hipness.  Unfortunately, Pan Am hasn't flown in quite some time.
    The few memories we have now are of blue stewardesses, hijacks, and disaster. This spectre
    haunts the self-titled LP from these instrumental Canadians</p><p>
    
    The music is Pluto stark; it
    cushions like stucco. Guitars clink like windchimes over subtly rumbling bass. Cold samples
    hover above the skeleton. When a female chorus suddenly appears deep in the album, it feels
    like a sprout in ice. Wires turn to wings. If Mogwai weren't concerned with film directors
    and pop stars, they might make such bold statements. Yet, arctic urban ambiance clouds the
    middle bulk of this album, turning the record into an unwanted lecture on art. It could either
    be the sound of someone starting a tractor across a frozen field or a low-volume cricket.</p><p>
    
    When the band settles into pulsating ghost-rock, the sly bass and humming guitars can rise a
    spectre from the corpse.  Otherwise, it's much like Montreal at night-- isolated, foggy, and
    filled with structures and shadows borrowed from better places and times.  A snowfall can be
    beautiful in its first hour, but it inevitably becomes gray slush.</p></div>"|3119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3119-fly-pan-am/|6.7|Brent DiCrescenzo

    a rainy, cold January Saturday night. It was me, your trusty (though sometimes
    foolhardy) reviewer, the hippie chick, and Penetrating Gaze Man-- that is our
    family unit. As the rain hissed on the streets outside, the wind whipping, we
    sat around and played cards, smoked a bowl and listened to Faithless. Always
    eager to survey the opinions of my peers, I quietly cheated while observing
    their reaction to the music.</p><p>
    
    Hippie chick was characteristically silent, not reacting positively nor
    negatively. She smirked, threw cards, and smirked some more. Penetrating Gaze
    Man was not so reserved. He fixed his gaze-- which is indeed penetrating-- upon
    mine and said, ""This is pure eurotrash, man."" When you put a penetrating gaze
    and a deep comment like that together, y'know whatcher got? A review, my
    friend, a review.</p><p>
    
    Despite my initial delight at the first couple of tracks, which could be
    likened to <i>Blue Lines</i>- era Massive Attack, I could feel only horror
    when I realized that his penetrating gaze concealed an stoic musical erudition
    not often seen. I perked my ear up, and indeed, we were listening to
    exceptionally vapid eurotrash.</p><p>
     
    My friend turned to the speaker and mocked, ""This is the time on sprockets
    when we dance,"" his hands gaily twitching from under his armpits, his cheeks
    sucked in, his gaze, as always, penetrating. I laughed, cheated some more, and
    reflected on my disappointment with the record. The rain hissed outside and
    hippie chick smiled at me.</p><p>
    
    Penetrating Gaze Man was right. Here's the dope: the first four tracks hold up,
    the rest of the record is beat. I like house, but this shit is weak, sounding
    like the <i>least</i> interesting or engaging house this side of 1989. It
    lacks verve, takes no risks, and smells worse than my stinky britches.</p><p>
    
    Eventually I wound up in bed.  It might have been real, or it might have
    been a dream, but I recollect something... strange. The scent of patchouli
    filled my nose and I knew hippie chick was near. I felt the tickle of her hair
    against my neck, a warm breath fluttered in my ear and a single whispered word

    He's a singer, songwriter, poet and artist.  Oh, and he's also a damned fine 
    Leonard Cohen impersonator.</p><p>
    
    Okay, that last part's not true, and it's probably a bit unfair, too-- Simon
    Joyner is no one's clone. (I just wanted to get my crass, hackneyed comparisons
    out of the way as early as possible before I started in with my crass, hackneyed
    flattery.) However, if Joyner is not Leonard Cohen's clone, he's at least Cohen's
    musical descendant.</p><p>
    
    Joyner carries high the torch that songwriters such as Cohen, Nick Drake and all
    the other pasty- faced, sad little boys have lit with their own moody, gothic
    songwriting.  And, if what I've heard on Joyner's latest release, the subtle,
    stylish ode to depression known as <i>The Lousy Dance</i>, holds out for another
    album or two, Joyner may have some heat of his own to add to that sad, slow-
    flickering flame.</p><p>
    
    When taken from beginning to end, <i>The Lousy Dance</i> comes across more like
    a novel, an opera or some other grand- scale piece of art than just another pop
    record.  Pulling in an orchestra of instruments-- everything from the electric
    guitar to the trombone to the steel guitar to the flugelhorn (which, up until this
    album, I never really thought existed... it's always been the Bigfoot of musical
    instruments for me)-- the very musical scope of the album is grand.  As we pass
    through these eight lengthy tracks, Joyner crafts story after story that carries
    the listener through bad relationships, sad lives, lonely lovers and dark, rainy 
    street corners.</p><p>
    
    With lyrics that could hold their own against some great musical poets, Joyner
    picks apart his subjects with a verbal cleverness and eye for detail that has been
    lacking in recent generations of music. In his lines, he captures emotions like
    other people catch butterflies.  Then, he spreads their wings, looks at their
    colors to determine what species they are, and lets them go.</p><p>
    
    Laying a solid yet emotionally- charged soundtrack to these stories, Joyner's 
    music stays consistent in both sound and quality from track to track. It's a 
    country- tingled, bluesy groove that's too slow to be rock and too complex to 
    be country or blues.  Mix that with orchestral flourishes, the occasional squeal
    of a horn section, a lick from an acoustic guitar, and that tried- and- true sad
    song instrument, the piano, and you get the idea.  Luckily, Joyner's skilled
    enough with arrangements to blend all these sounds together seamlessly, creating
    one immaculately produced, immaculately beautiful album.</p><p>
    
    Granted, this is a much more personal and soulful sound than is probably
    fashionable right now.  But <i>The Lousy Dance</i> is a perfect example of an 
    album that was written for the songwriter than for the faceless, anonymous
    listening public.  However, the merit of this introspective and lonesome album
    is that Joyner is able to express his fears and heartaches so eloquently that the
    personal becomes the public.  His issues start to matter, as they reflect our own 
    issues, with the music and lyrics morphing into some strange universal language
    that we can all understand.</p><p>
    
    In your best friend, this level of melodrama would be irritating as hell, but on
    an album as masterful as <i>The Lousy Dance</i>, this tension is brilliant,
    seducing the listener, playing up to their sympathies and fears, and dragging
    them into the dark, cold lives of these songs.  In a nutshell, Simon Joyner is a
    true man of talent who has managed to make an album that feels genuinely haunted.</p><p>
    
    But, shameless praise aside, if you're a technical perfectionist, there are a few
    instances on <i>The Lousy Dance</i>-- not many, but a few-- that will have you 
    driving pencils into your ears as Joyner's voice warbles like a see-saw. Joyner's
    voice tends to crack and fail, forever on the edge of breaking, with the heavy
    suffering and sweeping emotion of the recently dumped.</p><p>
    
    On any album full of ballads, it's hard to make any one track stand out above the
    other. The songs will usually bleed together in a fragrant, violet- colored ocean
    that's more likely to put you to sleep than grab your attention.  But here, once
    again, Joyner proves his talent by avoiding even this, the most heinous, ball-
    smashing, cliched trap a sad album can stumble into.</p><p>
    
    Although it seems at first that the soft melodies and lightly sung vocals of <i>The
    Lousy Dance</i> would be great for lulling even the fussiest of babies to Sleepy-Land,
    Joyner's creative songwriting and vivid lyrics keep your mind buzzing. It's that level
    of intelligence and creativity that keeps this record from being just another sappy
    album. It's also Joyner's raw charisma, combined with his talent and the naked,
    unarmored emotion of his songs that will hopefully snag him the critical and economic 
    success he clearly deserves.  And maybe that'll cheer him up, but for the listener's
    sake, let's hope not.</p></div>"|4305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4305-the-lousy-dance/|7.8|Steven Byrd

Ever wonder why it takes     him so long to get our discs to us to review? Because he's portioning out holy recompense for     each of our virtues and each of our transgressions. Every time he sends out that big list of     review discs to the Pitchfork writers he seems to say, just like God: ""I have set life and death     before you this day. Choose life."" I have actually caught him on occasion wearing an oversized     white t-shirt with CHOOSE LIFE written in big letters, to reinforce his message. I asked if he     had any fingerless fluorescent gloves to go along with it and he punched me in the stomach. I     asked him to ""help me up before you go-go"" and he kicked me in the back. I swear if it weren't     for all the money and the floozies, I'd have a good mind to quit this job.</p>
<p>Ah, poetic justice! Not the casual ass-whooping-- those are just par for the course. Rather the     irrevocable fact that I am inevitably compensated for my pretensions with every piece of     avant-jazz, experimental noise or Kranky-style cerebral post-rock that traffics through the     front offices at One Pitchfork Way. Every shipment of discs I get seem to scream: deconstruct     this, you prick! And so, I find myself on the business end of an OED and a dog-eared copy of     Adorno, trying to come up with two dozen different ways of saying the word ""groove"" without     being implicated in a bourgeois aesthetic ideology. Goddamnit, how many discs can I describe     as ""Kafkaesque"" without eventually losing every last shred of credibility? I don't even know     what rock music sounds like anymore.</p>
<p>What's in the mail today? A McArthur fellow fronting reinterpretations of the free jazz work of     an obscure Jamaican alto player. See what I mean?</p>
<p>The contributions of Joe Harriott (1928-1973) to the free-improv movement have largely gone     unnoticed. Branded a follower of the celebrated free jazz pioneer, Ornette Coleman, Harriott     didn't live long enough-- nor famously enough-- to have the world take pause at his radical     innovations in modal jazz. Students now suggest that the London-based Harriott and the American     Ornette developed their compositional and improvisational technique in near-total isolation     from one another, advocating a strong review of Harriott's ideas in light of his removal from     the American free jazz scene of the 1960's.</p>
<p>Like John Zorn's hyperkinetic 1989 <i>Spy vs. Spy</i>, a furious reinterpretation of Ornette     Coleman's work as composer, Ken Vandermark's Joe Harriott Project isn't offering a tribute, but     a retelling. Harriott's arrangements are transformed into Vandermark's spacious and disconnected     lines. The signature piano of Harriott's work is absent, and the alto is augmented by clarinet     and trombone duels intertwined in the rhythm. The album exudes a beatnik vibe of radical ease.</p>
<p>Vandermark's staccato sax lines suggest a Joe Harriott refracted through the work of another     short-lived horn player, the immortal Eric Dolphy. The sparse angular attack is always executed     with meticulous control, free from any trace of the excess or self-indulgence that seems to mar     other contemporary exercises in collective improvisation. Even the fragmented ""Shadows"" remains     intensely lyrical, while the defiantly looping ""Straight Lines"" is reminiscent of the near-perfect     Oliver Nelson album, <i>The Blues and the Abstract Truth</i>, in muted uprising and subdued     discord. Jeb Bishop's quiet trombone solo on the title track is one of the album's simple     highlights. The entirety of <i>Straight Lines</i> revels in the glory of revision: the giddy     thrill of hearing for the first time what the world was formerly deaf to.</p>
<p>As for me, I can't complain. I thrive on precisely this kind of music, this marriage of melody     and resistance. Sure, it sounds like a boulder slipping down from the top of a great hill in     hell, but for a sound this strong, I'm willing to go back down to the bottom again.</p></div>"|8395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8395-straight-lines/|8.2|Brent S.

    principle. From many disparate cultures, you will forge a single unified populace. Your nation
    will be founded on the basic common needs of humanity: the need for shelter, food, water, love,
    and Cajun-spiced curly fries. Your people will not see difference, they will see homogeneity.
    They will be of a loving, peaceful nature, because they will have chosen to transcend their
    idiosyncratic backgrounds and belong to a greater whole.</p><p>
    
    However noble e pluribus unum may be in nation-building, though, it's a lousy principle when it
    comes to music, as <i>Jesus Life for Children Under Twelve Inches</i> amply demonstrates. This
    disc is a collection of remixes by French easy-listener and trip-hopper, Kid Loco (aka ex-punk
    Jean-Yves Prieur), and it showcases Loco's ability to miss the point of remixing.</p><p>
    
    Remixing, if it has a purpose beyond shameless marketing, is meant to make the source material
    more interesting to a different sector of the music-buying public. It's a cross-over tactic
    that only works if the remixer makes the source music more appealing. And throughout the duration
    of this record, I found myself more interested in the originals than Loco's boo-di-bip
    lounge-hop versions.</p><p>
    
    The dancing-Shiva Bollywood strings of Talvin Singh's ""Traveller"" are Loco-ized in an identical
    manner to the poverty shuffle of Scottish indie stars, the Pastels.  Loco's dissection of
    Mogwai's ""Tracy"" is blunted and made ready for polyester easy-listening dolts everywhere. From
    Pulp's dole-queue masterpiece, <i>This is Hardcore</i> Kid Loco swipes ""A Little Soul,""
    mislaying the grit and anguish of Jarvis Cocker's performance.</p><p>
    
    You can't help but notice that the cover of <i>Jesus Life for Children Under Twelve Inches</i>
    is a sweet trolley of luscious naked women, the likes of which haven't been seen since Hendrix's
    <i>Electric Ladyland</i>. I'd guess that this cover is the only thing that will catch anyone's
    attention.  E pluribus unum-- out of many sources comes one homogenous blandness.  Let's wish
    Loco better luck founding a nation.</p></div>"|4417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4417-jesus-life-for-children-under-12-inches/|3.8|Paul Cooper

    tunefulness, and any demonstration of musical talent.  Apparently, Idlewild were out
    back taking a piss when the last copy was sold.</p><p>
    
    Idlewild is a band that's been unfairly tagged ""punk-revivalists.""  But while there are
    a handful of straight-ahead punk songs on <i>Hope is Important</i>, the band's punk attitude
    and throttle fuses with a more palatable rock modus operandi on the record's brightest moments.
    What truly sets Idlewild apart from the unwashed masses of wannabe punk bands that follow the
    yellow prick road paved by the Sex Pistols and the Exploited, though, are the distinct traces
    of indie rock influences-- from Husker Du to Superchunk-- that percolate up through their
    punkish rush.</p><p>
    
    The group, comprised of vocalist Roddy Woomble, guitarist Rod Jones, bassist Bob Fairfoull,
    and drummer Colin Newton, has existed since 1995.  But <i>Hope</i>, their U.S. debut, shows
    a band as inexperienced at record-making as a group of teenage punks just signed to Flipside
    Records after their first gig at Coney Island High.  As the liner notes indicate, the album
    was recorded in a total of 29 days, spread over the course of six months.  In this regard,
    they remain true to the punk paradigm-- the album sounds immediate and desperate.  You can
    practically hear them being dragged out of the studio as their lease runs out.  Thus, many of
    the weak songs that might have otherwise been tossed (read: those that rely too heavily on
    punked-up guitar noise and strained vocals to disguise flimsy hooks), are deposited onto the
    album as filler.</p><p>
    
    The other major blemish to the album, unfortunately, is the frontman.  If your only role in the
    band is to provide the vocals and get a rise out the crowd, you better be damn good at it.  I
    mean, you don't have to be Liam Gallagher-- or even Chris Robinson, for that matter-- but you
    do have to be engaging, and able to flow with the music.  Roddy Woomble (that's got to be his
    real name, doesn't it?) has his moments, sure enough.  His vocals have a lip-curling appeal to
    them, at times.  And he shines on the album's single, ""When I Argue I See Shapes,"" sounding
    eerily like Blink 182's Tom Delonge channeling Michael Stipe.  Except Scottish.  And with a
    brain.  But even in his best hour, Woomble still can't keep time with a kindergarten 4/4 beat.
    Maybe he should learn to play the recorder, or perhaps, pick up a copy of <i>Hooked on Tempo</i>
    (now available at your neighborhood Pamida store).</p><p>
    
    Essentially, <i>Hope is Important</i> is an album of singles.  Only ""When I Argue I See Shapes,""
    ""Paint Nothing,"" and ""I'm a Message"" manage to break free of the punk chains with commendable
    results.  As a punk band, Idlewild is nothing special: they've got no political agenda, they're
    not ugly enough to use their social frustrations as fodder for songs, and they don't piss off
    government officials.  But as a punk-tinged rock outfit, they have some cache.  If they can keep
    the punk in the back of their heads and off their guitar strings, maybe they'll get some more
    studio time.  And, hopefully, we'll get an album showcasing the songwriting talents that are
    merely hinted at here.</p></div>"|4062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4062-hope-is-important/|6.0|Beatty & Garrett

Back in the
    <i>Early Hi-Ball Years</i> of 1992, he was merely the frontman for the esteemed Coctails.
    And while making a handful of revered albums with that band, he also did time fronting the
    Sea and Cake, turning out three more excellent albums, albeit in a decidedly more ""post-rock""
    vein.  He also helped turn Sam Prekop's excellent self- titled debut into a better piece of
    music, adding his nimble- fingered guitar work to Prekop's subtle magic.  Next thing you know,
    the guy's on his second solo album, headed down a path of continued greatness and recording
    some of the most impressive orchestral pop this side of awesome.</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, after hearing Prewitt's first solo record, 1997's <i>In the Sun</i>, I was
    expecting something along the same lines.  And I got it.  But where <i>In the Sun</i>
    occasionally tossed up some poppier, more rhythm- based stuff (the catchy- assed hook of
    ""Good Man,"" the post-funk of ""Rush Hour,"" and the head- bobbing ""Work""), <i>White Sky</i>
    is a bit more mellow and autumnal.  Even though the record starts with the joyous ""Raise On
    High,"" it stands as <i>White Sky</i>'s most upbeat track.</p><p>
<i>White Sky</i> may be the most meloncholy and beautifully orchestrated album of Prewitt's
    career so far.  The string section's powerful presence is one of the album's greatest assets,
    but more stunning is the way these pieces fit together, giving the life of stereo surround to
    compositions that draw inspiration from 1970s AM radio.  And Prewitt must be pretty good behind
    the board, too, because his production work on <i>White Sky</i> ranks up there with Chicago's
    elite, Jim O'Rourke and John McEntire.  <i>In the Sun</i> was packed with great melodies,
    but Prewitt was clearly less experienced at adding depth.  <i>White Sky</i> finds Prewitt
    more than capable of incorporating open space and perfecting arrangements.</p><p>
    
    But, as with any great album, it's the songs that make <i>White Sky</i> truly compelling.
    ""Shake"" encapsulates the unwelcome handshake of the late Autumn flu; the eight- minute ""Walking
    On the Farm"" begins with a sparse bassline and minimal drumbeat with occasional, brief
    flourishes of harmonica and electric piano before blossoming into a majestic, full- blown
    sadness; the gentle, hummable pop of ""Final Season"" will stick in your head like eyes; and
    the record's closer, ""I'll Be Waiting,"" highlights Prewitt's inescapable pop perfection with
    understated acoustic guitar and the sweet backing vocals of Edith Frost.</p><p>
    
    Simply put, Archer Prewitt is like Nick Drake with a backbone.  And if his music is praised by
    the future Michael Stipes of this world, he can plan on becoming the next super- cool indie
    rock folk hero 20 years down the line.  In the meantime, he's one of Chicago's finest pop stars,
    and thankfully, incredibly prolific.</p></div>"|6467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6467-white-sky/|8.6|Ryan Schreiber

N'Sync. 98 Degrees. LFO. Some of the worst bands that have ever been
    forced upon the world. And what do they all have in common? They're good-looking Americans.
    Good-looking, dumb Americans. In such a time of need, who will free us from this prison we
    have created? Ugly British people. And, if the Bevis Frond's latest offering, <i>Live at the
    Great American Music Hall</i>, is any indication, judgment day is close at hand.</p><p>
    
    Nick Saloman (aka the Bevis Frond), whose other credits include founder of Woronzow Records
    and the <i>Ptolemaic Terrascope</i> zine, is about as close to indie heaven as you can get--
    one-man lo-fi pop music made by an actual Englishman. (Bob Pollard can try all he wants to
    nail that fake-ass British accent, but at the end of the day he's still a drunken hick).
    Flydaddy Records' website claims that Nick Saloman has been called ""the finest electric
    guitarist working anywhere right now."" And while that statement is of the same typically
    overblown nature of most bands' press releases, I'd probably have to agree with that.  While
    Lenny Kravitz wastes his precious career spewing riffs straight out of ""Pentatonic Scales for
    Chronic Masturbators,"" Saloman constructs flowing, melodic guitar solos that rival those of
    Guided by Voices/ Gem/ Cobra Verde guitarist Doug Gillard.</p><p>
    
    Whereas the Frond's two most recent LPs, <i>Vavona Burr</i> and <i>North Circular</i>, have
    showcased Saloman's ability to write brilliant hook-driven pop songs, <i>Live at the Great
    American Music Hall</i> showcases the band's bluesier side.  Sure, the material on this album
    lacks the catchiness of other Frond recordings, but Saloman's immensely talented touring band
    creates an energy and immediacy that is virtually nonexistent on studio outings.  See, Saloman
    is perfectly competent as a bassist and drummer, but the rhythm section on <i>Live</i>--
    consisting of Andy Ward on drums and Adrian Shaw on bass-- gives this record a more cohesive
    sound than any of the Bevis Frond's other albums.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us back to our original topic: ugly British people. We live in a world where
    Britney Spears' left tit gets more publicity than every deserving indie act combined.  We are
    living in a world where LFO can sell millions of copies of an album that rhymes ""Hornets"" with
    ""Sonnets."" Our country is a fucking joke.  And as the great ugly British man Winston Churchill

    was never going to possess the bodyshock that their debut album,
    <i>dubnobasswithmyheadman</i> had in superabundance.  From ""Dark Train""
    to ""Dirty Epic,"" from ""Cowgirl"" to the surreal epic ""Mmm Skyscraper, I
    Love You,"" this album nuked the competition with floor-ripping rhythmic
    skills and totally bonkers lyrics. Only these cocky bastards could think
    they could get away (as they certainly do) with lines such as, ""I've got
    my 501's freeze-dried with a new religion.""</p><p>
    While other tracks on <i>Beaucoup Fish</i> are scared to really come out
    and be loud and proud for fear of becoming a ""Born Slippy"" rallying
    call, ""King of Snake"" certainly draws from that former greatness.
    Underworld have force-fed the bass loop from Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love""
    beaucoup angel dust, and let the frenzied beast loose in a room of shrieking
    ghouls, led by Karl Hyde who whips them up into further delirium by shouting
    ""Game boy!"" and ""Tom and Jerry!"" at them. So, it sounds daft in print--
    wait until you hear Rick Smith's remix versions!</p><p>
    On each of these singles, Smith adds his own takes. He keeps each mix short
    (under four minutes) and rather than just a quick edit of the album version,
    he's inserted voices even stranger than the wise old crone offering advise
    about how dangerous snake fighting can get. So, you get some plummy English
    lord (imagine that John Lydon had attended Eton and dropped a love dove--
    that's the voice) exhorting all and sundry with, ""Hey, fellow dancer, soul
    fellow, one time, one time, explode mystic dove! Start feeling."" Smith
    periodically stops the track, creating a sort of auditory strobe effect.
    This effect gives his mixes even more unsettling appeal.
    </p><p>
    Ashley Beedle's take on ""Save Our Discos"" sticks closer to the original
    and, as you would expect from a member of the Ballistic Brothers and the
    X-Press 2 project, he's bigged up the piano vamps and made the track
    that much more housey.
    </p><p>
    Fatboy Slim really surprised me with his mix. Far from being some
    pop-dance cack, he's really thought about the song's structure and then
    gone ahead anyway, so shredding the bassline that it's barely recognizable.
    Fats has selected the Dionysiac delirium drum pattern from his library of
    percussion before grabbing his Roland 303 and setting it to acid burn the
    crowd as they're hectored by the distorted specter of Karl Hyde chanting
    the familiar slogans. This is the mix you're going to hear in the clubs,
    and you'll be taken away in an ambulance afterwards, too. Top night out,
    then!
    </p><p>
    On a different tip, but just as crucial, is Dave Clarke's technotic,
    filtermatic remix. Clarke's revered for his techno purity and hard bop-
    modelled drum programming.  And all his trademarks are here, as he sweeps
    the track with his EQ filter to regulate the peaks and valleys and,
    cunningly, your synaptic responses, too.  Also from the techno camp comes
    Slam (who are vastly underheard-- check out their kickass <i>Headstates</i>
    album and <i>Dark Forces</i> EP with the fine Claude Young remixes), who
    wrestle ""King of Snake"" to the floor and beat the royal crap out of his
    reptilian self. King gets right back up, dazed and hypnotic, drifting as
    though on the verge of unconsciousness, his eyes luridly spinning, and
    with a baby-munchingly evil grin on his face. You will genuflect before
    him. Now!
    </p><p>
    As all these mixes are equally superb, I have to wonder if ""King of
    Snake"" is such a smoking choon that nobody-- not even that geezer from
    Adamski-- could screw it up. At the moment, unfortunately, these are
    important singles and consequently about nine dollars apiece.  But I
    assure you, while you might find pretenders to the throne, there is
    only the one King of Snake.</p></div>"|8347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8347-king-of-snake-eps/|9.5|Paul Cooper

    Well, with this album, Matthew Sweet's travelled back in time to the days of his <i>Girlfriend</i>
    album.  It's in direct response to the criticism of his most recent albums. The critics say the
    excitement had gone-- they wondered where the fun went.</p><p>
    
    ""Oi got plenty o' fun 'ere in me shoe, mate!""</p><p>
    
    This album is big.  It finds Sweet enlisting the help of up to 16 musicians on some of the
    tracks. The big sound harkens back to a...</p><p>
    
    ""Oi love the Phil Cowlins! E's me 'ero!""</p><p>
    
    Uh... the big sound here resembles a post- Genesis Phil Collins, complete with overdubbed
    harmonies and lots of reverb on the vocal tracks.</p><p>
    
    ""Tell 'em 'bout me trick song on the record bizness! Oi'll show them critics to critic me!""</p><p>
    
    Ahh.  I think Matthew here is referring to ""Write Your Own Song,"" which asks the listener to go
    ahead and write his or her own song if they don't like what Sweet's doing. See if <i>they</i>
    do a better job at it.</p><p>
    
    ""Roit! Well, tell 'em 'bout 'Thunderstorm!' That one's bleedin' ten minutes long!""</p><p>
    
    Nine minutes and thirty- seven seconds, actually.  Yes, ""Thunderstorm"" is a slowly building epic
    that weaves its way from an upbeat opening (""I don't mind if the rain is coming down"") to a soft,
    melodic middle as we ""Wait for a calm in the storm"" to a more tranquil section before exploding
    to close with a triumphant burst of sound.</p><p>

    palms.  But this is an encouraging push-- not an annoying push-- into fields of amber organs,
    where crystalline spires of guitar rise into a sky of matte, reachable teal. Atmosphere is
    pumped courtesy of Mercury Rev's Dave Fridmann, who appears to be taking it upon himself to
    produce every band that makes writers spit ""fields,"" ""crystalline,"" ""glow,"" and ""...like the
    Flaming Lips."" <i>Wheat and Adams</i> oozes subtle, if not innocuous, indie rock tricks,
    blended into a homogenous, hotdog/tofu- like (depending on your eating dietary philosophy
    consistency. While restraint and understatement create a dreamy weave, the unwavering mood
    and pace offer few disappointments-- and few standout moments. If anything, Wheat takes
    consistency almost to a fault.</p><p>
<i>Hope and Adams</i> hovers in the air like a hypnotic zeppelin, but you can follow the tethering
    cables down to the ground where the Flaming Lips, Pavement, Wilco, and the American Analog
    Set lazily hold on, uninterested, sitting in lawn chairs and smoking cigarettes. At high
    volumes, the trembling synths and bass pleasantly rattle your teeth like chewing on aluminum
    foil. Even if the songs all follow the pattern of ""tightly waft along at a medium pace until
    sax/ droning guitar/ piano/ strings drop the improvised hook,"" Wheat's suddenly pleasantly in
    front of the pack thanks to large, lily- white sails. ""More Than You'll Ever Know"" is the most
    lovely piece of distortion you're likely to hear, but it leads into the unfortunate ""Roll the
    Road,"" which sounds precisely like the Flaming Lips doing a new age version of Tom Petty's
    ""Free Fallin'.""  Bands like Wheat never become one's favorite band, but they'll remind you of
    all groups to whom you do pray.</p></div>"|8640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8640-hope-and-adams/|7.6|Brent DiCrescenzo

    invariably owe its success to one of three things:</p><p>
    
    1. Recklessly irresponsible critics whose ideas of ""good"" and ""bad""
    have been irreparably damaged by years of exposure to loads and loads
    of shitty music.</p><p>
    
    2. Slimy publicist types that aren't afraid to trade a little fellatio
    for a winning review.</p><p>
    
    3. The protecting hand of Yahweh.</p><p>
    
    This goes a long way toward explaining the large majority of popular culture.
    But every once in a while, an album will make its way through reviewer after
    reviewer, deservedly earning absurdly high marks with nary a scratch.  Such is
    the story with hip-hop's messiah of '99, Mos Def, and his solo debut, <i>Black
    on Both Sides</i>.</p><p>
    
    But, in a sea of lousy, burnt-out critics, why should you believe me?  For
    starters, nobody serviced me to write this.  Not since the emergence of A Tribe
    Called Quest and Q-Tip (who makes a brief guest appearance here on Mr. Nigga"")
    has hip-hop seen an MC as intelligent, as lyrically proficient, and as baby-butt
    smooth as Mos Def.</p><p>
    
    If you heard Def's previous outings with <i>Black Star</i>, you probably saw this
    coming.  If you didn't, it's clearly time to put Ol' Dirty on that shelf reserved
    for insane, materialist misogynists, and repent.  With artists like this finally
    getting the respect they deserve, we could be entering a new era of hip-hop.
    Think about it.  When was the last time you heard an MC drop a line like, ""Mind
    over matter and soul before flesh""?  When was the last time you heard somebody
    rap about the global economic and environmental consequences of first-world
    corporate waste and subsequent aquatic pollution?  When was the last time you 
    heard a hip-hopper sing competently over a phat-ass beat about the white
    appropriation of black art forms?  Or end a song appropriately with a Bad
    Brains-influenced rockout, where both the drums and bass are played by the
    same guy?</p><p>
    
    Mos Def.  The man does it all-- addressing serious socio-political issues while
    remaining positive and affirmative from start to finish.  Inspiring, no?  The
    current state of punk and independent rock could stand to learn a thing or two
    from this man.</p><p>
    
    True, <i>Black on Both Sides</i> isn't flawless.  If you don't like Tribe-style
    laidback beats, you may have a more difficult time getting into this.  Mos Def's
    singing on tracks like ""Climb"" and ""Umi Says"" is a bit hard to stomach, too.
    And then there's the matter of his sporadic introductory speeches, which
    occasionally sound like the pseudo-prophetic ramblings of a guy who might benefit
    from one less hit from the bong.  But this, honestly, is nit-picking.  Because
    when the beat drops and Def starts spitting his meticulously- crafted lyrics, you
    realize it's entirely possible that he truly is prophetic--  that he was meant to
    be kicking the rhymes, and that we were meant to listen.</p></div>"|5440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5440-black-on-both-sides/|8.7|Andrew Goldman

    Twombs got me through college.  As the hours before essay deadlines slipped away, things would
    become more clear.  You can call it an epiphany or you can call it a gimmick, but Edgar Allan
    Poe's ""Fall of the House of Usher"" is like a tomb.  It is also like a womb.  You could write it
    as ""(t/w)omb"" and be beaten until you bleed all over your properly marked edition of ""Derrida's
    of Grammatology.""  Or you could call it a twomb.  As in, ""that's pretty twomby.""  Here's an
    example of the word ""twomby"" in a sentence: This week's ""very special episode"" of ""Dawson's
    Creek"" was twomby as all hell.</p><p>
    The Cocteau Twins? Dark, damp waves of warm nostalgia wash over cushions of gently layered 
    synthesizers. It's familiar somehow, but over-produced into something usually described as
    otherworldly or ethereal. The Cocteau Twins are the perfect example of twomb-rock. Twins are
    together in the womb.  And the Cocteau Twins were also womb to the development of a new
    generation of independent rock, including groups such as Dead Can Dance and Pale Saints.
    The two-disc compilation of live BBC Sessions recorded between 1982-1996?  You got it-- buried
    alive! Trapped and kicking to get out, in a twomb with a drum machine!</p><p>
    Let's go through the contents of this twomb.  There are 30 versions of 28 songs spanning two
    discs. Yes! There are two versions of ""Hitherto"" and ""Musette and Drums."" The record is
    largely devoted to <i>Garlands</i>-era early work and to BBC recordings of songs from their
    mediocre 1996 release, <i>Milk and Kisses</i>, with a few songs from <i>Treasure</i> and
    <i>Head Over Heels</i> sprinkled about. This leaves a significant portion of their 15 year
    career unrepresented-- specifically, material from <i>Blue Bell Knoll</i> and <i>Heaven or
    Las Vegas</i>. This conspicuous absence prevents the album from serving as a retrospective
    or greatest hits compilation. Instead, it can be categorized as either an inadequate
    introduction to the band, or as one more morsel for completists.</p><p>

<i>From the FAQ in the ""Pitchfork Caf√©:""</i></p><p>
    Q: Why would anyone decide to release ""just the BBC Sessions,"" which leave out the stronger
    period of Cocteau Twins' work?</p><p>
    A: They're milking it!</p><p>
    As Neil Diamond once told us, ""Money walks, but it don't sing and dance and it don't talk.""
    That's <i>BBC Sessions</i>' bottom line-- it's one more release issued by the floundering
    U.S. label Rykodisc (and Simon Raymonde's own Bella Union imprint in the U.K.) that will be
    sold and bought and maybe sold again.  Although these BBC Sessions hold a certain amount of
    economic potential, this compilation is not only too long for such a quirky track listing,
    but the Cocteaus' strength is not their live performance. Fussy production provides the
    suspension of disbelief that entering the Cocteaus' twomb properly deserves.  In a live
    setting, their studio aesthetic of densely-layered shimmering dissolves and sugar-coated
    textured noise becomes washed out sentiment lacking in urgency.</p><p>
    Although <i>BBC Sessions</i> contains a few inspired performances such as the 1983 version of
    ""Hitherto,"" and an unusual if slightly grating cover of Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit,"" for
    the most part, it isn't.  This compilation may just be a ploy to fund a private school
    education for the daughter of Liz Fraser and Spiritualized's Damon Reece, but that doesn't
    mean certain fans won't find pleasure in these slightly more course versions of classic Cocteau
    Twins tracks.  For the uninitiated or casual Cocteau fan, though, <i>Heaven or Las Vegas</i>,
    <i>Treasure</i>, and <i>Blue Bell Knoll</i> are twombs that should certainly be explored first.</p></div>"|1523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1523-bbc-sessions/|5.3|Kristin Sage Rockermann

I was separate from my fellows not because of some
    heinous act of villainy or a disturbed love of bus tickets.  Nope, I was shunned because Nature
    decided to play the cruelest trick on this developing youth.  Nature instructed my pituitary
    gland to make my nasal cartilage grow at a hyper-accelerated rate. My conk was totally out of
    proportion with the rest of my soon-to-be gangly self. I would never score.</p><p>
    
    I sought solace in music. Like the other hormonal freaks I knew, I chose the Jesus and Mary
    Chain/ Joy Division axis to ally myself with.  Though I must confess to splitting over to the
    Smiths enclave more than a few times.  The brothers Reid and Ian Curtis offered me a place
    where I wouldn't be derided for my waywardness. The music existed because of waywardness. If
    Nature was cruel to me, music could, in part, alleviate the punishment.</p><p>
    
    So it wasn't long before I wanted a pair of winkle-pickers instead of the sturdy Hush Puppies
    my parents bought for me. I wanted to wear shades like the Velvet Underground. Music took over
    my life. I identified. My big-eared brother did the same, a few years later-- he chose to dress
    like the blokes in the Fields of the Nephilim.</p><p>
    
    Luke Slater would like us to believe he's been there too. Did he have a lazy eye, or a speech
    impediment? Maybe I'll get to ask him one day. But the music on <i>Wireless</i> yells out, ""I
    am an outsider, just like you! Wanna get skulled with me?""  And skulled you will be, having
    listened to Slater's dirty neuro-funk. Where his previous record, <i>Freek Funk</i> was
    comprised of shimmering tech-disco, <i>Wireless</i> is a dingy street corner electro session.
    ""Sum Ton Tin"" is all screeching blasts and cranked-up body pops. ""Sheer Five Five"" draws
    heavily from Two Lone Swordsmen's deep sea nitrogen bubble.  Fatboy Slim's hallmark breaks get
    a drubbing during ""Hard Knock Rock;"" and ""All Exhale"" is relentless in its pursuit of your
    unflinching attention.</p><p>
    
    I have no doubt that each track is professionally spliced together, but Slater is excelling in
    styles that others have already pioneered. Slater will never be up there with Andy Weatherall,
    Richard D. James, Richie Hawtin, or Wolfgang Voigt while he gets by like this.  Of course,
    maybe that's not his plan.  Perhaps he's just more comfortable being an insider.</p></div>"|7235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7235-wireless/|6.2|Paul Cooper

    concept album. Who amongst the sane cannot want to erase all vestige of Styx's <i>Kilroy Was
    Here</i> or fail to succumb to multiple thromboses when Genesis' <i>Selling England by the
    Pound</i> threatens to make its dismal reappearance on audiophile 24k gold CDs? If we learn
    anything from this closing millennium, it should be that 99.9% of all musicians should refrain
    from grandiose schemes of undiluted preposterousness and keep banging out three- minute garage
    band classics √† la the Make Up.</p><p>
    Implicit in the percentage I've given above is a recognition that 0.1% of musicians should have
    the freedom to push artistic forms through concepts. And techno head, Stewart Walker, is
    amongst that number. For in <i>Stabiles</i> he has constructed a high art album of sparse yet
    funky beats and subdued ambiance that should secure maximum rotation in Manhattan art dealers'
    galleries for many months. Until someone like Norman Cook rips the idea off and banalizes it.</p><p>
    Thankfully, Walker's concept for <i>Stabiles</i> is simple. There's no son et lumi√®re
    extravaganza depicting a world governed by malfunctioning robots, or a wry scenario about a
    LSD- soaked brass band led by a retired army type named after a common table condiment.
    No, he wished to ""write sound compositions which would be a stationary focus in the home
    listening environment."" And to this end, he turned to American sculptor Alexander Calder for
    inspiration. Calder is praised for his often immense metal sculptures that, though huge and
    metallic, have branches and arms that spin and weave within each other when the wind blows.
    In short, Calder sculpted paradoxical mobiles-- objects that look as though they weigh tons,
    but when a slight breeze blows, the mass evaporates and the sculpture becomes weightless,
    airy, hypnotic, and free.</p><p>
    It's not a bad model for a techno artist to employ, given that the genre excels in the harsh
    and heavy. If you're at all familiar with the releases from Berlin's Chain Reaction label,
    imagine those distinctive rhythms without the softened white noise and hiss that sometimes
    detract from the accessibility and the elegance of the imprint.</p><p>
    For <i>Stabiles</i>, Stewart Walker set up discreet loops of rhythm and let them spin on top
    and through each other. Occasionally, as on ""Distortion Men,"" he'll add a tiny cricket- like
    sound to throw the beat out of whack. At the conclusion of ""Missing Winter,"" Walker drops in
    an ambient section that would not be out of place on one of those majestic tape- loop
    collaborations between Robert Fripp and Brian Eno.  Walker occasionally even hints at a
    melody and lures us in even further. ""Sunclipse,"" fittingly the album's closing track,
    combines all these tricks and is as graceful as it is avant garde.</p><p>
    It's pretty astoundingly given the strict parameters Walker gave himself, and considering the
    length of the disc (just two seconds shy of an hour), that <i>Stabiles</i> never gets
    repetitive. There's always a new combination of loops to follow their meandering. If you've
    never seen a Calder sculpture, take it from me-- Walker's more than met his goal; he's risen
    to the challenge with precision, subtlety, and care. Okay, so you can't dance to it.  On the
    other hand, <i>Stabiles</i> is an album every bit as beautiful as Calder's works and it costs
    a whole lot less to own.</p><p>
    Now, aren't you tickled that Deep Purple didn't get there first?</p></div>"|8569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8569-stabiles/|8.5|Paul Cooper

The Enchirito, for those
    of you who only eat people food, is Taco Bell's newest snackvertising venture:
    it's an enchilida, basically, but Taco Bell-style.  It's filled with delicious
    prison grade ""beef,"" covered with the edible polymer these people call ""cheese,""
    and comes smothered with a kind of red chili which appears to just be mild Taco
    Bell sauce with some chili powder mixed in.  In short, it's the best thing to
    enter my life in the last year, and I've been eating them by the burro-load.</p><p>
    
    Now, I have some friends who become upset at the mention of the Enchirito.
    Here's why: the Enchirito is not actually new.  It's old.  It was removed
    from T-Bell's menu a couple years back, and some people never really
    recovered from the loss.  When its return was announced recently, these
    friends of mine were pretty excited.  Gleeful, really.  Until they ate
    one.  Then the griping started: ""This is not an Enchirito.  I remember
    Enchiritos, and this is not one.  I'm not sure what it is, but I'm sure
    it's not an Enchirito.  And I'm sure I don't like it.""</p><p>
    
    I haven't been able to identify with any confidence the difference
    between the Enchirito of Yore and the new, revised Enchirito.  See, I
    never ate the Old Enchirito.  I've only ever had a New Enchirito.  But
    as far as I can tell, the main difference is the new version's lack of a
    decorative olive placed on top.  Anyway, my friends think I'm crazy for
    loving the New Enchirito.  Maybe I just love it because I don't know
    what I'm missing, but I love it all the same.</p><p>
    
    Here's what I'm getting at: until last week, I'd never really heard
    the Wedding Present.  My introduction to them came in the form of
    this singles collection which skips the first 10 years of their
    existence.  It contains one mini-album in its entirety, and the rest
    of the disc is comprised exclusively of non-album tracks: stand-alone
    singles, b-sides, live material and compilation stuff.  This disc is
    the New Enchirito, and I love it.</p><p>
    
    For most bands-- even good bands-- a collection like this is a recipe
    for disaster.  A band's collected odds and ends are usually uneven at
    best, and it seems that later work is almost always dismissed, even by
    (or especially by) a band's most ardent fans.  This collection, on the
    other hand, is impressively cohesive and consistently excellent.  The
    former is likely due to the simple fact that David Gedge doesn't mess
    with his formula too much: most of these songs are pretty straightforward
    mid-tempo rockers with the standard mix of distortion, hookiness and
    Gedge's distinctive vocals.  The remarkable thing is that this formula
    is so consistently successful.</p><p>
    
    ""Jet Girl"" and ""Sports Car"" serve as the record's standouts and are
    both prime examples of Gedge's lyrical sensibility: maudlin but barbed.
    There are acoustic and electric versions of both songs; each electric
    version is irresistible, and the acoustic versions do exactly what they
    should-- strip the songs down without sounding tossed off.  The remaining
    18 tracks are almost as great as these, and that vast expanse of music is,
    incredibly, devoid of any stinkers at all.  Even the cover of the ""Cheers""
    theme song is great.  If this is a singles collection, I can't wait to see
    what an actual album sounds like.</p><p>
    
    Old school Wedding Present fans may yell that this is not an Enchirito.
    I mean, what do I know?  I kinda hope that's true, actually, because
    it'll just mean that the earlier stuff is that much better.    Until I
    lay hands on it, though, I will continue to enjoy the New Enchirito.
    Mmmm, gooey.</p></div>"|8597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8597-singles-1995-1997/|7.6|Zach Hooker

    music of a howlingly bittersweet variety that is at once joyful and
    melancholy.  And if their recent self-titled album is any indication,
    Pinback may be ready to join the ranks of emotionally confused
    super-songwriters alongside Modest Mouse, Sunny Day Real Estate, and the
    Sea and Cake.</p><p>
    
    I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking, ""Great.  Just what we need.
    Another Sunny Day rip-off.""  Well, if Pinback sounded anything like any of
    the aforementioned bands as a whole, I would have to agree.  Instead, they've
    snagged the better aspects of the three and mixed 'em around enough to cook
    up something mighty good.  Any self-respecting cook knows you can't make an
    omelet out of a turd.  Likewise, there ain't nothing wrong with picking
    good musical ingredients, just so long as you don't add too much of this
    or that.</p><p>
    
    ""Tripoli,"" <i>Pinback</i>'s opening track, starts with the kind of drum
    massacre you'd expect from Modest Mouse.  Then the voices enter-- two of
    them, to be precise.  Two superb, soft, vibrato-less voices, free of Isaac
    Brock's snarl or Jeremy Enigk's affected accent.  Voices singing about death
    and pushing babies down spiral stairs, conveying a gut-wrenching loneliness.
    Voices that <i>make</i> this album from beautiful start to beautiful finish.
    Hey, they're compelling voices.  In fact, they're so compelling that it
    becomes easy to ignore the sweet humming of minimal keyboard lines, and
    guitar playing that occasionally drops hints of Enigk and Prewitt.</p><p>
    
    Less flatteringly, though, all the attention to the vocals may obscure the fact
    that the bass tone sounds about as interesting as an instructional cassette
    relaying Gateway motherboard jumper settings.  And the guitar melodies are,
    in most cases, inexcusably damaged by the flat recording quality.  But perhaps
    worst of all, these accomplished musicians (who sing, scratch, play guitar,
    bass, keyboards, timpani, and cello) rely on the simulated snares of a drum
    machine for the majority of the album.  There's a sour taste in my mouth, and
    I think I know how it got there.</p><p>
    
    Still, this album is warmly cool.   It's the kind of record that radiates
    a sense of security while tying your shoelaces together.  That Pinback pulls
    that difficult feat off should be enough to warrant repeated listens.  At
    least, it <i>should</i> be...</p></div>"|6296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6296-pinback/|7.2|Andrew Goldman

    cool, let alone taken seriously.  Yep, they remember him for what he's
    contributed to society in their lifetimes-- Tin Machine, <i>Black Tie,
    White Noise</i>, the ""Cool World"" soundtrack, <i>Outside</i>,
    <i>Earthling</i>, and now <i>Hours</i>.  Who'd guess that a discography
    that unlistenable would belong to the richest man in rock music?</p><p>
    At this point, David Bowie has done more harm than good to his fans'
    cochleas.  His last few albums have failed in almost every aspect, but
    not for a lack of trying.  <i>Outside</i>, his 1995 ""comeback,"" was a
    concept album about a futuristic murder case that featured an endless
    stream of clich√©s and banal S&amp;M; imagery in lieu of lyrics.  His 1997
    follow-up, <i>Earthling</i>, attempted mock drum-n-bass, some shoddy
    reggae- tinged numbers, and a universally- panned tour with Trent
    Reznor.</p><p>
<i>Hours</i>, of course, completes Bowie's late 90's trilogy in his usual
    fashion-- he's altered his sound to fit his perception of current musical
    trends.  And as always, he's closer to getting it right than you might
    expect, but still way off the mark. Here, Bowie seems content to cut his
    losses with today's youth and reach for the older set.  <i>Hours</i> opts
    for a spacy, but nonetheless adult- contemporary sound that comes across
    with all the vitality and energy of a rotting log.</p><p>
    For the better part of an hour, Bowie drifts through some the most sterile
    and unimaginative songs since Sting released <i>Mercury Falling</i>.
    On ""Thursday's Child,"" Bowie acknowledges his issues with growing old, and
    possibly, his dwindling fanbase.  ""Throw me tomorrow,"" he sings.  ""Not that
    I've really got a chance.""  At least he can admit it.  But just six songs
    later, Bowie regresses into ""The Pretty Things are Going to Hell,"" an homage
    to his classic 1971 song ""Oh! You Pretty Things"" and Iggy and the Stooges'
    ""Hard to Beat (Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell)"" off <i>Raw Power</i>.  As
    expected, it's not something you wanna find yourself listening to.</p><p>
    No, it's not a new low, but that doesn't mean it's not embarrassing.  David
    Bowie is my dad's age, whether he likes it or not, and he needs to exercise
    some self-restraint--  you know, like taking a deep breath when he gets the
    urge to pen a sequel to one of his old hits.  Or counting to ten when he
    feels the need to put a flanger effect on the guitar track.  Or returning to
    an old drug habit when he becomes inspired to record another album...</p></div>"|881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/881-hours/|4.7|Ryan Schreiber

I'm calling
    it ""mellowcore."" How totally oxymoronic is that? Still, Tram isn't quite
    slow enough to be slowcore, and it isn't sad enough to be sadcore; it
    exists in that category of incredibly sincere yet slightly spaced-out
    bands like the Red House Painters and Damon and Naomi. Maybe it should be
    called ""sincerecore."" In any case, Tram is quite mellow, and very sincere.
    Which makes it <i>such</i> good make-out music for indie kids.</p><p>
    You laugh, but I'm serious. <i>Heavy Black Frame</i> is the sensitive indie
    boy's version of Sarah McLachlan's <i>Fumbling Towards Ecstasy</i>. You want
    to show a girl how sensitive you are while still trying desperately to get in
    her pants? Put this on, and poof! Pants problem solved. Tram's music is soft
    and pretty, and has just the right amount of quavering, English-accented
    melancholy without getting too wretchedly depressing. Granted, it's nothing so
    bag-of-hammers obvious as ""And I will be the one/ To hold you down/ Kiss you
    so hard/ I'll take your breath away,"" but it'll do the trick.</p><p>
<i>Heavy Black Frame</i> also works well for those nights when you're
    drinking alone because the girl whose pants you were trying to get into
    won't return your calls. Sober, you might realize that Tram's songwriting
    is a bit slight; <i>Heavy Black Frame</i> begins with the exceptionally
    gorgeous ""Nothing Left to Say"" and proceeds down a gentle incline for the
    rest of the album. Every now and then, an instrumental flourish will
    remind you briefly of some other band-- the Mazzy Star-ish slide guitar
    on ""Too Scared to Sleep,"" or the oboe on ""I've Been Here Once Before"" that
    recalls a very, very sleepy Tortoise. When it ends, you'll feel refreshed,
    but you won't remember much about the album.  And if you're drunk like I am,
    you won't give two shits either way; you'll be too busy feeling sorry for
    yourself and moping along to ""Reason Why.""
    </p><p>
    So, what have we learned today? Here's the Cliffs Notes recap: Tram equals
    sincere, mellow sonic wallpaper, you're not going to get any, and I want
    to pork Sarah McLachlan. Class dismissed!

    rebelled politically, the kids rebelled socially; they fought and they
    fucked.  But somehow the social aspect took over the political, and
    forward motion decayed into a meaningless display of hedonism.  From
    there, all it took was one decade of Reagan and Bush to set us right
    back where we started: divided, oppressed, depressed, and repressed.
    And it's precisely these developments that allow the urgent sexual
    energy of the French Kicks to come through so clearly and so necessarily
    right now.</p><p>
    
    The French Kicks owe their sound to the Rolling Stones and to Jonathan
    Fire*Eater.  They'll likely admit to that, and there's nothing to be
    ashamed of, because they sound as raw and as filled with primal desire
    as either of their influences.  Appropriately, drummer Nick Stumpf comes
    from the caveman school of drumming-- he plays simple beats, and pummels
    the shit out of his kit.  Feeling the call of the wild, Jamie Krents throws
    down the slow and low bass groove (and it <i>is</i> a groove).  The duo
    forms the foundation on which Josh Wise and Matthew Stinchcomb whip out
    their raunchy-ass guitars, dueling like incensed rivals.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps most importantly, the French Kicks guys are one of the few existing
    bands who can say that they have not one, not two, but <i>three</i>
    vocalists, often all harmonizing at the same time.  The band comes across
    as one enamored of the spirit of punk rock, but that finds a similar
    infatuation with the presence of pop's best showmen.  Sure, these guys are
    a throwback.  They certainly aren't groundbreaking.  But their love for the
    rebellion that was once inherent in rock music comes through loud and clear.
    The long-absent bite has been reinserted into the music, and that's worth a
    lot in my book.</p></div>"|3193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3193-french-kicks-ep/|6.9|Andrew Goldman

Now. Get up.     Go.</p>
<p><b>The Long Review:</b><br/> Judd handed me a purple children's book and said, ""Check this out."" The hardback felt about the size of     a gatefold double vinyl album. In bold letters, the cover proclaimed <i>The Worst Band in the Universe!</i> Immediately we opened the book in an attempt to discern which band the author, Graeme Base, had in mind     while writing the picture book. Toto and Gomez came to mind. Yet upon finishing the first page, I muttered,     ""Man, this book is about The Dismemberment Plan.""</p>
<p>As Pitchfork readers know, I like to come up with wild and crazy scenarios for record reviews.  The songs     from the Plan's latest record, <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, had been making love to my brain for over a year,     and I wanted my review to perfectly capture my faith and prophecy for the album. Ironically, ""the worst     band in the universe"" captured my sentiments perfectly. The book begins:</p>
<p><i>On Planett Blipp, beyond the stars, beyond the sun and moon,<br/> The world was ruled by music-- but tradition called the tune.<br/> The Ancient Songs of ages past were all that could be heard,<br/> And no one was allowed to change a single note or word.</i></p>
<p>To write a new tune was heresy, to play it even worse,<br/> And anyone who improvised was scowled upon and cursed.<br/> For years untold the temple walls had rung to songs of yore--<br/> Until the day a brave young groob named Sprocc rewrote the score.</p>
<p>He took his trusty Spligtwanger, and though he knew 'twas wrong,<br/> He cranked the volume up to ten and played a Brand New Song.</p>
<p>The elders banish Sprocc from his planet, leaving him to wander the galaxy with his ragtag band. They     stumble upon a contest for ""the worst band in the universe,"" and naturally win. As it's a children's     book, Sprocc and his jamming outfit return home and establish a new order of song. Lessons are learned.     Hands are held. Cue sunset, go to sleep, little babies.</p>
<p>The Dismemberment Plan spit in the face of modern music. Perhaps their coup is more analogous to an     unexpected sloppy french kiss, in terms of saliva imagery.  But <i>Emergency &amp; I</i> heralds a new era     in rock and roll. Nothing else you own sounds like this record, yet everything you own echoes throughout.     The Dismemberment Plan's chromosomes carry the superior DNA of rock's genealogy through a natural sexual     affair with music, not the cold process of cloning. The perfect nucleotides of the Pixies, Talking     Heads, Fugazi, and Prince spindle in beautiful double-helixes throughout these 12 tracks. Specific     moments recall Gang of Four (""8\xBD Minutes"") or Radiohead (""The Jitters""), but this melange is wholly     unique-- boiled down for synapse-popping flavor. Certainly some will scratch their heads, but innovation     is never unanimously understood.</p>
<p>Keyboards are enjoying a recent renaissance in rock. I believe even Snapcase tour with a Korg. But while     pop groups are content to sprinkle Moog hooks or create false string sections with their Yamahas, The     Dismemberment Plan squeeze alien funk and digital soul from their ebony and ivory. Deep, gurgling squirts     carry ""A Life of Possibilities"" in place of bass. Mainframe bleeps add android soul to ""Memory Machine"".     An overly synthesized score shifts behind ""Spider in the Snow"", mocking pop's traditional signifier for     ""delicate"", yet inevitably sounding even more sincere. But the beautiful, yearning hum that hangs over     ""The City"" like purple-orange sky pollution emotes more than a bruised diva-- it simultaneously aches     and uplifts. The tumbling drums pleasantly propel like public transit. Frustrated guitars chime like     flashes of streetlights in passing puddles. The alienation and excitement, the desolate and the bustling--     the title simply envelopes the themes. By the time Travis Morrison begins crying, ""All... I... ever...     say... now... is... good... bye,"" angels are spooning out your stomach with ladles and visions of your     distant past are punching you in the face.</p>
<p>The closing track, ""Back and Forth"", grooves into brilliance. Bringing to mind Talking Heads' <i>Remain     in Light</i>, the layers lock in bliss.  Funky drums, ticking guitar, synthetic slides, and joyous keyboard     hooks circle tightly like bareback thoroughbreds in Siena's Palio. This track, along with the explosive     ""I Love a Magician"" and ""Girl O'Clock"", hint at new futures. Hometown fans have staged elaborate costumed     breakdancing during Dismemberment Plan sets, and these songs are the hormonal fuel. The Plan rule during     schizophrenic dance-punk explosions, somehow finding middle ground between Brainiac and Prince. As a     testament to the Plan's power, these songs have turned D.C.'s traditionally head-bobbing concert crowds     into cathartic bacchanals. Can I get an ""Amen?""</p>
<p>Around the time Kurt Cobain muttered ""I think I'm dumb,"" lyricists gave up. Syncopated poetry, retro theft,     and extended metaphor have ruled rock lyrics since. Perhaps more importantly than their music, the Plan     offer a return to intelligent, ripe, narrative songwriting. An air of despair hangs over the album, spiked     with humor and passion. A definite debt is owned to hip-hop and soul, but don't think that Morrison simply     barks a sequence of rhyming phrases. He ponderously spits on ""Back and Forth"": ""And faces slide by in     glowing shadows like snowbound ghosts that go up and down in epileptic shivers and negative radioactive     shivers in a landscape of endless dull glitter and a taste in my mouth so sweet, yet so bitter-- and we     exhaust ourselves trying to get there."" Philosophy is backed up with primitive yelps like, ""Put your hands     in the air,"" and the always popular ""yeah!""  Sex, death and humdrum lives are examined with alacrity. I     guarantee you that if you're a twentysomething, post-collegiate human, ""Spider in the Snow"" and ""Gyroscope""     will knock you back into a couch and force a slight ""fuck"" from between your lips. At the very least,     you'll hum along for the rest of your 20s.</p>
<p>I could spend pages examining this record. Everything down to the art is stunningly unique and perfectly     appropriate. Even standard guitar pop numbers like ""What Do You Want Me to Say"" hit like a high-strung     Weezer. A full range of emotions-- orgasm, loss, confusion, uncertainty, resignation, rage-- ooze from     The Dismemberment Plan. Paradox is woven throughout-- the alien and the nostalgic, the nascent and the     classic. It's unfortunate that the term ""new wave"" is still linked to the early 80s. Bands like Jets to     Brazil are unimaginatively trying to revive that new wave sound.  But The Dismemberment Plan is truly,     unequivocally, the <i>new</i> new wave. <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, fittingly, was delayed until the close     of the century. (Hey, Interscope, does ""Boston Red Sox"" ring any bells?) Let's get this era over with.     Please form a line behind the fellows in the sweaty button-down shirts.</p></div>"|2338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2338-emergency-i/|9.6|Brent DiCrescenzo

That's why it's a bit of a relief that <i>The Singing Hatchet</i> takes a step or two back from that edge; its comfortable numbness is no longer as melodramatic as wistfully sighed lines like ""silver letter opener / in the shower / with the scrubber,"" but it still plays like a soundtrack to a tranquilizer overdose.</p><p>
    The Radar Bros. play the type of slowcore that's the diurnal opposite of Low-- while the latter is best listened to at night, the former is best listened to during the day. Instead of gothic, reverb-drenched murkiness, we get crisp, unadorned guitars strumming slowly alongside low-level keyboard hums and frontman Jim Putnam's fragile, exhausted vocals. The band has stuck pretty closely to this formula throughout its existence, producing music of remarkably consistent quality, although not a whole lot of melodic variety. The songs on <i>The Singing Hatchet,</i> like the Bros.' past releases, blur into each other until the whole thing feels like one long, slow ache without much change in tempo or tone. 
    </p><p>
    But every now and then, a little production flourish emerges from the haze of the album to perfectly capture the Radar Bros.' languorous vision, like the fluttering sample on ""To Be Free Again,"" the slide-guitar coda of ""Find The Hour,"" or the gently crackling static in the background of ""Tar The Roofs."" And there are at least two songs, ""Shifty Lies"" and ""Shoveling Sons,"" which are pure bliss from start to end; to hear them one more time might just be reason enough to stay alive a little while longer. So how about it? Have you found <i>your</i> reason to live today?

    mainstream as the guest vocalist on Massive Attack's ""Protection.""  When the
    song became a monsterous club hit, it almost seemed as if the folk duo saw
    dollar signs.  Suddenly, we were hit with <i>Walking Wounded</i>, the first
    Everything But the Girl full- length to be comprised entirely of smooth,
    soulful electronic music.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, their formula didn't work on a grand scale basis.  It's not that it
    was a bad concept-- actually, it could have worked out quite nicely.  The
    problem is, the jungle- style percussion is rarely varied, and when you've
    been hearing the same speedy breakbeat four times a measure for upwards of
    five minutes, it comes out sounding stilted, uninspired and sterile.</p><p>
    
    Despite extreme advances in the sound of electronic music in the three years
    since <i>Walking Wounded</i> was released, <i>Temperamental</i> sticks with
    the same sound Everything But the Girl offered up in 1996.  The stuff probably
    still works as well as <i>Walking Wounded</i> on the dance floor at the local
    sportsbar, but for casual listening, it's incapable of holding interest.</p><p>
    
    The thing about this band is that they're not a bad band-- they work fine
    as an updated version of Sade.  Their problem is, they're just so average.
    I mean, songs like ""Hatfield 1980,"" ""Downhill Racer,"" the album's standout,
    ""Lullaby of Clubland,"" and the closing track, ""The Future of the Future
    (Stay Gold),"" a collaboration with EBTG- contemporaries Deep Dish, could work
    as singles.  But at the end of 60 straight minutes of this record, you feel
    like you've just spent half your life in an upscale women's clothing store.</p></div>"|2855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2855-temperamental/|5.3|Ryan Schreiber

    Birmingham, England.  They immediately went to work ""creating sounds and
    ideas for songs.""  Then the guy who runs the independent label Wurlitzer
    Jukebox put out their debut 7"".  After their first single was released, they
    finally started to go out and buy equipment. Take a guess as to what kind
    of gear they bought-- that's right!  ""Old drum machines, analogue keyboards 
    and effects.""  So far, these guys sound pretty inspired.</p><p>
    
    Plone's goal, apparently, is to create instrumental electronic pop music.
    Hence, their concept: ""timeless electronic melodies.""  They really are
    timeless, too, if you take that to mean you'll spend little or no time
    listening to them.  I guess <i>For Beginner Piano</i> sounds nice enough,
    though.  You've got your lilting, somber retro-future music (""Summer Plays
    Out""), your haunted forest music (""Press a Key""), and the incidental music
    for a lost level from ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"" (""Marbles"").  Sadly, Boards of
    Canada already beat Plone at their own game with the release of 1998's
    <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>.</p><p>
    
    On <i>For Beginner Piano</i>, the Plone guys just barely step over that line
    from being serious electronic experimentalists like the majority of their
    labelmates, to writing nicely-executed but predictable Sega Genesis music.
    No, it's not so bad if you can stay awake, but it's terribly bland.  In fact,
    it's the new elevator music.  Just wait and see if by 2010 doctor's offices
    aren't comforting their unhealthy visitors by playing this kind of low-volume
    ambient pop music over the lobby P.A.  And if nothing else, I can at least
    guarantee one of these tracks will show up in a luxury car ad before the
    year's out.</p><p>
    
    Like so many songs being sold to hip marketing campaigns these days, you can
    listen to any of <i>For Beginner Piano</i>'s ten tracks for hours without
    ever noticing they're there.  (I had headphones on, too.)  If these guys
    could just pick up the pace for a moment, or put some neat effect in there,
    or even just change the bpms-- anything to keep me interested-- this would
    be a whole different record.  Unfortunately, fate's chosen a different
    path for Plone-- one of everlasting obscurity and used bin damnation.</p></div>"|6348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6348-for-beginner-piano/|5.4|Ryan Schreiber

    in all creation. The press release opens with a claim that should not be made about anyone who
    is not Radiohead: ""Snow Patrol are the most exciting guitar band in the U.K."" When I hear that
    Thom Yorke blew his nose recently, it sends bolts of electricity down my spine. This is true of
    a great many people. Snow Patrol's PR should know this. My personal favorite error in this press
    kit is in reference to new Snow Patrol recruit Tom Simpson, who spins and plays keyboards at
    their live shows.  It speaks of the ""recent edition of Tom"" rather than the recent <i>addition</i>
    of Tom. To be fair, maybe they did upgrade from Tom 3.1 to Tom 2000 recently.  But probably not.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, the prodigious musical ability of these three Irishmen propels them past the
    inauspicious first impression given by their press kit. <i>Songs for Polarbears</i> is an
    impressive piece of work, made doubly so when it's considered that this is only a debut. This
    fact is easily forgotten while wandering through the sheer breadth of mature songwriting
    featured on this album, to the tune of 19 full-length songs. Snow Patrol craft very British,
    very smooth, very coherent guitar-based music which runs the gamut from slow, serene melodies
    to token sentimental ballads to ""please, kind sir, don't give me a wedgie"" driving rock. No
    song has been as overtly British as the ironically titled ""NYC"" in some time.  The track comes
    complete with the quasi-nonsensical repeated chorus lyric, ""I am so too,"" which follows its
    quasi-agitating repeated verse lyric, ""Is this on?""  But it all works, somehow.</p><p>
    
    Snow Patrol seem to have an early death grip on many of the finer musical elements which seem
    to completely elude many other groups: the subtle, floating chorus in ""The Last Shot Ringing in
    My Ears;"" the witty, yet not juvenile song title in ""Get Balsamic Vinegar... Quick You Fool;""
    the sing-along chorus that compliments a fast car and a sunny day perfectly in ""Downhill from
    Here;"" the brawl-inducing ""Holy Cow;"" even the hummed chorus in ""Velocity Girl."" The only miss
    on the album is ""Absolute Gravity,"" with its incongruous turntable action, provided by none
    other than the recent edition of Tom.</p><p>
    
    So do we blame Snow Patrol for not being Radiohead? Of course not. Instead, we revel in the
    multifarious distorted guitar splendor offered on <i>Songs for Polarbears</i> and chide naughty
    record companies who let Ted from the mail room proofread their press kits. Snow Patrol are an
    exciting band who could deliver a magnum opus in the not-so-distant future at their current rate
    of improvement.  Speaking of which, one more tip for the press kit makers: never again refer to
    the expansion of your band's fanbase as ""Viral growth."" You won't be likely to win many new
    converts.</p></div>"|7303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7303-songs-for-polarbears/|8.1|Taylor M. Clark

    Daughter are pretty average. Though their albums sound nice and pleasingly eclectic,
    there's very little about them that can be described as memorable. I've listened to
    <i>New Rock</i> dozens of times and I can't name a single song aside from the infectious
    ""Great Five Lakes.""  I'd sell it, but the swollen ranks of my local record store's
    Buffalo Daughter used CD rack tells me that a lot of people agree with me.</p><p>
    
    There are two versions of ""Great Five Lakes"" on the new Buffalo Daughter remix EP,
    <i>WXBD</i>, and both fall far short of the insanely catchy original. Kut Masta Kurt's
    take does little but unwisely clip the ringing two- chord acoustic riff that makes the
    song so great. (You know, Kurt's beat- making skills just don't make the grade, and I
    have to wonder, once again, how his name seems pops up everywhere; see also Kool Keith's
    solo joints.) And Cornelius has a rare dull track wherein he tosses in a played- out
    Yes sample and calls it a day.</p><p>
    
    So you wonder how, when my favorite song gets deconstructed and ruined twice, does this
    album still garner a 5.2? Surprisingly, there's some nice atmosphere going on elsewhere.
    Someone named Jopolo turns ""Sky High"" into a bubbly, underwater drone- fest, and Nardone's
    mix of ""Socks Drugs and Rock 'N' Roll"" strips it down into brooding downtempo.  I also
    dig Elite Force's very technoized ""R&amp;B; (Rhythm and Basement)"" with its churning 303 pattern,
    on- the- beat turntable scratching and positively booty- shaking breakdowns. And the trance-
    inducing vocal loop on ""Jellyfish Blues"" (remixed by Scratch Pet Land) lies atop a nice bed
    of digital cuddliness. Come to think of it, my favorite tunes here are the ones that feature
    less Buffalo Daughter and more remixer. But given the initial ingredients, I guess that makes
    sense.</p></div>"|1004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1004-wxbd-ep/|5.2|Mark Richard-San

    class citizens of the indie rock nation. Despite having played on some of Built
    to Spill's classic LPs, releasing four albums, and crafting some pretty damn
    good songs, Caustic Resin will forever remain ""the second best band in Boise""
    to all but a handful of rabid Resin fans.  Well, if any album were set to shake
    up these guys' image, it'd be their latest release, <i>Trick Question</i>. Sadly,
    though, changing your image is not necessarily the same as improving it.</p><p>
    
    This time around, Caustic Resin take some serious risks by purposefully
    downplaying most of the elements that tie them back to their contemporary rock
    brethren.  On <i>Trick Question</i>, the band has picked out a set of rules
    to play by with all the interest and anticipation of a person picking out their
    clothes for the day.  Unfortunately, the musical outlines they choose to follow
    are the ones for psychedelic stadium rock and early heavy metal-- styles best
    left to the 1970's.</p><p>
    
    Although you have to admire the girth of this trio's balls, the end product is
    blatantly forced and painfully uninspired. Throughout this album, Caustic Resin
    come off like a Pink Floyd cover band with Tony Iommi on guitars and The Pepsi
    Girl working the vocals.  Heavy, leaden, cliched guitar parts are the focal point 
    f each track, but the band's flashy licks and drawn- out solos more closely
    resemble the wailing of the damned than Metallica's <i>Master of Puppets</i>.</p><p>
    
    Yet, true to the spilt nature of this album, Caustic Resin has discovered a way to
    take the manliest of all music instruments-- the electric guitar-- and rip out all
    of its muscle.  In the meantime, the drumming is simply present, while the band's
    poor attempts as creativity-- the peppering of pianos, turntables and found sound--
    are mediocre at best and laughable at worst.  To add to the fun, frontman Brett
    Nelson's lyrics seem to have been copied straight out of a 9th grader's poetry-
    infected notebooks.</p><p>
    
    Topping off this triple layer shitcake are Nelson's vocals. On each of the songs,
    no matter the tempo, tone, or subject matter, Brett finds new and inventive ways
    to make his voice as grating as chewing a mouthful of tin foil.  I don't know what
    the guy was thinking when he chose to be a professional singer, but it sure as hell
    wasn't, ""You know, I can really sing.""  Despite decent tracks like ""Nice Wings
    You've Got There"" and ""Road Block,"" Nelson's warble, drenched tactlessly in delay
    and reverb, destroys any conceivable enjoyment that would have otherwise been
    extractable.  And songs that were bad to begin with-- like ""Slide,"" a six minute,
    thirty- nine second- long Soundgarden-esque dirge, become un-fucking-bearable.</p><p>
<i>Trick Question</i> just doesn't fit together, I tell ya.  Not in any way, at 
    any time.  The polarized nature of the music is interesting (particularly how 
    each song can be as dark and messy as a lump of coal, yet still manage to float
    lightly around the listener), but it's also stale and uninteresting.  If it's 
    meant to be a rock record, it comes off way too hazy to cut the mustard.  If it's
    meant to be a psychedelic record, it's too dumb and heavy- handed for its own good.
    If it's supposed to sound like this, I don't know what to tell you.</p></div>"|1357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1357-trick-question/|2.4|Steven Byrd

    through.  Trent's going to keep me up for at least another two hours with
    his latest bloated indulgence, <i>The Fragile</i>.  So I've got a pot of
    coffee.  It's black.  Pitch black.  As black as your fucking <i>soul</i>!
    And I'm typing on this machine.  This machine is grinding me down.  I feel
    like a fucking <i>machine</i>!  Grrrarrrgh!</p><p>
    
    9:00pm: My first experience with <i>The Fragile</i>, as is the case with
    most new CDs, comes in my Honda.  I'm sitting at a red light on Webster and
    Damen, waiting for a left turn.  Trent Reznor is screaming, ""Tear a hole
    exquisite red/ Fuck the rest and stab it dead"" over a troop of industrial
    guitars and digital whining.  I yawn with such stretching intensity that
    I miss my turn light.  The entire situation strikes me as particularly
    humorous.  Here I am-- a 24- year- old white guy with floppy bangs, wearing
    a tie, driving a Honda-- and all the bile Trent Reznor can must muster up
    from his supposedly scorched soul makes me yawn.</p><p>
    
    Sometime over the last decade, music that is intrinsically meant to be
    menacing (i.e. Nine Inch Nails) has become a banal syndicated- action hour
    soundtrack.  It's easy to imagine the overproduced grind of ""The Wretched""
    blaring through a TV screen as Nightman kicks a henchman off a roof.  This
    stuff could be the score to ""The Crow 4: In Space.""  And this time around,
    Trent has unanimously failed to shock anyone above the age of 15 and under 
    the age of 54.  I mean, have you listened to old Judas Priest lately?  Now,
    this is not to say music must be confrontational, although the best of it
    typically is.  However, in a pop society that has become numb to industrial
    sounds through ESPN2 and Surge commercials, it's no longer interesting or
    tolerable to base one's entire output on volume and amplified cliches.</p><p>
    
    And so ""Somewhat Damaged"" continues to pound out its same four notes.
    Systematically, layers of crust, fuzz, dirt, and whatever else Reznor can
    scrape off the walls in his studio are piled on top, pounding out the same
    four- note scale.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  Ooh, wow, did he just say
    ""fuck?""  Trent, Holden Caulfield rubbed that out 50 years ago.</p><p>
    
    8:00pm: ""Hello?"" asks Ryan.</p><p>
    
    ""Okay, I'm going to read you something,"" I say.</p><p>
    
    ""Oh, hey dude. Um, sure.""</p><p>
    
    ""'She shines/ In a world full of ugliness/ She matters/ When everything
    is meaningless.'""</p><p>
    
    ""Oh, man.""</p><p>
    
    ""'Sometimes I have everything/ Yet I wish I felt something.'""</p><p>
    
    ""Are these lyrics?""</p><p>
    
    ""'Underneath it all/ We feel so small/ The Heavens fall / But still we
    crawl.'""</p><p>
    
    ""Haha.  What is this?""</p><p>
    
    ""Pleading and/ Needing and/ Bleeding and/ Breeding and/ Feeding/ Exceeding.""</p><p>
    
    ""Rhyme-y.""</p><p>
    
    ""Now everything is clear/ I can erase the fear/ I can disapper.""</p><p>
    
    ""Man, what is this.  Is this some emo album?""</p><p>
    
    ""I am every fucking thing and just a little more/ And when I suck you off
    not a drop will go to waste/ It's really not so bad, you know, once you get
    past the taste, yeah/ Starfuckers.""</p><p>
    
    ""No.  Oh, no.  No.  It's Nine Inch Nails!""</p><p>
    
    1:49am: ""Even Deeper,"" a track mixed by Dr. Dre, spits aluminum riffs
    into my headphones.  The entire concept of pairing of Dr. Dre and Nine Inch
    Nails, a match maid in Kornboy heaven (or most likely the Interscope
    commissary) is laughable.  Shuffling beats squirt under ""Blade Runner"" booms
    and fathoms of string samples.  The end product sounds entirely similar to
    the rest of this 104- minute albatross.   The token celebrity stroking of
    this studio marriage is fittingly overwrought, unnecessary and done with
    questionable intent.  From the sound of it, Trent cares little to broaden
    his palate from this rap/ rock union.  Without the liner notes, one would
    never pick this song as ""the Dr. Dre track.""</p><p>
    
    Ironically, a man hailed by his legion of testoster- drones as ""genius""
    often leans heavily on the work of other, better sound wizards.  Adrian
    Belew, Steve Albini, and Alan Moulder conspicuously leave their fingerprints
    all over <i>The Fragile</i>.  In other words, whenever something sounds
    cool, it's most likely coming from one of these other men, who have worked
    on such mind- blowing classics like Talking Heads' <i>Remain in Light</i>,
    Slint's <i>Spiderland</i>, and My Bloody Valentine's <i>Loveless</i>,
    respectively.  The constipated drone of ""The Day the World Went Away""
    unabashedly attempts to mimic My Bloody Valentine's sculpted cacophony.
    Unfortunately, from the hands of an unsubtle goth, the result is strained
    fuzz.</p><p>
    
    2:00am: Trent Reznor is the worst, most predictable, most uninspired
    lyricist working today.  The freshman gloom spouted throughout <i>The
    Fragile</i> are only making it easier for the Goth Lyric Generators on
    the web.  Copy the word decay from this sentence.  Paste it into a Word
    document.  Highlight it.  Press Shift-F7.  Every synonym that appears on
    your thesaurus screen pops up in Trent Renzor's pitiful poetry.  Coming
    from the mouth of a steadily plumping, thirtysomething recluse (who,
    incidentally, is bearing striking resemblance to Phil Hartman's SNL
    Frankenstein character these days), it's just sad.  Does he collect
    candelabras and ""Spawn"" comics?  I guarantee it.  In the five years it's
    taken to complete <i>The Fragile</i>, Trent seemingly watched Dark City at
    least 40 times.  It's insulting to hear Trent and his PR firm talk up the
    ""radical departure"" and pop flourishes on this record because the record
    sounds 100% similar to <i>Broken</i> and <i>The Downward Spiral</i>.  Or
    more accurately, it's like combining <i>Broken</i> and <i>The Downward
    Spiral</i>.  Clever.</p><p>
    
    2:45am: The gentle piano plunking of ""La Mer"" lulls me to sleep momentarily
    on its second time around.  It's not the gentle ambience of it, though,
    since this loud sludge could knock out a speed addict.  <i>The Fragile</i>
    is the most taxing record I've ever had to work through in my five years of
    reviewing CDs.  I mean, even the Beatles failed to make a double album
    without throwing in some filler.  Why does Trent Reznor thinking he can
    succeed?  I'm actually glad Billy Corgan used up <i>The Infinite Sadness</i>.
    Reznor would jump all over a title like that.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to decide where to even begin trimming <i>The Fragile</i>.
    It's so stunningly monotonous.  Any bit of it could be lost without notice.
    I mean, when the instrumental interludes carry an album, it's a blaring neon
    sign flashing ""stay away!""  I pity the kids of the style- over- substance
    generation-- and yes, it will only be kids-- who enjoy this album.  Kids,
    high school isn't as bad as it seems.   You'll grow out of this phase.  Save
    yourself, or your parents, the 25 bucks.  <i>The Fragile</i>'s length begins
    to make sense in this context.  104 minutes is the perfect duration for
    those post- dinner, pre- ""X-Files"" periods of ""nobody understands me""
    bedroom isolation sit-ins.</p><p>
    
    3:00am: Before getting back into <i>The Fragile</i>, I peruse the liner
    notes and artwork.  David Carson of ""Raygun"" fame laid out the artwork for
    <i>The Fragile</i>.  And what a fitting look!  Carson, whose design work
    broke new ground for typography, lost touch years ago.  The originator of 
    the 1990s' trademark ""crusty look"" is analogous to the fat- bottomed disco
    fonts of the '70s or the thin sans- serif of deco.  But guess what?  It's
    almost 2000 and the world needs a new look and a new sound.  Carson and
    Reznor will forever be remembered as 1990s pop figures that helped create
    an identifiable logo for the decade, and little else.  Trent, you are Flock
    of Seagulls.  <i>The Fragile</i> embodies everything wrong with this decade--
    hype, letdown, technological fetishism, empty rage, financial bloat, bombast,
    self- loathing, and indifference to anything truly important and interesting
    flowing underneath the surface.  Trent Reznor is Chris Gaines.</p><p>
    
    3:20am: ""Starfuckers, Inc.""  That's pretty much all I have to say in
    criticism of this album.  That sums it right up.  Do you or don't you want
    to own an album with a song called ""Starfuckers, Inc?""  Besides the
    snickering potty- mouthed title, it's one of the most blatantly hypocritical
    attacks ever put to tape.   It's a widely- publicized attack on Marilyn
    Manson.  There are several lyrical references to the gangly idiot such as
    ""I'm one of the beautiful ones"" and ""My god pouts on the cover of a
    magazine."" And how are these jabs delivered?  Why, in a song which sounds
    <i>exactly</i> like Marilyn Manson (and also borrows from Carly Simon), by
    a man who pouts on the cover of Rolling Stone, Alternative Press, Spin, etc.</p><p>
    
    In essence, Reznor is Marilyn Manson without the makeup (which is a bit like
    Kiss without the makeup).  <i>The Fragile</i> is simply <i>Music for 'The
    Elder</i> for the digital age.  I take comfort knowing that the passing of
    another decade will make this record seem as amusingly insincere as 10CC.</p><p>
    
    And at this point, I'm angry, hungry, and frustrated.  In fact, I feel like
    kinda like Trent Reznor.  Is this the grand design?  After over two hours of
    listening to his incessant whining and grating, I've become the very model
    of his audience.</p></div>"|5799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5799-the-fragile/|2.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

Suppose I wrote in
    great and excruciating detail of the turtle's slow journey, describing each deliberate motion
    in real time as you read on in search of my thoughts on Lullaby for the Working Class' third
    album, <i>Song</i>.  Maybe I'd slow continue on about the turtle's journey across the highway--
    about how cars of varying makes and models (which I also would describe to you, along with the
    conditions of their paint jobs and their drivers) zoomed past it, you would eventually grow
    bored and tired, clicking over to the Pitchfork news page to find out once and for all whether
    or not Pavement actually broke up.</p><p>
    
    Now imagine sitting next to me on the bus.  I'm telling you a story about my fourth birthday.
    A half an hour has passed and you've already learned of the grand party thrown for me by my
    parents.  You've learned of the clown that scared children as clowns inevitably do, and of the
    large cake upon which ""Happy Birthday, Neil"" was written in icing.  Now, if you're of right mind,
    you're shooting out the door at the next stop, or perhaps even jumping out the window as the
    bus slows for a turn.</p><p>
    
    In either of the above cases, you might notice the care with which I tell my story, recognizing
    certain beautiful episodes.  You'd notice the sensitivity with which I wrote of the truck driver
    who swerves to hit the turtle, or the sublime beauty of a drunken clown's gift to a boy on the
    anniversary of the kid's birth.  But in the end, you'd be bored.  Neither of these tales are
    particularly compelling in and of themselves, and told slowly in terrible detail, they only
    become bogged in their own pointlessness.  Lullaby for the Working Class' <i>Song</i> is the
    sound of that bogging.</p><p>
    
    About a year ago, I wrote on this website of Chris Whitley's guitar stylings, noting his
    incredible ability to elicit more sound out of a single guitar than many full bands can coax
    from their instruments.  That statement holds true when talking about Lullaby.  Eleven people
    play on the album's first track, ""Expand, Contract,"" and after untold listening, all eleven
    fail to even dent my consciousness.  Sure, the band's nearly symphonic arrangements are pretty,
    but here they function only to their own ineffective end.  Without individually compelling songs
    to add support, the arrangements are details without a storyline.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, a reverse paradigm operates throughout the album.  The songs seem to serve
    merely as skeletons for the band's arrangements, creating the ultimate irony of the album's
    title.  A secondary irony exists in the album's structure, which both begins and ends with
    long droning buzzes that serve as the album's only attention- grabbing moments.  But guys,
    why limit yourself to just the working class?  The rich could sleep to this just as well.</p></div>"|4910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4910-song/|4.8|Neil Lieberman

    Perhaps they're sluggishly digesting a Biggie Meal in a fast- food booth.  A mechanized cupid
    hovers over their shoulders.  Hues of gray and pastel depict the scene with high school strokes.
    It's fitting, since the music contained within merely cranks the greaseless gears of insipid,
    mind- numbingly uninspired, adolescent pop, bringing humanity a few inches closer to self-
    wrought destruction through resignation.  When did pop become the Attention Deficit Disorder
    of rock music?  These days, parents and teachers quickly diagnose students with A.D.D., when
    90% of the time they're simply lazy, drug- hazed, or stupid.  It's an insult to the children
    who truly suffer from A.D.D.  Similarly, being ""pop"" has granted bands the luxury of not trying.
    And society merely throws record deals and Ritalin at the problem.</p><p>
    Really, what qualifies as pop?  Anything.  If something is released to the general public and
    is theoretically consumable, it's pop.  No longer will the excuse, ""Oh, but it's just pop,"" be
    accepted.  Erase that hate-mail.  Hamburger Helper is pop.  My sneaker from Target is pop.  A
    Sprite jingle is pop.  A coin- dispensed rubber glow- in- the- dark bouncing ball shaped like
    an alien head is pop.  Naturally, I can't justly criticize anyone for indulging in pop without
    being hypocritical.  But look around-- we're suspended in a homogenous gel of pop.  Pop is free. 
    You don't need to spend $12.99 on an R.D.A. of pop.  Turn on the radio.  Tune to any station
    marketed towards white people between the ages of 12 and 27.  You're going to hear a song that
    can easily be substituted for any track off <i>Something to Write Home About</i>.</p><p>
    Is it so much to ask for a shred of originality in music?  A frustrated ""Wrragh!"" from the
    singer, or an unexpected car alarm would at least trigger a central nervous system response
    in the listener.  The Get Up Kids write from assumption, not passion.  Each song is about
    missing, wanting, or needing a girl who is typically ""a world away.""  I'd like to get into
    the impossibilities and improbabilities of two people actually being ""a world away,"" but
    I'll let the obviously empty clich√© fight for itself.  I'd rather focus on meaningless lyrics
    masquerading as poetic insight, such as ""I smuggle myself into new nationalities.""  One can
    not smuggle oneself, excepting by stowing away in an antique schooner-- and those don't exist
    anymore.  Further, a ""nationality,"" which is an adjective or notion of self set by political
    boundaries, is not a physical object which can accept smuggled cargo.  These flaws would be
    easier to swallow if delivered with soul or conviction.  Instead we're left with the nasal
    whining of another pompadoured youth who recently received his degree from the Bratty School
    of Caucasian Nostril Singing, along with his classmates, the Guy from Lit, the Guy from Smash
    Mouth, the Guy from Blink 182, and the Guy from Showoff.</p><p>
    The implementation of keyboards and acoustic guitars is predictable and unimpressive.  Tinkling
    keys behind styrofoam riffs attempt to ""mature"" the sound.  Instead, the clinical production
    scrubs the rock down to a smooth grain of clear sand which wedges unreachable into the crotch.
    Only after a repetitive process that borders on ""brainwashing"" can the melodies even began to
    tunnel into your brain like a chigger.</p><p>
    The Get Up Kids quickly point to the large record deals they turned down to ""stay independent.""
    Most labels urged the band to re-record ""Don't Hate Me"" from the band's debut.  So the Kids
    ""kept it real"" and recorded an entire album of songs which follow the same formula, yet never
    reach the quasi- memorable qualities of a radio hit.  Yet, a merchandise catalog falls out of
    <i>Something to Write Home About</i> upon opening.  The band's decision to not sign with a major
    just makes them seem financially inept in addition to their musical shortcoming.  You guys, just
    sell out!  Independent music does not need you.  Pick out those leather pants and jump into the
    mill.</p></div>"|3430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3430-something-to-write-home-about/|2.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

    Trees frontman Mark Lanegan eschews the original song's doo-wop background
    singers and muffles the plush horn section that bears its Stax/Volt pedigree.
    He leans his gravelly groan on the chorus' lead in (""You're gonna need a man/
    A man who'll understand""), lending urgency and a smoky mystery to this
    otherwise fairly pedestrian refrain.  Why does the woman in this song need
    so much understanding?  Why is her need so dire?  What has she done to cause
    the abandonment of her friends?  There's a creeping darkness in Lanegan's
    voice here-- something not apparent in the jumpy R&amp;B; of the original.  It's
    the realization of a transgression unimaginable at the time of the track's
    original release.  By the time Lanegan gets around to crooning the song's
    plaintive chorus, we're left wondering if his ostracized subject really has
    any choice but to accept his offer.</p><p>
    
    By slightly tweaking its connotation, Lanegan transports the song into a
    context of his own making.  It's this context, carried across the 11 covers
    on <i>I'll Take Care of You</i>, that allows the album's unique success.
    Compared to standard cover songs, where there's almost always an obvious
    disconnect between the song and the band, Lanegan makes these songs his
    own.  See, this is a collection of songs that are of the same origin and
    landscape as Lanegan's previous works-- a landscape recognizable as the
    stark, tortured midnight soul of his previous three solo affairs.  And
    while molding classics-- like O.V. Wright's gospel testimony ""On Jesus'
    Program"" or the traditional ""Little Sadie""-- into this landscape may not
    seem like a stretch, placing them seamlessly alongside the Gun Club's
    ""Carry Home"" and the Leaving Trains' ""Creeping Coastline of Lights""
    definitely is.</p><p>
    
    Superficially, <i>I'll Take Care of You</i> isn't much of an achievement
    for Lanegan.  After all, he didn't write any of these songs, and he doesn't
    explore much new sonic territory.  It's the type of album artists generally
    release to fulfill a contract or take a breather.  But examined closely,
    it's much more than that.  Because in this collection, Lanegan's managed to
    tug on the timeless threads that hold the patchwork of American music together.
    And that's certainly something to consider.</p></div>"|4676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4676-ill-take-care-of-you/|7.5|Neil Lieberman

    ""Blue Milk,"" the stultifying fourteen- minute drone which slowly spins in
    the middle of <i>Cobra and Phases Group Plays Voltage in the Milky Night</i>
    like a interest- sucking blackhole, brings to mind Michael Snow's 1967 ""short""
    film ""Wavelength,"" in that it soars to new levels of vexation and artistic
    solipsism.  Actually, Stereolab might take this as a compliment, since they
    named the first track on <i>Dots and Loops</i> after avant- garde filmmaker
    Stan Brakhage, and they evidently lounge around in plastic furniture wearing
    thick turtlenecks, smoking long- stemmed pipes, and debating the subtle
    differences between Josef Alberts' blue and yellow paintings.</p><p>
    
    A slow zoom across a minimally- decorated city loft comprises the entire
    45 minutes of ""Wavelength.""   Set to the sound of a constant tone, which
    gradually increases in pitch, the zoom closes on a framed photograph of
    ocean waves.  This is such a cheeky joke for a supposedly groundbreaking
    art film.  The director drags the viewers through grating boredom to
    deliver a pun which is obvious from the first frame.  Like most avant-
    garde art, it might have a valid statement, but it's not a process an audience
    needs to or wants to go through.  A brief verbal description would suffice.
    On <i>Voltage</i>, their eighth LP, Stereolab sink so deep into their socialist
    cocktail jazz schtick that they typify this flaw.  Frigid noodling, insipid
    harmonies, and unmemorable repetition lazily waft from yawning French- poseurs.
    Fractions of this soulless wankery might stimulate the academic, but when the
    album clocks in at nearly twice the length of ""Wavelength,"" it becomes a
    Herculean test of human attention.</p><p>

    Dear Diary,</p><p>
    
    Is this ever going to end?  My lord.  The album keeps changing styles, but
    it all sounds exactly the same.  There's only so much twinkling vibraphone I
    can take.  Stereolab are beyond hope.  They spent more time coming up with the
    overwrought album title than their ""lyrics.""  The saddest part is that they
    claim the title is called that strictly because of its length-- they needed it
    to run that long to ""fit into the album design.""  Um... the album cover is
    orange atari text on brown.  What a fitting analogy for everything that is
    wrong with Stereolab these days.  The liner notes are illegible and gaudy.
    When a band makes a point of extensively discussing their cover art (which
    ends up looking last- minute and tacky, regardless) over writing quality songs,
    you know they've completely lost touch.  Even in music, Marxism doesn't work.</p><p>

    Idea for a movie:<br/>
    Louie Anderson is Jim O'Rourke in a lighthearted cyber- tragedy.  Jim travels
    to Japan in 2010 to visit the frozen head of Burt Bacharach.  The head is kept
    in a museum by the docks.  When Jim arrives, he finds the museum in disrepair.
    Burt Bacharach's head watches television from inside a jar.  Jim tries lift
    the spirit of Burt with tales of his work.  Jim loves to emulate Burt Bacharach,
    under the veil of structureless noise.  Jim plays Burt a tape he recorded with a
    band called Stereolab.  There are string flourishes and sweeping horns mixed to
    a dull matte.  Burt says, ""That's great, baby, but where are the songs?""  Jim
    tells Burt those are the songs.  Burt tells Jim that songs need a story, not
    beatnik freeform.  Jim says that he thought Burt was a beatnik.  Burt laughs.
    Burt tells Jim that his having lived in the sixties does not make him a beatnik.
    Jim cries.  Burt tells Jim that he wrote songs for the radio, to make money,
    and doesn't quite understand art. Aliens invade Japan and Jim is forced to eat
    the head of Burt Bacharach. Roll credits over blooper reel.</p></div>"|7498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7498-cobra-and-phases-group-play-voltage-in-the-milky-night/|3.4|Brent DiCrescenzo

The first     pool of artists, either newcomers rewarded for the ingenuity inherent in     merely possessing a new voice on the scene-- or elders of whom we've learned     to expect little more-- tend to be judged on the merits of their output's     strongest songs alone.  A newcomer finding success under the lower tier, one     who establishes the kind of expectations that ride the back of credibility,     may find him or herself flung into the second pool, where output is judged     solely on its worst moments.  Simply put, reviewers, and fans in general,     apply the bias of our expectations on artists.  Is this fair?  Perhaps not,     but considering the artist is asking us to buy a second, third, or twelfth     album, I suppose we deserve a good old- fashioned reason why.</p>
<p>Ben Harper once resided among the neophytes of the first pool.  An eclectic     writer and musician, Harper was blessed with many crowns upon the release of     his debut, the dour <i>Welcome to the Cruel World</i>.  On the album's best     tracks, he seemed rock's social conscience and the heir apparent to the fusion     of soul, funk and rock championed by the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley.     We easily ignored the album's less successful moments, and rightfully so.     <i>Fight for Your Mind</i> followed and found Harper expanding his already     substantial range (the album's two best songs, ""Ground On Down"" and ""Burn     One Down"" are among the best funk and reggae this decade has produced) and     building on the foundation of his first release.  However, the album retained     some of the first's miscues, in particular, the slow- plodding ballads that     seem to be a motif for the young Californian.</p>
<p><i>Will to Live</i> was, in some respects, a relief, and in others, more     troublesome. Harper seemed to hone his vision, and in doing so mitigated some     of the previous albums' lows.  He turned towards a more straight- forward rock     sound, mirroring Lenny Kravitz's shift towards center after <i>Let Love Rule</i>.     While this transformation helped Harper produce perhaps his most consistent     work to date, it also rendered the album a bit bland.  Harper's eclectic vision     had all but disappeared, and the album enjoyed few great revelations.  That the     album disappointed was perhaps the first sign that Harper had graduated into the     second tier of artists-- the ones who carry our expectations as their burden.</p>
<p>If so, then <i>Burn to Shine</i> may be an equally telling sign that he's not     quite ready.  Harper continues the trends formed on <i>Will to Live</i>, moving     further toward simple classic rock songs and away from the hints of emotional     complexity that brought him his best achievements.  Though the ragtime jaunt     ""Suzie Blue"" is a feign (and an unwelcome one at that), Harper plays a plainer     hand here.  The album's first three tracks are exasperatingly mediocre by his     standards, and although his Robert Plant imitation on ""The Woman in You"" saves     the song, the repetition of its chorus ad nauseam begins a trend that often     isn't graced with similar rescue throughout the remainder of the album.  ""Less,""     on the other hand, is a stab at heavy metal, which is all the further I choose     to comment on it.</p>
<p>But once again, Ben Harper manages to string together moments of brilliance.     The trio formed by the warm- hearted raga ""Steal My Kisses,"" the rockin' title     cut, and the soulful ""Show Me a Little Shame,"" are the strength of the album,     and more or less carry the listener through its less- than- spectacular     remainder.  For better or worse, these finer moments set a higher standard for     Harper.  And this being the guy's fourth album, we really need more than a few     great songs to make it worth the cash.  Harper is an electric performer and his     risky but blistering live cover of Hendrix's ""Voodoo Chile"" hints at his rightful     place among today's rock musicians.  Unfortunately, <i>Burn to Shine</i> fails to     put him there.</p></div>"|3748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3748-burn-to-shine/|6.0|Neil Lieberman

    journalism is Jon Spencer.  It really surprises me that <i>Orange</i> didn't
    make it into Spin's Top 90 (let alone the Pitchfork list).  Especially since
    it seems they just called up the Village Voice and said, ""Umm, we've been doing
    cover stories on Britney Spears and Kid Rock for the past few months, and before
    that it was the Backstreet Boys... uh... let's see.  Spice Girls.  Dang.  The
    last hip thing we covered was Nirvana.  What was cool in the '90s?"" And then
    the Village Voice would say, ""Well, for a while there we liked the Jon Spencer
    Blues Explosion, but they didn't turn out to be gay enough for our tastes.""
    ""Then it's settled, we'll put another PJ Harvey album on the list, and finish
    'er off with Basement Jaxx.""</p><p>
    
    Of course, Jon Spencer's done plenty that none of us should be proud of.
    Fortunately, this release of b-sides and remixes that accompany 1998's
    <i>Acme</i> is not one of those things.  There are a few laugh- out- loud bits
    of musical comedy, like Spencer leering, ""Baby, have you ever had a hot dog?""
    or listing his favorite condiments on the remix of ""Magical Colors.""  Or the 
    ""Soul Trance"" skit where the Blues Explosion headlines at a club that was
    supposed to feature Bel Biv Devoe.  Not to mention a bit of Redd Fox- inspired
    smut on ""Lap Dance.""</p><p>
<i>Xtra Acme USA</i>'s finest moments, though, are the brand spankin' new ones.
    ""Wait a Minute"" kicks the album off with Spencer coming as close to his dream of 
    being the Rolling Stones as he's ever been.  He conducts the hits like James 
    Brown on ""Get Down Lover"" and reaffirms his rockabilly/ punk roots on 
    ""Electricity"" and ""Hell.""</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, this record's a little heavy on the filler, but there are moments
    here that leave the original <i>Acme</i> in the dust.  Why didn't some of these
    songs make the cut?  Instead of releasing two pretty good records, he could have
    made one great one.  I guess that's why you don't see him next to Nusrat Fateh
    Ali Khan, Tom Ze and the Manic Street Preachers at the decade's end.</p></div>"|4291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4291-xtra-acme-usa/|7.1|Jared Bane

    to Greensboro, North Carolina. My best memory from the trip was driving
    between Memphis and Nashville, listening to WSM, the home of the Grand Old
    Opry. There's something about the production in country music from the early
    '50s to the early '70s. In those days, the only way to get records to sound
    good coming out of crappy AM radios was to thicken the reverb to the
    saturation point. This meant that Patsy Cline and Kitty Wells sounded like
    they were singing about broken hearts from the belly of a hollowed- out
    submarine. And that, my friends, is a lonesome sound.</p><p>
    
    Lee Hazlewood, who cut his musical teeth during this time, understands this
    lonesome sound. Best known as the writer of Nancy Sinatra's hit ""These Boots
    are Made for Walkin',"" Hazlewood was an enigmatic contemporary of Phil
    Spector whose gift for melody and arrangement graced many a hit single in
    the '60s. On his own records, Hazlewood can be seen as a kind of urban
    cowboy- meets- Leonard Cohen figure whose thick baritone is consistently in
    tune and affecting. After moving to Sweden in the early 1970s, Hazlewood's
    records fell out of print and became much sought after by fanatical (and
    rich) collectors. Hearing the freshly reissued <i>Requiem for an Almost
    Lady</i>, one can see what the fuss is all about.</p><p>
    
    Originally released in 1971, <i>Requiem</i> has a concept-- one you can
    probably guess from the title. To give you an idea where Hazlewood is coming
    from, on the liner notes he writes ""In retrospect... these songs were not
    written about or for one lady or two or even three... they are a composite
    of all my memories of ladies, since I became aware of memories and ladies...""
    Cheesy? God, yes. And the between- song spoken interludes, laced with similar
    platitudes about life, love and loss, can be a little hard to endure initally.</p><p>
    
    Still, taken as a whole, with Hazlewood's stellar production and subtle,
    understated arrangements (mostly just bass and guitar), the album becomes
    something greater. An artifact, sure-- sadly, they don't record voices like
    this any more, all rich and full of romantic atmosphere. But there's something
    else at work, a simplicity that yields a kind of grandeur.</p><p>
    
    The melodies (particularly on such weepers as ""If It's Monday Morning"" and ""I'll
    Live Yesterdays"") show that Hazlewood fully understood the power of the 1-5
    change. The words are simple storytelling in the country- folk vein-- engaging
    stories laced with humor and keen observation. And the chamber- tonk production
    adds a showman's sheen to these roadhouse blues. Dylan was plowing these same
    fields in the early '70s on <i>New Morning</i> and <i>Nashville Skyline</i>, but
    he was too confused at that point do it with Hazlewood's panache. Memories and
    ladies, ah yes... Lee got it right.</p></div>"|3785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3785-requiem-for-an-almost-lady/|8.4|Mark Richard-San

    which one can trade in for something more worthy of aural ingestion.  But what about all the used discs that
    you know in the bottom of your heart will never be sold?  The bottomless $1.99 bins would surely be an
    intimidating reminder of cash spent lost to pimply-faced adolescents peddling Phatfunk discs.  What to do
    with these materially valueless artifacts?</p><p>
    If you're Amsterdam record shop owner Elizabeth Esselink, you go through the racks, sample the best bits, 
    and wage war with the Hitmeister.  As Solex, Esselink assembles junk-pop symphonies from unwanted discs and
    lays distinctive Casio lines and sultry stream-of-consciousness storylines on top.  But this is no dead-end
    process, as one might expect-- <i>Pick Up</i> is the second long-player of Esselink's distinctively bouncy,
    nonsensical songwriting, and takes several steps forward from her intriguing debut, <i>Solex vs. the
    Hitmeister</i>.</p><p>
    Esselink's accomplished sampler orchestrations are more self-assured this time around.  The title track opens
    with a muted trumpet and a rapidly accelerating beat before blossoming into a sing-songy assemblage of
    portentous horn punctuations and guitar strummage.  She displays a chaotic command of rhythm in propelling
    her pieces forward-- every musical snatch follows its own platonic beat but somehow results in an illogically
    swinging lilt.  By the end of ""Randy Costanza,"" for example, Esselink has managed to cram two repeating string
    motifs alongside a two-looped guitar chord structure, and throw a polyrhythmic shuffle in for good measure.
    The intrinsic tempos of each vie against the rest for cadenced domination, but the result is harmonious flow.
    It shouldn't work, but it does.</p><p>
    Esselink's vocals lend cohesion to the songs, and her lyrics give you something else to wrap your head around
    when following the musical free-association becomes too much.  With song titles like ""That's What You Get with
    People like That on Cruises like These..."", ""Another Tune Like 'Not Fade Away',"" and ""That'll Be $22.95,"" rest
    assured that her lyrical muse is as eccentric and far-reaching as her musical one.</p><p>
<i>Pick Up</i> is hearty pop fun for the detritus age.  Esselink's productions are so characteristic, however,
    that it's difficult not to feel bogged down by the musical cut-and-paste formulae.  And though she enlisted
    some friends to flesh out assorted tracks with original instrumental contributions, one could hardly tell.
    Nevertheless, <i>Pick Up</i> is a strong developmental achievement in the right direction for Solex, and should
    stand as inspiration for used record store owners the world over.</p></div>"|7323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7323-pick-up/|7.6|S. Murray

So what if the Messiah didn't turn up on the Eve of the New Millennium?
    What do we need some sandled beardy-weirdy for, anyway?  Less than two full months into 2000,
    we got Primal Scream's Molotov incendiary device, <i>Exterminator</i>, which resurrected the
    emaciated, once-revolutionary specters of the Stooges and the MC5, and stomped dusted-up beats
    all over them.  Brill!</p><p>
    
    The rollover of the century also saw avant-jazz taking on electronica and offering us the hope
    that smooth jazz wasn't the end of the road for that great tradition.  Compare Autechre's
    <i>LP5</i> with Elliot Sharpe's <i>Errata</i> and you'll be gobsmacked by the similarities and
    the friendly rivalries.  Shit, what if Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver had had PowerBooks and
    CuBase rather than rusty trombones and bordello pianos?  What freaky shit we'd be listening
    to now! What if John Coltrane...?  Or Ornette Coleman...?</p><p>
    
    The Cinematic Orchestra (aka J. Swinscoe) is coming from the other angle.  He's a veteran
    electronica producer taking on jazz.  And unlike Sharp's ripping up of conventions, Swinscoe's
    hung up on admiration.  <i>Motion</i> is nothing less than a beat-driven tribute to Miles Davis'
    collaborations with third stream arranger/composer Gil Evans.  Those 50's records (<i>Sketches
    of Spain</i>, <i>Quiet Nights</i>, <i>Miles Ahead</i>, for example) threw away the hard-bop
    rulebook and attempted to find a third path between the irreverence of jazz and the academics
    of the classical tradition.  Davis had already expressed that interest when his nonet recorded
    <i>The Birth of the Cool</i>, but the idea was fully realized on his recordings with Gil
    Evans.</p><p>
    
    Swinscoe obviously adores the glowing discords and the curious harmonies of ""Saeta"" (from
    <i>Sketches of Spain</i>) and he's built <i>Motion</i> around them. Rather than using a
    sampler to do all the work, he's pulled together a small band and let his drum machine
    contribute the beats.</p><p>
    
    The opening track, ""Durian,"" incorporates a sample of Nina Simone's heart-wrenching
    rendition of ""Strange Fruit"" and builds the close brass harmonies to a forceful climax.
    ""Diabolus"" takes a different approach to the same end and closes with an almost ambient
    coda.  However, <i>Motion</i> is ironically rigid. The hip-hop beats aren't sufficient to
    overcome Swinscoe's reverence for the tradition he cops from.  Too often the flow is ponderous
    and self-conscious.</p><p>
    
    If Swinscoe had allowed his musicians the freedom of a true blowin'
    session, <i>Motion</i> could have been a signal moment in the much-needed dialog between the
    electronic and jazz avant-gardes.  Instead, the album simply restates the obvious, however
    beautifully.  The revolution will not be held in a trendy coffee bar and Jesus won't return
    until he's sure that there's some kick-ass music down here to soundtrack his second coming
    and the destruction of all those whining bastards who've been bothering his poor, defenseless
    father for centuries.</p></div>"|1467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1467-motion/|6.7|Paul Cooper

Merge, Warp and Matador
    all have spankin' new compilations to prove their roster as the most influential, the
    most widely respected or the most diverse around.  There's no doubt that Matador has
    been very good to us over the years, bringing up some of the most legendary indie rock
    bands of the decade-- Yo La Tengo, Pavement, Guided by Voices, Chavez and Pizzicato
    Five.  But let's not forget all the bad times we shared.  Who wants to own records by
    bands like the Shams, Bassholes, the Toiling Midgets, or the Demolition Doll Rods?</p><p>
    
    The New York label's new 10 Year anniversary package, <i>Everything is Nice</i>, makes
    for a pretty bizarre sampling.  In a lot of ways, it seems like a random selection of
    songs that draw mostly from Matador's last five years.  But perhaps there's a reason
    for that.  <i>What's Up Matador</i>, a similar compilation released back in 1997,
    crammed 24 of the imprint's greatest moments of all time, along with 20 additional
    slices of rare songs onto two discs and sold it for $9.99.  All the good stuff was
    represented.  But they can't very well release the same compilation two years later.</p><p>
    
    Like <i>What's Up Matador</i>, <i>Everything is Nice</i> is specially- priced-- you
    can usually find it for under $12.  The big question is: ""Are we getting our money's
    worth?""  Simply put, no.  Instead of getting a ton of great songs, you get a few
    bad songs, a few mediocre songs, and a (very) few great songs you likely already own.
    This is not wall- to- wall brilliance.  People that should be represented here-- Liz
    Phair, Superchunk, Unsane, Bettie Serveert, Silkworm, Spoon, the Fall, Railroad Jerk,
    the Frogs, and SF Seals-- get the shaft.  Instead, we're presented either with tracks
    from less- inspiring new signings like Non Phixion, the Wisdom of Harry, Arab Strap,
    and Pole, or songs off the Warp roster (for which Matador handles stateside distribution).
    Dude, if I want Warp stuff, why wouldn't I pick up <i>their</i> 10 Year Anniversary
    compilation?</p><p>
    
    Sure, there are a couple of decent tracks mixed in just to keep you interested--
    Pavement's ""Stereo,"" Yo La Tengo's ""Sugarcube,"" Unwound's ""No Tech,"" Guided by
    Voices' ""Official Ironman Rally Song,"" and Cornelius' ""Count Five or Six.""
    But, for your $12, you mainly get what amounts to two promo label samplers, and a new
    disc of tossed- off b-sides and live tracks.  (Honestly!  If, after all the extraneous
    Blues Explosion comps on Matador and K, there remains a Jon Spencer track that hasn't
    been released yet, it must be absolutely horrific.)  Why drop your cash on such a
    sub-standard marketing ploy when you could buy <i>Slanted and Enchanted</i> for less?</p></div>"|1927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1927-everything-is-nice/|4.4|Ryan Schreiber

Wow, good guess! It <i>was</i>
    my post-college ""oh fuck, what now"" trip. During the course of travel, my
    itinerary morphed into something that bore absolutely no resemblance to The
    Plan; I wound up spending most of my time in the Middle East, OD'ing on hummus
    and crapping gravy.  For one senseless reason or another, I refused to rid
    myself of the ludicrously heavy <i>Europe On a Shoestring</i> book I'd so
    thoughtfully packed-- a book I felt like such a joke for owning when I became
    aware that every directionless twenty-something traveler was scripting their
    grand adventures by the same corny tome.</p><p>
    Regardless, I kept it. A few weeks after coming home to Florida, I was
    leafing through it, reading up on countries I didn't and never intend to
    visit, when I came to the chapter on Iceland. I skimmed until I got to the
    part about what passes for Icelandic cuisine. It turns out it's a hardcore
    delicacy over there to eat shark meat that's been buried in gravel and left
    to putrefy for a few months. No joke. (Hey, champ, it's okay if you wanna
    rethink that Bj√∂rk make-out fantasy).</p><p>
    In a roundabout way, this brings me to Unwound's <i>A Single History 1991-1997</i>.
    But first, allow me to let you in on a little <i>Pitchfork</i> secret: we like
    to keep things fresh around here, <i>just for you</i>. We've noticed that
    releases older than a few months tend to go stale, or sprout furry and noxious
    fungi, or start to smell aggressively rank.  Like shark carrion.</p><p>
    Naturally, it was with trepidation that I put <i>A Single History</i> in the
    CD player with intent to review it. See, I bought this album a full year ago;
    as in 1999; as in before both ""Y2K bug"" and that swell Prince song fell into
    sad, dusty obsolescence. Before this week, I'd listened to this disc a grand
    total of one time the whole way through. In 1999. I must not have been
    particularly impressed with that first listen, seeing as how I let it sit
    there until, basically, today. And I really, really love Unwound. Like
    ""please call me if you need an organ transplant"" love. The fact their last
    full-length came out in early '98 causes me actual grief.</p><p>
    But after a whole year's time, much as I dig the band, I can't say my take
    on this disc has changed at all. It has neither aged well a la Icelandic
    fish rot, nor has it really dropped in my esteem. Nope. This one's got shelf
    life. That isn't a compliment.</p><p>
    The tracks on <i>A Single History</i> were all previously released as singles
    or on compilations, and the general guideline applies: if you're fiendishly
    into Unwound, you'll want this sort of thing in your collection. But to the
    unfamiliar, I say steer clear. These songs span Unwound's career, from 1991
    to 1997. The earlier stuff that pre-dates Sara Lund's induction to the band
    is, with the exception of ""Caterpillar"" and ""Stumbling Block,"" belligerent,
    angst-ridden, and instantly forgettable. Pin that on original skins-man
    Brandt Sandeno, an energetic but mind-numbingly uninteresting drummer.</p><p>
    The later material is a frustratingly mixed bag. First, the bright side.
    The lead-off track, ""Mile Me Deaf,"" was recorded around the time of
    <i>Repetition</i>, and is one more example of what makes this band
    incredible; it managing to balance being painfully jagged yet dancy and
    sing-songy at the same time.  Other standout tracks include ""Mkultra,""
    (<i>New Plastic Ideas</i>-era),  ""Seen Not Heard"" (circa <i>Fake Train</i>),
    and ""Census,"" which features the same musical base later utilized on
    <i>Repetition</i>'s ""Sensible."" Only here, with the addition of Dustin the
    Roadie's trombone, it comes off like Dixieland music from hell and/or space.</p><p>
    The award for Best Title, Most Interesting, but also Most Irritating goes
    to the second-to-last track, ""The Light at the End of the Tunnel is a Train.""
    This is a sadistically long, super-atmospheric, effected-out, medley kind of
    song that aims high but never quite gets the shot off.  After an endless
    expanse of jungle drums, things quiet down for a bit until the addition of
    looped samples from <i>Repetition</i>'s ""No tech"" and <i>New Plastic Ideas</i>'
    ""All Souls Day."" Over all this, the jokesters play an answering machine
    message of a hippie-sounding guy rambling on about a music/mediation retreat
    in this horrible pseudo-ethnomusicology kind of way. You know. Just, for like,
    kicks. It reads funnier than it actually is, believe me.</p><p>
    I can't say I'd rather eat decomposed fish than listen to this, but neither
    could I much recommend it. If you pray at the pew of Unwound and can't wait
    the five months until their next release, go for it. For my part, I think I
    might just stash this one away and check in again a year from now. Maybe it'll
    have gained some flavor.</p></div>"|8364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8364-a-single-history-1991-1997/|6.5|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    Trinity Sessions</i>, well. It was the fall of my second year in college,
    and something about the sound of the album stuck with me. It was digitally
    recorded, I read later, with one microphone, in some church in Toronto.
    The gentle, reverberating sound of Margo Timmins' voice, and the way she
    purred those country tunes and that VU cover, soothed me on many a
    lonely, drunken night. The following year, I started reaching for Galaxie
    500's <i>On Fire</i> for those nocturnal journeys into oblivion, but I'd
    still put on <i>The Trinity Sessions</i> now and again to marvel at the
    record's pervasive and utterly convincing mood-- that relentlessly lonesome
    sound that bridged 50's Grand Ole Opry with Lou Reed's New York.  It was,
    we see now, an inspired record, and the way it fused genres was actually
    somewhat ahead of its time.</p><p>
    
    I lost track of Cowboy Junkies after that. I'd hear a song of theirs
    occasionally, but none of them captured the atmosphere of that first
    record. In a few cases, as on the outstanding ""If You Were the Woman and
    I Was the Man,"" it seemed possible that the songwriting had improved
    while I was away. The odds-and-ends collection <i>Rarities, B-Sides and
    Slow, Sad Waltzes</i> confirms it: though this record contains the usual
    assortment of covers (it's a Cowboy Junkies trademark, and they know how
    to make them their own), it's Michael Timmins' originals that stand out.
    Margo's bro is a first-rate songwriter with an impressive mastery of
    traditional North American forms and a gift for melody.</p><p>
    
    Though they've diversified over the years, slower songs are still what
    this band does best. The upbeat, almost-Stonesy ""I Saw Your Shoes"" isn't
    terrible, but Margo Timmins just doesn't have the vocal power to put
    rockers across. Fortunately, these attempts at shedding the ""wimp band""
    tag are few, and we get plenty of opportunities to wallow in beautiful,
    spacious ballads like ""Five Room Love Story"" and ""Love's Still There""
    (which, true to the album's title, is a waltz.)</p><p>
    
    Of the covers, it's the unlisted, a capella version of Bruce Springsteen's
    ""My Father's House"" (another one from Springsteen's <i>Nebraska</i>) that
    takes the prize. Margo Timmins' voice has always sounded great unaccompanied,
    but here we get to hear her goofing with the band during the recording
    process. This is odd coming from the Cowboy Junkies, a band always perceived 
    as humorless, but <i>Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes</i> shows that 
    they may have a few surprises left.</p></div>"|1639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1639-rarities-b-sides-and-slow-sad-waltzes/|7.0|Mark Richard-San

    venerated bands, rip it off wholesale, and still end up creating something 
    fresh, interesting, and exciting. With a few exceptions, their entire career
    has been based on taking the music of their heroes, boiling it down in a tasty
    pop stew, and calling it their own. Witness 1997's <i>One Chord to Another</i>--
    the album was filled to the brim with Beatles songs written not by Lennon/
    McCartney, but by Murphy/ Pentland/ Ferguson/ Scott.</p><p>
    
    Sure, these songs might sound like a lot of shit you've heard before but
    as you listen, Sloan's affectations and flourishes materialize and you hear
    the band for what they really are-- not a cloying, uninspired rip-off, but
    an intellegent band with a sense of humor and a great ear for pop hooks.
    Whether it's in the Fab Four disguise of <i>One Chord</i>, the British shoegazer 
    aping of their DGC debut, <i>Smeared</i>, or seen through the swaggering filter
    of their recent obsession with the '70s, these songs eventually reveal themselves
    as the distinct product of Sloan regardless of what disguise thay might take.</p><p>
    
    It's hasn't really been that long since their last record, 1998's <i>Navy Blues</i>.
    The record took <i>One Chord</i>'s Beatles obsession, added a few shots of Cheap
    Trick and a pinch of the Raspberries, and came out with one of their most affecting
    concoctions to date.  So it only makes sense that I would be somewhat wary of
    <i>Between the Bridges</i>.  The first time through, it almost seemed like they'd
    taken a turn down Disappointment Lane.  See, instead of raiding 1970s freedom rock
    for ideas, Sloan seem to have grabbed a fistful of Fleetwood Mac, Todd Rundgren and,
    of course, the Who.</p><p>
    
    The funny thing is, that despite all odds, this ends up working just as well.  Now,
    I'm no fan of cheesy '70s pop, but when Sloan updates the sound, something clicks.
    My theory: at the core, the members of Sloan are Grade A songwriters. Despite the
    semi- ridiculous exterior, there's virtually no fluff on this album. The lyrics are
    (relatively) intelligent, and the songs are put together immaculately.</p><p>
    
    After years of acceptance in their Canadian homeplace, Sloan are finally starting
    to get a good reputation in the United States among indie rock fans.  But they've
    still got a long way to go-- at a recent Seattle appearance, the publicity for the
    show was so non-existent that no one heard about it until the day before it happened,
    causing infinite sadness among at least two Seattlites who didn't find out about it
    until too late (chiefly myself and my roommate). So wake up, you guys! If you like
    pop music, and you aren't already a Sloan fan, go buy this album and become one.</p></div>"|7248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7248-between-the-bridges/|7.9|Jeremy Schneyer

    pop of Gary Numan with the lo-tech layered keyboards of Kraftwerk, creating songs
    that are at once creative and shamelessly catchy.  His songs are like every nice
    pop song you've ever heard-- memorable, nice to listen to, and, invariably, about
    love.  His sound, on the other hand, is totally unique.  The unrestrained use of
    cheap drum machines and old Yamaha keyboards and sequencers is stunning.  So is
    the fact that his songs lack any organic instrumentation-- there's not a single
    stringed instrument to be found on his records.</p><p>
<i>The House of Tomorrow</i> is a five- track EP released back in 1992 that's
    just been picked up and reissued by Superchunk's glorious Merge Records out of
    North Carolina.  Thanks to their scooping up this EP, along with the Magnetic
    Fields' classic <i>Holiday</i>, Merge now owns the band's entire catalog.  So
    be it, then.  If I had my pick of labels to own my entire back catalog, Merge
    would be near the top of the list.</p><p>
<i>The House of Tomorrow</i> is standard fare from Merritt; five songs, countless
    keyboards, a touch of reverb, and tracks as outstanding as the ones on Layne
    Staley's arms.  The problem with Merritt's work, though, is that there's a pretty
    substantial amount of sameness to it.  What I mean is, if you listen to a lot of
    Magnetic Fields records, pretty soon they all start to sound alike.  Of course,
    it's always a pleasing listen.  After all, who could get sick of love songs?</p></div>"|5039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5039-the-house-of-tomorrow-ep/|7.4|Ryan Schreiber

My best friend turned thirty this week, 
    so I helped him organize a little get- together in a vacant warehouse, 
    which we appropriated for the evening through one of his buddies. We 
    rented some killer audio gear: two turntables, an 850 watt- per- channel amp, 
    and a pair of speakers the size of Midwestern suburban refrigerators. My 
    friend brought the keg and the lawn chairs and I brought my mixer and 
    some records. Another friend showed some stop- motion super 8 films that 
    he'd been working on. I played the cream of my beat- oriented crop and, I 
    have to say, I've never heard music sound so good.</p><p>
    
    And then, in the wee hours, when almost everyone had gone home, we pulled 
    out the noise music and unleashed the most wicked and intense sonic 
    assault I've ever had the pleasure of being scared shitless by. As the 
    terrified pigeons that called the warehouse home whirled in the rafters 
    above, the last of us were quaking in horror at the insanely 
    confrontational sounds. It was heaven.</p><p>
    
    So that was Friday. Saturday, I had to get on with my Pitchfork review 
    duties so I sat at home and spun Dressy Bessy's new album <i>Pink Hearts,
    Yellow Moons</i>. Not surprisingly, it's been pretty hard to get into. This 
    cutsie indie pop, with its girl- group style vocals, sing- songy melodies, 
    jangly guitars and sunny outlook just seems so... I don't know... 
    <i>inconsequential</i>.</p><p> 
    
    At least the melodies are good, which is always the litmus test for indie 
    pop, even if some of them are clearly derivative (especially 
    ""Lookaround,"" which is so similar to ""Father and Son"" that Cat Stevens, 
    er... I mean Yusef Islam... should certainly get a songwriting credit.) 
    There's plenty here as far as spunky energy (like the catchy, Go-Go's- style 
    ""Extra- Ordinary"") but there's not a hell of a lot going on in terms of 
    inspiration.  And so I spent most of my evaluation time thinking about the 
    next album I was going to listen to. I can safely attribute indifference 
    here to one part bad timing (it's not really right, trying to dissect 
    cuddly Kindercore pop when I want something that screams at my soul) and 
    one part plain old mediocrity.</p></div>"|2454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2454-pink-hearts-yellow-moons/|4.8|Mark Richard-San

    understand the term.  The four lads that make up the band's core (which
    includes-- but is not limited to-- frontman James Bertram of 764-HERO,
    and Modest Mouse drummer Jeremiah Green) are more of an impersonal,
    all powerful force of nature than just another band.  They're a nasty
    gang of James Bond- style evil geniuses that make their hideout in
    Washington (the state) and happen to spend their days making music instead
    of trying to take over the world.  Together they could break into Fort Knox,
    assassinate the world leader of their choice, and generally bathe the world
    in the blood of their enemies.  But that's not really their thing. Instead,
    they prefer to sit around, dress badly, forget to wash their hair and make
    brilliant music when they get the time.</p><p>
    
    Be warned though, you're still not safe from their destructive madness. They
    may not be firing guided nuclear missiles at earthquake- happy fault lines
    or dumping anthrax into the city reservoir, but their albums will destroy
    you just as quickly. You see, these are not easy, passable, pleasant ditties
    designed to be passed off to the slackjawed masses. The smooth criminals of
    Red Stars Theory are artists making beautiful, insidious, moody music that
    kicks you in the nuts while kissing you full on the lips. At one moment,
    their songs are as fierce and as sharp as a dropkick to the throat; the next
    minute they can whisper and float as subtly as cyanide being poured into your
    Starbucks coffee cup-- music so good it's dangerous.</p><p>
<i>Life in a Bubble Can Be Beautiful</i> is the second full- length album
    from these guys, and despite having to live in the shadow of its older brother,
    1997's <i>But Sleep Came Slowly</i>, it does not disappoint. From <i>Sleep</i>
    to <i>Bubble</i>, the Red Stars have managed to do something that is all but 
    impossible in today's music scene: they've grown.  In two short years, they've
    realized how to take a good thing and make it great.</p><p>
    
    Packed with soft vocals, heavy drums, cellos, violins and fuzzy electric guitars,
    <i>Bubble</i> showcases some of the most mature and interesting songwriting modern
    indie rock may have to offer.  In recording this album, Red Stars Theory have taken
    their singular form of intelligent emo-core to a whole new level. By playing up to
    their strengths-- namely the raw, emotionally naked power of their music and the
    endless sonic possibilities presented by their idiosyncratic instrumentation--
    they've managed to pen eight of the best songs of their career (so far).</p><p>
    
    The opening track, ""How Did This Room Get So White,"" is an atmospheric musical
    marathon, an instrumental clocking in somewhere around seven minutes. Don't be
    scared, though.  I know that when an album opens with an instrumental, especially
    one this long, it's usually pretty bad news. These albums mostly end up being 
    talent-free jack-off sessions created by horribly pretentious musicians. This time,
    of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  While this particular song
    may count as a shameless musical jack-off session, it's packed with talent, and 
    doesn't come off as aimless noodling.  This track goes a long way towards laying
    the foundation for the rest of the album, both stylistically and on a more
    subliminal, ethereal level.</p><p>
    
    ""How Did This Room Get So White"" leads into seven more epics that, despite being
    longer than most books I've read, are completely mesmerizing, emotional but never
    sappy, and intelligent but never cold. The songs that feature lyrics, like
    ""Combinations and Complications"" or ""An Alarm Goes Off,"" are all the more
    captivating, as the soft, library- whisper vocals and clever lyrics throw another
    level of sonic love into the mix.</p><p>
    
    To make a sweet thing even sweeter, the Red Stars have also managed to overcome
    the one major problem that plagued their previous album-- it suffered from a
    staggering lack of musical variety that kept it from reaching true classic album
    status. Through song after song, the boys made great music, but they never strayed
    far from one sound.  On <i>Bubble</i>, though, the gloves are off.  Here, the band
    seems comfortable with taking some risks and channeling more influences and styles
    into their songs.  The result is a fuller, richer album.  Blues chords, strings
    solos, studio- crafted sound effects and beats that border on jungle music are all
    brought in to broaden the musical spectrum without diluting any of its power.</p></div>"|6725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6725-life-in-a-bubble-can-be-beautiful/|8.4|Steven Byrd

    however stylistically different or experimental, will inevitably be compared
    to it. So, let's just get this out of the way: Quasi's latest, <i>Field
    Studies</i>, is not as good as last year's critics' darling, <i>Featuring
    ""Birds.""</i>  That album clothed frontman Sam Coomes' utterly bleak worldview
    in bouncy, cheery pop that made the poison go down effortlessly. And while
    <i>Field Studies</i> certainly boasts its share of infectious pop tunes, the
    tempos are slower, the songs are longer, and one's patience with Coomes'
    cynicism gradually grows thin over the course of the album.</p><p>
    
    While most of the songs on <i>Featuring ""Birds""</i> hesitated to venture
    past the three-minute mark (which was good), there are several on <i>Field
    Studies</i> that approach or cross the five-minute mark (which is bad, for
    them), including the album's centerpiece, ""A Fable with No Moral,"" which is
    over seven minutes long! Did these songs need to be this lengthy? Would
    their edge have been dulled if the excess chaff was trimmed off? Of course
    not! ""Fable"" is by far the worst offender of all the songs here-- not only
    is it overly long, but its execution is extremely heavy-handed and overly
    obvious. The track kicks off with the line, ""I went and sold my soul so I
    could pay my rent."" Coomes then goes on to detail his various attempts to
    sell his soul.  If the song had been presented in a less clumsy manner,
    it's might come across as clever and possibly charming.  But that's not
    the way it worked out.</p><p>
    
    There are, however, plenty of songs here that live up to Coomes' and
    co-conspirator (read: ex-wife) Janet Weiss' previous benchmarks: ""Under a
    Cloud,"" ""Skeleton,"" ""Smile,"" and the opener, ""All the Same,"" ring with
    patented fuzzed-out Roxichord drones, and boast melodies and clever
    couplets that have the potential to get stuck in the ol' noggin for weeks.
    Also worth a mention is Weiss' sole contribution to the proceedings, ""Two
    by Two,"" a beautifully chilling anti-love song.  This is one of those
    tracks that initially sounds all wrong, but soon ingratiates the listener
    to its peculiar charms. These songs are all definitely the equal of the
    best songs on <i>Featuring ""Birds""</i>, even if they fail to bring anything
    new to the table.</p><p>
<i>Field Studies</i> sees Coomes trying to develop his pop sensibility,
    but if you ask me, he's headed in the wrong direction. Instead of focusing
    on his songwriting skills and keeping the musical accompaniment stripped
    down, he seems to be trying to add bizarre quirks to cover up the fact
    that he only knows how to write one type of song.  There are probably ten
    times more bells and whistles on <i>Field Studies</i> than on any previous
    Quasi release.  Now, that's not to say that it's overproduced-- it's all
    tastefully done, and the sound quality is actually really nice.  But this
    seems to have been accomplished at the expense of the integrity of the
    songs.</p><p>
    
    I wouldn't necessarily classify <i>Field Studies</i> as a failed experiment
    because it's really too good of a record for that.  But I would say that
    next time around, it wouldn't hurt Coomes to keep his tendencies towards
    bombast in check.</p></div>"|6617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6617-field-studies/|6.3|Jeremy Schneyer

    the influence of country on its more popular cousin, rock, will have to be
    reckoned with.  Sure, country- rock rambled about long before the '90s
    first messed its pants, and certainly the Eagles enjoyed more fame and
    amassed a greater fortune than any of their '90s counterparts.</p><p>
    However, the vigor and sincerity with which this decade's cowpoke rockers
    mined rock's agrarian roots have paved a larger and more permanent inroad
    on our cultural landscape than any of country rock's forebears managed.
    But while innovators like Uncle Tupelo and the Jayhawks left their mark,
    the small movement they spawned would always remain a half length from
    monumental greatness, hamstrung by its incessant and narrow gaze toward
    the past.  These days, there are still plenty of alt-country albums at your
    local record store, but the great ones are few and far between.  Most
    content themselves with a comfortable pleasantness, for reasons presented
    as if for study on Freakwater's latest release, <i>End Time</i>.</p><p>
    Before Bob Dylan hit the scene in the early '60s, authenticity mattered
    little to popular music and its consumers.  It wasn't because music fans
    were satisfied by counterfeits, but rather because, amongst a dense forest
    of three- minute songs about drag racing, it was of little consequence
    whether a singer actually felt what they sang.  Keepin' it real, despite
    it's location centered in the heart of the country movement, is still a
    relative newcomer to the music world.</p><p>
    To both its credit and its detriment, the alt-country genre finds value in
    retaining the intangible ""feeling"" of the tradition it so zealously pursues.
    Here, Freakwater is a perfect example.  Nearly flawlessly capturing both the
    sound and mood of traditional folk country, with its usually pessimistic
    characters, dobros and mandolins, the band successfully brings to life a
    collection of songs on <i>End Time</i> that could just as easily have been
    written two or three decades ago.  And though Freakwater chooses a higher
    ground than country's usual trailer park clich√©, and aspires musically to a
    tradition higher than the consistent drivel turned out in Nashville, the
    music here is country in the raw, Appalachian sense.</p><p>
    While the band often finds success on this extremely listenable album (the
    opening track ""Good for Nothing"" is the shiniest gem of the bunch),
    Freakwater, in tune with the alt-country masses, offers nothing new here.
    In perfecting the authenticity of the album, they've succeeded in taking
    the music backward, but have failed to move it forward.  The future may
    find Freakwater in more applicable form, but on <i>End Time</i>, they
    have little more to offer than a pleasant ride through America's backwoods.</p></div>"|3183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3183-end-time/|5.5|Neil Lieberman

    brilliant masterpiece or merely very, very good?  The title alone is enough to send music
    geeks the world over into a foamy-mouthed, epileptic frenzy. 69 songs equals 3 CDs equals
    nearly three solid hours of new Magnetic Fields material-- think of it! That's more than
    some notable bands released in their entire existence.  Add that to the fact that the
    Magnetic Fields actually followed through with their concept without turning it into
    the indie-pop equivalent of Lou Reed's <i>Metal Machine Music</i>.</p><p>
    
    You see, I have this theory that music critics are suckers for novelty, and there isn't
    much in this world that's more novel than <i>69 Love Songs.  It borders on being a
    prop in a Mark Leyner story-- it's hyperreal and excessive, yet perfectly plausible when
    you consider how weird reality is.  Because of this, the album never feels like a ponderous,
    pretentious artistic statement (unlike most multi-CD releases).  Stephin Merritt and company
    sound like they approached this ridiculously ambitious project with the most casual of airs,
    idly plucking melody after divine melody out of the air like low-hanging fruit from a tree.
    It's how pop music should sound, really: so natural and feather-light that you never notice
    the amount of effort that went into it.</i></p><p>
    
    Therein lies the paradox of <i>69 Love Songs</i>-- it's such a basic style of music that
    it's easy to dismiss it as ""just pop music.""  Of course, that's what it is, so should it
    really deserve such high praise?  Should it rank among the best albums of the 1990s?  Or
    is it too bizarre to be considered culturally important?  I mean, <i>Abbey Road</i> is
    a pretty weird album, too.  Then again, <i>Abbey Road</i> isn't three hours long.</p><p>
    
    Regardless, Stephin Merritt has proven himself as an exceptional songwriter, making
    quantum leaps in quality as well as quantity on <i>69 Love Songs</i>. This incarnation
    of the band doesn't feature much of the densely layered, burbling electro-pop that
    they're best known for; in its stead are sparser, more acoustic songs that sound as if
    they're being played on actual instruments by a group of actual musicians (as opposed
    to Merritt himself playing mad scientist with effects racks and overdubs).  It may
    initially seem like this stylistic decision came due to budget restrictions-- if
    you're recording that many songs, you can't blow too much money on any one track.
    But it's probably more likely that Merritt finally realized the limits of tinny synths
    and drum machines.</p><p>
    
    On the Fields' previous outing, <i>Get Lost</i>, you can hear Merritt beginning to
    lean toward simpler, more elegant arrangements; <i>69 Love Songs</i> could easily be
    seen as a continuation of that trend. Merritt also ensures that the listener will
    never get bored with any one sound, trading off vocal duties with four other singers
    and deploying a mind-boggling array of instruments: ukulele, banjo, accordion, cello,
    mandolin, piano, flute, guitars of all shapes and sizes, a dumpster full of percussion
    toys, and the usual setup of synths and effects. Among other things.</p><p>
    
    And the songs themselves? Well, I could write a thesis dissecting each and every song
    on this album, but that would take months. As a prism refracts light into a spectrum
    of colors, <i>69 Love Songs</i> not only refracts love into a spectrum of emotions,
    but also refracts the love song itself into a spectrum of musical forms.  There's a
    duet between a dysfunctional Sonny and Cher (""Yeah! Oh Yeah!""), a country-gospel tune
    confusing religious and secular love (""Kiss Me Like You Mean It""), and an amusingly
    light-hearted tale of a soldier's drunken tryst (""The Night You Can't Remember"").</p><p>
    
    There's giddy lust (""Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits""), romantic longing (""Come Back
    from San Francisco""), sleazy leering (""Underwear""), and resignation and despair (""No
    One Will Ever Love You"").  There are genre exercises such as faux-beatnik jazz (""Love
    is Like Jazz""), Paul Simon-ish world music (""World Love""), Gilbert and Sullivan-style
    mincing harpsichord (""For We are the King of the Boudoir""), Merritt's cartoony, day-glo
    interpretation of punk rock (""Punk Love""), Scottish folk (""Wi' Nae Wee Bairn Ye'll Me
    Beget""), and a brief Philip Glass tribute (""Experimental Music Love"").  There are also
    plenty of archetypal Magnetic Fields songs, with those trademark deadpan drama-queen
    vocals, casually depressive lyrics, and clever rhymes.  But Merritt also shows he can
    pen some surprisingly sincere, moving ballads (""Busby Berkeley Dreams,"" ""The Book of
    Love""), too.</p><p>
    
    So, back to the original debate. You know that old saying about the whole being more
    than the sum of its parts? The sum of the parts of <i>69 Love Songs</i> adds up
    <i>exactly</i> to its whole. No more, no less. Each song contains its own small
    epiphany, but they never quite add up to the one big sweeping epiphany that you'd hope
    for. That's because it's impossible to reconcile the concept of <i>69 Love Songs</i>
    with its execution; it's simply too big.  That might sound like a cop-out, but this
    is truly an album you can get lost in.  The individual songs will inevitably distract
    you from a big-picture interpretation of the album. Of course, the Magnetic Fields
    don't concern themselves with such matters; they promised us 69 love songs, and that's
    what they delivered.  That it's actually worth the exorbitant $35 price tag is a bonus.</p></div>"|5041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5041-69-love-songs/|9.0|Nick Mirov

    43-A Pettybone Way<br/>
    Essex, England</p><p>
    
    Dearest Miles:</p><p>
    
    How are you, my dear?  I hope you are enjoying the silk scarves I brought from
    Thailand.  In fact, I fully expect that you are wearing them right now, even as
    we speak, sashaying around, cigarette dangling from your chicken lips, hair
    slicked back, chest shaven... my, but you are a dandy plum!</p><p>
    
    I must congratulate you (imagine me holding those soft hands, right now) on the
    absolutely tasteful parties you hold.  Your Albert Camus Decapitation Day ball
    was a definite must-do, a glad- I've- done- it sort of affair.  Beautiful,
    splendid time, you know.  I had no idea that you knew (or had the wherewithal)
    to invite so many tasty boys and girls.  It was a quite a sight, waltzing into
    your foyer-- utterly late, I apologize-- and beholding the pouty faces and shiny
    hair laid out on your velvet couches and drinking from your martini glasses.</p><p>
    
    I can't help but think that the music helped set the tone.  You have absolutely
    fabulous taste in dignified party music.  I had asked you what it was and you
    said it was something called ""The Wisdom of Harry"" (with a devilish smirk on your
    face-- shame, shame!).  It was perfect-- it receded into the background, but had
    enough of an effect to bring on some fabulous poses.</p><p>
    
    Where do you get such strange music, Miles?  You know me, I am an old queen who
    sticks to his disco records... but I do like this new trip-hop stuff.  Although
    this band was a bit lower rent than that big-budget stuff you used to try to push
    on me.  Subtle, clever beats, imminently tasteful snippets of organs, neato little
    sound loops, touches of vinyl static... very minimal, but oddly decadent, my dear.
    All very understated and proper.  Never so obtrusive as to offend the sultry hordes...
    unlike that Tori Amos thing you used to play for us.</p><p>
    
    I didn't like it when there was singing, though.  Sounded a bit too pimply for me,
    if you know what I mean.  All monotones and drabness and mlah, mlah, mlah for me.
    A bit like those Pet Shop Boys without the range, you know... You are laughing at me
    now, Miles, I can tell!  What an old bugger he is, he laughs... You must give me
    credit for caring.  You don't see many men as handsome as me (or as old!) who dare
    to inquire about what the kiddies are listening to these days.  I'm sure I'm the only
    one at the party who noticed... Am I right!</p><p>
    
    Well, I suppose that does it for me.  Thanks again for the wonderful party and I hope
    to be seeing your wonderful behind very soon.</p><p>
    
    Love,<br/>
    Martin Yorkshire<br/>

Paul Daley and Neil Barnes
    aren't the sort of losers who hang out in church halls waiting for the other members of
    their self-esteem classmates to arrive.  Leftfield don't sup on weak tea and self-pity.
    Just because they don't sport bifocals patched together with duct tape, it doesn't mean
    we can't point our fingers at them and mutter, ""You could have been the best we ever thought
    there could be.""</p><p>
    
    See, under a more favorable constellation, Leftfield would illuminated the firmament. For
    a pair who knocked around with A Man Called Adam and the Brand New Heavies, they showed
    initiative.  They turned their backs on their mediocre beginnings, established their own
    Hard Hands label, and released underground dub house disco tunes (""Release the Pressure""
    and ""Open Up"") that still cause floors to burn.  That John Lydon ""graced"" Leftfield's
    incendiary ""Open Up"" with his sneering, snarling pitbull lines is proof of how important
    Barnes and Daley were perceived to be.</p><p>
    
    When Leftfield's debut album, <i>Leftism</i>, finally dropped, few could honestly say it was
    worth the wait. After dubbing David Bowie worthy of consideration (they remixed Bowie's ""Jump
    They Say"") and having given William Orbit's Guerilla Records a perennial bomb with their
    Dubfield mix of React 2 Rhythm's ""Intoxication,"" <i>Leftism</i> seemed scrawny in comparison.
    Had ""Open Up"" and ""Release the Pressure"" not been included in its track listing, it seems
    unlikely that anyone would be talking about Leftfield nowadays.</p><p>
    
    However, fate (or at least Sony's marketing department) had implemented a long-term strategy to
    establish Leftfield as the faces of techno.  Barnes and Daley would be the Lennon and McCartney
    of the new rock and roll.  But the plan failed for two reasons: (1) Underworld, and; (2) Barnes
    and Daley didn't pull out an album every year.  It took them four years to follow up on their
    debut, and in that time, Underworld and others had run off with all the major prizes.</p><p>
<i>Rhythm and Stealth</i> is the quintessential ""difficult sophomore"" album. Leftfield
    definitely want us to recall <i>Leftism</i>, but they also point a defining finger into the
    future.  Unfortunately for them (and us), artists such as Arovane, Freeform, Richard Harvey,
    Richie Hawtin, and Boards of Canada, to prattle off just a few, have eclipsed the duo.  But
    the Leftfield moniker still has some currency and draw; Afrika Bambaataa gets grizzly on the
    electro-bass of ""Afrika Shox"" (used, predictably, in a UK television ad); Roots Manuva, the
    man who <i>will</i> save British rap, rasps and rhymes deadly on ""Dusted.""  But these two
    memorable tracks are weighed down by ambient drool like ""El Cid"" and the watery gruel Leftfield
    ladle out under the title of ""Chant of a Poor Man.""  And why bother with the spitball album
    version of ""Phat Planet"" when you can have the armor-piercing remix by Dave Clarke?</p><p>
<i>Rhythm and Stealth</i> is a case of too little too late.  We're clamoring for an album that
    these guys can't deliver.  In our overblown hopes for the salvation of rock, we chose the wrong
    candidates to deliver the debauchery, the rioting, and the risk that made listening to rock
    radio such a dirty illicit thrill. The starkly saddening thought is that there may not be
    anyone out there capable of making us wet ourselves with excitement. We may all be victims of
    overwhelming disappointment.</p></div>"|4718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4718-rhythm-and-stealth/|6.3|Paul Cooper

    in the sack.  And to make things worse, she squanders her talents by writing in <i>Parade</i>
    Magazine. (Look for her supreme intellect tucked behind the ""Howard Huge"" cartoons.) Obviously,
    intellect has little correlation to relevance.  Which is why Momus, despite all his intents and
    concepts, just isn't very listenable.  As an artist and satirist, Momus constantly drifts
    through phases, masks, and costumes.  But as a musician, his music remains mired in the realm
    of Casio-composed chintz pop.</p><p>
    
    The story behind <i>Stars Forever</i> is that Momus found himself in a costly legal situation
    thanks to a song off his last record.  Said song retold the tale of transsexual synth-composer
    Wendy (formerly Walter) Carlos.  Momus found himself in a small financial hole.  Light bulbs
    went off above his eyepatch-wearing head: if you had about $1000 sitting around, Momus would
    pen a witty ditty just for you, your company, or your hipster collective.  It sounds like a
    great idea.  Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like a great album.</p><p>
    
    A cloud of irrelevance and judicial waste hovers over the entire two-disc project-- two quirky
    pop artists bickering on the fringe of cultural significance.  After all, isn't it a bit sad
    that a perverted keyboard bard who writes toe-tappers about ""cumming in a girl's mouth"" is
    being sued by a trans-gendered, avant-new-age synthesizer freak who sauces vocoded bits like
    ""We are in hell"" over Moog belches?  God bless America/ Britain/ Japan.</p><p>
    
    Another unfortunate element in the entire affair is just who shoveled up the paper to have
    their story in song.  Some hipper- than- thou (and apparently, more- able- to- waste- a-
    grand- than- thou) indie rock figures have chipped in for skeptical reasons. Girlie Action,
    the New York public relations firm that hypes Momus' albums (among others), makes for perfect
    Momus fodder on their name alone.  But they're a P.R. company!  What do you think their motive
    is?</p><p>
    
    Likewise, Chicago's Reckless Records represents.  Reckless, a store where you likely can't
    find this record due to their disorganization, disregard to customer service, and general
    disinterest, tries to glaze up their indie cred with a song on an art-pop record.  Really, how
    interesting will a song about a record store actually be?  Other cult figures, such as Cornelius
    and cartoonist Jeff Koons pop up, too.  But their stories just aren't as interesting as the
    fictional characters Momus has conjured in the past.  Plus, just the general air of ""underground
    artist"" back-patting feels distancing.  The problem here is that Momus is too rarely willing to
    turn on his contributors and take his typical satirical bite.  Instead we get fluffy odes.</p><p>
    
    Momus' greatest flaw, though, will continue to be his disrespect for pop music.  His bare,
    robotic compositions offer few musical treats.  Which is, apparantly, his point.  But Momus
    mocks the very vehicle used to deliver his message.  Thus, Momus is like the obese, filthy,
    sick doctor; the car mechanic in the run-down AMC Rambler; Frank Gehry with Lincoln Logs; or
    the sculptor with Play-Doh.  Oh, and it's 39 songs of this.</p></div>"|5383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5383-stars-forever/|3.8|Brent DiCrescenzo

    that at once has one foot firmly rooted in tradition, and simultaneously
    quietly pushes ""guitar-based"" rock a little further into the future.  I'm
    thinking of bands like Television and Pavement, though there are obviously
    thousands of bands one could make a case for.  The thing they have in common
    is that they're workhorses.  Their innovation comes not so much through
    recognized and accepted artistic statements, but through sheer effort, purpose,
    and determination.  It's the kind of brilliance that shines through in dirty,
    sweaty gigs half-filled with people who don't give a shit.  Modest Mouse have
    entered this lineage.</p><p>
    
    Originally issued as an obscure Japanese EP, Up Records released this 12""
    featuring outtakes from the <i>Moon and Antarctica</i> sessions a few months
    back.  There are four tracks here, three of which are previously unreleased.
    <i>The Moon</i>'s ""I Came as a Rat"" (curiously subtitled ""Long Walk Off a Short
    Dock"") appears in the same form which graces the album.  Still a great song,
    but let's concentrate on the new stuff.</p><p>
    
    ""Willful Suspension of Disbelief""
    opens Side One, a product of the Mouses' newfound dreamy side.  It would be
    rash to compare Isaac Brock to My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields, but there's
    a similar aesthetic at work in the way the layers of guitars come together.
    Massed vocals sigh, ""Everywhere everywhere everywhere,"" over Brock's stunningly
    effective poetry: ""You could keep diggin' down and down/ A thousand graves down
    without turnin' around without finding hell/ You find you're digging up again.""</p><p>
    
    The song segues smoothly into the title track, which encapsulates the thrust
    of Modest Mouse's new work.  They share the ability with the Velvet Underground
    to captivate with just two chords for 7+ minutes, as Isaac Brock's precisely
    delayed guitarwork bring to mind both Lou Reed and Tom Verlaine.  His style
    has little to do with technical chops, though; the appeal rests on his ability
    to effortlessly probe and search around the skeletal melody.</p><p>
    
    Filler as it is, ""I Came as a Rat"" seems a rather needless inclusion.  However,
    it fits in well with the final track, ""You're the Good Things,"" a song which
    initially recalls ""old"" Modest Mouse, with dry production and a sing-songy
    melody.  Yet, the track takes so many twists and turns before its conclusion
    that it leaves no doubt that there's no looking back for this band.</p><p>
    
    The three years between <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i> and <i>The Moon and
    Antarctica</i> obviously gave Modest Mouse an opportunity to prepare their
    ultimate statement of purpose.  They've already produced an album that will
    serve as a line of demarcation between ""before"" and ""after"" for everything
    they do.  One hopes that this EP will mark a return to the prolificacy of
    their first couple years; the only thing that could stop them now is a break
    from recording.</p></div>"|5357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5357-night-on-the-sun-ep/|8.7|D. Erik Kempke

    what's the deal with trip-hop?  It seemed to disappear for a while
    after Portishead's last release.  I thought it was long gone.  I
    really did.  Then Siouxie Sioux made a very mild, unwelcome and
    largely unnoticed comeback with the Creatures release <i>Anima
    Animus</i>.  And I think Pitchfork has covered more awful trip-hop
    since then than we have in our entire three and a half years online.
    So, it's nice to finally hear a record in the genre that's actually
    worth listening to.</p><p>
<i>Blush</i>, the American debut from the English outfit Bows, is
    an incredibly orchestral affair, focused on laying down inventive,
    mellow beats, lush, orchestral atmospherics and gorgeous vocals.
    As with all good trip-hop, Bows' sound is unusally warm, utilizing
    rich, organic production techniques, bass- heavy kickdrums, melodic,
    ambient drones, and dense, full string sections.</p><p>
    
    A chap by the name of Luke Sutherland is the summoner of the Bows
    beast.  On <i>Blush</i>, he handles the majority of madness-- guitars
    (the few you hear), violins, the occasional saxophone, and lead
    vocals on a couple of tracks-- but also enlists a few friends to
    contribute their pieces.  Sutherland's most frequent collaborator,
    angelic vocalist Ruth Emond, makes three appearances on lead vocals,
    and three others on background vocals.  And though she's not officially
    a part of the group, she's one reason this record succeeds on so many
    levels.</p><p>
    
    Emond's soft, Laetitia Sadier-ish soprano complements the wall of
    beauty backing her up so perfectly that it's almost surreal.  On
    ""King Deluxe,"" she croons, ""Don't believe the hype/ That you're
    everything I hoped for,"" over one of the most spacious orchestras
    this side of Bjork's ""Isobel.""  Her appearance on ""Speed Marina,""
    which employs a simple harp sample that provides a mundane, vaguely
    Eastern mysticism, is chillingly intimate.  The track, which alternates
    between a sparse, moody calmness and a chopped up and slowed down hip-hop
    drum loop, is a dark breakup song with succinct but effective lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Sutherland's vocals, on the other hand, are slightly more hit- or-
    miss.  On the album's title track, an otherwise melodic and ambient
    masterpiece, Sutherland's lyrics are simply too damn cheesy to enjoy.
    But on the almost 8- minute- long ""Girls Lips Glitter,"" his British-
    accented whisper is a perfect match for Emond's ghostly background
    harmonies.  (It should also be noted that ""Girls Lips Glitter"" is the
    first successful fusion of ambient trip-hop and full-on drum-n-bass
    in history.)</p><p>
    
    The only problem with <i>Blush</i> is that, if you've just got it on
    as background music, it can be a bit dull.  That's largely because its
    mood rarely changes-- it's better suited for hot summer nights spent
    without electricity in Chicago (something everyone in the city should
    be used to at this point-- those filthy Com Ed bastards!) or on a late
    night car trip through midwestern forests.</p><p>
    
    In short, <i>Blush</i> combines the trip-hop elements of Portishead's
    <i>Dummy</i>, the dream- like ambience of Brian Eno's <i>Music for
    Films</i>, and the giant tsunami of sound produced by My Bloody
    Valentine's Kevin Shields on their 1990 classic, <i>Loveless</i>.
    If that's not an avid endorsement, I don't know what is.</p></div>"|891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/891-blush/|8.0|Ryan Schreiber

    probably stock it exclusively with bright colored, high- energy sugar goods.  We're
    talking Nerds, Skittles, Pixy Stix, Chewy Sweetarts, and the like.  Only minors
    would be allowed into the shop; college kids would have to be accompanied
    by their baby brothers and sisters.  In fact, a trip to the Bis sweets shop
    wouldn't be much different than listening to one of their albums: an
    exuberant, childish, stomach ache of a sugar high-- but in a good way.</p><p>
    
    This Scottish trio burst onto the American scene in 1997 with the infectious
    <i>This Is Teen-C Power</i> EP, six songs of disco- inflected, punky pop
    proclaiming the advent of the Teen-C Revolution.  The sing- along choruses
    (""Kill your boyfriend/ Yeah yeah yeah!""), killer riffs and back- to- elementary
    school bounce gave the band instant street cred.  And signing with the Beastie
    Boys on their coveted Grand Royal label didn't hurt, either.  Unfortunately,
    most cool cats in the U.S. had moved on to the more ""mature"" post-rock scene
    by the time Bis released <i>The New Transistor Heroes</i>, a high- fructose
    long- player that showed the band spreading out in new directions with varying
    degrees of success.</p><p>
<i>Intendo</i> collects nine tracks of demos, b-sides and rarities recorded over
    the last two years, sandwiched between two cracks at the intro/ outro ""Grand
    Royal With Cheese."" The first proper track, ""Statement of Intent,"" makes it
    known that Bis aren't about to settle for Tootsie Rolls; the song is as immediate
    and melodic as Bis' music has ever been, but not quite as fun to sing along to
    as their previous call- and- response anthems. ""Clockwork Punk"" rectifies this
    with an addictive chorus:</p><p>
<i>To all the people in the east, Clockwork Punk!!!<br/>
    To all the people in the north, Clockwork Punk!!!<br/>
    To all the people in the west, Clockwork Punk!!!<br/>
    And all the people in the south, Clockwork Punk!!!</i></p><p>
    
    Think Kraftwerk covering R.E.M.'s ""Stand"" and you'll have the idea.
    Elsewhere on the sampler you'll find Bis trying out new musical terrain.
    ""Famous"" and ""Automatic Freestyle"" border on ska, while ""Kid Cut"" recalls
    Blur at their ""Chinese Bombs"" punkiest (or for you Japanophiles, Melt
    Banana).  The only track that falls flat is ""Cookie Cutter Kid,"" which
    outlasts its stay, clocking in at a whopping four minutes.</p><p>
    
    In the end, sheer musical and songwriting competence sets Bis apart from
    other progenitors of the Teen-C Revolution such as their American
    counterpart, the Donnas.  If you only pick up Thrill Jockey releases, this
    probably isn't for you.  (Why are you reading this?)  But for all you kiddies
    with sweet tooths out there, don't hesitate to snatch this up.  Watermelon Nerds
    never tasted so good.</p></div>"|725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/725-intendo/|7.5|Zach Hammerman

    They most likely want to be their <i>own</i> band with their <i>own</i> sound.  You can see
    why they might feel that way.  On the other hand, they live in Chicago.  They're not exactly
    jazz, though, and they're anything but the definition of ""post-rock.""  (That award would go
    to me, for the work I did with my band Knopfler in 1971.)  However, this five- piece boasts
    members from a slew of seminal post-rock bands.  In addition, they have a highly intellectual
    jazz approach, experimental tendencies, and they're on Thrill Jockey.  For God's sake, the
    album was even recorded by John McEntire and Bundy K. Brown!  So, sorry to slap a label on ya,
    guys, but you're post-rock.</p><p>
    
    Here's the exception, though: whereas someone like Sam Prekop might use shimmering and chiming 
    guitars mixing Bacharach chords with shuffling jazz rhythms throughout an album, each Isotope
    217 song is completely unpredictable.  Totally.  I mean, alright-- I know going into it that
    it's gonna be, at the very least, vaguely jazz- related.  But that's it.  It's a great thing.
    So, here-- let me spoil the record for you by detailing my personal take on each of the songs.
    Whaddaya say, eh?  This'll be fun.</p><p>
    
    1. <b>""LUH"" (9:41)</b> Bah-da-da!  Damn, that organ's definitely doing its own thing.  Well,
    wait... that bass is kind of doing its own thing, too.  Hey, listen-- that guitar almost
    doesn't even <i>hear</i> the other instruments.  Those drums sound like they're trying to
    soundtrack Keith Moon's death.  Very early '70s Miles Davis.  Sounds like the same approach
    as <i>Dark Magus</i> or <i>Live/Evil</i>-- spontaneous, cacophonous, and held together like
    two shaky hands in a nervous man's prayer.  ...And then, a low rumble and an occasional random
    sequence of notes from a horn.  Then the rumble fades, and the song rebuilds, ending itself
    like a remix of its first two minutes.</p><p>
    
    2. <b>""Audio Champion"" (3:56)</b>  Awww yeah, dude.  I love this song.  I said once that people
    will sample old Squarepusher records for rap albums in 2015, but I almost think stuff like this
    will be more popular.  This is the most bizarre catchy melody in history.  I've never heard
    anything so like jazz, and yet so like pop, and yet so like laidback rap... Oh.  I'm afraid
    I've said too much.  Or too little.  What is this, Rocket Fuel?!</p><p>
    
    3. <b>""New Beyond"" (6:14)</b> A muted... tuba of some kind?  This song sounds pretty ominous.
    Subtle, menacing crescendos, ""You Belong to the City""- style production on the drums, a very
    dirty bass sound, various keyboard tones buried in the mix...  It sounds like final dungeon
    music in an avant-garde Playstation game.  Hey, what the fuck do I know?  I don't exactly
    qualify for the MacArthur Fellowship Award.</p><p>
    
    4. <b>""Rest for the Wicked"" (2:15)</b>  Now, if you're like me, you want <i>so badly</i> for
    this song to be related in some way to Judas Priest.  Not that I'm terribly interested in Rob
    Mazurek's interpretation of <i>Hell Bent for Leather</i> (though I wouldn't mind hearing
    his take on ""Turbo Lover""), but hey, it's Judas Priest.  Anyway, this song is short.  It
    kind of blends right in with the next song.  A nice listen, though, even it if does stand as
    the only truly forgettable track on the record.  I like the fade-out at the end.</p><p>
    
    5. <b>""Looking After Life on Mars"" (8:04)</b>  If you've been waiting to hear Isotope 217
    break into a cross between Miles Davis' <i>Sorcerer</i> and the Heroic Doses' debut, here
    are eight minutes of it!  This is actually one of the great tracks on <i>Utonian Automatic</i>.
    It starts out completely structured and out- of- control upbeat.  The horns are all over the
    place, blaring out one of those trademark Isotope backwards- sounding melodies, and the guitar
    riff, while as basic as an Apple IIc text adventure, is so effectively penetrating that I
    feel like I'm watching scrambled porn.  (Um...)  Underneath this chunky groove lies some
    of the most complex percussion this side of Amon Tobin's ""Piranha Breaks.""  The drumming
    is, simply put, live drum-n-bass.  That guy's amazing.  This track, in particular, makes me
    think of Coke.  And not just because I'm trying to kick the habit-- I'm not.  I mean... I
    don't.  Which is not to say... but I mean...</p><p>
    
    6. <b>""Solaris"" (6:11)</b>  When I'm back in my old 'hood (Hopkins, Minnesota), cruisin' down
    Main Street in my convertible Geo Metro, rollin' up to the Burger King drive-thru, yo, check
    it out, it's <i>real</i>.  'Cause, bitch, I'm a playa-- big balla.  Actually, I'm just some
    white guy who thinks I'm a big balla.  In a spaghetti western.  This is my soundtrack.</p><p>
    
    7. <b>""Real MC's"" (7:18)</b>  Definitely the album's highlight.  Why they put it at the end,
    I'll never know.  Actually, I think I do know.  This song is the dream you forgot you had,
    that sweet slumber during sickness, floating in a suburban backyard pool on a late August
    afternoon, or the last breath of your life.  It's the encapsulation of peace.  It's so
    raw, I just have to cry.  It's like onions, only I'd like it on a burger.  A perfect track
    to bring the album to a close-- it's like falling onto your bed after a 12-hour marathon. 
    And I'm not talking about ""The Real World,"" fool.</p><p>
    
    Alright, maybe you have an idea of what this album can do for you.  If you liked Isotope's
    last record, <i>The Unstable Molecule</i>, I might just suffice to say that this one's better.</p></div>"|4140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4140-utonian-automatic/|8.1|Ryan Schreiber

    Luther was sitting in the back seat, pulling a pair of pantyhose over
    his head.  We were idling in the parking lot of the Grub 'n' Stuff
    convenience store outside of Fairplay.  I'm not sure why we let the car
    run; we were nearly out of gas.  It was Luther's idea, I guess.  Most
    stuff was.</p><p>
    
    ""That's okay, dipshit,"" Luther said. ""This isn't a bank.""</p><p>
    
    He had me on that one.  It'd never occured to me that the science of
    Grub 'n' Stuff robbing might be a little less complicated than that of
    bank robbing.  It was a marginally comforting thought.  Relieved, I
    leaned over to turn the stereo up a bit, just as Luther threw my package
    of hose to the front.  A corner of the cardboard envelope caught me on
    the temple and took a divet of skin out.  Blood began oozing immediately.
    I yelped.</p><p>
    
    ""Man, stop the horsiness and put on your mask.  We don't have time for
    your horsing, horse.""</p><p>
    
    Luther had a real way with words.  As he talked, the hose stretched over
    his open mouth, its surface rippling with his lips.  It looked like two
    people wrestling in a pup tent.  I fumbled with the package of pantyhose,
    singing along under my breath as I did so.  My new favorite album was playing--
    <i>The Gasoline Age</i> by East River Pipe-- and this was my new favorite song:
    ""Down 42nd Street to the Light.""  We got to my new favorite part of the song
    and I sang a little louder: ""La la la- la- la- la la la, yi yi yi- li- ya- la
    yi- ya.""  The second time through, I nearly choked on the hose as it came down
    over my mouth.  I could feel the blood soaking through at my temple.  It was
    gonna hurt to take this thing off.</p><p>
    
    ""What the horsey are we listening to, dipshit?""</p><p>
    
    ""It's East River Pipe.  Be quiet or I'll miss my favorite part.""</p><p>
    
    ""The East River Pipe, huh?  What kind of music is this anyway, space-
    country?""</p><p>
    
    ""Luth, why do you always put 'the' in front of every damn thing?  The
    Target, the McDonald's, the Blink 182, the Beethoven.  It's,
    whaddyacallit...""</p><p>
    
    ""Superfluous?""</p><p>
    
    ""No.  Dumb.  It sounds dumb.  God.  Yeah, I guess it is space- country,
    in a way.  It's bleak, but sentimental and hopeful.  F.M. Cornog's
    voice is warm and emotive, but also a bit detatched.  He used to be
    a homeless guy.  Slept in a New Jersey train station.  That's the life.""</p><p>
    
    I rewound the tape to the beginning, my trembling finger skittering off
    the button.  As the keyboard washes and gentle strumming of ""Shiny Shiny
    Pimpmobile"" filled the car, I tried to regulate my breathing and relax a
    bit.  It worked a little.  We were in the middle of nowhere, which I
    liked.  It was pretty-- went with the music.  Spacious.</p><p>
    
    ""Luth, why don't we just fill the tank and take off?  People out here
    keep shotguns under their counters.""</p><p>
    
    ""There's just one old lady in there, dipshit, and she's asleep on her
    feet.  Plus she's got a lazy eye-- even if she had a gun she couldn't
    aim it.  Wouldn't hit the long side of a horsey, horse.""</p><p>
    
    ""How do you know she's got a lazy eye?""</p><p>
    
    ""Cuz I saw it when I went in to buy the pantyhose.  Jeez-hus, what are
    you so worried about?""</p><p>
    
    I thought about that for a second, holding the steering wheel and
    whistling along with the music.  It seemed to me that the point of a
    road trip was to drive around listening to tapes and looking at stuff,
    not robbing convenience stores.  Luther seemed to be missing something.</p><p>
    
    ""Hey Luth, I got an idea.  How 'bout you go in and take care of things?
    You're the expert here, right?  And I'll wait out here.  The getaway
    car, like.  You say there's just one old lady there.  You don't need
    me.""</p><p>
    
    ""Y'know, diphorse, you might be onto something there.  As they say.
    Maybe I will do that, keep your horsiness from horsing things up,
    that's for sure.  You just wait here, like you said.  I'll be right back.""</p><p>
    
    Luther got out of the car, realigned his hose, and strutted towards the
    Grub 'n' Stuff.  As soon as he disappeared into the door, I gunned it
    and fishtailed onto the highway.  I could hear the bells tied to the
    Grub 'n' Stuff's door clanging behind me as I took off.  ""Cybercar"" was
    playing, and I sang along with the coda: ""...go, go, go, go...""  Through
    the hose it ended up sounding like, ""Ghugh, ghugh, ghugh,"" but who gave
    a shit?</p><p>
    
    A mile later I pulled the mask off, ripping away my fresh scab, and tossed
    it out the window.  A mile down the road, I ran out of gas.  It was good
    while it lasted, I guess.  I opened the door and swung my legs out, planting
    my feet on the shoulder, and sat there for a minute bobbing my head to the
    slow-mo, road- rapture melancholy of ""Party Drive.""  As soon as the song
    ended, I popped out the tape and stuck my thumb in the air.</p></div>"|2659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2659-the-gasoline-age/|8.0|Zach Hooker

I called up the CDC and
    they had no idea what I was talking about.  True, I've only found one case
    of this disease, but the evidence is bold and shocking.  (And don't worry--
    it's not airborne.)  I think it might be transmitted through a shoe boutique
    in Brooklyn.  I think I'm going to either call the it ""Brent's Disease""
    (since I discovered it, obviously) or ""Deee-Litification Disease.""  Slowly,
    but surely, the ailment mutates its carriers into Deee-Lite.  Scary, ain't
    it?  Right now we should be quarantining the Scotch trio Bis and making
    sure this hideous affliction never crosses the Atlantic.  (There is fear,
    however, that Luscious Jackson may also be infected, though it's too soon
    to say for sure.)</p><p>
    
    The most obvious symptom is the physical metamorphosis into Deee-Lite.
    John Disco, the taller, lankier one, has grown his sideburns into shaggy
    Eastern beasts, and has taken to wearing knit ski-caps and tacky button-
    down shirts.  Tragically, he's becoming Super DJ Dimitry.  As the condition
    progresses, increasingly ridiculous hair growth patterns are appearing on
    his face.  Poor Sci-Fi Steven (if that <i>is</i> his real name) wears
    his jet hair in the distinctive bowl of DJ Towa Tei.   And Manda Rin,
    unfortunately, is experiencing the most devastating cell degeneration--
    she's slowly melting into the skin- tight Lady Miss Kier-- all breasts and
    eyeballs, her anime head luring in boys like a sexy hydrocephalic pokemon.
    Next up: rainbow clothing.</p><p>
    
    Yet, Deee-Litification Disease does not only manifest visibly.  The symptoms
    can also be heard sonically, as evident on Bis' second proper LP, <i>Social
    Dancing</i>.  Please submit the track ""Eurodisco"" as tissue sample A.
    First of all, it's called ""Eurodisco,"" sounding House-ish and/or latter-
    era U2-ish, neither of which is anywhere near ""good.""  The song thumps along
    like a part- time Pet Shop Boys as echoing vocals bounce off mirrored studio
    walls.  The melody mimics Kim Wilde's '80s hit ""You Keep Me Hanging On--""
    every sound seems crafted by lasers, the run- of- the- mill ""ump-tiss"" beat
    rolling drearily along on cruise control.  This ""groove"" flows right into
    ""Action and Drama,"" where Rin exclaims, ""Give me Bananarama!""  (Actually, I
    think they're available.  It shouldn't be too difficult to arrange.)</p><p>
    
    ""I'm a Slut"" and ""Shopaholic"" are the deep, introspective numbers on
    <i>Social Dancing</i>.  They take obvious stances towards femininity and
    sexual politics, much like Deee-Lite, in a ""Is my dress too short?  Deal
    with it!"" manner.  ""Shopaholic"" laundry- lists products that Bis enjoys
    purchasing with captivating detai... er, no.  It doesn't help that Manda
    Rin's voice sounds as sultry and welcome as an alarm clock at 6:48 AM.
    Brief respite from the screeching comes with the guest appearance of
    northwestern indie rock icon and Amazon.com writer Lois Maffeo-- it manages
    to make a K Records stalwart sound like the damn Sneaker Pimps.</p><p>
    
    More evidence of the disease lies with the fact that Bis are in the midst
    of their ""mature"" era, much like Deee-Lite's 1994 release <i>Dewdrops in the
    Garden</i>.  When Bis tries to claim punk cred on ""It's All New"" with their
    rallying ""glamour won't hide the truth,"" you just feel like calling them up
    and reminding them that they posed for New York's official teenage skater
    coke- head fashion catalog, Alloy.</p><p>
    
    Listening to <i>Social Dancing</i> is remarkably similar to watching anime
    porn-- you have to be either somewhat disturbed or Japanese to enjoy it.
    Even though Bis are slowly, sadly deteriorating into Deee-Lite, they still
    never manage to ""spill chills on your back, with satisfaction.""  <i>Social
    Dancing</i> is a drunken, disappointing hook-up at a retro nightclub
    (someplace you should never have been in the first place).</p></div>"|722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/722-social-dancing/|5.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

    IQU (formerly icu) are still struggling to realize their vast potential. They come
    closest with their live show, where magnetic frontman K.O. lays down the beats on
    turntables with a guitar around his neck, headphones on his head, and a lengthy
    cigarette dangling from his lower lip. To see him working the theramin with the
    neck of his guitar as he stands between a fashion- conscious girl on Moog and a
    spastic punk on standup bass is to see one possible permutation of the rockband
    of the future. But as fun as they are to dance to, IQU's compositional skills are
    underdeveloped, and their records inspire only passing interest.</p><p>
    
    And then there's filmmaker and performance artist Miranda July. On <i>Girls on
    Dates</i>, July adds a surreal spoken word narrative to IQU's backing tracks.
    That's right, I said ""spoken word."" You thought it went out in the early '90s?
    No such luck.  And while the music on <i>Girls on Dates</i> is rather dull, July's
    vocals render the tunes virtually unlistenable.  Think about it: how often do you
    reach for those Bongwater LPs? For Chrissake, people, records should be enjoyed
    repeatedly, and no one wants to hear these goofy stories more than once.</p><p>
    
    July's contributions are a shame, because ""Kida Co-Coma""-- a song on which IQU
    comes up with a cool metallic hip-hop beat and runs it through a ridiculously
    overstated flanger-- definitely hints at something interesting. With that groove
    and a gentle synthesizer line, ""Kida Co-Coma"" is somewhat reminiscent of Boards
    of Canada's warm electronic universe.  Sadly, Miranda's lame storytelling kills
    it dead. The rest of the EP, consisting of three different mixes of the title track,
    has less good music for July to ruin. The lilting, forgettable original seems like
    mere ambience for July's rant, and the two stripped- down remixes (one by K.O. and
    one by DJ Swiggs) thankfully reduce the words to a few looped phrases. So, be sure
    and catch IQU when they come to town, but don't bother picking up this record.</p></div>"|4048.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4048-girls-on-dates-ep/|3.9|Mark Richard-San

And you wait, and you
    wait, and you wait... and suddenly, it's in your hands.  And you think,
    ""Shit!  <i>Come Pick Me Up</i> is just about to be released?  It's already
    the end of July?!""  This depresses me.  From this day forth, I vow to no
    longer anticipate the future and appreciate the present.  I mean, it seems
    only yesterday I'd just gone to my first ID show (adshamedly, I admit-- the
    Apples in Stereo), and I'm already 23.</p><p>
    
    I shouldn't get started talking about what a long, pointless road it is
    to the grave, and how, regardless of what questions we have about the
    future, the only certain thing is that all signs point to death.  Yeah,
    I won't get started on that.  After all, it's Friday!  Since Monday,
    you've impatiently waited for today, and now it's finally here!  (That's
    one week of your life you'll never get back.)  So now that you've wasted
    the week lying in wait, savor the day.  You haven't got much time left.</p><p>
    
    Ah, mortality.  Remember when you first heard Superchunk?  Years ago, wasn't
    it?  Yeah, you were just a naive little punk back in those days.  For some
    of us it was longer ago than others.  Personally, my first experience with
    the band was <i>Here's Where the Strings Come In</i>.  You've probably been
    listening to 'em since 1990, ya indie rocker.  You were into them before it
    was cool, man!  Just a little high schooler at the time, or maybe even a
    junior high school if you were super-hip.  Brag all you want, but where in
    the fuck did that time go?  You're old!   And if you think you feel bad,
    imagine being in Superchunk.  I mean, it's not that seem old now-- they
    don't, really.  But I'd venture a guess that they've passed the 30 mark.</p><p>
    
    And for all their years of indie rock experience, Superchunk haven't changed
    their sound much since the first record.  Their publishing company is called
    ""All the Songs Sound the Same,"" for god's sake!  It's a statement that's
    partially true.  The songs do, upon your first listen to any of their albums,
    sound the same.  You've gotta do a little mining to uncover Mac McCaughan's
    crispy pop hooks.  Once you spin the record a couple of times, though, the
    music stands out-- subtly catchy, traditional but inventive, unforgettable.</p><p>
<i>Come Pick Me Up</i> rubs off a little easier than 1997's <i>Indoor
    Living</i>-- a terrific pop record, but by no means the band's finest
    hour.  They're playing it slightly lower key this time around, abandoning
    some of the full-on rock stuff for hummable laidback pop.  Songs like the
    opening cut, ""So Convinced,"" the stunning ""Hello Hawk"" (one of <i>Come Pick
    Me Up</i>'s finest), and the sublime ""Tiny Bombs"" are Superchunk at their
    mellowy mellowest.  In fact, except for the occasional instance of severe
    rock thunderstorms that pop up sporadically, it's a pretty gentle affair.</p><p>
    
    Sporting lovely organic production by way of Mr. Touchy (you might know
    him as Chicago post-rock producer Jim O'Rourke), the album contains some
    unexpected orchestral flourishes and rowdy mixing board-enhanced percussion.
    However, I'd expected more input from the sensitive little guy.  I mean, for
    a Jim O'Rourke-produced joint, it sounds remarkably similar to the production
    work of past Superchunk albums.</p><p>
    
    This softer, cushiony Superchunk does make a damn fine record, though.  The
    music is decidedly more advanced and complex than in the early days, but
    still retains the youthful light-heartedness that makes these guys so
    irresistible.  And McCaughan's lovable boyish falsetto may momentarily
    conjure memories of your young teenage days, takin' it easy at mom and dad's,
    wastin' time in your bedroom, drivin' around with your newly obtained license,
    and listening to <i>Foolish</i> with not a care in the world.  But don't let
    it get you down or anything.  After all, it's Friday!</p></div>"|7618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7618-come-pick-me-up/|7.7|Ryan Schreiber

    is still a great live band.  The vital essence of one of these guys' shows
    is its alcoholic synchronicity: the band is drunk, the audience is drunk,
    the soundman is drunk, and the guy who sells the t-shirts is drunk.  It's
    easy to be awed by all that beery, convivial rock-n-roll magic.  And if
    you're one of the hundreds of fans in the grip of a Guinness-induced haze,
    you might even be tempted to pick up one of Robert Pollard's solo albums
    from the merch table.</p><p>
    
    The next day, after sobering up a bit, you put the disc in to try to recapture
    the magic you felt the night before.  Of course, it doesn't really work,
    because now you're sober.  Pollard's not though-- he's drunk and throwing up
    all over your carpet.  Somehow, it seems less fun. (I don't mean to imply
    that Pollard is drunk all the time, just that every time <i>I</i> see him,
    he's drunk.)</p><p>
    
    It's easy to see why I feel a bit conflicted toward Pollard these days--
    he's consistently shown a complete lack of understanding as to what draws
    people to his music.  On one hand, that's refreshing because he shouldn't be
    pandering to the indie cabal.  On the other, it's annoying because I'm part
    of that cabal, damnit. First, he jumps ship from Matador to fuckin' TVT; then
    he releases <i>Do the Collapse</i>, an album with nearly none of the qualities
    that made Guided by Voices good; and on top of that, he keeps issuing mediocre
    solo albums every other month.</p><p>
    
    The wiser among us already know to steer clear of Pollard's solo albums,
    since the filler ratio on regulation GBV albums is high enough as it is. So
    why am I recommending <i>Speak Kindly of Your Volunteer Fire Department</i>
    against conventional wisdom? Two words: Doug Gillard. The ex-Cobra Verde
    guitarist had already earned my respect for penning <i>Mag Earwhig</i>'s
    standout track, ""I Am a Tree.""  Here, he proves himself as the Keith Richards
    that Pollard's Mick Jagger has been looking for all along: a solid musician,
    a nimble guitarist, and a grounding force to balance out Pollard's more
    self-indulgent urges.  And while Gillard co-wrote only four of these songs,
    his influence can be felt throughout the whole album.  He takes Pollard's
    diamond-in-the-rough talent and polishes it just enough to let it shine,
    while retaining its lo-fi vibe.</p><p>
    
    You can pretty much skip the first two tracks and head straight to ""Pop Zeus,""
    on which Gillard's chirpy riff rides an irresistible wave of driving rock.
    Starting there, Pollard and Gillard reel off a series of tunes that are as good
    or better than anything off <i>Do the Collapse</i>: the downbeat power-balladry
    of ""Slick as Snails"" (which is miles better than the syrupy ""Hold On Hope"");
    the stark, watery sadness of ""Port Authority;"" the picture-perfect pop of
    ""And I Don't (So Now I Do)""; and the comic-book fantasia ""Tight Globes,"" which
    beats ""Teenage FBI"" at its own game.</p><p>
    
    So at least the music side of things is taken care of. But the lyrics? Ah...
    the lyrics. Well, Pollard occasionally turns ugly phrases like, ""Pagan shutters
    described at shrine/ Dark stems large elephantine,"" or ""Iceberg heads and alien
    flavors/ This being a giftshop.""  But there are also quite a few glimmers of
    meaningfulness on <i>Speak Kindly</i>-- maybe more than on any other Pollard solo
    effort, which makes it exponentially better than the others.  Pollard can be
    subtly chilling (""The sight of you/ Is building up a war inside of me/ You're my
    kind of woman/ I get rid of you"") or full of oddly touching hopefulness (""Knock
    down all the houses/ Pull up all the trees/ Make a wish/ Life is beautiful"") when
    he tries to be.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, I know that saying that <i>Speak Kindly of Your Volunteer Fire
    Department</i> is Pollard's best solo album isn't saying a whole lot. Even
    saying that it's more satisfying than <i>Do the Collapse</i> isn't saying
    much more. But when you look at it another way-- that this is the best
    Pollard's done since <i>Mag Earwhig</i>-- isn't it enough?  If nothing else,
    it'll tide you over until Guided by Voices get smart and release a double
    live album while someone's still interested.</p></div>"|6377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6377-speak-kindly-of-your-volunteer-fire-department/|7.4|Nick Mirov

    Apparently, their glossy new Ric Ocasek- produced album went way over budget,
    and Matador wasn't too thrilled about footing the bill.  The album is presently
    being shopped, and one of the labels they're considering is... TVT!  TVT?
    What's up with that?  TVT's home to freaky industrial artists, early Nine
    Inch Nails and Dee Snider's <i>Strangeland</i>.  Please tell me where Guided
    By Voices fit in there.  Eh, regardless, I can't wait for the finished product.
    In the meantime, Bob Pollard's just issued <i>Kid Marine</i>, his third solo
    outing, on the micro- indie Rockathon Records.</p><p>
    
    As we all know, it doesn't take much effort to write a Robert Pollard song.
    In fact, I'll show you just how easy it is right this second, if you'll be
    my humble assistant and throw on an obscure Edgar Winter song in the
    background.  Okay, now sing these lyrics over them: ""Wacked revolution is
    mexican burnout/ Margarine selection will haunt you/ Mirrored globes in
    shivering quasars get thrilling/ The horror is electrical establishment/
    Grapple in the stronghold/ The current undermines the weak/ Daring
    prosecution orders twelve more to the bar/ Grainmills crumble when you
    sing stormy madness.""  Now, repeat that, and then fade the song out.
    Congratulations!  We've just sold a million records.</p><p>
    
    Ah, but there's more to it than that and we both know it.  Pollard's
    somehow achieved the dream of every songwriter-- to churn out countless
    terrific melodies day in and day out, and to be recognized by the legions
    of indie rock fans as a legend in his own time.  (And all this with just
    a beat- up four- track and a six pack.)  The only explanation possible
    would be that old Bob's got talent-- unmistakable, exciting, raw talent.
    But on <i>Kid Marine</i>, some of his trademark magic seems to be fading.
    It's possible he hasn't got much time left in the spotlight.</p><p>
<i>Kid Marine</i>'s a Robert Pollard <i>solo</i> album, so it's a little
    more experimental (read: tossed off) than a formal Guided By Voices
    record.  But as far as the established pattern of Pollard's records goes,
    it's the same as the others: there are a bunch of great songs alongside
    a bunch of duds.  Some of the great songs on <i>Kid Marine</i> are the
    rock ballad ""The Big Make-Over,"" the reverb- drenched ""Living Upside
    Down,"" a nice, slow number called ""Enjoy Jerusalem,"" and the closing
    epic (at least, epic for a Robert Pollard song) ""Island Crimes.""  </p><p>
    
    Sadly, the duds on <i>Kid Marine</i> are, for the first time in Pollard's
    career, utterly abyssmal.  ""Submarine Teams"" wouldn't be so bad if it
    didn't feature such a mind- numbingly awful vocal sample repeated to
    infinity, ""Men Who Create Fright"" is a throwaway experimentation with
    too many effects pedals, ""Television Prison"" is more torturous than
    almost any torture you can imagine, and ""Powerblessing"" sounds like
    it was recorded straight to walkman in a high school gymnasium.  So,
    fellow Pollard fans, my advice is to use your judgement on this one.
    It might be in your best interest to hold off until the next Guided
    By Voices disc comes out.  Hopefully, that one'll be better.</p></div>"|6379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6379-kid-marine/|5.3|Ryan Schreiber

    Angel: ""James, this is the angel on your right shoulder. I've been fighting
    with the devil over on the left for about five years now, and I've finally
    broken free of his sinister grasp. Over these past five years, I've been
    tied fast-- with forces I cannot begin to describe to your mortal reckoning--
    to the inner anvil bone of your ear. One of the devil's minions, a wench
    spindled of slick sinew, patrolled my imprisonment from a perch on the
    pestle. As we speak, the devil and his henchmen are on vacation in Brent
    DiCrescenzo's nether regions. I know not when they might return, so my time
    is precious.</p><p>
    
    ""First, let me apologize about the hair.  I'd have argued for something
    short-- close to the ears.  Oh, and blast that devil for messing with your
    last Macha review! His barbed whispers obviously hit cochlea harder than
    Macha's wonderful thunder. When I heard the devil tell you to write that
    Macha's first record was composed of loops and samples, I nearly summoned
    the strength to shatter my bonds. I heard and felt the hypnotic, manmade
    sounds of guitar, bass, vibraphone, keys, and pumping drums trembling my
    bony prison. It was sweet reprieve from my sentence.</p><p>
    
    ""But now I've been
    given the opportunity to right such devilish acts, for Macha have released
    another mystical record, just as I have won escape. Others of my shoulder-
    angel brethren have heard <i>See It Another Way</i>, and I've heard nothing
    but praise from them. Admittedly, they're a bit overly positive and kiss-ass,
    being shoulder- angels and all, but this music really is what we shoulder-
    angels want to hear.</p><p>
    
    ""Trickling water, muffled laughter, dancing dulcimer, and a humming organ
    (the band's legendary ""fun machine"") quickly kidnap your soul on the opening
    track, ""Riding the Rails,"" and flee to Macha's world of exotic foliage and
    dimly- lit basements. ""Salty"" then commences to pummel your gray matter into
    ambrosia under the wooden shoe- stomps of Balinese gods. Deep, fuzzy bass
    and thundering drums keep mortals in check with wrath, as layers of organ,
    dulcimer, vibraphone, and other gamalan goodies effervesce from the impact.
    Joshua McKay's breathy vocals puff sweet tension in the bellows. ""The
    Nipplegong"" pulses similarly with street- market intimacy. The hyper-
    chiming dulcimer and steel drum sting like a thousand bees until your
    skin is blissfully numb.</p><p>
    
    ""Macha's vapors are captured tightly in Mischo McKay's thick, steady drums.
    They pound with incessant, skeletal strength. And just to show that they're
    not content to wander the Indonesian archipelago, collecting tools, Macha
    explore other international textures. ""Between Stranded Sonars"" drones with
    Celtic clangs, crying fiddle, and sultry slide guitar, single- handedly
    destroying Mogwai at their own game. Macha's crisp cacophony brings to mind
    My Bloody Valentine, if My Bloody Valentine were Louisville indie- rockers
    stranded in a South Pacific jungle after a spectacular plane crash.  James,
    I'm telling you, the cover art alone is worth the price.  And here's a
    little secret-- the kanji on the bottom of the cover translates to ""ramen.""
    Who would think that ramen packaging could be so beautiful?  But then,
    finding divinity in the commonplace is Macha's unique skill. </p><p>
    
    ""With that, James, I must flee. Just some real quick, good advice: hug a baby,
    sell your car, stop smoking so much damn weed, and quit watching all that WB.""</p></div>"|5016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5016-see-it-another-way-ep/|8.3|Brent DiCrescenzo

    finally get back behind the fridge and get all that dust and grime outta
    there.  I moved the fridge forward and gave one quick sweep.  Instantly,
    a whirlwind of amorphous guitars shot by my right ear.  I turned quickly...
    the sound grew.  Soon it filled the apartment-- a spacious, ethereal
    crescendo... blaring louder and louder.  Sound reverberated off the
    hardwood floors and high ceilings, shattering windows and glass.  The
    thundering bass shook the building's foundation, and with each explosive
    drumbeat and crashing cymbal, the roof lifted and fell.  90-mph streamline
    winds ripped through the window, pushing me against the wall and crushing
    me under the weight of the refrigerator.  And finally, at the music's
    climax, the entire block crumbled.</p><p>
    I awoke, reincarnated as a tadpole in a stream.  Then I cycled through
    1,200 more lives until I became human again.  When I was finally reborn,
    it was the year 20076.  It is now the year 20099.</p><p>
    Today, I visited the local read/write store and stumbled onto a reissue of
    the Timeout Drawer's <i>Record of Small Histories</i>.  It originally saw
    release on a small Old Chicago label called Some Odd Pilot some 18,000 years
    ago. Intrigued, I bought it.
    </p><p>
    The sound is authentic, alright, but in many ways, it sounds as if it could
    be released today.  The echoing guitar lines and shimmering production sound
    influenced by the old Kure dizks from the 20080s, particularly the space-psychy
    <i>Pornography</i> and <i>Disintegration</i>.  This is mixed with a very spacious
    ambient presence recalling modern-day superstars Wendy and Carlisle, Milk and
    Saucer Attack, and even ambient founder Sprou Eno.  There are also some vaguely
    ""past-rock"" flourishes that sound remarkably like newer Zjicago artists Tortix,
    Gastr del Soup, and the Brie and Steak.
    </p><p>
<i>Record of Small Histories</i> is comprised of seven mostly instrumental tracks
    lasting just over 50 minutes.  The songs are somewhat formulaic-- they all being quietly
    with a fade-in or a quiet drone, layering more instruments and building complex walls
    of sound.  But this isn't your standard space-psych trio-- instead of noodling their
    way to some improvisational higher consciousness, the Timeout Drawer's songs feature
    <i>actual pre-written melodies</i> which lend some much needed direction and structure
    to the genre.  Unfortunately, it's still a bit gloomy for my tastes, though tracks like
    ""Lull,"" ""1000 Reels,"" and ""Tourist"" make it worth the Eeyore-ish mood it puts me in.
    </p><p>
    For having been recorded using primitive digital technology, and archaic instruments
    like electrical analog keyboards, drums (!), guitars and something called a ""synth,""
    this record sounds pretty nice.  It would be interesting to see what people thought
    of it 20,000 years from now.

    himself as one of the leading playaz in the electronic music industry by
    creating (with the help of people like Aphex Twin and Squarepusher) a new
    sub-genre of jungle music, lovingly referred to as ""drill-n-bass.""  His
    trademark skittering beats, packed to the bone with archaic video game
    sound effects and melodies that were as memorable as they were inventive
    were an inspiration not only to millions of aspiring DJs and producers,
    but to writers like myself.  Paradinas proved that not everything had
    been done, and that, when peppered with genius, drum-n-bass could tackle
    any other style of electronica and knock it to the floor with one perfectly
    programmed punch.</p><p>
    What a shame, then, that on <i>The Fear</i>, the EP that previews his
    latest long player, <i>Royal Astronomy</i>, he would practically abandon
    his acclaimed drill-n-bass sound and opt for digitized string sections
    and a lifeless female vocalist.  On the EP's opening and title cut, we're
    presented with a repeating (and not all that stimulating) chord structure
    that is neither as catchy or clever as the stunning stuff off 1997's
    classic <i>Lunatic Harness</i> and its subsequent singles.  Just then,
    vocalist Kazumi makes her overwhelmingly casual appearance (she offers
    no emotion whatsoever, as though she's just there to get paid), singing
    unintellegible lyrics over beats that seem like effortless emulations
    of the drum tracks from ""Brace Yourself"" and ""Hasty Boom Alert.""</p><p>
    ""Houzz 8"" is, as proclaimed by its abstract title, house music.  Forgive
    me if I sound a little irritated, but this guy is capable of bigger and
    better things.  The stale bass-kick, hi-hat and handclaps do nothing for the
    overly complex and dischordant keyboard freakout.  ""Morning Frolic"" is
    <i>The Fear</i>'s standout track, with its dark, layered orchestration and
    computerized soprano.  Unfortunately, the percussion goes absent on this
    number, and it's sorely missed.  The end result is a stripped-down,
    skeletal track that could just as easily have been penned by any one of
    today's generic Hollywood filmscore producers.
    </p><p>
<i>The Fear</i> ends with a trip-hop take on the album's title cut,
    another genre Paradinas could stand to stay away from, if only because
    he brings nothing new to the table.  What's more, the track is horribly
    distorted-- a trait which might have been more welcome had it not sounded
    so incredibly accidental.
    </p><p>
    So, I don't know what to say, really.  Perhaps Paradinas was feeling
    experimental and wanted to take it out on an EP rather than cram the
    stuff on to the full-length.  Or maybe he's searching for a new sound.
    Hopefully, this is the case.  I'd hate to see all that talent wasted.</p></div>"|8324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8324-the-fear-ep/|4.9|Ryan Schreiber

Beeeeoo.  The room filled with the glow of 80 small, flashing LED
    lights.  The equipment was strewn throughout the room, connected by standard
    black coax cables.  An 8"" green monochrome monitor displayed a flat, straight
    line that would hop to life, mapping a thousand soundwaves, as soon as Mike
    Paradinas desired it.  A moment of calm silence ensued, and then, with the
    tap of a single button, the LEDs switched from red to green.  Here was the
    finished project.</p><p>
    The stacatto filled Mike Paradinas' studio.  Labeled instrument Xyb044 took
    a leading part on viola.  Bells chimed over the strings as the lights flashed
    in rhythm.  ""Scaling.""  Paradinas mouthed the word, titling the piece that had
    cost him all of Monday, a day which might otherwise have been spent eating
    unsalted rice cakes and enjoying the warm comforts of ""Interior Motives"" on HGTV.
    It was to be the opening track in his final opus, <i>Royal Astronomy</i>, and
    it sounded great with those out- of- control skittering, jazz breaks.</p><p>
    ""My work will transcend the greatest composers known to man,"" Paradinas schemed.
    That's when the fuse blew.  ""Fuck!""  Mike raced to the laundry room, flipped
    the switch marked ""Studio1,"" and shot back upstairs to see what damage the outage
    had caused.  The room was silent, aside from the sound of the mainframe's rebooting
    hard disk.  The equipment had been reset and now sat eagerly awaiting Paradinas'
    next command.  Mike checked the programming.  All the music was there... but where
    were the underlying subtleties, the neat effects, and most importantly, where was
    the rhythm?!  Poor Mike hadn't saved his progress.
    </p><p>
    In the days that followed, Paradinas plunged into the depths of his deepest depression
    since ""Alf"" was removed from NBC's Monday night lineup.  He spent weeks in denial,
    teary and uninspired, until it hit him: he could get by pitching the largely
    percussionless album as a new direction for his work.  Elaborate electronic chamber
    music!  This would certainly be the next big thing.  Of course, some songs did seem
    to miss his trademark drill-n-bass beats.  For these select few tracks, he would
    program some standard beat filler just to spice things up.  And by the end of the day--
    bang!-- <i>Royal Astronomy</i>.
    </p><p>
    Alright, that's probably not what really happened.  But listening to this
    record in contrast to the sensory overload of 1997's <i>Lunatic Harness</i>,
    and even his earlier work on albums like <i>Bluff Limbo</i> and <i>In Pine
    Effect</i>, it's clear that something snapped in the ambition department of
    Paradinas' neural net.  Here, we're presented with 14 tracks of mostly lush
    orchestration and very little beat. Now, I don't know about you, but if I want
    to hear a symphonic masterpiece, I'm probably not gonna go digging through the
    record store's ""club"" section to locate it.
    </p><p>
    And, to put it as gently as possible, Paradinas is no Ravel.  I've been
    listening to this record for months, trying to locate its place in modern
    electronic music, and it just doesn't fit anywhere-- not because it's so
    vastly different from what's being done out there these days, but because
    it's so tossed- off.  It's sad to see an artist as obviously talented as
    Paradinas release an album that sounds like it took a weekend to record.
    </p><p>
<i>Royal Astronomy</i> offers very little for fans of Paradinas' work, and
    next to nothing for the electronic music fan-- it's \xB5-Ziq without the \xB5-Z.
    It's hard to say at this point whether \xB5-Ziq has lost his edge.  I mean,
    it's conceivable that this record is just a transistion to something
    completely new and different.  But one thing's for sure: this album is
    boring as shit.</p></div>"|8322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8322-royal-astronomy/|5.1|Ryan Schreiber

    almost abusive list-makers.  Best of the year, best of the decade,
    best shows we've seen, best bootleg we own, ten albums we'd take to
    the wondrous desert island-- we set in order the apparent chaos of our
    musical consumption with almost Germanic precision.  Even more surprising
    than our secret obsession is its source, which I've concluded, after being
    bombarded by ""Best of the 90's"" lists from mags, rags, e-zines and friends,
    is harmless sentimentality.  In reality, our annual exercise is not
    necessarily pursued out of a need to make sense of musical output, but more
    accurately, by a need to recapture, and perhaps even share, that fleeting
    first moment of love with an album.</p><p>
    Thus, in the glut of lists that the end of a decade brings, I've been
    arduously reveling in the past, remembering the musical climes of the
    times with friends and colleagues as I develop one of my own.  Inevitably,
    the lists, top-heavy with early '90s releases, draw an ironic conclusion
    for rock fans.  The decade that began heralded by such a beautiful din
    will apparently end in a whimper.  Largely unable to cash the blank check
    written by the Pixies and later Nirvana, late 90's rockers sit at the head
    of a lost estate, viewing Ricky Martin videos like a broken promise.</p><p>
    Of course, we rock fans are a bipolar bunch.  For every time we've
    erroneously mourned rock's untimely demise, we also too promiscuously
    hopped into bed with its false saviors.  The latest in the strange
    lineage of these bedfellows is Verbena, an edgy trio whose Southern
    fried debut, <i>Souls for Sale</i>, caught the ears of more than a few
    desperate rock critics, along with head Foo Fighter Dave Grohl who
    produced the band's new major label debut, <i>Into the Pink</i>.
    </p><p>
    Alluding to a pedigree that makes rock critics drool, the outfit kicks off
    <i>Pink</i> with a Big Star-esque lullaby before settling into a more
    trampled path.  The remainder of effort finds the band heading northwest
    from its southern rock debut to Grohl's vision of post-grunge, which sounds
    a heck of a lot like a second-rate Nirvana album.  The album's title track
    is like Cobain warmed over, just as ""Baby Got Shot"" is even a smaller shadow
    of his former self than even Frank Black now casts.
    </p><p>
    It's true that Verbena are able to semi-favorably execute these pale
    imitations is an accomplishment in itself these days and might even
    signal a small ray of hope should the band decide to stake its own path

    is back with her third solo album. But just because she's calmer now
    than she was during her days with Throwing Muses, don't assume <i>Sky
    Motel</i> is a washed- out affair. Hersh's demons may have been vanquished,
    but her lyrical acuity can still pierce and unsettle.  Nowadays, it's
    just not so strident.</p><p>
    
    Hersh revisits Throwing Muses territory by putting together a band for
    <i>Sky Motel</i>. And while I shamefully pine for her to pull off another
    stunning <i>Real Ramona</i>, I really have nothing to complain about here.
    Hersh sounds comfortable and relaxed, and the music reflects her even
    keel. Producer Trina Shoemaker has kept the music subdued and given space
    for Hersh's lyrics to spread out their beguiling wings. The songs have a
    bizarre glamour to them. Hersh beckons us into her seemingly placid world,
    only to whisper sweetly in our ears that all is not well here. But it's too
    difficult to heed a warning whispered so dearly.</p><p>
    
    Thus ""White Trash Moon"" warns us not to stare at the neighbor's hair or
    at their underwear; the freaks live next door to Hersh these days,
    rather than within her. During ""A Cleaner Light,"" Hersh again warns us to
    ""keep away from the freaks on the fringe/ They only talk to you because
    you give them a good excuse to cry."" These songs not only advise us, but
    they also remind Hersh not to let go of the handrail.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Sky Motel</i>'s standout track, ""Caffeine,"" Hersh responds to the
    barking of her black dog of manic depression. She sings, ""The best of us
    puking/ The rest of us not doing so well."" She wishes that ""we were lonely/
    We were boring."" These are her bipolar voices siren- calling again. Hersh
    resists by not acting upon their persuasions; she acknowledges they'll
    always be a part of her, and in a line of truly moving pathos, she sums
    up her situation: ""You're driving and I'm your backseat shadow.""</p><p>
    
    However, the record's single, ""Echo,"" affirms her strength, (albeit in
    typically oxymoronic Hersh style). Amid Brazilia- styled lounge rhythms,
    Hersh proclaims that she craves ""the very loudest sound/ I'm chasing
    everybody/ I'm shaking everybody down/I'm loving everybody."" This exhilaration
    is matched on ""Costa Rica"" when she coos, ""I caught us kissing on a plane in
    California/ It wasn't tame, but just the same/ I would love a better
    drug/ You lucky jerk."" It's as though she used to see stability as a
    hallucinogen, but now, she's become resilient to the phantasmagoria of
    reality and aspires to try for the high that the non- manic world seeks.</p><p>
<i>Sky Motel</i> is a powerful, graceful album of quiet victory, then.
    Hersh no longer considers herself aberrant. This newly- harnessed stability
    doesn't mean that Hersh doesn't perceive the weirdos and the crazies; it
    means that now she can start to comment on other people's wayward behavior
    rather than making uncontrolled autobiographies of her own manias.</p></div>"|3841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3841-sky-motel/|8.2|Paul Cooper

It is, after all, one of the most
    played out catchphrases of the decade. But check out these Get Up Kids
    lyrics! I have no choice! They plug a vocabulary of pathetic loneliness
    into a Mad Libs of humdrum love songs.</p><p>
<li>""How do I find her/ Bearing my heart in hand?""<br/>
<li>""Last night on the Mass Pike/ I thought I was losing you/ Last night, I
    fell in love with you.""<br/>
<li>""I think I've waited long enough/ I need you here.""<br/>
<li>""Does anyone remember when/ Around the world and back again/ Was a dream
    not quite so clear?""<br/>
<li>""Sooner or later more/ These words to paper pour.""<p>
    
    All your favorite emo cliches are here! The geographical names (""Mass Pike"")!
    The play on words with geographical names and girls names (""Anne Arbour"")!
    Giddy nostalgia! Giddy geography! Writing references! Seasons! Missing
    kissing! It's ironic that so- called ""emo"" lyrics have become utterly
    devoid of any emotion due to incessant repetition. The music monotonously
    circles above in a similar holding pattern. ""One Year Later"" and ""Red Letter
    Day"" mix the juvenile snotrocket punk of Blink 182 with the Midwestern
    Camero anthems of John Cougar. But really, it just sounds like the Promise
    Ring with nasally vocals, country production, and gratuitous pick- scrapes.</p><p>
    
    As far as the band's sound, well... the Connells come to mind, and the Get
    Up Kids should be punished for that synaptic response alone.  ""Forgive and
    Forget"" comes frighteningly close to those Goo Goo Dolls songs that the
    Ricky Lake- lookin' bass player writes and sings. In fact, a latent ""about
    to become the Goo Goo Dolls"" feel runs throughout the entire EP.  I mean,
    at least their debut featured the sonic boom of Bob Weston's production.
    <i>Red Letter Day</i>, on the other hand, should be pointed in the direction
    of music advisors planning Drew Barrymore soundtracks at Hollywood Records.</p><p>
    
    The closing two songs, ""Anne Arbour"" and ""Mass Pike,"" chime along in mid-
    tempo delicacy like Jimmy Eat World's lily- white doily rock. The Get Up
    Kids make the predictable acquisition of piano, drum loops, and keyboards,
    too. Yet, none of it is done with any conviction and the frills just twinkle
    beneath layers of flat guitar and harmonizing yearning. But maybe the Get Up
    Kids know this. The ""thrilling"" packaging, with its taupe, burnt taupe, and
    mocha taupe color scheme, depicts a large husk of wheat, which pretty much
    sums it up-- delicately swaying weeds from the Midwest that are used as the
    most basic and bland sustenance.  You know, like Wonder Bread.</p></li></li></li></li></li></p></div>"|3431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3431-red-letter-day-ep/|5.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

I review one album for Pitchfork and suddenly I'm the resident
    expert on all things Swans. I don't dislike them, mind you, but it's not
    like they're my favoritest band in the world. It wouldn't be so bad if
    Michael Gira wasn't so damned prolific; we're going on two years since
    Swans actually broke up and they're still releasing albums-- no new
    material, mind you, just live recordings and re-releases of old albums.
    <em>Public Castration is a Good Idea</em> falls under both categories: a
    live album from 1986, being re-released on Thirsty Ear.</p><p>
    
    Four- and- a- half minutes of slow, relentless bashing opens <em>Public
    Castration</em>, which is a good way to prepare you for what lies ahead:
    sparse, gothic instrumentation, blunt- trauma percussion, and Gira's
    tortured moans. It's terribly bleak and repetitive, and easy to dismiss
    if you're not in the right mood. On the other hand, if you <i>are</i> in
    the right mood-- which would be utter disgust with yourself and everyone
    else in the world-- then lines like, ""I'm your stupid child/ I'm your stupid
    helpless child/ I'm your stupid naked child,"" become viciously effective.
    Lord knows what the Columbine killers would have done if they had listened
    to Swans. (Mmm... probably the same thing, come to think of it.)</p><p>
<em>Public Castration is a Good Idea</em> shows Swans in their most basic
    form, before Gira began tinkering and expanding their sound in the ensuing
    years. I personally prefer their early- to- mid '90s work, as this feels a
    bit too skeletal, but that's just me. Besides, there's no denying the
    intrinsic entertainment value of having a copy of <em>Public Castration is
    a Good Idea</em> around the house. The title alone is enough to freak out
    your parents and roommates; imagine what'll happen if you actually play
    it for them.</p></div>"|7641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7641-public-castration-is-a-good-idea/|6.0|Nick Mirov

    latest album, I felt a nearly overwhelming urge to lie down on my back in
    the middle of my dad's van and never get up.  I would have too, if I hadn't
    been driving on the highway at the moment.</p><p>
    
    The song that made me feel that way was ""I Feel Beautiful""; the
    circumstances involved too sordid and ridiculous to go into here.  But
    feel that way I did, and it cemented my feelings of love for <i>Jewels for
    Sophia</i>.  You think that's ass backward, I know, but my fascination for
    Robyn Hitchcock is based on this urge.  Ever since I first found my
    thirteen- year- old self lying in the middle of my living room floor
    listening to <i>I Often Dream of Trains</i>, I've based my ratings of
    various Hitchcock albums on how debilitating their melancholy is for me.
    It's like this: <i>Element of Light</i> makes me want to lie down on the
    floor during some of the songs and sit up during others; it's a really good
    Hitchcock album.  Respect makes me want to lie down for one or two songs
    and spend the other songs doing household chores; it's an okay Hitchcock
    album.  <i>Groovy Decoy</i> makes me want to run around the park; it sucks.</p><p>
    
    And <i>Jewels for Sophia</i> made me want to abandon the helm of a large
    and fast- moving vehicle and lie in the back, heedless of the twisted
    guardrails and smoke, and dirty looks from other motorists.  That's good
    Hitchcock.</p><p>
    
    ""Mexican God"" boots the record off with the satisfying click of a
    classic- Robyn- Hitchcock- song- shaped peg being snapped into a
    classic- Robyn- Hitchcock- song- shaped hole: acoustic strumming, jaunty
    drums, bloodthirsty deities-- three great tastes that taste great
    together.  ""The Cheese Alarm"" is a fantastic example of what I call the
    ""Hitchcock Switcheroo"":  a song that starts out sounding silly and winds
    up telling you more than you wanted to know about yourself.  ""NASA
    Clapping"" reunites Robyn with fellow former Soft Boy Kimberly Rew with
    surprisingly good results.  ""Antwoman"" finds its satisfying quirkiness
    not in its lyrics but in its background ""sighing machine"" and ""antvoices""
    (the latter provided by Grant Lee Phillips).</p><p>
    
    The two standout tracks, though, are a fleshed- out version of ""No, I
    Don't Remeber Guildford"" (originally released on last year's <i>Storefront
    Hitchcock</i>) and ""I Feel Beautiful""-- both of which find Hitchcock doing
    what he does most rarely and most brilliantly:  using his strangeness
    not as an end, but as a means to convey an emotional state.  Most
    importantly, <i>Jewels for Sophia</i> seems to find Robyn Hitchcock once
    again relaxing into the idea that, for better or for worse, he tends to
    write Robyn Hitchcock songs-- an idea he seems to have been resisting on
    the past few albums.  I'm glad for it, personally, even though it nearly
    killed me.</p></div>"|3888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3888-jewels-for-sophia/|8.9|Zach Hooker

Yay. After trying to meld their trademark lethargic
    lysergic pop with elements of trip-hop-- a notion which looked great on
    paper but resulted in 1997's bizarrely abysmal <em>Tragic Magic</em>-- Madder
    Rose return to form with <em>Hello June Fool</em>.  The album's not quite on
    par with 1994's <em>Panic On</em>, but it's a hopeful sign that the band's
    getting back on track.</p><p>
    
    For those of you just joining us, <em>Panic On</em> was one of a few great
    albums stuck in the mid-'90s post- alternative major- label netherworld:
    too slick and straightforward for the indie/ college crowd, and yet too
    edgy for the label push it into the mainstream consciousness. It's a shame,
    too, because <em>Panic On</em> had a real chance to break into the adult-
    alternative side of radio and still retain a reasonable amount of credibility--
    credibility which was more or less destroyed anyway once <em>Tragic Magic</em>,
    with its ponderously generic beats and lack of songwriting focus, came out.</p><p>
    
    But that was then, and this is now.  And <em>Hello June Fool</em> sounds as
    if Madder Rose has realized their mistakes and retreated to more familiar
    territory, both musically and geographically (the Thirsty Ear labe is, like
    the band, based out of New York). On tracks like ""Feels Like Summer,"" ""Talking
    to Myself,"" and the album's title track, it's like the last five years never
    happened; the warm narcotic haze of the guitars envelops you like an old
    blanket, but Mary Lorson's vocals, still cold as ice- nine, keep you from
    passing out completely.</p><p>
    
    The keyboards and sampled beats of <em>Tragic
    Magic</em> linger, but they're more judiciously deployed. ""Something"" rips
    off the groove from the Stone Roses' ""Fool's Gold,"" but makes up for it
    with its killer chorus; ""Train"" welds bluesy riff fragments onto a dubby
    rhythm, and lets Lorson's double- tracked vocals slither all over
    everything. It's good to see that Madder Rose's sultry sonic soma is
    still available without a prescription; better still that they've taken a
    slightly more conservative approach to expanding their sound. Maybe on
    their next album they'll be able to make the trip-hop thing work.</p></div>"|5028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5028-hello-june-fool/|7.1|Nick Mirov

    <i>Apollo 18</i>.  In retrospect, it wasn't their most shining moment,
    but at the time, it was the perfect blend of dark satire and catchy,
    quirky pop.  Ah, there's that word.  ""Quirky.""  Diehard fans of this
    New Jersey/ New York-based duo complain that there's not a review of
    a They Might Be Giants album in existence without mention of the term.
    But y'know what?  They're quirky.  Sorry.</p><p>
    I went into this one braced for horror.  I mean, over the course of
    this decade, the band has become progressively less listenable, especially
    since abandoning their MIDI sequencers and keyboards for a live band setup.
    But even at this very moment, I sit listening, stunned.  While these guys
    never let their irresistible pop hooks leave their sides (even on their
    last studio album, 1997's <i>Factory Showroom</i>, songs like ""Till
    My Head Falls Off"" and ""How Can I Sing Like a Girl"" got in your head
    and stuck like flypaper), the songs have lost some of the charm in
    favor of the attempted comeback single.  The band's energy level seemed
    to be steadily dissipating.  They quit experimenting with genres, and
    worse, their mix of morbid lyrics with head-bobbing pop melodies were
    nowhere in sight.</p><p>
<i>Long Tall Weekend</i> is set to be released strictly via MP3 by
    EMusic.com on July 19.  It seems likely that these guys felt they could
    goof around a bit more because, hypothetically, no one would be listening.
    (This, by the way, is completely not the case.  Just as Tori Amos and
    Morrissey still have massive rabid fanbases, They Might Be Giants fans
    will do anything they can to dig up unreleased tracks, be it in MP3 format
    or otherwise.)  But whereas this might make for an unfocused and careless
    record for other bands, They Might Be Giants are actually at their best
    when they're not really trying.
    </p><p>
    As it turns out, <i>Long Tall Weekend</i> is still not a stellar
    release, but is easily their best since <i>Apollo 18</i>.  It compiles
    a few songs that originally debuted on their Dial-A-Song line, along
    with studio versions of songs they've been performing in concert for
    years.  The album kicks off with the somewhat mediocre leadoff instrumental
    ""Drinkin',"" and is followed up the very average-- and depending on your
    mood, possibly annoying-- ""(She Thinks She's) Edith Head.""  But these two
    numbers have nothing on ""Maybe I Know,"" an incredibly poignant ballad whose
    helpless, succinct lyrics (""Maybe I know that she's been cheating/ Maybe I
    know that she's been untrue/ But what can I do"") are strikingly effective.
    </p><p>
    The brief ""Token Back to Brooklyn"" appears to be heavily influenced by
    Chicago post-rock auteurs Tortoise and the Sea and Cake with its artsy,
    vaguely electronic-sounding drum track.  ""Older"" is, contrary to possible
    belief, not a medley of the songs from George Michael's last album, but
    a classic They Might Be Giants clever (but depressing) ""mortality awareness""
    songs.  The lyrics say it all: ""You're older than you've ever been/ And
    now you're even older/ And now you're even older/ And now you're even
    older.""  Add in the memorable cartoony melody, written to emphasize
    every passing second, and bam!-- you've got a track that belongs on
    their self-titled debut or <i>Lincoln</i>.
    </p><p>
    ""Reprehensible"" could only be described as ""casual vaudeville.""  Were it
    not for the seriously wack lyrics, it'd fit nicely into an old Fred Astaire
    film.  ""They Got Lost"" has been a live staple for what seems like forever.
    The standard live version appeared on last year's compilation album,
    <i>Severe Tire Damage</i>.  This first-ever studio recording of the song
    is far more subdued than its rocking live counterpart, but the melody is
    so infectious, it could practically be a polka (an actual possibility with
    these two on the case) and it'd still be a prime cut.  ""Nina"" is entirely a
    capella and sung backwards for that whole ""Arm from 'Twin Peaks'"" feel.  And
    ""Edison Museum"" closes out the album, continuing their fascination with the
    famous institution, with accordions and harpsichords plinking the song's
    spooky tune.
    </p><p>
<i>Long Tall Weekend</i> has a few less- than- grand numbers, of course.
    The aforementioned ""(She Thinks She's) Edith Head,"" the dorky wordplay of
    ""Operators are Standing By,"" and the banjo-infested ""Counterfeit Faker""
    are accidents gone awry.  (You heard me.)  I guess that's the benefit of
    only purchasing certain songs.  But if you don't purchase them, does it
    mean they're not part of whole vision?  Indeed not, guys.  Call me an ass,
    but these tracks were recorded as part of the <i>Long Tall Weekend</i>
    album, and they detract from the overall quality.
    </p><p>
    That said, Flansburgh and Linnell, in a rare moment of glory, have returned
    to their roots to create their first truly enjoyable album of the decade.
    But don't count on this excellence to continue.  Like I said before, they're
    at their best when they're not trying.

    disappear. I lent it to a girl at work. I thought she'd like it. That's really what started
    the whole thing.  She held on to it for a few days. I dropped by from time to time, managing
    to sneak in a track here or there. (""Boy! That 'You Win' track sure is great!  And  'The Escape""
    is great, too!"")  This eventually ended when I plunked myself down in her room, ready for more
    Lilys, and was rudely awakened by a bit of the Beatles' <i>White Album</i> (which I didn't
    really mind... but where was my CD??)  She said that the graphics department took it. Hmm...</p><p>
     
    The graphics department was on the fourth track when I reached them. They had the best set of
    speakers in the office, so I decided that perhaps this was as good a place as any to leave the
    album for the time being. I grabbed a V8 from the fridge and tilted back in a chair facing away
    from the sound. Sun from the window warmed the side of my face. For the next fifteen minutes I
    felt as if my brain was made of helium. Then I went back to work in my office.</p><p>
     
    Meanwhile, the album continued to make its way around work. Marketing seemed to like ""Back
    Again."" The Co-Presidents enjoyed ""The Law.""  As soon as anyone would hear ten seconds of the
    album, they'd immediately ask who it was and if they could borrow it. I finally had to steal 
    it from the receptionist's desk while she was on her lunch break. By this time, the jewel case
    was cracked and the booklet was missing.  I quickly went home to listen without any interruptions.</p><p>
     
    If you're not a fan of the Lilys, the Kinks or My Bloody Valentine, realize that this is nothing
    like that stuff.  It's a total departure from what Kurt Heasley has been doing of late (unless
    he's been doing this at home without us knowing, along with some macrame). Archie Moore (from
    Velocity Girl in the past and the Heartworms in the present) joins Heasley on this EP along
    with Trevor Kampman, known in pop circles merely as Holland.</p><p>
     
    Supposedly, this is what Kraftwerk and other Kraut-rock bands sounded like. I personally have
    never thought of them as being this lush and gurgling. <i>Zero Population Growth</i> is like
    syrup being poured from one of those fish- shaped pitchers. It's like diving into a swimming
    pool filled with new crispy M&amp;M;'s. So trust me-- you'll like it. It's one of those records that
    will stand out in your collection. One of those records that when you have to hear it, you 
    <i>have</i> to hear it. Just don't let anyone in your office borrow it.</p></div>"|4794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4794-zero-population-growth-ep-bliss-out-v15/|8.9|Chip Chanko

    proclaims.  ""They're the real deal.""  This is followed by some gibberish
    about how you'll think you're listening to some lost George Jones or
    Johnny Cash album, and some further hooey about how My Morning Jacket
    don't know anything about the ""indie"" scene, and don't care for what
    they do know.</p><p>
    
    Bullocks.  The truth of the matter is that you're not going to be
    hearing any of this stuff on your local Country and Western station.  If
    you hear it on the radio at all, it's gonna be on some little college
    station.  Y'know why?  'Cause it owes a lot more to that indie scene than
    Darla lets on.  Yeah, the country force is strong with these guys.
    Sure, their country sound is not typical alt-posturing.  And it's true
    that there's no irony in sight.  But listening to <i>The Tennessee Fire</i>,
    you'll never be convinced that you're hearing anything other than what it
    is: country- influenced indie rock by four kids from Kentucky.  There. 
    Nothing to be ashamed of.</p><p>
    
    Here's something that might tip you off to the fact that this is not classic
    country: big, loud, echoing drums, song titles like ""Evelyn is Not Real"" and
    ""I Will Be There When You Die,"" twelve feet of reverb on every last sound,
    and singer Jim James' vocal stylings, which often sound remarkably like
    another southern indie-rocker-- the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne.  If you
    spring for a vinyl copy of the album (and you should), you'll be treated to
    an extra 7"" worth of mournful, simply- strummed songs laid over what sounds
    like some early Meat Beat Manifesto drum programming.  It's good stuff, but
    of course, it's hardly George Jones.</p><p>
    
    Still, the country vibe is undeniable.  This may be the most lonesome
    record I've heard this year, with the aforementioned reverb making it
    sound like it was recorded in the dead of night at the back of a concrete
    drainage culvert, kudzu growing on the amps, major sevenths littering the
    ground like cigarette butts.  These kids can harmonize, too, a talent that
    most alt-country bands are sadly lacking-- the album's highlight, the
    ghostly ""They Ran,"" features some background ooh's and ahh's that'll make
    you think your hi-fi's haunted-- not by Hank Williams Sr., but by the
    memory of some foggy morning outside of Nashville, driving home to Colorado
    from Atlanta, broke and nearly out of gas, when you realized something had
    changed irrevocably and for the worse.  Not bad for a song that's ostensibly
    about somebody stealing the singer's lighter.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, the sooner you let go of Darla's press kit mumbo- jumbo, the
    sooner you can relax and enjoy an excellent album.  Because, as with any
    other worthwhile band, country or otherwise, what makes <i>The Tennessee
    Fire</i> so great is not My Morning Jacket's ""sound,"" but their songs.</p></div>"|5529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5529-the-tennessee-fire/|8.0|Zach Hooker

The flashing lights, the scent of sweat
    and marijuana, the pounding, pounding music, the endless dancing and sniffing
    of Vicks Inhalers. Weekends with my old rave buddy Steaky were both incredible
    and punishing, often beginning Thursday night and ending Sunday morning, fueled
    by drugs and an endless stream of parties. It was both fun and lonely, Steaky
    looking into the distance as she ruminated endlessly in a coke or crystal-
    driven rant on the various DJs she'd seen or heard, her eyes flickering back
    and forth like candles in a light breeze. One such DJ that she would speak about
    all too often was Josh Wink.</p><p>
    
    I think Josh held a special power for Steaky. First of all, it was obvious
    she was wet for him. Whenever she'd start talking about him, she'd talk
    about his dreads, and how she'd seen him at Evolution, but that he DJ'd
    there on Wednesdays and she couldn't make the drive from Steaky Central to
    Philadelphia in mid- week. Steaky had a highbrow corporate job that she was
    desperate to hold down in the four- day spells between drug binges. It made
    her sad that she was kept from Josh by something as trivial as a job with a
    corporate giant, and I could see the idealism and materialism doing battle
    in her eyes when she spoke of it. She wanted Josh, and, with him would come
    the redemption of her plastic raver soul.</p><p>
    
    It never came, and Steaky disappeared from my life, leaving me to wonder
    about her again. Then, just as I prepared to delete her forever from the
    memory banks, Wink's <i>Profound Sounds Vol. 1</i> falls into my lap.
    Ostensibly the first in what is sure to be lauded as the ""last word"" in
    techno series', Josh proves to us that even if <i>Herehear</i> sucked, he can
    still spin with the best of 'em. I can feel Steaky's panties moistening right
    now... out there... somewhere.</p><p>
    
    As you may recall, MTV's first <i>Amp</i> compilation from 1997 included Wink's
    almost- mainstream breakout ""Are You There.""  After its success, many
    Philadelphians were asking, ""May I have cheez whiz on that delicious Philly
    cheesesteak?"" and ""Could our beloved DJ Josh Wink have a shot at breaking out,
    making it to Chemical Brothers and Prodigy status?"" Well, the short answer was
    no. <i>Herehear</i> fell flat, surely prompting a sigh of relief from Steaky,
    knowing that her star-cross'd lover may still be within her reach.</p><p>
    
    So, now we have <i>Profound Sounds, Vol. 1</i>. A continuous remix from start
    to finish (as all good discs are), <i>Profound Sounds</i> displays a Josh that
    is both patient and clever on the production board. Running well over an hour,
    the record spans acid house, dub- techno and hard house, the mix becoming
    gradually harder and more intense the longer it plays on. Josh teases, he
    plays, he gently flitters our ariolas with the tongue of his turntables,
    starting the mix with some moderately hard tracks like labelmates Sylk 130's
    ""When the Funk Hits the Fan"" and Care Company's ""Vol. 1"". But the real meat
    on <i>Profound Sounds</i> is to be found from tracks 6 through 14, when Josh
    takes us on a hard- house journey that, well... is even moistening <i>my</i>
    panties a bit.  Call me old-skool, call me Shirley, or all me Al, but this
    is good stuff that swallows your brain up with rhythms falling over one
    another in a cascade appropriate for both booty shakin' and abstract chillin'.</p><p>
    
    My conclusion: Josh has proven himself a top- notch DJ, but like fellow DJs
    Kruder and Dorfmeister, his own songs leave something to be desired. Of
    course, that's okay-- <i>Profound Sounds</i> makes the cut and keeps me
    squiggly... oh so squiggly.</p></div>"|8705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8705-profound-sounds-vol-1/|6.9|James P. Wisdom

No, this is
    not a cover of John Lennon's 1971 (Johnson &amp; Johnson lotion ad) classic.
    And it's a good thing, because while Frost would do an excellent cover
    of that <i>Plastic Ono Band</i> gem, her song is much more refreshing.</p><p>
    
    Last year's <i>Telescopic</i> only further proved Frost as one of the
    greatest female songwriters of the decade.  Songs like the album's intense
    opener, ""Walk On the Fire,"" the beautiful ""Tender Kiss"" and the haunting
    ""You Belong to No One"" displayed her talent for writing stunningly succinct
    lyrics and undeniable musical prowess.</p><p>
    
    Frost also has a knack for enlisting the help of Chicago's musical elite
    for her records.  Her full- length debut, <i>Calling Over Time</i>, featured
    the talents of Gastr Del Sol's Jim O'Rourke and David Grubbs, and Sean O'Hagan of Stereolab and the High
    Llamas.  <i>Telescopic</i> boasted production by Royal Trux's Neil Haggerty
    and Jennifer Herrema (mysteriously credited as ""Adam and Eve"").  Now, on
    <i>Love is Real</i>, her three- song snack between albums, she's brought
    along the Sea and Cake's Archer Prewitt, Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo,
    and Sam Prekop on cover art.  (Let's talk for a second about Prekop's art,
    by the way.  The guy's fuckin' awesome.  'Nuff said.)</p><p>
    
    The title cut off the new EP is Edith Frost at her finest.  Her straight-
    forward and earnest lyrics have only improved since <i>Calling Over Time</i>.
    She now throws out stunningly succinct lines like ""Wonder what you're doing
    now/ Listen for your telephone call/ Nothing to talk about/ Make up any
    reason to stall"" so casually that it seems like her second nature.  Frost's
    vocals have also become increasingly controlled-- she's become capable of
    delivering lines like ""Is there anything at all to talk about/ My love is
    real,"" implying incredible yearning while retaining her dignity.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the most impressive gift Frost has to offer is that she's able to
    say so much with so few words.  ""Between Us"" is a sparse love song about
    drinking with a fellow musician that serves as a fine example of Frost
    being melancholy sans- cheese.  ""The Last One"" is an unexpected slice of
    traditional country from Frost who rarely strays far from her folk-pop
    roots.  Accompanied solely by an acoustic guitar, she executes like it's
    the only genre she's ever known.  Musically, the track is on par with more
    upbeat Gillian Welch numbers, but doesn't seem to connect lyrically.</p><p>
<i>Love is Real</i> should tide us over until her forthcoming album is
    released, if only because the title track is one of Edith Frost's best
    works to date.  And judging from the sound of this EP, it just gets better
    from here.  The next album's her <i>Plastic Ono Band</i>.</p></div>"|3224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3224-love-is-real-ep/|7.7|Ryan Schreiber

    <i>Holdypaws</i> is probably a better place for the newcomer to start. Where the band's
    debut alternated actual melodies with meandering bits of downtown-style guitar noise,
    everything on here could easily be classified as a ""song."" While this isn't a bad thing
    in itself, this stab at tunefulness is ultimately too straight an approach for a band
    this weird, and it doesn't quite seem to fit into Deerhoof's larger scheme.</p><p>
    
    Musically, the Deerhoof of <i>Holdypaws</i> sounds very much like a less-refined Blonde
    Redhead. This development represents a steady progression toward relative normality from
    Deerhoof's debut, a double 7"" on Menlo Park that contained no singing at all. Come to
    think of it, that early single barely had any bass or drums on it either; as I recall,
    it consisted of a few sporadic blasts of guitar distortion in between vinyl pops and
    crackles. (Needless to say, I don't pull that single out very often.)</p><p>
    
    But back to <i>Holdypaws</i>-- one reason this album doesn't work as well for me is that
    I'm beginning to see lead- screecher Satomi's limitations as a vocalist. Hearing her
    high-pitched, artless wailing every second or third song on the last album seemed about
    perfect; here it pops up on every track. So, while this song-oriented approach will
    initiate the timid into Deerhoof's strange world, I'm less inclined to stick around
    for the entire ride.</p><p>
    
    A word or two about that strange world, by the way.  Deerhoof's songs universally portray
    a surreal, nightmarish place seen through the eyes of a child, as if Glenn Branca composed
    a soundtrack to ""Where the Wild Things Are.""  Songs like ""Queen of the Lake,"" ""The Moose's
    Daughter"" and ""Crow"" describe an interior landscape populated by shadowy, half-beast mutants,
    which are all given voice by Satomi. There are no songs about ""relationships"" or anything
    else vaguely connected to the sane world's agreement about what constitutes reality; this
    is the stuff of dreams, and as such, they are effectively creepy and strange. But music
    with subject matter this abstract cries out for instrumental interludes and textures, brief
    soundtracks to help transport us from place to place. <i>Holdypaws</i> only provides us with
    some decent tunes.</p></div>"|2251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2251-holdypaws/|5.7|Mark Richard-San

    trails backwards for most of the decade with Palace's various incarnations.  His major
    accomplishment has been making music that is at once faithfully traditional and cutting edge.
    Similarly, Appendix Out's folk, often no more than lead vocalist Ali Roberts' fragile vocals
    over a gently picked acoustic, remains true to its source while turning over enough fences to
    keep things interesting, though it seems to favor Nick Drake to Oldham's Neil Young.</p><p>
    
    Roberts' vocals provide the ingenuity here, wavering wraithlike over the off- kilter
    procession, barely failing to cloak the inherent charms of the songs.  This is an intensely
    quiet album.  Tracks move in and out of consciousness, sometimes content as background, and
    at others, seizing attention at will.  Songs like ""Tangled Hair"" and ""Merchant City"" follow
    such patterns, while ""Foundling"" and ""Little Owl"" take a more direct route to one's mind.
    Drawing from sources as distant as Belle and Sebastian, Oldham, Young and even the likes of
    Jerry Garcia, Appendix Out deliver subtle and plaintive beauty consistently throughout the
    album.  Flutes and Kate Wright's ephemeral backing vocals provide the necessary flourishes
    to a simple yet brilliant work.</p><p>
    
    In the five- disc changer that sits in my apartment, <i>Daylight Saving</i> is followed by
    Dylan and the Band's <i>Basement Tapes</i>.  And as I finish off the former's review, the
    latter's first notes play appropriately.  Will Oldham has made a career of preserving the
    folk underworld championed by Dylan and Robbie Robertson, but Appendix Out attests to its
    universality.</p></div>"|246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/246-daylight-saving/|8.4|Neil Lieberman

    Block recorded an album with They Might Be Giants? No? That's probably a
    good thing, because then I'd really have to wonder about you. Not like
    this description of Self is all that accurate, but just listen to ""Meg
    Ryan"" off <i>Breakfast with Girls</i> and tell me if it doesn't make at
    least a whit of sense. Within the context of the whacked- out samples
    flowing through the song, those <i>Hangin' Tough</i> beats and half- R&amp;B-;
    smoove/ half- whiteboy- whine vocals actually sound compelling, if still
    a bit cheesy. Even if you didn't know that Self is the product of a
    singular genius by the name of Matt Mahaffey, you'd still swear it was
    almost... Beck-like.</p><p>
    
    But since the position of ""the American Beck"" has already been filled by,
    well... Beck, I guess Self will have to settle for being known as ""the
    American Momus."" The persona Mahaffey has constructed for himself is that
    of an old- school, Serge Gainsbourg- style pop star: cocky, witty,
    occasionally vulgar, and endlessly charming. <i>Breakfast with Girls</i>
    strikes an almost scientific balance between starry- eyed innocence and
    jaded decadence; Mahaffey may not be the coolest kid in school, but he
    still dreams of a life of jet- setting, celebrity- schmoozing leisure far
    away from his Tennessee digs.</p><p>
    
    While that's all well and good, the actual music on <i>Breakfast with
    Girls</i> is a slightly different matter. Self's songwriting philosophy
    mirrors his penchant for goofy studio noisemaking; his off- kilter chord
    progressions are often more interesting than enjoyable, and his
    compositions are crammed to capacity with ideas that sometimes don't work
    so well with each other. Of course, some parts of the album do work really
    well: ""It All Comes Out in the Wash"" has a dumb, stomping guitar riff with
    a sneaky little hip-hop bounce to it that makes you want to bang your head
    and throw your set in the air at the same time; ""Breakfast with the Girls""
    is a woozy trip-hop shuffle with a cheeky R&amp;B-; vocal breakdown; ""Sucker""
    sounds like Soul Coughing remixing intermission music (decide for yourself
    whether that's a good or bad thing).</p><p>
<i>Breakfast with Girls</i> walks a very fine line with its intentionally
    cheesy production; when it doesn't quite work, like on the harpsichord-
    heavy ""Uno Song,"" the results can be pretty cringe- inducing. Mahaffey
    has a tendency to cram too many ideas into songs that don't work so well
    together, turning songs like ""What Are You Thinking?"" into an exercise in
    channel- surfing. Bottom line? Self has some good songwriting chops, but
    they have yet to catch up with his artistic vision and studio skills.</p></div>"|7068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7068-breakfast-with-girls/|6.5|Nick Mirov

    decisions. I tell you a new album is great, you buy it, you dig it, you 
    say, ""What should I buy next?"" Well, buy <i>Black Foliage</i> next-- you'll
    love it. You'll get insanely catchy '60s- inspired pop music in addition to 
    sound collages, field recordings, drony ambience, cathartic noise, and 
    outlandish production that makes Phil Spector's ""Wall of Sound"" look like 
    a cubicle divider. You'll get an exceedingly long album that's high on 
    concept and low on tedium. You'll get a lot for your $15. So buy it,
    already!  It really is a fine, fine piece of work-- better even than
    the band's strong debut, <i>Dusk At Cubist Castle</i>. Trust me.</p><p>
    
    So, now that you own <i>Black Foliage</i>, let's talk about what you can
    do to maximize your enjoyment of it. The first thing you'll need is a box
    of Q-tips. In order for your ears to have a chance at capturing the 
    32,486,978 distinct sounds that collectively make up <i>Black Foliage</i>, 
    you'll want those canals to be whistle clean. The next question is:
    headphones or hi-fi? It should be noted that, at times, the sonic ambitions 
    of the Olivia Tremor Control exceed the ability of their recording 
    equipment to capture it. The end result of this is that parts of <i>Black 
    Foliage</i> can sound just a bit muddy in your average listening environment, 
    where microscopic sonic details can easily disappear into those ferns 
    hanging in the corners. Headphones alleviate this problem and bring a 
    mind- boggling amount of aural nuance to the fore, but they are far from 
    ideal if the album is listened to in a social setting.</p><p>
    
    So, you're settled in and your ears are open, and now you want to know 
    exactly what to listen for. It's not easy to say, as there will be as 
    many approaches to this record as there are listeners. The band's real
    talent, like that of the late- '60s- era Beatles, is in combining
    accessible pop with more experimental elements and making them work
    together perfectly. Only the Flaming Lips are making comparable strides
    at bridging the ""catchy vs. avant garde"" gap within a single piece of
    work. While the Olivia Tremor Control is wildly successful in that
    respect on <i>Black Foliage</i>, it's possible that some will be turned
    off by either the syrupy- sweet melody of ""Hideaway"" or the quick- cutting 
    tape collage of ""The Boat Below It,"" depending on which end of this 
    continuum you're coming from. The key factor in the synthesis is that the 
    Olivia Tremor Control are head over heels in love with sound-- it shows 
    in every saturated inch of their master tapes. And sound certainly takes 
    precedence over lyrics, to the degree that you remember the melodies and 
    textures much more than the words, which are really just one component of 
    the whole.</p><p>
    
    In the case of <i>Black Foliage</i>, that whole is a complex, ear- pleasing 
    conundrum, from the opening organ chords of ""Opening"" to the final chorus 
    of ""Hilltop Procession,"" whose fade- out makes you sad that the lengthy 
    album is over. Part of the album's puzzle- like nature comes from the 
    constant references to other songs-- both Olivia Tremor Control works and
    other band's songs. The album's theme, ""Black Foliage,"" appears in four
    very different versions, one for each side of the double album, and is
    alluded to again in the sound collages. The song title ""California Demise""
    comes from the band's rare 7"" EP debut of the same name. References to
    <i>Dusk At Cubist Castle</i> are also made, hidden bits of one song are in
    another, and the occasional musical quote, such as the vocal break lifted
    from ""God Only Knows"" for ""The Silvan Screen,"" all add to the fun.</p><p>
    
    The overall concept is also cryptic but worth trying to fathom. I've only 
    listened to the album 15 or so times, not the 50 that Olivia Tremor Control
    co- frontman Bill Doss says is required to decipher it, so I can't help you
    there. If I had to guess, I'd say that the album is really about listening,
    <i>really</i> listening to what's going on around you and realizing that
    sounds are music and music are sounds. Or, to paraphrase John Cage's famous 
    question, ""Are sounds just sounds or are they the Olivia Tremor Control?""</p></div>"|5982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5982-black-foliage-animation-music-vol-1/|9.1|Mark Richard-San

The strides made in
    instrumental hip-hop over the past few years have far outstripped the
    gains created by the MCs, the most famous of which are coasting easily on
    well- established clich√©s. To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson (forgive the
    pretension, and also my theft of this analogy from my good friend Samir),
    ""You can't have great rappers without great audiences."" As long as the
    nation continues to line the pockets of those pontificating from one side
    of the ""playa"" debate, we can expect the lyrical assault to remain forever
    mediocre. Maybe we've come to expect too much-- after all, nobody requires
    rock lyricists to continually evolve. But rap comes from the hip-hop cultural
    tradition, where you either innovate or die, and few of the microphone
    styles circulating today deserve to survive natural selection.</p><p>
    Attempting to change that is the Quannum crew, a collective of Bay Area
    hip-hop heads who met and began collaborating in the '80s in and around the
    campus of UC Davis.  DJ Shadow is the band's key to success, and also the
    only straight producer of the bunch-- the rest are comprised primarily of
    the MCs from Latyrx and Blackalicious, in addition to vocalist Joya Velarde.
    The Jurassic 5, though from Los Angeles, have a close relationship to this
    crew, forged with a shared aesthetic and high- minded ideals about the next
    phase in hip-hop music. Quannum's <i>Spectrum</i> functions as a sort of
    introduction to the collective-- a label sampler of sorts for their new
    Quannum imprint.</p><p>
    As Shadow's already well established outside of the group, his contributions
    here are understated. He created the music for four of the tracks, but as
    anyone who has heard the Latyrx album can attest, Shadow likes to keep his
    backing tracks simple, tight, unobtrusive and easy to rap over. He reins in
    the high- drama and sampler virtuosity of his solo work, but the tunes are
    uniformly funky and serviceable.</p><p>
    Those familiar with the Jurassic 5's quickly acknowledged classic EP
    will love the first tune here, a freewheeling jam with Jurassic and all the
    Quannum MCs based on the children's song ""Concentration."" Despite production
    by Lyrics Born of Latyrx, it maintains that trademark Jurrasic 5 schoolyard
    spirit.  But if ""Concentration"" is the best song here, it's by no means the
    only great one.</p><p>
    The rest of <i>Spectrum</i>'s tracks intertwine sampled '80s R&amp;B; riffs
    (Verlarde's ""People Like Me""), updated old- skool lyrical trade- offs (""The
    Extravaganza"" with the Quannum MCs and Souls of Mischief), and deep semantic
    intelligence. A true all- star game of West Coast underground hip-hop,
    <i>Spectrum</i> is supremely satisfying when you think about where rap is at
    the moment, and only disappoints when you think about where it could be.</p></div>"|6621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6621-spectrum/|7.5|Mark Richard-San

    compilation records are a lot like hardline, extremist, balls- to- the- walls
    communism."" Think about it. Both eventually lead to mile- long lines for toilet
    paper that's rougher than cheap beef jerky, both result in state- owned methods of
    mass production, and both can cause children to roam shoeless through empty, dismal 
    streets in search of a dirty shirt to eat.</p><p>
    
    Still, communism and compilation albums
    aren't all fun and sun. They both have a serious downside, namely that they're both
    good ideas that get completely fucked up when attempted in real life. In theory,
    what could be better than a rockin' compilation album?  I mean, you've got 15 or
    20 bands, all on one record, coming together in the common cause of making dope-
    ass music. You get all new music, unreleased songs from bands you dig and bands
    that are just like the bands you dig. This should be an easy one, right?  These
    are the albums you should steal if you can't buy 'em, right?</p><p>
    
    Uh... that's what you think until you actually lay down $20 for <i>Bootyshakers
    '99: Da Gold Card Playas Edition</i> and realize what a fucking crock these albums
    are. Instead of working in universal unity like the musical lovefests they're all
    hyped to be, the albums actually become the dumping grounds for every half- assed
    track and retarded b-side a band has laying around the studio.  Really- no band
    wants to be associated with them.  They just go into a rented studio, sing their
    song with the enthusiasm of a lazy hooker, eat from the catering wagon, collect
    their checks, and go home.  In the meantime, the fat, greasy men at the record
    company use the profits from the album to push another boy band along the path
    to pre-pubescent glory and massive drug addiction.  In a sentence: compilation
    albums are the work of the devil.</p><p>
    
    Then along comes a new compilation album, sauntering out of the west like a
    mysterious stranger bearing no name-- a compilation album that helps a brother to
    keep faith in the record biz. <i>Oh, Merge</i> is an example of what a compilation
    album would be a perfect world: 19 straight- from- the- gut songs made by some of
    the best bands under Mac McCaughan's wiry wing.</p><p>
    
    Featuring such underground music machines as Superchunk, Rocket From the Crypt,
    Neutral Milk Hotel, and the Magnetic Fields (as well as lesser known bands like
    Guv'ner, the Rock*A*Teens and Lambchop), <i>Oh, Merge</i> offers its eager listener
    the whole rainbow of the current underground scene, from fast neo-punk to soft
    soundscape fuzziness.</p><p>
    
    Yet, with all this to love, the record also has its down sides.  Merge does little
    to stray from the unwritten comp album rule that the comp can't be packed wall- to-
    wall with stellar material.  Nope, <i>Oh, Merge</i> is quite varied in terms of
    quality. With 19 bands touching on around 30 genres, not everything is going to be
    brilliant.  However, the album's highlights are some of the best tracks in recent
    rock.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the bad tracks suck pretty hard, and listening to them is about as pleasant
    as shoving a cold soupspoon up your ass-- luckily such tracks are few and far between.
    Even with all the killer music, the best thing that can be said about this album is that
    the people on this record actually give a shit about what they're doing, which is pretty
    uncommon in a world where Wolfie actually has a fanbase.  It would be almost heartwarming
    if I didn't know that <i>Bootyshakers 2000</i> is less than a month away. But hell, if the
    boys and girls (read: adults) at Merge did this well with a compilation album, maybe we
    should have them give that whole communism thing a shot as well. With a bunch of talented,
    slacker indie kids in charge of the Marxist party, I'm sure we could have food riots started
    in no time.</p></div>"|1929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1929-oh-merge-10-year-anniversary-compilation/|6.9|Steven Byrd

    Calculator</i>, I lazily referred to her ""female Cornelius."" Seeing
    how I was under a tight deadline at the time, this comparison adequately
    conveyed to the Pitchfork audience that Minekawa was all about classic
    pop, and that she had the multi- instrumental and arrangement chops to
    realize her syrupy- sweet musical dreams. Imagine my surprise when I
    read in <i>Giant Robot</i> that Minekawa is not only going steady with
    Cornelius, but that she would be writing and recording with him for her
    next record. Man, I love being right, especially when I don't have to
    work hard to do it.</p><p>
    
    And so it seems, with her new beau at her side, the already talented
    Minekawa can't be stopped. This record easily surpasses everything else
    she's done, with newfound production sophistication and better songs to
    boot. Gone are those grating moments of excessive twee; instead, our ears
    are treated to extended passages of warm musical bliss, where modern
    technology is gracefully deployed in the service of the pop song.</p><p>
    
    See, this is where Minekawa and her Japanese ilk have a real leg up on
    the American indie pop crowd: Elephant 6'ers know a thing or two about
    melody, but their deep block on all post- Kraftwerk musical developments
    continues to disappoint. Those neo- hippies can be as narrow- minded as
    your average beer- swilling mullethead: ""Where are the fucking guitars?""
    is always the dismal refrain. Artists like Minekawa and Cornelius realize
    that a drum machine, when used correctly, has more soul than Ringo Starr
    and Charlie Watts combined. It's the <i>ideas</i> that matter, not the
    alleged ""purity"" of the delivery. And Takako Minekawa has musical ideas
    to burn.</p><p>
    
    The fuel on <i>Fun9</i> (pronounced ""funk,"" mysteriously) is provided by
    a breadth of influences that somehow blend into a singular sound. The
    opener, ""Gently Waves,"" showcases Minekawa's dreamy voice, multi- tracked
    into a five- part Wilsonian symphony. ""Plash"" (one of the four Cornelius
    collaborations) effectively combines a Brazilian acoustic guitar shuffle
    with choppy beats. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" is one of three tracks featuring
    the sampling artistry of DJ Me DJ You, featuring a great vocal riff
    shamelessly lifted from Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side.""</p><p>
    
    Though all the melodies on <i>Fun9</i> are strong, a few songs prominently
    feature a more complex electronic ambiance. ""Flash"" (also featuring
    contributions from Cornelius) shows that Minekawa listened carefully to
    Oval's deconstruction of ""International Velvet"" on her remix album: the
    distorted, distant sound of her vocal transmission undercuts the loping
    Hawaiian feel of the background music to sublime effect. And ""Fancy Work
    Funk"" features a trance- inducing Moog pattern that would do the German
    electronic crowd proud.  With or without her main squeeze, Minekawa has
    got vision.</p></div>"|5301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5301-fun9/|8.3|Mark Richard-San

    that it's kinda hard to keep up with 'em.  They don't have U.S.
    offices, as far as I know, so their stuff is released over here
    primarily by indie labels.  Matador's pushing the majority of
    Warp releases-- they've got Red Snapper, Two Lone Swordsmen,
    Boards of Canada and a bunch of others; Trent Reznor's Nothing
    imprint issues the better known stuff like Squarepusher, Plaid,
    and these guys, Autechre.</p><p>
    
    Autechre have, over the past few years, become one of the best-
    loved acts on the Warp roster, and with good reason.  Their sound
    is distinctly their own-- they generate the weirdest noises they
    can extract from their various pieces of analog and digital equipment,
    and turn it into a mindfuck of skittering madness.</p><p>
    
    Last year's full- length, <i>LP5</i>, was one of their most
    diverse and innovative works to date.  The majority of its
    tracks seemed to start with minimalist percussion, and gradually
    build on the rhythm by dropping in more noises until the songs
    became complex works of sonic terrorism.  But we're not so lucky
    this time around.  <i>EP7</i>'s tracks start out complex and kind
    of meander for a few minutes before blending seamlessly into the
    next number.  (It should also be noted that while I believe the band
    classifies <i>EP7</i> as an EP release, it is, in actuality, another
    full- length album.  Here, we're presented with 11 new songs and
    over 60 minutes of new music.)</p><p>
    
    The problem with <i>EP7</i> lies with its lack of diversity.
    These songs all sound reasonably similar, offering very little
    in the way of originality.  It's hard to differentiate between
    the tracks, and after 20 minutes, it even begins to grate.  On
    <i>LP5</i>, the songs were their own distinct entities, with
    each cut bringing something new to the table.  <i>EP7</i> just
    seems to wander around aimlessly, alternating between prime
    Autechre cuts and uninspired filler.</p><p>
    
    ""Ccec"" adds a layer of chopped up, unintellegable rap lyrics
    to their usual mix; ""Liccflii"" presents a barage of speedy,
    cut-up beats and an array of musical plings and plangs; ""Maphive
    6.1"" is an eight minute long epic, and perhaps one of <i>EP7</i>'s
    most compelling cuts, offering what sounds like an Aphex'd timpani
    and toy piano; and ""Pir,"" the album's closing track, brings us a
    gorgeous ambient melody over-- you guessed it-- standard fucked-up
    Autechre percussion.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, the guys seem uninterested for much of the rest of the
    record.  Perhaps they realize they've become one of Warp's
    most revered assets and can therefore spend most of their
    studio time slacking while still receiving tons of critical
    acclaim and watching their album sales skyrocket.  Whatever
    the case, <i>EP7</i> isn't their most shining hour.  If you
    want the good stuff, reach for their earlier work.</p></div>"|363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/363-ep7/|5.7|Ryan Schreiber

    without all the tape loops, ear- splitting amplification, and confounding
    network of effects gadgets. On second thought, maybe that's a stupid
    comparison. The photograph on the cover of <i>England Made Me</i>-- the
    young girl, sitting up in bed under the covers, looking bored and morbidly
    introspective-- tells you most everything you need to know about this
    unhappy English pop band fronted by the Auteurs' Luke Haines.</p><p>
    
    And, of course, there's the obvious tragic connotations of the moniker Black
    Box Recorder. The band is named, as I'm sure you're all well aware, after a
    recording device that captures the final moments of an ill- fated airplane
    and its crew. We eventually learn, that to the societal malcontents in
    Black Box Recorder, life is basically an airplane spinning out of control,
    spiraling toward the ground, and meeting its end in flaming catastrophe.
    And <i>England Made Me</i> is their own personal black box recording, in a
    sense. I mean, what else can they do but record the last desperate cries of
    their tormented lives before they, too, in the Year 2000, crash and burn out
    like everyone and everything else.</p><p>
    
    But while they're still stuck here in this meaningless void known as modern life,
    I guess the band figured, ""Aw, what the heck.  We may as well sign with a hip label
    and make an album that examines the ontological riddles which complicated our
    respective childhoods and rendered our subsequent adult lives deeply confusing
    and unsatisfying."" <i>England Made Me</i> is also an anti- tribute to the shame,
    horror and general degradation that must naturally come with being born and raised
    in post- Restoration England.</p><p>
    
    But is this album good, you ask? Well, it isn't bad.  In fact, it starts out
    with the immaculate ""Girl Singing in the Wreckage,"" on which vocalist Sarah
    Nixey sweetly croons, ""My 18th birthday I'll die of boredom/ My private world is
    smashed wide open."" Then we have the undeniably pristine, haunting melodies of
    the excellent title track. ""It's Only the End of the World"" epitomizes the twenty-
    something detachment and their going- through- the- motions view of life at
    century's end. The apocalypse is nigh they say, but who really cares? The
    spontaneous combustion of the Universe could only be an improvement, so sayeth
    Black Box Recorder.</p><p>
    
    About midway through the album, though, the song cycle lapses into barely-
    tolerable redundancy. The album really loses the casual, deliberate momentum
    it'd been building upon. The sheer simplicity of their approach to songwriting
    begins backfiring to some degree.  ""Life is unfair/ Kill yourself/ Or get over
    it,"" goes the chorus to ""Child Psychology."" Honestly, ""Child Psychology"" is the
    most ridiculous, sorry- for- itself disaster of an indie rock song I've heard
    in a long while. It's a spoken first- person narrative concerning the stunted
    intellectual and social development of a particular little shit, and the irreparable
    damage done by misguided and misinformed parenting. ""I stopped talking when I was
    six years old/ I didn't want anything more to do with the outside world,"" Nixey
    deadpans.</p><p>
    
    And so it goes that these lament- loving Brits just keep churning out more quaint
    songs about resigned depression. Sample the cynical detachment on ""Wonderful Life,""
    and get a load of the mournful ""Hated Sunday:"" ""Close the window/ Draw the blinds/
    I can't stand it if the sun shines on Sunday."" Okay, enough is enough with the
    hollow malaise and paltry middle- class problems already! Try more coffee, guys--
    shock treatment, St. John's Wort, Babar bedtime stories, anything.</p><p>
    
    Yep, after a time, you're just left with empty sorrow and overly reflective
    gobbledygook over rhythmically- static, lightly- strummed reverb- treated
    guitar. The same pouty, subdued vocals continually ooze from Nixey's lips.
    In fact, Black Box Recorder finally carry the fashionable woe- is- me depression
    thing way over the edge, and chalk up major demerits for covering Jacques Brel's
    loathsome pro- suicide sing- along, ""Seasons in the Sun.""</p><p>
    
    Black Box Recorder convey a kind of mildly morose but slightly tongue- in- cheek
    Sylvia Plath- meets- Paul McCartney pop sensibility, with a fairly evident
    Portishead affectation thrown into the mix. Singer Sarah Nixey has the type of
    one- dimensional soft whisper that's certainly pleasant enough to draw you into
    her world without hope. But soon, you just feel yourself aching for her to begin
    screaming her dainty lungs out, just to shake up the melancholic monotony a bit.
    The childish existential suffering is a just bit more than this reviewer can stomach.</p></div>"|743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/743-england-made-me/|6.2|Michael Sandlin

Okay, how about a
    record with baby noises, car honks, steamship blurts, banjo plucking, tape
    hiss, a heartbeat, crackling ocean waves, a Muppet- voiced guy whispering
    into a four track, and a man declaring ""Beware the Ocean of Faces!"" Okay,
    how about all of those elements <i>in one song</i>?  I'm here to proclaim,
    ""No.""</p><p>
    
    Up to this point, indie rock had never seen its ""Intolerance,"" ""Heaven's Gate,""
    or ""Cutthroat Island""-- massive economic and artistic failures.  But the Music
    Tapes' <i>1st Imaginary Symphony for Nomad</i> is that overwrought beast nobody
    has been waiting for.  Recorded over the course of <i>four years</i>, and taken
    over the Atlantic to Abbey Road for mixing, the Music Tapes' debut full length
    is a document in uncontrolled '60s pop fetishism.  Think about this: My Bloody
    Valentine's <i>Loveless</i> took less than three years to craft.  Airfare could
    have been spared, because this sounds like it was recorded inside the utility
    closet of Abbey Road... with <i>tools</i> from inside the utility closet at Abbey
    Road.  But perhaps this album will be the sledgehammer blow to the back of the
    heads of Elephant 6 junkies and musicians, where upon they'll sit back, peel off
    their boob- sized headphones, look in the mirror, and realize, ""Jesus, I think
    this has gone far enough.""</p><p>
    
    There's a disturbed obsessive nature in someone who would fly to another continent
    just so they could mix on the ""original EMI desk and limmiter"" that the Beatles
    and George Martin used.  The Elephant 6's worship of the Beach Boys and, primarily,
    the Beatles has clouded their vision to such a point that they've forgotten what
    those deified bands were really about-- writing amazing songs.  Sure, there was a
    backwards guitar solo on ""I'm Only Sleeping"" and backwards handclaps on ""It's All
    Too Much,"" but they only served to give weird experimental qualities to already
    great music.</p><p>
<i>1st Symphony</i> is a fitting album to close out this selfish decade, or
    rather, to put the final nail in its coffin.  For here we have the zenith of
    artistic onanism and sonic wankery.  This record weaves such a dense web of
    inside jokes, uncontrolled indulgences, and obtuse statements that it can
    only be frustrating, annoying, and disturbing for any listener who wasn't
    involved in its creation.  Even the packaging comes in an admittedly
    creative, yet befuddling and fragile mess of pop-ups and comics.</p><p>
<i>1st Symphony</i> can be a fascinating listen, but not for any musical
    reasons. When looked at as not an ""album,"" but as an audible comic strip or
    sonic collage, the Music Tapes becomes somewhat more tolerable.  Yet it's
    never rewarding or comprehensible.  One can't help but question the sanity
    and motives of the juvenile idiot savant behind the cacophony, Neutral Milk
    Hotel's Julian Koster.  The analog junk throughout echoes the dawn of
    recording with wax-paper pops, fuzzing speakers, and sepia tones.  Imagine
    if Thomas Edison had made an album's worth of the Olivia Tremor Control's
    most unbearable noodlings.  Surely, Koster is fascinated with the recording
    process and the history of pop.  But unfortunately, the hodge- podge result
    of his obsession doesn't inspire any sympathy in the listener.</p></div>"|5524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5524-1st-imaginary-symphony-for-nomad/|2.7|Brent DiCrescenzo

    has dug its way into the national consciousness via ""The Rockafeller Skank,""
    have been busy since their 1997 breakthrough, <i>Dig Your Own Hole</i>.
    Maybe last year's DJ mix album, the reasonably decent <i>Brothers Gonna
    Work It Out</i>, should have been the clue, but Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons
    have clearly been raiding a library- sized record collection since their
    last offering of ""original"" music.</p><p>
    
    ""Music: Response,"" the album's leadoff, starts like a ride on the Autobahn
    with Kraftwerk circa the mid '70s, with its analog synth blips and monotone
    computerwelt voices,  before tossing in some ferocious beats to bring
    Krautrock into the new millennium.  The mood carries through on ""Under the
    Influence"" with more Kraftwerk- styled noodlings.  Meanwhile, their best
    instrumental effort is ""The Sunshine Underground,"" an eight- and- a- half
    minute ride through chiming tones, wafting flute- like sounds, and sputtering
    and gurgling synths that intertwine with the briefest of dreamy vocals.
    Actually, it wouldn't have been out of place on the last Orbital album.</p><p>
<i>Surrender</i> will receive a ton of hype based on its superstar guest
    appearances, and none more historically relevant than ""Out of Control"" with
    New Order's Bernard Sumner on vocals.  Being electronic dance music freaks
    from Manchester, New Order is like the holy grail to the Chemical Brothers
    and it's easy to see why.  The Chemicals share with their Manchester
    predecessors an obsession with hypnotic, melodic, dance beats.  ""Out of
    Control"" works so well it could be a lost track from <i>Low Life</i>.
    After his turn on ""Setting Son"" with the Chemicals in 1996, Oasis'
    terminally out- of- style Noel Gallagher returns for another psychedelic,
    Beatles-esque anthem on ""Let Forever Be,"" again snagging the rhythm track
    from ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" off <i>Revolver</i>.</p><p>
<i>Surrender</i> is both the Chemical Brothers most immediately satisfying
    work and, perhaps not coincidentally, the most like a rock album of their
    career.  Unlike a fair share of techno, these songs feel like ""songs,""
    not a collection of clever samples and a race to the fastest BPM on the
    planet.  Yeah, you can go out and buy your jungle, your trance, your
    trip-hop and your ambient, but why would you when you'd be sacrificing
    the greatest gift of all: <i>Surrender</i>'s love and understanding.</p></div>"|1412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1412-surrender/|9.0|Sarah Zupko

    Takako Minekawa's <i>Cloudy Cloud Calculator</i> was a solid record, but
    Minekawa's gooey pop instincts occasionally rendered the tunes a little too
    cute for their own good. After listening to <i>Ximer</i>, we realize that
    some of the problem must have been in the beat. In fact, almost without
    exception, the rhythmic edge lent by most of the remixers here adds the
    finishing touch to Minekawa's well- crafted sound, ultimately boosting
    the songs a notch.</p><p>
    
    The best of example of this is Cornelius' picture- perfect reworking of
    ""Milk Rock."" Da Man from Japan takes a decent song and drapes it in a fluffy
    blanket of Casio jungle breakbeats, keeping the innocence and sweetness of
    the original intact while adding a sublime and poppy acoustic guitar to map
    out the changes. The final outcome is a fine, fine track that would fit
    nicely on one of Darla's ""Drum-n-Bliss"" compilations.</p><p>
    
    Next up is ""Telstar,"" which gets the dramatic string treatment from Mark
    Borthwick and Trevor Holland, followed Kid Loco's spicing up of ""Black
    Forest,"" with its killer guitar pattern lifted, Indiana Jones- style, from
    the '70s funk Temple of Boom. Loco combines the wide- eyed melody with a
    gritty groove perfect for windows- down rolling through the night streets
    of Tokyo.  Make sure to take out the Lincoln Town Car.</p><p>
    
    On the more experimental tip is the obligatory Oval track, a radical
    rethinking of ""International Velvet."" As usual, Oval treats the source track
    like any another sound file-- something to be fed into the computer and
    twisted. Markus Popp's Macintosh shapes the song to sound like something
    from Oval's <i>Dok</i>, sparing only the faintest echo of Minekawa's voice.
    When her petite pipes break through, it sounds as though she's crying out
    from the depths of the ""Tron"" motherboard-- you want to jump in and help,
    but then you remember what happened to that kid in the computer. (Actually,
    you don't remember that very well, because you only saw the movie once and
    it was a long, long time ago, but you want to jump in and help, anyway.)
    Popp throws in a lulling little CD skip to give the track some rhythm, not
    to mention his trademark 15khz sine wave to give the hairs in your ear canal
    a workout. In three words: it is beautiful.</p><p>
    
    Also of note are Nobukazu Takemura's electronic bossa nova rendition of
    ""Phonoballoon Song"" which utilizes some nice Steve Reich-ish percussion,
    and Sweet Trip's techno- soaked spin on ""Cat House"" which closes the EP
    on an up note. Ultimately, <i>Ximer</i> isn't going to change the world,
    but it gives a good name to the tiresome notion of the remix record.</p></div>"|5298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5298-ximer-ep/|7.1|Mark Richard-San

For example, I
    voted for Reagan in a mock school election in 1980-- the same year Echo
    and the Bunnymen released their debut album, <i>Crocodiles</i>. As it
    turned out, I wasn't listening to Echo back then; my first exposure came
    via the beautiful single ""Bring on the Dancing Horses,"" a song that played
    during a key moment in the John Hughes film ""Pretty in Pink.""</p><p>
    
    I finally figured out that the reason John Hughes' shit hit so close to
    home is that I was the exact age of the main characters in just about
    every one of his 80's movies. I was just about to turn 16 when ""Sixteen
    Candles"" went to theaters, and by the time ""The Breakfast Club"" hit the
    big screen I already had three miserable years of high school under my
    belt. So rather than being the time of my childhood, the 80's were when
    I became a man. Legally, anyway.</p><p>
    
    In any case, it wasn't until I entered adulthood and cast my first real,
    non-mock vote in a presidential election (Dukakis and Bensten in '88!)
    that I became intimately familiar with an Echo and the Bunnymen album.
    My roommate Eric, who covered our dorm room with Bauhaus and Depeche Mode
    posters to balance out my Pink Floyd laziness, had purchased their
    self-titled record.  It came to be their last true album before they
    broke up. It had a big college radio hit called ""Lips Like Sugar"" that
    Eric liked to put on when we had parties. The sound of it still makes me
    feel drunk and awkward.</p><p>
    
    Of course, that album couldn't compare to their ""greatest hits"" compilation,
    <i>Songs to Learn and Sing</i>, which is still all the Echo anyone really
    needs, and which also happens to be the first vinyl record I bought after
    getting a turntable again in 1996 (the year I voted for Ralph Nader). Now,
    in 2000, I'm almost certainly not going to vote at all, but I am going to
    spend some time listening to the new Echo and the Bunnymen album. I never
    would have guessed it, but it's actually pretty decent.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, Ian McCulloch and friends have mellowed considerably on <i>What
    are You Going to Do with Your Life?</i>  The over-the-top, bass-driven rockers
    of yore have been replaced with an album of introspective, acoustic songs
    appropriate for these aging geezers. The title track nicely illustrates
    this stripped-down approach, with gentle guitar strums and some light
    brushwork on the drums providing the only backing for McCulloch's rich,
    resonant voice. He sounds more like Bono here than I remember, but the
    quality of his singing is perfect-- a weary voice transmitting from some
    abandoned studio of yesteryear.</p><p>
    
    The strings on tunes like ""Rust"" and ""Fools Like Us"" remind us that Echo
    were always one of the more classic rock-oriented of the new wave bands,
    and there's something vaguely comforting and cute about their overzealous
    reach. More startling are the scattered horn accents, like the stately
    trumpet that gives ""When It Blows Over"" and ""Get in the Car"" their charms;
    these songs sound like the AM radio-aping Jim O'Rourke's been into lately.
    (Strange, yes, but it works well in this context.)  And when McCulloch
    brings it all back home with the melancholy piano tune, ""History Chimes,""
    we realize why we liked Echo in the first place: they wrote, and continue
    to write, good songs. These old guys get my vote for most surprising
    comeback of 1999.</p></div>"|2667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2667-what-are-you-going-to-do-with-your-life/|6.4|Mark Richard-San

His name is not Sean Combs, ""Mutt"" Lange, John     McEntire, Steve Albini, or even the RZA. You could argue that the honor     of defining a decade should go to Prince Paul, but that skit thing just     pisses me off now. Sure, it worked on <i>Three Feet High and Rising</i> but give it a rest, people! My huge shout of hearty praise for shaping     the musical landscape of this decade goes to Andrew Weatherall.</p>
<p>It was Weatherall's remix of the lame, floppy-fringed Primal Scream     dirge ""I'm Losing More Than I've Ever Had"" that broke dance culture out     from the warehouses and into the great wide cultural open. Weatherall's     remix of that track was so radically different from the source material     that the band retitled the track ""Loaded"" and the indie-led dance boom     burst forth on a generation raised on Sherbet Dib-Dabs, a clipped ear for     being insolent, and the highest quality tabs of ecstasy.</p>
<p>In the fallout from ""Loaded,"" record labels signed up any DJ for mixing     duties who knew one fader from another. Some have fallen by the wayside--     who here remembers Dean Thatcher?-- others went onto other forms of     greatness. But the fusion of indie rock and dance has never waned. The     Manic Street Preachers still cadge mixes from the Chemical Brothers, as     do the Charlatans UK. And the recent success of Super Furry Animals is     directly attributable to Weatherall's pioneering.</p>
<p>Don't think that Weatherall got the remixing gig by accident. He'd been     assiduously garnering a following for his DJ sets at the seminal London     Balearic and acid house club Shoom where he'd enthrall clubbers (luv'd     up on pure MDMA) with his mix of DJ Pierre and the Clash. So after Bobby     Gillespie and his troop discovered that this alchemist could rip up     their sub-Byrdsian jangle into an anthem for the ecstasy generation,     Weatherall didn't have to worry about when the next pay check was coming     in. Every record company wanted to cop a feel of the man's greatness.</p>
<p>Weatherall conjured up classic after classic, such as his mix of the     Grid's ""Floatation,"" which remains one of the most sublime of Balearic     12""s, and his dusted-up take on ""Abandon"" by This Petrol Emotion. His     re-casing of James made that sad Mancunian band a vital listen and his     spin on Bjork's ""One Day"" remains a highlight of her career.</p>
<p>Weatherall became a major player in the Boys Own production camp and     fanzine and went onto produce Primal Scream's mind-blowingly graceful     <i>Screamadelica</i> album and its cheaper date sister, One Dove's     <i>Morning White Dove</i>.  The latter could have surpassed     <i>Screamadelica</i> in beauty had London Records not interfered and     brought in pop-dance shite-hawker Stephen ""I Ruined New Order"" Hague     to provide the beancounters with radio-friendly pop singles.</p>
<p>Realizing he was becoming an overexposed remixer du jour, Weatherall     went underground. Would that Junior Vasquez and Peter Rauhoffer had     similar integrity! Weatherall founded the Sabres of Paradise label and     studio project and sought to mesh his predilection for urban fear with     skunk-fuelled hip-hop and dub. <i>Sabresonic</i> can boast one of the     finest remixes of all time-- David Holmes' acidic percussion workout of     ""Smokebelch"" more than rebuffs any criticism that remixing is just a     waste of time and marketing budget (which in many cases it is). Holmes     became a part of the Sabres system and his breath- taking debut album     <i>This Film's Crap, Let's Slash the Seats</i> teams him up with Jagz     Kooner and Gary Burns of the Sabres of Paradise.</p>
<p>Weatherall wittily located his Sabresonic club in a disused railway     arch under London Bridge station, the area best known as the former     prowling ground of Jack the Ripper. Weatherall would DJ his dubby hip-hop     before guest DJs like Dr. Alex Paterson would knock clubbers out of their     stoned groove with cyborg blasts such as Abfahrt's ""Come Into My Life""     (imagine the Band as a German hard techno act-- I gasp every time I hear     this tune).</p>
<p><i>Sabresonic</i> (the album) was followed by <i>Haunted Dancehall</i> on     which Weatherall pushed into prominence his love of Jamaican musical styles     (reference ""Wilmot"" and ""Theme"" if you think I'm crazy). He layed down the     blueprint for big beat (""Tow Truck"") in addition to producing skeletal     techno similar to the ossified forms that Plastikman was putting out at     the same time.</p>
<p>Before long, Weatherall killed of the Sabres of Paradise, the Sabresonic     club, and established the short-lived Emissions labels. But more lastingly,     he teamed up with former Emissions engineer Keith Tenniswood; the phoenix     rose majestic once again as Two Lone Swordsman.</p>
<p>The duo's debut album, <i>The Fifth Mission: Return to the Flightpath     Estate</i>, is a slo-mo groove terrorist, ninja-trained to sneak up on     the listener and stick in the blade. The fact that the Two Lone Swordsmen     sustain our interest over a double CD is surely a testament to     Weatherall's complete mastery of atmosphere, self-control, and above     all, narrative. The Two Lone Swordsmen project works as (caution:     overused critic's standby phrase approaching) a soundtrack to an     unfilmed movie. <i>The Fifth Mission</i> is an existentially paranoid     south London yakuza flick.</p>
<p>Weatherall and Tenniswood released two album-length EPs in the     aftershock of <i>The Fifth Mission</i> (<i>Swimming Not Skimming</i> and <i>Stockwell Steppas</i>) but both were limited releases and     became woefully unavailable when the Emissions labels folded. Two Lone     Swordsmen finally signed to Warp in the UK, where the duo sit at the head     table with Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Plaid, and the Boards of Canada. In     the US, Matador picked them up, and over here the Two Lone Swordsmen find     themselves sharing a hugely diverse trough with the likes of Yo La Tengo,     Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and Cat Power.</p>
<p>But <i>Stay Down</i> should be more than sufficient to deter you from     buying a Guitar Wolf b-sides compilation, or it may just get you out of     that bearably ceaseless Belle and Sebastian slump. It's less skunky than     its predecessors and more of an electroid groove. And if that's not enough     to sell you, Matador's also tacked on an additional five tracks from the     Warp-issued <i>A Bag of Blue Sparks</i> EP.  These five tracks proudly     showcase Weatherall's knack for distilling truly funky elements with an     avantish twist. So ""Sticky"" and ""Gay Spunk"" could easily satisfy a      Fatboy-wearied house party crowd while techno trainspotters can do backflips at     having obtained the original version of ""Black Commandments"" (remixed by     Jega as ""Unity Gain"" on his <i>Spectrum</i> LP).</p>
<p>If <i>Stay Down</i> isn't the next big leap in the rolling evolution of     techno, it's at least a consolidation of Weatherall's long-lauded and     thoroughly well-deserved position as visionary producer and audio alchemist.      And if he's staying down now, he'll be up for air soon. I'm     holding my breath on this one.</p></div>"|8224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8224-stay-down/|9.3|Paul Cooper

    at the time-- was its earnestness.  Of course, this is exactly the quality that makes most of
    it all but unlistenable 15 years later.  So many of those bands were just so fucking serious
    about what they were doing, about their music and themselves.  They didn't let up for a second.
    They just pouted away on 12"" sleeves, t-shirts and huge concert video displays, evidently
    secure in the knowledge that their featherweight finger- and- thumb keyboard melodies were
    the nodal point around which the future evolution of the human species rotated.</p><p>
    
    With all that's happened since, though, even the most die-hard Depeche Mode fans must wince
    when confronted with the bleeping of Speak and Spell or the lyrics to, say, ""People are People.""
    Go ahead and try it: identify the most hardcore Mode fan you know, call 'em up, and read them
    those lyrics.  Their first reaction will probably be nervous laughter, which will slowly trail
    off, and by the first time through the chorus you should be able to hear-- even over the phone--
    their butt squirming in their chair.  ""Who is this?"" they'll ask.  ""Why are you doing this to
    me?""</p><p>
    
    Of course, there were bands that avoided the self- important New Wave posturing (though, not 
    many).  Erasure at least has camp value.  The Pet Shop Boys seemed down- to- earth enough.
    New Order is almost unassailable, probably due to the fact that Bernard Sumner waited until
    the records were almost released before he tossed off their lyrics.  It's the absence of this
    grandiosity that makes a lot of today's new New Wave bands-- like Orange Cake Mix, Godzuki,
    and Barcelona-- so good.  Simply put, their lyrics aren't embarrassing.  Okay, they're silly,
    sure-- maybe even tongue- in- cheek  at times.  But they're not Camouflage.</p><p>
    
    Barcelona, in particular, takes fairly faithfully rendered synth- pop and adds lyrics about
    such things as IRC, computer camp, and Commodore 64's-- it's nerd-pop in the nicest possible
    way.  It's fluffy, yeah, but it's consistently endearing.  And the music, while never exactly
    innovative, managed to provide some enjoyment.  The guitar is more prominent here than it
    usually is on new wave records, and the songs don't lean too heavily on their electronic bases.
    Some, like ""Sunshine Delay"" and the excellent ""The Downside of Computer Camp,"" are downright
    rockin'.  But <i>Simon Basic</i>'s highlight lies in ""I Know What You Think of Me,"" a track
    that sounds so much like <i>Brotherhood</i>- era New Order that it may as well be a cover.
    (To Barcelona's credit, the song skirts plagiarism and lands squarely in homage territory.)</p><p>
<i>Simon Basic</i> isn't gonna rock any boats.  It's harmless.  Moreover, the band's lyrics 
    probably won't be appreciated outside of a certain demographic that consists primarily of those
    who are in college now (or recently graduated), have owned Ataris or Commodore-64s, or have
    ever donned a fake stick-on bindi.  But this album has at least a few sunny afternoons with
    friends in it.  If you have any friends.</p></div>"|559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/559-simon-basic/|6.6|Zach Hooker

    &gt;From: Snake [vanhalenfan@secretpolice.co.uk]<br/>
    &gt;X-Mailer: Mozilla 4.06 [en] (Win98; I)<br/>
    &gt;To: Tony Blair [henchman12@lucifer.co.uk]<br/>
    &gt;Subject: X-Plaid922-1; Request for Government Assistance</p><p>
    Dear Mr. Blair:</p><p>
    My position is as an undercover agent in London's secret police mafia.
    I have been hired to investigate allegations that two former members of
    Black Dog Productions, Ed Handley and Andy Turner, have illegally obtained
    official documents pertaining to the creation of a highly addictive, mind-
    altering chemical agent (referred to in goverment documents as X-Plaid922-1)
    which affects its victims via audio transmissions rather than means of
    physical intake.</p><p>
    I am concerned that Handley and Turner may have, under the alias of Plaid,
    not only unlocked previously unrealized secrets about the production of this
    chemical agent, but also discovered a way to digitally reproduce it onto
    compact discs, cassettes, and even vinyl records.  As you know, it is the
    reproduction of the X-Plaid agent to compact disc that is of the utmost
    concern.  In this technologically- advanced society, nearly every home has
    a compact disc unit.  Handley and Turner must be stopped before every person
    on this Earth becomes an X-Plaid junkie.</p><p>
    The first piece of evidence I have obtained is their 1998 release <i>Not for
    Threes</i>. The music on this record is so painfully wonderful that even I,
    Snake ""Nerves of Steel"" Snakeman, was almost drawn into its tangled web of
    madness.  The album is an excellent indication that Handley and Turner are
    not working alone.  <i>Not for Threes</i> features guest appearances by a
    number of female vocalists, among them Talkin' Loud Records diva Nicolette
    and even Icelandic sensation Bjork.  When tested for levels of the addictive
    X-Plaid agent, <i>Not for Threes</i> registered a 7.5 out of 10 on
    Pitchfork- funded equipment.  Luckily, the album did not gain widespread
    mainstream acceptance, though the minds of a number of club- hopping
    e-consuming electronic music fans were utterly destroyed.</p><p>
    The greatest shock to me is how an album containing the X-Plaid agent, let
    alone such excessive amounts, was able to garner enough of a following for
    the band to appear on our own BBC- operated John Peel show!  Thankfully,
    Plaid had apparently not yet perfected their aural narcotic, as Pitchfork
    equipment registered X-Plaid levels for the band's subsequent <i>Peel
    Session</i> EP at a slightly less potent 6.8.</p><p>
    Plaid's latest album, <i>Rest Proof Clockwork</i>, is another story entirely.
    Here, they seem to have enhanced and mutated the X-Plaid agent dramatically
    through more varied instrumentation and exploration of what is commonly
    referred to as melodic ""ambient"" music.  This allows the listener to lose
    themselves completely in a world of X-Plaid- induced bliss, whether they're
    paying attention to the music or not.  A key demonstration of this is the
    album's closing track, ""Air Locked.""  The music begins with a series of
    percussive shuffles and squeaks before beautiful, highly melodic chimes and
    digital effects enter the mix.  The sound is almost spiritual, invoking
    cinematic rainforest imagery.</p><p>
    The X-Plaid agent is planted throughout this entire record, making it
    difficult or impossible to resist addiction.  For instance, the orchestral
    ""Dead Sea"" is an irresistable symphony of pure evil, recalling Jerry
    Goldsmith's timeless score to ""Poltergeist.""  ""Little People"" is a blend
    of \xB5-Ziq's spacy melodic attack, and pummelling, cut-up hip-hop grooves.
    ""Pino Pomo"" combines backwards effects with the feel of a futuristic
    spaghetti western.  Even the absurdly titled ""New Bass Hippo"" pulls through,
    incorporating shuffling percussion and a Stereolab- influenced piano line.</p><p>
    With every passing second I work on this case, I find myself becoming more
    and more attached to the sound of the music, but I must venture on... to
    justice.  I will require government assistance-- backup, arms, further
    documentation from the X-Plaid922-1 file, and a free lunch at the Denny's
    in Golden Valley, Minnesota, USA-- in apprehending these two zany, madcap
    individuals.  Please respond ASAP.</p><p>

The weather was cool with no
    rain or humidity. A friend-- we'll call him ""Joe""-- had pointed me in the right direction,
    so I was now on the Blue Line ""to Forest Park"" at Damen.  I was headed to the loop so I could
    switch over to the Orange Line for Midway.</p><p>
    
    The sun was up, but was hidden behind the long row of buildings that stood there as if they
    were just people <i>made</i> of buildings. There were three other passengers in the car, each
    probably writing his or her own record review. Mine was to be about the first solo recording
    by Eleventh Dream Day/ Tortoise/ For Carnation guy Doug McCombs.  My first concern was whether
    to call it a solo project or new band.  Was it really a solo effort?  He had quite a few people
    playing with him.  But he wrote all the songs... I finally ended up deciding on ""solo effort,""
    at about the same time that I arrived at the Monroe stop and exited the train.</p><p>
    
    At this point, I needed to make my way through the city for a few blocks. I remembeOrange back to
    the first time I heard Tortoise. I bought their first album in the summer of 1994, along with
    Girls Against Boys' <i>Cruise Yourself</i>, Ida's <i>Tales of Brave Ida</i>, and Liz Phair's
    <i>Whip Smart</i>. I didn't really get a chance to listen to the records until I was on an
    airplane headed towards Ireland, where I would spend the next year. Tortoise ended up making
    its way to my discman one night while I was busy trying to keep warm using three blankets and
    a hot water bottle (the Irish didn't really believe in insulating their buildings). The music
    filled the darkness of my room but, at the same time, left me with a feeling of moroseness and
    wonder. What struck me most was the bass-- it didn't play rhythms. It spoke. It walked around
    the room, leaned against the door, then danced to the window. It was Doug McCombs. Well, okay,
    it was also Bundy K. Brown, but for review purposes, we'll stick to McCombs.</p><p>
    
    With Brokeback, McCombs is free to let his bass walk us through his version of the Chicago
    post-rock music scene. Releasing this album automatically relegated all his previous bands to
    side- project status. It gave us a blueprint mapping essentially what Doug ""Puffy"" McCombs
    brings to these other bands: the empty ambiance filled by plucked strings; the simple driving
    melodies that wander from your speakers without settling anywhere in particular.</p><p>
    
    Hunger and my bag were weighing heavily as I climbed the stairway to the Jackson stop on the
    Orange Line. I pulled out a bag of peanuts that I'd stashed during my flight in to Chicago.
    Perfect. Eggs would have been better, but hey, protein is protein. I got out my discman as
    the Midway train approached, putting the Brokeback disc in for my trip down the line.</p><p>
    
    I fell in and out of sleep with the music on my headset as the train made its trip to Midway.
    Here was the same sense of space that defined the first Tortoise album. The sounds were sparse
    and ethereal-- distant, yet close.  Most of the tracks on <i>Field Recordings</i> are comprised
    of simple six- string bass and brushed drum accompaniment due to McCombs' minimalist approach
    to arranging.  On ""A Blueprint,"" the drums are even forgone by John McEntire for a simple
    triangle.</p><p>
    
    Mary Hanson of Stereolab makes a guest appearance on ""The Great Banks,"" a tune that answers
    (and is basically the same melody as) ""Along the Banks of Rivers,"" the last track off Tortoise's
    <i>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</i>. While the Tortoise version is the slowest and most
    drifting track on that album, the McCombs version is lighter still-- music from a spaghetti
    western using whistling and la-la-ing to carry the main melody as the track slowly works
    through its five minutes.</p><p>
    
    McCombs also uses sound effects to give the album a sense of place. I woke up during ""The
    Wilson Ave. Bridge at the Chicago River, 1953"" thinking that I was sitting on a garbage barge
    on Long Island Sound as seagull and tern chirps surrounded me. (Although, I guess I was probably
    supposed to be somewhere near the Wilson Avenue Bridge.  Oops.) Putting the song in a setting
    like this lifts the bass- driven instrumental into the atmosphere, placing its sound outside
    the studio and in the air as if it were a soundtrack to your existence. And at this time, it
    had indeed become the soundtrack to my ride in the third car of a Orange Line train heading towards
    Midway Airport on the South Side of Chicago.</p></div>"|951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/951-field-recordings-from-the-cook-county-water-table/|8.5|Chip Chanko

    Lola Run</i> hype machine.  It's touted as the savior of European cinema, and
    the film that may finally put the German film industry on the pop culture
    map of the post-millennium era.  Rumor has it, the filmmaker already has a
    Hollywood deal in the works. (A word of advice: don't do it!)</p><p>
    Like the true postmodern filmmaker he is, Tom Tykwer doesn't believe in
    divisions between artistic mediums, hence the centrality of the techno score
    in the film.  The music quite literally moves the film along, and may also
    bust open the market for German electronica in this country.  We may even
    have a true Renaissance man from the old school in our midst-- Tykwer not
    only directed the film, but wrote the screenplay and composed the lion's
    share of the intense, high-energy music that drives the film.</p><p>
    Thing is, this music won't likely persuade you to throw out your Rastermusic/
    Noton or K7 Records.  The frenetic mood is pretty constant-- a highly
    essential feature, I admit, for a film entitled <i>Run Lola Run</i>-- but a few
    changes of mood might encourage me to spin this one more often.  The stuff
    on this record could be accurately summed up as ""a poor man's Underworld,""
    especially with all the monotone vocals and pulsing beats that so clearly
    ape <i>Born Slippy</i>.  Still, if you're one of the many getting hooked on
    this film, and you need a better soundtrack for your hours spent in front
    of the Playstation, this could hit the spot.  Your call.

For that, we can thank
    Yellow Productions, the UK- based electronic label that brought up Dimitri from Paris.
    Jean-Yves Prieur, aka Kid Loco, has been putting in his time as a remixer, especially
    over the past year.  He's shown up with excellent re- arrangements of songs by the
    High Llamas, the Pastels, Cornelius, Mogwai, and Takako Minekawa.  Naturally, his
    stateside debut, the specially- priced <i>Prelude to a Grand Love Story</i> EP, sparks
    a bit of curiosity.</p><p>
    
    The shitty thing is, only two of the nine tracks on the EP appear in their original
    incarnations.  The opening track, ""She's My Lover,"" blends the new age-ish vibe of
    a sitar-less Talvin Singh with the spaced- out psychedelics DJ Shadow dished up on
    UNKLE's <i>Psyence Fiction</i>.  Later, there's ""Sister Curare,"" whose starry atmosphere,
    skull- rattling beats, and jazzy piano'll get you reminiscing about the darker Ninja
    Tune stuff from '95-'97.  Also included is the ""Original Radio Edit"" of ""Love Me Sweet,""
    a typically folky but endearing French ballad featuring the girlish, whispery vocals of
    Katrina Mitchell.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the disc is comprised of various remixes of these and other Kid Loco tracks.
    Saint Etienne's version of ""Love Me Sweet"" is a slightly extended take on Loco's radio
    edit, but it's stripped down and minimal instead of orchestrated and airy.  Jim O'Rourke's
    spin on the song incorporates discordant electronic noodling before pulling the timeless
    ""fakeout"" ending.  The track then veers off in an entirely different direction as O'Rourke
    adds a mid-song ambient noise collage and a highly melodic mix of looped acoustic guitars.
    Tommy Hools' remix of ""Love Me Sweet,"" however, is completely half-assed, bordering on
    rude.  Hools keeps the original song structure intact, but sucks all the creativity out,
    throwing in a sludgy hip-hop rhythm track and a boring, repetitive piano line.</p><p>
    
    Bang Bang recreate ""She's My Lover,"" mixing in an obvious sitar, removing the song's
    vocal track, upping the reverb and adding their own sound effects-- in the end, it sounds
    like a slightly altered version of the original that is, if anything, more organic than
    Loco's creation.  This leaves us with two mixes of ""Relaxin' with Cherry,"" a song I've
    never heard in its standard form.  Let me suffice to say that the Gak Sato Pre-Echo Mix
    beats the crap out of the Dimitri from Paris and Bibi remix.</p><p>
    
    As the title suggests, this record's a prelude to <i>A Grand Love Story</i>, Kid Loco's
    Atlantic Records full- length debut.  It's just too bad we don't get to hear more of
    <i>his</i> work on this EP.  But despite its general hit- and- miss tendencies, Loco's
    untouched pieces, along with the Gak Sato mix of ""Relaxin' with Cherry"" and the O'Rourke
    mix of ""Love Me Sweet"" make <i>Prelude</i> worth the special price.</p></div>"|4416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4416-prelude-to-a-grand-love-story-ep/|7.0|Ryan Schreiber

    final Fourth of July weekend of the millennium.  Or so they kept telling
    me on CNN Headline News all day today.  Yeah, I was feelin' it.  Here in
    the heart of Chicago, we felt temperatures in the high 90's as gallons of
    sweat gushed from our pores in a futile attempt to cool our golden-plump,
    freshly roasted bodies.  My living room, a sauna.</p><p>
    In heat like this, there's only one thing you can do: aim a fan at yourself,
    take a cool bath, and listen to good music.  Today, as I found my way into
    the cold bathtub water (is this creating a nice visual?), To Rococo Rot was
    there for me.  <i>The Amateur View</i> is all part of a new German subgenre
    of ambient electronica called ""squirm.""  The artists blend analog effects
    with warm, electronic drones and mechanic percussion for a sound that's
    unmistakably digital, yet 100% human.</p><p>
<i>The Amateur View</i> definitely finds itself on the more mellow end of
    the genre's mellow- to- spastic spectrum.  Bands like Schneider TM and
    Slick Sixty possess a slightly more erratic and unpredictable sound than
    To Rococo Rot tend to display, but <i>The Amateur View</i> outdoes either
    of those bands' albums in sheer listening pleasure.  <i>The Amateur View</i>
    seems to draw largely from Brian Eno's early ambient experiments, Ninja
    Tune-style electronic jazz and minimalist percussion-based outfits like
    Pan Sonic.  This combination of influences is, in its own Pokemon-like
    way, deadly.
    </p><p>
    Over the course of 11 tracks, you'll be led through another green world
    and into a sea of such remarkable tranquility, you'd think you were on
    a moonbase.  The music's underwater, oceanic attributes are perfect for
    a day in the tub, lounging in your temperature-controlled environment,
    dreaming of a swim in a rural Minnesotan lake.  It shall whisk me away.
    It shall whisk me... Yes...

    build their own definition of ""making sense."" U.S. Maple willfully,
    stubbornly makes no sense-- but not in the cleverly obscurist way Pavement
    makes no sense, and not in the yammering, screeching, pummeling way the
    Boredoms make no sense. <em>Talker</em>, you see, goes to great lengths to
    sabotage language, both musical and verbal, and finds novel ways of
    failing to get its point across.</p><p>
    Musically, U.S. Maple are the hapless losers in a three-legged race, with
    each trying to build momentum by pushing their instruments in different
    directions at different times.  Guitarists Mark Shippy and Todd Rittmann
    play like they're getting their fingers caught in the strings; drummer Pat
    Samson plays like his kit keeps falling apart. Verbally, vocalist Al Johnson
    bypasses his voice box completely, his lungs and throat emitting an
    inscrutable wheeze. Even when you resort to scanning the lyric sheet,
    lyrics like, ""Your face is a country to camp/ So save your neck for tiger,""
    are no more illuminating. And yet the culmination of all these no-sense-making 
    factors results in an oddly visceral listening experience.</p><p>
    Several images come to mind upon hearing U.S. Maple's fractured,
    gremlin-like sound. A final performance at the Rest Home for First-Generation 
    Rock Stars (a 90-year-old Bob Dylan with throat cancer,
    Keith Richards trying to control his shaking, palsied hands long enough to
    muster a guitar riff, and Ringo Starr with Alzheimer's, repeatedly
    forgetting where the beat goes); Igor and the Hunchback of Notre Dame
    forming a band with the Elephant Man; the blues being raped by New York no
    wave and giving birth to the Shaggs; the sound of music imploding, turning
    itself inside out, being dipped in liquid nitrogen and dropped out of a
    five-story window.... Okay, so U.S. Maple is not as revolutionary as that
    last remark made it sound, but I seriously doubt you've heard anything
    like it before.
    </p><p>
    Former Swans frontman Michael Gira produced <em>Talker</em> with a more
    restrained, skeletal feel than previous U.S. Maple albums, which makes it
    even sound even weirder. Before, the squelchy chaos would be piled on with
    lunatic glee; here, it's measured out in languorous doses, the empty spaces
    seeming to signify some sort of sonic decay eating away at the music. It
    may first sound like total trash, but the mere fact that it hangs together
    at all-- and the occasional moments where suddenly all the instruments are
    playing together in something resembling a melody-- hints at a deeper
    intelligence at work. Not too deep, but, y'know, deep enough.

    They're part of one of the more interesting band complexes around these
    days-- one which includes June of '44, the Sonora Pine and the now- defunct 
    Rodan-- and both the core of this band and its many satellite members have
    proven themselves as excellent players and songwriters.</p><p>
    
    Even so, Rachel's recordings have managed to disappoint and frustrate as
    often as they've managed to please.  Their debut, <i>Handwriting</i>, was a
    solid record, pretty throughout and very often surprising; it's best moment,
    the 14+ minute- long ""Full on Night,"" is possibly the most satisfying fusion
    of strings, jazz guitar and found sound ever to grace my earholes.</p><p>
    
    Their sophomore record, <i>Music for Egon Shiele</i>, stuck to a pretty
    straight- forward chamber music format and is in equal parts sublime and
    interminable.  And then there was 1996's <i>The Sea and the Bells</i>, a
    double LP featuring a full orchestra of both traditional and bizarre
    instruments that should have been epic and expansive, and ended up being
    a little obnoxious.  (Truth be told, I've never made it through to the
    album's last quarter.)</p><p>
    
    Still, there are very few other bands doing what these guys are doing--
    that being modern chamber music with an indie rock sensibility.  For this
    reason, I continue to look forward hopefully to each new release.  And with
    <i>Selenography</i>, Rachel's finally lives up to the promise suggested by
    <i>Handwriting</i>.</p><p>
    
    Superficial details first:  <i>Selenography</i> is a really great word,
    isn't it?  The study of the physical features of the moon, the idea of
    selenography connotes a sort of Victorian hybrid of science and mysticism
    that perfectly fits the album's sound.  The chamber music feel is still
    prevalent this time out; Christian Frederickson's violin continues to
    occupy the foreground, but the bottom end has filled in a bit, more tracks
    were recorded with a drum kit, and there's freer use of samples and other
    goodies.  Tracks range from the vibraphone- and bleep- filled ambience of ""Artemisia""
    to the more simple and lush piano/ strings/ trumpet combo of ""Cuts the Metal
    Cold"" to ""Honeysuckle Suite,"" which despite being a solo harsichord piece
    amazingly manages to avoid sounding like Mannheim Steamroller.</p><p>
<i>Selenography</i>, while covering a pretty wide range of instrumental
    textures, presents a more cohesive vision than anything Rachel's have
    offered so far.  They've tightened their focus this time around and the
    payoff is substantial.  If you're expecting something as highly experimental
    as <i>The Sea and the Bells</i>, <i>Selenography</i> will probably be kind

Know what?
    I'm sick.  But before I bore you with another paragraph of
    self-pity, let me say that I'm getting better.  The symptoms
    have been reduced to a full-body sweat, a feverish chill, a
    swirling nausea, lack of appetite and the occasional dry-heave
    vomit session.</p><p>
    This afternoon, as I lay on the couch watching a hypnotising
    episode of ""Judge Mills Lane"" (the one where the rich lady's
    dog, Buttercup, was mauled to death by this guy's Rottweilers),
    I thought, ""What better way to cure my pain than by listening
    to the latest Thrill Jockey release?  Ah, there it is!""  My
    discman and headphones were being eaten by my fabulous $30
    couch, and were stuffed under my pillow.  Lying in the vicinity,
    Nobukazu Takemura's <i>Scope</i>.</p><p>
    I remember a few of Takemura's remixes-- most notably, his remix
    of Roni Size's ""Brown Paper Bag.""  They're usually crazed
    experimentations that leave behind only a fragment of the original
    song.  I can't wait to see what happens when Takemura's given
    free reign to record whatever he wants.
    </p><p>
    Drifting in and out of peaceful but fevered sleep, I listened with
    great ease to the five lengthy tracks.  For the first half hour
    of <i>Scope</i>, I was lulled into an electric dreamland with
    bizarre mid-'80s special effects.  But
    somewhere, I've heard this stuff before... the 22-minute
    opener, ""On a Balloon,"" sounds, well, exactly like a track off
    Oval's <i>Dok</i>.  Exactly.  And following, the 13-minute-long
    ""Kepler"" sounded remarkably like Tortoise's ""Ten Day Interval"" or
    Ghost's ""Daggma.""
    </p><p>
    Suddenly, at ""Taw,"" <i>Scope</i>'s third track, I shot up, stunned.
    Was this communication between primitive R2D2-type androids?  Either
    that or some wanky moog experiment.  After nine minutes of seemingly
    random robot noise, I find myself fast asleep once again.  ""Icefall""
    again cops Oval's trademark skipping CD noise, but uses it to a create
    a different effect-- this time, the skipping noise is a beautiful ambient
    coldness and is organized rhythmically.  So, like Oval, but with sort of
    a Windy and Carl feel.  <i>Scope</i> closes with the strangely medievil
    sounds of ""Tiddler,"" the album's shortest track.  In as few words as
    possible: ending music for an old Nintendo game.
    </p><p>
    It seems like Takemura's primary talent is building upon what's already
    been created by other artists.  His concepts are taken directly from
    other artists, but what he creates with his concepts is pure talent.
    Except on ""Taw,"" which is jarring and unwelcome in this record's otherwise
    harmonious soundscape.  Well, I gotta go take some Advil Cold &amp; Sinus.
    Ugh...

Miles (for the moment we'll forget his     unrelentingly mediocre '80s output) tended toward submergence of his voice.     His '70s albums-- from the fiercely swaggering <i>Jack Johnson</i> to the     seismic twin live sets recorded just prior to his six year hiatus,     <i>Agharta</i> and <i>Pangea</i>-- were mired in electronic noise and     chugging rhythm. He put a wah- wah on his trumpet and claimed that he     wanted the instruments to be indistinguishable from one another. The move     was toward collectivity in sound, an idea Miles associated with African     music (certainly refracted through the lens of Hendrix's guitar).</p>
<p>Coltrane, canonized as a saint by at least one church I know of in San     Francisco, moved in the absolute opposite direction: toward singularity--     the transcendence of his own searching voice above all else. Even the     symbology with which the two musicians presented their music moved in     opposite directions.  Davis presented himself in a kind of a primeval     paganism, as the <i>Dark Magus</i>-- the <i>Sorcerer</i>-- and cloaked his     songs in a tellurian rhetoric: earth and evil.  Coltrane, however, adopted     an almost Christian lexicon after the psalmic perfection of <i>A Love     Supreme</i>; he fancied his archangelic music a kind of personal liturgy.</p>
<p>And after a restless life of continuous ascension, Coltrane's final album     reached the cosmic heights of <i>Interstellar Space</i>. Now, we can debate     volumes on the merits and flaws of <i>Interstellar Space</i>, an album     stripped of the legendary quartet, featuring only Coltrane and Rasheed Ali     on drums. We can suffice to say that it was 'Trane's nod to the music of     the spheres, and that it is accordingly difficult and complex. The idea of     covering this album, also suffice to say, is lunacy.  However, free- jazz     drummer Gregg Bendian of Interzone and guitarist Nels Cline have attemptd to     do just that.</p>
<p>Now, I'm ever wary of the phrase ""plays the music of,"" and it can be excused     when we're talking about Gershwin or Bacharach, but the idea of someone else     playing John Coltrane's music is basically paradox. Surprisingly enough,     Cline and Bendian make the right decisions: they play in the spirit of John     Coltrane: ascendant, noisy, searching and free.  Cline's guitar- playing     offers such non- stop feedback- soaked freakout that it almost approaches     the sound of a continuously connecting modem.  Bendian's drumming is     similarly abstract but manages to always sound like creative, ballsy rock     drumming rather than the nimble coloring of Ali.</p>
<p>In reality, this album owes more to John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra     and the great '70s fusion that Miles himself inspired than any sound John     Coltrane ever produced. (I can't help but think of the guitar/ drum duo of     John McLaughlin &amp; Billy Cobham rather than 'Trane and Ali.) But there is no     doubt that the album is inspired or, at least, possessed.</p>
<p><i>Interstellar Space Revisited</i> is a forward- thinking, millennial     interpretation of Coltrane's later music. But the frontiers of jazz were so     wildly transgressed a mere five years after Coltrane's death, and the album     seems to constantly reference that first flowering of electrified jazz that     occurred under the shadow of Miles rather than Coltrane. Nevertheless, the     album is angularly beautiful in its own right and, for all the noise and     tweaks, there is indeed a sense of humility in the playing. After all, how     can you ape the spiritual questing of another? At best, you can ascend to     modest heights and then humbly thank St. John Coltrane for achieving those     grand astronomical reaches for the rest of us.  And Cline and Bendian have     achieved this, noisily, but with grace.</p></div>"|1509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1509-interstellar-space-revisited-the-music-of-john-coltrane/|7.9|Brent S.

    electric guitar is so popular is because it's the great American phallic
    symbol-- a substitute love-pump that overpaid rock stars can stroke onstage
    without going to jail.  These clammy-palmed bookworms say the source of the
    music world's fascination with guitar rock is that we, in some roundabout
    way, get a deep voyeuristic charge out of watching Keith Richards and company
    ""handle their business.""  I don't buy it all, but as sick as it sounds, that's
    the thought that kept knocking around my brain-pan as I listened to the
    Hellacopters' guitar-fueled <i>Grande Rock</i>.  And trust me, when an album
    forces you to contemplate the dark, cold notion of a member of the Rolling
    Stones yankin' the chain, something is terribly, terribly wrong.</p><p>
    
    Sporting a sound that's one part Yardbirds, one part Allman Brothers, and a
    tiny, tiny part Clash, the Hellacopters create music that would sound at home
    on a late night TV ""Freedom Rock"" compilation. As such, <i>Grande Rock</i> is
    one long, Cro-Magnonly stupid guitar solo. As ridiculously crude and full of
    chest-beating bravado as its name implies, <i>Grande Rock</i> is guitar rock
    at its most brash, cocky and ballsy. Sadly, though, all of the ass-backward
    qualities that killed guitar rock show up here, too, as track after mediocre
    track becomes more of a single long, amazing bland piece of music than an
    actual collection of songs.  The tracks themselves offer the kind of moronic
    predictability I'd hoped indie rock had left far behind.</p><p>
    
    Stylistically, these guys are in the black, as most of these kinds of bands
    are. Rock-solid guitar work backed up by nimble keyboard playing, powerful
    drum work and banshee-like vocals are what save this album from being just
    another of Sub Pop's roster of forgettable ""big rock"" bands.  See, the
    Hellacopters are decent enough for what they are-- there's no frontin' that
    these guys are technically accomplished musicians.  This type of instrumental
    mastery-- not just over the guitars mind you, but over the entire band setup--
    is something these guys should be proud of.  Actual musical talent is sadly 
    lacking in most of today's lazy-ass indie rock scene, but the Hellacopters 
    play the real deal.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, hot licks do not a good album make. Even if you can get past
    the nonexistent lyrics, the repetitive song structures and the general lack
    of creativity, there's a staggering lack of depth to <i>Grande Rock</i> that
    no power chord can cover up.  Listening to this album for anything other than
    the guilty pleasure of listening to a man tear up his guitar string by string
    is like watching porno films to score acting tips.</p></div>"|3809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3809-grande-rock/|5.3|Steven Byrd

    forward to the new Red Hot Chili Peppers record. Dan simply replied
    sardonically, ""Dooooode."" <i>BloodSugarSexMagik</i> was the first CD I ever
    purchased. Listening to a CD on headphones after a decade of cassettes was
    revelatory. Faint, echoing harmonies, popping bass, and crisp, finger-
    lickin' guitar swirled in my ears. (In retrospect, I guess technology had a
    lot to do with my infatuation with the album.)  Now, <i>Californication</i>
    sees the same players (John Frusciante and Rick Rubin included) from the
    that album return.  As expected, it's considerably better than the bone-
    stupid <i>One Hot Minute</i>, but not quite as funky- assed as their
    acclaimed 1991 effort.</p><p>
    
    But wait.  Before we go any further, let's talk about Dave Navarro.  Dave
    Navarro was a horrible fit for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Thankfully, he's
    off in some private velvet- paneled studio pouring hot wax on his nipples
    and applying mascara.  Look up ""wannabe rockstar"" in the dictionary and
    you'll find a picture of Dave Navarro's pierced nipples and school- of-
    Depeche Mode black nail polish.  So, weighing in at a stunning 85 pounds,
    the band's former guitarist John Frusciante and his quavering, pasty,
    skeletal body rejoined for the <i>Californication</i> sessions.</p><p>
    
    In his off time from the Chili Peppers, John Frusciante recorded a couple
    of drug- induced solo mishaps and had a best- selling Italian novel named
    after him.  The man brings a rucksack of real emotions with his guitar.
    I'll also wager my credibility that he's the best big- time American rock
    guitarist going right now. His fingers can effortlessly switch from the
    pickin' funk of ""I Like Dirt"" to the sculpted feedback of ""Emit Remmus"" to
    the tender, lovely (yes, really, a tender, lovely Chili Peppers track)
    ""Porcelain"" to the clever, stadium- sized solos throughout.  But best of
    all, he makes you forget about that crazy monkey on bass.</p><p>
    
    Eh, but let's face it, the biggest obstacle in your enjoyment of a Red Hot
    Chili Peppers album is horny crooner, Anthony Kiedis. If you can stomach
    lines like ""Go-rilla cunt-illa/ Sammy D and Salmonella,"" ""Up to my ass in
    alligators/ Let's get it on with the alligator haters,"" and ""To fingerpaint
    is not a sin/ I put my middle finger in,"" you're good to go.  If those
    lines make you wince like Pitchfork Editor Ryan Schreiber, keep in mind
    that I pulled those from only two of fifteen songs.</p><p>
    
    In a way, you have to be familiar with California to appreciate Kiedis'
    lyrics.  I mean, Los Angeles is shallow, sunny, fun, and tragic.  So, in
    this age of unfathomably horrible choruses like, ""I did it all for the
    nookie/ The nookie/ So you can take your cookie...,"" ""Because you did my
    homies,"" and ""Bawitdaba"" (a five- spot to anyone who can explain that one),
    we can cut the Chili Peppers some slack.  Plus, the sincere, hook- laden,
    mellow jams of ""Scar Tissue,"" ""Otherside,"" and ""Road Trippin'"" more than
    make up for whatever knuckle- dragging Kiedis executes.  That the Chili
    Peppers even gave us a single you can actually tolerate on the radio should
    be heralded.</p><p>
    
    Longevity in rock music is about as rare as hip-hop spellcheckers these
    days.  The idea of albums has given way to the force- feeding of singles.
    Teens reposter their walls with the face- of- the- moment more frequently
    than undercover advertisers placard boarded- up fences and buildings in New
    York. Basicially, the Chili Peppers are the closest thing we have to a Led
    Zepplin today. If you want quality, commercial, Jeep- stereo, headphone,
    stadium- filling, champion Rock that you can get behind, where else are you
    going to turn?  Not to Eminem, you ain't.</p></div>"|6709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6709-californication/|6.8|Brent DiCrescenzo

    label, was Richard Buckner's <i>Since</i>. A few critics drooled on themselves
    and some heady words of praise were penned, but apart from that, life went on
    as usual. The album had that rare quality that's so uncommon in music of any
    kind-- it was ephemeral, yet firmly rooted in many traditions. You could see
    the points where he started from and see the finished product, but not necessarily
    trace the paths used to get there.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, this masterpiece was released on a relatively unsympathetic 
    major label which gave Buckner very little support in terms of promoting 
    the record.  Basically, they let it die. At his recent performance at
    Seattle's Bumbershoot music festival (which was more like a giant rant
    against the music industry interspersed with some songs here and there),
    Buckner introduced a new song with the words, ""This is a new song... and it
    might turn up on a record someday if I ever run across an honest person in
    the music industry, which should be in about 55 years."" Man!</p><p>
    
    However dubious the future of Buckner's recording career may be, he's seen
    fit to allow Rykodisc to reissue his excellent first album, <i>Bloomed</i>,
    with a few extra tracks to sweeten the deal (as if it really needed sweetening).
    The songs here are more traditional, and more traditionally folk- oriented than 
    much of his later work.  The instrumentation is limited to Buckner's raggedly 
    beautiful voice, his surprisingly elegant guitar work and flourishes of pedal
    steel, fiddle, accordion and the like.</p><p>
    
    Buckner's poeticism is already in full form here-- check the first lines of 
    ""Rainsquall:"" ""As the rain breaks through the branches/ Along southbound 
    forty-two/ The green I grew left us/ Wet-eyed red and bluebird blue."" 
    Throughout the album, Buckner invests these modern folk songs with such 
    personal fire that some of the songs read almost like diary entries and love 
    letters written by some brilliant, half- crazed author. Buckner has the rare 
    ability to pile metaphor on top of metaphor and make it all somehow work out.
    Take ""Gauzy Dress in the Sun,"" for example, on which he croons, ""A gauzy dress
    in the sun/ And a blue moon bloomed... I thought of you, a lake I drink/ And I
    turned lazy, hot and meek/ But the well went deeper, dear/ When you brought your
    water here."" Heady stuff, to be sure, but Buckner's gritty, gravely voice keeps 
    these tracks rock- solid and earthbound, where they might otherwise threaten to 
    float off into the ether.</p><p>
    
    When Buckner veers closer to traditional folk, he invests his songs with an almost
    apocalyptic urgency. ""22,"" a chilling ballad which details the undoing of a spurned
    young lover, creeps up to death's door and has the temerity to peek around the corner
    and report back; ""Emma"" could have just as easily been written in 1894 as 1994, with
    its harrowing detail of a young woman who ""looks like the good lord has given [her]
    up."" It's the personal nature of Buckner's songs that elevates him far above most
    other contemporary folk artists, and it's the timelessness of the bulk of his songs
    that elevates him above almost all rock songwriters. Like Richard Thompson, Buckner
    is an intelligent, literate wordsmith and a borderline brilliant musician, with a
    voice so full of expression and grit that pretty much anything he has to say comes
    out sounding right. And, of course, this was only the beginning.  If you dig
    <i>Bloomed</i>, do not neglect to find his last two albums, <i>Devotion and Doubt</i>
    and <i>Since</i>.</p></div>"|999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/999-bloomed/|8.1|Jeremy Schneyer

This is a completely different beast.
    Over their first couple of albums, June of 44 switch- hit between riff- heavy rock majesty and intricate, heart- melting
    melodicism. Last year's <i>Four Great Points</i> brought a little more to the table with dub and skewed, gut- punching
    punk sprinkled amongst the standard fare. But on their fourth long- player, June of 44 turns the spotlight on the all-
    star rhythm section of Fred Erskine and Doug Sharin, who appear in too many other bands for me to even begin to count.
    This is their album, as they introduce such foreign elements as piano loops, wah- wah bass, keyboards, vibraphones, and
    trumpet to the mix. Erskine even grabs the mic to the album's detriment; his voice borders on the screamy and shaky unlike
    the delicate whisper- harmonies of Sean Meadows and Jeff Mueller. Guitars have been relegated to more of an accessory
    role-- snaking feedback, quiet jangles, and punctuating bursts-- whose function only blossoms on subsequent listens.</p><p>
    
    The true star of <i>Anahata</i> is clearly Doug Sharin. Someone get this guy a Drummy Award. His complex lines can layer
    a one- hand roll, hissing cymbol splashes, a deep groove, and calculated bursts with ease. His electronica- mimicing beats
    gives <i>Anahata</i> a more groove- and- repitition vibe than other June of 44 records. Some moments on ""Equators to
    Bi-Polar,"" ""Peel Away Velleity,"" and ""Five Bucks in My Pocket"" are downright <i>funky</i>. The mature, groove- oriented
    progression follows a similar path of recent Fugazi records, although June of 44 go with a decidedly mellower, moody
    approach.</p><p>
<i>Anahata</i> brings an entirely unique sound to that beaten Chicago indie scene, a feat which alone merits heavy
    accolade. Disparate elements from jazz, funk, and world music are incorporated seamlessly into the dogmatic two- guitar,
    bass, and drum attack. It's a little more difficult of a listen, especially with the disappointing less- melodic vocals
    (Erskine needs to pass the mic back to the pros), but more rewarding in the long run. By far, this is the most uniform
    and coherent record June of 44 has crafted. Only veteran indie stalwarts can pull this off, as they're less concerned
    with haircuts and coffee shops than experimenting with rock. Whether this is a ""new direction"" or one- album experiment
    remains to be seen. Yet, the fact that they can continually keep us on our toes deserves applaud.</p></div>"|4315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4315-anahata/|7.8|Brent DiCrescenzo

    across one of those sound-byte- type quotes from David Bowie where he
    basically said, on the subject of art, that you either like a piece or you
    don't.  He's right, y'know.  You can sit around for days on end in some
    basement apartment smoking opium and launching half- baked theories about
    Russian rockets all jerry- rigged and desperate for funding, but in the end,
    it comes down to ""I like this"" or ""I don't like this.""</p><p>
    
    It's usually
    hopeless to try to convince somebody otherwise when they've decided to say
    ""I like this"" when they should be saying, ""I don't like this.""  And vice
    as they say, versa.  What do you stand to gain from succeeding in that
    argument, anyway?  Unless you're selling mortgages or something.  Music's
    the same way.  I mean, you either like Fleetwood Mac, or you don't like
    Fleetwood Mac.  Nobody wants to hear why-- it doesn't matter why.  ""Why""
    only matters to the people who are selling music-- it's crucial
    demographic info for those people.</p><p>
    
    Personally, over my many years of music fandom, I've developed a similar
    binary system for evaluating bands.  Rather than being coded in terms of
    ""like"" and ""don't like,"" my system is coded in terms of a certain elusive
    state I've taken to calling ""That Feel.""  I'm not positive what That Feel
    is, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, and usually instantly, whether
    or not a band gives me That Feel.  And it's not a scale, y'know?  A band
    can't fall somewhere along the That Feel/ No That Feel continuum.  It's all
    or nothing, baby.  Sink or swim.  That Feel or No That Feel.</p><p>
    
    But what, Mr. Spooky, has this got to do with you?  Very little, I suppose.
    Except this, specifically:  Pedro the Lion gives me That Feel.  Alright,
    that's not much to go on.  Maybe it would help to say that That Feel is
    vaguely melancholy, with no small amount of nostalgia, and a deeply buried
    and even more deeply inarticulate core of faith in something better. Maybe
    it would even help to talk about the band's sparse, sweet, melodic guitars,
    the wide- open spaces between their snare and their high-hat, their
    unassuming but solid bass, and David Bazan's quietly caustic lyrics.  I
    could even spend some time drawing obvious parallels between Pedro the Lion,
    Red House Painters, and American Music Club.  I could comment that this EP's
    last track is the first time in a long time that I haven't found myself
    turned off by overt religion in music.  I could praise the editorial spirit,
    so lacking in pop music, that allows this little 20- minute- long gem to
    remain consistently and uniformly compelling.  Et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>
    
    It's all true, of course.  I just think it misses the heart of the matter.
    Which, of course, is That Feel.  I like Pedro the Lion.  Pedro the Lion
    gives me That Feel.  That Feel is the only important thing.  Don't you
    want That Feel?  Feel That Feel!  Feel it!  And then, sleep.</p></div>"|6213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6213-the-only-reason-i-feel-secure-ep/|8.4|Zach Hooker

    cement porch in her backyard.  In between scratching her ankles and shooing away mosquitos,
    Vicki stared at the Fourth of July night sky, waiting for the local fireworks to begin. The
    fireworks hadn't been that good the past few years. At least, not as good as she'd remembered 
    them growing up back in Milwaukee. The fireworks there had been perfect. This was either due to
    Milwaukee's inherent perfectness or the fact that they were the only other fireworks Vicki had 
    to use as a reference in musings on fireworks. And compared to the Milwaukee tufts of red,
    green, blue, and white, San Mateo's M-80s couldn't hold a roman candle to them.</p><p>
    
    It was a quiet night. Pretty quiet. Hmm... no. It wasn't that quiet. That guy next door was 
    making some kind of racket. Vicki sat up and looked to the fence.  He was moving around in his
    backyard setting up equipment and stuff. What was he doing? Vicki noticed some pole sticking
    up in the corner of his yard. There was one in the other corner, too. Were they lightning rods?
    Vicki got up and walked to the fence, expecting her neighbor to have a mad scientist table in
    the middle of his yard with some half-cat, half-dog creature on it waiting to be re-animated.</p><p>
    
    ""What are you doing?""</p><p>
    
    ""I'm gonna record the fireworks!""</p><p>
    
    ""Ohhh, so those are microphones?"" Vicki understood now, kind of.</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah.""</p><p>
    
    ""Where's the camera?""</p><p>
    
    ""Oh, no camera. I'm recording the sound to put on my next album.""</p><p>
    
    ""Album? You're a musician?""  Vicki jumped over the fence into his yard.</p><p>
    
    ""Careful, there.  Yeah, I am.  I want to use the sounds of the fireworks as background noise
    in a song. I'll probably make it a long last song to close the album.""</p><p>
    
    ""What's your name?""</p><p>
    
    ""Marc.""</p><p>
    
    ""I'm Vicki. What kind of band are you in?""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, it's just me. I record stuff in layers.""</p><p>
    
    ""Doesn't sound like much of a band. Let me hear some.""</p><p>
    
    ""Hold on.""</p><p>
    
    Vicki looked around the back yard. A guitar sat in a chair as if it was waiting for something
    to happen. The fireworks, maybe?</p><p>
    
    ""Here you go."" Marc handed her a discman and some headhphones. ""These are the first seven
    tracks for my new album. I burned them this morning. After tonight I think I'll be ready to 
    finish it.""</p><p>
    
    Vicki put the headphones on and lay in the grass to look up at the sky again while Marc went
    back to setting up.  The first track began-- sounds of ocean waves and seagulls took her back
    to one summer sitting just above the waterline on a rocky beach in Maine. Two notes from a
    keyboard piano drifted through her head like the sound of a channel marker buoy. This was
    followed by sustained organ chords and a soft, strummy guitar. She closed her eyes and it was
    night on that beach in Maine. She was looking for Haley's comet with her dad.</p><p>
    
    ""What do you think?""</p><p>
    
    Vicki turned to look at her dad. Oh. It was her neighbor. ""Uh, it sounds cool.  Really spacy.
    It kind of reminds me of this band my friend Paul always plays. I can't remember what they're
    called. Some Spanish word or something like that.""</p><p>
    
    ""Uh, Yo La Tengo?""</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah. That's it. I think I like your stuff more, though. It seems to go places faster. Or at
    least have an idea of where it's going. I always thought that Yo Tango band was kind of boring.
    But then, I never listened to it under a night sky in my neighbor's backyard. When do you think
    those fireworks will start?""</p><p>
    
    ""Any minute, I hope."" He went back to his microphone setup while Vicki lay back down with the 
    headphones. The tempo of the second song matched the first. As did the third and fourth. Eight
    measure phrases wound around and around her head like the ""Dr. Who"" theme did when she was
    twelve, bringing back memories of nightmares that show brought her every time she watched it.</p><p>
<i>POOOOSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!</i></p><p>
    
    The first firework went off. Marc ran inside to start his equipment.  Vicki watched the light
    fade from the puff of light in the sky. The music had her in a dream. It seemed to fill her
    surroundings without shutting them out, filling all the empty night spaces. She didn't notice
    the rest of the firework display banging above her. She didn't notice other people now coming
    into the backyard. And she didn't notice the mosquito that was back on her ankle.</p></div>"|3825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3825-the-astronauts-are-sleeping-volume-one/|6.9|Chip Chanko

    scene) who don't know, the drummer from the Pork Guys moonlights as a
    techno superstar!  Believe it or not, but when he's not playing New England
    basements, Moby entertains thousands of dopamine- intake- inhibited kids.
    Although his musical output has been varied in sound, it's been predictable
    in emotion and execution.  One can always count on an album full of filler,
    a few buried dance gems, over- thought moods, some preaching, and banal
    new- age tendencies.  It's commendable of Moby to make each album a unified
    experiment, but imagine how great an LP of his career's best bits would be.
    Instead we're consistently left with ""the ambient stuff,""  ""the house
    stuff,"" ""the punk stuff,"" and now ""the blues stuff.""</p><p>
<i>Play</i> opens with the butt- shuffling ""Honey.""  A stuttering bass line
    and thudding piano shouts out ""nas-tee!""  (It also mummbles, ""Fatboy Slim
    does this sort of thing better."")  Picture products spinning over a stark,
    white background.  The next few tracks keep up a sweaty, soulful pace.
    ""Porcelain"" tenderly glides down throats like lithium.  ""South Side"" is
    the closest Moby has come to writing a radio- friendly pop song.  ""Why Does
    My Heart Feel So Bad"" asks just that in an ad nauseum sample loop over some
    hip-hop beats, syrupy synthesizer, and blues guitar.  Okay, so what we
    have so far are the makings of a great EP.  But from here on out, the album
    deliquesces into a warm puddle of generic ambient, techno, and trip-hop
    (mostly ambient).</p><p>
    
    The throbbing ""Machete"" rips off Underworld as much as legally possible.
    The somber ""7"" offers only brief respite from higher dbs and bpms. Moby's
    flaw is that he comes across as too genuine-- too wholesome.  <i>Play</i>
    tries to juggle an academic love of music history, a primal desire to
    groove, a uniform movement towards the ""peaceful"" and ""beautiful,"" vegan
    manifestos, and studio wizardry.  Thus, we are left with the aural
    equivalent of a ""For Better or For Worse"" cartoon or a romantic comedy.  If
    only Moby would tip the scale in any one direction.</p><p>
    
    The sampling and processing of passionate folk and blues roots music drains
    whatever emotional ballast kept the music so spiritually afloat; although,
    this is more of the fault of innate digital recording techniques than Moby's
    talent.  A performance loses raw magnetism after being chopped up in
    ProTools, cut from its atmosphere, cleaned, and gutted from its
    accompanying guitar.  After this process, the blues on <i>Play</i> become
    nothing more than a quirky sample.  The fact that he added gobs of
    synthesized mayonnaise doesn't help, either.  </p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>Play</i>'s best moments are 100% Moby.  Y'see, Moby has
    talent.  What he needs is an editor and some of that good ol' fashioned
    Pork Guys punk energy.  Without those essential ingredients, <i>Play</i>
    offers only one intriguing listen.  In short, it's fun and functional, yet
    disposable: <i>Play</i> is the condom of rock.</p></div>"|5344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/|5.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

This would explain the sudden appeal of mushrooms,
    baseball, coffee, and Brit-pop a few years ago. And I believe it was in a Cellular Biology class where I learned that
    every seven years the molecules that constitute your body are completely renewed. That's pretty cool. Not one single
    atom that made up ""you"" in 1982 was there in 1989. This could explain the lifespan of widespread clothing fads, such
    as grunge, baggy pants, bellbottoms, and hippy scraps. Think about it: the Beatles lasted... oh, around seven years.
    These two scientific theories must correlate.</p><p>
    I have my own theory that involves a little more ontological thought.  Trapped into each atom in your body, floating in
    that vast subatomic void between shooting-star electrons and deeply peaceful neutrons, is a little piece of your soul.
    As new atoms spin and crash into your mass, knocking off and replacing older chunks, you pick up tiny fractions of other
    souls. In seven years' time, enough broccoli-loving souls may have plummeted into your originally- broccoli- hating
    system of souls to make you a broccoli freak. The question is raised of why these new souls don't completely make a new
    ""you."" Why wouldn't the millions of soul-nuggets you pick up knock your original being into others, the air, space, etc?
    Well, they do. Old pieces of you are now a nebula or German or plantain. But these new soul pieces are greatly outnumbered
    by your original soul, and they taught how to be ""you"" while still keeping elements of their old entity.</p><p>
    Now, you may be wondering where this idea is heading in relation to a Caetano Veloso review. Seven years ago, I was
    listening to Helmet, Fugazi, Firehose, and punk rock in high school. If you had told me that in 1999, I would be falling
    in love with a Brazilian album, I would have put a steel-toe in your glutes.*  But here I am, telling you that if you
    buy any international album this year, or buy any album this week for that matter, make it Caetano Veloso.</p><p>
    I would expect two questions to be raised by the reader at this point: first, ""Where did you pick up atoms of Brazilian
    souls?""; second, ""Why don't more peoples' tastes drastically change? For example, Brent, a suburban white girl who liked
    New Kids on the Block in her youth has subsequently gone through stages of Billy Joel, Sponge, Hootie, Live, Barenaked
    Ladies, and Dave Matthews Band fascinations-- she's not exactly jumping off the mainstream radio ship."" I can answer
    those questions with one answer: I've traveled quite a bit in my time. I've entered nine foreign countries and have been
    in a good number of international airports. My hometown of Atlanta also hosted the 1996 Summer Games, where countless
    Brazilian and other South American peoples popped up to root for their long-distance runners and ""futbol"" players. A
    kid from Ecuador roomed across from me in college. I got my international soul molecules in those instances, where as
    that Hootie-rock girl has most likely never left the safe confines of Wisconsin malls and sorority houses. She's just
    getting soul molecules much like her own. </p><p>
    Of course, there's another explanation. Perhaps on each copy of <i>Livro</i> dwell sunny, tropical molecules from Caetano
    himself. The soul of a musician with such happy passion can generate enough escape velocity energy to send his soul
    satellites and probes rocketing from pore and mouth. They are kept safe in the disc until you crack it open and release
    these Caetano soul astronauts through headphones, shooting them down your cochlea, surrendering to them your brain and
    feelings.</p><p>
    I'm trying to imagine Ryan Pitchfork's reaction when he reads that I gave a Brazilian disc a 9.0. Ryan once told me that
    he hates World Beat. Ryan, baby, this isn't World Beat! This isn't some bongos n' acoustic jam off a Starbucks ""Music From
    the Countries We Exploit for Beans"" sampler. Caetano Veloso's style has been tagged ""Afro-Brazilian"" by genre freaks such
    as the All-Music Guide. That is to say that African rhythms fuse with sorrowful, minor-key Portugese fado and traditional,
    breezy Brazilian Bossa Nova. </p><p>
    Don't worry, though, there are several reference points for indie-rock Americans. An air of
    Burt Bacharach wafts throughout songs like ""Livros"" and the opening track, ""Os Passistas."" Effortless strings and
    arrangements sweep over popping percussion. You can even hear the rhythms of Tricky or Bjork in ""Livros,"" with its
    happily loose loops and rolling snares. The vibraphone, xylophone, and slow- plucked zither on ""Um Tom"" would fit perfectly
    on a Tortoise album. But unlike Tortoise, Veloso injects his delicate jam with soul, warmth, and his cottony, cherubic
    voice.  After being bogged down with piles of stale rock at our Pitchfork apartment, these wonderfully alien rhythms and
    graceful guitar pluckings are a savior. </p><p>
    I have to admit that I've been in a bit of a funk recently. Hospital bills, car thefts, accumulating rent, credit card
    debt, lame job, no girlfriend-- it's been adding up. But for the one hour I sipped on Caetano Veloso's aural absinthe
    through my headphones, I had a beaming smile and all was forgotten as I listened to the swirling layers of handclaps,
    drums, guitar, strings, and Brazilian tongues. And honestly, ever since then I've been a happy chap. (That's so sappy.
    I hope I made some of you wince.) This disc will also do it for audio freaks out there into complex compositions, detailed
    production, and original chord phrasings. The guy fills the ""brilliant"" clich√©. But this album is just so <i>happy</i>.
    Of course, for all I know, he's singing about dead wives. Somehow, I doubt it.</p><p>
<i>[* Actually, this is an exaggeration of how tough Brent really was in high school. In this situation, Brent would have most
    likely mumbled ""Nuh-Uh"" and run down the hall, flailing his forearms like a sissy. He also never wore black boots, but
    beaten-up Airwalks. -Ed.]</i></p></div>"|8428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8428-livro/|9.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

    I'm sorry I missed class today, but I was passing a kidney stone and
    then my dog was sick, too.  Here's my five paragraph essay assignment.
    I know we were supposed to write about a book that we really like, but
    I couldn't think of one so I wrote about my favorite CD.  I hope that's
    OK.</p><p>
    
    Thanks,<br/>
    Toby</p><p>
<b>Why I Like the Chemical Brothers</b><br/>
    by Toby H.</p><p>
    
    One CD that I really like a lot is by the Chemical Brothers.  The name
    of the CD is called <i>Hey Boy Hey Girl</i> and it is really only a single
    from their most latest album.  The reasons that it is such a good CD are
    that it has a lot of phat beats and sweet noises, but it also has a lot
    of symbolism.  There are three songs on the CD.</p><p>
    
    The first song is called ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" which is also the name of
    the CD.  This song starts out kind of plain, with just a guy talking over
    some sorta siren-y noises.  The guy says ""Hey boy, hey girl... something
    something... DJs, here we go!""  He says that over and over, like about
    more than 10 times, and you'd think that you would get tired of it but
    you don't, because it sounds so cool.  Then after he says ""Here we go!""
    the last time, that's when the beat kicks in.  I think that's really
    deep, because he says ""Here we go!"" and then the song starts to go.</p><p>
    
    But my favorite part of the song is when in the middle, the beat kinda
    goes away and there's a soft part of the song.  During that part there's
    just the high music parts and it sounds like it's getting farther away and
    then getting close again.  I think the symbolism of the song is that boys
    and girls seem like they're different but then maybe they're not as different
    as you thought.</p><p>
    
    The second song is called ""Flashback.""  This song sounds different from
    the first song, because the first song is a party jam type song.
    ""Flashback"" is a fast song too, like a party song, but it's more
    serious.  It's a little bit scary sounding, and it's about how drugs
    can make things scary, I think.  The only words are of a chick who's
    saying ""flashback"" over and over, just like in the name of the song.
    Only she's kind of whispering it so it sounds creepy.  The music is
    really weird and trippy sounding and there is symbolism of somebody
    who is having a flashback from drugs.</p><p>
    
    The third and last song is my favorite song on the CD.  It is called
    ""Scale.""  There are no words in the song, but it is cool because the
    music is of somebody playing a scale, which is what the title means.
    This song does not have the same kinds of big beats that the other two
    songs have, but it has lots of different parts.  It sounds like there
    are two or three different scales that get played.  All of the scales
    go up and not down, which I think means something.  This song is really
    experimental, and it reminds me of my other favorite band, the Alan
    Parsons Project.</p><p>
    
    In conclusion, <i>Hey Boy Hey Girl</i> is a good CD because it is good to
    dance to, or just to hang out to while drinking some brews with my house
    brothers, or even to study to, but it is mostly good because of its
    many meanings and symbolism.</p></div>"|1415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1415-hey-boy-hey-girl-ep/|4.8|Zach Hooker

    Descended from the ancient guardian spirit, the Hidden People come in many forms.  The tiny
    bl√≥ma√°lfar dwell in flower blossoms while the common b√∫a√°lfar reside on farms.  Even in this
    modern age of cellphones and helicopters, Icelanders continue to believe that the Hidden People
    are still out there somewhere.  Construction workers even curve roads around rumored dwellings
    of the Hidden People.  How can a modern people find faith in such fantasy?  A heavy cloud of
    Norse mythology and a breathtaking raw landscape explains much of it.  The indigenous music
    of Sigur R√≥s can only perpetuate such a religion.</p><p>
    The album begins submerged.  Sonar pings echo from liquid feedback, invisible in a handful,
    but crushing you like an ocean in its volume.  A cathedral organ moans.  Wire brushes drum
    in a sinking pace.  A violin bow saws open the maw of massive guitar, spreading noise in
    clouds of blood.  Siren J√≥n Th√≥r Birgisson sings through every orifice-- including gills,
    perhaps-- creating the most inhuman vocals ever heard in rock (though Skywalker Sound could
    attempt a Chewbacca-esque approximation by blending whales, Jeremy Enigk, cherubs, Bj√∂rk, and
    the blue alien from <i>The Fifth Element</i>).  The song ends in an accelerating heartbeat
    that breaks into palpitations.  Sound fizzles out.  You've died.</p><p>
    A string section waxes as the album moves from ""Svefn-G-Englar"" to ""Star√°lfur"".  The chamber
    instruments flutter around skeletal drums and sepulchral bass.  This music tethers to
    touchstones in classical as much as Radiohead, like Orff composing ""Carmina Burana"" for e-bow
    at absolute zero.  The song breaks into brittle acoustic interludes where Birgisson's vocals
    frost through your speaker.  Yet like Icarus triumphant, the album keeps taking you higher
    (or deeper, depending on your perspective).</p><p>
    ""N\xFD Batter√≠"" opens with a disjointed band of muted horns.  They deliquesce into chrome swirls
    of tinnitus and massaging bass.  Eventually, the song erupts in flaking layers of hissing drums.
    Subtle bebop drums and Kjarten Sveinsson's fatty rhodes pianos kick up dust on ""Hjarta√∞ Hamast""
    while Birgisson rubs the sleep from his eyes.  ""Olson Olson"" is simply the most soul-crushingly
    beautiful piece.  This elfin masterpiece unveils Mogwai's troll-rock for its soulless academics.</p><p>
    To term this music ""post-rock"" would be an insult; Sigur R√≥s are pre-whatever comes this century.
    Piano, flutes, tremolo, horns, feedback, and that godly amazing voice scrubs souls pure with the
    black volcanic sands from the beaches of V√≠k.  Birgisson's invented lyrical language of Hopelandish
    may be crying in tongues or even plain gibberish, but sheer emotions like this cleanse as universally
    as sodium laureth sulfate.</p><p>
    Sigur R√≥s make this bombastic claim on their website: ""We are simply gonna change music forever,
    and the way people think about music. And don't think we can't do it, we will.""  The fact that
    they've scored hits in Iceland with this spectacular orchestrated soul speaks of both their
    power and the credibility of the natives.  The alien angel fetus pressed in blue ink on the
    cover serves as the perfect logo.  Sigur R√≥s effortlessly make music that is massive, glacial,
    and sparse.  They are Hidden People.  Children will be conceived, wrists will be slashed, scars
    will be healed, and tears will be wrenched by this group.  They are the first vital band of the
    21st Century.</p></div>"|7151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7151-agaetis-byrjun/|9.4|Brent DiCrescenzo

I'm writing this review on a
    bellyful of Cocoa Pebbles and its accompanying cocoa- stained milk. The
    Cleveland Browns used to be pretty good. I had a St. Louis Browns fitted
    ballcap back in high school because my grandfather told me that they once
    put in a midget batter. But when it comes to music, brown-- or any of its
    shades (khaki, tan, taupe, burnt sienna, etc.)-- is the last color I want
    to hear.</p><p>
    
    The Stereophonics just sound very brown, and in the worst way. As
    Shakespeare's Benedick proclaims in ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" ""Why,
    I'faith, methinks [<i>Performance and Cocktails</i> is] too low for a
    high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great
    praise."" Exactly! Shakespeare knew what I was talking about. Listening to
    <i>Performance and Cocktails</i> is similar to sucking on a folded up pair
    of Gap Khakis. The title alone suggests that the band might be in the
    business for the riders alone.</p><p>
    
    That said, there are two types of rock bands that come from Wales. The first
    and more exciting faction is the goofy psychedelic pop front with the Super
    Furry Animals and Gorki's Zygotik Mynci. Those bands slip into their native
    tongue occasionally, weaving a slight mystical, elven vibe. Pompous stadium
    rock bands constitute the second bunch of Welsh rock groups. The Manic
    Street Preachers lead this pack, with the Stereophonics trailing some
    millions of records behind in sales figures.  But at least the Manics
    manage to infuse feelings of ennui and burnt- out intellectualism into
    their arena rock, which perhaps comes from the fact that one of the band's
    founding members used to carve stuff into his arms with razors before
    disappearing into the Himalayas a few years ago. The Stereophonics manage
    to infuse, well, lots of brown and tan into their music.</p><p>
    
    Listening to <i>Performance and Cocktails</i> makes you raise a pint in the
    air, throw an arm around a mate, wear a soccer flag as a cape, and remin...
    um, nah.  It makes you nod your head and remark, ""Yep, this is rock music.""
    Strangely, these guys sound both extremely British and extremely American.
    Kelley Jones' gusting sneer mixes the whiny drawls of British chart- toppers
    with the over- the- top alterna- crooning of American wannabe- chart-
    toppers. Fittingly, his lyrics straddle that Atlantic line between England's
    vapid ""everybody feel good"" rock poetry and the insipid storytelling of
    Yankee FM radio.</p><p>
    
    In the opening track, Jones belts out, ""Roll up and sheeee-ine."" ""Shine"" is
    the official meaningless, overused word in Britrock.  Of course, it could
    be worse-- he could rhyme it with ""mind,"" (the second most meaningless and
    overused word in Britrock) like so many Noel Gallagher tracks.  The song
    ends up sounding frighteningly like a trans- oceanic hybrid of Oasis and
    the Verve Pipe, and nothing good can come from that congress. What two bands
    does ""The Bartender and the Thief"" bring to mind, you ask?  Simply enough,
    Our Lady Peace and Supergrass.</p><p>
    
    The album continues with an overwhelming assault of whines and chords that
    neither stick nor particularly rock. The production tastes like Guinness
    (which, okay, is Irish)-- roasted, bitter, and heavy.  They also stick with
    the Britrock standards on the guitar tracks, which invariably sound like
    distorted lead or acoustic tin.  Again, Benedick said it best: ""Is it not
    strange that sheep's gut should hale souls out of men's bodies?"" I mean,
    maybe at some point, aggressive strumming and its resulting volume
    corresponded to emotional outpouring, but let's face it: we've heard this
    stuff a hundred times before.</p><p>
    
    Basically, what <i>Performance and Cocktails</i> boils down to is loud music
    engineered and crafted for Britain's summer festival circuit that practically
    guarantees a perennially muddy experience. Picture it: as the Stereophonics
    chug soupy chords from the main stage, skinny drunk kids line up for the
    Portaloos, caked in brown.  There you have it.</p></div>"|7507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7507-performance-and-cocktails/|4.4|Brent DiCrescenzo

    the laughing Buddha, cackling in my basement that set it off.
    Or it could have been the cheese curds.  Or possibly, it was
    the kif... but at some point in the two years since I wrote
    the Pitchfork review of Banco De Gaia's <i>Big Men Cry</i>,
    Toby Marks went from soundtracking my walk through Wal-Mart,
    to orchestrating my synapses.  (If you're not following this,
    it's only 'cause you haven't read the aforementioned review,
    which can be found, as always, in the Pitchfork review archive.)</p><p>
    
    I had this velvet poster and a blacklight, and I touched it,
    and it was like... wow, man!  The sounds of Banco De Gaia
    emanated from the speakers, dragging my brain around by its
    stem and slapping it into the corners of the room with layer
    upon heavy layer of percussion, chanting, lilting melodies.
    Everything was syncopating into weird textures like a fine
    Sumatran dish, the seasonings plugging me deeply into its...
    oneness.  And it didn't stop-- no, it didn't stop.  Not today,
    not now or ever.  Whenever I heard it, it plugged me back in
    and the sound overcame me.</p><p>
    
    I guess some would lump <i>The Magical Sounds of Banco De Gaia</i>
    in with ""techno.""  Penetr8ing Gaze Man would surely call it techn-o.
    But it's so organic, so natural and flowing.  But it doesn't qualify
    as ambient, either.  It's not just a flow of mysterious frightening
    notes meant to be a backdrop to daily life.  I mean, it's like that,
    but not really.  Better, really.  Really better.  [Lay off the crack
    pipe, James! -Ed.]</p><p>
    
    And sometimes it makes me laugh, I hear the frogs singing and the
    evangelists shouting for their souls and the rainforest birds calling...
    and I don't know what it means that Banco is plugged into my personal
    rhythm... I just don't know, but it can't be bad.  It's eclectic and
    dense, filled with bits I'll wouldn't understand, things I couldn't
    understand, things I <i>shouldn't</i> understand.  Like the soft grey
    thing that rides around in my skull and comprises most of what I
    believe to be my personality.</p><p>
    
    No, it can't be bad.  Toby Marks is just tuned in, operating at
    precisely the right bandwidth.  No, not bandwidth-- he's in
    geosynchronious orbit.  Yeah, two spheres circling one another,
    grokking off their magnetism, acting and reacting, the rhythms,
    the chants, they fill my mind... so much confusion... so much
    harmony...</p><p>
    
    I remember that <i>Big Men Cry</i> review I wrote and the letters
    people sent.  They said they liked it for the most part, and that
    was nice, but maybe I missed the mark.  Maybe Toby was creating
    something deeper than I even knew.  But the letters made me very
    happy and if you wrote one, thank you now, thank you then, and
    thank you forever, good people.  I speak to you now: know that
    <i>The Magical Sounds</i> has a little more juice to it.  Know
    that it's a little heavier in the beats.  But also know that I
    miss Dick Parry's sax. I'm tuned in-- don't get me wrong-- but
    the sax on <i>Big Men Cry</i> is what turned it into something
    truly special.  Yeah, this is another great Banco album, and it
    has reached me as few electro albums can.  So, I say now, ""Dig
    it.""</p></div>"|540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/540-the-magical-sounds-of/|8.0|James P. Wisdom

Carbonated drumbeats provide a smooth, soft, cocoa-buttery
    surface like a well tanned midriff.  It spreads out between a tight cotton tee and a pair of skin-squeezing jeans with
    the top few buttons haphazardly loose, allowing singer/pin-up Sharleen Spiteri's voice to dance across it like
    the brushing of delicately painted fingernails around the navel and upper pubis. A deep, discotheque bassline fills the
    sound nicely like two handfuls of pillowy, grade-A breast inflating the top of a red tanktop. A six-figure studio budget
    paints a shimmer over the sound like an iced- tea- colored tan, grains of fine, white sand, and tongue- tip- sized beads
    of sweat. Spiteri's seductive falsetto slips effortlessly between post-coital, bangs- in- face tease and professional
    puckered, glossy, slightly-separated lips like a Revlon commercial- tailored blend of Natalie Imbruglia, Prince, Donna
    Summer, Everything But the Girl, and a sultry Suede.</p><p>
    ""Summer Son"" bounces along like two-toned buttocks frollicking under a silk skirt, while the title track slowjams
    erotically like Spiteri rubbing down her body with her eyes closed, lips blooming to reveal marble teeth and a sentient
    tongue.  Well, no.  Really, there's more to this ""music"" than the singer's looks. Really. Stop looking at that.

I'm not     too familiar with the Ex, but I understand them to be hyper-political band     from Holland of, I believe, either anarchist or Marxist orientation. Oh,     and they rock. This alone makes the pairing with Tortoise-- who seem to be     getting colder, slicker and quieter with each album-- a little odd. But the     alliance, though strange and probably pointless in the long run, does make     for a relatively intriguing listen.</p>
<p>""The Lawn of the Limp,"" an abrasive instrumental in which we get to hear     the members of Tortoise rocking out with something approaching balls, opens     the record. Here, as on the bulk of the EP, it seems as though the Ex side     of the equation presides. Ditto for ""Pooh Song,"" a screaming rant with some     real bite that's impossible to imagine on a Tortoise album. And the truly     bizarre ""Central Heating"" has what sounds like a muted Miles Davis solo     being annihilated by brutally heavy guitars. This spread is crunchy, not     smooth.</p>
<p>""Pleasure As Usual,"" on the other hand, is more in the traditional Windy     City vein, with a throbbing bass and plenty of space; in fact, it bears a     strong resemblance those early Tortoise 7""s that had vocals and sounded     like Slint. Likewise, ""Huge Hidden Spaces"" begins with some DJ-ish tape     manipulation, and generally meanders in a more pleasing ambient vein.     Overall, this is something I imagine Ex fans will dig a little more     heavily; but truthfully, I doubt even they won't be throwing it on five     years from now.  Well, what did you expect from two days of fucking     around in the studio?</p></div>"|8116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8116-in-the-fishtank/|6.2|Mark Richard-San

It wasn't their fault, really, it was mine.
    1992's excellent <i>Foxbase Alpha</i> kept me interested for a while back in the day, but right
    about the time of its release, I got distracted (along with the rest of the country) by the
    apparent triumph of that newfangled alter-native music.  Saint Etienne's dancy interpretation
    of 60's pop was then silently buried under a mudslide of rawk, and I mostly tracked with the
    masses as they followed Kurdt to an early grave.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, the kids of Saint Etienne completely failed to notice <i>my</i> absence.  They kept
    plugging away without me, honing their house- inflected Bacharachalia to a keen edge.  Their
    recent signing to Sub Pop brought them back to my attention, though, and I backtracked from
    last year's <i>Good Humor</i> to find a couple of pretty solid albums.  Sure, their albums are
    largely style- over- substance affairs, but they're exactly what a musical sweet tooth might
    want to hear.  Unfortunately, this <i>Places to Visit</i> EP doesn't quite measure up to its
    predecessors.</p><p>
    
    Here's the problem: it's hard to establish a solid stylish victory with a running time of 21
    minutes.  Sure, it's only an EP, but these six songs just flit by, several of them ending right
    about the same time they really start to work.  And of the six tracks, only three are proper
    songs-- the balance are basically transitional instrumentals.  At least two of the ""proper
    songs""-- namely ""52 Pilot"" and ""Sadie's Anniversary""-- are really excellent:  the former is a
    marimba- filled mid-tempo jam, and the latter a full-on torch song with big, juicy bass and
    an excellent chorus.  The third, ""We're in the City,"" is just a pretty standard Saint Etienne
    neo-disco number (read: it's good but not particularly memorable).</p><p>
    
    The other three tracks-- the instrumental ones-- are really what brings the EP down.  Why?
    Well, because they're so <i>good</i>.  That's right, you heard me.  They're great songs,
    adding an experimental flourish to the sound with supplemental studio trickiness.  They're
    just not developed enough-- they're too short, and the goodness ends up more a tease than
    a truly satisfying listen.</p><p>
    
    If we're lucky, <i>Places to Visit</i> represents the direction Saint Etienne is headed with
    their next album.  Until then, this sampling will likely just leave its listeners frustrated.
    Those who hear it and find themselves wanting more should do themselves a favor and check out
    Combustible Edison's <i>The Impossible World</i>, an album which attempts some similar
    experiments and also manages to sustain them over the course of an album.</p></div>"|6971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6971-places-to-visit-ep/|6.4|Zach Hooker

Gone are the carefree days of
    summer with their summeriness-- pick-up volleyball games and sunburns
    and screaming kids and stinging insects and whatnot.  Days are getting
    shorter, college kids are honing their testbook theft schemes, and
    miller moths are beginning to invade.  All around the world, squirrels
    and chipmunks are frittering away the last autumn ever, gathering nuts
    and nesting material to sustain them past New Millennium's Eve and
    through the Eternal Winter which will soon descend upon us all.</p><p>
    
    If you're anything like me, Autumn is the time when your will to rock
    begins to ebb, just a little bit.  It's a time to wax all introspective
    and shit-- to watch some leaves falling and to think about your own
    mortality.  The weeds grow in your bay laurel's pot, the world refuses
    to behave in the clean and orderly fashion described by mathematics, and
    the universe's possibly inevitable heat- death descend upon us.  Autumn
    is the sad, slowish song that makes all the punks quit moshing for a
    second and lean against each other, panting and sweaty and just a little
    bit wistful.</p><p>
    
    It's a good time for Julie Doiron's latest EP.  I mean, if it were still
    summer and somebody put on <i>Will You Still Love Me?</i>, well, that would
    pretty much be the end of the barbecue, wouldn't it?  You'd grab your
    beer and your corn- on- the- cob and wander off down the block, looking
    for some more rockin' company.  But now there's a chill in the air, and
    we're sitting out on the front stoop, and we're willing to tolerate-- hell,
    even welcome-- a little bit of sparse acoustic songstress action while we
    polish off the keg in relative silence and watch the grill smoke itself out.</p><p>
    
    So. <i>Will You Still Love Me?</i> is five songs, mostly guitar with some
    scattered vibes and bass.  Julie Doiron sings the songs, and her voice
    is pretty even if you have to strain to catch what she's saying.  I caught
    enough to be sure that the lyrics weren't nearly as self- indulgent as I'd
    been afraid they would be.  The songs are short, and if you're not paying
    attention you might not be able to tell when one stops and the next starts,
    but they're very pretty.</p><p>
    
    Of course, some albums really do have limited utility.  This one's great
    for a night in with the cat (or the dog or the hermit crabs or whatever).
    But eventually your Autumnal mood will fade, your will to rock will return,
    and you may not come back to Julie Doiron until next year.  If there is a
    next year.</p></div>"|2403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2403-will-you-still-love-me-ep/|6.8|Zach Hooker

A
    couple of Bud Lights, something to read, and a stack of drone music records
    and I'm fine. But while I'm down with the ambient shit, I've finally
    admitted to myself that I'm not down with Labradford. Plenty of people--
    good people-- drool over what these guys have going on. They speak of the
    subtle beauty of the recordings, the majestic instrumentation, and the
    beautiful structure of the songs. But the bulk of their output to this
    point has bored me, and I'm sorry to report that <i>E Luxo So</i> is no
    different.</p><p>
    
    In theory, <i>E Luxo So</i> sounds like an interesting exercise in musical
    restraint. As a whole, it's even more subdued than its far- from- manic
    predecessors. There's no shift in dynamic range on the record, and there's
    never either an abundance or lack of ""space."" Vocals, which have always been
    spare, have been jettisoned altogether. Subtlety is not only the name of the
    game on <i>E Luxo So</i>, it's the name of the planet the game is played on.
    But while there's certainly something to be said for quiet restraint, it
    can't be defended when the music becomes boring, and that's what happens
    here.</p><p>
    
    It's interesting-- Labradford's music is often described as ""cinematic,""
    and I think that's true if you define ""cinematic"" as ""music best appreciated
    with images."" I can see the songs on <i>E Luxo So</i> playing behind some
    indie film set in the desert outside Tucson, AZ. It would set a certain dry
    mood for the spare drama. But when I think of cinematic music, I think of DJ
    Shadow, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and a host of others whose music is
    rich and complex enough to <i>conjure</i> images, and not just make you wish
    for them.</p><p>
    
    The majority of <i>E Luxo So</i>'s songs consist of variations on western-
    sounding guitar, spare piano, strings, and the occasional treated electronic
    flourish, but it just doesn't add up to much. It soothes but never challenges.
    It's subtly complex but ultimately not rewarding. That said, the beautiful
    gospel- tinged ""Dulcimers Played by Peter Neff, Strings Played"" certainly adds
    up to something, and the treated distortion added to ""By Chris Johnston,
    Craig Markva, Jamie Evans"" (the song- title- as- album- credits gimmick
    is a little painful, of course) sounds interesting surrounded by more
    conventional instrumentation. But all told, there are other people making
    music in this vein, and doing a better job of it.</p></div>"|4618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4618-e-luxo-so/|5.3|Mark Richard-San

Not in
    that they're beast- like-- they don't bear any of the scary child- molester
    vibe of a Mick Jagger or Steven Tyler.  They don't seem to be foul mannered,
    and as far as I know, they don't drool.</p><p>
    
    ""What is this?"" you say, in a thick Hungarian accent.  ""Why you say beess,
    when you say they are no beess- like?""  For those looking for clues as to
    what I mean, I suggest you check out any recording with either of these two
    jazz giant's names attached to them.  Feeling lazy?  Check out the cover.
    Look at Shipp, face contorted in ""I am rocking out"" bliss, arms all tense
    and agile.  Parker's photo on the back is, admittedly not as shit hot.  But
    that's no matter.</p><p>
    
    When I say these men are beasts, I pay them the highest compliment.  These
    are two men whose prodigal talent is so monstrous, it's oughta be put in
    a ""Scary Stories"" book between ""The Girl Who Died of Terror When Her Friends
    Stabbed Her Skirt into the Ground With a Knife in the Graveyard"" and ""The
    Golden Arm.""  Whereas Mr. Wynton Marsalis proceeds to turn jazz into static
    classical music with his note- for- note renditions of Coltrane's early
    standards, guys like Shipp and Parker embody the adventurous spirit that
    made jazz's greats so unique in their time.  Both were involved (along with
    this amazing female drummer whose name escapes me right now) in the last
    staggering Matthew Shipp Trio record which artfully melded ambitious
    melodic phrasing and dissonant improvisation with remarkable ease.  This is
    not the type of stuff that you hear in your bougie coffee house.  And good
    luck trying to fuck to it-- you'll be floored in blissful Hungarian impotence.</p><p>
    
    This time, they've ditched the drums, with the aim of exploring their
    improvisational technique.  Given that there's only piano and bass, you
    might be wondering how interesting this would be.  And admittedly, it's
    not for everybody.  Everybody sucks, anyway.  But what you get is a solid
    collection of wonderful sonic experiments which explore both the limits
    and the possibilities of their construction.</p><p>
    
    Bookended by two skewed takes on traditional songs (""When Johnny Comes
    Marching Home"" and ""Amazing Grace""), <i>DNA</i> is sometimes hauntingly
    beautiful, other times disturbing, but consistently challenging and
    interesting.  ""Cell Sequence"" is a subdued piece guided by Shipp's
    meandering, fluid lines and Parker's punctuated bass riffs.  ""Orbit"" is the
    closest the avant- garde will ever get to funk-- a seemingly dischordant melody
    guided by Shipp's stabbing piano rhythms.  ""Mr. Chromosome"" shows Shipp
    at his most playful, using his piano to make the kind of random, bleeping
    that you'd find in a documentary about cell division.  About halfway
    through, you begin to realize that Shipp must have really fast, smart
    hands.  And then he catches a melody, Parker kicks in with a deft plunk
    on the ol' upright, and just when you're getting into it, there's a
    ferocious mashing of the keys.</p><p>
    
    In an age when improvisation is synonymous with either out- and- out
    wankery or the talent displayed by the guy on ""Sesame Street"" who bangs his

    of a ""progressive"" nature has to sound good while tripping on mushrooms
    inside a planetarium. Laser shows, friends-- that's what textural sounds
    without voices were made for. Too much of the music made by the post- rock
    heavies seems like a mere academic exercise; rare equations mapped out on
    paper but never allowed to drift wild in the true vacuum of space. And then
    there's Cul De Sac.</p><p>
    
    When I listen to <i>Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall</i> I can see the
    projected stars and hear a booming narrator's voice directing me to the
    Andromoda galaxy; I can taste the dry- cap belches and catch the glowing
    exit signs moving in circles, leaving crimson trails behind. It's a wonderful
    thing to find a band like Cul De Sac, who see music as a journey or, if you
    like, as a trip.  One to sign up for.</p><p>
    
    So, what's there secret? What makes <i>Crashes</i> stand out among the boring
    noodlers that have sprung from the indie rock woodwork?  It's the fact that
    the sounds they make conjure such clear pictures-- the sound of the cinema.
    The contemporary reference points are easy (Tortoise, Labradford, etc.) but
    Cul De Sac manage to give nearly every piece a special little twist. ""Etaion
    Shrdlu"" begins with a very Eastern, sitar- like guitar sound that builds into
    a rumbling steamroller of a groove, ""K"" twirls hypnotic and beautiful
    guitar lines around each other like a psychedelic pottery wheel, and ""Hagstrom""
    packs the rhythmic punch of early '70s Can.  These songs average in the eight-
    minute range, and it's time well spent.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it wouldn't be an instrumental rock album without a couple of flat-
    out snoozers, and the record has exactly two-- not exactly a bad ratio in this
    genre.  The songs incorporate guitar, bass, drums, synthesizers, autoharps,
    samplers, U.S. Navy practice bombs, human ribs... the list goes on, and damn
    if you can't hear every last detail.  This is music that grows on you, a keeper.
    People, laserarium curators of tomorrow will find that ""Cul De Sac Night"" will
    work just fine in between the early Floyd and Yes programs. I'm there.</p></div>"|1686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1686-crashes-to-light-minutes-to-its-fall/|7.5|Mark Richard-San

    John Cusack and Catherine Zeta- Jones are filming a movie right down my
    street.  I placed a web of red lasers up and down Damen at knee's height
    hoping to see Zeta- Jones' athletically- wrapped booty sliding under them.
    Unfortunately, I've mostly bumped into indie- rock ""icons.""  Like last
    Wednesday when I went to go see ""The Phantom Menace.  Uberproducer
    Steve Albini (who you won't know as the producer of Tar, but more likely
    as the producer of Nirvana and Page &amp; Plant) and his legion of jumpsuited
    studio drones sat next to me.</p><p>
    
    As we waited anxiously for the 20th Centuty
    Fox drumroll we were subjected to the piped MovieTunez that theatres P.A.
    into unwilling, captive ears.  I listened to Albini's comments hoping to
    find a soundbyte to quote for a review.  I wondered what a notoriously
    anti- major label wiseguy (who apparently does not carry his elitist attitude
    over into other media areas, as he was in line on Day One for ""Star Wars"")
    would have to say about the likes of the Dixie Chicks, Train, and Britney
    Spears.  At some point, Ben Folds Five's lastest radio single drifted out.
    Immediately, Albini groaned and chimed in with his faux- Folds falsetto ""I
    am laaame!""</p><p>
    
    Ho ho! I didn't need Albini's reassurance to sway me into assailing Ben Folds
    latest offering, but it was nice to know that someone else was on my side.
    You can figure out what every note on this album will sound like faster than
    you can spit out the forgettable, awkward title.  <i>The Unauthorized Biography
    of Reinhold Messner</i> sounds like a droll A&amp;E; special.  Fittingly, Ben Folds
    now markets his buttery pop towards that same A&amp;E; demographic of old white people
    and lazy college kids who believe they're getting art.  The song that Albini sang
    along to (which was called ""Army,"" not ""I am Lame,"" as previously suspected)
    sounded like a cross between bad Billy Joel and Vaudeville.  Let me repeat
    that... <i>Billy Joel</i>.  <i>Vaudeville</i>.  This doesn't even come close to
    touch ""good,"" friends.</p><p>
    
    Some attempt to throw credibility at Ben Folds simply because he's-- gasp--
    playing a piano.  Ben Folds still sprinkles his lyrics three albums into his
    career with a ""redneck"" here, a ""mullet"" there, and a ""fuck"" every now and
    then and thinks he's a) funny, and b) edgy.  The score is 0-2.</p><p>
    
    The album opens up on a promising note with the over- the- top, Queen-ish
    ""Narcolepsy.""  Big dumb strings, thundering drums, and operatic choruses
    usher in a new direction for Ben Folds.  Quickly Folds retreats to the
    sad, safe sounds of ""Brick"" for the rest of the album, save for a somewhat
    funky ""Your Redneck Past"" (He he!  There's that word again!  He's a reg-u-lar
    Jeff Foxworthy!) and some answering machine message instrumental (those are
    always keepers).  Quite simply, the fart- fuzz bass and twinkling piano formula
    doesn't lend itself to musical ingenuity and variety-- this trio has run out
    of ideas.  Sure, Ben Folds once penned some delicious pop songs.  Too bad they
    were all on the first album.  But let's face it-- tongue- in- cheek artists have
    such a short shelflife.  Amd at least the Dead Milkmen never had their music
    played in elevators and over slides of ""Try a <i>large, delicious</i> Popcorn.""</p></div>"|645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/645-the-unauthorized-biography-of-reinhold-messner/|3.3|Brent DiCrescenzo

    before offering our humble (?) opinions on a product.  Sometimes, blinded by the bad cocaine
    and lulled by the soft caresses of the young playthings record companies keep on sending over,
    we tend to judge music by its first listen and not by its potential staying power.</p><p>
    
    The sad sack of shit reviewer who had the opportunity to review the last Euphone record, the
    <i>Breaking Parole EP</i> suffered from that same moldy dick- cheese way of thinking.  He
    enthusiastically praised the band for its brand of ultra- grooved out instrumental noodling
    without thinking too hard about how permanent his fondness would be.  He liked the tricky
    drumming, the modular bleeping, the smooth, buttery basslines, and thought that would always
    be the case.</p><p>
      
    Having heard all of Euphone's recorded output, I can see where he was coming from.  It's all
    very accomplished, somewhat soulful stuff, and the band's latest work, <i>The Calendar of
    Unlucky Days</i> fits in with the previous work.  Throughout its career, the band has always
    been one of the better sub- Tortoise acts, aided by a certain panache for its playing.  The
    newest offering sees it taking a more subdued, studio- centric approach, using tape loops and
    treated drums to accent the carefully thought- out melodies.  In other words, fans of old
    Euphone will like this.</p><p>
    
    Myself, I'm not thrilled about all this.  This is not to say that <i>The Calendar of Unlucky
    Days</i>, or indeed any of Euphone's other product is bad.  I might put this on at one of my
    slinky booty parties and be lauded for my choice in background music.  Songs like the Stereolab-
    ish ""Wickedness"" and the down- tempo funk ditty ""Needle and Crate"" are catchy indeed, but
    not terribly memorable.  At worst, Euphone takes a slight bassline and plays all the piss ou
    of it, as with the record's closer, ""Playboy.""  One can only do so many organ solos or fancy 
    drum breaks over a melody that seems to go nowhere.</p><p>

You may have 
    heard of Ed Dorn.  He's a fairly famous guy, as poets go, and he's written 
    his fair share of well- known poems.  The first day of Dorn's poetry 
    workshop consisted of him delivering a sometimes scathing and mostly 
    nonsensical monologue that veered from Roman aqueducts to the Russian poet 
    Akhmatova to indigenous North African peoples.  The main thrust was one
    simple point: nobody has written a truly great poem over the course of the
    last fifty years, and if anyone is going to write the one great poem of the
    last quarter of the twentieth century, it was not going to be one of us
    sophomore- year poetry scrubs.  Sorry, it just wasn't.</p><p>
    
    I'd like to take this opportunity to extend Ed Dorn's admonition to the bulk 
    of Pitchfork's readership, and to amend it thusly: neither will any of you 
    write a song as good as Tom Waits' very worst song.  Sorry, you just won't. 
    And to reach the levels of one of his very best songs, you'd have to spend 
    the next twenty years training with ninjas in a high mountain monastery, 
    travel from there to Haiti to have bizarre Voudun rites performed over your 
    writing hand, and then sell your soul to Satan for good measure.  Better get 
    started.</p><p>
    
    So far, reviews of <em>Mule Variations</em> have been mixed, ranging from 
    shameless hero worship (yeah, yeah, like this one), to jaded critics
    claiming that Waits hit his songwriting peak with 1985's <em>Rain Dogs</em>.
    Some guy recently told a friend of mine that he didn't like <em>Mule
    Variations</em> because ""I saw Waits play in San Francisco in the late '80s,
    and I just wasn't that into it, cuz I liked Waits better when he was a
    ballad singer.""  What does that <em>mean</em>?  I have one theory about those
    dissing <em>Mule Variations</em>: they know in their hearts what Ed Dorn and
    I have just told you, and crying out ""He's slipping!"" is a backhanded way of
    claiming equality with one of the world's greatest living performers.</p><p>
    
    Don't listen to the bastards and their sour grapes.  <em>Mule Variations</em> 
    is a great album, and that's all there is to it.  Sonically, it picks up 
    where <em>Bone Machine</em> left off , but drops some of that album's 
    artifice: the clattering, trebly out- back- of- the- shed sound is still
    here and the inexplicable presence of Primus persists, but many of these
    songs find Waits relaxing his krazy karnival barker persona.  The songs most
    people are keying on-- ""Big in Japan,"" ""Filipino Box Spring Hog"" and 
    ""Eyeball Kid"" have been getting a lot of airtime lately on my local college 
    station-- are standard later- era Waits jams, complete with weird rattling 
    percussion and menacing images of hellhounds and mutant children.</p><p>
    
    But the really good stuff here, as with any Tom Waits record, is the slower
    stuff.  ""Hold On"" has a classic ""Jersey Girl"" vibe, and while there may be a
    little lyrical cheez involved, it's exciting to hear a return to that sound.
    ""Pony,"" ""House Where Nobody Lives"" and ""Picture In a Frame"" are ballads that 
    can stand with Waits' best, from earlier tunes like ""Burma Shave"" or
    ""Martha"" straight through to ""A Little Rain.""  The album- closing
    bittersweet mid- tempo rocker tradition has never seen a better entry than
    ""Come On Up to the House,"" and the strange, out- of- phase falsetto backing
    vocals on ""Black Market Baby"" are alone worth the price of admission.</p><p>
    
    It's true that this is not <i>Rain Dogs</i>, <i>Swordfishtrombones</i> or
    even <i>Frank's Wild Years</i>.  But is it Tom Waits' fault that people are
    so hung up on those particular albums?  Look, you've got two options here:
    you can continue to bolster your own nonexistent street cred by dissing new
    Tom Waits in favor of old Tom Waits, or you can give it up, admit that it's
    all great and increase your own personal enjoyment.  The choice seems like a
    no- brainer to me.</p></div>"|8562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8562-mule-variations/|9.5|Zach Hooker

    oeuvre over the last 12 years that arguably makes them the most important band of the
    '90s.  But what they really want the public to know more than anything is that they
    have a sense of humor.  In their massive documentary, <i>Instrument</i>, Fugazi shows
    up on an eighth- grade video- project talk show wearing leather jackets and knit caps,
    answering the questions of a thoroughly nervous teen with notecards and a suburban
    church dress.  Later, drummer Brendan Canty shares with his bandmates how his sister's
    boyfriend believes the urban legand of Fugazi living in a house without heat and
    subsisting on a steady diet of nothing but rice.  They all have a chuckle.  It's
    understandable how this folklore has been spread, since Fugazi's records and
    performances are caustic, stern, and cathartic.</p><p>
    
    Yet <i>Instrument Soundtrack</i>, chock- a- block with demos and studio outtakes,
    sounds remarkably <i>playful</i>.  Heavily instrumental, <i>Instrument Soundtrack</i>
    draws from the <i>Red Medicine</i> and <i>End Hits</i> sessions, their most eclectic
    and emotionally complex records.  These versions decellerate.  A haunted studio echo
    is infused throughout.  For a hissing trip into dub, a watery reverb is thrown over
    the drumtrack from ""Arpeggiator.""  The skeletal Fugazi relies mainly on groovy rhythm
    from Joe Lally and Brendan Canty.  Their masterful intercourse is the backbone of
    Fugazi.  At moments, the songs de-evolve into rumbling live drum-n-bass tracks.  Call
    it analogica.  On second thought, don't.</p><p>
    
    A wonderfully surprising moment of the soundtrack is Ian McKaye's piano pop ditty,
    ""I'm So Tired.""  Heart- breakingly beautiful (yes, beautiful), it shows that Fugazi
    have more talent than their genre can tolerate.  Hopefully, the band will turn punk
    on punk itself and record more sweet pop songs.</p><p>
    
    Like the Washington Monument that graces the cover of <i>In On the Kill Taker</i>,
    Fugazi's music towers, massive and elegant, over all of their peers.  And just as
    the Washington Monument currently stands in repair, covered in scaffolding and tarps
    while still maintaining impressive form and artistic statement, so too does Fugazi's
    music continue to inspire awe in its constructive state.  For all those who worry that
    the Fugazi story may be coming to an end, both ""Instrument"" and its soundtrack show a
    band still growing and, in some ways, just getting started.</p></div>"|3240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3240-instrument-soundtrack/|8.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

I can't help it.  Raised in     a sea of Neil Young's rumbling rockers and rustic ballads, country rock     seems like the natural state of music to me, with other genres and subgenres     bastardizing its bedrock and branching out into the expanse.  As flawed as     I have to admit that feeling is, I have no control over myself.  I'm a     sucker for the harmonica.  Play me a mandolin and I'm as pliable and     receptive as a divorcee in the back seat of her stockbroker's BMW.  (My     friends tell me it's quite a sight.)</p>
<p>So, I should love the latest Old 97's release, <i>Fight Songs</i>. The     band's named after a train, for Christ's sake, and after their clever and     tuneful <i>Too Far to Care</i>, I waited with baited breath for its follow     up.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally-- and mysteriously covered in Bolivian     stamps-- the package from Pitchfork arrived.  Tossing the remainder of the     package's contents somewhere I hope to locate again soon, I grabbed <i>Fight     Songs</i> and shoved it in the stereo.</p>
<p>Now, when the latest breed of country rockers sprung out of who- knows- where     in the late '80s, the critics occasionally called it ""insurgent country,""     other times ""alt-country,"" and, on rare occasions, even ""country punk.""     But what emanated from my speakers that fateful night was neither insurgent     nor alt, and it was most certainly a far cry from punk.  But enough of what     <i>Fight Songs</i> isn't.</p>
<p>What <i>Fight Songs</i> amounts to is a collection of insipidly pleasant,     well- executed pop songs of some distant relation to country and, as such, a     harrowing disappointment.  Gone is Rhett Miller's quirky wordplay-- it's     replaced with platitudes aplenty.  Miller's vocals, a welcome respite over     the edgier tunes gracing <i>Too Far to Care</i>, abets the band's pop     intentions, only exacerbating matters.  The album's opener, ""Jagged,"" kicks     off with a craggy Crazy Horse- lite riff before dissolving into a toothless     wonder, setting the table for what follows.  It's not so much that the songs     fail as a result of their pure pop sweetness, but rather they miss their     marks in their size.  These are very small pop songs.  A great majority of     the album (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Nineteen"" are prime examples here) is almost     unbearably earnest.</p>
<p>Late last year, I fiddled as Rome burned.  While other music writers decried     the industry mergers and feared that the rosters that would inevitably be     cut as a result, I naively assumed that the indie labels would pick up     anything of worth.  Now, irony of ironies, I sit here with this shoddy Old     97's disc-- diligently packaged and delivered by Elektra Records-- while     the latest Luna release sits in import limbo.  Well, at least the three     bucks I get for trading this sucker in will help defray that import sticker     price...</p></div>"|5965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5965-fight-songs/|4.0|Neil Lieberman

    with this one.  Admittledly, the Herbaliser's acclaimed 1997 release, <i>Blow
    Your Headphones</i> was pretty decent, but it was kinda crappy for a Ninja Tune
    record.  The label's known for its innovation in clever electronic music that
    could sport a mild amount of humor and get away with it-- the artists were
    having a good time doing crazy shit with music, and that's what made it so great.</p><p>
    
    Herbaliser, on the other hand, are a weed- obsessed rap duo whose only differing
    quality from mainstream rap acts is that their beats are a bit less sterile.  But
    this isn't really great music.  I mean, I've been stranded in Chicago without
    cable for two months, so I've been getting more than my fair share of new rap
    and R&amp;B; on the Box, and this ain't shit compared to Missy Elliott's ""She a Bitch,""
    Dru Hill's ""You are Everything,"" or even Jay-Z's ""Jigga What, Jigga Who.""</p><p>
    
    When <i>Very Mercenary</i> isn't ripping off better rap and hip-hop acts, they're
    ripping off people like Ninja Tune founders Coldcut (""Wall Crawling Giant Insect
    Breaks"" is as direct a theft of Coldcut's ""More Beats and Pieces"" than you're
    ever likely to find), Jan Hammer (the production on ""Moon Sequence"" sounds
    suspiciously like Hammer's critically- lauded ""Theme from 'Miami Vice'""), or
    labelmate Neotropic (the musical backing for the album's closing track, ""Starlight,""
    could have been pulled straight from <i>Mr. Brubaker's Strawberry Alarm Clock</i>).
    So, if you're considering picking something up off the Ninja Tune label, please,
    for your own sake, steer clear of the Herbaliser.</p></div>"|3830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3830-very-mercenary/|4.2|Ryan Schreiber

    modern music. I think it's the first time anyone's ever recorded an ensemble
    of diarrhea- afflicted Down's Syndrome chimpanzees taking a collective dump
    in someone's garage. They somehow managed to mic each of the chimp's asses,
    slip 'em each a strong laxative with a banana lunch, and then, kerblaam! Lucky
    for you, dear consumer, these tree- swingers squeeze out just enough smelly
    goods to make for an entire album of pure unadulterated shit.</p><p>
    
    To continue the excrement theme, you could say that Old Time Relijun
    aspire to be the musical equivalent of those downtown NYC artistes that
    crap on a canvas, and sell their feces to pretentious art collectors for a
    pretty penny. Although, really, I'm the last one who'll condemn a band just
    because they can't ""play"" in a traditional technical sense. In fact, on a
    daily basis I enjoy all sorts of inherently filthy semi- musical crap:
    Pussy Galore and Jon Spencer, Jandek, the Fugs, the Stooges, the Sex
    Pistols, and so on.</p><p>
    
    On a technical level, though, <i>Uterus and Fire</i> makes an album like the
    Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's exceptionally trashy 1992 debut sound like
    <i>Zeppelin II</i>.  I mean, what sort of tragically hip jerk- off would
    allow these inept fucks to make a CD?  This audacious little twerp should be
    shackled to his stereo system, have headphones duct- taped to his cranium,
    and forced to listen to his brilliant discovery on repeat for a few days.</p><p>
    
    When you get right down to it, these poor bastards don't even try. They
    aren't funny enough to be a joke band. They aren't offensive. Just
    unbelievably boring. The drummer bashes the toms like he's a seven- year-
    old doing a bad imitation of a handicapped John Bonham. The guitar limps
    along on a few repeating out- of- tune notes. The diverse lead singer gets
    into some ridiculous Yoko Ono vocal performance-- that's when he's not doing
    the muffled Jon Spencer- wannabe mouth- over- the- microphone screaming. And
    I guess they couldn't find a shitty enough bass player, because it sounds like
    there isn't any bass whatsoever. Damn that's bold, baby. Oh, and there's lots
    of clueless free jazz sax- blowing, too-- and, boy, it's not annoying or anything,
    trust me.</p><p>
    
    Oh, and hey, I'm glad they didn't forget to mention my favorite part
    of the female anatomy in the album title. That's so cool! Ha, they said
    ""uterus,"" man. Cool. Why not name the next album <i>Fallopian Tubes on
    Vagina Mountain</i>, or how 'bout <i>Enflamed Clitoris</i>?  They could
    even get Adam Sandler to make a guest appearanec.  Y'know, he'll cut a
    gurgling fart in the studio and they can sample it, or something totally
    cool like that.</p><p>
    
    Tell ya what, I'll pay homage to these guys by taking on a similar
    dumbed- down Old Time Relijun posture in closing this review: If de're jus'
    suppose to be a big joke, I just don't get it, y'all! Ah guess dey jus'
    gotta show ever'body just how durn apeshit crazy an' stupid they is! And

I knew Kramer
    from his spacious production on the Galaxie 500 records and wanted to hear
    more of that weeded- out substrata beauty. What I got instead was limp classic
    rock covers (Gary Glitter's ""Rock And Roll Part 2,"" and Zeppelin's ""Dazed and
    Confused"") and histrionic spoken word nonsense in the Maggie Estep vein. To say
    I'd experienced a double bummer was to fall about ten bummers shy. I can safely
    say that I'd rather <i>drink</i> bongwater than listen to that depressing album
    again. Even so, I can still dig what Kramer has done since those days in a
    producer's capacity, particularly his work with Low. And it's his master's touch
    behind the boards that almost redeems his second collaboration with Jad Fair,
    <i>The Sound of Music (An Unfinished Symphony in Twelve Parts)</i>. Almost.</p><p>
    
    The liner notes to <i>The Sound of Music</i> tell us that ""Kramer wrote, performed
    and recorded the music in three days."" I imagine we're supposed to be impressed
    with this act of carelessness, and we even might be if the record didn't sport
    its tossed- off origins so clearly. The Casio drum machine that backs most of
    the songs is much less charming than it is annoying, and in more than just a few
    spots, Kramer's guitar work is reminiscent of a jaded session hack from Orlando.
    But then there's the gorgeous music that backs ""Zorro's Black Whip"" (with a
    strikingly G5-ish backward guitar bit) and the Fat Albert- meets- Gary Glitter
    junkyard glam of ""Elenor"" to remind us what we loved about the K man in the
    first place.  It borders on the tolerable.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, even these tunes have the vocal stylings of Jad Fair mixed
    way out front, and that's a difficult handicap for any piece of music to
    overcome. I'll admit that portions of Fair's oeuvre have their charms--
    particularly the more chaotic early stuff-- but what strikes me most about
    his recent work is just how unpleasant it is to listen to more than once.
    These sing- songy vocal stories might raise on eyebrow or elicit a chuckle
    on first pass, but there is no depth to warrant further attention.  And the
    songs quickly become boring. Very boring. The liner notes also tell us that
    ""Jad Fair listened to the music once, then wrote the lyrics while listening
    a second time, and sang them all in a single day."" No shit.</p></div>"|2954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2954-the-sound-of-music-an-unfinished-symphony-in-twelve-parts/|3.7|Mark Richard-San

    Advanced Dungeons and Dragons mastery, reciting the entirety of ""Star Wars""
    from memory, and listening to new wave music.  And listened they did-- bands
    like the Talking Heads, Blondie and Devo started springing up out of the
    woodwork and the losers ate it up like Toffee bars.  Now, maybe they weren't
    exactly new wave, but the Cars fit the new wave stereotype close enough, and
    the geeks enjoyed the simple but catchy pop arrangements, the spastic moog
    effects, and the head- bobbing fun of the band's music.</p><p>
    
    As we all know, the world's population of geeks had their two hours of glory
    last night when theaters everywhere opened their doors at midnight, letting
    millions of rabid fans in for the first full showings of ""Star Wars, Episode
    One: The Phantom Menace.""  But clearly, all the hype of the new ""Star Wars""
    film eclipsed the release of Rhino's <i>The Cars: Deluxe Edition</i>.  Were
    it 1978, those kids'd be all over this shit.  Eh, it's just as well.</p><p>
    
    See, the Cars were great in their time.  The scene needed them.  They bridged
    the gap between the Ramones and Elvis Costello.  They were important.  But these
    days, they're remembered more as predecessors to Weezer's brand of pop music.
    And listening to <i>The Cars: Deluxe Edition</i>, you can see why interest
    feigned.  <i>The Cars</i> is nice enough to listen to-- you can get into the
    harmonies and sweet, adorable songs, but it seems a bit thin in retrospect.</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""I'm in Touch With Your World"" and ""Don't Cha Stop""
    are, to the say the least, not some of the best songs rock music has
    produced.  Other tracks show the band getting overly playful-- when the drumbeat
    changes toward the end of the classic single ""Just What I Needed,"" it throws the
    song off course and steals some of the glory from its anthemic feel. And ""Good 
    Times Roll,"" while an undeniably great song, occasionally experiences side effects
    like sloppiness and general amateurish- ness.</p><p>
    
    The other problem I've got with this record is that it's a two disc set.  Why?
    Disc one is the original album (all 35 minutes of it), Rhinophonically remastered.
    Disc two hangs around like an unwanted afterthought-- it's all the original demo
    versions of all the songs that made it onto <i>The Cars</i> (except for ""Good Times
    Roll,"" which is a live recording, since they couldn't find a demo version), along
    with five previously unreleased songs from the same period, also in their demo
    formats.  Now, as much as I hate to break it to you, I feel you should probably know
    the truth: these five tracks are just plain bad.  Talk about ""should have been left
    in the vaults!""  These were the songs that didn't get released because the label
    was afraid they might drive the kids to suicide.  Okay, they aren't that bad,
    but trust me-- you don't wanna hear 'em.  (But ""Hotel Queenie"" is especially notable
    for its sheer badness.)</p><p>
    
    Let's face it-- the Cars had their moment in the sun.  Sure, there a couple of die-
    hard fans still roaming the planet, making their own rock music and camping out for
    movie tickets, but it's a rare person that's willing to drop a Jefferson on a nicely
    remastered, beautifully repackaged, two- disc reissue of <i>The Cars</i>.</p></div>"|1319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1319-the-cars-deluxe-edition/|5.7|Ryan Schreiber

    possibly a limey wannabe. It's no secret he's probably worn out many a copy
    of the Kinks' <i>Village Green Preservation Society</i>. But the guy's also
    as sophisticated a pop writer as we've got. And he's responsible for some
    of the stealthiest ripoff artistry since Steve Wynn and the Dream Syndicate
    so cleverly robbed the Velvet Underground's crypt for all it was worth on
    1982's classic <i>Days of Wine and Roses</i>.  Heasley's ransacking encompasses
    almost the entire stylistic sprawl of the '60s on the groove- a- minute shindig
    that is <i>The 3-Way</i>.</p><p> 
    
    Although some critics accuse him of stealing Ray Davies' identity outright,
    Heasley has forged his own multifaceted re-tailoring of '60s mod- rock.
    And sure, Davies' influence looms large over songs like the
    harpsichord- laced ""And One (on One)"" and ""The Spirits Merchant."" And on
    ""The Generator,"" there's some nice piano work worthy of Charlie Brown's
    ivory- tickling pal Schroeder, and some cheeky ""Oye Como Va,"" guitar
    quotes.  To round things out, there's a nod to Mitch Ryder's revved- up
    Motor City car- rock on ""Dimes Make Dollars,"" and the bubbly Lawrence Welk
    jazz of ""Solar is Here.""</p><p>
    
    Oh, and you can shake your ass to some of this stuff, too: in fact, ""Leo
    Ryan (Our Pharoah's Slave)"" is the funky intersection in which James
    Brown's ""Cold Sweat"" might cross paths with the Beatles' ""The Word.""
    Believe me, if you can sit still to this song, your backside's probably
    made of the same lead- like compound as Pam Anderson's former breasts.  
    ""Socs Hip"" may, at first, cause your hips to twist and grind. Then you'll
    get a chance to put your ballroom dance lessons into practice.  The song
    suddenly shifts to the rattling castanets and smooth rhythmic glide of a
    Spanish tango. Then, just as quickly, it regroups and recasts itself as
    pure Standells pop. All throughout <i>The 3-Way</i>, there's a host of
    suprising tempo shifts, rhythm variations, time signature quirks, odd chord
    changes-- none of which seems to really inhibit the innate simplicity or
    forward motion of any particular song.</p><p>
    
    What's wholly original here, though, is the way Heasley arranges and
    incorporates all his filched musical bric a brac: banjo, toy piano, loopy
    Hammond organ, free jazz, harpsichord and cheeseball pastiches of European
    and South American musical styles are all harmoniously grafted onto
    bare- bones garage- rock. And all those big fuzz- guitar hooks are a real
    gas-- some at least as immense as the main riff to Count Five's ""Psychotic
    Reaction.""</p><p>
    
    As we've seen, the Greg Dulli's and Brian Jonestown Massacres of the world
    celebrate the '60s resurgence by throwing gaudy hipster costume parties,
    and buying shitloads of expensive Vox equipment. And, as an afterthought,
    the guys record hilariously bad albums that suck hard no
    matter what decade they're supposed to represent.  For the Lilys, '60s
    references are modeled like so much trendy clothing... which, of course, makes
    for plenty of cut- rate resale material when the fancy inevitably passes. </p><p>
    
    And if the Lily's seem too prim and precious, well, I guess there's always
    the option of buying into all the half- assed greaser rock available out
    there. Or you could force yourself to love the increasingly popular cliques
    of critically- acclaimed avant- noisemakers: you know, those overly- serious
    Lower East Side- dwelling savants who give themselves stomach cancer
    attempting to transform one note drones and pick scratchings into something
    symphonic. Meanwhile, right under our collective noses, Kurt Heasley
    and the Lilys are making off with all the great hooks and still having all
    the damn fun. </p></div>"|4795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4795-the-3-way/|8.6|Michael Sandlin

    ridicule.  After the surprising success of their first record, <i>Attack of the
    Grey Lantern</i>, Mansun have practically abandoned all the key ingredients to that
    record's accolades.  Songwriter Paul Draper dumped the satirical characters and
    simple guitar pop, which was a brave move, if not a stupid one.  Instead, <i>Six</i>
    invents the haphazard genre of glam- prog- space- bubblegum- rock in which rock
    stars in glitter and leather pants play nine- minute bezerk jams.  Surprisingly,
    this album has yet to see release in the States-- the songs change pace so frequently
    and randomly that they'd be perfect for our short- attention spans.  It's perfect!
    I mean, if you don't like a song, you just have to wait about 30 seconds for it to
    completely change.</p><p>
    
    Seemingly influenced by comic books and hallucinogens, <i>Six</i> skitters from
    chugging power- chords, to intricate hooks, to Pink Floyd wandering, to Tchaikovsky
    samples, to lip- licking swagger.  At times they can come off like a frightening
    cross between the Pixies, T Rex, and Yes.  If you give Mansun the benefit of the
    doubt, and assume they're not being completly serious, <i>Six</i> entertains
    immensely, chock-a-block with every element of modern rock.  The fusion sounds so
    weird and seizure- inducing that it sucks you into its pretentious, mascara'd maw.</p><p>
    
    It helps that the four lads rock with remarkable skill.  It's hard to imagine any
    other band pulling off this mammoth epic.  (Well, perhaps Radiohead on a heavy dose
    of prozac and a Cadbury chocolate rush.)  Paul Draper's emotional, spotlight-
    sucking delivery sparkles over Dominic Chad's inventive solos and melodies, as the
    drummer and bassist simply try to keep up.</p><p>
    
    When making a concept album, a band walks the razor- sharp line between Kiss'
    <i>(Music From) The Elder</i> and Radiohead's <i>OK Computer</i>.  With a truckload
    of chutzpah, Mansun walks this tightrope for over an hour, teetering to either side,
    constantly looking to fall off.  From moment to moment they can be ridiculous or
    beautiful, artistic or fluff.  The chills and thrills of hearing them perform such
    a stunt is worth hunting down an import.</p></div>"|5090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5090-six/|7.8|Brent DiCrescenzo

Not to bitch about it or
    anything.  Actually, I think I <i>am</i> gonna bitch about it.
    In Chicago today, it was a murderous 98 degrees (heat index at
    112), which I'm sure is nothing compared to... say... some
    African regions.  However, as I type this, I have two large
    fans pointed directly at my luscious, naked body, and sweat
    is still-- quite literally-- dripping off my shapely 5'9""
    frame.</p><p>
    
    Or perhaps it's the fact that I can't stop dancing to Plaid's surprisingly
    funky <i>Peel Session</i> EP.  Plaid released a terrific album on Warp
    (distributed by Trent Reznor's Nothing/Interscope label in the U.S.) last
    year entitled <i>Not for Threes</i>.  I grooved on that album's ambient
    electronic mayhem and speedy, atmospheric drum-n-bass-- its sound was
    almost orchestral, bringing to mind visions of wide, open spaces and
    uncharted northern regions.</p><p>
    
    This time around, Plaid go haywire.  The record opens with the dancy,
    piano- based ""Scoobs,"" a track that should have even the clumsiest
    clubhopper bumpin' an' glidin' with the best of 'em.  The melody, a
    fine blend of modern disco, jungle breakz and slippery keyboard tones,
    reminds me of my days spent strung out on E and tabs of acid in Ibiza.
    ...Okay, so I've never even been out of the country.  But I can pretend.
    After all, when you're confined to these barrio streets for lack of any
    expendable cash, a dream is your best pal.</p><p>
    
    ""Eph"" is a bit more moody, laying a tinny, reverberatin' harpsichord
    line over a dark and haunting ""Risky Business""- era Tangerine Dream-
    style throwdown.  ""Bo Bootch"" gives us a rugged, slo- motion hip-hop
    beat and some sexy, organic organ riffs.  And the closer, the simply
    titled ""Cold,"" offers up a steamy dish of pure Autechre- influenced
    rhythm.</p><p>
    
    It's hard to know where Plaid's excursions will take them next, so I
    can't say yet whether this is a decent introduction to the band's
    sound.  <i>Not for Threes</i>, as I previously stated, is an entirely
    different affair, so we can only wait and see what the future brings.
    In the meantime, you Plaid fans should grab hold of this disc just
    to see what craziness they've worked out.</p></div>"|6333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6333-peel-session-ep/|6.8|Ryan Schreiber

He performs his songs completely straight-faced, like he's     as serious about his work as Sting is about saving whales.  But the songs,     while always intriguing and listenable, are just too damned weird for there     not to be some tongue- in- cheek value intended.</p>
<p><i>Organism</i> was released earlier this year on the revered electronic     label Warp Records, home to such forward-thinking auteurs as Squarepusher,     Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Two Lone Swordsmen.  And as     different as this album is from the rest of Warp's roster, it somehow     belongs-- like Neil Hamburger on Drag City, Guided By Voices on TVT,     or gospel diva Thornetta Davis on Sub Pop.</p>
<p>Tenor's bizarre blend of earnest, Barry White-style '70s soul, Prince     funk circa <i>Dirty Mind</i>, ultramodern electronic flourishes, and     geeky, Jarvis Cocker delivery is truly disturbing.  Is he serious or     just bein' goofy?  It's impossible to know.  But when the skinny, thick- rimmed-      glasses- wearin' Warhol lookalike lustfully whispers ""I wanna be the     taxi driver who takes you home tonight/ I wanna be every customer in the     diner where you work,"" before belting out ""'Cause I wanna work to make you     love me,"" his computer nerd image comes off as simultaneously sexy and     Triple X sleazy.</p>
<p>Tenor is at his most charming on <i>Organism</i>'s slinky soul tracks,     especially ""Love and Work"" and ""Sleep"" which both draw heavily from     modern ghetto R&amp;B; beats and jazz flute solos from late '60s Quincy Jones     records.  But Tenor's act is far from gimmicky.  The leadoff track, ""Total     Devestation"" and ""Year of Apocalypse"" are thunderous, bass-heavy house     anthems, while ""Xinotepe Heat"" sounds like a cross between Alice Coltrane's     <i>Journey in Satchidananda</i>, Jan Hammer's ""Theme from 'Miami Vice'""     and the soundtrack to the second level of ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2.""</p>
<p>The album's two low points come with the grading ""Muchmo,"" a song that     features a sterile, programmed electronic beat and a vocoder-enhanced     voice-- presumably Tenor's-- endlessly repeating the words ""Much more     psychedelic/ Than any of the drugs,"" and ""Serious Love,"" whose mind-     numbing repetition of the phrase ""Give me something good that'll feed     my soul/ 'Cause you need some serious love to stay happy"" is a little     irritating.  Luckily, these songs are spaced far enough apart on the     disc that they don't really interfere much with the overall quality     of the record.  Besides, the brilliant ""My Mind,"" with its sultry     sax solo and Talking Heads-influenced background chorus, and the     dark futurism of the album's closing number, ""City Sleeps,"" are     perhaps some of the most innovative and original in the entire Warp     catalog.</p>
<p><i>Organism</i> would be an awesome listen on a rainy Spring night in     Tokyo or while cruising Main Street in downtown Anoka, Minnesota on     any given August night in 1983.  Whatever the case, its magic cannot     be truly appreciated while the sun's up.  Reserve for New Year's Eve     Party, 2000.</p></div>"|7973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7973-organism/|8.6|Ryan Schreiber

    sick.  But, hey, let's not dwell on my clammy palms and sick- smelling
    body-- rather, let's approach another album and embrace it in spite of
    my extreme fatigue.
    
    Y'know, kitsch is so lovable when it's done well.  It really is.  See,
    for years, we've been subjected to the nauseating cuteness of Shonen
    Knife, the terribly unsubtle Pizzicato Five, adorable little Cornelius,
    the ethnic absurdities of Cornershop and the grrl power of Cibo Matto.
    At the height of their popularities, these bands could out-kitsch the
    best of 'em, and a few of the bands even recorded great albums.  But,
    as an esteemed colleague of mine recently observed, ""The shit's got
    a short shelflife.""</p><p>
    
    Fantastic Plastic Machine's Tomoyuki Tanaka capitalises on everything
    Cornelius achieved on his 1998 American debut <i>Fantasma</i>, but relies
    on human elements as much as electronic ones.  Where <i>Fantasma</i> was
    unmistakably wacky and occasionally annoying, <i>Luxury</i> is subtle--
    always focused more on the music than the humor.  Tanaka writes great
    music, blending modern sound and technology with classic string arrangements
    and top- notch production.  ""Honolulu, Calcutta"" is one of <i>Luxury</i>'s
    brightest examples of this-- its sound is distinctly 1960s space-noir, with
    a laidback hip-hop beat that transforms it into a catchy and beautiful
    combination of the sounds of two eras.</p><p>
    
    The song that's got everyone's attention is the band's nice arrangement of
    the Eurythmics' ""There Must Be an Angel (Playing With My Heart),"" but it's
    hardly the album's highlight.  The High Llamas- ish ""Bossa for Jackie,"" a
    dedication to the late Mrs. Kennedy, is a tropical breeze of melody (with
    a fresh, pine-sol smell); ""You Must Learn All Night Long"" is simply outta
    control with its speedfreak drum frenzy, its horn breakdown and vocoder
    effects; the dancy ""Lotto"" sounds like a head- on collision between the
    Pet Shop Boys and Stereolab; ""MPF (Mezzo Pianoforte)"" is piano- based pop,
    complete with samples of retro 1950s R&amp;B; quartets singing ""Oh yeah"" and
    a crazy- assed breakdown; and <i>Luxury</i>'s closer, the undeniably

The dreaded Planet Sandlin here again. You
    may be interested to know that Man or Astroman and I have something in common.
    You see, I, too, am from outer space. In fact, as you'll learn from my
    revealing Pitchfork bio, I'm the result of my own Big Bang theory-- or in my
    case, the controversial Barely- Audible Poof theory. I'm my own planet,
    kids. Cool.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, my dense atmosphere naturally yields noxious,
    gassy one- sided opinions and petty prejudices. My world is without gravity,
    fraught with weightless ideas floating freely around themselves-- never
    achieving a coherent, utilitarian message.  A thick force field surrounds
    my outer crust, thus impairing my ability to
    absorb the simple absolute truths much of our universe staunchly abides by.
    Thus, I'm unable to nourish my dry, cracked mindscape. In short, Planet
    Sandlin is a horrendous blight in a galaxy otherwise filled with bright
    stars and shining celestial bodies. But I'll be silent now and forever, in
    order to eternally contemplate my intrinsic ugliness.</p><p>
    
    Booming God- Like Voice- Over: While Planet Sandlin skulks around his pitiful
    axis, we luckily have his only earthly friend, renowned author Stephen
    Hawking's butler, to type a few hundred words about Man or Astroman. Mr.
    Butler, please proceed.</p><p>
    
    Planet Sandlin? What an arsehole! I don't even know him that well. I signed
    my boss's book for 'im once, I think. Nevertheless, I'd just like to say
    that, along with Gary Numan and Peter Schilling, Man or Astroman have been
    one of my guilty musical pleasures for quite a long while. And let me just
    tell you, it's really tough to take the piss out of a band I've enjoyed for
    so long.  I mean, these poor Astro- chaps are from prime alien abduction
    country, Alabama.  Shouldn't they be allowed to have their fun?  Oh, alright.
    They're not from Alabama, they're from space.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, these humanoids from beyond initially landed on our fair planet
    years ago, sometime in the early '90s.  Soon, they abducted the styles and
    sounds of Dick Dale, the Ventures, and Les Baxter, just to name a few. The
    recordings of these uncharacteristically innovative musical humans were the
    subjects of intense study and observation. The Man or Astroman stage act
    quickly became a complex aliens- posing- as- humans- posing- as- aliens
    vaudeville schtick borrowed heavily from other over- caffinated physics- club
    outcasts- posing- as- droids like Devo.</p><p> 
    
    Our otherworldly heroes set out to prove, as guitar prophet Joe Satriani so
    astutely speculated years before, that aliens really do have a deep
    affinity for surfing and the galvanizing music inspired by that particular
    recreational sport. It's one of the mysteries of the universe, much like
    the Black Hole. Why do aliens enjoy surf music so much? In fact, it's the
    subject of my latest book, ""Stephen Hawking's Butler's Guide to the
    Universe."" But enough about that. Man or Astroman show that aliens can be
    very musical, playful, and even have a sense of humor.  They've
    successfully debunked the myth about aliens that Hollywood movies help to
    perpetuate: that space creatures can only be cruel abductors or hostile
    acid- spitting enormities. The Man or Astroman sense of humor borrows many
    camp, lowbrow ideas from American cable TV. </p><p>
    
    In the case of Man or Astroman's latest effort, <i>EEVIAC</i> (subtitled
    <i>Operational Index and Reference Guide, Including Other Non- Computational
    Devices</i>), its failing isn't exactly akin to a botched chemistry experiment
    blowing up in one's face.  Actually, the failing here resides in the band's
    inability to consistently conduct potentially- dangerous experiments with
    their music; or re- program themselves in any significant, visionary sense.
    Their driving percussive attack is still present, and rivals that of
    another futuristic favorite band of mine, Trans Am. And of course, the
    simple pleasures of frenetic wipeout surf guitar are always extant to some
    degree, and to say the least, impeccably executed. </p><p>
    
    Contrary to the hi-tech blueprints gracing the album's sleeve, there is
    little innovative studio quackery to be found on <i>EEVIAC</i>. In fact, the
    album is much more humanized than most of the pre- programmed floppy disk
    claptrap that passes for music in today's society-- much of it sounding like
    it was conceived on some small child's Commodore 64, and then marketed by
    major labels as ""advanced"" or ""futuristic"" music.  <i>EEVIAC</i>'s packaging
    suggests an advanced technological angle that's just not really there.</p><p>
    
    With ""Interstellar Hardrive,"" <i>EEVIAC</i> begins predictably enough, with
    those familiar tsunami waves of reverb- doused surf guitar. Occasionally, our
    favorite martians underpin the songs with Moog burps, or maybe preface a
    song with sampled voice- overs that always have something appropriately
    scientific or nerdy to say. The album does get a tad brittle and industrial
    with ""D:Contamination,"" which could pass for a legitimate fusion of
    trip-hop and surf.  I'm also quite overwhelmed by those overbearing William
    Shatner- esque titles like ""Within the Mainframe, Impaired Vision From
    Inoperable Cataracts Can Become a New Impending Nepotism,"" especially since
    the title just happens to be more interesting than the cacophonous
    space- junk characterizing the song itself.  On ""Fractionized Reception of a
    Scrambled Transmission,"" our extra- terrestrial friends show us they've
    finally happened upon the much- in- demand vocoder device (much like every
    other forward-thinking band in the solar system). As the great vocoder
    avatars Styx would say, I want to thank you, Mr. Roboto, thank you.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes, though, on many a Man or Astroman album, our heroes just seem
    to put themselves on auto- pilot and coast along on a single
    wavelength-- mechanically churning out one similar- sounding surf instrumental
    after the other. And <i>EEVIAC</i> is no exception. On the closing track, ""Myopia,""
    they actually do attempt to deviate from familiar ground. And they do so
    with a mistake that could be heard as ungainly Mercury Rev referencing, or
    possibly, a plodding Galaxie 500- influenced instrumental that's about ten
    minutes too long. A monotonous, unmoving, unlistenable space jam, it rightly
    is, kids. The standout tracks here are the mercifully short ""U-235/ PU-239,""
    and ""As Estrlelas Agora Elas Estao Mortas."" The latter cut proves that, not
    only are these spacemen multi- lingual, but they can also successfully
    transcend the narrow sonic trappings of the conventional surf instrumental
    when they actually try.</p><p>
    
    Sure, Man or Astroman's music still has its
    undeniable appeal. But would respectable paranormal beings allow themselves
    to continue on a redundant and obvious path? Will their fate be marked by
    nothing more than common, earthly mediocrity? Can they reinvent themselves
    without sacrificing the adrenaline rush of great surf guitar instrumentals?
    For the answer to these and other universal questions, we can only look to
    the future.</p></div>"|5064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5064-eeviac/|5.9|Michael Sandlin

    relative of subjects.  Though I may toil ceaselessly to eloquently present
    an album's strengths or weaknesses in support of my opinion, it remains just
    that.  Not even a truckload of obscure album name- dropping can carve opinion
    into fact, and individual readers and listeners are bound to glean from the
    piece a perspective at least slightly different from mine.</p><p>
    
    Take Alejandro Escovedo's latest release, <i>Bourbonitis Blues</i>.  A
    collection of spare ballads and country- tinged rockers from the estimable
    Texan songwriter, <i>Blues</i> has been garnering high praise from those who
    know for a couple of months now.  ""A splendid release acquitting Escovedo's
    growing reputation,"" they write.  ""His cover of 'Pale Blue Eyes' is a bold and
    unmitigated success,"" I read.  But what I hear is a little bit different.</p><p>
    
    The album lacks the focus of Escovedo's previous work, primarily due to a
    sprinkling of poorly chosen covers.  ""Irene Wilde"" is interesting, but
    ""California Blues"" needs some oxygen.  Escovedo plays Russian roulette with
    the aforementioned ""Pale Blue Eyes"" and, unfortunately, catches the bullet
    R.E.M. fortuitously avoided in the '80s. (Lesson here for the kiddies:
    despite their appearance, Lou Reed songs are not toys and must be handled
    with extreme care.)</p><p>
    
    These covers idle at the expense of a handful of hard- charging originals.
    Escovedo exercises his potential and the album finds its success with
    shimmering smokers like ""Guilty"" and ""Everybody Loves Me,"" while the earnest
    confession, ""I Was Drunk,"" showcases his quiet side.  Unfortunately, the songs
    aren't strong enough to bear their heavy burden and what we're left with is
    a pleasant album that doesn't reach quite high enough to pass the benchmark
    already set by Escovedo's previous work.  Of course, you might feel differently.
    But, that's the game, brotha.</p></div>"|2831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2831-bourbonitis-blues/|6.1|Neil Lieberman

    stairs into my basement workshop.  Startled awake in the wee hours by
    the otherworldly sounds, I'd grabbed the nearest vaguely weaponlike
    object (a french press from the kitchen counter), steeled myself for a
    confrontation, and started downstairs.  My knuckles whitened around the
    handle of the french press and my breath caught in my chest.  It sounded
    like several hundred Speak- and- Spells were going haywire down there--
    bleeps and whines giving way occasionally to jumbled and unintelligible
    words.</p><p>
    Crouching, I reached the bottom of the stairs.  The Speak- and- Spell
    noises careened past me like bats erupting from a cave at dusk.  I
    paused to gather my strength and stepped into the main room.  As I
    rounded the corner, I was met with a sight that struck me dumb and
    loosed the useless french press from my slackened fingers.</p><p>
    The source of the eldritch sounds was not Speak- and- Spells at all-- it
    was Speak- and- Maths, and more of them than I'd ever seen before.  They
    covered the long wall of the room in an even grid, butted up next to
    each other like tiles, and fastened together with duct tape and pipe
    cleaners.  There they all were-- the ghostly gurgles and beeps that had
    interrupted my sleep as they gonged wrong answers and trumpeted correct
    ones, running on some obscure program set in motion by an unseen hand.
    The room was filled with the calm and oceanic blue-green glow from their
    LED readouts.
    </p><p>
    A gentle cough broke my reverie, and I looked to my left to see a man
    leaning nonchalantly against the opposite wall.  He wore a white lab
    coat and safety goggles, and held a clipboard in one hand and a Manhattan
    in the other.  I recognized him immediately as Pitchfork guru Brent
    DiCrescenzo.
    </p><p>
    ""Brent, what the hell is this thing in my basement?""
    </p><p>
    ""Don't worry, I'll explain.  But first, dig my lab coat.""  He held out
    an arm, and I noticed that his lab coat was satin.  I felt it.  It was
    extremely soft and comfy.  Glancing down, I noticed he wore huge fluffy
    slippers.  He went on.
    </p><p>
    ""I've noticed you've been a little down on reviews lately.  You seemed
    downright bitter about having to write that Floraline review.  I don't
    blame you; it's difficult work, this reviewing.  That's why I've
    invented this device you see before you now: the Review-O-Tron 3000.
    Watch-- here, hand me that Theivery Corporation disc.""
    </p><p>
    I did as I was told.  Brent inserted the disc into a modified Speak-
    and- Math, set his clipboard on the TV, and flopped onto the futon.  Soon,
    the random bleeps coalesced into a rhythmic pulsing, and the Speak- and-
    Maths began to speak in monotone unison.
    </p><p>
    ""<i>Abductions and Reconstructions</i>, the quasi follow-up to the
    Thievery Corporation's  <i>Sounds From the Thievery Hi-Fi</i>, is a
    collection of remixes of songs from a surprisingly varied cross
    section of bands, including Baaba Maal, Black Uhuru, and Gus Gus.""
    </p><p>
    Brent nodded.  ""Not bad, eh?""
    </p><p>
    ""No, Brent, not bad at all.  But that's all factual-- any All-Music
    Guide schmuck could tell you that stuff.  What about specific tracks?
    What about the David Byrne song, for instance?""
    </p><p>
    He rose and pressed some buttons.  The electronic voices returned:
    ""Garza and Hilton possess the uncommon knack of knowing when to leave
    a song alone.  Their remix of David Byrne's 'Dance On Vaseline' finds
    the vocal track almost untouched, dipped in a little extra reverb, and
    layered over a bed of only- slightly- tweaked bass and drums.  It's a
    satisfying remix that retains the strength of the original tune but
    recasts it in a subtle and surprising way.""
    </p><p>
    ""No shit!"" I exclaimed.  ""What about the Stereolab tune?  Can it give me
    a gripe about the album as a whole?""
    </p><p>
    Another series of buttons was pressed, and again the voices spoke:
    ""'Tickertape of the Unconscious,' a song that would seem to resist the
    remix treatment, is turned into a slowly revolving groove.  The
    background vocal is distilled and brought to the forefront, and the
    welcome addition of some weird, microtonal bass sequencing is a nice
    touch.  As a whole, the album suffers only from a bit of monotony,
    with the songs all hovering around the same BPM and utilizing the
    same basic approach to percussion.  Ultimately, <i>Abductions and
    Reconstructions</i> is less than the sun of its many excellent parts,
    though it's nice to hear Garza and Hilton backing off from the forced-sounding 
    dubbiness of their debut.""
    </p><p>
    I was stupefied.  My years of sweaty toil at the keyboard had just come
    to an end.  At a loss, I looked back and forth from my computer to the
    Review-O-Tron 3000.  Brent smiled with satisfaction.  He picked up his
    clipboard, scrawled a couple notes, and sipped his Manhattan.  ""There,
    your Sunday review is done.  Now, go get a cocktail and that Vic
    Chesnutt disc and let's get to work!""

Along one of the main canals of the
    Dorsoduro, the southern peninsula of the city, I discovered a building
    defaced in green graffiti.  It read, ""DON'T BELIEVE THE HIPE.""  Something
    in the combination of the innocence of an Italian's misspelled English
    and the cosmopolitanism of punk cliches made me chuckle.  But after
    listening to the over- anticipated third album from Underworld, I want 
    to hunt down the mysterious Venician riff-raff author of this scribble 
    (I picture him in a beret, scarf, and JNCO pants) and kiss him.  For he
    is brilliant.  You see, you shouldn't believe the hype (and furthermore,
    don't believe the hip.)</p><p>
    As far back as 1997, the hyperactive music press had been awaiting 
    Underworld's followup to the brilliant <i>Second Toughest in the Infants</i>, 
    or more specifically the <i>Trainspotting</i> epic, ""Born Slippy,"" released 
    like a boogie board on the crest of the electronica wave.  Finally, after 
    settling on the ridiculous title <i>Beaucoup Fish</i>, Underworld have
    finally answered.  And it shouldn't surprise anyone in today's age of
    shattered expectations that <i>Beaucoup Fish</i> is not as great as we'd
    hoped.  But, of course, what we had hoped for was the <i>OK Computer</i>
    of electronic music.  Lofty.  The final product lies more like <i>The Bends</i>
    of house music.</p><p>
    My legs and ass must admit that Underworld that can make me dance.  
    Anyone who knows me, realizes the grand scale of this accomplishment.
    I have the rhythm of a poodle on his hind legs, begging for a milkbone.  
    Jungle junkies looking for seizure beats and caffeinated tempos look
    elsewhere.  Go pick up some Autechre or Squarepusher.  <i>Beaucoup
    Fish</i>'s thump comes direct and in repetition, a 50/50 mix of ambient 
    synthphonies and thudding digital funk with a splash of rock and roll.  
    Actually, <i>Beaucoup Fish</i> succeeds most when miming rock.  ""Push
    Upstairs,"" built on a pounding piano loop, could be a Girls Against Boys
    number, if GVSB completely got rid of stringed instruments.  A pal o' mine
    complains that ""Bruce Lee"" sounds like the opening to a <i>Thriller</i>-era 
    Michael Jackson tune.  Well, yeah.  That's why it's cool.
    </p><p>
    Unlike other techno groups, Underworld relies heavily on vocals.  And a 
    vocoder effect.  Lots of vocoder effect.  Although, the vocoder might just
    be covering up some downright silly lyrics.   Underworld loves to chant a 
    pastiche of commercial slogans, colors, consumer vocabulary, and whatever
    words they just think sound cool.  Sometimes this works.  And when it
    doesn't, you're stuck with lines like ""King of snake/ King of snake/ King
    of snake/ King of snake.""  I'm not positive, but the lyrics for ""Bruce Lee""
    might be built on the repetition of ""Life is/ Juice from a box/ Bruce Lee.""
    Underworld, being artists and designers, might try to label this ""a
    postmodern commentary on the accursed share of capitalist dogma.""  Don't
    believe the hype.
    </p><p>
<i>Beaucoup Fish</i> has no meaning in daylight and sobriety.  Underworld 
    have crafted a deeply agoraphobic record that demands the ambience of 
    neon-lit city streets, the backseat of a boxy Japanese import, or the 
    flesh-pressed dancefloor of a clubs with names like Fuse, Fix, Flux, Fax
    and Flick.  <i>Beaucoup Fish</i> is a record for quantum body activity--
    either let your body completely relax or completely move.  As shallow as
    it sounds, Underworld are just sound cool and sexy.  They're as inexplicably 
    addictive as fashion, and just as inexplicably disposable.  But isn't that
    what makes us like them?

    Italian counterpart tabled the Funkst√∂rung proposal. From an applicant
    pool of several hundred European leftfield DJs and producers, two were
    chosen. German Michael Fakesch and Italian Chris De Luca met each other
    not in a government office, but in a techno club. The government officials
    deemed that their getting- to- know- you process would move more swiftly
    away from the institutional building where their musical collaboration had
    been bullet- pointed, agenda'd, misfiled in triplicate, and finally,
    ministerially approved.</p><p>
    Though Fakesch and De Luca have produced a small series of 12- inchers for
    the Music aus Strom label, their main contribution to the cultural life of
    the joyous European Union has been their remixes. <i>Additional Productions</i>
    collects them in one handy 5"" disc.</p><p>
    Sticking to their parliamentary mandate, they've employed all the
    EU- approved avant-ish clicks, pops, scratches, crunches, cracks, snaps,
    and whirs. So whether they're remixing Bjork's ""All is Full of Love,"" the
    Wu-Tang Clan's ""Reunited,"" East Flatbush Project's ""Tried by Twelve""
    or Finitribe's ""Mind My Make Up,"" you're assured of getting the elegant,
    but identical, quality product. As uncollected singles, these tracks
    would stand out from the usual remix toss (y'know, the ubiquitous ""Club
    69"" mix, or Junior Vasquez churning out yet another product from his
    infamous Sound Factory). But though the source material may vary,
    the- one- style- fits- all Funkst√∂rung process gives this album a
    high- quality blandness.</p><p>
    And does it really matter that Funkst√∂rung sound like Autechre lite?
    Well, sort of, yes. The thrill of listening to Autechre is that
    sometimes their industrial tendencies get the better of them and their
    humanity gets consumed by their algorithmically- driven machines. At
    other times, Autechre take the same clangs and crunches far away into
    serendipitous beauty.  But with Funkst√∂rung, you always know exactly what
    you're getting. What a boon in these days of such bewildering consumer
    choices! The Brussels bureaucrats successfully regulated the curvature of
    the banana, and with the success of the Funkst√∂rung project, European
    electronica now has a similar, perfect 38- degree curve.</p></div>"|3249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3249-additional-productions/|6.8|Paul Cooper

Portishead have just blown the doors of the trip-hop
    phenomenon wide open with their debut.  Tricky's ridin' on the genre's crest with
    his critically- acclaimed debut, <i>Maxinquaye</i>, as are Massive Attack with
    their sophomore effort, <i>Protection</i>.  Next thing you know, trip-hop's on
    the stereo at every party and on the lips of every artsy hipster.  Finally, knock-
    off bands like Hooverphonic and Morcheeba start making it big and interest in
    trip-hop wanes faster than you can say ""Everything But The Girl.""</p><p>
    
    Fast- forward to the middle of 1999.  Trip-hop's dead and buried, with jungle and
    drum-n-bass hot on its tail.  The sounds of so many credible electronic labels--
    Ninja Tune, Looking Good, Astralwerks-- have started to sound less than refreshing.
    We look to England's Warp Records for a sign that electronic music isn't dead.
    We receive Nightmares on Wax's <i>Carboot Soul</i>.  Is all hope lost?</p><p>
    
    Sure, Warp's got all the great artists these days-- Squarepusher, Aphex Twin,
    Jimi Tenor, Autechre, Plaid, Boards of Canada... but exactly where does Nightmares
    on Wax fit in?  Let me explain: <i>Carboot Soul</i> sounds like instrumental
    trip-hop with a side of soul and a dab of cartoony.  Nightmares' main man, George
    Evelyn, claims to have been raised on soul music.  Supposedly, he's more influenced
    by Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye than by Giorgio Moroder and Ryuichi Sakamoto.
    But I'm gonna pull a Judge Judy and say, ""You know what?  I don't think so.  Mr.
    Evelyn, do you think I was born yesterday?  Shh!  Shh!  Shoosh!  You were raised on
    the Carpenters and Abba just like everybody else.  Don't try to come off with some
    ultra- hip sheen like from day one, you were just all that when it came to music.
    I know.  I'm not stupid, George.  I find for the plaintiff.""</p><p>
    
    The truth is, while <i>Carboot Soul</i> is indeed a soulful record, it's too
    often completely derisive of everything that's already been done in electronic
    and hip-hop music.  Yeah, it makes a great soundtrack for a low- ridin' cruise
    around the city in your convertible 1969 Galaxie 500, but y'know, not many people
    have convertible retromobiles.  And of the ones that do, very few of them actually
    ever take it for a low- ridin' cruise around the city.  And of those people, most
    will take something a little more original along for the ride than <i>Carboot
    Soul</i>.  I hope.</p></div>"|5794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5794-carboot-soul/|5.4|Ryan Schreiber

    or the miles of forest, but we found ourselves in a familiar position:
    debating relationships. Being of the optimist persuasion, I argued the
    benefits of looking forward, not letting the past ruin the future, and
    motorized sex toys. She, a mildly embittered and cynical gal, seemed
    determined to cling to her failures and drive hope out of her perspective.
    Heartbreaking, especially since my dream is to hold her in my arms for a
    long, soulful kiss...</p><p>
    
    ...And into my hands falls Beulah. It was on my kitchen counter, quietly
    begging my attention away from her. I put it into the player, upstairs on a
    purple Sunday, my thoughts still running circles around her orbit. Imagine
    my wry amusement to stumble upon this acrylic gem of poppiness-- shiny, clean
    and vulnerable, not unlike the lust that has evolved into something better
    in the past months.</p><p>
     
    Kicked back and chillin', I let Beulah wash into my brain and it was nice. 
    It turned out to be far more advanced than its predecessor.  Beulah's 1997
    release, <i>Handsome Western States</i> was a better- than- average pop record,
    seemingly recorded at home on a relatively low budget.  But this new record...
    what was different about it?  The liner notes supported what I heard: a whole
    mess of horns and strings, integrated into the tightly played, laid-back melodies
    that made <i>Handsome Western States</i> so awesome.  Tremendously clean
    production further enhances this album, which leaves me wanting more after
    its painfully brief 34:00 running time.</p><p>
    
    Standouts include ""Emma Blowgun's
    Last Stand,"" which has an extended intro that would be at home on a Tortoise
    album, breaks into a compellingly catchy melody built around a brass
    fanfare. Most tracks employ several levels of sound, giving what could have
    easily been merely ""another indie pop record"" astonishing depth and texture.
    The tone could best be called ""tempered bouncy,"" never getting to an
    annoying level of repetition or predictability, but also nearly impossible
    to drive out of one's head after several listens. Oh, another good one just
    kicked in; ""Ballad of the Lonely Argonaut,"" it's taking me on a trip into
    sleepiness...</p><p>
    
    ...And in the dream Beulah is soundtracking the awkward moment of the hug
    gone to kiss, her small hands on my back, her hair falling upon her jacket,
    and the smell of sandalwood. The sky is amber, the Beulah boys are wrapping
    their tapestry of hopeful sound around us and, looking into her eyes, our
    lips touch...</p></div>"|678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/678-when-your-heartstrings-break/|8.3|James P. Wisdom

    recently held a ridiculous contest.  Four lucky listeners had a shot at
    winning a Saturn Sedan.  The pony- tailed DJs parked the four- door by the
    escalator rotunda in the newest mall in the suburban area, and all four
    slap- happy listeners had to live in the car, in the mall, for as long as
    possible.  The contest cops allowed the listeners out from the boxy domestic
    once a day for an hour so they could wipe off with hot towels, defecate, and
    buy Cinnabons.   Whichever listener could endure the lumbar pains the
    longest and outlast the others in this bucket- seat endurance would win the
    ride.  The lure of the ten- grand, plastic, door- stop- shaped automobile
    drove these four people to live in the Saturn for nearly the length of a WNBA
    season.</p><p>
    
    After listening to Fountain of Wayne's mall- walking soundtrack, <i>Utopia
    Parkway</i>, I kept thinking back to those four contestants with comma-
    shaped spines trapped in the Saturn, where they usually set up Santa's
    Village.  This entire album sounds like it was recorded by four white
    guys in a Saturn parked by the foodcourt.  Nothing here exists outside
    of the world of sprinklers, sprinkles, and sport quenchers.  This album
    <i>is</i> suburbia perfectly captured by four suburbanites with suburban
    sounds-- neon, sod, and concrete pressed into DAT plastic.  Perhaps their
    accomplishment is to be commended, but then again... it's <i>suburbia</i>,
    and how banal is that?</p><p>
    
    I'm scratching my head trying to come up with new ways of saying ""sugary
    sweet.""  There's been a glut of pure guitar pop recently, and not even my
    thesaurus can help.  It seems like every young kid with a Fender has been
    buying a Beatles franchise recently, and shoveling out crisp <i>Rubber Soul</i>
    rip-offs.  But out of the current batch of vended pop that's sitting on my
    review pile, this record's gum stuck least in my memory hairs.</p><p>
    
    To make sure the album ages badly, Fountains of Wayne throw in
    silly pop culture references such as ""the guy from Korn"" and Pink Floyd
    laser- shows, which wouldn't be so bad if it was done with any sense of
    lyrical ingenuity.  I mean, I'll take Pavement's ""What about the voice of
    Geddy Lee..."" over ""the guy from Korn"" any day.</p><p>
    
    One of <i>Utopia Parkway</i>'s highlights is a well- acted ballad about Senior
    Prom that would break Seth Green's heart.  It's a nice song and all, but I can't
    help hearing it playing over the slow- dance scene in ""She's All That 2: A Bag
    of Chips.""  If an album could ever be accused of being too nice, this would
    be it.  Nothing offends.  No sound feels out of place.  No vocal is out of
    harmony.  And you know what?  It's boring.  Move to the city or the woods.</p></div>"|3161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3161-utopia-parkway/|5.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

    be looking at Scotland.  No, really.  Lately, the flood of truly great music
    has been pouring out of England's northern cousin like some kind of burst
    dam.  Now, hold it right there:  you need to just drop your preconceived
    notions.  It's not like all they've got is the precious twee- pop of Belle
    and Sebastian and Adventures In Stereo, and the power pop of Teenage Fanclub
    and BMX Bandits, y'know.</p><p>
    
    Owing as much a debt to the Pixies, Sonic Youth, and '70s rock as to Britpop,
    bands like Yatsura, the Beta Band, and Bis have sent a 100,000 watt jolt
    of electricity through the heart of a music scene left rather barren since
    the bottom fell out on the Edwyn Collins market. Glasgow's Delgados, despite
    their having been around for a few years, firmly fit in with this new camp
    and, along with the Beta Band, are among rock's more promising acts.</p><p>
    
    Alright, I have to admit it:  the Delgados' pristine pop does owe something
    to the sound of bands like Belle and Sebastian.  But by adding a healthy
    dose of attitude, distortion (check out ""Repeat Failure""), unpredictable
    dynamics, strong beats, and more varied instrumentation, they've created
    more engaging and interesting work than their Scottish colleagues. The
    alternating boy/ girl vocals are a nice touch as well, but... is it just me,
    or does Emma Pollock sound a bit like Isabel Monteiro from Drugstore?</p><p>
    
    As with the heralded Manic Street Preachers, you have to give this band big
    ups for their ingenious use of orchestral instruments-- it always pays off,
    adding gorgeous layers to already near- perfect songs. All this adds up to
    a great record, which could easily end up on many ""Best of '99"" lists. I
    know it's going on mine.</p></div>"|2265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2265-peloton/|8.9|Sarah Zupko

Bet'cha didn't know that.  Now     you do.  According to the All Music Guide, the guys in the band are rumored     to lead sort of nomadic existences, ""drifting from ruins of ancient temples     to disused subway stations around Tokyo.""  While that sounds glamorous and     all, I'm not sure it's really the case.</p>
<p>See, Ghost are relatively prolific.  They usually unleash albums on us     unsuspecting North American citizens in groups.  Their American debut,     the beautiful <i>Lama Rabi Rabi</i>, was released in the Spring of 1996.     Ghost returned to the scene in 1997 with three albums: a decent self-     titled record, <i>Second Time Around</i> (which is supposedly one of     their best-- I still have to make it to the record store for that one),     and a live album called <i>Temple Stone</i>.  (Not to mention Ghost     frontman Masaki Batoh's two solo albums.)  Yeah, those were all released     in 1997.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you lacking calendars, it's 1999, and Ghost are back with     two new records: the incredible <i>Snuffbox Immanence</i> and <i>Tune In,     Turn On, Free Tibet</i>.  For the record, <i>Snuffbox Immanence</i> is     the better of these two releases.  (I reviewed it a couple of months ago--     check the archive for the low- down.)  <i>Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet</i> appears to be a more casual affair.  This time around, the band seems less     interested in arrangements and songwriting structure, and more into freeform     psychedelia.</p>
<p><i>Free Tibet</i> is, as could be suspected, more of that good ol'     fashioned anti- Chinese propaganda that's so in style right now.  The     disc's liner notes even feature a lengthy statement regarding the current     situation in Tibet written by the Dalai Lama's liaison officer (who,     apparently, doesn't have a name).  It talks about the usual stuff:     oppression, ethnic minorities, severe deforestation, etc.  But it's what's     on the record that counts, isn't it?  Okay, I'm getting to that.</p>
<p>The eight songs that comprise <i>Free Tibet</i> blend together in such     a way that the album comes off more like one piece with eight movements.     Sure, it wouldn't have hurt if they'd tossed a little more diversity in     with these tracks, but what they've got serves its purpose well enough.     The purpose, of course, was to record beautiful protest songs, a concept     that's rarely been executed in indie rock.  And they succeeded.  These     songs <i>are</i> beautiful and they <i>do</i> make valid points.  The     problem is, they just don't go anywhere.</p>
<p>Despite my endless infatuation with <i>Snuffbox Immanence</i>, <i>Free     Tibet</i> seems more like an afterthought than a follow-up.  There's a lot     of sameness to these tracks, with the exception of the record's sparkling     gem, ""Way to Shelkar.""  The album's closer and title track is one of the     best examples of this: it's a 34- minute- long ambient jam with little     variation to keep the listener interested.  Where's the inspiration,     man?  Where's the love, brotha?  I wanna feel the love!  I wanna hear     the anger!  Give us some emotion!</p>
<p>These guys are capable of recording fantastic drug music-- they are,     without a doubt, masters of modern psychedelia.  But if there's one     thing the world doesn't need, it's another product with the words ""Free     Tibet"" in its title.  Instead, go grab yourself a copy of <i>Snuffbox     Immanence</i> and find out why Ghost are being called ""the new donkey     sex.""</p></div>"|3437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3437-tune-in-turn-on-free-tibet/|5.7|Ryan Schreiber

Go ahead. Look down.  What
    do you see?  Yep.  Stars.  Disorienting?  Juno just managed to boost your sorry ass to space.</p><p>
    
    There's something so picayune about one- guitar bands.  And sure, two guitars is nice, but
    flaccid.  They can play off each other, dance, jab, parry, rock in unison, etc.  But is it
    really enough?  Now, three guitars-- that's where it's at.  While all those other meager two-
    guitar bands plink away in garages, Juno adds that wonderful extra digit, the third guitar--
    the opposable thumb of rock and roll.  Now all the other bands can do is watch from the ground
    and be eaten by lions while Juno swings and climbs through the branches, making fists, building
    tools to evolve, and occasionally throwing feces at all those who oppose them.  With three
    guitars Juno has <i>volume</i>, and I don't mean in the decibel sense.  Although just to rub
    it in, they have that, too.</p><p>
    
    Let's see what other bands have three guitars these days, shall we?  Radiohead.  They're doing
    pretty well for themselves.  Critics love to erroneously throw around the shallow moniker of
    ""the American Radiohead""-- a title that holds less water than a Saharan Bedouin's bladder on a
    steady diet of potato chips.   But with all sincerity, I'm here to tell you that Juno are the
    Radiohead of punk rock.</p><p>
<i>This is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes</i> opens with a somnambulist's tired mumble over
    flumes of swirling guitar and typewriter percussion that brings to mind Rodan slo-mo crashing
    into My Bloody Valentine in bubbling, soft explosions.  Things excellerate quickly on ""Rodeo
    Programmers,"" a searing rocker that stabs hot guitars at your chest as Arlie Carstens sneers 
    great lines like, ""I've got a time- bomb lost inside my chest"" as if he has two little Bob
    Moulds shoved up his nostrils.  ""Leave A Clean Camp and a Dead Fire"" begins in a crescendoing 
    Cure-ish swell before blowing the dam open.  Similarly, ""January Arms"" floats on chiming,
    cherubic melodies before a jagged riff brings in the Saturn 5- sized rock.</p><p>
    
    Dangerous and beautiful like Liz Hurley sitting on an A-Bomb during a La Jolla sunset, Juno
    swoop down on angel's wings before ripping them off and hurling them at your throat.  As you
    can tell by the number of times I've used the words ""guitar"" in this review, this album will
    take off a layer of skin before caressing you in lotion.  Guitar.</p></div>"|4319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4319-this-is-the-way-it-goes-and-goes-and-goes/|8.3|Brent DiCrescenzo

It was back in '96 with the release of
    their album <i>Lama Rabi Rabi</i>.  At the time, I'd just moved to scenic
    Albertville, Minnesota, a small, isolated hick town about 40 miles north of
    Minneapolis and 40 miles south of St. Cloud.  I'd relocated to Albertville to
    operate a telemarketing room in St. Cloud-- the company had offered me crazy
    money and, being a naive young lad, I felt that it was the logical next step
    in achieving a lifetime of working my ass off for the man.  Those six months were
    easily the most depressing of my entire life-- the money I'd been promised never
    came through, I couldn't even almost afford my rent (at the end of my lease, I
    owed well over $2,000 to my good friend Donna over at Blue Star Properties), and
    before I knew it, I was broke and in the kind of debt that would give most grown
    men nightmares.</p><p>
      
    In my time of need, I found peace with Ghost's <i>Lama Rabi Rabi</i>, which had
    just been released at the time.  I'd drive the 40 miles to St. Cloud daily, leaving
    the apartment promptly at 8:00 a.m.  Ghost would follow me there, comforting me,
    pulling the tears from my eyes.  Alright, it wasn't that bad.  But regardless, there
    was Ghost, their blend of folky psychedelia and ethereal production leading me to a
    hell I knew I could not escape.</p><p>
      
    But times have changed.  After three long years in the telemarketing biz, I finally
    got out.  I'm now happily self- employed, living in the world's greatest city,
    Chicago, and engaged to be married in October.  So it seems ironic that, at probably
    the best point of my life, just as I received my state and federal tax returns,
    Ghost would again return to my mailbox, greeting me with an album that is the exact
    aural equivalent of pure beauty.</p><p>
      
    For the last three days, I've been walking around Chicago, getting various things
    done and listening to <i>Snuffbox Immanence</i> on the handy ol' Discman.  And
    y'know, as good as <i>Lama Rabi Rabi</i> was, the new disc is worlds better.  As
    with their last record, it's surprisingly diverse.  Sure, the primary focus is still
    psychedelic ""chamber- folk"" (as a sticker on the jewel case proudly proclaims), but
    you also get pop songs structured around traditional Japanese melodies (""Obiit 1961""),
    instrumental harp- style magic (""Tempera Tune""), and of all things, a Rolling Stones
    cover (""Live With Me"").</p><p>
<i>Snuffbox Immanence</i> is the first of two simultaneously released new Ghost
    records.  The other, <i>Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet</i>, admittedly sports an
    embarrasingly bad title.  It's also supposedly filled to the brim with anit-
    Chinese propaganda, but I haven't listened to it yet.  I've been far to preoccupied
    with this disc.  But for all my raving, I'm finding it beyond my capabilities to

The mind- altering fungi has turned your brain cells to
    glowing embers.  You lie on your back, looking past a gathering of treetops
    in the bamboo forest. But the trees aren't really trees; they're actually
    large wind instruments growing out of the ground. Mother Nature controls
    the valves and blows a light, steady stream of air up from the earth's
    core, and through a copse of tree- woodwinds.  Now there's a huge multi-
    layered drone backing up the high notes of harmonizing hummingbirds, while
    wood- nymphs whistle along. Wolves give digeridoo howls. Woodpeckers tap 
    out their staccato percussion, a chorus of crickets chirp their
    accompaniment, and a rhythmically- inclined panda bear pounds on hollow
    tree stumps in the distance. All the sounds are in perfect unison like some
    vast aboriginal orchestra. But this is no ordinary trip, you're experiencing
    David Sylvian's organically- grown multiform sound- universe.""</p><p>
<i>--Excerpt from my upcoming novel, ""Mushroom Clouds in My Mind, Man""</i></p><p>
    
    Alright, nevermind the Kerouac-ian bullshit. But you get the idea. I mean,
    <i>Dead Bees on a Cake</i> isn't exactly akin to the incidental soundtrack
    music of some boring nature film made by Gorp- chomping hippie
    conservationists. There's a certain rare meld of both primal and postmodern
    compositional sense being applied here.  Sylvian blends his different ethnic
    influences seamlessly, in a manner that shames the trendy world- beat
    affectations making appearances on so many British and American songwriters'
    albums.  And sure, sometimes Sylvian's only a pan flute coo or zither- pluck
    away from officially crossing into Windham Hill territory, and joining the
    lifetime opening- for- Kitaro circuit.  But hey.</p><p>
    
    Having been a member of synth- rock pioneers Japan, I guess it seems only
    natural that Sylvian would eventually record with someone authentically
    Japanese. Good thing he decided to work with arranging/ composing genius
    Ryuichi Sakamoto, and not, say, Yoko Ono or nasty ol' Yamatsuka Eye.
    <i>Dead Bees on a Cake</i> is nothing less than a continuation of Sylvian's
    eclectic series of genre- hopping solo albums-- the best of which is
    probably his first major collaborative effort with Sakamoto, 1984's
    <i>Brilliant Trees</i>.</p><p>
    
    When you're like Sylvian-- able to attract the likes of Robert Fripp
    (who plays on 1993's <i>God's Monkey</i>), Bill Frisell, and Talvin Singh
    and have them function as your sidemen-- you know you've finally become that
    semi- obscure but critically- acclaimed rock enigma you've always dreamed of
    becoming, right? Even Marc Ribot decides to contribute some inimitable
    guitar work on this latest album, miraculously tearing himself away from
    his busy schedule playing with every single musician in New York City. </p><p>
<i>Dead Bees</i> leads off with the spare, soul- drenched ""I Surrender,""
    and gives some foreshadowing of what's to come. Ribot's traditional jazz
    octave- playing shares space with abbreviated flugelhorn parts, flute, and
    tape- looped guitar ornamentation (the funk- inflected churn of ""God Man""
    suggests Mitchell Froom could have had his busy paws on the mixing board at
    some point, although there's no documented proof).  But in many cases, just
    a guitar and vocals are apparently enough to satisfy Sylvian.  For instance,
    on ""Dobro #1,"" Bill Frisell handles the dobro duties while Sylvian simply
    sings.  Or you may get an arrangement like the one on ""Pollen Path,""
    consisting of slide guitar, samples, drums, and Sakamoto on ""insects.""</p><p>
    
    Each track comes together in the sense that no one instrument or effect is
    ever really featured over another-- and that includes Sylvian's low, breathy
    vocals. His vocal cadences fit snugly around whatever instrumentation
    happens to be floating about. The songs also benefit from Sakamoto's
    arranging expertise, in that he seems to know exactly where and when to
    add the odd orchestral quirk, appropriate sound snippets, or coordinate a
    string or brass arrangement.</p><p>
    
    Sylvian's intrepid, near- subliminal use of samples proves to be an
    approach far beyond the grasp of most shameless sample- happy ""progressive""
    groups. He extracts bits and pieces from the Mahavishnu Orchestra, John Cage,
    John Lee Hooker and Charles Brown's 1946 Cash Box award- winning single
    ""Driftin' Blues,"" slowly and subtly interspersing the sampled contents into
    a song's framework. ""Driftin' Blues"" and samples of Hooker's ""I'm Wanderin'""
    serve as the ostensible basis for Sylvian's unorthodox interpretation
    of simple blues on ""Midnight Sun."" Pretty heady stuff it is, especially
    compared to the output of millions of musically- illiterate con-men who
    steal huge chunks of old Motown hits or spy- movie themes and add a trip-hop
    beat, just before insisting that the result be hailed as serious work of art.</p><p>
    
    Talvin Singh makes an indispensable contribution, conjuring up some spicy
    raga rhythms on ""Krishna Blue"" and ""All My Mother's Names.""  The latter
    transports you to an ambient never- neverland where Singh's Zen- like tabla
    beats become one with the throbbing of your eardrums and Ribot's guitar
    becomes the stuff of personification, as it unleashes primal screams and
    experiences fits of electronic epilepsy. Other extra- terrestrial sound
    samples fade in and out, and before long, you find yourself spinning
    out of control in something resembling the opening credits of ""The Twilight
    Zone.""  (Wave to the giant E=MC2 figure as it floats by!  There it goes!)</p><p>
    
    Sadly, <i>Dead Bees on a Cake</i> will most likely be received like every
    other David Sylvian solo project-- that is, with uniform indifference in
    America and a maybe few eyebrow raisings in Europe. True, for die- hard
    Japan fans expecting another <i>Gentlemen Take Polaroids</i>, or <i>Adolescent
    Sex</i>, this may at first sound to you like stuff you'd only listen to
    during an Oriental massage or a Calgon bath.  But don't be fooled. Sylvian's
    lyrics are poetic and rarely dull, and the album's unmistakably advanced
    musical vision makes it pretty tough to dismiss as mere new age pap.</p></div>"|7682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7682-dead-bees-on-a-cake/|7.3|Michael Sandlin

    more and more sexual.  She was alarmed.  Massages, foot sucking, chest rubbing,
    phermone wipes, jimmy hats, and PVC pop up in my reviews with greater frequency than
    pimples on Dawson's cheek.  I explained to her it was all for the entertaiment of
    the Internet masses and that I would try to turn it down a notch.</p><p>
    
    So now Ryan Pitchfork sends me the new Momus record, featuring the tongue- and-
    other- body- parts- in- cheek ditty, ""Coming In A Girl's Mouth.""   The song is
    catchy as hell, but somehow I can't picture cheerleaders jeeping to squad practice,
    cranking the FM, smacking gum, swaying back and forth, singing along with the
    insightful line, ""With a fluid the consistancy of honey, tapoica, and motor oil.""
    However, I bet Momus, the horny Scotch bastard, can picture this scenario vividly.
    With his boney frame in back holding onto the rollbar, giggling and goggling the
    girls with wide eyes through designer sunglasses smeared with a gossamer of
    splattered gnats, Momus daydreams new songs ideas:</p><p>
    
    Momus:  ""So, lassies, what do you think of me new record?""</p><p>
    
    Dumbest Cheerleader:  ""It's, like, really sorta catchy but, like, sorta... like,
    weird in that Beck way or that, like, early '80s way.  There isn't enough guitar.
    I, like, like a lot of guitar.""</p><p>
    
    Smartest Cheerleader:  ""I cringed at seeing the cover, on which you describe your
    newest music as 'analog baroque,' which I suppose beats 'moog rococo.'  However,
    I'm still flashing back to my step-dad playing 'Hooked On Classics' in his Impulse.
    Half of these songs twinkle with pansy-ass Casio harpsichord sounds.  It'd be better
    off as spoken word.""</p><p>
    
    Dumbest Cheerleader:  ""What's up with the powdered wig?  You look totally like Kip
    Winger's grandpa.""</p><p>
    
    Momus:  ""I had a bad eye infection and watched 'Amadeus' in the hospital.""</p><p>
    
    Smartest Cheerleader: ""Your lyrics are very intelligent.  The bitter tales of
    twisted love and pleasureless sex, juxtaposed to the intentionally programmed, banal
    toy-pop, drive home your theme-- social satire delivered in the most watered- down,
    common music of the society you're poking fun at.  It's totally like ""Scream 2""
    making fun of bad slasher flicks even though it totally is a horrible slasher
    flick.""</p><p>
    
    Momus:  ""I hope it's not like that.""</p><p>
    
    Dumbest Cheerleader:  ""Hehe!  Oh my gawd!  You say 'cock' in this song!""</p><p>
    
    Smartest Cheerleader:  ""Okay, it's more like a 'Red Shoe Diaries' written by
    Vonnegut.  Take 'Walter Carlos,' for example.  That's a song about a guy who has a
    sex change.  You speculate about his female form travelling back in time to marry
    his older male form.""</p><p>
    
    Dumbest Cheerleader:  ""Eww, gross.""</p><p>
    
    Momus:  ""Walter Carlos is a real person.  Er, I mean, Wendy Carlos.  She's suing me
    over that song.""</p><p>
    
    Dumbest Cheerleader:  ""Punk rock.""</p><p>
    
    Smartest Cheerleader:  ""I don't know, Momus.  This album will be big in Japan, but
    I'm afraid only girls dressed in plastic barettes and Keroppi tees, and Anglophilic
    boys with Tamagotchi keychains will get into this in America.  You're John Waters
    cult level.  Coy cosmopolitan pop produced by a randy eccentric just isn't quite
    radio- ready in the USA.  At best, jaded music critics who read Conde Nast magazines
    on the crapper will go ga-ga over this stuff.""</p><p>
    
    Momus:  ""That's okay.  I'm big in Sweden.""</p><p>
    
    Smartest Cheerleader:  ""You're terribly clever.  Perhaps too clever for your own
    good.  The karaoke contest is brilliant.  I love the way you supply instrumental
    versions of each song for fans to karaoke over for possible inclusion on your next
    album!  That's marketing.  It's all so very post- whatever.  Unfortunately, you
    dangerously tread into the shallow waters of novelty.  <i>The Little Red Songbook</i>
    is all brains and no body.  It's pop genius brains in a tupperware tub.  For someone
    so into sex and bodies, it's ironic that you don't realize that music too needs to
    be a complete package.  Our American ears like to be fucked by sexy chords and
    chiseled, curvaceous rhythms.  All the genius lyrics and karaoke ideas would just
    be frosting and gravy.""</p><p>
    
    Dumbest Cheerleaders:  ""We like Beck!  Where it's at!  Where it's at!  I'm a loser
    bay-bee!""</p><p>
    
    Momus:  ""Drop me off at the first Lufthansa ticketing agency please.""</p></div>"|5386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5386-the-little-red-songbook/|6.4|Brent DiCrescenzo

Simply scroll to the review you want to read-- the opinion that you, the infallible reader, <i>wants</i> to hear-- and proceed.  We here in the Pitchfork labs are always striving towards innovations for the future.</p><p>
<i>Pro-Mogwai:</i></p><p>
    
    	You slip on your headphones...  Guitar chords twist down from lavender skies in slithering fibers and attach to your goose- bumped skin.  With each upward strum from the plaintive second album from Mogwai, these delicate cables tug you heavenward-- they're soft tugs, paced and patient.   As you ascend further into the clouds you can make out the ground below you.  The Scottish Highlands, God's golf course, bubbles in pillowy hills.  Green grass hills filled with warm fat, feathers, and the carefully dug tunnels of fairies and elves roll to the sea, where they suddenly drop off in marble cliffs, wet from the spray of slapping waves.   A storm is brewing in the distance.  Thunder rumbles.   Mogwai's music is weather.  Its landscape, stunning in its simplicity and reduncancy.  <i>Come On Die Young</i> develops in one long movement, a sparse symphony of indie.  You can follow its pattern like a weatherman charts flows from high pressure to low pressure.</p><p>  
    	Unlike Mogwai's last album, which constantly shifted from loud loud to quiet quiet, <i>Come On Die Young</i> builds tension over eight and a half songs before erupting in the white noise of ""Ex-Cowboy,"" ""Chocky"" and ""Christmas Steps,"" the latter being the only respite from restraint for the riffheads.  But it's the album's title track, carrying the record's only vocal, sung in soft sighs, that pulls apart your heart like string cheese, muscle fiber by muscle fiber.</p><p>
    	Like a bottle of fine wine, Mogwai is not intended to be ingested on every humdrum day you live.  It's not to be played as you drive to the Target to pick up some plastic adhesive hooks.  Keep <i>Come On Die Young</i> on a cedar rack in a damp basement.  Reserve it for thunderstorms and candlelight.  Its open spaces and moments of silence are meant to be filled with raindrops and whispers of awe.</p><p>
<i>Con-Mogwai:</i></p><p>
    
    Fo'ckin bollocks!  Where's the rock?  Listening to Mogwai's <i>Come On Die Young</i> excites as much as toasting white bread with a magnifying glass in the sun on a partially- cloudy day.  Here's the thing, if Mogwai weren't from the UK, no one would give a rat's arse about them.</p><p>
    
    I call this phenomenon the ""3 Colours Red Effect,"" which states that any British band that plays a style of music that is completely overdone in America, but not particularly in the UK, they will achieve success in their native land.  Would 3 Colours Red's brand of polished grunge sell any more than a new Gruntruck or Paw record?  Call up Sony and find out.  Likewise, would Mogwai's brand of third generation post- Slint instrumentals raise anyone's attention outside of those few Chicago college kids who still listen to Spiderland religiously?   In the UK, Mogwai open for the Manic Street Preachers (who are amazingly big in the UK) and headline festivals.  If they were from Urbana, Illinois they'd be on Quarterstick Records at best, opening for June of 44 at the Blind Pig.</p><p>
<i>Come On Die Young</i>'s most exciting track, ""Christmas Steps,"" sounds like an unfinished Sweep the Leg Johnny song (i.e., minus the vocals, sax, more complex tempo changes, etc.), which, while pretty decent, is not enough to get you a spot opening for Everclear in the States.  This is not to say that fame is an essential element to good music.  I'm just pointing out that Mogwai could perhaps be the most over- hyped indie rock band in the world.  There are much better bands doing the same thing from the back of vans across the US.</p><p>
<i>Young Team</i>, Mogwai's last record, painted in bolder strokes.  Feedback and riffs burst unexpectedly from beautiful melodies.   I found myself hunching over the boombox waiting for <i>Come On Die Young</i> to develop.  Then my back got sore.  For an instrumental album, the playing is not mathy or complex enough to evoke interest.  
    I mean, have you ever been to Scotland?  It's constantly cloudy.  Decaying industrial towns pop up in rusty clusters over barren hills.  The locals drink to make their livers pop.  It's not surprising Mogwai comes from this environment of incessant gloom and fog, where there's not much to do but fondly recall history and sulk.</p><p>
<i>Poorly Written, Ambiguous Indie Zine Review:</i></p><p>
    
    Mogwai are an instrumental band from Glasgow, Scotland.  They play quiet indie rock.  If you like Slint and its spin- offs, check them out.</p></div>"|5369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5369-come-on-die-young/|6.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

    we could have ever imagined.  It's understandable that total junk rules the
    mainstrem airwaves.  We've come to expect that ever since Shakespeare and
    the Globes went to number one with their horribly cliched ballad, ""I'll
    Deflower You"" in 1602.  Ricky Martin-- who apparently had fat and plastic
    removed from his head and reinserted into his pectorals to give him the
    look of a guy who used to be kind of cut but has since stopped working out
    and is just on the verge of going completely ex-lineman on us-- seems
    destined to make millions off the Summer Hit of '99 which he hath wrought.</p><p>
    
    Today, the most completely inept jingle skyrockets to the top of the charts.
    In the year 2000, look for the Jimmy Jam (featuring Jimmy Page) Remix of
    ""Baa- Ba- Baa- Baa- Buh (The Pepsi Song)"" and a new funk- metal band called
    Poop to rule the charts.  In this sad climate, something as inconceivably
    horrible and derivative as Wolfie could score a hit.  But here's the joke--
    Wolfie are so incompetent at their instruments they can't even hope for that
    much.  Instead, they cater more toward the art- school freshman class who
    will, just minutes from now, proclaim that I ""just don't get it.""</p><p>
    
    There's a sort of Twee License that plagues pop music.  Audiences seem to
    cut some slack for a band if they're ""cute.""  Aww, ain't Wolfie cute?!
    ""Where's Wolfie?!  Where is he?!  I can't see him!  Peek-a-boo!  There he
    is!  I see Wolfie!""  And after seeing Wolfie pound on a drumset and keyboard
    they obviously just got for Christmas from Service Merchandise, I proclaimed
    to a friend, ""My lord, that's total junk.""</p><p>
    
    ""But it's <i>pop</i>, Brent!  It's just supposed to be like that.  You're
    not supposed to think about it.""  Really, have we come to this?  Why has bad
    pop become excusable because of its inherent property of being labeled pop?
    Why can Wolfie randomly wail, ""Bah- Buh- Bah- Ba- Ba- Ba- Ba"" without
    thinking how it relates to the song or chord progression at all?  And,
    alright, let's just say you're really into pop.  It's just pop.  I can show
    you a stack of <i>great</i> pop music!  That's what I'm here for.  Check out
    the Wrens or Super Furry Animals, who bore into your skull with inhuman
    hooks while still maintaining a progressive, wildly creative edge.</p><p>
<i>Where's Wolfie</i> opens with the ""Pinwheel""- esque ""Little Bee is
    Dancin'.""  Wait, Wolfie, shouldn't that be ""Li'l Bee is Dancin'?""  I don't
    think it's cute enough as it is.  This song introduces the jangled pounding
    that continues throughout the album.  ""Steely Dan"" is so incompetent that
    it manages to make Bis sound vaguely techinically accomplished.  Wolfie's
    other signatures and trademarks-- aside from their self- conscious cute-ass
    antics-- are repetition, fumbling, and ""Sweet Valley High"" poetics.  I offer
    ""Busy Busy Busy"" and ""Knew It, Knew It"" as examples.  I'll give you three
    seconds to figure out how those songs go.</p><p>
    
    Alright, if you guessed ""Busy Busy Busy, Bah Bah Bah Bah Bah,"" you're damned
    close.  Another scary aspect of Wolfie's music is their ability to brainwash
    kids who just don't know any better.  Check out what other zines have said
    about Wolfie:</p><p>
<i>""Lots of ""na- na- na's"" and ""la-la's"" to sing along with. If you like
    happiness, you will like Wolfie. If you don't, you're a meanie and I don't
    like you.""</i> <b>--Big Orange Crayon</b><br/>
<i>""If, however, you love tapping your fingers and bobbing your head to
    wonderfully creative music, then </i><i>Awful Mess Mystery</i> [Wolfie's full-
    length debut] is a surefire favorite."" <b>--Signal Drench</b></p><p>
    
    These zines should look up ""cloy"" in the dictionary.  This, honestly, is
    enough to make us at Pitchfork want to give up.  ""Wonderfully creative
    music!""  My god!  With all sincerity, that breaks my heart.  Maybe I should
    write a two- chord song about my feelings and impress the guy that runs
    Signal Drench.  I think I'll call it ""My Wittle heart is All Pitter-
    Patty.""  It will go G C G C D and it'll have some moog- stabs in there.
    I'll get a girl in a tight t-shirt to go ""la-la-la"" over it.</p><p>
    
    If you enjoy attending the Annual High School ""Battle of the Bands,"" by all
    means, pick up this album.  But if you really want good pop music, please go
    get a Beatles album, the <i>Nuggets</i> box set, <i>Pet Sounds</i>- era
    Beach Boys, the Magnetic Fields, Weezer, Built to Spill, Heavenly, Velocity

    is the idea of ""arrangement."" A good arranger can choose the right 
    instruments and deploy them in a harmonically rich combination to dress 
    up even the lamest melody, making something fresh and beautiful in the 
    process. In classic pop, from Tin Pan Alley forward, arrangement and the 
    voicing of the instruments can mark the difference between a forgotten 
    record and one that gets on heavy rotation in perfect pop heaven. At one 
    time something of a lost art, arranging has enjoyed a renaissance of late 
    with renewed interest in vintage Brazilian pop, Brian Wilson, Burt 
    Bacharach, and others unafraid to sweat the details of how complex music 
    is assembled. Jim O'Rourke, Robert Schneider and Sean O'Hagan are three 
    contemporary masters of arrangement plying their craft in the world of 
    indie rock.</p><p>
    
    To those names I would also add Ladybug Transistor leader Gary Olson. On 
    <i>The Algemarle Sound</i> he uses the time- worn elements of piano, guitar, 
    bass, drums, violin, cello, saxophones, flutes, trumpets and organs to 
    conjure the more mainstream, less trippy side of breezy '60s music. 
    Admittedly, this record is shamelessly derivative, right down to the 
    ""Blue Moon"" chord changes of ""Oceans in the Hall"" (which, if it had a 
    reggae beat, could be the new millenium's ""The Tide is High""). And some 
    will instinctively view this shoulder- glancing with contempt in the age 
    where ""new"" and ""different"" are supposed to be synonymous with ""good."" 
    But they would be missing out on some incredibly fun music.</p><p>
    
    The first thing I love about this album is that it's 12 songs and 35 
    minutes, short and sweet like they used to rock 'em before CDs 
    overwhelmed us with ""value."" I'll bet the Ladybugs had 20 songs to start 
    with and chose the best dozen, because all of these (save the 
    inexplicably terrible closer ""Aleida's Theme"") are wonderful. The sound 
    is orchestrated, lush, piano- based pop that wraps all manner of 
    instrumentation around the catchy melodies like a thick down comforter. 
    And wending through it all is Gary Olson's appealing voice which sounds, 
    I swear, like the Human League's Philip Oakey. It's cool, restrained, 
    deep and pretty, without range but with just the right amount of clarity 
    for these songs. And like every element here, it sounds like it's been 
    laid in the perfect place. Those who yearn for a slightly more

    haven't recovered. Needless to say, I've been to a great deal of concerts in
    my time, but Bailter Space wins the contest hands down for ""most pummeling
    wall of sound."" While impish bassist John Halvorsen bobbed around the stage
    and drummer Brent MacLachlan laid down some incredibly monolithic, mechanical
    (yet sometimes mind-numbingly complex) beats, singer/guitarist Alister Parker
    looked like he was completely immersed in a world of his own. Looking as if
    he could have been plucked from the offices of a British accountancy firm, he
    stood onstage stalk-still, whispering his monotonal, chant-like lyrics and
    creating an absolutely unholy din with his unsuspecting Rickenbacker. He was
    either completely bored by the proceedings, or was being mystically
    transported by them.  It's hard to know.  But, hey, the important thing
    here is that the live Bailter Space machine creates a huge mess of sound
    that's simultaneously beautiful, jagged, atonal, and supremely melodic.</p><p>
    
    Their latest offering, <i>Solar 3</i>, does a fine job of imitating their
    huge live sound. Departing from both the spastic bursts of barely coherent
    noise that riddled last year's <i>Photon</i> EP, and the slightly poppier
    directions they explored on their two previous albums, <i>Capsul</i> and
    <i>Wammo</i>, they return to a sound very much like that of their landmark
    1994 LP, <i>Vortura</i>. Great, spacious sheets of guitar noise collide with
    Halvorsen's pulsing, tugging basslines and MacLachlan's murderously precise
    drumming. Layered on top are Parker's mantra-like lyrics, which vary from a
    quiet whisper to a ragged, strangled scream. The songs themselves range from
    the lulling, peaceful 8+ minutes of ""Tide"" and the comparatively poppy,
    dreamy ""Live for You"" to the full-on pummeling attack of ""Windows on the
    World"" and ""Two Stars.""</p><p>
    
    Parker's lyrics on <i>Solar 3</i> are more concerned with human relationships
    than interstellar ones.  And the fact that Parker is actually singing about--
    rather than merely alluding to-- real people and emotions, lends a refreshing
    human warmth to the otherwise rather chilly proceedings.</p><p>
    
    While the fact is that most Bailter Space songs don't amount to much more than
    a few lines sung quietly over a couple of chords played at deafening volumes,
    the whole package has the ability to transport the unsuspecting listener into
    the aural equivalent of the center of an imploding star.  Now if somebody
    would only let me in on what the hell ""Bailter Space"" actually means, I'd be
    set.</p></div>"|536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/536-solar-3/|8.1|Jeremy Schneyer

    King Crimson-soundalike or, possibly, a barely-audible slowcore outfit
    modeled after Low or Mojave 3, perhaps? Yeah, right. The Idols are young,
    attitudinal Nashville greaseballs that grab us by the belt loops and shake
    our emo-deadened asses up-- in the attempt to convince everybody that not
    all Nashvillians are Power For Living types that vacation in Branson,
    Missouri and think Ray Stevens is a real hoot.</p><p>
    Upon first listen, they remind me of an uptempo, less world-weary Social
    Distortion-- you know, if Mike Ness and Co. had turned to coffee and Jolt
    cola instead of self-pity, smack, and booze. But I think a Ramones influence
    wins out here, as the guitarist, Phillip, reels off those lightning-quick
    Johnny Ramone chord changes like he was born to do it. And he even takes a
    few rare solos that aren't all that embarrassing.</p><p>
    The band also boasts that undeniable Arthur Fonzarelli fashion sense: the
    studded black leather over the white t-shirts.  They've got the greased-back 
    duck-tail hair-sculpting thing going on, the cigarette behind the
    ear, the requisite array of arrow- through- the- heart tattoos, and cartoon
    characters.  Oh, and for all you truck-stop chauvinists out there, get a
    load of the chick bass player-- the busty stereotypical blond with the
    pouty lips, tight t-shirt and painted-on patent leather pants. Looks like
    she might enjoy bouncing around a lot on stage.
    </p><p>
    The Teen Idols' approach to songwriting is every bit as obvious as their
    image and band moniker would suggest. So I'll mercifully spare you any
    unnecessary bullshit analysis.  As predictable and intentionally
    unoriginal as this punk-pop with a bubblegum center is, maybe I can
    still direct you to a few ""standout"" tracks. Take the title cut, for
    starters; it's a feisty little kiss-off to two-faced brown-nosers.
    And ""Insanity Plea"" is powered by the Idols' characteristic muscle-chord
    strength and bruising bass drum kick. Then you've got the fast 'n' furious
    (and especially comical) ditties about the Information Age's mechanically-dependent
    robo-children, ""Virtual Loser"" and ""Test Tube Teens."" One of the things that sets 
    the Idols apart from your average
    testosterone-fueled grease-rock outfit is a much-needed dose of
    estrogen in the vocals-- big-boned, velvet-throated bassist Heather
    combines with the fellas for some of the strongest guy/gal harmonizing
    around.
    </p><p>
    Unfortunately, <i>Pucker Up</i>, with its one-dimensional slant on punk,
    is capable of yielding too much of a good thing. Some of these three-chord,
    pedal- to- the- metal stomps have plenty of acceleration, but lack that key
    melodic line or hook that really burns rubber in the subconscious. And I'm
    not sure why so many bands, Teen Idols included, get a such a chuckle out
    of tacking on pointless filler towards the end of a particular disc.
    Here they include silly-ass studio bloopers and other moronic chatter
    during the final ten or so minutes of the album. I guess it must be some
    desperate need to communicate just how freaky, spontaneous and fun being
    stoned in a recording studio can be.
    </p><p>
    The Teen Idols have enough up-yours attitude and sense of fun to be, I
    would imagine, a truly great live band. And now that the old guard of punks
    like Social Distortion and the Ramones have aged and petered out, and
    young fogies like Green Day have become self-righteous acoustic-plucking
    auteurs, we could certainly do worse than a little Teen Idolatry.

    <i>Tron.</i> Every object bathed in a blue glow, those suits made from mouse-pad material,
    killer frisbees and laser sails... Of course, at this point, I realize that
    technology will never bring my dream to fruition.  But at the very least, I can
    listen to Trans Am's <i>Futureworld</i> and close my eyes.</p><p>
    I nearly wept from nostalgia at the minimal Atari landscape cover of
    <i>Futureworld</i>.  In this age of four million polygons per second, liquid
    animation, and ""Quake II,"" the simple pixelized Atari grid takes on Zen-like
    qualities. Trans Am realize that the future is always better in our heads now than
    when we actually get there. I'd love to think that rock in the future all sounds
    like Trans Am. I'd also like to teleport and have robot pal. But really, music in
    the future will still just be some teen named Spunky Glee singing about crushes over
    Roni Size beats.</p><p>
    Opening with distorted blasts of saxophone and droning frequencies, <i>Futureworld</i>
    flat out smokes. Drums relentlessly pummel away while blasts of incinerating keyboard
    melt neck- snapping basslines. Synthesizers drench the caustic crunch with melody and
    hooks. The echo of an infinite yellow on black matrix chimes throughout. Not since
    Brainiac has a band better fused crushing riffs with sinister computer effects and a
    tongue pressed slightly against the cheek. A robotic voice commands, ""Come back to my
    house, baby"" (in both English and German) in ""Am Rhein."" Then in the next track,
    ""Cocaine Computer,"" the robot kicks out a nasty 80's funk jam after it has assumedly
    successfully seduced the character from ""Am Rhein."" Picture the droid from ""Short
    Circuit"" pulling a Barry White on Ally Sheedy in a scene of cyborg debauchery and
    crapulence.
    </p><p>
<i>Futureworld</i> is wonderfully lo-fi and direct, and the band's first cohesive
    album thus far.  Trans Am craft ""Pong"" punk that somehow successfully fuses Shellac
    and Pan Sonic. Somewhere in a fantasy world, on green pastures of silicon motherboard,
    in clubs shaped liked RAM chips and transistors, Trans Am is the only rock band with
    soul, precision, licks, swagger, ambience, and good looks to boot.

    Invisibles</i> took place in discotheques and salubrious Brighton boites.  Vogel actually left
    his studio and went out and danced!  As a member of the Cabbage Head Collective (founding
    member Si Begg aka Buckfunk 3000), Vogel's early forays into musical self-expression were
    tape loop weirdness and Beat-inspired cut ups.  But if you've ever been to Vogel's hometown
    of Leamington Spa in the British Midlands, you'd know what a disturbing effect such a place can
    have on a growing lad.</p><p>
    So, with his parietal lobe ringing with his neo-Stockhausen ditties, Vogel abandoned being a
    Cabbage Head and headed south to the seedy coastal resort of Brighton, home of the cheeky wink,
    donkey rides across the beach, and shameless one- night- stands with skanks from all over the
    United Kingdom. Vogel probably told his folks that he was moving to Brighton to get a degree
    in 20th-century music; not to soak up the low-rent sleaze of his new home and fall in with a
    no-good bunch of twisted techno heads.</p><p>
    Six months after handing over his first cup- a- noodle- bespattered rent check to his landlord,
    then-unknown local DJ Luke Slater picked up on Vogel's experimental sound and spread the word
    around to such an extent that abstract dance maven Colin Dale was soon dropping Vogel's ""Aux
    Culture"" DAT into his sets. Dave Clarke followed by signing Vogel to his Magnetic North label
    and the pair combined Clarke's jazz-imbued rhythm programming with Vogel's passion for
    outlandish analog noise. By 1994, Europe's techno big boys noticed dear Cristian, and the
    Frankfurt-based, Gilles Deleuze-worshipping, Mille Plateaux label, known for the abstract
    experimentalism (and Germanness) of its techno releases, released the superb <i>Beginning to
    Understand</i> and the disorientating live and improvised knob tweak-a-thon <i>Specific
    Momentum</i>.
    </p><p> 
    And once Mille Plateux had him, Berlin's mighty club-friendly Tresor label had to have him,
    too. Vogel's albums for Tresor are geared towards the dance floor, a prerogative that doesn't
    always bring out the best in Vogel, and <i>Busca Invisibles</i> bears out this criticism.
    Vogel excels when he generates warped, mechanical tones from his analog equipment and when he
    complements these alien shrieks and snarls with downtempo dub percussion. <i>Beginning to
    Understand</i>'s ""Scuba Dub"" is the paramount example of Vogel's skill: it begins a dark blob
    of sound which uncoils into a squirming slug of a track, which leaves indelible slime trails.
    But nothing on <i>Busca Invisibles</i> matches it.  See, in order to get the kids dancing, 
    Mr. DJ can't offer them weird-ass noises plucked from the patch cords of some twentysomething
    Morton Subotnik.  Vogel's unique when he's concentrating on contorting sine waves, and on <i>Busca Invisibles</i>
    he showcases this talent.  Just not to the extent that he does on his albums for Mille Plateux.
    </p><p>
    Don't get the impression that <i>Busca Invisbles</i> is a stinker of a dance record. Just as 
    Neil Landstrumm's <i>Bedrooms and Cities</i> release took on the champagne and Versace sounds
    of speed garage and unfashioned them into raw machine music, <i>Busca Invisibles</i> throttles
    nu electro and should remind Warp Records that the future and present of electronic music is
    not Jimi Tenor's lounge porn.  Given the choice between the Venga Boys and ""Sarcastically
    Tempered Powers,"" I know which I'd hurl myself around a club to.
    </p><p>
    The opening to ""Shoe Renouncing Soul"" teases with untainted tones before Vogel lets loose his
    greasy beats and a severely spiked bass line. He starts ""Slices of Sink"" by aping Underworld's
    ""Bruce Lee"" before stomping his hallmark analogia all over the twitching spread; all the while
    it sounds like he's having tons of fun putting these tracks together. For this reason, <i>Busca
    Invisbles</i> is a lighter listen not only than his other albums, but also than the output of
    his Brighton buddies, Justin Berkovi and Jamie Lidell.  As the album's title indicates, Vogel
    may still be seeking the invisible, but you get the impression he got a clear idea where to
    continue looking.

    culture vultures, there's no bigger disappointment than UK hip-hop. In
    the past, that tiny little island has ingested the cream of American
    music and curdled it into some of the hugest moneymakers of all time.
    The list of UK successes is a long one: the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,
    Led Zeppelin, Howard Jones. Popular music makes so much money for the UK
    economy that Prime Minister Tony Blair could probably close down all the
    steel works and coal mines in Britain and pension off all the workers with
    funds generated by the Def Leppard back catalogue alone.</p><p>
    
    So why is it that the UK, until now, has been entirely incapable of
    producing a credible rapper? The superficial answer is that a sarf
    Lahn-dahn accent is not exactly as street- real as a Noo Yawk one.
    But the theory bites, because by that reasoning, you'd have to rule out
    Arrested Development and the No Limits roster (oh, go on, please!). This
    baffling conundrum morphs into an impenetrable enigma when one factors
    in trip-hop. Massive Attack and Tricky have produced some superb platters
    but I doubt that you would call any of them rap albums. (That's why
    they call it trip-hop, I suppose.)</p><p>
    
    But along comes Roots Manuva just to really baffle my already befuddled
    noggin. <i>Brand New Secondhand</i> is as near as I think the UK is going
    to get to an out- and- out and credible rap album. But with one proviso:
    Manuva delivers his consciousness rhymes in a sort of Brixton patois. So
    rather than getting something as woeful as MC Tunes banging on in his
    finest Mancunian eloquence, you get the most intriguing and appealing
    voices I have heard in years.</p><p>
    
    I find Roots Manuva's delivery addictive, compelling, and, above all,
    heartfelt.  His rhymes aren't exaggerated fantasies about pimping, high-
    rolling, and dismembering. No, the man has immersed himself in Rastafarian
    culture vibe and speaks of injustice and inequality, strength and
    resilience. In short, he is the postivity rapper you don't laugh at.</p><p>
    
    ""Juggle Tings Proper"" advises that we should roll with the punches
    adversity deals out, but remain upstanding and proud. ""Inna"" is a
    realistic documentary about being in a bar, getting intoxicated and
    trying to cop off with the barmaid, before ending up in a semiconscious
    state on the floor. Manuva doesn't play this scenario for laughs; it's
    more of a warning against loss of self- control and dignity. Guest rapper
    Butterfly reprises this theme of pride in oneself ""Baptism:"" ""If you ever
    catch me dancing on a table top in a thong/ In a seedy dive/ Looking sad/
    Like my stuff's gone wrong/ Yeah, for now I'm focused, diligent, strong.""
    And as a riposte to the callous exploitative stance of most commercial rap,
    Manuva chants during ""Big Tings Gwidarn:"" ""I jump upon the stage/ But I
    won't grab my dick/ I get down though/ Giving thanks to the creator.""
    Roots Manuva throws down such cruel, money- driven attitudes and replaces
    them with a roots- informed honesty and integrity.</p><p>
    
    All these heartical rhymes are accompanied by sparse, bass- heavy tracks.
    Manuva has selected the anti- Bomb Squad approach-- little more than
    a bassline and a beat box.  But where Public Enemy's producers crammed
    every moment with an assaulting urban noise, Manuva adores the off- kilter
    silence, employed so compellingly in masterful dub records. Nanosecond
    snippets of a soul vocalist run through ""Inna."" ""Juggle Tings Proper"" is
    propelled by nothing more than a thunderous bass line and a thrillingly
    syncopated percussion track. ""Strange Behavior"" wobbles on a nervy fretless
    bass figure and the metallic clanking of a iron gate. Similar to labelmate
    DJ Vadim, Roots Manuva revels in the abstract sounds of everyday objects
    (check out the cover art of a tumble of ancient microwave ovens and
    furniture held together with duct tape).</p><p>
    
    So the album's title accurately reflects this marvelous album's contents.
    With his fresh dubby spin on rap, he's made a genre long gone the way of
    the hula- hoop relevant and dynamic, while simultaneously confounding
    vapid pop culturists everywhere. As he chants on the album's opening
    track, ""There's no blood in my body/ Just liquid soul.""</p></div>"|5099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5099-brand-new-secondhand/|9.5|Paul Cooper

    the sort of computer punch- card font favored by two- bit electronics repair shops
    and sketchy medical equipment supply companies-- the sort of font that calls to mind 
    images of dusty industrial shelving and the shells of old daisy- wheel printers, all 
    covered with the sticky residue of dried Mountain Dew.  I fiddled nervously with the 
    disc the whole way home, terrified that my Friends had joined the minions of 
    Electronica. When I got the disc playing, however, I was met not with some 
    ridiculous skittering beat, but with a moog and an organ, breathing slowly
    for a minute and a half in a way which immediately laid my fears to rest.</p><p>
<i>Atardecer</i>, the Friends of Dean Martinez's Knitting Factory debut, does
    incorporate a level of technology that I had previously thought irreconcilable to
    their sound.  But there are no MIDI sequences here, and no smooth studio wizardry--
    just the rough waveforms of moogs, harmoniums and weird analog effects: in short,
    the type of technology which actually <i>belongs</i> on dusty industrial shelving
    alongside the shells of old daisy- wheel printers.  It hasn't replaced Bill Elm's
    haunting steel or desert sensibility, but instead has added a layer of texture which
    allows <i>Atardecer</i> to continue in the vein of previous Friends of Dean 
    Martinez albums without simply retreading old ground.</p><p>
    
    The opening track, 
    ""Quickening,"" is no doubt the first Friends recording to be completely devoid of 
    guitar, and it's just plain pretty.  Likewise, the record's closer is likely the only
    Friends song on which Elm desn't play a lick, with Dave Lachance taking drum, bass, 
    guitar and organ duties and laying them all over an expected beatbox.  In between are 
    nine tunes ranging from the straight- ahead band sound of ""Ethchlorvynol"" to the 
    album's highlight ""Casa Mila,"" whose nylon string guitar and harpsichord eventually 
    give way to a background of spacious washes and bleeps.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately <i>Atardecer</i> reveals the extent to which the Friends of Dean Martinez
    is really Bill Elm's project, presenting itself as a cohesive whole in a way the band's
    two preceding albums have not quite managed.  And the introduction of some new toys has
    helped head off the fear that these guys might find themselves the victims of the
    misconception that they're merely a lounge revival novelty.  These songs are too sincere,
    and just plain too pretty for that.</p></div>"|3204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3204-atardecer/|8.3|Zach Hooker

I'm sure the name initially came from the      donut- stuffed mouth of Virgin A&amp;R; reps who feared selling a band called      ""Seymour"" to the Teens UK.  ""Blur"" fits the mold of the monosyllabic,      schwa- voweled noun system of Brit-rock nomenclature-- Pulp, Bush, Lush,      Suede.  Now, after nearly a decade, Blur have grown comfortable with     their image and talents.  From now on, it's their mission to make ears      and speakers uncomfortable.  With producer William Orbit spreading gobs      of digital fuzz, guitar wash, and deep- space bleeps in heavy strokes      with William De Kooning- esque glee, the tracks on <i>13</i> bounce between      studio walls, planets, and effects pedals until slowly unraveling and      releasing with mercurian flashes and cherubic keyboard.  It all... well...     blurs.</p>
<p>The more Guitar God status fans and critics throw on Graham Coxon, the      more Coxon attempts to vigorously destroy such notions with feedback,      drilling, and controlled crust, which in turn just makes the fans and      critics swoon even more.  From the wandering melodies that twang and      fall apart in ""Tender"" to the tongue- in- cheek metal- solo, vacuum      theremin freakout, and surf- boogie ending in ""Bugman,"" to the      crescendoing strums of ""1992,"" Coxon drops creative brain- blowers     all over <i>13</i>.  Yet, the album sounds nothing like the band's     last self- titled LP.  These days, Coxon's guitars are manipulated     to sound unlike guitars.  Plus, layers of organs and loops balance     out the intoxicating mix.  But it's Orbit's UFO studio tricks make     <i>13</i> a much more cohesive and consistant record than the eponymous     LP.</p>
<p>Despite Graham Coxon's fingerprints, <i>13</i> is Damon Albarn's record     from start to finish.  From the opening epic, ""Tender,"" in which Albarn     delivers the line ""Love's the greatest thing that we have"" with a sarcastic     croon after admiting that his heart screwed up his life, to the beautiful,     stripped closer, ""No Distance Left to Run,"" in which he sighs with resignation,     ""It's over/ You don't need to tell me/ I hope you're with someone who makes     you feel safe in your sleep,"" Albarn opens his veins over <i>13</i>'s DAT     tapes.  Sort of.  On ""Swamp Song,"" though, he goes all Iggy Pop, grabbing     the mic with sass and pose.  And ""B.L.U.R.E.M.I."" could be a Brainiac song,     the closest tune here to attaining the backlashed ""Whoo-Hoo!""</p>
<p>Despite all the knob- twiddling and pedal- kicking, <i>13</i> contains     several surprisingly subtle songs.  ""Trim Tramm"" bobs along to quiet chords      before kicking in the jets, and ""Mellow Song"" lets dainty moon- cocktail      piano lines and hollow chimes swirl around lovely acoustic plucking.        Each song is unique, yet fits perfectly into the overall hungover,      psychedelic, 2001 mood.  Once again, Blur has kept one step ahead of     expectations (well, okay, they didn't with <i>The Great Escape</i>, but     that was still a great record) and continued to impress.  In a way, Blur     is one of the last big old- school ""album"" bands, a band more concerned     with their entire career than radio singles, more concerned with ""album""     than ""song.""  The Beatles made a dozen albums in the '60s and continually      progressed.  The reason why is simple: when a band is really, really good,     they consistently make good records.  Duh.</p></div>"|831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/831-13/|9.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

Well, me.  On a drab, overcast day
    spent thousands of miles away from the one you wish to be with most, nothing seems to fit quite
    as well as the somber sounds of minor chords strummed delicately on an acoustic guitar
    alongside tranquil and expressive vocals.  And this is one of those days.</p><p>
    
    Songs: Ohia's ethereal <i>Axxess and Ace</i> is a natural choice to compose this precise type
    of musical backdrop.  This is that rare kind of album that won't grab you until you've reached
    a certain mood, at which point it will unexpectedly brandish the switchblade it was hiding in
    its back pocket and carve its initials into your heart.  The initials primarily responsible for
    <i>Axxess and Ace</i> are ""J.M.,"" standing for Jason Molina, a 26 year-old songwriting prodigy
    who fashions folk songs with a plausibility and earnestness which belies his age.  Molina wields
    an emphatic, powerful voice which lends itself well to the solemn candor of his compositions.
    But unlike so many would-be folk prophets, Molina radiates an immediate endearing sincerity.</p><p>
    
    In this sense, <i>Axxess and Ace</i>'s sound greatly resembles that of Palace Brother Will
    Oldham.  Admittedly, Molina is more emotionally explicit and vocally polished than Oldham, but
    the two both employ the same sparse musical structure and evoke the same mood.  Like Oldham's
    <i>I See a Darkness</i>, <i>Axxess and Ace</i>'s moving choruses, recalling enigmatic lands of
    perpetual dusk and love unrequited, are achieved with only acoustic guitar, vocals, and the
    occasional sparse drum or bass.</p><p>
    
    Many of these tracks feature remarkable backing vocals by the gifted Edith Frost which imbues
    them with a level of sexual tension befitting the romantically jaded and perplexed lyrics.  On
    ""How to Be Perfect Men,"" Molina croons ""Be mine/ Until you're reminded of something better,""
    a statement fairly indicative of his exhausted bewilderment at love.  Before the stunning
    climax of ""Come Back to Your Man,"" Molina reveals that ""There are demands on spirit and flesh/
    And I've made the effort to survive them.""  At 26, a poor young minstrel already weary of the
    emotional demands of romantic ardor.</p><p>
<i>Axxess &amp; Ace</i> isn't necessarily remarkable for its musical precision and innovation in
    composition, but for its striking authenticity-- the free form of Molina's songs is an asset.
    The various musicians who performed on <i>Axxess and Ace</i> hadn't actually heard any of
    Molina's planned compositions until the day they were recorded, and the album is recorded
    almost completely live.  Thus, the feel of the album is unrehearsed and genuine.  <i>Axxess
    and Ace</i> is a fine addition to the collection of any refined music aesthete and an
    empathic companion to any contemplative mood.</p></div>"|7339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7339-axxess-and-ace/|8.0|Taylor M. Clark

    Stuart David of Belle and Sebastian has handed a DIY book on home sampling out to any and all
    kids with a Casio keyboard and a tape recorder. He wants them to turn everyday life into a
    story set to music. And to quote something I read somewhere more than twice, ""lovely music it
    is.""  David makes me happy because he writes happy songs.  Hmm... I guess I should have more to say
    on the subject.  Well, let's put it like this: David notices things and takes pleasure in them.
    He's someone who could sit on the front porch with a ray of sunlight touching his toes and
    realize that it was good.</p><p>
    
    The songs on <i>Up a Tree</i> don't wander far from the backyard. Actually, three of them don't
    even leave the treehouse. There's one that tells the story of him and his wife Karn (who
    performs the visual half of Looper... adding slides and movies to their shows) and the letter-
    writing that led to their here and now.  None of these are actually the best songs ever written,
    but they're fun.  And the honesty with which David presents his stories along with the stripped
    down and earnest 'electronica' backing them is far fresher than pretty much anything you can
    hear on the radio today. I'd like to go to a club (I guess that means I have to go to a club)
    and shake my all to any of them, but I'd rather just sit in the grass and listen.</p><p>
    
    ""The Ballad of Ray Suzuki"" professes David' belief that we all can be Loopers. Most people
    probably won't follow his lead, although I could envision some sort of folk-hop movement
    starting up on the college campuses. Drum machine, anyone? Care for a tape loop, madame?
    Sample yourself. Sample your friends. Just don't sample the Police or Led Zeppelin and
    perform rap Karaoke over them. No one would ever buy that.</p></div>"|4850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4850-up-a-tree/|8.1|Chip Chanko

Take the Wedding Present, for example.  Here's a
    collection of singles that spans two entire CDs, if only because disc
    two is padded with a bunch of previously unreleased live cuts.  That's
    two whole CDs of nothing but the Wedding Present, a band known for
    playing loud and wiry songs at the speed of light while lead singer
    David Gedge makes like he's trying to punch out the brown.  It's not
    bad, but two CDs?  It gets old.  Not fast, but old none the less.  If
    you're a fan, you've already got the original singles, but you may want
    the live tracks.</p><p>
    
    Okay.  That's my whole review.  While I have you here, though, I'd like
    to get on the ol' soapbox about one of my big musical peeves: the cover.
    I love a good cover song, the key word here being ""good.""  There are
    several covers on this Wedding Present compilation and none of them are
    good except for Pavement's ""Box Elder.""  The rest can be summed up
    quality-wise just by mentioning what they are.  Tom Jones' ""It's Not
    Unusual,"" for instance, shouldn't be covered, just like any other Tom
    Jones song.  Nothing against Tom-- Mr. Jones and me go back to the early
    days of the Counting Crows, for Christ's sake-- but the moment a bunch
    of scrappy and decidedly unsexy kids take on the human pelvis' material,
    they've lost all credibility.</p><p>
    
    ""But don't you see?  It was done for a laugh.""</p><p>
    
    Even worse.  I'm not laughing.  I also didn't laugh during the
    obligatiory Lou Reed cover.  At this point in musical history, it
    doesn't even matter which Lou Reed song is covered.  Bands like Lou Reed
    covers because they don't have to work too hard to get it right.  Hey,
    can I get you boys some pillows in case you want to have a bit of a lie
    down?  And the less said about the cover of ""Cumberland Gap,"" the less
    time I spend on the topic of bad covers.</p><p>
    
    If you're in an up- and- coming band, please do us all a favor and stay
    away from the works of the following artists:</p><p>
<li>The Beatles, because you're probably never leaving the basement, and
    I'm talking to <i>you</i>, Absolute Zero of Kirkland, WA.<p>
<li>The Bee Gees, because you're not that clever.<p>
<li>Prince, because the audience will never be that drunk.<p>
<li>Peter Gabriel, because life isn't an Emma Bull book.<p>
<li>R.E.M., because at this late in the game, it's like asking your dad if
    you can borrow one of his ties.<p>
<li>Jimi Hendrix, because you're not the Beatles.</li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|8598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8598-singles-1989-1991/|5.5|Jason Josephes

    found itself at or near the top of hundreds of critics' lists.  How did this
    happen?  Simple: people like the silly.  Of course, Cornelius has more going
    for him than just the silly.  First off, he's a pretty awesome producer--
    <i>Fantasma</i> was clear evidence of the fact that he's got skillz in the
    studio.  Secondly, he's an even bigger star in Japan than he is in America
    (there, he moved half a million copies of <i>Fantasma</i>, and sold out his
    own multimedia concert event at the Budokan with tickets going for a mere
    $50 a piece).  Third, he's got connections.</p><p>
    
    Connections?  You read right, sweetheart.  Dig some of the names remixing
    his work on <i>FM</i>: Money Mark, the High Llamas, Buffalo Daughter, the
    Pastels, Blur's Damon Albarn, UNKLE, Coldcut... the list goes on.  And,
    honestly, it's a pretty decent remix record.  (With names like that, how
    could it not be?  Honestly!)</p><p>
    
    Naturally, some of these mixes stand out more than others.  Damon Albarn's
    remix of ""Star Fruits Surf Rider,"" despite its serious conceptual theft of
    the talking Macintosh voice from Radiohead's ""Fitter, Happier,"" is pretty
    cool-- you'll dig the added vocals and the spacy, moog- laden groove.  As
    could be expected, the High Llamas' take on ""The Micro Disneycal World
    Tour"" is, not surprisingly, Llama-ized-- it actually sounds more like a
    Cornelius remix of a High Llamas song instead of the other way around.
    Pizzicato Five mastermind Konishi Yasuharu's tops ""Count 5, 6, 7, 8""
    with an ass- crazy pre- programmed piano part that gives new meaning to
    the term ""really, really fast.""  Coldcut also make a nice comeback from
    their mediocre remix of Steve Reich's ""Music for 18 Musicians"" from the
    <i>Reich Remixed</i> compilation-- they get down with their bad selves
    on ""Typewrite Lesson,"" adding elements of drum-n-bass, instructional
    records, laughter, documentaries, turntablism, and lots of typewriters.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, UNKLE's mix of ""Free Fall,"" while boasting DJ Shadow's
    trademark nasty rhythmic assaults, shows our man Josh Davis slipping
    further out of his shadow of talent and into a bottomless pit of self-
    indulgence and wankery.  Buffalo Daughter somehow manage to make ""New
    Music Machine"" sound like an awful PJ Harvey cover, and Money Mark's
    version of ""Mic Check"" is, to put it nicely, dreadfully boring.  I
    wonder if its companion disc, <i>CM</i>, is any better...  I guess
    we'll find out later.</p></div>"|1608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1608-fm-fantasma-remixes/|7.5|Ryan Schreiber

Bjork's
    <em>Telegram</em>, perhaps. Maybe (and this is a big maybe) <em>Tortoise
    Remixed</em>. But the majority of remix albums that immediately come to mind--
    the Sea and Cake's <em>Two Gentlemen</em>, <em>owL remix Low</em>, the High Llamas'
    <i>Lollo Rosso, Mogwai's <em>Kicking a Dead Pig</em>, the Jon Spencer Blues
    Explosion's <em>Experimental Remixes</em>-- have only one or two tracks worthy
    of even hardcore fans. I know it's dumb to complain, since the remix industry
    has always been less about interesting reinterpretations of songs and more
    about giving sonic handjobs to each other (""Sonic the Handjob""-- now there'
    a Playstation title I wouldn't mind playing), but that doesn't mean I still
    can't be harsh on </i><i>CM</i> for simply being representative of the genre.</p><p>
    
    Look. Cornelius is a fucking genius, I think we can all agree on that. But
    he succumbs to a bad case of Remixer's Syndrome on <i>CM</i>, wherein
    everything he remixes ends up sounding just like him. Thus, <i>CM</i> sounds
    like <em>Fantasma</em> with the original songs reduced to mere samples. Or,
    conversely, Cornelius reuses scads of samples and production techniques from
    <em>Fantasma</em> in the <em>CM remixes, to the point where it might be
    redundant to own both albums. Either way, it's the same thing.</em></p><p>
    
    To be fair, there are indeed some interesting moments on <i>CM</i>. Cornelius
    takes Money Mark's rather lead- footed pop song ""Maybe I'm Dead"" and makes it
    feather- light, the vocals floating about in a dreamy lounge arrangement. And
    UNKLE's ""Ape Shall Never Kill Ape"" melds punk rock rhythms with cartoony
    orchestral swoops so seamlessly you wonder why no one thought of it before. But
    overall, Cornelius sounds like he isn't trying too hard. Maybe it's that his
    sounds are so recognizably him that it sounds rote, or that the choice of
    artists he chose to remix seems pretty obvious, with the exception of the
    Pastels, whose ""Windy Hill"" is ironically the most enjoyable track on <i>CM</i>.
    (On the other hand, this version is also available on the Pastels' infinitely
    more enjoyable <i>Illuminati</i> rexix LP.) In that respect, <i>CM</i> is a
    grand missed opportunity; just think of what it would have been like had
    Cornelius tried to remix, say, his Matador labelmates. Cornelius remixing Cat
    Power? Yo La Tengo? Chavez? Pavement, even? Now there's a remix album worth
    investigating.</p></div>"|1610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1610-cm-cornelius-mix/|5.4|Nick Mirov

    the pop song.  On his 1997 Sub Pop debut, <i>Waters Ave. S.</i>, Jurado wrote melodies
    that resonated with joy and sorrow while keeping things generally upbeat and excessively
    catchy.  But there was one thing keeping the man down: he couldn't sing a lick.  His
    cracking, warbling, off-key tenor was so painfully prevalent that it made the songs a
    bit difficult to listen to.  A serious shame, too, 'cause in every other respect, <i>Waters
    Ave. S.</i>-- to quote that old legend of insanity, Wesley Willis-- whooped on a llama's ass.</p><p>
    
    Two years have passed since that pretty excellent offering, and Jurado returns with
    <i>Rehearsals for Departure</i>, an album that improves on its predecessor in every
    department.  The guy's vocals are the most immediately noticable difference-- he's
    still no Tony Bennett, but he's sounding great these days.  On top of that, he's doing
    a brand new dance in the songwriting aisle.  Jurado's new songs seem far more
    inspired by the introspective stylings of Springsteen or Neil Young than smiley
    pop stars.</p><p>
    
    But Jurado hasn't abandoned the pop song.  Tracks like ""Honey Baby"" and ""Letters and
    Drawings"" show he's got a knack for penning unforgettable, upbeat love tunes.  But
    <i>Rehearsals for Departure</i> is, all told, a more personal record, complete with
    tales of longing and regret.  ""Ohio"" is an elaborate and painfully sad tale of a girl
    deciding to return home years after being kidnapped by her father.  ""Curbside"" is
    a surprisingly convincing post- breakup number that recalls those glorious first days
    of love.  And ""Love the Same"" might be the loneliest number that he'll ever do.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the thing that makes these tracks truly outstanding are Jurado's romantic
    and poetic lyrics-- the way he can make the most simple action sound so dramatic.
    On ""Ohio,"" he sings, ""She stands on the sidewalk/ Just waving at taxis/ Like horses
    and parades in passing.""  In that line, he recalls the simplicity of childhood while
    tackling the frustrations of adulthood without even trying.  It's lyrics like these,
    along with the occasional simple flourishes (like female background vocals, maracas,
    orchestration and simple harmonies) that really make <i>Rehearsals for Departure</i>
    a really great record.</p></div>"|4324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4324-rehearsals-for-departure/|8.2|Ryan Schreiber

    record that offered a totally different sound.  Though audiences were used to
    the skittering, rapid- fire electronic beats, video game sound effects and tinny
    keyboards of his prior releases, and despite his prior release, an EP he called
    <i>Big Loada</i>, garnering him the most critical acclaim of his entire career,
    the Squarepusher swapped genres.  He released <i>Music is Rotted One Note</i>,
    a strictly jazz affair with no sequencers or breakbeats to be found, a total
    shock to fans and critics alike.</p><p>
    
    Tom Jenkinson's gone in a similar direction on his new seven- track EP,
    <i>Budakhan Mindphone</i>.  It's slightly less jazzy than <i>Rotted One
    Note</i>-- almost a combination of Squarepusher's two sounds.  The opening
    track, ""Iambic 5 Poetry,"" is a late-nite '70s gangsta shuffle, boasting
    warm, orchestra- emulating keyboards, gentle feedback and a glockenspiel.
    It perfectly encapsulates the feel of a lonely and humid summer night.
    This is the shit that's gonna get sampled by rap groups in 2015.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, tracks like the ambient ""The
    Tide,"" the swaggering, dischordant tones and tunnel reverb of ""Splask""
    and the junk rhythm fest of ""Gong Acid"" show Jenkinson's horizons are
    ever- expanding.  <i>Budakhan Mindphone</i> proves that Squarepusher
    clearly intends to keep on keepin' on, making new noise the likes of
    which the world may otherwise never have heard.</p></div>"|7449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7449-budakhan-mindphone-ep/|7.5|Ryan Schreiber

    from darkened alleyways, know that these sounds emanate not from gunfire, but
    from an unregistered Liverpudlian Clinic whose surgeons engage in dissections
    of the by-gone underground influences of America.  The execution is primitive,
    but its intent is logical.  The music is elemental, having evolved from the
    ancestral types that serve as influences to their rough methodology.  But a
    balanced rationale clearly governs Clinic's menacing aural approach.  The song
    title ""I.P.C. Subeditors Dictate Our Youth"" signifies a blatant call to action
    against the modern-day bureaucratic mind-control that pervades youth markets
    both above and below ground.  It indicates a deviant sense of purpose that more
    scrupulous medical practitioners lack.</p><p>
    
    The surgeon's table has seen the inhumanly savage cut-and-paste of <i>White
    Light/White Heat</i>-era Velvet Underground with the rhythmic assault of Hal
    Blaine under Phil Spector's direction.  The screams are Spector's own-- the
    sonic equivalent of studied horror from witnessing organs being spilled upon
    the sterile tile floor.</p><p>
    
    The technique is concerned with brutal distortions of aesthetics.  ""Porno"" 
    aches and moans orgasmically to a warbled throbbing of keyboard and guitar.
    It's topped with indecipherable vocal incantations meant to terrorize those
    that have trouble grasping the deconstruction of rhythm within the context
    of terrible sex.</p><p>
    
    An insidious affinity for indirect discourse is discernible in the otherwise
    unintelligible vocal approach.  ""D.P."" and ""D.T."" are violent odes to sonic
    aggression, exemplified by the less sophisticated punk rockers of the '60s
    and '70s.  ""Punk,"" having become a loaded political term, is applied here in
    the same way an anesthetic is administered for inducing numbness in wounded
    patients.</p><p>
    
    The knives-out approach of these medical knaves belies the sadistic glee with
    which they patch their subjects together.  The gruesome freshness of their
    product indicates a fruitful decomposition of influences from within-- the
    appropriation of life-blood from yesterday's walking dead imbues their macabre
    creations with mortal verisimilitude and stylistic panache.  Shrouded in a
    skeletal grasp of melody, the most shocking prospect is the widespread acceptance
    of their unsound practices, and the slow unfolding of their message through the

Farrar, on the other hand, with Son Volt, confidently assumed his     position as Americana's standard bearer.  Things soon changed, however,     as 1996's sprawling and ambitious <i>Being There</i> saw Wilco reimagining     themselves as rock'n'roll revivalists with a drunken swagger, and winning     the hearts of Uncle Tupelo fans and critics the world over-- Son Volt,     meanwhile, stagnated on 1997's <i>Straightaways</i>, which, while not a     bad record by any stretch, failed to innovate quite like Wilco had.  The     tide had turned, and Wilco found themselves unexpectedly on top.</p>
<p>In 1998, Wilco teamed with British folkie Billy Bragg for <i>Mermaid Avenue</i>,     a collection of Woody Guthrie lyrics paired with original music by the     collaborating artists.  Wilco lent a suitable Midwestern sensibility to the     project, but with Guthrie putting the words in his mouth, Tweedy had yet to     beat the biggest knock against him.  By now, it was obvious that he had a     knack for crafting instantly memorable melodies; the question was: what did     he have to say?</p>
<p>Just as the Velvets' swan song, <i>Loaded</i>, was packed with hit songs for     critics who claimed Lou Reed was incapable of writing them, so too is <i>Summerteeth</i> Jeff Tweedy's statement of purpose.  The album, a loose song cycle     considering the intermingling of perception, communication, and reality, and     its affect on our relationships, witnesses the band dismissing its country-rock     sound for a studio sheen that would make Brian Wilson proud.  Drawing on the     pop music of their late-60s and early-70s youths, the band members have crafted     a collection of immediately infectious and consistently stunning melodies with     complex, layered arrangements.  With the band having jettisoned Max Johnston and     his dobro, fiddle, and mandolin, <i>Summerteeth</i>'s songs are driven not by     rustic guitar licks, but rather by Jay Bennett's grand organ fills and ever-present     harmonies, which paint the album in Technicolor.</p>
<p>Undermining this sticky-sweet pop party in a delicious irony, and ultimately     supplying <i>Summerteeth</i> with its depth and success, is Tweedy's dark     contemplation.  The intrigue begins quickly on the album's opener, ""Can't     Stand It"", which finds our narrator lamenting the end of a relationship over     a pop-soul ditty punctuated by bells.  As the source of the narrator's     frustration crystallizes on his own fickle emotions, Tweedy plants the seeds     of mistrust, warning of ""speakers speaking in code.""</p>
<p>As the album racks up false realizations, startling confessions, and outright     lies, listeners find themselves exchanging suspicious glances with their guides.     Where ""Pieholden Suite"" dupes a sleeping lover, the frail ""We're Just Friends""     finds Tweedy lying only to himself.  Similarly, the singer's resolve on the     jubilant would-be self-help anthem ""Nothing'severgonnastandinmyway(again)"" is     plastered like a forced smile, and cracks like, ""I'm a bomb, regardless,"" scar     the fa√ßade.  In fact, during the album's first half, only the overtly sarcastic     ""How to Fight Loneliness"" is what it seems.</p>
<p>The album's confusion climaxes during its keystone, the majestic ""Via Chicago"",     and its counterpart ""ELT"".  On the former, a scorned lover stews, ""I dreamed     about killing you again last night/ And it felt alright with me."" Then, a     couplet of unsettling stream-of-consciousness lyrics give way to Tweedy as     he tears into a disturbingly deliberate, off-key guitar riff that might very     well be the musical moment of 1999.  Interestingly, the celebratory ""ELT""     finds our sad psychopath repented and healed: ""Oh, what have I been missing/     Wishing, wishing that you were dead.""  Taken on its merits, the song is almost     unimaginatively sincere, but in context, it becomes enigmatic.  As the narrator     shuffles his story for our approval, which spin are we to believe?  Brilliantly,     the album leaves such questions unanswered.</p>
<p>As Tweedy removes his trickster mask for ""My Darling"", a spare lullaby to     his young son, the mood of the album emerges, but <i>Summerteeth</i>'s     transformation is most apparent in its two recitals of ""A Shot in the Arm"".     Amidst the incertitude of the album's twilight opening, its chorus, ""Maybe     all I need is a shot in the arm/ Something in my veins/ Bloodier than blood,""     seems a ghoulish reference to drug addiction.  However, its reprise, on the     heels of the Elvis Costello-by-way-of-Phil Spector romp, ""Candyfloss"", seems     to call on an inner strength and the fortitude for self-improvement.</p>
<p>From its opener, in which ""our prayers will never be answered again,"" to ""In     a Future Age"", where Tweedy challenges us to ""turn our prayers to outrageous     dares,"" <i>Summerteeth</i> drags us through our interpersonal garbage, only     to politely ask us to pick up after ourselves.  Once drawn in by the album's     addictive pop hooks, the band ensnares us with clever ironies and rich musical     treatments that never let go.  As the album admits its intricacies, it's clear     that the band is growing exponentially.  Having confidently abandoned their     alt-country ghosts, Wilco has become a band from which we can expect everything     and nothing at all.  With <i>Summerteeth</i>, they've delivered on both counts,     crafting an album as wonderfully ambiguous and beautifully uncertain as life     itself.</p></div>"|8677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8677-summer-teeth/|9.4|Neil Lieberman

    combine the two, well, that's Zen. Don't let the hippies fool you, there's
    nothing communal about pot. It's all about that high, and the only reason
    you want people around when you get high is so they can witness how good pot
    makes <em>you</em> feel. They're there so they can enjoy you, not enjoy pot
    with you. Masturbation is that joint you save for yourself and smoke when
    everyone has gone home.</p><p>
    
    The beauty of Sebadoh is that they not only understand how selfish weed and
    wacking off are, but, to quote Malcom X, they ""talk right down to earth in
    a language that everybody here can easily understand."" There's no false
    conception that you're getting one band when you buy a Sebadoh CD-- you're
    getting a bunch of songs that sound like the person who wrote them. Sebadoh
    isn't a band as much as it's a means to an end.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, the ends have been worth the means. Lou Barlow's always
    depressed, Jason Loewenstein's always pissed and Eric Gaffney always sounded
    like he took a wrong turn and ended up in Sebadoh's studio instead of
    GWAR's. That's part of the fun. If your girlfriend just shit on your heart,
    Lou was there to empathize. If you felt like letting off some steam, Jason
    was your man. If the crank was taking a minute to kick in, Eric could
    kickstart it.</p><p>
    
    Then came <em>Harmacy</em>, by which time Eric was long gone and Lou and
    Jason, along with Bob Fay, decided they were a band. They weren't yet. The
    overproduction and cohesiveness was a wimpy kick in the nuts. No high, no
    climax, no thank you.</p><p>
    
    The curious thing about <em>The Sebadoh</em> is that it is, in fact, The
    Sebadoh. You get the multiple personalities and the whole unit. ""Bird in the
    Hand"" is Jason Loewenstein at full tilt, screaming like an unwelcome orgasm
    and clanging out arrhythmic chords. ""Break Free,"" new drummer Russ Pollard's
    only song credit, sends out signals of longing without being overdrawn.
    ""Love is Strong"" is so distant and depressing that it could only have been
    written by Lou Barlow. Behind the personalities, though, all the songs are
    coming from the same place.</p><p>
    
    Some people won't take to the cohesiveness, and the added production won't
    make them any happier. Change scares people, especially people accustomed to
    the stasis of weed. The warm organ and warped guitar on ""Tree"" may as well
    be aliens bursting out of the stomachs of musicians who made an entire album
    as bedroomy as <em>Weed Forestin</em>, but the rest of the track is as
    soothingly analog as any Nick Drake sobber. Likewise, the sci-fi noodlings
    and tambourine of ""It's All You"" sound polished, but retain that special
    Sebadoh quality.</p><p>
    
    For Sebadoh, it's been a while since giving the pleasure of the two M's
    meant blatantly singing about them, but after a dismal attempt at coming
    together, Sebadoh seems to have made an album that's both communal and
    self- gratifying. Fuckin' hippies.</p></div>"|7051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7051-the-sebadoh/|7.4|Shan Fowler

    '90s. They haven't made a pandering sellout record. They haven't threatened
    breakup. They haven't moved away from the college town (Champaign, Illinois)
    where they started. And they haven't made a bad album, ever.</p><p>
    
    The college indie rock crowd may expect big things from the Poster Children
    on their latest record because of their recent reassignment to the indie
    ranks (they left Reprise for SpinArt last year).  But the truth is that even
    when they wore a corporate suit, their spirits were independent. They stay
    that way on <em>New World Record</em>, their first self- produced, home-
    recorded album.</p><p>
    
    As always, there are new dimensions that keep the band from rehashing the
    same fast chords and blistering rhythms.  The record opens with the
    shuffling drums and guitars of ""Accident Waiting to Happen"" before Jim
    Valentin's happily ascerbic vocals and the band's trademark coffee buzz
    sound kicks in on guitar. Feedback hangs around ""Time to Kill"" like a
    tie-die tapestry. Vintage new wave keyboards and monotone vocals bolster the
    indie harmonies of ""Ankh,"" giving the band a momentary resemblance to the
    late, great Brainiac.</p><p>
    
    These are almost all of precious few extras thrown into <em>New World
    Record</em>. Maybe the Poster Children were intentionally trying to make
    their self- produced debut what people would expect from a home- recorded
    album, or maybe they just ran out of money. Whatever the reason, the spare,
    live quality makes this effort the most visceral Poster Children
    album since <em>Daisy Chain Reaction</em>. It doesn't sound literally live (as
    engineer Steve Albini made <em>Daisy Chain Reaction</em> sound), it just
    sounds more true to the band's live spirit than anything from the band's
    Reprise years.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, though there are a few competitors for anthem status--
    the sheer volume of ""6x6"" and the light- through- stained- glass guitars of
    ""Deadman""-- few of the tracks here can match the power and persuasion of
    ""Junior Citizen"" and ""He's My Star"" from the Reprise years (live videos of
    both are included in a CD-ROM package, which also includes a video game that
    simulates touring).</p><p>
    
    It's not for lack of trying-- the Poster Children have made easy work of
    cutting unique new songs using their routine, trademark structure.  And
    though every song sounds familiar, you can rest assured that there's no
    ground on <em>New World Record</em> that the Poster Children have already covered.</p></div>"|6435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6435-new-world-record/|8.1|Bruce Tiffee

    around.  Press kits, for the uninitiated, are like a sales pitch.  You
    get a letter from some yahoo behind a desk who has this neat band they
    want you to check out.  To get you to do that, they also include various
    write-ups and reviews for a previous work or, in the case of a new band,
    loads of ""Next Big Thing"" accolades.  Usually, a press kit is a dozen
    pages or less.  The Built to Spill press kit, on the other hand, may be
    the next great American novel.  First, a three page letter from the
    publicist.  Secondly, an 8x10 publicity shot featuring Doug
    Martsch flanked by bandmates and sitting on a radiator playing a
    guitar.  (I'm sure he plays on the radiator all the time, or so the
    world of publicity shots would have me believe.)  Then, <i>twenty-eight
    pages</i> consisting mostly of unanimous rave reviews for their last album,
    the fucking awesome <i>Perfect From Now On</i>. Finally, a four page article
    from the new issue of <i>Spin</i> regarding the new release... which is
    somewhere in the envelope.  I had to turn the kit upside down and start
    shaking until a white cardboard promotional CD case came a-tumbling out.</p><p>
    I put the disc in the player and began to leaf through the kit.  Sure,
    I was just looking for my name somewhere in the clippings, and I suppose
    it would have helped to have previously written about them before.  But
    that's fine because I can sit there and mock my fellow writers by
    playing the ""Sounds Like..."" drinking game or trying to find the biggest
    clich√© of them all.  The winner was a tie between Mr. Showbiz's Grant
    Alden, who referred to <i>Perfect</i> as ""...less ebullient than its predecessor,
    and has a wry durability about itself, yielding polished gems..."" and the
    usual hands- down winner, Will Hermes of the Village Voice, who actually
    managed to string together the words, ""As far as rock goes, the stay- at-
    home types seem peculiarly American these days, a gesture from a post- grunge
    culture weary and dubious of being the biggest, loudest, and most
    important, just as current Britpop might be read, in part, as
    postcolonialist white British weary of apologizing for its history and
    looking to feel good about itself again"" and call it a coherent sentence.</p><p>
    The one thread that held every single review and article together was
    how different <i>Perfect</i> was from the band's previous release, 1993's
    <i>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</i>.  <i>Love</i> was built on short,
    sharp, and snappy pop songs, but <i>Perfect</i> was-- as everybody went
    on to note-- ""epic.""  Indeed, the 1996 release had few tunes under six
    minutes and wove dense guitars, emotional debris, and schizophrenic song
    structures into something gorgeous and fascinating.  As avid readers of music
    publications will note as the reviews trickle in, <i>Keep It Like a Secret</i>
    will be heralded for retreating back to the pop songs of <i>Love</i> while keeping
    a foot inside <i>Perfect</i>'s scrimmage line of dexterity and guitar heroism. 
    (My friends, I think when the next album's press kit arrives, <i>I'm</i>
    going to win my own petty game with that last sentence.)  It also recalls
    last year's fine Halo Benders release, <i>The Rebels Not In</i>, the album
    Martsch recorded with Beat Happening's Calvin Johnson and former Spinanes
    and current Built to Spill drummer Scott Plouf.  And that's not a bad thing
    at all.</p><p>
    Seriously, <i>Keep It Like a Secret</i> has already been spun at Club Jason
    five times within the past 24 hours.  That's not a frequent occurrence--
    not unless it really, and truly is, love.  Doug Martsch just knows how
    to tickle me in all of the happy places, and he accomplishes that on the
    merits of the opening number alone.  ""The Plan"" is a brisk, weaving anthem
    complete with a solo that would make Thurston Moore green with envy.
    ""Center of the Universe,"" the second cut and first single, conjures up
    some XTC and a little bit of Barnacle Pete's finer sea shanties.  And
    what have we here?  It's the downright pretty ""Carry the Zero,"" which
    merges Cocteau Twins- esque guitars and melody with equal sigh and much
    more articulate lyrics, none of which I'm going to quote to you.
    ""Sidewalk"" is classic indie rock in sound, classic rock in execution--
    something I've been waiting a long time to hear.</p><p>
    Speaking of classic rock, ""You Were Right"" is a tongue- in- check number
    about spitting back classic rock lyrics (""You were right when you said
    all we are is dust in the wind/ You were right when you said that we're
    all just bricks in the wall""), although why he's doing it is a mystery. 
    But it's a fun mystery.  You know, like ""Mystery"" on PBS, only without that
    meddling Alistair Cooke.  Believe me, if there's one man who can spoil a
    rock and roll party, it's that evil tool of the Mobil Corporation. 
    Luckily, he's passed on, leaving Diana Rigg to run the show, and she's no
    match for Martsch.  <i>Keep It Like a Secret</i>?  No, at the risk of hopping
    on a clich√© wagon, I think I'm gonna tell all my friends about Built to
    Spill.  Try and stop me, Diana.</p></div>"|1014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1014-keep-it-like-a-secret/|9.3|Jason Josephes

    one thing-- what I have to say about an album.  Well, guess what!  I'm tired.
    Therefore, I lack inspiration.  But that'll even out my feelings for this
    Starflyer disc.  See, right now, I love this album.  But will I love it a
    year from now?  Hmm... that's a question for... somebody else!</p><p>
    
    Somebody Else: Hi. I'm Somebody Else, and this is my sidekick, Another Guy.</p><p>
    
    Eh, no.  Maybe that's a bad idea.  I guess I should just try to tackle this
    review with dignity.  So, here's my Mom.</p><p>
    
    Mom: It's Mother's Day, and that's the deal.  Ryan handed this disc off to
    me to review it.  Now, I'm not experienced in this line of work, but I decided,
    ""It's Mother's Day!  I gotta do somethin' for this kid.""  So, here to review these
    Starfur or whatever y'call 'em, is Tony Bennett.</p><p>
    
    Tony: Hello.  Can you resist my charm?  I didn't think so, sweetness.  After
    all, I'm Tony Bennett, the world's charming-est man.  I've been in the music
    business since my father became the President of Music back in 1833, so I've been
    around.  I know what it's like to buy some music, bring it home, listen to it
    and hate its damn guts.  Just recently, I murdered, in cold blood, Tammy Wynette.
    You know why?  Three words: ""Justified and Ancient.""  Let's face it.  When it
    comes to music, everybody sucks but me.  And to prove it, I've got Rip Taylor
    on my side.</p><p>
    
    Rip: Here's what I think of ""emo"" music-- it's a ruckus!  I'd throw confetti
    if they let me have my own TV show!</p><p>
    
    Tony: Rip, you'd throw confetti if I gave you a nickel.  Emo is important to
    today's youth.  It allows kids to be as melodramatic as they love to be, while
    simultaneously letting them do the slamdance.  I don't know shit about the
    slamdance, but if I did, I'd be out there in the clubs instead of making
    records with the ""Sesame Street"" gang.</p><p>
    
    Sting: Did someone say ""Feyd-Rautha?""  I have sex for six hours at a time!
    What do you make of that, Rip?  Eh, Tony?  And I know a heckuva lot about music--
    got a phD in it.</p><p>
    
    Tony: Sting, you talentless hack!  A phD in music!  Bah.  You suck.  Especially
    your solo crap.  Suck!  [mocking] ""It's such an ignorant thing to do/ If the
    Russians love their children, too...""</p><p>
    
    Sting: Hey, we got an album to discuss here, eh?</p><p>
    
    Tony:  They're a band... I don't know who they are, Styflaror... [hic!]</p><p>
    
    Rip: On their latest offering, the <i>Fell in Love at 22</i> EP, these boys push
    some dazzling sounds.  Their music, despite being on the predominantly ""emo""
    label Tooth and Nail, is quite distinctly <i>not</i> emo.</p><p>
    
    Tony:  What do you talk of, Rip?  This is emo!  It has emotion.  E-mo-tion, Rip.
    They're all crybabies!  Damn it [hic] to... my nostril's... in a shell.</p><p>
    
    Sting: You're a 'orrible sight, Tony.</p><p>
    
    Rip:  Tony, emotion is not the only qualifier in emo.  Emo's a genre that combines
    loud/ soft musical dynamics with introspective lyrics about loss, girls, puberty,
    school, and love.  It's heartfelt, yet noisy.  [throwing confetti at Tony]</p><p>
    
    Tony: [retch]</p><p>
    
    Sting: Well, I folla ya, Rip.  You're right about Starflyer-- they're definitely
    not emo.  What they are is dreamy and pretty with outer space atmospherics.  Sometimes
    they're quiet, sometimes they're noisy.  But when they're noisy, it's still pretty.
    In other words, they've assimilated the sonics of My Bloody Valentine and Radiohead,
    along with the shimmering pop brilliance of Phil Spector.</p><p>
    
    Tony: Rip, I told you about the fuckin' confetti!</p><p>
    
    Rip: Tony, if you don't mind, the Sting and I are professing our love for Starflyer 59.</p><p>
    
    Sting: The title track, ""Fell in Love at 22,"" is really nice.  It sounds like a
    perfected ""Earth Angel.""  Remember that one?</p><p>
    
    Rip: Do you remember ""Bill Bailey, Won't You Come Home?""</p><p>
    
    Sting: Eh... before my time, I think.</p><p>
    
    Rip: Okay, forget Bill Bailey.  How about the Beatles?  You remember them, right?</p><p>
    
    Sting: Yeah-- Ronny, Bobby, Ricky and Mike!</p><p>
    
    Rip:  No, that's New Edition.  And you forgot Ralph.</p><p>
    
    Sting: No, it's the Beatles.  Remember the whole ""Ronny is dead"" thing?  They had
    that song, ""Cool It Now.""</p><p>
    
    Rip: I think we were talking about Starflyer.</p><p>
    
    Tony: Numbnuts.</p><p>
    
    Ryan: Burn in hell, you guys.  I'll handle this.</p><p>
    
    Sting: Hey, my name's on the cover of ""W"" this month!  You can't talk to me like that
    at the peak of my popularity!</p><p>
    
    Ryan: Rip and Sting were right earlier on when they were actually talking <i>about the
    band</i>.</p><p>
    
    [Rip and Sting look down in shame]</p><p>
    
    Ryan:  Starflyer are more deeply rooted in old shoegazer rock than anything else.  The
    reverb drench, the wall of sound, the lonely twang of the electric, the acoustics of
    Saturn-- all the elements of the shoegazing sound are here.  But what the guys have
    added is a serious talent for penning melodies that are not just ear- catching, but
    also incredibly beautiful.</p><p>
    
    Tony: Whiskey river, take my mind!</p><p>
    
    Ryan: Mom, would you see Tony outside?  On the title cut, the band emulates Phil
    Spector-ish '60s pop, but adds some much- needed warmth and sincerity.  And ""E.P.
    Nights"" starts off simply enough-- just a basic pop melody, no major hooks, but
    certainly hummable-- before bursting into a supernova of melodic bliss.  The
    guitars howl behind a force field of static- charged distortion, the cymbals
    crash into an unstoppable frenzied climax, and Jason Martin's vocals are elevated
    just above the noise: ""These are the nights...""</p><p>
    
    The band also proves on ""Traffic Jam"" that they're the masters of modern- day
    shoegazing instrumental epics.  The track clocks in at just over 14 minutes
    with not a single second wasted.  Finally, bringing the EP's 26 minutes to a
    close, is ""Samson,"" a track that can only be described as Low with a touch of
    country.  So, y'know, I'm not here to tell you what to buy, but if it sounds
    good to you...</p><p>

    Other frontmen: Hi, Jason.</p><p>
    
    Jason: I really don't know why I'm here. Well, okay, I know why I'm here,
    but I don't think I have a problem. It's just that, ever since my band
    Jellyfish split up, I can't stay out of the studio. I keep making these
    songs and putting out these records, and then I wait, and wait, and wait.
    But they never come.</p><p>
    
    Soundgarden's Chris Cornell: Who never comes?</p><p>
    
    Jason: The people, man! The people never come. I don't know why. They just
    don't seem to know I'm here. I never went away, so why did the people go
    away?</p><p>
    
    Miles Hunt (of the Wonder Stuff): Because they don't care. Trust me, friend,
    I played empty stinking clubs half of last year, and all I got was free
    beer.</p><p>
    
    Jason: Yeah but... but... I'm special. People loved me when I was in Jellyfish.
    I mean, we didn't sell a lot of records, but the critics liked us.</p><p>
    
    Living Colour's Corey Glover: Doesn't matter. Once you get rid of that band
    name, you're no better than shit on a horse's hooves. People don't care...
    nobody cares.</p><p>
    
    Jason: Maybe not for you, Body Glove, but I'm different. I sound like a
    baritone Jeff Buckley. I know how to make pop songs that are both lush and
    longing. Pulp tragedies, if you will.</p><p>
    
    Frank Black: Hey, man. I was a fuckin' star! I was the frontman for the
    greatest band ever! I carried Kim Deal and those other pansyass motherfuckers
    on my back! They lived off the fruits of my labor! Ungrateful bastards.
    Jellyfish wasn't even that great. So you had a couple of big songs. Woopdy
    shit! I have a whole collection of good songs, and look at me now. I'm a
    fatass, washed-up nobody with less fans than Kim Deal's sister! So how's
    about you just shut the hell up and deal with it like the rest of us. Besides,
    those ""lush"" songs you brag about aren't that great. Sounds like Brian Wilson
    serenading Herbie the Love Bug if you ask me.</p><p>
    
    Jason: I don't need this. I'm an artist. The people will come around. It'll
    just take time. Late bloomer. That's it, I'm a late bloomer. Or a Creeping
    Charlie. Yeah, I'll creep up on people and before they know it I'll
    be all over them until they can't escape. And I'll suffocate them with my
    orchestra and my <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> psychedelia. They'll love me! Everyone
    will love me!</p><p>
    
    Josh Clayton-Felt (of School of Fish): No, they won't. Believe me, it's over.
    You may as well call your mom and tell her you're moving into her basement

    Marilyn Manson.  When I was attending high school in the '80s, all us
    lonely, depressed potential sociopaths took solace in bands like The The,
    the Cure and Joy Division. If we merely killed ourselves, well, hey, it was
    enough. But good old fashioned self-immolation has become outmoded.
    Nowadays, you've gotta take a few dozen strangers down with you to really
    get off. And as usual, I attribute all the youth violence in society today
    not to the proliferation and accessibility of guns, but on the paucity of
    credible rock stars. Maybe I'm joking, maybe I'm not.  But where the hell
    did all the Joe Strummers go?</p><p>
    Now, I was raised in bible-belt Texas, so rest assured there was no shortage
    of firearms in our house.  But luckily, instead of toting guns, the lost boys
    and girls of my generation either flocked to bad metal, or video games like
    ""Galaga.""  Still others, out of desperation for something more substantial,
    went out and stumbled upon landmark albums like The The's official debut
    album, 1981's <i>Burning Blue Soul</i>.</p><p>
    As stifling as things could get in Baptist country, The The lead vocalist
    Matt Johnson seemed to understand our isolation, and was explicit in his
    indictment of our parents' sham Christian mores. He made it okay to revel
    in our non-believing misfit gloom. His aetheistic gallows humor and cutting
    social commentary was delivered with a bracing defiance. His songwriting
    didn't induce the kind of feeble hopelessness that would normally lead a
    bored, confused suburban kid to lose it completely.
    </p><p>
    Inhabiting a shadowy interzone between goth, new wave, and punk, <i>Burning
    Blue Soul</i> manages to plumb depths that Robert Smith and Peter Murphy could
    only lightly touch upon. Johnson delivers his kernels of realist wisdom in
    a flat Gregorian monotone: ""100,000 people were burned/ I felt a pang of
    concern/ What are we waitin' for/ A message of hope/ From the Pope/ I think
    he got shot as well.""  And what over-ponderous mope-rocker can't relate
    to observations like this: ""When you hide in your bed/ And look in your
    head/ You find you've gone deeper than you should/ It could be your
    shallowness is your strength.""
    </p><p>
    In a sense, the ghostly production values on <i>Burning Blue Soul</i> sound
    like fairly upstanding (and typical) 4AD fare: the isolated vocals, the
    guitars wet with reverb, the basslines slithering eerily along the nether
    regions of a song. Thick guitar hailstorms come and go.  Textures vacillate
    from vaulted cathedrals of sound to barely discernible structures. ""The
    River Flows East in Spring"" is built around little more than a deformed
    keyboard hook and offbeat handclaps. There are no beginnings, middles
    or ends. Johnson completely shuns verse- chorus- verse predictability,
    and doesn't even find much need to tie down his songs with conventional
    drumming or consistent backbeats.
    </p><p>
    Of course, Johnson eventually lured ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr into
    the studio for 1989's ground-breaking <i>Mind Bomb</i>. Marr brought a
    richer and more grounded sound to Johnson's near- formless compositions.
    The band's sound eventually evolved into the mellow New Order-ish pop of
    1993's <i>Dusk</i>, and took a detour with 1995's near-ridiculous batch
    of Hank Williams cover songs entitled <i>Hanky Panky</i>.
    </p><p>
    So, here's a novel idea for all you alienated, potentially homicidal
    youngsters: try trading in those ridiculous Marylin Manson CDs, and pawn
    whatever artillery your NRA-member father bought you for Christmas. Cleanse
    your tortured souls in the church of Matt Johnson.  Take heed, all ye
    little doom-obsessed freaks, Manson's music will eventually make you
    open a vein-- or worse, open fire on your peers.  But most of all, realize
    that Manson's crusade is merely to open your little pocketbooks and swindle
    you out of those hard-earned weekly allowances. Take a listen to The The's
    <i>Burning Blue Soul</i>. The lovable folks at 4AD reissued it just for you.
    Maybe it'll even open a few of your minds to more pacific and productive
    possibilities of expressing all that pent-up hate.

    that most bands don't live to see their third birthdays.  There are very few popular musicians
    out there who produce for a sustained period of time, or whose output has the breadth or depth
    to warrant considering it as a body of work-- and when such an artist comes along, they're
    rewarded with a greatest hits collection, not a catalogue raisson.  Anyway, people don't think
    of pop stars as artists-- for good reason really, even if those of us who listen to and write
    about popular music would prefer to think otherwise-- and ideas common to other forms of
    criticism very rarely find their way into rock reviews.</p><p>
    
    Which is as it should be.  Still, the idea of late work is arguably applicable to just about
    any pursuit which spans a couple decades, from sculpture to plumbing.  And XTC has certainly
    been around long enough to qualify.  See, here's the thing: people always diss late work.  It
    doesn't matter if you're talking about Bob Mould or Bob Rauschenberg, there's always someone
    there to say, ""I just liked him better when...""  Sure, the people talking about Rauschenberg
    are probably going to use bigger words, but all they're saying is, ""I was hip to this guy when
    we were both young and nobody had ever heard of him and that makes me cooler than you.""</p><p>
    
    Then again, some artists really do fall off as they age.  Not only do they become less relevant
    and more irritating, but in many cases, they're actually laughable: Salvadore Dali and Fishbone
    spring to mind.  Which is why <i>Apple Venus</i> is such a relief.  XTC has made a bunch of
    records, several of which are great records, and then they didn't make a record for a long
    time-- like since the Bush administration-- and there a was a pretty good chance that this
    record was not going to be good.  It was feared the album would show a band out of touch,
    past their prime and rusty.  As it turns out, though, these guys were putting away a little
    nestegg of excellent songs during their strike, and <i>Apple Venus</i> finds them picking
    up pretty much where they left off.  Or maybe even a little bit before they left off: this
    record bridges the gap between the ambitiously poppy <i>Oranges and Lemons</i> and the pastoral
    <i>Skylarking</i>.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, <i>Apple Venus</i>' main preoccupation is paganism.  ""River of Orchids"" starts things
    off with a vision of the world reclaimed by nature; its overgrown highways and fossilized cars
    are like a less clever but more convincing version of the Talking Heads' ""Nothing but Flowers.""
    ""Easter Theater,"" ""Harvest Festival"" and ""Greenman"" take their turns with simlilar pagan issues.
    Even the album's packaging sports a little occultism, proclaiming ""Do what thou will but harm
    none""-- which some reviewers have taken as a polite note, but which is actually a more
    responsible version of Aleister Crowley's famous thelemic motto.</p><p>
    
    What's remarkable about this album is the way it reveals itself.  The first listen may slide by,
    the second and third will reveal a little more of interest, but by the fifth time through,
    <i>Apple Venus</i> is a vast landscape with lots of little places to dig and explore.  The
    music is built on simple phrases, but the relationships between those phrases becomes
    tremendously complex.  The lyrics invite repitition and close scrutiny, and prove there's
    a great deal beneath the suface.  The art historian Erwin Panofsky said that a great late
    style married ""intense emotion and outward stillness.""  Of course, he was writing about
    Titian, not pop music.</p></div>"|8835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8835-apple-venus-volume-one/|8.2|Zach Hooker

    skipping you could never be sure if it was a fault with your gear or if 
    Reich was exploring some kind of Eastern modality far beyond the realm of 
    your meager mind. Now, with groups like Pan Sonic, this old joke has a 
    digital analog. This kind of post- post- post modern sound- shaping can 
    seemingly be enjoyed by only the most open minded (or deluded) of
    consumers. I think Pan Sonic must have been what Mark Leyner was talking
    about when he wrote of ""the electronic music they use to drive fleas and
    cockroaches crazy.""</p><p>
    
    Quickly, now, Pan Sonic used to be called Panasonic (they got in obvious 
    copyright trouble) and they're two Finnish gents with a penchant for 
    minimal, ambient electronica based on pure sine waves, static, and the 
    tones of discarded machinery. Example: that sound your portable CD player 
    makes when it spins a disc, that might take the place of the drums. That 
    hum you get when you fire up your turntable and the grounding wire is not 
    properly connected, that could be the bass. And the whir of your computer 
    fan could be lead guitar. In short, think of them as Oval with a sense of 
    rhythm; rather then entering the algorithms and letting the apparatus do 
    the rest, they sculpt a variety of digital noises into something distantly 
    related to standard musical order.</p><p>
    
    The result is as ice cold as you would expect from sounds this 
    divorced from the human hand.  And to me, therein lies the interest. Much 
    electronic music uses the heartbeat dance rhythm as a way to humanize, to
    take the sounds from the realm of physics into that which can be 
    understood by the body. But when this connection is discarded, things can 
    get interesting. You're forced to pay attention to details that would 
    normally cause to you check the warranty on your equipment. It can be 
    disorienting, nauseating even. You may feel funny. You may even feel like 
    an idiot. But you will not say, ""I've heard this before.""</p></div>"|6138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6138-a/|7.4|Mark Richard-San

    listening to vinyl records as some yo-yo worked the film strip? You had 
    to use your <i>imagination</i> back then, folks. Watching a still image on
    the screen for a minute or two while a monotone narrator droned on about the 
    history of Incan art meant flexing your brain constantly, if only to stay 
    awake as you came down from that chocolate milk high. These kids today--
    with their ""computers"" and their ""Internet""-- have everything spoon- fed. 
    Sure, they can come up with the answers, but how the hell are they 
    supposed to learn how to think?</p><p>
    
    If you're old enough to remember those times, then you may remember that 
    most school districts contracted with a company called Califone to 
    produce those industrial- strength turntables that could fall five feet 
    to floor and play perfectly every time. (I tested this personally back in 
    the day.) Former members of Red Red Meat and Rex have borrowed that 
    company's name for a new musical project, and their eponymous debut 
    appeared this year on Flydaddy.  It's an appropriate moniker for a band 
    fronted by Tim Rutilli, as it implies toughness, solid design, and a keen 
    awareness of how to blend classicism with the latest technology-- all 
    these qualities are here in spades on this fine record. 
    Rutilli's already strong songwriting improves with every record, and the 
    music his band makes has an air of permanence about it-- you just know 
    this stuff is going to be discovered by future generations.</p><p>
    
    Stylistically similar to Red Red Meat's <i>There's A Star Above The Manger
    Tonight</i>, Califone tones down the more abrasive noise experiments and has
    an overall quieter feel. The junkyard space-folk blues vibe is still there, 
    but is more refined with slightly catchier melodies. Prettiest of all is 
    ""Silvermine Pictures,"" which mines the lo-fi classic rock sound with a 
    subtle steel drum adding some nice textures. Throughout, the percussion is 
    outstanding, particularly on the loping ""To Hush A Sick Transmission,"" which 
    has a similar metallic groove to Tom Waits' old masterpiece ""In The Colosseum.""</p><p>
    
    All told, Califone seems the perfect sonic evolution for 
    rock, incorporating the noise prevalent in experimental electronic music 
    in a completely new and organic way.  Pick it up now, if only to have 
    some answers when your hipper- than- thou kids ask you about it in twenty 
    years.</p></div>"|1242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1242-califone/|9.2|Mark Richard-San

    against the shores of our ears a few years after their breakup.  They rocked hard
    and left a hearty wake.  The phrase ""sounds like Jawbox"" has become as ubiquitous
    and misused as ""sounds like Slint"" in critical circles.  There's even a Jawbox
    movie, ""Savoring the Static,"" being made with Vince Vaughn, Janeane Garofalo, and
    Tom Cruise.  I went to the set to discuss the new Burning Airlines CD with the
    stars.</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  Do you guys know about Burning Airlines?  It's the post- Jawbox band
    with J. Robbins and Bill Barbot, who I believe Vince and Tom are playing.</p><p>
    
    Vince Vaughn:  Yes, I listen to it quite frequently in my trailer.  I'm well past
    my phase of exclusively listening to bands of young Hollywood hunks, like P and
    Dogstar.</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  Now, does the movie cover the Burning Airlines formation?</p><p>
    
    Tom Cruise:  No.  The studio really wanted a silly, typical, big- budget ending.
    At first, my character was supposed to snap, cut up his torso with a hunting knife,
    and blow up the Lincoln Memorial after one too many zine kids ask him, ""What was it
    like being on a major label?""  I thought that was a bit too much.  Instead, they
    decided to go sappy and have some of us marry each other.</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  Let's get back to Burning Airlines.  What do you guys think of it?</p><p>
    
    Janeane Garofalo:  Well, I'm bitter at the world and even I like it.  It's so good
    that I forget how lonely and manless I am.</p><p>
    
    Vince Vaughn:  I was expecting it to be loud, full- on rock after hearing their
    debut 7"".  Kinda like a continuation of Jawbox.  I was so pleasantly surprised at
    how <i>pop</i> it sounded.</p><p>
    
    Tom Cruise:  So true.  Those 7"" songs are on the CD, but they're some of the most
    straight- forward rock songs on the CD.  The rest is pop, as Vince said, yet it's
    also joyously experimental.</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  Not experimental in a noisy, arty way though.</p><p>
    
    Tom Cruise:  No, not at all.  I mean that you can hear all the influences of D.C.
    peers infused into their sound.  It's an amalgamation of everything from recent
    Fugazi and Kerosene 454 to the Dismemberment Plan and Smart Went Crazy-- there's
    even some Monorchid in there.  People who say that the D.C. scene has weakened are
    chumps.  This record could be the defining record of the late '90s D.C. scene.</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  The drumming on ""Pacific 231"" and ""Flood of Foreign Capital"" bring to
    mind some of Smart Went Crazy's later stuff.  It's really amazing.  Drummer Pete
    Moffett's arms impressively play skittering breaks that would make Aphex Twin's Mac
    blush.  Yet the songs are tighter than Cher's cheeks.</p><p>
    
    Vince Vaughn:  Yeah, I was amazed at how tight the band is!  For a trio, they go
    together better than mirepoix.  Bill Barbot's move to bass is the greatest surprise.
    His nimble fingers and creative lines might put Kim Coletta to shame.</p><p> 
    
    Pitchfork:  Yeah, all the technical aspects are superb, but it's the songwriting
    that hooked me the most.  The record is short and punchy.  After one spin I knew
    all the songs, and looked forward to immediately going back through them.  This is
    the most hook- laden record D.C. has produced in years.  ""The Escape Engine"" stands
    out in my mind with those echoing ""whoo- a- whoo- hoo's"" in the background and that
    space- age snakecharmer solo.</p><p>
    
    Janeane Garofalo:  It's not as solemn as Jawbox.  There's just an overall air of
    energy and fun throughout the record.  It makes me forget for a moment that I'm
    approaching 40 and still single.</p><p>
    
    Tom Cruise:  The balance between liberal rock invention and traditional songwriting
    in the band is something that only decade- long veterans could forge.  You forget
    that this a rookie release.</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  I'm shocked that big stars like you are so hip.</p><p>
    
    Vince Vaughn:  What's this line say?</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  What line?</p><p>
    
    Vince Vaughn:  Here.  I can't read what you wrote...</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  Um... you're supposed to say, ""Well, when something like this comes
    along, where all the great elements of indie rock, from Gang of Four to XTC to
    Helmet are mixed together, how could any human not like it?""</p><p>
    
    Janeane Garofalo:  Isn't that a bit much, Brent?  I know you really like them, but
    please...</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork:  No, I'm serious.  It's that good.</p><p>
    
    Disclaimer: This review is a work of satire.  Naturally, this
    conversation never occured and, to our knowledge, there is no movie about Jawbox

Really, I'm not just
    swiping a Tom Petty lyric for shits and giggles.  My heart is huge,
    knocking off them block rocking beats like it was a couple of ugly
    English guys with a sampler.  Speaking of which... techno music.</p><p>
    
    Back in the day, there was Meat Beat Manifesto.  Don't get me wrong--
    there still is a Meat Beat Manifesto, but in the early '90s it was the
    only sort of techno I could wrap my hands around.  <i>Storm the Studio</i>
    and <i>99%</i> are sheer works of genius.  I rediscovered this last week
    when I took a little jaunt to Los Angeles.  There I sat in front of the
    stereo, stoned to the bone and kicking ass on ""Tekken 3.""  Hard beats, so
    thick and bloated that a set of octuplets could come spilling out
    at any moment.  Have you heard these albums?  If not, snatch them up.
    They're the blueprint for all of the rigid, noisy dance music of the
    early '90s.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, here in the late '90s, techno has taken a different track. 
    Today's techno artists couldn't give a shit about anything under 120
    BPM.  Everything's too fast to dance to.  Sorry if it dates me, but it's
    true.  I don't want to hit a dance floor and wiggle back and forth at
    900 BPM to jungle music.  Arling and Cameron's latest in a string of
    American releases, <i>All-In</i>, has a handful of tracks like this
    but dancing doesn't seem to be the motive.  Even on the track ""We Love
    Dancing,"" the motive is less KMFDM and more on the jokey Aphex Twin tip.
    Remember ""Milkman"" from Aphex's <i>Richard D. James Album</i>?  Who didn't
    bust a gut during the crazy ""I would like some milk from the milkman's
    wife's tits"" chorus?  Deaf people, of course.  Everybody else got the joke.
    ""We Love Dancing"" is a hyperactive number built around a sample of giggling
    four- year- olds singing the title and yelling ""Yaaaaaaaay!""  The joke is
    later resurrected on the Kraftwerk parody ""We Love to Rock"" and the spacy
    ""We Love Dub.""</p><p>
    
    I guess what I'm trying to say is that <i>All-In</i> is, yet isn't, a
    techno album.  ""Speeding Down the Highway-- Fastest Girl Around"" is a nice
    merging of Buffalo Daughter and Stereolab without succumbing to the
    godawful hijinx of the Cardigans.  ""But What About the Boys"" is a future
    gay club classic, and I say that with hope that future gay club classics
    won't entail Ace of Base or Human League.  ""Get It On"" rubs itself all
    over shag carpeted bass lines before surrendering to jagged beats and
    Hammond organ.  The sprightly fun of ""Groovy"" will have you tapping your
    foot and whistling in no time flat.  Can you dance to it?  Ask a dancer.
    I like music, and when you get right down to it, I like <i>All-In</i>.</p></div>"|287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/287-all-in/|8.0|Jason Josephes

    This week alone, we've been confronted by two of this world's most
    perplexing tragedies, those of the genocide in Yugoslavia and the high
    school shooting in Colorado.  Naturally, these disturbing events force us
    all to ponder our social values and norms and, more directly, the nature
    of humanity itself.</p><p>
    
    Genocide at least provides a modicum of an answer-- thousands of years of
    history, tradition, fear and fervor combined with the machinations of war
    allow us to at least partially, if ultimately unsatisfactorily, explain the
    inexplicable.  However, when seemingly privileged children kill each other,
    there is no such history at work; merely someteen years of wasted life
    through which we will aimlessly fumble in the futile search for 'signs.'
    No doubt, the usual specters will be paraded in the media circus that is sure
    to transpire for the next couple of weeks.  Our vain worship of fame and
    notoriety for any cause, the ease with which deadly weapons can be obtained
    in this country and the overwhelming level of violence to which we are
    exposed through various media will, in varying combinations, assuredly be
    blamed for the deaths in Littleton.</p><p>
    
    Already there are reports that the members of the so- called ""Trenchcoat
    Mafia"" were enamoured with Marilyn Manson so it is all but a foregone
    conclusion that the devil's music will bear some of the blame here.  But
    don't be mistaken-- if singers sing of teen angst and violence, those nefarious
    feelings are already brewing out there.  Music, like all art, is merely a
    reflection of the society that created it and the elements within that
    society.  The disgruntled singer must find a disgruntled audience willing to
    listen to his song.</p><p>
    
    On ""The Devil in Me,"" a delicious play on the Stones' ""Sympathy for the
    Devil,"" John Wesley Harding blames misdeeds ranging from the crucifixion to
    air pollution on that inner demon before astutely concluding, ""it all seems
    like human behavior to me.""  The song, a shamelessly catchy rollick, was at
    least partial cause for the promise of Harding's 1991 debut, <i>Here Comes the
    Groom</i>.  The close of the decade that began with such high expectations for
    Harding finds him once again the folkie, and once again contemplating human
    nature.</p><p>
<i>Trad Arr Jones</i> is Harding's tribute to Nic Jones, a British folk
    guitarist whose arrangements of traditional songs (the album's title is short
    for the songwriting credit: Traditional; Arranged by Jones) provided blueprints
    to Dylan and Richard Thompson before an accident ended his recording career.
    Harding initially found himself intrigued by the tales of murder, deceit and
    debauchery in these hundreds of years- old songs and attracted to the fragile
    beauty of Jones' simplistic arrangements.  Here, Harding adds only his strong
    voice and soft guitar to the faithful arrangements, though he respectfully
    notes that he had to adjust Jones' guitar parts down to his own skill level.
    As a result, the beautiful songs reveal themselves willingly.  Killers kill
    senselessly and loved ones die tragically, while lovers betray each other
    throughout the album's eleven tracks.</p><p>
    
    These songs, penned centuries ago, find the depths of human depravity as
    simply stated as the newspaper headlines we will read tomorrow morning,
    reflecting the harsh times in which they were written.  Refracted through
    recent events, they provide no answers, only uncertainty.  But just as these
    songs also sing of love and the struggle of the human spirit against itself,
    so, too, will the coming days and months bring us heartening tales of strangers
    saving lives under duress and students courageously helping one another in
    the face of danger.  It is a sad truth that we live in a world perhaps even
    more brutal than the centuries- old one Harding sings of.  It seems that
    after all these years, we would grow accustomed to our failings, but our
    communal shock is a reflection of our eternal hope for improvement.  And
    that hope just might be our saving grace.</p></div>"|3741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3741-trad-arr-jones/|7.3|Neil Lieberman

Y'know why?  Okay, okay, if you're gonna drag it out of me,
    I guess I'll tell you-- I'm moving from Minneapolis to Chicago in less
    than three weeks.  And I'm taking Pitchfork with me.  It's strange, really,
    to think about the dramatic changes that are gonna take place in my life
    in such a short period of time.  I mean, for starters, I've sold my car.
    What a major shift, going from a reliable little Geo Metro to public
    transportation.  And I can't wait.</p><p>
    
    The beautiful thing about Chicago is that, unlike Minnesota, people actually
    talk to each other.  In Minneapolis, if you talk to someone in the line at
    the movie theater, they get all nervous and twitchy.  It's also slightly warmer
    there than it is in Minneapolis (though they get more snow).  And best of all,
    everyone's completely laidback.  Now, maybe I'm just glamorizing the place
    'cause I'm excited about going there, but I've got proof about the laidback
    thing.</p><p>
    
    Take, for instance, Chicago's burgeoning post-rock music scene.  Bands like
    Tortoise, Isotope 217, Gastr del Sol, and Stereolab create nothing but the
    smoothest, jazziest rock you've ever fallen in love with.  And Sam Prekop's
    first self- titled solo effort's in the same category.</p><p>
    
    You might recognize Sam from his full- time band, the Sea and Cake, another
    of the many brilliant post-rock outfits coming out of the Windy City.  But
    as with most musicians who front bands and make solo records on the side,
    you have to wonder what the difference is between the artist's solo music
    and the band's music.  Well, in this case, the main difference is that 
    Prekop's solo stuff is way more toned- down than most Sea and Cake stuff.
    Which actually sounds better.</p><p>
    
    On his first solo outing, Prekop seems to have both accidentally epitomized
    the Chicago post-rock sound, and added new elements to it.  Produced by
    Gastr del Sol's amazing Jim O'Rourke (who also plays on the record), the
    album comes off, production-wise, like a softer <i>Camoufleur</i>.  Musically,
    it's warm, relaxing, and almost glowing.  You can almost feel the wind coming
    off Lake Michigan on a warm summer day.</p><p>
    
    Songs like the head- bobbing, pop groove ""The Company,"" the gentle and
    sublime ""A Cloud to the Back,"" the melancholy ""Don't Bother,"" and the
    Stereolab-ish, French funk of the record's closer, ""So Shy"" blend seamlessly
    into one another, held together by rich instrumentals like invisible Krazy
    Glue.</p><p>
    
    Just as old 1940s Chicago blues 78s capture the feeling of depression- era
    Chi-town, Sam Prekop's solo record encapsulates the city in the late 1990s.
    Try listening to this on the Blue Line from Clark/Lake to Wicker Park and
    see if you're still skeptical.</p></div>"|6455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6455-sam-prekop/|8.9|Ryan Schreiber

They're Autechre, folks-- Sean Booth
    and Rob Brown.  Since 1993, these guys have been inventing, tweaking,
    twiddling, programming and creating the strangest sounds on this Planet
    Earth.  A good reason to love them, but not good enough.  See, to truly
    love a band, they've gotta actually stimulate you.  They gotta activate your
    mind.  Lucky for them, they do that, too.  Otherwise, they'd be... I
    don't know, nameless bedroom losers emulating the Chemical Brothers or
    something.</p><p>
    
    But Autechre don't emulate.  And if they did, I'm sure they'd find someone
    better to copy than the Chemical Brothers.  Instead, they do their own thing--
    a thing of beauty.  Is it hard to describe?  You bet your ass, and thanks
    for asking.  But allow me to give it a shot.  Imagine what it'd sound like
    if Donkey Kong got his arm caught in a massive salad shooter.  Or how it
    might sound if a drum machine attacked a Pokemon.  Yeah, now you're getting
    somewhere.</p><p>
    
    But here's the deal with electronic music: you've got emulators, inventors
    and the inbetween.  And on a scale of one to ten-- ten being the most inventious
    of inventors-- Autechre rack up about a nine.  When you hear them, you'll
    know why.  Purchase, ye!  I encourage thee.  Go and discover!  Seek!  Find!</p><p>
    
    As for all y'all who're already Autechre fans, mark these words: this is
    not your average Peel Session.  Sure, it's about 30 minutes long, but that's
    where the comparisons between this and, say, That Petrol Emotion's <i>Peel
    Sessions</i> end.  What you get is some serious-ass Autechre improv, brand new
    songs composed on the spot.  Remarkably, they don't sound dramatically different
    from the songs on last year's <i>LP5</i> (also referred to simply as
    <i>Autechre</i> 'cause it didn't acutally have a title).  On ""Milk DX"" and
    ""Inhake 2,"" the beats jump and twitch like some b-movie zombie OD'ing on coke,
    and the shimmery, computer tones glisten in pools of warm liquid goo.  But on
    ""Drone,"" <i>Peel Sessions</i>' third and final track, the band experiments
    with a rhythm that sounds more like an old- school lawn sprinkler than a
    computer hard drive, and a sci-fi doom orchestra that crescendos and gradually
    builds before becoming a distorted vortex opening into Dimension X.</p><p>
    
    So, the low-down is, ""Milk DX"" and ""Inhake 2"" are your typical Autechre, with
    the band doing things their own way, yet with a good deal of predictibility.
    ""Drone"" is Autechre at their most amazing, creating psychedelic freakouts and
    other- worldly soundscapes that attack the senses as much as they massage them.
    Beautiful Autechre.  Dreamy Autechre.  So Peely before mine ears.</p></div>"|361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/361-peel-session/|7.7|Ryan Schreiber

    was a little sticker on it with a quote extolling the virtues of Pole's
    experimental electronic update on dub. I got the record home and heard
    nothing of the kind. Yeah, it had some deep bass here and there, but I
    couldn't see how the sterile electronic production or the random, buzzing
    sonic excursions could be compared to the sticky, free- flowing ambience
    of dub. I mean, I still liked it, but I found myself confused by the
    comparison. Now, with Pole's latest offering, the EP <i>CD 2</i>, I
    understand.</p><p>
<i>CD 2</i> brings to the forefront the catchier, more rhythm- oriented
    side of Pole's (somewhat limited) musical personality. Or, as the
    electronic eggheads of the European continent from whence Pole sprang
    would probably describe it, the music on <i>CD 2</i> is ""Sound with a
    bit more organization."" There are very clear patterns, choruses even
    (well, kind of...), that bring a little funk to the table. A little
    bid-a-boom to go with that digital sshhh...</p><p>
    
    Now, this is ambient electronic minimalism I'm talking about, so I mean 
    it when I say ""a little"" funk. But that small bit makes a big difference. 
    And when combined with the dry, yet spacious production environment that 
    brings to mind a microprocessor's idea of what comes out of a Jamaican 
    mixing board, these patterns make for a fun EP.  And the ""pure sine waves, 
    hold the overtones please"" kind of bottom end is the clincher. So,
    I'm sold-- a cold electronic version of dub.  They nailed it.</p></div>"|6372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6372-cd-2/|7.2|Mark Richard-San

    something called <i>brand equity</i>. They wring their thin, pale little
    hands and devise new and interesting ways to separate us from our money
    before our competitors do. Brand equity is business- speak for the nebulous
    <i>feeling</i> that consumers get when they buy/ eat/ smell/ hear/ watch a
    product. It's a vague representation for the idea that people will buy a
    product if they think it's good, even if it ain't.</p><p>
    
    Looking around, I see more than a few companies resting on their brand
    equity laurels. Perceived value is almost as good at the bank these days as
    real cash, but when it comes to music, brand equity stops here, with your
    Pitchfork reviewer. We don't get no money, so you can rest easy that we're
    not only unbiased, but also completely disinterested in the careers of the
    artists we review. For example, I'm not afraid to tell you now that after six
    months of Coca-Cola addiction, my eyes looked like pissholes in the snow, my
    skin was a pale shade of yellow, and I lost all feeling in my testicles. Has
    Pepsi sponsored me? No, I just tells it like it is, kidz.</p><p>
    
    Which brings me to Coldcut's <i>Let Us Replay!</i>. I am pleased to
    announce that Coldcut has built up a brand equity among both my peers and
    myself that is almost unmatched among electroids. Since their release of
    1989's critically lauded and just plain phat <i>What's That Noise?</i>,
    then 1997's <i>Let Us Play!</i>, not to mention the barrage of remix discs
    (<i>Timber</i>, <i>More Beats + Pieces</i> and <i>Boot The System/ Atomic
    Moog 2000</i>), they have consistently generated groundbreaking and just
    plain <i>cool</i> toonz for the electrically eclectic. <i>Let Us Replay!</i>
    is no exception. Germinated from the seeds of <i>Let Us Play!</i>, <i>Let Us
    Replay!</i> is so much more than yer standard remix disc that I hesitate to
    mention the connection here. However, the Coldcut- initiated will indeed
    recognize ""Atomic Moog 2000,"" ""Panopticon,"" ""More Beats + Pieces"" and others,
    if in name only, for these trax recall their predecessors like a whiff of
    smoke recalls a cigarette.</p><p>
    
    And the names! Oh, the names! I feel myself moistening as I look over the
    tracklist! Mmmmoooohh. Did you say DJ Food, Grandmaster Flash, Silent Poets,
    Irresistible Force and Carl Craig? Hell yessits! Not to mention the
    introduction of new(ish) tracks ""Last Night A Cliche Saved My Life,""
    ""Border"" and ""The Tale of Miss Virginia Epitome,"" which features Salina
    Saliva telling a grizzly tale of re-grown hymens. All in all, <i>Let Us
    Replay!</i> makes the grade, and then some, including a demo disc (for
    free) of Coldcut's new video/ audio editing software! Now that's
    <i>value</i>! Brand equity, kids! Moore &amp; Black, the jammers, the
    rippers, the mixmasters, they rule! Brand equity!</p></div>"|1535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1535-let-us-replay/|8.9|James P. Wisdom

    faithful reader. Sad thing is, there ain't much to say.</p><p>
    
    The concept behind this music is plausible-- relatively easy techno grooves
    filled with '70s disco sampling and flava. But I found myself too often

    Maybe I need some coke to truly delight in the seething vacancy of <i>1999</i>,
    but I'm pretty sure that it's clearly not <i>happening</i>.</p><p>
    
    Don't get me
    wrong-- as pure dance music, this album can stand side by side with the legions
    of house, techno and rave comps that stress booties on their covers.  I mean,
    it could just be the pompous prick in me, but I've come to expect a more
    <i>cerebral</i> quality from Astralwerks artists. Sure, there are some decent
    tracks-- the synthesizer in ""La Monde"" is a squeezy delight.  I'm sure ""Foxy""
    is pumping out the loudspeakers of a club somewhere as you read this.  And
    ""Club Soixante Quinze"" is just plain groovy.  However, it's pretty tepid
    overall depite its origins in France, the beloved land of quirky DJs. Don't

Yes, I'll explain:</p><p>
    Once upon a time, there was Steve Martin, a man with a plan to make us
    all laugh.  His preferred method of inducing laughter was absurdity,
    doing his ""Ramblin' Man"" thang for a while before finally finding a
    shortcut called ""Excuuuuuuse me!"" You kids these days may not
    know it, but if you said those two words just right, the whole wide
    world of 1976 was on their knees, suffocating with laughter.
    Continuing his domination by laughter, Martin did a few movies, most
    notably ""The Jerk,"" one of the finest feature films of all time.</p><p>
    Public opinion on ""Just how funny is this Steve Martin guy, anyhow?""
    took a downslide once the '80s began.  His movies remained true to his
    desire to be Mr. Absurd (""The Man With Two Brains"" probably being the apex
    of the truly hilarious/ nobody cares period), until finally he began to
    shift gears... crashing head on into a 1986 mess called ""The Three Amigos.""
    A horrible, unfunny film, Martin nonetheless recovered just a year later
    with ""Roxanne"" and one of his finest works, ""Planes Trains and Automobiles.""</p><p>
    Do you see where I'm going with this?  Oh, wait.  I haven't even gotten
    there.  Martin went right into the toilet shortly thereafter, trying to
    first become more sitcom- friendly (""Houseguest""), then semi- dramatic
    (""Leap of Faith""), until he released a movie that nobody went to see called
    ""A Simple Twist of Fate.""  Released in 1993, this was a seriously tragic
    and poorly- done flick about a man and his pet orphan who, if you can
    imagine, becomes the focus of a nasty custody dispute.</p><p>
    When I first heard about this ""Fate"" bullshit, I thought it was a joke. 
    Catching a few minutes of it a couple of weeks back, I was stunned.  Here
    was a man who used to be in sync with that white noise comedy Robin Williams
    also excelled at.  And, by the way, look at the unfortunate high grosses for
    ""Patch Adams.""  Williams can at least laugh all the way to the bank with his
    betrayal of funny.  Martin had to flop yet again with ""The Out of Towners,""
    but not before he did the also not- too- funny ""Sgt. Bilko.""</p><p>
    Oh, yeah.  Mojave 3.  Three of these kids used to be in a band called
    Slowdive.  Slowdive was to shoegazing what Steve Martin was to funny
    circa 1979.  Slowdive wasn't more complex than their notorious peers, My
    Bloody Valentine, and they weren't as drunk as Ride, but they sure did
    make some purdy rekkids.  Of course, they had to eventually blow off
    what they were good at to make their own ""Simple Twist of Fate,"" an
    unfortunate album called <i>Ask Me Tomorrow</i>.  And in their desire to
    be taken seriously, they cast off what made 'em so goddamned good in the
    first place.</p><p>
<i>Out of Tune</i> isn't a step back into Slowdive mode, but it is a much
    more winsome affair than <i>Tomorrow</i>.  I had more hopes just based on
    the cover alone.  (If there are any of those giant Eurpoean subway posters
    for this floating around, I have a wall in dire need of beauty.)  Neil
    Halstead and Rachel Goswell sing a little differently than back in the
    day, going aurally naked (sans a zillion effects) and stepping out into
    the SoCal pot- happy sunshine folk- rock thing they're doing now.  No, it
    doesn't sound like the Eagles, but a few cuts remind me of that godawful
    shit Ethan Hawke got to sing.  Okay, not really, but somewhere Ethan
    Hawke is just popping a boner because someone mentioned his name in the
    press again.</p><p>
    So, what do I think overall?  It's not as meaty as it could be.  Whereas
    Slowdive's lyrics were more enigmatic (or maybe appeared to be through a
    fog of tremelo), Mojave 3 goes for those bold statements that annoy me.
    Check these songs titles: ""Who Do You Love"" (no, not that one), ""Some Kinda
    Angel"" (where Goswell conjures up some Stevie Nicks mojo), ""All Your Tears,""
    ""Baby's Coming Home..."" you get the idea.  Lots of acoustic guitars, organ,
    some pedal steel, and harmonies make this a pleasant enough sort of listen
    as long as I take a bong hit and stare at the cover.</p><p>
    Or, to boil it all down into one sentence, this could very well be the
    first 4AD album to be fully embraced by both AAA radio stations and your
    mom.  File it somewhere between ""Housesitter"" and ""Father of the Bride.""</p><p>
<b>Post Review Note:</b> I just got back from Cellophane Square music store
    on University Avenue in Seattle, and I guess I should mention that,
    according to a Mojave 3 display, a clerk named Karrie really digs the
    songs ""Caught Beneath Your Feet"" and ""This Road I'm Traveling."" I'm not
    doing this to hit on her-- I didn't ask for Karrie and for all I know she's
    an ugg-o-- but if you're a rabid Mojave 3 fan who doesn't like what I have
    to say, take Karrie's endorsement to heart.</p></div>"|5376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5376-out-of-tune/|6.3|Jason Josephes

Sometimes I just     love to pretend to be a record reviewer!  In my last review, I stated that     Don Caballero was ""creating cohesive songs from the cacaphony of frenetically     beaten drums."" Yeah, right! More like creating a goopy mess of my brain between     my ears.</p>
<p>Well, here I find myself, living a Dilbert- like existence, not even given     the dignity of a cubicle, forced to isolate myself the only way I know how:     headphones filled with grunchy, mean toonz. Sure, sometimes I listen to porn     MPEGs or NPR's <i>This American Life</i>, but when I'm given a particularly     enervating task-- something like, say, stapling-- I like to put my head     between the hairy thighs of Don Caballero. Sure, it smells a little     funky down there, and all's I can hear is the pounding of drums upon my     skull, but I like it. I see it as an expression against the machine of     oppression, man! Yeah, oppression...</p>
<p>Don C., in case you've been too lazy to go back and read the earlier review,     is intense, indie jam-rok of the highest order. Perhaps you've got friends     that like to noodle around with offbeat guitar themes and love to hammer     their drum sets without mercy. Perhaps they drink malt liquor and smell like     clove cigarettes. Perhaps they stick sharp, barbed objects into their     bottoms. Perhaps you have a very vague idea of what we're talking about here:     jamming. Stinky, sore- bottomed jamming. Inspired, sore- bottomed jamming.     Wikked, sharp, tight, sore- bottomed jamming. No lyrics, no mandolin, no     techno beats or phat rhymes, just pure, glorious, sore- bottomed jamming.     Thank You Jesus!</p>
<p>So, <i>Singles Breaking Up (Vol 1)</i> collects the band's EP and compilation     releases into one, easy- to- use compact disc. Convenient, and perfect for the     on- the- go individual, <i>Singles</i> has the texture you'd expect from     such a collection-- lacking the overall continuity that <i>What     Burns Never Returns</i> possessed, it serves to chronicle their progress     since 1992, before they even released their first album, 1993's <i>For     Respect</i>.  Since this stuff is clearly marketed to instrumento-geeks     and weirdos, I would suggest you take a large dose of Ketamine before     enjoying.  And don't forget to stick a sharp, barbed object into your bottom!</p></div>"|2413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2413-singles-breaking-up-volume-one/|7.2|James P. Wisdom

    sad sack such as America's Funnyman.  Hamburger-- aka Gregg Turkington--
    takes his routine to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, warming up the locals
    before karaoke time.  Too bad nobody in the audience speaks or
    understands English.</p><p>
    
    It's a broad setup knocked down with Hamburger's usual patheticness. 
    (Sample joke:  ""How many Spice Girls does it take to screw in a
    lightbulb?  Well, it was five, now it's four, and I'm sure any day now
    it'll be down to three.  Uh, huhhhh..."")  Early on in the show,
    Hamburger realizes no one in the crowd speaks English and, worse yet,
    his manager and right- hand man Art Huckman flees the scene in a huff. 
    With no one left to lean on, Neil opens up about his past gigs
    performing at Amway conventions, his failed marriage, and a little
    something called ""Montezuma's Revenge.""</p><p>
    
    Is it funny?  Not really, but that's the point.  <i>Left for Dead in
    Malaysia</i> is forty minutes of flop sweats, so much so that you might
    feel moist after listening.  As usual, the joke is on Hamburger; is there
    a bigger loser on the planet than this guy?  <a href=""http://al.radparker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yes</a>,
    but the flat routine on <i>Left for Dead</i> may have you thinking
    otherwise.  Hamburger (or Turkington, to be more precise) hits the
    desperation nail square on the head, but <i>Raw Hamburger</i> and <i>America's
    Funnyman</i> both fared a lot better.  I'm sure that there's going to be
    another Neil Hamburger album-- the stage is easily set for this loser to
    sink even lower-- and those who enjoyed the previous albums will enjoy
    <i>Left for Dead</i> more than the folks who don't get the joke.  But there
    aren't really any jokes on this album, just a series of empty shells and
    failed observations... classic Hamburger.</p></div>"|3723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3723-left-for-dead-in-malaysia/|6.5|Jason Josephes
