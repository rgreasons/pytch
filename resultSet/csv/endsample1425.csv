    and mastermind behind Phthalocyanine, was the first American artist to be
    represented on the stellar German experimental label, A-Musik. His first single
    was released on Plug Research, the one American label whose output will soon
    rival sultan-of-the scene, Warp. The microtonal glitch stable, Mille Plateaux,
    called Fergadis in for remix work on Crank's
<i>
 Wanton Phenomena
</i>
and Richie
    Hawtin's buddy Vapourspace (aka Mark Gage) did the same for his ""Steam"" single.
    After Planet \xB5 founder Mike Paradinas called Fergadis ""a genius,"" that label
    released Phthalocyanine's
<i>
 25 Tracks Fer 1 Track
</i>
album.</p><p>
 When Fergadis isn't screening his phone calls, he runs his Phthalo imprint, which
    appears to operate with the same aesthetic and disdain for convention as lo-fi
    maverick Mike Newell's cassette-only Man at the Off-License label. Quite a few
    of Phthalo's releases are CDR-only, and the packaging is unequivocally
    rudimentary. But who gives a gnat's nut when the music is as fucking amazing as
    this?</p><p>
 A clear testament to the quality of the Phthalo label lies with its esteemed
    roster: Finnish techno maestro Vladislav Delay released material under his
    Sistol alias; former Strictly Ballroom-er Jimmy Tamborello offered his first
    Dntel albums,
 <i>
  Early Works for Me If It Works for You
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Something
    Always Goes Wrong
 </i>
 ; glitch maven Kit Clayton used the imprint as an outlet
    for his most extreme noise terror joint,
 <i>
  Shortwave Live
 </i>
 .
</p><p>
 But Fergadis' own releases are far more subdued.  Though listeners may initially
    be distracted, and possibly even phased, by the Merzbow-like distortion Fergadis
    applies to most of his frantic drum patterns, the four untitled tracks that
    comprise
 <i>
  Zacks
 </i>
 eventually reveal themselves to be profoundly relaxing.
    Relaxing, how?  I find Fergadis' combining of semi-melodious primitive synths
    (on the second track, they sound especially close to the sounds Aphex used on
 <i>
  Selected Ambient Works 85-92
 </i>
 ) and the Elvin Jones-style splatter-percussion
    to be truthful.  Truthful?  To me most ambient music refuses to grapple with the
    ambience of existence. Fluffy excursions into pan-flutes can never acknowledge
    that our everyday lives are surrounded by dangers-- whether they be car accidents,
    a sudden myocardial infarction, or inhaling terrorist-deployed biotoxins.
</p>
<p>
 For me, Fergadis depicts this reality, but not as a cold reportage. In its own
    way, his music represents daily hazards, just as Muslimgauze musically engaged
    in the debate over the future of the Palestinian people.  He may not have such
    an edgy subject, but it's a universal one.  The crescendo and decrescendos of
 <i>
  Zacks
 </i>
 ' third track, to me, stand for the successes and failures of
    existence. Even amidst the most shredding of percussion attacks (most of track
    four), a precious bent-jazz beauty shines through.
</p>
<p>
 If you're not prepared to head straight into such a gyre of contrasts, but are
    interested in investigating Phthalocyanine, I recommend starting with the
    expanded
 <i>
  Viridian
 </i>
 EP.  It's vintage
 <i>
  Tri-Repetae++
 </i>
 -era Autechre
    dissolved in the hazy ambience of Seefeel's
 <i>
  Polyfusia
 </i>
 mini-LP.  But
    regardless of which release you choose, you're guaranteed to catch the first
    wave of an artist destined for greatness.

    math-rock outfit Chisel Drill Hammer. There was something so very Chicago
    about that record, from the Albini recording to the geometric packaging to the
    Slint-strumental guitar rock that wasn't really rock.  Even with my limited
    exposure to the scene, I had a vague feeling that Hughes was trying to cast
    Hefty in the Thrill Jockey mold.  Chisel Drill Hammer braced me for a spate of
    uninspired copies.</p><p>
    
    Thrill Jockey still seems like an inspiration, but Hefty seems to have overhauled
    the quality control department. The label still keeps a finger in the post-rock
    pie, and like Thrill Jockey, also dabbles in fusion and free jazz. But lately,
    electronic music seems to be coming to the fore for Hefty. Unlike Thrill Jockey,
    which licenses most of its experimental electronic music from Europe, Hefty's
    IDM talent pool is drawn primarily from the States, with releases by Scott
    Herren (as Savath + Savalas), Twine, and Hughes himself (as Slicker).</p><p>
    
    In late 2000, Hefty released a series of 12-inches under the heading <i>Immediate
    Action</i>. These records had a limited print run and were packaged and presented
    in a simple manner intended to keep the focus on the music. In addition to
    featuring artists from the Hefty stable, <i>Immediate Action</i> releases included
    exclusive tracks and remixes from artists on others imprints. If you weren't
    one of the 700-or-so people to acquire each vinyl release, you have a second
    chance, as Hefty has gathered the tracks together on two shiny, portable compact
    discs. Casting aside the aim of the original vinyl issues, <i>Immediate Action</i>
    is a fine collection on its own, and a perfect example of what a multi-artist
    label compilation should be. Like Mille Plateaux's famous compilations,
    <i>Immediate Action</i> avoids the tired ""here are some tracks by some artists
    on our label"" approach in favor of a wide-ranging statement of belief.</p><p>
    
    And what does Hefty believe in?  While the styles on display throughout
    <i>Immediate Action</i> are familiar to followers of experimental indie music
    (glitch, machine dub, jazz fusion, etc.), Hefty seems to show a preference for
    accessibility, and few tracks could be described as cold, sterile or abstract.
    Hearing Scott Herren's organic work as Savath + Savalas again, after time spent
    with to his Delarosa + Asora and Prefuse 73 guises, is illuminating. ""Two Blues
    for Marion Brown"" is mellow electric jazz with glowing keyboards, a patient
    rhythm and distant hints of machine noise. ""Yesterday's Throwaway and Reprise,""
    with its double bass, vibes, and crisp drumming, moves even further from the
    hard-drive IDM and glitch-hop of more recent Herren projects.</p><p>
    
    Also on the jazzy tip is the Samadha Trio, a groovy combo with a forthcoming
    Hefty full-length. They remind me of a more relaxed Medeski, Martin and Wood with
    a penchant for heavy post-production. Live recordings of the electric
    keyboard/bass/drum trio are tweaked and reconfigured into a refreshing and
    slightly disorienting mix. The rhythm in ""Amidha"" drops out suddenly as bits of
    static bubble through, while the Bill Evans-ish acoustic piano in ""Satoric""
    competes with a background conversation that could be a film sample.</p><p>
    
    England's Process represents the less musical end of <i>Immediate Action</i>'s
    spectrum, but even his computerized soundscapes are engaging and accessible.
    ""Define"" seeks the warm cloud of static Jan Jelinek likes to float in, while
    ""Diffusion"" touches on the slightly harsh industrial drone music of Janek
    Schaefer. In a similar vein is Twine's excellent ""Surn,"" which combines a regal
    piano melody with digital noise and a hesitant, unsteady beat. Further diversity
    comes from Johnny Herndon of Tortoise and Isotope 217, who contributes two
    inviting tracks of melodic electronic dub under the unfortunate moniker A Grape
    Dope.</p><p>
    
    Most interesting on <i>Immediate Action</i> are the tracks where Reaktor
    programming meets pop vocals. Bogdan Raczynski's remix of Hughes' ""Yet You're
    Here"" find him immersing Hughes' deep voice in the crunchy, music-box-gone-wrong
    sound so prevalent on his recent full-length, <i>My Love I Love</i>. Better
    still is the Slicker collaboration with the Aluminum Group on ""Next Time,"" which
    contrasts rich machine noises with the dry, brittle sound of Navin's typically
    crafty vocal. An album-length project with these two camps would be more than
    welcome.</p><p>
<i>Immediate Action</i> finds Hefty in the thick of what's happening in the
    crowded zone between indie rock and the experimental electronic fringe. The
    label is gaining character and complexity with age, and this encouraging
    two-disc set feels much more ""pre"" than ""post.""</p></div>"|1905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1905-immediate-action/|7.9|Mark Richard-San

Druck-kyoos.  Drug use?  Or just another one of the Twin's
    cryptic pranks?  Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p>
    After two years of public silence and what many had judged to be his final exit
    from the world of corporate music, the original IDM iconoclast has returned with
    another puzzle.  The problem with <i>Drukqs</i>, a two-disc, 30-track medley
    that allegedly wraps up Richard D. James' contract with Warp Records, is that
    there's really no puzzle at all.</p><p>
    This album charts familiar Aphex territory, surveying styles he's plied on
    previous records, rather than suggesting new directions.  It says something that
    Aphex enthusiasts expect James to reinvent himself with every record, and that
    the general reaction to this album (which has been trading hands over online
    piracy channels for months) has been somewhat unenthusiastic.  From a man who
    has made a career staying a step ahead of his fans, an album as conventional as
    <i>Drukqs</i> comes as a sad surprise.</p><p>
    The stylistic pastiche here mirrors many different points of James' career.  Most
    of the tracks are brief melodic exercises conducted on piano and harpsichord,
    styled after ""Nannou"" from the <i>Windowlicker</i> EP.  There are several purely
    electro-acoustic excursions, some in the cacophonous vein of the ""equation"" song
    on <i>Windowlicker</i>, others more reminiscent of the lysergic drone of
    <i>Selected Ambient Works II</i>.  ""Bbydhyonchord"" and ""Orban Eq Trx4"" emulate
    the rhythmic, sensual sounds of <i>Analogue Bubblebath 4</i>, or the softer
    facets of <i>I Care Because You Do</i>.  Abrasive electro pieces like ""Omgyjya
    Switch7"" and ""54 Cymru Beats"" steal the show, grafting drill-n-bass beats onto
    stark mechanical backdrops that recall James' early Joyrex releases.</p><p>
    But <i>Drukqs</i> showcases Aphex's crude instrumental contemplations to a fault.
    His production talents have their bounds, and they wear a little thin when he
    dons the mantle of artistic maturity, attempting to imitate Erik Satie.  ""Father,""
    ""Avril 14th,"" ""Strotha Tynhe"" and ""Jynweythek Ylow"" rove dangerously close to
    the Windham Hill new age aesthetic of the 80s.\t""Prep Gwarlek 3b"" and
    ""Kladfvgbung Micshk"" take the formula to a more sophisticated, brooding level,
    but fail to bring anything exciting to a sound that Philip Glass pioneered more
    boldly 25 years ago.  These languid noodlings comprise over half of the album;
    take them away and the cracks begin to show in <i>Drukqs</i>' monumental 30-song
    promise.  In the end, with all the filler, this monster packs a lot less punch
    than some of Aphex's shorter releases, like the legendary <i>Selected Ambient
    Works 85-92</i>, or the <i>Hangable Auto Bulb</i> EPs.</p><p>
    James fares better in other arenas.  A muffled, throbbing pulse propels ""Gwely
    Mernans"" through a macabre tableau of disembodied strings and white noise.
    Though not on par with the best ambient work in Aphex Twin's canon, this song
    weaves a compelling web of mood and texture.  ""Hy a Scullys Lyf a Dhagrow"" takes
    ambient music to the other extreme with a disjointed demonstration of
    ear-shattering sonic sleight.  ""Gwarek2,"" one of the most chilling additions yet
    to James' demented repertoire, sounds like a stripped down take on \xB5-Ziq's ""Mr.
    Angry.""  Tortured screams resonate through an abandoned foundry, joined by the
    unsettling clamor of clashing metal and screeching vermin.</p><p>
    ""Meltphace 6"" delivers in signature Aphex style, with brisk snares trading fire
    over a wash of solemn synthesizers, thick squelches and warbling, high-pitched
    flourishes.  ""Mt. Saint Michel Mix+St. Michael's Mount"" carries the torch,
    matching its relentless drill-n-bass torrents with simple, innocent refrains.
    In its final minutes, the song frays into a stuttering swarm of dissected,
    time-spaced samples-- certainly one of <i>Drukqs</i>' finer moments.</p><p>
    Other honorable mentions include ""Vordhosbn,"" whose wistful and occasionally
    dissonant timbre is offset by the biting ring of blistering drums.  Imagine
    ""IZ-US"" with Venetian Snares operating the drum kit, and you'll get the general
    picture.  The protean ""Ziggomatic v17"" runs through several movements-- frenzied
    electro breakcore and anthemic 4/4 warehouse techno, interspersed with lush
    melodic passages-- before tapering off with a soft refrain.</p><p>
    ""Taking Control"" is concentrated Aphex acid.  The scathing electro breaks and
    spliced, vocoded samples evoke memories of ""Humanoid Must Not Escape"" from
    <i>Joyrex J9</i>.  But the absence of engaging melody and firm structure keep
    ""Taking Control"" and a several other songs (""Cock/Ver10,"" ""Afx237 v7"") from
    really enveloping the listener.  The sterile, clinical feel and limited palette
    of the heavier electro numbers renders them grating, one-dimensional and
    sometimes entirely unlistenable.</p><p>
    Even the successful drill-n-bass pieces offer only shallow satisfaction.  They
    sound like throwbacks to the past rather than prospects on the future; and for
    all of their compositional strength, there's an element of the Aphex Twin
    mystique missing.</p><p>
    This record simply doesn't inspire the same degree of astonishment and awe as
    its predecessors-- seminal works like <i>I Care Because You Do</i>, <i>Selected
    Ambient Works II</i> and his last proper full-length, 1997's <i>The Richard D.
    James Album</i>, which not only struck fans on a personal level, but often
    reshaped the way they listened to music.  <i>Drukqs</i> speaks a familiar tongue,
    instead of inviting us to learn new languages; it gives us the answers before
    asking the riddles.  In this sense, it defies every expectation we had of Richard
    D. James.  But in hindsight, it seems to show that some conventions are worth
    following.</p></div>"|225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/225-drukqs/|5.5|Malcolm Seymour III

She is 68 years old, and has
    been hated longer than many of you have existed.  Ono's art, while internationally
    respected and admired for decades, has been overshadowed by a sect of music fans
    who believe she was responsible for tearing apart the great white hopes of rock
    and roll.  There are people who say she's still wreaking havoc by manipulating
    her murdered husband's image to suit her professional obligations and lifestyle
    of comfort beyond luxury.  There are even people who think it was she who
    should've taken the bullet all those years ago to spare us a lifetime of
    wondering whether the Four Saviors would come back to cure the world's ills.
    Yoko Ono is an artist and a wronged woman.</p><p>
    
    These are roles she has performed increasingly well with age.  Currently, the
    first American retrospective of her work is touring the United States.  The
    exhibition chronicles everything from her foray into the avant-garde conceptual
    art of the 1960s, to her bed-ins for peace with John Lennon, to her first solo
    records in the 1970s and 80s, to her concerts and Internet projects in the 1990s
    and today.  It seems that Ono would be able to establish her name without much
    help from her once-better half, but none of the exhibitions or press releases
    ever seem to dissuade the legions of grudge holders from her past.</p><p>
    
    Despite Ono's unfair treatment, she does leave herself open to a lot of valid
    criticism.  Primarily, as long as she makes records, there will always be the
    charge that she isn't really a singer, or even a musician.  Her first records
    with John Lennon didn't exactly ingratiate her to Beatle fans with their
    feedback-drenched, primal scream freak-outs.  She put out some solo discs in
    the early 70s (featuring many of the same musicians as were performing with
    Lennon at the time), but her brand of ""pop"" was rarely less confrontational than
    her public persona at the time.  The singing was usually closer to spoken word,
    and the melodies, while sometimes hummable, weren't exactly the kind that would
    end up in Nike commercials.  And of course, the freak-outs never really went
    away.</p><p>
    
    Some of the critical weight was lifted after her 1980 collaboration with Lennon,
    <i>Double Fantasy</i>, and her subsequent solo record <i>Season of Glass</i>,
    largely due to an emphasis on straightforward pop, though still with that
    instantly recognizable Ono croon.  More recently, she has taken to performing
    with her son, Sean Lennon.  <i>Rising</i>, from 1995, was a pairing of her usual
    avant-garde musings on angst, pain and fear, and the hard funk and alt-groove of
    Sean's rock trio, IMA.  Bringing her sound and vision up to date was an admirable
    step, especially for someone who was approaching legal retirement age, and her
    latest album, <i>Blueprint for a Sunrise</i>, continues in that vein.</p><p>
    
    Okay, so now you know the story.  If only digging the music was the next logical
    step.  <i>Blueprint</i> is something of a memoir for Ono's childhood in Japan,
    during World War II, and simultaneously a message in a bottle for frustrated
    women everywhere-- especially those who ""still live in fear because of the
    position they are put in as women in our society.""  How's that for conceptual
    art?  She goes the extra step by appearing on the cover as disgraced Chinese
    Empress Tz'u-hsi, a woman whose biggest claims to fame were selling out her
    country to British colonialists and killing her son.  As artistic statements go,
    this album (and perhaps Ono's career) is either the product of visionary genius,
    or one giant mixed signal.</p><p>
    
    ""I Want You to Remember Me"" (comprising the first two tracks as parts A and
    B) is rather brutal truth and consequences.  Yoko vocalizes both sides of a
    domestic dispute, channeling what must be some very bitter memories, over a
    heartbeat pulse.  This leads directly to a spacy jam wherein she un-tucks her
    patented Yoko shrieks and yodels.  ""Gotta kill, gotta kill, gotta kill,"" goes
    the hook, and before you start to check your locks, consider that she might be
    making some kind of abstract statement about the helplessness of many women.  Of
    course, I couldn't prove that, but I'm trying to give her the benefit of the
    doubt here.</p><p>
    
    Next up is Ono's version of the torch song, ""Is This What We Do.""  Leading off
    with some nice Spanish guitar (?), building to Metallica-style mega-ballad
    heaviness (??), and featuring Yoko doing her impression of the Asian Leonard
    Cohen (???), the song almost lets you off the hook unscathed, before she lets
    loose with more shrieking near the end.  That's alright, though, because the
    next tune, ""Wouldnit,"" is merely awkward.  Ono drops lines like ""Daddy, you
    can't touch me/ Mommy, you can't hate me/ I'm a star, get it?"" and ""Wouldnit,
    wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit, wouldnit,"" over a cocktail
    lounge groove destined for Hell's karaoke bars.</p><p>
    
    And lest you think Ono has forgotten her roots, consider ""Rising II"" and
    ""Mulberry.""  Combined, you have about 20 minutes of prime, live freaking.
    Sean accompanies his mother to unfettered aural catharsis, often sung in
    many languages at once.  Props to this family for pushing ahead when others
    are sitting down to TV dinners and Pictionary, but sometimes, when artists
    refuse to compromise, it makes it difficult to meet them halfway.  In short,
    I respect Ono's art; I just can't listen to a lot of it.</p><p>
<i>Blueprint for a Sunrise</i> isn't completely impregnable.  ""It's Time for
    Action"" is pretty good avant-funk along the lines of recent Peter Gabriel, and
    ""I Remember Everything,"" with the calmness of Ono's voice in the opening and
    some rather pretty guitar from her son, almost fools you into thinking she'd
    let you up for a moment to breathe.  I was sucked in until the Metallica
    power-balladry reared its head again, raising the question of just what music
    Sean is playing for his mom these days.</p><p>
    
    If you've made it this far in the review, I assume you must have at least a
    passing interest in Yoko Ono (or Metallica).  To that, I say, ""Congratulations.""
    You've successfully gone against trends and general consensus, and can accept
    her abstractions as the idiosyncrasies of an artist.  Objectively, I'm right
    there with you, and would add that the days of thinking of her as John Lennon's
    wife, or as the woman who broke up the Beatles should be forever put to rest.
    That said, I might need more traditional ""rock"" than her music is giving me,
    and though I'll never criticize someone who puts their soul on display for their
    art, I can't guarantee I'll be able to listen to it very long.</p></div>"|6010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6010-blueprint-for-a-sunrise/|5.6|Dominique Leone

Welcome to the <i>Pitchfork</i> review of <i>Zoo Sounds and
    Destructovision</i>, the debut EP from Utah!  Utah! are not actually from Utah!
    In fact, they hail from several thousand miles away, in Kalamazoo, Michigan!
    Amazing!  The real Utah (no exclamation point) is full of nifty geological
    eccentricities like buttes, stone arches, and a big, salty lake called Great
    Salt Lake, and lots of Mormons live there!  But the Utah! that I'm talking about
    here contains neither buttes nor arches, nor salty lakes, nor Mormons, so let
    there be no confusion!</p><p>
    
    That said, let's talk about what Utah! does contain!  Utah! consists of Eric
    Singer, who plays bass and baritone guitar (he doesn't sing, though), Eddie
    Pellino, who sings and plays guitar, Mickey D'Loughy, who hits some drums,
    and Anne Polesnak, who plays a mean cello, and sings a little bit!  If you
    enjoy long walks through twisty instrumental passages, spending time with a
    sensitive male vocalist, and curling up in front of your computer to watch
    low-budget music videos about socially rejected robots, this CD may be the
    match for you!  I'm getting sick of typing exclamation points, and you're
    likely sick of seeing them, so I'll stop now!  Really, I promise!</p><p>
<i>Zoo Sounds and Destructovision</i> presents a band who wouldn't have to do
    a whole lot to go from being simply passable to being outstanding.  For one
    thing, they're all skilled musicians-- this is obvious from the lengthy
    instrumental passages that find their way into every song.  For the moment,
    though, the most interesting interplay is between the cello, bass, and drums.
    The guitar, however, hasn't quite found its place in the intertwining lines,
    preferring to grind away in a cloud of heavy fuzz in the background.  This
    results in a texturally dense sound, which, though sometimes effective, often
    obscures the melodic substance of the songs, be it in the cello or the vocals.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, Pellino's earnest vocals-- reminiscent of a young Jeremy Enigk or Joe
    Davis from the Pinehurst Kids-- often find themselves a little bit buried in
    the mix.  It's not as though the melodies are that great, anyway, but being
    able to hear them better might help the listener remember them.  The other
    reason these songs don't tend to stick is that, in the instrumental sections,
    the band as a whole is often too content to simply ride a groove without
    offering any melodic material over the top.  Polesnak's cello occasionally
    begs comparisons to Hilary Soldati's outstanding work with Smart Went Crazy, but
    just as often, it kind of sits around with the other instruments, shooting the
    breeze and neglecting to entertain.</p><p>
    
    Singer's basslines add the rubbery bottom that brings each song to life-- it's
    his elastic fretboard stylings that jumpstart ""The Boy Who Gave Away the
    Bomb"" and ""Babette's Areola,"" interlocking with D'Loughy's frenetic drumming
    perfectly.  D'Loughy could best be described as a busy drummer, and man, does
    he like his snare!  (Sorry!)  There are songs on this EP where I swear he
    doesn't even use toms.  In the context of Utah!'s music, though, his active
    style and heavy snare abuse work well to push the proceedings along.  The snare
    also cuts through the dense, bass-heavy mix better than any other drum.</p><p>
    
    And with that, we come to the part of the review where we discuss the disc's
    added value features.  Yes, Utah! believe in giving you more for your money,
    and in this spirit, they have included a short film called ""Robot 2: You're
    Strange If You Know"" in the multimedia portion of this disc.  Let me begin
    discussing this film by saying that I've read reviews of this EP which detail
    the existential ramifications of said film and speak of its power and meaning.
    This will not be one of those reviews.</p><p>
    
    Rather, I'll mention the fact that the movie has a certain amateurish charm to
    it that's hard to deny, but it hardly bears more than one or two views.
    Essentially, it centers on a big, clunky, humanoid robot who tries to go to a
    concert being given by an especially heavy emo band in a dingy basement, and
    gets driven off by the band's fans (possibly because he's not emotional enough).
    He then attempts to join a card game at a party, but is again shunned by the
    human participants.  He wanders back to the concert, where he headbangs for a
    bit (this is very amusing, by the way) and gets kicked out again.</p><p>
    
    Despondent, he walks to the river and stares at the moon.  He flashbacks to his
    birth.  There are shots from the ground of men with blowtorches in surgical
    masks, while subtitles that plaintively ask, ""Why are they making me?"" fade in
    and out until the movie ends with a shot of our dejected hero sitting alone on
    the waterfront.  The lesson we take away from this, of course, is that we should
    all be nicer to big, clunky robots.  Because, after all, they just want to fit
    in.  This moral should also apply to men dressed in big, clunky robot suits.
    They have feelings, too, you know.</p><p>
    
    Overall, the movie is a cute diversion that adds little value to the package as
    a whole, but only provides amusement for a short time.  As for the EP itself,
    Utah! definitely have an interesting sound that's worth exploring.  With a
    little more focus on melody and some stronger songs, they have the potential to
    make a very interesting debut album.  Unfortunately, Utah! haven't quite
    perfected their sound yet here, and it makes for a fairly unmemorable record.
    Here's hoping for more in the future!</p></div>"|8375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8375-zoo-sounds-and-destructovision-ep/|5.9|Joe Tangari

    but chances are, it's going to be his work with the Velvet Underground. Even so,
    it would be shortsighted to think that his influence and importance in the last
    40 years began and ended with the Velvets. Cale's rarely stopped moving in the
    three decades since VU disbanded, constantly shedding skins and adopting the
    role of shapeshifter: he's been an acclaimed solo artist (<i>Paris 1919</i>,
    <i>Fear</i>), a producer (Patti Smith's <i>Horses</i>, the Stooges, the Modern
    Lovers), a collaborator (Terry Riley, Nico, Brian Eno) and a soundtrack composer
    (<i>Somewhere in the City</i>).</p><p>
    
    Much has been made in the avant-garde community about La Monte Young's Theater
    of Eternal Music (or Dream Syndicate), of which Cale was a member, along with
    Tony Conrad, Marian Zazeela and original VU drummer Angus Maclise. Last year saw
    the first release of their notorious 1965 recording, <i>Inside the Dream
    Syndicate, Volume 1: Day of Niagara</i>, a brief live representation of what
    the group was trying to accomplish in the mid-60s. Even with the extremely lo-fi
    sound quality, it's obvious that the Dream Syndicate collective was dabbling in
    sound worlds theretofore untouched-- minimalist drones, hypnotic chants and
    scraping noise barrages. Now the exhumation of several archival recordings sheds
    light on another dimension in Cale's chameleonic nature.</p><p>
<i>Sun Blindness Music</i> captures some of Cale's home improvisations during a
    period paralleling that of the Velvets' most provocative work (1965-68). It's
    the first disc of three in a series of unearthed Cale compositions from Table of
    the Elements (all released under the heading <i>New York in the 1960s</i>),
    documenting his solo experiments and collaborations with other members of New
    York's avant-garde underground. Collecting dust in Tony Conrad's possession for
    years, these tapes were probably all but forgotten by everyone excepting possibly
    Conrad and Cale. Some will undoubtedly argue they should have stayed that way.</p><p>
    
    The record is comprised of three tracks, two of which are centered on Cale's
    experiments with a Vox Continental organ.  Its title track is an incredibly
    extended improvisation consisting of just Cale and the Vox. Without any real
    structure, Cale fools around with minimalist sound dimensions. He jams keys into
    place, locks into a series of drones, mounts pressure on the organ, clusters
    notes and creates a dissonant wash of noise. At times, Cale occupies himself
    with an escalating build of resonant, booming drones; other times, drones
    disintegrate into silence as Cale fumbles for another cluster of keys to wedge
    in place.</p><p>
    
    Unlike what most people perceive as minimalism, this opening track is propelled
    by momentous force, dynamism and sweat. It can be both mesmerizing and
    disconcerting, often within a brief time span.  Regardless, at 42 minutes, it's
    an endurance test no matter who's listening. However, for those willing to
    provide full attention and look past the somewhat lo-fi sound, it can be a
    meditative piece of work filled with vibrating textures and radiating intensity.</p><p>
    
    Beyond the difficult and lengthy nature of ""Sun Blindness Music,"" the remainder
    of the album is slightly more accessible. ""Summer Heat"" is a raucous
    guitar-driven track where everything is awash with massive distortion. The final
    result sounds more like pounding percussion than guitar strumming. Predating
    stuff like Glenn Branca's guitar symphonies, Arnold Dreyblatt's ""sound of one
    string"" experiments, and even partner Lou Reed's <i>Metal Machine Music</i> by
    several years, this track is a murky, percussive sludgefest. Thundering on for
    about 11 minutes, it's an early and brilliant attempt at merging the sounds of
    rock with minimalism.  Sadly, the poor sound quality of the tapes rears its head
    toward the song's end when the distorted guitars are unceremoniously stopped
    midstream by tape warble, segueing into the third and final track, ""The Second
    Fortress.""</p><p>
    
    Though the only instrument credited on this last song is ""electronic sounds,""
    it's actually Cale manipulating his Vox again, this time into a series of
    high-pitched drones. The sound here borders on the popular conception of
    minimalist music, with repetitious ambient textures. Gone are the obvious
    crammed-into-place keys and pressured sustain of ""Sun Blindness Music."" They've
    been replaced with the musician coaxing a shimmering series of drones out of his
    organ. The pulsating texture is still present, but the pace gives the impression
    of gliding along into soundscape territory as opposed to the fevered swells of
    the title track.</p><p>
    
    For musical archaeologists, this disc is only the beginning of an archival dig.
    With two more discs to be released in the coming months, you'd think Table of
    the Elements had cornered the market on these historic minimalist documents.
    And they pretty much have. Along with the aforementioned <i>Day of Niagara</i>,
    there's also the scraping, extreme drones of Tony Conrad's <i>Four Violins</i>
    box set. Siltbreeze tried their hand at it, as well, and released a couple of
    highly recommended Angus Maclise recordings, <i>The Invasion of Thunderbolt
    Pagoda</i> and <i>Brain Damage in Oklahoma City</i>.  Meanwhile, La Monte Young
    is still sitting on a treasure chest of Theater of Eternal Music recordings,
    though the likelihood of them being released in the near future is minimal.</p><p>
    
    Taken with everything else, the new Cale disc rests perfectly amongst the other
    historical documents. And although it stands well on its own, it would be a
    mistake to treat it as anything other than a vital component of the early
    minimalist and Dream Syndicate canons.  <i>Sun Blindness Music</i> is a portrait
    of an artist engaged in the maturing process, actively seeking out new sounds
    while simultaneously breaking down barriers of the old. It's not always
    successful, but taken in conjunction with his VU work during the same period,
    it's clear that Cale aggressively and enthusiastically pursued new sound
    territories.</p></div>"|1223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1223-sun-blindness-music/|8.5|Luke Buckman

It was a 24k
    gold disc, master version reissue of Lita Ford's <i>Lita</i>-- the kind of
    repackaging job that you usually see wrapped around a Pink Floyd or a Rolling
    Stones album.  The amount of attention that must have been spent on this disc,
    which was only notable in the world of rock music for the record-breaking amount
    of semen that the hit video ""Kiss Me Deadly"" coaxed from the loins of pubescent
    boys everywhere, is unforgivable.  Sure, taste in music is subjective.  But it's
    not <i>that</i> subjective.</p><p>
    
    Thank heaven that more worthwhile out-of-print discs are seeing the light of day
    despite wasteful efforts like the Lita project.  K Records, owners of Heavenly's
    later releases, realized that a crucial milestone in the band's catalog was
    out of print and decided to take action.  Augmenting the band's original 1990
    mini-LP debut with six additional tracks-- three early singles and their
    b-sides-- along with new cover art and liner notes to dress it up, K's reissue
    of <i>Heavenly vs. Satan</i> arrives over a decade later and not a moment too
    soon.  No more spending vacations in Japanese indie stores hunting through the
    ""H"" section for me.</p><p>
    
    Heavenly was twee almost since the beginning; certainly much earlier than any
    negative connotations accumulated on the word like ship barnacles.  A band born,
    reborn and then born again, they began as cult phenoms Talulah Gosh in 1986,
    enjoying critical adoration and the corresponding low record sales.  After
    transmutating to Heavenly in the early 90s, they enjoyed a lengthier and more
    critically lauded career before shapeshifting once again to Marine Research.
    But the main twee thread remained ever-present throughout all these costume
    changes.</p><p>
    
    If rock speaks to lust and pop love, then twee is about crush: superficial love
    with an undercurrent of tragedy.  Heavenly's lyrics emphasize and exemplify love,
    trust, hurt, awkwardness and insecurity-- the most basic and adolescent of love's
    entanglements.  And in a fashion, the listener quickly develops a crush of their
    own on the music of Heavenly, focusing on trivia such as the cute hiccup of
    singer Amelia Fletcher on the third verse of ""Our Love is Heavenly,"" or the
    tic-tac guitar shuffle Peter Momtchiloff provides in ""Boyfriend Stays the Same.""
    It's a superficial appeal, but that's the point.  Crush, remember?</p><p>
    
    Including the three singles and their b-sides here was a respectable move on K's
    part.  The a-sides ""I Fell in Love Last Night"" and ""Our Love is Heavenly"" are
    both damning evidence in the case of Sarah vs. Sub Pop for best seven-inches of
    the late 80s/early 90s.  Pop masterpieces, each of them, the latter boasts one
    of the catchiest choruses I've ever heard.  Fans of the Cardigans and the Sundays
    will instantly spot the obvious influence from this one track alone.</p><p>
    
    But the most stellar moment on the disc comes with ""Shallow.""  Starting with
    simple ringing guitar notes that presage the chord progression to come (in a
    fashion very reminiscent of the Cure's ""Boys Don't Cry""), a sublime jangle
    kicks in and drives the song along at a two-step pace.  Tragi-pitiful lyrics
    spell out the narrator's self-delusion: ""Singing your praises/ While you're with
    her/ Foolishly patient for your return/ Silent you left me/ And silence stays.""</p><p>
    
    One of the tolerance testers you may experience on this album is the sheer
    quantity of such treacly richness.  With each song so sugary sweet, listening
    to <i>Heavenly vs. Satan</i> can, at times, be like post-Halloween gorging on
    a Hefty bagful of fun-size booty.  And there are a few duds, such as ""Lemonhead
    Boy,"" which just sounds a little too frenetic, and the b-side closer ""Escort
    Crash on Marsten Street"" with its corny car crash plotline.  But even these are
    minor flaws that sound more like growing pains than botched pieces.</p><p>
    
    So much more than just a key historical listen, the music on this Heavenly
    reissue does more than merely justify K Records' effort; it makes it an
    imperative.  The progression from C-86 founding scenesters Talulah Gosh to
    Heavenly, and their maturation through tragedy into Marine Research, mirrors the
    evolution of carbon: from peat to coal to diamond.  And while diamond may be
    more polished and prettier to behold-- both fair assessments of Marine Research's
    latter-day updating of the Heavenly sound-- coal still burns more brightly.
    <i>Heavenly vs. Satan</i> is radiant.</p></div>"|3792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3792-heavenly-vs-satan/|8.5|John Dark

The very notion
    of the group-- a divorced couple playing pessimistic, oft-guitarless pop music--
    elicits furrowed eyebrows from the uninitiated. In the case of those who've heard
    the scathing rumors as to the nature of the breakup between Sam Coomes and Janet
    Weiss, those furrowed eyebrows are often accompanied by agape jaws.</p><p>
    Given the rather twisted nature of the band's history, it seems kind of
    disappointing that <i>Early Recordings</i>, 19 tracks culled from tapes recorded
    by Sam and Janet in 1995, is pretty much entirely what you'd expect it to be.
    That is, <i>Early Recordings</i> sounds like Quasi... but earlier.</p><p>
    One criticism that has been leveled against <i>Featuring ""Birds""</i>-era Quasi is
    that, while their songs were unquestionably catchy and clever, they were all
    catchy and clever in the exact same way. Sam Coomes belts out some seventh-chord
    progression on his Roxichord, Janet Weiss pops in with a sparse but rocking beat,
    and one or both of the divorcees begin musing about the sheer suckiness of life
    in a sweet melody. And while it's true that Quasi's most distinctive and
    memorable songs are largely similar, their albums have always included enough
    variety to keep things from getting terribly stale. Perhaps more importantly,
    even when Quasi do sink into cliché, they sink into their own clichés, rather
    than usual ubiquitous clichés of pop music.</p><p>
    As is usually the case with pre-debut album collections, <i>Early Recordings</i>
    is all over the place. Small hints of what would go on to become the band's
    trademark sound are here in spades, but are often lost in general messiness.
    Which is not to say that the record is bad. It's a largely exploratory recording--
    the sound of two people tinkering around with various instruments and trying to
    figure out what works. While the downside to such a recording is the previously
    addressed mess factor, the upside is that, every once in a while, you're privy
    to one of those moments when a band locks into something really, really good.</p><p>
<i>Early Recordings</i> opens with ""Two Hounds,"" a Coomes-penned instrumental
    that isn't all that different from the instrumentals that appear on later Quasi
    records. A simple piano figure, a straightforward drumbeat, and some guitar parts
    for flavor constitute one of the better tracks on <i>Early Recordings</i>. With
    cleaner production and more focused instrumental parts, ""Two Hounds"" would be at
    home on any Quasi record from <i>R&amp;B; Transmogrification</i> to <i>The Sword of
    God</i>, making it a decidedly appropriate opener for this compilation.</p><p>
    ""Time Flies By,"" an early Coomes/Weiss collaboration, sees the band further
    carving out their own distinctive sound. Quasi is one of the only bands that can
    pull off boy/girl harmonies without making me want to shoot myself in the face,
    and ""Time Flies By"" showcases the laid-back vocal interplay that sets Quasi
    apart from most cloying couple-rockers. ""Homonculus"" marks the first appearance
    of the moderately off-kilter chord progressions that would become a staple in
    later records, but disintegrates far too quickly into aimless fucking around.</p><p>
    Considering that these 19 songs were recorded before <i>R&amp;B; Transmogrification</i>
    and haven't been released until now, it's not surprising that they're not exactly
    fit for public consumption. While there are certainly a few excellent moments on
    <i>Early Recordings</i>, they only reveal themselves to people who are willing
    to wade through 19 severely spotty tracks. If you insist on having every decent
    recording Quasi has ever made in your possession, by all means go out and buy
    <i>Early Recordings</i>. If you're curious as to what the band sounded like
    pre-<i>R&amp;B; Transmogrification</i>, listen to any of their proper albums and
    imagine. It's pretty much the same thing.</p></div>"|6619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6619-early-recordings/|5.2|Matt LeMay

His remixes
    for the likes of Tortoise, Pizzicato 5 and Ryuichi Sakamoto were consistently
    intriguing-- his musical voice was unique and his process was radically different
    from what was used to generate the source material.  My favorite from this era
    remains his remix of Takako Minekawa's ""International Velvet,"" which wound up on
    her collection, <i>Ximer</i>. Throwing the high, chirpy voice of Minekawa into
    sharp relief, Popp buried the instrumentation under an avalanche of processing,
    saturating the tapes with data to such a degree that they seemed to transform
    into some sort of post-organic being. Popp's mixes then were so distinctive
    because they were atom-smashing collisions of opposing forces-- digital vs.
    analog, played vs. processed-- that wound up generating an original compound.</p><p>
    
    Last year, Kid606 made an entry into the ambient glitch world of Mille Plateaux
    with <i>P.S. I Love You</i>. With that album, the Kid proved to the world that
    he had processing and compositional skills to rank him amongst the heavy hitters
    of the genre. Either that, or he proved that glitch music was easy to make. In
    any case, it was a varied and rewarding collection, that showed him touching on
    dub (""Together""), reflective drone music (""Sometimes""), and click&amp;cut; techno
    (""Whereweleftoff"") with success.</p><p>
    
    So now we have the obligatory remix effort, <i>P.S. You Love Me</i>, which
    features five new Kid606 tracks and was compiled in part from two previously
    released EPs. It's a solid collection, but ultimately suffers a bit because the
    remixers come from a similar aesthetic background and don't seem to be
    challenging themselves or the original track. Compare <i>P.S. You Love Me</i> to
    Microstoria's <i>Reprovisors</i> and you can see the opportunity lost. The latter
    was wildly variable, with a fascinating vocal-meets-laptop contribution from
    Stereolab, a full-band take from Ui, some traditional instrumental fuckery from
    Jim O'Rourke, and Markus Popp's crowning achievement (his Microstoria megamix
    ""Runtime Engine""). <i>P.S. You Love Me</i>, while good, is simply glitch music
    remixed by glitch artists.</p><p>
    
    Failure to reach for the stars is not a crime, though, so it would be best to
    assess <i>P.S. You Love Me</i> on its own merits. Somewhat predictably, I'm
    going to have to say that my favorite cut is Jan Jelinek's ""Kubuki Rock Mix""
    of ""Sometimes,"" contributed under his Farben alias.  The German intellectual
    with an ear for the sublime didn't waste an opportunity to play with the most
    outwardly beautiful track on <i>P.S. I Love You</i>. The original drone is
    processed heavily, sometimes serving as a background tone as Jelinek fills the
    near field with his trademark clicks and pitch shifts, other times elbowing its
    way to the fore to display its shimmering warmth.</p><p>
    
    Matmos also contribute a winner-- a funky technofied take on ""Twirl"" that finds
    them incorporating the sounds of an interview they gave while simultaneously
    working on the remix. Despite how tossed-off that sounds, they do a nice job
    accelerating the rhythmic punch of the original's guitar samples and transforming
    the tune into something danceable.</p><p>
    
    Tracks by Atom, Twerk and Rechenzentrum are all nice minimal techno (Atom's
    verges on excellent), but not the sort of thing I return to often. The best of
    the rest are the five new tracks. ""Act Your Age"" is one of the more melodic
    tracks Kid606 has released in this vein, with patient deployment of a mysterious
    music box tune. ""Horseback"" dabbles in the drones of ""Sometimes"" with a more
    sinister edge, while ""P.S. I Dub Ya/Posterboys of the Apocalypse"" is a punishing
    house track that combines elements of several pieces. <i>P.S. You Love Me</i> is
    a worthwhile companion to the Kid's earlier record, but the tracks never quite
    click (so to speak) in that way that gets you staring at the disc player in
    wonder. The talent involved here is evident, but as an album, <i>P.S. You Love
    Me</i> lacks tension.</p></div>"|4408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4408-ps-you-love-me/|6.8|Mark Richard-San

Just when we
    thought designer water had pushed consumerism to the limits of its frivolity,
    someone discovered they could sell air by putting it in a fancy package.</p><p>
    I guess we should have seen it coming.  For years, the same faux-connoisseurs
    have been thronging to Starbucks, throwing their money away on factory-made
    café-culture aesthetics, attractive branding and ""gourmet"" coffee.  Marketing
    weasels can dress anything up in a clever wrapper and reap enormous profits from
    America's undiscriminating public.  Hardly anybody knows what good coffee tastes
    like, much less good water or air-- people pay for the illusion of sophistication,
    and seldom for the product itself.</p><p>
    The world of IDM is not immune to this phenomenon.  The recent proliferation of
    laptop jockeys has left a lot less room in the genre for innovation, and the
    result has been an interminable output of insipid, uninspired rot.  This is not
    to say that nothing good has come out of leftfield electronica in the last
    several years; just that it's been imitated ad nauseum, and some listeners don't
    know enough to draw the line between the originators and the pretense.</p><p>
    Takagi Masakatsu's <i>Pia</i>, an innocuous atmospheric excursion in the vein of
    Pete Namlook's FAX label, is the sonic equivalent of canned air.  There's really
    nothing of substance here, but the void is concealed by elegant production and
    the hallmark inaccessibility of electronic minimalism.  This may suffice to
    satisfy simpler audiences, and I wouldn't be surprised if elsewhere this album
    met with critical acclaim.  Minimalism is, after all, en vogue right now.  But I
    can't get past this record's vapid predictability.</p><p>
    This album operates on a conventional formula in ambient music, layering
    digitally processed light white noise over ethereal synth pads and played out
    samples.  Masakatsu runs through the entire catalog of stock new-age sounds--
    running water, a rooster crowing, chirping birds and talking children.  Don't
    forget the talking children.  Nothing suggests artistic enlightenment like
    talking children.</p><p>
    Occasionally, <i>Pia</i> reaches beyond mediocrity.  ""Bienna,"" with its strangely
    inverted refrain and intricate stereo manipulation, recalls latter-day Fennesz.
    It's a far cry from original, but at least challenges the listener at a more
    thoughtful level than the rest of the album.  ""Guiter"" introduces a stronger
    element of musical structure, spreading soft, coherent melodies over percussive
    jolts of static.</p><p>
    But the rest of the album scrolls by like a nebulous grey mass of experimental
    cliches.  Pianos, sounds from nature, self-indulgent moments of contemplation
    and profundity-- you name it, it's probably here.  And I hope I haven't forgotten
    to mention the talking children, who crop up on a total of three songs (""Eau,""
    ""Videocamera"" and ""Caroc"").</p><p>
    The package comes with an additional disc of ""enhanced media,"" which features
    five audio/video pieces created by Masakatsu.  The pieces are of a similar
    minimalist nature in many respects, and have apparently been presented in
    Japanese art galleries.  But while these pieces are pleasing enough aesthetically,
    I can't picture myself sliding it into my CD-ROM drive very often.</p><p>
<i>Pia</i>, in all of its inoffensive tedium, would certainly be at home on the
    speakers of an oxygen bar.  It works fine as wallpaper-- too understated to
    scare anyone off, too abstract to be readily transparent.  But any judicious
    listener who subjects this record to sincere scrutiny will find that it comes
    up lamentably shallow.</p></div>"|5127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5127-pia/|4.0|Malcolm Seymour III

    combining and rearranging until something new in born. But there's a fine line
    between that and cashing in on a trend and letting market research be your guide.
    Unless your name is Serge Gainsbourg (who jumped in headfirst wherever his muse
    happened to lead him, bending whole genres to his will and overpowering them
    with his personality), it's best to not force it, and let things happen naturally.</p><p>
    Given his first album was a collection of folky, singer-songwriterly musings and
    Sebadoh-inspired, bedroom-recorded alternative rockers, I was a little dubious at
    first of this second effort from Michigan-gone-New York composer/multi-instrumentalist
    Sufjan Stevens (who sometimes sits in with the Danielson Famile during their
    live shows). <i>Enjoy Your Rabbit</i> is a collection of electronic compositions,
    so my first impression was that it was the work of someone who just happened to
    have access to high-end software, some extra time on his hands, and a desire to
    see if he could stir up some TV commercial work-- all of which might be correct,
    but all questions of authenticity and motivations faded from memory about two
    minutes into the album. Such concerns are rendered trivial when confronted with
    such a fully realized piece of work.</p><p>
    An IDM song-cycle based on Chinese astrological symbols-- or as the liner notes
    put it, ""programmatic songs for the animals of the Chinese Zodiac""-- <i>Enjoy
    Your Rabbit</i> explores a wide palette of electronic textures using few
    external samples.</p><p>
    After a brief introductory track, we're hit with ""Year of the Monkey,"" which uses
    what sounds like a hyper-modified Atari battling a supped-up Colecovision in a
    chess match/battle royal.  Microchips fly everywhere as a thunderous, crashing
    piledriver of a beat smashes them both to bits. Like its namesake, it's playfully
    mischievous, with a hint of violence always lurking nearby.</p><p>
    ""Year of the Rat"" follows, starting like a classic Eno piece before squalling
    feedback undercuts the theme while the song turns into background music for the
    next <i>Toy Story</i> movie and returns to its introductory theme. ""Year of the
    Boar"" is frantic with its pin-sharp wind-chime notes scattering across an organic
    bongo beat, and ending in an ascending faux-guitar solo coda. With ""Year of the
    Tiger,"" a human voice pops up for the first time atop the sound of circuitry
    covering the earth like kudzu, ending in an aggressive death rattle. By contrast,
    ""Year of the Snake"" is almost hymnal with its organ drone, but for the recoiling
    flashes of short-circuitry and sing-songy bells near the end.</p><p>
    The standout track comes with ""Year of the Dragon."" At 9\xBD minutes, Stevens gives
    himself some room to stretch out. If the other songs have a fault, it's that they
    cram to much into such small containers. Here, Stevens allows a marching beat to
    hang around long enough for him to weave in a subtle, yet soaring soundscape.
    ""Enjoy Your Rabbit"" (replacing the expected title of ""Year of the Rabbit"") is
    the most conventionally song-oriented track, with a distorted guitar melody line
    leading much of the way, and even what could be called a recurrent riff.
    Elsewhere, the rubbery and fluid ""Year of the Dog"" sounds inspired by 70s Stevie
    Wonder and other bouncy funk; ""Year of the Horse"" rounds out the zodiac with a
    long piano-driven romp through futuristic gothic architecture; and the album
    final track, ""Year of Our Lord,"" closes the record with ambient meditation.</p><p>
    Taken in one lump dose, <i>Enjoy Your Rabbit</i> can be a bit intimidating as
    it's almost 80 minutes long, and at times it does sound like
    electronica-for-entry-level-listeners due to its sheer breadth of styles. But
    Sufjan Stevens proves himself adept of both long and short forms; downtempo and
    high BPM; glitches, scratches and ambient drones; blips, bleeps and bloops.
    I'm looking forward to seeing where he goes from here.</p></div>"|7511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7511-enjoy-your-rabbit/|7.7|Jason Nickey

    band has proven to make vast leaps in maturity with each album.  Somewhere between the release of their
    clumsy 1995 debut, <i>""!""</i>, and 1997's more balanced but no less raucous <i>Is Terrified!</i>, the band
    discovered the advantages of rock balladry and pensive lyrics.  With 1999's <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, they hit
    their stride, recording a landmark underground classic which rocketed them-- almost overnight-- into the
    stratosphere of indie rock's elite.  But when The Dismemberment Plan decided to title their new album
    <i>Change</i>, they weren't fucking around.</p><p>
    
    After the primal energy and speak/singalong teenage anthems of <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, <i>Change</i> comes
    as a bit of a jolt.  No longer intent on inciting dancefloor riots through funk-laden post-punk explosions,
    the new Dismemberment Plan is more reflective, more sentimental, and, perhaps shockingly, confidently
    collected.  Whereas their last album cruised through 12 tracks with a pummeling frenzy that sent audiences
    into fits of unrestrained revelry, the band rarely kicks into overdrive on <i>Change</i>, instead pondering
    their place in the world and the prosaic nature of day-to-day life.  That's right: they've settled down.</p><p>
    
    There are few things more detested in youth than the inevitable mellowing that comes with age, so should
    the band be derided for gracefully succumbing to adulthood or applauded for refusing to grow stagnant?
    Obviously, it depends on the final product.  And <i>Change</i>, while unquestionably more mature than
    anything The Dismemberment Plan have released in the past, is also, at times, an incredibly powerful
    record that can make mundane ruminations seem like Socratic philosophy.</p><p>
    
    Of all indie rock's leading voices, few have a way with words like Plan frontman Travis Morrison.  His
    hypnotic musings on everything from lonely New Year's celebrations in unfamiliar cities to nuclear
    decimation have always been an integral element of the band's sound and success.  On <i>Emergency &amp;
    I</i>, his lyrics blended with the electric onslaught to create visceral moments of uplift and sonic
    bliss.  On <i>Change</i>, however, they've become the primary focus of the songs, with the band trading
    in raging vigor for polite, polyrhythmic grooves.</p><p>
    
    The subjects of these songs lack some of the creativity of past works-- there are no memory machines to
    wash away the grief, no supernatural invitations from anyone to do anything-- but Morrison's uncanny
    ability to capture a moment in photographic detail has developed into poetic mastery.  On one of the
    album's highlights, the stripped-bare ""Automatic"", he moans, ""I could see you through the dirty waves/
    Smiling like a vampire as you disappeared beneath the whitecaps.../ I could feel my toes curl through
    the yellow sand/ As I watched you slip away."" On the bizarre ""Face of the Earth"", in which he contemplates
    the expression of a girlfriend just before she's unexpectedly and permanently sucked into the sky, he
    sings, ""I freeze the look of pre-alert and study it still/ Her smile starts to loosen/ Her pupils yawn
    wide.""  And then there's the highly quotable line from what is far and away the album's clear standout,
    ""Time Bomb"": ""I am a time bomb/ And I only live in that one moment in which you die.""</p><p>
    
    Though devoid of the urgency the band built their name on, <i>Change</i> is the most musically cohesive
    of The Dismemberment Plan's records to date.  The album kicks off with ""Sentimental Man"", which bridges
    the gap between the Talking Heads' <i>Remain in Light</i> and Joni Mitchell's <i>Court and Spark</i> with
    drummer Joe Easley and bassist Eric Axelson forming a busy, aquatic undercurrent for the quiescent,
    drugged guitar and droning keyboard.  The song flows seamlessly into ""Face of the Earth"", whose
    temperament is similarly mild-mannered until it opens up with blaring, Jawbox-esque guitar jangle.</p><p>
    
    ""Superpowers"" is the first of the album's truly great tracks, documenting events witnessed through
    extra-sensory perception (""I've been cornered by the screams of a body as it freed itself of its mind"").
    ""Pay for the Piano"" harkens back to The Dismemberment Plan of old with surging guitars and that trademark
    wired dynamism that pulsed through the band's best songs.  ""Come Home"" follows with what is-- next to the
    excellent ""Automatic""-- <i>Change</i>'s quietest track. Unfortunately, where ""Automatic"" contains some
    of the album's best lyrics, ""Come Home"" is too self-pitying, and its lack of any melodic hook gets tired
    long before it stretches past the five-minute mark.</p><p>
    
    The intensely rhythmic ""Secret Curse"" ushers in a welcome high point, though.  The song embodies the
    fragile tenseness of anxiety as Morrison spits out words at a rate even record-holding typists couldn't
    transcribe (""Anonymous hex on flavorless food and terrible sex a day of no rhythm a night of no rest"").
    The lyrical misgivings of ""Following Through"" (most notably, the spine-shivering ""it could have been off
    the hook, now"") are redeemed by chiming guitar, heartbeat percussion, and a beautifully harmonized chorus.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Change</i> closes on a less intriguing note with two songs: the jungle-flavored ""The Other Side""
    and the story of ""Ellen and Ben"".  Both songs pass with only minor complaints: the former, while one of
    the most musically creative songs in the band's catalog, suffers lyrically from a lack of any real point;
    the latter details the rise and fall of a romantic relationship through the eyes of a gossiping outsider.
    But even while these tracks are decent enough, they lack both the kinetic energy of the band's earlier
    material, and the engaging lyrical insight that dominates the rest of the record.</p><p>
    
    So, yes.  The Dismemberment Plan we once knew and loved has indeed changed, and like any change, it takes
    some getting used to.  Initially, the tribal percussion and sometimes maudlin tone may not sit well.  You
    might notice small imperfections, such as the mix, which seems slightly muddier this time out, or Morrison's
    emotive ""yeah's"" which can occasionally be a little abrasive.  But with repeated listens, its positive
    traits-- like Easley's unbelievably creative drumming, Axelson's volatile basslines, and the richly
    textured keyboards-- begin to pile up, eventually outweighing its negatives tenfold.</p><p>
    
    Sure, it's hard to shake that nagging feeling that it's too early in The Dismemberment Plan's career for
    this kind of shift, that they had so much more to explore in their endearingly spazzy rock vein.  But
    metamorphosis can be a beautiful thing, and like the butterfly retains a part of the caterpillar,
    <i>Change</i> retains a part of the pre-mutated Dismemberment Plan.  You see, they're still the same
    band they always were.  They're just prettier now.</p></div>"|2339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2339-change/|8.6|Ryan Schreiber

    would listen, with a violinist and a cellist added to the standard rock quartet
    of two guitarists, a bassist, and a drummer. Rather than only serving ornamental
    duties, the classical string counterparts of Halifax Pier play integral roles in
    the musical conversations of the music.</p><p>
    
    While Halifax Pier hasn't completely rid themselves of their despair, they seem
    to be more optimistic these days. Half of the six tracks on their sophomore
    full-length, <i>Put Your Gloves On and Wave</i>, are instrumentals, and the
    songs with lyrics seem to see a brighter light at the end of the tunnel in
    contrast to the downtrodden verses of love and loss that permeated their 1999
    self-titled debut.</p><p>
    
    ""Lightly Noise"" is the most lighthearted track, with a thumping bass-snare beat
    in two, finger-snapping, and a pretty finger-picked guitar line. The lyrics are
    self-referential as they tell of the pervasiveness of music with lines like, ""The
    rhythm in our steps and the thumping in our breasts."" The track closes with an
    all-together-now sing-along taken from a Chris Williamson song, ""Song of the
    Soul.""  It's fairly uplifting stuff.</p><p>
    
    ""Passing,"" while not so overtly joyful, is lovely.  Opening with the sound of a
    distant train, wind noise accompanies two winding acoustic guitar lines-- one for
    each ear. The march-tempo drums and the melodic bass stylings of Greg Burns are
    eventually accompanied by interlocking phrases of violin and cello. At one point,
    the violin even breaks into a frenetic string-crossing arpeggio straight from
    Vivaldi's <i>The Four Seasons</i>. Then comes the downright gorgeous last verse,
    in which frontman Charles Sommer's vocals are echoed by guest Colleen Doyle:
    ""Let my empty spirit rise tonight.""</p><p>
    
    ""That Old Grizzly Thing,"" the instrumental that opens the record, fades in with
    a meandering conversation between the cello and violin. The drum and light
    electric guitar enter to reveal a dark waltz. The euphonious harmonic ornaments
    of the acoustic guitar and rooted bassline actually sound more lovely than
    grizzly.</p><p>
    
    Then there's ""Sew Your Gloves On,"" which features sections in seven.  The
    track is slightly reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor in their more
    coherent moments, when they're not so damned consumed with the collapse of
    modern society. And finally, the album closes with ""Our Pape,"" a meandering
    track that feels closer to something from the Windham Hill collection than
    anything remotely indie rock.</p><p>
    
    So, yeah.  Halifax Pier makes pretty music.  While it's rarely emotionally
    consuming, and overall isn't anything notably new or groundbreaking, it does
    make for a calming listen.  What more do you want?  It's nice.</p></div>"|3718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3718-put-your-gloves-on-and-wave/|7.4|Christopher F. Schiel

No city embodies that tragicomic claim like Chicago.
    Thrill Jockey-- the silly coven of haughty and eminently geeky indie-rockers with
    unbearable jazz pretensions and its arsenal of post-every-fucking-thing-under-the-sun
    nomenclature-- has consistently been the most egregious of the Second City's many
    labels vying for real-life importance, your <i>serious</i> esteem, and of course,
    CD and show-ticket dollars. But while the über-musicianly Sir John McEntire and
    his Knights of Bucktown have been out wielding Powerbooks, Kinsella(s) Inc. has
    been steadily building an empire of pretension.</p><p>
    Sometimes tickling the critics into embarrassing coos of honeyed admiration, and
    other times inspiring equally disproportionate rock-crit fatwas, Tim Kinsella
    has succeeded where other Illini have failed: in disarming the full fury of his
    detractors with nothing more than a smirk.  I'm not talking, of course, about
    Kinsella's actual countenance; I'm referring to his neo-absurdist temperament
    and the obvious fun with which he goes about his business.</p><p>
    Even when he was just the scratchy-voiced, baby-faced ringmaster of Cap'n Jazz,
    Tim Kinsella was already establishing himself as a first- (well, maybe second)
    rate semantic clown and word-gamesman.  With a penchant for double-entendre and
    imagistic jokes, Kinsella charmed his partisans and alienated the rest of us
    with his Duchampesque disregard for everything, and created a contested little
    body of work which still polarizes fans of the genre.  Personally, Joan of Arc
    drives me up the fucking wall, but my dismissal of the band has nothing to do
    with the personality phenomenon of Kinsella; they sorely lacked dynamism, and
    there were too few hooks and too much blipped-over space for my liking.</p><p>
    Owls reunites the boys from Cap'n Jazz for another stab at the rock. Abthent
    thith time ith the Promith Ring'th Davey Von Bohlen, but the remaining cast (Tim
    Kinsella, brother Mike on drums, guitarist Victor Villareal, and bassist Sam
    Zurick) are back in strong form.</p><p>
    So, too, is Tim Kinsella's jokiness, though that's not such a bad thing. Even
    the typical, hideously Kinsellated title of ""What Whorse You Wrote Id On"" doesn't
    detract from the opening track's elegant mood and almost sing-songy warmth. The
    guitarwork is nothing short of gorgeous, with Villareal arpeggiating a trebly,
    spidery path into your aural memory, his picking providing a textural counterpoint
    to Mike Kinsella's ornate drumming, which it should be said has never sounded
    this good.</p><p>
    ""Anyone Can Have a Good Time"" starts quietly and jangly over a semi-marshal beat
    in non-standard time. Things seem to be meandering, only to find anchorage in
    what passes for a refrain. The tonally challenged Kinsella spits tick-tocky
    syllables over one more verse, and after a pleasant mood shift and instrumental
    interlude, the song's end-section begins.  ""We fall into patterns quickly/ We
    fall into patterns too quickly,"" sings a background Tim Kinsella, as a forefront
    one screams, ""Unname everybody/ Unname everyone,"" in emo bursts of surprisingly
    well-hit notes as the song peters out.</p><p>
    ""Life in the Hair Salon Themed Bar on the Island"" (an apparent reference to
    Beauty Bar on 14th St. in New York City), is the proggiest of the album's tracks.
    That is to say, it sounds like indie rock interpreting Frank Zappa influences
    from something they read in a book.  The standout comes with the subsequent song,
    ""I Want the Blidingly Cute to Confide in Me."" It encapsulates many of the album's
    disparate, yet weirdly integrated, strains: its faux-jazzy rhythm excursions,
    its Andy Summers-on-crack guitar playing, the intermittently truly beautiful
    vocal melodies, and of course, Kinsella's lyrical shots in the dark.</p><p>
    Owls' music is an odd concoction of opposing and random musical and emotional
    trajectories. You can hear echoes of Cap'n Jazz and, every bit as clearly, some
    really weird ""adult contemporary"" musical phrases, too. The mélange works very
    well enough, though, and hits the mute button on the death knell so many would
    like sound on Kinsella's oddly resilient and shapeshifting career.  Goddamnit.</p></div>"|6073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6073-owls/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    in the early 90s with Robert Pollard's home recordings.  Pollard created a
    Picasso-like sense of unfinished masterpieces through what seemed to be drunken
    toss-offs. The clear affection GBV held for the Beatles, coupled with a melodic
    sense all their own, created a sound with all the deconstructive energy of punk,
    yet the melodicism of 60s pop.</p><p>
<i>Flaming Lips:</i> Eccentric neo-psychedelic guitar band, with a singer who sounds
    like Neil Young gargling glue. Their sound evolved into bombastic prog-rock of
    epic proportions on their heralded 1999 album <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>.</p><p>
    
    I know that, unlike the obsessive staff of <i>Pitchfork</i>, you, the reader,
    might not have heard these rather seminal indie bands. But I understand. There's
    a hell of a lot of music out there being called ""essential."" There are a slew of
    great books you need to read as well. Sadly, it's costly and time consuming, and
    you suspect they might not be as enjoyable as the experts make them out to be.
    These are valid concerns. That's one reason why I've bored the experts with my
    descriptions of these two bands, which, when combined and diluted of some twee,
    approach the sound of Centro Matic.</p><p>
    
    The other reason is that I don't have much else to say about this Texas band.
    They sound like Lips singer Wayne Coyne fronting a tighter version of GBV.
    There's nothing much else that grabs me. But I'll go on. Watch:</p><p>
    
    The songs on <i>Distance and Clime</i>, Centro-Matic's sixth full-length album,
    seem to be quality when I hear them, but I can never sing them back.  The rhythm
    section is wonderfully invisible, propelling the songs like the Fantastic Four's
    Susan Storm.  Will Johnson's guitar buzzes like a thousand bees, but as singer,
    he often lingers in misshapen triplets over his three syllable words, as if he's
    a little too in love with the smartness of his cryptic verses. It's a little hard
    to understand what the words ""in his pantlegs are hidden the blueprints to the
    stripmalls and the bloodbanks"" (from ""Janitorial on Channel Fail"")  might mean,
    but Johnson caresses them like an ancient incantation.</p><p>
    
    At least he doesn't sneer them all tongue-in-cheek, or try to be British like
    Robert Pollard. I can't stress how important it is that this band isn't twee, a
    worthy accomplishment given their influences.  Instead of mimicking pre-schoolin'
    little boys, Johnson's opts for grittier vocals; instead of sing-songy, joyous
    melodies, they infuse the sound with a ballsy rock roar.  After a while, you
    start to sense some Archers of Loaf pervading the mix.</p><p>
<i>Archers of Loaf:</i>  90s Chapel Hill band distinguished by angular inventive
    guitar sounds and a mournful, gravel-voiced singer, Eric Bachmann.  Bachmann is
    now reported to be singing ballads about booze-ridden losers with his new project,
    Crooked Fingers.  He's like Neil Diamond, but hip.</p><p>
    
    I don't want to disrespect this band too much.  Perhaps the songs will finally
    catch up to me on a later listen. Of course, that would be much later, since,
    after ten times through, I'm at a loss.  Still, if you like the combination
    described above, don't just rush out and buy it.  Look at that cover art first.</p></div>"|1378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1378-distance-and-clime/|6.9|Dan Kilian

    guys might get tossed in the post-rock pile, but what they make is unabashed
    space-rock, although not in the abstract jam-band sense.  They soak their
    instrumentals in dense synthesizer tones.  They feed their guitars through a
    thicket of effects pedals.  And if the smooth results don't sound much like the
    future, well, it's because the celestial paths were first explored in the 1970s.</p><p>
<i>A Difficult Future</i> begins with electronic piano chords hinting at
    soulfulness, like the opening of Belle and Sebastian's ""Don't Leave the Light
    On, Baby.""  But then, in washes the monolithic Moog.  The prog-dwellers and
    krautrockers of the 70s shared a simple secret: analog synth, with that slight
    delay in the decay of its notes, sure sounds great when you're under the
    influence.  And so the Timeout Drawer continue in that vein, each song buzzing
    and burping in harmonies that would cue reminiscent tears (or flashbacks!) for
    old Hawkwind fans.  You can hear traces of descendants of the sound, too,
    especially when bass, guitar and keyboards converge in epic choruses, conjuring
    up the overwrought sincerity of <i>Signals</i>-era Rush.  For contemporaries,
    think Air's <i>Virgin Suicides</i> score, the best Pink Floyd album never made.</p><p>
    
    The technical proficiency of the musicians is near flawless.  For nearly an hour,
    they weave layers of drones, distortion and the clarion call of their synths into
    a seamless mix.  But for all the rocking numbers, there are also moments when
    the sentimentality of a melody becomes cloying.  They don't quite breach Vangelis
    territory, but ""His Sailing Days Are Over But He Can't Forget the Sea,"" for
    instance, wouldn't sound out of place in a planetarium's laser light show.  And
    ""Finding a Place in the Sun"" could be the soundtrack to <i>Star Hustler</i>!  I
    can just hear that guy's voice now: ""When the moon reaches its apex, we're going
    to lie in the penumbra, eat some of these fabulous magic mushrooms I found, and
    listen to the Timeout Drawer.  You should really come along!""</p><p>
    
    The Timeout Drawer used to have a singer.  I can't imagine that hearing his
    vocals would have dramatically altered my perspective on the band.  But lyrics
    might have added a human dimension to a group whose sound otherwise emits a
    sterile neutrality, as if radiated from the Nebula of the Ever-Present,
    All-Encompassing Soup of the Universe.  In the end, you wonder what (if anything)
    these songs mean, or how you're supposed to feel about the whole affair.  At its
    worst, <i>A Difficult Future</i> exhibits all the post-rock-extra-lite tendencies
    of schlock like Tristeza and the Album Leaf.  But at their best, these fellows
    make extremely competent, mercurial compositions that don't flinch away from
    their retro stylings.  Here's to a future that never happened.</p></div>"|8061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8061-a-difficult-future/|7.0|Christopher Dare

    enough of an ""angle"" for DIY self-promotion, this San Francisco band has tacked
    on a whole maritime mythos to go along with the music.  Nevermind that the
    lyrical content has little to do with the briny deep or the nautical residents
    thereof.  That didn't stop the Jims from decorating their release with images of
    deep sea diving suits, or writing a backstory about mutinous sea creatures
    invading the <i>terra firma</i>, to spread their musical message of pop-rock
    purism and equal rights for zoo plankton everywhere.  Weirdos.</p><p>
    
    The key Jim here is veteran Bay-area songwriter Jim Greer who displays a mastery
    over the pop song form shared by the likes of Andy Partridge, Eric Burdon and
    Tom Petty.  With three albums of his own behind him, as well as stints in Dr.
    Octagon and Tipsy, it's easy to get the feeling that Visitor Jim could be just
    a project band for him, with the other members merely along for the joyride.
    Especially since the fuel that tends to drive these songs is Greer's
    well-established m.o.: catchy, hooky melodies with one foot in left-field.
    It hardly matters, though.  Whether just a project, or Greer's main vehicle for
    future expression, Visitor Jim provides the medium for smart, electrified pop.</p><p>
    
    ""Place of My Own"" is the third song on the disc and the first true sign that a
    detail-oriented approach to pop songwriting can generate some pleasing results.
    Acoustic guitar, 60s organ, gentle harmonies and atmospheric drumming (first
    time I've ever used <i>that</i> phrase) gel into a perfect mid-tempo three
    minutes and thirty-nine seconds.   Two songs later enters ""Kill that Jungle""
    with its bouncy, off-kilter melody and crunching, anthemic guitars.  A quirky,
    memorable chorus and bridge, courtesy of the urchins of Fresno's Roosevelt
    Elementary School is the centerpiece of the song.   Written for radio play in a
    just world, the song could have propelled Visitor Jim to the big time had it
    been released in 1994.</p><p>
    
    ""Henry &amp; Holly"" has enough of a minor key jangle and a wistful whine to satisfy
    fans of early REM.  A gentle, easygoing song with a throwback, Beatlesque chorus
    and early George Harrison-style ringing strums for flourish, it's one of the
    highlights of the disc in a quiet, unassuming way.  The instrumental closer, ""The
    Ballad of Belle and Ruckus,"" starts out with some cluttered soft noise before
    slipping into a sleazy, glam-tinged groove.  A simple organ phrase falls into
    place, adding depth.  The song crescendos with the ancient trick of letting
    everything but the guitar lines suddenly drop out, and then recedes in a short
    denouement.  All very nice, and with nothing so disturbingly odd as to be
    off-putting.</p><p>
    
    However, flaws do appear from time to time.  One of the unwelcome vibes
    persistent throughout <i>Visitor Jim</i> is the overt hinting at the Caucasian
    groove of the Spin Doctors.  It's really only an undercurrent and can safely be
    ignored by exerting a little conscious effort to do so.  This common ground
    is exemplified on the song ""Success of a Cynic"" which leaves the listener feeling
    that the band owes as much of a debt to those king-goofballs of bad rock as they
    do to the bands that they'd like to regard as their influences and peers.  And
    while none of the songs (even the best ones) are particularly challenging in any
    way, that doesn't have to be a strike against.  I'm not necessarily always up
    for a challenge.</p><p>
    
    When all is said and done, <i>Visitor Jim</i> might work best as a jadedness
    litmus.  If you can still find a little bit of <i>Forrest Gump</i>-style wonder
    in familiar rock structures and manipulative pop hooks, then <i>Visitor Jim</i>
    may get some well-deserved rotations on your stereo; if you're so far gone as to
    ignore any disc that doesn't see its first release as an Icelandic import, you'll
    probably be left as cold as a frigid post-rock soundscape.</p></div>"|8478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8478-visitor-jim/|7.0|John Dark

It's
    obviously not sufficient that Begg has also been known as Buckfuck 3000,
    Cabbageboy, and Bigfoot; he now prefers S.I. Futures. Under this guise, Begg's
    techno and electro-funk poke fun at conventioneering and shareholder meetings.
    Quite why he's chosen such targets for his satire is not clear to me. Does he
    object to the great and the good of Proctor and Gamble coming together to
    discuss investment strategy and revenue streams? And why does Begg consider
    dance music a viable saber with which to lay into these things? In the absence
    of even the vaguest of answers, I'll state that the tracks here are sufficiently
    well put together to stand apart from such distractions.  After all, Begg's
    proven strengths have always been his appreciation and execution of dancefloor
    mechanics, not his ability to deliver a withering critique of corporate
    hospitality.</p><p>
    
    So away from concerns about Begg's secondary motivation, how does the music
    really fare? Well, if you haven't been absorbing the Plump DJs' frenzied cuts,
    the filthy electrofunk on the pioneering UK Botchit and Scarper label, or Rennie
    Pilgrim's equally innovative TCR Records, you'll be mildly impressed.</p><p>
<i>The Mission Statement</i> pushed Novamute one step further away from pure
    Berlin/Detroit techno, and closer to the applied mechanics of breakbeat-enhanced
    funk. This new direction began with Luke Slater's <i>Wireless</i> and continued
    in a more abstract fashion with Cristian Vogel's <i>Rescate 137</i>. Unfortunately
    for Begg, Slater and Vogel arrived first on this block and they brought something
    fresh. Begg, in turn, now presents us with what many others have become
    accustomed to.  The guy also hasn't done himself any favors by releasing <i>The
    Mission Statement</i> so soon after the Leaf Label put out his <i>Complete Death
    of Cool</i> compilation, on which Begg focused on similarly fractured, jokey
    beats.  As a result, <i>The Mission Statement</i> sounds as though Begg has
    retrieved leftovers from those sessions and presented them to Novamute as fresh
    sounds.</p><p>
    
    After a daft spoken word intro about this disc being ""another quality S.I.
    Futures project,"" Begg slaps down the M/A/R/R/S-emulating ""This is the Way.""
    This opener gives me no way out from unfavorably contrasting it with ""New and
    Different Experiment,"" one of his nostalgic tweakings of the Beat Street sound
    on <i>The Complete Death of Cool</i>.  Before long, its cuts, scratches, and
    synth cowbells get dropped for ""I Like That (Brand New)"" which features
    scene-stalwart, T-Power (aka Marc Royal).</p><p>
    
    Royal has been on the UK jungle/breakbeat since the beginning. His first release
    in 1991, under the Bass Selective alias, foreshadowed the raw techno that evolved
    into jungle. As T-Power, his debut album, <i>The Self-Evident Truth of an
    Intuitive Mind</i>, blended the raga ruffness of Shy FX and UK Apache's
    ""Original Nuttah"" with avant jazz and a vast appreciation for experimental
    music. After parting ways with jungle music and the S.O.U.R label, Royal goofed
    around as Chocolate Weasel on Ninja Tune's dime. Since then, Royal has become
    the dependable axis around which the immensely successful Botchit and Scarper
    turns. Royal's manky beats and unmatched understanding of electro-dynamics have
    made him a highly sought after remixer and collaborator. Working with Begg on
    ""I Like That,"" however, brings little distinction to either party. The track
    hinges on crackle-caked snares and dapples of nervy atmospherics. The ""I Like
    That"" sample that is supposed to bind the track which obviously hasn't got the
    strength to hold this disjointed series of soundfiles together. The atmospheric
    elements too often break up the rhythm, rendering the track either a brief
    drop-in for DJs or an irritating spliff symphony.</p><p>
    
    Begg enlists the hip-hop collective Aspects for ""All Terrain Aspects."" The
    trippy flute lines and sparse beats could have made the track a fave for
    bowl-packers. But the concrete-bound, stilted Aspects crew solidify the track's
    innate fluidity.  Begg, in turn, resorts to vocoding them, showing how desperate
    he is to give the track some vitality. Plus, UK hip-hop has far better crews than
    Aspects.  Roots Manuva could have made this cut a crucial joint.</p><p>
    
    In a reference to the trains that pass through the Channel Tunnel, ""Eurostar""
    connects <i>The Mission Statement</i> with 1998's <i>Commuter World</i>, Begg's
    travelogue-ish documentation of commuter habits and suburban attitudes. However,
    ""Eurostar"" relies too heavily on Belgium's poorly imaged facsimile of Kraftwerk,
    Telex, to compete with the virtuoso command of form and function that hallmarked
    <i>Commuter World</i>. The closing track and single, ""We are Not a Rock Band,"" is
    similarly hampered by Begg's appropriation of Telex's dopey moves.</p><p>
    
    For every unqualified success (e.g. the growling, theremin-led fear of ""Assault
    on Precinct 14"" or the mutant sub-bass jungle of ""Ionic Funk"") Begg lets us down
    with derivative idiocies such as ""The News"" or ""Freestyle Disco,"" a
    steroid-scarfing remake of ""Gym and Tonic,"" Bob Sinclair's filter disco sampling
    of Jane Fonda's workout tapes.</p><p>
    
    I find it useful to compare <i>The Mission Statement</i> with <i>Commuter World</i>.
    Both are concept-driven albums. The difference between them is unmistakable,
    though. <i>Commuter World</i> was insatiable in its appropriation of styles;
    Begg never fumbled as he traveled from blunted beats and collages of passengers'
    conversations to Orb-inspired ambient house/jungle through to hard, unforgiving
    techno. For <i>The Mission Statement</i>, Begg applies similar rigor only to the
    album's artwork.</p><p>
    
    Had Begg spent an equal amount of time on the music as he did on the presentation
    of his conceit, <i>The Mission Statement</i> would have had a defining and
    winning purpose. But like 99% of company mission statements, Begg's is a
    collection of threadbare cliches, knackered phrases and cursory will-this-do's.</p></div>"|7135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7135-the-mission-statement/|5.4|Paul Cooper

    sweaty confines of the Middle East Downstairs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
    checking out a triple bill of excellent bands: local roof-raisers Cracktorch,
    jazz-rockers Karate, and the indomitable Dismemberment Plan.  About halfway
    through their set, the Plan stopped for a brief break between songs and Travis
    Morrison, ever the insightful one, took a moment to acknowledge the fact that
    the intersection outside the club had been christened Mark Sandman Square,
    after the late Morphine frontman.</p><p>
    
    Applause erupted in honor of our local hero, a man who did a great deal of work
    to help strengthen Boston's now-vibrant music scene in the mid-90s.  Morrison
    went on to muse that perhaps there would one day be an Ian MacKaye Circle in
    Washington D.C., countering some initial laughter with the assertion that
    nations like the Netherlands and Belgium are doing a better job of celebrating
    our rich musical legacy than we are, erecting statues in honor of Charlie Parker
    and John Coltrane in their squares.</p><p>
    
    Those comments have stuck with me, and I've come to think that it's a really
    good idea-- MacKaye and Fugazi have been a major cultural force in the last
    decade.  They're worthy of public accolades.  Over the course of seven albums
    (counting <i>Instrument</i> and <i>13 Songs</i>), they've plied a brand of
    brutal, often Spartan post-punk that's never catered to fashion, while at the
    same time garnering a large, devoted fanbase that sends their albums into the
    <i>Billboard</i> Top 200 without the benefit of major label backing or radio
    airplay.</p><p>
    
    Of course, one primary obstacle to a public memorial for the members of Fugazi
    is the band's collective politics which, while moralistic and anti-corporate,
    are hardly anti-capitalist as many have claimed.  In fact, the band has fairly
    been living the American dream, becoming successful on their own terms without
    losing the rights to their music or creative direction.  They've also taken an
    active role in positioning their label, Dischord, at the fore of the indie pack;
    over the years, the label has become the most reliable source of hard-hitting
    post-punk around.</p><p>
<i>The Argument</i>, Fugazi's first proper album since 1998's somewhat disjointed
    <i>End Hits</i>, is yet another leap forward for a band that has constantly
    pushed itself in new directions.  For one thing, no Fugazi album has ever been
    this melodic.  For the first time ever, you can hum at least part of the melody
    to every song on the record.  As catchy as they sometimes were, you have to admit
    that whistling ""Bed for the Scraping"" or ""Sieve-Fisted Find"" was never really
    a prospect.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with an untitled bit of collage that marries static and police
    radio transmissions to Amy Domingues' brooding cello drones, immediately setting
    <i>The Argument</i> apart from the band's past work, before ""Cashout"" makes the
    thoroughness of the transition even more apparent.  Domingues' cello carries
    counter-melodies to MacKaye's double-tracked singing throughout the song, which
    itself is a sort of post-hardcore update of the Kinks' ""Muswell Hillbilly.""
    MacKaye details a series of evictions as the city takes an apartment complex by
    eminent domain to make room for a development.  After spending so many years
    screaming their sentiments in your ear, it's nice to see that Fugazi have come
    to a point where they don't necessarily feel the need to raise their voices to
    put their point across.</p><p>
    
    Joe Lally and Brendan Canty throw down a furious groove on ""Full Disclosure"" to
    support Guy Picciotto's demented wailing (""I want a mutually assured destructive
    life"") amid screaming guitar interplay.  It's excellent, but it's nothing we
    haven't heard Fugazi do before, until the second verse, where Lally, Picciotto,
    and MacKaye enter in three-part harmony.  The juxtaposition between shockingly
    smooth vocals (for Fugazi, anyway), and the jagged rhythmic interplay is
    extremely effective.</p><p>
    
    The energy level stays high on ""Epic Problem,"" as MacKaye delivers his lines
    telegram-style, complete with shouts of ""Stop!"" between lines, which the band
    dutifully obeys. ""And inside I know I'm broken/ But I'm working as far as you
    can see,"" he sings in the guitar and voice breakdown near the song's end, a
    section that serves to highlight the fact that this is Fugazi's most produced
    effort yet.</p><p>
    
    ""Life and Limb,"" ""The Kill,"" and ""Strangelight"" form the album's tense, even
    spooky backbone, with a focus on melody and intertwining guitar parts, as well
    as full production that recalls the sound of some of <i>Red Medicine</i>'s more
    ambitious moments.  Picciotto's creepy rallying cry of, ""Viva viva viva life
    and limb"" on ""Life and Limb"" is possibly his subtlest vocal ever, and the guitars
    buzz like a bees' nest that you know is somewhere nearby, but can't quite locate.
    There's a nervous tension in the song that energizes like the band's raging bulls
    from their early days.</p><p>
    
    The cello in the coda of ""Strangelight"" reminds me, of all things, of the
    Renaissance prog of the Electric Light Orchestra's ultra-bizarre first album,
    <i>No Answer</i>, though the similarity ends with the cello.  The coda also
    incorporates some dark piano phrases, making for one of Fugazi's most interesting
    timbrel moments yet.  This leads into ""Oh,"" a slow anti-globalization anthem
    that stands out as the only song on the album that doesn't really satisfy.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, ""Ex-Spectator,"" one of several songs that benefits from the
    contributions of second drummer Jerry Busher, quickly redeems things with
    charging rhythms and more haywire guitar interplay.  MacKaye shouts the lines,
    ""Looking out for cars and mortality/ Trying to find some sort of geometry/
    Avoiding mistakes/ Keep an eye on every step I take,"" with the same unbridled
    aggression he used to make such good use of back when Fugazi were still making
    a name for themselves.</p><p>
    
    The galloping punk undertow of ""Nightstop"" supports what may be the best song
    here, and the band even makes room for a restlessly strummed acoustic guitar
    in the mix.  There also appears to be some heavily EQ'd guitar tapping after
    the second verse.  It displays technical prowess without descending into the
    depths of wankery that so many equally skilled musicians might find themselves
    in.  ""The Argument"" actually sets itself up to be a disappointing closer, with
    some somewhat questionable stop/start rhythms and a wandering melody, but it
    picks up after a curious ambient interlude, blasting to a close with a furious
    swirl of ragged guitar, cymbals, and rumbling bass.</p><p>
    
    Fugazi have made a career out of crafting excellent albums, and with <i>The
    Argument</i>, they've made one of their best.  At this point, I don't see it
    edging out <i>Red Medicine</i> or <i>13 Songs</i> from the top of my Fugazi album
    hierarchy, but it's certainly a worthy entry into their catalog, and proves that
    they're still one of the most important bands in the world.  The dedication of
    Ian MacKaye Circle may still be a pipe dream, but that doesn't mean that he and
    the other members of Fugazi don't deserve the honor.</p></div>"|3242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3242-the-argument/|8.5|Joe Tangari

In the 70s, there was Led Zeppelin's
    offering of a whole lotta love, a stairway to heaven, and a facile Kashmir
    eclecticism. In the 80s, there was cock rock, hair bands and countless groupies.
    One must hand it to University of Chicago's Allan Bloom, who in 1987 put forth
    an accurate, yet jaded, generalization on the role of popular music: ""A pubescent
    child whose body throbs with orgasmic rhythms; whose feelings are made articulate
    in hymns to the joys of onanism or the killing of parents whose ambition is to
    win fame and wealth in imitating the drag-queen who makes the music. In short,
    life is made into a nonstop, commercially prepackaged masturbational fantasy.""</p><p>
    
    While his statement is gargantuan in presumption, it could be said that the
    mainstream music of the time often bequeathed an overbalanced self-assuredness
    in the listener. But as my fourth grade teacher aptly stated: change is
    inevitable. When Kurt Cobain was thrown the reigns in 1991, the new hero wasn't
    sexual, clean, or a monster of rock. This demigod had feelings ranging from
    angst to alienation (okay, not that great a divide, admittedly) and rarely came
    across as completely sure of himself. And with the death of Cobain came the
    eulogy of genuine rock bombast.</p><p>
    
    Above ground lie a vast assortment of commercial-quality pop and trite modern
    rock radio, all sans ingenuity or sincere emotion. Underground, there are the
    emo kids, the shoegazers, the art dilettantes, anti-everything punks, and dozens
    of elitist music cliques. Where is one to belong?  Perhaps the question is not
    where to belong but whether to belong at all.</p><p>
    
    Thus we have the nature of no depression, and its many bands who are routinely
    pigeonholed as country.  And on initial exposure, such a classification is
    justified. But at the end of the day, no depression is not your uncle's John
    Michael Montgomery.  Consider the description of San Francisco's the Court and
    Spark as found in the biography on their website: ""The Court &amp; Spark is a
    slow-fade, a slow-klang, a climb to the top of Portola Road to watch San
    Francisco on the longest day of the year."" I may have never been to San
    Francisco, but this statement can not be denied.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the Court &amp; Spark's sophomore collection, <i>Bless You</i>, introduces
    itself in a slow-klang. A simple bass snare pattern in two slowly ambles its way
    to the listener, accompanied by unorthodox percussion and a sound resembling
    the plucking and strumming of piano strings before the full band enters. The
    track, ""To See the Fires,"" presents a comprehensive view of the Court &amp; Spark's
    terrain: slide guitar (only sometimes lap-steel), the addition of Wendy Allen to
    sing harmony full-time, organ, piano, and southern tinged vocals.  But don't be
    fooled.  You are not listening to country.</p><p>
<i>Bless You</i>'s musical affect is akin to the feeling evoked by the ruddy
    sunset depicted on the back cover of the record: approaching peace and grasping
    utter beauty. The eight gorgeous minutes of the penultimate ""Fade Out to Little
    Arrow"" are augmented by very light horns that ring more like distant church bells
    on a Sunday evening. The upbeat tambourine shuffle of ""Rooster Mountain""
    complements the most infectious yet bittersweet track.  Such a feat is achieved
    by a very slamming snare sound, resembling a large crowd of impeccably
    synchronized handclaps, and droning horn leading the bridge back to the verse.
    What makes <i>Bless You</i> so intriguing is the effectiveness of such subtle
    ornaments.</p><p>
    
    Wendy Allen proves yet again, with her backing vocals on ""National Lights,"" that
    sometimes the most subtle of performances can be the best.  Here, she echoes the
    vocals of frontman M.C. Taylor and occasionally adds a light falsetto. The song
    is seemingly standard fare on the surface, but the Court &amp; Spark have almost
    mastered their art. The burbling organs of ""A.M. Radio"" lie underneath the entire
    track, while it climbs between male and female vocals to cymbal crashes and a
    driving guitar line. ""I have seen the driving rain,"" reflect Allen and Scott
    Hirsch.  But they don't need to tell us; we can hear it ourselves.</p><p>
    
    The Court &amp; Spark don't consider themselves country, so neither should we.
    Perhaps no depression is the best description: the melodies and performances are
    mostly plaintive while never being altogether downcast.  Their last album, 2000's
    tUMULt-released <i>Ventura Whites</i>, documented a band gathering their bearings;
    <i>Bless You</i> presents a band that's almost settled into their identity. They
    have their tools and have realized the power of subtlety, something the gods of
    rock from yestercentury tended to completely disregard.</p></div>"|1635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1635-bless-you/|8.4|Christopher F. Schiel

    Lubbock, Texas.  I wouldn't be if I hadn't spent my college years there.  To
    be honest, I'm not sure there are many people who were meant to spend a lot of
    time there, beyond those born and bred in the ""hub city.""  The locals, generally
    conservative (politically, and often otherwise), are polite, mostly soft-spoken
    and hard working.  But life in Lubbock is different than the big city carnival
    I was accustomed to before heading out west.  The rodeo is big, the cinema is
    packed every weekend and on holidays, and the minor league baseball team is
    always a draw.</p><p>
    
    Lubbockians also like their music, but don't expect a big club scene.  There's
    something of a good Tejano music circuit, and bar bands grow there almost as
    plentifully as the cotton.  Downtown, in the depot district on Buddy Holly
    Avenue (Avenue H, for anyone who lived there before 1996, when the name was
    changed), the Cactus Theater is something of an institution.  From the outside,
    it has all the charm you'd expect from a 50-year old converted movie house, with
    the old-fashioned marquee and box office straight out of <i>Pleasantville</i>.
    Inside, the theater walls are covered with murals of the West Texas plains,
    while the red curtain onstage still reeks of smoke from all the years Don
    Caldwell and the Texas Rhythm Section were blowing fire up there.  Actually,
    they still are.</p><p>
    
    Old Don leads his band through rock and roll rebirth, putting on shows every
    weekend at the Cactus.  Tunes like ""Respect,"" ""Great Balls of Fire,"" ""Tequila,""
    ""Black is Black,"" and ""I Want You (I Feel Good)"" get the shit blown out of them
    on a weekly basis, and the crowd, white-haired as they are quickly becoming,
    act like it's the end-all of existence.  They literally dance in the aisles,
    yelping and hollering like kids with no sense of either responsibility or the
    last 25 years.  Maybe it's a nostalgia thing, or maybe Don and his merry old
    band really are onto something: just rocking the house like it used to be done
    can still turn normal folks into rock animals.</p><p>
    
    Which brings me to the problem that some newer bands like Nashville's Los
    Straightjackets will encounter with the unconverted: chiefly that there
    simply isn't any irony or emotional obligation in their music.  The rock they
    (and others, like the Reverend Horton Heat, or even Man or Astro-Man) play isn't
    the kind that emphasizes its ties to the Velvets or New York Dolls.  And while
    those bands certainly did know a thing or two about rock, their music was
    entirely their own.  At some point along the line, rock stopped being the music
    people danced and fucked to, and became a kind of therapy or surrogate family
    for all the young dudes.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I would be
    remiss if I didn't mention that those ""golden oldies"" probably served a similar
    purpose for the first kids to hear them.  But times have changed, and when you
    throw out the same, relatively straightforward statements 40 years after the
    fact, the new kids may not have the same reactions.</p><p>
    
    Of course, none of this is criticism of the music.  Whatever image qualifiers
    Los Straightjackets don't have in common with their second cousins in the indie
    world they account for in sheer love for their music.  The band has mostly been
    known for its attempts at bringing back the surf rock instrumental, a noble goal
    to be sure, but at odds with a core audience who stopped praising <i>Pulp Fiction</i>
    when their parents started liking it, and Dick Dale showed up on ""Good Morning
    America.""</p><p>
    
    All of the Los Straitjackets' other records (four, previous to this one) are
    instrumental, and approximate all that is surf and twang.  They've put out
    mostly original stuff, though they do occasionally pull out a classic cover
    (like ""Sleepwalk"" or the theme from ""Rawhide"" on the excellent live album
    <i>Damas y Caballeros</i>).  In fact, live is best way to hear this stuff,
    because I'm not sure you can really translate the infectiousness of a good surf
    instrumental in an airtight environment-- the exhilaration and fury of the band's
    playing isn't really evident on any of the studio stuff I've heard.  Including
    this release, to an extent.</p><p>
<i>Sing along with Los Straightjackets</i> is immediately different from any
    of the band's other albums because it features vocalists on all but two songs.
    And because most real surf rock is purely instrumental (the Beach Boys weren't
    surf rock), they play it closer to trashy garage and 60s white soul here.  All
    the tunes are covers, and the band hires a cast of about a dozen to run through
    them (literally, most tunes in the 2-3 minute range).</p><p>
    
    I should state that, from the get-go, this album aims to party.  When I first
    heard it, it was somewhat underwhelming because I didn't have the opportunity to
    really play it loud.  When I did, the gems started to shine.  Big Sandy is
    arguably the star of the show, especially when he performs Spanish versions of
    ""Tallahassee Lassie"" (made famous by Freddy Cannon) and ""Mother in Law"" (Ernie
    K-Doe).  Yes, I realize these are songs that you might not normally admit to
    your mother admitting she likes.  I had many of the same thoughts when I was
    playing the stuff at the Cactus Theater.  But like me, if you give this half
    chance, you may just start to see the light.</p><p>
    
    The Reverend Horton Heat (perhaps the closes musical relative to Los
    Straightjackets' raucous revival) lays it all out on Roy Orbison's ""Down the
    Line.""  And leave it to the Reverend to remove any and all tenderness of the
    original, giving the song a pair for which the old Black Prince may have
    been too much of a gentleman to thrust upon his followers.  X's Dave Alvin
    takes a similar approach to ""California Sun,"" trying a little testosterone
    to spice up the tune's inherent bubbly beach factor.  You really can practically
    smell the pomade in this stuff.</p><p>
    
    It's not all boys, though.  Exene Cervenka (also a member of X, of course) turns
    in easily the most surprisingly great performance on this disc (""I'll Go Down
    Swinging"").  She sings with some kind of faux-country whine that I would never
    have thought could sound good, and she's something to behold here.  Her voice is
    thin-- maybe struggling to keep afloat among the completely assured, Nashville-bound
    wall of guitar and drums-- but she ends up standing out like a cow-punk diva,
    decked out in what appears to be actual heartbreak, and enhances the song with
    the persistence that only a woman let down by one too many men could. ""At least
    I'll go down swinging, what a swinging way to go.""  Reads corny, sounds like the
    gospel.</p><p>
    
    There are down spots here: Alison Moorer &amp; Lonesome Bob don't exactly light
    it up on ""I Ain't the One,"" which suffers not from a lack of heart, but from
    some seriously bland production (""drop the needle music,"" for any of you ad
    hacks out there), and L-Bob's eerie similarity to lounge crooners like Gordon
    MacRae.  It seems a shame to dump on classic songs, and my only real complaint
    with the album in general is that it sometimes gets a little too straightforward,
    like the reverence these guys may have for the material might be prohibiting
    their ability to bash and clang.  The way I get around this is by turning it
    all the way up.  Much better.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there are always going to be the non-believers out there who say
    that old music is old music and if it was any good in the first place, why don't
    I already have the originals?  To this I say, ""I don't know, why don't you?""
    I would also urge naysayers to take a road trip to Lubbock.  Take the tour, see
    the rodeo, and then grab a date and get yourself a couple of tickets to the
    Cactus on Saturday night.  Don't get too close to the stage-- just close enough
    to the aisle that you can see just what this music does to people.  And then try
    to sit still during the show.  Los Straightjackets is betting you can't do it,
    and so am I.</p></div>"|4864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4864-sing-along-with-los-straitjackets/|7.2|Dominique Leone

    members all live in separate cities.  Principle language: English.  Traditional

    about love with an occasional dash of optimism, longing, or melancholy.</p><p>
    
    You may have noticed that Spain and Spain don't really have all that much in
    common.  In fact, Spain, aren't even from Spain; they're American.  Mind you,
    this doesn't stop vocalist Josh Haden from singing with a slight English accent,
    a move that only serves to further confuse the band's geographical situation.
    There was a time, back in the 70s, when bands with place-names-- Boston, Kansas,
    Chicago-- actually came from the places they were named after.  Made things
    a whole lot easier for reviewers.</p><p>
    
    But, of course, the 80s and 90s ruined that, as Asia, Japan, and Texas-- all
    from Britain-- began climbing the charts.  Now I don't know what to think at
    all when a band comes sporting a geographical location in their moniker.  But
    this is not the issue at hand.  The issue at hand is the American band Spain's
    third album, which I must say is rather dull.</p><p>
    
    Spain is lead by the aforementioned Josh Haden, who you may know as the younger
    brother of Petra and Rachel from That Dog.  All three are the offspring of
    legendary jazz bassist Charlie Haden, an early collaborator of free-jazz
    visionary Ornette Coleman, and the band leader on nearly thirty albums of his
    own.  Needless to say, none of children followed in his musical footsteps, but
    his son did at least pick up the bass.</p><p>
    
    Haden is joined in Spain by guitarist/keyboardist Shon Sullivan, drummer Will
    Hughes, and guitarist Merlo Podlewski, all of whom are impeccable musicians
    in their own right.  The problem is that when the four of them join forces,
    the music they make is merely competent, and rarely anything more.   As a result,
    <i>I Believe</i> is one of those albums that hardly anyone could bring themselves
    to hate, but almost no one could truly latch on to.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with ""She Haunts My Dreams,"" a midtempo number with a fairly
    spacious arrangement that sounds, for all the world, like it could be a lost
    Coldplay track.  To be fair, Spain have been around for a lot longer than
    Coldplay, and Haden never clumsily reaches for a falsetto he can't quite manage
    the way Chris Martin does, but the similarity is absolutely uncanny.  For the
    first time in Spain's career, Haden has also opted to give his songs fuller,
    wetter production, which makes the comparison that much more apt.</p><p>
    
    As the disc spins on, we're confronted by a series of songs that all suffer
    from the same afflictions, to varying degrees.  For one thing, Haden's melodies
    are limited in range, and as a result, few of them are particularly memorable.
    As you're listening, each song is pleasant enough-- you can picture Haden sitting
    in a wood-paneled studio huddled over his bass and a microphone, pouring out his
    heart-- but nothing really differentiates one from another.</p><p>
    
    ""You Were Meant for Me"" is a slow, intimate, organ-kissed song about being in
    love, with a subdued melody and restrained playing.  ""Do You See the Light?""
    is a slow, intimate, organ-kissed song about being in love, with a subdued
    melody and restrained playing.  ""Oh That Feeling"" is a slow, intimate,
    organ-kissed song about being in love, with a subdued melody and restrained
    playing.  Are you beginning to sense a theme here?</p><p>
    
    At this point, I think it's important to mention that none of these songs are
    really bad, but sitting through them all in a row is a chore.  Fully half of
    them use the word ""girl"" in the chorus to refer to a lover, and grates by the
    time you get to the title track.  ""I Believe"" is actually one of the fastest
    songs on the album, bumping the familiar clean-toned guitar lines ahead a few
    ticks on the metronome for something that approaches jangly pop, but doesn't
    quite make it.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, it takes a few listens for it to sink in that ""Mary"" only has three
    actual lines of lyrics composed for it, one of which is ""Mary, Mary.""  It's yet
    another slow, intimate, organ-kissed song about being in love, with a subdued
    melody and restrained playing, so it doesn't exactly stick out of the bunch.</p><p>
    
    For the big wrap-up, I've been thinking about some possible phrases that best
    describe my feelings toward Spain.  I came up with a few like ""pretty, but
    dull,"" ""nice, but unengaging,"" and ""pleasant, unobtrusive wallpaper,"" but
    then I noticed <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> sitting on my shelf
    and realized that the late, great Douglas Adams had perhaps already said it best:
    ""mostly harmless.""</p></div>"|7397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7397-i-believe/|5.8|Joe Tangari

After years of searching through
    used record bins, bothering knowledgeable friends for recommendations, and
    picking up parasites from local thrift shops, I had found Happiness. It
    wasn't exactly in the form I'd expected. I always assumed that when I finally
    found Happiness, it would be a glowing, golden piece of vinyl with a
    radius of exactly pi, with chubby cherubs floating around it, singing their
    sweet songs of joy. Instead, I found Happiness in the form of a CD,
    packed in a seemingly normal plastic jewel case, with a pretty flower on the
    cover.</p><p>
    
    Thinking that I'd finally reached the final goal of all my years of record
    shopping, I immediately sold all my records and CDs to the local store, using
    the remaining money to buy honey and ambrosia to eat while listening to my
    newfound Happiness. I was so excited, I could barely even bring myself
    to actually listen to the CD. What mysteries lay within the sanctified aluminum
    grooves of the magical disc? The sounds of ancient spirits rejoicing at being
    freed from their earthly selves? A single sound containing an amalgamation of
    every possible waveform in the universe? Quantum theory proposes that everything
    in the universe is just a synthesis of waves of probability?  Perhaps <i>Happiness</i>
    would even be the sound of these very waves!</p><p>
    
    Finally, standing naked in the middle of my room with a glass of wine in one hand
    and a bunch of grapes in the other, I decided to unravel the mystery of <i>Happiness</i>.
    To my dismay, I discovered that there isn't all that much mystery to be unraveled.
    On their fourth album, Fridge, an instrumental band out of Putney, England fronted
    by Kieran Hebden (who also records pastoral IDM as Four Tet) and featuring bassist
    Adem Ilhan and drummer Sam Jeffers, have recorded a mellow, organic, and very
    well constructed instrumental album. Part vibraphone-laden, Chicago-style post-rock,
    part electronic minimalism, and part pure melodic exploration, <i>Happiness</i>
    occasionally manages to slip into an immensely blissful groove.</p><p>
    
    ""Melodica and Trombone"" sets the tone for the largely amorphous sound explorations
    that make up the nine tracks of <i>Happiness</i>. With an organ providing a solid
    backing for the song, trombones and melodicas weave interlacing melodies.
    Unsteady hand percussion only serves to make the song's structure more ambiguous,
    but this ambiguity adds an element of unpredictability to the track-- an element
    sorely lacking in some other places on the record.</p><p>
    
    Take, for instance, ""Drum Machines and Glockenspiels,"" a 13-minute whopper of a
    track with a steady drum machine beat and precious few changes in dynamics.
    Occasionally, some very interesting melodic interplay is achieved between the
    layers of synthesized beeps, chiming glockenspiels, and subtly plucked guitars
    that provide the primary melodic focus of the track. As the song progresses,
    more and more instruments enter the fray-- some more hand percussion, a snare
    drum, a flute-like instrument, and a more abrasive programmed beat. By the
    twelve-minute mark, the song has made about two minutes of progress.  The
    melodies themselves just aren't strong enough to support this kind of sustained
    inaction.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, <i>Happiness</i> soon redeems itself, drifting away from structured
    songs and towards some beautiful explorations of sound and melody. ""Cut Up
    Piano and Xylophone,"" one of the album's most blissfully structureless tracks,
    is also one of its strongest. Rather than simply piling on endless instruments,
    the song arranges minced samples of the titular instruments into a shifting,
    quivering soundscape of descending scales that recalls Tortoise's ""Ten-Day
    Interval"" or Ghost's ""Daggma."" The relatively short ""Tone Guitar and Drum Noise""
    further explores the less structured side of Fridge, consisting almost entirely
    of a simple guitar figure, treble drones, and rhythmic noise. At the song's end
    comes one of the most stunningly gorgeous moments on <i>Happiness</i>: the pure,
    crisp ring of gently colliding bells.</p><p>
    
    Generally speaking, <i>Happiness</i> is at its best when it focuses on sound
    rather than song.  Fridge seem to work much better with implicit structures than
    with explicit ones, and when the songs on this record become too formal and
    arranged, they sink quickly into sonic complacency. Thankfully, there are enough
    moments of beauty on this record to make up for an occasional lack of forward
    momentum. By all means, Fridge have constructed a lovely record. But there's a
    lot more to true Happiness than just being pretty.</p></div>"|3198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3198-happiness/|7.7|Matt LeMay

There are precious
    few ideas, innovations and excesses that have not been, at one point or another,
    warmly welcomed inside. But that famous hospitality has only been grudgingly
    extended to the spoken word; its presence has frequently earmarked the music for
    charges of pretentiousness, academicism and self-indulgence. 75-piece symphony
    orchestras and 40-minute exploratory jazz-rock odysseys have always been given
    a pass, but for some reason, the spoken word has been dogged at almost every
    turn. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. Spoken word contributions have provided
    some of modern music's most abysmal moments: the faux-T.S. Eliot boilerplate
    tacked onto the end of the Moody Blues' ""Nights in White Satin,"" for instance;
    or pretty much anything by Jim Morrison. More recently, the momentarily hyped
    Lift to Experience littered their album, <i>The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads</i>
    with ponderous Biblical citations and confessional chitchat.</p><p>
    
    But the spoken word has surely had its moments. Langston Hughes' sly and dolorous
    poems set to the muted burlesque of Charles Mingus made <i>Weary Blues</i> one of
    the more elegant and thoughtful recordings in modern jazz. The delirious,
    intertwined poetics of the Velvet Underground's ""The Murder Mystery"" made the
    track one of the artiest, and arguably, most ambitious thing they recorded in
    the post-Cale period. The nightmarish recordings of Hitler on John Zorn's
    <i>Kritsallnacht</i> lent that record an unimaginable sense of terror. Brian
    McMahan's bored, pedestrian narratives on Slint's <i>Spiderland</i> were so
    defiantly anti-musical that they came off punk as fuck. And what music fan
    doesn't have the words ""Number 9, Number 9, Number 9"" burned in their
    consciousness as one of the creepiest sound bites of the 1960s, Manson's cracked
    race war interpretations aside?</p><p>
    
    Per Mission's aptly titled <i>A Ritual Loop</i> employs the human voice to almost
    liturgical effect: pressed intimately against other voices, set to sparse,
    nocturnal accompaniment, intermittently intelligible, and eerily lovely. Calling
    Per Mission a side project is virtually pointless; sorting out the musical
    lineages of the Louisville, Kentucky scene is like untangling Hapsburg
    genealogies: an endless combination and recombination of incest and various
    degrees of greatness. Jason Noble, ostensibly Per Mission's creative director,
    played in the short-lived, now legendary Rodan before becoming a primary member
    of the Shipping News and Rachel's. Per Mission also features pianist Rachel
    Grimes, violist Christian Frederickson, drummer Edward Grimes (all members of
    Rachel's); as well as Shipping News drummer Kyle Crabtree.</p><p>
    
    But perhaps appropriately, <i>A Ritual Loop</i> boasts no credits. Mastered by
    art-electronics-found-sound wizards, Matmos, the album has an air of anonymity
    that's captivating. Female voices, electronics, and live instruments are all
    distilled indistinguishably in dark, gothic erotica. The opening track, ""Two
    Stories,"" blends various narratives where true voices read against distortions,
    slowed and sped-up vocal tracks, and the occasional flash of pitter-patter drum
    machines. The female voices are soft and close, as if reading dirty French poems
    and somewhat ashamed. Unfortunately, the beats on ""Two Stories"" are tried and
    obvious. But the rich, tribal percussion of ""In Full View"" apologize for an early
    misstep: bright bells and low drums amidst circling organs and growling effects;
    its post-rock's evil twin, meticulous and menacing. The spare, piano-dominated
    ""Headphoneland"" resuscitates the narrative, albeit in fragmented form: stutters
    of female voice that don't quite add up to good sense. In the background, behind
    the voice that continuously attempts the word ""music,"" electronic effects seem
    to slip backwards. The song simply unravels.</p><p>
    
    The dark psychedelic terror of ""Bassdemetr"" should be kept on a continuous loop
    on October 31st; the cymbals crash with trepidation, while organs and processed
    effects pile layer upon layer of breathless noise. You can feel it in the pit of
    your stomach, and on the back of your neck. Likewise, the murky, beautiful ""The
    Aureate"" spreads processed guitars over the manically methodical drums,
    punctuated by bells. The ghostly murmur spins out from the corners like spider
    webs. The tangled male and female narratives of ""Discovered/Incised"" unfolds
    thoughtfully over exotic acoustic guitars, reminiscent of the late John Fahey.
    The voices do not need to be understood to be compelling. They are briefly
    everywhere.</p><p>
<i>A Ritual Loop</i> is wonderful when it manages these moments of penetration:
    when the voices truly seem omnipresent, when the fuzzy beats assimilate into the
    environment, when the organs get in your bones. And although it works more often
    than not; its failure is somewhat contaminating. There's nothing worse than a
    spooky, sexual masterpiece exposed as obvious and gimmicky. It's like seeing the
    staples on the skeleton in the haunted house; or suddenly realizing the spiders
    hang down from strings.</p><p>
    
    The ingenious deployment of the human voice may be the factor that continuously
    keeps <i>A Ritual Loop</i> from devolving into the minimalist psych-world-dub
    that Bill Laswell has been rehashing for the last ten years.  Yet, like Laswell,
    <i>A Ritual Loop</i> seems to make the most sense in the bedroom, where you're
    too preoccupied to pick at its inconsistencies. The voices, instruments, and
    electronics, when left alone, seem most palpable. But one cannot deny the
    incredible effect the spoken word has on what might otherwise be lackluster
    ambience. It's a different brand of ambience: not a room full of abstract sound,
    but a room momentarily full of life.</p></div>"|6229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6229-a-ritual-loop/|6.7|Brent S. Sirota

    Crimson t-shirts?  It's often said that history is merely a documentation of
    the winners of the past, and that the cultural values we take for granted
    are but the idiosyncrasies of our more dominant ancestors.  In another life--
    one where angst and dissatisfaction never broke through the status quo-- the
    idea of bypassing an entire generation's music of rebellion (and subsequent,
    inevitable dilution into dozens of genera) doesn't seem so far-fetched.</p><p>
    
    And yet, there's a maligned minority that sees history differently.  You know
    the type: the guy across the street who lives in his mom's basement blasting
    Gabriel-era Genesis all night; the guy who never realizes most people don't get
    Roger Dean's album covers because most people don't live in Oz.  It would be one
    thing if this guy was all alone in his quest to defy history, but the more you
    investigate, the more you realize that there are hundreds, thousands, maybe
    millions of these guys out there.  Given this stubborn counter-culture, it
    should come as no surprise that there are indeed multiple versions of history.</p><p>
    
    Oysterhead is something of a regional convention for the Other History.  Three
    basement veterans, each of whom have served time as resident oddball in their
    respective musical families, converge to compare notes and celebrate the
    obsessively against-the-grain.  So, without further ado, I give you the dirty
    trio: Les Claypool (bassist/leader of Primus), Trey Anastasio (guitarist for
    Phish), and Stewart Copeland (formerly the drummer for the Police).  And although
    mainstream history might lead you to believe that theirs would be an embarrassingly
    insular union, it's not really that out of touch.</p><p>
    
    I should add that the rock supergroup is not exactly a new idea.  Additionally,
    its reputation as being more of an interlude for the diehard fan than any kind
    of lasting partnership doesn't lend much credence to Oysterhead's existence.
    Claypool has long been a vocal fan of the Police, so the Copeland connection
    seems a natural bond.  Anastasio appears to be the wild card here, and though
    I don't listen to a lot of Phish, I have to admit that his willingness to explore
    all manner of tone colors and styles in this environment is commendable.</p><p>
    
    Claypool's sensibilities seem to shine through most brightly on <i>The Grand
    Pecking Order</i>.  It's not just his basslines (which would be almost impossible
    to seamlessly integrate into any musical scenario, save an orchestra of rubber
    bands), but also his persistent juxtaposition of strange voices and stranger
    characters.  Of course, this applies as much to the band itself as the songs,
    and that his stamp seems most evident on the proceedings is predictable in
    hindsight.</p><p>
    
    Tunes like ""Mr. Oysterhead,"" ""Army's on Ecstasy"" and ""Shadow of a Man"" could
    almost pass for Primus tunes with their rather single-minded narrative focus,
    bass-driven grooves and faux-Waits character studies.  However, these are the
    kinds of tunes that benefit most from the trio's collaboration.  Copeland plays
    with simultaneously more subtlety and precision here than anyone who has played
    with Claypool in the past, and though Anastasio seems to have been underutilized
    in many places, is nothing if not more tasteful than Claypool.  Is that a
    recommendation?  Are you a Primus fan?  Let me try again.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the dynamic shifts towards Anastasio, whose songwriting ability is
    easily the most traditionally melodic of Oysterhead's three members.  He seems
    to have been the driving force behind tunes like ""Radon Balloon"" (an acoustic
    pop song in the vein of <i>Mummer</i>-era XTC), ""Birthday Boys"" and ""Oz is Ever
    Floating.""  In each of these instances, melody was placed ahead of the purely
    groovy, and even though the group lacks any kind of real frontman, vocally
    speaking, Anastasio's melodies tend to linger in my head longer than Claypool's.
    Again, it's the playing that will probably get the most headlines for this group,
    and though I would hesitate to read too much into this music, it's possible
    Anastasio could ultimately end up with the most to lose by ""throwing away"" songs
    here.</p><p>
    
    And then there was Sir Copeland, and his heavenly snare and high-hat.  From a
    compositional point of view, it's difficult to tell how much he was involved,
    save an interesting spoken-word/ambient piece called ""Wield the Spade"" near the
    end of the disc.  Copeland may have been invited to this summit more out of
    hero-worship from his partners than anything else, but musically, I wonder whom
    the real leader of this project was.  It's obvious he hasn't lost much in the
    fifteen or so years since we last heard him behind the kit (and Sting, talk about
    being a ""backup"" musician), and I couldn't help but reminisce a little for the
    days when this kind of passion for playing was transmitting from radios
    everywhere.  I'd heard that Copeland had gotten lost in a sea of soundtracks
    and ballets, and was prepared for the worst.  Surprisingly, he sounds great.
    Chalk one up for the forty-somethings that he governs the pace for musos 15
    years his junior.</p><p>
    
    What disappoints about this album is that the idiosyncrasies of the musicians
    never actually gel into something other than a sampling of their individual
    styles.  I guess it's a bittersweet truth that the ones who can find a way to
    fend off contamination from trends and what is or isn't ""cool"" are often as
    steeped in their own methods as any punk poet or pop hack.  If Oysterhead turns
    out to be more than a one-off distraction, and one day releases music that ends
    up being more than the sum of its parts, I guess some kind of historical revision
    would be in order regarding rock star collaboration.  As it is, you get a
    painless lesson in experimental funk-rock, supergroup dynamics, and that you
    should never underestimate the influence of the guy in the basement across the
    street.  He's not going away.</p></div>"|6080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6080-the-grand-pecking-order/|6.0|Dominique Leone

    mission during WWII, but that isn't important. I'm feeling charitable and, well,
    these guys sort of rock, too. A lot. It's taken me quite a few listens but I'm
    feeling them.</p><p>
    
    That said, I surely would have been about ten times as into this as I am now had
    I first come across this in, say, ninth or tenth grade. By that, I simply mean
    that Pilot to Gunner gets by on that sort of overtly ""rock,"" unabashedly
    guitar-centric and kinetic sort of energy that adolescents, by dint of hormones
    or lack of cynical inhibitions, are so susceptible to.</p><p>
    
    There is, however, much more than brutish chugga-chugga rhythms and screamy
    vocals to enjoy here.  For that sophisticate, college-jerk husk you wear over
    your dopey inner high-schooler, there's intricate guitar interplay, tense chords,
    and drumming that's tasteful to the utmost. So there. You allowed to like it now.
    But chances are that, after several listens, you'll probably like it whether you
    want to or not.</p><p>
    
    For starters, Pilot to Gunner is sing-songy as fuck.  Scott Padden's voice hovers
    somewhere between Archers of Loaf's Eric Bachmann and-- forgive me-- Faith No
    More's original singer Chuck Mosely (better known in some circles as ""?""). It's
    a throaty, hoarse, rousing kind of prolet-rock exhalation, not too far from the
    style of Tim Armstrong of Rancid and Operation Ivy fame. Coupled with the high
    quality dueling guitar parts, Madden's raspy pipes, and the contagious vocal
    lines they belt out, constitute the heart of these songs.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Every Minute is a Movie,"" isn't the strongest choice for a lead-off
    track, but is still a reasonably above-par song. It begins with a few measures of
    handclaps, lifted straight from the intro to the Supremes' ""Where Did Our Love
    Go,"" before a buzzing wall of fairly corny riffery appears suddenly.  The track's
    vocals are the album's weakest, specifically in the verse sections, but still
    offer a considerable pay-off in the chorus. In any case, Padden immediately makes
    his presence and style felt, using his voice to great rhythmic and melodic effect.
    The end of the song features a short two-voice section that works very well,
    recalling the similar vocal stylings of Archers of Loaf and any number of
    D.C.-area acts.</p><p>
    
    ""We Got Games at High Speeds,"" the second and title track, raises the bar to the
    high level the album will remain at for most of its duration.  Again, the melody
    is key, though this track boasts some of the album's neatest play between the
    guitar and bass, and lays the foundation for the 1-2-3 punch of gripping,
    anthemic rock that follows.  ""Zero Return,"" ""Put It In the Post,"" and ""It's So
    Good to Be Here in Paris"" comprise ten straight minutes of shockingly good punk
    that seems to draw heavily from the more melodic strains of the D.C. tradition,
    but sounds vaguely like a less cartoonish At the Drive-In.  Nevertheless, while
    these songs should sound sonically familiar, it's nearly impossible to discern
    obvious influences, which is, of course, the hallmark of a good band.</p><p>
    
    There is an unfortunate, though slight, dip in song quality on ""Bring It Libe""
    and ""Believer Receiver"" (tracks six and seven, respectively).  They sound like
    knock-offs of the album's better songs, and noticeably less inspired. But then
    the ship is righted and stays so for the remaining three tracks: ""Band Finale,""
    ""The Lurid Loop's Dead"" and ""Run Interference.""</p><p>
    
    Whatever their songwriting technique, Pilot to Gunner seem to have the
    communication side of things down pat, which reflects their evocative bandname
    pretty nicely.  Rock wheezes on.</p></div>"|6291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6291-games-at-high-speeds/|7.7|Camilo Arturo Leslie

And I'm not
    talking about Lyte Funky Ones.  This LFO's acronym stood for Low Frequency
    Oscillators, but their parents knew them as Gez Varley and Mark Bell. Warp
    Records more than knew them; they loved them: Varley and Bell provided the
    fledging Sheffield-based label with their first hit, ""LFO."" When I first heard
    the song, it was on the British chart TV show ""Top of the Pops,"" and my tiny
    television speakers couldn't handle the 5Hz basslines. Fascinated by the machine
    music that my second favorite machine couldn't deal with, I bought the single.
    The frequencies contained on the CD were low enough to be inaudible to ear,
    yet felt by the body.</p><p>
    Years later, after I became a socially inept hi-fi enthusiast, LFO's ""Love is
    the Message"" EP became my battle weapon. I'd approach sales assistants and ask
    to try out their new Kef speakers, handing them the disc and standing back.
    Neither the Kef speakers nor the upscale Finnish hi-fi could register the low
    frequency oscillations. I would tell the assistant that his equipment just wasn't
    up to snuff and demand that my disc be removed from the gussied-up Best Buy
    system. I was truly obnoxious. Not even the CIA's psy-ops speakers could register
    the quake elements of LFO tracks. I was truly hated.</p><p>
    After two albums (<i>Frequencies</i> and <i>Advanced</i>), Varley and Bell
    dissolved their partnership. I'd like to think that was due to their brain
    chemistries being altered by exposure to sub-audible sounds, rather than the
    usual ""Behind the Music"" ego-tripping. Whatever the cause, Bell went onto
    become a superstar producer, accepting checks and air kisses from Depeche Mode,
    Deltron 3030, Björk, and, rumor has it, Tenacious D.  Varley, by contrast, stayed
    low to the ground, where he's been ever since. Regrettably, most people just
    haven't noticed.</p><p>
<i>Bayou Paradis</i>, Varley's second album under his (assumed) birthname, is
    unlikely to get him much attention beyond his usual audience.  And listening to
    the flawless Chain Reaction-esque techno of the album, I get the impression he
    cares not. Varley's motivation has always been the groove. His fixation reached
    an early peak under the G-Man guise with the minimalist classic ""Quo Vadis?"" and
    its accompanying album, 1996's <i>Kushti</i>.  The record still sounds coolly
    alien, like the irresistible funk of the interstellar medium.</p><p>
    Varley came back down to Earth with 1997's <i>Gez Varley Presents Tony Montana</i>,
    displaying more of his allegiance to the fuzzy dub-techno of the Berlin-Detroit
    Chain Reaction axis.  Not straying from that hazy brotherhood, <i>Bayou Paradis</i>
    belongs to the same clubbier faction of the alliance as his previous albums. In
    fact, <i>Bayou Paradis</i> superbly matches Maurizio's self-titled Chain Reaction
    disc. Both albums relish shimmering percussion tracks and blindingly reflective
    surface washes, whereas others in the alliance fuzz everything out in a glowering
    haze.</p><p>
<i>Bayou Paradis</i> begins in this radiance with ""Le Soleil,"" which appropriately
    shimmers and pulses with the immense energy of a solar flare.  The title track
    mocks the primitive percussion sounds of LFO's debut album by placing them in a
    sumptuous new dustless environment. The doomy ""Violator"" contrasts well with the
    title track. (Is Varley deliberately referencing the Depeche Mode album of the
    same name? If so, is Varley chiding Bell for his chasing of major label cash?)
    The track is a darkwave stomper, easily gloomy enough for the most morbid
    Covenant fan. The following cut, ""Gardelle,"" returns to the Maurizio camp, but
    adds far more clippy and current hi-hat and cymbal programming. Underneath,
    there's the familiar and beloved rim-shot rumble that harks back to acid house,
    recalling Phuture's ""Acid Trax.""</p><p>
    This record succeeds in its modest aims. Varley has created another set of classy
    club-ready tunes that techno DJs will justifiably drool over.  The man doesn't
    try for anything else.  But whatever anyone thinks about Varley's old studio
    partner, no one could excuse Mark Bell of not thinking beyond the boxes arrayed
    in front of him.  Varley seems to hide behind his equipment, letting the machines
    suck up attention.  Regardless, if Gez ever plans to make the artistic leap that
    many have always trusted he could, <i>Bayou Paradis</i> shows no sign of it.</p></div>"|8415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8415-bayou-paradis/|7.7|Paul Cooper

Earlier this year,
    he toured Europe opening for A Silver Mt. Zion, and the stripped-down Godspeed
    unit served as backing band during his set. When the caravan swung through
    Amsterdam, they dropped into radio station VPRO for a live broadcast, and this
    four song EP is the document.</p><p>
    
    Frankie Sparo must be one of those artists that works better in small doses,
    because this 18-minute gem is far more enjoyable than his recent full-length,
    <i>My Red Scare</i>.  The disc includes three songs from that album-- one of
    which is radically reworked, and the other two are sweetened with the Silver Mt.
    Zion touch-- and then closes with a solid Stones cover. It's a fine little
    record, and oddly enough, it's more diverse than his twelve-song long-player.
    Even more importantly, when this brief EP ends, I wish there was just a bit
    more.</p><p>
    
    ""Diminish Me New York"" is perhaps the best song from the debut, and he wisely
    opens both <i>Arena Hostile</i> and most of his live sets with it. A Silver Mt.
    Zion add some subtle industrial sound effects, which are perfect, and the string
    swells give the tune the majesty it deserves. As I stated before, the lyrics are
    almost unbearably sad in light of what's happened to New York since it was
    recorded, but it would be hard not to appreciate Sparo's sense of lyric detail
    in any circumstance.</p><p>
    
    ""The Night We Stayed In"" gets a little boost from a walking double bass, and the
    strings here seem slightly maudlin, like incidental music from a fancy Italian
    wedding. Oddly enough, the warmer, brighter treatment the tune gets here works
    much better with Sparo's downcast vocals than the dark shadings of the debut,
    providing a welcome contrast.</p><p>
    
    ""Here Comes the Future"" is also from <i>My Red Scare</i>, but the tune is barely
    recognizable in this vastly superior version. For the first time on either of
    his two records, Sparo actually picks up the tempo a bit, and it suits him
    nicely. Surprisingly, the mood is lightened further by the presence of some
    slightly cheesy drum-machine handclaps. Organ, violin and viola once again flesh
    out the sound, making this perhaps my favorite moment of Sparo's thus far.</p><p>
    
    The final Stones cover is a good one, the less-than-obvious ballad ""I Am
    Waiting."" It's nice to hear Sparo's grizzled voice wrapping itself around a
    superior melody, and the spare instrumentation (this one is just him and guitar)
    helps highlight the fact. I enjoyed <i>My Red Scare</i>, but I was sure I'd never
    seek out another Sparo record. <i>Arena Hostile</i> is a touching, modest
    artifact that will make me think twice.</p></div>"|7403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7403-arena-hostile-ep/|7.4|Mark Richard-San

    Three years after being ejected from Spiritualized by the band's control freak
    leader Jason Pierce, they're off on their own, unabashedly plying the same exact
    modern psychedelia that was their old band's calling card. And why shouldn't
    they?  Despite Pierce's perfectionist tendencies, these guys were big architects
    of the Spiritualized sound, and should have the right to revert to it whenever
    they see fit.</p><p>
<i>The Carnivorous Lunar Activities of Lupine Howl</i> is, in name, the first
    full-length for the new band, though their U.S. debut, the <i>125</i> EP, was
    more or less an album itself, clocking in over the 40-minute mark.  Here, they
    stretch nine songs out over the course of almost a full hour, coating everything
    with a thick purple haze of noisy guitar and noodly keyboards.</p><p>
    
    Lupine Howl essentially take the bluesiest moments of past Spiritualized records
    and use them as the starting point for their sound, placing the emphasis on
    gritty rock rave-ups, and adding another Marshall to the stack for every
    orchestra member Pierce hired for <i>Let It Come Down</i>.  The sound actually
    ends up landing closer to the dark, swirling shoegazer sessions of Pierce's old
    band, Spacemen 3, than it does to anything Spiritualized have put their name on
    lately.</p><p>
    
    The most unfortunate aspect of the sound Lupine Howl have settled upon is that
    it's extremely prone to excess.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the
    rambling, bastard Krautrock breakdown that drags ""Carnival"" out to an
    interminable 10:21.  The song itself isn't really that bad, possessed of a
    decent melody, drums and vocals cast adrift in spacy reverb, and some
    well-layered guitar tracks, but the extremely repetitive, noisy riffs that pile
    atop one another in the midsection render the full track flaccid and
    directionless.</p><p>
    
    Bassist/vocalist Sean Cook holds up well as a frontman, making the most of his
    strong, if melodically limited, voice and wailing away like a man possessed on
    his harmonica.  But he's often jinxed as he and the rest of the band let the
    songs escape their grasp.  Most of these tracks would be a lot better if the
    players had the willpower to restrict their length to below five minutes, but
    nearly every song contains some distracting movement or pointless, noisy outro,
    diminishing its impact.</p><p>
    
    For example, ""125"" comes equipped with a laser guided melody, as Cook stretches
    out the phrases and really digs into the long notes while Mike Mooney's guitar
    careens off every audible object in the background.  It's all in the endings,
    though, and the band have sadly decided to take the approach that more is more,
    piling layer upon layer of feedback on without ever giving thought to shaping
    it into something memorable the way a true master of the form like Kevin Shields
    might have.  The song lurches to a soupy halt without ever attempting a return
    to the verse structure that made it work in the first place.</p><p>
    
    It's not all bad, though-- in fact, the album is bookended by two of its best
    tracks.  The single, ""Vaporizer,"" opens things at a fuzzed-out gallop, announcing
    Lupine Howl's brand of psych with an authoritative shout.  ""The Jam That Ate
    Itself"" closes things on a high note, applying one of the band's more restrained
    arrangements to a killer percussion groove laid down by regular drummer Damon
    Reece (augmented here by Johnny Mattock, another ex-member of Spiritualized).</p><p>
    
    The best song of the whole lot, though, is ""This Condition,"" the one track with
    just the right number of layers and the correct amount of breathing room around
    the vocals the entire way through.  The final line, ""I wonder do you ever get
    the feeling you've been cheated?"" may or may not be a swipe at the band's former
    partner, but it's delivered with incredible feeling, as Cook breaths his soul
    into his harmonica. It's one of the few moments on the album that really grabs
    you by the throat and demands that you listen, and it's almost enough to make
    you forget most of padding the band subjects you to earlier on.</p><p>
    
    The balancing act between excellence and excess ultimately yields in favor of
    the band, as even the most labored songs manage to reveal a bit of soul in their
    verses.  If Lupine Howl could simply step back from their songs for a second and
    realize that what they need is some space in the mix and a bit of a trim, they
    could start making music on the order of their old band.  Hiring an outside
    producer might not be a bad place to start.</p><p>
    
    In the end, fans of Spiritualized may enjoy this, and might be interested in
    checking it out, but few others will be enticed by what they hear.  At the very
    least, Lupine Howl have shown that can hold their own without Jason Pierce, even
    if the music they make isn't half as transcendent as something like ""Broken
    Heart,"" or ""Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space.""  Given time, though,

    I recorded four mixtapes, themed around the seasons of the year.  An aloof
    emotional gesture, to be sure.  The tapes traced the story of our relationship--
    from the carefree delight of summer, through the bittersweet grandeur of autumn,
    the desolate alienation of winter and the transcendent majesty of spring.  Yeah,
    I'm a geek.  So are you.</p><p>
    If 1999's anthemic <i>Source Material</i> compilation embodied the breezy spirit
    of June and July, and the sorrow-tinged tones of Kreidler's ""Au Pair"" and Air's
    ""All I Need"" represented October, <i>Retrofitting</i> would have filled the gap
    in between.  The mood of this album is upbeat, but laced with moments of
    reflective nostalgia and a subtle tinge of regret.  It's that same pang of
    sadness you feel when twilight creeps in on a Sunday sky, or when a cool Labor
    Day breeze signals the close of summer.</p><p>
<i>Retrofitting</i> is the debut full-length of Looper knob-twiddler Scott
    Twynholm, whose previous solo output had been limited to a 7"" released last year.
    Twynholm's work as Metrovavan infuses the twee-hop styles of Looper's <i>The
    Geometrid</i> with a darker emotional timbre, shifting emphasis from the group's
    fluffy lyrics to his instrumental and technical talents.  Only two songs on this
    record feature singing, but Twynholm seems to work best without vocals.  The
    instrumentals on <i>Retrofitting</i> showcase his crisp sampling techniques and
    his knack for stereo noodling, with the hollow vocals rarely being anything more
    than a distraction.</p><p>
    The banal, cloying lyrics simply take themselves too seriously to be effective.
    And the prominence Metrovavan gives to the vocal arrangements on ""I'm Glad I'm
    Not a Spaceman"" and ""Behind the Last Star"" comes at some expense to the
    instrumental nuance that marks the rest of the album.</p><p>
    The rest of the material on this disc is surprisingly well-crafted-- the melodies
    are catchy without being cliché, the songs are danceable without being predictable,
    and the instrumental arrangements reference a variety of genres without falling
    into any particular one.  The album opens on a brilliant note with ""Space Shadows,""
    a lush cocktail of acoustic strumming, undulating basslines and washed-out amp
    feedback.  Glitchy flourishes creep in at the song's margins while sharp
    snare-fed breaks set the tempo.</p><p>
    ""French Lessons,"" a soft down-tempo groove garnished with cymbal splashes and a
    melange of vocal samples, continues in the chill, wistful vein of the record.
    All that's missing from this autumnal tune is a brick-hearth fireplace and a mug
    of hot cider.  Elsewhere, Metrovavan plies his hand at a more obtuse sound on
    ""Keep Breathing"" and ""A Parisian Taxi Ride in November.""  More dissonant and
    atonal than the rest of the album, these songs are nonetheless quite engaging,
    and number among <i>Retrofitting</i>'s standouts.</p><p>
    It's not often that an album's hook retains my interest for more than a few
    listens.  The appeal of a quality single typically only lasts long enough to
    rope the listener into the more complex songs, then becomes transparent and
    eventually vanishes.  The 24-karat sonic splendor of ""Because of the Sun"" breaks
    this mold; it's at once the most accessible and the most elaborate song on this
    disc.  What starts out as a linear electro jam evolves into a feel-good dancefloor
    breakout.  The buoyant basslines and funky organ riffs are offset by the distant
    wail of a plaintive guitar, and the refrains come at you from all angles,
    touching on every imaginable channel of the stereo spectrum.</p><p>
    A mere ten songs comprise this album-- two of those are filler, and another two
    are rendered unlistenable by Twynholm's sappy vocals.  This album could stand to
    be longer, and could stand to simply be more.  Six strong tracks make for a
    laudable effort, but <i>Retrofitting</i> just isn't ambitious enough to stand
    out as a classic.  Hopefully, Metrovavan will proffer up a little more substance
    on his next record and dispose of the frivolous lyrics.  But if he doesn't, I'm
    sure I'll still be happy with <i>Retrofitting</i>; it certainly surpassed my
    expectations.</p></div>"|5254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5254-retrofitting/|7.0|Malcolm Seymour III

    precisely 6:30 a.m.  I tend to respond by rolling slightly to the right, just
    enough to smite the snooze button and earn myself another nine minutes. But on
    this particular morning, I gave myself a few extra hours to recover from the
    previous night's three-hour haul from Washington, D.C.</p><p>
    I'd been in D.C. for a concert by Pitchfork heartthrobs Sigur Rós. The Album Leaf
    (aka Tristeza's Jimmy LaValle) opened the show accompanied by another guitarist
    and synth player, a bassist, and a drummer. I suppose the band was effective in
    setting the mood with their unsurprising washes of Fender Rhodes, delayed guitar
    lines, and well, pretty much delayed everything.  And while their performance was
    fairly forgettable, their simplicity mellowed the crowd in the only way
    appropriate before we were to be enveloped in the gorgeousness of our glacial
    Icelanders.</p><p>
    So yeah, I woke up around 10:30 (the wallpaper contractor I'd set an appointment
    with a few days earlier finally roused my sleepy ass out of bed by banging
    100,000 times on the front door).  Cardboard boxes were strewn across the floor
    of my room, all of which had arrived while I was out the day before, most bearing
    the ""Insound"" return address. These were empty, of course, and a stack of
    unwrapped discs sat patiently on my desk.  I glanced at the new music with a bit
    of indecisiveness, then pulled out the Album Leaf's <i>One Day I'll Be on Time</i>
    from somewhere near the bottom of the pile.</p><p>
    I wasn't excepting anything spectacular from the record, and as it turned out,
    there were no surprises.  ""Gust of..."" gently opens with-- shock!-- a droning
    organ before proceeding into pretty homogenous figures of arpeggiating organ and
    synthlines.  Homogenous, that is, to the entire record.  Every few songs we get
    a bit of guitar, and if we're lucky, drums or drum-machine.  But for the most
    part, <i>One Day I'll Be on Time</i> is about minimalism: minimal song variation,
    minimal melodic creativity, minimal staying power.</p><p>
    There are, of course, a few instrumental pop numbers for contrast. ""In Between
    Lines,"" a prime example, wouldn't have sounded out of place on U2's last record.
    (This is not a compliment.)  Interlocking lines of delayed guitar hit it off with
    lighthearted beat programming and facile synth ornaments. Perhaps the banality
    of the track could have been maximized had Bono been called in to sing over it.</p><p>
    The record isn't an utter waste, though; a couple moments of serenity are
    sequenced well enough to save it from total abandonment.  The best of these
    comes with ""Story Board."" The track seems to have been recorded with a single
    compressor microphone in a room with the windows open, letting the sounds of
    highway traffic seep in.  We imagine LaValle hunched over his acoustic guitar
    in an asinine mockery of Nick Drake's disconsolate poses.  Here, the subtle
    Rhodes overdubs, rather than seeming contrived, complement the circular patterns
    of guitar quite calmly.</p><p>
    But the bulk of <i>One Day I'll Be on Time</i>'s remaining duration, despite the
    genre in which this record could easily be pigeonholed, is far from easy listening.
    ""Vermillion"" all too dangerously approaches new age cheese; ""Hang Over"" is like
    an inebriated guitarist stumbling over his own minimalism; and ""Glimmer,"" the
    album's closer, is... wait, I already used ""new age,"" right?</p><p>
    By the time the record ended, I'd forgotten about the wallpaper guy, who had
    already nearly finished putting up the new pattern downstairs.  As I descended,
    he asked me what it was I'd been listening to.  ""The Album Leaf.""  He mentioned
    that he was also a massage therapist (I'm thinking he's like that guy on ""The
    Pretender"" who can do anything), and that he thought the album would be ""very
    appropriate"" for his massage sessions.  Considering the nature of the album,
    that possibility didn't seem too remote.</p><p>
    Somehow, the conversation got around to ambient music and Brian Eno (What can I
    say? This guy <i>is</i> The Pretender!). I contended that Brian Eno is a virtuoso
    of space, which contributes to the dynamism of his ambient works, and that James
    LaValle simply changes instruments to create what ends up being an artificial
    dynamic.  The contractor agreed, but then reminded me that even Brian Eno has
    produced a few U2 records.</p></div>"|100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/100-one-day-ill-be-on-time/|5.9|Christopher F. Schiel

    Which means these are tough times for me. American culture (if you want to call
    it that) is becoming homogenized to the point where it's getting hard to tell
    one place from another. Case in point: I recently moved from a small Midwestern
    college town to a sprawling Southern metropolis. Once upon a time, this would
    have meant major culture shock, but I hardly blinked, and now I feel like I've
    been cheated out of something.</p><p>
    
    Imagine traveling half way around the world to find out St. Petersburg is exactly
    the same as Chicago. I'm not saying it's to this point yet, but wouldn't you feel
    robbed?  That's how I felt.  No matter where I go, I'm always only five blocks
    (or so) from the nearest McDonald's, ten from Starbucks, and so on. There's just
    this disheartening sameness everywhere I go.  But, not to despair: there's always
    music.  And one of the many great things about music is that it can preserve
    these regional distinctions.</p><p>
    
    Defining musical periods throughout history have always been closely tied to
    geography-- unique moments that could have only happened at a specific place
    and time. Late 18th through early 19th century Vienna, early 20th century Paris,
    mid-50s Memphis, late-60s Detroit, early-80s New Zealand: there's an unmistakable
    regional distinctiveness that sets these places and times apart. Even today,
    anyone with a basic familiarity with indie rock can usually tell the difference
    between a Chicago band and one from, say, Portland.</p><p>
    
    Lately, I've been enjoying the regional distinctiveness of the sounds coming out
    of Philadelphia: the so-called ""Psychedelphia"" scene.  The term is a little
    restrictive (and more than a little clunky), and many of the bands categorized
    under the catch-all banner have little to do with one another.  Most could even
    hardly be called ""psychedelic.""  But there is (at least from my standpoint as
    an outside observer) a sense of community underpinning many of these artists,
    and a common feeling of exploration rooted in common influences.</p><p>
    
    Bardo Pond probably has the highest profile of any of the participants, or maybe
    the Lilys.  But there's also Aspera (formerly Aspera Ad Astra), Asteroid #4,
    Lenola, Three 4 Tens, and the Photon Band (I highly recommend Lounge Records'
    <i>Sounds from Psychedelphia</i> compilation for a good overview). The band that
    first got me interested was Bent Leg Fatima. First off, what a great name, but
    more importantly, their early Pink Floyd-inspired saucerful-of-drone was a
    pop-eschewing wake-up call. Yeah, it was a little revivalistic, but not cheaply
    so.</p><p>
    
    Bent Leg Fatima didn't last very long, but it was ultimately a good thing because
    three-fourths of them went on to form Need New Body with some other like-minded
    freaks. Their self-titled debut does a fine job of taking the Bent Leg's best
    elements and warping them beyond much recognition by adding, well, a little bit
    of everything.</p><p>
    
    It would probably help to say that Bablicon's Blue Hawaii recorded most of this
    album, and that Bablicon themselves play on a lot of it, as do Aspera (though
    their contribution is unclear). But while Bablicon's imprint is visible, they
    never overshadow the primary members. Need New Body share a similar sprawling,
    labyrinthine quality with Bablicon, but whereas the main point of departure for
    Bablicon is early Soft Machine, for Need New Body it's Faust-by-way-of-Zappa,
    or maybe Beefheart.</p><p>
    
    At times absurd, ominous, or otherworldly, the debut begins with ""Dirty Bitch
    Medley"" as a wavering Middle Eastern horn intro launches into an ultra-repetitive
    beat that draws you in by making you wonder exactly when (or if) it's going to
    change. An interesting way to start off an album, it shows a lot of confidence
    and respect for the listener to put possibly the most abrasive thing right up
    front.</p><p>
    
    Next comes a spoken word piece about a klepto monkey that will turn away most
    of the people not already turned off by the opening track.  Maybe a little too
    goofy.  But Need New Body are just starting up, and it seems as though the band
    purposely tries to set up a really high threshold as a means to weed out those
    not in for the long haul.  After a few listens, all these parts make sense, but
    if you're not willing to put in the effort, forget it. (Incidentally, this is
    what's wrong with so much music: it doesn't expect anything from the listener;
    it just wants you to sit back and be anesthetized, er, I mean entertained.) This
    album <i>knows</i> it's good, and if you can't see that, it doesn't need you.</p><p>
    
    Need New Body have embarked on an ambitious and mostly successful 22-track mission
    to combine Krautrock with electronic, bicycle/junk-shop noise, banjo-led folk,
    vaudeville, Gamelan, traditional Vietnamese, and cheerleader chants in a way that
    defies much description. (It depends a lot on what you, the listener, bring to the
    table.)  The resulting album is at once placeless and distinct, everywhere and
    singular.  It's reassuring that someone has found a way to explore all routes and
    find similarities between them without reducing everything to the lowest common
    denominator.</p></div>"|5733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5733-need-new-body/|8.4|Jason Nickey

    class junior year. The first law of thermodynamics states that, in a closed
    system, the total energy, including heat, is conserved.  The second law states
    that heat flows spontaneously from a hot body to a cool one, that one cannot
    convert heat completely into useful work, and that every isolated system becomes
    disorder with time. I stopped doodling long enough to copy these laws into a free
    corner of my notebook. 8th and 9th period ruminations didn't make the second law
    any more comfortable, so I went home and cried.  Really.</p><p>
    Loscil is both the basic unit that Csound software uses to build a sampling
    synthesizer, and the pseudonym that Canadian sound designer Scott Morgan performs
    and records under when he's not drumming for Dan Bejar's Destroyer. I can only
    assume that Morgan, who has been active in the Vancouver music and new-media
    scene for some time, has put more than a few loscils to use; possibly even some
    loscil3's, which use fancy cubic interpolation schemes.</p><p>
<i>Triple Point</i>, Loscil's debut record was titled for the point when the
    vapor, liquid, and solid phases of a material are all in equilibrium.  And as it
    so happens, it's an ambient dub concept album about thermodynamics, created with
    samplers, synths, and a Powerbook.  Sure, the idea has some potential, since
    the dark promise of thermodynamics' second law can bolster nihilism and elicit a
    very strong emotional response from humans, but the odds aren't on the side of
    success.  After all, most people don't know much-- if anything-- about
    thermodynamics, and this combination can quickly equal bad art. Bard College
    might give 2\xBD credits for interpretive dances inspired by ""Fuel Exergy,"" but
    that doesn't mean you want to listen to its audio counterpart on the way to
    work in the morning.</p><p>
<i>Triple Point</i> begins where the periodic table does: the opening track is
    titled ""Hydrogen."" The song starts with a muted beat under a looped two-note
    synth melody, and then neatly adds elements to this base one at a time. It
    sounds more like Bergheim 34 at half-speed or Aphex Twin than any primary
    component of the universe to me, but somehow, the music seems like it might be
    anticipating something.</p><p>
    It anticipates more of the same.  The second track, ""Ampere,"" begins with the
    exact same formula as ""Hydrogen.""  The drum machine starts with what sounds like
    a heart beating to a mutant rhythm, while the synthtone keeps the pacing of a
    respirator. While I wait for more sounds I hit the dictionary. ""An 'Ampere' is
    equal to a constant current which when maintained in two straight parallel
    conductors of infinite length and negligible circular sections...""  I notice a
    three-note melody of synth cello and a dance beat have been introduced. The last
    element to enter the song is clanking, irregular percussion.  For the first time
    so far on <i>Triple Point</i>, the metallic beat sounds like something that might
    have been played by a human instead of processed by a sequencer.  And though the
    sound is flatter and more contained than live drums, the excessively sterile
    quality of the rest of the record seems heightened when it drops out.</p><p>
    The next song, ""Pressure,"" is actually an IDM cover of that ridiculous Billy Joel
    number.  Oh!  That was just my imagination!  It's actually just spacy music that
    might lead one's mind to wander.  ""Pressure"" is sparse, and filled with ""pssst""
    noises that leak out with every long slow synth tone. At this point in the record,
    it becomes clear that <i>Triple Point</i> is less a musical interpretation of
    thermodynamics-- or a response to the implications of thermodynamics that some
    might find sad or frightening-- and more a recording of what these processes
    might sound like if they were closely miked. Morgan's digital dubs add detail
    to loops as they build throughout the songs, thus creating the impression of
    ""listening in closer"" to hear small bubbles popping and delicate echoes pulsating.</p><p>
    ""Vapour"" is <i>Triple Point</i>'s haunted house. A sharp intake of air trails
    each programmed gong tone. The low ring shifts pitch as swarms of sound swing in
    and out. A ping-pong ball bounces once and then dribbles off. If the song was
    longer, the looped ping-pong ball would quickly become the aural equivalent of
    Chinese water torture. It brings to mind the work of electro-acoustic tape artist
    Francis Dhomont, who used samples like balls, chains, and gears almost
    cinematically to create spaces.  While Loscil's work is based in rhythm and
    meditation unlike Dhomont's free compositions, the dampened beat and sterile
    synths he repeatedly uses on <i>Triple Point</i> could use some of Dhomont's
    creaks, cranks and flutters.</p><p>
    The concepts of thermodynamics are difficult to express in writing, music or art.
    Entropy and heat death are famous for being misused in tacky metaphors to explain
    chaotic social dynamics, atonal music, and relationships in need of therapy.
    Thomas Pynchon gave it a shot in his early story, ""Entropy,"" but now is very
    critical of the piece.  He's since written that the concept was so forced that
    the characters themselves were shortchanged.  His advice to others is, ""Get too
    conceptual, too cute and remote, and your characters die on the page.""  <i>Triple
    Point</i> might be inspired by thermodynamics, but Loscil's attempts to
    communicate these ideas through sound are forced.  Sure, the placement and timing
    of the samples is finessed-- Morgan has a clear talent for arranging sound-- but
    after ten tracks, the muted beats and droning synths just sound dead.  But then
    again, the ""triple point"" of a material marks a moment of stasis.  So that might
    all be part of his plan.</p></div>"|4866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4866-triple-point/|6.9|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    -LeRoi Jones, ""Black Art""</p><p>
    
    April 23rd, 1967. John Coltrane appears for his penultimate public performance
    before a crowd at Babatunde Olatunji's Center for African Culture in New York
    City. Three months later, liver cancer would claim his life.  He would play
    once more in front of a live crowd, but the last available live recording is
    documented here.  On this set, he's bolstered by drummer Rashied Ali, bassist
    Jimmy Garrison, pianist Alice Coltrane, Pharaoh Sanders on tenor sax and Algie
    Dewitt on bata drum (a Yoruba instrument).  For legions of jazz aficionados
    around the globe, this final live document is something of a Holy Grail. And
    now, thanks to sound engineer Bernard Drayton (who still had possession of the
    master tapes), anyone with $15 can finally get their mitts on one of the most
    historic documents in all of 20th century American music.</p><p>
    
    Coltrane spent the last years of his life engaged in a mission that few could
    understand.  As witnessed on <i>A Love Supreme</i> and other recordings during
    those later years, his ultimate objective was that of a continued spiritual
    awakening.  Whereas the objective itself was not that difficult to grasp,
    Coltrane's means of attaining it were far from conventional. Abandoning the
    preconceived notions of tonality, and immersed within a musical state of
    dissonance, Coltrane's music became a communicative attempt at reaching a higher
    plane.</p><p>
    
    Spawned during one of the most tumultuous eras in history, Coltrane's ideas were
    reflective of a period in which the foundations of American life trembled to the
    core.  Influenced by the nation's entrenchment in war, its social and political
    upheavals, and its civil rights and protest movements, John's music deserted
    almost any semblance of traditional form in a move toward celestial harmony and
    universality. In the early months of 1967, faced not just with the chaos of
    society, Coltrane waged his own personal war with death and his music again
    shifted. What's documented here is that personal warfare, replete with bursting
    explosions and a splattering of machine-gun notes.</p><p>
    
    No sooner than Billy Taylor can introduce John as ""one of the most remarkable
    forces in jazz today,"" Coltrane comes up front and center on ""Ogunde,"" opening
    the set with a warm, bluesy moan. But this is only temporary. Almost immediately,
    the rest of the band in tow, Coltrane embarks on a trans-dimensional flight,
    bleating and coaxing sounds from his sax, and escalating at a fever pace to the
    highest register with guttural whoops and hollers. ""Ogunde,"" based on the
    Afro-Brazilian song ""Ogunde Varere,"" is an almost thirty-minute wall of
    dissonance, peppered with shrieks and howls. It's as if Coltrane is expending
    every imaginable source of personal energy here to create a swirling maelstrom
    of noise.</p><p>
    
    Coltrane and Sanders swap solos: John rips out with a weeping wail before
    ascending into a full-blown shriek attack; Pharoah begins playfully, reeling off
    a fiery solo, dancing around a theme, and then descending into a grunt-filled
    rage.  Ali focuses on polyrhythms and spacial dancing, consistently adding
    dimensions and crossing barriers, taking the band into something otherworldly,
    while Garrison's bass remains muscular, anchoring the sound and expanding the
    framework. Alice Coltrane's percussive plonks and thuds drift in and out of
    the background before she rolls out her own deft solo, scrambling around the
    melody and filling the space rapidly with sixteenth notes while the saxophonists
    quietly wait for their scorching return. Soon, Coltrane roars back in, the band
    following on his comet's tail.  Coltrane and Sanders successively spit out
    anguished yelps while the band soars into wraithlike dimensions, teetering on
    the precipice of a volcanic eruption.  From here, the track remains full-throttle
    until it ends with Coltrane and Sanders invoking the spiritual via an ecstatic
    rite of fire.</p><p>
    
    After Coltrane humbly gives his thanks to the elated audience, Jimmy Garrison
    steps into the spotlight for a lengthy bass solo that introduces Rodgers and
    Hammerstein's ""My Favorite Things.""  A staple of Coltrane's set since the early
    60s, ""My Favorite Things"" had now morphed from <i>The Sound of Music</i>'s simple
    innocence into something altogether beastly and monstrous. Garrison flexes his
    chops for well over seven minutes with brawn and grit, piecing together a
    skeletal structure and beating the path for the others' departure into unknown
    terrain.</p><p>
    
    What follows is music overflowing with such emotional and spiritual intensity
    that it floods your living room.  Coltrane's bleats and squeals are drenched with
    a searing pain. It's like the sound of rending flesh, the tune ripped apart and
    broken into sorrowful hollers and moans. With the band thundering behind them,
    the two sax players are intent on dousing every inch of that NYC block with their
    incendiary fury. Explosions, barking yawps, shrill high-register runs, and throaty,
    rasping groans-- the place sounds like it's going to spontaneously combust.
    Occasionally, there's slight recognition of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein theme as
    Coltrane references the motif before descending into death howls and mournful
    prayer.  If ""Ogunde"" was a full-throttled blare, ""My Favorite Things"" clambers
    rapidly out of this realm and into permanent celestial gravitation. Coltrane
    maintains velocity at this pace for nearly twenty minutes, caught in a firestorm
    from which no one will walk away unscathed.</p><p>
    
    For every intent and purpose, this is difficult music.  It's the demanding sound
    of a man faced with impending death, yet unafraid to carry forward and remain
    steadfast to his intense, singular vision of music as a universal bridge. With
    every note, Coltrane chases a higher power in an attempt to transcend the
    corporeal.  For the unprepared listener, it might all be too much-- not only
    because of the sheer intensity of noise levels or dissonance, but because this
    is the sound of a man who knows every breath he draws inches him one step closer
    to the grave. Yet, the sadness this evokes is overwhelmed by the pure beauty of
    a man being rebirthed, recreated, and reimagined.  <i>The Last Live Recording</i>
    is a deliriously scattered mess of joy and pain, intermingled and bound up within
    Coltrane's unbridled and luminescent energy.  And now it stands as his parting
    gesture: one last moment bursting out at the seams with elation and ferocity, an
    awe-inspiring testament to life.</p></div>"|1550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1550-the-olatunji-concert-the-last-live-recording/|10.0|Luke Buckman

    the music"" tip, the first <i>Funky Precedent</i> record was dope as hell. The
    best track Jurassic 5's ever done, Dilated People's still-amazing ""Triple
    Optics,"" a shockingly enjoyable Ugly Duckling cut, and solid shit from Divine
    Styler, Acey, and Abstract Rude made for the greatest-ever underground comp
    out of L.A that didn't rock the Beat Junkies logo on the cover. So now it's
    all out with the second volume.  The charity-jocking No Mayo label has sold out
    to Matador, inexplicably replacing all the big names of the first compilation
    with some mostly unheard-of cats they're hoping will blow up and make this
    move more units than Nelly (all for the schools!). Here's your track-by-track:</p><p>
    
    1) Skhool Yard: ""Here We Come"" - Better than it had to be, although these guys
    really shouldn't have let Protest out from behind the boards. Why do all new MCs
    sound like Planet Asia? Is it because he's just so nice?</p><p>
    
    2) Rasco: ""Uncut"" - It's not another ""Unassisted"" (what is?) but it's still
    nice in that Rasco bump-bump way. ""Front page like I was George W. Bush."" Fuck
    yeah.</p><p>
    
    3) Live Human: ""Lagoona's Bliss (Elephant Mix)"" - Yeah, I had this track on
    their album and it was okay, but I'm feeling this remix a lot more.  DJ Logic,
    hold ya dome.</p><p>
    
    4) Azeem: ""Contradictions"" - Motherfuck Green Day, why do all the poetically
    inclined MCs always listen to worst white-people music? That said, the production
    on this isn't bad and the lyrics are passable. I like that tropic of cancer bit.</p><p>
    
    5) Zion I: ""We Got It"" - North Cali mix-show fodder, if he's lucky.</p><p>
    
    6) Foreign Legion: ""Bike Thief"" - Maybe I'm crazy, but this is dope. The
    pre-teen ""steal shit"" lyrics are cuter than Kris Kross and the beat makes me
    jump up and down. I like it.</p><p>
    
    7) Eye Cue and Rashinel: ""Clear the Slate"" - Mediocre until the beat changes
    up halfway through and then it's boom-bap brassy goodness like a nasty Pete Rock
    track. ""Incredulous is incredible, and I'm awestruck/ Can't you tell because of
    the presence of dumb-fuck?"" Um, yes?</p><p>
    
    8) Anticon: ""Pity Party People"" - Formula for massively pleasurable yet
    ultimately forgettable Anticon posse cut: put some De La on the intro, grab a
    shimmery loop out of big Anticon bag of circular guitar samples, have no mic
    skills, be white as fuck. And it's beautiful!</p><p>
    
    9) DJ Vinroc: ""3thahardway"" - Very possibly the least interesting scratch track
    to come out the bay area since ""Drop the Weight,"" and that's saying something.</p><p>
    
    10) Stymie and the Pimp Jones Love Orchestra: ""Fan Club"" - Shit club.</p><p>
    
    11) Encore: ""The Movement (Precedent Mix)"" - Architect is an underrated producer
    but he's still just biting Primo circa <i>Hard to Earn</i>. It's hard to make
    jazz licks propel Encore's flow instead of riding under it, but somehow it
    works.</p><p>
    
    12) Kemetic Suns: ""We a Warrior"" - Promising opening lines about bucking down
    demons and vampires, but what a drab chorus. Silly suckas.</p><p>
    
    13) EB F: ""Condiments"" - If you can listen to this twice, you're on more West Coast
    dick than Mack 10.</p><p>
    
    14) Sahnuhtayshun Duhpartment Muzik f/Khaos Unique: ""I'm K.U."" - That's a bitch
    of a name but this really isn't bad, and Del guest-mumbles on it too (uncredited,
    of course). I bet this would sound nice on an O-Dub tape.</p><p>
    
    15) Pep Love: ""Warrior Poet"" - Least interesting Hiero member goes out and rips
    it!  Tinkly keys and loping cello sound like the beats Mathematics gave GZA for
    that last album. Not bad, not bad at all.</p><p>
    
    So there you go.  It won't get much love up in the clubs but there's a few cuts
    worth your half-hearted spin. If you can't cop the Rasco and Foreign Legion
    joints off Audiogalaxy then you might want to pick up the $5 promo now sitting
    at an indie used bin near you and dance around in your underwear til volume
    three drops, hopefully with no fake-ass funk and more of those hot singles that
    we know the left coast underground can do so well. It won't ""plant the seeds for
    educating the next generation musically"" (like Erick Arnold says in the
    self-important liner notes, bigging-up the rap game like the poor man's Chuck D).
    But we can leave that responsibility safe with ODB, can't we?</p></div>"|1926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1926-the-funky-precedent-vol-2/|6.5|Ethan P.

    difficult to play.  People suspect that post-My Bloody Valentine shoegaze is
    more about shopping than musicianship, in that the skill lies in knowing which
    pedals to buy. Hell, guitar feedback in its most elemental form doesn't even
    require the player to, well, <i>move</i>, if you get right down to it. It's not
    a coincidence that the metaphors typically deployed for this kind of music are
    passive-- things like drifting, gliding and floating.</p><p>
    But Sonic Youth's enigmatic <i>Silver Sessions</i> taught us that overdriven
    guitars tend to make an unholy racket when left to their own devices.  Turning
    feedback into something the man on the street can call beautiful requires careful
    manipulation of the never-ending electromagnetic stream. Notice that the
    seemingly passive verbs used above to describe shoegaze imply a subtle
    interaction with natural elements like water and wind. Movement here is a
    matter of channeling the base-level forces in a desired direction. I've always
    suspected that this had something to do with why Flying Saucer Attack was
    labeled as ""rural psychedelia""; David Pearce has spent his musical life dirtying
    his hands in distortion's black earth.</p><p>
    Connecticut's Landing inhabits that amorphous space where time itself expands
    and contracts according to a delay pedal setting, and dream pop blurs into dream
    proper. Groups like Stars of the Lid and E.A.R. have wandered this same misty
    plane in search of the perfect drone, but Landing incorporates Bardo Pond's jam
    aesthetic into the journey, imparting a welcome communal feel to their lengthy,
    meandering compositions. Landing's effects-heavy guitar sound will not seem new
    unless you've been trapped under something heavy since 1992, but on <i>Oceanless</i>,
    they give convincing demonstration of why it has endured.</p><p>
    The title of their second full-length has to be a joke, considering many guitar
    lines seem like heavily processed, six-string interpretations of whale songs.
    Like Windy and Carl's <i>Depths</i> (Landing have done a split record with the
    pride of Dearborn), these pieces unfold many fathoms down, in the slow motion
    required by immense pressure, allowing each ripple of sound to be examined in
    detail. Its six songs total more than an hour, and two of them stretch past the
    20-minute mark. Possibly because the pieces never strive to be proper ""songs""
    (a couple of whispers aside, it's an instrumental album), they never seem overly
    long, and most develop nicely from faint drones to epic crescendos and back
    again.</p><p>
    This flair for drama is best exhibited on ""Are You Gone to Vast Arc Hues?,"" a
    live piece recorded in a Provo, Utah coffeeshop (near where the band was
    formerly based).  The opening drone whines like a siren, and then a melodic
    bass inspired by Galaxie 500 folds in, followed by an elongated implosion of
    guitar feedback. As the piece builds, the loose drumming becomes a key element,
    lending a slightly unpredictable pulse (another Galaxie 500 pointer?) that fits
    with the barely controlled howl. Around the ten-minute mark, the piece hits a
    long patch of pure shoegaze bliss, as overtones cluster and multiply like
    bacteria in a petri dish, and a dense fog of pure pink noise threatens. The
    song fades out slowly over several minutes, as the voices of the café eventually
    reclaim the space.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, <i>Oceanless</i> hearken back to the more restrained, earthy sounds
    of earlier Landing records like the <i>Centrefuge</i> EP. ""Structure vs. Chaos""
    is an exercise in reverb and delay, as twin guitars serve mainly to set a variety
    of echoes in motion, and the resultant melodies seem both accidental and quite
    beautiful. ""How Did You Feel?"" represents the dark end of Landing's expression,
    with a sinister bassline reminiscent of Joy Division's ""Transmission"" (because
    of the tempo, it reminds me a lot of Low's cover), harsh guitar drones, and
    buried vocals that never approach comprehension. This black moment is the
    exception. Through most of <i>Oceanless</i>, I feel the ascension of the best
    drone music, the blissful high that comes from slowly converting force into
    movement.</p></div>"|4671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4671-oceanless/|8.0|Mark Richard-San

    get.</p><p>
    
    It's been too long since the last Silver Jews album.  The wait is almost over,
    with a new one is due next month, but in the meantime, the debut from the
    National provides a decent appetizer. I hate to be so condescending, and reduce
    a band to simply being a primer for another band, but they had it coming. From
    first listen, it's pretty clear the National are going for the same elegantly
    wasted view of everyday American life captured so well by the Jews, from the
    solid, but unobtrusive musical backing that shifts focus onto the lyrical
    content, to the laid-back, just-more-then-slightly-inebriated delivery of singer
    Matt Berninger.</p><p>
    
    The only problem is, Berninger lacks Jews frontman D.C. Berman's ability to
    recreate life's mundane ephemera with striking and haltingly vivid imagery,
    as well as his gift for the kind of lyrical accent and emphasis that can make
    even bland statements seem revelatory.  But I guess it's a little unfair to
    blame them for not being someone else. Taken on their own terms, the National
    present solid, perfectly inoffensive adult rock. Like the stuff that sits
    between the radio hits on a Tom Petty album, it doesn't reach out and grab your
    attention, but it doesn't really send you running, either. It's just kinda there.</p><p>
    
    After listening to <i>The National</i> three times, I couldn't readily recall
    any interesting lyrical phrases or melodies, but a vague feeling of satisfaction
    hung on my mind like residue.  So I went back for fourths determined to find out
    why. What I found is that, if you want much out of this listening experience,
    you have to be determined enough to take a pick-axe to the frozen, nearly
    featureless surface that besets the album. So the question becomes: is the
    payoff worth the effort?</p><p>
    
    ""Beautiful Head"" starts the album off on a strong note, beginning with a sped-up
    Nick Drake-style acoustic guitar riff that picks up a driving beat before
    Berninger launches into a tale about seeing an ex-girl friend (or maybe a
    soon-to-be ex-girlfriend) at a party: ""You walk in taller than you should/ The
    air is thin around your beautiful head.../ Haven't looked at me forever/ You got
    a diagram of associations.""</p><p>
    
    The music of ""Cold Girl Fever"" is lifted directly from Springsteen's ""Your
    Hometown""-- that is, until the end when menacing synth is added to the mix and
    an almost inaudible backwards vocal track. It took time to add this effect, so
    it makes you wonder why they don't make it more noticeable, which in a way sums
    up the whole album: what would normally be tasteful subtleties are awash in a
    bath of tired, homogeneous arrangements.  Nothing gets stressed, just reduced to
    a forgettable sameness.</p><p>
    
    ""Son"" is a good example of this cover-up job. Hands down the best song on the
    album lyrically, and underpinned by a echo-y distant drum beat, lines like,
    ""She's reading books from empty women/ They're giving beauty tips from empty
    hips,"" and the very Berman-like, ""How is the water of the rain/ And how is the
    air of the wind,"" somehow become forgettable under a blanket of uninspiring,
    middle-of-the-road music.</p><p>
    
    They crank it up one notch for ""Pay for Me,"" which out-Son Volts Son Volt,
    sounding a bit like Tindersticks reinvented as an American roots-rock band. And
    for about three songs, they build some momentum with ""Bitters and Absolut,""
    ""John's Star,"" and ""Watching You Well,"" which play up Berninger's more soulful
    side, while staying firmly planted in Americana.</p><p>
    
    From a production standpoint, ""29 Years"" is the standout track, using a scratchy
    LP in-groove as a rhythm track while Berninger croons atop, ""You know I dreamed
    about you 29 years before I saw you."" Then he becomes disgusted with himself,
    drops the mic (audibly), and ends the song abruptly. It's the only time the
    National seem to let their guard down and reveal their personality.  The track,
    while clearly the high point of the album, is unfortunately followed by the
    droll album closer, ""Anna Freud,"" possibly the most forgettable track here.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, the National execute like session musicians: very pro but with a
    similar kind of facelessness.  Frontman Berninger hasn't found a distinct voice
    yet, in his singing or his lyrics, but I get the feeling he very well could
    someday soon. Until then, they just remind me of how much I want to hear the
    new Silver Jews album.</p></div>"|5717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5717-the-national/|6.6|Jason Nickey

I'm not talking about the
    buildings or the baseball teams or the median waistline, but the tone of their
    respective independent music scenes. The parallels are striking. A handful of
    influential labels in each town have supported artists making an effort to
    expand the boundaries of rock. Both have embraced recent developments in
    electronic music. Both have vibrant improv scenes with members teaming up in
    innumerable combinations to experiment. Montreal draws a bit more from film
    music, and Chicago makes good use of its German imports, but there are common
    threads, no question.</p><p>
    
    The Montreal/Chicago comparison occurred to me while listening to this album by
    Frankie Sparo; he's like the Canadian Califone.  His songs are painfully slow,
    and sung in a gruff, downcast voice.  They also draw upon the music traditions of
    the distant past (some folk and blues, even more vaudeville) and the technology
    of the future (there all sort of wonderfully processed sounds on <i>My Red
    Scare</i>) to offer a portrait of urban desolation and despair.</p><p>
    
    The production was the first thing that really got to me. Recorded at the
    now-legendary Hotel2Tango by some folks from Godspeed, Sparo surrounds his
    songs with some beautiful noise. To extend my earlier comparisons a bit further,
    the music sounds much more like a Brian Deck production than anything you might
    imagine from the Godspeed camp. The drums used to hold 55 gallons of oil,
    cymbals are bowed or left out altogether, and evocative noises of every stripe
    waft about in the cobwebbed rafters. The guitar ranges from the latter-day
    Crazy Horse snarl of ""Send for Me"" to the spare, lonesome 50s-style vibrato of
    the opening ""Bastard Heart.""</p><p>
    
    But there's one essential ingredient lacking from <i>My Red Scare</i>, and its
    absence is glaring: melody. Sparo goes so far in conjuring an effective mood
    that he forgets to craft tunes. As I said before, his song structure owes less
    to folk and blues and more to the bleak vaudeville so loved by Tom Waits in the
    80s. But the songs are so incredibly slow and the melodies so vague that Sparo's
    voice, which is interesting enough at first listen, loses its power. A word
    combination like ""feeling glamorous"" is sung as ""fee-ling glam-or-ous,"" and
    takes about five seconds to complete. Annoying, I'm sorry.  I can handle it with
    a band like Low because the melodies reveal their beauty with each new syllable,
    but songcraft doesn't seem to be a major priority for Sparo.</p><p>
    
    There are some exceptional moments, though. The aforementioned line comes from a
    track called ""Diminish Me New York"" that I imagine Sparo is getting some good
    mileage out of these days. Lines like, ""It's so hard to feel tall/ Everything
    is tall/ Magnificent New York"" are hard to hear now, but somehow, wrapped as
    they are in the spacious junkyard production, they're moving. ""The Loneliest
    Mademoiselle"" combines Sparo's reverberating guitar with some affecting layered
    violin work by Jessica Moss, and it achieves its poignant aim. But these moments
    where Sparo transcends the limitations of his songs don't come quite often
    enough, and <i>My Red Scare</i> remains an interesting artifact that never
    fascinates.</p></div>"|7402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7402-my-red-scare/|6.1|Mark Richard-San

It's a bitch.  Ascending mediocre bands to heights of unwarranted
    popularity, and smacking the truly great down to ""critics' pet"" status, hype
    has become a plague on any band hoping to achieve unbridled adoration among
    music elitists.  When the media hounds smell success and respond with their
    annual cry of ""saviors of rock and roll,"" disappointment is inevitable.  So
    it goes with the Strokes, a band that's seen enough publicity in 2001 to make
    bin Laden jealous.</p><p>
    
    Touted by the press as ""the forefathers of a bold new era in rock,"" ""the
    greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones"" and ""the second coming of the
    Velvet Underground,"" the Strokes have nowhere to go but out of style.  And the
    album only came out last week!  So why all the fanfare?  Are they really that
    good?  Of fucking course not.  There is no bold new era in rock; the Rolling
    Stones have yet to be contended with; and if there ever is a second coming of
    the Velvet Underground, they won't be doing second-rate imitations of Lou Reed.</p><p>
    
    The Strokes are not deities.  Nor are they ""brilliant,"" ""awe-inspiring,"" or
    ""genius.""  They're a rock band, plain and simple.  And if you go into this
    record expecting nothing more than that, you'll probably be pretty pleased.
    See, while I can't agree with the Strokes' messianic treatment, I'd be lying
    if I said I thought <i>Is This It</i> was anything other than a great rock
    record.</p><p>
    
    What's refreshing to me about the Strokes is that, in a musical climate where
    even the dirtiest garage bands can create the illusion of million-dollar studio
    techniques through sound filters on mom's Packard-Bell, the Strokes prefer to
    rock in the classic vein: no laser sounds, no ethereal reverb, no pre-programmed
    Aphex beats.  Their influences are so firmly rooted in the post-punk tradition
    that it's as if the last two decades had never occurred.  The same names are
    always dropped: the Velvet Underground, Television, the Stooges.  And while
    the Velvets are obviously a major source of inspiration, the Strokes' only
    similarity to Television and the Stooges is the confidence with which they
    play.</p><p>
    
    Frontman Julian Casablancas' vocals bear more than a passing resemblance to
    early Lou Reed, but where Reed seemed to accidentally dispense life-changing
    lyrics through a drugged drawl, Julian sings about the simple trivialities of
    big-city life with stark lucidity.  These songs revolve around frustrated
    relationships, never coming near to approaching anything that might resemble
    insight.  Yet, with Casablancas' self-assured, conversational delivery, and the
    almost primal energy of the four guys backing him, attention shifts from the
    simply present lyrics to the raging wall of melody these guys bang out like
    it's their lifeblood.</p><p>
    
    There's a hint of Britain's post-punk 70s in the Strokes' frenetic furor.  Bands
    like the Buzzcocks and Wire subscribed to a similar less-is-more production
    aesthetic, and seemed naturally adept at scribbling out instantly approachable
    melodies.  And like <i>Singles Going Steady</i> (and, to a lesser extent, <i>Pink
    Flag</i>), there's something in the Strokes' melodies that few other bands
    possess: they're immediate without pandering, relying on the instant gratification
    of solid, driving rhythms while maintaining strong but simple hooks that seem
    somehow familiar, yet wholly original.</p><p>
    
    Their production is stripped raw, and not terribly divergent from that of their
    band-of-the-moment contemporaries, the White Stripes.  But the difference between
    the two bands lies in their degrees of skill: the Stripes have an air of
    amateurishness that belies songwriter Jack White's obvious talents; the Strokes,
    even on their debut album, sound like experienced professionals for whom
    mastering the form seems only an album away.</p><p>
    
    ""The Modern Age"" stomps like a renegade elephant with bashed kickdrums and
    turbulent guitar riffs while Casablancas passionately reels off, ""Work hard and
    say it's easy/ Do it just to please me/ Tomorrow will be different/ So this is
    why I'm leaving,"" in an unsteady sing-speak that invokes all the right elements
    of a great rock leadman.  ""Last Nite"" quakes with growled vocals and bluesy,
    blustery distortion.  ""Hard to Explain"" eerily recalls the blissful pop of the
    Wrens' <i>Secaucus</i> with an unforgettable hook, distorted drumkits and
    fuzzed-out ride cymbals.</p><p>
    
    Of course, none of this changes the fact that <i>Is This It</i> lacks the
    creativity and unconventionality inherent in any of the all-time great rock
    bands they're so impulsively compared to.  Still, the Strokes have struck an
    incredible balance between the two extremes of rock music: sentimentality and
    listlessness.  Any sentimentality in these songs' lyrics is countered by
    Casablancas' self-reliant indifference, and his listless delivery is offset by
    the band's fervid attack.  Beyond that, it's hard to pinpoint what exactly it
    is about the Strokes that keeps me listening.  All I know is that it's not easy
    to come by, and I like it.  A lot.</p></div>"|7537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7537-is-this-it/|9.1|Ryan Schreiber

    science of evolution this year.  I find most interesting the metaphors that are
    drawn to give the students the best possible conception of evolution.  One
    example was used to illustrate the possibility that humans were created through
    a series of accidents.  Naysayers suggest that humans have as much chance of
    sprouting from evolution as a monkey has of rewriting Shakespeare's sonnets if
    armed with a barrel of letters that could be arranged in such an order.  My
    professor made the point that evolution works such that once one of the monkey's
    letters falls into the correct position, it sticks and eventually, the monkey
    has all of the sonnets. While the example sounds ridiculous, Simian's debut
    full-length works in much the same way. Please pardon the pun.</p><p>
<i>Chemistry Is What We Are</i> takes very disparate elements and flings them
    together.  Sometimes it sticks; sometimes it doesn't. ""Drop and Roll,"" the
    lead-in track, begins with a childlike vocal and an accordion playing a steady
    I-IV line (think circus march) before crashing in with ride-heavy drums and
    a set of voices singing in harmony. Organs reiterate the sinewy melody, and is
    accompanied by some lulling ""na-na-na's."" Things break down with some simple
    drum machine noises and lyrics about fire. And while this doesn't sound much
    like the Beta Band, there's an atmosphere that parallels the space-age
    pastiche of Simian's labelmates.</p><p>
    
    ""The Wisp"" lashes out with Aphex Twin-style synth pulses and a multitracked
    chorus spilling out four-part Beach Boys harmonies.  The song is sparse, but
    layered with effects like raygun fire and clanking glass.  Unfortunately, on
    this track, it tends to be more distracting than enhancing.</p><p>
    
    That's not to say that things aren't interesting in the world of Simian. Their
    fantastic lyrics demand dissection and the percussion heavy atmosphere anchors
    the sporadic noises.  Take the lyrics of ""One Dimension"": ""I see the world in
    one dimension/ I only see through my dementia.../ Feelings seem to run my mind/
    Clarity is bliss, but/ Chemistry is what we are.""  It's far from Blink 182's
    philosophies about love in ""All the Small Things.""</p><p>
    
    To further ground the disparity, the ghost of John Lennon plays a vital role in
    the songwriting of these four Manchester lads.  A majority of the tracks, if
    stripped of their studio playtime, would be revealed as very structurally simple
    songs, with infectious yet sometimes unconventional melodies.  ""Mr. Crow,"" one
    of the standouts here, seems to draw the most inspiration from Lennon, resembling
    some of his solo tracks with a standard, driving drum pattern, strummed acoustic
    guitar, and harpsichord synths along with those layered harmony vocals the band
    seems to hold so dear.</p><p>
    
    Simian records in a studio named Trial and Error-- the phrase isn't far off the
    mark in describing the musical extras of <i>Chemistry</i>. The performances are
    always energetic, but lack a sense of focus that could come with a premeditated
    plan for recording their music. The end product of this process delivers 50
    minutes of constant movement. Still, there are points at which calm would be a
    good thing.</p></div>"|7172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7172-chemistry-is-what-we-are/|7.7|Christopher F. Schiel

A 10-year-old boy creeps through the dimly-lit hallways
    of his house. He checks every room twice-- yes, mommy and daddy are still at
    the grocery store. He's all alone. He sneaks into the kitchen, and drags the
    stool from the corner of the room over to the kitchen table. Slowly, he
    climbs up onto it, then onto the table itself, trying as hard as he can not
    to knock anything over. He grabs his Mattel Superstar Microphone, and shouts
    at the top of his prepubescent lungs, ""This song is called... 'Poopy on the
    Potty of Professor Plum,' from the album <i>Little Puppy in My Front Yard</i>!
    One, two, three, four!""</p><p>
    
    Yes, it's always entertaining to think of little Robert Pollard shouting
    ridiculous song titles from atop his kitchen table. But it's also funny to
    think that, as he nears middle-age, Robert Pollard has a career standing in
    front of amorous crowds and saying, ""This song is called... 'Gold Star for
    Robot Boy,' from the album <i>Bee Thousand</i>! One, two, three, four!""
    Considering that Pollard was working away at excellent tunes like ""Weed King""
    before he even approached his teenage years, saying that Pollard never really
    grew up as a songwriter is sure as fucking hell not an insult. When I was
    that age, the best song I could come up with was called ""Mean Mole,"" about a
    mean mole who's ""Not like a genie/ He's a real meanie."" Even my 7-year-old
    peers thought it was pretty weak.</p><p>
    
    It's been said again and again that Pollard's more recent work has been
    indicative of a more mature type of songwriting. But while his lyrics and
    music certainly have taken a darker, more adult-oriented turn, Pollard still
    seems fascinated with living out his big rock fantasy. <i>Isolation Drills</i>,
    though more lyrically personal than any GBV record before it, still relied
    greatly on larger-than-life arena rock hooks, resulting in a pretty good rock
    record, but one that didn't much deliver in the way of conveying the
    introspective sadness expressed in its lyrics. <i>Choreographed Man of War</i>,
    played by Pollard, bassist Greg Demos, and Drummer Jim MacPherson (all of
    whom appeared on <i>Do the Collapse</i>), couples Pollard's newly discovered
    introspection with a more stripped-down, melodic sound. And the result could
    very well be Pollard's most promising solo record since <i>Waved Out</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""I Drove a Tank,"" a song which has become a staple at GBV shows, provides a
    shaky start for a surprisingly solid album. Opening with a riff that borrows
    the rhythm from the classic ""Postal Blowfish,"" the song shifts quickly into a
    hook that's perhaps the most blatantly Who-sounding moment ever to grace a
    Pollard LP. ""I Drove a Tank"" may actually have benefited greatly from the
    Schnapf treatment that was given to <i>Isolation Drills</i>, as the present
    version, with its meandering, sloppy mid-section, doesn't do the arena-sized
    hook justice.</p><p>
<i>Choreographed Man of War</i>'s first true standout comes with ""Edison's
    Memos,"" one of only two tracks on the album to break the four-minute mark,
    and one of the finest melancholy rock songs Pollard has ever written. With a
    gorgeous verse and brief, rocking chorus, ""Edison's Memos"" kicks off to a
    brilliant start, before degrading slightly with a gratuitously fuzzed-out
    bridge, and redeeming itself with the introduction of another awesome
    big-rock hook.</p><p>
    
    ""7th Level Shutdown,"" another excellent track, crystallizes the vague
    melancholy of ""Edison's Memos."" With its heart-wrenching chorus of, ""You
    wanted to be alone/ But I don't want you to be alone,"" ""7th Level Shutdown""
    is the most direct, beautifully reflective song Pollard has penned in ages.
    ""Aeriel"" is similarly gorgeous, excepting the two-minute instrumental
    introduction that makes the track rather hard to swallow.</p><p>
    
    On the more cheerful side of <i>Choreographed Man of War</i> is ""Kickboxer
    Lightning,"" a breezy rock tune with a feel similar to that of ""Drag Days""
    off <i>Under the Bushes Under the Stars</i>. GBV vet Greg Demos' melodic yet
    understated bass-playing helps make ""Kickboxer Lightning"" a seriously great
    rock song. The similarly rocking ""Bally Hoo"" begins somewhat awkwardly, but
    goes on to revisit the hook from ""I Drove a Tank"" with an added guitar hook
    big enough to make Pete Townshend notice.  And he's nearly deaf, you know.</p><p>
    
    As is the case with most GBV-related albums, <i>Choreographed Man of War</i>
    is not without its throwaways and failed experiments. But the record's
    significance seems to transcend the overall quality of the songs-- this is
    truly the first album in Bob Pollard's recent canon on which he seems willing
    to lay off of the crunchy riffage to let some genuine melodic beauty and
    emotion seep through. Perhaps he's finally learned that if you're hanging
    your head in sadness, you can't do a high-kick without kneeing yourself in
    the face.</p></div>"|6380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6380-choreographed-man-of-war/|7.4|Matt LeMay

The beautiful impossible super-wonderful 100% Tokyo new wave
    mutant Polysics. Enigmatic as they are, they've at least given us clues as to
    what they're listening to. Their website is named Neu! Their latest Japanese
    full-length is entitled <i>Eno</i>. The cover art of <i>Hey! Bob! My Friend!</i>--
    a scraped-up man popping through a serrated tin can hat-- is strikingly
    reminiscent of Frank Zappa's immortal <i>Weasels Ripped My Flesh</i>. They've
    been known to don matching plastic safety coveralls and industrial goggles for
    live performances, garnering incessant comparisons to their self-proclaimed
    gods, Devo. This junk drawer of band trivia provides a rough outline-- japanoise,
    grand synthetic fusion, electro-pop, propulsive motorik, and spastic digi-geek
    new wave.  Gradually, they're coming into focus.  So meet the Polysics.  They've
    come to make rock uncool again.  And they are unstoppable.</p><p>
    
    Originally founded as a quartet in March 1997, the Polysics (reduced to a trio
    shortly after their first album) have already released four albums, a handful
    of EPs, several live videos, a two-disc remix/live album, and scattered vinyls,
    and have also appeared on some half-dozen compilations. Rumor has it that their
    trademark hazard-orange ""P"" can be spotted all over Tokyo, and that their
    absolutely manic recording energy is merely a spill-off from their dangerously
    volatile shows.</p><p>
    
    Their first stateside release, <i>Hey! Bob! My Friend!</i>, is actually a
    compilation of material culled largely from their first two albums, but you'd
    never know it.  The entire record pulses with the same nervous energy: clinical
    lab-coat-and-clipboard sterility married to frenetic dork rage.  ""Sunnymaster""
    bleeps in with thin, icy drum-machine loops and demented video game melodies
    before exploding into pummeling guitar noise that's more easily likened to K.K.
    Null than anything that might, for a moment, be considered new wave.  This
    metallic assault lays the groundwork for the immediate ""Buggie Technicha,"" whose
    vocoded vocals sputter incomprehensibly over furious riffage, eventually
    resolving into some kind of metal-surf game show theme.</p><p>
    
    Zappa's ghost haunts these proceedings. At concerts, Zappa would cup both bands
    between his legs and make the ""big balls"" sign, signaling his band to change
    whatever they were playing into ludicrous heavy metal aggression; he'd twist
    an imaginary braid on the side of his head and they would shift on the fly into
    reggae.  That kind of stylistic schizophrenia dominates <i>Hey! Bob!</i>  Cool
    electro-pop becomes white-hot noise becomes sloppy, grinding no wave becomes
    logarithmic computer sequences. Like an atmosphere re-entry in some bad sci-fi
    movie, everything will be okay, as long as they can just hold it together.</p><p>
    
    The infectious ""Plus Chicker"" is jagged and punkish, yet dominated by Hiroyuki
    Hayashi's (aka POLY-1) loose, high-pitched vocals and Kayo's (aka POLY-3)
    squiggly synthesizers. ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Married to a Frenchman"" pay the most
    loving tribute to their idols in Devo-- not the quirky, clean, MTV-era Devo, but
    the brash, no wave-inflected Devo of the late 70s.  Beneath the sugary vocals
    and zipping electronic pops and squeaks lurk fierce percussion and edgy,
    distorted guitars cranking out measured belligerence. It dances but it bites.</p><p>
    
    And spaz is king. <i>Hey! Bob! My Friend!</i> simply flails, throbs and convulses
    with abandon, shifting from Boredoms to Falco and back again at will.  One isn't
    likely to find this kind of frenetic exuberance elsewhere this year.  <i>Hey!
    Bob!</i> sputters and chatters like a toy chest filled with spastic, plastic,
    blinking, bleeping robots, discharging missiles and spouting digitized
    catchphrases.  Sounds like fun, right?  It's as serious as a heart attack.</p></div>"|6397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6397-hey-bob-my-friend/|9.0|Brent S. Sirota

I just
    bought some nice zip-up knee-lengths myself, and now spend my days on the streets
    comparing them to those of other girls. Did I get the right pair, with buckles
    in just the right place?  Will they become spring fashion castaways?  Could all
    that money have gone to more superfluous records with which I could compare this
    album?  Probably not, 'cause I got 'em all: the Stooges, the Modern Lovers, the
    Velvet Underground (in their first wave), and all those second-generation
    rip-offs I wholeheartedly love, against my better judgment.</p><p>
    Vue appeared in the late 90s amidst the quote-unquote glam revival which you may
    recall as a media conspiracy centered around Ewan MacGregor's final stab at
    babeness, <i>Velvet Goldmine</i>.  At that time, the shoes were platforms
    (mid-calf and often more round at the tip, unless chased with mod, in which
    case, we went for the Beetle-boots). Vue's riding rigs were a bit more glittery
    back then-- their 1999 debut EP for Gold Standard Laboratories, <i>The Death of a
    Girl</i>, and their self-titled Sub Pop releases frequently garnered comparison
    to Pulp or Jonathan Fire*Eater.  Lots of people ate it up, but of course, the
    contrarian types at <i>Pitchfork</i> smelled a sequin-studded rat and slid both
    efforts into the pan.</p><p>
    Well, now's now and everybody like the Strokes, the White Stripes, et al. Detroit
    will save America with its big, bad rhythms and no one cares how contrived the
    lot is. Enter the new Vue album, a slam-damned, roots rockin', acoustic growlin'
    Jaggermonica explosion of the righteous past. But let's be honest here: all those
    words I just reeled off mean absolutely nothing.  That's the point. This is rock!</p><p>
    From the border-skipping ruse of ""Hitchhiking"" to ""Do You Think of Him Still?,""
    there's that heavy-handed sexuality, and that grotesque pout so associated with
    collagen-laden chic types and yesterday's real deal (ahh, glam again). These
    moments are certainly shameless, but nothing compared to ""People on the Stairs,""
    which shivers from its naked exposure as a cosmetically lifted ""Sister Ray.""</p><p>
    Still, they're pretty good at it.  Frontman Rex John Shelverton, a guy who must
    sleep in a proper little tie, appropriates Jagger in much the way Christian
    Slater copped Nicholson's trademarks.  It's locked in.  Distortion prevails,
    mixing keys and blues guitars in that perfect blend of mud to snazz.  It's so
    real I want to go up to it in a lobby and touch its leaves just to be sure, or
    scratch it along a window like a shady fiancée.  But I know, as far as anything
    goes, that the appearance of ""authenticity"" is a construct (any time spent
    reading about Lou Reed's supposedly beat life will tell you that) and perhaps
    all this tittering about sonic opportunism is just so much revisionist
    righteousness.  What?  I mean to say, this album rocks shamelessly in this
    autumn's boots and cares not.  That's just what they do.  I guess this makes me
    a contrarian's contrarian, or perhaps just another fashion victim.</p></div>"|8503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8503-find-your-home/|6.4|Daphne Carr

    machines coming to the fore of wishlists in the late 1800s as authors like H.G.
    Wells penned fantastic stories about scientists who'd perfected the ability to
    move freely from era to era with the aid of wondrous devices.  Today, scientists
    are legitimately discussing the possibly of travel in a fourth dimension, though
    the systems that seem possible are a lot less flexible.</p><p>
    
    One current project involves the idea that if you were to create a vortex of
    accelerated particles and step into it, you may be able to transport yourself
    back to the point at which the machine was turned on, essentially looping
    time back to the point of the device's creation.  I don't really know the
    physics involved (I read about it in the newspaper several months ago), but I
    do know that, while interesting theoretically, such a device would be useless
    on a practical level. Evidence is quickly suggesting that the geekiest among
    us may as well abandon their fantasies of scoring with eloy chicks by day and
    battling vicious morlocks by night.</p><p>
    
    Astoundingly, and in strict defiance of current science, it seems the Three 4
    Tens have somehow managed to procure a working flux capacitor.  And in a truly
    devious move, they've used it to travel to 1967 and steal the master tapes to
    the newly completed full-length of some poor, unsuspecting garage band.  Sure,
    their story-- that they formed in Philly in 1996 and released a seven-song EP
    and a couple seven-inches soon thereafter, and that this is their bona fide
    ""debut album""-- may sound convincing, but I don't buy it for a second.  This
    stuff just sounds way too authentic.</p><p>
    
    However, assuming that it really is a modern recording, it's the band's uncanny
    authenticity that saves <i>Change Is on Its Way</i> from simple-minded pastiche.
    There are a lot of 60s throwback records kicking around out there, but few evoke
    long, unwashed hair, a two-car garage, and a Dodge Challenger parked on the front
    lawn quite as well as this one.  The Three 4 Tens may not be from the 60s, but
    they fairly drip its essence.  It's as though they've never heard anything
    outside of the British Invasion and the <i>Nuggets</i> box-set, with the possible
    exception of a chance encounter with Beulah or the Essex Green.</p><p>
    
    Producer Paul Smith, who's also worked with Marah and Steve Earle in the past,
    even joins in, lending the band a sound extremely similar to that of a typical
    psych record you'd find reissued on Gear Fab and reviewed somewhere near the
    back of <i>Record Collector</i>.  Cheap organs, low-budget wah, and droning
    sitars ooze out of every available nook in the band's sound, providing an
    incredibly apt bed for the guys to lay their thick four-part harmonies down
    upon.</p><p>
    
    Even while reveling almost entirely in a bygone era, <i>Change Is on Its Way</i>
    isn't an unoriginal record.  It simply owes a crushing debt to another time that
    many simply won't be able to forgive.  For those who choose to take the ride,
    though, it's a pretty cool trip.  There are monster hooks hanging off virtually
    every track here, and you're guaranteed to have at least one of them roosting in
    your brain for a while after the disc stops spinning.</p><p>
    
    ""Right on Time"" ramrods its melody into your long-term memory with thudding
    tom-toms and bouncy basslines, trumping the Apples in Stereo at their own
    retro-fetish game.  The band steps a little further into the void with ""Ostinato
    Raga,"" a raging, swirling mantra beset by marauding guitars which swoop in from
    above like peregrine falcons honing in on their prey.  And it wouldn't be going
    too far out on a limb to assume that George is their favorite Beatle, given the
    omnipresence of droning textures on the album.</p><p>
    
    The band do Todd Rundgren and the Nazz proud with ""Little Dove,"" dropping an
    economical guitar solo into the middle of a soup of catchy harmonies and
    rampaging backbeats. ""A Red Shirt Today"" bears a certain similarity to the
    Olivia Tremor Control's ""Hilltop Procession"" (due mostly to the way the vocals
    are recorded), but the harpsichords in the verse clearly swim over from the
    Left Banke.  This gives way to the album's closer, the bizarre ""Bent Leg Chant,""
    a jaunty, discordant sea shanty.</p><p>
    
    In terms of execution, the Three 4 Tens seem to have used some pretty
    high-quality equipment to get themselves back in time, perhaps sharing an
    apparatus with similarly skilled borrowers the Essex Green.  But whereas the
    Essex Green tap the folk/hippie tree for their brand of transcendent nostalgia,
    the Three 4 Tens channel the spirit of the British Invasion through the swirling
    psychedelia of the Electric Prunes and the Chocolate Watchband to create some
    truly arresting music.  I haven't heard the trick pulled off this well since
    XTC released their Dukes of Stratosphear project in 1985.</p><p>
    
    Somewhere back in 1967, there's a band that just recorded a damn fine album,
    wondering where the hell their tapes went, oblivious to the fact that the sneaky
    bastards in the Three 4 Tens will one day release it under another name.  For
    their part, the Tens themselves can plunder the past all they want, and though
    it may never amount to anything innovative or truly essential, it'll sure as
    hell be enjoyable.</p></div>"|8031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8031-change-is-on-its-way/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    I know: put together an avant-garde section. Get me some freaky music. I want a
    section for all those weirdo hipster kids. Got it?  Groovilicious.</p><p>
    
    Me: [shrugs] Uh...</p><p>
    
    Owner: Oh, yeah.  Try and find something that sounds like somebody dug up a
    bunch of graves and started beating the skulls together. And then they take
    apart the skeleton and beat the skulls with the bones from the arms and legs.
    Amazing!</p><p>
    
    And so it began. I spent the next week circling titles in magazine reviews,
    scanning music guides, getting feedback from the customers who the owner had
    deemed ""a little out there,"" and going about this whole project in a state of
    bewilderment and confusion. I ended up putting together a list of 100 titles
    for the next order. Somewhere near the bottom was a band I'd heard mentioned a
    couple of times, always with a look of disgust on the person's face. I'd
    scribbled near the bottom, ""Sun City Girls - anything you can find,"" and faxed
    the list to our one-stop.</p><p>
    
    Friday came and the first shipment arrived.  A handful of titles from that order
    made it in with the next shipment, one of those being Sun City Girls' <i>Midnight
    Cowboys from Ipanema</i>. I ripped the shrinkwrap off and stuck it in the disc
    player. Unbeknownst to me at the time, I was listening to what was widely
    considered to be the worst release in the Girls' entire catalog. Still, I
    couldn't help laughing at the atrocious, sloppy covers of ""Fly by Night"" and
    ""Midnight at the Oasis."" More SCG titles steadily trickled into the store. No
    one bought them.  Except me.</p><p>
    
    Unleashed almost twenty years ago, the Sun City Girls have reveled in the role
    of trickster since the very beginning. Comprised of three members (brothers Rick
    and Alan Bishop, and Charles Gocher Jr.), the band is characterized most easily
    by their erratic impulsivity. In fact, the one element that has remained constant
    over the years is their unpredictability.  Sure, there have been recurring
    themes: a heavy bent of Middle-Eastern musical tradition and mysticism, demon
    and goddess obsession (Kali), extended improvisational freak-outs, dreadful
    covers of classic rock standards, infrequent live shows, audience baiting,
    attempts at breaking down the barriers between performance and art,
    late-60s-inspired jazz composition, and campfire psycho-babble storytelling.
    But any attempt at pigeonholing them to a specific genre remains futile.</p><p>
    
    One of America's most prolific and proficient underground bands, the Sun City
    Girls are a collector's nightmare. It's not just the sheer deluge of releases
    that has record fiends scouring the used bins; it's the limited availability.
    After a few initial releases on now-defunct Placebo Records, the band disappeared
    from public view and began to unfurl a mountain of cassette releases (sold
    exclusively at shows or via mail-order) under the tag Cloaven Radio. Resurfacing
    in 1990 with the vastly underrated <i>Torch of the Mystics</i>, Sun City Girls
    slowly built a cult following over the subsequent decade.</p><p>
    
    Despite a few scattershot live appearances, an ever-expanding catalog, and
    extensive global traveling, the band has spent the last ten years languishing
    in relative obscurity.  Nevertheless, they've maintained, for all intents and
    purposes, a fairly high profile recently. In what's purported to be a neverending
    series of releases, the Bishop &amp; Gocher Girls have (over a 24-month span) begun
    to flood stores with a string of albums under the guise of <i>Carnival Folklore
    Resurrection</i>, each limited to 1000 copies on the band's own Abduction label.
    And with eight installations so far, the series shows no signs of slowing down.</p><p>
    
    One of the most recent, <i>Libyan Dream</i>, is a perfect example of the band's
    ability to cover vastly different musical territories, often within the timeframe
    of just one track. The seventh disc in the series begins with a burst of brutal
    guitar and drum buzz as they cover Amboy Dukes' ""Journey to the Center of the
    Mind"" for the second time in their career.  Busting out with trashy guitar solos
    and the brothers' dueling vocals, it's a raunchy, shameless update of Nugent's
    original. What follows is a run of tracks encompassing familiar territory for
    Sun City Girls fans: squealing garage guitar, sprawling, drugged-out instrumentals,
    frenetic Middle-Eastern fuzz, an update of ""The Vinegar Stroke"" from <i>Torch of
    the Mystics</i>, and a few improvisational takes.</p><p>
    
    ""Instantaneous Decisions"" begins with what sounds like Middle-Eastern hillbillies
    chanting over Gocher's endearingly messy drumming, but then unfolds into an
    angular, jagged display of bass and guitar. Each sudden burst of noise is
    followed by a series of nonsense squawks and yells from the band members. At
    times, the track falls apart at the seams; at others, Gocher and Rick Bishop
    maintain a stunningly open dialogue between guitar and drums. Most of the album,
    excepting the Amboy Dukes' update and an ode to opium, is instrumental, and it's
    an astonishing display of the Girls' musical adeptness.</p><p>
    
    ""Sangkala Suite"" is a stunning, seven-plus-minute reworking of a traditional
    Middle Eastern tune that incredibly begins with a riff that sounds lifted by
    Dean Ween for ""Mr. Would You Please Help My Pony?"" Filled with the transcendent
    play and musical banter of a band that sounds truly enamored with the music
    they're making, it's a staggeringly beautiful piece. Unlike many of the other
    compositions and noise workouts here, ""Sangkala"" comes close to being, dare I
    say, inviting.  What follows are two short tracks-- the acoustic ""Tavoy Salon""
    and the hyper-charged Eastern blowup ""Opium Den""-- and the amazing, Rick Bishop
    opus ""Libyan Dream."" Clocking in at almost fifteen minutes, it's a forum for
    Bishop's skills. Incorporating styles from across the globe and referencing
    everything from flamenco to rock to raga, Bishop proves that, contrary to what
    some have said, the Sun City Girls are no joke.</p><p>
    
    Dismissed for years as a noise outfit, a novelty, and a band incapable of playing
    their instruments, the elusive girls from Sun City remain surrealist masters of
    disguise. A career that spans nearly two decades is testament to their ferocious
    and uncompromising nature. They've done it all, from puerile pranks (<i>Midnight
    Cowboys from Ipanema</i>) to politically charged rants (<i>Horse Cock Phephner</i>)
    to campfire hillbilly freakouts (<i>Jack's Creek</i>). <i>Carnival Folklore
    Resurrection</i> may be an attempt to clean house and empty the vaults, but if
    this is the bottom of the barrel, the Girls have got me hooked. As the Nuge said
    so well in ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"": ""Come along if you can, come
    along if you dare...""  See you in the ticket line.</p></div>"|7568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7568-carnival-folklore-resurrection-7-libyan-dream/|7.4|Luke Buckman

    and a half years eating, six months on the toilet, and twelve years watching TV.
    We'll grow an average of two meters of nasal hair, kiss for two full weeks, and
    blink 415 million times.  These are just a few of the various facts of life
    proffered in Black Box Recorder's video for ""The Facts of Life,"" one of four
    included on the multimedia portion of <i>The Worst of Black Box Recorder</i>.</p><p>
    
    Consider those facts for a second.  Over the course of a lifetime, that's a lot
    of television, and not a whole lot of kissing.  It's enough to make you want to
    skip those 3:00 a.m. reruns of ""Dear John"" and give someone close to you a quick
    peck to set things right.  The members of Black Box Recorder-- Ex-Auteur Luke
    Haines, former Jesus and Mary Chain drummer John Moore, and vocalist Sarah Nixey--
    seem to have mundanities like this on their minds a lot, taking the state of
    modern life and weaving it into a manifesto of wry observations and stinging
    commentary.</p><p>
    
    You can almost consider their songs to be the black box recording of our decadent,
    materialistic society's final moments, before our engines fail and we crash into
    a churning sea of revolution (or, at least, recession).  Considering that most of
    these songs were written a few years ago, it's amazing how well Luke Haines'
    pre-millennial tension translates to the changed world we've been living in for
    the past month.</p><p>
<i>The Worst of Black Box Recorder</i> opens with a gleeful, airy romp through
    Jacques Brel's ""Seasons in the Sun"" (originally a bonus track from the U.S.
    edition of their debut, 1998's <i>England Made Me</i>), which essentially sums
    up the band's output with its sunny melody and absolutely morbid lyrics.  The
    sound is totally straight-faced, yet you can picture the band cracking a smile
    at their own gallows humor as Nixey's ultra-femme voice caresses the simple
    arrangement.</p><p>
    
    Initially, I questioned the appropriateness of Black Box Recorder releasing a
    b-sides compilation after only two albums, but <i>The Worst Of</i> proves itself
    largely worthy over the course of its twelve tracks.  It's definitely the trio's
    most varied release, and it serves as a decent introduction to their discography.
    U.S. fans might have reservations, though, as anyone who owns the domestic
    versions of their two proper albums already owns six of these songs.</p><p>
    
    Still, it's nice to hear some of the band's grittier moments after last year's
    incredibly smooth <i>The Facts of Life</i>, which occasionally steered a little
    too close to adult contemporary territory for my ears.  The majority of this
    disc, on the other hand, is uptempo, and actually feels a little more designed
    for a mass audience than some of the band's a-sides.  ""Lord Lucan is Missing""
    and ""Start as You Mean to Go On"" possess the crunch of some of Haines' louder
    work with the Auteurs, like <i>After Murder Park</i>'s ""Light Aircraft on Fire""
    and ""Lenny Valentino"" from <i>Now I'm a Cowboy</i>.</p><p>
    
    The off-kilter guitar figures of ""Watch the Angel, Not the Wire"" offset Nixey's
    sing-song vocals nicely as she expounds upon perception and free will.  Another
    highlight is ""Brutality,"" a catchy, sugary-sweet tune lamenting the passage of
    ""doing the decent thing,"" and drinking and driving with equal reverence. Theremins
    whistle countermelodies in the background as palm-muted guitars nudge the rhythm
    along, interlocking with multi-layered analog synths, creating a song that's both
    gleefully subversive and eminently hummable.</p><p>
    
    ""The Facts of Life,"" as remixed by Chocolate Layers (aka Jarvis Cocker and Steve
    Mackey from Pulp), is imbued with the icy chill that graced Pulp's ""Seductive
    Barry,"" while adding samples of children offering their theories on where babies
    come from, and the same masturbation instruction tape that Italy's Valvola
    sampled for ""Flashing Light.""  ""You have to sit for a few minutes while the
    doctors phone up for the babies,"" says one little girl, hesitantly, before a
    seductive female voice coos about synching your body's reactions to obtain a
    perfect orgasm.  Otherwise, the song is kept largely intact, and the remix
    actually improves a great deal upon the original.</p><p>
    
    As previously mentioned, the multimedia portion of the disc tacks on four videos,
    the most noteworthy of which is, far and away, the aforementioned spot for ""The
    Facts of Life.""  Along with the flashed statistics, it features Nixey as a school
    teacher with a penchant for form-fitting skirts, and two private school kids
    doing themselves up to the hilt in front of mirrors, only to walk right by each
    other at the end.  The video for ""England Made Me"" gets the title of Most
    Disturbing, with Nixey's face appearing on dozens of bodies a la Richard D.
    James.  (Well, it's not quite that disturbing, but it comes close.)</p><p>
    
    So, thankfully, <i>The Worst of Black Box Recorder</i> turns out to be quite a
    misnomer.  It's a good starting point for the uninitiated, and UK fans who held
    off on buying the singles will find it extremely rewarding.  On the other hand,
    if you already own six of these songs, it's up to you to decide whether or not
    you're that much of a completist.  Either way, <i>The Worst of Black Box Recorder</i>
    is a solid disc that showcases the band's range better than either of their
    albums, and a great soundtrack to have going while you're growing all that nasal
    hair.</p></div>"|740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/740-the-worst-of/|7.3|Joe Tangari

This is the eternal question for people
    like me, posting their supposedly well thought-out pontifications for anyone with
    a computer and an Internet connection to read.  The issue of being able to
    distinguish what's good from what isn't seems like a job ill-suited for anyone
    who doesn't have the power of omniscience, or at least a good track record with
    uncovering genius.  And yet, this is a request made by artists all the time--
    that of acceptance, or some kind of recognition of what they've produced.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's not really a matter of taste, but closer to keen perception and
    foresight.  But while some folks may pride themselves in their ability to find
    interesting art, it takes popular consensus to brand a piece or work ""great"" or
    ""revolutionary.""  Herein lies the dilemma: if you aren't able to recognize the
    inherent greatness of a particular piece of art, how can you appreciate any art
    at all?  Or, if you do think you see genius somewhere, how do you communicate
    this to somebody else?  These are the kinds of questions I have for the audience
    assembled for the Miles Davis Quintet performance at the Fillmore East in New
    York City on March 7th, 1970.</p><p>
<i>Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970): It's About That Time</i> is the
    official release of an oft-bootlegged performance of Davis' ""lost quintet.""
    His cohorts were Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette
    and Airto Moreira.  Not a bad lineup for a band that never existed, save a
    few fiery performances in 1969 and 1970.  In fact, at the time, the status
    of Davis' proper quintet (featuring Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Tony Williams
    and Shorter) was a little hazy.  Williams had left to run his own show with
    Lifetime, but Hancock and Carter would continue to play with the trumpeter on
    and off for a couple of years.  Also, the issue of the new quintet actually
    being a sextet added to the confusion of just who, exactly, was a part of Davis'
    band.</p><p>
    
    One other oddity confronted the lucky few who were able to witness these guys
    live: almost all the music being played was unreleased, and unlike anything ever
    produced by jazz musicians.  Most of the tunes performed at this Fillmore date
    (not to be confused with another release, <i>Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at
    the Fillmore East</i>, recorded in June of the same year) were from the landmark
    <i>Bitches Brew</i> LP.  Although <i>Bitches Brew</i> had been recorded the
    previous summer, it wouldn't be released until a few weeks after this performance.
    And as any of that album's millions of fans will tell you, its music isn't really
    the kind that sinks in on the first listen.</p><p>
    
    The Davis Quin/Sextet was opening for Steve Miller and Neil Young for these
    sets.  But if the jazz community was bitterly divided over the notion of Miles
    Davis playing ""rock"" music, I can only imagine what was going through the heads
    of people accustomed to hearing ""Cinnamon Girl,"" rather than ""Miles Runs the
    Voodoo Down,"" for an encore.  Judging by the audience response here, they
    probably didn't really know what to think.  The applause is polite, but hesitant,
    and the two or three guys who wanted more at the end may have been anomalies,
    because it was pretty obvious the band had left it all onstage after the last
    number.  To recognize greatness: it is elusive, and most likely, beyond the
    sensibilities of most hippies and/or mere mortals.</p><p>
    
    The first set begins as Holland, DeJohnette and Corea vamp to a furious funk
    groove.  Heavy bass and some well-placed exotic percussion (supplied by the
    redoubtable Moreira, whose playing receives the ultimate dis by being labeled
    ""superfluous"" in the liner notes) kick things off, and by the time Davis enters,
    the brew is already quite hot.  The tune is ""Directions,"" and apparently, it
    refers to many at once.  Miles seems to be aiming straight for the jugular while
    Holland takes the straight and steady, and when Shorter comes in, he leads
    DeJohnette and Corea on a path so ridden with turbulence and strife, it derails
    the entire tune.  About five minutes in, it becomes impossible to remember that
    most of these same musicians had produced something like <i>In a Silent Way</i>,
    only a year earlier.</p><p>
    
    Afterwards, the band segues into ""Spanish Key,"" one of the more straightforward
    pieces on <i>Bitches Brew</i>, but here already transformed into a three-headed
    monster by a band that obviously couldn't sit still on a bet.  The three heads
    in question: a rhythm section which never actually came down from the highs of
    the previous rave, Davis, who was playing more aggressively and with more muscle
    than he ever had, and Wayne Shorter, who was playing like he never would again.</p><p>
    
    Of course, he wouldn't, at least with Davis.  After this date, Shorter would
    leave the group to form the seminal fusion outfit Weather Report.  When he
    first performed with Davis in the early 60s, he'd received the rap of being a
    Coltrane disciple (not a criticism, really), but had always possessed a natural
    calm that his spiritual mentor would discard in favor of pure expression and,
    often, fury.  On this date, Shorter meets his maker, full of fire and machine
    gun lines on soprano and tenor sax that had only been hinted at on the great
    releases by the second Davis Quintet.</p><p>
    
    During the second set, whatever jazz history had not been rewritten got its due
    and then some.  ""Directions"" (it appears twice, since these two discs document
    both an early and a late show) starts off innocently enough, with a low, humming
    growl from Holland, but quickly develops into the Apocalypse.  There are moments
    when the music seems to cross over into the avant-garde and free jazz realms,
    especially whenever Shorter is playing a solo.  Reportedly, Davis never
    considered himself a part of those camps, but it's clear he wasn't afraid to let
    his band steer the ship in that general direction, so long as they kept the
    groove alive.  Corea brings it down a little with a few choruses of comparatively
    traditional playing, even if it isn't less intense than the others'.</p><p>
    
    The tune segues into ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down""; very different, far greasier
    and Fatter (with a capital 'F,' as you can see) than the studio version on
    <i>Bitches Brew</i>.  It could almost pass for hard blues-rock, if not for
    DeJohnette's relentless cymbal attack and Davis' distorted howling.  Here,
    though, it seems to serve as a kind of breather so the band can rev up for
    ""Bitches Brew,"" arguably in its finest version anywhere on this CD.  It begins
    with ominous, woozy percussion, and some agitated horn punches from the leader.
    Then, out of nowhere, everything gets funky.  Holland lays down some serious
    dirty pimp low end, filtered through that infamous ""ring modulation"" to give it
    the extra ass-mangling quality so desired in serious jazz performance.  After
    a bit, Shorter drops another trip-bop bomb, and then the quiet comes back.
    Davis takes it out with a few quick, muted jabs, while the beat simmers below.
    And if I never heard another track by that band again, I'd still rank them
    alongside Davis' other classic groups.</p><p>
    
    The set ends with a version of ""It's About That Time"" (from <i>In a Silent
    Way</i>), spliced with something called ""Willie Nelson.""  The first part takes
    the original and applies the underlying aggression of this set to its once
    peaceful groove.  The second half takes the bottom out, and showcases at once
    the band's penchant for repetitive riffing and complete irreverence towards the
    way jazz solos were supposed to be played (I'm not sure there's a straight
    chord progression on the entire record).</p><p>
    
    When the track is over, the audience, who probably weren't sure of what had
    just happened, offers cautious appreciation via some very polite applause.
    The emcee announces the group again (Miles never spoke during performances),
    and there are a couple of calls for an encore.  Moreira lets everyone know
    it's over by blowing his whistle, and I surmise that many of the people
    there were letting out sighs of relief.  There's no way to know if they
    were aware of the jazz revolution starting right under their noses.  Over
    thirty years later, I'm not sure I understand what the preceding hour-and-a-half
    was all about, except what I consider exceptional musicians taking exceptional
    chances.  It's undoubtedly pointless trying to reduce music to levels of ""genius,""
    so from now on, I'll take whatever those guys had to say without much inclination
    of trying to put it into words.</p></div>"|2197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2197-live-at-the-fillmore-east-march-7-1970-its-about-that-time/|9.5|Dominique Leone

    Cooper and Josh Eustis sound remarkably calm and contemplative. Far from being
    an album of corporately bloated, manufactured angst, <i>Fahrenheit Fair Enough</i>
    is so laid back that it's permanently supine. Cooper and Eustis have previously
    worked on remixes with Nine Inch Nails' Danny Lohner, who's responsible for
    tracks such as A Perfect Circle's ""Judith"" and ""The Hollow,"" as well as Eminem's
    ""The Way I Am."" In addition to collaborating on a glitchy remix of NIN's ""Where
    is Everybody?"" (on the <i>Things Falling Apart</i> remix EP), the pair have also
    contributed to ""Even Deeper,"" which will appear on the soundtrack to the John
    and James Hughes high school road movie, <i>Newport South</i>.</p><p>
    Though the contemplative vibe of <i>Fahrenheit Fair Enough</i> raises eyebrows,
    given the band's previous production credits, John Hughes' Hefty label is a
    perfect home for Telefon Tel Aviv. The band, now supporting Godspeed You Black
    Emperor and Califone on tour, are comfortably (in fact, sometimes too comfortably)
    similar to Scott Herren's Savath and Savalas project and, all too infrequently,
    the seismic waves of Italian glitchworkers Retina.</p><p>
    Kicking off with the title track, Cooper and Eustis perform their deft
    impersonation of the lulling, tastefully echoed tones of the Album Leaf. An
    electronic piano makes deliberated, pseudo-profound statements before the
    Warp-descended posse of percussion squiggles, bips, blips, and blops take up
    their squirmy position by the e-piano. These opposites never attract. Though
    a steady backbeat keeps both time and order, Cooper and Eustis are forced into
    using a calliope-like sound to bring any beauty to this ill-conceived pairing.</p><p>
    A slightly Oval-processed electric piano opens ""TTV,"" but it's the malfunctioning,
    algorithmic percussion that holds the field before Cooper and Eustis let a solo
    flute furnish the track with sentimental elegance. ""Lotus above Water"" initially
    features dapplings of efx-laden guitars and a Matthew Herbert-style sample-anything
    atmosphere. The duo tones down those noodly ambiences when they engage a subdued
    kickdrum, but at 3\xBD minutes, the track's too short to build any real steam.</p><p>
    ""John Thomas on the Inside Is Nothing but Foam"" isn't only heavily indebted to
    <i>Millions Now Living</i>-period Tortoise, but is also a near-identical twin
    of Savath and Savalas' ""Conditioning."" The guitar melodies rise and fall with
    studied grace and a pitiable yearning to be admired, but we've heard these
    stereotypical post-rock figures a million times.  And I think it's safe to say
    that the duo hasn't been comatose or listening to Slayer albums since Slint
    disbanded. ""Life Is All about Taking Things in and Putting Things Out"" never
    gets beyond the oblique strategy of its title. A grand piano impersonates
    ambient composer Harold Budd, but to avoid unfavorable comparisons with Budd's
    <i>The Plateaux of Mirrors</i>, Cooper and Eustis allow ambient spectral roars
    to wander through the mix. Perhaps Trent Reznor advised them to do that.</p><p>
    Telefon Tel Aviv achieve some degree of distinction with ""Your Face Reminds Me
    of When I Was Old."" Beginning like a sound sculpture, Cooper and Eustis bring
    clattering, curling elements to the foreground and allow them to loiter and
    interact with each other.  Elsewhere, real instruments and software-generated
    noises exist in an apartheid of non-engagement.  Because the distinction between
    ""real"" and ""virtual"" is erased on ""Your Face,"" Eustis and Cooper capture the
    essence of Savath and Savalas' success.</p><p>
    Though <i>Fahrenheit Fair Enough</i> includes nothing incisive or insightful,
    it's nonetheless an intriguing release. Annoying as the album frequently is,
    it doesn't irritate through ham-fistedness or incompetence.  But it's somewhat
    frustrating because, while the duo occasionally displays the beauty they're

More so than ever (if
    possible): New York is Now.  Subtitled <i>The New Wave of Free Jazz</i>, Freeman's
    book sketches the Big Apple's current scene from the enthusiastic perspective of
    a former metalhead.  The sprawling landscapes of cacophony, both that of the
    scene and the chaos at the former World Trade Center concourse, aren't so much
    analogies for each other as much as they are reflections of the increasingly
    complex geometry of the City.  Too bad Freeman wasn't more influenced by these
    flexible avenues; he might have written something more encompassing, and less
    two-dimensional.  His gossipy account of attending a recording session for the
    new David S. Ware Quartet album is amusing in its fanboy chatter, of course,
    but the bubble of epic mystery in that final chapter is burst when you hear the
    mixed results of the final product.</p><p>
<i>Corridors &amp; Parallels</i> does appear to have all the hallmarks of an artistic
    tectonic shift.  It's tenor saxophonist David Ware's first album in years on a
    smaller label.  Plus, Matthew Shipp controversially abandons his usual role as
    the group's pianist to play a Korg synthesizer filled with preset sound effects
    while bassist William Parker and drummer Guillermo E. Brown make for a tight
    backbone.  Thematically, the album begins and ends with (and is divided down
    the middle by) untitled interludes.  And then there's the marquee song titles,
    like ""Straight Track"" and ""Jazz Fi-Sci.""</p><p>
    
    ""Straight Track"" features Shipp's choppy, flute-like synth, Parker's washboard
    plucking, and Brown's rainstick-mimicking, cymbal-showering drums, clearly
    conscious of the presence of former band member (and recent Yo La Tengo touring
    percussionist) Susie Ibarra.  A minute passes, then two, three-- the pun is
    almost audible: where's Ware?  After four minutes, the hornet buzz of his tenor
    finally appears.  This would have been the perfect place to test the cool of the
    Korg with the frantic sax, but for some mind-boggling reason, Shipp sits on his
    hands for another few minutes.  Eight, and the convergence comes too late--
    synth and sax meet for just a moment at the apex of this bloated ten-minute
    track, and everything grinds to a halt seconds later.</p><p>
    
    ""Jazz Fi-Sci"" moves along a similar axis.  Ware and Brown hammer away at
    incredible speeds.  Then, they pause completely, as Shipp keys a sequence of
    madcap electronic arpeggios and gritty noise.  Same parallels-- electronic and
    organic lines never cross.  It's fun, and Ware's desperate bleating sounds wild,
    but the track title and the artificial partitions scream ""gimmick!"" from a
    thousand miles away.  The frustrating part is that Isotope 217 have done this
    type of fusion in an infinitely more relevant, yet irreverent manner.</p><p>
    
    Another good/not-so-good parallel: the two songs on this album with preprogrammed
    rhythms tracks.  ""Superimposed"" employs the kind of pseudo-African-influenced
    drum lines heard in 80s radio pap or ""zoom-zoom-zoom"" car commercials.  The
    wailing hip-hop whistle doesn't exactly do much to freshen things up, and all
    of Ware's tight-lipped squeals and extended wails don't make up for this dank
    retro.  The title track fares slightly better, if only because Parker's
    ultra-low-end, cello-like playing and Ware's slower, more deliberate style
    dominate the drum loops they stole from 808 State's closet.</p><p>
    
    The best cuts are the least predictable.  Despite their brevity, the three
    untitled interludes are full of intrigue.  Parker's bass takes eerie prominence
    (especially important because he's often drowned out elsewhere), and the last
    track is mixed so effectively that Brown's sticks sound unnervingly like they're
    tapping on the inner rim of your headphones.  ""Sound-a-Bye"" develops like an
    elaboration on these pieces.  Here, Ware plays about as slowly as possible, the
    sustained drone of his sax complemented nicely by Shipp whose keys now plink
    with clipped accents.  The intensity matches the voluminous soundscapes of
    Spring Heel Jack's <i>Masses</i> project, which all but Ware contributed to.
    And the alien harmony of ""Somewhere"" strains comprehension, each musician
    struggling to make their instrument sound like anything but itself.</p><p>
    
    ""Mother May You Rest in Bliss"" ends the album proper with an emotional tempest
    that was sorely lacking up to this point.  Dedicated to his mom, Lucille, the
    elegy is led by Ware's incredibly lyrical delivery, a soulful solo complemented
    by Shipp's synths which seem to channel Moby's ""God Moving Over the Face of the
    Waters.""  I'll leave it to the listener to decide whether the good half of an
    album makes it worth the purchase.  Unfortunately, the other half weakens all
    its supports with some tacky choices regarding sound palettes and dynamics--
    deconstruction in the least clever sense, far from Phil Freeman's comparison of
    <i>Corridors &amp; Parallels</i> to the Orb.  Maybe he was thinking William Orbit?</p></div>"|8583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8583-corridors-and-parallels/|6.2|Christopher Dare

Jack, who showed up for the first
    time in these parts last night, is a bastard.  He made me late for work by forcing
    me to scrape my windshield at 6:00 a.m.  Robert, the sappy, mass-appeal scribe,
    is the Barry Manilow of poets.  He has the dubious distinction of being the
    first object of scorn for most people after they develop their literary palate
    beyond the 6th grade level.  That leaves Edith, tied with former Huskers
    quarterback Scott Frost, architect of one of the most spectacular last-minute,
    game-winning plays in NCAA history-- a deflected endzone desperation pass that
    propelled his team to the 1997 national championship.</p><p>
    Actually, Edith and Scott have their similarities.  Edith, too, came unexpectedly
    into the national spotlight in 1997, not on the strength of her right arm, but
    rather her critically acclaimed debut, <i>Calling Over Time</i>.  And Scott
    was drafted by the Jets not as a quarterback, but instead to make the leap to
    defense in the strong safety position, which is faintly analogous to the change
    in direction in Edith's shake-'em-up sophomore effort, the psychedelic and
    electrified <i>Telescopic</i>, which many surprised fans took to be a veer off
    of the well-worn, singer/songwriter path she'd started down.</p><p>
    But this is <i>Pitchfork</i>; we're not here to make clunky comparisons and
    stretched linkages (no, really).  We're here to review quality music.  And
    luckily, Edith's third full-length, this summer's mellifluously titled <i>Wonder
    Wonder</i>, has plenty of that.</p><p>
    Half the tracks on the disc are upbeat, <i>un</i>brooding affairs.  Not rockers,
    but songs that aim for optimism and whimsy, and hit the mark dead center.
    Equally whimsical in the instrumentation, the album is sprinkled throughout with
    bells, chimes, shakers, and a cocktail of other percussive oddities, as well as
    a weird bass harmonica on a couple tracks that sounds like a dead-ringer for a
    baritone sax.</p><p>
    The title track is perhaps a too-perfect example of both of these characteristics.
    Kitchen drawer-percussion horse-clops beneath a goofball bouncy beat and melody,
    driving the song along at a canter.  A carefree clarinet solo is offbeat but
    still manages to be a perfect fit.  When Frost dives into the swinging break,
    ""And always/ My wandering mind/ Takes me right down to the bottom of the
    basement,"" the smile is involuntary, and wide.</p><p>
    ""Cars and Parties"" opens with bells and a military tattoo beat.  Frost slurs
    lines like, ""Everytime I close my eyes/ I dream of someone in Texas/ And every
    strip mall along the highway/ Reminds me of my home,"" with equal parts feigned
    detachment and homesickness.  This is one of those rare, perfectly balanced
    songs where the power of the lush-yet-catchy music is matched evenly by the
    power of the lyrics.</p><p>
    The other half of the songs are so intimate that Frost could very well be
    standing behind you, whispering them into your left ear.  On ""Dreamers,"" the
    first syllable Frost sings sounds so brittle and fragile it seems about to
    shatter into ice crystals at any moment.  The chordal opener of ""True"" is
    graceful, buoyant, and gently fingerpicked, and ""Hear My Heart,"" one of Frost's
    earliest compositions, each tweak my voyeuristic streak.  Edith uses her voice
    like a paint stripper, flaking away the artifice, leaving only the base primer
    coat of her raw emotion.  The songs sound so tenderly personal at times, I
    experience peeping-Tom guilt listening.</p><p>
    Two of the best tracks on <i>Wonder Wonder</i> are ones that display Frost's
    more strongly cultivated country influences.  Brushed snare circles out a
    pattern in ""Easy to Love"" that could have easily been found in an Acuff/Rose
    C&amp;W; standard, with a dulled piano break and cowboy harmonies completing the
    masquerade.  And ""Further"" takes an old-time swing premise, adding a killer
    melody and violin solo.  Frost's usually gentle vocals soar and dive between
    sweet and torchy.  The vibe you get is that this song, out of all of them, was
    the most fun for her to record.</p><p>
    The support personnel are above reproach.  Steve Albini's engineering work is,
    quite simply, masterful.  His hand/ear coordination is so keenly attuned to the
    low-key material that the songs and sounds seem almost to leap from the plastic.
    Rian Murphy, the producer of Frost's first album, returns once again to assemble
    a cast of musicians including Archer Prewitt, Poi Dog Pondering's Susan Vøelz
    and ex-Telegraph Melts cellist Amy Domingues.</p><p>
    With this album, Frost moves beyond comparisons with others who may have a
    similar birthmark on their music or timbre to their voice, and should now
    be firmly entrenched as the benchmark for intelligent, eclectic, eccentric
    folk-pop.  She can lull.  She can pop.  She can put on a retro croon.  If
    I had any savage beast within me, I'm certain it would be soothed.  Everyone
    else, come measure up, if you think you can.</p></div>"|3222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3222-wonder-wonder/|8.7|John Dark

    Kindercore anymore?  College freshmen were now name-dropping Saddle Creek and
    adoring raw-driven honesty over the bravado of Brian Wilson and late-era Beatles.
    Shiver to think they drew blanks when asked about the relevance of Cornelius or
    that they didn't ride the Os Mutantes wave all the way to shore.</p><p>
    
    Oh, but I did.  Ah, 1997.  I was there through it all-- those incredibly banal
    Kindercore concept albums about monkeys, forests, pastoral childhood, etc, etc,
    ad nauseam.  Standing tall through the wasteland of incredibly poor album titles,
    toy percussion and mispronunciations of Moog, I'm admittedly jaded towards
    anything that smacks of mod-revivalist psych-pop.  Which is why the first skim
    through June Panic's <i>Silver Sound Sessions</i> was somewhat disconcerting.
    Initially, the record seems to swell and bubble over with too-sincere, sweeping
    hooks.  And then there's the guy's voice: too nasal to be suave, too reaching to
    qualify as straight pop.  The clues momentarily spelt disaster.  Elephant 6?
    The 'Core?  No, only your average bedroom artist whose 11-year path has
    occasionally fallen victim to handclaps and silly melodies.</p><p>
    
    That said, June Panic is a great songwriter whose sprawling list of solo records,
    EPs and compilation appearances have given him time to flesh out his skills and
    hone his craft.  Now, after eight cassettes and three full-length albums, he
    comes through with <i>The Silver Sound Sessions</i>.  The improvement is
    dramatic.</p><p>
    
    Several of these songs downright grabbed my hand, went for the man-hug and ended
    up in the full embrace.  There are certainly ties to such 'Sixers as Elf Power
    and Beulah, as well as a little <i>Black Foliage</i>-era Olivia Tremor Control
    (most noticeably on ""The Silver Sound""), but without the cloying pseudo-mystical
    bullshit OTC slathered between tracks on that album.  For the most part, Panic
    muses on the standard pop topics, with emphasis on deceit and love-gone-wrong.
    The guy's obviously not out to change the world or anything-- in the traditional
    pop vein, his lyrics rhyme rather than going the reflective, rambling route
    that's stood for ages as a trademark of self-consciously ""important"" songwriters.</p><p>
    
    And how about the music?  <i>The Silver Sound Sessions</i> is primarily
    guitar-driven, and packed with lazy-river drumming and even the occasional
    eight-bars.  Suffice to say, its charm isn't in the techs.  ""(Bells) Ring Out
    the News"" carries a bar-room bassline and slithery blues.  The opener, ""Travel
    Time,"" employs a snare backbone and sub-layers of horns that lie dormant
    underneath the track until near the end when they infiltrate and chaotically
    take over.</p><p>
    
    All told, <i>The Silver Sound Sessions</i> is a pretty solid record coming from
    a guy with such a history of isolated bedroom emoting.  Of course, it's not
    brilliant by any stretch of the imagination.  But if nothing else, it beats
    Masters of the Hemisphere and the Marshmallow Coast.</p></div>"|6142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6142-the-silver-sound-sessions-ep/|7.4|Daphne Carr

You can teach a gorilla to speak in sign language,
    like the world-famous Koko. You can give a gorilla a kitten, and it will love
    and nurture it. It will give it a cute name like ""all ball"" or ""smoky.""  Apes,
    on the other hand, are fucking vicious. You can sing to an ape, but it will only
    fling its dung in your face, pound its chest, and masturbate furiously.  You can
    give an ape a kitten, but it will only beat it into a bloody, lifeless pulp, and
    then consume that pulp like a tasty milkshake.</p><p>
    
    Or maybe my perception of Apes has been altered by this, the debut record from
    the sneering, posturing rockers bearing the name of the oft-maligned primates.
    For those of you who'd think it impossible to cock-rock without a guitar, the
    The Apes prove that having a chick with an organ (er...) can incline a band towards
    rocking out just as much as having a dirty guy with a ponytail on ""lead"" guitar.
    In fact, the organ works wonders for The Apes, filling out their sound to the
    point where it becomes a massive, towering entity that provides perfect backing
    for lead singer Paul Weil's spitting quasi-antics.</p><p>
    
    I use the term ""quasi-antics"" because The Apes still seem to be working out what
    exactly their antics are. They like to say ""The Apes"" a lot. A lot of their songs
    have the word ""ape"" in them. At live shows, they speak of ""Sugar Mountain."" They
    wear camouflage gear, sometimes capes. Weil takes off his shirt, revealing his
    fine, chiseled body. No, really, he does have a fine, chiseled body, but that
    only makes the shirt-removal seem more gratuitous than that conducted by the
    less chiseled Tim Harrington of Les Savy Fav.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, Les Savy Fav have some very close ties to The Apes-- they signed the band
    to bassist Syd Butler's Frenchkiss label, and are thanked in The Apes' final
    ""thank you's"" track, ""Apes Salute."" But musically, The Apes follow a path much
    more straightforward than that of their mentors. Les Savy Fav have an amazing
    knack for crafting dynamic, off-kilter punk songs; The Apes just want to rock.</p><p>
    
    And rock they do. At its heart, <i>The Fugue in the Fog</i> is a simple riff-rock
    album. There's really not all that much in the way of vocal melody, as most of
    the vocals here are practically spoken and highly distorted. So the issue really
    comes down to the quality of the riffs themselves, and the songs containing
    these riffs.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, <i>The Fugue in the Fog</i> doesn't succeed in its execution as
    much as it does in its setup. At times, the band's sheer energy carries the songs.
    And at other times, the songs are simply pretty damned good.  ""Blood and Light,""
    the album's most engaging track is, like most of the tracks here, based around a
    basic central riff.  Thankfully, it varies enough to hold your interest.  Quite
    simply put, it's a well-crafted rock song.</p><p>
    
    The album's opener, ""Black Tears,"" is another fine example of The Apes fully
    exploring the potential of a single riff. Elsewhere on the album, however, the
    band tends to rely too heavily on the same played-out pentatonic scale techniques
    that have been rock staples pretty much since its inception. Led Zeppelin could
    get away with it 30 years ago, but today's demanding listener expects a bit more.</p><p>
    
    As far as straight-up rock records go, though, <i>The Fugue in the Fog</i> is
    damned good. The Apes have forged a relatively distinctive sound, and cranked
    out a few seriously awesome songs. There's a ridiculous amount of potential here,
    but oftentimes that potential goes unexplored. Still, The Apes are, without
    question, entertaining. If they paid a little more attention to actually writing
    their songs, they could be downright dangerous.</p></div>"|218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/218-the-fugue-in-the-fog/|7.8|Matt LeMay

Any elderly engineer or factory worker
    can attest to the banality of the same tired day-to-day routines.  Eventually,
    wasted months trail behind like a dense fog in your hazy memory, leaving you
    wondering if there was even any point to it all.  Fortunately for Superchunk,
    their job entails being a highly influential rock band with a devoted fanbase,
    their own record label, and a legacy that most of the nation's wealthiest 1%
    would trade in their multi-millions for.  For Superchunk, twelve years is a dream
    come true.</p><p>
    Their humble beginnings as a small-time Chapel Hill pop band in 1989 have, over
    the years, given way to next-big-thing status, major label bidding wars, and
    eight studio albums, several of which have become heralded as indie classics.
    Now in their 30s, the long-standing lineup of Mac McCaughan, guitarist Jim
    Wilbur, bassist Laura Ballance and drummer Jon Wurster is still making music
    with the same heart of their early records, even while time has begun to change
    them into a subtler incarnation of their former selves.</p><p>
    Signs of the new, more refined Superchunk first appeared on 1999's Jim
    O'Rourke-produced <i>Come Pick Me Up</i> with tracks like ""Tiny Bombs"" and
    ""Hello Hawk.""  But they were just signs, as raucous, infectiously upbeat songs
    like ""Good Dreams"" and ""June Showers"" dominated the album with anthemic bliss.
    On <i>Here's to Shutting Up</i>, though, the once-tightly wound hyper heroes
    have foregone the distortion in lieu of smoothed-out balladry and reflective
    repose.</p><p>
    While often sung from the point of view of fictional characters, McCaughan's
    lyrics on <i>Here's to Shutting Up</i> often reveal his wist for days gone by.
    This is perhaps most notable in one of the album's rare rockers, ""Out on the
    Wing,"" in which a person confides, ""All the music that I love is out of date/
    So take me to the place/ Where there's no such thing as taste,"" a sentiment most
    thirty-something ex-music fans can bitterly relate to.  Several of these songs
    also dwell on young love and history, such as the subdued, pedal-steel-infused
    ""Phone Sex,"" which addresses a teenager stood up for a date, and the despondent
    7\xBD-minute-long ""What Do You Look Forward To,"" where McCaughan recalls seeing
    ""anticipation and a smile on the face of this girl/ And her mother through the
    glare on the glass of the windshield as they drove away.""</p><p>
    But even though this album exhibits a softer, more melancholy side of Superchunk,
    a handful of old-school rockers fill the album out nicely.  It's with one of
    these, the not-necessarily full-force, but nonetheless aggressive ""Art Class
    (Song for Yayoi Kusama),"" that the album's clear standout comes.  Amidst a
    pounding rhythm section, McCaughan seems to deride art schools more than that
    classic time-wasting high school elective with lines like, ""Why so serious/
    When it's only your life that's at stake/ Why so serious/ When your life is the
    art that you make,"" and, ""So shit in a can but your art is not free.""  Elsewhere,
    the almost Guided by Voices-length slab of raging guitars and crashing drum
    fills, ""Rainy Streets,"" provides some early relief from the album's pensive
    meditations.</p><p>
    Producer Brian Paulson, who worked with the band on 1993's <i>Foolish</i>, is
    back behind the decks for <i>Here's to Shutting Up</i>, and despite the band's
    maturing songcraft, his recording techniques give the record more of a classic
    Superchunk feel.  Jim O'Rourke may have added some meaty soundwork to <i>Come
    Pick Me Up</i>, but Paulson seems more comfortable with the guys, mixing Mac
    McCaughan's still-boyish tenor amongst the instrumentation rather than up in
    your face.  It's a seemingly small touch, but an unexpected one, and it makes
    all the difference in the album's long-term listenability.</p><p>
    Of course, at the end of the day, <i>Here's to Shutting Up</i> isn't anything
    spectacular.  The new direction of these songs seems logical enough, and will
    likely sit well with longtime fans who are, by now, also growing somewhat less
    excitable.  Still, you can't help but miss the youthful ambition of Superchunk's
    glory days, when they seemed so relevant shouting out simple songs of love and
    boredom, and blared constantly from college stations across the country.  On
    the other hand, twelve years is a long time to hold a job.  It's just nice to
    see that they're still inspired by what they do.</p></div>"|7617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7617-heres-to-shutting-up/|7.9|Ryan Schreiber

    J. Robbins is not only a convenient reference point for describing Dureau's
    voice, but the affable and hook-conjuring mind behind Jawbox and Burning Airlines
    also manned the nobs and untangled patch chords on <i>The Apology Wars</i>.
    But unlike some of his other semi-recent production efforts (Promise Ring, Jets
    to Brazil), Blueline Medic's songs have enough teeth to showcase the man's
    production skills, and conversely, his able hands add contours to songs that
    might have otherwise sounded stale and quotidian.</p><p>
    
    And now, friends, the track-by-track:</p><p>
    
    Things get off on the wrong foot, unfortunately.  ""Cathedral"" (Dureau's a big
    Raymond Carver fan) is lyrically engaging, but the melody-- especially for the
    all-important opening track-- sucks. The vocal phrases are too wordy,
    strung-together, and shapeless to redeem the punk-by-rote song.</p><p>
    
    ""Ever the Lawn"" benefits from the contrast with its lackluster predecessor, and
    bubbles over with quirk, similar to much of the material off Burning Airline's
    debut, 1999's <i>Mission: Control!</i>  ""Making the Nouveau Riche"" is a straight
    ahead, almost corny pop-punk song about leading an unconventional lifestyle, but
    more specifically, about being in a band. It works, getting by on sheer kinetic
    energy and memorably off-kilter lyrics: ""I'm without a zack/ A truth/ A coin, a
    kopeck or an elusive brass razoo.""</p><p>
    
    ""At Least We Had the War"" is the fourth and finest track on the album. It's also
    guaranteed to make you do an auditory double take as you wonder how the fuck
    Morrissey took over your CD player; the intro and ending to the song are as
    good a Smiths imitation as there ever was. The meat of the song is murder--
    sweeping, semi-epic pop with better-than-average melodies boasting smooth
    transitions between the tonally different Smiths-sounding sections and the main
    body.  ""Not Interested"" is likewise heavily Smiths-informed in certain parts and
    smart-punk in others.</p><p>
    
    The well-titled ""Shuffle and Scrape"" sounds like something off some Golden Era
    of Dischord release, very much in the spirit of Jawbox's seminal album,
    <i>Novelty</i>. ""Somnambulist"" displays Shaun Lohoar's simply tasteful drumming,
    while also incorporating decorative chiming sounds to great effect, one of the
    rare departures from standard instrumentation.  ""Up Against the Fault,"" on the
    other hand, is simply a good example of the band's flair for the anthemic.</p><p>
    
    There's nothing particularly mind-blowing about <i>The Apology Wars</i>, but the
    warmth and comfort of a new and eminently listenable rock band is noteworthy on
    its own. That the unimpeachably solid songs are also graced by thoughtful lyrics
    and underlined by obvious enthusiasm is reason to keep an eye on the Melbourne-based
    four-piece.</p></div>"|823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/823-the-apology-wars/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

It doesn't roll off the tongue like Emerson, Lake
    and Palmer, now does it?  Although I will concede that this bandname is slightly
    less cumbersome than Anderson-Bruford-Wakeman-Howe, it's fair to say that this
    record was not intended for discussion. Can you see asking someone, ""Have you
    heard the new one by Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge?"" Or, ""I like the Pixies, John
    Coltrane and Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge."" Fuck it. It just doesn't work.</p><p>
    
    But I have to figure something out, because if asked about recent favorite
    records, my answer would include this thing by Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge.
    A bit of background on the players: David Kristian is an electronic musician
    fond of collaboration who explores the audibility threshold with his ambient
    works (see <i>Room Tone</i>) as well as dabbling in beat-driven techno. Sam
    Shalabi is a versatile musician who has lent his name to the near-East trance
    combo the Shalabi Effect, as well as playing on countless records in the
    Constellation/Godspeed/Alien8 axis. And Alexandre St-Onge plays upright bass
    with the Shalabi Effect, in addition to other gigs. All are based in Montreal,
    where they've performed together as a trio on occasion.</p><p>
    
    While this record is improvised, the mood of each piece is so integrated and
    clearly defined it feels more like studied composition. St-Onge's upright bass
    provides the anchor with unsettling drones, scuffs and plucks. Kristian fills
    in dark colors on an analog synth, sometimes with gurgling modulation, and other
    times with quaking bass tones. Shalabi, meanwhile, provides much of the texture,
    picking and scraping his way on guitar and oud. It's an odd combination on paper,
    but the three work together as a single six-armed beast intent on conjuring
    black, brooding atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    A discomforting sense of anxiety is established from the outset with ""Dirt Well.""
    Kristian lays down a warm drone, and over it, St-Onge bows a slow, creaking bass.
    When Shalabi adds delicate plucks on oud, the music becomes paradoxically both
    menacing and delicate, as the tiny, precise sounds far exceed the sum of their
    parts. The music occasionally threatens to burst into pure noise, but the
    crescendo (and attendant relief) never comes. This music is about the stalk and
    the hunt, not the kill, and the tension is impressively thick.</p><p>
    
    The mood throughout is so consistent and relentless that some of the individual
    pieces are hard to differentiate. As Kristian's is the most sonically flexible
    instrument, the tracks that stand out most are those where he takes the lead.
    ""The Heart of a Mouse"" begins with some looped glitch-style friction, introduces
    other low level pops and hisses, and then becomes an increasingly quiet buzz
    that fades over the course of a minute or more. ""Insistent Falls"" finds Kristian
    piercing the silence with a high-pitched, grating synth drone piled on by guitar
    scrapes and bass moans. St-Onge take the lead on ""Little Feck,"" bowing higher in
    his instrument's range and imparting an eerie, speech-like quality that works
    perfectly next to the hypnotic hum.</p><p>
<i>Kristian, Shalabi, St-Onge</i> is a demanding record-- one that requires a
    certain amount of work from the listener to be fully appreciated. The subtlety
    and quiet detail simply cannot be grasped without concentration. So no more
    talking; it is time now we listen.</p></div>"|4535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4535-kristian-shalabi-st-onge/|8.2|Mark Richard-San

Time is on your side."" The Constantines are
    quoting Rod Stewart's ""Young Turks"" on their own ""Young Offenders"". I love that
    Rod Stewart. He hasn't always made the greatest records, but he's always been a
    fun, friendly spirit, and what a great voice.  Plus, he refused to age gracefully.</p><p>
    
    From puberty on, we strip ourselves of any grace. We can either be subsumed by
    our awkwardness or we can revel in it, which is what rock and roll is really
    about-- a perpetual adolescence.  What more powerful, sensitive, anguished and
    alive period of your life to perpetuate?  And what more vibrant, muscular,
    raging-for-life music than rock and roll?</p><p>
    
    Guelph, Ontario's The Constantines are constant teens, too.  And when their music
    isn't capturing the goofy sweetness teenagers can share when they let their guard
    down, it captures the drama, anguish, artsy pretension and urgency of youth. They
    carry the torch for Fugazi with heart and muscle.  Bassist Dallas Wehrle's pulsing
    eighth notes ground dynamic mathematical riffs, with the players dropping in and
    out to shock the repetitions.</p><p>
    
    The Constantines climb closer to the Fugazic Throne on the strength of
    guitarist Steven Lambke's chops, the intelligent poetry of Bry Webb's lyrics,
    and the boozy rasps of both Webb and Lambke's vocals, which recall <i>Let It
    Be</i>-era Paul Westerberg.  And like The Replacements, The Constantines
    dominate their movement with their personality, seeming wounded and aged
    (another teenage-less trick) before their time.  ""We want the death of rock and
    roll,"" Webb announces on the opening track, ""Arizona"".  It's a bleak and blocky
    number about the 1983 Arizona suicide of Danny Rapp, who wrote ""Rock 'n' Roll Is
    Here to Stay"".  As the words come out, the music defies the message.</p><p>
    
    The songs get better, looser, and more varied as the album progresses. ""Tonight
    we milk the stiffs,"" Webb announces on ""Some Party"". ""Storm the Bastille/ Raid
    the throne/ Mock the swine who'll rot in heaven/ Swinging on the velvet ropes/
    Some punks getting some kicks at some party.""  Nice lyrics.  The Replacements
    influence shows up again on ""No Ecstasy"" which swings like the classic ""I Will
    Dare"".  But it's ""Hyacinth Blues"" that really makes the bid for greatness. The
    guitars toll for thee as they stand silhouetted like an exorcist in the mist:
    ""Under Suspicion/ The fool's got the hyacinth...""  And here's one of the great
    pauses of rock and roll, giving meaning and heart to the topic at hand: ""...Blues.""
    Then, with anger and passion, they literally spell it out: ""O-V-E-R-D-O-S-E.""</p><p>
    
    Another Westerbergian moment, ""St. You"", serves as the record's acoustic ballad,
    and no doubt the first of many in a long career. It's the part of the album that
    says, ""All this hard rocking is just something I do for a gas. I'm really a songwriter,
    and a damn fine one.""  The also gentle but stronger ""Little Instruments"" closes
    the album on a determined note.  They may not have the baddest axes, but as they
    state on the track, they've ""got an amplifier.""</p><p>
    
    Indeed, they are amplifiers, as all overgrown teens are. They're emotional burn
    victims, holed up in their rooms, reading portentous comic books. Maybe they read
    Alan Moore's <i>Swamp Thing</i> and identify with the isolated, elemental monster.
    All teenagers are Swamp Things.  They long for Alan Moore's other character,
    John Constantine, to come and tell them what they are, and that they and they
    alone can halt an apocalypse of the soul.  Live forever, Constantines.</p></div>"|1590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1590-constantines/|8.7|Dan Kilian

Where there had been birds and restless
    natives, there are now supernovas and hyperdrives, and the out of touch has
    become the inverted.  With this wonderful surround sound, what I had considered
    a wonderful piece of escapist communal catharsis is now transformed into space
    age abstraction.  But the sunny vibe is still there, and I'm sure that's Eye
    behind the controls, so whatever dizziness or isolation I may experience is
    probably without warrant.  And yet I can't shake the feeling that this is
    something new and important.  What will I write about it?  How do describe the
    evolution of intelligence without remaking <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>?  And
    most importantly, how did these guys come so far in such a short period of time?
    This is the story of Boredoms and their music for starchildren.</p><p>
    
    Boredoms started out as your run-of-the-mill hardcore, noise, thrash, funk,
    dadaist, experimental, sophomoric, no wave, no future, acid haze, surrealist,
    metallic, Jurassic, cut up, alternative-to-everything, solution-to-nothing,
    pop-in-a-blender, avant-supreme, workingman's hyped-up rock band in the early
    80's in Japan.  Although their earliest stuff is rather blunt, it does offer
    quite a few options for anyone tired of, well, everything.  The music is not
    so much tuneful as painful.  It is, at once, full of zest and bravado, and
    sometimes just stupid.  <i>Onanie Bomb Meets Sex Pistols</i> (which contained
    their first two Japanese releases) hit American shores in 1989; some were
    shocked at the level of idiocy and destructive tendencies in the music, while
    others just looked at song titles like ""Anal Eater"" and ""Lick 'm Cock Boatpeople""
    and turned the other cheeks.  Of course, most people didn't notice, and it's
    something of a shame because the world hadn't seen such a good No Wave act
    since Suicide's Martin Rev spit on his first fan.</p><p>
    
    The band responded to their nay-sayers by acting as if nothing ever happened,
    and in turn attracted such Yankee luminaries as John Zorn and Thurston Moore.
    For some reason, the band seemed to appeal more to the experimental audience
    than any others, and when it came time to book the second stage at the second
    Lollapalooza, Boredoms got their first real American props.  It was good timing,
    as Warner Brothers was releasing the band's third album, 1993's <i>Pop Tatari</i>,
    which <i>Spin</i> called the most non-commercial album ever released by a major
    label.  I suppose the band trusted <i>Spin</i> about as much as I do, because
    their next album, 1994's <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i>, was even more of a slap
    in the face to anyone who ever struggled to get signed to a major than <i>Tatari</i>
    was.  It seemed that there was no end to their persistent, uncommonly
    devastative music.</p><p>
    
    Then, there was an end.  In 1993, the band had recorded a seemingly one-off EP
    entitled <i>Super Roots</i>.  Its music, and that of the limited edition
    follow-up, 1994's <i>Super Roots 2</i>, were basically extensions of their
    by-then familiar avant-punk.  But just after <i>Synthesizer</i>, they released
    part three in the series, which consisted of but one tune, 33 minutes in length.
    The track was really just a hardcore punk song, but it stretched out over the
    length of a sitcom, and without any breaks, save a two-minute moment of silence
    at the end.  It was an interesting idea, and one they built upon with <i>Super
    Roots 5</i>, extending the tune to 65 minutes.  Of course, the sheer monolithic
    nature of playing punk for half an hour didn't win many new fans.</p><p>
    
    The most obvious change in Boredoms' philosophy came from around 1996, when they
    released <i>Super Roots 6</i>.  Unlike anything they had ever done, it featured
    low key, mostly instrumental tunes influenced more by Can and Neu than hardcore
    punk.  Additionally, unlike all but the first in this series, it was released
    in America, which meant that anyone with a Blockbuster on their corner and
    $12 could get in on the ground floor of Boredoms, mark II.</p><p>
    
    Before most folks had time to digest the new direction (and to be fair, Boredoms
    are still more than a little obscure), the band changed sounds again.  <i>Super
    Roots 7</i> was released in Japan in 1998, and expanded the band's arsenal to
    include the blissfully psychedelic and all that is trippy.  It wasn't trance,
    but it could bring you to the same place, and it was certainly more inviting
    than anything they'd ever released before.  Soon after, they released the
    acclaimed <i>Super Ae</i>, and have since been stuck in a rather wonderful
    looping system of sun worship and general repentance for all the damage they'd
    done the previous 15 years.</p><p>
<i>Vision Creation Newsun</i> came out in Japan in late '99, and was released in
    America the following year.  For anyone unaware, it was something of a refinement
    of the hard trance Boredoms explored on <i>Super Roots 7</i> and <i>Ae</i>, taken
    to its seemingly logical conclusion.  Yamatsuka Eye, possessing an affinity for
    underground DJ culture, had some of the Boredoms' stuff remixed by various big
    names (including U.N.K.L.E. and DJ Krush), but apparently wanted to try his hand
    at the game himself.  <i>Rebore Vol. 0</i> is Eye's remix of <i>Vision Creation
    Newsun</i>, and helps make the case that Boredoms are one of the great bands of
    the rock era.</p><p>
    
    The track titles are as follows: ""7,"" ""77,"" ""777,"" ""7777,"" ""77777,"" ""777777,""
    and ""7777777.""  For clarity (or because I can't process more than four numbers
    at a time), I won't reference songs by name.  This should be okay, as the spirit
    of the record, similar to recent efforts, lies in the whole as opposed to the
    individual.  It follows the track order from <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>, so
    anyone familiar with that album should be fine-- not that chronology has ever
    been a major player in Boredoms' music.</p><p>
    
    The album begins with something of a fanfare, but there are certainly no trumpets
    to announce the arrival of this ship.  Something like looped war cries (it sounds
    like drummer Yoshimi, but you never know) resonate over whirlpool reverb and the
    future shock of congas spliced with dial tone hum.  Phased guitars and maraca
    treatises come in and out of the mix, but over its almost nine-minute duration,
    the overwhelming feeling is of takeoff-- like a rocket without a rudder, and the
    final frontier nothing but a prologue.</p><p>
    
    Once airborne, we're offered any number of puffy, articulate hors d'oeuvres,
    courtesy of Seiichi Yamamoto's guitar and subtle synth.  Eye's remix tends to
    favor what seemed superficial on <i>Newsun</i>.  Most of the pounding percussion
    has been removed and remodeled to suit the aims of the new breed: reverb, flange,
    delay, the cut and pasted-- in short, the electronic and altered rather than
    anything natural.  This may be my only complaint with the album; chiefly that
    while I always enjoy a good trip over the moon, a little earthbound warmth might
    have been nice.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, we have intrusive drum machines making waste of whatever seams had
    been left untouched.  In another corner is acoustic guitar and light cymbal,
    left to dry in the sun as if Pro Tools had never happened.  I thought I heard an
    uttering baby in there somewhere, but I'm sure Eye wouldn't subject an infant to
    this kind trip, lest it come back older than Einstein.  Despite the fact that
    the tracks here are broken up (unlike <i>Newsun</i>'s continuous program), the
    arc of the journey is intact, and anyone who gives an album like this half a
    chance will probably come out slightly changed.</p><p>
<i>Rebore Vol. 0</i> (subtitled <i>Vision Recreation</i>) ends similarly to how
    it began, with blaring rocket engines and vacuum echo.  Of course, the journey
    back down is invariably more comfortable, if only because you know you're back
    home again.  (Most people probably weren't meant for extended periods in outer
    space.)  Practically speaking, I would recommend this album (despite its hefty
    import price tag) with the caveat that if you aren't a Boredoms freak, or at
    least interested in their recent stuff, you might want to start with one of the
    proper releases.  However, there's a part of me that wants to throw this upon
    unsuspecting masses, to people who aren't normally accustomed to long bouts with
    insanity.  It's beautiful in its way, but for me, it's more of an exploratory
    thing.  Boredoms have come a long way over the years, and that they often push
    forward at the expense of public acceptance or even familiarity might be reason
    enough to coast alongside for as long as you're able.</p></div>"|865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/865-rebore-vol-0-vision-recreation/|8.4|Dominique Leone

After he cut his first demo with producer
    Pierre Marchand, his father, Canadian folk giant Loudon Wainwright III, passed
    it on to legendary arranger Van Dyke Parks, who in turn saw that it found its
    way to Dreamworks executive Lenny Waronker.  With a simple glance at the
    Dreamworks logo on the back of <i>Poses</i>, I trust you can connect the dots
    for yourself.  If only it could be that easy for everyone, right?</p><p>
    
    Oh, wait.  I guess I forgot to mention that Rufus Wainwright deserves it.  On
    his 1998 self-titled debut, Wainwright managed to pull together myriad strands
    and meld them into a grand, cohesive vision.  And now, with <i>Poses</i>, he
    takes that vision and refines it, resulting in an epic album that speaks with
    grand gestures and a refined eloquence rare in young songwriters.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it never hurts to have a killer cast of collaborators to help you
    achieve your vision, and Wainwright has certainly assembled one for this record.
    Drummer Jim Keltner (Elvis Costello, Ry Cooder) returns on the traps, trading
    off spots with Victor Indrizzo (Chris Cornell, Redd Kross).  Paul Weller cohort
    Pete Wilson mans the bass, and Dennis Farias (Burt Bacharach) provides colorful
    trumpet accents.  Propellerhead Alex Gifford, Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams, Robyn
    Hitchcock), and  Damian LeGassick (Blur) combine for production that veers
    effortlessly from the dark strings of ""Evil Angel"" to the beat-infused ""Tower
    of Learning,"" and widely across a lot of terrain in between.</p><p>
<i>Poses</i> opens and closes with the Tin Pan Alley tribute ""Cigarettes and
    Chocolate Milk,"" recalling some of the Divine Comedy's more playful moments
    with its ode to subtle addictions and the way our compulsions rule our lives
    (""If I should buy jellybeans/ I have to eat them all in just one sitting"").
    In between, we get everything from a Ouija board session with the ghost of
    Jeff Buckley (""The Consort"") to the faithful and endearing cover of Loudon's
    classic ""One Man Guy"" that proves Rufus has at least a touch of dad's folk
    roots in him.</p><p>
    
    The album's title track stands as one of Wainwright's finest songs, with an
    aching melody and Spartan piano backing.  It also illustrates how far his voice
    has come since his debut.  He's become far more expressive in the last few years
    and his voice is a bit less of an acquired taste than it used to be.  The funky
    ""Shadows"" is coated in thickly layered vocal harmonies that betray a definite
    debt to vocal jazz, though the swelling strings might sound a little more at
    home on the <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> soundtrack.  Still, it's pretty fantastic
    stuff, and Rufus takes pains to breathe life into his Frankensteins, never
    letting them degenerate into limp genre exercises.</p><p>
    
    ""Tower of Learning"" is more impressive still, opening wide up in the second
    verse over programmed beats in an arrangement that looms over the rest of the
    album. Barring the reprise of ""Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,"" <i>Poses</i> is
    closed on a somber note with the beautifully simple ""In a Graveyard,"" a soulful
    reflection on moribund themes that momentarily leaves the oboes and strings at
    the door for a direct heart-to-heart with the listener.</p><p>
    
    It's always refreshing to see a recording this singular find its way out the
    door of a major label, and it's heartening to know that Wainwright probably has
    a secure home at Dreamworks.  With <i>Poses</i>, he proves that he's swinging
    for the big leagues, and that he has every right to be there.</p></div>"|8557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8557-poses/|8.6|Joe Tangari

    I was lost in reverie. I had a little fantasy, a daydream if you will:</p><p>
    
    It's late on a Thursday night in 1984.  Los Angeles.  Grace Slick, Mickey Thomas
    and the gang are holding a band meeting. You see, founding member Paul Kanter
    has just flown the coup, and the boys (and girl) of Jefferson Starship are in
    the midst of an identity crisis. After much heated debate (mostly surrounding
    the whereabouts of the requisite band meeting cocaine supply), they decide to
    get back to their roots-- which involves foregoing the nose candy in favor of
    large quantities of weed, hallucinogens, and beer.</p><p>
    
    So, the ol' hooka is dusted off, an RCA label lackey goes out back to pick some
    shrooms from the garden, and bassist Pete Sears whips out his old pal Lucky the
    Psychedelic Toad from the codpiece of his buckskin trousers. Before long, things
    start getting pretty ""cosmic"" and the band decides to strap on their gear and
    see what happens.  And it's all good and mellow until Lucky decides to take a
    swim in Grace's beer mug, unbeknownst to her.  Bad vibes commence.</p><p>
    
    ""Paul!!!  Paul, where are you?!?,"" Grace howls in her operatic tenor. ""I'm
    cruising through the universe on Starship Beer! I'm knee deep in the hoopla! I'm
    cruising the universe in Starship Beer, knee deep in the hoopla!""</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the whole band starts freaking out. Drummer Danny Baldwin starts
    hitting everything in sight, whether it's part of his kit or not, and everyone
    else pretty much ditches their main instruments for piano, recorders, clarinets,
    and organ.  Somebody even finds a shortwave radio and starts screwing with it.
    Suddenly, the spirit of Albert Ayler enters the room to conduct the whole mad
    orchestra.</p><p>
    
    A week passes before the next band meeting. This time, things go more smoothly.
    The cocaine supply has been replenished, and they all have a good laugh at what
    happened the week before. ""That silly Grace, what a card,"" they say. As an
    in-joke they decide to name their next album <i>Knee Deep in the Hoopla</i>:
    Grace's bad trip will be a symbol of their rebirth. What's more, they decide to
    change the band's name from Jefferson Starship to Starship Beer to cement their
    commitment to their bold new musical direction.</p><p>
    
    But after a ""reality check"" with label execs, the whole plan is scrapped. It's
    decided that the bandname will simply be shortened to Starship so as not to
    confuse people. They're allowed to keep the album title, as it has a certain
    schmaltzy, vaguely blue-collar ring to it that will appeal to a broad range of
    everyday working class joes.  But instead of avant-skronk freakout, the band
    goes with plan b, spewing forth ""We Built this City"" and ""Sara.""</p><p>
    
    The good news is that some far-sighted studio intern had the smarts to roll tape
    during the Starship Beer sessions, and now we can all bear witness to this
    anomalous wrinkle in musical history.  Unfortunately, none of this is true.
    Well, except for the description of the music.</p><p>
    
    In reality, Starship Beer first took flight (forgive me) in the early 70s though
    most of the material on <i>Nut Music: As Free as the Squirrels</i> was recorded
    and released in limited quantities in late 1979. The band is comprised of a core
    trio of Wes Mingin, Pat O'Brien, and Kevin Whitehead, the latter eventually
    becoming a jazz critic for NPR's Fresh Air. They banded together while students
    at upstate New York's Oswego State, and have performed off and on ever since.
    This reissue, dug up as part of Atavistic's Unheard Music Series, contains four
    bonus tracks-- two from the 70s, two from the 80s-- making it a must for the
    Starship Beer completist in your family.</p><p>
    
    On the lead-off track, ""Black/White White/Black,"" the band tests the limits of
    listenability with a jive-poetry rant that owes more than a little to Captain
    Beefheart: ""I got black pants/ I got black shoes/ I got white shirt/ I got white
    sunglasses.../ And when I walk out the door, my eyes begin to fall like rain.""
    The rest of the song is made up of variations on these bare statements, while a
    bass and an electric guitar chase each other around.</p><p>
    
    The next hour or so is all over the place: solo piano meanderings, extemporaneous
    verse, honking clarinets, feedback assault, all apparently improvised. It all
    pretty much falls into the category Lester Bangs termed ""horrible noise,"" meaning
    it's pretty good if you're like me and are into this kinda nonsense. Still, I
    guarantee that you'll listen to this no more than twice: once for your own
    enlightenment, and once again when someone sees it in your collection and says,
    ""What the hell is Starship Beer?""  At which point you have my permission to tell
    them a little story about Grace Slick and company.</p></div>"|7482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7482-nut-music-as-free-as-the-squirrels/|6.5|Jason Nickey

    Germany. Home to the collective of labels known as Hausmusik, Payola and Kollaps,
    the number of groups from this area south of Munich has multiplied spectacularly
    in the past decade. To name only a few: The Notwist, Tied and Tickled Trio,
    Village of Savoonga, Fred is Dead, Couch, Console, and A Million Mercies.  Some
    of these bands are better known than others, but each functions within the often
    incestuous Weilheim framework.  Now we can add Thomas Weber's Kammerflimmer
    Kollektief (Shimmering Collective) to that list.</p><p>
    Begun in the late 90s as an electro-acoustic one-man project incorporating
    electronic sound constructions into both the rock and jazz idioms, Weber
    initially released two limited-run 12"" singles for the Weilheim-based Payola
    label in 1998 (both of which were collected on their debut full-length,
    <i>Mäander</i>, last year). Approximating the free jazz of the late 60's
    (John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Peter Brötzmann as reference points) and
    blending it with traditional rock structures, Kammerflimmer astounded, and
    marked new territory for the German scene. Tracks like ""Implodiert"" and
    ""Nachtwach"" were rhythmically explosive; anchored by Weber's bass and working
    around a slow-building hiss of electronics, they would eventually careen into
    a climax of ear-splitting dissonance and static.  With those releases and
    subsequent works-- an incredible remix of Tied and Tickled Trio's ""Constant""
    and the strictly jazz <i>Incommunicado</i>, which is just seeing U.S. release
    this month through Temporary Residence-- Weber carved his own niche within
    the minds of a select few record aficionados around the globe.</p><p>
    With this, the Kollektief's third release in a year, the sense of surging
    immediacy so prevalent on the initial releases has been abandoned in favor of
    subtlety and suggestive soundscapes. Weber expanded the collective to a
    six-piece with the jazz workout of <i>Incommunicado</i>, and that lineup
    sticks around for <i>Hysteria</i> as well. Clocking in at barely over thirty
    minutes, the newest release plays more like an EP.  Reserving three of the six
    tracks for his solo sonic experiments, Weber plays along with the other members
    on three group songs. After just one listen, it becomes quickly apparent that
    Weber functions much better on his own than within the group context.</p><p>
    Kammerflimmer begins the album in a haze with the title track. Built around his
    electronic treatments and the plucked strings of an upright bass, the lead track
    buzzes with Weber's signature sound-- a high-pitched burst of static noise that
    weaves in and out of the background. Weber's ability to take inorganic sound
    treatments and effortlessly blend them with traditional instrumentation has
    been one of the most captivating elements of the music he produces. At times
    reminiscent of Scenic's <i>Acquatica</i>, the standout track (""Engel Wacht"")
    is Weber working solo again.  Pulling together the sound of wind chimes, distant
    percussion, and (surprise!) sudden but effective bursts of static, Weber
    constructs a beautiful track built around mournful guitar playing.</p><p>
    ""Seen (Not Seen)"" follows the title track and, with it comes the full band's
    first attempt at exhibiting their skills (or lack thereof).  With very few of
    Weber's treatments, the track is contingent upon the unit's ability to coalesce
    into a whole.  Comprised of alto and baritone saxes, guitar, bass, analog synth
    and percussion along with Weber's sound collages, <i>Hysteria</i>'s musical
    landscape should be comparable to what Weber was doing all by his lonesome three
    years ago. Regrettably, on their new release, Weber's acoustic jazz ensemble
    rarely achieves anything more than aimless meandering.</p><p>
    The near exception is
    ""Mohn!"" (loose translation: ""poppy""), the album's closing track, and the one in
    which the group finally proves they might actually be able to bring it all
    together into something more than just the sum of their individual parts.
    Evocative of urban nightscapes, the track is similar to ""Engel Wacht"" but
    doesn't work nearly as well.  Bassist Johannes Frisch lays the groundwork for
    the other musicians, but no other player ever steps forward to lead, including
    Weber. Clocking in at nearly six minutes, the track finally gets exciting with
    about 20 seconds left when Weber's electronically manipulated guitar enters the
    picture. And then, as abruptly as the excitement began, it ends.
    On <i>Hysteria</i>, it feels like Kammerflimmer Kollektief never really get off
    the ground. There's a stark contrast between the tracks on which Weber plays
    exclusively and those on which the group plays. The decision to divide the tracks
    equally between the two only exaggerates the differences. Much of Weber's solo
    tracks are satisfying, but the group's work feels like sonic doodling, never
    really quite hitting the mark.</p><p>
    The finest moments, bleak and desolate, stand at odds with Weber's prior recorded
    output. Much of the stuff on <i>Mäander</i> brimmed with energy and playfulness
    (sheets of static fuzz thrown in with rhythmic, percussive explosions and
    fractured saxophone squawks), something desperately needed on <i>Hysteria</i>.
    Tied and Tickled Trio keyboardist Andreas Gerth once said, ""It's true that all
    the music coming from [Weilheim] seems touched by a certain melancholia."" Up until
    now I could've disagreed based solely on Kammerflimmer Kollektief's catalog, but
    now even Thomas Weber exhibits a tinge of that autumnal feel.  Unfortunately, the
    melancholy that's worked so well for others in the Weilheim musical landscape
    renders the Shimmering Collective motionless and uninspired.</p></div>"|4381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4381-hysteria/|5.0|Luke Buckman

Literate but cumbersome album title?  Check.  Serpentine and
    repetitive instrumentals?  Check.  Clinical substitution of Roman numerals for
    song titles?  Check.  Cred to burn, gleaned largely from band members' obscure
    but locally heroic previous outfits?  Check.  The symptoms leave little room for
    interpretation. All signs point to post-rock.</p><p>
    
    You've probably heard this one: three guys encounter a steaming pile of shit in
    the middle of the sidewalk and stop dead in their tracks. One says, ""Hmm. Do you
    think that's shit?"" First guy bends over a takes a whiff: ""Smells like shit,""
    he says. Second guy pokes at it a few times before mashing his palm in the pile:
    ""Sure feels like shit,"" he decides. Third guy takes a pinch of it to his tongue:
    ""Man, this tastes like shit! Guys, I think this is definitely shit!"" First one
    says, ""Whoa, it's a good thing we didn't step in it.""</p><p>
    
    Upon first encountering it, Lumen's <i>The Man Felt an Iron Hand</i> smells,
    feels and tastes just like a steaming pile of post-rock. But I stepped in it
    anyway.</p><p>
    
    Fionic as it sounds, Lumen's lengthy (and elegantly violent) album title is
    actually cribbed straight from a short story by one of the twentieth century's
    most inventive fabulists, the late Italo Calvino-- ""The Mine Fields,"" from
    <i>Difficult Loves</i>.  Superfluous, perhaps, but at least it isn't some
    cocktail napkin dreck.  And Lumen does indeed feature members of two noted San
    Francisco post-rock combos, A Minor Forest and Tarantel. And they have indeed
    foregone track titles for their complex and warmly engaging debut. But looks and
    smells can be deceiving. Something about <i>The Man Felt an Iron Hand</i> evades
    the harmless academics that have come to serve as the signature of the post-rock
    non-genre.  Something like prog.</p><p>
<i>The Man Felt an Iron Hand</i> is largely acoustic, dominated by guitars and
    accordions; keyboards color the spaces between, while the drumming is absolutely
    berserk. The guitars on ""I"" owe more to the ecstatic meandering of John Fahey
    than the dour meditations of Aerial M-- reckless, exotic and free. The fat
    organs pulse and splash with an almost psych-bluesy swagger. Beneath them, the
    percussion seems possessed: rocking frenetically between John Bonham and Rasheed
    Ali. The music sounds like a skeletal prog-rock: wooden and spare, but no less
    grand.</p><p>
    
    ""II"" manages to conjure the loping medievalism that has become the butt of all
    Canterbury prog jokes. But for all the churchy organs and lute-like guitars,
    there isn't an ounce of wank to be had. Perhaps it's the fierce drums that
    manage to keep the edge on Lumen razor sharp; on paper it reads like a lull,
    but somehow the music always manages to shred a bit like the man in the title.
    Yet ""VII"" succeeds without any percussion at all; it pits the minimal guitars
    against each other to drone and drift like layers of a Reich piece, alternately
    dissonant and complimentary. Somehow, Lumen makes experimentation sound sweet
    and almost comforting.</p><p>
    
    So pick it up and eat it. <i>The Man Felt an Iron Hand</i> isn't what you think
    it is.  Yes, it's dressed like post-rock, but its soul is prog and its balls are
    metal. For a moment you're surprised that it's not content to serve as sonic
    wallpaper. Where do these guys get off?  There's an ambition and aggression to
    Lumen that so much contemporary instrumental rock has lost. Besides, Jim O'Rourke's
    nowhere to be found on it. And you're tracking it all over the carpet.</p></div>"|4913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4913-the-man-felt-an-iron-hand-grab-him-by-the-hair-at-the-nape-not-one-hand-a-hundred-hands-seized-him-each-by-the-hair-and-tore-him-head-to-foot-the-way-you-tear-up-a-sheet-of-paper-into-hundreds-of-little-pieces/|8.0|Brent S.

    and Yale Delay.  Let the record show, they're crazy for palindromes.  It's odd
    that they revere such a balanced form of wordplay, though-- their sound sprawls
    in all directions, a cacophony that attempts to dance.</p><p>
    Let me throw out some band combinations: Bis and Trans Am. Robert Smith and the
    Happy Mondays.  Grandaddy, Sonic Youth, and the B-52's.  Brilliance, mess and
    mud.  But what IfiHadAHiFi sounds most like is a louder, bitchier Clinic. They're
    not as good, and they're sloppier, but they muster the same excitement. ""The All
    Tied Up,"" <i>Ones and Zeroes</i>' opening track, begins with a particularly
    Clinical feel, with its drumrolls and muted synthesizers, and a guitar that
    introduces a clanking funk.</p><p>
    But this band is both more conventional and more
    all-over-the-place.  While Clinic gives the impression that anything can happen,
    IfiHadAHiFi's aesthetic announces that everything will happen, all the time.
    Almost martial call-and-response chants and whoops are buried under perpetually
    spinning synth squiggles, raucous guitars and rock/funk rhythms. The sound
    buzzes with layers, with the layers sometimes losing out to the buzz as the
    recording process is overwhelmed.</p><p>
    ""The All Tied Up"" flows directly into ""(This is) The New Science,"" one of the
    cleanest tracks, and the one that should be the model for what the band does
    henceforth. A synth whirls by like a fan flying off its axle, its blades made
    of singing swords. A succession of chants and the ubiquitous ""woo-hoo's"" build
    to the title refrain. Chaos slowly dominates as the band sings assertive
    ba-babba-labba's until a wash of noise overtakes them.</p><p>
    The third track is the first mistake.  All the layers and chaos are pushed down
    under a kitschy cliché: an old announcer's voice describing rudimentary dance
    technique. It's an awful choice-- one that similarly mars ""Tanguska-Electro,"" a
    tune about the great inventor Tesla's attempt to create a death ray. Singing
    about a death ray is sufficient; having some cornball announcer tell us what the
    song we can no longer hear is about is egregiously wrong. It's the kind of move
    that makes me less forgiving of the muddiness. (In the album credits, mixing is
    listed as by ""consensus,"" either a bad technician with a bad showbiz name, or
    more likely, a horrible way to mix an album. ""Make my part louder!"")</p><p>
    ""One Happy Pussycat"" plays its vocals, if not everything else, at a slower speed,
    with not much else to balance the track. ""I just want to love you, baby,"" the
    singer croaks. It sounds like the creepy voice at the end of <i>The Virgin
    Suicides</i> soundtrack getting delusions of Barry White, or like failing
    batteries on a walkman.</p><p>
    But for all its mistakes, the whirling madness of most of these songs is
    undeniable. This is the other IDM: Insane Dance Music. Instead of shaking it to
    processed slices of digital glory, people should be staggering around in
    confusion, their minds disabled by the very live sound this band makes.  Still,
    if the band could clean up their sound a little and avoid the overdubbed
    announcer guys, they could stand to be an important band.  Or at least a lot of
    fun.</p></div>"|4066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4066-ones-and-zeroes/|7.5|Dan Kilian

Appliance's
    previous releases, <i>Manual</i> and <i>Six Modular Pieces</i>, got on my nerves
    with their blatant conformance to the post-rock blueprint: two parts early
    Stereolab, two parts Sonic Youth, two parts Tubeway Army-by-way-of-Trans Am,
    and a dash of Plone/Broadcast bitters.  It sounded like a style-mag committee
    drummed up the concepts, and negotiated to do away with the band's energy to
    make room for blank posturing.</p><p>
    Thankfully, with <i>Imperial Metric</i>, Appliance have redeemed themselves, an
    album that, while stylish, never seemed coutured. The band have created a
    fascinating blend of post-punk dub, primitive electronics, and Soviet-menace
    nostalgia.  It could have been so hokey!  But Appliance keep a straight face
    throughout and their expressionist devices overdriving throughout.</p><p>
    Beginning with a concrète squiggle, ""Separate Animals"" soon finds its solid
    squelch groove, as vocalist/guitarist James Brooks growls, ""You live on the
    left/ Your mind is on the right/ The city's full of people/ You're speaking to
    the speaker.""  While Brooks develops this bipolar theme, the rest of the band
    sets the synths to gloomily pound and squirm.  If they weren't so serious about
    it, you could call it camp.</p><p>
    A muted trumpet delivers a twisted reveille call at the opening of ""Map of
    the Territory,"" and a Jason Pierce-emulating Brooks delivers a darkly blessed
    warning that ""silence has left a hole wider than a mile.""  Amidst all these
    mechanical prophecies, Brooks plucks away at a crippled guitar figure tormented
    by trumpet.  ""F.L.F. (Precious Bodily Fluids)"" is an altogether more peaceful
    affair, which could be nicely reworked for the glitch-tech crowds that bug out
    to Herbert's <i>Bodily Functions</i>.</p><p>
    ""Land, Sea and Air"" rocks back and forth on muscled heels.  Here, Brooks' guitar
    recalls Bunnymen guitarist Will Sergeant in his vintage <i>Crocodiles</i> era--
    though blips and burps attempt to bury him, Brooks is unwavering in his
    commitment.  The instrumental ""Comrades (in a Moscow Hotel)"" is ironically
    calming by comparison. But beneath the pads and aloof percussion, there lurks
    a John LeCarré paranoia.</p><p>
    Appliance lose their footing with ""H2O.""  The track which opens with the same
    rushing glisten that haunted Björk's ""Hunter,"" but collapses when Brooks sings
    about the ""H2O in his mouth running low"" and ""on his skin, running dry, running
    thin."" Drummer Dave Ireland gamely tries to distract us from the overwrought
    lyrics by thumping the daylight out of his kit in a passable homage to Death in
    Vegas' ""Aisha."" Unfortunately, the serial murdering character Iggy Pop portrayed
    on that track wasn't around to round off the effect.</p><p>
    While the instrumental ""Skylight"" sounds like an Air remix of Public Image Ltd's
    ""Careering,"" ""AM/PM"" gives bassist Stuart Christie an opportunity to showcase
    his Peter Hook-like talent as various analog effects thread around him and
    Berlin-period Bowie synth washes settle a polluting pall over Brooks' dejected
    vocals (""Well, I'm falling down/ I couldn't try/ You and me/ It's a fine line"").
    ""Navigating the Nursery Slope"" is <i>Electricity</i>-era OMD propelled by Neu!'s
    signature motorik rhythm.</p><p>
    After the Spacemen 3-style narco-lullaby of ""A Gentle Cycle Revolution"" and the
    Augustus Pablo-meets-New Order sound of ""Navigating the Nursery Slopes,"" the
    album settles into slumberous quiescence with ""Where Has the Space Race
    Gone?,"" the epitome of Cold War nostalgia.  Here, Appliance reference every
    theme they've developed over the course of <i>Imperial Metric</i> in an eight
    minute instrumental recalling the second side of Bowie's <i>Low</i>.  That icy
    bliss stills the album at its close, and we leave Appliance certain that they've
    escaped the foul-ups of their past. By saturating themselves in the
    stealth-and-bunker, spy-counter-spy politics of the mid-to-late twentieth
    century, and the skeletal electronics of that wary era, Appliance consummately
    fulfill their potential.</p></div>"|265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/265-imperial-metric/|7.8|Paul Cooper

It's common logic that the
    things that get said the most seem to ring the most true. But when you've heard
    them enough, they simply fail to resonate.  Sometimes, it takes someone who seems
    more than a little bit fucked up to see past the countless clichés of rock music
    and come through with something distinctive and original.</p><p>
    Isaac Brock has always possessed a twisted and brilliant type of insight, both
    in his lyrics and in the way he presents them.  Take ""Dramamine,"" the very first
    song off of Modest Mouse's very first full-length. With that song, Brock penned
    one of the most memorable, oddly insightful lyrics of all time: ""We kiss on the
    mouth but still cough down our sleeves."" Sung in a whiny nasal voice over
    acoustic guitar strumming, the lyric would have been nothing short of painful.
    But Brock blurts it out with helpless but violent disgust, and somehow, it seems
    more like a spontaneous thought than like a line some hipster poet wrote in his
    lyrics journal.</p><p>
    Modest Mouse, in their beginnings, were largely preoccupied with the perception
    of motion and isolation.  Especially with <i>This is a Long Drive for Someone
    with Nothing to Think About</i>, and the early singles that would later become
    <i>Building Nothing out of Something</i>, the band managed to accomplish what is
    perhaps one of the most sanctified goals of the musician: to provide a sonic
    analog for visual and kinetic sensations.</p><p>
    Last year, on their third proper album, the band seriously altered what
    sensations they were trying to approximate, focusing less on the thoughts one
    might have while sitting in the backseat of a poorly air-conditioned sedan, and
    more on thoughts of death and the nature of the universe. Thankfully, the scope
    of their sound expanded in kind, resulting in the sweeping, gorgeous <i>The Moon
    and Antarctica</i>.</p><p>
<i>Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks</i>, which consists of the four tracks
    from the <i>Night on the Sun</i> 12"" and four additional tracks, would have been
    a perfectly logical precursor to <i>The Moon and Antarctica</i>. Part dreamy
    existential reflection and part steady, chugging highway soundtrack, the eight
    songs on this EP capture bits and pieces of all eras of Modest Mouse's sound,
    without ever quite achieving the coherency of any of them.</p><p>
    Four of the tracks on <i>Everywhere</i> have already been reviewed by Pitchfork,
    but it seems appropriate now to just reiterate how excellent some of them are.
    ""Night on the Sun"" and ""You're the Good Things"" (originally released on <i>Night
    on the Sun</i>) are the two great tracks this disc has to offer.  The former
    stands right up there with any of the band's best album cuts, managing to be
    both catchy and immensely disconcerting. Lyrically bizarre and alternatingly
    sparse and dense, musically, ""Night on the Sun"" encapsulates the best of early
    and late Modest Mouse. ""You're the Good Things"" uses the classic Modest Mouse
    formula of gradually getting more intense and primal as the song progresses, to
    great effect.</p><p>
    ""Willful Suspension of Disbelief,"" the weakest of the three non-album <i>Night
    on the Sun</i> tracks, seems just a bit too comfortable sticking to its one-chord
    shuffle. Spooky, reverb-soaked guitars draw streaks of spooky discordance through
    an already otherworldly mix. But the song itself still suffers from a lack of
    change.</p><p>
    And then there are the new tracks. A snippet of ""3 Inch Horses, Two-Faced Monsters""
    appears at the end of ""A Different City"" on <i>The Moon and Antarctica</i>, and on
    <i>Everywhere</i>, we finally get to experience the song in its full fiddle-toting
    glory. With a little help from Califone's Tim Rutilli, ""3 Inch Horses, Two Faced
    Monsters"" is probably the closest thing to back-country folk music Modest Mouse
    has ever recorded. With Brian Deck at the mixer, though, it winds up sounding
    like back-country folk from beyond the grave. Sadly, ""3 Inch Horses"" is really
    just the same thing repeating itself over and over again, and unquestionably
    outstays its welcome at over four minutes.</p><p>
    ""So Much Beauty in Dirt,"" and its more stripped-down counterpart, ""Here It Comes,""
    both suffer from being insanely repetitive without benefiting from the kind of
    subtle song development that we've come to expect from Modest Mouse. As if that
    weren't enough, the former also suffers from being almost tragically awkward.</p><p>
    But then there's ""The Air,"" an odd four-plus minute instrumental that basically
    serves to show off the fact that, hey, Brian Deck is a really fucking good
    producer.  The song samples instrumentation and effects from the <i>Moon and
    Antarctica</i> sessions and reassembles them into a strange, ethereal series of
    triggered loops and spacious hums that somehow sounds more organic than
    electronic.  And of course, ""I Came as a Rat"" makes another gratuitous appearance
    here, just as it did on <i>Night on the Sun</i>.</p><p>
    Given that ""I Came as Rat"" appears in identical form to the <i>Moon and Antarctica</i>
    version, and that the two best songs on this EP were already released on an
    earlier 12"", it's hard to fully embrace <i>Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour
    Tricks</i>.  (Don't even get me started on the title.)  If you didn't get a
    chance to pick up <i>Night on the Sun</i>, or if you're a hardcore vinyl-hater,
    <i>Everywhere</i> is worth it simply for its two best tracks. Otherwise, be
    advised that <i>Everywhere</i> essentially plays out as throwaways from <i>The
    Moon and Antarctica</i>.</p></div>"|5360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5360-everywhere-and-his-nasty-parlour-tricks-ep/|7.8|Matt LeMay

Check out owner Mike Cloward's
    history of the company on their website.  They publish a print magazine, <i>DIW</i>,
    which features contributions from notables such as John Vanderslice, and they
    review lots of bands that aren't on their label.  And guess what icon the review
    section uses for ratings: Pitchforks!  Aside from the long-lost ivory bust of
    Ryan Schreiber, what greater tribute to the 'Fork could you ask for?</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, I can't quite decide what rating to give <i>Northern Electric</i>.
    Cruiser don't quite merit a Pitchfork-waving salute, but I can't skewer them on
    the end of the sharp blades, either.  The seven-piece ensemble of Scots play
    fuzzy shoegazer pop with a twist.  Surprise: they add electronic beats!  Like
    Laika!  This, unfortunately, is part of the problem.</p><p>
    
    The album opener, ""Personality: Goes a Long Way,"" starts with scratching noises
    and bowed violin.  Cue next the distorted guitar haze and drum loops, which
    thump in a crude, almost militaristic pattern.  The melody makes for cutesy pop,
    as do the predictably understated female vocals.  Singer Caroline Barber leaves
    subtle trace of her Scottish accent when she repeats, ""Things are never the same
    as before"" over and over again.  She's wrong, though-- at least in regards to
    the song.  It sounds nice but there's little ingenuity, reminding me most of a
    Polara album whose title is the exact opposite of its content:
    <i>Formless/Functional</i>.</p><p>
    
    Similarly, Cruiser's problem is that their beats are too structured and
    repetitious.  The Chemical Brothers-style breakbeat of ""Blown,"" for instance,
    bludgeons you with its obviousness throughout the song, and the ""Sesame Street""
    melody that chimes along doesn't help.  ""Hardly Even Here"" mixes its percussive
    wallop more carefully with the sweet, dense hum of guitar and keyboards,
    incubating a frozen <i>Dots and Loops</i>-period Stereolab embryo.  But the
    beats never transcend decorative status, and the grooves lack the requisite
    amount of bass and vigor to be conventionally danceable.  By the time you reach
    the wannabe-Bows spoken word of ""Air Ecosse,"" the only thing shaking might be
    your head.</p><p>
    
    ""International Space Station"" stands out amongst these drowsy daydreams.  The
    Richard D. James-patented thoom-chiks actually cycle in a progression, filling
    in the gaps between ringing guitar and cello-- and when they fade out, leaving
    only an echoing piano, you'll miss them.  But the latter half of the album
    proves that Cruiser sound best when their more organic elements take forefront.
    Here, the beats exist only as simple drum-machine tracks that don't overpower
    the atmospheric e-bows and delay pedals.  The title song is a particularly
    beautiful example.  And now that she can be heard, Barber's voice provides a
    soft, pleasing counterpoint to the banjo strums and brass backing.</p><p>
    
    But the other problem lies in the production.  Rather than an overpowering wave
    of sonic force, all of the songs on <i>Northern Electric</i> are trapped behind
    a blurry wall of sound.  The muted effect makes it difficult to hear the
    individual timbres of the instruments spread throughout, including harmonium,
    mandolin and glockenspiel.  If Cruiser could program more detailed electronic
    interventions and avoid (or amplify) the muddy noise of the mastering work,
    they might record a really striking album.  They have any number of examples to
    choose from-- the flawless integration of drum-n-bass and ethereality on Love
    Spirals Downward's <i>Flux</i> is just one.  As it is, <i>Northern Electric</i>'s
    wintry atmospheres are like being a passenger in a car hugging the curves of a
    rural road in the midst of a December storm: you don't feel protected by the
    window separating you from the snow falling outside.  You want to escape, to
    roll on the ground and face the elements firsthand.</p></div>"|1677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1677-northern-electric/|6.9|Christopher Dare

    nothing about experimental music?  They're the ones that said, ""This is weird,""
    the last time you put My Bloody Valentine on the hi-fi. Normally, I just let
    these comments slide like water off a duck's back. I don't pick my friends based
    on musical taste, so I don't feel the need to explain why I don't find the music
    strange and how it all makes sense if you can get a broader understanding of the
    context it's created in. What's the point in arguing?  Anyway, the other day, one
    of these loved ones walked in while I was listening to a new album for a
    <i>Pitchfork</i> review. The usual ""this is weird"" followed, but this time, I
    had a different response: ""You are absolutely right.  It's fucking weird as
    hell.""</p><p>
    
    That record was Bogdan Raczynski's <i>My Love I Love</i>. I don't find myself
    saying such a thing very often, but this is one of those rare records that sits
    in my collection without clear reference points. The two Raczynski albums I
    previously reviewed were of the spazzy, drill-n-bass variety. It was competent
    music with a fresh angle on a familiar, Aphex-derived sound. But this album
    seems related to what Raczynski has done before in only the loosest possible way.
    Instead of crushing breakbeats, <i>My Love I Love</i> is a 42-minute tone poem
    about love and rejection as scored for accordion, trumpet, guitar and modular
    synthesizer.  Beats are few (less than a quarter of the tracks have any at all),
    and several songs feature the offhand, off-key, just plain <i>off</i> vocal
    stylings of Raczynski.  Like Richard James, Raczynski is not one to let tone
    deafness stand in his way of his crooning.</p><p>
    
    The album's second track (all songs are titled ""My Love I Love"") introduces the
    template for the record. A droning accordion, propelled by a rare drum break,
    alternates between two chords before a sad trumpet melody duets with Raczynski's
    wordless singing (which, incidentally, is full of melancholy ""ba-ba-ba's"" and
    ""la-la-la's."" At the end of the tune, he offers, ""I love you, please don't make
    me cry anymore,"" mapping the thematic terrain. After the first listen, I had to
    ask myself if Raczynski, a cranky guy famous for his pisstakes and misdirection,
    was offering some kind of send-up of heart-on-sleeve trends in underground music.
    I'm still not completely convinced that he's not, which is scary to contemplate
    when you're writing a review. Somewhere, Raczynski could be laughing at me for
    feeling what I feel about <i>My Love I Love</i>. But I can't help it.  This album
    gets to me.</p><p>
    
    I think what I dig so much here is that Raczynski is going way out on a limb,
    trying to introduce new feelings into a genre that can seem, at times,
    emotionally constipated. In a Kid-606 interview I read a while back, he was
    asked about upcoming trends in IDM. The Kid answered that he hoped music would
    continue to explore new avenues of expression, and he imagined that incorporating
    more vocals was one way it could happen.</p><p>
    
    The Kid may as well have been talking about <i>My Love I Love</i>, because like
    it or not (and many will hate it, no question), this record definitely feels new
    and different. <i>My Love I Love</i> couldn't be further from how IDM is
    typically presented. There are no songs here called ""Atek-9.447"" or ""cul/qurk"";
    many of the sounds were recorded live; instead of pure geometry, the cover
    features a disturbing soft focus picture of Raczynski lying on a bed in the
    nude.  Raczynski is swinging for the seats with this one.  What it gets him
    will be a matter of some debate.</p><p>
    
    One thing I don't think could be argued is that Raczynski manages to craft a
    handful of killer instrumental tracks, most of them lasting less than two
    minutes. Track 14 has a powerfully evocative melody, but it's played on a
    horribly distorted instrument, perhaps a distant relative of a piano that sounds
    an inch away from disintegration. Track 10 is only 51 seconds long, and contains
    a whispered Raczynski vocal that will turn off some mightily, but the vibrato
    keyboard figure is beautiful enough to merit a Boards of Canada comparison. The
    four or five tracks with accordion (most of these also contain some low-key
    trumpet) help to give the record a sonic center, forging a solid connection
    with the world of film music.</p><p>
    
    I don't pretend to know exactly what Raczynski is up to here; I can only say
    that I like it, and yes, I do find it moving.  And weird.  I realize some people
    will laugh in my face for saying so. For god's sake, don't look at the number
    above and assume you'll dig this record.  Listen somewhere online first if you
    can (Raczynski's site currently has a couple samples).  But you just might find
    yourself falling for it the way I have.</p></div>"|6639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6639-my-love-i-love/|8.1|Mark Richard-San

    -- Brian Wilson, 1966, during the recording of Smile</p><p>
    
    This is always how it ends up for perfectionist geniuses.  While modern day
    recording techniques have cleaned up a lot of the extraneous human element,
    and actual error on tape has gone the way of the dodo, there can never really
    be a final, best take of music for people like Brian Wilson.  The good part
    about this is that listeners are treated to ever-expanding and evolving displays
    of inspired performance.  When you follow the lineage of Beach Boys albums up
    to <i>Smile</i>, Brian's progress as a musician, songwriter and producer is so
    clear as to verge on distraction.  In fact, he was so good that his fans took it
    for granted that with every new album, new frontiers would be broached.  When
    <i>Smile</i> fell by the wayside, and we were left to make sense of the remaining
    pieces (Brian coped by writing songs about writing directions), all that hard
    work seemed somehow for naught.  This is the bad part: chiefly, when you expect
    great things, good things disappoint.</p><p>
    
    Neutral Milk Hotel leader/only-permanent-member Jeff Mangum has more than a
    little Brian in him.  Musically, it seems he's quite familiar with those
    <i>Smile</i> sessions, particularly in the way he can take an ounce of
    pretension and turn it into all manner of a kitchen sink melodrama.  And it's
    not just the productions themselves, but also the idiosyncrasy at work, as if
    personal vision somehow became a method of existence rather than a character
    quirk.  For better or worse, a little Brian goes a long way, and in general,
    those afflicted (think Andy Partridge, not Sean O'Hagan) travel along similar
    paths: a tale of small beginnings, steady progress building to whatever
    masterpiece they were meant to produce, and then a sudden dimming like a dwarf
    star.</p><p>
<i>Everything Is</i> is a reissue of a three-song EP from 1995, with one
    additional song.  Like Wilson's earliest work, it offers few clues as to what
    would come later, and is fairly innocuous on its own.  However, it certainly
    supports the idea that Mangum has steadily progressed, at least conceptually.
    The title track is something like lo-fi glam folk, with a pinch of transience
    that only people who truly love pop can have.  Unfortunately, what stood out
    first for me was that the singing sounded so disinterested, as if he was afraid
    to get too close to the microphone-- or possibly, that he simply hadn't found
    his voice yet.</p><p>
    
    ""Snow Song, Pt. 1"" sounds even more lo-fi than the opener, mostly because of
    relentlessly out-of-tune guitars and Mangum's not-quite-in-synch, double-tracked
    vocals.  From any early stage, he seems not to have been as concerned with
    songcraft and arrangement as weight and mood.  Actually, these tunes seem to
    have more in common with Dennis Wilson than Brian, due primarily to the
    melancholy lead vocal and sincere (though verging on inept) accompaniment, but
    also to the almost funny surfer/hippie twang in Mangum's delivery.</p><p>
    
    And then comes the obligatory (?) sound-collage piece, which I guess, given
    the <i>Smile</i> background, could make sense.  There are snippets of
    conversation thrown in (and throughout the record), and though it reminds me of
    something psychedelic-- a Blue Meanies march, perhaps, or something from a fever
    dream-- I never figured Mangum as the LSD type.  Perhaps it's just studio fun,
    or possibly the effects of living below sea level for so long.  In any case,
    ""Tuesday Moon"" (not included on the previous version of this EP) wipes away
    most of the residue.  Again, fairly light stuff, but pop is pop, and when
    you go down the Path Beaten by Brian, it's a prerequisite that you can write
    catchy tunes.</p><p>
    
    Of course, we know what happened over the course of the next six years (and
    two very good albums), and in this light, <i>Everything Is</i> seems harmless.
    I couldn't recommend it to someone who had never heard Neutral Milk Hotel
    before without feeling a little guilty, but for fans who don't already know the
    whole story, it might serve as a nice prologue.  Where I stray from my own
    advice is upon the realization that after 40+ years writing music, Brian Wilson
    has come full circle.  His last album sounded good but the songwriting was a
    shell of his former craft.  By that logic, Mangum's later stuff will be
    underachieving, poorly recorded fuzz-pop.  Of course, it's probably not that
    simple, but if by some chance he has a nervous breakdown after obsessing over
    his next album, don't say I didn't warn you.</p></div>"|5759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5759-everything-is-ep/|6.0|Dominique Leone

Why not?</p><p>
    I imagine that must have been the response from most of the involved parties
    when asked to contribute to <i>Better Than the Beatles: A Tribute to the
    Shaggs</i>.  Why not?</p><p>
    I've never been a fan of tribute albums.  They just seem gratuitous, and a way
    for bands (and labels) to gain notoriety through association-- a shortcut
    bypassing actual work. They're the equivalent of album filler in any CD
    collection, ranking just above soundtrack compilations in my book (hello,
    <i>Batman Forever</i>). But having heard of the Shaggs years ago, and actually
    hearing their music years later, I asked myself the same question: why not?
    After all, it's got an interesting line-up of off-kilter artists (Thinking
    Fellers, Danielson Famile, Optiganally Yours, etc.), and it's not like any of
    them are going to commit a sacrilegious travesty by ruining an original, or
    bore you to death with simple mimicry.  Both would be nearly impossible..</p><p>
    But what kind of world do we live in where a trio of musically disinclined
    sisters from rural New Hampshire-- driven to practice and perform by a
    superstitious, and perhaps tyrannical, father who believed his mother foretold
    the group-- can cut an album full of what can only be called ""attempted"" pop
    songs, and thirty years later be subject of an honorary tribute? The answer: a
    strange and beautiful one, friends.  And if that sounds naïvely optimistic, so
    be it.  It comes from listening to the Shaggs' naïve stabs at musicianship.</p><p>
    All the same, it's not an uncommon reaction to think a joke is being played on
    you when you listen to the Shaggs-- that's part of the appeal. ""Who do these
    people think they are?  What was going through their heads when they recorded
    this?""  Trying to answer these questions is half the fun.  Then there's the fact
    that the Shaggs seem to have single-handedly (though unwittingly) laid the
    groundwork for the faux-naivete of twee-pop and possibly K Records itself. And
    then there's the proclamation by legendary wise-ass Frank Zappa that the Shaggs
    were better than the Beatles, a statement so confounding of popular logic that
    it just adds more confusion and mystery to the mix.</p><p>
    Although hated by many (and ignored by many more), few people argue that the
    Shaggs possessed no personality or spirit. The question is, did they have
    something else?  Is there any merit to their songwriting? If so, it should shine
    through in the hands of able musicians, right?  Well, right, but very
    unexpectedly, the problem here isn't with the material, it's with the ""able
    musicians."" Most of the participants choose to tip-toe around the songs, rarely
    cutting loose or experimenting, possibly for fear of accusations of trying to
    out-Shagg the Shaggs.</p><p>
    True to tribute album custom, the Big Guns are put up front, as Ida starts the
    album off with ""Philosophy of the World,"" the title track of the lone proper
    Shaggs album. The upbeat, ska-like rhythm of the original is traded in for what
    sounds like a Scottish dirge, proving Ida can sap the energy out of almost
    anything.  Optiganally Yours is next with a slightly more interesting, but
    similarly drab ""You're Something Special to Me.""</p><p>
    Of all the bands on this record, I had the biggest hopes for Thinking Fellers
    Union Local 282 and their version of ""Who are Parents,"" but they too take the
    catatonic route, risking little and turning in another disappointment. Mongrel
    breaks up the monotony with a somber but spirited rendition of ""My Cutie,""
    finally busting out an acoustic guitar in favor of organ.  Bauer's ""We have a
    Savior"" returns to the keyboard (it's as though there's a timidity toward
    approaching the guitarwork of front-Shagg Dot Wiggin), but the inner creepiness
    comes through here, as well as on Joost Visser's Will Oldham-like treatment of
    ""It's Halloween.""</p><p>
    Deerhoof takes on the quintessential Shaggs' song, ""My Pal Foot Foot.""  Building
    on bouncy sound effects, they come away with the best song on the album. R.
    Stevie Moore &amp; the Olsiewics-Chusid Ensemble, followed by Plastic Mastery, cling
    close to the originals of ""My Companion"" and ""Shaggs' Own Thing"" respectfully,
    while the Slot Racers do a folky medley of ""Painful Memories"" and ""Wheels.""
    Next up, the Danielson Famile take their shot at ""Who are Parents,"" and come
    away with hilarious results, complete with lisping baby-talk vocals which erase
    the album's early disappointments.  Later, the Furtips' ""You're Something Special
    to Me"" recalls the Modern Lovers, and the Double U finish things off with a more
    playful version of the opening song.</p><p>
    Like most tribute albums, <i>Better than the Beatles</i> succeeds less as a
    cohesive statement than as way of piquing interest in lesser known artists. But
    wait a minute, didn't I come out against that kind of thing near the beginning
    of this review?</p></div>"|7087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7087-better-than-the-beatles-a-tribute-to-the-shaggs/|6.2|Jason Nickey

    the 'burbs, screaming real loud and saying a whole lot of nothing.  Maybe that's
    fun when you're in high school, but eventually, the anger subsides and you
    realize that the jocks who once made fun of you are no longer part of your
    life.</p><p>
    
    But these bands invariably get in trouble when they attempt to make the
    transition from punk rock to pop.  It starts like this: the hardcore band from
    suburbs gets bored playing verse/chorus/verse, and suddenly realizes that their
    singer can actually carry a bit of a tune.  Then, they start buying records by
    Sunny Day Real Estate and the Promise Ring-- maybe a Superchunk or Smiths record--
    and the next thing you know, they sound like watered down imitations of those
    exact bands.  And now, instead of a thousand groups playing borrowed Minor Threat
    or Youth of Today chords, they're all ""expanding their sound"" and wondering why
    nobody gives a shit.</p><p>
    
    For proof, take the career of one Walter Schreifels.  He started out in the
    seminal New York hardcore band Gorilla Biscuits, one of the most revered bands
    of the genre.  But after growing bored with the limits of the sound, Walter
    started Quicksand. With Quicksand, he did what few ex-hardcore guys do: he
    created a valid and vital musical entity, and even managed to sniff a bit of
    the success that only a major label band can.</p><p>
    
    Quicksand took the anger and
    frenetic energy of hardcore, melded it with melody, complex strong structure
    and lyrics that applied to people who no longer lived with their parents.
    And until Quicksand broke up, Walter had managed to avoid the downfall that so
    commonly afflicts other hardcore frontmen. He even created the entity CIV so
    that he could relive some of his hardcore days in a fashionable, ready-for MTV
    manner.</p><p>
    
    Now Walter's back with Rival Schools, and their major label debut, <i>United by
    Fate</i>.  For the project, he's brought along drummer Sammy Siegler, who's
    played in, like, every New York hardcore band ever, and most recently in Glassjaw.
    Also in tow are bassist Cache Tolman of CIV, and Ian Love, who also appeared in
    a ton of hardcore bands on second guitar. Unfortunately, Walter's third hurrah
    amounts to a bunch of ex-hardcore heroes who have-- surprise!-- not aged
    gracefully.  And the music?  Neither groundbreaking, nor even ""really good.""</p><p>
<i>United by Fate</i> isn't a terrible record if you're a fan of late-90's
    alterna-rock.  The guitars build and crash, the drums and bass provide a
    muscular backdrop, and Walter's vocals are melodic without sounding like
    the guy took singing lessons.  Yet, despite all Schreifels' promises that the
    band would lead him in a new direction, <i>United by Fate</i> sounds a hell of
    a lot like the first Quicksand record, only a tad more melodic and not nearly
    as tight.  Worse, the rampant energy of Quicksand's best records is entirely
    absent, replaced with a sort of synthetic studio energy that seems forced at
    best.</p><p>
    
    At this point in his career, it would be nice to see Walter and his mates blaze
    a new path.  Instead, they seem stuck on playing the same old chords under a
    different name.  Yes, I'm afraid it's true: hardcore heroes do not age gracefully,
    and adding some melody and harmonies does not make you a groundbreaking artist.
    Rival Schools, the end is nigh.</p></div>"|6794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6794-united-by-fate/|6.3|Adam Dlugacz

    continually threatens to bubble to the surface and vanquish the world of rock
    once and for all.  Very few of these underground artists have made a name for
    themselves on American shores (Boredoms, Melt-Banana, Ruins), but the number of
    artists that continue to ply their craft continues to mount, all the while
    unbeknownst to us poor souls across the Pacific.</p><p>
    
    At the forefront of this underground movement is guitarist Makoto Kawabata and
    the noise freaks of Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso UFO (short for
    ""Underground Freak Out""). A self-described ""millennial hippy group,"" Acid Mothers
    Temple have been traveling the world, unleashing their particular brand of
    psychedelic bliss upon an unwitting public for four years. Releasing three
    albums early in their career on the Japanese underground label, PSF, the group
    slowly built a name for itself, specializing in what Kawabata termed ""trip""
    music. It's a meltdown of entire genres and movements-- drawing equally from
    French folk and Western psychedelia-- all re-imagined in a form intended to
    liquefy your brain.</p><p>
    
    Part of a community known as the Acid Mothers Temple Soul
    Collective, Kawabata and friends have been inhabiting the Japanese countryside
    and living out their own unique brand of utopianism for the last few years.
    Recalling the countercultural spirit of the 60's and other hippie communes, Acid
    Mothers even paid homage to that Californian group of restaurant-owning weirdos,
    Ya Ho Wha 13, with the album <i>The Father Moo and the Black Sheep</i>. But with
    this, their first release on Massachusetts' Squealer label, Acid Mothers Temple
    finally free the rein on their noise parade.</p><p>
    
    I'm not sure if the Acid Mothers are trying to win any converts with their most
    recent offering, but the make-or-break point (if you will) for potential fans
    will undoubtedly come at 40 seconds into <i>The New Geocentric World</i>, as
    ""Psycho Buddah"" opens with the mantra, ""What?,"" in a sound loop that teases the
    listener into thinking they've brought home some of that experimental
    locked-groove wankery.  But a few seconds later, the Acid Mothers annihilate
    all preconceived notions.</p><p>
    
    Dissecting the cacophony, the intense sonic war being waged on human ears, is
    futile. Best to sit back and let your brain bleed. I asked to hear this at the
    local record shop, and within one minute of the first track, people had either
    fled with fingers plugging their ears, or were completely rapt and entrenched
    within a new world of sonic dimensions. ""Psycho Buddah"" is unrelenting, moving
    at a furious pace for over 21 minutes and incorporating Kawabata's searing guitar
    work within the steady framework of the Acid Mothers' thunderous rhythm section.
    Cotton Casino, the group's only female, constantly pushes the gurgles, loops,
    drones and hisses of her synthesizer into the forefront.</p><p>
    
    The song teeters on a
    hazardous precipice, looking over the edge and waiting to fall, but Kawabata's
    guitar is the anchor here, effortlessly able to rein all the others into his
    sonic realm.  His ability to create deafening walls of feedback, hiss, and
    skronk, coupled with his penchant for tearing it all to shreds with a seething
    solo, is a thing of pure, unadulterated beauty. I'll say it right now: Kawabata
    is a guitar god.  And these other guys are no slouches, either, as they prove
    while seamlessly incorporating bagpipes (!) and Jew's harps (!!) into this
    freeform freakout without ever looking back.</p><p>
    
    The next track, ""Space Age Ballad,"" is a haunting acoustic number that recalls
    contemporaries Ghost and their psychedelic balladry. Comparatively short at four
    minutes, this track is mere preparation for the slow-burning ""You're Still Now
    Near Me Everytime.""  Guest vocalist Haco remains the focal point for the first
    minutes of the song until, at around the five-minute mark, Kawabata emerges with
    yet another guitar solo-- a trend on each track so far. A bit tiring?  For your
    average indie rock band, yeah.  But this is psychedelic madness, and the sheer
    joy and inventiveness with which Kawabata plays puts most of his contemporaries
    to shame, and his willingness to explore every possible dimension of sound
    succeeds with a creation of textures that seem wholly original.</p><p>
    
    Unafraid to don their cartoon masks as well, Acid Mothers unveil their frenetic
    update on Hendrix's ""Foxy Lady"" with the scorching ""Occie Lady,"" a pounding,
    speedfreak revision that subsumes Hendrix's riff within a mountainous din of
    thuds, screeches, and shrieking guitar. The closing track is a pure departure
    from everything preceding, abandoning the blistering guitarwork and crashing
    rhythm sections for a 15-minute drone workout.  Here, Kawabata's guitar and
    the song's multi-layered structure evokes the theatrics of My Bloody Valentine
    and Spacemen 3.</p><p>
    
    Acid Mothers Temple pride themselves on the drughead obsession of being ""cosmic
    troubadours"" in continual search for interstellar communication.  But unlike the
    shoegazers with which their music has so much in common, Makoto Kawabata
    sincerely believes he's communicating with the cosmos.  A strange guy to be sure,
    but most great musicians are given to some eccentricities.</p></div>"|20.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20-the-new-geocentric-world-of/|8.9|Luke Buckman

    12-year-old punk kids dolled up in the shredded threads, patches ablaze,
    cocking total disdain for every sight and smell.  It makes me feel old. Long
    copping out to the grim reality of commuting, college loans, bullshit office
    banter, and having to leave before the bar gets gonzo to go home, that
    manic-tipped sense of urgency is sorta gone for me.  Also, a decade of
    Tortoise-ing has left indie rock and assorted sub-genres decadent, non-verbal
    and completely without social comment.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps that's why there's been this dubious post-punk/no-wave revival. People
    were all over the Bush/Reagan similes a year ago, and at least musically, it's
    all come true-- corporate metal, synthy pop and the angry, newly articulate
    underground have boomed.  Witness Erase Errata, four ladies who rock harder and
    smarter, and with better beats than most stunningly hung left ones. Combining
    the jumble of DNA, the snarl vox of the Scissor Girls, and the leaping bass of
    the Birthday Party, they have just the right ratio of catchiness to antagonism,
    and they work it as a ploy for repeat listens.</p><p>
<i>Other Animal</i> is their first full-length and it almost topples itself with
    cranky excitement at the venture. No moment goes without movement-- there's a
    sense of nervous anticipation in each drum's snap.  Jenny Hoysten's carefully
    controlled sing-speak vocals have that blessed Kim Gordon tunelessness that
    sometimes stress into vibrato-heavy upturn.  Her articulated sentiments drink
    from the close-bottomed well of angry girl-punk topics: fucked politics,
    capitalism, and adult-hating, with an occasional curious rhetoric about other
    species' superiority. (C'mon, ladies, really.  Is the Rhesus gonna fix that
    warble in your bass cabinet?  Monitor international food supplies?  Hook up your
    cable?)  Still, they seem smart enough to shade the evils of the western world
    in its sexiest time signatures, altered chord structures, and borderline linear
    structures. To borrow some St. Mark's mentality, ""That's using the man to fuck
    himself."" Well said, Sid.</p><p>
    
    Unlike Le Tigre, with whom they've held the stage and will be invariably
    contrasted with in the limited lady-pool of pop culture's mind, Erase Errata
    seems like a band that plays music first. Both will shake booties, convince
    other girls to plug in, and make it on the cover of <i>Venus</i> and other
    grrl-friendly mags.  But Errata's got a momentum based not on star power,
    preprogramming, slideshows or calisthenics.  Like the Gang of Four, Josef K or
    any band of borderline fame during post-punk's brief flicker, Errata pulls
    energy from the ever-bountiful over soul of dissatisfaction we've hid in our
    minds for the day to day.  Channeled to a challenging rock context, it's
    simultaneously dead serious and hideously absurd.</p><p>
    
    And that's why it works. Tracks like ""High Society"" expose the recording's
    tin-covered gaudiness-- all distortion and mid-range-- which somehow robs the
    delirious sex beat of its urge. That the song grows from a <i>Confusion is
    Sex</i>-style noise jam only adds to the jumble as Errata spend equal time
    rocking their cocks as trying to cut others' off.  But man haters they aren't--
    just smart chicks pomo-ing about with their patchwork.</p><p>
    
    Being that they do rock, and that they do espouse the lines, I fear them somehow
    getting a Hanna-head that they're some kind of role model.  One can only hope
    this god-forsaken caterwaul they've produced stays true to its lean turn,
    finding musical progress in changing times and not in changing fads.</p></div>"|2822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2822-other-animals/|7.9|Daphne Carr

My feet are cold, and I am sleepy.  My living room is a
    mess of crusty, unusable brushes, jewel cases, and paint-splattered newspaper.
    An especially aggressive shade of mandarin orange, recently applied, covers some
    walls but not others, and all of my ugly furniture is crowded into a small space
    in the center of the room.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, I'm relaxed to the point of guilt. I don't give a fuck if this
    place never gets cleaned up-- just as long as this disc keeps spinning. O'Neil's
    slippery, sireny, poisonously beautiful voice cuts through the disorder of her
    richly unnerving arrangements and makes me want to hit repeat until I rub off
    my right index-fingerprint.</p><p>
    
    On last year's <i>Peregrine</i>, O'Neil broke from her Sonora Pine/Retsin/Rodan
    stylistic past with a haunting and moody, yet still somehow ineffectual
    collection of songs.  But on <i>In the Sun Lines</i>, she's refined her approach
    and forged new ways to, as her label's website put it, ""paint with sound.""</p><p>
    
    What she paints is not always quite comforting. ""This Morning,"" an eight-minute
    dirge-lite of a song, is an effective and very repetitive soundscape of
    claustrophobic piano tinkling, ominous acoustic guitar overtones, and O'Neil's
    ghostly vocalizing.  The musical arrangement, except for the decorative guitar
    bits, could have been a loop.  The slow, chugging pace of the song sounds like
    muffled machinery, and the occasional accordion exhalation sounds as if radioed
    in from someone else's nightmare.</p><p>
    
    The opening track, ""The Winds You Came Here On,"" is among the album's most
    straightforward and prettiest. The song's widely spaced chords are strung
    together by lightly struck and submerged single notes. O'Neil's voice is sweet
    and accusatory, singing the tensest of melodies, until all the buildup spills
    over into the gorgeously simple and vocalless chorus.</p><p>
    
    ""Your Rats Are,"" with Ida's Dan Littleton guesting, is a southern-flavored
    mood-fest of sweepy sounds and sudden cellos that burst like curses from a
    deranged person. The song is an ode of sorts to New York City, but the feel
    couldn't be further removed from the metropolis. The sleigh-bell percussion
    and chanting vocals provide the album's darkest, most evocative moments.</p><p>
    
    ""In This Rough,"" <i>Sun Lines</i>' seventh and finest track, demonstrates
    O'Neil's ""songwriter"" qualities better than any other. She sings the album's
    best melody over the waltz beat suggested by her guitar strumming, while
    off-color and fluid-sounding guitar notes mark the harmony with dissonance like
    intermittent rain drops.</p><p>
    
    The charmingly named ""New Harm"" sees the album out the door with a clutter of
    nerve-wracking chimes and the kinds of sounds a grandfather clock might make if
    it could double over in pain.  The song has no vocals and no structure, save for
    the forced symmetry of its beginning and ending sections.  Instead, it seeks only
    to reinforce the album's main theme: uneasiness. The ending gesture is almost
    excessive, in that whatever disconcertion O'Neil was trying to cause in the
    listener is long established by the final track.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>In the Sun Lines</i> is a resounding success on many fronts. The
    beauty of O'Neil's melodies stick with you, but no more and no less than the
    pervading sense of danger and fear that emanates from her tense musical
    arrangements. The net effect of these opposing forces is a resigned and drugged
    relaxation.  Hopefully, though, O'Neil will tease out her gifts for melody and
    ""song"" on her next effort, in addition to pursuing perfection in the form of
    these beautiful but stifling mood-pieces.</p></div>"|6005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6005-in-the-sun-lines/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    ""Bands on the Run"" series, the dudes, as they would tend to call themselves,
    ignited their van and set off to conquer the world through a set of gigs at
    overpriced theme bars and restaurants.  The highlight of the Planet Hollywood
    show in Cleveland was certainly the all-you-can-eat bin of Bruce Willis's
    Cap'n Crunch-breaded chicken fingers.  Though, another outstanding moment
    came when one of the ladies from ""V.I.P."" kissed the guitarist on the lips
    at the Harley Davidson Café in Phoenix.  The bassist even scored some oral
    sex in Portland, but later realized that sucking off the chef for free
    Rainforest Reubens isn't exactly Vince Neil behavior.  So this was the rock
    and roll life, they thought.</p><p>
    Flickerstick played with some really great upcoming bands on this tour.  Dis
    Aster Master, Konstrunktion, Hot Molly, No Soup for U, and Gearbox all
    influenced the guys to no end, and you can bet bits of their sound will rub
    off.  But audience members at the House of Blues show in Chicago, mostly
    there for the free admission and Blind Lemon Jefferson Key Lime Pie, couldn't
    help but wonder: who was this spunky mop-top band opening for Flickerstick?
    And why were they so brutally awful?</p><p>
    Wolfie.  With the title of their 1999 sophomore album (notable only for sort
    of having the same cover as Travis' <i>The Invisible Band</i>), Wolfie asked,
    ""Where's Wolfie?""  <i>Tall Dark Hill</i>, the follow up, answers with a
    resounding ""over there.""  On the opening track, Joe Ziemba, singer and writer
    of such tunes as ""Little Bee Is Dancin',"" announces in a nasally whimper,
    ""After years of struggling, I finally believe in myself.""  Hey, if opening
    for Flickerstick fulfills you, godspeed.  It's your career zenith.</p><p>
    This third album sees Wolfie flirting with heavier 70's textures.  But as the
    band blindly stumbles into more conventional realms (in that the songs no
    longer sound recorded by infants in a sock), the more pathetic they seem.
    ""Everybody Knows How to Cry"" blatantly, criminally, shamelessly borrows Marc
    Bolan's <i>Slider</i> boogie, but ends up more closely approximating the
    cartoon-rock of Bolan's Saturday morning ""Marc!"" show.  Even worse, Wolfie
    evokes Led Zeppelin on ""You Are a Woman.""  You're better off watching Jason
    Lee lip-synch ""Fever Dog.""  Of course, any attempt by Wolfie to improve
    should be commended, but even after three albums, they've still only got the
    reach of a Thalidomide baby.</p><p>
    Godforsaken musicianship imbued <i>Awful Mess Mystery</i>, Wolfie's debut,
    with near-haphazard art-rock style, to which its title intentionally nods.
    Their complete lack of talent brought the sound closer to U.S. Maple than
    the Zombies comparison so often flung around in their press releases.  The
    songwriting eventually turned melodic by simple means of not being atonal.
    On <i>Tall Dark Hill</i>, Ziemba runs his pipes up and down standard scales,
    jumps the standard octaves, and ooh's the standard aah's when he feels like
    it, but this should never be mistaken for actual pop skill.  Melody oozes
    from every jingle, elevator, bird, radio, and whistling business man.  We're
    cocooned by melody.  Why should lowest-rung mimicry be commended?  Harmony
    is the easiest of sounds for the human animal to successfully exude.  Anyone
    can hum.  It's the unexpected notes that measure talent.  At the very least,
    surround yourself with people who can play their instruments; drummer RJ
    Porter propels ""Living Island Is Real"" with cowbell and kiddie-pool cymbal
    splashes, but handles the traps like he's playing with his feet.</p><p>
    Modern twee bands oddly pay homage to the 60's by approximating the bubblegum
    bands.  It's not the Kinks, Beatles, and Zombies these kids are after; it's
    the Ohio Express, 1920 Fruit Gum Company, the Archies, and whatever other
    names Kasenetz and Katz wrote under.  That's all well and fine.  I won't
    start a debate on the merits of crafted, commercial pop.  But where these
    twee bands lose the path is in forgetting that those songs were recorded by
    accomplished session players, in posh studios, with teams of professional
    writers.  What's the point in hearing three college kids from rural Illinois
    hack away their very own ""Sugar Sugar?""  If you want bubblegum, you toss a
    stick of Wrigley's in your mouth, not some sap-ball your retarded cousin
    pulled off an acacia tree.</p><p>
    Whenever Amanda Lyons opens her mouth, the songs drastically veer towards
    early That Dog material.  These days, That Dog might be working at Hot Dog
    on a Stick, as one of their videos depicted.  And those girls were the
    daughters of producer Lenny Waronker, and jazz legend Charlie Haden, one of
    the most skilled musicians of the 20th century.  Genetics have a funny way
    of working.  But the gods have an even greater sense of humor.  If <i>Awful
    Mess Mystery</i> was the joke, the aspirations of <i>Tall Dark Hill</i> can
    only be the punchline.</p></div>"|8733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8733-tall-dark-hill/|2.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

I would
    argue that mathematicians and scientists are even more so.  In fact, what makes
    some artistic types seem a little off-balance is their scientist-like tendencies:
    their inability to accept the everyday assumptions that make up what us ""normal
    folk"" call the mundane, and their unwavering adherence to logic-- albeit an inner
    logic that makes perfect sense in their own minds, yet is mysterious to us.  I
    believe that the struggle to convey this inner logic to the outside world is
    what gives birth to a lot of artistic expression.</p><p>
    
    Much has been made of Daniel Johnston's bouts with mental illness. But the point
    is that they are ""bouts,"" as in the boxing term; they are battles. And out of
    these battles are born songs that reveal much about human nature in general,
    and not just the mind of an manic depressive. The fact is, Johnston's mental
    illness does not make up his central characteristic as a songwriter, though it
    does color it significantly.  But if that's all his songs are-- just expressions
    of mania and lunacy-- there would be little recognition and identification with
    them, and they wouldn't be as moving as they so often are. Their main concerns
    are universal human concerns, though they're expressed with such idiosyncrasy
    that they're often taken as mad ramblings.</p><p>
    
    The main themes on <i>Rejected Unknown</i> are the themes Johnston has explored
    throughout much of his career: hopeless longing, unrequited love, and as might
    be gathered from the album's title, fear of rejection. This fear probably took
    on very real terms for Johnston as he was finally dropped from Atlantic Records
    after being held for years in contractual limbo.  As it is, it's been seven
    years since his last proper album (1994's <i>Fun</i>), and judging from the
    resulting music, the time has been well spent.  <i>Fun</i> saw little musical
    involvement from Johnston, lending the impression that he was led by the hand
    by a pack of svengalis.  But <i>Rejection Unknown</i> is unmistakably Johnston's
    album; he sings and plays piano and guitar, and even adds some percussion to
    the oddly quirky pop songs.</p><p>
    
    With the aid of new medicines and treatments, Johnston is now more together than
    he's ever sounded before, and his music is all the better for it.  It lays to
    waste the idea that his insanity is at the root of his songwriting.  But don't
    get me wrong. <i>Rejected Unknown</i> is still full of his, uh, highly personal
    mythology-- touchstones such as the Beatles, Captain America, and Casper the
    Friendly Ghost are still prominently featured motifs-- but the main thought you
    come away with is not, ""Damn, this is some crazy shit,"" but, ""Damn, these are
    good songs."" There are some duds, songs that just hang on too long (like the
    characters in his songs) or are just too sappy, but overall it's one of the
    strongest efforts of his career.</p><p>
    
    ""Impossible Love"" begins the album on a note familiar to anyone who's ever heard
    a Johnston album.  He sings, ""You hurt me so bad/ You were the best friend I
    ever had,"" in his boyish voice-- a voice that puts a lot of people off, but is
    as distinctive as his surrealistic artwork which graces the cover.  ""Funeral
    Girl"" continues the theme of lost love (actually, this theme pretty much sums
    up most of Johnston's work, but then again, it also pretty much sums up what
    pop music as a whole is about), and ""Dream Scream"" is an almost scary portrait
    of hopelessly longing for someone you can't have.  But what puts Johnston in
    rare company (not just the Syd Barrett/Roky Erickson camp where he's too often
    hastily placed) are lines like this one from ""Love Forever"": ""I'm thinking about
    our yesterday/ We were the best for each other.../ I haven't given up/ It's
    been 15 years.""</p><p>
    
    Fifteen years?! Damn.  I mean, I've had crushes.  Some of them have lasted a
    really long time. But 15 years! It reminds me of that line from the Smiths'
    ""Half a Person"" where the narrator relates he's ""spent six full years of [his]
    life on [someone's] trail."" Most songwriters wouldn't be so bold.  They'd back
    off a little, hedge their bets.  They wouldn't want to strain the listener's
    credulity.  They'd say something like, ""I saw you a few months later."" A long
    time, but not too long. But we're talking about some serious feelings here--
    the kind of feelings that demand a song be written.  And that's the kind of
    necessity that informs many of Johnston's songs.  They have a feeling of a
    life-or-death-ness that makes the work of lesser songwriters seem trivial.</p></div>"|4281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4281-rejected-unknown/|7.5|Jason Nickey

It's a concept I'm sort of
    attracted to.  I've even attempted some of the traditional methods, but I
    always get distracted: my foot falls asleep, my ass starts hurting from being
    sat on all weird, or I have intense, apocalyptic visions like the ones in Ken
    Russell's <i>Altered States</i>.  (Incidentally, being transformed into a
    cro-magnon and busting into a zoo in the dead of night to consume live bovine
    is highly overrated.)   I'm not really sure why I attempt to put myself through
    such torture, though, when I know that music can provide the obliteration of
    surroundings I seek.  Jeff Buckley is always there for me.</p><p>
    
    The first ten tracks from Buckley's second officially released live album,
    <i>Live a L'Olympia</i>, are culled from two shows that took place on July 6th
    and 7th in 1995, almost a year after the release of <i>Grace</i>.  The recordings
    are sourced from an analog audio cassette that was found among Buckley's
    possessions after his death.  For a major label concert release, there's a high
    amount of noise present, but this is significantly outweighed by the quality of
    the performances documented.   The liner notes call these shows ""high points of
    [Buckley's] performing career,"" a fact that's quite apparent in the material,
    which is by and large pretty stunning stuff.</p><p>
    
    Such is the case with the two songs that open the album, ""Lover You Should've
    Come Over"" and ""Dream Brother."" Buckley's band are a focused and tight bunch
    who can only complement Buckley's ecstatic falsettos. Both tracks exceed seven
    minutes in length, yet there's not a second lacking in energy.  Buckley begins
    the verse of ""Dream Brother"" with a barely audible, steadily repeating guitar
    note that builds to a reverbed crash as he hammers the pickup.  The arrangement
    isn't very distant from the performance on last year's <i>Mystery White Boy</i>,
    but this recording seems somehow more poignant.</p><p>
    
    Then there's ""Eternal Life,"" and the cover of the MC5 classic, ""Kick Out the
    Jams,"" while expose Buckley's subtle death metal leanings, allowing them to
    gawkily escape into the open.  I doubt the fans are looking for more of that
    after the version of the former song on <i>Mystery White Boy</i>.  Then again,
    I've always preferred the more minimal <i>Live at Sin-E</i> version of the
    song to <i>Grace</i>'s studio version.</p><p>
    
    Which leads me to the only problematic flaw of <i>L'Olympia</i>: at times, the
    live energy defies capture on tape, and at others, it actually interrupts the
    performances.  Buckley stops in the middle of both ""Je N'en Connais pas la Fin""
    and ""Hallelujah."" On the latter, he even asks the audience if they want him to
    finish the song.  When heard, the question seems to be an angry retort to an
    impolite audience, but according to a statement made by Buckley's mom in the
    liner notes, Jeff was reveling in the support of his audience-- something that
    was relatively new to him at the time of this recording.</p><p>
    
    The audience joins in to sing ""Hallelujah.""  Buckley proclaims, ""This is so rock
    and roll,"" and proceeds to sing harmony with his active audience.  But while
    this would have been an astounding experience in person, the recording doesn't
    capture much of the audience, and some of Buckley's complementary vocal lines
    seem awkward.  Later, the disc concludes with a soundboard recording of ""What
    Will You Sa,"" recorded at 1995's Festival of Sacred Music, which was held in a
    small village in western France.  Here, Azerbaijani singer Alim Qazimov adds
    vocals and plays tabla, with Buckley occasionally mimicking Qazimov's
    middle-eastern vocal turns, making it a uniquely engaging track in Buckley's
    live oeuvre.</p><p>
<i>Live a L'Olympia</i> hasn't yet been issued domestically, and it isn't listed
    on Columbia's American release schedule.  For Buckley fans, I personally consider
    ""What Will You Say"" to be worth the hassle of an international order. And if you
    care to sing along, Jeff will harmonize. You might just forget where you are.</p></div>"|993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/993-live-a-lolympia/|8.3|Christopher F. Schiel

I was expecting the usual
    treatment: he would slightly distend my ectopic eyeball to reveal the sinewy
    mess of the deformed optic nerve of my right eye; he would smear a clear salve
    of his own manufacture using a modified Q-tip, and then gently push my eyeball
    back into my head in an unconventional position. But not this visit.</p><p>
    
    Though Dr. Hawtin was the same calmly welcoming bald gentleman I've learnt to
    trust and admire, I walked into his familiarly anechoic and odorless office,
    expecting to be greeted with a smile of, ""Have I got something innovative
    and unregulated for you!"" But since he's about the only person that isn't
    skeeved out by my disfigurement (or question how I'm even able to feed myself
    in anything resembling an acceptable manner), I have learnt to resign myself to
    his unique skills.</p><p>
    
    Knowing that my ocular defect has impeded my ability to communicate as most
    other people do, Dr. Hawtin and I have resorted to formulating a touch-language.
    He asks how I'm doing and I reply by touching the tip of his nose: ""Just great.""
    But this time, I don't wait for him to follow up.  I am concerned.  Dr. Hawtin's
    office includes some equipment I've never seen before.  There's a
    turntable-cum-centrifuge linked to a translucent laptop computer. The computer's
    screen brightly displays the words, ""Final Scratch: initialization complete.
    Press F1 to commence procedure."" I stroke the knuckles of Dr. Hawtin's right
    hand: ""What's going on?""</p><p>
    
    The doctor straightens his back with pride and then leads me to the Final
    Scratch equipment.</p><p>
    
    ""In collaboration with other experimental physicians, I have collected an array
    of three hundred sonic tools and arranged them into one therapeutic sequence.
    The course of treatment I propose that you undergo will alleviate some of your
    difficulties. As we've discussed before, the optical nerve of your ectopic eye
    is fused with the optic nerve of your other, correctly situated eye. We've
    discussed that removal of your ectopic eye is not feasible without severing the
    conjoined optic nerve and thus inducing permanent blindness.</p><p>
    
    ""What I and other researchers have discovered is that application of certain
    rhythmic tones and frequencies can cause nerve tissue to fold in on itself and
    woundlessly seal itself off from the greater central system. My recommendation
    is that you agree to have the nerve of your ectopic eye treated by this <i>DE9</i>
    process. Understand that you will lose sight in that eye, but given its location,
    and the fact that you've never received anything but utterly confusing signals
    from it, I predict a substantial improvement in your quality of life. This work
    continues and improves upon my previous <i>Decks, EFX and 909</i> minimal tone
    surgery, but I've greatly reduced the duration of each sample and the therapeutic
    payload. The results are dramatic and with negligible side-effects.""</p><p>
    
    Touching Dr. Hawtin's forehead, I asked him what the treatment involved.</p><p>
    
    ""The Final Scratch equipment is essentially an immensely sensitive triggering
    unit which allows the operator to cue up any one of the stored therapeutic DE9
    sound samples. Some of these samples I have created myself, but the majority of
    them were produced by my esteemed colleagues in the minimal community-- Professor
    Carl Craig, Dr. Janek Sienkiewicz, Dr. Stewart Walker, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Dr.
    Peter Speiss, to mention but a few. I have trimmed their tones to either a
    single tone or loop and collated them into the Hawtin DE9 minimal tone surgical
    rhythm database.</p><p>
    
    ""What I will do is remove the eyeball-- just as I always do during these
    examinations-- and attach a micro-speaker to the exposed nerve. I will then use
    the DE9 turntable device to cue up and release from the database each minimal
    rhythm according to that pattern's therapeutic ability. After the fifty minutes
    of the DE9 process, the abnormal bifurcation of your optic nerve will be so
    withered by the relentless synthetic percussion as to be unable to conduct
    signals to your brain. We'll then just snip the eyeball out and you'll be able
    to swallow, talk and eat solid foods. In addition to removing of the physical
    abnormality, DE9 tones have a second set of harmonics. These frequencies will
    deliver signals to your brain to re-route visual data from the now useless
    section of your optic nerve. Your brain will adapt to its compromised situation
    and your normal eye will be instructed to take on 100% of visual duties.""</p><p>
    
    Dr. Hawtin perceived that I was experiencing a mixture of trepidation and
    excitement, and added with characteristic candor, ""Unrelenting maintenance of
    intensity is key to success of the operation. Open your mouth! Let's yank that
    peering sucker out of its lair!""</p></div>"|3770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3770-de9-closer-to-the-edit/|7.9|Paul Cooper

All the past moments of my life were crushed into an     instant under the fulcrum of perception.  To evacuate work, we had to locate our     boss.  We found him on the roof, taking pictures.  You can't quite see the     Pentagon from downtown D.C., but the smoke was billowing up on the horizon.     All I wanted to do was to go home, curl up under some sheets and drift off to     soothing music.  But on my return, I found myself transfixed to the television,     unable to escape multiplying crash angles and paranoid predictions.</p>
<p>Since then, my thoughts have never been far from the crisis.  That was the     legacy of the day-- all other concerns seemed trivial.  What was the difference     between ambient and ethereal to the man and woman who clasped hands and leapt     from one of the towers?  But I finally did lie down to listen to a new album.     Tap, tap, tap came the percussion out of the speakers, slow and regular.  A     series of chimes followed, like the ring of prepared drinking glasses.  Hushed     guitar reverb rose, soon followed by a theremin singing and the occasional buzz     of some errant appliance.  Five minutes later, soft female vocals materialized--     wordless vowels that mixed with the symphonic swells.  The song progressed from     fluid ether to short, pulsing waves, a series of psychedelic organ crests and     troughs similar to Philip Glass' <i>Glassworks</i>.  The tension relaxed.  I     felt calm.</p>
<p>Mus is Fran Gayo and Monica Vacas, a male/female duo from Spain.  Normally, they     release music in their native country on the Acuarela label.  Reviews characterize     their early material as electronic-oriented and their later work as more     guitar-based.  But Darla Records has offered them entry into their <i>Bliss     Out</i> series, allowing them to show off a very gentle mix of the two     influences.  <i>Aida</i>'s thirty-six minutes and nine seconds make for the     kind of organic ambience that stirs little excitement but charms those who     give it a chance.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's just two songs.  The aforementioned ""Aquel Inviernu"" pauses     around the 13th minute.  The silence is broken with acoustic guitar strums and     Vacas' near-whispered vocals.  Darla's choice of the series' title seems ironic     when you consider past contributors-- from Amp to Fuxa to American Analog Set.     ""Bliss Out"" here signifies a drifting, shoegazing mode rather than the generic     sense of joy.  Vacas sings in Asturian, a Spanish dialect used in the     principality of Asturia, and her understated delivery hints at melancholia:     ""Siempre dormir, siempre llorar"" (""always sleeps, always cries"").  Gayo     harmonizes behind her, audible mostly as a hum.  The instrumental strains     stream together and the piece ends in keyboard minimalism near the twenty-minute     mark.</p>
<p>The second song, ""A Cielu Abiertu"" (""The Open Door"") continues like an edit of     the first.  A piano steps slowly in Harold Budd fashion, and music-box chimes     tinkle innocently while Vacas graces us again with her lovely voice.  And     afterwards, Mus surprise with a warm horn melody and a sudden hiss, like bus     brakes sighing.  The thirteen-minute suite ends in the sound of rushing     rainwater.</p>
<p>Change a letter of the band's name, and you have their closest relation: Iceland's     Múm make similar electronic post-folk, simple and filled with emotional warmth.     Mus offered the calmness I craved then; catharsis through excruciatingly painful     music would have required energy I didn't possess, and I wasn't feeling any of     that happy music.  For a short while there, time flowed in the opposite direction.     The half-hour passed far too quickly.</p></div>"|4174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4174-aida-bliss-out-v17/|7.6|Christopher Dare

    temperature. It's incredible to contemplate the variety of emotional reactions
    possible from nothing more than a 4/4 bass drum, bits of percussive static, and
    a vague ghost of a melody. Tracks by the likes of Sutekh and Plastikman seem
    very cold and foreboding to me, suggesting something about the nature of man
    and machine, and the bleak future in store where the twain do meet. And then
    there's music made with similar tools by Jan Jelinek (under his own name and as
    Gramm) and Wolfgang Voigt's Gas releases, music that's warm, organic and
    expansive, suggesting a cheerful fusion of carbon-based life and silicon.</p><p>
    
    Jetone (Montreal-based Tim Hecker) belongs in the latter category. His tracks
    are anchored by a bass thump with vast space moving between the sounds, but the
    slight textures he does incorporate lend the music a cozy and intimate feel.
    Extreme dub effects in minimal techno can give the illusion of music echoing
    through an empty concrete structure, but the reverb in Jetone is subtle and
    gentle, decaying slowly through a soft, welcoming space.</p><p>
    
    ""Phoedra IV"" recalls the frayed loveliness of early Mouse on Mars, in particular
    <i>Vulvaland</i>'s ""Chagrin,"" with its heartbeat pulse, clumps of sonic fuzz,
    and soothing keyboard drone. Enriching the stew is the slightly psychedelic
    nature of the sound sources, with portions of ""Phoedra IV"" recalling the drift
    of EAR's ""Space Themes."" The repeating glitches that sit in the foreground of
    ""Mtl Bass"" seem related to the guitar refrain that opened Fennesz's <i>Endless
    Summer</i>, but with an insistent bass pulse pushing the tune away from more
    abstract realms.  And ""Octan"" ups the grooviness factor with some playful
    electro squelches in the background, coming off as a more austere Two Lone
    Swordsmen.</p><p>
    
    Throughout most of <i>Ultramarin</i>, Jetone clings to the relaxed 4/4 beat
    like a tattered shred of a favorite blanket, using the familiar rhythm to bind
    the unfamiliar and varied sound sources. But a handful of tracks jettison the
    grid and nestle into pure ambient territory. The finest of these is the brief
    ""Only Then,"" a glow of static and uncertain pitch that unfolds like a flower
    greeting the sun.</p><p>
    
    The latter part of <i>Ultramarin</i> finds Jetone getting just a bit colder and
    darker. The percussion in ""Phoedra II"" sounds like the work of a backhoe, with
    chunks of crumbling concrete following each heavy blow.  ""Untitled"" opts for
    an edgier palate, with a stern bassline and samples that seem stuck in an
    infinite loop.  ""Fkstrtowr"" replicates the basic ambient format of ""Only Then,""
    with harsher, more metallic noise standing in for the affirming hum. And ""Dakkar""
    closes the album on its most aggressive note (and, not coincidentally, its most
    danceable), with electro-tribal percussion and leanings toward house. Still, for
    the bulk of this fine record, Jetone shows a marked skill in crafting soothing
    body music as deep as it is wide.</p></div>"|4248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4248-ultramarin/|7.6|Mark Richard-San

I don't mean to say
    that it's ever been inclusive.  I don't even mean to say that you could listen
    to it.  Sure, you could if you wanted to, but you'd risk being labeled ""weird""
    or ""academic"" by your friends, and surely that wouldn't be worth getting exposed
    to a few, rare specimens of actual ingenuity.  No, by manageable, I mean you
    knew what it was and where to find it.  You knew who was making it, and who was
    just being noisy.  Time was, you could pick up a copy of <i>Tempo</i> and get
    the straight dope on the straightest dope there was: Edgard Varese, Harry
    Partch, Charles Ives, Igor Stravinsky, John Cage-- all dead, all out there.  It
    was experimental, but it had its place, neatly tucked away in the pages of
    arcane journals and the minds of ""obscurophiles"" everywhere.</p><p>
    Ours is a different world.  Not only has the experimental community come to terms
    with accessibility and shared information, but the world of the living has
    finally discovered that just because it's new and strange doesn't mean you have
    to be intimidated.  In short, experimental music is more popular than it has
    ever been.  ""Yay,"" right?  I mean, when Zappa was inserting subliminal Varese
    quotes on his LP jackets, no one would have dared dream that one day the French
    composer might actually outsell old Frank.  What harm could a little populism
    do anyone?</p><p>
    I found the answer as a glanced at Thom Yorke's mug on a copy of <i>The Wire</i>
    a few weeks ago.  As if I have to remind you, this mag is sort of a layman's
    survey of contemporary experimental music-- be it classical, rock, electronic,
    or jazz.  As monthlies go, it's pretty good, but I was pretty shocked to see
    the main Radio head there.  ""Are they experimental now?"" I asked myself.  Sort
    of.  ""Did this issue of <i>The Wire</i> sell more than any other in the past
    year?"" Undoubtedly.  And the bittersweet reality of a populist avant-garde almost
    gave me frostbite.</p><p>
    This is the part where John Zorn becomes of use.  To the chagrin of indie snobs
    and New York art-punks, he was running rampant years ago. Zorn often took the
    piss out of serious classical composition by writing ""game"" pieces, wherein the
    players jumped through all manner of chutes and ladders as renegade soloists,
    wild cards and other strategic objects.  This is a man who used major label
    money to record tunes from old Spaghetti Westerns, and had the audacity to
    attempt to place an image of a decapitated human head on one of his record
    covers (Elektra, in turn, had the audacity to drop him from their lineup--
    public acceptance is a bitch).</p><p>
    Musically, Zorn has been through the wringer, and then some.  The game pieces
    comprise most of his early work.  He moved from there into the classic ""file
    card"" compositions like ""Godard"" and ""Spillane,"" and then on to his microcosmic
    Naked City period.  If it hadn't become painfully obvious by then, Zorn's
    subsequent Semitic jazz project Masada made clear that he was not only interested
    in furthering the avant-garde tradition, but in integrating it into the shared
    consciousness of cultural awareness.  This was real populism without ever
    actually making ""popular"" music.  So, after you've managed a miracle on par
    with teaching bears to skate, where do you go?</p><p>
<i>Madness, Love and Mysticism</i> is Zorn playing roots music.  That is, after
    years of forging his own path (albeit one very informed by an interesting mix of
    influences), he's coming home, into the arms of Grandpa Messiaen and Uncle Cage.
    ""Le Mômo"" (dedicated to artist Antonin Artaud) might serve nicely as the backdrop
    to a particularly violent and intellectually manipulative domestic dispute.
    Pianist Stephen Drury and violinist Jennifer Choi duet to some very intense
    strains, informed not so much by chamber classical as by clinical schizophrenia.
    There are some lyrical (but not exactly melodic) sections, though it seems Zorn's
    calm mode is more ambient/cold than stirring/warm. However, the majority of the
    piece is quite intense, and since I don't know Artaud's work, I can only guess
    he was prone to fits of fiery inspiration and/or demonic possession.  How's that
    for an opener?</p><p>
    ""Untitled"" (dedicated to artist Joseph Cornell) is a piece for solo cello,
    performed by frequent Zorn collaborator Erik Friedlander.  This piece is much
    more low key than the first one, though no less flighty.  Parts of it flow like
    an aggressive stream, while others recall Ennio Morricone-style suspense motives.
    I don't know Cornell's work either (surprise!), but I'm thinking he may have
    missed out on Artaud's heat seizures.</p><p>
    For me, the centerpiece of the album is the last track, ""Amour Fou"" (""Crazy
    Love"").  Zorn has recently put out some sets with dubious bylines such as
    ""music for lovers"" or ""music for children,"" but the title seems fairly
    appropriate on this piece.  Zorn scores for violin, cello and piano on music
    that is some of his most evocative, at least in terms of human emotion (as
    opposed to film score hyperbole).  Jealousy and guilt are big players here--
    they're detectable in Drury's eerie opening piano chords, and later, his
    playing of ultra-spooky arpeggios.  There are several chaotic interludes,
    but the overriding feeling is one of nervous indecision, or perhaps detachment
    between two particularly eclectic lovers.  Leave it to a classical composer
    to take the task of translating the tension of love literally instead of

    Diehard Zorn fans may find this album something of a breath of fresh air, if
    only to combat his recent stale surf-rock or his long line of Masada-branded
    products.  As his classical compositions go, these are some of the most
    interesting, and it would seem he's slowly beginning to transcend his influences.
    For newcomers, the album is probably a better place to start investigating
    Zorn's chamber works than others like <i>Kristallnacht</i> or <i>Redbird</i>
    (which could scare away the uninitiated due to hurricane intensity or glacier
    pace, respectively).  Personally, I'm going to art school so I can understand
    what the hell he's talking about.</p></div>"|8926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8926-madness-love-and-mysticism/|7.6|Dominique Leone

Once you've begun creating something, it's easy to find yourself off on some tangent you never saw coming. It takes a certain amount of discretion, and often, a certain amount of objective distance, to decide which roads to continue down and which ones to abandon. In music, this is, of course, where producers come in. Their job is essentially to stop the artist from getting carried away with a questionable idea and to moderate decisions about direction and material.</p>
<p>Past Sparklehorse efforts have been plagued by a certain lack of focus. This doesn't mean they weren't good records-- in fact, 1998's <i>Good Morning Spider</i> was something of a creative triumph, even in spite of its general disorganization. That said, though, hiring an outside producer (not to mention fully ridding himself of all drug habits) seems to have done Sparklehorse frontman Mark Linkous a great deal of good. Superproducer Dave Fridmann has developed a certain Midas Touch over the years, imbuing nearly every album he works on with a distinctive sonic character, and <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> has his fingerprints all over it.</p>
<p>The most focused Sparklehorse effort yet, the album flows along with the grace of a river occasionally stirred by a rapid or two. The half-songs and quickly squelched ideas of Linkous' past releases are absent in favor of fully fleshed pieces stuffed full of mellotrons, optigans, orchestrons, and sundry humming keyboards. Only once is its flow badly disrupted. (We'll get to that in a second.)</p>
<p>The majority of <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> brims with electro American gothic ballads and fuzzy purees of lo-fi and hi-fi aesthetics. There aren't really any out-and-out rave-ups like ""Pig"" or ""Happy Man,"" but a few of the mid-tempo numbers display enough bite for commercial radio play. (I'm asking too much, aren't I?) ""Gold Day"" snags the ear with a concise melodic hook and some snazzy mellotron flutes. And Linkous' defiantly surrealist approach to lyrics is in full effect here, with all manner of references to smiling babies, organ music, birds, and celestial bodies.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the lyrics are so surreal that it's hard to imagine they're even metaphors for anything. When Linkous implores, ""Can you feel the rings of Saturn on your finger?"" in the Vic Chesnutt-cast-adrift-in-a-post-modern-sound-collage number ""Sea of Teeth,"" it's hard to believe that there's much hidden meaning behind it. Animal imagery also abounds; bees, poison frogs, roosters, dogs, doves, and horses all pop up on the first track. How exactly the line, ""I'm full of bees that died at sea,"" proceeds logically to the title refrain of, ""It's a wonderful life,"" is questionable at best, but the claustrophobic mix of optigan, static, chamberlin, and Linkous' plaintive delivery redeems the lyrical content with beautiful production and shimmering instrumentation.</p>
<p>The soulful PJ Harvey duet ""Piano Fire"" picks up the energy a bit, proffering lyrical imagery of dusty organs and pianos washing up on beaches, amid a heavily distorted guitar racket and subtly employed electronics. In different places, <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> conjures recent Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, and Grandaddy, all bands who operate in roughly the same headspace as Linkous. The quietly bleeping ""Apple Bed,"" in particular, recalls some of <i>The Sophtware Slump</i>'s more elegiac moments.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's that one aforementioned sore thumb that interrupts the otherwise smooth flow of the album, so allow me to preface my next statement with the following diatribe: I love Tom Waits. His music is rarely short of brilliant on some level, and I've long admired his position as one of the most fearless, innovative, and downright unique songwriters on the planet. The man's craft is his genius personified, and I can't get enough of it.</p>
<p>So why does his contribution to <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> suck so much? ""Dog Door"" is a miserable distraction. Imagine you're floating down a peaceful river on a raft. It's just you, the trees, the birds, and the fish. You don't have a care in the world. Then, suddenly, the violent hillbillies from <i>Deliverance</i> swoop down out of nowhere, pelting you with rocks and shouting an unmemorable phrase over and over again in an annoying, processed falsetto. That is ""Dog Door."" Allow me now to sulk like a denied child.</p>
<p>The flow of the album actually picks back up rather easily after ""Dog Door"" finally, mercifully ends, returning to the eerily placid fare that characterizes the rest of the proceedings with ""More Yellow Birds."" Soon after, ""Babies on the Sun"" closes things on a tired, but musically inventive note, with burbling electronics and looped string samples supporting typically cryptic lyrics.</p>
<p><i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> is a strong offering for Sparklehorse, largely shaking off the excesses of past efforts (maddening Tom Waits collaboration aside) in favor of cohesion and structure. The focus unfortunately keeps Linkous from accessing any truly awe-inspiring standout moments like the ones on past records, but the overall result is a lot more rewarding in the long term.</p></div>"|7398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7398-its-a-wonderful-life/|7.7|Joe Tangari

    was released, Q-Burns Abstract Message's lone operator Michael Donaldson has
    changed his allegiance. <i>Invisible Airline</i> is more than a tad influenced
    by Everything but the Girl's salon-ready deep house. And though the breakbeats of
    his past aren't entirely absent, they're definitely subdued, and their quelled
    presence gives this album a maturer, more adult-orientated sound.  Gak.</p><p>
    On <i>Feng Shui</i>, Donaldson began to introduce guest vocalists.  On this
    latest album, he's granted access to six guests spread out over eight of the
    album's twelve tracks.  Lisa Shaw-- an apprentice diva who's appeared with Ital
    Shuur's Milk and Honey project, on DJ Swingsett's <i>Sights Unseen</i> and
    collaborated with Jay Denes for the sofa-house staple, ""Always""-- gets the most
    exposure.  Once the opening track, a lightly congaphonic instrumental called
    ""Hey! Star City,"" has faded out, Shaw takes over for ""Shame.""</p><p>
    Emerging from an fx-haze, Shaw sings of leaving a significant other and not
    caring what she's left behind.  Riding Donaldson's ticky-ticky percussion, a
    Fripp-like guitar charts an ethereal course.  Here, Shaw tries to match the
    star-fondling guitar with hints of Cocteau Twins frontwoman Elizabeth Fraser's
    celestial phrasing. I grudgingly like ""Shame"" until a steel drum ensemble takes
    a ""why this? why now?"" eight-bar solo.  Then, after the incongruous Caribbean
    interlude, Donaldson falls back to looping, phasing and EQing all the other
    elements until the allotted six minutes are up. ""Shame"" will rightfully appear
    on many second-division <i>Chillin' on Salinas Beach</i>-type compilations.
    But it will never achieve everlasting fame in the canon of sublime disco.</p><p>
    ""Differently"" continues Shaw's hardly-winning streak, this time joined by
    percussionist Eugene Snowden.  The track is a ballad written from the POV of
    someone who's died with a few regrets. ""Know there's a vision of my world
    you'll see/ If I could I would do it differently/ Mmmm..."" Shaw's delivery of
    these potentially poignant banalities is as though she were reciting a bus
    schedule.  I grant she trembles a bit before she mumbles, ""Ain't nobody singing/
    Don't want to bring it back/ Yeah, no need/ Don't hear nobody singing/ Don't
    want to bring me back."" But trembling is no guarantee of provoking empathy.
    Meanwhile, percussionist Snowden, though credited, is undetectable.  Unless
    that's him slumped against the patch-cord container, clapping.</p><p>
    Bereft of (or abandoned by) his collaborators, Donaldson fares much better. The
    instrumental ""Amusement Park Heart"" returns to the nu-disco of the opening track
    and proves that Donaldson is a capable motivator of the human glute.  Unfortunately,
    the track doesn't quite reach the same intensity as his early victories,
    ""Enter/Other"" or ""Bugeyed Sunglasses"" (both compiled on 1998's <i>Oeuvre</i>).</p><p>
    The blues duo of slide guitarist Elmo Williams and percussionist Hezekiah Early
    guest on Donaldson's reworking of ""Mother's Dead,"" the cheery opener of their
    1998 album, <i>Takes One to Know One</i>.  Suddenly, it seems like Donaldson is
    after the same crowd that devoured St Germain's ""Alabama Blues."" Nothing wrong
    with that goal, except Donaldson forgot that it took the remixing genius of Todd
    Edwards to turn ""Alabama Blues"" from stodge to a club necessity.</p><p>
    Politely reverbed and chorused indie guitars hallmark ""Innocent,"" Donaldson's
    pleasingly blatant grasp for some college radio airtime. Shaw responds, ensuring
    that her lyrics are cappuccino-frothy and easily digestible by the future lawyers
    and accountants of America.  By comparison, the guitars on ""Drifting Off"" could
    be taken as a tribute to Hüsker Dü, until Donaldson quells them so that Shaw can
    unveil her passable Debbie Harry impersonation.</p><p>
    Eugene Snowden returns for the <i>Oeuvre</i>-ish instrumental ""Asa Nisi Masi,""
    and this time, his cowbells and timbales are audible-- until Donaldson's digital
    percussion overwhelms them. Snowden's also hidden somewhere in the skippy,
    yuppie-disco mix of ""You Are My Battlestar,"" but again, amidst Donaldson's
    favored ticky-ticky percussion and delicately two-step bassline, Snowden seems
    virtually absent.  Later, relying on a whammy bar for innovation, Donaldson imbues
    ""This Time"" with a threat of grit before Shaw's charm-schooled vocals banish the
    menace. The track is thus reduced to a club song for couples who agonize about
    which crèche will most benefit their first-born.</p><p>
<i>Invisible Airline</i> closes with ""Dreamland,"" a solo Donaldson performance
    that showcases his talent for downtempo wallpaper. As it opens, the song shows
    immense promise. The rhythm track is edgy, almost hinting a glitch-style of
    programming. The bassline, while never dangerous, certainly snarls in an
    unpleasant manner.  But Donaldson soon vanquishes these unsettling elements so
    that a tinkly trance piano figure can parade his predictable professionalism.</p><p>
    Michael Donaldson doesn't explicitly tell us where his invisible airline travels
    to, but all the indications are that, rather than making stop-offs in less
    comfortable, but much more challenging places, <i>Invisible Airline</i>'s lone
    destination is the distant isle of Morcheeba.  Seats are always available.</p></div>"|6624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6624-invisible-airline/|4.7|Paul Cooper

    Múm as ""twee electronica, the Belle &amp; Sebastian of IDM.""  A perfect description.
    But before twee electronica, there was twee trip-hop, and the great Los Angeles-based
    Slabco label's roster boasted the undisputed champions of the genre.  Some of
    the early Sukpatch cassettes-- recorded when they still had a girl singing lead--
    feature the most childlike Mo Tucker-style ballads sung atop samples of menacing
    rap loops, an absolutely killer combination that I've never heard done as well
    since. As suburban kids raised on the music, Sukpatch, Land of the Loops and
    Volume All-Star were among the first to hear something warm, nostalgic and a
    little sad in the hip-hop break.</p><p>
    Explosion Robinson is a one-man project by Steve Herman, who did time as a member
    of Sukpatch.  And if you're familiar with that band, you probably have a good
    idea as to what Explosion Robinson sounds like: light instrumental hip-hop pieced
    together with well-crafted beats, plenty of Moog, bits of scratching, and samples
    galore. It's a familiar formula for long-time Slabco diehards such as myself, and
    Explosion Robinson executes it with style.  Still, after Dynomite D and Draco
    offered new takes on the Slabco sound last year, this album suffers a bit for
    being such a retread.</p><p>
    ""Down Home"" opens the album with a vocodered voice saying, ""Prepare to activate,""
    instantly leading me to believe I'd grabbed the nearby Emperor Penguin CD from
    my collection by mistake. But then the beats fold in, and I knew I was miles away
    from those stiff (if charming) Chicagoans. ""Gold Chain"" has some greasy wah-wah
    Moog work, a nice laidback Dre-inspired cut for chillin' that also has a tendency
    to just lie there without ever grabbing the listener by the collar. ""Work It,
    Bitch"" cops a new wave vibe, with a self-consciously herky-jerky synth refrain,
    a rare scene from Gary Numan's happy childhood.</p><p>
<i>The Luxury Leader</i>'s grooves are what save it from complete blandness. In
    addition to their melodic sense, the beat construction was always Sukpatch's ace
    in the hole. Though the songs were and are numbingly repetitive (in the best
    possible way), Sukpatch's beats had a real swing to them, vaguely connected in
    my mind to the jazzy production of Native Tongues-era hip-hop. Explosion Robinson
    comes close to matching this rhythmic verve, but the songs consistently fall just
    short of being catchy.  Something's missing: voices.</p><p>
    ""Glass Packs"" is the perfect example of a nice backing track crying out for some
    foreground.  It's got a solid bass riff, punchy drums and ear-catching sampled
    refrains, but could use either a melody or some rapping out front to give it
    focus. <i>The Luxury Leader</i> seems like an decent sketch for what could have
    been an excellent album.</p></div>"|2877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2877-the-luxury-leader/|5.7|Mark Richard-San

    nature.  High-end CGI animations may elicit ""ooh's"" and ""aah's"" from us now, but
    in a few years, we're going to look back at something like the <i>Final Fantasy</i>
    movie and just laugh, the same way we currently laugh at an outdated special
    effects extravaganza like <i>King Kong</i>.</p><p>
    Still, there's something oddly cool and impressive about a movie like <i>King
    Kong</i>, or even a more recent laughable special effects wankathon like
    <i>Starship Troopers</i>.  It seems to be woven into the fabric of the human
    mind to be impressed, or at least entertained, by any kind of artificial reality
    that is at all analogous to our own.</p><p>
    This principle extends perfectly into the realm of electronic music, where the
    quest for new and interesting sounds and the quest to electronically emulate
    organic sounds intermingle with concurrently fascinating and wildly entertaining
    results. Good electronic music provides the excitement of hearing a sound that
    you've possibly never heard before, and the fun of being able to try to figure
    out what that sound's sources was.</p><p>
<i>Supermogadon</i>, the latest album from Josh Presseisen under his Marumari
    alias, wonderfully captures the intriguing synthetic façade of sci-fi. But
    whereas its predecessor, <i>The Wolves Hollow</i>, was oftentimes outright
    cheesy and cartoonish, <i>Supermogadon</i> is much more subtle and subdued.
    <i>The Wolves Hollow</i> drew its inspiration from a fictitious story of
    Plutonian wolves and cow brains; <i>Supermogadon</i> draws its inspiration from
    Ray Bradbury's <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>, converting chapter titles to song
    titles and co-opting cover art.</p><p>
    Like <i>The Wolves Hollow</i> before it, <i>Supermogadon</i> takes a wonderfully
    warped approach to the futuristically fake.  Barely audible vocal tracks are
    buried beneath drum machine beats and bubbly synthesizers. ""Indigo Florist,""
    the album's standout track, layers synthesized bells with staticky drum machines
    and bouncy bass synthesizer. The song retains a relatively constant feel as new
    elements are added and removed, making for a subtle, gradual development. Sure,
    it doesn't necessarily reach through your headphones into your ears and violently
    shake its contents like a British nanny, but it certainly captivates when given
    proper attention.</p><p>
    Another highlight comes with ""The Mutated Wisdom,"" a song that harbors many more
    twists and turns than most of the tracks on <i>Supermogadon</i>. A dissonant
    chorus of voice-like keyboards, a popping IDM beat, and sine wave synthesizers
    construct a clearly-defined rhythmic and melodic skeleton. Digitally manipulated
    squeaks scurry over the song like extraterrestrial rodents as a smooth drum
    machine beat shifts the track's rhythmic focus.  At the end, everything fades out
    except for a distant echo of a synthesizer, which also quickly disappears.</p><p>
    Indeed, distance seems to be a sonic theme of <i>Supermogadon</i>. Most of the
    melodies on the album are obscured and faded-- a drop in aural resolution that
    causes many of the sounds on the album to bleed together into a far-off,
    semi-terrestrial sonic landscape. Occasionally, the very prominent drum machines
    seem a bit forced or obvious, only distracting from the intricacy of the more
    obscured melodic workings. Rather than making the subtle sounds seem more
    accessible, oftentimes the drum machine beats on <i>Supermogadon</i> have the
    opposite effect, contrasting the other sounds too harshly to let them shine
    through.</p><p>
    I'll concede that I've never read <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>. Nor have I seen
    the 1980 USA Miniseries adaptation with Bernadette Peters and Rock Hudson. But
    from what I've heard of Bradbury's classic, the sense of obscured unreality
    found on <i>Supermogadon</i> makes perfect sense. Using music instead of language,
    Pressiesen can convey this feeling in an instant, rather than fifty pages. Like
    a book, though, <i>Supermogadon</i> demands a significant portion of your
    attention to be fully appreciated.</p></div>"|5125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5125-supermogadon/|7.8|Matt LeMay

Anything too aggro starts to churn my guts
    and gives me a tummyache. Mr. Wright is a soothing substance, sliding into my
    ear canals and down to my esophagus, coating my stomach.  (Okay, that's gross.)
    Some of it splashes into my brain, numbing the back of my head.  Though, that
    numbness could be due to me lying in the bathtub for going on about three hours
    now.  My spine has become one with the imitation porcelain.</p><p>
    
    Yes, Kevin Wright makes ideal music for falling asleep to in the bathtub.
    (Warning to impressionable young minds: do not fall asleep in the tub. Didn't
    you see <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i>?  On another topic, why don't horror
    movies have monsters anymore? Why is it all riddles and helping the ghosts?
    Helping ghosts isn't scary. Before we leave these parentheses, let me remind
    you that the subject is Mr. Wright's music and falling asleep in the tub.) As
    the water bobs, I imagine the waves of the sea.</p><p>
    
    See, the ocean is a repeated theme on this album.  Mr. Wright is a sailor, free,
    as he asserts on <i>Hello Is Anyone Out There</i>'s opening track, ""Sailor on
    the Sea.  He lives on ""Ocean Boulevard."" His lover lives by the sea, as we learn
    on ""Darling Honey,"" a song about loving and knowing someone without knowing her
    name. This track, with its lilting verses and gently lifting (sounds like a
    brassiere, but it isn't) accordion phrase, stays in my head, tranquilizing me.</p><p>
    
    The Mr. Wright sound is simple and homogeneous throughout the record. An acoustic
    guitar strums basic chords, a keyboard blows like a zephyr, the drummer strokes
    the drums with his brushes, and Kevin Wright croons like the Divine Comedy's
    Neil Hannon.  Wright avoids Hannon's histrionics, which could make him more
    palatable, but sometimes he's restrained to a fault. There are moments when
    the music gently surges and Wright sounds like he has the range to go for a high
    note, but instead sinks back into his wry, almost spoken baritone. Maybe he can't
    go anywhere else.</p><p>
    
    Another problem plaguing <i>Is There Anyone Out There</i> is its sameness.  The
    tunes are smartly written, but they all stick with similar sounds and emotions.
    You want him to branch out-- hell, even do a bouncy showtune or something like
    Scott Walker sometimes launches into.  Even the nice electric piano solo on
    ""Ocean Boulevard"" can't keep the song from slips beneath the gentle lapping
    waves.</p><p>
    
    On a sad note, as I was trying to dig up some information on this guy, I typed
    <i>Is There Anyone Out There</i> into a search engine. I came up with 186,000
    entries, none having to do with Mr. Wright. Keep looking, people.</p></div>"|5483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5483-hello-is-anyone-out-there/|7.2|Dan Kilian

If you asked
    her, she'd probably say it was never her true calling and was foisted on her by
    former bandmates and collaborators out of inconsiderate necessity.  I could buy
    that.  Singer first, housepainter second, dog owner third, and songwriter fourth
    (tied with ex-publicist for Bloodshot)-- that's how she'd self-identify, I'd
    wager.  Songwriting to Hogan seems nothing more than a chore, an unhappy exercise
    that's just a means to an end (the ""end"" being getting to sing it).  So, what's
    the best way to get out of a chore?  Anyone with a sibling knows the answer:
    get someone else to do it.  Which is exactly what she's done on her new record.</p><p>
<i>Because It Feel Good</i> is her sophomore solo album, not counting last year's
    collaboration with the ad hoc Pine Valley Cosmonauts, <i>Beneath the Country
    Underdog</i>.  But perhaps we <i>should</i> count it.  This album has a lot more
    in common with <i>Underdog</i> than it does Kelly's first foray recording under
    her own name-- 1997's <i>The Whistle Only Dogs Can Hear</i>.  A group of stellar
    musicians, for example, including Andrew Bird on the catgut, Bloodshot session
    guy Jon Rauhouse, and Rock*A*Teens frontman Chris Lopez on loan, handling Futura
    and organ duties.  The other common trait is the lack of Hogan originals versus
    the hand-picked covers: 80% hand-picked covers to be exact.  Contrast that with
    <i>Whistle</i> where two-thirds of the songs were Hogan or Hogan/Taft compositions
    and you quickly get the sense that Kelly's heading into Mary Lou Lord territory
    with her increasing reliance on cover tunes.</p><p>
    
    The two songs Hogan does offer us are among the best on the album.  ""No, Bobby
    Don't"" has a poodle-skirt, 50s doo-wop vibe.  Hogan's rich, butter-thick voice
    teams up with Andrew Bird's light touch on the violin for a very classic,
    <i>Grease</i>-like moment.  Later on, her second track, ""Sugarbowl,"" is the only
    thing that comes close to sounding like her earlier work: powerful, arching vocals
    and a playful melody spiked with bittersweet lyrics.</p><p>
    
    The covers are more of a mixed bag and, ultimately, are what prevent this album
    from being a stronger release.  Always known for tossing in a left-field choice
    or two, Kelly tackles Smog this time.  It was nice to hear ""Strayed"" from
    <i>Dongs of Sevotion</i> filtered through Kelly's comparatively sunny vocal
    treatment.  A weird warping of Charlie Rich's ""Stay"" closes out the album.
    Heavy-effects organ, pedal steel and a complete lack of percussion brand the
    song as Hogan's unique interpretation.  The result is a nearly a cappella feel,
    despite the fair amount of instrument being worked over in the background.
    Yet, while both are nice, neither is necessarily essential.</p><p>
    
    Other covers don't fare so well.  <i>Because It Feel Good</i> opens with a
    singular treatment of the early 70s hit, ""I'll Go To My Grave Loving You.""
    Other than the novelty of hearing a Statler Brothers song stripped of virtually
    all of its Statlerness, I don't feel moved at all by a very empathic rendition.
    Other weak moments abound in song donations and gifts from relative unknowns
    (Amy Pike is still flying below even the most sophisticated musical radar).
    And the Randy Newman song near the end of the disc is a slight improvement on a
    lesser song by the king of cornball piano-pop.</p><p>
    
    But what are we really reviewing here, Hogan's taste or her creativity?  Well,
    due to the nature of the project, both actually.  Can Kelly sing?  Like no one
    else on this earth.  Paradoxically sultry and angelic, her wonderthroat is
    tinged with a jazzy-loungy vibe that traces all the way back to her early 90s
    days with the Jody Grind.  Hear it once and you'll never mistake it again.  The
    disc is worthy of some attention just because it's another rare moment when her
    swoon-inducing voice is put to plastic.</p><p>
    
    Can she pick good songs to cover?  Once upon a time, yes, but not so reliably
    here.  A few of the tracks were interesting to hear recast-- ""Strayed,"" King
    Floyd's ""Please Don't Leave Me Lonely""-- but at least an equal number were
    unwelcome guests.  I could have accepted an EP-- one that was that much lighter
    and leaner for having jettisoned the Randy Newman and Statler Brothers at the
    minimum.</p><p>
    
    Can she overcome her reluctance to pick up the pen and write with the kind of
    self-confidence that will allow her to start churning out albums instead of
    ""projects"" or ""collaborations?""  I don't know, but it sure would be nice.</p></div>"|3899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3899-because-it-feel-good/|6.1|John Dark

They're not quite indie rock, they're not
    quite soul, and they're not really country.  Call them an alt-country band and
    you're liable to be the unfortunate recipient of a fourteen-against-one all-out
    beating.  Their influences seem to come from all over the map, resulting in an
    eclectic and thoroughly fucked up amalgamation of country, soul, fuzzy lo-fi,
    classical music, 70s AM, outright noise, and mumbled Appalachian folk.</p><p>
<i>Tools in the Dryer</i>, Lambchop's very own odds and sods collection, comes
    14 years after the band made their first rudimentary recordings as Posterchild.
    Of course, it doesn't really provide any more insight into what they are,
    exactly, but it does offer a wide-ranging glimpse of Lambchop's career trajectory--
    from their lo-fi bedroom days as a trio in 1987 to the 14-piece line-up that
    played England's Queen Elizabeth Hall in 2000, backed by an eight-piece string
    section.</p><p>
    
    Sequenced in random order, and bookended by the A and B sides from their first
    Merge Records seven-inch, <i>Tools in the Dryer</i> is perhaps best reviewed by
    breaking it into logical categories.</p><p>
<i>Category 1: Remixes:</i><br/>
<i>Tools in the Dryer</i> contains three Lambchop remixes, conveniently lumped
    together as tracks 11-13.  Unrest's Mark Robinson gives up an abstract, beatless
    mix of ""The Militant"" off <i>How I Quit Smoking</i>, and it's the best of the
    three, deconstructing pieces of the original and adding organ interludes and
    string swells to create a sparse soundscape.  Zero 7's smooth funk remix of
    <i>Nixon</i>'s ""Up with People"" removes the lead vocals from the original,
    leaving only the gospel-inspired backing vocals for a decent R&amp;B; throwback.</p><p>
    
    The Doppelganger remix of the band's cover of Curtis Mayfield's ""Give Me Your
    Love"" (from 1998's <i>What Another Man Spills</i>) is least successful,
    neutering the deep, throbbing bass groove that made the band's own version so
    ridiculously sexual, in favor of generic dance grooves.  It also unfortunately
    thrusts frontman Kurt Wagner's annoying falsetto to the front of the mix, which
    can grate a bit on the nerves if you're not prepared for it.</p><p>
<i>Category 2: Demos:</i><br/>
    Ah, demos.  Is there any finer insight into a band's creative process?  Two of
    the three demos included here are culled from 90-minute tapes that Lambchop
    recorded as a three-piece in 1987, in bassist Marc Trovillion's bedroom.
    They band recorded the tracks on primitive equipment with a microphone taped to
    a push broom, and named the resulting opuses things like ""I'm Fucking Your
    Daughter.""  They were still called Posterchild at the time (at some point, the
    Poster Children's lawyer told them they'd better change their name, so after
    rejecting R.E.N. and Turd Goes Back, they settled on Lambchop), and the results
    of these sessions are about as unmarketable as anything you've heard.</p><p>
    
    The crust on ""All Over the World,"" with its cheeky countoff and horrifyingly
    out-of-tune recorders, is so thick that you'd think it came off a wax cylinder.
    And its companion, ""Style Monkeys,"" doesn't sound a hell of lot better.  It's
    propelled by a crummy drum machine and features Kurt Wagner's banshee
    caterwauling way up in front again.  The third demo is much more recent, recorded
    in Wagner's living room in 1992.  ""Each with a Bag of Fries"" is actually mostly
    coherent, and the buzzing of the bass amp in the background is more endearing
    than annoying.  It certainly doesn't hurt that it's not a bad song, either.</p><p>
<i>Category 3: Live tracks:</i><br/>
    The band offers only two live recordings on <i>Tools in the Dryer</i>, culled
    from drastically different periods in their evolution.  Though extremely lo-fi,
    the 1990 recording of the strangely Lou Reed-ish ""Flowers of Memory"" (performed
    at a now-defunct vegetarian cafe in Nashville) still exposes the song for the
    good composition that it is.  Meanwhile, ""Love TKO"" is drawn from the
    aforementioned Queen Elizabeth Hall show on their 2000 UK tour, during which
    they were supporting their highly polished <i>Nixon</i> album.  The track
    possesses an infectious energy that was sadly missing from <i>Nixon</i> itself,
    and it's nice to hear that the band, in their maturity, hasn't become completely
    wrapped up in Steely Dan studio perfectionism.</p><p>
<i>Category 4: A-sides, b-sides, and compilation tracks:</i><br/>
    This is the largest category, and also the one that makes <i>Tools in the Dryer</i>
    worth purchasing for non-diehards.   The compilation opener, ""Nine,"" comes
    bursting out of the gate with harmonized scatting and a typically subdued Kurt
    Wagner melody.  Bill Killebrew's guitar unleashes an avalanche of
    Pavement-inspired riffs and noise as the band combines doo-wop with slacker rock
    for a truly unique recording.  ""Cigaretiquette"" emphasizes the band's soul roots,
    opening with a chord progression and feel that's reminiscent of, of all things,
    Tommy James' ""Crystal Blue Persuasion.""</p><p>
    
    The band's brilliant, moody take on Vic Chesnutt's ""Miss Prissy"" follows,
    sucking countrified steel guitar out of its natural element and placing it
    into a dark, brooding folk march.  Wagner's limited vocals do their best to
    carry the melody as someone strums piano strings or an autoharp (it's hard
    to tell, really) in the background.  ""The Petrified Florist (alternate take)""
    is an appropriately icy, piano-driven dirge, which clarinetist/saxophonist
    Jonathan Marx claims, in his generous liner notes, is one of the most difficult
    recordings the band ever made.  The remaining songs from this category run the
    gamut from brisk indie rock (""Scared Out of My Shoes"") to ramshackle noise-folk
    (""Or Thousands of Prizes"") to brooding, mumbly, music box-inflected shoegazer
    country (""Moody Fucker"").</p><p>
<i>The Conclusion (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Avoid Smooth Segues):</i><br/>
<i>Tools in the Dryer</i> presents an excellent opportunity for fans of Lambchop
    to get a hold of some of the band's rarest tracks, including a few that rank
    among their best.  And, for better or for worse, it also gives you a sneak peak
    at their embarrassing awkward stage, before they had the money or the backing to
    enter a real studio.  Tack on a few throw-away remixes and two worthwhile live
    tracks, and you've got yourself a deal.  It won't convert any new fans, but
    those already in the know may want to get in on this.</p></div>"|4655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4655-tools-in-the-dryer/|6.7|Joe Tangari

    of music every two years; make the requisite live appearances; then rest on your
    laurels collecting royalties, tipping martinis and lighting your blunts with
    flaming Benjamins.  Seriously, how much work could it take to piece together an
    album?</p><p>
    
    Most electronic artists release only a fraction of what they produce.  Just as a
    painter might draft sheafs of studies and sketches before approaching her canvas,
    a musician might discard hundreds of samples and dozens of mixes before stamping
    his seal on a song.  And for every track that makes the grade for release, there
    are often several that never see the light of day.  Behind the best songs lie
    days-- if not weeks-- of sweat, toil and self-censorship.  Regrettably, you won't
    find many of these songs on <i>Mensa Dance Squad</i>.</p><p>
    
    The calling card of performers like Wesley Willis and the Shaggs is their
    unrefined, unpracticed, so-bad-it's-brilliant sound.  Fair enough.  But this
    gimmick could never translate into the world of IDM, where every glitch is
    deliberately laid and every beat extensively mapped, where accidents are planned
    and precision is key.  When electronic music comes across as underdeveloped or
    unduly sloppy, I consider it a fault, not a virtue.</p><p>
    
    Most of Lesser's one- or two-minute noodlings on <i>Mensa Dance Squad</i> strike
    me as jejune experiments, rough sketches in an artist's notebook, or unmolded
    ideas never brought to fruition.  The songs-- few of them actually worthy of
    that description-- seldom rise to the bar set by Lesser's previous efforts or
    the rest of the Tigerbeat6 catalog.</p><p>
    
    A few diamonds sparkle up from the rough-- all of them longer pieces that hazard
    some attempt at structure and take time to elaborate on their themes.  ""Mensa
    Dunce Squad (Leg Up Program),"" offsets the manic attention span of Lesser's
    percussive cannonade with soft melodic motifs, whose recurrence brings a sense
    of cohesion to the song.</p><p>
    
    Credit for the album's standout actually goes to Kid606, whose nine-minute ""Don't
    Techno for Answer"" remix closes the album by rehashing samples from the entire
    record.  The Kid's contribution outdoes Lesser at his own game with a brilliant
    ADDDM montage that evolves from raga-rooted drill-n-bass into passages of
    cavernous ambience and cacophonous fury.  The tune comes to rest on a tranquil
    synth refrain, immaculately punctuated by quirky beats and a disembodied but
    intangibly resonant vocal sample: ""Once again, ladies and gentlemen.""  And then
    the disc whirs to a stop.</p><p>
    
    The first five tracks on <i>Mensa Dance Squad</i> range in length from just over
    a minute to just under three minutes, and juggle sounds from the same basic
    sample kits.  ""Mensa Dance Squad,"" ""Ensam Dance Squad,"" ""Nsame Dance Squad,""
    ""Samen Dance Squad"" and ""Amens Dance Squad"" were clearly intended as variations
    on the same theme.  Unfortunately, it's difficult to discern any continuity
    between the tracks, and none of them stand alone as songs.  They're really just
    units of sound-- kernels from which songs might bloom, but never do.  And given
    so little time to evolve, none of these sonic experiments ever pan out.  Instead,
    they build up riffs that never mature, and propose ideas without examining their
    nuances.  ""Samen Dance Squad"" entices the listener with a menacing, low-register
    drone and a dizzying mix of time-spaced harmonic oscillations, but abruptly
    vanishes at the 1:12 mark, segueing into the fifth track.</p><p>
<i>Gearhound</i>, the album Lesser released on Matador earlier this year,
    showcased him in better form.  On that album, he drew out the individual songs,
    meditating on structure and conceding sparse melodic flourishes.  Nothing he
    has to offer on <i>Mensa Dance Squad</i> rivals the idiosyncratic, surreal tones
    of <i>Gearhound</i>'s ""Obligatory Glitch Worship"" or the slow-mounting staccato
    onslaught of ""Hindu Shuffle and Force.""</p><p>
    
    With <i>Mensa Dance Squad</i>, Lesser seems to be thinking out loud, haphazardly
    attacking the canvas before penciling a single sketch.  Meanwhile, we're left
    with the uncensored results of his efforts: a few tantalizing soundbytes that
    hardly warrant a $12 purchase.</p></div>"|4753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4753-mensa-dance-squad/|4.9|Malcolm Seymour III

It's a well-known story, but one that
    bears repeating. Forming in Chicago in the late 80s, the band released four
    remarkable albums of howling roots-rock deconstruction before losing their
    stateside distribution when Rough Trade's American division went belly up.
    Anachronistic and difficult to classify, these four albums-- <i>Fe</i>,
    <i>Flubber</i>, <i>Around the Horn</i>, and <i>Sonny</i> (now back in print
    on tUMULt Records)-- were largely ignored at the time of their release, and
    the situation was not helped by infrequent touring and a lack of press savvy.
    More recently, the band has toiled in near obscurity, releasing two albums on
    German labels since the mid-90s.  In the end, though, Souled American was
    probably just too arty for a genre that puts such a high value on ""authenticity.""
    Fortunately, the band seems to prefer its cult status.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's hard not thinking about what might have been. The more or less
    contemporaneous Uncle Tupelo (which eventually split into Wilco and Son Volt)
    was handed the alt-country banner and basked in the spotlight while Souled
    American quietly pursued their craft in the darkness. ""No Depression""-- the
    movement and the accompanying magazine-- could have just as easily been called
    ""Feel Better"" (the final track on <i>Fe</i>), if given a slightly different set
    of circumstances.</p><p>
    
    Now, more than a decade after that first Souled American album, the alt-country
    ""movement"" has become more of a twitch.  Hype, always a fickle mistress, has
    left the <i>No Depression</i> magazine cold, and it's cheating heart has moved
    on to other lovers.  For a while it was Britpop, then a drunken orgy with
    countless electronic artists, then a debauched evening with post-rock before
    moving on again.</p><p>
    
    Souled American's guitarist Scott Tuma decided to move on as well, parting with
    the band amicably after the 1996 release of <i>Notes Campfire</i>. Judging from
    the all-instrumental <i>Hard Again</i>, his first solo album, Tuma just wanted
    to move away from traditional song structure. Taking a more expressionistic
    approach-- using multi-generation guitar loops, organ drones, skittish
    percussion, and banjo so far removed from ""fiery bluegrass breakdowns"" that it
    almost sounds like traditional Japanese Koto music-- <i>Hard Again</i> sees
    Tuma teaming up with Dirty Three percussionist Jim White and Michael Krassner
    of the Boxhead Ensemble, two groups with which he shares an aural affinity.</p><p>
    
    Opening with the cold and distant ""Beautiful Dreamer,"" Tuma eases you into the
    sound of <i>Hard Again</i> as if easing you into icy water-- that is, very, very
    slowly-- deliberately setting one guitar tone against another in an almost
    painterly fashion.  And like many tracks on <i>Hard Again</i>, the song ends
    abruptly, suggesting it was born out of longer improvisational sessions.</p><p>
    
    ""March"" begins similarly, but builds to a thicker texture reminiscent of
    Robert Fripp and Brian Eno's collaborations, while the aptly titled ""JimWhite
    Drums"" swirls droning guitar over what sounds like a sped up tape of Jim White
    assembling a drum kit rather than playing it. The title cut is the most
    song-oriented track here, with a definite beginning, middle, and end.  But
    ""Sermon,"" the closing song, best sums up the album's mood: meditative and
    austere, but majestic, as an otherworldly organ echoes through what sounds like
    a long-abandoned cathedral.</p><p>
    
    Anyone familiar with the latter-day, slow-as-molasses Souled American albums
    will see <i>Hard Again</i> as a natural extension, or at least as an abstract
    interpretation of where that band was heading.  Fans of the above mentioned
    Dirty Three and Boxhead Ensemble-- as well as David Pajo or even Neil Young's
    <i>Dead Man</i> soundtrack-- will find solace within these ethereal sounds.</p></div>"|8183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8183-hard-again/|7.0|Jason Nickey

    pulling metal from a seething furnace and banging it into a useful shape.  But
    as with any trade, the mark of a true craftsman is the ability to make the
    difficult seem effortless.  In this light, Graeme Downes can be considered a
    craftsman as well.  For Downes, his furnace is a piano and the sheet music
    scattered across his floor like dying sparks.  We imagine Downes with a pencil
    wedged behind his ear, working diligently on song after song, trying to
    perfectly place each note on the pages.  Over the course of fifteen years and
    six albums, Downes managed this impossible task with his old band, the Verlaines.
    Now, with <i>Hammers &amp; Anvils</i>, he crafts these songs only for himself.</p><p>
    
    Out of all the Flying Nun Records alumni (including more influential groups like
    Tall Dwarfs, the Chills, and the Clean), the Verlaines were the most regal and
    refined.  Sure, the songs would march along in that strum-happy fashion that
    became synonymous with the New Zealand underground, but then a string section or
    a vocal chorus would enter the fray, taking the song in an unexpected, wonderful
    direction.  The best Verlaines songs combined Downes' two capital music
    influences: his academic musical studies (formerly a student of classical music,
    he's now a lecturer at New Zealand's Otago University), and his rock music roots.
    Regardless of whether the songs featured distorted guitars or oboes and clarinets,
    Downes' lyrical romanticism remained constant and fervent.  Comparisons could be
    made between the Verlaines and the Wedding Present, but where David Gedge seethed
    and raged, Graeme Downes would sigh and swoon, even at his most frenzied.</p><p>
<i>Hammers and Anvils</i> isn't much different from his Verlaines output, except
    for its lack of grandeur, which is easily explained by the fact that Graeme
    played all the instruments here (which include guitar, piano, trumpet, and
    clarinet) and co-produced the record.  The milieus presented range from just
    Downes and his guitar (on the opening title track) to a full-band arrangement
    with a digital orchestral backing (on ""Rock and Roll Hero"").</p><p>
    
    Though there are a few aggressive, rockier numbers (like the band-like ""Alright
    by Me"" and ""Cattle, Cars, and Chainsaws""), these are the exception.  The solitary
    nature of this album is best exemplified in its quieter moments, like the piano
    balladry of ""Mastercontrol,"" or the Tin Pan Alley saunter of ""Cole Porter"" and
    ""Getting Out of It.""  Not surprisingly, it's in these quieter songs that Graeme's
    wary romanticism is best expressed-- in ""Cole Porter,"" he confesses to be ""like
    Fred Astaire with concrete in my shoes,"" while the ethereal ""Shoreleave"" offers
    a different sort of confession: ""I'd trade the world and all its storms for four
    walls in your arms.""</p><p>
    
    In some ways, <i>Hammers and Anvils</i> may be the most accomplished album of
    Downes' career.  The range exhibited throughout these thirteen tracks shows the
    mind of a truly skilled craftsman at the top of his game.  If there's a criticism
    that can be leveled at craftsmen, though, it's the fear of one's mastery
    overwhelming the desire that originally led them to pursue that craft.  In this
    instance, there's no need to worry of such loss.  But why take it from me, when
    Graeme says it himself:</p><p>
<i>Now don't try explaining<br/>
    Why no love can change me<br/>
    When the whitecaps drop diamonds<br/>
    I gotta dive down to find them</i></p></div>"|2434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2434-hammers-and-anvils/|8.5|David Raposa

    <i>Will You Find Me</i>, in which he called the album a tired collection of love
    songs sang in 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths that tries really hard to be pretty.  He was
    dead on.  Not surprisingly, <i>The Braille Night</i> could be described in the
    exact same terms, and not just because its songs were recorded during the same
    sessions, and left off for release as a separate album.  (Kind of like <i>Kid
    A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i>, except for that whole being awesome thing.)  Only in
    a world with little justice could Ida make the same album twice and expect Matt
    and I to write two different reviews.</p><p>
<i>The Braille Night</i> is a bit slower and sparser than <i>Will You Find Me</i>,
    but while Ida may tweak their formula by more adding drums, strings, bagpipes,
    and even band members with each consecutive album, they consistently deliver the
    same cloying Ida.  I'm not sure Ida's fans are looking for anything new, though,
    as the pleasures this band delivers are centered around nostalgia, sentiment and
    repetition.  When challenged, none of these fans will ever suggest that Ida
    are brilliant; instead, they defend the band with sappy looks that say, ""But
    they're Ida!""</p><p>
    
    Ida's first album, 1995's <i>Tales of Brave Ida</i>, featured only guitars, bass,
    and lovers-- Liz Mitchell and Dan Littleton (a former member of the punk band
    the Hated, and the ex-guitarist for Jenny Toomey's old band, Liquorice). Ida's
    sophomore effort added Dan's brother Michael on drums.  In 1997, violinist Ida
    Pearle joined the band (she also designed the synchronized swimmers that glide
    past perfect stars on <i>The Braille Night</i>'s cardboard sleeve, as well as
    the ones in the liner notes of Ted Leo's excellent <i>Tyranny of Distance</i>).
    Beekeeper's Karla Schickele also came along around that time, adding her bass,
    piano, and of course, her harmonies, to the proceedings.  Then, on November 20th,
    1999, Liz and Dan married.  The love keeps growing.</p><p>
    
    While conjuring images of feeling through darkness to find meaning with one's
    fingertips, this album's title, <i>The Braille Night</i>, grasps at poetry.
    And although I'm not quite sure what it means-- it seems to refer less to a
    touch or a tactile text than to a night that asks you to read differently-- I
    like it.  In sound, Ida define ""The Braille Night"" as a quiet Wurlitzer drone.
    Often, the drone is pierced with Pearle's bow which pushes through the album,
    lingering until it rests as the backdrop to the album's eighth track, the
    detached observational travel-log, ""Gladiolas.""</p><p>
    
    ""Blizzard of '78"" is <i>The Braille Night</i>'s first single.  It begins with an
    overbearing progression that sounds like the band's take on an 80s arena anthem,
    and then mellows into a bland, harmonized ballad exclaiming, ""You're a thousand
    miles from here/ You just want to disappear.""  But it doesn't end there-- Ida
    keep stepping up the volume as they continue: ""Beauty shines so bright/ Vanishes
    from sight/ Wrap yourself in the night/ Go with all your mi-[building]-iii-[building]-iii-[building]-iiight-ah!""
    It's intense!  Like a blizzard!</p><p>
    
    The full sound of ""Blizzard of '78"" empties out into the appropriately titled
    ""So Worn Out,"" a track which pairs the simple guitarwork of vintage Ida (no
    drums) with Dan Littleton's lullaby vocals.  But Ida are most palatable at their
    least cohesive. In moments where plucked guitar wanders off in directions that
    the violin seems unaware of, or when Mitchell and Littleton fail to harmonize,
    they can sound playful and delicate.  Unfortunately, Ida too often go for swells
    of perfectly united voices, or plucked arpeggios and chords that rise up to form
    the empty structures of an emotional climax that waits to be filled with lyrics
    scribbled in diaries.</p><p>
    
    If any musical ideas, inspiring stories, or passionate impulses are lost in
    <i>The Braille Night</i>, it's because they're hidden too deeply in the romantic
    trappings, and can't be considered a reason to listen.  In fact, if there's any
    reason to listen, I can't tell you what it is.  All I know is, Ida are holding
    fast to the same pretty, pretty harmonies they've grown so comfortable with, and
    that the story's still the same.</p></div>"|4054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4054-the-braille-night/|5.0|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    times.  No doubt, when the band adopted its moniker, Iran-- the fundamentalist
    Shiite Muslim nation who brought you the 1979 fall of the Shah, the taking of
    52 American hostages and the 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie-- was well on its
    way to taking its place next to King George and Khruschchev in the dustbin of
    America's bogeymen.  These days, however, with the U.S. standing drinks in the
    rogues' gallery of the new world order, the name is no longer quite so remote,
    nor quite so innocuous.</p><p>
    
    But none of this even amounts to a coincidence, as Iran released their debut
    long before the recent national events; truth be told, Iran's album just
    celebrated its first birthday. Before this gets chalked up to <i>Pitchfork</i>'s
    much-maligned tardiness, however, let me submit, in our defense, the fact that
    the headbangers at Tumult Records would sooner push <i>Pitchfork</i> into the
    girl's bathroom than send us the choice fruits of their gloom-and-doom-laden
    catalog. Nevertheless, we would brook no interference in getting our mitts on
    this noise-pop masterpiece, come hell or high water. Besides, what's twelve
    months in the procurement of unabashed excellence?</p><p>
    
    Despite the hostile connotations of Iran's name, this San Francisco five-piece
    is as American as snap, crackle and pop-- which presents as accurate a
    description of their sound as any. The militantly lo-fi Iran seem more
    temperamentally aligned with the electronic progenitors of the glitch revolution
    than with the no wave-isms of their likely influences (DNA and early Sonic Youth).
    The crackling buzz and scuzz in which Iran's sludge-pop is hopelessly encrusted
    seems bent on repeating the question that stands at the heart of all glitch:
    what's the musical difference between function and malfunction?</p><p>
    
    The answer, as always, is: none.  The hissing amp and wheezing microphone can
    perform the same aural magic as their pristine and sound-checked counterparts.
    Let Granddaddy lament the broken appliances; Iran has picked them up and made
    something damaged but nonetheless wonderful.  The tribal bongos, chiming bells
    and serpentine guitars of ""Yellow Lemon Tigers"" scream like a manifesto for
    the entire album: a skittering squall in the place of a formal introduction.
    But ""Tigers"" slips easily into the jagged jangle of ""Pick Up/Stillborn,"" a dirty
    pop gem of fierce drums and thick, distorted guitars. ""Pick Up/Stillborn""
    approaches <i>Slanted and Enchanted</i>-era Pavement in its deadpan vocals and
    accidental but undeniable hooks, chugging sloppily along while the alien synths
    and rattling guitars bend their pitches maliciously in and out of tune. You're
    still whistling its fragile melody long after the tune has dissolved into the
    hearing-test tone poem introduction to ""Dream Summer,"" a densely layered blast
    of tape-looped noise, beneath which lies the surreptitious strum and sweet folk
    reflection that constitutes the album's secret joy.</p><p>
    
    Beneath the din, Iran is an often catchy and always well-crafted folk-rock record,
    disguised by amplification as ""serious music.""  Nothing supports this claim as
    convincingly as the meditative ""The Music Plays Itself,"" where limpid guitars
    reverberate mournfully over railroad noise and faded electronic scratch.  The
    song sounds about as a delicate as a funeral in the middle of Penn Station:
    solace ever in danger of fatal distraction, and ultimately undone. The gorgeous
    wooden acoustics of ""San Diego"" seem to find a small measure of harmony between
    voice, guitar and the insect noise that almost sings along in the background.
    The band's name never sounds so ill-suited as here; there's something so
    breathtakingly American about these noble attempts at beauty amidst clamor,
    without once divorcing the former from the latter.</p><p>
    
    As Clear Channel Communications is feverishly banning from the playlists of their
    1,170 radio stations every band and song that may bear some incidental reference
    to the tragedies of September 11th, it takes no leap of the imagination to
    suspect that Iran would never make it to the airwaves.  Not that Iran's
    malfunctioning masterpiece stood much of a chance on making it to mainstream
    radio in the first place.  But political incorrectness aside, Iran has recorded
    an absolutely amazing American rock record for the twenty-first century:
    dissonant and catchy, meticulous and accidental, pretentious and true. You may
    have to dig around some to find it, but it is well worth uncovering. And like
    the man said: may you live in interesting times.</p></div>"|4123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4123-iran/|9.6|Brent S. Sirota

In the era to
    come, is there a place for either? How much will music change? What will
    step up to replace the cracked glaze of teen pop? Personally, I'm calling on
    everyone to rally around the White Stripes for a definitive change. But with
    my manifesto for such stripped-down blues-rock in hand, how can I pretend to
    care much for another clever band with a flair for arrangement singing their
    hymns to summers past?  The answer, of course, is that variety is the spice of
    life.  But if the truth must be told, I really can't get <i>that</i> excited
    about them, despite the fact that they do create very pleasant, modern sea
    chanteys for Sunday afternoons.</p><p>
    The Original Brothers and Sisters of Love have a taste for Brian Wilson, the
    Kinks, minstrel music, and the sea-- or rather, the great lakes of their Michigan
    home, which are referenced repeatedly throughout <i>H.O.M.E.S</i> (and whose
    names create the mnemonic acronym that is the album's title).  The band consists
    of three gifted songwriters (as well as three other instrumentalists) who sing
    with spirit and finesse in affected growling brogues and sweet, clean falsettos.
    Greg McIntock sings only two of the album's songs, but brings home the trophy of
    ""finest vocal performance"" for the slow piano ballad ""Silent Apologies."" His
    voice uncurls from a lazing Ray Davies croon into a raspy, aching groan before
    lifting to a mournful cry.  Jamie Monger writes and sings the jauntiest numbers,
    which at times sound quite a bit like the Waterboys, while his brother Tim dips
    further into sweet, breathy ballads cluttered with more mementos of past days
    than a grandmother's attic.</p><p>
    It's awful nostalgic, this record.  There's a Tim Monger ode to a vintage Schwinn
    and another to Tigers Stadium, and several references to childhood and forgotten
    other things.  And all these sepia-toned images are lent strength by the gentle
    poetry of the lyrics, and the light, front-porch swing of the acoustic guitars,
    banjos, mandolins and strings.  The violin of Liz Auchinvole (on loan to Michigan
    from New Zealand) is featured often, but it's the almost tuba-like sound of Scott
    McIntlock's bass triplets that anchors these sailors somewhere out on Lake Huron
    in a fictional past, in a world that ""was founded when the world was young.""  As
    Jamie Monger sings on ""East Jesus America"":</p><p>
<i>It was passed down from moon to sun<br/>
    And it's miles away from Motown<br/>
    But when the stars shine drunk with summer<br/>
    Hold back the hair of your lover<br/>
    Yeah, it just breaks my heart just being there, it's true</i></p><p>
    It's nice stuff, yeah.  Very pretty, and capable of earnestness without always
    falling victim to saccharine clichés.  The band's genuine affection for the
    music of the past is endearing.  But I wonder: what will the future bring?</p></div>"|6038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6038-homes/|7.3|Dan Kilian

The leaves have returned, and the air is cool and of     noble weightlessness.  You can clearly see what the past has left behind in the     medieval town squares, and hear the music of Bach's day playing continually from     the opera houses and churches.  Germans, like most of us, enjoy admiring nature.     And since their cities have many parkland areas, it's no surprise to find the     tourists crowding shops while the locals gaze in an auburn splendor.  This is a     country of quaint Bavarian villages and major metropolitan centers, majestic     mountains and beautiful waterways, castles and culture.  So, wouldn't it be nice     if we dropped some acid, holed up like trolls and made an album?</p>
<p>Faust's records have never been the kind you dissect.  The band seems to have     some kind of plan at work, but not the type of plan left for others to follow.     It's not the kind of algorithm that bears any scrutiny; yet, 30 years later,     the music remains.  And given the state of the boys in der Gruppe, that alone     makes it worthy of reissue.</p>
<p>After spending several months in 1970-71 lazing, smoking, and existing rather     superfluously (on Virgin Records' dime, of course), Faust moved their commune     to Wümme in western Germany and decided to get serious.  By serious, I mean they     decided to put to tape the sugarplum visions in their heads.  By sugarplum     visions, I mean the acid-damaged prototypes of the New Solution for Music.  By     music, I mean their self-titled 1971 debut album and its contents, which consist     of the music they played and processed using Kurt Graupner's infamous little     black boxes.  And by Kurt Graupner, I mean Faust's engineer, the sound wave     savior who, perhaps more than any other, was responsible for bringing the group's     adventures in hi-fi to acetate.</p>
<p>""Why Don't You Eat Carrots?"" gets the movement underway with a knall (""bang,"" my     kliene Kinder).  Actually, it's more like the wake of a small jet whose engine     roar is panned out all over your speakers.  In the jet's cockpit, we have ""All     You Need is Love"" and ""Satisfaction"" blaring, if only to remind you that Faust     were at one time human and listening to your music.  Upon reaching an altitude     of about 120 decibels, our captains decide to let the aerodynamic vehicle coast,     dropping a vaguely Bill Evans-esque piano interlude before launching a vaguely     Zappa-esque groove that features some vague kind of shinai solo (or maybe one of     their homemade synthesizers).  I wish I could translate the sheer romantic terror     of the thing, but it's all rather vague.</p>
<p>""Meadow Meal"" follows, and though the intensity has died down a bit, Faust still     resides in the hall of mirrors.  There doesn't seem to be much reason behind the     stuff (other than the ""wonderful wooden"" variety), and though the by-product may     be skewed art-pop along the lines of Throbbing Gristle or Nurse with Wound, the     overwhelming vibe here is of playful curiosity rather than oppressive abstraction.     After a mystical incantation (""And the guess I get it/ And the gate I get it/     And the game I get it""), they break into a trashy rock joint, shimmying like     Monkees on parade.  I suppose they couldn't have kept it down if they'd tried.</p>
<p>And that ends the program as Faust planned it: a total of about 18 minutes of     music before running out of steam and/or money.  What to do, then, but jam out     the mother of all documented freak-outs.  ""Miss Fortune"" is probably not Faust's     greatest legacy, but it is a testament to some fairly unadulterated haze-charisma.     Recorded live, it consists of two rock-esque instrumentals (again filtered     through Graupner's little black boxes), and one fantastic piece of prose set to     a ghostly backdrop of acoustic guitar and admirably understated shakers.  ""And     at the end, realize that nobody knows if it really happened.""  And at the end, I     say ""amen.""</p>
<p><i>Faust</i> wasn't a hit by any stretch, but it was freakish enough to garner a     cult following.  So, with a small sect of the world waiting, the band retreated     to Wümme again, presumably with the intention of making an album that you could     at least play while sober.  That album would turn out to be <i>So Far</i>, their     1972 sophomore release, and the record with which the press (or whomever it was     covering them at the time-- probably just the <i>NME</i>'s Ian MacDonald) caught     up.</p>
<p>Within seconds, the change is obvious.  The steady tom toms and insistent rhythm     guitar of ""It's a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl"" aren't the work of the voodoo shamans     on the last album-- or maybe they are, but under pressure, perhaps Faust just     betray their VU roots more readily (and simultaneously earn their Krautrock     merit badge).  But where there had been chaos, there was now tranquility; where     there had grown paranoia and Dadaism, suddenly there sprouted mystique and     atmosphere.  A good start, but stay tuned.</p>
<p>After ""On the Way to Abamäe,"" we're given signs that all is not well in the     Faust camp.  ""No Harm"" begins with a drawn-out crescendo that leads into a     horn-driven instrumental.  That's about as much as I can say about it.  It's     sort of indistinct, but in the context of the album, and coming from this band,     it seems either very campy and strange, or oddly comfortable.  In any case, the     feeling doesn't last long, as three minutes in, the tune transforms into feverish     blues-rock, with the phrase, ""Daddy take the banana, tomorrow is Sunday,""     repeated ad nauseam.  You know Faust, right?</p>
<p>The funny part about Faust was, no matter how far out they got, they always came     back.  And on the title track, they trade in their acid wisdom for pure Kraut     trance groove-- though very different from Can's avant-funk or Neu's motorik     beat-- via horn punches and a galloping rhythm.  And, like clockwork, just when     you think they've managed the whole acid situation, ""Mamie"" introduces the     buzzsaw of doom, replete with an intimidating synth force field and Moog vomit.     Then, the chanting returns.  The chanting!  It's like some kind of game that     only the Boredoms have figured out how to play since.</p>
<p>I could tell you that the next song goes back to sounding halfway normal (you     know, that ""kids in a dark studio with bipolar musos to the tune of a DeVry     commercial"" kind of normal), and that the last track tells you how many toes and     ears you have, but you get the picture.  It also asks, ""I wonder how long this     is gonna last?"" and if I didn't know it lasted two or three more years, I'd say     about ten minutes.  In the end, history and I were wrong, because both of these     albums have outrun all the detox statistics by maintaining a permanent place in     the hearts of seemingly normal people everywhere.  Okay, so it's probably mostly     greasy lo-fi musicians and acidheads, but there are times when it doesn't pay to     know the difference.</p></div>"|11738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11738-faustso-far/|9.0|Dominique Leone

    six years since their debut, 1995's <i>Music for Nitrous Oxide</i>.  But.
    They.  Continue.  To.  Move.  Very.  Slowly.  That promising first record
    combined crude guitar feedback with some snippets of religious radio
    programming that the band captured in their home state of Texas.  It was
    all likely laid down on a four-track in some living room arranged around a
    double-barreled bong.  <i>Music for Nitrous Oxide</i> was a noble and
    affecting work of home recording, showing that the DIY aesthetic could be
    incorporated into experimental drone music just as easily as guitar-based
    pop.</p><p>
    
    But <i>The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid</i> finds these guys fully
    harnessing the power of the studio, with striking results. Strings and
    horns are all over this record, and the richer palate gives the drones added
    weight and depth.  In 1989, new music pioneer Pauline Oliveros recorded an
    amazing album called <i>Deep Listening</i> inside a 2,000,000-gallon steel
    tank, and the feel of <i>The Tired Sounds</i> is similar.  Like the Oliveros
    record, the listener is meant to focus attention on the subtle build and
    decay inside these layered drones.  Slight breaks in harmony between a violin
    and a shard of guitar feedback carry serious emotional weight. The half-second
    decay of a breathless French horn resonates like a perfect chord change.
    Silence becomes another instrument.</p><p>
<i>The Tired Sounds</i> is an exceptionally long album-- two CDs or three
    LPs-- with six multi-part suites over the course of about two hours.  If this
    were the latest collection of 2Pac rarities, we'd be talking serious sonic
    overkill, but music that evolves this slowly needs plenty of time to stretch
    out. Hence, nothing about this lengthy album feels at all bloated or
    extraneous.</p><p>
    
    The first three-part piece bears the jaunty title ""Requiem for Dying Mothers,""
    and the music itself is fitting. Thick cello harmonies weave between guitar
    drones that have a bright, almost Celtic quality. Changes are paid out slowly
    over the course of close to seven minutes, until the track opens up in its
    second part, introducing periods of silence and deep, foreboding bass pedals.
    Eventually, the band's penchant for field recording rears its head, as the
    20-minute ""Requiem"" transforms into a gothic piece, with spare piano and
    unnamable radio transmissions.</p><p>
    
    ""Austin Texas Mental Hospital"" keeps the party going over the next 20 minutes,
    as guitar feedback and a larger orchestra modulate between two chords, rocking
    back and forth slowly like a self-stimming resident of the facility that gives
    the piece its name. The second part of the track reminds me of the Peter
    Gabriel soundtrack to <i>Birdy</i>, with hints of mechanical breathing
    interspersed with throbbing bass tones and a hanging drone in the middle
    register.</p><p>
    
    The second disc has a relatively lighter tone, with more space around the
    instruments, more keyboards, and less guitar feedback. ""Mullholland"" seems
    like it could be an audition tape for the forthcoming David Lynch film of a
    similar name, glowing with menace like a freshly waxed, cherry-red vanity
    ride. ""Piano Aquieu,"" though, is the real find on this disc-- a minimal piece
    for treated  keyboards, piano and organ, with a yearning melody and a half-hearted
    promise of redemption.</p><p>
    
    The strings return in force on ""Fac 21,"" joining in a thick, Youngian drone.
    The piano-based ""Ballad of Distances"" recalls Labradford as heard through the
    ventilation shaft at Alcatraz, and the three-part ""A Lovesong (For Cubs)""
    incorporates horns and cellos for a more conventional, but no less affecting
    sound.</p><p>
    
    With each record, Stars of the Lid seem to assess what tools are at their
    disposal and then set about seeing how they can maximize the result. Their
    continued explorations into more varied instrumentation and richer sonics
    are a smashing success. Still, in their crowded field, it's hard to say
    exactly what makes Stars of the Lid so special.  It comes to mind that their
    relentless commitment to subtlety sets them apart, as does their masterful
    hand with tone. Throughout <i>The Tired Sounds</i>, dissonance is doled out
    in small portions, perfectly coloring the sculpted fields of sound.</p></div>"|7476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7476-the-tired-sounds-of/|8.6|Mark Richard-San

Those who seek confessional truth and honesty
    in music forget just how inane, obnoxious, and exhibitionistic most people
    who are prone to confessional honesty often are. Anybody can go through the
    kind of emotions that are all too frequently expressed with weak, dime-a-dozen
    clichés.  In many cases, the people with the most interesting minds are those
    who keep themselves guarded, confessing only to themselves, and keeping all
    their thoughts contained well within the confines of their own minds.</p><p>
    As a songwriter, Bill Callahan is about as far from this type of confessional
    honesty as you're likely to get. Rather than telling you more than you could
    ever hope to know, Callahan's records as Smog provide a tiny glimpse into a
    brilliant, interesting, and very guarded mind. Sure, a good deal of Bill
    Callahan's music is dark to point of ridiculousness, and obviously not based
    on any kind of personal experience.  But that dark, often immensely witty
    silliness undoubtedly reflects a side of Callahan himself.</p><p>
    Last year's <i>Dongs of Sevotion</i> seemed to be a step towards a more somber,
    sparse, possibly genuine sound. ""Permanent Smile"", perhaps the most moving
    song Callahan has ever recorded, epitomized this, facing the very real issue
    of death with wise resignation. As one could expect from an album with the
    word ""dong"" in the title, parts of that album-- such as ""Dress Sexy at My
    Funeral""-- were darkly hilarious.  But even with this underlying sense of
    humorous insincerity, or perhaps mocking oversincerity, the album's close,
    skeletal sound helped make it sound very personal. That grim humor is
    certainly not the stuff of typical confessional songwriting, but one
    certainly got a sense that it's the stuff of Bill Callahan.</p><p>
    With <i>Rain on Lens</i>, Callahan seems to have turned almost completely
    away from more understated, tenuous sound of <i>Dongs of Sevotion</i>. Backed
    by Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo and U.S. Maple guitarist Pat Samson, a lot
    of the space that existed on previous Smog records is now filled. As a result,
    the tension that once marked Smog's sound has seriously eroded. There's no
    sense of a spatial void needing to be filled-- no sense of that odd,
    claustrophobic nearness that can come from silence. Because of this, much
    of <i>Rain on Lens</i> sounds remarkably detached, and the end result is an
    album that, while musically excellent, lacks the impact of pre-parentheses
    Smog.</p><p>
    The first installment of a two-part title track opens <i>Rain on Lens</i>
    promisingly enough. Reverb-soaked, trebly guitars ring distant minor chords
    as a bare-bones drumbeat lends the song a subtle pulse. Strings echo the
    guitars, as more wonderfully ambiguous guitar sounds enter the picture.
    Callahan's spare, understated vocals lends themselves perfectly to the
    track. Unfortunately, the briefness of ""Rain on Lens 1"" (a mere 1:27 in
    length) doesn't hold up well against the more substantial runtime of
    weaker tracks to follow.</p><p>
    And those weaker tracks hit instantly. ""Song"" embodies all that's cold and
    distant about <i>Rain on Lens</i>, relying on an overly repetitive, dense
    guitar and bass riff, with no real semblance of emotion or wit. Rather
    than developing over time, ""Song"" just seems to ride along on the same
    endless tick-tock beat and pentatonic guitar plunking. There's absolutely
    no motion in the track-- nothing to make you wonder, or care to wonder, what
    might happen next. Repetition can be a very powerful thing if it builds to
    some kind of hypnosis or bliss, but ""Song"" in no way benefits from it and
    comes across as purely boring.</p><p>
    ""Natural Decline"" suffers from some of the same problems affecting ""Song"",
    often relying for too long on frustratingly uninteresting repetition.  Unlike
    its predecessor, though, ""Natural Decline"" does brew some wonderful musical
    tension.  As Callahan deadpans, ""Or is it just the natural decline/ Of the
    body,"" the music beneath him shifts into a beautifully unresolved, relatively
    dissonant chord-- a much needed moment of sonic conflict.</p><p>
    Both ""Keep Some Steady Friends Around"" and ""Dirty Pants"" are similarly
    repetitive, but benefit from much stronger material. The latter, more than
    any other song on <i>Rain on Lens</i>, uses repetition to its advantage,
    building a gritty minor-chord dirge. What's more, the song actually undergoes
    a significant change in the middle.  Given the extent to which this enhances
    the track, one can only imagine what some more dynamic songwriting could have
    done for the album as a whole.</p><p>
    And when taken as a whole, <i>Rain on Lens</i> is certainly a good album.
    While the music is at times distant and bland, there's enough worthwhile
    material here to make for an enjoyable listen. What's truly missing is that
    little glimpse of something else-- that extra bit of dark personal insight
    that makes Bill Callahan's songwriting so interesting. Sincerity may be
    overrated, but personality certainly is not.</p></div>"|7281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7281-rain-on-lens/|7.5|Matt LeMay

    will remain unnamed.  A couple of years before I became employed there, a
    prankster with a morbid bent sent their offices a plain envelope with a note
    enclosed informing the unlucky recipient that he/she had just been exposed
    to anthrax spores. Faceless men in moon-suits straight out of <i>E.T.</i>'s
    sickbed scene materialized lugging sci-fi looking equipment and quickly
    exposed the hoax for what it was-- a medically benign joke in lethally bad
    taste.</p><p>
    
    Fitting the bill of ""bored suburban asshole teenagers,"" a friend and I came
    up with an idea for a follow-up prank: mail the same magazine office a
    cassette of the heavy metal band Anthrax, with a similar note enclosed. Given
    the severity of the threat, they would have been forced to check whether the
    Anthrax tape actually had any dangerous spores on it.  Fucking ha ha.  Of
    course, five or so years in lockdown is a hefty tag for some fleeting yuks,
    so we never actually went through with it.  But in looking at Atombombpocketknife's
    name, it occurred to me just now that bandnames which include weapons of mass
    death (traditionally the province of metal and grindcore bands) have gone
    really out of vogue.</p><p>
<i>[As an aside, my hypochondriacal self just finished reading up on the very
    current threat of anthrax-- the affliction, not the band. It turns out that
    the inhalant variety (the favored method of dispersal in bioterrorism)
    has a 99% percent mortality rate!  Glad I'm in NYC.  Anthrax jokes have
    gone out of vogue, too, quite suddenly.]</i></p><p>
    
    Look closely at the GIF of this album cover and you'll see a flock of
    soviet-made fighter jets whizzing over the slowly eroding pyramids at Giza.
    It's not a bad cover; taken with the album title it's very evocative, and the
    muted greys and blues are beautiful. And yet-- considering that, even as you
    read this, the largest showing of military airpower since WWII is shaping
    itself into a holocaustal swarm somewhere ""over there""-- it's not quite what
    I want to be looking at right now. Still, the powerful juxtaposition of sleek,
    steel, modern shapes against the massive and silent tombs of pharaohs sets
    the dramatic stage for an amazing rock album.</p><p>
    
    Only, this record is nowhere close to amazing.</p><p>
    
    It's merely pretty good.  Like many before me, and many to come, I will state
    the obvious: Atombombpocketknife sounds like a low-budget Unwound. The singer
    is even called Justin, only in this case, he's a Sinkovich not a Trosper. It's
    a hard similarity to live up to, and these guys make a valiant attempt.  In
    some cases, they even heroically transcend the facile comparison, sounding
    not so much like Unwound as a self-indulgent Quicksand.</p><p>
    
    Sinkovich's even, Thurston Moore-ish delivery carries the majority of these
    rhythm-centric songs, but only so far.  ""Gamma Rays Forever"" elucidates this
    point perfectly.  A quick-tempo, frenetically riffy song, it grips your
    attention well into the improbable five-minute mark.  Unfortunately, the song
    extends two minutes past there, in a mess of crackling feedback, guitar
    harmonics, and a pointless re-rehashing of the once catchy, now just
    irritating chorus.</p><p>
    
    ""Scan Dramatics"" begins marvelously, with an ornate and strangely dancy beat,
    over which Sinkovich sings Satisfact-style melodies and enigmatic phrases:
    ""Under asterisks and departures is a cadence/ So I've settled for broken
    placecards and that's erratic/ Navigations and immigrations they seem
    impressive/ Until they're stapled to the boredom of this stasis.""  Sure, why
    not?  It is, after all, the album's unequivocally great track.</p><p>
    
    There's something uneconomic and unfulfilled in ABPK's two-guitar approach.
    Guitarists Che Arthur and Justin Sinkovich clearly have a great ear for
    unconventional riffage and harmony, but something in their dual approach
    seems underdeveloped. ""Pair of Evil,"" a rich sonic deluge of a song,
    illustrates this problem.  Its entire multi-minute introductory section
    seems to only use one guitar, over brushed drums and dubbed-in ""wind"" noise.
    It aims, I'm guessing, for a desolate, sparse feel.  And it would have worked
    pretty well if not for the sheer length of the part. After the five-minute
    mark (these guys are pretty epic for punks) they redeem themselves with a
    lush, fuzzed out mid-section which includes some second-guitar noodling that
    grounds the murk of the main guitar.  For the most part, though, the
    intriguing but unsteady vocal melody is left out to dry, where it could have
    used some bolstering guitar melody.</p><p>
    
    ABPK recovers on ""Tripwire Tonight,"" a track that boasts the album's coolest
    verse section, as well as dissonant guitar jangle reminiscent of Sonic Youth's
    essential first album and the disc's most driving moments. The truly epic
    final track, ""Violet Encryptions (We Only Move Backwards),"" is not the closer
    I'd have hoped for, but it's close enough. It's still very much Unwound-lite,
    of course, but the guys manage to sound like they're navigating within a
    tradition instead of just sounding plain derivative. After a blistering
    volley of verse-and-choruses, and a sort of weak mid-section with radio-voice
    overdubs, the album ends with a beautiful six-minute instrumental outro that
    recalls the feel of Fugazi's <i>Kill Taker</i>-era gem, ""Sweet and Low,"" if
    a tad more melodramatic.</p><p>
    
    On that note, I've got to go.  The smallpox FAQ I just dug up somehow seems
    more relevant than this album ever will.</p></div>"|346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/346-god-save-the-abpk/|6.6|Camilo Arturo Leslie

I usually don't get too worked
    up about misplacing things, but the film in this camera had been exposed to
    the likes of Bob Dylan, Beck, Neil Young, and Grandaddy at Denmark's Roskilde
    festival. I'll get over that. But I'll never be able to recover any tangible
    evidence of my encounter with eX-Girl, the all-female post-punk trio from
    planet Kero Kero.</p><p>
    
    ""Hold up. Planet Kero Kero?""</p><p>
    
    Yeah, you know, that place where men are giant yellow frogs, and everyone
    loves to eat space mushrooms.</p><p>
    
    ""Oh. I get it.""</p><p>
    
    Well, they're actually from Japan. I haven't quite ruled out those space
    mushrooms, though.</p><p>
    
    Decked out in red, white, and blue skirts with pastel, bloated headdress
    that made Erykah Badu's turbans seem bourgeois, these dirty three were aiming
    to send the entire tent to their home world with neon-fretted instruments, a
    Casiotone, and a drummer who does not sit.  Their treble-heavy Japanese vocal
    timbre is supported by portions of all-out operatic voices and three-part
    harmonies.  Perhaps you can understand my anguish at losing those photos.
    This was a sight to behold.</p><p>
    
    ""Waving Scientist @ Frog King"" opens <i>Back to the Mono Kero</i>, the band's
    second album, with an erratic three-part a cappella about poor King Frog,
    whose space plane is grounded, preventing him from returning to his home
    planet, Frog. The lyrics are in English, but were it not for the transcriptions
    in the liner notes, we would probably never make sense of ex-Girl's ramblings:
    ""Scientist told Poor KING FROG/ 'Get 5 things and mix those up.'/ It'll be
    fuel for the plane to get back sweet home planet Frog. [sic]""  The trio
    proceeds to blast a newswire-ish vocal alert that leads into a fuzz-distorted
    guitar which plays modulating scales to the alternating time signatures being
    quite forcefully beaten out by the standing drummer.</p><p>
    
    To proceed with the already-strange-enough storyline, eX-Girl rallies to
    gather those required ingredients for King Frog: ""Let's get excrements of
    dog/ Marshmallow stuck to the sole of red shoe/ High purity heroin and the
    atom heart mother/ What is the last one?""  All this is sung in a jarring
    melody that appears to be randomly generated akin to the intro.  The subtle
    coherence and frenetic delivery of the vocals, along with the driving weight
    of the accompaniment, make this track the apex of the record.  Not to mention
    the operatic drama of the three-part harmony bridge.</p><p>
<i>Mono Kero</i> doesn't immediately go sour after the opening track, but the
    songs get progressively less enthralling.  Most of the arrangements center
    around out-of-control lyrics and vocal styles, with heavy doses of stand-up
    drumming, overprocessed guitar distortion, and Casiotone thrown in for a bit
    of noise.  However, the smooth harmony and ecstatic vocal delivery in the
    Robin Scott cover, ""Pop Muzik,"" make the song a highlight and an exception
    to the band's formula.</p><p>
    
    An interlude straight from the theme for Disney's Electric Light Parade is
    stuck amidst the 5/4 guitar jangle of ""Cucumber Surrender,"" and feels simply
    gauche juxtaposed with the song's raunchy verses: ""Before you slice him up
    and make him a meal/ Stroke your cucumber/ Let him know how you feel."" The
    synth dream breaks into a Metallican power-chord death-march before retreating
    back into more bizarre double entendres involving ""angry vegetables.""</p><p>
    
    The ten-minute instrumental ""Crime of the Century"" could have provided a
    much-needed breath from the overbearing heaviness and lyrical absurdity of
    the album. Its plaintive main sections of arpeggiated guitar, synth accents,
    and vocal punctuations (reminiscent of Kim Deal's ""eye-yie-yie-yie"" part in
    the Pixies' ""River Euphrates"") succeed, yet this lengthy centerpiece loses
    its footing on the forced avant-garde jazz improv of the guitar and the
    hyper-fuzz bass freak-outs dispersed throughout the track.</p><p>
    
    What seems to be missing from <i>Back to the Mono Kero</i> is not focus, but
    restraint. Many of the songs repeat their gibberish verses multiple times or
    overextend their reach instrumentally.  Live, eX-Girl's energy sustained the
    active flow of the arrangements, thus their sound never got tired. Or perhaps
    I just got caught up in the space mushroom frenzy of it all.</p></div>"|2863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2863-back-to-the-mono-kero/|6.8|Christopher F. Schiel

    ultimately forgettable attempt to cash in on the fleeting big-beat bandwagon.
    After a few years of flirting with mainstream success, courting appearances
    on MTV's ""Amp,"" and landing spots in several soundtracks and commercials, the
    trio seemed certain to drop off the press radar for good.</p><p>
    
    But the sudden resurgence of Daft Punk, whom most critics had left for dead
    after five years of silence, showed that comebacks in the club circuit were
    entirely possible-- some groups work slower than others, but the best ones
    are never forgotten.  Other bygone groups followed suit, emerging from the
    woodwork to milk whatever was left of their fading legacies.  The Crystal
    Method have now blighted the world with a second record, and Fluke, who
    couldn't be bothered to write anything new for the occasion, have pieced
    together a ""best-of"" retrospective.</p><p>
    
    What happens to a group when the money and inspiration runs out, and suddenly,
    they could have sworn there was, like, at least two ounces of weed left last
    time they checked?  This is it: <i>Progressive History X</i>, all your
    favorite hits from Fluke's illustrious, if not totally insignificant, career.</p><p>
    
    The singles on this anthology date back to 1988, a time when people thought
    ecstasy was good for you, so they didn't pay much attention to the music.
    When demand for quality is low, the supply curve usually follows, and these
    tunes seem tailored for an undiscriminating audience.  ""Thumper!,"" the oldest
    song in the mix, just comes off sounding dated and flat.  Fluke add a pinch
    of jazzy bossa-nova flavor to their 4/4 formula, but the rhythms are
    predictable, the cheap samples come straight out of the box, and ""Thumper!""
    drags on for six interminable minutes.  Perhaps it's unfair to judge a
    13-year-old song by today's standards; but by 1988, Tangerine Dream had
    already charted much braver territories, 808 State had released <i>Newbuild</i>,
    and Aphex Twin had composed half of <i>Selected Ambient Works: 85-92</i>.</p><p>
    
    A catchy refrain can't save ""Philly"" from the same mediocrity.  Though more
    melodically engaging than the rest of the trio's early singles, the song's
    stale Casio synths and unbearably tacky vocals reference outmoded influences,
    hinting at traces of Calloway and C&amp;C; Music Factory.  Contrary to
    <i>Progressive History X</i>'s rather pretentious title, tunes like ""Thumper!""
    and ""Philly"" suggest that Fluke were very much a product of their era.</p><p>
    
    The evolution of time brought a modicum of improvement to their sound.
    ""Bullet"" and ""Tosh,"" both taken from 1995's <i>Oto</i>, reveal new dimensions
    of depth previously unexplored in Fluke's repertoire.  The dense, lysergic
    crescendo of ""Bullet"" stands out as <i>Progressive History X</i>'s high point,
    but even this track seems generic and unremarkable against the musical
    backdrop of its time.</p><p>
    
    The bland selection of tracks culled from <i>Risotto</i> is perhaps this
    record's most disappointing fault.  The best parts of <i>Risotto</i> were the
    pieces without words-- songs I'm sure Fluke hesitated to publish as singles
    for want of mass appeal.  ""Goodnight Lover"" and ""Amp"" were actually top-notch
    big-beat tunes, but they're nowhere to be found on this anthology.  Instead,
    we're stuck with the same boring ""hits"" Fluke have been pawning off on the
    public for the last four years: ""Atom Bomb,"" ""Absurd"" and ""Squirt.""  These
    songs rely on nearly identical instrumental arrangements, and their formulaic
    tedium numbs beyond belief.  The vocals struggle to sound suave, but no degree
    of smoothness could sell lyrical drivel like, ""Big yet unfamiliar/ Bigger than
    the biggest star/ Bigger, faster, very hard/ Bigger than the motor car.""
    <i>Progressive History X</i> would have fared better by showcasing
    lesser-known instrumentals from Fluke's catalog.</p><p>
    
    As a retrospective, this album doesn't speak well for Fluke's cultural impact
    or historical relevance.  They come off as fad-followers whose music never
    looked too far ahead of its time.  Unless you can't get enough of yesterday's
    club anthems and don't crave currency in your musical tastes, I would caution
    you away from this purchase.</p></div>"|3114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3114-progressive-history-x/|2.0|Malcolm Seymour III

I missed my biennial chance to stand an egg on its
    end this Saturday in favor of taking the Boston subway out to the beach to
    enjoy one of the last warm weekends we're likely to have this year.  One of
    the things I miss most living in the city is being able to watch the leaves
    turn in fall, when New England's hillsides burst into brilliant, fiery
    displays and then slowly fade to brown.</p><p>
    
    There are certain albums that just seem right for fall.  They have that airy

    the melodies.  One of the great autumn records is Archer Prewitt's <i>White
    Sky</i>.  Everything about it suggests the time of year.  But last year,
    the Kingsbury Manx's stunning debut album-- a swirl of placid folk, downplayed
    country, psychedelic flourishes, and gorgeous harmonies-- joined my mental
    autumn records list.  This year, they're back with another helping.  And just
    in time for the season.</p><p>
<i>Let You Down</i> opens with the title track, stuffed full of warm, lopsided
    guitar licks in the main verses and chilly instrumental breezes in the
    intervening sections.  The rich earthtones of ""Porchlight"" and ""Simplify""
    carry you gently to the rustic, banjo-enhanced folk of ""Et Tu, Kitte?""  The
    spare production of the track breaks up the easy flow of the rest of the
    songs nicely, and also serves as perfect foil to ""Rustic Stairs,"" which
    includes a subtle synth undertow.</p><p>
    
    Little additions to their sound like this are apparent all over <i>Let You
    Down</i>, as the band expands their palette to include things like the Moog
    lines on the excellent ""Courtyard Waltz,"" which, though not actually a waltz,
    is one of the best songs here.  The lilting verses give way to a roiling
    midsection, climaxing in a shower of noise that towers over the rest of the
    album's gently blowing passages like the first blizzard of the year.</p><p>
    
    In their two albums, the Kingsbury Manx have managed to craft a sound for
    themselves that's unique, if not particularly innovative or new.  They opt
    for craft over invention, a strategy that paints them as one of the finer
    products on the modern folk-rock shelf.  Those tumultuous clouds gathering on
    the cover appear on the album, as well, though it's more often in the lyrics
    than the music.</p><p>
    
    Change is evident nearly everywhere on this album, usually in the form of a
    relationship ending.  Stubbornness prevails over common sense on the title
    track, which opens with the lines, ""You were always coming 'round/ But I've
    found that I'm always gonna let you down.""  For the most part, though, lyrics
    seem mostly secondary, as the band usually lets the music set the mood.</p><p>
    
    With <i>Let You Down</i>, the Kingsbury Manx have created a very likable
    second album that rather perfectly captures the falling leaves and southward
    migrations of autumn in its somber chords and crystalline harmonies.  It's
    questionable whether or not the band will ever make the big leap into new
    musical territory, but as long as the albums keep coming this good, I won't
    mind a bit if they stick to this formula.</p></div>"|4451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4451-let-you-down/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    to change his name to Überzone. Since his 1996 debut single for the L.A. label
    City of Angels, Wiles has been relentless in his devotion to synthetically
    squelchy breakbeat electro.</p><p>
<i>Faith in the Future</i>, Wiles' guest-heavy debut album, veers from
    summarizing his output since 1996's <i>Space Kadet</i> EP to pointing out
    the direction he sees breakbeat heading in. Thus, the album awkwardly divides
    in two: the first half showcases Wiles' forward-looking tunes; the second
    takes a brief historical look at his dated earlier work.</p><p>
    Bart Thomas and Bigg Robb of the Sure 2 B crew help Wiles out with the opening
    cut, ""Beat Bionic."" Amid the backspins and crawly scratches by Davey Dave and
    Wiles' filthy low-end analog squirms, Bigg Robb and his pal yell, ""Fly, fly,
    supersonic!/ Check out the DJ!/ Go bionic!"" Not happy with leaving them to
    their own yelling, Wiles vocodes, spins and pitch-bends their chants into
    all-too familiar contortions.  On ""Science Fiction,"" rulin' Jamaican toaster
    Beenie Man rants, ""I'm living real life/ But it feels like science fiction,""
    over a woofer-worrying dub-bass framework.  Occasionally, Wiles will let a
    303 squirm loose, but Beenie Man stands his ground and persists in his
    teaching.</p><p>
    The standout track on <i>Faith in the Future</i> lies in ""Black Widow,""
    Wiles' collaboration with nu-breaks pioneer, Rennie Pilgrem. Beginning with
    a mass of conga rolls and a Todd Edwards-ish slicing of a human voice, the
    track soon evolves into the sonic equivalent of the photophobic aliens in
    the sci-fi flick <i>Pitch Black</i>. Wiles and Pilgrem unleash searing acid
    stabs and caustic Roland 303 burps. The congas and belches rise in pitch and
    intensity until you can't imagine that anyone but the glued-on could remain
    a wallflower if your club DJ dropped this devastating joint.</p><p>
    With Davey Dave back on scratching detail, ""Bounce"" grabs hold of an old
    school breakbeat and throws acid loops and b-boy scratches over it in an
    attempt to throw it off course. But it's a disciplined break, and almost as
    unstoppable as ""Black Widow.""  Electro-lady Lida Husik guests on ""Dreamtime,""
    adding a multi-layered, fractured phoneme vibe-- it almost recalls Laurie
    Anderson's classic ""O Superman""-- to this atmospheric respite from the album's
    off-the-hook rhythmic frenzy.</p><p>
    The snapping snares of ""Rhythm Device"" ensure that we're tossed back into a
    seismic funk foment.  Wiles slathers on filthy analog noise and slices in
    more Todd Edwards-ian cut-ups of Frank Gorshin's manic Riddler laughter. In
    a Josh Wink-type percussive build, a cylon instructs us to ""spread love""
    before the fear of that aforementioned <i>Pitch Black</i> alien chase is
    proven utterly groundless.</p><p>
    Wiles drops the momentum for the dirge-like ""Frequency"" (featuring the
    world-weary and rote vocals of Helmet's Page Hamilton), and follows it with
    the brief and incongruously 808 State ambience of the album's title track.
    But wiles hopes that our faith in his electro will be restored with
    ""2Kool4Skool.""  The track features Afrika Bambaataa, who apparently hasn't
    got off the losing streak that marred Leftfield's ""Afrika Shox.""  Bambaataa
    contents himself with calling out his own name (as well as that of Soul Sonic
    Force), and stating the obvious fact that he's collaborating with Überzone.
    When he collaborated with Westbam, he dropped the mystical vision of, ""Agharta,
    the City of Shamballa.""  If he didn't feel slighted when this track was
    originally released two years ago, Wiles should now feel justifiably scammed.</p><p>
    Crystal Method's Ken Jordan assists with the skippy mess of ""Keep Go-in.""
    Despite the ""keep goin'!"" exhortations of a sampled MC, the track sounds so
    hilariously amateurish that it sounds downloaded off the nothing-excluded
    slop-bucket of MP3.com.  Then, ""Little Dragon"" returns to the squelchy
    balladry of ""Dreamtime."" Though dedicated with love and respect to Bruce Lee,
    the track's definitely aimed at a more feminine audience. Gone are the
    ear-bleed tactics, allowing the song to sway on Karen Lo's pouting (possibly
    Japanese) vocals.  By now, we're really missing the lysergic energy of the
    album's first half.</p><p>
<i>Faith in the Future</i> closes with ""Botz (Synthetic Mix),"" a track from
    1996's <i>Space Kadet</i> EP which unmistakably and irrevocably shows its age--
    it's nothing more than a sterile, professional remake of Josh Wink's acid
    breakbeat classic ""Higher States of Consciousness.""</p><p>
    The inclusion of outdated bric-a-brac such as ""Botz"" and ""2Kool4Skool""
    challenges our faith in Wiles' future. If we're ever going to regard him as
    more than just a promising also-ran, his next album will have to lift off
    from the same launch pad as <i>Faith in the Future</i>. Only next time, he'd
    better not look back.  At all.</p></div>"|8331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8331-faith-in-the-future/|6.3|Paul Cooper

    &amp; Dragons in my youth (14 years is brief, right?), it's that there's no
    escapism quite like role-playing.  Sure, you can immerse yourself in a
    particularly engrossing novel, or see a movie that, for a couple of hours,
    suspends your disbelief so convincingly that you forget where you are.
    But to completely flee your reality, you have to mentally put yourself in
    someone else's shoes.</p><p>
    
    On Chitlin' Fooks' self-titled debut, Bettie Serveert's Carol van Dijk and
    Sukilove's Pascal Deweze both leave their real-world projects behind and
    enter a fantasy land of Nashville twang and Grand Ole Opry glitz.  In fact,
    they so fluidly blend into the new style they've undertaken here that I
    suspect they both have a bit of secret experience rolling the eight-sided
    dungeon dice.</p><p>
    
    For this project, van Dijk and Deweze brought in the material they'd written
    that wouldn't fit in with the sound of their day job bands, as well as some
    of their favorite standards.  Four covers range from the pleasant (Flying
    Burrito Brothers' ""Juanita"") to the ill-advised (the traditional ""Mother's
    Last Words to Her Son"" and Jimmie Rodgers ""Mississippi Delta Blues""). Deweze's
    compositions have a decidedly more pop bent than van Dijk's, whose more
    alternative background sometimes prevents her from seeming authentic in
    this setting.</p><p>
    
    Largely duet-driven, the bulk of <i>Chitlin' Fooks</i> features the heavenly
    blending of Carol's lazy alto and Pascal's smooth, pop pipes.  And on par
    with the harmonies found in classic country pairings Parsons/Harris or
    Campbell/Tucker, ""One Week Later"" opens the disc with an heart-rending tale
    of C&amp;W; love gone awry.  ""You were so sure you'd forget me/ You didn't want
    me by your side/ When someone new came and took you/ I thought I'd be glad
    to say goodbye.""  It doesn't come more traditional than that.</p><p>
    
    But these aren't all slow-dancers.  A couple of the songs are lively, rebel
    yell-inducing numbers, such as the rambunctious ""How Many Times"" and the
    exceptional ""The Battle,"" both of which had this once-and-future geek
    digging through his closet for those sequined and tasseled cowboy boots I
    usually deny owning.</p><p>
    
    One of the more outstanding tracks comes with van Dijk's 50's country lullaby
    ""Picture Book Memories,"" which features some brilliant mandolin playing by
    guest musician Reinhard VanBergen.  Comparisons to Patsy Cline shouldn't be
    tossed about frivolously (and usually aren't), but on this song, Cline's unique
    blend of wistful country-pop is definitely summoned from the past.</p><p>
    
    Supported by a cast of Belgian heavyweights (don't worry, you've never heard
    of any of them), the musicianship here more than matches the phenomenal
    vocal talents of van Dijk and Deweze, and goes a long way toward selling
    the sincerity of this project.  Ragtime, honky-tonk, country pop and old tyme
    are all well represented, in addition to being well executed.</p><p>
    
    But this isn't going to be the disc to use if you want to convince your indie
    rock pals that a lap steel is no reason to write off an album-- it's far too
    conventional for that.  Even those with alt-country leanings may find it too
    down-homey.  If your musical tastes are broad, however, a lot of <i>Chitlin'
    Fooks</i> could charm you with its fun spirit and genuine love for the
    throwback material.</p></div>"|1447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1447-chitlin-fooks/|7.2|John Dark

    in a converted warehouse loft.  Atop the desk sits a Powerbook and a small,
    steel lamp, the room's only source of light.  Here, the man sequences clicks,
    squeals, and an occasional melodic chime into algebraic patterns to create a
    sound as minimalist as his living space.  If he's feeling extravagant, which
    is rare, he may insert a warm drone beneath the squirming pulse.  It's dance
    music you can't dance to, and therefore, intelligent.</p><p>
    This stereotype has long permeated the IDM community, and with good reason:
    it's considerably accurate.  Countless auteurs release hundreds of minimalist
    IDM records every month, and with each new LP, the form seems to grow more
    predictable.  Minimalism has seen its share of classic records, but electronic
    music moves quickly, and its genres invariably die quick, merciful deaths.
    Minimalist IDM isn't buried yet, but it's a limited formula.  And you can
    only do so much with a formula before it becomes stagnant.</p><p>
    Tigerbeat6, the label run out of Oakland, California by that impossibly
    clever electro-brat Kid606, is one of the first IDM labels to take The Big
    Step Forward.  Their concept: stripping intelligent dance music of its
    intelligence.  Often resorting to outright silliness, and sometimes parody,
    Tigerbeat6 is doing for clicks and cuts what Ninja Tune did for jungle in
    1997.  That is, making it fun.  Damn fun.</p><p>
<i>Tigerbeat6, Inc.</i> celebrates the label's incorporation as a legally
    recognized business entity with two discs of uncontrolled mayhem.  Artists
    from several labels-- including the groundbreaking Mille Plateaux imprint,
    Planet \xB5, and Domino-- lent some of their unreleased material to this 44-track
    compilation.  But the spotlight shines bright on Tigerbeat's artists, whose
    music is so fractured and hyperactive it could practically be termed ADDDM.</p><p>
    Kicking off with Gamers in Exile's highly melodic and Macintalk-laced ""I am
    a Decent Man,"" the comp begins on a note that strikes a balance between the
    few ""serious"" tracks here and the general wackiness that infiltrates the bulk
    of the album.  Then, we're flung headlong into ""kick'SC"" by Fossil (aka Pea
    Hix of Optiganally Yours), a just-totally-insane 1\xBD minutes that uses thunking
    drum, sea-sawing bass and manipulated vocal clips as percussion that pauses
    every four seconds to let Hix clue us into where, exactly, he's going to kick
    us (""I'm gonna kick you in... in the face/ I'm gonna kick you... um... in the
    face/ I'm gonna kick you in the stomach/ I'm kick you, SC"").</p><p>
    And it just gets weirder from there.  Cex's ""Furcoat"" features a wack parody
    of the MTV Music Awards before launching into a hilarious hip-hop rap (""Who's
    the man with no clothes, underwear, furcoat, chillin' in tha alley?"").
    Knifehandchop's ""Sun Jammer is My Favorite Pokemon Trainer"" blatantly
    infringes on the copyrights of DMX's ""What's My Name.""  bLectum from
    bLechdom's ""aLways frank"" lays down squirting bass and lo-fi beats for a
    faux-Le Tigre smackdown whose lyrics, provided by Adult Rodeo's Mephany
    Stankins, scream: ""Always, Frank/ You're fucking up!""</p><p>
    And speaking of Le Tigre, Johanna Fateman herself contributes a beautiful,
    shimmering track from her electronic side project Swim with the Dolphins,
    which sounds not a bit like the band she made her name with.  DAT Politics
    ricochet piercing tones off rubberband walls in the joyfully bouncy ""#21.""
    Max Tundra goes Casio with the seemingly boombox-recorded samba/slapbass
    hybrid of ""The Bill,"" and Stilluppseypa gives us the eerie interstellar
    tones of ""Nice Things to File Away.""</p><p>
    But not all of these tracks are drenched in lunacy.  Noriko Tujiko hands in
    ""White Film,"" a gorgeous track off her Mego-released <i>Shojo Toshi</i> album
    in which her lush, multitracked vocals gradually merge into a dense chorus
    of harmony-saturated bliss.  D84's ""Rock-its-hip"" incorporates a female vocal
    sample that seems to have come out of the early 20th century.  Brad Laner
    provides a post-rockin' 1994 cover of Can's ""One More Night"" by his old band,
    Medicine.  Kid606 offers a seven-minute glitch/noisefest with an almost
    trip-hop beat called ""You Just Don't Understand"" that eventually becomes
    submerged in dense washes of shoegazing guitar.</p><p>
    What more can I say about this?  It's fucking brilliant!  In a world where
    90% of dance music heralds itself as ""intelligent"" and ""mathematical,"" it's
    refreshing to find an electronic label that can't discern the difference
    between ""there"" and ""they're"" in their press releases. With this compilation,
    Tigerbeat6 officially establishes itself as the future of IDM.  With sonic
    assaults of unfettered craziness and a roster diverse enough to put even Warp
    to shame, Tigerbeat6 reveals minimalists for the stuffy, gel-haired geeks
    they truly are.  Let's have some music, boys.</p></div>"|2007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2007-tigerbeat6-inc/|9.0|Ryan Schreiber

    scattered songs by D.C. retro-fashion punks the Rondelles, had an
    inspirational effect on me.  It made me want to invent updated 60s dances
    for the 21st Century.  I mean, despite all its obvious merits, the Froog
    really hasn't stood the test of time that well.  But, being the Terpsichorean
    genius that I am, it was with little effort that I concocted the following
    14 rug-cutters for immediate infiltration into the ""popular"" culture-- one
    for each track on <i>Shined Nickels</i>, each designed to reflect the
    character and quality of the song that inspired it.  Make sure you practice
    in front of a mirror, kids!</p><p>
    1) ""Six O'Clock"" - The 'Cardiac'<br/>
    On this track culled from the Rondelles' first seven-inch, frontwoman Juliet
    Swango gives us her worst Justine Frischmann.  Grab your chest in mock pain
    at the non-melody; let your left arm dangle numbly at your side; froth at the
    mouth if you can do that at will. Sway and teeter to the incompetent
    beat-keeping.  It's all over in just a couple minutes.  Just like a real
    heart attack!</p><p>
    2) ""Safety in Numbers"" - The 'Dong (Fully Clothed Version)'<br/>
    This one involves a little imagination.  Pretend you're painting a canvas--
    or a house, it doesn't really matter-- using only your penis (girls, a
    strap-on).  If the time signature and tempo changes throw off your rhythm,
    the handclap and drum breaks provide an opportunity to get back in the swing
    of things.  It's all about momentum, and this song has it in spades.</p><p>
    3) ""Strike Out"" - The 'Shrug'<br/>
    Another early vinyl-only number.  Motivation for doing the 'Shrug' properly:
    you're trying to remove something off your back without the use of your hands.
    It's annoying.  You try moving fast, you try moving slow.  It still doesn't
    come off.</p><p>
    4) ""Shimmybecker"" - The 'Harpy'<br/>
    The monstrous motions of a chicken-hag are perfectly suited to the jerky,
    accelerated ""I Will Follow Him"" verse.  Flap your elbows, move your neck in
    goofy turkeyfowl thrusts.  Tear into your prey in the aggressive, carnivorous
    chorus.</p><p>
    5) ""The Fox"" - The 'Vespa'<br/>
    The title track from the Rondelles' last full-length release, the song has
    a catchy drive that propels it through Iggy Pop Land.  Straddle your
    imaginary scooter and rev periodically with your hands.  Sing-along to the
    grinding guitar hook with some ""vroom"" noises of your own.</p><p>
    6) ""Revenge"" - The 'Spar'<br/>
    Follow the advice of the title and box out your frustrations with lovers
    that have spurned you.  Thuddy bass and drums are your cues for the body
    blows.  Remember to bob and weave on the half-tempo chorus: ""I gave you my
    heart now/ I'm falling apart now/ ...Girls like me don't know when to quit/
    You get revenge now.""</p><p>
    7) ""Backstabber"" - The 'Dong (Semi-Nude Version)'<br/>
    Outstanding lyrics, the most apparent 60s girl group influences, and the
    Church Lady's mini-organ result in a song that is complete beach-party
    bonfire fun.  This absolutely calls for the removal of at least some clothing.
    See clothed version above (#2) for dance instructions.</p><p>
    8) ""Kersmash, Eye My"" - The 'Living Dead'<br/>
    Atrocious.  A song without a brain and with a lumbering, undead quality.
    Like in Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video, reach into the air with both
    hands-- first to the left, then to the right.  Then break into spastic body
    jerks periodically like you're being riddled with shotgun blasts from a
    terrified human.</p><p>
    9) ""Like a Prayer"" - The 'Whore'<br/>
    Once the slow, organic mini-intro concludes and the song kicks in, gyrate
    you hips to keep time to the slutted-up beat.  Grab your breasts often.
    Spread and close your knees in time to the classic punk version of one of
    Madonna's better singles.  Close your eyes often if you feel like being
    overly emotive.</p><p>
    10) ""T.V. Zombie"" - The 'Sally'<br/>
    New-wave sweetness and a bass 'n' organ-driven melody set the stage for the
    story of losing your unrequited love to television set.  The punkier chorus
    reminded me of Black Flag's similarly titled ""T.V. Party.""  For the dance,
    just do your best Peanuts go-go dancer impersonation.</p><p>
    11) ""He's Got Heart"" - The 'March'<br/>
    A swingy intro and verse alternates with a Bratmobile-like shout-chorus.
    The March is a simple enough dance: march in place with exaggerated arm
    swings.  Keep it up at an aerobic ""intervals"" level.  You'll burn calories,
    too, if you put the song on repeat.</p><p>
    12) ""Cafeteria Rock"" - The 'Shimmybecker'<br/>
    Okay, so that's the name of the band that gets covered here (as well as
    acknowledged in the earlier track named after the band).  But it's such an
    onomatopoeic word in this case, perfectly suited to the way your body will
    start involuntarily moving to the most garage rock song on the album.  So
    how exactly do you 'Shimmybecker?'  Just like it sounds, man!</p><p>
    13) ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" - The 'Twirl'<br/>
    This one is easy.  Despite the tempo and guitar crunch, the Rondelles haven't
    really altered this underrated traditional holiday carol.  All you do is
    outstretch your arms and begin spinning-- slowly at first and then faster
    and faster.  When the song ends, fall down.  You can sing along with Swango's
    ""Glooo-oo-oo-oooria's"" if you want to for extra credit.</p><p>
    14) ""Fort Surrounded (Turbo Mix)"" - The 'Mush'<br/>
    A bad experimental noise-collage calls for bad interpretive dance.  So use a
    lot of the pseudo-goth, smoke-like hand manipulations.  Also, sort of
    half-lift your feet off the ground, as if wearing Mafia-fitted concrete
    shoes.  You have to keep it up for 4\xBD long minutes.</p><p>
    And there you have it.  As soon as you've mastered these, head straight to
    your favorite clubs and indie dive bars to give them a test drive.  Make
    sure you tell your friends where you learned them, because I guarantee
    they will ask.</p></div>"|6829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6829-shined-nickels-and-loose-change/|5.9|John Dark

    or ""pussy,"" and you turn your nose up at the lack of sophistication. No
    laughter escapes your tightly pursed lips. You fume with rage, images of
    smug, pathetic 13-year-olds spending daddy's cash on the newest Adam Sandler
    record cascading through your highly evolved brain.</p><p>
    
    But those tightly pursed lips are trembling. Somewhere deep inside you, buried
    beneath back issues of <i>The New Yorker</i> and piles of free jazz CDs,
    something is happening. Almost like a little 13-year-old boy kicking you in
    the nuts from the inside and saying, ""Dude! Holy shit! That is fucking funny!""
    Sure, you can deny this reaction. But the fact remains that, when executed
    properly, juvenile humor can be absolutely hilarious. If the timing's right,
    the phrasing's right, and the context's right, a well-placed ""fuck!"" can
    translate into unquestioned excellence.</p><p>
    
    Of course, establishing the correct context, timing, and phrasing is not at
    all easy.  And establishing it in such a way that it will entertain upon
    repeated listening is practically impossible.  Ween's debut album, <i>God
    Ween Satan: The Oneness</i>, is a massive, near-overwhelming bombardment of
    profanity, hard rock riffing, and goofy genre parody. But no matter how
    absurd Ween are being, they always manage to accomplish a seemingly
    contradictory task: sounding exactly like every band operating within
    the genres they attack while sounding only like themselves.</p><p>
    
    ""You Fucked Up"" is a perfect mission statement for Ween-- a sloppy, furious
    faux-metal number with recklessly shrieked, flat-out hilarious vocals. Granted,
    there's nothing particularly funny about the lyric, ""You fucked up/ You
    fucking Nazi whore!"" But in the context of a psychotic hard rock song, it's
    difficult to miss the humor. ""Tick"" couples the overblown rage of ""You Fucked
    Up"" with a unique brand of twisted, gleeful pop, while ""Don't Laugh (I Love
    You)"" distills this warped glee to its purest, most cloyingly twee essence.</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""Tick"" and ""You Fucked Up"" succeed largely because they tap into
    that most primal, basic urge to rock out. Sure, there's an undeniable element
    of parody to these songs. But the parody is backed up by the fact that the
    songs themselves are actually really, really good.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, <i>God Ween Satan</i> isn't all crunchy riffs and barely
    contained screams.  Stylistically, the album is absolutely all over the place.
    ""L.M.L.Y.P.,"" a longtime fan favorite and live staple, takes on the obscure
    Prince b-side ""Shockadelica,"" adding a distinctively Ween twist. Cheesy talk
    box guitars and slapbass provide perfect backing for a hilarious take on
    Prince's over-the-top sexuality, with Gene Ween's effects-laden vocals
    intoning in a high-pitched warble, ""Let me lick your pussy/ Let me lick your
    cunt.""  At over eight minutes, ""L.M.L.Y.P."" does come awfully close to
    outstaying its welcome. But let's not forget that ""Purple Rain"" clocks in at
    an eternal 8:40.</p><p>
    
    ""Squelch the Weasel"" is the closest thing to a folk song to be found on <i>God
    Ween Satan</i>. Unlike the straight-up lyrical imitation of ""Cold Blows the
    Wind"" from <i>The Mollusk</i>, ""Squelch the Weasel"" is a folk song about...
    weasels. Lyrical and musical elements from traditional folk music, or at
    least the commonly held notion of what traditional folk music should sound
    like, permeate the song, but there's no question that this is pure Ween.</p><p>
    
    The same can be said for ""Up on the Hill,"" a gospel-styled number about the
    demon god Boognish that is perhaps the closest thing to a theme song the
    brothers Ween have recorded.  A dramatic, multitracked Gene Weens croons,
    ""When I was younger/ My momma told me/ She said, 'Gener, I wanna smell it'/
    And then she smelled it/ And it was smelly/ And I said, 'Lordy lordy lord,
    I'm coming home."" It's gospel, but it's totally fucked. And yet it's pulled
    off convincingly enough that it can be enjoyed just as much outside of the
    context of a parody as inside.</p><p>
    
    Like any 29-song schizophrenic freakout, <i>God Ween Satan</i> is not without
    its highly questionable moments. ""Common Bitch"" is a weaker version of ""You
    Fucked Up."" ""Mushroom Festival in Hell"" gets points for sounding exactly like
    its name, but also loses points for sounding exactly like its name. The
    aforementioned ""Don't Laugh (I Love You)"" closes with a frightful swirl of
    toneless vocals that, though annoying, seems to be in keeping with the pure
    dementia of this album.</p><p>
    
    But this, the ""25th Anniversary Edition"" of <i>God Ween Satan</i>, finally
    fixes the one biggest problem that confronted the original: undeniably shitty
    production. The whole album played at what seemed like a good 10 decibels
    below most other CDs, and the sound quality in general was aggravatingly
    muddled. Finally, thanks to the magic of technology, <i>God Ween Satan</i>
    can be heard in all its crisp, pure glory, without the loss of the
    rough-edged sound that's been a major element of the album.</p><p>
    
    And it's a good thing, too, as this is one of the most wonderfully twisted
    albums ever to be released upon the unsuspecting masses. Unafraid to say
    ""fuck"" for no apparent reason, unafraid to rock out on cheesy metal riffs,
    and unafraid to pick to pieces just about every variety of music, Ween
    managed to capture the essence of their sound on their debut as well, if not
    better than, on any later album.  And as a result, <i>God Ween Satan</i>
    isn't just good.  It's fucking good.</p></div>"|8608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8608-god-ween-satan-the-oneness/|9.6|Matt LeMay

    cloud).  Occasionally, stretches of time may appear to float by in a light,
    airy fashion (cirrostratus); but sometimes, trouble sets up camp directly
    above you and gives you a good, prolonged dousing of bullshit (nimbostratus).
    But life seldom resembles an enormous, majestic, white, floating anvil
    (cumulonimbus).</p><p>
    
    Now that we've addressed the album title, however obliquely and dismissively,
    I feel ready to move on.</p><p>
    
    Well, then!  In commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the demise of
    KRS-One's career, I'd like to serve you some boogie-down style ""edutainment""
    today.  Consider, if you will, the following contrasts.</p><p>
<i>Population</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: 16,393,221<br/>
    The Ivory Coast:  5</p><p>
<i>Life Expectancy</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: 44.93 years<br/>
    The Ivory Coast: [insert joke of your choosing]</p><p>
<i>Capital City</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: Yamoussoukro (official), Abidjan (unofficial)<br/>
    The Ivory Coast: Boston, MA</p><p>
<i>Form of Government/Head of State</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: ""Democracy""/Laurent Gbagbo (seized power in coup, October, '00)<br/>
    The Ivory Coast: Committee/Jay Cox (vox, gtr), Nick Hubben (bass), Drew
    O'Doherty (gtr, vox), Scott Craggs (there's an ointment for that; synth),
    Mahmood Shaikh (drums).</p><p>
<i>Natural Hazards</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: heavy surf, no natural harbors, torrential flooding during
    rainy seasons<br/>
    The Ivory Coast: an over-reliance on their influences, and an uncomfortable
    imbalance between admiration and flat-out mimicry.</p><p>
<i>Exports</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: cocoa, coffee, palm oil<br/>
    The Ivory Coast: highly enthusiastic, synth-laced indie-pop reminiscent of
    certain aspects of Polyvinyl labelmates Rainer Maria, coupled with the
    production values of another Massachusetts indie outfit, the Swirlies, and
    betraying an obvious hankering for the feel of Modest Mouse's last full-length.
    Oh yeah, and the vocalist comes off like a low-budget version of Edsel's
    singer trying to sound like Superchunk, with a pinch of Ben Weasel.</p><p>
<i>External Debt</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: US$13.9 billion<br/>
    The Ivory Coast: Incalculable debt to Vanessa Downing of the great, defunct
    Wicked Farleys for her vocal contributions to tracks 6, 7, and 10, and a
    lesser debt owed to Jeffrey Goddard of Karate for blowing his horn (trumpet,
    actually) on track 8.</p><p>
<i>Historical Overview</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: I don't want to read your hate mail any more than you want to
    write it.<br/>
    The Ivory Coast: The quintet released <i>The Rush of Incoming Traffic</i> in
    2000 on Big Top Records, a full two years after it had been recorded. Thus,
    they had a couple years of honing their songs and their shtick before
    defecting to Polyvinyl and releasing this sophomore effort, <i>Clouds</i>.</p><p>
<i>Conclusions</i><br/>
    Cote D'Ivoire: a sure bet to supplant the United States as <i>the</i> global
    hegemonic power.</p><p>
    
    The Ivory Coast: the outlook for this New England five-piece is not as
    certain. <i>Clouds</i> is without a doubt a solid album. High points include
    ""Five Little Graves,"" a sparse, spacy, sing-songy ode to love gone sour that
    recalls early Seely; ""Sixty-Five Percent"" a late-80s-style straight-up rock
    song that degenerates into an electronic outro like something off Depeche
    Mode's <i>Violator</i>; and, a short charming acoustic short entitled ""To My
    Brilliant Wigmaker,"" which boasts the album's best vocal line and chord
    changes.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, there are certain prominent problems.  Though vocalist Jay Cox
    is adequate, and sometimes better than that, his singing is the band's
    greatest shortcoming. His melodies would be better suited by a fuller, more
    in-command vocal style. Felix Houphouet-Boigny, Cote d'Ivoire's father of
    independence, was said to have a booming voice. Cox's, by comparison, is
    brittle and wavering. Will these indie popsters do right by history? Only
    time and their third album will tell!</p></div>"|4142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4142-clouds/|6.6|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    below.  He could hear the voices of his band members on the breeze.</p><p>
    
    ""Phil!  Killer show, man,"" said Jeff.</p><p>
    
    ""Wicked show,"" said Mike.</p><p>
    
    Phil turned.  He could remember the day he'd taken Mike Baldwin aboard their
    little ship.  One glance at Mike's six-string bass and Jeff Wojtysiak bristled,
    cradling his five-string.  There'd been a friendly competition between the two
    ever since, each throttling their bass in constant maneuvers for one-upmanship.
    It was the backbone of the Volta do Mar sound.  Sometimes he felt trapped
    between the Scylla and Charbydis, playing guitar with them.</p><p>
    
    ""Dude, we fucking rocked.""  Tony Ceraulo.  Fastest drummer in northeast
    Illinois, first mate.</p><p>
    
    They did rock.  The band started with the three songs on their EP, barely
    seventeen minutes long.  ""...is the Turn of the Sea"" was always a great
    introduction, explaining their name and all that.  Phil would cast a strident
    line with his guitar, whipping back and forth until the bass descended like
    an angered bull.  They'd turn the notch up and blare for twenty seconds or
    so, quiet it down with some soft arpeggios and spacious bass, then shift into
    a series of tight, interlocking motifs.  Of course, another lull would be
    needed before the crashing, double-speed conclusion.  Audiences would look
    confused, wondering where the microphone was, but by the end of their
    six-minute pieces they'd sit back surprised, hardly able to comprehend all
    that had just been heard.</p><p>
    
    ""Did you see that long-haired metalhead?"" Jeff asked.  He was totally wigging
    out, his head all wagging back and forth.  I think he scared the scenester
    next to him.""</p><p>
    
    Mike replied, ""The one with the Tortoise shirt?  They were there together! I
    saw them talking in-between sets.  We had his head nodding, too.""</p><p>
    
    ""Munich Air Disaster"" was harder to play.  Phil dug up some chords that chimed
    on the upbeat, a jaunty little melody that would appeal to all the jazzheads.
    Then they slowed down, the bass groove brooding in the depths-- a pause, then
    the expected freakout, distortion spreading the violent tempest around.  Phil
    found himself shredding just to keep pace, and he didn't like the ending, when
    everything sped up until the jam reached its logical conclusion.  The most fun
    piece to play was ""Mass Transit Highway(s).""  Phil led with an airy, Steve
    Vai-style tease, but then Tony would fire off some fills on the cymbals that
    sounded faster than playing cards in bike spokes.  Jeff and Mike gave nods to
    Dave Pajo later on, whether they'd admit to having heard Aerial M or not.</p><p>
    
    Phil shook his head.  ""It was alright.""</p><p>
    
    ""I know Tony lost a few sticks, he was playing so hard,"" Mike frowned.  ""Did
    you get one stuck up your ass, man?""</p><p>
    
    Phil shook his head.  ""When the show was over, I wandered up here to watch
    the sun go down.  After a while I could make out a figure approaching along
    the coast.  This tall old guy was making his way slowly across the boulders,
    taking his time.  Eventually, he was standing right next to me, a grizzled
    old bastard, wrinkled and smelling of sea salt.  Probably an old sailor.""</p><p>
    
    The codger had cleared his throat.  <i>""Volta do Mar, eh?  Tightest act touring
    the West Coast, they'll probably say.  I bet you fancy yourself the latest in
    a line of indie bands with nautical imagery.  A regular Victory at Sea,
    courtesan to Rachel's, yep?  Stuff it.  The ocean moves in a million
    mysterious ways, boy, and you wouldn't last a second out there.  You got no
    'post,' just this.""  He handed over a rock. ""And maybe you're not as taut as
    those krautrock bands, but ya need to learn how to roll.  You're all sharp
    edges, boyo.  Why, I remember the June of '44...""</i></p><p>
    
    ""Dude, what did you say back?!"" Tony blurted.</p><p>
    
    Phil shrugged.  ""Not much.  He just turned towards the sea, and walked away.""</p><p>
    
    Mike shifted to the other foot, restless.  ""And then he sailed away on the
    Jolly Roger, right?  Damn, Phil, you can never tell a good story.""</p><p>
    
    Jeff laughed.  ""No, it was a crane!  God sent a crane right down, lifted him
    back up to the heavens...""</p><p>
    
    The three walked away, chuckling.  Phil turned and watched the surf wash up
    on the shore, mixing the sea, the cake, the seaweed, the tracks leading from
    the sand to the water.  The rock sunk with barely a splish.  He'd show that
    old man.</p></div>"|8486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8486-volta-do-mar-ep/|7.0|Christopher Dare

    singer/guitarist for defunct emo math-rockers Braid.</p><p>
    
    The Firebird Band sound nothing like Broach's old band, so fans of Braid
    might as well approach his new project as something entirely separate.  Gone
    are the urgent, overwrought vocals and raging guitars, replaced instead by
    drunkenly burbling synths and lethargic tempos.  It's post-punk diluted into
    an ambient soup, and quite frankly, it's incredibly unengaging.</p><p>
    
    The EP opens with ""Summertime Boyfriend,"" a song lost in a primordial stew of
    programmed non-beats, pick-sliding guitars and reverb.  Broach's voice calls
    out through the haze, muffled by processing and struggling to place a melody
    on lyrics that aren't really about anything.  As it turns out, this is merely
    the intro to the title track, and after about two minutes, the chorus to ""The
    Drive"" kicks in, buoyed by an actual backbeat and a little tambourine.</p><p>
    
    The refrain of ""San Francisco, California to LA, CA, USA"" is marginally catchy,
    but it struggles to breathe under the surface of the band and the muddy
    production of emo engineer Wendy Schneider.  If it were allowed to open up
    and really let loose, this song could be great.  Instead, it dies faster than
    Pauly Shore's film career, smothered under the merciless pillow of bad mixing.</p><p>
    
    The real tragedy of this is that the band seems to have some really decent
    ideas hiding in these formless almost-songs.  The drummer could be pounding
    your ass into submission with his off-beat groove in ""Distance,"" but instead
    it sounds like he's down the hall practicing.  Broach's voice is similarly
    drowned in the mix, and it's a shame, because the guy can really sing.</p><p>
    
    Confession time: the Firebird Band have a full-length album out called <i>The
    Setting Sun and Its Satellites</i>, which I haven't heard.  I can only wonder
    if it sounds as positively bad as this EP does.  If I harp on how rotten the
    production is, it's because I have few qualms with the music, outside of the
    first track, which is just aimless.  ""The Runway"" is the best song here,
    possessing an actual form, a good melody, some ace drumming and lots of cool
    ambient flourishes in the background.  But, of course, the mix is all wrong.</p><p>
    
    So, to get an idea of what this sounds like, grab your nearest Braid CD and
    throw it in your player.  Next, press play and wrap your speakers in several
    blankets.  Then, shove the speakers in a drawer and close it.  Stand across
    the room and listen to the result.  Imagining it playing at half-speed with
    some electronics burbling around it.  You'll get a pretty good idea of just
    what you're dealing with here.</p><p>
<i>The Drive</i> winds down with the quasi-instrumental ""Wish,"" which is
    populated by manipulated vocals, fluttering synths and some programmed
    percussion.  It's tough to latch onto anything, though, because all of the
    elements are once again flung like chaff into a vacuum of production ideas,
    tightly played, but strangely disjointed from each other.  With some work,
    the Firebird Band could be making really great albums-- there's certainly no
    shortage of talent or ideas present in the band.  Unfortunately, this EP
    lacks the punch to box me into recommending them.</p><p>
    
    Do not forget this fact: passable music and poor production make for bad
    listening.</p></div>"|3063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3063-the-drive-ep/|4.8|Joe Tangari

Every artist who has     experimented with sound in the last thirty years-- from the Olivia Tremor     Control to Public Enemy-- owes the man a debt. He invented ambient music,     demonstrated how to fuse Western pop with non-Western textures, and     contributed key ideas to the discourse on sample-based music. Music     scribes have turned his last name into an adjective, for Lester's sake.</p>
<p>For all Eno has achieved on his own, much of his finest work-- especially     since the mid-70s-- has been in collaboration. It's never hard to hear Eno's     contributions when he works with others. It could even be said that his goal     as a producer and collaborator is to find the inner Eno that lies inside all     of us.</p>
<p>But being held in such high esteem means the bar is set high for what you     produce, and <i>Drawn from Life</i>, Eno's collaboration with German     composer/DJ J. Peter Schwalm, doesn't clear it.  I should qualify my     reservations; this is a nice record containing some interesting music, but     I expect more when I listen to something with Eno's name on the cover. Quite     a bit more.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with this record for me is how closely the songs stick to     the ambient downtempo template-- a template, it should be said, that Eno had     a large hand in writing.  <i>Drawn from Life</i> has the feel of a solid film     score, with a tone that wanders between eerie and placid.  Moody strings blend     nicely with Eno's synthesizer treatments, and there are a few contributions     from guests.  It's impeccably recorded-- pretty at some points and vaguely     somber at others-- but it never distinguishes itself.</p>
<p>The beats, in particular, just aren't compelling, in terms of rhythm or     texture. Schwalm is trained as a drummer, but you'd never know it from this     record. The familiar high-hats and rim taps on ""From This Moment"" and ""More     Dust"" seem like hastily constructed loops meant as mere timekeepers, even     though both include live drum work.  And when Laurie Anderson's vocodered     voice wanders into ""Like Pictures Part #2,"" <i>Drawn from Life</i> seems     painfully close to the hackneyed trip-hop territory that Bowery Electric is     mired in.</p>
<p>All is not lost, though. The highlight of <i>Drawn from Life</i> is definitely     the string arrangements, which have a subtle intricacy that is at times     staggering. On some tracks they work as just another element, adding slight     color and shading to the surrounding electronics, while on tracks like     ""Persis"" they're used for dramatic effect, with dark ostinatos meant to     quicken the pulse.</p>
<p>As a whole, <i>Drawn from Life</i> generally blends in well enough to work as     solid background music, which brings to mind Eno's thoughts on ambient and how     it can be enjoyed with little awareness.  The album doesn't seem designed for     that purpose, though, and more to the point, it fails the test of the second     part of Eno's famous phrase: even with close attention, the rewards are     relatively minor.</p></div>"|2794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2794-drawn-from-life/|5.4|Mark Richard-San

    the quality of the whole.  Usually, it's when the song is either so beamingly
    wonderful or so gut-wrenchingly terrible that I've already decided whether
    it's going to do time in my permanent collection, or be sent off to the hands
    of some poor, unwitting sap rummaging through the broken jewel cases of a
    bargain bin.</p><p>
    Receiving many, many discs for free, as I do, as a reviewer who receives
    free discs-- yes, that's the kind with music, which cost nothing, to me,
    receiving them free of cost as I often do-- the latter option is often
    fairly appealing, seeing as how these free discs can be cashed in for a
    profit.  But I try not to let this affect my overall judgment of the free
    albums I receive (by the truckload, of course, and daily). And even still,
    the opening tracks often drift by, in that neither overwhelmingly negative
    nor overwhelmingly positive way.</p><p>
    A gentle Casiotone drumbeat begins clunking out of the speakers, along with
    a simple, tinny, synthesized melody.  A quiet, lovely bass guitar harmonizes
    with the melody, and an endearingly mousy female voice-- an American voice--
    rhythmically sings the names of Japanese citizens Ami-chan and Mai-chan.
    Then, without warning, English lyrics: ""When you walk down the street, you
    tell everyone you meet/ 'Yes, I can speak a little English, ma'am.'/ When
    you pull up your chair, with your serious stare/ You say, 'There are four
    people in my family.'"" Then, some noisy, explosive, yet subdued samples along
    with some whispered chanting for a bit of a breakdown, and a reprise of the
    Casio melody and the main lyric.  Then, it's over.</p><p>
    The description is basically useless, though.  I'm hooked from hearing it,
    not reading about it.  And I'm about to suggest you follow my lead, after
    this informational section here. ""Ami-chan, Mai-chan"" is the opening track
    from the Sisterhood of Convoluted Thinkers' second LP, entitled <i>Ume Sour</i>.
    The record is dedicated, by the married duo of Robert Christiansen (an
    ex-member of Grenadine and recorder of the first two Labradford LPs) and
    Jeannine Durfee, ""in fond memory of our favorite nation and our favorite
    cocktail."" It was recorded while the couple lived in Tsuyama, Okayama, Japan
    for 2\xBD years, teaching English for a living; this explains the opener's
    subject matter. The album is titled after the aforementioned cocktail,
    ""which,"" as a handwritten note on the cover itself describes, ""is a sour
    plum drink"" with which Christiansen and Durfee fell in love during their
    residence in the country.</p><p>
<i>Ume Sour</i> is brimming with charm.  Christiansen and Durfee's adorable
    voices, combining as often as they go solo, sing tales of their everyday life
    in Japan. Accompanied by another simple synth beat, but this time with a
    plaintively gorgeous chord progression on guitar accompaniment, they sing
    ""Song for Tony and Ian"" for a couple of friends in America whom they miss.
    The touches upon their general feeling of nostalgia, and their musings on
    entering into an alien lifestyle. The pair then wryly follow up these
    sentiments with ""Tottori Made,"" a purely American-style country hoedown with
    down-home guitar licks, galloping horse-hoof rhythms, and lyrics in Japanese.</p><p>
    On the rest of <i>Ume Sour</i>, the Sisterhood take their gentle, electro-indie
    style and create quite a few unforgettable melodies along the way, not to
    mention seamless shifts in tone, harmony and production packed into each
    track. The verses of ""Lunchdate"" groove minimally alongside a funky programmed
    beat and guitar riff, before breaking into a joyous chorus of ""ba-da-da-bum's""
    and blissful baroque piano. ""The Rainbow"" starts with about 10 seconds of
    Christiansen singing to a folky guitar, and then literally fast-forwards
    through what seems like a whole song's worth of melody in another 20 seconds,
    giving way to a electronic groove, beautifully reverberating piano, and a
    poetic chorus summing up the husband and wife's union in a strange land:
    ""Stone after stone in the river we've thrown/ We're building an island/ And
    I want you to be here with me/ And I want you to see what I see.""</p><p>
<i>Ume Sour</i>'s finest moment comes two songs from the end of this short
    and sweet record. Christiansen opens ""Armstrong Archer"" with a powerful
    droning synth and spoken-word vocoder, almost appearing as an homage to
    Laurie Anderson's ""O Superman."" The track spans the next five minutes with
    piano and guitar, acoustic bass, paired vocals and slight electronic
    augmentations.  This, the record's most deceptively simple, brilliantly
    crafted melody, shifts and twists into its various sections so effortlessly
    it almost makes one feel weightless.  Near the end, as birds chirp and
    fingers delicately walk the ivories, Christiansen comes back with his
    vocoded voice of comfort: ""When you're tired and no one's there/ Just
    remember the path... to happiness."" The Sisterhood of Convoluted Thinkers
    have created a minimal, beautiful record that follows this path.  And I
    somehow knew it would, right from those opening moments.  I only wish I'd
    paid for it.</p></div>"|7190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7190-ume-sour/|8.3|Spencer Owen

For instance, the synthetic plaid pants that
    make your grandfather the butt of snide jokes at family reunions might
    actually look pretty smart hugging the hips of that cute sales clerk at the
    record store.  Why is that?  What makes something tacky in one context and
    clever in another?  What, to use more precise words, distinguishes kitsch
    from cheese?</p><p>
    Well, self-awareness, first and foremost.  Ugly, outmoded clothes somehow
    become fashionable if we know that whoever's wearing them is in on the joke.
    The best designers take retro concepts, strip them of their ugliness, and
    rehash them for the public in relevant, aesthetically enticing ways.  That's
    why brown is making a comeback, and why I'm offering to pay $20 for a
    Hypercolor t-shirt that still works (if you have one, my email address is on
    the staff page).  It also explains why groups like Les Rhythmes Digitales,
    the Avalanches and Daft Punk have fared so well in the eyes of critics and
    fans.  These groups exhume socially abandoned or rejected musical trends,
    reinterpret them with glib modern sensibilities, and hold them up, with a
    wink and a nod, for the rest of us to see.</p><p>
    But retro-fetishism has its limits.  Some trends aren't worth reviving;
    others have not yet passed far enough from memory to qualify as fair game.
    Fresh wounds are sensitive, and a fresh <i>faux pas</i> is strictly off limits.
    Brixton's Basement Jaxx, venerated purveyors of acid-tinged booty house beats,
    toe the line between kitsch and cheese, and all too often skirt across it.</p><p>
    As so many critics have hastened to note, Felix Burton and Simon Ratcliffe
    (the Jaxx by their proper names) are two of the weirdest, most innovative and
    talented house producers on the scene.  This much I'll concede-- their music
    is out-there, stylistically unparalleled by anything I've come across, and
    marked by immaculate production.  Unfortunately, it's often so tacky that
    it's impossible to stomach.  Their music is generally solid, but it's hard to
    tell if Basement Jaxx are taking the piss with their lyrics.  If so, they're
    joking about things I don't think we're ready to laugh at.  And if they're
    taking themselves seriously (I suspect they are), well, that's even worse.</p><p>
<i>Rooty</i>'s vocals bring back horrorshow memories of Technotronic,
    latter-day Prince and Lords of Acid-- memories that those of us who have
    listened to Lords of Acid and survived would rather forget.  The shrill,
    sex-crazed drivel distracts the listener's ear from the underlying
    instrumentation, which sometimes has a lot to offer.</p><p>
    The album's single, the creepily Janet-esque ""Romeo,"" commences the program
    on a bitter note.  Featured diva Kele Le Roc's mindless lyrics spill over the
    predictable, shallow melodies, bland beats and clichéd basslines.  ""Breakaway,""
    however, relieves the tedium with a foray into the darker facets of funk.
    Treacherous squelches murmur beneath industrial percussion and old-school
    synths, while quirky bleeps and bloops creep in wherever the music pauses.
    The song's unintelligent vocals are also unobtrusive enough that they don't
    ruin the rest of the song.</p><p>
    But only two other songs on this record really deserve ink.  The vocals
    recede to the background in ""Crazy Girl,"" a spaced-out electro joint whose
    chunky basslines, insistent chimes, skittering beats and washed-out guitar
    samples frolic over several layers of ambient noise.  This track is downright
    stunning, and only piques my frustration because it suggests that if Ratcliffe
    and Burton had canned the grating vocals, all of <i>Rooty</i> might have been
    this good.  In fact, the only track that ever benefits from the inclusion of
    singing is ""Broken Dreams,"" whose Hawaiian and spaghetti western themes hint
    at Luke Vibert's work with B.J. Cole.  Sha's refined, bubbly female vocals
    are more Stereolab than Salt'N'Pepa, and they nicely accentuate an otherwise
    pleasant song.</p><p>
    I have the same objections to this disc that I had to Kool Keith's <i>Sex
    Style</i>-- even though the rhymes were tight, and the production spoke for
    itself, the tastelessness of Keith's lyrics seemed to overshadow the record's
    finer points.  By the same token, a few fatal flaws eclipse all of <i>Rooty</i>'s
    abundant qualities.  Basement Jaxx have taken kitsch a few steps too far.
    They may be in on the joke, but this shit is no laughing matter.</p></div>"|571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/571-rooty/|3.8|Malcolm Seymour III

    I thirst for more than this from Coldcut. Since Jonathan More and Matt Black
    realigned my listening sensors with 1997's <em>Let Us Play</em>, I've followed
    their trail through the countless comps and EPs, sniffing for their delicious
    blend of wildly creative sampling and addictive beats. Sometimes, I discover
    pure bliss in a beatific clamorous frenzy; other times, it's warmed-over remix
    material.  Today, they bring you latter variety.</p><p>
    Coldcut's latest release, the <i>Re:volution</i> EP, is an odd soundtrack to
    More &amp; Black's own political party-- the Guilty Party, they call themselves--
    which had the crazy nerve to run against current premiärminister Tony Blair
    and his primary opponent, dagen då den färglöse William Haugue, in the June
    of 2001 British elections.  Needless to say, they experienced none of the
    third-party (or, in this case, like, twelfth party) success Jesse Ventura
    pulled through with in the 1998 Minnesota primaries.  It's a shame, though,
    because their platform is one that most could get hip to: turntables would
    conform to a British standard, higher education would be sought by all, and
    lower taxes would be implemented for vinyl.</p><p>
    To be fair, <i>Re:volution</i> is all of three tracks.  It totals 11 minutes
    in length, four of which are taken up by Nautilus' ""Space Journey,"" a mellow
    remix of Coldcut stuff over a backdrop of classic space techno tones.  Created
    using Coldcut's infamous VJamm mixing software, the single won an Intermusic
    contest last year.  But, while decent enough, the track is eminently
    disposable.</p><p>
    Another eight minutes of <i>Re:volution</i> are spent on the instrumental
    version of the EP's title track.  Thus, judgment rests on the four minutes
    of the title track itself.  What I hear so strongly recalls Coldcut's
    previous work that it's like a repressing of some distant track from their
    bulky back catalog I listened to once and forgot about.  What's worse, the
    track lacks the unfettered creativity and sheer ""bollocks"" (as those English
    boys might say) that sets much of their catalog upon a pedestal all its own.
    ""Re:volution"" attempts to pound home the point that the ""lunatics are taking
    over the asylum,"" amidst swelling guitar loops and a flurry of Blair and
    Haugue soundbytes that lack enough order to be meaningful.</p><p>
    End product: a forgettable single worth forgetting about before you even buy
    it.  I thirst for more than this from Coldcut.</p></div>"|1533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1533-revolution-ep/|3.7|James P. Wisdom

    could be ignored right now.  A simple hand-scrawl of airplanes at odd angles,
    while easily dismissed only a week and a half ago, has taken on new
    significance.  Just to clarify: the Trans Megetti aren't insensitive fucks.
    Their cover art is a few months old, but their rage and devastation sound
    almost as fresh as our own.</p><p>
    
    Hailing from the fabulous New Jersey coast, the Trans Megetti put out an album
    whose name now has similarly awful connotations (1998's <i>Steal the Jet
    Keys</i>) before releasing <i>Fading Left to Completely On</i>.  As
    refreshingly abstract and association-free as the name is, the music
    constantly tears open old scars, emotional and musical.  With the spacy rip
    of echoed pick scrapes streaking over a furious punk rock backdrop, the first
    track, ""Rio Nexpa,"" sounds a bit like At the Drive-In circa two years ago.</p><p>
    
    Stick around for a few moments, however, and the differences begin to show;
    Mark Tesi can actually sing, for one thing, and he hits just the right balance
    of wry desperation, anger, and melody on the chorus (""I can't wait to be over
    you"").  ""Trick the Switches"" takes things in a slightly more straightforward
    though still complex direction, relative newcomer Mark Candidi's nimble bass
    holding the whole thing together.  And, with the same biting agility, ""Soon
    Be Seeing You Later"" fuses classic rock start/stops straight out of ""Magic
    Bus"" with new-school drive and Tesi's forcefully plaintive descending vocals.</p><p>
    
    Without providing anything revolutionary, the Trans Megetti give enough of
    themselves to make this sound distinct and worthwhile.  The album's high
    point, the near-poppy ""Gina,"" dares to drop the tempo a bit and lets Julian
    Grere's alternately stabbing and bitterly legato guitar play around with
    Candidi's loping bassline.  Tesi delivers an acid dissertation on a summer
    love gone wrong, interlaced with dark imagery (""Both tired of living/ Black
    dashes on my wrists""), pleading vocal cracks on the chorus, and an ominously
    chanted final line, ""I'll wait for you always.""</p><p>
    
    After that, the quality drops a bit, but there's still quite a bit of good
    left.  ""Haircut"" moves between chilly riffs and drummer Brian Strahle's
    stomped-out rhythms and hypnotizing guitar hiss, throwing itself into each
    but never getting caught up in either.  Tesi's vocal urgency propels ""On the
    Monday"" with a seething minor-chord intensity, and the song's final
    tension-releasing instrumental breakdown disperses this energy into the
    windswept limbo-fragment ""Late September.""</p><p>
    
    ""Turned On"" comes off just a
    little too bitter, burning through a maze of jumpy guitars and scathingly
    blunt lyrics (""You don't look so slick/ When you're sucking dick"") with only
    a few sections of melodic saving grace.  ""Hop the Fence"" does a little better
    with the same basic premise, adding a despairingly melodic chorus and
    stripping the song down from there.  The final track, an acoustic number
    called ""Following,"" shouldn't work by any means in the context of the rest
    of the album.  However, Tesi's expressive voice (and the cool effect of the
    background guitar strums and percussion) make it a decent, unpredictably
    offbeat end to the record.</p><p>
    
    But then again, sometimes there's no avoiding the cover.  What's the point,
    really, in listening to some kids' comparatively puny sorrows and frustrations
    at this point in time?  You could ask the same question of all sorts of ""art""
    that aim to represent loss and suffering.  All I can think of is this: the
    Trans Megetti don't really try to make anything beautiful.  They make it rock,
    which is a different, half-unknown quality, and that's good enough for me.</p></div>"|8140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8140-fading-left-to-completely-on/|7.7|Brendan Reid

    confronted with the cleaning power of Dawn.  We didn't start out that way;
    we all, at one time or another (and for a brief moment, all at the <i>same</i>
    time), lived in Southwestern Pennsylvania.  These days, however, the entire
    Dark brood are perimeter-dwellers: Boston, Florida, Houston, California.
    Overextended and mutually distant, we can barely coordinate a family
    get-together that doesn't involve a funeral, let alone produce a work of
    artistic merit like the Moth Wranglers' debut album, <i>Never Mind the
    Context</i>.</p><p>
    
    But that's exactly how this bi-coastal collaborative project operates.  The
    primary Wranglers, King Missile alum Chris Xefos and Flare's LD Beghtol, are
    graced by a mutual admiration society comprised of Camper Van Beethoven's
    Victor Krummenacher and Jonathan Segel, the Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt
    and Claudia Gonson, the Loud Family's Alison Faith Levy, the Posies' Ken
    Stringfellow, and the Geraldine Fibbers' Bill Tutton, among many, many
    others.  A grand total of 29 contributors in all-- credited in egalitarian
    fashion with no mention of who played what-- even outnumbers my entire
    aforementioned extended family.</p><p>
    
    A thousand attics and flea markets must have been raided to yield the album's
    menagerie of castaway ukuleles, autoharps, Marxophones, Aqualins and peck
    horns.  But the songs are more traditional than their bizarro instrumentation
    would suggest, and all the musical toys are put to good use.  Instantly,
    you're clued in that this won't be a normal listening experience.  ""I Will
    Never Marry,"" a trad-Appalachian gospel-death ballad, sung a cappella, opens
    the album with a suitably ambivalent tone.  The oddity of hearing Xefos and
    Beghtol deliver the line, ""I'll be no man's wife,"" in beautiful harmony is
    eerie and comical at the same time.  From then on, they swap at lead vocals,
    with Beghtol's polished obsidian vox taking the lion's share.</p><p>
    
    ""Turnabout"" is a screechy, Grange Hall dancin' ditty that recalls Camper
    Van Beethoven, and not only because it showcases the unmistakable and
    masterful fiddling of Jonathan Segel.  The croony vocals telling the tale of
    British serial killer Denis Nilson in eyebrow-raising narrative also have
    that same California-freaky worldview:  ""It's just a phase, perhaps a ruse/
    It's nothing bad, he's just confused/ It's just a shame, it's just the truth/
    No, nothing serious, call it youth.""  Did I mention the hand-claps?</p><p>
    
    ""Let Go, Let Me"" pits guest tormented-soul Stephin Merritt's deepest, most
    sonorous vocals yet against Tutton's contrabass (contrabass wins, but just
    barely).  Beatlesque ""ooh-la-la-la's"" fill in the background along with
    soft bongos and a quivering vintage keyboard chord.  The song positively
    slinks.  Elsewhere, Belle and Sebastian are given a stylistic nod with the
    post-twee ballad, ""Yet Again.""  Sing-songy strums, autoharp and a
    muddy-in-the-mix mandolin solo commingle behind a lilt that would make
    Morrissey's knees buckle.</p><p>
    
    The album's not without its tedious moments, though.  The moribund ""Six-Page
    Letter"" moves as if in slow motion.  It reminded me of Nicole Kidman's
    excruciatingly drawn out speech patterns in <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>.  The song's
    lethargic melodies, bombarded with echoing distorted guitar effects, don't
    really go anywhere.  And ""Record (She's Saving a Page)"" sounds like a bad
    marriage of third-rate prog and the Church.  Such marriages inevitably end
    in divorce.</p><p>
    
    But all told, the Moth Wranglers' idea of deconstructionist wackiness, folkie
    instrumentation and a sense of humor matched only by their sense of melody
    hits like a breath of fresh air in a dog kennel.   From the overwrought Pink
    Floydian bombast of ""Don't Look Now"" to the European drinking hall singalong,
    ""Figure-Ground,"" the Moth Wranglers are all over the musical map.  The result
    is cohesion sacrificed in the name of playful and insolent experimentation.
    And against odds, Xefos and Beghtol pull it off more often than not.  The
    world needs more ideas like the Moth Wranglers: people who hold a wake instead
    of a funeral, who take drugs because the world doesn't seem normal without
    them, and who scribble moustaches on Mona Lisas.</p></div>"|5444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5444-never-mind-the-context/|7.3|John Dark

    but a popular kid in bulky glasses and bad clothing. If I had a single rice
    krispy for every time I've seen a plot on television or in a movie involving
    a not-so-subtle transformation from pathetic nerd to popular hottie, I'd be
    in a state of perpetual breakfast.</p><p>
    
    While these transformations can oftentimes be dramatic, they're never
    surprising.  All the paste-on zits and pocket protectors in the universe
    usually can't hide the fact that the ""geek"" you're looking at is an attractive
    actor or actress trying his best to play up loserdom with a weak-ass Anthony
    Michael Hall impression.</p><p>
    
    John Linnell and John Flansburgh, on the other hand, are true geeks. Serious
    geeks. The kind of geeks who probably used to spend their Saturday afternoons
    trying to get their Apple IIc's to calculate pi.  But these aren't your
    average geeks-- these geeks managed to craft two undeniably brilliant albums
    with backup provided only by primitive Macintosh MIDI in lieu of traditional
    instrumentation.</p><p>
<i>They Might Be Giants</i> and <i>Lincoln</i> certainly sounded like nothing
    else before or since. It was clear that their progenitors were wise-ass geeks--
    but it was just as clear that they were <i>pop-sensible</i> wise-ass geeks.
    Hooks were always present, even as the duo of Johns began to ditch the MIDI
    for the more analog sound of an actual band. Even with 1996's admittedly
    spotty <i>Factory Showroom</i>, the boys managed to make their music
    concurrently smart, goofy, geeky, and insanely catchy, in spite of a guest
    appearance by Neutral Milk Hotel's Julian Koster.  Don't think you can hide
    from me, Julian.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, a lot has changed in five years. The humble geeks, who at the time
    of their last album enjoyed a substantial cult following of middle-aged
    computer programmers and younger ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" fanatics, have started
    receiving recognition on a scale never before imagined, penning music for
    ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and <i>Austin Powers 2</i>. These nerds have gone
    popular. And as a result, their once-intelligent style has given way to dumb,
    silly pandering. Perhaps harder to explain, the pop hooks have given way to
    unwieldy disasters.</p><p>
    
    Yes, <i>Mink Car</i> is crap. All the charms They Might Be Giants once seemed
    to possess have dissipated into a cloud of embarrassing awkwardness. Some of
    the songs on <i>Mink Car</i> are just so hideously atrocious that one can't
    help but wonder how the same duo whose last album was host to catchy,
    memorable songs like ""Until My Head Falls Off"" could release an album that
    not only leaves you with nothing to remember, but makes you eager to forget.</p><p>
    
    The worst offenders on <i>Mink Car</i> are the one-off (or, in some cases,
    two-off) genre pieces, which come off about as authentic as spam, and not
    nearly as amusing. ""Mr. Xcitement,"" a disgusting mess of computer preset
    breakbeats, far-too-goofy lyrics, and former Soul Coughing frontman Doughty,
    possesses absolutely none of the wit and nerdy charm we've come to expect
    from They Might Be Giants. It's tempting to accuse ""Mr. Xcitement"" of being
    a disjointed train wreck of a song, but one gets the sense that if it were
    more cohesive, it might be even worse. ""Wicked Little Critta"" treads
    dangerously close to Presidents of the United States of America territory,
    substituting brain-twisting pain for oddball fun.</p><p>
    
    Failed experiments are not all that new to They Might Be Giants, but the thing
    that makes <i>Mink Car</i> beyond dismal is the fact that all the potential
    for goodness on the album seems to have been squandered. ""Bangs"" is possibly
    the album's best track, simply because it actually sounds like They Might Be
    Giants. It's got a bouncy, sufficiently twisty melody that lends itself
    perfectly to Linnell's trademark nasal whine. But the song is never really
    allowed to come into its own.  Instead, it's transposed way too early, and
    at a seriously inopportune moment, haphazardly breaking up the flow of a song
    that otherwise excels in the melody department. ""Hovering Sombrero"" is more
    consistent but less catchy, fading far too easily into the background. It's
    a sad thing when you find yourself waiting for a band to pull off a
    second-rate imitation of their older material, but it's almost unavoidable
    with an album as disjointed and generally bad as <i>Mink Car</i>.</p><p>
    
    As if general mediocrity weren't enough, the two Johns had to go back and
    screw up some songs that have existed in vastly superior forms for years.
    ""Another First Kiss"" and ""Man, It's So Loud in Here"" both sounded great as
    live staples.  But the former has been transformed from a driving rock song
    (as heard on the band's 1998 live album, <i>Severe Tire Damage</i>) to a
    limp, trite acoustic number with a played-out drumbeat that can only leave
    one thinking ""Lyte Funky Giants."" ""Man, It's So Loud in Here"" has been
    desecrated with cheesy dance drum machine beats and synth bass. The chorus
    still packs a bit of punch, but the song itself sounds more like ABBA than
    fellow geek-rockers Devo.</p><p>
    
    In the aforementioned movies and TV shows, the made-over geeks always settle
    perfectly into their newfound social standing. After all, they were really
    just poorly dressed, acne-ridden popular kids all along. But it's clear that
    this is not the case with They Might Be Giants. You can dress an A/V club
    member in Abercrombie and put him on the football team, but at the end of
    the day, he'll be badly bruised and weeping longingly for his history
    textbook and vintage Amiga.  The volatile tides of popularity won't be kind
    to They Might Be Giants for long.  Let's just hope they figure that out
    before they give up on whatever bits and pieces of their musical identity
    they still have left.</p></div>"|7996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7996-mink-car/|2.8|Matt LeMay

    Matador's archivist approach to electronica. Matador's previously released
    Burger works such as the Modernist, and his collaboration with Wolfgang Voigt
    (aka Gas, aka Mike Ink), Burger/Ink.  The label is clearly convinced that
    everything this guy creates is worthy of preservation.  This is a false
    assumption.</p><p>
    It's true that, since his conversion to all things ecstatically bangin',
    Burger has released some real treats. The Modernist's <i>Explosion</i> and
    Burger/Ink's <i>Las Vegas</i> are both rich in fuzzy Cologne machine-funk
    and Nicolas Grimshaw-ish reflective surfaces.  However, this latest
    compilation, which draws on Burger's solo work from 1993-1997, will
    disappoint all of us converted by the previous albums.  Drawing from the
    shallow well of downtempo techno mood music, none of <i>Lubricate Your
    Living-Room</i>'s eighteen tracks dare to grab you, or even pluck up enough
    courage to ask if you wouldn't mind paying attention for just a brief moment.</p><p>
    The collection begins in an ironically porno fashion with ""Electric Campfire
    (In a Neo-Ackerman Style),"" on which a lazily strummed guitar nuzzles up to
    languidly bobbing synth-wobbles. After we've become thoroughly attuned to the
    slack groove, a breathy lady recites the title before some snaggle-toothed,
    unkempt fellow starts reading from a hardcore grot novel. The guy reads the
    excerpt in such a unengaged manner that I wonder if Burger's intent is less
    to titillate (as fellow Cologner Khan would desire) than to express his
    opinion on the banality of porn. If this is Burger's intent, his unremarkable
    accompaniment to the reading complements perfectly.</p><p>
    ""Theme,"" originally released on the Bionaut's 1996 LP, <i>Please Teenage!</i>,
    is a pretty, bass-burden lope through machine-tooled sterility.  ""Lush Life
    Electronica,"" culled from the 1995 album of the same name, maintains a
    reasonably pleasant, downy-soft vibe and brings back the hazy acoustic guitar
    of ""Electric Campfire.""  ""The Juicy Reminder,"" from the same album, benefits
    from a propulsive low-end pulse that forces an urgency on the track that the
    huge synth washes and delicately echoed electro-spangles lack.</p><p>
    Also excerpted from the <i>Lush Life Electronica</i> album, ""Student Bashing
    at the Seaside"" depicts the beauty of the coastline, where the violence of
    doffing up college kids takes place rather than the actual busting of ribs
    and bruising of limbs.  Here's another example of Burger either being a stern
    commentator on violence (or just being a wildly inappropriate titler of
    tracks).  However, with ""Memphis Sci-Fi,"" Burger's got it just right. Amid
    the Tennessee twangs, he scatters \xB5-ziq bursts of percussive white noise and
    lets the two opposites rub against each other for three minutes. </p><p>
    From the 1993 album <i>Music for Stock Exchange</i> (recorded under the guise
    of Ethik-- essentially a split CD with solo material by both Burger and
    Wolfgang Voigt) comes the pad-saturated ""Bluebelle (The Birth of a Bionaut),""
    which bobs along with percussive tinkles and a softly looping Detroit-style
    bassline.  ""P. Bateman,"" also drawn from the Ethik sessions, serves as an
    homage to no one's favorite anti-hero, <i>American Psycho</i>'s Patrick
    Bateman.  The track sounds like Yellow Magic Orchestra outfitted with
    up-to-date studio gear, but once again relies on sheer banality (perhaps) to
    convey Burger's low opinion of Bateman's infamous serial murdering.</p><p>
    Burger has a much higher opinion of a character he calls ""Wild Horse Annie.""
    He devoted an EP to telling her tale, and <i>Lubricate Your Living-Room</i>
    contains two of its cuts. On ""Der Kurze Weg,"" Burger incorporates
    unpredictable chord changes, coming off like an impossible blissful Richard
    D. James.  And ""Wild Horse Annie as Herself"" glistens in its sterility, an
    aloof spaghetti-western guitar piece prepared for an exhibition of Mies van
    der Rohe furniture.</p><p>
    The irresolvable problem with <i>Lubricate Your Living-Room</i> is that the
    anthology fails to introduce anything new. Why does Matador think that a
    compilation of material at least four years (and several genre-shifts) old
    was worth releasing? The true Bionaut fans would have bought the source EPs
    and albums years ago, and those hooked by the previous Matador releases of
    Jörg Burger's work will be unavoidably disappointed. I suppose lounge DJs
    might find something breezy enough to slip in between Nicola Conte and Dining
    Rooms tracks. The rest of us don't have to look far to find much more
    invigorating living-room lubricants: DNTEL's <i>Life is Full of Possibilities</i>
    and the Other Peoples Place's <i>Lifestyles of Laptop Café</i> leap instantly
    to mind as superlative examples. When Burger does come up with some spanking
    new tracks, I trust Matador won't wait five years or so to release them.</p></div>"|707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/707-lubricate-your-living-room/|5.2|Paul Cooper

In fact, during the past six days, I     haven't listened to any music at all.  I tried listening for escape; I tried     listening for ""understanding""; I tried listening just     to listen.  But nothing worked.  My ears were for news and that was that.</p>
<p>I was glad, then, to see this record by Schlammpeitziger in my mailbox.  Not     only is this compilation culled in part from three albums I already own (hence,     I already know the music intimately), but the tenor of the music itself made     listening bearable. This is simple, pretty, unassuming music existing for no     other reason than to bring a little beauty into the world. And right now, it's     hard to imagine anything else sounding better.</p>
<p>A little background about Schlammpeitziger. The     name is a pun on a German word for a species of fish that lives on     the ocean floor-- loosely translated, it means ""mudwhipper.""  Cologne     keyboardist Jo Zimmerman uses this breezy handle for his solo music projects.     He's worked with others in the Sonig camp, including F.X. Randomiz (the two     make lovely music together as Holosud), and his first LP was remastered by     Jan and Andi from Mouse on Mars.</p>
<p>Musically, Zimmerman is an Elder in the 5% Nation of Casiotone, composing     most of his music using the pre-set tones of cheap, off-the-rack keyboards.     He sticks fairly close to a pop structure, with warm, charming chords playing     memorable changes. My first impression was that Zimmerman built his career     around the best moments from side two of Kraftwerk's <i>Autobahn</i>,     certainly a noble calling. Hearing these songs again for the first time in a     while, though, I was struck by how much they reminded me of Plone.  They're     lovely music-box melodies with just the right hint of mystery, only unlike     the bulk of Plone's songs, these are timeless.</p>
<p>From the albums I have, I can say that Zimmerman chose the tracks for this     compilation very wisely. All my favorites are here. ""Elektronischer Country,""     from the vinyl-only <i>Erdrauchharnschleck</i>, was the first Schlammpeitziger     tune I fell in love with. It's a sad ballroom dance for a roomful of junked     robots, with a slide guitar telling the leads when to dip. ""Honkytonk     Schlickummpittz"" is lighter than Air (French Band), with an inspiring march     of melody and gentle, encouraging electronic handclaps. ""Hallimaschbomba im     Kreisverkehr"" paints with the 8-bit Super Mario Brothers palette, but does     so with subtle, spacious strokes, avoiding the grating frenzy of most music     inspired by the archaic entertainment system.  ""Hydraulicmeisters Halbtagstanz""     sounds like theme music from a late 70s documentary on the jogging craze,     poignant and lovely. None of these 13 tracks is less than good.</p>
<p>The perfect visual representation of Schlammpeitziger's music is on     <i>Augenwischwaldmoppgefloete</i>, which also happens to be my favorite album     cover. Check it out sometime. It's a photograph of folks dressed in some     kind of Western European Alpine garb, dancing in a circle with locked hands.     The women are anchored to the ground while the men float in mid-leap, writhing     like they were each shot out of a cannon. It's one of the purest expressions     of joy I can imagine.  And like this collection, it seems like a good place     to start from when you decide to crawl out of the dark.</p></div>"|7023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7023-collected-simplesongs-of-my-temporary-past/|8.6|Mark Richardson

Probably
    because they were a recording duo that gave themselves the suburbanite
    surname the Spinanes, and the photos on the sleeves of their debut album,
    <i>Manos</i>, were all matrimonial.  (The photos were actually from Gates'
    parent's wedding.)  But despite the fact that Gates and Plouf rocked perfectly
    in sync, as though they could read each other's minds, they weren't a couple--
    just a sparse, driving rock band with a White Stripes-style set up of drums
    and guitar.</p><p>
    
    After the Spinanes released their second album, 1996's bittersweet <i>Strand</i>,
    Scott Plouf split to play drums for Built to Spill.  The Spinanes didn't quite
    ""break up,"" though-- Gates brought her guitar to Chicago and recorded <i>Arches
    and Aisles</i> with a guest roster of the Windy City's post-rock icons,
    proving in the process that she could handle songwriting on her own.</p><p>
    
    Three years after the release of <i>Arches and Aisles</i>, Gates' <i>Ruby
    Series</i> EP comes like a postcard from a friend you've been out of touch
    with.  ""The Seldom Scene"" arrives on your doorstep with warm guitar chords
    and Rebecca's breathy delivery.  You can tell that her recent stint performing
    jazz standards has improved her control; her voice hovers carefully on
    separate syllables as she soothes: ""You say you feel so soulless, and never
    right/ Maybe you could stay here, where the light is safe.""  The sparse
    arrangement seems like a folk ballad until the instruments converge suddenly
    in jazzy accord.  Thankfully, though, there are few post-rock signifiers
    here-- just producer John McEntire's vibraphone lead.</p><p>
    
    ""Lure and Cast"" follows with a different kind of bait for Gates altogether.
    The programmed bass pattern and her shimmering guitar almost recall Massive
    Attack's ""Protection.""  Gates' fans might worry about a transition to a sort
    of Sheryl-Crowe-esque ""adult rock"" with all the smooth sounds here, but her
    subtle guitar accents make it clear that she's comfortable not having to play
    so hard to flesh out the sound.  Plus, the skittering drums keep the song
    sounding fresh, further exploring the lush developments of <i>Arches and
    Aisles</i>, even if it is a bit of a stretch trying to rhyme ""so radiant""
    with ""so, so salient.""</p><p>
    
    The big shocker comes with ""In a Star Orbit,"" which starts with bass beats
    and chimes that might have shaken ass on an early-90's Saint Etienne album.
    Gates' voice runs through a processor, adding a hazy sheen to her lazy
    Prekop-ian pop vocals.  The song shifts nicely after about a minute and a
    half, from a synth bassline to a more live continuum, but McEntire's
    too-strong influence adds an unnecessary air of Sea-and-Cake tropicalia.
    The tune is forgettable but it's book-ended by two of the best songs on the
    album.  ""Move"" features Gates' slow acoustic strumming and melancholy
    musings: ""A listless life filled with death-wish panderings and diets.""
    Static electronics whisper faintly, and Chicago Underground Trio's Noel
    Kupersmith draws a hint of tension from the increasing speed of his bassline.
    ""Doos"" is an odd pastiche of styles, but it works: Red Red Meat's Brian Deck
    loops tinny beats, while Gates adds O'Rourkian squiggling and layers her
    voice for a sensual summer daydream: ""Caught in the breath of the thought of
    the warmth of lips tingling.""</p><p>
<i>Ruby Series</i> has a strange power to recontextualize the retro sounds
    listed above.  To Gates' credit, the overproduced electronics mix well with
    the glockenspiels, marimbas and Wurlitzer organs, in the end sounding more
    like her songwriting and less like a McEntire remix.  But some might wonder
    why her experiments with texture are necessary at all-- especially when the
    closer, ""I Received a Levitation,"" harkens so pleasingly back to <i>Strand</i>
    days, with acoustic fret-squeals, restless percussion from Kupersmith and
    Gates' triple-tracked confessionals.   The picture focuses when you consider
    the periodic emphasis in the EP's title, and the photos taken by Gates in the
    sleeve of beachfront resorts and lounging sunbathers.  These songs are each
    snapshots, a sort of emotional travelogue for us to take a voyeuristic listen
    to.  If you can get past the fact that Gates isn't rocking out anymore, this
    is just the thing for a languid weekend afternoon.</p></div>"|3405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3405-ruby-series-ep/|7.3|Christopher Dare

We lived about 30 minutes outside of fabulous
    downtown Hartford, Connecticut, in a little burg crisscrossed by the
    interstate and assailed by fast food restaurants dying to get a piece of
    property in our little town.  I lived in the part of town where all the
    farms were slowly being conquered by developments, a pretty lengthy bike
    ride from anything of interest.</p><p>
    
    Overall, growing up there wasn't bad.  We were comfortable, the schools were
    decent, if underfunded, and crime was nearly nonexistent.  Of course, growing
    up in this environment also meant long sessions spent in the blistering hell
    of boredom.  This forced us to devise our own methods of entertainment, which
    by high school, often involved what Ben Folds calls ""rockin' the suburbs.""</p><p>
    
    My town was full of kids who had quite a bit of money, but didn't have a clue
    what to do with it (IRA?  What's that?).  This led to a war of car stereos,
    many of which were suped up to epic proportions for maximum suburb-rocking
    capabilities.  I'll never forget playing a Beethoven CD on my friend Dan's
    30-megaton sub-woofers-- it didn't exactly rock, but it sure sounded messed
    up.  More often, it was the strains of Pearl Jam or Sir Mix-a-Lot wafting
    across parking lots and shaking the paint off of nearby houses.</p><p>
    
    I can imagine Ben Folds approving of our stereo wars.  After all, he knows as
    well as any of us just how much boredom the suburbs can generate on a given
    day, and he seems to know his place as a suburban musical phenomenon.  He
    even hired Ben Grosse of Filter and Fuel fame to produce his first solo
    album.  ""I got the quintessential suburb-rocking producer to work for me.
    He knows all the sliders and knobs that denote the rocking of suburbs,"" says
    Folds of his choice.</p><p>
    
    Largely, his choice seems to have paid off, as his new album is a pretty
    enjoyable romp that will almost certainly be rocking the suburbs for at least
    a few months.  <i>Rockin' the Suburbs</i> finds Folds largely backing off
    from the dramatic chamber-pop that characterized his last outing with Ben
    Folds Five, instead bringing in former Beck cohort DJ Swamp to provide beats
    for a few tracks, and playing most of the instruments himself (he's actually
    not a bad drummer or bassist).  John Mark Painter's string arrangements can
    still be found on a few songs here, including a couple of the best ones, but
    they're decidedly downplayed.</p><p>
    
    ""Annie Waits"" opens the album on an upbeat note, with a Swamp-provided beat
    and rolling Steinway.  Folds intones in his trademark ""I'm not a singer, but
    I'm singing anyway"" voice, inaugurating the first tale of suburban alienation,
    loneliness, and, of course, boredom.  If there's one thing Folds has developed
    over the years, it's an extremely distinctive melodic sense, and there's not
    a song here that fails to hook you at least somewhere.</p><p>
    
    The highlight of the album comes at about the midpoint, with the quietly
    waltzing ""Fred Jones Part 2,"" a remarkably mature portrait of a man who
    loses his job at a newspaper to a young go-getter after years of faithful
    service.  It's one of his finest ballads and it demonstrates admirably the
    effect that simple words can have.  One of the things I've always liked about
    Folds' more serious songs was that he rarely reaches for poetry, opting
    usually to just lay his thoughts out for you in plain sight.</p><p>
    
    This approach serves him well on songs like ""The Ascent of Stan,"" about an
    aging hippy who became The Man he once spoke out against.  Then there's ""Not
    the Same,"" a bizarre tale of a stoner who becomes born again after a drug
    experience.  It helps, naturally, that both of these songs possess great
    melodies and interesting music to back them up.  But elsewhere, the music is
    merely serviceable, and the stories are predictable, such as on ""Zak and
    Sara,"" which tells the vague tale of a bored girlfriend sitting around while
    her boyfriend buys a guitar.</p><p>
    
    And then, of course, there's the single and title track, ""Rockin' the
    Suburbs,"" which attempts to do to the modern rock mainstream what
    ""Underground"" did to the indie rock scene all those years ago.  About half
    of it succeeds, with hilarious exchanges like, ""I got shit running through my
    brain/ So intense that I can't explain/ All alone in my white boy pain/ Shake
    your booty while the band complains,"" squaring off against weak lines about
    driving to the store for some Preparation H.</p><p>
    
    Folds obviously sees right through the false rage of bands like Limp Bizkit
    and Papa Roach, but he ends up leveling his guns on himself with lines like,
    ""You better watch out because I'm gonna say fuck.""  Does anyone remember
    ""Army?""  Or how about the song that immediately follows, ""Fired?""  It ends
    with a big, harmonized choir of Ben Foldses shouting ""Motherfucker!""  It's
    hard to understand why Folds still feels like he has to include this kind of
    thing on his albums, when most of his songwriting points to the fact that he
    could easily move beyond it.  At any rate, the irony is thicker than
    cheesecake.</p><p>
<i>Rockin' the Suburbs</i> ends with ""The Luckiest,"" a sappy ballad about
    watching the birth of his child, but after the debacle of the two previous
    songs, I don't so much mind.  At least Folds is being honest when he sings
    about loving his wife and child.  I'm just waiting for the day when Folds
    finally stops trying to be a novelty.</p><p>
    
    When and if that day comes, he may yet make an album that lives up to the
    promise of the Five's debut, while demonstrating the maturity he's acquired
    over the years to full effect.  For now, you've got <i>Rockin' the Suburbs</i>,
    a worthy, but occasionally frustrating album that's fairly good for what its
    title suggests.  Hell, it's probably being wielded in some stereo war back
    home right now.  For that, at least, it beats the shit out of Beethoven.</p></div>"|3135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3135-rockin-the-suburbs/|6.3|Joe Tangari

    increased global communication is that the individual, unique musics of all
    the world's various corners have become available for anyone to listen to.
    There are so many different folk styles out there that it would be hard to
    hear a glimpse of them all, but basically everything is on record somewhere,
    from Indonesian gamelan orchestras to Hungarian wedding dances and Delta
    blues.</p><p>
    
    The end result of all this mixing and cultural exchange is recombination, a
    trend led largely by the pop world, whether it's George Harrison arranging
    rock songs for the sitar or the Squirrel Nut Zippers mixing up a tossed salad
    of klezmer and 20's hot jazz.  Of course, it's hard for artists in these early
    stages of grafting styles to avoid boring genre exercises and clumsy failed
    experiments, but often you'll end wind up with fairly transcendent results;
    witness the Police's fusion of reggae and new wave.</p><p>
    
    Idyll Swords are just the latest in a long line of bands who set out to bring
    disparate styles together, and you have to admire them for their sheer
    ambition.  Unfortunately, on this, their second album, their reach sometimes
    exceeds their grasp as they simply try to bring too many sounds under the
    same roof without first trying to figure out a way to combine them.  At
    times, the North Carolina trio's sophomore effort feels like a demonstration
    tape of various folk styles from around the world, with genre exercises from
    Central Asia sitting rather uncomfortably next to a study on something from
    Eastern Europe.</p><p>
    
    That's not to say there aren't some truly outstanding moments here.  The
    three musicians, Chuck Johnson, Grant Tennille, and ex-Polvo guitarist Dave
    Brylawski, are all guitarists at heart, but on <i>II</i>, they tackle a wide
    variety of stringed instruments from around the world with admirable facility.
    They open the record on a deceptively dark note, with the ominous riff that
    announces ""Tantz,"" but quickly allow it to subside in favor of field
    recordings and a triple acoustic guitar piece.  The guitar piece flows
    through multiple movements, some full of frenzied rhythms and interlocking
    ostinatos, others brimming with melodic grace.</p><p>
    
    ""Lake Palace"" follows, offering one of the album's only two vocal selections.
    It's quite pleasant, calling upon Appalachian folk for inspiration before
    landing in slower territory akin to the British folk of the late 60's, as
    practiced by Steeleye Span.  It also lasts well over eight minutes, sadly
    overstaying its welcome by a few minutes.  ""Eschuteon Ascent/Biza's Theme""
    makes a natural union of guitars and Eastern strings before descending into
    a soup of field recordings and audio editing that would fit nicely onto an
    Olivia Tremor Control album.</p><p>
    
    It's this first half of <i>II</i> that generally feels the most cohesive,
    largely employing one of two strategies:  one draws on the folk of the US
    and UK while subtly incorporating oud and cumbus into these otherwise
    straightforward compositions, while the other offers complex guitar pieces
    filled with modal scales drawn mostly from traditional Middle Eastern or
    Eastern European music.  The band have opted to make the second half of the
    album the more varied one, with mostly uneven results.  The rub is, many of
    the short pieces offer potential, but go nowhere.</p><p>
    
    The sitar and ambient noise interlude of ""Bani Park"" gives way to the
    acoustic slide guitar workout of ""Abreaction,"" which is criminally allotted
    less than a minute to work its magic.  ""The Mezereon Dynasty"" follows, full
    of pentatonic melodies plucked out on some sort of lute-- possibly a Chinese
    ruan.  ""Nile Monitor"" is an all-too-brief piece dominated by meditative
    raga-like oud parts and droning tamburas.  The album does end at its highest
    point, though, with ""Steep Creek,"" a fabulous triple acoustic guitar
    instrumental that nods to the late, great John Fahey, and wouldn't sound
    terribly out of place on Gorky's Zygotic Mynci's <i>Blue Trees</i> EP.</p><p>
    
    The primary shortcoming here is that not enough of these pieces feel fully
    fleshed, and a few of them just tend to either hover listlessly or wander
    aimlessly.  By and large, each style is still too compartmentalized for the
    album to feel truly cohesive.  What you end up with is an occasionally
    engaging record that tries admirably to eliminate the very distinction
    between the folk styles of the world, and ultimately fails in that endeavor.
    It's a reasonably enjoyable listen, but most will be distracted by the time
    it's over.</p></div>"|4065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4065-ii/|6.1|Joe Tangari

I think not!""</p><p>
    
    ""But Master Holmes, the note!"" Watson clutched the document apparently left
    on the mantelpiece by the newly deceased Lord Barrington-Essex III, whose
    body lay on the parlor floor of his winter estate. He read the words again:</p><p>
<i>I cannot bear it anymore. Blink 182 and their countless ilk have reduced
    the esteemed form of punk rock, ultimately, into a cheap novelty act, devoid
    of purpose or soul.  Alien Ant Farm's ""Smooth Criminal"" cover was the nail
    in my coffin.  The only option, for me, was suicide.  Goodbye, uncool world.</i></p><p>
    
    Lord Barrington-Essex III</p><p>
    
    Holmes dismissed the note with a wave of his oversized hand. ""Watson, you will
    observe that the signature on that note does not precisely match the one on
    this crude painting Lord Barrington-Essex created before he was fiendishly
    murdered!  Also, it is clear that the victim was not disenchanted with the
    state of punk music-- he was, in fact, just discovering it. Note what was in
    his stereo unit, which, I deduce from the lack of dust, was played extremely
    recently. It's Thee Headcoats' debut album, <i>Headcoats Down!</i></p><p>
    
    ""But Holmes,"" Watson blurted, ""that record is from 1989. He could have been
    waxing nostalgic for what once was...""</p><p>
    
    ""Not so, my dear Watson. The original release of this album on Thee Headcoats
    songwriter Billy Childish's own label, Hangman Records, was vinyl-only. This
    is a CD reissue from Damaged Goods. A fresh purchase. No doubt Lord
    Barrington-Essex was just getting excited about music again. Listen!""</p><p>
    
    Holmes pressed play. The first song, ""Smile Now,"" blasted out at high volume.
    It contained all the simple trademarks of Thee Headcoats: blues-infused punk
    with buzzing guitar; Billy Childish's compressed vocals laughingly bleating
    out simple lyrics of loveloss and retribution. Somehow it made the ""Louie,
    Louie"" chord progression sound fresh.</p><p>
    
    ""Please Little Baby"" followed, with a fast surf beat propelling a rolling
    organ. Watson perused the liner notes but couldn't find a keyboardist listed.
    He did note that the three gentlemen mugging on the cover had equipped very
    familiar headgear.</p><p>
    
    ""Watson, notice how he says 'Oh pleeeaase.' How a rocker says 'please' is of
    paramount importance. Rock is the music of begging, a prayer that turns women
    from mere mortals into gods. I deduce that Billy Childish is the real thing
    by the way he intones the word.""</p><p>
    
    ""You're correct as usual, detective,"" Watson agreed. ""Even when he's putting
    us on, it's not with some snotty joke, but with a warm winsome manner.""</p><p>
    
    Indeed, this music, in all its simplicity, ran from quite sober to downright
    silly. ""Child's Death Letter"" detailed Mr. Childish's last wishes and funereal
    philosophy. ""When I die, I don't want no mark on my grave,"" he howled on the
    almost-folk number, as an unsteady slide guitar ascended like a departing
    soul. On ""John the Revelator,"" a song performed a cappella, save for a handclap,
    Childish was so ensconced in his message that he practically gargled with
    passion. Then, on ""I'll Make You Mine,"" he laughed a great laugh as he sang,
    ""I'll put my brand on you."" And, in perhaps the best song Watson had ever
    heard on the subject, Thee Headcoats waxed eloquent on ""Wily Coyote"":</p><p>
<i>I got a stack of dynamite and a hundred-ton weight<br/>
    I got TNT birdseed to use as my bait<br/>
    I got a blunderbuss contraption and a Sherman tank<br/>
    I got cannonball fuel injected rollerskates<br/>
    So little Road Runner, let me put you straight</i></p><p>
    
    This blues stomper left the impression that the Road Runner would soon be
    caught. It was a message of hope for Watson.</p><p>
    
    ""No, Watson, no one listening to this record could kill himself. It's too
    full of laughter, and the simple bluesy lines with punk's raw vitality are
    an unbeatable formula that a prolific master like Billy Childish would
    repeatedly use to generate hundreds of whimsical, wonderful songs. And I've
    just deduced that, despite the recent breakup of Thee Headcoats, they're
    coming out with another album later this year.  Billy Childish has even
    assembled a new band called the Buff Medways.</p><p>
    
    ""So Lord Barrington-Essex III would have something to live for.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yes. Note also how he's been sawed in half and preserved in an aquarium of
    formaldehyde. A strange method of suicide.""</p><p>
    
    ""It's like the work of that installation artist Damien Hirst with his Stuckist
    Art movement. Do you think Hirst could be the culprit?""</p><p>
    
    ""No, dear Watson, I'm afraid this is the work of my archrival, Professor
    Moriarty.""</p><p>
    
    ""Really!  It seems he's been responsible for the last seven murders we've
    investigated.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yes, he's been on quite a roll.""</p><p>
    
    Holmes pocketed his magnifying glass and donned his overcoat. Watson grabbed
    his bag and made ready to leave. Then he paused.</p><p>
    
    ""Holmes?""</p><p>
    
    ""Yes, Watson?""</p><p>
    
    ""Do you think you'll ever get sick of punk rock?""</p><p>
    
    Holmes sighed. ""I swear I'll quit it someday, old man, but I say the same
    thing about my seven-percent solution, and just look at these tracks.""</p><p>

    found a way to predict what the end of the universe will look like.  Okay,
    so this particular issue of <i>Time</i> was several months old, but the study
    of the universe, how it formed, and how it may end has always fascinated me.
    Anyway, it seems that physicists and astronomers are settling on a theory
    that basically suggests that the universe will keep expanding until it
    reaches total entropy, dying with a mere whimper in the near-infinite future,
    with even base subatomic elements separated by light years of cold, still
    void.</p><p>
    
    There's really no need for us to worry about this, of course, as the universe's
    coming degenerate period will only bring T.S. Eliot's predictions to life
    after the passage of trillions upon trillions of years-- long after our own
    blue planet is consumed by our expanding sun.  As terrifying and
    incomprehensible as the thought of our universe destroying itself through
    infinite expansion may sound, I can't help but think that'd I'd like to be
    there when it happens, so that I might get to see what it looks like, or
    perhaps what it sounds like.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, we'll never know what sights and sounds await the end of the
    universe, but as far as finite, timely considerations go, I think Pinetop
    Seven may be just the band to soundtrack the coming of entropy.  A year ago--
    even a month ago-- I never would have thought that, but <i>Lest We Forget</i>,
    a mail order- and tour-only compilation of unreleased Pinetop Seven material,
    suggests otherwise.</p><p>
<i>Lest We Forget</i> contains five unreleased gems from the songbook of
    Pinetop leader Darren Richard, a remix of ""Mission District"" from last year's
    astounding <i>Bringing Home the Last Great Strike</i>, and over half an hour
    of excerpts from a live, improvised performance that constituted the
    soundtrack for the silent film <i>The Wind</i>.  It's these improvised pieces
    that conjure for me images of the very fabric of the universe flying apart
    and reconstituting in unimaginable ways.</p><p>
    
    For the live soundtrack sessions, Richard tapped Chicago-based percussion
    wizards Glenn Kotche (Boxhead Ensemble, Simon Joyner) and Gerald Dowd,
    violinist Jessica Billey, and vibist Jason Adiesciewisz.  The five musicians
    carry on a meditative dialogue that's remarkably evocative-- you usually find
    yourself getting an image and then looking at the track listing only to find
    that the image you visualized is suggested by the title.  ""Norther!/ Storm
    Subsides"" is perhaps the best example of this, with Kotche and Dowd whipping
    up a massive whirlwind over the subtle textures provided by the other three
    musicians.  It's free music at its finest, capturing a specific feeling and
    conferring it upon the listener.</p><p>
    
    This gives way to the pensive holding pattern of ""Horse in the Sky,"" which is
    ultimately relieved by the compilation's closing track, ""Burial Scene,"" which
    is dominated by Richard's spare piano lines conjuring Chopin at his most
    despondent.  This performance sits surprisingly well next to the first six
    tracks, all of which constitute proper songs ranging from 1998 to 2001 and
    recorded at the band's Chicago loft space.</p><p>
    
    You know a band is really great when you're totally entranced 15 seconds into
    the first track on their odds-and-sods, tour-only collection of outtakes and
    live recordings.  The unreleased demo ""Mosquitoes"" opens with a percussion
    loop before piling on vibes and guitar.  Richard croons through the verses
    before layering his buoyant tenor in lush harmonies on the chorus.  Melissa
    Bach's cello-- the only instrument not played by Richard on the song-- swoons
    sonorously on the bridge, lending a dark underpinning to Richard's stunning
    falsetto harmonies.</p><p>
    
    Darren Richard is completely alone on the other demo included here, the
    gorgeous ""Cradlesong.""  It's almost unbelievable that one man recorded this
    by himself, as all of the instruments are impeccably played, including a
    deftly interwoven guitar loop.  Richard even goes out of his way to vary his
    tone on the backing vocals in order to make it sound like multiple people
    singing backup.  The structured instrumental, ""Some Ritual Business at the
    Lake,"" from the sessions for <i>Bringing Home the Last Great Strike</i>,
    also features Richard solo, throwing down some impressive slide guitar.</p><p>
    
    Richard is joined by frequent collaborators Ryan Hembrey and Charles Kim on
    ""Left in a Room for Days"" and ""Devoted Won't Do,"" both culled from the
    sessions for <i>Rigging the Toplights</i>, the band's sophomore album.  ""Left
    in a Room for Days,"" had it been included, would have been a highlight on an
    album full of highlights, with its descending chord sequence and wailing
    slide guitar.  I've often heard critics desperately try to label Pinetop
    Seven's music as insurgent country, but it's songs like this that confound
    even the most adept categorizers.</p><p>
    
    Finally, Mactra's remix of ""Mission District"" largely preserves the original's
    structure, preferring instead to toy with each component of the arrangement,
    vacuum-packing the bass and sucking the vocals into an echo chamber.  Not
    usually being one who digs remixes, I tend to look for a certain moment where
    the remix takes the original and makes a truly inspired addition, which is
    just what Mactra does in the last verse, adding wild percussive loops for a
    propulsive climax.</p><p>
<i>Lest We Forget</i> portrays Darren Richard as the central force in a very
    versatile collective that draws freely from the communal Chicago scene.
    Richard himself emphasizes that this is a demo-quality release intended for
    fans only, but it seems as though he's just being modest, as there's only one
    moment on the entire disc-- the hissy intro to ""Cradlesong""-- that sounds
    underproduced. The fact that something so utterly worth having is unavailable
    in stores is a shame.  Any extra effort needed to obtain this collection is
    well worth it, as the rewards contained within are enough to repay any
    expenditure, and ease your nerves about your place in a doomed universe.</p></div>"|6304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6304-lest-we-forget/|8.8|Joe Tangari

I mean, what's up with them?  There's one outside my window right
    now, down on the concrete, in the arms of some big, oily brute, passive
    and seemingly content.  But the thing with me and chicks isn't just that
    they're virtually always down there when I'm up here.  The thing that
    gets me is that the guy she's with doesn't know any better than I do what's
    going on inside her head.  As much as he smiles and nods along when she
    moves her mouth, no male will ever truly understand what females are
    ultimately up to.  I can only guess that she stopped out there because she
    was drawn to the sweet pop music dripping from my stereo like an ant stuck
    in a puddle of honey.</p><p>
    
    At least, this is how frustrated hetero males have been thinking for as long
    as the thoughts of frustrated hetero males have been recorded.  Inked on
    papyrus, set in type, expressed in terms of humors, temperatures, and tides,
    and eventually grooved onto vinyl, it's a piggish sentiment backed by libido
    and ignorance (and more than a little unfair to women).  It's also, oddly
    enough, a sentiment that's been the motivating force behind a great deal of
    beauty, most notably in pop music (possibly the greatest repository for male
    frustration ever created).  Much of the time, male pop is trying to both
    seduce and explain the opposite sex in the same instant, knowing all the
    while that one of these objectives is a lost cause.</p><p>
    
    Mercury Rev's <i>All Is Dream</i> claims its share of pop brilliance by taking
    up this position with enormous reserves of intelligence, grace, and emotion.
    As long-time Rev flautist Suzanne Thorpe-- who's been with the band since
    their sprawling psych-noise days-- has been demoted to the orchestra pit for
    this release, the band is now all-male.  With Dave Fridmann mainly taking the
    role of expert producer (and making contributions on bass and mellotron) and
    Jimy Chambers passing the sticks on to new drummer Jeff Mercel, the core
    group is possibly the most stripped-down line-up in Mercury Rev's 10-year
    recording history.  Though their approach hasn't changed from the radically
    orchestral turn of 1998's <i>Deserter's Songs</i>, these songs are far more
    personal than their last set.</p><p>
    
    Even when bathed in Jonathan Donahue's constant wash of fever-dream lyrics,
    it's clear that these are Mercury Rev's first real (though predictably odd)
    love songs.  ""If God moves across the water/ Then the girl moves in other
    ways/ And I'm losing sight of either,"" he sings in ""Nite And Fog,"" his
    collapsing love story gently suspended above its lyrical melancholy by the
    song's flowing strings and Fridmann's buoyant bassline.  Throughout the album,
    Donahue takes the concept of woman as the proverbial ""other"" to an almost
    illogical extreme, funneling oceans of uncertainty into a female form and
    turning these emotions out again into uncomfortable reflections on death,
    fate, and all of those other nasty things.</p><p>
    
    ""Tides of the Moon"" takes a typical image of femininity and transforms it
    into a meditation on loss and powerlessness (""The threads that run through
    your life/ Hang from your sleeve/ Wind through your soul/ The kind you can't
    control/ But wish you could break""), only to come back to the now-unsettling
    romantic sentiment, ""It ties you to me.""  But even during all this, the band
    refuses to simply wallow in emotion, instead confronting their connections
    to pop lyricism smartly.</p><p>
    
    On ""A Drop in Time,"" Donahue quips, ""Her words profane, her mouth divine/ I
    tried to sympathize with both sides/ But I was caught, like a floating
    thought/ Stuck inside of Leonard Cohen's mind.""  As playful as they can
    occasionally be, though, Donahue's words are always rooted in nagging doubts
    and creeping riddles like those voiced by his creaky falsetto in ""Lincoln's
    Eyes"" (""What is dark like a birthmark/ Pulls like a magnet/ Male and female/
    And covets like a dragon?"").</p><p>
    
    The music, of course, is by no means as unstable as the lyrics.  Where the
    band seemed a bit more easygoing and loose in their explorations of the
    orchestral-pop form on <i>Deserter's Songs</i>, <i>All is Dream</i> takes
    the band's newfound preoccupations in a definite direction.  This makes the
    music sound a bit overdetermined at times (most notably, the opening track's
    calculated symphonic swells), but for the most part, their grasp of the sound
    has improved.  The dark, driving rocker ""Chains"" cuts out at exactly the right
    moment, and bangs out a few cathartic Beethoven string hits before again
    steamrolling ahead.  A soprano voice that sobs out the soft prelude to
    ""Lincoln's Eyes"" returns as a banshee-wail in the song's brink-of-chaos
    midsection, and the song returns obliquely to this sound in its gorgeous
    bowed-saws outro.  ""Little Rhymes"" makes the most from its beautiful pedal
    steel lines, accentuating Donahue's melody without obscuring it.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Mercury Rev don't need all this fancy instrumentation to get their
    point across.  ""Spiders and Flies,"" a relatively simple piano ballad, stands
    as  the most affecting song on the album.  As Mercel caresses the keys, Donahue
    quietly unravels, confessing fears of death and disconnection from the unnamed
    female who's been flitting around the edges of the album the whole time.  And,
    with shocking ease, the band shifts from these depths into the exultantly
    dreamy final track, ""Hercules.""  As the song's percussive glee swells
    alongside guitarist Grasshopper's transcendently melodic noise solo, it
    becomes oddly clear that Mercury Rev has, in some way, come to love this
    uncertainty-- just as the pop protagonist can't stay away from the inscrutable
    object of his affections, and the pop fan can find a place in its heart for
    the erratic motions of a band as in love with music as this one.</p></div>"|5236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5236-all-is-dream/|8.5|Brendan Reid

After
    being pummeled over the head for years and years with I Love Yous and You
    Are So Beautifuls, the most direct way of expressing images of love and beauty
    have pretty much lost all impact.  Melodic tricks can wear thin just as easily.
    Hooks are all well and good, but when you've seen a hook enough times, you
    know not to bite.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the problem is that most pop music doesn't put enough faith in the
    listener. Everything must be laid out in the most obvious of terms, and
    eventually, that obviousness obscures whatever the music originally intended
    to convey. If you want to invoke the quiet beauty of the ocean, for example,
    you can write a pop song that says, ""Hey, the ocean is really beautiful,"" or
    you can try to come up with a sonic approximation of that beauty.</p><p>
    
    It's a huge undertaking to attempt to capture something so visual in a song.
    But for Phil Elvrum, it seems to be second nature.  <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i>, the
    follow-up to last year's gorgeous brainmelt <i>It Was Hot, We Stayed In the
    Water</i>, captures the sea, the sky, and the mountains in a sonic panorama
    that seems to live without beginning or end. A sprawling, swirling composition
    that is both as varied and as consistent as the landscape itself, <i>The Glow
    Pt. 2</i> exceeds even its predecessor in capturing the simultaneous wrath
    and fragility of nature. And sounding really, really cool.</p><p>
    
    Like <i>It Was Hot</i>'s ""The Pull"" before it, ""I Want Wind to Blow"" opens
    with subtle manipulations of acoustic guitars across stereo channels. There's
    an amazing sense of open space to the track as overtones from a low, rhythmic
    rumble, and from the stereo acoustic guitars, create a wash of barely audible
    noise floating through the mid-frequencies. ""I Want Wind to Blow,"" like a
    good portion of <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i>, uses repetition and understatement to
    transform itself from a simple song into a landscape.</p><p>
    
    And as with any landscape, the way the songs on <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i> are
    perceived greatly affects the impact of the record. This album simply must
    be listened to on headphones.  Hearing the record on regular speakers is
    like staring at the Grand Canyon through a Viewmaster. The illusion of depth
    is weak at best, and easily broken.  With headphones, the sounds contained
    within the record absolutely come to life, bouncing and slithering from ear
    to ear. The use of stereo panning is as integral a part of the disc as the
    melodies and instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    With this stereo enhancement, parts of <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i> are absolutely
    breathtaking.  And perhaps the single most breathtaking song on the album is
    its title track, which may or may not be a thematic follow-up to ""The Glow,""
    the 11-minute-long centerpiece of <i>It Was Hot, We Stayed In the Water</i>.
    Opening with blasts of fuzzy guitar and massive drums, ""The Glow Pt. 2""
    segues somewhat abruptly into another segment of stereo acoustic guitars,
    before giving way to a drop-dead gorgeous wash of multitracked organs. On
    top of this, Elvrum lets loose what could be the most striking lyrics he's
    ever penned: ""I faced death. I went in with my arms swinging. But I heard my
    own breath and had to face that I'm still living. I'm still flesh. I hold on
    to awful feelings. I'm not dead... My chest still draws breath. I hold it.
    I'm buoyant. There's no end.""  Elvrum delivers these lyrics in a melodic
    stream-of-consciousness style that's structured enough to be musically
    riveting, but loose enough to sound spontaneous and sincere. As the last
    words of the song fade, the swell of organs segues into a trebly acoustic
    guitar and hi-hat section highly reminiscent of early Modest Mouse.</p><p>
    
    Nowhere on this album are there short, straightforward pop songs like <i>It
    Was Hot</i>'s cover of Eric's Trip ""Sand"" or ""Karl Blau.""  Instead, the
    record ebbs and flows gracefully between fragile acoustic numbers like
    ""Headless Horseman,"" and overpowering swells of noise, with all points in
    between represented.  The flow between songs on <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i> is
    absolutely flawless-- the album functions as one giant piece of music as
    well as it does a collection of songs. Themes of flesh and blood, water and
    wood, and life and death permeate the record, connecting well enough to
    create a sense of something greater without beating you over the head with
    its concept.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i> is the sound of one man working through a
    changing landscape-- a single voice challenging its surroundings while also
    accepting that it's powerless to alter them.  The disc ends with a throbbing
    heartbeat, the most basic sign of life having braved through the stormy trek
    that precedes it. <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i> is unpredictable, volatile, vibrant,
    terrifying, and comforting.  <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i> is alive.</p></div>"|5269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5269-the-glow-pt-2/|9.2|Matt LeMay

    home-knit sweater-- the sleeves may be a little irregular, but the elements
    can't get you.  And on top of that, it's totally one of a kind, just like
    that sweater.  Low, Seely, and the New Year played through a pillow are good
    points of reference for the American Analog Set, but over the course of four
    albums and a rarities compilation, the band has grown far too unique to bare
    direct comparisons.</p><p>
    
    This band is the only one I've heard that can open an album with a song called
    ""Punk as Fuck"" and make it feel like you're curled up next to a fire with a good
    book.  Vibes swell around you, guitars meditate in the background, and then the
    vocals enter, a soothing tenor calling you out of the real world and into that
    warm place.  Brushed drums and barely-there bass propel the proceedings with
    measured patience.  There's nothing urgent about this music; it flows at its own
    pace.</p><p>
    
    From there, <i>Know by Heart</i> flows gracefully through a series of warm
    textures and somnambulant melodies, much like the band's past efforts. Thankfully,
    though, the band have avoided becoming stuck in a holding pattern, leaving their
    old trademark Farfisas in mothballs, and instead pulling out a phalanx of
    alternately soothing and buzzing organs and Rhodes pianos, changing up the sound
    often.  The band also toys with a few new tempos and meters.</p><p>
    
    Overall, the effect of these changes is that <i>Know by Heart</i> offers a great
    many more standout moments than any other American Analog Set album, but winds up
    feeling a bit less consistent as a result.  That's a small price to pay, though,
    when you get songs like ""Million Young,"" with its brisk rhythm and buzzy organ,
    or ""Aaron &amp; Maria,"" which aims to add another ""youngsters go off to the Big City""
    chapter to the Great American Songbook.  Warm, clean guitars surreptitiously sink
    monster hooks into your cerebellum as laid-back drums gently urge the song to its
    conclusion.</p><p>
    
    There's something extremely admirable about music that demands to be heard by
    whispering, never rising to a clatter or resorting to petulant whining to attract
    attention.  Instead, the American Analog Set create quietly engaging hymns that
    make you want to pay attention.  If you should choose to ignore it because it's
    not making a racket, well, hey, that's more for me.</p><p>
<i>Know by Heart</i> ends pretty much exactly where it should, with the pulsing
    ""We're Computerizing and We Just Don't Need You Anymore.""  Lyrically, the song
    holds an all-too-familiar tale of technology replacing heart, but the music is
    what really gets me.  The band casts a glance back toward their old sound here,
    while inconspicuously inserting a cold synth low in the mix, suggesting that the
    band themselves may be headed into the brave new world on future releases.  But
    even if that world doesn't yield rewards as pleasing as this, it will probably
    at least bare giving a listen to.  In the meantime, <i>Know by Heart</i> will
    remain a warm, reliable source of calm in a loud, confusing world.</p></div>"|157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/157-know-by-heart/|8.0|Joe Tangari

If something seems too dull or sugary, you put
    some butter on it to give its taste some semblance of body and depth. The
    butter tastes good, so you put on more butter. Soon, whatever tastes accompany
    the butter cease to matter. You just want more of that butter. Yummy, yummy
    butter. You refuse to acknowledge the value of anything that is non-buttery,
    insisting that it's trite and unsophisticated. ""Sugar is for kids,"" you
    shout, ""I want my goddamn butter!"" You begin to hate the sugar-eaters in all
    their smug simplicity. Everything you eat, and everything you cook, simply
    must have butter. It becomes a way of life.</p><p>
    
    But it's not long before things start to go awry. Your friends get sick of
    you always forcing them to eat your buttery treats. While you can't get
    enough of it, it makes them feel sick and heavy. But you don't care-- they
    just don't understand the complex texture and full, rich body of butter.</p><p>
    
    Friendless, you begin to sink into a state of depression. All those years
    immersed in butter have finally caught up with you, and its heaviness is
    beginning to wear on you. You've gained hundreds of pounds, and you can
    slowly feel your arteries hardening. Alone, bloated, and miserable, you die.
    You fucking die.</p><p>
    
    Irony hasn't been clinically proven to lead to arteriosclerosis, but it does
    hold true that it's best when used sparingly and with great skill. Quasi has
    always been dear to me because they're one of the few bands that manages to
    lay the irony on thick without being too dark or pretentious. On <i>Featuring
    ""Birds""</i>, the juxtaposition of Sam Coomes' massive pop hooks and his bleak
    lyrical outlook seemed to blend together perfectly-- like a goofy-faced clown
    telling you that have lung cancer.  Except even more perfect.</p><p>
    
    The greatest part about <i>Featuring ""Birds""</i> was that even if Coomes had
    been singing about happy elves prancing through fields of tall, green grass,
    the album would have rocked. The songs were just that good. Thankfully, the
    lyrics spread a message we could all relate to: life blows.  But on the
    record's follow-up, 1999's <i>Field Studies</i>, the message remained
    unchanged, and without the brilliant, catchy, concise songs to back them up,
    the lyrics lost a lot of their punch. Without the songs, all you're left with
    is shtick. And shtick gets old pretty fast, as proven by the infuriatingly
    uneven <i>The Sword of God</i>.</p><p>
    
    Like most bands that don't suck, Quasi is at their best when they sound like
    themselves. Yeah, I know, I know, bands should try to branch out in new
    directions and all that. But when a band succeeds in exploring new directions
    after already mastering one sound (which is beyond rare), they generally do
    so by bringing the better elements of their old sound into the new mix. If
    Quasi were to record a sprawling guitar rock album with hooks the likes of
    those on <i>Featuring ""Birds,""</i> I would applaud my ass off. But this is
    not the case.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the best parts of <i>The Sword of God</i> are the parts that embrace
    Coomes' ability to write driving pop hooks. ""It's Raining"" features his
    trademark Roxichord swagger and a memorable, catchy melody. This is good.
    Sure, it sounds like the stuff on <i>Featuring ""Birds,""</i> but this is
    compensated for by the fact that it's just really, really good.  Slightly
    less infectious but similarly successful is ""A Case of No Way Out,"" a darker,
    more complex song that makes nice use of trademark indie rock boy-girl vocal
    arrangements without slipping into cloying inanity.</p><p>
    
    These two songs both have their roots firmly planted in Quasi's pessimistic
    pop song tradition. Unfortunately, the efforts made by the band to expand
    their oeuvre on <i>The Sword of God</i> just fall flat. Long-winded
    instrumental passages, extended exploration of new instruments, and <i>more</i>
    bird noises do not a good record make, and <i>The Sword of God</i> makes this
    all too evident.  Exploring new territory only pays off if you're comfortable
    with it and you have quality material to back it up.  And that's usually not
    the case here.</p><p>
    
    Still, one has to appreciate that Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss are still trying.
    If some of the new directions explored on <i>The Sword of God</i> had really
    great songs behind them, the resulting album could have been fantastic. But
    in keeping with the band's general outlook on life, their records just keep
    getting worse. Where's the butter in that?</p></div>"|6614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6614-the-sword-of-god/|6.0|Matt LeMay

    musicians refer to as ""their art.""  These are guys like Andy Wallace, Jack
    Joseph Puig, Butch Vig, Rob Cavallo, and Chris Lord-Alge that show up on 67%
    of all major label releases with theoretically ""powerful"" guitars.  Rock
    mythology depicts them as old white guys with spiky shocks of Feria-dyed hair,
    PVC pants, artificial pumpkin-skin tans, shimmering shirts with hot-rod
    flames, and silver knuckle-jewelry.  They sit behind beige sound boards with
    countless dials, levels, switches, and knobs, waiting for the latest
    Collective Soul, Toadies, Rehab, Offspring, or Harvey Danger master tapes to
    pass through.  And you can't help but wonder-- these men having no true
    interest or input in the musical accomplishment already pressed within the
    ones and zeros of those DATs-- if, say, Lord-Alge hears the new Butthole
    Surfers album and mutters to himself, ""Sweet Jesus Fuck, this is awful.""</p><p>
    
    Well, crack your bejeweled knuckles, Cavallo, because you have your work cut
    out for you.  The Butthole Surfers, over their double-decade career, have
    proven, if little else, that perseverance, antics, and audacity count for a
    lot more than actual talent.  They've never made a good record.  Ever.  You've
    likely heard the titles-- <i>Hairway to Steven</i>, <i>Rembrant Pussyhorse</i>,
    <i>Locust Abortion Technician</i>-- and chuckled at them.  Perhaps you've seen
    the John Wayne Gacy cover art, or heard Dave Kendall spout ""Buh'ol Saafahs"" on
    ""120 Minutes"" circa 1991.  Or maybe you've read about the court ruling in the
    case of <i>B.H. Surfers v. Touch &amp; Go's Corey Rusk</i>, but you've never sat
    and listened to an album, have you?  The albums have always been auxiliary to
    their feces'n'fire'n'fightin' live shows, Lollapalooza pioneering, commercial
    one-hit-wondering, and general personality of Gibby Haines and Paul Leary.
    Their best known album has no track titles and mentions scatology and farm
    animals repeatedly.  They're Pere Ubu, Wesley Willis, the Dead Milkmen, and
    And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead rolled into one chaotic Texan mess.
    That is, they were, until ""Pepper"" and Disney.</p><p>
<i>Weird Revolution</i>, the Surfers' long-delayed follow-up to <i>Electriclarryland</i>,
    was originally meant to be <i>After the Astronaut</i>, but it was aborted in
    the final hour by Capitol Records.  Its pop-western artwork would later show
    up on a Marcy Playground album.  The Buttholes now call the Disney-owned
    Hollywood Records their home, and like <i>Bubble Boy</i>, the end product can
    only result in corporate heads rolling at Buena Vista.  <i>Weird Revolution</i>
    exists only because the Butthole Surfers have mouths to feed, mortgages, and
    no other option in life.  This is never the beginning of an essential album.</p><p>
    
    In their increasing age and decreasing health, the Butthole Surfers no longer
    throw themselves around on stage, setting cymbals on fire, tearing apart sex
    dolls, and pissing on each other.  These days, the off-record excitement has
    been reduced to a silly animated album cover, a CD-ROM, and Gibby Haines'
    ironic wearing of a Hanson t-shirt in press photos.  He actually hates them!
    Or does he?!  Irony upon irony upon irony.</p><p>
    
    So what of the album?  Bedrock tracks from <i>Astronaut</i> were reworked,
    filtered and mixed to sound ""of the moment.""  Chris Lord-Alge's lacquer and
    radio-prescribed hum coats the record.  The thin music seems to emanate from
    a TV you can't turn off.  Each song putters on a weak beat that jangles and
    blips as if they dumped the ambient sounds of a Midway arcade over some Black
    Grape outtakes.  ""Venus"" and ""Mexico"" flirt with Eastern sounds.  It's as if
    you took Eastern Airlines to Eastern City in the heart of the Far East with
    nothing but some drugs and an English-to-Eastern dictionary to get by. ""God,
    Zeus, Allah, Buddha,"" Haynes says.  ""Bob Dylan on a motor scooter.""  It's
    about as surreal as a Lunchables commercial.  The Butthole Surfers have
    finally become shocking only in their sheer banality, like a watered-down
    mix of the worst Beck and Perry Farrell material you can imagine.</p><p>
    
    Two songs stand out as premeditated ""hits,"" in that they have verses,
    choruses, and the most names listed in the production credits.  ""The Shame of
    Life"" lives up to its title by listing Kid Rock as a songwriter.  You know
    this by the mention of ""girls,"" ""money,"" ""crack,"" and a ""loaded automatic.""
    Calculated guitar riffs fart in the chorus like a weak John Carpenter score.
    It has the potential of turning up on shock-jock modern radio, where you'll
    have to pay strict attention to discern whether it's a new Uncle Kracker tune
    or a Slim Jim ad.  ""Dracula from Houston,"" the other ""featured hit"" (according
    to the sticker on the front-- Hollywood Records must be psychic!), opens with
    some bongos and the guitar line from ""Sweet Jane.""  Gibby spits lazy rhymes
    like Anthony Kiedis before the song bursts into a massive Smash Mouth copy:
    ""Oh no/ We gotta go /We're not gonna live forever.""  A fucking CG-animated
    donkey should be singing this.  In hell.</p><p>
    
    Exhibit #19,954 in the eternal, one-sided case of commercialism and aging v.
    art: <i>Weird Revolution</i> unintentionally lives up to its title by
    embodying the inexplicable surge of honky fratboy Jeep-beat rock that can't
    disappear soon enough.</p></div>"|1043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1043-weird-revolution/|0.4|Brent DiCrescenzo

The great follow-up to <i>Homogenic</i> we've anticipated
    since that overcast late-September afternoon in 1997 when we first sat
    listening to the album for the first time, wondering what she might do next.
    Somehow, it doesn't seem worth the wait.</p><p>
<i>Homogenic</i>, still the most innovative and substantial release of Björk's
    solo career, spilled over with rich melody and sybaritic imagery.  Its dense,
    programmed percussion reflected IDM's infancy (<i>The Richard D. James Album</i>
    being a frequent point of comparison), yet submerged it in brooding Russian
    strings buoyed by thumping bass hits and Björk's urgent frustrations.  The
    album's cavernous echoes and masterful arrangements sprang to larger-than-life
    proportions like the American musicals Selma fantasized about in <i>Dancer in
    the Dark</i>.  Both cohesive and inconceivably modern, <i>Homogenic</i>
    sounded like the future-music of childhood dreams.</p><p>
    While undeniably beautiful, <i>Vespertine</i> fails to give electronic music
    the forward push it received on Björk's preceding albums.  Rather than
    designing sounds never before imagined, the album merely sounds current,
    relying on the technology of standard studio software and the explorations
    of the Powerbook elite.  There are few surprises here for the Björk
    fan, and fewer for the electro aficionado.  Sure, it's nice to listen to, but
    it rarely challenges like <i>Post</i>'s ""Enjoy"" and ""Headphones,"" or like
    <i>Homogenic</i>'s ""Pluto.""  And what's a Björk album without the ambush?</p><p>
    That said, <i>Vespertine</i> has more than just a handful of charms.  The
    record is gorgeously orchestrated with the Icelander's neon string sections,
    chiming music boxes, and intricately arranged background Björks.  Its
    production, though never truly groundbreaking, is always beautifully executed
    with washes of harp, organic synthsounds and majestic, dreamlike effects.
    Björk hasn't lost her ability to create forested sonic otherworlds, or to
    achieve an overwhelmingly full sound while maintaining an air of wide, open
    space.  In fact, it could be argued that, texturally, she has mastered her
    trademarks with this album.</p><p>
    ""Hidden Place"" opens <i>Vespertine</i> with a glitchy, almost lo-fi melodic
    loop, paired with the deep sub-bass attack that has dominated the low-end
    of Björk's music in recent years.  ""Aurora"" begins with rhythmic broomsweeps
    and awakens with delicate frosted chimes and angelic choirs.  ""Heirloom""
    alters between what sounds like a samba preset on a vintage Wurlitzer organ
    and skittering breakbeats, and is decorated with inverted synthtones and
    analog keyboards.  And these songs, like all the others, are saturated in
    a thousand layers of whirling, grandiose strings and porcelain
    pings of fragile concordance.</p><p>
    Yet, <i>Vespertine</i> is riddled with sameness, and the unshakable feeling
    that you've heard these songs before.  And coated in such a delicious sheen,
    it's easy to miss that the music here lacks a major component of Björk's past
    recordings; strip <i>Vespertine</i> down to melody alone, and you're left with
    little substance.  Only on occasion does Björk rise above the swelling
    symphonies and swirling digitalia with a memorable piece of music, and when
    she does, it seems fleeting.  Perhaps it appears for a moment in the
    repetitious chorus of ""It's Not Up to You,"" or the album's shimmering closer,
    the Oval-sampling ""Unison.""  But blink and you'll miss it, as it's invariably
    swallowed whole by the album's vast, ethereal instrumentation.</p><p>
    Glitch wizards Matmos were called in during the <i>Vespertine</i> sessions to
    co-produce many of the record's tracks.  I wonder where they are.  Nowhere is
    their signature sound even remotely traceable.  A theory: starstruck by
    Björk's iconic visage, they lent what they felt she would want, and left the
    experimenting to their own releases.  Clearly, Björk realized that this duo
    was capable of inventing sounds beyond her wildest dreams, but the end result
    is typical; not exactly a rehash, but nevertheless predictable.</p><p>
    Still, <i>Vespertine</i> makes for an intriguing listen, and manages to hold
    its own after hours on repeat.  Were it not for the fact that Björk had
    already visited this terrain so reliably on previous outings, it could very
    well be her landmark achievement.  But with the astounding <i>Homogenic</i>
    behind her, its melodies timelessly memorable and its production similarly
    captivating, <i>Vespertine</i> stands only as a pleasant journey back through
    her usual netherworld.</p></div>"|727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/727-vespertine/|7.2|Ryan Schreiber

    line of musicians to flesh out his mad, perverse fantasies under the His
    Name Is Alive moniker. All of his albums before 1996's <i>Stars on ESP</i>
    are out-of-print in the U.S., so it's hard to trace Defever (once Warren)
    back to his lo-fi goth-folk-ethnic-guitar-pop roots without paying over $20
    for an import. What is available, therefore, is His Name Is Alive's
    evolutionary pattern over the past five years.</p><p>
<i>Stars on E.S.P.</i> was a dreamy, occasionally psychedelic pop record,
    toying with everything from stripped acoustic folk-pop to a complete
    structural replication of ""Good Vibrations""-- with a different melody and
    different lyrics altogether. It was also the last album to extensively
    feature the charmingly girlish Karin Oliver on lead vocals. 1998's <i>Ft.
    Lake</i> then subtly throttled fans with a full-on gutsy rock attack,
    although admittedly, it's nothing as fully straightforward as that; the
    entire record is peppered with synthesized oddities, not to mention a couple
    of trip-hop tracks to mix it up. Although Oliver made a few appearances on
    the record, soul vocalist Lovetta Pippen generally took the melodic reins.
    Then in '99, Defever had the gall to go off and release a solo record
    entitled <i>I Want You to Live One Hundred Years</i>, taking lo-fi to a
    new level by recording most of the old-timey yet original folk material to
    Edison wax cylinder.</p><p>
    
    On the latest outing, <i>Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth</i>, His Name
    Is Alive consists solely of Warn Defever and Lovetta Pippen. How do we know?
    Well, it's simple really; they're the only two people who have photos on
    resident 4AD graphic artist Vaughan Oliver's gorgeously fitting artwork,
    not to mention a terribly cheesy pun to cement the notion: ""LOVE &amp; WAR.""
    The record opens with Pippen's characteristic croon, but if you weren't told
    this were His Name Is Alive, it would take a while to guess that this music
    spilled from Defever's warped mind. Three quarters of <i>Someday My Blues Will
    Cover the Earth</i> consist of a time warp back to the mid-90s, when slow-jam
    R&amp;B; was innocent and carefree, while the rest is a mix between sparse ballads
    and a couple hints at traditional blues.</p><p>
    
    Go back and read that again. No, wait, you don't have to. I'll just write it
    again: Carefree, mid-90s slow-jam R&amp;B...; for which Warn Defever is responsible.
    Madness! Granted, it's not that much of a surprise that he's off doing
    something completely different.  What <i>is</i> a surprise is that three years
    after a record of rootsy pop/rock, and only two years after a country-folk
    throwback, he's decided to take on Pippen for a collaboration and dive into
    a project of this particular genre.  The curious thing is that they often
    succeed.</p><p>
    
    It's quite a shame, then, that not every track is up to par. Ironically
    enough, a song called ""Nothing Special"" opens the collection by squandering
    the album's best material in its first four minutes. Defever's sparse
    acoustic arrangements and drum machine beats, characteristic of most of
    the album's remainder, work best around a gorgeous melody such as this one.
    Pippen's subdued, harmonized laments in the priceless chorus come off as
    earnestly touching: ""I've been in the storm so long/ Nothing special
    anymore/ Angel sings from another world/ That's all I hear anymore.""</p><p>
    
    The only other success of this caliber comes later with ""One Year"", the
    previous version of which can be found in wax-cylinder folk-style on
    Defever's solo album. Truly funky wah-guitar, clavinet and reversed
    acoustic strumming are used to the track's advantage, making for a joyously
    indulgent breakdown in the coda. The rest of the R&amp;B; excursions are pleasant
    enough, but as Pippen sang herself, nothing special. The melodies become
    a bit samey and, by the ending title track, appear somewhat hackneyed. The
    only other guilty pleasure of this dominant style is on the slightly
    over-long, slightly trip-hop ""Write My Name in the Groove"", in which Pippen
    sings, in a melody recalling <i>Stars on E.S.P.</i>'s more restrained moments,
    ""If I'm quiet, I can hear your heart/ When I'm up on ya.""</p><p>
    
    The two other notable moments on <i>Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth</i>
    are a true 12-bar blues homage, enigmatically titled ""Karins Blues"", and a
    decelerated, beatless, acoustic version of ""Are We Still Married"", originally
    penned for the 1992 HNIA record <i>Home Is in Your Head</i>.  The latter is
    the most beautiful moment on the record, with gently plucked acoustic guitar
    weaving in and out of haunting piano chords and string accompaniment as
    Pippen lends true emotion to the record's best lyrics: ""I'm kind of getting
    shot at/ I'm kind of getting hurt.../ This is your last life/ Take me where
    you want to go.""</p><p>
    
    The ambition and daring that Warn Defever continually displays in his work,
    with His Name Is Alive and otherwise, is admirable. His willingness to
    plunge head-first into a foreign style shows his versatility and knowledge for
    creating authentic soundscapes of any kind, and his enthusiastic collaborative
    spirit is infectious as well. While I can't fully recommend <i>Someday My
    Blues Will Cover the Earth</i> as an entirely successful release, I can
    fervently encourage a closer investigation into the rest of his brilliantly
    eccentric catalog, a look out for his upcoming work, and maybe even a
    second glance at this record just to see what he's up to now.</p></div>"|3881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3881-someday-my-blues-will-cover-the-earth/|6.7|Spencer Owen

Disregard, for a
    moment, the man's cutesy elfin name and the fact that, together, you've
    recorded a sizable portion of indie rock's canon with Sprout playing the
    trusty sideman, contributing a few songs to each album to push it towards
    the obligatory 20-track standard.  Also take into account that when Guided
    by Voices went hi-fi, Sprout was left behind.  Granted, Sprout left of his
    own accord, pursuing a more sedate artistic life away from your band's hectic
    touring schedule.  But, even as he continued to release fine solo material,
    his circle of fame shrunk to a diehard core of GBVers while yours inched out
    into the public eye.  Really, would you still trust him?</p><p>
    
    Apparently, Tobin Sprout's not one to hold a grudge, despite the fact that
    Airport 5 would be the perfect place to air one.  With Sprout recording all
    of album's instrumental tracks in Northport, Michigan (about 450 miles away
    from the Dayton hidey-hole where Pollard recorded the vocals), he finally had
    his chance to either upstage the man who'd been both John and Paul to his
    George by laying down flashy arrangements, or to sabotage him with flimsy
    backing.  And since Pollard's too busy making albums to make albums, Sprout
    probably could've slipped it under the notoriously lax Pollard Quality Control
    Radar.  But he didn't.  And for a record created with such a vast distance
    between its creators, <i>Tower in the Fountain of Sparks</i> sounds remarkably
    cozy.</p><p>
    
    Sprout seems especially careful not to step on Pollard's toes here, plugging
    away on most of the tracks with dour, persistent strumming and a few unadorned
    rock beats.  Still, he's not afraid to add some sparkle, stitching jangly
    leads into this burlap canvas.  Sprout's slide guitar, a new addition since
    his GBV days, spills across ""Subatomic Rain"" and ""Up the Nails"" in slow,
    mournful rivulets, and his fluid, bouncy basswork on ""Total Exposure"" even
    out-meanders Pollard's melodic lines.  And yes, he's finally discovered that
    four-tracks record backwards as well as forwards.  ""The Cost of Shipping
    Cattle"" begins in a cacophony of reversed guitars, then sorts itself out into
    a gorgeous, softly swelling tune.</p><p>
    
    Considering the arena-rock aspirations Pollard has developed since his days
    in the old GBV, it's oddly appropriate that he almost sounds like an
    arena-rocker trying to go lo-fi here.  This means that some of the songs'
    quirks-- like the drunken shout-alongs in the otherwise pristine pop beauty
    of ""Circle of Trim""-- sound a bit artificial.  And along with its familiar
    veneer of reverb and British affectations, Pollard's croon seems even more
    over-the-top than ever in places, adding embellishments to the some of the
    nigh-infinitely repeated choruses and breaking into falsetto ta-ta-ta's on
    ""Feathering Clueless.""</p><p>
    
    But those are just the parts of the whole.  Even when separated by interstate
    commerce laws and the icy depths of Lake Michigan, Pollard and Sprout have
    the ability to sound like a band.  A real band.  In the space of this mostly
    noise-free record, Pollard and Sprout form their own feedback loop: Pollard's
    singing gives lift to Sprout's gently melancholy music, while Sprout gives
    weight to Pollard's abstracted exuberance.  This, combined with Pollard's
    recent discovery that it occasionally makes sense to make sense (if only just
    in the choruses) gives <i>Tower in the Fountain of Sparks</i> a sort of
    emotional weight rare for a GBV-related project.  As Sprout's acoustic
    guitars hum like a darkening summer night behind ""Total Exposure,"" Pollard
    couches his simplest, most comfortingly pedestrian imagery ever in a perfect
    melodic lilt: ""Listen to the way the children play/ As the day slips away/
    And the light comes on.""</p><p>
    
    Though the hard-rocking ""One More"" and the elliptical ""Mission Experiences""
    can be chalked up as the inevitable slight missteps, the album hits its
    stride halfway through.  ""Stifled Man Casino"" channels its frustration (""You
    can feel all the dust in your window/ You can feel all the lust in your mind/
    But you can't have what you want"") into upbeat, playful pop, while ""Up the
    Nails"" turns the same sentiment (""How can you believe/ That patience brings
    reward?"") into slow-burning sadness.  ""Tomorrow You May Rise"" sounds like one
    of GBV's random fragments turned strangely complete, thanks only to Sprout's
    well-placed synthesizer and another moment of lyrical lucidity (""Stand up
    crying, don't bend/ You are not lost in the present/ Tomorrow you may rise"").
    Elsewhere, ""Feathering Clueless"" provides more simple, slightly sad pop, and
    Sprout's slow, stately instrumentation on ""Mansfield in the Sky"" is almost
    impossibly gorgeous.</p><p>
    
    Towards the record's end, the haunting solo Sprout track, ""White Car Creek,""
    bleeds gracefully into the closer, ""Remain Lodging (At Airport 5)"".  Buoyed
    by effervescent treated pianos, Pollard preaches acceptance and stability,
    with a smirking allusion to relationship trouble (""It's hard to be a bird in
    a flying house/ It's how to be a drone/ In a hive of women"") that puts a warm
    spin on the album's melancholy bent.  It's indicative of how, even though
    they were just starting to make it big in music when their peers were making
    their final mortgage payments, Pollard and Sprout are still maturing. As if
    they could do something like this every day; wake up in the morning, grab a
    lunchbox, go their separate ways, and at the end of the day, climb back
    into the welcoming, familiar embrace of their four-tracks, where all will be
    right with the world.</p></div>"|82.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/82-tower-in-the-fountain-of-sparks/|8.0|Brendan Reid

    devil himself one dark night in the curved corners of Rem Koolhaas'
    Educatorium at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands.  On this night, the
    devil did not materialize in his traditional red spandex bodysuit, nor did
    he hold a pitchfork.  Instead, he came fat, balding, and wearing nothing but
    a white stuffed bunny over his groin area.  Ol' Scratch made a proposition:
    in exchange for Gane's soul, he would teach him to play the slide guitar like
    no man before him.  For an extra toe, the Dark Prince even threw in a vintage
    theremin.  It was there, in the gut of the building's cement swooshes and
    glass walls, that he and the devil struck a pact.  For the cost of eternal
    damnation, Tim Gane became the greatest Delta Kraut player in history.</p><p>
    In seedy Dutch mussel joints, ""Nine Toes Tim"" played, drank, fought, and
    eventually lost his life to a poisoned trappist ale left by a scorned lover.
    But not before cutting his legacy into the scratchy vinyl of records he
    recorded for a nickel a piece at Stereolab Studios-- nickels he drunkenly
    swore to put towards ""booze, minimalist furniture, and womens.""  At the time,
    ""race"" records, as they were unenlightenedly referred to,  became a hot
    commodity in European cities, and no race records were more popular than
    those German ones from the northern flatlands.</p><p>
    Now, decades later, after his original audiences have passed away (save for
    those few freaks of health), it is impossible to accurately judge Tim Gane's
    contemporary importance.  For a man so intoxicated by his own debauchery,
    Gane recorded an ungodly massive amount of music.  He surrounded himself with
    regular Stereolab session players such as Mary ""Big Baba"" Hansen and Laetitia
    ""Blind Marxist"" Sadier, who filled out the sounds with organs, chimes, vocals,
    vibes, beats, keys, and sundry other tweeting French instruments.  Oddly
    enough, despite his deal with Satan, Gane put his slide guitar to tape only
    once, on this record you hold now in your hands, <i>Sound-Dust</i>.  Restored
    from its original ""compact disc"" release, <i>Sound-Dust</i>, though it likely
    came late in Stereolab's existence, towers, however slightly, over a majority
    of Gane's oeuvre like the cartoon rampart on its cover.  Out of context and
    sequence, <i>Sound-Dust</i> remains a lasting testament to the spirit of the
    Delta Kraut.</p><p>
    Historians have linked Gane's music to the shadowy music of Delta Kraut
    originators Neu, a wandering duo who regularly played their hypnotic grooves
    up and down the Rhine for steamboating vacationers.  And in fact, Gane's
    critical contemporaries often dismissed his output as mere Neu mimicry.
    ""Jah, vhatevs, zey are just neu Neu,"" they would say, laughing at their
    own tepid humor.  But rocking in his Ikea tuuti chair on a brushed aluminum
    porch, the level-headed Gane would simply mutter in response, ""When you gots
    the kraut, you gots the kraut.  You don't play the kraut.  You <i>feels</i>
    the kraut.""  His dismissal from such criticism is just, as Neu! reissues
    illuminate.  Though Neu's rhythmic elements flow directly in to Stereolab's
    output, Stereolab album were far more detailed and lush affairs.  Inarguably,
    there are traces of their kraut forefathers on all Stereolab records, but
    they lie under twenty additional layers of piano, woodwinds, and harmonies.
    An animal certainly should not be compared to the fossilized skeleton of its
    predecessors.</p><p>
    Take the <i>Sound-Dust</i> tracks ""Gus the Mynah Bird"" and ""Nothing to Do
    with Me,"" songs which ostensibly motor on Neu fuel.  Melting horns, a lovely
    verbal indignation of military, space-out reverb flashes in the coda, and a
    slight hiccup and stutter in the beat go beyond the call of kraut's duty.
    Neu, and the rest of kraut's figures, never reached such absinthe-hazed detail.
    The ancient critics decried, ""Ach, they are still just Neu meeting the Beach
    Boys, Bacharach and Gainsbourg.""  There was some truth in this; ""Naught More
    Terrific Than Man"" undeniably lounges on the smooth brass, martini vibes, and
    latent sexuality of Bacharach and Gainsbourg, and drizzles the most demented
    moments of the Beach Boys.  However, those ingredients had never been baked
    together with such studious precision and Rhine Delta soul.  Gane devoted his
    life to Teutonic toots and trips and Frano fun when most other figures had
    either eroded away or moved on to music for the harbors of their primitive
    flying machines.</p><p>
    The trademark sounds of Stereolab-- incessant tintinnabulation, endless
    brittle grooves, decorative fluttering fluff, studio swirls, modulating bass,
    and flat, hiply disinterested female vocals-- drench <i>Sound-Dust</i>, but
    variety, timing, and focus sharpen the album, making this particular simmering
    stew more palatable than previous recordings.  The ingredients are not vastly
    different than the preceding <i>Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the
    Milky Night</i>, but that album seemed a befuddling galaxy of a mess due to
    its sequencing and timing, which centered around the plodding maw of the
    11\xBD-minute ""Blue Milk.""</p><p>
<i>Sound-Dust</i>, on the other hand, ebbs, shifts, dips and morphs just
    when it needs to, and at times, slight moments before you expect it to.  It
    contains <i>more</i> kinds of keyboarded instruments, and <i>more</i> kinds
    of xylophonic instruments, and <i>more</i> kinds of brass instruments, and
    <i>more</i> kinds of dizzying effects.  And on ""The Black Arts,"" in a rare
    moment of emotion, Laetitia Sadier's wunderbaritone vocals and lyrics actually
    become the crux.  That is, until chunky drums and cyclones of harpsichord
    spool the groove around her neck.</p><p>
    ""Space Moth"" rides the highway lines of bass into the horizon, but suddenly
    burps into the most tuneful pop-- modeled on an actual hook.  Yet, ""Captain
    EasyChord,"" <i>Sound-Dust</i>'s first single, dominates the album only three
    tracks in.  Gane's slide guitar slices through layers of plucks and bops with
    melodic acuity.  Here, Stereolab is the sweetheart of the kraut-rodeo, until
    the song unexpectedly skips into a <i>Gates of Dawn</i>-era Pink Floyd
    whistle-along.  Gane's slide-guitar briefly appears again in the PCP poi of
    ""Double Rocker.""  Simply dismiss it as lounge, and miss out on the rich,
    gentle mindmelt.</p><p>
    At their time of release, each Stereolab album was touted as ""the only one
    you really need.""  <i>Sound-Dust</i> stakes claim to this proclamation, but
    more importantly, proves that Stereolab indeed have two, maybe three albums
    you really need.  So go ahead.  If legend and Christian dogma hold true, Gane
    is burning in hell for this.</p></div>"|7494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7494-sound-dust/|7.4|Brent DiCrescenzo

The steady, firmly ingrained     progression of seconds, minutes, and hours breaks from its linear, unilateral     form to allow for drastic changes in magnitude and direction.  Hours can     slink by with no conscious recollection of the passage of time, and seemingly     infinite journeys can occur within the span of a few minutes.  Several     different things can exist in the same place at the same time, and within the     context of your dream, it always seems to make perfect sense.  You're never     surprised when you've traveled from one end of the earth to the other in a     couple of seconds-- the change in the nature of time alters not only your     surroundings, but your perception of them as well.</p>
<p>This, the self-titled debut from Olivia Tremor Control mastermind Will Cullen     Hart, is one of the few albums I've heard that can effectively blur the line     between real-world time and dream-world time. With its illusory, ethereal     production, wistful melodies, and oft-funereal pace, this is one of those     rare albums that can completely absorb you in such a way as to almost     dissolve the world around you, and make you feel like you've been transported     to another realm of existence within the course of 58 minutes.</p>
<p>While not an Olivia Tremor Control release by name, there are very few elements     here that will be unfamiliar to fans of the band. Aside from Bill Doss, just     about everyone who's ever contributed to an OTC release is present, making     for a grand total of 21 musicians involved in its making.  Given the sheer     volume of people contributing, and Cullen Hart's history with layering sound,     it's no surprise that <i>Circulatory System</i> is a sonically dense album.     But here, more than on any Olivia Tremor Control record, Cullen Hart displays     an almost supernatural talent for melding these sounds into a single entity     that is absolutely enveloping, and for shaping that entity around a powerful     melody. In some ways, the absence of Bill Doss seems to be a blessing, turning     the once-Olivia sound inward as Hart is left to explore his own lyrical and     sonic ruminations on time, death, and the nature of humanness.</p>
<p>Initially, <i>Circulatory System</i> sounds remarkably dark. Mournful     percussion, ambiguous and ominous noises, and minor chords galore conjure     vague, hazy images of death and sorrow. The upbeat, pop/rock of the Olivia     Tremor Control, showcased on songs like ""The Opera House"" from <i>Dusk at     Cubist Castle</i> and <i>Black Foliage</i>'s ""A New Day,"" has all but     evaporated. But in its place stands some of the most deeply reflective     psychedelic music ever laid to tape.</p>
<p>""Inside Blasts"" serves as perhaps a perfect archetype of Cullen Hart's new     direction. Opening with only accordion and his muffled voice, the song     gradually builds with stereo banjos, Dirty Three-style violins, and sparse     drumming. Fuzzed-out bass enters the fray, alongside eerie tones that could     best be described as what a music box might sound like if it were made out     of a coffin. Sounds are added so subtly that they almost become subliminal,     sinking deeply into the folds of your brain without necessarily registering     any kind of conscious reaction. And when a change is substantial enough to     make you take notice, its impact is greatly intensified by the minute     variations surrounding it.  A little more than halfway into ""Inside Blasts,""     many of the elements that have built up over the course of the song suddenly     cut out, as layers of vocal harmony and odd percussive noises are introduced.     It's a near-perfect sonic approximation of sadness and beauty, and without     question one of the album's best moments.</p>
<p>Another high point comes with ""Yesterday's World,"" the album's opener and     possibly its most direct, poppy track. Fuzzy guitars, layered horns, and     trashy tambourines back up one of the best melodies Cullen Hart has ever     penned. But even ""Yesterday's World"" has a strong undercurrent of     philosophical reflection and melancholy to it. As Cullen Hart questions,     ""Can we go back in time/ Can we bring, can we bring, can we bring these     days,"" the instruments backing him slowly fade out, leaving only his     increasingly uncertain-sounding voice.</p>
<p>Indeed, nagging uncertainty seems to be one of many thematic threads that     help make <i>Circulatory System</i> such a cohesive, affecting album. The     record's closer, ""Forever,"" consists only of the words, ""We will live forever     and you know it's true,"" sung in a disturbing, otherworldly melody by Cullen     Hart and Neutral Milk Hotel frontman Jeff Mangum, as well as a slew of others.     By far the most haunting moment on the album, ""Forever"" is the sound of a     campfire singalong of long-forgotten ghosts, lamenting the infinite loneliness     of eternal life.</p>
<p>As ""Forever"" fades out, reality slowly begins to creep back in. The sounds,     words, and voices on <i>Circulatory System</i> linger as a memory, but not     as a memory of an album. Bits and pieces of melodies refuse to leave you, and     you find yourself listening to the record over and over again to see if the     vaporous melodies are real, or just figments of your imagination. You listen     seeking comfort, but find only more depth in the album's uncertainty. Like a     dream, you can never shake the feeling that your memory of <i>Circulatory     System</i> is never quite the same as the original.  Unlike a dream, you can     revisit that original as many times as you wish.</p></div>"|1478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1478-circulatory-system/|9.5|Matt LeMay

    rock has a place in their heart for Pavement.  Go to any ID show at your
    local music venue, mention the band's revered name to a stranger, and make a
    friend for life.  But ask virtually any 16-year-old indie newcomer about
    Pavement's impact on their lives and record collections, and reach the bitter
    realization that what was once so fresh and utterly indispensable now merely
    passes with an ""eh.""  The kids are never quick to dismiss Pavement, as the
    band is, and likely always will be, heralded among the founding fathers of
    independent rock as we know it.  But somehow, the magic that once made them
    so vital and potent has faded with age, and just doesn't seem quite as
    relevant in these high-powered times as it did ten years ago.</p><p>
    When Pavement came along with <i>Slanted and Enchanted</i> in 1991, it seemed
    a revelation: so vastly different from anything before it, and so clearly
    prescient of everything that would come after.  Stephen Malkmus' lazy,
    pitch-imperfect California drawlin', Spiral Stairs' shredded
    almost-guitar-playing, and the album's seemingly unfinished half-songs
    encapsulated the slacker ethos of the time with the hyperactive, restless
    energy that only hits after long bouts with boredom.  Pavement's
    stream-of-consciousness lyrics and one-take anthems achieved genius through
    apathy.  And in a time when apathy seemed the only option in life, no one
    said everything by saying nothing at all like those bored Stocktonites.</p><p>
    These days, the kids have ambition, and rightfully so.  America's flush with
    cash and prizes, and for once, there's actual opportunity.  In this age, when
    kids come barreling out of high school with enough computer experience to
    put Nolan Bushnell to shame, indifference would simply be retarded.  And
    the current climate of independent music reflects that with bands like Sigur
    Rós, Godspeed You Black Emperor and Mogwai who, while all somewhat dreary at
    times, seem driven by an intense passion to be the best at what they do.  Yes,
    time advances for everyone, it seems.  Everyone except Scott Kannberg.</p><p>
    Despite Pavement's demise, Kannberg still hangs on tightly to his Spiral
    Stairs alias, a name which seems an inside joke so closely affiliated with
    Pavement that it's hard to see how it could exist outside the band.  Even
    the name of the new group he's formed with members of the Moore Brothers
    (a duo who finds their home on his Amazing Grease label), the Preston School
    of Industry, is a waning reference to an early Pavement song.  It's also
    undoubtedly another inside joke between Pavement members, as the actual
    Preston School is a detention and re-education center for juvenile delinquents
    in Ione, California, just over 40 miles from Pavement's hometown.</p><p>
    The music on the Preston School of Industry's debut album, <i>All This Sounds
    Gas</i>, revels in early 90s alterna-rock, a sound so exhausted it now sounds
    at least as generic as its equally banal predecessor, freedom rock.  The only
    thing separating the Preston School from the Gin Blossoms is their well-worn
    Pavement edge.  Even so, Pavement's rough-hewn absurdities have been blent
    with more conventional pop structures by bedroom wannabes for the past decade;
    the fact that the Preston School is fronted by an ex-member of the band
    doesn't make their music any less of a mimicry.</p><p>
    Three of the album's tracks were written by Kannberg during the sessions for
    Pavement's swan-song, 1999's <i>Terror Twilight</i>, including the record's
    lead-off, ""Whalebones,"" which starts the album off nicely with the kind of
    lazy, repetition-based melody that should sound familiar to any Pavement
    addict.  But while a pleasant listen, all of the youthful exuberance
    Kannberg displayed on his Pavement tracks-- even ones as late as <i>Brighten
    the Corners</i>' ""Date w/IKEA""-- has totally evaporated, and where the song
    should burst into a fiery distortion overdrive, it's content to meander on
    and peter out with no sign of actual effort.  ""The Idea of Fires"" and
    the seven-minute long ""Encyclopedic Knowledge of,"" both also written in the
    <i>Terror Twilight</i> days, never seem to gain direction or rise above
    I-could-do-that mediocrity.</p><p>
    While these three tracks seem passable at best, they're never downright
    offensive.  But the uninspired country twang of ""A Treasure @ Silver Bank
    (This Dynasty's for Real)"" crosses that line.  Senseless lyrics like, ""It's
    a polyester bright day now/ And the dinosaurs are for real,"" and, ""50 minutes
    till the muses needs/ Put you out to the trees,"" just sound so fucking
    <i>wrong</i> against the vagabond Travis Tritt backdrop.  And a half-hour
    later, the album closes at its worst with the neverending ""Take a Stand,"" a
    pale <i>Soft Bulletin</i> imitation whose hackneyed, off-kilter beat stumbles
    awkwardly underneath 11,000 layers of acoustic guitar and a chorus of inept
    la-la-la's before the song closes with a voice proclaiming it ""a brilliant
    rock odyssey.""</p><p>
<i>All This Sounds Gas</i> might not have been such a weak effort if Kannberg's
    lyrics actually had anything to say, but nonsense prose has never meshed
    well with jangly, country-inflected pop.  The album also might have improved,
    however slightly, if they'd left off the embarrassing quasi-experimental
    keyboard jam, ""Blü Sön,"" a 44-second excursion to Planet Shame that makes
    the Byrds' ""Moog Raga"" seem like a monolith of pulsing electronic genius.
    But, of course, they didn't, leaving <i>All This Sounds Gas</i> to languish
    in future obscurity as yet another post-legendary project that fails to live
    up to its frontman's glory days.  Unfortunate.</p></div>"|6462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6462-all-this-sounds-gas/|5.3|Ryan Schreiber

    more than once a day.  Sure, to make these review deadlines, I often have to
    listen to a record daily, but in so many cases, it's a chore. That's not
    a problem with <i>White Blood Cells</i>. In fact, the problem now is finding
    time for the next album to review; all I want to do is listen to the White
    Stripes. I've got it taped for my walkman in the classic cassette format--
    it fits easily onto Side A of my 90-minute Maxell. I keep wasting precious
    battery power fast-forwarding through Side B so I can get back to <i>White
    Blood Cells</i>.</p><p>
    
    I love the rock and roll.  There's always someone new coming along, taking
    that heavily rooted sound-- the music of the Gods-- and making the old beast
    sing anew. It's Christ and Prometheus, eternally dying and rising again.
    Jack and Meg White summon the Holy Spirit and channel it through 16 perfectly
    concise songs of longing, with dirty, distorted electric guitar cranked to
    maximum amplification, crashing, bruised drums, and little else. They don't
    innovate rock; they embody it.  And whatever past form of the genre <i>White
    Blood Cells</i> invokes has been given a makeover and set loose to strut the
    lower east side's back alleys in its new clothes. Red and white clothes.
    (The Stripes could stand to vary the color schemes of their album covers.)</p><p>
    
    There's no denying that the White Stripes fall within the confines of the
    garage rock band.  Their music is simple, stripped down and it howls the
    blues.  But despite its simplicity, there's something here that goes so much
    deeper.  Jack White's mangled guitar screams like a rabid catfight, its
    strings massacred to the point of snapping.  Meg White's kit is bashed with
    such force you'd imagine her as some kind of incredible hulk, though in
    photos, she appears the prototypical indie girl-- waifish, with pigtails and
    a nasty smirk.  Yet she whips all of her 98 pounds into a tornadic fury like
    E. Honda's hundred-hand slap.</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, Jack tosses an organ into the mix, or bangs on a piano like the
    Stones' Ian Stewart.  But for the most part, <i>White Blood Cells</i> is
    instrumentally sparse, with only a guitar and drums.  The last time I recall
    such a dense sound being wrung from rock's bare essentials was on Liz Phair's
    similarly Stones-inspired <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, though this record
    explores much raunchier sonic textures; rather than Phair's restrained but
    biting wit, Jack White opts to lay it all on the line, the unfiltered cynicism
    of an intelligent mind sent blaring through 1000 Hz of raw aggression.</p><p>
<i>White Blood Cells</i> surges with classic rock's grittier moments, stomping
    around like the MC5 and, on the instrumental ""Aluminum,"" Sabbath.  The guitar
    echoes the second half of Neil Young's <i>Rust Never Sleeps</i>.  But Jack's
    vocals are pure indie rock-- bratty and unashamedly so-- and in his upper
    register, his voice yowls and cracks with pissed adolescence.</p><p>
    
    Virtually all of these songs address a distanced lover. Sometimes he's coming
    home to see her; other times she's done him some permanent wrong.  The
    lyrics are succinct and direct, and poetic like an aged bluesman.  On ""Dead
    Leaves and the Dirty Ground,"" he sings: ""If you can hear a piano fall, you
    can hear me coming down the hall/ If I could just hear your pretty voice,
    I don't think I'd need to see at all.""  He concludes the song with, ""Any man
    with a microphone can tell you what he loves the most/ And you know why you
    love at all if you're thinking of the Holy Ghost.""</p><p>
    
    On the country hootenanny ""Hotel Yorba,"" the Stripes reflect the grit of
    early Railroad Jerk-- a glee-filled boogie with Jack's voice breaking and
    whooping, almost on the verge of a yodel. ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" is
    frenzied and rollicking (the album's best), complete with Yardbirds-type
    ""ahhaa's"" and a <i>joi de vivre</i> tempered by the admission that trouble
    is sure to follow: ""My left brain knows that all love is fleeting.""</p><p>
    
    Indeed, many of the songs admit that the love is lost. On ""The Union Forever,""
    Jack White mourns, ""It can't be love/ Because there is no love.""  The song is
    a riff on <i>Citizen Kane</i>, including a strange breakdown with sampled
    dialogue from the film.  Here, the White Stripes are the most experimental
    they get, which is to say ""not very,"" though the song reminds me of the ragged
    power of Royal Trux without the pointless artiness.  Certainly, it would be
    nice to hear the White Stripes take this music in a new direction, but this
    band is all about the songs, and the songs are good enough to stand alone,
    sans-flashy effects and tape editing.</p><p>
    
    ""The Same Boy You've Always Known"" is another high point.  For a ballad, it
    rocks harder than most bands' hard-rockers, yet it wrenches in its emotional
    impact.  Jack White repeats certain key lines, straining his voice to impart
    meaning and feeling.  Again, the state of the relationship in question is
    uncertain.  The song ends uncommitted and terribly sad with, ""If there's
    anything good about me/ I'm the only one who knows."" How many bands have
    failed with entire albums of moroseness to only express the alienation of
    those two lines?</p><p>
    
    The closest thing to a dud on this record is ""We're Going to Be Friends,"" a
    gentle, nostalgic ditty of innocent love and childhood.  It's a little too
    pleasant, lacking any of the fear and confusion of those pre-double-digit
    years, but its softness gives the record's midpoint some time to inhale
    before another six exhalations of fire.</p><p>
    
    Finally, at the close of the album, Jack sits alone at the piano for ""This
    Protector.""  Though its message is vague, there are implications of religion
    and loss: ""You thought you heard a sound/ There's no one else around/ 300
    people out in West Virginia/ Have no idea of all these thoughts that lie
    within you/ But now... now... now, now, now, NOW!""  Now what?  It's the
    floating resonance of the moment, the intensity of the feeling, that gives
    these words meaning.</p><p>
<i>White Blood Cells</i> doesn't veer far from the formula of past White
    Stripes records; all are tense, sparse and jagged.  But it's here that they've
    finally come into their own, where Jack and Meg White finally seem not only
    comfortable with the path they've chosen, but practiced, precise and able to
    convey the deepest sentiment in a single bound.  It's hard to know at this
    point in the game where they'll head from here, but what matters is right now.
    And right now, I want to listen to this album again.</p></div>"|8651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8651-white-blood-cells/|9.0|Dan Kilian & Ryan Schreiber

    There. Now we can conduct our serious record criticism like adults. After
    all, upon hearing <i>Gizmodgery</i> a few times, I've come to the conclusion
    that Self (aka Matt Mahaffey) could have ditched the schtick and recorded
    this, his fourth release, with a couple guitars, a few synthesizers, a drumkit
    and a decent sampler for all I care. Besides, now that we know what he was
    going for, we might as well realize that Mahaffey's only trying to distract
    you from the fact that not much else separates this record from the rest of
    the pack.</p><p>
    
    There's nothing that screams ""unique"" about this music. In fact, it could be
    pigeonholed into the mundane category of ""quirky pop,"" or at best, into one
    of quirky pop's vague subdivisions. And I defy you to listen to this record
    without being reminded of other artists. I know I couldn't. At the start of
    each new song, I'd add another artist to my mental Artists Self Has Been
    Influenced By list. You can see how that might serve as a distraction. He
    covers ""What a Fool Believes,"" for Christ's sake, and without even bringing
    anything interesting to it.  What's the point?</p><p>
    
    Okay, one more thing, and then we can get to the good part of the record.
    Mahaffey's love of noise and clutter seems to act as an excuse for running
    low on decent ideas.  Clear examples lie in the intro to ""5 Alive"" and the
    entire following song, ""Chameleon."" In the case of the latter, Matt offers
    a booming drum loop and some distorted noises, along with a repetitive,
    nonsensical vocal line. The only break in the song is the bridge, which
    features a sample of some drunk guy yammering.  Only melody-- or silence--
    would have provided sufficient relief.</p><p>
<i>Gizmodgery</i>'s strong point comes when Mahaffey starts actually having
    fun. The album's kickoff, ""I Am a Little Explosion,"" is a perfect introduction;
    it's one of the strongest tracks, exuding the kind of childish, exuberant
    energy that one might expect from a toy-lover. ""Dead Man"" is a marvelous slice
    of power pop, trading off programmed beats and a synthesized harpsichord
    progression with a Rentals-esque, power-chord-laden chorus. ""Ordinaire"" kicks
    new wave ass, recalling Devo with alarm sounds, wacky guitar lines, and
    caffeine-fueled hyperactivity.  And ""Miracleworker"" gives me the perfect
    chance to make the obligatory Beck comparison (and by Beck, I'm talking about
    <i>Odelay</i>-era Beck), which, in this case, ain't so much a bad thing.</p><p>
    
    But the highlight of the album is ""Trunk Fulla Amps,"" which has been clearly
    designated as a single (yeah, wishful thinking, fella) with the inclusion of
    a radio edit after the final track. The gist of the song: ""Got a trunk fulla
    amps, motherfucker,"" ad infinitum. But while that may seem weak in print, he
    sings it with an infectious glee unrivaled by the rest of the record.  Verse
    by verse, Mahaffey trades off emulating his heroes (Queen, ELO... Danzig?), a
    sign of his wry sense of humor finally working to his advantage. And the
    instrumental bridge is simply beautiful, an unexpected but somehow perfect
    transition into a smooth Brazilian-flavored interlude on subtly rhythmic
    guitar and an uptempo bossanova beat.</p><p>
    
    Mahaffey has never made a cohesive record. Clearly, though, like all his past
    efforts, the potential to craft a strong pop song around a catchy hook is
    there, and it shines through the mediocrity. If only he were more selective
    in his album-crafting process, then perhaps we'd have a Self record we could
    thoroughly enjoy. It might take a little longer, but hell, I'd wait.</p></div>"|7067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7067-gizmodgery/|6.9|Spencer Owen

    Hi-Fi?  Something you can connect to on an emotional level that won't sacrifice
    that mindless accessibility you've been force-fed all your life?  You liked the
    new Weezer album, didn't you?  Well, this is like that, but <i>better!</i>  Never will
    Jimmy Eat World venture into ""too much information"" territory like that
    Rivers what's-his-name and his ""Hash Pipe.""  You want love, happiness and
    ""whoa's.""  You want to cruise around the housing development with the windows
    down, doing donuts in the cul-de-sac with your newly obtained permit, blasting
    music so empty and sincere even <i>you</i> could have written it.</p><p>
    
    You're getting to the age now when you're bored a lot.  You're angry.  You're
    frustrated with it all.  All of it!  You hate it!  You hate this life, you
    hate your friends, you hate yourself.  Why can't it just be fun, like when
    you were a kid?  Something needs to speak to you, but not speak really hard
    or anything like that.  After all, you weren't put on this earth to think!
    Well, Jimmy Eat World are there for you.  They don't think, either!</p><p>
    
    These guys are the best friends you can imagine.  They know what you're going
    through, and they care.  They care like a million hearts wrapped up inside a
    teddy bear holding a bouquet of understanding in one hand and an undying
    torch of reassurance in the other.  They keep the flame of rock alive while
    giving you advice about the most important thing in your world: yourself.</p><p>
    
    Their new album, <i>Bleed American</i>, is the best at that.  Lead singer
    Jim Adkins reels off lyric after insightful lyric, facing you with tough
    questions like, ""Are you gonna live your life wonderin' standing in the back
    lookin' around?"" and ""Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown
    up or how you missed out?""  Serious words, my friend.  You better consider
    what this guy is saying, 'cause you ""gotta make a move or you'll miss out.""
    He's right!  If you don't make a move, whatever that might be, you'll miss
    out on whatever you might miss out on, and that could be anything!  You don't
    want to miss out, do you?</p><p>
    
    The best thing about <i>Bleed American</i> is that all of the songs sing
    directly to you.  These guys don't fuck around with any of that storytelling,
    third-person bullshit.  You are misunderstood, goddamnit, and when your
    friends aren't there for you, Jimmy Adkins always will be, rockin' out while
    lifting your self-esteem: ""Hey, don't write yourself off yet,"" he sings on
    ""The Middle.""  ""It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked
    down on/ Just try your best/ Try everything you can/ And don't you worry
    what they tell themselves/ When you're away.""  I'm seriously gonna cry!
    That really hits home.</p><p>
    
    And the music.  Whoa.  Don't even get me started!  These songs will never
    test you or judge you.  Every song is as straight-on as you can get, filled
    with the power of distorted, chugging guitars, pummeling 4/4 drums, and bass
    playing so precise it could be programmed.  There are no fancy production
    tricks or effects, just four chords of awesome pop music.  Plus, their
    acronym is JEW.  That's funny!</p><p>
    
    But Jimmy Eat World don't rock all the way through <i>Bleed American</i>.
    They know exactly when to slow it down for that heart-wrenching, sentimental
    ballad: track six!  ""Hear You Me"" is the song you'll cry yourself to sleep
    with when you get a B+ on your science paper, or your girlfriend tells you
    she ""needs some space.""  The song is really about the death of a friend, so
    it will help the tears come when you need them most.  Adkins quietly intones
    the saddest words ever put to paper: ""And if you were with me tonight/ I'd
    sing to you just one more time/ A song for a heart so big/ God wouldn't let
    it live.""  Now I really <i>am</i> gonna cry!</p><p>
    
    Yes, it's definitely time to grow up.  Rites of passage are coming, if they
    haven't already-- sex, heartbreak, the loss of everything you own in a
    housefire, birth defects, and genocide... or at least things that seem that
    big!  So do the best you can, listen to your favorite band, bury your head
    in the sand, before it all begins again.  Hey, I just wrote a Jimmy Eat
    World song!</p></div>"|4261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4261-bleed-american/|3.5|Ryan Schreiber

Oh.  And ladies, too-- it's nice to see some of you finally joining
    our ranks.  But let's get down to business.  For months on end now, people have
    been spinning wild, implausible rumors about our as-yet-unreleased and
    super-top-secret product, codenamed ""Ginger.""  There are rumors that it's some
    sort of nuclear-powered scooter, which, if you care to take a look at the plans,
    you'll see is clearly off-base.  And General Mills and Sony, you can rest assured
    that we're not ""horning in"" on your Taste-o-Vision project.  No, I'm afraid none
    of the above-- all exciting and ahead-of-their-time concepts, mind you, that we
    at Troubleman Unlimited would be interested in developing, given the proper
    economic backing-- are Ginger.  But we like to think that the real Ginger is
    just as futuristic and vital to consumer needs as any of those products.</p><p>
    
    Ahh.  I'm getting ahead of myself.  You all came here with one question
    smoldering in your skulls: ""What, essentially, is this exciting new Ginger
    product, and how can I get my hands on one?"" Well, I'll tell you.</p><p>
    
    Ginger is-- well, Ginger is, umm... a hardcore album.  Shocking, isn't it?!
    Daring, eh?  A group of three terribly bright young kids calling themselves
    American Heritage (and I just can't tell you how refreshing it is to see the
    youth expressing an interest in their country) developed the album for us,
    which, because of the horribly unwieldy title they gave it, was redesignated
    by our PR department as ""Ginger.""  Now, I know some of you are saying, ""Wait
    a minute-- I already own a hardcore album.  Maybe even more than one hardcore
    album!  Why do I need Ginger?""  You don't know the half of it.  Let's take
    her for a ""test drive,"" as it were.</p><p>
    
    First, check out the vocals.  Hear any?  Well, disregard that first track, where
    a computerized voice recites some rather ""lowbrow"" jokes aimed at the band
    members to the tune of ""God Save the Queen""-- just our boys' way of making the
    product a bit more ""user-friendly"" (though we think we'll have to ax that feature
    in the final version, as the unintelligible voice makes the humor a bit unfunny,
    as they say).  But otherwise, no singing!  The future, I say!  Have you ever
    listened to ""techno"" music, the kind they make on computers?  Not much singing
    there, either!  Trust me: ten years from now, people will be singing up to 75%
    less than they do today!  Plus-- and be honest with yourself here-- you've never
    really ""dug"" that hardcore singing style.  Those guys sound like they're crazy!
    And all that screaming distracts from the natural beauty of the music.  Am I
    right?  Well, with Ginger, you don't have to deal with that junk anymore!</p><p>
    
    Now, I know that when you listen to new-school hardcore, you think, ""Sure, there
    are lots of tempo and time changes.  But darn it all, I want more!""  Well, now,
    cool down for a second.  Just take a listen to Ginger.  See?  You can go for
    minutes without hearing a multiple of four!  Ginger can handle the most arcane
    time signatures imaginable.  In fact, that's almost all it does!  And if you're
    getting bored with that 9/4 rhythm, don't worry; it's sure to change in a few
    seconds.</p><p>
    
    I'm sure you're all wondering how our boys at American Heritage managed this.
    Well, they've got a secret, and it's something so brilliant I can't believe no
    one's ever tried it before.  You see, Ginger almost never establishes a solid
    beat!  That's right, it's nearly incapable!  Even at slower tempos, they just
    can't do it.  Listen to how they just kind of trail off at the end of about half
    of the measures.  Genius!  I know questions have been raised about why this
    doesn't make all of those time changes moot, and those are excellent questions
    that I will, in fact, address at some point in the distant future.</p><p>
    
    Allow me to digress for a second to tell you a bit more about our American
    Heritage team.  These kids sure know how to play their instruments, and a few of
    the individual sections of these songs are quite nice, but that's not where their
    true genius lies.  See, they're up on the market research.  They know that
    consumers today don't really want convenience, ease of use, or any of that
    malarkey; they want frustration without reward!  For all of those who thought
    Ginger would be some great boon to mankind-- well, joke's on you, folks.
    American Heritage personally guarantees that none of the transitions between the
    parts that comprise Ginger will be interesting or inspired, just emptily
    hyperactive.  This might appeal to those interested in instrumental wankery, but
    that's an entirely different demographic.  American Heritage have applied this
    design ethos to the packaging as well-- you say having eight tracks on the CD
    but only six listed on the case would piss you off?  Well, from what the guys
    tell us, you'll be pissed off and you'll like it!</p><p>
    
    And just as an added bonus, American Heritage threw in one of those techno songs
    you've been hearing so much about.  And do these kids know their way around a
    keyboard!  Listen to all of those bleeps and bloops!  Just like playing Nintendo!
    I'm sure that after all you've heard, you're ready to lay down a few hard-earned
    dollars for the privilege of owning one of the first Gingers off the line, and
    I'll be taking orders and down-payments right after your questions.  Yes, you
    with the mohawk and the switchblade?</p></div>"|161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/161-through-the-age-of-quarrel-and-into-the-era-of-putting-up-with-it/|4.4|Brendan Reid

    way.  For centuries, Christian mortals were more than happy to indulge His
    sensibilities, producing only music that was for or about God, and designed
    entirely to win His favor. If you were a musician back in 1503, it was almost
    certain that you worked for the church, writing polyphonic masses and putting
    melodies to psalms.  There was no music but God Music.</p><p>
    But, beginning in the Renaissance, newly educated people began to tire of God
    this and God that.  The wealthy bourgeois class and self-important royalty
    began to want music for the sole purpose of entertainment, and paid handsomely
    to have it composed.  Next thing you knew, musicians were developing theories
    of harmony and Monteverdi was writing operas based on old folk tales.</p><p>
    A few Steven Fosters and a couple Oscar Wildes later, we had the concept of
    pop entertainment for its own sake, served direct to the masses.  Given the
    tendency toward opportunism and exploitation of the pop world, it seems that
    there's little room left for God Music today, and when someone tries to make
    some these days you get stuff like Creed, the Newsboys and DC Talk.</p><p>
    Still, God Music seeps out of the woodwork in ways you might not expect in
    this modern age, be it in the devotionals sung in Baptist churches or the
    less obvious songs of Marc Anthony Thompson.  Thompson has quite the rapport
    going with God, though the only altar he seems to kneel before is the
    porcelain one.  And, man, does he kneel there often.  Thompson's second album
    as Chocolate Genius (his fourth overall) finds him up to the old tricks that
    made his past efforts so engrossing-- getting drunk, feeling hung over, and
    going mano á mano with God, questioning, accusing, and philosophizing.</p><p>
    Before launching into a dissonant guitar solo in ""The Eyes of the Lord,""
    Thompson sings, ""There's no peace/ In the name of the Lord/ If I feel high/
    He is there to remind me/ That I can't get up/ There is no joy/ In the eyes
    of the Lord,"" in a tired, gravel-scraped baritone over a smoky R&amp;B; backdrop.
    And there are plenty more drunken epiphanies where that came from.  Thompson's
    last effort, the phenomenal <i>Black Music</i>, found transcendence in his
    unflattering self-portraits, and his bleak confessional style is still in
    full effect.  The only problem is that the songs aren't as good as they
    were the last time around.</p><p>
    There's nothing here as stunning as ""My Mom"" or ""Hangover Nine,"" moments that
    made <i>Black Music</i> so devastating.  Instead, he spreads his gutter poetry
    across a bed of low-key grooves, odd synths and shifting textures.  Though
    this approach provides for some wonderful moments, it ultimately fails in
    allowing each song to exist in its own space as a fully developed piece.</p><p>
<i>Godmusic</i> opens with a bizarre, seemingly drunken quasi-operatic piece
    called ""Perfidia"" before quickly moving on to the first actual song, ""For One
    More Look at You.""  ""For One More Look at You"" begins so subtly you might not
    even notice that it's started, and the whole record continues from there,
    with the continuous mix providing a lot of those nagging ""is this a new song?""
    moments that send you reaching for the tracklist.</p><p>
    Certain tracks do manage to stand out, though.  ""Love,"" with its lilting
    female backing vocals and catchy hook could easily be a single, leaning
    heavily on modern R&amp;B; for its inspiration.  The band, rounded out with guys
    like Chris Wood, Abe Laboriel Jr., and Marc Ribot, is expertly subdued,
    allowing Thompson to build tension before letting it out in the chorus.
    ""Bossman Piss (In My Lemonade)"" is similarly restrained, quietly building to
    an effervescent chorus full of close harmonies, and then simmering back down
    for subsequent verses, where Thompson delivers lines like, ""A hole is just a
    hole/ Unless you've got a shovel and you're bored.""</p><p>
    The instrumental title track brings things to a crashing close with wailing
    harmonica and martial rhythms, as all sorts of agitated guitars and synths
    buzz underneath.  I think God might like this if He got his hands on it,
    regardless of whether or not it's about Him.  I mean, even omnipotent beings
    have to rock out now and then.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, there are nice moments, like the pretty woodwind arrangement on
    ""Infidel Blues,"" which stand out, but the songs largely slip by, lost in the
    too-subtle production.  The album as a whole feels cohesive and works well as
    a single piece, but there's not a whole lot to draw you in and make you want
    to stay there.  On <i>Black Music</i>, Thompson was able to create a world in
    your head through description and inflection, but here he sits you in a
    musical environment that doesn't suggest much in the way of imagery.</p><p>
    If anything, music dealing with God is likely to become ever rarer in the
    future, and it's nice to have a guy around like Thompson who isn't afraid to
    vent his feelings on the subject, all while providing darkly confessional
    odes to imbibing and watching your life fall apart.  But in the end, it's
    best to wait until you've tried <i>Black Music</i> before you head for the
    <i>Godmusic</i>.</p></div>"|1451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1451-godmusic/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    instantly identifiable sound with the most basic of musical tools. What the
    American Analog Set has accomplished to date has been a neat trick of sonic
    alchemy; with a bare minimum of sonic gimmicks-- calmly plucked guitar, mildly
    buzzy keyboard, muffled drums, hushed vocals-- they concoct a warm, pure sound
    whose closest relative may be Yo La Tengo in their less noisy moments.  Like
    YLT, the American Analog Set knows how to let a song slowly unfold itself without
    testing the patience of its listeners, moving through each measure of their music
    with quiet, sure-footed confidence.</p><p>
    
    The band's simpler/gentler ethos is in full effect on <i>Through the 90s</i>,
    an obligatory housecleaning of b-sides, unreleased alternate versions, and
    live tracks that always pops up when a band switches labels.  (Having spent
    several years on Emperor Jones, the band will be releasing their upcoming
    full-length on Tiger Style.) It's a testament to the American Analog Set's
    songwriting consistency that <i>Through the 90s</i> could easily pass as a
    proper album; however, where the band's previous releases have been exquisitely
    crafted so that the tracks flow effortlessly together, the primary virtue of
    this one is its subtle variety. Old tracks contrast just enough with newer ones
    so that their differences can be appreciated without the transitions between
    them being too jarring.</p><p>
    
    Among the more interesting artifacts is ""High Fidelity vs. Guy Fidelity,"" one of
    the first songs the guys ever wrote; it bears a strong resemblance to Mogwai's
    more recent work of deliberate, clean guitars set against washes of keyboard
    noise. Amusingly, an ad jingle the band wrote for their collective favorite soft
    drink, Dr. Pepper, is also included; according to the brief, wry liner notes,
    the jingle was rejected, so the band developed it into the full-length ""The
    Wait,"" which appeared on their 1999 album, <i>The Golden Band</i>. There's also
    a chilled-out remix of ""Don't Wake Me,"" which casts the band in a favorable Darla
    Records-esque light, all soft-touch breakbeats and plinky electronics.</p><p>
    
    The latter half of the album is a little less exciting. Alternate versions of
    album tracks such as ""Magnificent Seventies"" from 1997's <i>From Our Living Room
    to Yours</i> and ""It's All About Us"" from <i>The Golden Band, aren't alternate
    enough to be made too distinctive from their originals. The pair of extended live
    tracks that close the album show the band to be a smooth live act, but there's
    something unsettling about hearing their music played through a filter of ambient
    crowd noise. The American Analog Set isn't a band to experience collectively;
    they make the kind of music you want to hear in your own head, and while the
    presence of the crowd never overwhelms the band, it's still an unwelcome
    intrusion into that little musical world you create for yourself.</i></p><p>
    
    Despite the fact that it seems a little excessive for a band who's only released
    three albums to put out an odds-and-sods collection, <i>Through the 90s</i>,
    like every American Analog Set release to date, is a soothing, rewarding listen.
    It's not only a recommended purchase for longtime fans, but for newcomers as well,
    as its grab-bag nature captures many different nuances of the band's sound, both
    past and present.</p></div>"|155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/155-through-the-90s-singles-and-unreleased/|6.7|Nick Mirov

    PREPARED FOR... <i>THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!!!!!</i></p><p>
    
    Or so might the tagline for a Mike Patton biopic run.  But really, have we <i>ever</i>
    been prepared?  Since Patton permanently shoved Faith No More off the deep
    end by taking the vocal reigns just in time for their hit-making <i>The Real
    Thing</i> album, he's refused to stay fixed in the limelight, opting instead
    to focus on more serious work with his pre-FNM band, the highly experimental
    Mr. Bungle.  And, when not hanging out with John Zorn (having lighthearted
    chats about Japanese death-porn, presumably), he makes solo records.</p><p>
    
    Mr. Bungle most recent release, 1999's <i>California</i>, had me wondering
    whether Patton was finally running out of the disturbing energy that had
    powered the rest of his work.  While still not quite sunny, <i>California</i>
    showed a mellower, more pop-structured side of Patton, and the imperative
    force that usually solders together his stylistic mishmashes wasn't quite
    there.</p><p>
    
    Enter Fantomas.  Taking their name from the psychopathic anti-hero of a
    series of French thriller novels, the band seems tailor-made to give vent to
    Patton's dark side, setting Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Melvins guitarist
    Buzz Osborne alongside Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn.  Though fitting a single
    style to the band is difficult, <i>The Director's Cut</i>, Fantomas' second
    full-length, takes aim at a very narrow genre: film music (particularly those
    creepy Theremin-tastic horror movie themes).</p><p>
    
    But wait, wait.  Film music?  Ideally, a movie soundtrack is just background,
    enhancing but never overpowering what's happening on the screen.  Patton
    couldn't provide background music for Hiroshima.  But, for a second, as a
    lonely, reedy reproduction of one of the motifs from <i>The Godfather</i>
    slowly curls out of the speakers, it seems like Fantomas are actually going
    the unobtrusive route.  Then, the bullets hit: the band immediately kicks
    into Level 12 Spaz Mode, Patton's stutters and hillbilly war-whoops
    punctuating a buzzsaw speed-metal attack.  And just as suddenly, the
    Mediterranean theme returns (this time floating along on gentle percussion,
    strings, and an odd, mewling vocal line) only to veer off into few bars of
    operatic thrash.</p><p>
    
    So, a few liberties have been taken.  That's okay.  <i>The Director's Cut</i>
    is as cinematic as its source material, without bearing much resemblance at
    all to the type of music normally pegged as ""cinematic"" (or the source
    material, really).  Both obsessively detailed and brutally frenetic,
    Fantomas' adaptations translate moving images into disconcertingly vivid
    music.  ""One Step Beyond,"" for instance, shifts in its skin like Lon Chaney
    under a full moon, moving from stock horror movie effects to resonant
    whistles and strings.  Lombardo enters with a jackhammer snare roll, and
    Patton's high, keening vocals transform into coyote-caught-in-an-electric-fence
    howls.  Metamorphosis complete, the song prowls off on it own, punctuated by
    ethereal orchestra hits and cartoonish throat-bending vocal effects.</p><p>
    
    Lombardo, Osborne, and Dunn all provide expert accompaniment, but it's
    Patton's utterly unique vocals that make Fantomas distinct.  On the theme
    from <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, one of the album's best tracks, Patton juggles
    an uncanny little-girl lisp with a hoarse lullaby tone and a searing screech,
    above an unnerving mixture of string scrapes and toy percussion.  The more
    playful, almost self-indulgently cheesy ""Spider Baby"" finds Patton handling
    both the growling lyrics and the sky-high spy-theme falsettos.</p><p>
    
    The underlying concept, coupled with the consistently sinister tone it brings
    to the album, gives a weird sort of logic to Patton's stylistic leaps that
    he's never quite captured before.  The fuzzy, chaotic interruptions in the
    melody of Ennio Morricone's ""Investigation of a Citizen Beyond Suspicion""
    lead gradually to the song's grandiose, paranoid midsection (""Every piece of
    skin/ Every mouth you've fed/ Every word you've said/ Every drop you've bled"").
    A slow dripping sound breaks the tension and brings back the melody, just
    for it to be suddenly shattered again by a jabbering metal freakout.  The
    progression is almost narrative, maybe tracing a mental breakdown, but like
    a good horror movie, subtler elements lurk beneath the surface.</p><p>
    
    If you need any more convincing, just remember this: Fantomas could possibly
    be the best heavy metal-Henry Mancini cover band.  Ever.  <i>The Director's
    Cut</i> does Mr. Moon River twice; first on a relatively straightforward,
    albeit sexy and beautifully reverbed, version of ""Experiment in Terror"" that
    only deviates from its smoky lounge atmosphere long enough to deliver eight
    bars of crushing, sludgy noise; and then on the album's closer, ""Charade.""
    Beginning with a demented samba-beatbox from Patton, ""Charade"" vacillates
    between an incredibly smooth, jazzy melody and a spitfire speed-yodel stomp.
    As the dubbed-in crowd applauds, the melody gently returns with more
    hyphen-encouraging mayhem.  And suddenly, it's very clear how this will all
    end: ""YAD DA DA DADA DA DA DADA YAD DA DADA DA DA DA DADA!""</p><p>
    
    Sing it, Mike.</p></div>"|2988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2988-the-directors-cut/|8.4|Brendan Reid

How much cash have you got? None? Maybe a couple
    bucks? Hell, maybe you're loaded, for all I care. Let's say, though, for the
    purposes of this hypothetical situation, that you have $7.  What would you do
    with this money?  You could eat lunch.  You could buy a cheap paperback.  You
    could go to Radio Shack and buy a couple adapters.  Or you could, amongst other
    possibilities generated by even the most limited of imaginations, buy a CD EP.</p><p>
    
    That's right, a CD EP. This lovely invention holds the capability of true power
    for any indie band. It can be instrumental in building up a group's reputation.
    It can be short but sweet, promising true potential and building hype for a band's
    debut LP. It can be a way to keep the impatient fans of an already well-established
    group happy by dispensing the tracks they've got to spare. It can be a way to take
    that a step further and include about 55 minutes worth of almost entirely unreleased
    material, half of which is unlisted (reference: Modest Mouse, <i>Interstate 8</i>,
    Up, 1996).  And the price stays at $7 as long as you call it an EP.</p><p>
    
    Taking the Modest Mouse example into consideration, it's inevitable that you
    will occasionally find the opposite to be true. By which I mean, sometimes a
    band just wants to release something for the hell of it. It'll probably end up
    ripping their fans off, but what does that matter? It's only $7. And with the
    <i>Let's Go!</i> EP, the Apples in Stereo have done just this. A sufficient
    review of this lackluster release can be completed in three paragraphs, beginning
    after this linebreak.</p><p>
    
    Hi. The <i>Let's Go!</i> EP contains five tracks. Only one of them is entirely
    new-- that is, it is not a song or a version of a song that has already been
    released elsewhere. It is called ""If You Want to Wear a Hat"". It confirms,
    once and for all, that the Apples in Stereo are now a children's band. The
    first two lines go like this: ""If you want to wear a hat/ You better get one
    that looks better than that."" Robert Schneider sings these words in the most
    precious of fashions, with companion Hilarie Sidney lending similarly twee
    backup. Imagine this against a completely soulless Jackson 5 groove and an
    annoying, beeping synthesized rhythm. It does not leave much room for hope.</p><p>
    
    This is the kind of infantile direction that had been only hinted at by a
    couple of tracks from last year's <i>The Discovery of a World Inside the
    Moone</i>, and further clarified by the song ""Signal in the Sky (Let's Go!)"",
    the parenthetical title track to this EP.  There is not one, but <i>two</i>
    versions of this selection from the recent <i>Powerpuff Girls</i> soundtrack
    album. Let me repeat that, because I feel you have not fully taken in this
    information: <i>two</i> versions of a selection from the <em>Powerpuff Girls</em>
    soundtrack.  This alone carries the Apples that much farther into the toddler
    moshpit.  The song, in tradition with the subject matter, is nauseatingly
    cloying. The included demo version is backed only by acoustic guitar and drum
    machine, but manages to have a virtually identical effect on the listener, with
    the exception of the noticeable lack of a borrowed ""Destination Unknown"" synth
    riff.</p><p>
    
    There are two tracks left. One is another acoustic demo: a version of ""Stream
    Running Over"", originally one of the more slightly decent tracks from <i>Moone</i>.
    It's just as pleasant as the original, but not essential by any means-- and sure
    as hell not worth $7, especially if you already own the other, superior version.
    Then there's their live recording of the Beach Boys's ""Heroes and Villains"", which
    can be found elsewhere-- specifically, on their <i>Live in Chicago</i> MP3-only
    release through eMusic.  Their version, missing everything that made the original
    great (not the least of which is its exquisitely arranged vocal harmonies), is
    utter bullshit which I have laughed at and called names.</p><p>
    
    Still have that $7?  Go get lunch.  And bring me back a value meal.</p></div>"|254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/254-lets-go-ep/|3.8|Spencer Owen

If this doesn't strike you as
    an odd statement, you've probably never heard his previous full-length <i>Plus
    Forty Seven Degrees 56' 37"" Minus Sixteen Degrees 51' 08""</i>. It was a
    brilliant album, packed with dense, complex and immersive sound. But it was,
    shall we say, abrasive. And if you ever found the tracks from <i>Plus Forty
    Seven Degrees</i> running through your head for days on end, you'd probably
    try to silence them with drinking binges and eventually find yourself curled
    up in a doorway, a casualty of our crumbling mental health system.</p><p>
    
    That album was noise music, my friends. But this song running through my head
    last week, it was pretty, and I could hum it. It opened with a bit of strummed
    acoustic guitar (Fennesz has always fed his guitar into his laptop, but this
    is the first time I'd heard him play it straight) and gurgling electronics
    not far from <i>Dots and Loops</i>-era Stereolab. The chord changes were
    clear and effective, and the yearning synthesizer outlined a melody that
    tugged at the heartstrings. There was noise to provide contrast to the warmth,
    enough to strike the perfect balance.  The song I couldn't get out of my head
    was the title track from <i>Endless Summer</i>, an album that finds Austrian
    Christian Fennesz seeding his clouds of distortion with radiant chunks of
    melody. And the rain, she is beautiful.</p><p>
    
    I'm sure you've all heard of a festival that started in San Francisco called
    Noise Pop. I like seeing those two words together, as their confluence gets
    to the heart of what I love in music. The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, My Bloody
    Valentine, the Flaming Lips-- at various times, all these bands lacerated
    melody with distortion, thereby making it so much more striking. I don't
    hesitate to lump this Fennesz album into that category, though he's coming
    at the intersection from the noisy part of town (buyer beware). If the Beach
    Boys represent the ideal of angelic clarity at the near end, and white noise
    is the sonic chaos in the distance, Fennesz currently owns the territory
    about 2/3 the way down the scale.</p><p>
    
    ""Made in Hongkong"" opens <i>Endless Summer</i> with electric guitar chords
    in a descending progression that are swirled together as though heard through
    an aural kaleidoscope. In a similar vein is ""Caecilia,"" with ringing vibes set
    against the quavering, distorted guitar lead, altogether sounding something like
    a laptop version of a calliope waltz.  ""Shisheido"" is even more conventional,
    consisting of a strummed electric guitar that's sporadically smothered in extreme
    high-pass filtering and a simple keyboard melody.</p><p>
    
    ""A Year in a Minute"" is one of a handful of tracks that approaches the massive
    drones of earlier Fennesz, but it, too, captures the warmth of the theme. Fat
    organ pipes of distortion move in a three-chord pattern, building in intensity
    and changing slightly in texture, eventually giving way to jittery electronics.
    Also coarse is ""Got to Move On"" which hides its melody far behind a buzzing
    electrified fence of sound.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, my choice of the Beach Boys for the earlier metaphor was deliberate.
    One side of his two-song seven-inch, <i>Plays</i>, found Fennesz kinda covering
    ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)."" I say ""kinda"" because I can't hear
    any direct reference to the original, though I do think Fennesz captured some
    kind of essence with his version. Fennesz gets more overt with this trickery
    on ""Before I Leave,"" which samples the familiar organ sound of the Beach Boys
    (so loved by Sean O'Hagan) and gives it the Oval treatment, creating a track of
    rapidly skipping tones.</p><p>
    
    This appropriation says something about the feeling of this record. We all
    remember <i>Endless Summer</i> as the Beach Boys album that brought them back to
    prominence in the 70s and set them on the road to being an oldies act. It was
    the perfect title for 60s California nostalgia, and it's the perfect title for
    this Austrian's fractured take on some of the same signifiers.</p><p>
    
    The cover of Fennesz' <i>Endless Summer</i> features placid beach scenes right
    off an Ocean Pacific t-shirt, complete with warm sunset colors.  Tellingly, the
    pictures are obscured by video scanlines, revealing this experience as a
    third-generation dub of the original media-derived memories, which, of course,
    came from Beach Boys songs and beach movies. But the importance of California
    and the Endless Summer never needed to be grounded in reality; as the old saw
    goes, Brian Wilson's California was a state of mind.  And Fennesz takes musical
    warmth, glowing melodies and lush arrangement and subjects them to sharp digital
    decay, providing another deep layer of meaning.</p></div>"|3035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3035-endless-summer/|9.4|Mark Richard-San

    The sweet aching torture from one that you love<br/>
    For some shall believe, while many find hard<br/>
    There is nothing quite like, the song of Macabre!</i></p><p>
    
    Okay, so I ripped that off some goth chick's ""webcave,"" but short of a tragico-absurdist interpretive dance,
    it's the best way to sum up the feelings I have for The Faint's new album, <i>Danse Macabre</i>. Indie rock
    (with the exception of the obscure supergroup The Hattifatteners) has never expressed much of an interest in
    a ""ring of corpses holding hands,"" but if the kids really want to fight the culture industry through song,
    they should embrace this, as death does not care for social standing or wealth.  Nor does dance!</p><p>
    
    But let's start from the beginning: long before The Faint released <i>Danse Macabre</i> last Tuesday, the
    Bubonic plague wiped out approximately one-third of Europe's population.  Fear of falling victim to the
    plague's wrath became a part of everyday life for the people of the time, inspiring a lot of art, poetry,
    music, and most importantly, woodcuts, about death.  The Danse Macabre usually referred to representations
    of skeletons dancing or playing musical instruments.  <i>Danse Macabre</i> is also a symphony by Camille
    Saint-Saens, a progressive-metal band from Birmingham, and an 18+ night on Thursdays.</p><p>
    
    From what I gathered in my days studying woodcuts, the music of the Danse Macabre would cast a diabolical
    spell over people, drawing them towards the dance into death.  And The Faint's <i>Danse Macabre</i> is no
    exception. These songs may ride on new-wave synth swells but they've got a New Order-like urgency and
    art-punk edge that throws off comparisons to Depeche Mode and The Human League. The album is primarily
    driven by keyboards, though Joel Petersen's live bass, Todd Baechle's occasional acoustic drums, and Saddle
    Creek cellist Gretta Cohn help the album avoid a sterile sound.</p><p>
    
    Right from the start, <i>Danse Macabre</i> casts a gothic light on the ordinary (as opposed, of course, to
    the extraordinary).  A song title like ""Agenda Suicide"" suggests something more in the order of Heaven's
    Gate than career paralegaling, but instead, the song details the wasted days of mindless work in the name
    of an empty American dream: ""Our work makes pretty little homes/ Agenda suicide, the drones work hard before
    they die/ And give up on pretty little homes.""  Meanwhile, ""Let the Poison Spill from your Throat"" is gossip
    from the crypt.  Social climbing and bitter words motivated by insecurity are made physical and grotesque:
    ""If there's dirt you've got on someone/ You let it loose without a thought/ You let the poison spill/
    Spurt from your throat/ Hiss like steam.""</p><p>
    
    Though The Faint's last album, <i>Blank-Wave Arcade</i>, was lyrically obsessed with sex, <i>Danse Macabre</i>
    seems to keep coming back to gothic paradoxes; the living die by agenda suicide, and mannequins are brought
    to life.  Paralysis and involuntary movement or actions are common themes-- although paralysis is more likely
    to mean being trapped in daily routines than in coffins, and involuntary movements are caused by social
    pressure rather than Satanic possession.  Still, these subjects seem well suited for synth-heavy anthems
    that lack subtlety in their thumping draw towards the dancefloor.</p><p>
    
    So, sure, it's dancy, and unquestionably new-wave, but the <i>Danse Macabre</i> is anything but retro.  The
    Faint might be using Duran Duran's keyboards, but rather than mimicking the past, they play with new-wave,
    goth, punk rock, and some old woodcuts to make a record entirely fresh and oddly optimistic in the way that
    only an album which commands you to ""Danse!/ Danse the Danse Macabre!"" can.</p></div>"|2950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2950-danse-macabre/|7.8|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    student loan papers and the key to my dorm years ago, I'm going to have to
    use Lush as my main point if I ever want to argue in favor of laissez-faire,
    free-market capitalism.  No, I'm not talking about the cynical view that
    this new CD is just one in a series of cash cows from a label recently under
    financial stress (and new ownership)-- <i>Ciao!</i> is a better and more
    faithful portrait of the band than either the Cocteau Twins' or Pixies'
    retrospectives that have seen release through 4AD in the past few years.
    I'm referring to the spirit of competition that existed, just subcutaneously,
    between co-frontwomen Miki Berenyi and Emma Anderson throughout the band's
    lifespan.</p><p>
    
    Driving one another to excellence, their willingness to spar with each other
    within the confines of the three-minute pop song propelled Lush to critical
    acclaim and a respectably sized, loyal fanbase.  Playing off each others'
    successes, failures and challenges, Anderson and Berenyi's meticulous
    songcraft gave Lush one of the highest signal-to-noise ratios of any early
    90's rock band.  Adam Smith would have been proud.</p><p>
<i>Ciao!</i> their new, career-spanning compilation has more balance than
    a Romanian gymnast: four songs taken from the band's swan song <i>Lovelife</i>,
    four from debut <i>Spooky</i>, four from the pre-<i>Spooky</i> EPs, and five
    from the band's best and most underappreciated achievement, <i>Split</i>.
    Working in reverse chronological order, the disc has a sort of ""Heart of
    Darkness"" device going for it.  The journey leads you back in time, toward
    the headwaters and wellspring of the band's original dreamy, hazy sound.  The
    farther you travel, the more tangled, overgrown and surreal your surroundings
    become.</p><p>
    
    Starting things off, however, is a showcase of both the band's late-era poppy
    side, featuring the Anderson songs ""500 (Shake Baby Shake)"" and ""Single Girl,""
    as well as Miki's hokey, misguided duet with Pulp's Jarvis Cocker, which lent
    this disc its title.  One of the neat paradoxes of Lush: as they grew into
    their mainstream, guitar-pop sound, they also became both more jaded and more
    concrete in their lyrics.  Compare ""I don't need your practiced lies/ Your
    school of charm mentality/ So save your breath for someone else/ And credit
    me with something more/ When it comes to men like you/ I know the score, I've
    heard it all before"" from ""Ladykillers"" with the buried vocals of ""Sweetness
    and Light"":  ""Only to stay/ Only to breathe/ Only to see/ That space and light
    is what I really need.""</p><p>
    
    Musically, Lush was always good at using contemporaries of theirs as
    touchstones.  It would be unfair to call them influences, since the
    chronologies and relative importance is all muddled, but you can hear the
    Sundays' shared bliss in ""Sweetness and Light"" and ""Lovelife,"" and a noisier
    Heavenly in the keen melodies of ""Hypocrite.""  Probably the sunniest of all
    the shoegazer bands, they skirted the fringe of that movement, more there at
    the insistence of the British press than shared aesthetics.  Even their
    blurred <i>Spooky</i>-era stuff was joyous and exultant in tone.</p><p>
    
    Pointing out the highlights of a highlight disc is ridiculous and maybe just
    a little too postmodern.  However, I can say with certainty that I was
    immensely pleased to notice that tracks like the punky ""Hypocrite,"" ""When I
    Die,"" one of Anderson's best songs ever, an old favorite like ""For Love,""
    and the early band-defining moment, ""Thoughtforms"" were all included.</p><p>
    
    Best-of compilations almost always fail.  If the band being complied is too
    great (cf. <i>Death to the Pixies</i>), a best-of attempt is doomed from the
    concept: all the albums are worth getting, so why settle for a sampler that
    only serves to destroy an album's carefully selected track order?  If the
    band is mediocre or worse (cf. Modern English's <i>Life in the Gladhouse</i>),
    then the concept of ""greatest hits"" doesn't even apply-- the album is two
    hits and a lot of filler.  Better fodder for this type of packaging is a
    group on the periphery; one that is excellent, but marginal in the sense that
    they were always on the verge of superstardom, yet never firing on all four
    cylinders at once.</p><p>
    
    People who might have been previously wary of taking a chance on Lush can
    now know for certain that if they plunk down their cash, they'll be getting
    a well-rounded primer on a whole career.  It isn't a substitute for their
    whole catalog, but it isn't a too-shallow-to-be-useful waste of money,
    either.</p><p>
    
    When I sat down to listen to <i>Ciao!</i>, it had been at least seven years
    since I'd last listened to Lush, and probably five since I'd even thought
    of them.  But by the end, I was digging out the old discs again-- not out
    of an obligation to research and refresh, but because I wanted to relive
    and remember.  As well as making new fans, <i>Ciao!</i> does just as good of
    a job at winning the old ones back.  Like me.</p></div>"|4936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4936-ciao-the-best-of-lush/|8.1|John Dark

    gigs before selling it to Don Henley, broken the record for saying ""fuck"" in
    a charting, Steely Dan-sampling pop single, constructed a Macy's Day-sized
    balloon of a soda-slurping raccoon, subjected themselves to alien abduction
    in an ILM-created music video, recorded the highest-selling Welsh-language
    album ever, and remixed the Beatles for a Grammy-nominated record.  To say
    the least, they've kept audiences on their toes with their audacity and
    playfulness.</p><p>
    
    It would seem that there's little left for SFA to accomplish,
    except for those ever-elusive multiplatinum worldwide sales.  <i>Rings
    Around the World</i> aims for that and beyond.  Not only do members of the
    Velvet Underground and the Beatles offhandedly appear on the record
    (completely inconspicuously), but <i>Rings Around the World</i> will be the
    first album ever to see debut release on DVD complete with 5.1 Stereo Surround
    Sound, videos for each song directed by Dogme directors, cartoonists, and
    underground radicals, and track-by-track remixes by the likes of Matmos, Kid
    606, and Brave Captain.  The project sounds ambitious and brilliant on paper,
    but it's nothing without the music to back it up.  No fear, as SFA have
    pulled out their entire catalog of styles and whipped up their best album to
    date-- a bold claim to the upper echelon of rock.</p><p>
    
    On the whole, <i>Rings Around the World</i> infuses 1970s soul, sunshine, and
    sparkle to more familiar Furries territory.  Philly horns and strings seep
    from ""It's Not the End of the World,"" ""Presidential Suite,"" and the first
    single, ""Juxtaposed with U.""  Like their past single, ""Northern Lights,""
    ""Juxtaposed"" comes across more as a genre exercise-- this time favoring AM
    soul over tropicalia-- but flips the song with vocoder verses and a
    rollerskate-handclap chorus refrain of, ""You've got to tolerate all those
    people that you hate/ I'm not in love with you but I won't hold that against
    you.""  Singer Gruff Rhys claims that Bobby Brown turned down an invitation to
    duet on the ""let's get juxtaposed"" lines, but the song remains subversively
    genius, nonetheless.  If older singles, such as ""Demons"" off <i>Radiator</i>,
    modernized Bowie's <i>Space Oddity</i>, than ""Juxtaposed"" is clearly the heir
    to ""Young Americans"" and ""Fame.""</p><p>
    
    ""Run, Christian, Run!"" gallops into late-era Byrds territory, with steel
    guitars and modified twang, though thematically, the lyrics run the exact
    opposite of <i>Sad Sweetheart</i>'s ""The Christian Life.""  Mellow acoustic
    strumming and thick harmonies of lines like ""you deserve to die"" give way to
    manic breakbeats on the breath-taking ""No Sympathy,"" perhaps the first pop
    song ever to fuse idyllic folk with IDM, not counting SFA's own ""Mountain
    People,"" which fused idyllic folk with house.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, though <i>Rings</i> stands as the Super Furry Animals' boldest
    pop album yet, few songs reach into rocking territory.  The heaviest moments
    pop up in the first third of the record, after the somnambulist stomp of the
    opener.  ""Sidewalk Serfer Girl"" splices metal riffing with skittering
    electronics and the ever-present Huge Chorus, and the title track takes the
    upbeat Britpop of their debut album and layers on spectral details.  Rhys
    growls in the speaker-blowing outro to the otherwise cheery ""Receptacle for
    the Respectable.""</p><p>
    
    The music is paisley, sun-heated, and layered, and juxtaposed to Rhys'
    satirical and heartfelt lyrics, the result is timeless.  Just reading the
    song titles gives one the sense of humor and rancor that courses through the
    record.  As mentioned before, it's impossible to deny Bowie's muse in SFA's
    career, despite their continued costuming in anoraks and cargo pants instead
    of red mullets, white scarves, spandex and suits.  The chameleon act is left
    to the tunes.  More conveniently, SFA will butt a ""Let's Dance"" up against
    a ""Black Country Rock"" or ""Speed of Life"" on the same album side, all while
    maintaining a rustic, inherently Welsh vibe.  Princess Di, ""Princess of Wales,""
    never set foot inside the country, and karma caught up.  Heed the warning
    and dive in.</p></div>"|7598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7598-rings-around-the-world/|8.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

    by the Dismemberment Plan. The review was positive.  Alright, that's a bit
    of an understatement. You could have called it a rave. In fact, raves for the
    album were repeated in the news and features sections; several staff members
    even changed their names to ""Emergency"" or ""I.""  For a short period the
    entire site closed down but for a banner page reading, ""Buy <i>Emergency &amp;
    I</i> by the Dismemberment Plan!"" The same message was scrawled across
    highway off-ramps next to ""Armenia Lives!"" and ""Clapton is God!"" Even though
    they didn't know me back then, <i>Pitchfork</i> staff members would call in
    the middle of the night asking if I'd gotten the album yet.  I hadn't.  There
    was a hunger strike.</p><p>
    
    Eventually, I got the record. I listened to it a number of times and came to
    appreciate the band's unique take on rock. There was always something new
    happening, and the elements worked together to create stirring effects song
    after song. My friend who likes good music got it and loved it. Couldn't stop
    talking about it.</p><p>
    
    Yet I didn't really care for it.  There was something too intellectual, too
    clean, too weird for its own sake. There was a song about getting an open
    invitation to everything and the singer going to a bunch of lame parties that
    depressed me. I didn't like the singer's metallic, ringing voice.  So this is
    what the asterisk's about:</p><p>
<font size=""-2"">* This is a review by someone who didn't really care for
    <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, one of the greatest records-- no, one of the greatest
    <i>phenomena</i> ever, rivaling the Big Bang and the birth of Christ. Omaha,
    Nebraska's Cursive is used to getting 8.0's here, and perhaps they would
    again if someone of less sclerotic tastes had gotten hold of <i>Burst and
    Bloom</i>.</font></p><p>
    
    As with <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, I don't really get off on what I'm hearing, but
    I can appreciate this five-song EP, the follow-up to the widely lauded
    full-length <i>Domestica</i>. I know others will like this, and I have to
    attribute some of my dislike to my own taste, as opposed to this band's
    quality. I was of a mind to dog this record, but they kept jarring my
    hardened ears to listen with strong bursts of dissonant guitarwork, and
    athletic hits of band cohesion, rocking me.  Cursive brings to mind elements
    of the aforementioned Plan, Archers of Loaf, At the Drive-In, and Refused,
    and the songs have their share of surprising moments. They can summon some
    great cacophony, though to my mind, they don't swing. Yes, swing. It's
    necessary. It don't mean a thing. When the fireworks die down and I become
    used to the new elements, the underlying structures aren't all that
    thrilling.</p><p>
    
    I think this may be ""emo,"" though I've never been able to figure out what the
    hell emo is. Fugazi + Whining = Emo?  What kind of music worth a damn isn't
    about emotion? Do they just replace political rage with a general sense of
    negativity? Is that emotion?</p><p>
    
    When Tim Kasher groans, ""4/4 hip-hop and it don't stop,"" on the opener, ""Sink
    to the Beat,"" I don't know what downbeat emotion he's going for, but it makes
    me embarrassed. The song goes on to detail the creation and marketing of this
    very song, which, with some nice alliteration, comes off as a well-written
    mistake-- another song about songwriting. Kasher warns us that, ""Some melodies
    are like disease/ They can inflame your miseries/ They can infect your
    memories."" This is the indie rock way of conveying that ""sad songs say so
    much."" It's not much of a message.  Cursive almost redeem this song when the
    noise takes over, as one guitar hits like bricks while the other spears
    through in rapid regularity, like a sewing machine converted into a weapon.
    Kasher screams like the guy being assaulted by the bricks and needles, and
    bass player Matt Maguinn is particularly good at hard two-note hits, playing
    with more earthshaking presence than tone. Still, they should have ditched
    this number, as the rest of the disc is superior.</p><p>
    
    Kasher and Ted Stevens (of Lullaby for the Working Class) weave together
    subtle, tiptoeing guitar lines at the start of ""The Great Decay,"" creating a
    sneaking, suspenseful sensation, an expectation that's realized in explosive
    mayhem. ""All these ghost towns share a name,"" Kasher sings convincingly in an
    Eric Bachmann rasp. ""Anywhere USA/ All these strangers look the same/ Day
    after day after day."" This is the most driving number, my favorite.</p><p>
    
    An organ slithers in spookily to announce ""Tall Tales, Telltales,"" only to
    fade into muted, evil circus music.  Soon, the band's newest addition, band
    member Gretta Cohn, comes in on the cello, riding over drumrolls as the
    guitars play hypnotic Arabian figures.  The whole band comes together in a
    large, surging, muddy chorus. The song swells and sinks intermittently, but
    without really going anywhere. Kasher sure can sing and scream, but he lacks
    warmth and humor.</p><p>
    
    ""Mothership, Mothership Do You Read Me?"" attempts interstellar communication
    through fast, fuzzed-out guitar riffs and long, haunting cello lines. There's
    a spooky little breakdown and more great screams, as well as a sci-fi theme
    of alienation. I don't think it has much to do with Parliament/Funkadelic,
    sadly.  Soon, ""Fairytales Tell Tales"" (they like that wordplay!) kicks in with
    a fine sonic assault, the bass part looping around hugely, like a kimodo
    dragon performing somersaults. The drums almost skitter, locking in with
    the phased-out guitar to sound like an electric eggbeater jammed into a trash
    compactor. There's a hardcore flourish before it returns to the more plodding,
    typical Cursive groove.</p><p>
    
    And therein lies the ultimate problem facing <i>Burst
    and Bloom</i>: in these tales of jaded seduction, Cursive captures the sadness,
    but none of the wit or fun of life.  They rock, but they don't bring the party.
    Sure, it may be hard for a song to be simultaneously sad and fun, but better
    songwriters accomplish both.</p></div>"|1701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1701-burst-and-bloom-ep/|6.9|Dan Kilian

I'll bet they're really Irish folkies
    singing pretty little acoustic ballads.  They're so earnest!  How can I truly
    enjoy earnest?  I already know what's going to happen: I'm going to recommend
    them, maybe play them for friends, and then be mocked as a sucker. ""What is
    this Indigo Guys crap?"" they'll all say, and I'll be banished from the halls
    of cool forever.  Sure, I never belonged to begin with, but at least I once
    mouthed all the right prejudices and espoused all the right decadences.  And
    I didn't listen to folky Irish singer/songwriters. They're trying to con me,
    these Turin Brakes.</p><p>
    Okay, they're English, but what's the difference?  If it's on an island and
    it's acoustic guitars, it's either Francis Dunnery or Don Ho.  Regardless,
    they've seduced me.  Gale Paridjanian's smile beams from the back of the
    disc. And it's a hell of a smile.  It melts my cynical heart.  Ollie Knights'
    vocals mix Jeff Buckley moan and Marc Bolan hiss.  The songs are simple,
    emotional, and earnest (I am such a fool!), and they're laden with Everly
    Brothers (or is it the Indigo Girls?) harmonies.  The production captures the
    acoustic guitars in clean, highly polished amber with spare rhythm, letting
    the songs well up. Dear me, it's a pretty album, with a melancholy that's--
    of course-- unaffected. It has a softness that soothes without deflating.</p><p>
    The lyrics are often simple. The chorus of ""Underdog (Save Me)"" goes, ""Save
    me from myself.""  Sure, it's trite, but the harmonies make the desperation
    fresh and beautiful.  On ""State of Things,"" over a loping rhythm, they sing,
    ""You and me/ Used to be on fire,"" capturing the mournful feeling of dying
    passion. The song drowns in regret beneath Knights' Buckley-like croon. I say
    Buckley-like because he's not actually aping, just finding some of the same
    chilling notes the Mystery White Boy wrested from some cosmic place. ""The
    Road"" has that same effect, and in a more uptempo vein, so does ""Emergency
    72.""  This song follows a well-worn descending progression, but Knights leaps
    from note to note delightfully. His articulation also emphasizes what a nice
    string of consonants and vowels is the number 72. Seventy-TWO! Seventy-TWO!
    Seventy-TWO! What other good numbers are there out there to write songs
    about? How about 806? Eight hundred and SIX! That would rock.</p><p>
    ""Future Boy"" does use the word ""yonder."" I've got you, Irish folkies! They
    slip away from that folk trap with images of science fiction and social
    decay. It includes the requisite ""junkies/monkeys"" rhyme, and the simple
    truth that ""Syphilis is a bitch but contracting HIV is much worse,"" which is
    pretty hard to argue with. The song tells the story of a time traveler who
    goes back to rescue himself as a baby. Nice one.</p><p>
    ""Slack"" manages a midtempo rock, but ""Starship"" and ""By TV Lights"" drag.
    The latter ends with a mélange of TV sounds in the trail-off, reminiscent of
    Simon &amp; Garfunkel's (who I also suspect are Irish, or from the 60's) ""Silent
    Night/Six O'Clock News.""  This could be incriminating evidence, but of course,
    I also like Simon &amp; Garfunkel, so file that away for context.</p><p>
    After the beautifully sad harmonies of ""The Optimist"" comes a bonus
    track.  Hey, artists, we've been on to this tactic since ""Train in Vain.""
    Just list the tracks, already.  For the record, it's a pretty, go-nowhere
    instrumental. The disc also includes a video for your computer. As we were
    often told in the 80's, video is the future for musicians, although it's more
    closely linked-- since we're all digital in the digital field, such bundling
    is inevitable, even after the compact disc goes the way of the acetate. When
    will the future Me come back in time and whisk the present Me to a world
    where these videos are worth a damn?</p><p>
    After a spell of listening to <i>The Optimist LP</i>, I shamefully boarded a
    plane to Ireland. There, on the green, grassy runway, were two young men
    playing acoustic guitars. Sure enough, it was Turin Brakes. I grabbed one--
    it was Gale Paridjanian-- shook him and demanded, ""Are you trying to con me?
    I really like your songs, but are they going to bore the pants off of my
    millions of readers?""</p><p>
    Paridjanian answered, ""No, it's the real deal. Sure, we're secretly Irish
    folkies, but we threw in some drums and the songs will stay good. Enjoy
    yourself."" Then he smiled, and I melted.</p></div>"|8188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8188-the-optimist-lp/|7.7|Dan Kilian

It seems like such a cool place, full of wide-open
    desert expanses, people with funny accents, and all manner of crazy marsupials.
    They have frilled lizards, Tasmanian devils, and most of the birds are
    flightless.  Plus, there all sorts of creepy things crawling around, like
    giant redback spiders, poisonous snakes, and Nick Cave.  And there's always
    that charming Yahoo Serious fellow, a true renaissance man of the cinema.  I
    wonder what ever happened to him.</p><p>
    
    I've always wondered why such an interesting place didn't produce more great
    bands.  You've got the Saints, the Birthday Party, the Dirty Three, and more
    recently, the Avalanches.  But besides that what is there?  Silverchair?  Rolf
    Harris?  Well, I'll tell you what else there is.  There's Radio Birdman, the
    godfathers of Aussie rock.  For the last half of the 70's, these guys totally
    rocked, and now Sub Pop has generously ended their two decades of silence in
    the states with this new compilation.  Friends, they've aged a lot better
    than Paul Hogan.</p><p>
    
    From the very first moments of the opener, ""Aloha Steve &amp; Danno,"" it's
    abundantly clear that Radio Birdman were a talented bunch.  Guitars duel for
    supremacy over stabbing organs, elastic basslines and Ayers Rock-solid
    drumming, as vocalist Rob Younger barks the refrain: ""Book 'em, Danno,
    murder one.""  The song is so vital and ferocious that it's easy to forget
    it's written about the characters from ""Hawaii Five-O.""  The lead guitar even
    plays the Ventures' ""Theme to 'Hawaii Five-O.'""  And unbelievably, it never
    sounds like novelty.</p><p>
    
    It's things like their ability to shamelessly reference things (their very
    name is a phrase nicked from the Stooges' ""1970"") and get away with it on the
    strength of their sheer manic energy that made Radio Birdman great.  The
    band's primary songwriter and guitarist, the Detroit-born American expatriate
    Deniz Tek, deftly brought together myriad influences into a primal stew of
    great rock n' roll.  Naturally, the chaotic Detroit rock of the Stooges and
    MC5 always loomed large in the mix, but there's as much Yardbirds, Dick Dale,
    Bobby Fuller, Chuck Berry, Blue Oyster Cult and Link Wray in there as anything
    else.</p><p>
    
    And thanks to the sparkling remastering job by the folks at Sub Pop, this
    material sounds like it was recorded yesterday in an overpriced L.A. studio.
    The compilation pulls together all of the band's debut album, <i>Radios
    Appear</i> (the title comes from Blue Oyster Cult's ""Dominance and Submission""),
    in addition to two tracks from their <i>Burn My Eye</i> EP, a smattering of
    selections from their sophomore effort <i>Living Eyes</i>, and three blistering
    live offerings from the <i>More Fun</i> EP.</p><p>
    
    The compilers have unfortunately failed to sequencing these tracks in
    chronological order, but the mix is so consistent that it rarely detracts
    from the listening experience.  And perhaps the only thing more consistent
    than the mix is the quality of the material.  Every song is good, and it's
    mystifying as to why the band never had more success.  Though constantly
    gritty and muscular, there's an innate sense of melody that guides every
    song directly into your memory by the second or third listen.</p><p>
    
    The flypaper riffs of ""Hand of Law"" will lodge themselves in your head before
    you even get to the chorus, whose traditional anti-authority stance makes
    sense coming from a band from a former penal colony.  Warwick Gilbert's
    rip-snorting bass chews up the low-end like there's no tomorrow.  You will
    listen to this song in your car.  And you will like it.</p><p>
    
    ""Snake,"" from the 1976 <i>Burn my Eye</i> EP, beats the Clash to their own
    punch, and makes you wonder if Joe Strummer didn't cop a vocal move or two
    from Younger.  The other song from that EP present here, ""I-94,"" evidences
    Tek's homesickness, with references to the interstate and American
    institutions like Eskimo Pies.  Elsewhere, ""Love Kills"" makes a passing
    reference of ""singing 'We Will Fall'"" at a Stooges show.</p><p>
    
    But one of the compilation's highlights easily comes with ""Man with Golden
    Helmet,"" originally the closing track on the <i>Radios Appear</i> album.
    Ron Keeley's ride cymbals and Gilbert's fluid bass propel Tek's leads and
    Chris Masuak's textured strumming in a manner that modern listeners might
    equate to Radiohead's ""Blow Out.""  But the real shock comes when Pip Hoyle's
    piano takes center stage for an extended solo that trades between classical
    figures and Little Richard exuberance.  This track exemplifies more than any
    other that Radio Birdman were not just a punk band, but another thing entirely,
    a dexterous unit whose regrettably short existence managed to produce some
    transcendent music.</p><p>
    
    It's clear from the selections here that <i>Living Eyes</i>, recorded away
    from home in Wales, was a darker record, full of the violent imagery of
    ""Smith &amp; Wesson Blues"" and the feedback meltdown of ""Alone in the Endzone.""
    The live tracks that close the CD, culled from a 1977 Sydney performance,
    capture the band in all their raging glory, full of piss and vinegar, but
    also raging with pop sensibility.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, it seems as if Radio Birdman were the right band at the wrong
    time, and they never managed to turn their strengths into success.  This
    compilation may finally set the record straight about one of Australia's
    greatest bands.  They were raw and refined, political and fun all at once--
    rare traits for a single band to possess.  Their legacy is impressive and
    worthy of investigation for just about anyone who's interested in first-wave
    punk, or just good rock and roll in general.  Now if only someone could
    resurrect the legacy of Young Einstein.</p></div>"|6652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6652-the-essential-radio-birdman-1974-1978/|8.6|Joe Tangari

What If... Britney Spears, who, in real life, shot
    like a buxom arrow from the American South to the Mickey Mouse Club to the
    waiting and greasily magical hands of a cadre of Swedish record producers,
    instead stayed home through high school, went to college in a fairly hip
    Southern city, discovered ""indie,"" dyed her hair a blonde so blonde it was
    almost white, and moved to NYC with a guy to craft bedroom dance-pop on a
    laptop computer?  Really.  What If?</p><p>
    Well, first, the youngsters would probably come up with a suitably dorky name
    for their project, something relevant to their situation but sufficiently
    non-sequiturial.  Then they'd get signed to Kindercore.  Then they'd put out
    some 12-inches while working up material for their full-length.  Then they'd
    release their full-length, to occasional college radio airplay, middling
    reviews in print and webzines, and reasonable sales.  Then, if things seemed
    to be going well enough, they'd release another full-length in a few years.
    Yup.  Not nearly as exciting an existence as the good people at Disney and
    Jive could have offered her (and her boobies would probably be a little less
    ginourmous), but overall, not a bad life.  Turned out to be kind of a boring
    ""What If,"" though.</p><p>
    This is not to say that all of I Am the World Trade Center's debut LP, <i>Out
    of the Loop</i>, sounds like ""Oops, I Did It Again""; some of it, though, does,
    just a little.  And that's the part where the two main players seem to be
    getting it right.  Dan Gellar and Amy Dykes have a buried knack for the
    driving groove; songs like ""Move On"" and ""Holland Tunnel"" want to rock your
    body and jack you up hardcore, but are limited by their sound and recording
    quality.</p><p>
    Dan and Amy possess what could be called an ""ethic,"" or what could also be
    called a ""budget""; none of the beats or basslines quite hit that expensive
    sub-bass level, all the samples and synth washes rattle about tinnily in your
    speakers, and Amy's always slightly off-key vocals bear all the quiet tension
    of the big-city apartment-dweller singing softly into her cardioid mike so as
    not to bother the swarthy fella next door.  All this low fidelity can work to
    some acts' advantage, and does to I Am the World Trade Center's, sometimes.
    Like on ""Analogous,"" which features the most charming white-indie band attempt
    at stutter-step R&amp;B; beats this side of the Beta Band's ""To You Alone.""</p><p>
    But even the Betas made you want to dance, or seemed to want you to dance.
    Whether the members of I Am the World Trade Center really want you to dance
    to their music is debatable.  Perhaps the most telling word in the last
    sentence of the previous paragraph was ""charming""; it really speaks volumes
    about this band's stock in trade, which is to take a spice rack full of
    elements and qualities inherent to honest-to-god-we-want-to-<i>move</i>-you
    dance music and twee 'em up a bunch.  Which is not as bad as it sounds.  It
    can be quite, well, charming.  But it can also suck fat squirrel balls.</p><p>
    The intended single for this record seems to be ""Metro,"" considering it leads
    off the album in its ""Brooklyn Mix"" form, and caps it in ""Athens Mix"" fashion.
    Oh, and because it bites.  We can't have an actually catchy single; remember,
    kids, the watchwords here are ""willful obscurity.""  The song sounds like the
    opening theme to an industrial instruction film-- something where girders are
    lifted and coffee is drunk from thermoses, then a smiling guy in a suit
    appears to tell you how you, too, can increase workplace safety.  Which, as a
    description, makes it sound more interesting and less hackneyed than it
    actually is.  But, were it my duty to sequence this album, I'd just lop
    the two versions of this track off, and let <i>Out of the Loop</i> begin with
    the winning greatness of ""Me to Be.""</p><p>
    ""Me to Be"" is the kind of song that goes perfectly on seven inches, intended,
    as they are, for either incessantly repeated home playings, or broadcasts on
    your local staticky AM college station that makes all music sound lo-fi, so
    that this track, jammed up against the latest high-budget Daft Punk endeavor,
    can come off as just plain awesome.  It's the most Britney-esque moment on
    the album, fast-paced and questioning, featuring a squelching keyboard riff,
    sitars, and a flute loop that sugars it all up just right.  It remains
    resolutely indie, though, at an extended-bridge-free-dance-breakdown 2\xBD minutes,
    which end all too quickly.  That's what ""back"" buttons were made for, though.</p><p>
    After ""Me to Be,"" <i>Out of the Loop</i> never gets quite that ass-shakingly
    good again, and considering that it's only the second track (or, in my more
    perfect version of the album, the first), that's kind of disappointing.  But
    only a little.  Overall, the whole record is pretty good, and deserves credit
    for its offhanded attempt at a ramshackle pop vision.  Let's hope that these
    guys get to spend a little more money the next time around, though.  Or get
    their hands on some greasily magical Swedes.  Now that would be an interesting
    ""What If!""</p></div>"|4040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4040-out-of-the-loop/|7.1|Jonny Pietin

    like, say, consumption-- that is more characteristic of the fin-de-siecle,
    when Freud analyzed it and Kafka's fiction embodied it. But recently, with
    the century having turned again, amnesia has come roaring back into the
    artistic consciousness. The only difference is that (supposedly) it's been
    spurned by a technological boom rather than an industrial one. Or so Radiohead
    would have us believe.</p><p>
    
    M. Ward's here to say, ""Fuck that!""  Or something like that. Whether it's an
    old girlfriend who broke his heart or a musical devotion to deceased folk,
    country and blues artists, he's not about to forget the past. The opening,
    titular track is a perfect example of the latter. A piano stumbles through
    the same three notes before bowing to a folk guitar which Ward calmly picks
    in a pleasant, traditional manner. It's the kind of bucolic song you'd expect
    from a romantic Italian movie of the fifties.</p><p>
    
    ""Color of Water,"" meanwhile, opens with a cheery, nearly Southern acoustic
    trot before descending into a wistful, pedal steel-infused mood straight out
    of Neil Young's <i>Harvest Moon</i>.  ""Well, I was all geared up and ready to
    go,"" Matt Ward croaks, soon harmonizing with a very Young-esque, high-pitched
    backup for the line, ""The color of the water was green."" The remaining lyrics
    overflow with imagery, as if Ward's only purpose is to prove the effectiveness
    of his memory.</p><p>
    
    The past surfaces again, musically speaking, with ""Half Moon,"" which opens
    with either a sample or impressive replication of a Sarah Vaughn-like jazz
    tune, led by what sounds like an oboe. But a thumping kickdrum and snare
    combo fade in quickly, as do some quiet guitar squelches. Ward again seems to
    be singing solely for the sake of remembering: ""Felt a dark night/ No starlight
    to light the room/ And no, no/ No, no/ No, no half moon."" But he does so in
    such a compelling, broken way-- admittedly, aided by vertiginous vocal
    effects-- that listening to his non-story is by no means a tedious a
    experience.</p><p>
    
    ""So Much Water"" is a rare, but unfortunate misstep. Both lyrically and
    musically, it sounds like a song by that college kid in the subway station--
    the one in Diesel jeans boisterously strumming his acoustic guitar and
    pretending he's homeless. As earlier, ""Bad Dreams"" opens with a scratchy jazz
    intro, but this time restrained feedback clears the palette for a listless
    number in which Ward, his voice at it's crackling worst-- cough up that
    phlegm, dammit!-- sings, ""Oh, every night I dreaming of you/ We're weaving
    through a crowded room/ I asked you to be my best friend, too/ And then I
    lose ya."" No, he doesn't forget ever, it seems.</p><p>
    
    But he rebounds soon enough with ""Silverline,"" which is largely responsible
    for the comparisons made between Ward and the influential, iconoclastic folk
    guitarist John Fahey, who died earlier this year. The blues-style track is a
    scorching, 12-string romp with subtle horns and deft guitarwork that's so
    aggressive as to make the listener imagine the ceaselessly vibrating strings
    being thwacked, pulled, and otherwise tweaked in a blurring manner. Although
    it's not nearly as irreverent and genre-bending as most of Fahey's work, it
    ends much too soon.</p><p>
    
    ""Flaming Heart"" holds the pace, opening with carnival-esque clanging in the
    background. A bluesy electric guitar and hall piano ramble in, over which
    Ward sings with a heretofore unseen alacrity. As if sensing that the raucous
    mood is almost too much to bear, Ward slows it down for ""Carolina."" One of
    the most straightforward tracks here, it opens with easy strumming and the
    clearly delivered lines, ""Oh, where are you going for the two-hundred and
    fiftieth time?"" Through a radio transistor, he responds, ""Well, I'm waiting
    for a sign."" It's the neat, unexpected turn you'd expect from Mark Linkous,
    and Ward keeps them coming throughout the song.</p><p>
    
    The comparison to Sparklehorse's lone creative force seems quite obvious, as
    both Linkous and Ward are country- and folk-influenced artists who scratch
    unavoidable, but nominally disruptive marks on the traditional blueprint. The
    major difference, as epitomized by ""From a Pirate Radio Sermon, 1989,"" is that
    Ward's effects exhibit better production. Giant Sand's Howe Gelb-- a big
    supporter of Ward's-- is another obvious signpost. Just listen to Ward's
    breathless delivery and erratic changes on ""Ella,"" which provides a piano
    quietude similar to that which dominated Giant Sand's most recent effort,
    last year's inimitable <i>The Chore of Enchantment</i>.</p><p>
    
    The seven-minute closer, ""O'Brien/O'Brien's Nocturne,"" solidifies Ward's
    singular voice-- both figuratively and literally. The first half is a
    stripped-down folk story about how ""O'Brien blew my mind."" Alone, it would
    have made for a great end, but it's improved upon with the instrumental second
    half, which evolves from a soft electric guitar and distant rumblings into a
    clear mix of thick and thin guitars, an urban drumbeat, and even some
    well-placed handclaps. This is what makes Ward's recollections worth hearing:
    in sound and word, he's intent on remembering the past, but he's too modern
    to let it define him.</p></div>"|8580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8580-end-of-amnesia/|7.6|Ryan Kearney

Don't let the
    black-and-white photo of an acoustic guitar on the album cover fool you; there's
    nothing acoustic about the guitars these guys play.  American Steel do not play
    pure, walloping punk (few bands really do) as much as they create a grotesque
    amalgam of past punk-related styles.  There's second-hand ska in ""Two Crooks,""
    emo flourishes just about everywhere, and a tendency toward incredibly deep,
    guttural guitar tones culled from the hardcore scene.  And the centerpiece of it
    all is the tortured voice of Ruauri, who apparently has no last name, as all
    attempts to research it bore no fruit.</p><p>
    
    Ruauri's voice is really like no other, though it seems obvious that he's
    listened to Joe Strummer's bizarre wail a few times.  You'll likely be able to
    locate a few distinct syllables strewn amongst his various moans and screams,
    and occasionally, whole words, or even whole lines will stand out.  But mostly,
    it's just the sound of a caterwauling mammal looking for a mate, or trying to
    find the key that the instruments are playing in.</p><p>
    
    For choruses, American Steel revert to the tried and true herding instinct,
    here applied as: ""If we all yell at the same time, one of us might hit the
    target note.""  And sometimes they do, but it fails to result in a single
    memorable chorus.  It takes a few times through to realize that they're not
    saying, ""Debbie works for all of us,"" in the opener, ""Shrapnel.""  Luckily, they
    repeat the chorus five times in the song, so it gradually becomes clear that
    they're just whipping out bullshit like, ""Jagged thoughts are all I've heard/
    Spitting shards of vitriol/ Jagged thoughts are all I've got/ Shredding my soul/
    Shrapnel!""  Apparently, all those jagged thoughts have cut to tattered shreds
    the parts of Ruauri's brain that allow him to form recognizable words.  The
    partially harmonized guitar solo and lethargic tempo drag the song kicking and
    screaming back to the 70s, and evoke the exact music that original punks rebelled
    against.</p><p>
    
    ""New Religion Every Day"" follows, offering no melody in the verse, but plenty of
    group shouting in the chorus.  The song initially evaded my radar more subtly
    than a Stealth bomber in Iraq, and when I finally forced myself to pay attention
    to it, I was struck only by its banality.  ""Rainy Day"" is supposed to be the
    power ballad, I think, but it has no melody-- only that same old tuneless
    wailing.  The completely unintelligible vocals don't help elaborate on the
    themes much, either.</p><p>
    
    ""There's a New Life"" finally kicks in the punk energy, and it works a little
    better than its predecessors, as a result.  It's also the shortest offering
    here, which scores it automatic points.   It's followed by ""Lonely All the
    Time,"" which seems to aspire toward traditional rock and roll, employing a
    barnacle-encrusted chord progression and a cute little organ to remind you of
    how quaint the song is.  ""Maria"" attempts roughly the same thing, with equally
    unimpressive results.  Ruauri mangles some little Mick Jagger vocal moves as the
    band establishes the molasses tempo.  The overused chords and annoying organ add
    to the overall impression that American Steel are attempting to morph into Bruce
    Springsteen, but instead of the punk <i>Nebraska</i>, we get the whole herd
    yelling, ""Maria, the moment is right!"" and a second-rate ""Born to Run.""</p><p>
    
    The album's second half is better than the first, but not by much.  ""Time Gone
    By"" is under two minutes of mediocre punk. ""Turn It Out"" overcomes its
    indiscernible verse with a decent, throwaway chorus, and the band sounds
    confident revisiting the ska-punk of their first two albums on ""Two Crooks.""
    Bassist John A. pulls out some impressive licks for ""Wake Up Alone,""  but
    they're lost in producer/engineer Kevin Army's trebly sonic soup.  After the
    decidedly un-punk sentiment of ""I Don't Mind,"" <i>Jagged Thoughts</i> stumbles
    to a close with the crusty progressions and abortive back-up harmonies of ""Day
    to Night (Like a Hint).""  The chorus is actually the least memorable part, which
    kind of defeats the purpose of even having a chorus.</p><p>
    
    The sad truth of the whole matter is that American Steel seem to make a genuine
    attempt to broaden their sound on <i>Jagged Thoughts</i>, and they completely
    fail.  The best moments, if they exist, are the throwbacks to their earlier
    work-- the rough punk and the pilfered ska.  All the noodly guitars and boring
    verses ultimately add up to something akin to a singed, one-eyed teddy bear:
    easy to pity, but hard to love.</p></div>"|164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/164-jagged-thoughts/|3.1|Joe Tangari

    how hard I try. One is the terrifying illustration of a long-nosed,
    green-skinned corpse that graced the pages of <i>In a Dark, Dark Room and
    Other Scary Stories</i>, a book my father read me in his best faux-Vincent
    Price voice, and led me to countless sleepless nights. Another is
    seventy-something Daevid Allen pulling off his skintight shorts, whipping out
    his cock, and playing with it-- a few inches away from my face.</p><p>
    
    How did I get into such a compromising situation?  It's probably not as
    interesting as you hoped. Basically, the Dylan Group and Marianne Nowottny
    were opening for the University of Errors. Tickets were cheap, the bill was
    pretty impressive, so I figured, what the hell. I got there a bit early,
    grabbed a seat up front, and waited. The Dylan Group and Marianne Nowottny
    were good, as expected. The real surprise of the evening came with Daevid
    Allen's thoroughly rocking set. Backed by a band of folks who looked like
    they ranged in age from 25 to 65, Allen turned out a surprisingly good set,
    complete with a hilarious ""prog-rock dance contest.""</p><p>
    
    And then came the encore. I had heard legends of Allen revealing his penis
    during ""My Penis is Aging,"" and sure enough, the song begins: ""My face is
    aging! My ass is aging! My penis... my penis! My penis?"" And with that, Mr.
    Allen whipped out a pair of bifocals, placed them on his face, and then
    whipped out... something else. He then concluded, ""My penis is <i>not</i>
    aging!"" How nice for him.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, I managed to come away from that show with a somewhat-varied
    set of memories. Some of the harder numbers Allen played, such as one which I
    believe was called ""Mysterio Fanatico,"" were quite excellent. I was hoping
    that <i>E^2 x 10 = Tenure</i> would be more of the same.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, it isn't. This is a painfully rambling, unfocused, and generally dull
    record. Considering that he's one of the few guys who can be quasi-accurately
    credited with inventing prog, one would think Allen has by this point figured
    out that being ""spacy"" just isn't enough. But the kind of bland, meandering
    music that's found on <i>E^2 x 10 = Tenure</i> suggests that this isn't the
    case.</p><p>
    
    The album begins promisingly enough-- a menacing minor chord segues into a
    fuzzy, goofy faux-dance beat. Spooky, ethereal guitars enter over the beat,
    generating a kind of bizarre tension that's never again recreated on the
    record.  Unfortunately, the album's second track, ""If You Are Changing,""
    hints at the kind of aimless, dull repetition that will mark the rest of the
    album. The most egregious offense comes with the 9+ minute ""Ocean Mother,"" in
    which Allen reads crappy beat-sounding poetry over sparse instrumentation.
    Sorry, gramps, but you can't pull that shit on us youngsters. We're on to
    you.</p><p>
<i>E^2 x 10 = Tenure</i> is not without its high points, though. ""Pinky's
    Party Song"" almost lives up to its title, rocking out as hard as anything
    else on the album. And even the album's worst tracks generally contain a few
    moments in which there is some semblance of a melody, a structure-- of some
    kind of development to push the song forward.</p><p>
    
    Odds are, I'll never be able to forget Daevid Allen. As long as I live, that
    only-slightly-expected penis will haunt me. I was hoping that <i>E^2 x 10 =
    Tenure</i> would be a memorable enough album that when I think ""Daevid Allen,""
    the immediate next thought wouldn't have to be ""old cock.""  But that is not
    the case. Nothing on this album is at all memorable enough to stick around in

    Quarterly Concern, took the interesting step of tapping They Might Be Giants
    to compose music inspired by the magazine's content, a CD of which they
    included in each copy. The people at Absalom Recordings have taken this a
    step further by eliminating all that unnecessary ironic print, leaving us
    with a subscription-based series of EPs by independent musicians.</p><p>
    
    Songs: Ohia's <i>Howler</i> is the first issue, as it were, to be followed
    every other month by the Czars, Howe Gelb, the Baptist Generals, Johnny Dowd
    and Calexico. The one-track, 3"" disc comes in a square cardboard gatefold
    sleeve the size of a beer coaster. But you probably wouldn't want to use it
    as such, since the cover is an eerie print of a creepy, Edvard Munch-inspired
    face that would probably freak you out after a couple of drinks.</p><p>
    
    The music tries to do the same, but even the best horror movies lose their
    edge after multiple viewings. Having heard last year's haunting <i>Ghost
    Tropic</i>, this EP ceases to raise my blood pressure. ""Howler"" is likewise
    spare and very, er... patient, but the song lacks authenticity. It sounds as
    though singer/songwriter Jason Molina has kept the same songwriting technique
    from his last full-length, but has relocated from deep within a tribal
    rainforest to the back of a deserted toy store in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p>
    
    That line would be a reference to the cheap, one-note toy synthesizer bursts
    that provide the song's backbone. And the baby that giggles two-thirds of the
    way through the 13-minute track. The rest is the same: a distant, reverberated
    guitar and Will Oldham's-- I mean, Jason Molina's broken, lonesome voice.
    Impossible to love, and impossible to hate, ""Howler"" is interesting only for
    the concept behind it.</p></div>"|7335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7335-howler-ep/|5.0|Ryan Kearney

    sixth and latest studio album appears to be a contradiction in terms. The
    paradoxical concept of something being both ancient and futuristic is the
    kind of idea usually left to people like Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., or Stephen
    Hawking, or rock bands who haven't a clue about that sort of thing and figure
    it sounds like a good title.  Or it could be suggesting that the trio have
    prematurely and confidently declared a new landmark by which all future
    melodic guitar rock acts will ultimately be inspired.</p><p>
    
    But our faithful indie-turned-major guitar hero Doug Martsch and his friends
    aren't pompous, and they're more clever than all that. The title <i>Ancient
    Melodies of the Future</i> signifies nothing more than the music of the
    present. The future's ancient melodies are being made as we speak. It's the
    perfect heading for Martsch's latest set of beautiful, unencumbered,
    unpretentious melodies. It leaves these songs to speak for themselves as they
    exist now, rendering comparisons, projections and superlatives practically
    unnecessary.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there are comparisons to make, but Martsch and company have built
    up a large enough body of work to make the only worthwhile comparisons those
    pertaining to their previous work. Fully absent is the sprawling melodic
    scope that 1997's <i>Perfect from Now On</i> demonstrated for the first time
    and that 1999's <i>Keep It like a Secret</i> compressed into chewable tablets.
    But unlike these two previous records, <i>Ancient Melodies of the Future</i>
    rarely strays from traditional pop structures. Melodies and chord progressions
    are kept simple, sweet, and relatively short-- it's the closest they've come
    to the sound of their indie pop breakthrough, <i>There's Nothing Wrong with
    Love</i>, since that album's 1994 release.</p><p>
    
    Two things keep <i>Ancient Melodies of the Future</i> from becoming a time
    trap back to the Up Records days of the mid-90's. One is Martsch and Phil
    Ek's production technique.  From <i>There's Nothing Wrong with Love</i> to
    <i>Perfect from Now On</i>, Martsch and Ek suddenly transformed the Built to
    Spill sound from garage pop to atmospheric, almost orchestral guitar rock.
    That majestic, deeply textured sound has remained more or less intact since,
    even with their rock opera-size epics cut in half on recent outings.</p><p>
    
    The second aspect of the band's current state of evolution is their steady
    rhythm section lineup. Since <i>Perfect from Now On</i>, Brett Nelson and
    Scott Plouf have remained irreplaceable, vital support for Martsch's
    six-string virtuosity. Nelson's basslines anchor each song in the traditional
    rock sense while still maintaining a playful spider-fingers style, sliding
    and jumping across the frets only when truly appropriate. Plouf, formerly of
    the Spinanes, is a by-the-numbers, solid drummer, more often than not opting
    for steady intensity and subtle flourishes in lieu of bombastic fills.</p><p>
    
    One of the standout tracks from <i>Ancient Melodies</i>, ""In Your Mind,"" most
    impressively showcases the supporting players' abilities to collaborate and
    gel with Martsch's own rhythms and melodies. Martsch's acoustic guitar
    provides the heavy cadence at first, then Nelson's bass starts with the same
    progression and Plouf accompanies the two with a single floor-tom downbeat.
    As the track shifts and soars, the instrumentation flourishes with synths
    and guitars, both forward and reversed.  Nelson and Plouf adapt masterfully,
    selectively adding more versatile complexities to their parts.  Meanwhile,
    Martsch explores dark, yet vague and enigmatic lyrical themes-- obsession and
    mind-reading, as far as this listener can tell-- to compliment the effective,
    foreboding, Eastern-tinged melody: ""And no one can tell me what's right/
    'Cause nobody has my permission/ And no one can see what's in your mind.""</p><p>
    
    Half of the tracks on <i>Ancient Melodies</i> are somewhat downtempo ballads,
    and the sequence is well chosen to weave these more sentimental songs amidst
    the presence of their equally effective rock counterparts. Placing the record's
    softest folk ballad, ""The Weather,"" as the closing track, may be a bit
    predictable, but Martsch's conviction is well executed amongst reversed steel
    guitars: ""As long as it's talking with you/ Talk of the weather will do.""
    Likewise, ""Trimmed and Burning"" features a slightly twisted love ballad theme
    in its melody and lyrics (""I'd agreed to always love you/ But never enough to
    set you free""), justified by layered, meaty Southern riffs which render such
    candied sentiments insignificant.</p><p>
    
    Keyboards are more prominent than ever on this record, with glorious
    Mellotrons and other analogs embellishing Martsch's multi-tracked guitars.
    In fact, guest Sam Coomes adorns the gorgeously gleeful opening track,
    ""Strange,"" with his Quasi trademark instrument, the Rocksichord.  Its tinny,
    antique sting kicks off ""Strange"" with a simple major-chord progression that
    leads into one of Martsch's best melodic turns to date.  It also offers some
    of Martsch's most lucidly poetic lyrics yet, continuing his fascination with
    the oddest qualities of communication: ""This strange sound you said I said/
    You're not listening, or I'm not saying it right/ This strange war of
    promises/ Let's call us a truce, we'll call it the truth.""</p><p>
    
    Built to Spill may not have been aiming for high stakes when they called
    their record <i>Ancient Melodies of the Future</i>. In fact, the title could
    be looked at with a sense of resignation, with the knowledge that while the
    band may still have some music in store for us in the not-too-distant future,
    it ends eventually, and all they are will become ancient and perhaps forgotten.
    While this may be true, we prefer to optimistically count on the band's legacy
    and melodies to live on into the future, even after their songs and selves
    have become ancient.</p></div>"|1015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1015-ancient-melodies-of-the-future/|8.6|Spencer Owen

Let's get the comparisons going right off the bat. Spiral
    Stairs has been second banana to the guy for a career now. He added the
    occasional song to Pavement's albums in a suitably nasal style that blended
    in well-- usually a nice poppy or jammy number of good quality. Sure, you
    might have wondered how the guy would do on his own, but my bet is, if you're
    interested in this band, you've got S&amp;M;'s solo record already and are just
    itching to play musical Battlebots.  It's not right, though, comparing an EP
    to a full-length. Whatever long-played Stairs and Co. come up with may be far
    more masterful than this, and may shed the lesser tracks. Perhaps I should
    compare this to the <i>Discretion Grove</i> EP. Life is unfair, however, and
    I never got <i>Discretion Grove</i>, so I'm going to compare the apple and
    the orange, because I think it'll show some problems with this work.  Verdict:
    Malkmus kicks Preston School of Industry square in the ass.</p><p>
    
    Mr. Malkmus wanted to call his post-Pavement band the Jicks. Someone at
    Matador said, hey, it's got to be Stephen Malkmus. Such is the price of name
    recognition. Personally, I think this was a mistake. I think those that like
    Pavement are a smart bunch and would figure out who the Jicks were. It's a
    good name.  ""Malkmus"" does not roll triplingly off the tongue, after all, and
    may have saturated all its crossover appeal. Now Spiral Stairs, there's a cool
    name (albeit snatched from the late 60's pop group Spiral Starecase)-- one
    this guy still goes by. Nonetheless, he's calling this act the Preston School
    of Industry, one of the worst bandnames ever-- one that doesn't just beg for
    obscurity, but one I confuse with that Panoply Academy Corps of Engineers,
    or whatever they're calling themselves these days. It's also written just in
    initials on the cover, which suggests, to my dorkish self, ""P'soi,"" the name
    of some imagined character from Anne McCaffrey's <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i>
    series.</p><p>
    
    Now we get to the songs. ""Something Happens Always"" charges in with some
    pretty unimaginative two-note pop horns interlocking with sunny, whistling
    keyboards, and ends with some bass trills and what sounds like kids singing.
    Musically, though, it works.  Somehow.  It's bouncy.  The lyrics are another
    matter; Stairs spins a very awkwardly portrait of a midlife crisis.  When he
    sings, ""I've got an allegory heart,"" as the song's effective chorus, he's
    overlooking an essential tenet of rock lyricism: never say ""I've got an
    allegory heart."" Other phrases from high school comp. which are good to
    avoid: ""This is a metaphor""; ""The end of innocence""; ""Man's inhumanity
    towards his fellow man""; and ""Insert comma here.""</p><p>
    
    ""How to Impress the Goddess Pt. 2"" throws some slow cello over a distorted
    guitar phrase similar to David Bowie's ""DJ,"" a similarity this song quickly
    departs from.  It's another ""Ballad of a Thin Man""-- a mining man family
    slaughter-type yarn, and one Stairs can't fully bring to life. He needs at
    least one more key detail to make the story real, and ""what does that save
    happiness"" chorus does little to illuminate, not even bothering to throw up
    its hands at the absurdity and cruelty of life. To its credit, the song does
    have a nice guitar jam-out at the end.</p><p>
    
    Also nice is ""The Spaces In Between,"" a near-instrumental that tells more of
    a real story in its one line of lyric than the first two songs combined.
    Musically, it bounces like a Chinese league-level ping-pong match, with sunny
    bleeps skipping over a simple, happy keyboard phrase and some arty Adrian
    Belew type fretwork. A blast.</p><p>
    
    Stairs also wrests some real emotions from the minimal lyrics of ""Where You
    Gonna Go?,"" a sleepy song of loss with lazy slide guitars over a sweetly
    plucked, swelling jangle of acoustic guitars, underlaid with the sound of
    Spiral groaning.  The EP's title song then rides that acoustic sound out to
    close the record on a sweet if unmemorable note.</p><p>
    
    There's nothing embarrassing about the Preston School of Industry, except
    perhaps its name. The songs are pleasant enough, though we'll hope for now
    that Stairs will have better ones on his full-length.  Still, have you heard
    Malkmus' record? ""The Hook?"" ""Jenny and the Ess-Dog?"" Of course you have.</p></div>"|6461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6461-goodbye-to-the-edge-city-ep/|6.8|Dan Kilian

Once, when I was in kindergarten, my mom pulled me
    out of school in the middle of the day because there was strep throat going
    around. I hated the doctor and I was sad. But it turned out that, even though
    I had no outward symptoms, I actually did have strep throat. So I got to miss
    several days of school, without even feeling like shit. And I got a lollipop.</p><p>
    A few months ago, facing an ever-building amount of credit card debt, I swore
    off new CDs. I would live off the bare minimum of necessary funds-- a BLT
    sandwich for lunch, store-bought macaroni and cheese for dinner, and other
    various living expenses. About three days into my resolution, I received a
    weekly ""new releases"" e-mail from a certain oh-so-hip record store here in
    New York. I figured there was no harm in looking through-- there were no
    releases coming out that week that I was slobbering for, and I figured it
    would be relatively safe. Halfway through the e-mail, nothing in particular
    had struck me. And then I came upon a description that piqued my interest: a
    description of a warm, highly melodic album that featured both acoustic and
    electronic instruments. From Iceland! Against my better judgment, I clicked
    on a link to a 30-second RealAudio clip.</p><p>
    The next morning, I woke up early, haphazardly threw on pants, and hopped on
    a train to said hipster haven. And there it was. Múm's <i>Yesterday Was
    Dramatic - Today Is OK</i>. I was out the door within a minute. I got home,
    yanked all the phones out of the wall jacks, put the CD into my stereo, lay
    back on my bed, and pressed the play button with my big toe. And the result
    was quite possibly my most pleasant surprise since Kindergarten.</p><p>
    As the description that originally drew me into this album had pointed out,
    <i>Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK</i> relies heavily on both electronic
    sounds and acoustic instrumentation. While the album consists mostly of cut-up
    beats and synthesized melodies, harmonica, glockenspiel, and occasional
    whispered vocals make appearances as well, resulting in a varied and
    texturally rich record.</p><p>
    While texture is plentiful, and certainly helps make <i>Yesterday Was Dramatic -
    Today Is OK</i> such an amazing album, what really seals it for me is the
    melody. This album is simply bursting with gorgeous ones, penetrating the
    dense background and making it one of the most deeply, purely emotionally
    affecting albums of the year.  Listening to this album is an experience that
    defies any description aside from ""sublime and gorgeous.""</p><p>
    One of the album's many highlights, and the track that got me into this whole
    thing in the first place, is ""There is a Number of Small Things,"" perhaps the
    most astonishingly beautiful track to be found here. Church bells, child-like
    vocals, and strings of achingly beautiful synthesized melodies make the track
    nothing short of perfect.  Here, as with the rest of the album, Múm's mastery
    of sonic texture plays a pivotal role in making the track such a success. From
    the start of the album, it's not entirely clear what sounds are being
    synthesized and what sounds are being drawn from traditional instruments--
    and from the start of the album, it doesn't matter. <i>Yesterday Was Dramatic -
    Today Is OK</i> is such an easy album to get lost in.  The source of the
    sound makes no difference when the sound itself is so well phrased and
    immersive.</p><p>
    I feel strange putting the experience of listening to <i>Yesterday Was Dramatic -
    Today Is OK</i> into words. While the album is certainly sonically complex,
    the sounds seem to come so naturally that any kind of attempt to explain them
    just wouldn't do the record justice. While the presence of such a seamlessly
    beautiful album is impressive, it seems nothing short of amazing that four
    unknown middle-class kids from Iceland managed to put it together. So I owe
    the credit card bastards another $20. Big deal. Surprises this good just don't
    come around that often.</p></div>"|5502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5502-yesterday-was-dramatic-today-is-ok/|9.1|Matt LeMay

    them are pretty damn obnoxious when it comes to talking about the band.  The
    largely unheard Aussie trio has garnered a following that makes up for its
    small size with heaping portions of reverence.  Their website, for example,
    includes cute little inside features, like the Top 5 Lucksmiths songs, as
    voted by the fans.  Like Belle and Sebastian circa 1996-97 (who had a similar
    feature on their website), the Lucksmiths are practically personal property to
    their fanbase; they are the small ""cult"" band that the 15-year-old in all of
    us hordes and keeps for ourselves.</p><p>
    
    I apologize to all Lucksmiths fans for making strides to out their greatness.
    The band is simply worthy of the myriad cappuccino cups of mouth foam that
    their rabid following has bestowed.  I'll risk all-out exploitation, by deeming
    them worthy of even a larger fanbase, even though their sixth (proper) album,
    <i>Why That Doesn't Surprise Me</i>, isn't much of a departure for them, or
    music in general.   Bands like Felt, Field Mice, and, most recently, Belle and
    Sebastian have forged, realized, and revisited the sunny terrain of twee
    guitar-pop that the Lucksmiths play on.  The band is utterly content in
    presenting simple, catchy love songs that make no waves to innovate.  And
    that's fine, because they're damn good at it.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps an even more appropriate description of the Lucksmiths sound is found
    in the title of <i>Surprise Me</i>'s opening track, ""Music to Hold Hands To.""
    One could do little more than sway to the cleanly produced, mid-tempo gem, but
    as drummer/vocalist Tali White explains, ""Sometimes something you can dance to/
    Is the last thing that you need.""  The album's most infectious track, ""Self
    Preservation,"" is frenetically jangly, and bolstered by stuttering, punchy
    drums.  And it's about breaking up.  During the unforgettable chorus, a
    celebration of horns joins in, and White only seems happier, singing, ""And
    whatever comes next/ If we leave the nest/ Don't settle for less than what
    we've got.""  This optimistic take on the potentially maudlin territory of
    Splitsville is immediately endearing-- much more so than the similarly themed,
    humdrum piano ballad ""All the Recipes I've Ever Ruined.""</p><p>
    
    While we've heard all this guitar-pop stuff before, it's through their lyrics
    that the Lucksmiths make their distinct mark.  Guitarist Marty Donald, bassist
    Mark Monnone, and White all write songs, and they're all brimming with
    cleverness.  Monnone evokes Billy Bragg's ability to make the mundane witty
    in ""Don't Bring Your Work to Bed.""  In ""First Cousin,"" White's imagery is
    first-rate in confessions like, ""You were like a storm that I could talk to.""
    And Donald (who wrote the bulk of the songs here) is so cunning that his
    wordplay sometimes goes overboard; in ""Synchronized Sinking,"" he writes, ""Why
    don't you let go of your boy and see/ You've lost none of your buoyancy?""
    But I'll take flagrant wordsmith pride over triteness any day.  The fact that
    <i>Why That Doesn't Surprise Me</i> comes almost four years after the last
    Lucksmiths album makes sense: this sort of intelligence takes time to filter
    into meter and rhythm.</p><p>
    
    Because it's so consistently and remarkably enjoyable, <i>Why That Doesn't
    Surprise Me</i> has the right to become the Lucksmiths' breakthrough, their
    <i>The Boy With the Arab Strap</i>, if you will.  Drive-In Records, of course,
    is no Matador as far as distribution goes, and it's doubtful that the band
    will ever gain a following larger than the one they already have.  So, the
    tried-and-true fans should be content in the fact that they're right, now more
    than ever.  As for the rest of the world, just know that <i>Why That Doesn't
    Surprise Me</i> is the most entertaining Australian export since Nad's Hair
    Removal System.  Delicious!</p></div>"|4906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4906-why-that-doesnt-surprise-me/|8.0|Richard M. Juzwiak

    thought.  It's not necessarily the production, musicianship, or lyrics
    that cause horrible music to happen; the core of the problem comes
    much earlier.  At some point, a musician, producer or label employee thinks,
    ""Hey, what if...?""  And if there had only been someone there to just shout a
    resounding ""no,"" we'd be spared a good deal of horrible music.  Hey, what if
    Puff Daddy reworked ""Kashmir"" for <i>Godzilla</i>?  No.  What if Mya, Pink,
    and Lil Kim covered ""Lady Marmalade?""  No.  ""Hey, fellow members of Alien Ant
    Farm, what if we covered Michael Jackson?""  No.  ""Johnny, it's Jello.  After
    you finish up <i>Benny &amp; Joon</i>, let's start a band with Flea.""  No.
    ""Disney, it's Tricky.  I was thinking of doing duets with Cyndi Lauper,
    Anthony Kiedis, and the guy from Live.  Oh, and this Jamaican rapper is going
    to cover Nirvana."" No, No, No, please god, No.</p><p>
    For the sake of keeping that sentence short I didn't even mention the song
    with John Frusciante, ""1 Da Woman,"" in which the Chili Peppers guitarist
    wah-wahs the theme to Linda Carter's ""Wonder Woman"" while belting ""Yooooou
    show me everything/ Yooooou feel me everywhere.""  So just as horrible music
    could, at times, be preempted in its brainstorming stage, so too can record
    reviews hopefully deter consumers with basic description.</p><p>
    Lately, Tricky has just been loaded with terrible ideas.  On his recent Epitaph
    EP, the smoke-breathing, lizard-larynxed visionary sang Peter Gabriel's ""Big
    Time"" over tepid breakbeats.  What makes it sting so much more is that Tricky
    truly created some of the most original music of the 1990s.  He gave us a
    sultry chanteuse singing a brilliant tabla-punk cover of Public Enemy. ""Yoga""
    and ""Headphones"" remain two of the most haunting, head-humping songs in Björk's
    catalogue.  ""Vent"" hypnotized by merely stacking drunken drumrolls.  Even the
    under-rated <i>Angels with Dirty Faces</i> took black psychedelia to new
    peaks.</p><p>
    And here, it's important to note the critics' role in ruining Tricky. <i>Angels
    with Dirty Faces</i> was roundly shat upon on its release.  I venture to say
    that this is because its heroin menace didn't gel with critical preconceptions
    of where trip-hop, and the I-was-just-in-<i>The Fifth Element</i> Tricky,
    should go.  Here was Bristol music that sounded very boutique-unfriendly.
    But Tricky had left trip-hop in the dust.  Never one to take criticism lightly
    (he beat the sweet bejesus out of a critic backstage at a concert once), Tricky
    then got it into his head that he should become some sort of rap-pop
    revolutionary.  Each release since <i>Angels</i> has come coated in studio
    sheen and radio-reaching thump.</p><p>
<i>Blowback</i>, Tricky's Hollywood debut, in every sense of the word, offers
    crisp snippets of bass-heavy garbage bookended by some fantastic, hope-breathing
    songs, ""Excess"" and ""Song for Yukiko.""  The first single, ""Evolution Revolution
    Love,"" would be tolerable if-- and this is a monumental ""if""-- Live's Ed
    Kowalczyk wasn't chanting, ""Let me take it to tha mic.""  That nasally,
    quasi-spiritual tart should be issued fatwas, not allowed near microphones.
    Literally, <i>anybody</i> else-- Jeff Lynne, Jeremy Dupree, Lil Romeo, Carnie
    Wilson, Graham Smith, Corin Tucker-- would serve the song better.</p><p>
    Anthony Kiedis' appearance is inherently awful, but closer attention reveals
    even more misguided atrocities.  Tricky starts the Chili Peppered rock number
    barking, ""I've never seen my dad, boy,"" a sentiment that, from the mouth
    and mind of Tricky, seems rather genuine and revealing.  Kiedis, however,
    supplements this in the only misguided, testes-soaked way he knows: by singing
    ""step into the sun"" and rapping, ""Rabble-rousers, I'm poppin' blouses/ Shake
    it for me, baby, let me step into your trousers/ I-I-I-I-I-I-I allow this/
    Come on, baby, let me take it to your houses.""</p><p>
    ""You Don't Wanna"" showcases the respectable pipes of Topley-Bird replacement
    Ambersunshower, but Tricky offers a cheap-keyboard musical bed stolen from the
    Eurythmics' attic.  Surprisingly, Cyndi Lauper's appearance on ""Five Days""
    makes for one of the better tracks, but one that Tricky would loathe to know
    heavily reminds this listener of Massive Attack.  The numerous tracks with
    Jamaican dancehall bullfrog, Hawkman, rise above the celebrity help, but in
    this post-multi-platinum-Shaggy era, when ""It Wasn't Me"" infests from every
    Subway Sandwiches P.A., the edibility of said tracks remain questionable.
    Plus, there's that god-awful cover of Nirvana's ""Something in the Way,"" which
    sounds like Shaggy bellowing ""it ok ta eet fish kuss they doan have any
    feeeee-lun"" over something Martin Gore programmed in 1982.  Carbon monoxide
    is better for you.</p><p>
    At this point, Tricky seems forever lost.  The best songs on <i>Blowback</i>
    simply sound like radio-marinated <i>Maxinquaye</i>.  In a recent <i>NME</i>
    interview Tricky boasts that <i>Blowback</i> even betters <i>Maxinquaye</i>,
    which he now finds to be weak and Sneaker Pimp-like, an argument which could
    easily be leveled at half the songs here. He advertises that this is music
    that has been ""completely unheard of.""  If only that were the case.  If only
    Goofy had leaned into the mic on the mixing board, looked Tricky in his
    ganja-shuttered eyes through the studio glass, and said, ""No.""</p></div>"|8155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8155-blowback/|3.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

Now, I'm no expert on the mechanics of the     human psyche, but I've managed to piece together a semblance of expertise     from horoscopes, radio call-in shows, <i>The Sopranos</i>, and the smattering     of Freud I was forced to read as an undergrad (not to mention the invaluable     contribution of my own mental shortcomings-- fuck my mother, indeed!). Sure,     it doesn't add up to a diploma on the wall of my office, but it gives me the     authority to comment liberally on the emotional well-being of friends and     co-workers. Impressive credentials? No shit.</p>
<p>Avey Tare and Panda Bear are undergoing what real psychologists call     regression-- that is, a return to a more developmentally immature level of     mental functioning. The Animal collective has always evinced a juvenile     sensibility, but a line needs to be drawn. There's a difference between     playful, spirited getting-in-touch-with-your-inner-child juvenalia and the     less wholesome pants-crapping juvenalia.  And between Tare and Bear's last     effort, the radically inspired <i>Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've     Vanished</i>, and this year's <i>Danse Manatee</i>, our patients have moved     unmistakably from the former to the latter.</p>
<p>While <i>Spirit</i> freely colored outside the lines in its pursuit of beauty,     <i>Manatee</i> is the musical equivalent of paste-eating. The addition of a     third Animal, the Geologist, on keyboards seems to have eviscerated their     candy-coated noise-pop rather than augmenting it. Gone are the stylized     mod-pop mannerisms, the fevered rhythm guitar, the Daltrey-esque yowls, and     the sweet-and-sour lyrics; in their place we find Speak N' Spell vocals,     hyperactive clatter, and the single-minded pursuit of the most irritating     sounds imaginable.</p>
<p>The bleepy electronic sylvania of the opening track, ""A Manatee Dance,"" is     momentarily intriguing, but soon passes into the explosive ""Penguin Penguin""     (the titles are a dead giveaway). ""Penguin"" submerges the largely tuneless     vocals beneath a thick cacophony of symbol crash, bubbling noise and cricket     chirping. ""Another White Singer (Little White Glove)"" possesses a kind of a     sparse tribal funk, sustained by Panda's deep forest bongos, but Avey's     vocals are shredded and torturous. ""Essplode"" is one of the highlights of     <i>Manatee</i>, recalling the deftly catchy pop experimentalism of <i>Spirit</i>,     as well as the organic drum-n-bass lines that dominated the former release.     But ""Essplode"" is still shot through with the high-pitch squealing of which     those Animal boys can't seem to get enough.</p>
<p>""Runnin' the Round Ball"" is the album's strongest track and the only one that     justifies the frequent comparison to Can and Amon Düül II. It's a thumping,     motorized little romp, accented by breathing synths, baby whines, and frenetic     glitchcraft. Unfortunately, it's one of the album's briefest tracks, and its     incredibly percussive thrust is cut short before it really comes to any     fruition. There's also a certain genius in the later track, ""Throwin' the     Round Ball"" (round ball fixation = bedwetting, I'm told), a kind of cut-up     pastoral of tinkling organs, spliced with odd, broken-sounding vocals,     thunderous rumbling, and violent shreds of noise. The throb and chant of     ""Ahh, Good Country"" is also oddly compelling, reminiscent of the rustic     psychedelia of Flying Saucer Attack and the ecstatic primitivism of Hochenkeit.     But aside from the few bright experiments, <i>Danse Manatee</i> is mostly     intolerable make-believe. It's like having an imaginary friend you simply     can't stand.</p>
<p>So, let's say the ideal of all progressive music is Freud's phallic phase:     ""Wow, this feels good when I touch it! I'll just keep doing it.""  Then,     <i>Danse Manatee</i> might be located firmly in Freud's anal phase: ""Mommy,     look what I made!"" But we must try to be reassuring. After all, <i>Pitchfork</i> has never been in the business of invalidating feelings.  So, boys, we're not     mad, just bitterly disappointed. And even the stinkiest dump provides an     occasion for personal growth.  Besides, Avey Tare, Panda Bear and the Geologist     are always entitled to seek a second opinion. But before they do that, they     should know that some kid I met at a party last week pretty much confirmed     my whole diagnosis. And he was almost a psych minor.</p></div>"|7941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7941-danse-manatee/|3.9|Brent S. Sirota

And to those who say it's the new rock and roll-- at
    least compared to the spineless alternadultery on the radio these days-- I concur.  The hip-hop artist is
    best posed for stardom right now, free to be the mouthpiece of a community or the avatar of a corporate
    brand.  Proof: now rock comes to rap.  Jimmy Page and Dave Navarro are Bad Boy Entertainment bitches!</p><p>
    
    Like the nation from which it rises, though, hip-hop has a divisive population.  Back in the 80s, artists
    had to stick together to defend against Tipper and the righteous crusade to save America from horny skits
    and prankster emcees.  But the scene grew larger, and then the danger came from within: first from gangster
    rap's revision of the civil war, east coast to west, then from the luster of the Cristal-sipping bling-bling.
    Now, a new threat's come to town.  Who is this disrespectful outlaw?  One man and his instrumental hip-hop
    album.</p><p>
    
    At least you'd think so, from the biters on the message boards dissing this
    guy before they've even listened to the album.  Prefuse 73 is Atlanta's Scott
    Herren, also known by his other projects Delarosa and Asora and Savath +
    Savalas.  On <i>Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives</i>, Herren has stirred
    controversy with his talent in the studio for sampling raps and turning them
    into the rhythmic instruments of his songs by chopping, fading and looping.
    Consequently, the Prefuse project got accused of disrespecting the role of
    the real MC.  Nevermind that the results sound like record-scratching anyway,
    I can't believe anyone would freak after hearing how incredibly mack this
    shit sounds.</p><p>
    
    White noise and sketchy DJ patter introduce ""Radio Attack,"" panning from
    channel to channel like trying to tune in your favorite underground show
    across the unreliable airwaves.  Then the frequency locks in and the groove
    asserts itself, mixing anthemic keyboards with lo-fi beats that lock up and
    reload again, always twice as funky.  It's a pocket symphony, and it's only
    the introduction to the album.  But things really get rolling with ""Nuno,"" as
    female R&amp;B; clips start to dialogue with fragments of male raps.  And Herren
    isn't just interested in juxtaposing samples; the beats thump hard like Mary
    J. Blige's ""Real Love.""</p><p>
    
    Herren's love supreme for hip-hop unfolds before your ears as you listen to
    these songs.  The sublime basslines and synths call to mind DJ Shadow's
    <i>Endtroducing...</i> since the two share a devotion to simple, organic
    development.  Don't expect the abstractions into critical theory the title
    suggests; this is no DJ Spooky thesis.  And you won't find any Shadow-esque
    ambient passages, either, because the constant vocal chatter keeps the flow
    upbeat.  Songs develop in a logical progression that still manages to
    surprise, like Tortoise's ""Djed,"" and as tones shift off into spectrums of
    chrome and brass you're reminded occasionally of Oval's treatment of those
    post-rockers.  With vibraphones ringing and keyboards humming there's also a
    serious <i>Midnight Marauders</i>-era Tribe Called Quest tip going on.</p><p>
    
    Any remaining doubts about Herren's fealty to the state of hip-hop are
    destroyed when you listen to the vocalists left untouched.  MF Doom and
    Aesop Rock of the Def Jux label maintain the guard on ""Blacklist.""  As a
    cool-jazz period piano tinkles they chide, ""'I can stop any time I want to'/
    Famous last words that came back to haunt you/ All your life like permanent
    dry tears.""  Freestyle Fellowship vet Mikah 9's flow on ""Life/Death"" sounds
    digitally warped at first until you realize it's just his own arpeggiated
    delivery.  And who's that crooning Maxwell-style on ""Last Night?""  You
    wouldn't guess on first listen that it's indie-scenester Sam Prekop, but his
    light touch fits the head-nodding groove perfectly.</p><p>
    
    Hesitation makes sense-- Scott Herren isn't African-American.  Blacks have
    been central to the creation of the most unique music of the 20th century,
    from blues to jazz to rock and roll, and have seen Elvis-style cultural
    appropriation in each case.  But the skipped-and-flipped vocal devices
    Herren makes use of also have a history, from scat to freestyle, and he's
    paying respect.  Repeat: the hip-hop nation is not under attack.  Prefuse 73
    reimagines the genre in a collage of half-remembered rhymes and hazy static,
    letting us in on a dialogue with his soul.  Through his fusion of hip-hop and
    soul music with electronica's current passion for the blip, he's also painted
    a portrait of the peculiar state of our urbanity.  The bomb he's dropped will
    resonate outwards, hopefully even shaking up P. Diddy a little as he chills
    in the suburbs, per his recent video, trying like hell to keep it real.</p></div>"|6448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6448-vocal-studies-uprock-narratives/|8.7|Christopher Dare

Critics
    listen and write, readers read and consider.  Over time, a regular reader of
    a publication finds a commonality of opinion with one or two reviewers; their
    notions of what's good or bad converge more often than the other hacks.  Trust
    is formed-- they bond.  It's interactive and symbiotic.  We're the parasites;
    you're the hosts.  Those of you who buy into the idea of the officially
    sanctioned <i>Pitchfork</i> opinion (or a uniform opinion of any publication)
    are missing the point.  For the most part, editors are too busy to be worrying
    about homogeneity of judgment.</p><p>
    
    Which is what allows me to disagree so significantly with my colleague Mr.
    Sandlin who reviewed Clem Snide's previous offering to the world, <i>Your
    Favorite Music</i>, last year.  Did Clem Snide really go from putting out a
    2.1 album to a 7.0?  Of course not.  Issues of the relevance of numerical
    ratings aside, all this demonstrates is that there's a spectrum of taste
    operating here.  Individuals, with biases and preferences.  I'd have rated
    <i>Your Favorite Music</i> higher; Michael would (I'd wager) come up shorter
    on <i>The Ghost of Fashion</i>.  Somewhere in between lies the truth.  Just
    ask Kurosawa.</p><p>
    
    On their third full-length, Clem Snide gracefully boxstep between the cynicism
    and genuine wonder they stumbled over before.  Approaching this music with a
    cynical ear exaggerates that aspect, and the music becomes insufferable.
    Come at it too naively, and you'll miss the occasional evil lines smuggled
    into the songs.  A musical tightrope.  <i>The Ghost of Fashion</i> is a
    perfect example of getting out of a listening experience what you invest in
    it.</p><p>
    
    Clem Snide show signs that they've matured beyond aiming for nothing more
    ambitious than a clever pun, and that they're no longer satisfied with the
    predictable song construct.  Instead, their new goal is to just make good
    music.  They no longer beg to be the center of attention; they just are.
    Plenty of changes are apparent even on the first listen.  The music sacrifices
    a bit of the band's old country leanings for more traditional indie pop.  Eef
    Barzelay's muppety vocals seem less smarmy and more heartfelt.  The
    musicianship is more accomplished, and overall, the songs sound less contrived
    and more spontaneous.</p><p>
    
    Like the band, these songs evolve.  They go somewhere.  ""Don't Be Afraid of
    your Anger"" metamorphs from its swaying dirge intro to an Acuff/Rose ramble.
    ""Moment in the Sun"" ends in a ""Baba O'Riley"" frenzy after beginning with a
    cornfed Southern rock mid-tempo jangle.  Elsewhere, ""Long Lost Twin"" provides
    perfect fiesta music for a warm summer evening on the patio, under the string
    lights.  Mariachi horns contribute the appropriate touch of sadness needed to
    buoy lyrics that pine, ""The sea of taillights that we all must swim/ Tonight
    I feel like Elvis longing for his long lost twin/ Clean up the mess that Eve
    and Adam got us in.""  But the best evidence of the band's rapid, time-lapse
    development is found in the hymnal ""The Curse of Great Beauty.""  The song
    provides an unexpected goosebump moment on the disc, before blending into the
    chimy, organic doodling that begins the waltz ""Joan Jett of Arc.""</p><p>
    
    Musically-sound but an eye-roller lyrically, the string of puns in ""Joan Jett""
    triggers a series of misfires, beginning with the next track, the aimless,
    indulgent and poorly-constructed ""The Junky Jews.""  Through the peaceful, but
    barely-there ""Ancient Chinese Secret Blues,"" and the brief throwaway track,
    ""The Ballad of Unzer Charlie,"" the last quarter of the album feels like a
    cheap Wal-Mart mountain bike slipping out of gear when pedaled too hard, and
    they lose the momentum they'd clearly worked hard to build up.</p><p>
    
    However, ""No One's More Happy than You"" closes things on a positive note.  The
    song-vignette begins with a majestic blurt of horns and Eef's best mimicry of
    Stipe at his drawliest.  ""A beautiful Hackensack night/ Two teenagers kiss and
    hold tight/ The satellite swimming above/ Is sending a message of love.""
    You'll never convince me that Camper Van Beethoven's similar ""Life is Grand""
    is secretly mocking me, and I don't accept that Barzelay's sentiment here is
    anything but sincere.</p><p>
    
    In the end, with the flaws weighed against gems on the balances that are this
    reviewer's ears, <i>The Ghost of Fashion</i> represents only a few steps up
    the ladder for Barzelay and Snide, not an escalator ascent to the top.  But
    at least they're climbing.  They're definitely climbing.</p></div>"|1501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1501-the-ghost-of-fashion/|7.0|John Dark

    year. Or so you'd think, judging from the anonymous TV ad men and women who
    proclaim, ""Summer is here! Get your [insert iced drink here] now!""-- whereas
    in the winter, they regret to inform us that it's time to brace ourselves with
    a new Burlington coat. And TV is just an exaggerated reflection of ourselves;
    the hordes of convertibles making the weekend pilgrimage to the nearest beach
    are proof enough. Vitamin D overdoses abound.</p><p>
    
    If my tone isn't suggestive enough, then I'll say it flat out: I hate the
    summer. It is, in my opinion, the worst season of the year. Sure, it's great
    for holidays, work vacations, and ogling the underdressed opposite sex, but
    you pay for this in sweat, which comes by the quart, even if you obey summer's
    central directive: be lazy. Then there's the traffic, both pedestrian and
    automobile, and those unavoidable, unbearable Hollywood blockbusters and TV
    reruns (or second-rate series). Not to mention those package music tours.</p><p>
    
    But perhaps worst of all is the heightened aggression. Just last week, in the
    middle of the day, a reasonable-looking man in his mid-twenties decided to
    slam his palm across my forehead as he walked past me. Mere days later-- this
    time at night-- a similar-looking man (but different; there a lot of these
    guys in Boston) stumbled out of a bar and immediately grabbed my shirt and
    tore the pocket off, spattering his blood across my arms and chest in the
    process. There's a reason no one riots in the winter.</p><p>
    
    Maybe I need to move to the home of Sub Pop, where the sun is shy even in
    summer, and where angst and aggression are more likely to be internalized.
    Then again, if Sub Pop is releasing the Shins' kind-of debut (they've been
    around for nine years, previously as Flake, and then Flake Music), maybe
    even Seattle has turned to the bright side. For some have hailed <i>Oh,
    Inverted World</i> as the next great entry in a long line of clean and
    carefree pop albums that strings back to the Beach Boys' early surfing days.
    This is what's meant by ""sunny"" music: both laid-back and upbeat, with
    crystalline vocals and lyrics that, while sincere, aren't particularly
    weighty.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, the Shins are a little more unpredictable than the summer, with
    its incessant, oppressive heat. ""Caring is Creepy,"" the opener, recalls the
    slower numbers on Sunny Day Real Estate's last prog-heavy offering, <i>The
    Rising Tide</i>. James Mercer's voice is nearly as inhuman and unclear as
    Jeremy Enigk's, and his dramatic delivery shifts momentum almost as often.
    A less fortunate similarity is the echo-heavy vocals, which likewise provide
    ample pretension, but they're not enough to derail this good rock song.</p><p>
    
    The following track, ""One by One All Day,"" is decidedly different. The more
    conventional vocals are instead layered and slightly withdrawn, allowing the
    thumping drums and jangly guitar to share the forefront. However, for all its
    pleasantness, it's fairly uniform. ""Weird Days,"" the most obvious Beach
    Boys-inspired song here, slows the pace to a drift. Like the previous number,
    it's not particularly dynamic, but the vocals and tropical strumming are
    pretty enough.</p><p>
    
    The Shins start showing their real strengths with ""Know Your Onion!"" which
    sounds like a 60's British garage band striving for the Kinks and just falling
    short. Just. The hook is surprisingly deceptive, the occasional childish
    background vocals are fun without being irritable, and there's even a welcome
    hint of their previous sound, which comes in the form of a slow, Modest
    Mouse-like interlude that ends with a patented Guided by Voices guitar lick.</p><p>
    
    ""Girl on the Wing"" is another strong, but more straightforward pop song that
    rides along on ringing keyboard notes not unlike-- but less abrasive than--
    GBV's ""Titus and Strident Wet Nurse (Creating Jeffrey)"" from this year's
    <i>Colonel Jeffrey Pumpernickel</i> compilation. But ""Pressed in a Book"" is
    undoubtedly the most straightforward, and perhaps the best song on <i>Oh,
    Inverted World</i>. The sound is like Weezer at their best-- simple, addictive
    chord changes and clear, sing-song vocals-- but for some background rattling
    and a few slow, strummy passages.</p><p>
    
    At times, though, the Shins seem too content to float along. The folky ""New
    Slang"" is Simon and Garfunkel all the way down to the celestial humming. ""The
    Celibate Life,"" with its distant guitar and soft percussion, would be a carbon
    copy of the Magnetic Fields if it weren't for a lone harmonica. ""Your Algebra""
    returns to S&amp;G;, this time to their chantey side, adding only a spare,
    diligently picked acoustic guitar as accompaniment. But despite the obvious
    comparisons, these songs are too pretty to turn down.</p><p>
    
    Like summer itself, the Shins are slightly over-hyped. All the buzz that's
    surrounded this release had me thinking (read: hoping) it would be the pop
    album of, at the very least, this summer. <i>Oh, Inverted World</i> comes
    close, but too much of the material here recalls other bands to consider it
    a ""great"" album. Nonetheless, I still can't believe this is what most people
    think summer sounds like. I only wish this wretched season sounded so good.</p></div>"|7113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7113-oh-inverted-world/|8.0|Ryan Kearney

    maybe something like a euphemism for some weird childhood punishment?  The
    cover art to this album-- the seventh installment in a series of EPs produced
    by placing handpicked bands in the eponymous studio for spontaneous two-day
    recording sessions-- doesn't really allay the creepiness.  We see a pair of
    deceptively cute, speckled fish (maybe gobies, or drobies, or gillies) floating
    on a deceptively tranquil aqua backdrop.  Eerily, the fish don't seem that far
    removed from those flashy tropical fighting fish that rip their tankmates'
    fins off.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't help that the label putting out these records is named ""Konkurrent""
    (as in, ""the diabolical Konkurrent corporation"").  It also doesn't help that
    the K's signify not only evil but blatant foreign-ness.  It's not too much of
    a leap to imagine these Konkurrent folk hijacking unsuspecting bands on tour
    in the Netherlands and whisking them off to their Amsterdam drug-fortress to
    breed an indie rock master race.</p><p>
    
    I'm also a bit wary because the last time they paired two bands together ""in
    the fishtank,"" it was the unlikely combination of Tortoise and avant-punkers
    the Ex, a union whose musical offspring didn't graduate much beyond
    ""interesting.""</p><p>
    
    It's encouraging to see that the bands seem to at least make <i>some</i> sense
    together this time; both Low and Dirty Three work in broad, deliberate strokes
    at virtually nonexistent tempos.  Also, we learn in the liner notes that Herr
    Doktor Konkurrent didn't arrange this match himself; Low actually invited
    their Aussie mates to play with them.  With this, however, the question
    becomes not one of compatibility but of musical interest: will the pairing
    challenge two admittedly great bands to do anything new?</p><p>
    
    From the opening seconds of the first track, ""I Hear. Goodnight,"" it's
    easy to see what roles the bands' members have taken; Low's Alan Sparhawk
    plays a measured, delicate counterpoint to Mick Turner's woozy, stumbling
    guitarwork, while Jim White's pointillist drums keep the song anchored to
    some vague sense of tempo.  It's amazing how ""bandlike"" the group sounds--
    Zak Sally fills in as the bassist Dirty Three never had, while Warren Ellis
    becomes the violinist Low fantasize about in their Mormon-style wet dreams.
    Mimi Parker enters with something like an apocalyptic lullaby (""I hear the
    windows shake/ I hear the silence break/ I hear the moon turn to blood"") that
    quietly breaks down into the chorus before Ellis lifts it up again with a
    swelling, wistful solo.  Interesting, for sure, and as pretty as anything
    either group has done before.</p><p>
    
    The next track, an inverted version of Neil Young's ""Down by the River,""
    is just as solid, with a long, formless, quietly chaotic opening that
    gradually takes shape into Parker's icy rendition of Young's confessional
    lyrics.  Even in this soup, Sparhawk's guitar meanderings sound both distinct
    from Turner's string-popping feedback swoops, and perfectly complementary.
    In the next song, ""Invitation Day,"" things start to get brilliant.  Parker,
    Sparhawk, and Sally trace out a silvery, descending modal melody, which Dirty
    Three proceeds to prick at with plucked violin and drunken strumming.  Before
    you know it, the bands seem to merge, and once again, lift the song up to
    heaven.  With the addition of White's drums and a droning church organ, ""When
    I Called Upon Your Seed"" sounds more country than anything Low has ever done,
    even as it threatens to turn into a D3-esque slow-motion sea chantey.</p><p>
    
    ""Cody"" seems to be a bit of a step backward, sounding like little more than a
    Dirty Three tune with a bassline.  However, the EP's sixth and final track,
    ""Lordy,"" follows through on its rootsy impulses; Sparhawk actually takes up
    the banjo and whips up a sincere Gospel vocal fury as Parker propels the song
    with surprisingly intense drumming.  Ellis and Turner get caught up in the
    rapture as well, churning out an echoed, noisy jubilance that thrashes in
    waves around the baptismal flame.</p><p>
    
    This track alone makes what could have been a nothing more than one-off EP
    worth it; it's like seeing those fighting fish at the pet store suddenly
    starting to rip shit up together.  And, like any other pleasant surprise,
    it's deeply frustrating to know that this is a one-time-only deal.  The
    possibilities apparent in this collaboration deserve to be developed in ways
    that the format just can't provide.  But it's at least as satisfying to see
    this one end the way it does, with a pile of torn scales slowly starting to
    gather on the bottom of the tank.</p></div>"|4897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4897-in-the-fishtank-ep/|7.9|Brendan Reid

And no,
    it isn't just to make you buy more shampoo. Of course, in this day and age,
    when hating all things corporate is ""cool,"" it's easy to write off this
    advice as shameless commercialism. But if those Herbal Essences commercials
    have taught us anything, it's that the shampoo manufacturers of the world
    want nothing more than to make us happy. Is it so hard to believe that they
    just want to share with us the wisdom they have gained after years of shampoo
    production?  Certainly they aren't recommending the endless, scalp bleed-inducing
    loops of rinse and repeat that have become the stuff of urban legend. They just
    want to share with you the wisdom that careful repetition can often make things
    decidedly more potent.</p><p>
    
    I don't know what kind of shampoo Stephen Mason uses. If the snazzy picture
    on the back of <i>Hot Shots II</i> is any indication, it's probably pretty
    good stuff. And the ten dense, smooth tracks on <i>Hot Shots II</i> reveal
    that Stephen Mason has been paying a good deal of attention to the Zen of
    the shampoo bottle: rinse and repeat.</p><p>
    
    While rinsing away the dirt and slop of his past may leave Mason feeling
    clean and fresh, it washes off one of the key elements of the Betas'
    trademark sound: the almost unparalleled zaniness and willingness to fuck
    around. The bizarre, layered samples, the sloppy playing-- all these have
    been cleansed from Mason's mane. The resulting album bears a closer resemblance
    in general mood and structure to Mason's most recent King Biscuit Time outing
    than to any previous Beta Band material.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to the latter half of shampoo bottle wisdom, and the half
    that helps makes <i>Hot Shots II</i> so good: repeat. Even if rinsing is
    robbing Mason and his cohorts of some of the beautiful weirdness displayed
    on previous records, <i>Hot Shots II</i> is a much more comfortable-sounding
    record than <i>The Three EPs</i> or the group's 1999 self-titled full-length
    debut. Just about every song here fits nicely into an organic, pulsing,
    repetitive groove.  It's much more densely and diversely orchestrated than
    King Biscuit Time, but much more contained and deliberate than any previous
    Beta Band releases.</p><p>
    
    This new contained and repetitive direction often yields amazing results.
    ""Al Sharp"", the standout from <i>Hot Shots II</i>, is one of the richest-sounding
    songs the Betas have ever produced. With xylophones, sampled strings, a groovy
    bassline, and some flat-out gorgeous multi-tracked vocals, there's very little
    not to love about the track. Especially when it contains lyrics like, ""Or [is
    it] because the power ranger robots in the skies have called a war/ To you,
    honey?""  As with the best of <i>Hot Shots II</i>, there's something beautiful,
    meditative, and contemplative about ""Al Sharp"".  Plus, the song simply sounds
    awesome, the result being perhaps the only Beta Band song on this album that
    can unequivocally stand up to the best material from <i>The Three EPs</i> or
    the self-titled record.</p><p>
    
    On the darker side of <i>Hot Shots II</i> is ""Gone"", a sparse guitar and
    piano-driven ballad that, were it twice as long and less linear, would sound
    right at home on <i>The Three EPs</i>. Balancing out the motionless sound of
    ""Gone"" is the near-epic, very much alive ""Dragons"". Another quasi-love-ballad,
    ""Dragons"" rides a whacked-out, reverb-drenched drumbeat and washed out
    synthesizers to a beautiful crescendo of multitracked vocals and samples.</p><p>
    
    Splitting the difference between ""Gone"" and ""Dragons"" is ""Life"", a downcast
    but decidedly goofy number about unrequited love featuring string swells,
    synthesizers, and cowbells. ""Life"" segues perfectly into <i>Hot Shots II</i>'s
    prettiest track, ""Eclipse"", an appealingly long-winded, spacy musing on books,
    pizza pie, and questions and answers. The song's rousing bridge, ""We all live
    together on a little round ball,"" recalls ""Yellow Submarine"", and the song's
    final line, which finally brings together its themes provides a perfect ending
    for an album that never takes itself too seriously.</p><p>
    
    That is, ""Eclipse"" <i>would</i> make a great closer for an album that never
    takes itself too seriously.  But for some ungodly reason, ""Won"", a pretty
    straightforward but hideously awful hip-hop track that has nothing to do with
    anything else on the album was slapped onto the end as a ""bonus"". For the most
    part, I'm not one to bitch about the inclusion of extra tracks, but the awkward,
    out-of-place ""Won"" really does fuck up the flow of <i>Hot Shots II</i>, and
    stifles what could have been a great closing.</p><p>
    
    While it certainly doesn't live up to the adventurousness of its predecessors,
    <i>Hot Shots II</i> is a pretty damned fine album, and easily surpasses
    previous outings in the realm of accessibility.  It also does away with the
    bizarre rap numbers and twelve-minute psych pastiches that put so many eager
    listeners off in the first place.  To me, though, that thrown-together sound
    was one of the things that made the Beta Band's music so exciting, hinting at
    the possibility of wacky revolutions and violent takeovers by silly string-armed
    bandits. Rinsing and repeating is working well for Stephen Mason, but it
    would no doubt serve him well to work up a more turbulent, frothy lather
    next time.</p></div>"|669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/669-hot-shots-ii/|8.6|Matt LeMay

And as Ornette     Coleman shouted at the world, no chords = freedom. Without chords to guide     a tune, it can logically go just about anywhere at any given time. For the     improvising soloist, this means increased possibilities. For the novice     listener, it can mean serious confusion. No chords can leave you asking,     ""Where are the freakin' tunes, man?""</p><p>This record of duets between tenor saxophonist Fred Anderson (who was a     founding member of the pioneering avant-garde collective AACM) and drummer     Robert Barry (a long-time member of Sun Ra's Arkestra) reminded me that jazz     without chords requires a different kind of listening. Some chordless music     focuses on texture, as with late 60's free jazz. Part of the thrill in     Coltrane's <em>Interstellar Space</em> comes from the sheer force of sound     from the man's horn. But <em>Duets 2001</em> has little overblowing, no shrieks,     and no cries.</p><p>What <em>Duets 2001</em> does have is loads of interaction between Barry and     Anderson, and this is the most pleasurable thing to listen for here.  These     two guys get together to play at the Empty Bottle in Chicago (where this set     was recorded) approximately once a year. And they're certainly not playing     standards here, so it's safe to assume that they're improvising from scratch.     What's needed in such a situation is empathy, and it's palpable on this set.</p>
<p>The show begins with ""Bouncing,"" a swinging piece with a marked blues flavor     that calls to mind the melody of Coltrane's ""Blue Train."" It's interesting     when listening to this track to think of both instruments as equals. Switch     your attention from the sax to the drums and back again, and try to picture     who's driving the piece at any given time. As Anderson picks up the tempo     and begins inserting notes, Barry will respond with cymbal splashes and     punctuating kicks. Likewise, both sense the time to pull back and leave     space. The synergy on this track is a wonder, and easy to listen for as the     piece chugs along on such an appealing groove.</p>
<p>The aptly named ""Speed Way"" gives Anderson a chance to display his     considerable chops at a breakneck pace. His tone on this piece is rough and     a little harsh as he navigates the difficult scales and Barry solidly anchors.     Barry's intricate rimwork on ""Taps"" gives the piece a Caribbean feel, and     offers evidence of his years with the Arkestra. Anderson takes on a percussive     role with his horn, allowing the piece to become an exercise in pure, sensual     rhythm.</p>
<p>""We"" is the freest piece here, with Anderson's melody following a cryptic     internal logic and Barry responding with hesitant, stop/start beats that are     nonetheless still tied to meter. And ""Dark Day"" closes this great set with     another fine, expressive blues. For a one-off jam, this record is fantastic,     and one can only hope this collaboration continues. Once a year may be fine     for family reunions, but these two should really get together more often.</p>

    and guitarist for the late Jonathan Fire*Eater-- used their Dreamworks cash to
    purchase a Harlem loft, install a recording studio, and start over. <i>Wolf
    Songs for Lambs</i> flopped financially, primarily because it sounded recorded
    in a large, wet box. However, it was a pretty damn unique and haunting garage
    pop album, and even predated some modern NYC trends (like the Strokes, the
    French Kicks, the Mooney Suzuki). Now residing on the more modest, yet
    bombastically monikered StarTime International, home too of the French
    Kicks, the Walkmen emerge from their uptown cocoon with a promising, and
    similarly unique self-titled EP.</p><p>
    
    The immediate difference between Jonathan Fire*Eater and the Walkmen is the
    change in singers. Stuart Lupton, who now concentrates his efforts on a new
    band called the Child Ballads, obviously worshipped Mick Jagger's slur and
    rasp.  His poetic rants fit Fire*Eater perfectly.  The Walkmen stand behind
    new pipes, Hamilton Leithauser, who recalls a more operatic Lupton, and,
    frighteningly, at times, Jon Bon Jovi.</p><p>
    
    ""Wake Up"" struts along on heavy, robotic drumming and stabs of reverb guitar.
    Martin replaces the fuzzy drone of Fire*Eater's organ with ambient twinkles
    and piano hammers that would make RZA smile, if RZA does, in fact, smile. The
    track recalls a ""live,"" sample-less Eternals, and, like the Eternals, your
    enjoyment hangs heavily on your ability to stomach the vocals. But it's
    amazing how fresh a set of drums, a bass, a guitar, and a keyboard can sound
    with some simple re-thinking, re-arrangement, and production touches.</p><p>
    
    The Bon Joviest singing runs throughout ""We've Been Had.""  But Bon Jovi never
    belted showtune-influenced rapture over echoing, sugar-tripped minimalism. If
    the Dismemberment Plan lived in 1967, they might come up with something like
    ""The Crimps,"" which skitters and pops on drum rolls and sleighbells, echoing
    bumblebee guitar, and spooky keys. Distant harmonies and rug-smothered drums
    slowly emanate under ""Summer Stage.""</p><p>
    
    In the end, Martin, Barrick, and Maroon cook up another subtle, spacious sound
    that chills out like a phantom. In many ways, the Walkmen perfectly embody a
    Harlem loft-- high ceilings, echoing acoustics, raw, exposed walls, and some
    arty beatnik who's probably from suburban New Jersey squatting right in the
    middle.</p></div>"|8570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8570-the-walkmen/|7.5|Brent DiCrescenzo

Complacent? Tired of cycling through the same
    three emotions day in day out until that car/plane/helicopter crash finally
    brings relief in hurtling flames, jagged shards of glass, and the small
    insurance pittance your family must subsist on until they too are struck
    down in a school/post office shooting?</p><p>
    
    This may surprise you, but you are not alone.</p><p>
    
    Dozens of Americans have found relief with Zorn, the miracle breakthrough in
    life amplification. Zorn is not a pill; nor is it a cult; nor is it the mild
    electrocution therapy that in the past has promised so much but never
    delivered. Zorn is a unique aural blend of computer music, Japanoise,
    avant-jazz, new classical, and cartoon cut-ups-- a cutting-edge synthesis of
    Eastern and Western traditions.  Clinically tested, loaded with dangerous
    additives and absolutely 100% guaranteed to approximate the feeling of a
    condom full of methamphetamines leaking in your stomach. Zorn doesn't just
    help you cope with life; it helps you cram existence into your orifices,
    comfortably and discreetly.</p><p>
    
    And Zorn is a name you can trust! The people who brought you the high decibel
    shattering glass of <i>Kristalnacht</i>; the fragile yet brutal prison rape
    music of <i>Elegy</i>; the anarchic game compositions of <i>Cobra</i>; the
    drunken, tough guy swagger of <i>Spillane</i>; the searing Semitic lament of
    <i>Bar Kokhba</i>; and the dark torture fetish erotica of <i>Naked City</i>
    now bring you <i>Songs from the Hermetic Theatre</i>, the newest installment
    of genital-bludgeoning life improvement strategies.  It's simple.</p><p>
<i>Hermetic Theatre</i> is the no-hassle, easy-to-follow, four-step program
    for achieving that tenuous, bi-polar, paranoid, quasi-hallucinatory handle on
    living. Let's walk through it!</p><p>
    
    1. ""American Magus"" (14:03).  A tribute to the legendary American
    ethnomusicologist Harry Smith, ""American Magus"" is Zorn's first foray to
    electronic composition. Drawing on the sharp, pins-and-needles electronics
    of Fennesz and Pita, and the reckless noise collage of Merzbow, ""Magus""
    layers incessant cascades of whistling sound over washes of sheer static.
    There is no silence to be found in this piece, just endlessly mutating
    frequencies tripping over one another in fast-forward. Careening glitches
    serve as the piece's only semblance of percussion, tracing the disturbingly
    lovely melodies like the shadow beneath a butterfly.</p><p>
    
    2. ""In the Very Eye of Night"" (11:16). The second composition opens with the
    voice of filmmaker Maya Deren, to whom the piece is dedicated, discussing
    time, film and femininity. Electric bass and bass drum drone darkly beneath
    soft aquatic sounds. High-pitched glass bowl and wooden flute squeal in the
    far corners, rising while the percussion approaches like thunder. Organic
    where its predecessor was gleefully synthetic, the watery ""Night"" is no less
    intense: rumbling in the bowels and the stomach, approximating birth.</p><p>
    
    3. ""The Nerve Key"" (9:29). Unbearably jittery, ""The Nerve Key"" is Zorn's
    first composition of computer music. Where Mille Plateaux's provocative
    <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts 2</i> highlighted the warmth and ambience of glitch music,
    ""Nerve"" recasts the genre as alien and alarming. ""The Nerve Key"" is computer
    neurosis, spastic and anxious. The sound of the machine on the edge of a
    nervous breakdown. If played at high volumes, it could very well damage you,
    your stereo and everyone you hold dear.</p><p>
    
    4. ""Beuysblock"" (16:13). ""Beuysblock"" is a junk symphony, featuring Jennifer
    Choi on violins and Zorn on some sixty different ""instruments,"" such as wax
    paper, moustache scissors, Polaroid camera, blood, rubber stamps, $82 in
    cash, staple gun, hair, vacuum tubes, newspapers and dirt. Choi's gorgeous,
    spare violin lines open the piece, layered one on top of the next. The
    various items (virtually unrecognizable) combine in various incarnations of
    household noise. A piano adds plaintive lines beneath the junk orchestra as
    if to add a massive question mark to the proceedings. Alternately fascinating
    and vile, the haphazard scraping, swishing, clanging, sawing, blow-drying,
    collapsing, humming, bubbling and bleeding attain the center, while the
    traditional instrumentation is reduced to background noise. ""Beuysblock"" is
    a world turned upside-down, music turned on its head and forced to yield to
    the clamor of everyday life.</p><p>
    
    See how easy it can be! A new life for the price of a song. And after
    <i>Hermetic Theatre</i>, you will receive more Zorn: a new dose approximately
    every 55 minutes.  How can you possibly resist?</p><p>

My introduction came via a compilation track called ""Azukiio No Kaori,"" a delicate slice of drifting ambient beauty striking enough to convince me to buy last year's <i>Sakura</i>. No regrets, believe me; it wound up being one of my favorite records of the year. Poking around online, I discovered that Yokota had been making music since at least 1992, and his releases numbered in the dozens. Most of his productions were house and techno variations geared toward the dancefloor, and most were only available as imports.</p>
<p>I've since purchased a double LP of his called <i>1999</i> (found it in a cut-out bin, oddly enough), and I could tell from the cheap, garish cover it was one of his dance releases. It's fascinating to me to think that the same person responsible for <i>Sakura</i> also created this. The music, at first pass (and there have not been many since), seemed stiff, without personality, and silly without the attendant humor. It's obvious that <i>1999</i> is a DJ tool and not an album, as the tracks are beyond repetitive, with no real end or beginning. This utility only served to put more distance between me and the music.</p>
<p>More than anything, Yokota's <i>1999</i> made me realize that I have a lot to learn about dance music, and my living room is probably not the best classroom. But it didn't affect the strong affinity I feel for Yokota's home listening material, a connection only strengthened upon hearing <i>Grinning Cat</i>. Where <i>Sakura</i> found Yokota exploring the sonic properties of the reverberating guitar, <i>Grinning Cat</i> focuses heavily on piano. The acoustic keyboard treatments vary from looped lullaby fragments, fuzzy with white noise on ""Sleepy Eye,"" to the more traditional ""Tears of a Poet,"" which seems like incidental film music from the 40's. Some of the piano parts are definitely sampled, with the loops cut in an intentionally jarring and disorienting manner. Others featuring winding melodies stretching across several bars which are surely played by Yokota.</p>
<p>The thematic unity of the piano aside, this record finds Yokota moving in ten different directions at once. It's almost as if these pieces were composed as singles, such is the varied feel. ""Imagine"" is a minimal affair, haunting and sad, with a floral melodic pattern set against samples and looped vocals. And then ""King Dragonfly"" comes right back with flanged drum programming, tribal clapping music and buoyant piano flourishes. ""Card Nation"" could be using a sampled Chopin Nocturne as its centerpiece, but it surrounds the tight keyboard loop with deep electronic percussion and distended Popol Vuh-style choir.</p>
<p><i>Grinning Cat</i> runs the rhythmic gamut as well. ""Cherry Blossom"" chugs along on a 4/4 bass thump, dripping almost unbearably poignant shards of stained piano tone on top. ""Love Bird"" uses only handclaps and a shaker to set the tempo for the simplest melody on the record, Windham Hill as imagined by a computer. ""So Red"" takes a stab at laptop jazz, with tightly programmed snare rolls and a double bass ostinato.

    formula wasn't cutting it anymore.  \xB5-Ziq and the Ninja Tune roster had
    caught onto the brain-twisting beauty of unclockable bpms and soft melodic
    tones.  He knew that to leave his mark on this world, he had to do something
    different.  Something so different it would transcend the term ""electronic""
    entirely, and endow him with the megastar status he knew he rightly deserved.
    So he recorded <i>Music is Rotted One Note</i>, a brilliant fusion-powered
    flashback that gave nods to both electric Miles and the dawn of the digital
    age.</p><p>
    After unanimous critical hallelujahs, the only challenge facing Jenkinson was
    how to follow such a tough act.  The three EPs that followed, <i>Budakhan
    Mindphone</i>, <i>Maximum Priest</i> and <i>Selection Sixteen</i>, offered
    variations on the album's theme, but rarely equaled the sweet inspiration of
    <i>Rotted One Note</i>'s fiery jam-sessions and dark discordance.  Would he
    continue tracking the ghost of post-60's African spirituality or give birth
    to something even more abstract and outlandish?</p><p>
    The sad fact is, either of these options would have produced better results
    than the one he ultimately chose: rehashing.  On <i>Go Plastic</i>, Jenkinson
    picks up where his <i>Big Loada</i> EP left off, almost as if <i>Music is
    Rotted One Note</i> had never existed.  <i>Go Plastic</i> exhumes the corpse
    of stuttering, fast-paced percussion and arbitrary programming that was bled
    dry and buried in a time when the Y2K bug still signified economic collapse
    and nuclear meltdowns.</p><p>
    For what it's worth, Jenkinson does at least attempt to update the outdated.
    The problem is, he draws on all the wrong elements.  Rather than resurrecting
    the elaborate analog melodies he once seemed to harvest off trees, he focuses
    on the goddamned breakbeats.  Why?  Aren't we past this?  Electronic music has
    mutated so drastically over the past three years.  It's currently some of the
    most creatively fertile soil the music world has to offer.  Has he just not
    bothered to learn the new software?</p><p>
    These questions are unanswerable.  Only Jenkinson knows why he reverted to
    such an exhausted form.  But speculation says he's grown comfortable.  After
    a hard day's work, nothing comes easier than lethargy, a curse all too
    apparent on the album's major offenders, ""Go! Spastic"" and ""Greenways
    Trajectory.""  The appeal of complete randomness was limited even before
    Autechre broke the freshness seal; now it's just irritating.</p><p>
    Jenkinson does occasionally acknowledge <i>Music is Rotted One Note</i>, as
    on the sparse 2\xBD minutes that open ""The Exploding Psychology,"" and the
    foreboding, reverb-laden ""My Fucking Sound"" (the title itself is a reference
    to <i>One Note</i>'s standout, ""My Sound"").  But even these tracks would have
    been relegated to one of that record's numerous EPs and 12-inches.</p><p>
    Only a few tracks can justify <i>Go Plastic</i>'s existence, and not
    surprisingly, they're the ones that sound the least like Jenkinson's past
    material.  ""Metteng Excuske v1.2"" is a tense collage of dark ambience,
    punctuated by metallic bursts and digital manipulations of plucked piano
    strings that swells into rumbling electronic malfunctions and derailing
    train noises before ending with an abrupt, glassy ping.  Sadly, the track
    lasts just over a minute from start to finish.  ""Tommib"" suffers a similar
    fate-- a beautiful echo of the majestic synthtones and hopeful melodies of
    <i>Big Loada</i>, sans percussion, is given a runtime of 1:19.</p><p>
    The closing ""Plaistow Flex Out"" is <i>Go Plastic</i>'s true triumph.  It
    blends some of the jazzy weirdness of <i>Rotted One Note</i> with the eerie
    warehouse tension of Photek's <i>Modus Operandi</i>.  4-bit Pong blips
    reverberate under a relaxed hip-hop bass and snare.  Sporadically, a keyboard
    riff pops up, so stretched and contorted that its original melody disappears
    completely, leaving only an oddly catchy series of slurred non-notes.</p><p>
    And of course, there's ""My Red Hot Car,"" which has thankfully been slightly
    remixed from its single version.  My feelings on this song are conflicted.  On
    one hand, the tune is sweetly infectious; on the other, the sentiment is
    disturbing at best, and would be better suited for the master of electronic
    gross-out, Richard D. James.  Regardless, you can't let this song deceive you.
    It stands out awkwardly, the only track of its kind, on an album of generic
    misfires and done-to-death jungle cliches.</p><p>
    Even assuming I fully enjoyed ""My Red Hot Car"" (which would be a terrible
    overstatement), it only adds up to 12 genuinely entertaining minutes on an
    album that nears the 50-minute mark.  There is, as always, hope that he'll
    again equal, or maybe even surpass the timelessness of <i>Music is Rotted
    One Note</i>, but he's not going to get there by coasting.</p></div>"|7447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7447-go-plastic/|5.1|Ryan Schreiber

The NRA is setting up shop in the White House; the
    federal government is subsidizing faith-based social services with taxpayer
    money; the bumper sticker injunction 'Don't Mess with Texas' has finally
    assumed the force of law. Guns, God and Texas. It was only a matter of time
    before the age acquired its opus. But who would have predicted a ten-gallon
    prog-emo Biblical concept album about the Texan apocalypse? Did I stutter?</p><p>
<i>""When the Winston Churchills start firing their Winston rifles into the sky
    from the Lone Star State, drinking the Lone Star Beer and smoking their
    Winston cigarettes, you know the time is growing nigh...""</i></p><p>
    
    So rambles the deadpan Josh Pearson on ""Just as Was Told,"" the opening track
    of <i>The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads</i>.  The three Denton, Texas boys--
    Pearson, Josh Browning and Andy Young-- learn from a drawling Angel of the
    Lord that ""the USA is the center of Jerusalem,"" before the track erupts into
    a maelstrom of guitars like a tornado tearing into a trailer park.
    Spoken-word introspection and cherubic incantations weave together with
    twisted razor-wire space-rock. The elements are not strikingly original: one
    can hear traces of the journalistic intonations of Brian McMahan circa
    Slint's ""Breadcrumb Trail""; the signature screwdriver-on-frets guitar
    liturgy of GYBE's Efrim Menuck; the late Jeff Buckley's ascendant vocals.
    But the intensity of music and vision is enough to overcome Lift to Experience's
    derivations. They are present, but for a moment, they are consecrated.</p><p>
    
    ""Down Came the Angels"" possesses a lighter touch, spun simply on the deep
    intermittent reverb of a lone guitar. But the song sets in relief a weakness
    that haunts the album: a total lack of phrasing. Seems like a trivial
    complaint on paper, but the truth is that Pearson sings until he feels like
    speaking, sings a little more, then resorts again to spoken word to serve the
    exigencies of the Good News. It's a hymn devolving into a prayer, and then
    into a sermon. And like church, it grows wearisome.</p><p>
    
    But all is temporarily forgiven with the thunderous intrusion of ""Waiting to
    Hit."" Reminiscent of early Spiritualized, the track lilts melodically and
    accelerates in dusty squalls of noise. In ""Waiting,"" the Lord commands the
    band to inform the world about ""the glory of the Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads.""
    And Person replies, ""Lord, I'll make you a deal: I will if you give me a
    smash hit so I can build a city on the hill."" Go forth and spread the word,
    I guess. After all, the next song, ""The Ground So Soft,"" opens with the boys
    singing a cappella from 1 Corinthians 15:55, straight out of the King James:
    ""Death where is thy sting? Grave where is thy victory?"" The effect is
    strikingly bizarre, like the first time you heard ""I love you Jesus Christ!""
    on Neutral Milk Hotel's <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>: some pure
    confessional momentarily rising above the din.</p><p>
    
    The first single, ""These Are the Days,"" is easily the strongest track on <i>The
    Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads</i>: somehow catchy, bluesy and full of wrath. It's
    constructed around jangly loops of guitar, and for the first time, Pearson's
    loose and hyperbolic lyricism functions as an asset instead of a liability.
    So, as to preempt any comparisons to Europe's ""The Final Countdown"" (even
    though Pearson does, at one point, actually start counting down to apocalypse),
    the band takes a jab at ""all you haircut bands doing headstands thinking
    you'll turn the world upside down."" Why, you ask? ""Because we're simply the
    <i>best band</i> in the <i>whole damn land</i>... and Texas is the reason.""</p><p>
    
    In the end (of the album, not the world), the parade of self-references,
    such as the above and, ""Just a stupid ranch hand in a Texas rock band trying
    to understand God's master plan"" grows cumbersome. And unfortunately, ""angels
    with crippled wings"" and ""God's terrible swift sword"" do not lighten the load.
    The music is supple, and often absolutely inspiring; however, the lyrics,
    frequent spoken-word passages, and hymns are often deadening. Lift to
    Experience simply sprawl like prairies, and maybe like Texas: there's simply
    too much of it. There's no question that <i>The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads</i>
    is built solid. But the second coming? Not quite yet.</p></div>"|4782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4782-the-texas-jerusalem-crossroads/|7.8|Brent S. Sirota

And I don't mean just a little sad or having
    an off day-- the guy is flat-out depressed, waiting for his life to end.  At
    least this is the impression I get from listening to his records.  This is
    the guy who once opened an album by intoning ""I hate my life"" over a
    dirge-like pop arrangement.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps he's not actually that miserable and it's just his flair for
    melodrama that makes his situation seem so dire.  On ""Our Time Has Passed,""
    he describes breaking up with his girlfriend, comparing it to ""a flash of
    radiation that leaves the buildings where they stand.""  Pernice fills 11
    songs with exactly this kind of sentiment on his second outing with the
    Pernice Brothers, the inaugural release from Pernice's own Ashmont Records.</p><p>
<i>The World Won't End</i> bounds in with the perfect pop of ""Working Girls,""
    which finds Pernice mulling the life of a lowly temp with lines like, ""She
    summered every winter through a calendar from paradise/ ""I was here,"" she
    scribbled in a restroom to prove she was alive/ All the working girls are
    fine/ Sunlight sun shines/ Contemplating suicide or a graduate degree.""  The
    six-piece band perversely backs this up with a peppy arrangement, setting up
    the fundamental tension that makes this a successful record.</p><p>
    
    Combining depressing themes with infectious melodies and jubilant music is
    hardly anything new-- Bobby Darin nearly perfected it in his too-brief career
    decades ago; early They Might Be Giants records still stand as a fine example--
    but the band and their conspirators (a total of ten people) give the music
    just the right edge of melancholy when it needs it.  This usually comes in
    the form of David Trenholm's restrained string quartet arrangements.  For the
    most part, the band also avoids the elevator-ready patches that tainted their
    debut.</p><p>
    
    Producer Thom Monahan, a long-time cohort of Pernice from his days in the
    Scud Mountain Boys, lends the album an autumnal sound that smacks of recent
    efforts by Archer Prewitt; you get the sense that the leaves are turning
    outside, and the temperature dropping.  It's probably safe to imagine that
    the band, most of them New England natives, feel at home with a sound that
    evokes that kind of imagery.</p><p>
    
    For his part, Pernice keeps on spinning out winning break-up songs and
    thanatopses, such as ""Flaming Wreck,"" in which he details his final thoughts
    (""I'm alright"") as his aircraft plunges five miles into the ground, killing
    all aboard.  His sometimes ragged vocals receive some welcome help here as
    well, with most of the band harmonizing gorgeously on the refrain.  It's
    this and countless other moments that offer insight into the meaning of the
    album title: the world won't end; it already has.</p><p>
    
    But even though Pernice's lyrics threaten to turn into a pity party at any
    second, the ebullient music that backs him always comes up strong, providing
    concentrated multi-vitamin blasts of delicious pop.  And at the end, the
    record's closer, ""Cronulla Breakdown,"" marries a closing-time-at-the-hotel-lounge
    delivery with a fabulous Beatlesque melody, proffering a final swipe at
    failed relationships with the line, ""We try so hard to make the worst of a
    bad situation,"" summing it all up over bongos and acoustic guitar.</p><p>
    
    It all amounts to what, for me, is the best record Pernice &amp; Co. have made
    yet.  Though it had its moments, I was never in love with the Scud Mountain
    Boys' brand of jazzy country, nor with Pernice's slow-core Chappaquiddick
    Skyline project.  Here, however, he and his latest band seem to have found a
    comfortable vehicle for delivering his world-weary messages, and the results
    are definitely worth hearing.</p></div>"|6238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6238-the-world-wont-end/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    Big Bad Band should be.  Some like the brash trash of the Stooges and
    the young Rolling Stones.  Others like the intricate insanity of crotch
    exhibitionists like the Jesus Lizard.  Some like the full-on badness of
    mental patients like the Shaggs or Wesley Willis.</p><p>
    Like many of the forbearers, Vue assumes the pose of a bad band.  Bad
    in terms of heavy eyeliner, black leather jackets, and cocaine snorted
    off the backs of assorted groupies backstage.  Fun-time bad.  Kick-ass
    bad.  Little girl-lusting bad.  Sorry, guys-- this kind of badness is
    getting a bit tired as the years go by.</p><p>
    But while hardly original, Vue is exceedingly good at replicating the
    style of music they're attempting.  Unlike some rock-punk revivalists
    that try to get by on leather pants and leopard-skin man-bras, Vue
    actually has the chops and attitude to summon some genuinely enjoyable
    (if fleeting) moments.
    </p><p>
    From the first track of this EP, the tone is set.  ""Child for You"" could
    be the smash-up derby song of the summer (if this was summer), packed
    with blustery guitar, possessed screaming, and drums that sound like they
    were played by the world's most slack-jawed drummer. ""Hush Your Friend""
    rides shotgun in a tank top and pink lipstick, replete with sped up
    rockabilly beats and horny moans.  Eventually, things slow down a bit
    on ""The Death of a Girl.""  The song begins with a slow, church organ
    drone as frontman Rex Shelverton wails, Mark Arm-style.
    </p><p>
    Throughout, the band throws in enough passion and unexpected changes to
    make it seem worth your time.  Aided by thoroughly trashy production that
    brings out all the right guitar chords, it's all very Bad stuff.  I have
    no suggestions about how to make Vue more original or innovative, but
    judging from the results of this disc, they'd piss on me if I tried.
    I suppose that suits most people just fine.

Armed with
    acoustic guitars and words of personal experience and political protest,
    they set out to teach the world how to think, feel, and listen.  Fortunately,
    the Earth caught on pretty quickly, and it soon became apparent that scraggly
    individuals whining about failed romances and their inability to pay rent can
    only entertain for so long. Without the benefit of a massive meteor to help
    thin their ranks, singer/songwriters were left largely to wander the streets,
    looking for coffeehouses and bars where they could force their misery upon
    unsuspecting patrons.</p><p>
<i>Live at Jittery Joe's</i> is a decent-quality recording of a man playing
    an acoustic guitar and singing at a local coffee bar. But this is not by any
    stretch of the imagination typical singer/songwriter fare. This is Neutral
    Milk Hotel frontman Jeff Mangum spinning his unique, beautifully tangled web
    of visceral flesh imagery, odes to Anne Frank, and cryptic, vivid storytelling.</p><p>
    
    The material on <i>Live at Jittery Joe's</i>, which was recorded after the
    release of Neutral Milk Hotel's debut 1996 debut, <i>On Avery Island</i>, but
    before the release of their masterwork, <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>,
    consists largely of material culled from these two albums, as well as a few
    unreleased tracks and a cover of Phil Spector's ""I Love How You Love Me."" The
    set starts out with a version of ""A Baby for Pree"" and a shortened, heavily
    altered version of ""Where You'll Find Me Now,"" a two-song sort-of-suite from
    <i>On Avery Island</i>. Mangum heavily alters the lyrics of ""Where You'll
    Find Me Now"" to include lines like, ""I will be strong/ Strong enough to shout/
    Above your voice that's blaring on/ With your face that's falling out/ Into
    the dust of what you are."" The lyrics don't approach the beauty of those in
    original version of the song, buy they afford it a fresh, stream-of-consciousness
    feel that makes it somehow more affecting.</p><p>
    
    Another song to appear in a different form on <i>Live at Jittery Joe's</i> is
    ""Two-Headed Boy Part 2"" from <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>, possibly
    the most heart-wrenching moment to be found on that album, and one of a very
    small number of songs that has been known to move my cold, cynical self to
    tears. Introduced as a song about ""a family that lived in the 1940's in
    Europe,"" ""Two-Headed Boy Part 2,"" like many of Mangum's songs, transmits raw
    emotion through cryptic, evocative lyrics. When he sings, ""In my dreams you're
    alive/ And you're crying/ Move your mouth into mine/ Soft and sweet,"" his
    voice aches with an intensity that seems to defy the limits of human emotion
    and expressiveness.</p><p>
    
    The acoustic treatment fits some album cuts better than others. Tracks like
    ""Gardenhead"" and ""King of Carrot Flowers Parts 2 &amp; 3"" lose a good deal of
    their impact without the fuzzy, explosive backing found on the album versions.
    But songs like ""Oh Comely"" and ""Two-Headed Boy,"" both of which appear on
    <i>Aeroplane</i> as essentially acoustic numbers, gain a harshness from the
    live treatment that suits them perfectly.</p><p>
    
    And then there are the unreleased tracks. ""I Will Bury You in Time"" is the
    only Mangum original that's available only on this recording, and it
    unfortunately fails to stand up against the featured album tracks. Perhaps
    the only Neutral Milk Hotel song I've heard that sounds awkward and clumsy,
    ""I Will Bury You in Time"" is definitely on the weaker end of unreleased
    Neutral Milk Hotel song-spectrum (my two personal favorites being ""Oh Sister""
    and ""Little Birds,"" both of which can be found on live bootlegs).</p><p>
    
    A much better non-album track comes with ""Engine,"" a b-side from the
    ""Holland, 1945"" seven-inch that recently appeared on a Merge Records
    compilation. Written as a song for children, ""Engine"" contains fanciful yet
    typically strange lyrics about, among other things, round captains talking
    to tigers from cafeteria trays. More importantly, ""Engine"" has one of the
    most haunting melodies I've ever heard, ensuring that those odd, vivid images
    won't be leaving you any time soon.</p><p>
    
    Rounding off the unreleased portion of <i>Live at Jittery Joe's</i> is Jeff
    Mangum's cover of the Phil Spector classic ""I Love How You Love Me."" Mangum's
    voice absolutely brings the song to life, making Spector's simple words seem
    profound and beautiful.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the true brilliance of Jeff Mangum is that everything he sings
    sounds profound and beautiful. His lyrics are visceral and unique, but it's
    the wrenchingly powerful way in which he sings them that makes them resonate
    so intensely. <i>Live at Jittery Joe's</i> certainly resonates, but a few
    weak tracks, some intrusive crowd noise, and the informative-yet-distracting
    between-song banter prevents it from striking with the power of <i>In the
    Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>.</p><p>
    
    But that's not the point. <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i> will always
    stand as a perfect example of Jeff Mangum's almost superhuman talents as a
    singer and songwriter. <i>Live at Jittery Joe's</i> documents a less refined,
    more casual side of Mangum, and does a pretty damned good job of it. I get
    the feeling that this show wasn't recorded with ""live album"" in mind, and
    that element of candidness makes it essential for Neutral Milk Hotel fans
    such as myself, who weren't lucky enough to see Jeff in concert.</p><p>
    
    Even with the candid and casual nature of this recording, there remains an
    element of mystery and otherworldiness to Jeff Mangum. <i>Live at Jittery
    Joe's</i> comes with some gorgeous video footage of the entire performance.
    Very dark and difficult to make out, Mangum's face appears as little more
    than a shadow, writhing in time with the alarmingly affecting words he
    sings-- almost as if the words are being driven by an intangible force.  And
    it's these moments, when it's hard to separate the mystery from the humanity,
    that make the album absolutely worthwhile.</p></div>"|5070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5070-live-at-jittery-joes/|7.9|Matt LeMay

    cold-hearted motherfucker.  Johnston, a schizophrenic manic-depressive
    who believes he will be resurrected 100 years after his death to tour with
    the Beatles and the Butthole Surfers, and Fair, an eccentric, compulsive
    songwriter with bad taste in eyewear and a penchant for ranting senselessly,
    could not possibly be good for each other, or music in general.  Maybe Jad
    just wanted to see if he could outcrazy Johnston.  But such a thing is not
    possible, even for a guy that's made an album of monster songs for children
    and sports a frizzy homeless-guy hairdo.</p><p>
    
    Some might think this is a perfectly acceptable match of talents.  After all,
    both musicians often sing about the simple pleasures in life, like falling
    in love, having fun, and witnessing the apocalypse; they often sing in extreme
    tenors that sound closer to 11-year-olds' than 40-year-olds'; and they're both
    sometimes brutally irritating.  But after 31 tracks and 70 minutes, you'll
    realize that this is not natural.  Still, <i>It's Spooky</i> stands as the
    definitive recording of both artists' solo output.  Its eternal length is just
    a testament to the boundless insanity raging within Daniel Johnston's confused
    mind.  This is, after all, primarily Johnston's album, since he wrote the
    majority of its songs.</p><p>
    
    You always hear stories about Johnston being ""insane.""  For years, I
    disregarded them as legend or exaggeration.  But any interview with the man
    will easily convince you otherwise as he discusses his many selves and his
    delusional battles with Lucifer with deadpan conviction.  He never seems even
    remotely lucid, and has spent several years of his life institutionalized.
    What a lot of people don't realize is that most of the songs that sound to
    the casual listener like nauseatingly twee homages to cartoons are actually
    deeply personal insights into his hallucinatory existence.</p><p>
    
    ""Frankenstein Vs. the World"" is a tale of the end times, in which the
    resurrected Johnston will destroy the planet.  ""Hands of Love"" reveals his
    fear that he's too deranged to ever find love.  ""Casper the Friendly Ghost,""
    which is the name he's given to the Daniel Johnston that will exist after
    his body dies, pertains to how people who mistreat him in life will respect
    him when he's gone.  The title track consists of every day musings like,
    ""Sometimes when I'm watching television/ I think that most of the people in
    the movie are probably dead.""  It's obviously impossible for us to relate to
    his demented ruminations, but you've got to have sympathy for someone so
    absolutely mental.</p><p>
    
    Even Johnston's covers generally have deep meaning for him.  60's troubadour
    Phil Ochs' ""Chords of Fame"" warns about the dangers of success destroying
    talent, something Johnston fears could happen to him.  ""Kicking the Dog,""
    originally by 80's indie rockers Glass Eye, relates to his affection for
    ""Laurie,"" a girl he was once (and probably still is) obsessed with.  Others
    are taken out of their natural context or twisted into dark views of humanity.
    Johnston alters the lyrics to Bacharach's ""What the World Needs Now"" to
    reflect the casual degeneration of society (""We've got enough pornography/
    There is x-rated theaters everywhere/ Lord knows we've got enough crackhouses/
    There are crackhouses on every block"").  The Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows""
    is inverted from an ecstatic acid endorsement to panicked paranoia, ending
    with Johnston screaming: ""No, no!  Ladies and gentlemen!  Do not surrender to
    the void!  Darkness surrounds you!  Don't relax!  You'll never get out of that
    pit!""</p><p>
    
    Other tracks are considerably more balanced, often recalling actual events.
    ""I Met Roky Erickson"" is a play-by-play account about how his friendship with
    the similarly crackbrained recluse came to fruition (and about how Erickson's
    mother made them chicken).  ""McDonald's on the Brain"" is a terrible a cappella
    recollection of his mid-80's fast food career.  The plodding ""I Did Acid
    with Caroline,"" which offers one rage-inducing chord strummed for almost
    the song's entire duration, is a harmless but creepy remembrance of a
    romantic drug experience.  (""We were one!/ We were one!"")</p><p>
    
    Johnston's irrelevant ramblings are often redeemed by his knack for writing
    great melodies, and the voyeuristic thrill of listening to a crazy man's
    musical therapy.  And often, Jad Fair refines Johnston's melodies in their
    collaborations.  ""Tongues Wag in This Town,"" ""Villian,"" and the saddening
    ""Nothing Left"" are great examples of the two working toward a common goal.
    But on later tracks, particularly the unlistenable megaphone madness of
    ""Fan and Games,"" Fair tries too hard at avant-garde and winds up with
    something you wouldn't even wish upon Anthony Michael Hall.</p><p>
<i>It's Spooky</i> was recorded in one week (including mixing) and it shows.
    Any of these tracks could have been infinitely better had they been fleshed
    out and perfected.  Johnston's drumming is really quite awful, and in some
    instances, seems to be doing its own thing entirely.  Fair had actually
    intended for the two to work more extensively on the project and smooth things
    out, but the notoriously non-team-playing Johnston insisted that the project
    be finished by the time he left town.</p><p>
    
    Beneath the din of disorganization, there are really some excellent songs.
    It's easy to let Johnston's delirious vocals and hapless meter get in the
    way-- in fact, they're totally unavoidable.  But at their core, these tracks
    offer insight into a day in the life of a morbidly brainsick individual, and
    do so with infectious pop tunes you won't be able to shake for days.  I can't
    say I'll listen to it much, but if ever there were evidence that mental
    illness is contagious, it's just been reissued.</p></div>"|2957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2957-its-spooky/|6.3|Ryan Schreiber

    leaking in from above.  The window panes are mildewed and cobwebbed, and a
    dozen insect corpses lie scattered on the sill.  They are the victims of the
    naked bulb that hangs from the ceiling, casting a dull glow on the bed, which
    vibrates if you put enough quarters in the slot on the headboard.  The scent
    of alcohol snakes through the room like a vine strangling a trellis.  The
    bed's stained sheets cover a mattress that would just as soon swallow you as
    comfort you to sleep.</p><p>
    
    This is Simon Joyner's hotel suite.  It's not so much a place to live as a
    place to retreat to, a tattered sanctuary from the withering attacks of the
    heart on the cortex, and a place to retrieve your body from the floor where
    it fell in last night's drunken stupor in private.  Joyner has lived here for
    a long time, first emerging from his tired bedsit in 1993 with the <i>Room
    Temperature</i> album, and following it up with a series of ramshackle folk
    records that have quietly established him as a lyricist with few equals.</p><p>
<i>Hotel Lives</i> finds Joyner opening up his box of demons and putting them
    to rest, one by one.  His lyrics are those rare ones that could just as easily
    read as a book of spectacular poetry, but they're truly brought to life on
    the album by an impressive cast of collaborators. Not the least of these is
    producer Michael Krassner, who captures every expression of misery, pain, and
    redemption with a remarkably adept hand.  Virtually every member of the
    legendary Boxhead Ensemble's new line-up is here; pianist Will Hendricks,
    drummer Glenn Kotche, and a host of other instrumentalists color cellist
    Fred Lonberg-Holm's sparse arrangements with painterly strokes.</p><p>
    
    Though the music on <i>Hotel Lives</i> more often resembles the brooding
    intensity of early Leonard Cohen, it opens closer to ""Being for the Benefit
    of Mr. Kite,"" with the carnivalesque swirl of its title track.  The subtle
    electronics, droning cello and martial toms call to mind the work of
    Truckstop labelmates Pinetop Seven.  ""Here's another song about an old hotel/
    A place you can rise in, the same place you fell/ To get lost in solitude and
    saved by yourself/ And did I mention I'm alone as well"" begins Joyner,
    immediately setting the tone for all that follows.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the album's 77 minutes are a lot less musically active, often
    stretching barebones arrangements over the course of six or seven minutes.
    And if <i>Hotel Lives</i> fails anywhere, it's in its overwhelming length.
    Still, despite its epic breadth, there are more than enough breathtakingly
    intimate moments to keep you from leaving, and further listens reveal
    infinite layers of subtle feedback, manipulation and countermelody.
    Lonberg-Holm's arrangements are subtle to the point that you barely notice
    the warm horns and strings of ""Now We Must Face Each Other,"" but it's hard
    to imagine the song without those elements.</p><p>
    
    The song's subject never casts an eye back over his shoulder as he leaves the
    life of another in shambles.  ""Why must you turn everything beautiful ugly/
    And everything ugly so hideous?"" Joyner accuses at the beginning, backed only
    by a spare acoustic guitar.  ""Will you ever tire of digesting the flesh/ Long
    enough to investigate the soul/ Or are you like the amnesiac goldfish/ Always
    surprised to find yourself in a bowl?"" he ends as the arrangement collapses
    into dust.</p><p>
    
    Joyner's voice breaks all over the middle of the album, cracking with
    exhaustion and sorrow at every turn of phrase.  This hotel is the same one
    that Jeff Tweedy wrote ""Someone Else's Song"" in, the one where Smog had his
    first conference with death, and the place where Tindersticks used to reside
    before they discovered 70's soul.  Somewhere in the woods behind the parking
    lot, the Oldham brothers sit around a fire howling and strumming guitars deep
    into the night.</p><p>
    
    The atmosphere of ""How I Regret That I've Done Wrong"" recalls the odd
    combination of junkyard ambience and traditionalism of Califone, while the
    loose rhythms and light strumming of ""My Life Is Sweet"" nudge along a vocal
    that sometimes resembles the tumbling delivery of vintage Bob Dylan.  The
    song is perfectly placed to break up the brooding atmosphere, though the
    lyrics don't flinch in their wrenching account of alcoholism: ""I got on my
    hands and on my knees/ And I asked the floor for release/ I was so heavy it
    felt like I was being squeezed/ Through the cracks in the wood into the black
    underneath.""</p><p>
    
    ""You, David, Maria, &amp; Me"" drags itself into bed on the back of a tired slide
    guitar worthy of David Roback or Rainer Ptacek, incorporating tape noise into
    the arrangement as well.  The junkyard ambience of the second half of the
    album means that <i>Hotel Lives</i> actually gets better and fuller as it
    progresses, a technique that allows you to listen to the whole thing at once.
    Still, it's best digested in two forty-minute pieces, as spending too much
    time at once in Joyner's room can be somewhat taxing on the nerves.</p><p>
    
    Time issues aside, though, once you've let Simon Joyner hold you in his
    poetic grip, you're likely to return for more very soon.  And with
    collaborators like Lonberg-Holm, Guillermo Gregorio, and Krassner on hand,
    his careful documents of each stumble and insecurity of the transients in his
    world are fleshed to perfection.  ""Listen all you lovers and would-be lovers
    to my tale/ The moral of my story is not hidden/ Though there are some lies
    along the way to disguise the details/ The broad strokes of this picture
    shall render its true meaning,"" he sings on the closer, ""Geraldine.""  When
    the song is over, you realize he's telling the truth.  Joyner's hotel lives
    may not be ones you'd want to live, but when rendered so skillfully, they're
    easy to love.</p></div>"|4306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4306-hotel-lives/|8.3|Joe Tangari

    a band called Swell.  Those were heady times, they were.  Grunge was still
    underground, and the Pixies were making a racket all the way across America
    from Boston.  Swell managed to hear some Pixies records, and it forever
    changed the way they played music.  At least, that's what I'm assuming,
    since that's the backstory for basically every post-Pixies alternative rock
    band.</p><p>
    
    During the course of their career, Swell has been through some rough times
    (not the least of which was when one of their songs was given inclusion on
    the <i>Showgirls</i> soundtrack).  Their lineup seen several members come
    and go, many only sticking around for one album.  And on <i>Everybody Wants
    to Know</i>, it's debatable whether Swell is actually even a band anymore.
    See, they're down to just one guy, longtime frontman David Freel, who plays
    all the instruments on the album, except for some drums that were laid down
    by ex-Daddy Longhead (who?) percussionist Rey Washam.</p><p>
    
    Freel has a subdued vocal style that he likes to self-harmonize with, giving
    the music a fuller sound.  For example, in the opening moments of ""East n' West,""
    a couple of David Freels get together and sing, ""Crash down the steps like
    they're magic/ Fuck the pain, 'cause pain's never lasted/ Everything about
    you was spastic/ Got to pee, and we're stuck in traffic/ Life is short for
    something so graphic/ And we began to finally grasp it.""  Not too shabby, eh?
    Yes?  Hey, I never said it was fucking Longfellow, but it's a favorite moment
    of mine here.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, Freel writes some rather engaging music to back up his lyrics,
    though sometimes he plays it for way too long, like on ""...A Velvet Sun,""
    where the outro lasts pretty much indefinitely.  That's followed by ""Like
    Poverty,"" whose verse noise makes it a bit like being followed around by a
    staticky radio station.  But it gets a little clearer in patches, and the
    acoustic guitar over the top sounds nice enough.  Virtually every track on
    the record fall in a range of about 20-30 bpms, never straying far from that
    mid-tempo zone where it's impossible to rock, but also hard to get too
    sappy.</p><p>
    
    The album gains most of its variety, then, from tweaking the sonics and
    varying the instrumentation.  There's that aforementioned acoustic guitar,
    ambient keyboards, and little analog synth countermelodies on the instrumental
    ""I Don't Think So,"" while ""East n' West"" lays down the distorted guitars and
    funks the drumming up a bit.  A few tracks suffer from some piano overkill,
    which could have been fixed by simply repositioning a couple of faders on
    the mixing board.</p><p>
    
    So, when it all boils down to the whole experience of listening to Swell, how
    does this latest effort fare?  Is it, in fact, swell?  Well, it's kind of
    swell for the most part.  The production can be kind of neat, and those
    analogue synths that pop up now and then hit my nerd zone right where it
    counts.  It's hardly the equal of past efforts like Swell's 1997 high-water
    mark <i>Too Many Days without Thinking</i>, but it's still an improvement
    over their last album as a full band, <i>For All the Beautiful People</i>.</p><p>
<i>Everybody Wants to Know</i> is the kind of album that grows more rewarding
    the second and third times through, as the subtle hooks gradually sink in.
    But once those hooks have engrained themselves in those old skullbag, it's
    pretty unlikely they'll offer anything you can't get from any other anonymous
    alterna-rock record.  For all its nifty accoutrements and production ideas,
    <i>Everybody Wants to Know</i> is ultimately just a halfway decent affair
    that would be better if it were shorter.  My recommendation to David Freel
    is to get the band back.  They may be hard to work with or whatever, but it
    would at least lend a spirit of interaction that's sorely missing here.</p></div>"|7662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7662-everybody-wants-to-know/|5.9|Joe Tangari

At that time, many classic
    records were out of print and just starting to be issued on CD.  Columbia
    had the most distinguished catalog, with Miles Davis, the Armstrong Hot
    Fives and Sevens, all the early Billie Holiday, some Duke, the most popular
    Monk, and Dave Brubeck, to name just a few. One by one, Columbia reissued
    the old records on CD as part of the ""Columbia Jazz Masterpieces"" series,
    complete with new artwork, digital remastering and, in some cases (like
    <i>Miles Ahead</i>), radical remixing. I remember reading the promo material
    in the CD booklets and getting excited about what was going to be reissued
    next.</p><p>
    
    Another Columbia artist was Wynton Marsalis. When I first began listening to
    jazz, Wynton was creating high-profile records of his own.  At that time, his
    quintet included his brother Branford and was heavily indebted to the Wayne
    Shorter/Herbie Hancock lineup of Miles Davis' quintet. I liked some of those
    mid-80's Marsalis records. <i>Black Codes from the Underground</i>, in
    particular, still stands as a powerful statement.</p><p>
    
    While he was making this music, Wynton was just hitting his stride as a
    tastemaker. Along with critic pal Stanley Crouch, he was telling the world
    that this music was the greatest form since the demise of symphonic music,
    but that only a narrow slice of what was being marketed as ""jazz"" actually
    deserved the appellation. To him, the biggest imposter was electrified
    fusion.</p><p>
    
    Now, I admit I was an impressionable teen. Wynton, Crouch and my brother all
    told me ""fusion sucks,"" and I never thought to question their judgment. Any
    jazz with electric instruments, with the possible exception of <i>In a Silent
    Way</i>, was to be avoided at all costs. That was the Chuck Mangione shit.
    Fuck that.</p><p>
    
    Forgive me, Miles, for I knew not what I did. It took me another ten years
    to figure out that there was some great electrified jazz floating around.
    And now I find music that blends jazz with textures from other music more
    interesting than the ""real thing."" Like the last Isotope 217 album. Or this
    new one by the Chicago Underground Quartet.</p><p>
    
    Like Isotope, the Chicago Underground in its various numerical configurations
    is an adventurous fusion unit fronted by cornet player Rob Mazurek. The other
    constant is drummer/vibraphonist Chad Taylor.  This edition also includes the
    guitar of Jeff Parker (of Isotope and Tortoise), in addition to the old
    standby Noel Kupersmith (now also a member of Brokeback) on bass. With so
    many musicians on loan from such familiar bands, the Chicago Underground
    Quartet is bound to sound a bit, well, familiar. And it does. This is
    definitely the kind of tech-tweaked instrumental music that Chicago has been
    specializing in for close to a decade. But the tweaks are subtle, and this
    is such a low key, unassuming and melodic record that it still sounds very
    fresh to my ears.</p><p>
    
    Jeff Parker opens the album on ""Tunnel Chrome"" with a deftly plucked guitar
    pattern that recalls the opening chords to ""Night in Tunisia."" Taylor doubles
    up on both drums and vibes, and Mazurek adds some heavily processed horn
    (he's also credited on the album sleeve with ""electronics"") that has a very
    guitar-like tonality. His processing gives the piece, which is very
    straightforward post-bop jazz, a bit of an otherworldly flavor.</p><p>
    
    In addition to Parker's lovely guitar playing throughout, these less
    traditional flourishes are what make this record interesting. ""Three
    in the Morning"" begins with a gorgeous guitar lead that soon dissolves
    into delicate phase-shifts and backward harmonies as Mazurek's cornet
    states the theme. ""Four in the Morning"" sounds all the world like a ballad
    off of Miles Davis <i>Cookin'</i>, with Mazurek on Harmon mute.  But
    Taylor's brushwork is so robotic it sounds like a Pro-Tools loop (which I
    suppose it might actually be). There's no thought of adding an offbeat
    accent to this brief song, which gives a whiff of the technology involved
    in the recording.</p><p>
    
    This restrained approach is the order of the day for the Chicago Underground
    Quartet, and only occasionally do they cut loose and blow.  On the flowing,
    impressionistic ""Welcome"" (not the Coltrane tune), Parker adds some distortion
    to his guitar and Mazurek goes into gospelized Donald Ayler mode, sounding
    like he's gearing up for a march. It's a welcome change of pace, but the mood
    here tends toward the controlled, thoughtful and expressive. While this is
    nothing like the full-blown electronic love-in that was the last Isotope
    record, the Chicago Underground Quartet know how to integrate technology into
    their distinctive jazz sound. It's a fusion of some kind-- I'm sure of that--
    so Wynton would not approve. But I'd call it a worthy extension of the
    tradition.</p></div>"|1440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1440-chicago-underground-quartet/|7.4|Mark Richard-San

    members naming themselves Blue Hawaii, the Dimisher and Marta Tennae. For one
    thing, it's just about impossible to figure out what the hell they're up to.
    They have one member of Neutral Milk Hotel (drummer Tennae, who is known as
    Jeremy Barnes outside of Bablicon); other members have a background in the
    Chicago improv scene. Together, they are making music. Not rock music, not
    electronic music, not folk music, not jazz music, though, at various points,
    they might be doing any one of those things. Just music. Any modifier you
    might attach to the word limits it, which would simply not do. No limitations,
    no boundaries-- this seems to be the Bablicon creed.</p><p>
    
    After last year's <i>The Orange Tapered Moon</i>-- which found the band making
    smart use of electronics in addition to channeling the emotion of Albert Ayler
    and the surrealism of Beefheart-- Bablicon return in 2001 with a dense album
    seemingly inspired by silent film scores, German cabaret, and vaudeville, while
    still incorporating noisy interludes and assorted indescribable fragments.</p><p>
    
    Many of the tunes on the first half of <i>A Flat Inside a Fog, The Cat That Was
    a Dog</i> are dominated by piano, with a wide variety of instruments outlining
    dissonant, haunting melodies that seem remembered from a flickering
    black-and-white past. Strings supplied by the ""Alien Orchestra,"" and even
    greater deployment of multi-tracked harmonized reed lines, makes this band
    seem much larger than it actually is. On this record, Bablicon are like the
    house band from a nickel cinema learning how to incorporate field recordings
    and free jazz into their sound.</p><p>
    
    But the strangest thing is that these tunes, many of which seem to be working
    in a long-forgotten tradition, don't feel nostalgic or tied to any particular
    era. Though the music sounds only a little like Tom Waits, Bablicon have a
    similar knack for using ""old"" elements and in ways that the originators never
    could have imagined. Kurt Weill never had the opportunity to run an organ
    through a distortion pedal. W.C. Handy died before lungs-out blowing became
    as valid as melody. Richard Strauss never wrote charts under the influence of
    LSD. And so on.</p><p>
    
    As on <i>The Orange Tapered Moon</i>, <i>The Cat That Was a Dog</i> opens with
    a vocal track called ""Blue Hawaii,"" which recalls an old showtune. ""Traveling""
    could be a Gershwin interlude played on piano, bass, clarinet and soprano
    saxophone, with the feel of the old south, sweaty and evocative. ""Animals"" is
    the first track to feature the Alien Orchestra, possibly a string quartet
    recorded to sound distant and thin.  Opening with field recordings of a train
    station, ""Saumar/Paris/Tea Towels"" becomes a bouncy sax instrumental, moves
    back to atmospheric sound, and then tacks on another brilliant section of
    Aylerian folk played on c melody and soprano sax and oboe by the Dimisher.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps sensing that they had too many musical ideas to stuff into the 36
    minutes of last year's record, <i>A Flat Inside a Fog</i> is 65 minutes
    long with lots of weird experimental tracks that some might describe as
    ""filler,"" but which I term ""the good stuff."" ""Smell of Ovoustic"" is heavily
    treated tapes of a clarinet, sounding like an early synthesizer recording
    meant to mimic the sound of deep space. Another brief highlight is ""Ape Hall,""
    32 seconds of manipulated orchestra recordings-- perhaps the sound of an
    early talkie being munched in a projector.</p><p>
    
    For all the cinematic references, it's true that <i>A Flat Inside a Fog</i>
    works best in a single sitting, heard to start to finish. These fragments and
    detours start to make sense when lined up in a row, as the mood crests and
    falls with the incredibly varied music. Bablicon may remain an enigma, but

It's a shame you can't see this; cynical, embittered
    individuals like myself are rarely subject to ear-to-ear Cheshire Cat grins.
    But listening to <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i>, I can't help but be happy.
    Really happy. Another beautiful record has entered my life, and I have no
    intention of letting it go any time soon.</p><p>
    
    This isn't the first time Summer Hymns has done this to me. In the year or so
    since it was released, Summer Hymns' brilliant debut album, <i>Voice Brother
    and Sister</i>, has become not only one of my favorite albums in recent memory,
    but one of the few albums that can make me feel good every time I listen to it.
    <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i> remains, in many ways, the perfect summer
    record-- the hazy, gorgeous melodies and slurred psychedelic production affords
    it an inexplicable quality of heat and comfort.</p><p>
    
    Considering all this, it's not surprising my expectations for <i>A Celebratory
    Arm Gesture</i> were ridiculously high. It's one of the few albums I've
    actually spent a good deal of time worrying about before hearing.  <i>Voice
    Brother and Sister</i> seemed like such a perfect one-shot album-- the band
    name, the album art, and the beautiful songs, some of which had been floating
    around in lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter Zachary Gresham's head since
    high school. Honestly, I wasn't sure if they'd be able to pull it off again.</p><p>
    
    And in some ways, I was right. <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i> is certainly
    not a sequel to <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i>. The production is much
    cleaner and the album as a whole seems decidedly less psychedelic. More
    importantly, perhaps, <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i> sounds much more like
    a band record than <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i>, with each individual
    musician contributing his or her own unique influence to the record's sound.</p><p>
    
    Though the production on <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i> is cleaner than on
    <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i>, the songs have grown more complex.  But never
    do they sacrifice the seamless melodies and diverse instrumentation that truly
    made their debut great. ""Something's Going On,"" the song that originally bore
    the title of the album itself, manages to be both tremendously sophisticated
    and instantly accessible. Derek Almstead's flowing, highly melodic basslines
    are a key part of <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i>'s sound, and ""Something's
    Going On"" features two of his finest. But Almstead's playing is only icing on
    the sweet, sweet cake of Zachary Gresham's songwriting skills. ""Something's
    Going On,"" like many of the album's finer tracks, has several distinct parts,
    including a flat-out gorgeous bridge with a flute melody and lyrics like, ""As
    long as there are words/ And one breath left in me/ There will always be one
    more song for you.""</p><p>
    
    On the slower and more melancholy side of <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i> are
    two hazy, contemplative ballads, ""I Could Give the World Away"" and ""Closure
    Eyes."" The former features an almost Mazzy Star-ish wash of slide guitar,
    harmonica, organ, and strummed acoustic guitar-- one of the most affecting,
    bittersweet moments of <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i>. ""Closure Eyes"" opens
    with a fluttering piano melody, swells of slide guitar, and a descending
    bassline that perfectly matches Gresham's sad, enchanting lyrics. At the four
    minute mark, the song shifts into a tottering guitar drone with marching
    band-inspired snare drum fills.  Soon, a burbling analog synth comes in,
    segueing perfectly into the record's most surprising track, the melodic IDM
    of ""The Daybreak."" Glitchy and warm, ""The Daybreak"" would actually be more at
    home on a Boards of Canada LP.</p><p>
    
    Just as <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i> was a perfectly constructed album,
    every aspect of <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i> seems to fit together without
    flaw. The sequencing begins with more upbeat numbers and gradually segues into
    the complex ""Something's Going On,"" and finishes with the bittersweet beauty
    of ""I Could Give the World Away"" and ""Closure Eyes,"" each track interspersed
    with other gorgeous songs and instrumentals.  Also, as with its predecessor,
    <i>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</i>'s cover art seems perfectly matched to the
    album itself, combining nature and wildlife with hazy urban landscapes.</p><p>
    
    Rather than falling into the dreaded sophomore slump, Summer Hymns have
    accomplished a truly impressive feat: transcending their bandname to create
    a perfect record for all seasons.</p></div>"|7565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7565-a-celebratory-arm-gesture/|8.8|Matt LeMay

The cover
    art for the Beans' second album features a photograph of a dilapidated
    high-rise.  It's unclear whether the frame is being built up, torn down, or
    refurbished.  The back cover contrasts two photographs: one of a diesel-powered
    truck in a hazardous waste zone; the other of a verdant rainforest.  As I open
    the jewel case, I'm expecting an album of violent extremes, a force that uses
    its constructive tools to demolish itself.  But, silkscreened on the compact
    disc, the image of a cartoonish bird crane appears, head down.  And that
    figure serves better as a metaphor for my disappointment with this record.</p><p>
    
    Beans are a five-piece group from Vancouver, British Columbia.  They approach
    music improvisationally, rarely playing a song the same way twice.  Local
    musicians add color to the compositions, bringing their own array of
    instruments.  So it bothers me that, from such a range of possibilities,
    they've sequenced their three least original pieces first.  ""Windows y Tower""
    kicks things off with horn blasts at irregular intervals.  If this is found
    sound, it's more ""high school band tuning time' than ""The National Anthem.""
    There's silence, then minimal guitar and bassline interplay, followed finally
    by some pretty intense drumming.  But the lead guitarist has this annoying
    habit of trilling out series of notes, and the band doesn't back him up by
    giving this song the climax it deserves.  Instead, a violin tries its best to
    climb to A Silver Mt. Zion, and just ends up as haze hovering below.  It all
    ends somewhere near the 12-minute mark.</p><p>
    
    ""Slow Recovery"" builds similarly.  Mournful guitars elicit comparisons to
    that other gloomy Canadian collective, until, I kid you not, someone decides
    to fade in three minutes of Aphex Twin's ""Metal Grating"" from <i>Selected
    Ambient Works Volume II</i>.  Beans' use of samples works when employed with
    more subtlety, though, from drops of rain to occasional Nintendo beeps and
    cupboard creaks.  Other times, it just sounds like they've left the television
    on, or let a burglar fumble about their living room while the cat walks across
    the piano.  ""Boston RWA"" begins with a nasty chainsaw sound, evoking the
    industrial fetishism they've been hinting at.  Unfortunately, after minutes
    of aimless guitar meandering, and even a nice, thick bassline which meshes
    with some progressive drumming, the band plasters on a trumpet chorus from
    Cerberus Shoal for a pleasing but highly derivative tempo change.  This could
    have been a great song without the intrusion of the album's first lyrics, but
    the lead singer finds the worst possible vocal affection to deliver the already
    weak line, ""I think I'll stop loving you.""</p><p>
    
    Why the curious, eerie pieces were hidden as the last few tracks is beyond me.
    ""I Breathe the Air (From Other Planets)"" wafts up on the breaths of sampled
    operatic voices, and suddenly, discordant piano accents dance with drums,
    like a creepy carnival parade heard from a block away.  The contemplative
    guitar chords and tinny drums of ""Vent du Nord"" make it the most simple work
    on the album, and it calms like the best of Yo La Tengo's later records.
    Finally, ""Hollow Stars"" is a tapestry of sounds as heard by an infant trying
    to make sense of its tenement building: female vocals coo, synths shift ground
    slowly, and a drum machine and live percussionist weave together soft jungle
    rhythms to create a beautiful lullaby.</p><p>
    
    I mentioned earlier that <i>Crane Wars</i> disappointed me.  It's not a bad
    album, but the band's sound doesn't seem its own, and the production isn't
    hi-fi enough to flesh their sound out.  Much of the time they utilize
    toy-machine crane-arm tactics, piecing together whatever the clumsy claw picks
    up.  The fact that one bandmember, Tygh Runyan, periodically leaves to act in
    films like <i>Antitrust</i> no doubt adds to the disjointedness.  Beans don't
    come across as star side projects like Dogstar, though.  While it's great that
    rock bands are decentralizing their structure and exploring diverse styles of
    playing as if it were natural, few people are interested in weak jam-band
    collages.  Albums like this frustrate me, because with more concentration
    Beans could become a wrecking ball that demolishes all in its path.</p></div>"|602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/602-crane-wars/|6.1|Christopher Dare

    playing jokes. In his former band, MK Ultra, he attempted to convince people
    with their 1996 sophomore release, <i>Actual Motion Picture Soundtrack</i>,
    that the record was a real soundtrack for a yet-to-be released independent
    film. With his song ""Bill Gates Must Die,"" from his solo debut, 2000's <i>Mass
    Suicide Occult Figurines</i>, he wrote up a fake summons from Microsoft's
    legal department and got into the papers pretending to be sued by the monopoly
    (sorry, guys) for the song's content.</p><p>
    
    ""But now, his greatest hoax of all has finally hit the record shelves. <i>Time
    Travel is Lonely</i> may have been released under the name John Vanderslice,
    and it may sound like John Vanderslice, but the fact is that Vanderslice had
    <i>no part</i> in the making of the record! ...For the vocal tracks this time
    around, Vanderslice's engineering team of John Croslin and Scott Solter used
    Skywalker Sound in Los Angeles instead of the humble facilities of Tiny
    Telephone in San Francisco, his usual analog studio.  At Skywalker, they
    created a digital amalgamation between Jeremy Enigk and Katherine Hepburn to
    recreate his heavily affected singing style. 'We scanned their pronunciation
    patterns, then used Pro Tools to slow it down,' said Croslin. 'It was like a
    pitch-perfect Vanderslice. I'm still amazed by how lifelike it sounds.'
    ...Vanderslice could not be reached for comment, but a source confirms that
    he's on an isolated retreat to Antarctica...""</p><p>
<center>* * *</center></p><p>
    
    John Vanderslice's first album, <i>Mass Suicide Occult Figurines</i>, was not
    exactly an exercise in cohesion. The songs jumped from acoustic balladry to
    power alt-rock, from lo-fi synth-pop to chamber-string melancholy within the
    course of less than 30 minutes, with no element to tie them together. The
    songs were great, but they didn't make much of a whole. On <i>Time Travel
    is Lonely</i>, the thematic, cohesive side of solo John Vanderslice finally
    shows itself. The record kicks off with ""You Were My Fiji,"" the first song
    Vanderslice recorded after the release of his debut.  The song features Jeff
    Mangum-esque wailing and lo-fi acoustic guitars, but with a percussive,
    upbeat tempo and efficiency that's decidedly un-Neutral Milk Hotel. From
    there, it takes off into a record full of similarly bittersweet, remorseful
    pop songs, and this time, it sounds like they were all born to be on the same
    record together.</p><p>
    
    Vanderslice is clearly enthused about the recording process, and he's
    involved every step of the way. Like his debut, <i>Time Travel is Lonely</i>
    was committed to tape in his own Tiny Telephone analog studios in San
    Francisco with the help of engineers Scott Solter and John Croslin. The new
    album is also more fully deserving of ""solo record"" status; although it does
    feature supporting players (on electric guitar, bass and drums), the
    majority of the record was played by Vanderslice himself. As the basis of
    his songs, he provides acoustic guitar, Moogs and mellotrons, along with
    the occasional Rhythm Ace drum machine track and quirky sound effect.</p><p>
    
    He may be a singer/songwriter, but he seems to be more in the game simply
    for the pure love of sound, taking it from all sources. On one hand, he
    samples various materials for the record's three interludes-- two of them
    being classical recordings-- adapting and layering upon them as if they were
    his own. ""Interlude 2,"" which puzzlingly comes later in the record than
    ""Interlude 3,"" uses a harpsichord recording of Bach's ""Preludium Fugue #7""
    and adds warped delay, switched-on synth accompaniment, and a self-tracked
    choir for a fantastically eerie effect. On another hand, for the rocking
    title track, he samples the sound of a camera flash recharging and loops it
    to add punch to the power-pop chorus. The source of the effect is offbeat,
    but the sound is genuinely effective.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Time Travel is Lonely</i>, he explores lyrical concepts of isolation,
    remembrance and loss. The melodies generally maintain an optimistic major
    key, and the spacy interludes instrumentally support what the lyrics
    represent. Nostalgia is a key theme here, with different facets. Some of the
    songs tell of lost relationships, deaths, and childhood, while some take
    their tales directly from literary sources. ""Little Boy Lost"" and ""If I
    Live or If I Die"" update somber poetry by William Blake and set them to
    catchy pop songs. The latter proves to be more effective, and one of the
    standout tracks on the record. Vanderslice sings Blake's humanist tale of
    the accidental death of a fly to poppy, staccato piano chords, an
    arpeggiating Moog bassline and exuberant handclaps.</p><p>
    
    It seems, though, that Vanderslice wants <i>Time Travel is Lonely</i> to have
    more than just vague lyrical themes; he wants to take you to Antarctica. He
    wants you to experience the isolation from the real world that one experiences
    in a frigid wasteland. The packaging and liner notes prove the larger
    conceptual idea. The liner notes depict supposed letters from John's brother
    Jesse during many months living on ""a floating, unstable ice shelf."" Some of
    these letters seem to be the basis for the topics of some songs on the
    record; some others simply recall the feelings and events that would begin
    to cause ""polar madness."" None of them are real; for a bit of proof, lyrics
    that are attributed to Jesse in the letters are credited to John in the
    notes. But while these wouldn't be things one would guess from the
    non-specific theme of the lyrics, the overall concept does help it work.</p><p>
    
    In fact, it helps the feeling that the happiness of the melodies are only a
    device for comfort, to mask the insecurity and solitude that's finally
    beginning to reach me after so many listens. It's like Jesse writes in his
    lyrics to ""Time Travel is Lonely"": ""No one has ever made it this far in
    time..."" and it's painfully apparent when you're alone. The rock guitars, the
    bittersweet melodies, the soaring synths, and the soul-baring, primitive
    acoustic guitars are beautiful, but I'm starting to see the true message
    here. Behind Vanderslice's affected voice lies a pathos, whether it's genuine
    or not, whether it's real. In fact, there are very brief moments where he
    sounds so detached, so cold, that it's not hard to imagine the voice sort of
    existing outside of him, or not even coming from him.</p></div>"|8400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8400-time-travel-is-lonely/|8.0|Spencer Owen

    Trad, trad, it ain't a fad!</p><p>
    I look around the room-- a gymnasium moonlighting as a convention center.
    Needless to say, this is my first ""trad-rock"" convention (I lost a card game
    at <i>Pitchfork</i> HQ).  The gym is packed with 17-year-old British boys
    (I threw the game) cheering with youthful enthusiasm.  I take a quick survey
    of the t-shirts in the room-- Ocean Colour Scene, Travis, Kula Shaker, and
    Oasis.  One boy sports the words TRAD IS RAD on his chest, but the more
    humble TRAD'S NOT THAT BAD seems to be the tee of choice.</p><p>
    I have no idea what the fuck is going on.  So I ask the kid next to me, ""Hey,
    you, what's this trad?""  He meets my question with a blank stare.  I explain,
    ""I'm from out of town.""  Still no response.  ""I'm American.""  Only now does
    my ignorance seem feasible.  ""Oh.""  He finally opens up.  ""Trad-rock is...
    well... it's not really Britpop.  But you know trad bands... like the
    Chieftains-- they play traditional music.  So, trad-rock is really traditional
    rock and roll.""  To clarify, I ask him, ""So, you guys are into the Stones and
    Led Zeppelin?""  He laughs a knowing laugh and replies slowly, ""Don't you see?
    We're living in a post-Oasis world.""</p><p>
    I take a loop around and see a listening station.  Fran Healy of Travis is
    scheduled as the convention's keynote speaker, and I haven't even heard their
    third album, <i>The Invisible Band</i>.  So I put on the headphones and sit
    down.</p><p>
    The opening track and first single, ""Sing,"" shows off a banjo, and rejoices
    with a honeyball of a singalong chorus that proclaims, ""The love you bring
    won't mean a thing/ Unless you/ Sing, sing, sing.""  As cheesy as the song is,
    there's no denying that Healy <i>can</i> sing-- his voice is both easy on the
    ears and passionately expressive.  It somehow comforts with a wisdom and
    maturity that his banal lyrics ultimately betray.</p><p>
    ""Dear Diary"" opens with the lines, ""Dear Diary, what is wrong with me?/ 'Cos
    I'm fine between the lines/ Be not afraid/ Help is on its way."" While I'd be
    embarrassed to read that in an actual diary-- let alone in liner notes-- the
    sparse production is precise to an almost chilling effect, and Healy's
    impressive falsetto pulls it off convincingly.  Fran also keeps the song short
    enough that you're more likely to remember the effect of his gentle, wavering
    vocals than his questionable, drippy sentiments.</p><p>
    By the third track, <i>The Invisible Band</i>'s feeling pretty predictable.
    The songs are solid, but the band seem more to have found a formula that
    works than an individual voice.  Travis' roots lie in Paul McCartney (think
    Wings rather than the Beatles), and post-Style Council Paul Weller, but they
    also seem influenced by contemporaries such as Oasis and <i>The Bends</i>-era
    Radiohead.  The guitar milks a few melodic themes, so that many of the songs
    lack distinction.</p><p>
    The tracks here are supported by a fuller sound and more complex arrangements
    than on either of Travis' first two albums.  Banjos, synthetic orchestrations,
    and studio add-ins are employed to create a lush sound that's enjoyable at the
    cost of the punch of <i>Good Feeling</i> or the dark mood of <i>The Man Who</i>.
    They're all competently played, but never really inspiring.</p><p>
    ""Flowers in the Window (for Nora)"" is a rare break in the formula.  The
    driving chorus, ""Oh, wow, look at you now, flowers in the window/ It's such
    a lovely day, and I'm glad you feel the same,"" is a bit ridiculous, which
    for a band like Travis is a serious risk.  But on an album that otherwise
    feels too safe, their grand victory romp seems innocently fun.  Imagine a
    melody similar to the Lovin' Spoonful's ""Summer in the City"" if it were
    written like a showtune.  And performed by Glaswegians.</p><p>
    I don't mind Travis.  There are many far worse bands, and it's hard to go
    wrong with a humble, talented singer, a band who likes rock, Nigel Godrich
    and some synthesizers.  But Travis doesn't ever seem to say much, so I don't
    think I'm going to stick around for Healy's keynote speech.  The music makes
    me want to listen, but I just can't hear much of impact in the vague stream
    of lyrical clichés: ""The grass is always greener on the other side""; ""There
    is no wrong, there is no right""; ""I'd pray to God if there was heaven, but
    heaven seems so very far from here""; ""You are one in a million, and I love
    you, so let's watch the flowers grow""; ""When your bird has flown away, she
    was never meant to stay""; ""Everyday in every way I'm falling...""  Such
    pleasant sentiments will do well on the charts, but regardless of how many
    weeks they battle it out with Muse and the Stereophonics, it won't be enough
    for history to notice them.  <i>The Invisible Band</i>, indeed.  It's
    poignant, almost.</p><p>
    I still don't know what a ""trad"" is.</p></div>"|8144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8144-the-invisible-band/|6.1|Kristin Sage Rockermann

History tells us that some British journalist
    coined the phrase because the genre's early bands were more inclined to stare
    at the floor than to make eye contact with the audience.  This was likely
    caused equally by years of torment from their schoolmates and the insane
    amounts of heroin they were on.  Of course, that's just how it used to be done.
    These days, shoegazers are more likely just entranced by the rad bowling shoes
    they rescued from a thrift-store bargain bin.  But really, who names a genre
    ""shoegazer""?</p><p>
    Now in its 16th year (it's widely agreed that the shoegazing big bang occurred
    with the Jesus and Mary Chain's 1985 debut, <i>Psychocandy</i>), the genre's
    undergone some intense facial reconstruction.  The self-pitying gloom has been
    switched with sunshine, the sunglasses-at-night were exchanged for love,
    and the band that started it all dropped a few members and regrouped as
    Freeheat.  Yet, like the vampires that so inspired those early bands, the
    alabaster face of the genre remains untouched by the ravages of time.</p><p>
    The New York (by way of Michigan) trio Mahogany have found a common ground
    where old and new shoegazer fans can live together in both suicidal misery
    and perpetual contentedness.  It's called <i>The Dream of a Modern Day</i>.
    The record blends the downcast, dreamy sounds of early Lush and the Cocteau
    Twins with optimistic string sections, subtle drum programming and the sunny
    vocals of singer/cellist Allysa Massais.</p><p>
    Originally released on Clairecords in late 2000, the record has just been
    freshly reissued with the Darla label's spiky stamp of authenticity.  As it
    should be.  Mahogany are a Darla band all the way, from the whirring U of
    MBV guitars to band founder Andrew Prinz's dense, reverb-laden production.
    But where so many other xFC-shoegazer groups are content to pile layer upon
    layer of effects and instruments on their DATs and bask in the white-noise
    result, Mahogany have clearly spent hours behind the mixing board, perfecting
    the levels for a glimmering sheen that reflects both the dirtier elements of
    80's bliss-out and Dave Fridmann's recent work with Mercury Rev and the
    Flaming Lips.</p><p>
<i>The Dream of a Modern Day</i> begins with ""Movement I,"" a half-minute clip
    of a droning string quartet that's unexpectedly interrupted by the
    ""Copacabana""-style drum programming that opens the album's first song,
    the beautiful ""Chance.""  Prinz's production immediately impresses as the
    song bursts outward, spewing ride cymbals, glowing strings, and jangly
    guitar.  Massais' graceful, silky vocals effortlessly ricochet up and down
    the musical register, intoning unintelligible lyrics delivered as though
    they were crammed with infinite wisdom.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""Soleil Radieux"" fires off rounds of complex machine-gun percussion
    which are absorbed by a thick velvet curtain of orchestration; the ethereal
    ""Vista-dome"" pairs pounding kickdrums and showering cymbals with a mournful,
    ghostly melody and a downpour of violins; the stark ""Red Marrow, His Sorrow""
    is stripped to its rawest form, with only a shimmering, repeated guitar line
    and Massais whispering, ""It's the marrow deep red/ It's the soil richly black/
    It's the winter sun bleak white/ Inside of your coat warm gray.""  But the
    biggest surprise comes with the closer, ""Synchromie No. 1.""  Slickly automated
    thumps gradually give way to crashing drums and crescendoing, kaleidoscopic
    symphonies while guitars submerge themselves in a drony netherworld.  When
    the track's lush bombardment of beauty winds down, and the disc stops spinning
    with a final whir, the silence is somewhat unsettling.</p><p>
<i>The Dream of a Modern Day</i> would be a pretty outstanding record, even
    if created by the hands of seasoned studio vets.  That only a small handful
    of EPs precede this band's debut full-length is seriously cool, and seems to
    promise great things for their future.  If you've worn down the grooves on
    your old Catherine Wheel and Curve records and are looking for something more
    current, I point you in the direction of this fine album and suggest you
    become transfixed by a pair of cheap sneakers.</p></div>"|5046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5046-the-dream-of-a-modern-day/|8.4|Ryan Schreiber

Sure, the Düsseldorf duo of Klaus Dinger and Michael
    Rother would release subsequent material after <i>Neu! '75</i>: a handful of
    compilations, one live album, and the fruits of the duo's half-hearted
    mid-80's studio reunion (both of the latter two releases being bitterly
    contested by Rother). But there can be little doubt that <i>Neu! '75</i>
    serves as the group's final statement. So what happens when the new starts
    to grow old, when a band whose very name was an exclamation of novelty,
    begins to age?  It's a curious fold of thought: a visionary band in the
    process of maturation, but an old band that has become new to us.</p><p>
    Perhaps Neu never grew old; perhaps the world simply got wise to their sound.
    By 1975, Kraftwerk-- the group that spawned them-- had released <i>Autobahn</i>
    and gained international pop celebrity; Can had already mastered the music of
    propulsive ambience on <i>Future Days</i>; Faust had recorded the track that
    would give the entire genre its name; and punk was fomenting in the dives of
    England and America. 1975 was the year of Eno's <i>Another Green World</i>,
    and the year David Bowie began departing from his plastic soul phase in
    search of a synthetic futurism. Neu had been in hibernation for three years
    since the budget crisis-turned-serendipity of their tweaky sophomore effort.</p><p>
<i>Neu! '75</i> may have marked a personal reunion for Dinger and Rother, but
    there's little union to be heard. The record's lush ambience masks a primal
    tension at the heart, as if Neu were unsure to whom they would be leaving
    their legacy: new age or punk. ""Isi"" is propelled by Dinger's signature
    ""motorik"" percussion, but where we expect Rother's deft, industrialized
    guitar, we hear undulating synths and piano lines expanding out in concentric
    circles.  It's not an engine; it's an ocean.</p><p>
    The somber ""See Land"" is a similarly organic affair, drawing more on the
    ""kosmische"" sound of Ash Ra Tempel and Rother's own Harmonia project (with
    Roedelius and Moebius of Cluster) than the factory aesthetics of Kraftwerk
    and Faust. Dinger's sparse, syncopated rhythm treads lightly beneath the
    bright, processed lines of Rother's singing guitar. Unfortunately, ""See Land""
    operates by sheer repetition, a strategy employed to dazzling effect in the
    robotics of their earlier albums, but suggestive here of a fundamental
    aimlessness. The track dies on a volume fade-out, simply because there was
    no tension to resolve. Just drift.</p><p>
    You must reconstruct <i>Neu! '75</i> in its original incarnation as vinyl in
    order to fully appreciate the bruising finality with which ""Leb Wohl"" would
    have concluded the first side. If the first two tracks were somewhat
    ambivalent about the preference for ambience over trajectory, ""Leb Wohl""
    resolves all doubts. Over nine minutes, the track blends plaintive piano,
    metronomic percussion, distant organ, and tidal washes beneath Dinger's
    almost-spoken vocals. One can think of Talk Talk's artful deployment of
    silence as a reference point. There are even moments in the glacial emptiness
    of ""Leb Wohl"" when one half-expects the advent of a Nordic she-male crooning
    heavenly in a made-up language.</p><p>
    And just when you've resigned yourself to this new ethereal Neu, the
    industro-punk ""Hero"" snarls in with all the dirt and blues of the early
    Stones. Dinger growls out indecipherables somewhere between Jagger and
    Rotten, while Rother's burning guitar is finally emancipated from the benign
    oppression of the synths.  It's the motorik of the world on the verge of a
    fuel crisis.</p><p>
    That insurgency is sustained throughout the lengthy ""E-Musik,"" driven by the
    alien percussion of drums run through a phase shifter. The guitar skitters
    like pure electricity, while exploratory synths assume their proper place on
    the horizon. ""E-Musik"" has perfected the equation: the acid-fried expanse of
    their debut distilled through the radical proto-punk of their second album,
    and punctuated by spells of dreamy ambience.  All that remains is the primal
    shove of ""After Eight,"" perhaps the grittiest and meanest sounding track the
    duo ever put its name on.  Instead of a victory lap, Neu throttled into
    overdrive.</p><p>
    And finally, breakdown. The world was catching up just as the engine blew
    out. And there wouldn't be another chance for Neu to show that they were
    still ten steps ahead of everybody else. The world was getting wise to their
    sound. So would you have been surprised then when the phone rang just a year
    after this record was released?  Seems David Bowie had been swapping the band's LPs
    with Eno lately.  He phoned up Rother, mentioned something about Berlin, a
    new sound, some project with Eno, and hey, maybe you'd like to sit in? The
    project, of course, would be <i>Low</i>. And Rother declined.</p></div>"|5756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5756-neu-75/|8.5|Brent S. Sirota

    they had left Kraftwerk, overcome their fear of broccoli, saved Camp Chippewa
    from the machinations of an unscrupulous real estate developer, and recorded
    a masterpiece that would influence independent music for decades to come. The
    year is 1973, and again the dynamic duo is holed up in a studio with
    Can/Kraftwerk producer Conrad Plank to record their sophomore effort.</p><p>
<i>Neu 2</i> stands primarily on the strength of its eleven-minute lead-in
    track, ""Für Immer.""  The song is pounding and serpentine, its straight-ahead
    rhythms approaching punk, while guitars buzz like helicopters overhead. As
    Plank twists the knobs, the drums take on a thin, mechanical quality.  The
    guitars are banished to the background, only to be inverted again with
    renewed force. Washed-out feedback drones in and out, while the bass plods
    on with undeterred aggression.</p><p>
    ""Spitzenqualitat"" is equally confrontational, dominated by hard, reverberating
    drums pounding at various tempos somewhere in the deep space of whispering
    guitar effects. The track proceeds as if Plank somehow turned up the gravity
    in the studio: the percussion becomes slower and heavier, as the guitars grow
    emptier. ""Spitzenqualitat"" simply falls apart as if it can't be sustained;
    the silence is too dense. ""Gedenkminute"" is nothing but the sound of that
    dissipation; something of a throwaway, it consists of nothing but wind and
    the occasional clock chime. ""Lila Engel"" is truly krautpunk, featuring
    Dinger's nonsensical chant: a cross between Damo Suzuki and Johnny Rotten.
    It's dour but explosive, channeling Neu's fierce repetition into something
    anthemic.</p><p>
    Then something happens. In the Nintendo world, the sound of tinkling
    electronic music suddenly running at double-time can only signal one thing:
    you are running out of time. But in the real world, it means something else
    entirely: you are running out of money. I guess it's to their credit that
    our insolvent heroes didn't simply pad out the remainder of <i>Neu 2</i> with
    a giant sucking sound, or the minimalist ambient textures of Rother and
    Dinger turning out their pocket linings.  Instead, they proceeded by inventing
    the modern remix.</p><p>
    ""Neusachanee 78,"" ""Super 76"" and ""Super 78"" are surgically deformed versions
    of the album's two singles, ""Neuschnee"" and ""Super.""  Fragmented, spliced,
    and filled with background noise and studio chatter, these tracks lay bare
    the process of studio production. Likewise, the tapes in ""Hallo Ecentrico!""
    rewind, fast-forward, and are eaten up by the machine. An inventive way to
    compensate for lack of funds, and even an ingeniously subversive commentary
    on music-making, these broke-ass experiments don't satisfy like the original
    tracks. Thankfully, the budget allowed for the album's superb closer, ""Super,""
    a heavy, yet fluid assault of pounding drums and rubbery bass, complete with
    Dinger's savage howls; ""Super"" may just be the Boredoms' long lost uncle.</p><p>
    And so, with an album, half-brilliant, half-ludicrous, in their hands, our
    heroes go out to face a cold world armed to the teeth with ""You so poor...""
    jokes.  Will they redeem themselves before God, country and indie posterity?
    Will their albums ever see U.S. release? Will East and West Germany ever be
    reunited, and if so, will Roger Waters make good on his promise to stage
    <i>The Wall</i> live in Berlin?  Will Pink Floyd even record <i>The Wall</i>?</p><p>
    Stay tuned, true believers.</p></div>"|5757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5757-neu-2/|7.5|Brent S. Sirota

As part of a court-ordered apology for unleashing Fatboy Slim on an unsuspecting universe, the Astralwerks label has undertaken the incredibly noble task of re-releasing the first three albums by the legendary Düsseldorf duo Neu. The albums are to be played round the clock at Astralwerks HQ; the cheap Crayon graphics of the compact disc are to be pinned on shirts like scarlet letters; all employees are to dance the Robot at all times. We need to praise Neu like we should.</p>
<p>As far back as I can remember, the first three Neu albums languished in the Import-only Impossible; the Japanese letters on the sleeves were incomprehensible, but also painfully explicit: prohibitively expensive, they screamed. And now, their stateside release has opened up unimagined worlds to the ears, cheap!</p>
<p>And like the band's moniker promises, this music is new. Strange and visionary, but so incredibly familiar. Why? Because a record originally cut in 1972 by a splinter off the indomitable Kraftwerk has seeped into the musical consciousness of a generation; its influence is everywhere. Listening to Neu recalls that giddy, pointless thrill of standing at the Four Corners in the southwestern United States. What's the big deal? Well, nothing, really, except maybe the sense of being in many places at once. That's Neu: standing with cocked German eyebrows at the nexus of shimmering space rock, processed psychedelia, mechanical kraut, and wonderfully libidinal disco.</p>
<p>Upon hearing ""Hallo Gallo,"" the first track on <i>Neu</i>, a friend of mine started inadvertently humming an organ line from Tortoise's ""Djed."" That quiet gesture summed up the album for me: listening to the past and hearing so much of the future. But Neu is no mere missing link. ""Hallo Gallo"" is a masterpiece of rhythm: tight drums, funky guitar scratch, a coolly insistent bassline, futuro synths, and effects-laden guitar slinging wide acid-fried launches into deep space. Neu is remarkably economical where its influences cultivate excess: the exploratory guitar and keyboards discover new aural landscapes where the pioneers of prog would remain hours blissfully adrift. ""Hallo Gallo"" is intelligent dance music in every sense of the term: it's the ass inviting the mind out onto the floor. Nobody leads; both are simply in motion.</p>
<p>""Sonderangebot"" is a murky soup of noise and silence: an interlude of clanging cymbals, and ambient fuzz, a kind of breathing nebula. The song bleeds darkly into ""Weißensee,"" a droning parade of dirty, cone-filtered guitar that anticipates the pastoral psychedelia of Flying Saucer Attack and Hochenkeit. ""Negativland"" opens in jackhammer drills and coalesces into a lock-tight, bass-driven martial progression of stabbing guitar and industrial noise: it's dark but strangely danceable. Something like krautpunk: syncopation, cerebral and serrated.</p>
<p>Neu is music with the proper documentation: it passes from one musical realm to another without the jackbooted border patrol so much as blinking an eye: this is sound with the highest level security clearance. And when it shifts from one sound to the next, it never winks at you with postmodern irony, never elbows you in the ribs to let you in on the joke. Neu is truly a citizen of the musical universe, at home everywhere and everywhere at once. And Astralwerks' re-release of this phenomenal debut could only serve as a long overdue recognition of this fact. For perhaps without Neu, there would have been no Astralwerks; worse, without Neu there may have been no <i>Pitchfork</i>. Neu anticipates us all. Now who's your daddy? Come on, say it!</p></div>"|5754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5754-neu/|9.7|Brent S. Sirota

    the living-room listening side of the drum-n-bass spectrum.  The beats on
    1996's <i>68 Million Shades</i> came complex, but despite their rapid pace
    the overall sonic texture was subdued, making for a smooth, pedestrian vibe.
    The following album, <i>Busy Curious Thirsty</i>, locked into the harder
    dance groove that was developing at the time, though a closer listen showed
    that the real intent was the creation of a roughened, more diverse sound.
    The new direction lost a lot of their audience, though, and the ambient
    pieces were numbingly repetitious.  In a typical major label move, Island
    dropped the duo from its roster.</p><p>
    
    Since then, John Coxon and Ashley Wales have been working hard, and each of
    their recent endeavors have been more successful-- from the driving, eerie
    <i>Treader</i> to the slightly softer, more cinematic <i>Disappeared</i> and
    the noisy ambient experiments collected on <i>Oddities</i>.  They've also
    taken a cue from Fila Brazillia, who produced the strangely pristine luster
    on Greg Dulli's Twilight Singers project.  Coxon &amp; Wales collaborated with
    Low in 2000 on the <i>Bombscare</i> EP, in which all junglist tendencies
    vanished, subsumed into Low's stark minimalism; likewise, Alan Sparhawk &amp; Co.
    found their fragile song frames reinforced by a mesh of synthetic subtlety
    and carefully controlled drones.  The union got called ""experimental"" mostly
    due to the uncomfortable tension the album evoked.</p><p>
<i>Masses</i> invigorates the Thirsty Ear label's fusion project, ""The Blue
    Series Continuum.""  Spring Heel Jack have toyed with jazz since their early
    days-- sampling a brassy trumpet trill here, employing a live percussion
    sample from Tortoise there-- but as time progressed, they showed interest in
    jazz as a structural template rather than cut-and-paste decoration. For
    <i>Masses</i>, they recorded a number of ambient soundscapes composed of
    crackling feedback and found sound (once again absent of breakbeats), and
    gathered choice labelmates to improvise over the recordings.  Some of the
    most influential names in the new breed of free jazz participated, from the
    dynamic duo of pianist Matthew Shipp and double bassist William Parker to
    mercurial saxophonist Evan Parker.  The result is the most intense,
    fascinating album of Spring Heel Jack's career.</p><p>
    
    ""Chorale"" opens in static pulses.  Shipp hesitantly takes lead with four-
    and five-note piano clusters, while William Parker's bass explores the space
    between the rumbling drones.  One aspect of the prerecorded soundtracks is
    that the musicians can slow down and test intimate, abstract harmonies
    usually only available to duos and trios.  Evan Parker's lone soprano sax
    line repeats after long intervals, intriguingly programmatic considering his
    usual repertoire.  This melancholy motif is the only semblance of melody in
    the entire song, and the noir ambience would fit perfectly in <i>Blade
    Runner</i> when Deckard sips his drink alone in the dim living room.</p><p>
    
    ""Chiaroscuro"" defines an opposite approach-- an amplified two-note bassline
    followed by a handclap serves as the rhythmic anchor for the entire track.
    Hardly boring, this relentless, aggressive reverb is the current through
    which Daniel Carter runs his saxophone, at first a playful expedition that
    becomes increasingly strained and frenetic.  Guillermo Brown busts three
    minutes afterwards with overlapping bass-drum rolls and snares, adding to
    the uneasiness.  Trying to isolate the organic from the preprocessed is
    difficult; at times, the streaks of Ed Coxon's violin blend seamlessly with
    the humming bed of distortion.</p><p>
    
    The title track, on which all players are involved, is by far the standout.
    Brown plays schizophrenically liberated percussion, abusing cowbells and the
    drumstand itself as pianist Shipp jabs at the low register ivory keys.  A
    sudden crescendo: seconds too late, you realize these were pebbles before the
    rockslide.  The onslaught erupts, burying the listener in a lung-collapsing
    surge of saxophone wails, trumpet squeals and double-bass throttling.  The
    moment ends as soon as it began, dispersing into Brown's maniacally inspired
    building-block clatter.  If the ascendant free jazz of the 1960's came to be
    known as ""Fire Music,"" the elemental force here takes place somewhere between
    metamorphic earth and storm-strewn air, though the electrical fury can hardly
    be traced back along its silicate tangents to any original resting place.</p><p>
    
    But don't assume that the entire album is impenetrable noise.  A few short
    interludes separate the longer works, giving single musicians the chance to
    test their mettle against the compositions.  On ""Cross,"" I felt transported
    to a swirling fantasia, sure that the background was tampering with
    Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" until I realized that this was just Mat Maneri
    in the foreground on acoustic and electric viola.  ""Salt"" is a comparatively
    straightforward number, launched by Brown and William Parker's hard-bop
    rhythm and spiced by Shipp's Monk-like vamping.  But the final track, ""Coda,""
    returns to the spatial acoustics of the first.  Coxon and Wales pull the
    buzzing chimes of their earliest work off the lathe, causing the trumpet-like
    microtonality of Maneri's viola to recede into the background.</p><p>
<i>Masses</i> compresses so many components: improv artists from New York jam
    with Londoners and other Europeans, organic instruments collide with digital
    spree, free jazz is tempered by prerecorded loops.  Curated by Matthew Shipp
    and sequenced by the Spring Heel boys, this is steaming hot fusion, a record
    whose density and emotional nuance requires repeated listening to decipher.
    Many questions are raised, but the one that tugs most anxiously in my mind
    is whether Coxon and Wales will attempt improvisational electronics
    themselves on future projects.</p></div>"|7438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7438-masses/|8.6|Christopher Dare

    Let's consider the choon of 2000, Hatiras' ""Spaced Invader."" Beginning with
    a Todd Terry-ish rhythm loop, the track discloses its two tropes pitifully
    soon after. Trope one: the EQ rush (the section of a woeful number of
    records wherein all sound is muffled, and then rushes back into hi-fi
    clarity).  Trope two: Atari video game melody.  Actually, to use the term
    ""melody"" would be pushing it a bit, in this case-- the synthline that
    masquerades as a melody is more similar to the beeps that ""Super Breakout""
    makes if you bust down walls every 40 seconds.  And while being an
    accomplished ""Super Breakout"" player does not earn you bonus points on
    college applications, it does give you more kudos in certain social groups
    than being a renowned master in, say, booger-rolling. Anyway, video game
    noises in house music records are universally boring.</p><p>
    In opposition to such facile crowd-pleasing tactics, another school of house
    music has arisen, and may be termed ""the Real House music movement."" These
    producers and DJs are usually a reactionary bunch who prefer the good ol'
    daze when Marshall Jefferson still ruled Ten City and Larry Heard
    righteously slapped down Lucifer during the ""Can You Feel It"" sermon.
    Notable Real House music mavens, such as Francois Kervorkian and Joe
    Claussell, have made commendable efforts to introduce Fela Kuti's Afrobeat
    and Cesaria Evora's Cape Verdean fados into their Body and Soul sessions.
    Regrettably, a facile bandwagoning wing of this school is content to wear
    out the grooves of EBTG vs. Soul Vision's officially released bootleg
    ""Tracy in my Room,"" Negrocan's ""Cada Vez"" and St. Germain's ""Rose Rouge.""
    Real House music also manifests boring tendencies.</p><p>
    UK house and techno bod Matthew Herbert is here to save us. His house music
    inclines to the Real school, but commendably avoids all the hempy acid-jazz
    baggage and Madame Jo Jo's deep funk obscurantisms. Instead, Herbert's house
    is built on fractures, the shingling of cracks, clicks, and mistakes, and
    his partner's gorgeously melancholic torch song voice.</p><p>
    For the foundation of <i>Bodily Functions</i>, Herbert has taken the title
    of his Tresor mix disc, <i>Let's All Make Mistakes</i>, quite to heart. In
    fact, he's developed a ten-point manifesto outlining his Personal Contract
    for the Composition of Music (PCCOM) that succinctly incorporates his
    Manifesto of Mistakes.</p><p>
    Important PCCOM doctrinal points are as follows:</p><p>
<blockquote>
    \t<i>Only sounds that are generated at the start of the compositional
    \tprocess or taken from the artist's own previously unused archive
    \tare available for sampling. The use of, ordering and manipulation
    \tof noise-sound/found-sound is to be held as the highest priority
    \tin composition.</i> (tenet 2)<p>
    \t<i>The sampling of other people's music is forbidden.</i> (tenet 3)</p><p>
    \t<i>No replication of traditional acoustic instruments is allowed
    \twhere the financial and physical possibility of using the real ones
    \texists.</i> (tenet 4)</p><p>
    \t<i>The inclusion, development, propagation, existence, replication,
    \tacknowledgement, patterns and beauty of what are commonly known as
    \taccidents, is encouraged. Furthermore, they have equal rights
    \twithin the composition as deliberate, conscious, or premeditated
    \tcompositional actions or decisions.</i> (tenet 5)</p></blockquote>
    In restricting the sampling of other music, tenet 3 compels Herbert to
    originality; tenet 4 prioritizes the sonic aura that acoustic instruments
    lose when crudely digitized; and tenet 5 acknowledges that unintended sounds
    may be essential emergent properties of the creative process.  In tenet 5,
    Herbert doesn't go as far as William Burroughs did in explaining that his
    cut-ups and novels were the pressures of a demon external to him. So we
    know that while Herbert may be a wee bit Benedictine in his rules, he's
    not a paranoid conspiracy junkie nut. And on the clear evidence of <i>Bodily
    Functions</i>, these rules have gamely assisted Herbert and his collaborators
    to realize an undeniably beautiful artwork.</p><p>
    ""The Last Beat"" moves away from the random scattering of glitches into a
    Savannah, mint-julep-sipping afternoon slow waltz with Dani Siciliano posing
    unanswered questions (""Are you dreaming me?/ Is this feeling you?"") to an
    unheard, unseen dancing partner. The graciously restrained piano chords and
    Barry Guy-like acoustic bass remain aloof, allowing Siciliano's vocals to
    be the focus of our attention.  Yet, her questions are posed to us, and
    we're unable to grant her a single reply. Enhancing the song, Herbert's
    close miking of Siciliano's voice permits us to approach a contact point
    with her breath-- one of her/our bodily functions.</p><p>
    The duet ""You Saw It All"" is contrastingly definite (""And though I may
    never see/ All that you did/ Promise me nothing more/ You saw it all"") as
    Luca Santucci in a mixture of plaintive and resolute tones remonstrates
    with Siciliano, whose one rejoinder is ""you saw it all.""  This, of course,
    makes his gaze the authoritative version, and extinguishes her own view of
    the relationship. ""Suddenly"" begins as a house version of a <i>Boomerang</i>-era
    Creatures marimba ballad, but closes with a primed-for-Twilo tribal stomp
    dusted with clicks and an occasional soft piano chord every bit as sonorous
    and insistent as a Sunday morning church bell.</p><p>
    There's nothing smooth about the languid, yearning instrumental ""About This
    Time Each Day,"" in which Siciliano relates a haiku-brief story with her
    clarinet, as Phil Parnell's piano overrides her narrative. ""I Know"" drives
    like a Dave Holland Quartet piece, as uncovered in one of Jan Jelinek's
    loop-finding-jazz-records.</p><p>
    Beginning with another barely audible element (this mechanical churning
    noise is, in fact, the sound of a mouse attempting escape from a garbage
    can in Herbert's studio-- how about that for adhering to PCCOM tenet 5? ),
    ""Addiction"" peaks with Siciliano's lachrymose delivery of ""Just as I think
    it's done/ You're there/ Darkening the sun."" Herbert, once again the apogee
    of restraint, maintains the vocals' prominence by assuring that the Rhodes
    piano, the bass, and the percussion (this time an organized array of
    smashing glass bottle sounds) are more like suspicions than presences.</p><p>
    ""Leave Me Now"" entwines two Siciliano vocals, mimicking the conflict
    internal to this duet: ""Still don't know me/ (Tell me what you need)/ Each
    roll over/ It's so over/ Can't console me."" Herbert sets these words amid
    a sparse click track tenderly augmented with a nearly inaudible synth pad
    and an occasional piano chord. This song, like the others (don't call them
    ""tracks"") is jazz, set in a house framework. Only Ludovic Navarre's St.
    Germain project has successfully negotiated the perils of this type of
    jazz, but without the immense benefit of a vocalist-- let alone a vocalist
    as affecting as Dani Siciliano.  How far Siciliano has climbed from the
    cutesy Roisin Murphy-isms of Herbert's last offering, <i>Around the House</i>.</p><p>
    Herbert's incorporating of found sounds could easily have led him into
    novelty. To more transcendent effect than Matmos' use of surgical sounds
    on <i>A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure</i>, Herbert's found sounds are
    without referential baggage. Had I not learnt about the pail-breaking mouse
    on ""Addiction,"" my best guess for the source would have been a turning
    tumble-dryer. In this reference-free manner of sound appropriation, Herbert
    mimics in sound what he's achieved in his lyrics.</p><p>
    While Herbert's website espouses an overtly political message to them, the
    lyrics are ambiguous and indefinite. They are the all-but-blank canvas upon
    which each listener will form his or her own conclusion.  Whether you
    conclude that ""Leave Me Now"" is about global warming or your pestering
    mother-in-law is utterly your call to make. This ambiguity is going to
    infuriate the literal minded, but by the inclusion of this blurriness,
    Herbert has distinguished himself from house music producers whose vocalists
    trill trite slogans of self-actualization.</p><p>
<i>Bodily Functions</i> so effectively destroys every house music cliché,
    from which ever school, that my Romantic self wishes just to call this
    album ""high art.""  <i>Bodily Functions</i> is far and away the only
    jazz-informed house music album you'll ever need. I don't think what
    Herbert and his collaborators have achieved can soon be bested.  We can
    only say huge prayers that other producers will be inspired to deliver
    this cripplingly banalized genre from its pestilent self, and slap down
    Lucifer once again.</p></div>"|3834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3834-bodily-functions/|8.8|Paul Cooper

    all the people giving us a chance to play our rock n roll in this bleeping
    buzzing world.""  That got me to thinking, sometimes music has to be appreciated
    in a certain context.  I saw My Morning Jacket play a show recently in
    Washington, D.C.  Their twangy sounds seemed out of place that night, packed
    into a tiny club in an urban area, with car alarms blaring outside.  I wanted
    to be kicked back on a lawn chair, sipping some MGD and wiping at sweat while
    these guys played from an outdoor bandstand.  Something about the setting made
    it seem a more appropriate venue for bleeping and buzzing than alt-country.</p><p>
    
    I'm glad I can give the band a second chance.  Louisville, Kentucky's My
    Morning Jacket have packed the 74 minutes of this CD with 14 honest, straight
    up rock songs.  Don't be confused by claims from the record label, though,
    that, ""This is what those Palace-whozits and indie-Americana popniks all wish
    their albums sounded like.""  Most of the pieces have an upbeat, positive
    attitude, and even the slower folk songs don't attempt tortured Oldham-isms.
    The first song and title track actually teases with a half-minute of doomed,
    Palace-esque reverb and slow percussion, but warmth enters with acoustic
    guitar strumming and frontman Jim James' rich croon.</p><p>
    
    James has a strong, unique voice, and his only fault is that he stretches
    out each note about as far as possible, and on the highest notes something
    curdles in the back of his throat and he sounds like Kermit the frog.  Here,
    his lyrics deviate oddly from the rest of his efforts: ""They'll haul you out
    to the streets/ They'll burn your papers and your empty trash cans/ Beat
    this thought into your head/ ""All your life is obscene""/ But that's when
    my knife rises/ Their life ends and my life starts again.""</p><p>
    
    James doesn't address that 'us vs. them' paranoia much-- he's much more the
    lover type, always singing about his girl.  Yeah, the lyrics to ""Lowdown""
    have been soaking in the trite barrel too long (""Chancin'/ Glance in/ Sho'
    nuff mood for romancin'""), but they're as simple as the beautiful delay
    effect of the pedal steel guitar notes that make this song sound so great.
    ""The Way That He Sings"" is full of wonder about the way songs and relationships
    affect us, and it's propelled by a foot-tapping snare and pleasant vocal
    harmonies between the guys in the band.</p><p>
    
    ""Just Because I Do"" is all about drum crashes, angular guitar lines and
    harmonica, and shares that uplifting, devil-may-care quality that's the secret
    to a lot of good country and R&amp;B.;  The quieter numbers later on sound more
    like demos, featuring little more than James' plaintive vocals and careful
    picking.  ""If It Smashes Down"" actually unsettles its innocent opening with
    a description of ""a really fast, risky ride at the fair.""  Any chance of a
    carnival-like atmosphere is dispelled by his hesitant whimpers and howls.</p><p>
    
    I wish My Morning Jacket had more of these surprises hidden in their plaid
    sleeves.  ""Honest Man"" tries to lasso the ""classic"" Stevie Ray Vaughn blues
    instrumental but falls short.  The solo doesn't quite go nowhere, but it's a
    path you've been dragged down before.  Likewise, James rides the ""Sometimes
    I walk around town lookin' at faces/ Wonderin' why their bodies go to silly
    places,"" loner device into the ground.  But the hidden instrumental track at
    the end redeems it all; each note takes on a sense of jumbled autonomy, like
    the music of Songs: Ohia.</p><p>
    
    If you can, pick up the two-disc version of this album.  The second disc is
    a collection of demos, some of which appear as full songs on <i>At Dawn</i>,
    and some of which are unreleased.  It's not essential, but the feeling of
    intimacy is unparalleled.  There's something about voice and acoustic guitar
    together that creates the impression of fullness.  Maybe it's Trevor hollAnd's
    rich production.  Regardless, My Morning Jacket could be the perfect soundtrack
    to a summer road trip, or just something you wrap around yourself on the way
    to work each morning.</p></div>"|5533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5533-at-dawn/|7.1|Christopher Dare

    finally hit store shelves last Tuesday.  Since last October, we've been
    hearing that this album, recorded during the same sessions as last year's
    wildly experimental <i>Kid A</i>, would serve as a return to the band's
    mid-90's roots.  Now we come to find it was all a lie.</p><p>
    
    Not that it gets me down.  As far as I'm concerned, <i>Kid A</i> is Radiohead's
    defining achievement.  A total departure from the conventional rock formats of
    <i>OK Computer</i> and <i>The Bends</i>, <i>Kid A</i> drew from far more
    abstract and obscure influences than its predecessors.  Whereas previous
    outings captured echoes of U2 and Pink Floyd, <i>Kid A</i> took what it could
    use from the Talking Heads, Can, Talk Talk, and modern-day IDM artists, and
    combined it with Radiohead's irrepressible originality and sparkling, alien
    production.  Whether you liked the end result or not, the fact that they had
    the balls to challenge mainstream insipidness with such heroic creativity
    was admirable.</p><p>
    
    That said, <i>Amnesiac</i> is about as close to <i>The Bends</i> as Miss
    Cleo is to Jamaican.  And within the first ten seconds of its opening track,
    ""Packt like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box,"" the band crushes that rumor
    like a bug in the ground.  Sparse, clanging percussion evokes abandoned
    swingsets.  Keyboards whir to sonorous life, humming resonantly.  Guitars are
    curiously marked absent.  Production-wise, the track could have nestled cozily
    alongside <i>Kid A</i>'s strangest moments, yet its melody is stunningly more
    infectious than even that album's height of accessibility, ""Optimistic.""
    Amidst chattering synths and twisted metal, Thom Yorke casually insists that
    he's ""a reasonable man,"" and politely intones the album's most quoted lyric:
    ""Get off my case.""</p><p>
    
    The clattering, confrontational ""Packt"" segues awkwardly into ""Pyramid Song,""
    a sweeping piano-and-strings ballad, whose unusual timing is difficult to nail
    down until Phil Selway's live drums give perspective on the punchdrunk rhythm.
    Yorke croons some of his most poetic lyrics since ""No Surprises,"" inspired by
    passages from Herman Hesse's <i>Siddhartha</i>.  Amidst swelling orchestration
    and Satie-esque piano chords, Yorke croons a dream-like scenario in which he's
    visited by black-eyed angels, and his past and future loves.</p><p>
    
    4/4 traditionalists will take an immediate liking to the very <i>OK Computer</i>-ish
    ""Dollars and Cents,"" whose lyrical content is strikingly similar to the
    anti-government, anti-corporate themes expressed on the 1997 classic.  Jonny
    Greenwood's minimal, warped guitarwork and distant string arrangements float
    celestially over brother Colin's menacing basslines and Selway's delicate
    drumming.  ""Knives Out"" is another <i>OK Computer</i>-style reverbathon,
    replete with strummed acoustics, chiming electrics, and a not-too-tasteful
    rehashing of a prominent guitar line from ""Paranoid Android.""  Great melody.
    However, they've fucking used it before.  The song also loses points for
    containing the line, ""Shove it in your mouth.""  Really, Thom.</p><p>
    
    Similarly disappointing is ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors.""  Powered by a gritty
    industrial beat, the song's intentional abstractness, for the first time ever,
    seems forced and caricatured.  Thom's MacinYorke vocal treatments never seemed
    terribly groundbreaking, and here, the gimmick has gone utterly limp.  Yorke's
    lyrical content is also at its most unchallenging, as he educates us on the
    many varieties of doors that exist, over oafish, programmed beats worthy of
    a Cleopatra Records sampler.  Elsewhere, ""Hunting Bears"" is a two-minute
    instrumental clip of aimless guitar noodling that shoots for Neil Young's
    <i>Dead Man</i> soundtrack but comes off as a cutrate <i>Wish You Were Here</i>
    outtake.  A track like this is meant to segue into a related piece of music;
    instead, we're flung headfirst into the completely dissimilar ""Like Spinning
    Plates.""</p><p>
    
    If nothing else, Radiohead have always realized the emotional impact of a
    stunning album closer, and <i>Amnesiac</i> offers two.  Sitting side by side,
    ""Like Spinning Plates"" and ""Life in a Glasshouse"" are so vastly superior to
    the album's other tracks that the album's few misteps are easily forgiven.
    ""Spinning Plates,"" while a much better fit for <i>Kid A</i>, is nonetheless one
    of Radiohead's most affecting tracks to date.  It opens with a digitally
    simulated ""spinning"" sound, disorienting reversed keyboard, and subtle keyboard
    pings.  The song hits its peak when Yorke's indecipherable backwards vocals
    unexpectedly revert to traditional forward singing during the mournful climax,
    ""And this just feels like/ Spinning plates/ My body's floating down a muddy
    river.""</p><p>
    
    But if ""Like Spinning Plates"" would have been a fitting apex for <i>Kid A</i>,
    ""Life in a Glasshouse"" is entirely suited to the eclectic <i>Amnesiac</i>.
    Rather than creating a unique, Frankensteinian amalgamation from fragments
    of other genres, Radiohead instead target a style of music that hasn't been
    touched for decades: Edison-era big band.  In the process of adapting the
    archaic jazz sound to polyrhythmic piano chords and rock lyricism, Radiohead
    touch upon an incredibly unique sound that could potentially inspire an
    entirely new genre.</p><p>
    
    ""Glasshouse"" is most easily (and most often) likened to a New Orleans funeral
    dirge-- probably because it's not far off the mark.  Largely inspired by Louis
    Armstrong's ""St James Infirmary,"" this track is the least like the others on
    <i>Amnesiac</i>, and easily the record's winning moment.  When, amidst rueful
    trombone, tumbling clarinet, and the crushingly emotive trumpet of longtime BBC
    session musician Humphrey Lyttelton, Yorke insists, ""Of course I'd like to sit
    around and chat/ Of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat,"" and follows it
    with a minute of wailing ""only, only, only... there's someone listening in,""
    the intensity is indescribable.</p><p>
    
    Despite the heights attained by much of <i>Amnesiac</i>, I prefer <i>Kid
    A</i> for a number of reasons.  Quality aside, the questionable sequencing of
    <i>Amnesiac</i> does little to hush the argument that the record is merely a
    thinly veiled b-sides compilation; <i>Kid A</i> played out as a cohesive whole
    that evoked panic and paranoia as well as surrealism and disorientation.
    Still, <i>Amnesiac</i>'s highlights were undeniably worth the wait, and
    easily overcome its occasional patchiness.  Now if you'll pardon me, I have
    to go untie DiCrescenzo.</p></div>"|6659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6659-amnesiac/|9.0|Ryan Schreiber

    look back at what I wrote the first time and try to see how the band has
    developed since their last release.  Hefner's <i>Breaking God's Heart</i>
    is such a distant memory now.  It's like I reviewed it in the throes of
    some kind of fugue state.  I remember a Cockney accent singing some catchy
    songs, but that's about it. My own review provides few clues as to what
    Hefner might be all about. I made some puzzling and ultimately embarrassing
    remarks about Belle &amp; Sebastian, and then I tried to shoehorn some humor in
    by comparing Hefner to Poison.  This will not stand.  Clearly, Hefner are
    much more in the vein of Cinderella.</p><p>
    
    I think I understand now why I was at a loss for anything interesting to say
    about <i>Breaking God's Heart</i>. The music of Hefner just doesn't do much
    for me.  And yet, because it's not really <i>bad</i> in any discernable way, I
    don't have a particularly entertaining way to attack it. So this review would
    be much easier to write if I just explained my own personal development and
    ignored Hefner. But that's not why the 'Fork pays me, so I'm going to do my
    best.</p><p>
    
    In Hefner's favor, they subscribe to the virtues of classic pop songwriting.
    The chord changes line up with the melodies, which seem familiar but not
    overly so, and hence, are pleasant. The songs are banged out on guitars and
    pianos and have saxophones wailing in the background. The subject matter
    alternates between intimate relationships and the pros and cons of city
    living. The vocals often break into awkward yelling mid-song, as if singer
    Darren Hayman really means it (I believe he does, actually). But if it sounds
    like I'm describing The Commitments as an emo band, well... if the vintage
    boots fit...</p><p>
    
    That could sound more contemptuous than I mean it to be. In truth, about
    half the time Hayman takes off on his pitch-challenged flights of fancy,
    I want to follow him. The vocal break on this record's title song is
    particularly inspired, as Haymen's admittedly whiny refrain of ""if you don't
    love me,"" which swells perfectly with the instrumental surge, resonates
    emotionally.</p><p>
    
    But for every one of those, there's a discomforting moment, as on ""The
    Day That Thatcher Dies"". First, songs about Thatcher are why I ignored
    British rock in the 80s (my beloved Smiths excepted). Second, the riff
    is stolen from BTO's ""Takin' Care of Business"". And then, at the climax
    of the song, a child's chorus intones, ""Ding, dong, the witch is dead!""
    These guys could learn something about subtlety from Hugh Hefner. Sorry,
    this is decent pub-rock, but there are 1,000 albums released every day.
    Buy another one.</p></div>"|3800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3800-we-love-the-city/|5.2|Mark Richardson

It's called <i>The Tyranny of Distance</i>, and it's one of the best     pop albums of the year.  You won't be able to stop whistling the first song.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/> Kristin Sage</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>And that's all you have to say to a bosom friend.  But I wanted to tell more     people about this album, so I decided to write my first <i>Pitchfork</i> review in nine months about it.  I felt out of the groove, and articulating     my feelings about <i>The Tyranny of Distance</i> wasn't coming easily, so I     played Madonna's ""Into the Groove"" for inspiration.  It worked.  The material     girl's lifeless vocals, supported by a canned beat and slap-bass, reminded me     of what was at stake.  There's too much vacant, formulaic pop being pushed     out of vocoders and onto the airwaves for people not to hear this record.     Ted Leo's latest offers ample hooks, a uniquely expressive voice, and a     perfect single that, in a just universe, would be all over the radio.  I     wanted to tell the world of the album's riches! Riches of song! Plus, most     days I'd rather write a review than prove my love to Madonna.</p>
<p>After Leo's impressive work with Chisel and his legendary performances with     his brother Danny in the Sin Eaters, Ted Leo's solo work has been anything     but consistent.  It's ranged from unlistenable tape experiments to a great     cover of Thin Lizzy's ""Little Girl in Bloom.""  This album could have sounded     like anything.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it sounds like everything.  The first few chords of ""My Vien     Ilin"" instantly reminded me of the MTV theme that used to come on behind the     astronaut.  ""The Gold Finch and the Red Oak Tree"" uses the metaphor of a     message sent through a bird's simple song, and recalls the Beatles'     ""Blackbird.""  The last segment of ""Stove by a Whale"" sounds like it should     be played by Uilleann pipes.</p>
<p>When I saw Ted perform with the Sin Eaters, he was decked out in a denim     jacket with Rush scrawled on the back in magic marker, and the arena rock     sound is certainly a common denominator in Ted's equation.  Backing him here     are the Pharmacists, who probably sport similar jackets with ""The Who"" and     ""Wire"" marked on the sleeves.  The guys seem to have gotten a kick out of     passing the sticks around the studio-- the tracks featuring Danny Leo's     drumming become fist pumping anthems, while James Canty's kit harkens back     to Keith Moon showmanship.  James' brother Brendan (who produced the album     and can usually be found playing in Fugazi) even lends a hand on ""The Great     Communicator.""  Pete Kerlin and Alex Minoff round out the line-up on bass,     and Amy Dominguez from Telegraph Melts guests on cello.</p>
<p>This could all have easily turned into a giant mess, but as Ted sings on     ""Parallel or Together,"" ""So I gather around me all the pieces of a song/ And     fit them where they belong.""  And it really isn't any more complicated than     that-- Leo might be influenced by the Jam, Wire, and Thin Lizzy, but he's got     a guitar that never sounds confused, and an amazing talent to combine these     elements into something that sounds distinctly Ted Leo.</p>
<p>If I had to register a complaint, it's that ""Timorous Me"" could only be     described as ""very John Cougar,"" even if the first line wasn't, ""Me and     Johnny sittin' in the green grass.""  It opens with dueling guitars that     could take on the Allman Brothers in a bare-knuckles fight (and get the girl)     before settling into lyrics that seem nostalgic and forced.  But let's face     it: many songs on this album are simply poignant and earnest.  The fact that     only one turned to cheese is a testament the record's general ability to     deliver.</p>
<p>Two of the album's lyrical themes seem to reflect the fork-in-the-road Leo's     songwriting has approached: taking a step back to look at things in a simple     way, and finding songs in what he hears all around him.  In the past, it     seemed like Leo had to actively attempt to obscure his clear vision and     effortless pop songwriting in the name of experimentation or deconstruction.     That's not always necessarily a bad thing, sure.  But now, in ""Biomusicology,""     Ted sets the record straight: ""All the songs you hear down there/ They have a purpose/ All in     all, we cannot stop singing/ We cannot start sinking.../ We swim until it     ends.""  Well, I can't stop whistling the damn song, so let's hope Ted keeps     swimming.  Maybe next time he'll leave Johnny Cougar out of it.</p></div>"|4738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4738-the-tyranny-of-distance/|8.5|Kristin Sage Rockermann & Chip Chanko

At the tender age of 19,
    his <i>Ponyoak</i> album was garnering rave reviews from music critics
    worldwide and earning him a solid fanbase with its combination of anthemic
    pop hooks, clever lovelorn lyrics, and lo-fi recording charms. Graham went to
    Japan, where he became very popular, with throngs of underage pointy-featured
    Japanese girls throwing themselves at him.</p><p>
    
    Graham was very happy, indeed. But one thing still nagged him: while he was
    never hesitant to give himself full credit-- naming an album <i>Graham Smith
    is the Coolest Person Alive</i>, and naming himself alone in the thank yous of
    <i>Ponyoak</i>-- there was one member of his band that he had yet to give the
    slightest credit to. This vital entity had not only recorded all of <i>Ponyoak</i>,
    it was also responsible for sequencing, arranging, and countless other
    essential tasks.  Graham Smith had never thanked his computer.</p><p>
    
    Though his computer couldn't express its resentment directly, Smith could tell
    it wasn't pleased. The Cakewalk software he'd been using to record began
    causing general protection faults to the point of inoperability. Smith tried
    to appease the beast by thanking it regularly for its kind work, installing a
    shiny new DVD drive, and even spending five hours on the phone with Microsoft
    tech support, who told him that, to appease the temperamental bugs in Windows
    '98, the software would require a major software update and ""the sacrifice of
    two virgins, pure and true.""</p><p>
    
    Sadly, Smith was without a fast Internet connection, and all his friends were
    skanks. But he got the feeling that even obeying the orders of the Microsoft
    tech support guys would not quell the violent machine. From weeks of careful
    observation, Smith had finally decided what the computer wanted. Like any
    dejected-feeling band member, it just wanted to sing.</p><p>
    
    At first, Smith was a bit unsure. It was, after all, his shaky, crackly vocal
    delivery that had helped make <i>Ponyoak</i> such a success; he just couldn't
    imagine a computer taking on the intensely human emotions he depicted in his
    songs.  And suddenly, a lightbulb went off in Smith's mind: ""I know,"" he said.
    ""I'll record some songs about love and stuff that I'll sing. Then I'll mix
    them into a trite, fucked-up, occasionally funny but generally dull plot that
    somehow involves a computer. What's more, I'll make the computer say funny
    things. Like 'fuck' and 'cocaine.' Fourth grade was fun.""</p><p>
    
    And so, Smith set about to record <i>The Smith Album</i>, a two-disc set that
    he hoped would set things straight between himself and his computer. Sure
    enough, the computer worked without a hitch. But in the time it took Smith to
    conceptualize <i>The Smith Album</i>, he'd forgotten to write the actual songs
    for the record!  Fearing that the public would probably not respond well to
    an album that came off like a twisted hybrid of RZA's <i>Bobby Digital</i>
    and an Adam Sandler record, Smith sat down and wrote a bunch of mid-tempo,
    largely acoustic songs to flesh out <i>The Smith Album</i>.</p><p>
    
    While some of the finished songs, like the hook-propelled ""Reunited Airlines,""
    made Smith genuinely proud, he couldn't help but feel that the rest of the
    songs, which broke down mostly into either goofy, upbeat pop numbers or mellow
    folky acoustic tracks, just didn't live up to the widely varied songwriting he
    demonstrated on <i>Ponyoak</i>.  And his attempts to augment the album's sound
    with a plethora of synthesized sounds did little but cover up the weaknesses
    that once developed in his songwriting.  His computer was happy, though, and
    he'd been promising his fans a follow-up to <i>Ponyoak</i> for what seemed
    like ages. Feeling pressure from man and machine alike, Smith released the
    album to his eager fans, and hoped for the best.</p><p>
    
    Well, this eager fan is not pleased. Despite clocking in at a bloated 87:47,
    <i>The Smith Album</i> contains fewer actual songs than <i>Ponyoak</i> and
    nearly none of the inspiration.  What's more, the skits surrounding these
    songs just make them seem even weaker-- after a while, the egregious amount
    of filler on <i>The Smith Album</i> leaves you simply not giving a shit, and
    causes many of the songs that would otherwise seem heartfelt and sincere to
    just fade into ambiguity.</p><p>
    
    But there are moments of sharp-witted humor-- an in-joke about the frequent
    Guided by Voices comparisons, and the presence of a female computer virus
    named Melissa.  As the album's packaging suggests, though, <i>The Smith
    Album</i> registers more like an action flick than an album.  Sure, action
    flicks can be good for a few cheap thrills, but when's the last time you
    wanted to see one twice?</p></div>"|4488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4488-the-smith-album/|5.0|Matt LeMay

He's a little bit rock and roll. He's admired by     the likes of Björk and PJ Harvey. He sings songs about love, mountains, and     incest. He's released a gazillion albums, EPs, and singles under almost as     many pseudonyms and for almost as many labels. He's toured the world with cool     people like David Pajo in his backing band. He's made guest appearances on     records by the likes of semi-fossilized country icon Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, Will Oldham is a busy man. So busy, in fact, that it's hard to     imagine him having a lot of time to just kick back, relax, and spin a few of     his favorite CDs. But it makes sense that someone with such a keen grasp of     just how powerful music can be would spend a good deal of his time picking up     on the music of others. And with this appropriately-titled EP, Will finally     gives what we can only assume are those who inspired him the credit they     deserve.</p>
<p><i>More Revery</i>, originally released as a super-limited-edition tour-only     EP in Temporary Residence's <i>Travels in Constants</i> series, consists of     six cover songs, including new Oldham-riffic versions of tunes by Bill Withers     and Tim McGraw. Yes, that Tim McGraw. But the beauty of the Oldham machine is     that, no matter what goes in, the song that comes out winds up sounding not     just like one of Will's own songs, but like one of Will's better songs.</p>
<p>A pleasant cover of Mamas and Papas founder John Phillips' brief, folky     ""Someone's Sleeping"" opens <i>More Revery</i> with beautiful near-perfection.     Oldham puts his mark on the song within seconds, his unmistakable, quavering     voice intoning above sloppily-played piano, guitar, and sparse drums. Even     though it's foreign material, it's one of the most gorgeous songs Oldham has     recorded recently, and seems to fit his style as well, if not better than most     of the songs on his current full-length, <i>Ease Down the Road</i>.</p>
<p>While ""Someone's Sleeping"" seems like perfect fodder for an Oldham cover,     PJ Harvey's dark, droning ""Sweeter than Anything"" presents a greater challenge.     The fact that the version on <i>More Revery</i> seems to work so seamlessly     as a Will Oldham song speaks to Oldham's willingness to recast the songs he's     interpreting in his own image. ""Sweeter than Anything"" is almost completely     transformed, as it seems that Oldham is more interested in being true to     himself than being true to the song, replacing Harvey's quiet, barely-contained     intensity with his own wailing, foot-tapping brand of haunting Appalachian     passion. Similarly passionate is a blazing cover of ""Lean on Me"" singer Bill     Withers' ""Same Love That Made Me Laugh."" When Oldham sings, ""If you don't want     me, I don't want to live,"" his delivery is utterly convincing-- borrowed words     have rarely sounded this sincere.</p>
<p>As for the cover of Tim McGraw's mass-produced crap country hit, ""Just to See     You Smile,"" Oldham seems to accomplish the impossible, turning a McNugget into     a home-cooked chicken meal with all the trimmings.  Minus the glossy production     and sterile vocals, ""Just to See You Smile"" isn't all that bad, though the     lyrics remain admittedly cheesy. I doubt that Will Oldham is Tim McGraw's     biggest fan, but he's done the song a great deal of credit by giving it what     is certainly the best cover it will ever receive. Too bad Tim will probably     never hear it.</p>
<p>Sadly, <i>More Revery</i> does have one weak link: an awkward, reverb-drenched     cover of Jamaican singer John Holt's ""Strange Things."" Only here does Oldham     seem to lose a firm grasp over the source material, applying layers of     unnecessary vocal effects, and in doing so making his creaky voice sound     annoyingly inhuman.</p>
<p>Although it culls material from a diverse group of artists, <i>More Revery</i> owes its ultimate success to the fact that it sounds like Will Oldham. Very     few musicians are as capable of handling their own work as well as Oldham     does, let alone six very different songs by six very different songwriters.     He's covered Tim McGraw. He's covered AC/DC. Where will the future take him?     Let's hope he follows the only logical next step: a strummed acoustic guitar     and organ version of ""Big Pimpin'.""</p></div>"|697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/697-more-revery-ep/|8.0|Matt LeMay

Blur recently
    announced that their hiatus will continue through the year's end, due to Damon
    Albarn's collaboration with Norman Cook.  To make matter worse, another Albarn
    side project, Gorillaz, has already hit stores on both sides of the Atlantic.
    The novelty group finds Albarn assuming the role of 2-D, the animated lead
    singer of a pack of four misfits, whose likeness was envisioned by <i>Tank
    Girl</i> creator Jamie Hewlett.  The Automator-produced ""act"" is a smarmy,
    promotional gimmick.  And it's the best Blur offshoot released to date.</p><p>
    As soon as the record begins, the cartoon façade fades.  Even people who
    only know Blur as ""that band who did 'Woo-Hoo'"" will immediately detect
    Albarn's ever-so-Brit pipes.  Early reports suggested that Albarn contributed
    to only a few songs, but he could rightfully be called the band's frontman;
    his croon can be heard on all but 4 of the album's 16 tracks.  Dan ""The
    Automator"" Nakamura is similarly recognizable.  There's no band (animated
    or otherwise) making this music; it's the Automator throwing down beats,
    manipulating samples, and letting Kid Koala's scratches interrupt his flow.
    And that, friends, is why Gorillaz is a conceptual failure.</p><p>
    But maybe this is for the best.  Nakamura's refreshing production doesn't
    rely on today's hip-hop skitters and squiggles for its futurism.  No, what
    we've got here is the same brooding backpacker hip-hop that elevated the
    similar <i>Deltron 3030</i> LP to unforeseen heights.  As a result, this
    record reveals itself as far less disposable than its cartoon cover art
    suggests.</p><p>
<i>Gorillaz</i>'s best tracks exploit the unlikely, but successful dynamic
    between Albarn and Nakamura.  On ""Man Research (Clapper)"", Damon wails
    hysterically over Dan's relentless, echoing thump.  ""New Genious (Brother)""
    is gloomy trip-hop with orchestral flourishes that wrap around the flux of
    Albarn's falsetto.  On ""Clint Eastwood"", Del tha Funkee Homosapien handles
    the song's verses, allowing Damon a small cameo in the looped chorus.  And
    curiously, I can think of few other samples that would compliment Del's
    urgent delivery as effectively as Albarn's laconic vocal haze.</p><p>
    The album's foray into dub-lite, ""Slow Country"", is Gorillaz's charming peak.
    A light, Latin-tinged piano playfully slides over a sunny groove while Albarn
    exhibits ""Tender""-like plaintiveness with lines like, ""I can't stand your
    loneliness.""  Despite the fact that this track is unfamiliar territory for
    both Nakamura and Albarn, their charismatic playfulness makes for undeniable
    fun.</p><p>
    The small-scale experimentation, though, falls flat on the record's few rock
    tracks.  The appropriately titled ""Re-Hash"" is such a generic marriage of
    acoustic pop and stock hip-hop beats that, were Albarn to come in chanting,
    ""Come, m'lady, come, come m'lady,"" it would hardly strike as surprising.  The
    Wire reject, ""Punk"", suffers from an asinine formula (play a sloppy riff,
    clap three times, add cockney vocals, repeat) that makes each of the track's
    90 seconds harrowing.</p><p>
    That <i>Gorillaz</i>'s closing number-- Ed Case's two-step-meets-raga remix of
    ""Clint Eastwood""-- doesn't feel out of place could be taken as testament to how
    successfully eclectic the album is.  But in actuality, it's a sign of the
    record's short-lasting, faddish appeal.  Gorillaz is the definitive side-project:
    Even at its best, it's never more than a divergent one-off stint.  Albarn may
    occasionally succeed on non-Blur outings, but as with Coxon and Alex James' solo
    affairs, they only further prove that Blur is equal to much more than the sum
    of its parts.</p><p>
    Keep ya head up, Graham.</p></div>"|3524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3524-gorillaz/|7.0|Richard M. Juzwiak

I'm scared. It's not that I'm easily frightened. I can sit
    through the most gruesome horror movie, happily munching away on imitation
    butter-flavored popcorn while small intestines are strewn about the screen.
    I can watch news stories about mad cow disease while devouring sheep's brain
    soufflé.  But listening to the latest Of Montreal record, all I can do is
    curl up in a ball, smile the sick, twisted smile of the damned, and nod my
    head up and down in a rhythmic fashion.</p><p>
    If you're familiar with the work of Athens popsters Of Montreal, the
    disconcerting mix of a feeling of imminent implosion and a nagging urge to
    draw pictures of smiling bunny rabbits I'm experiencing at the moment probably
    doesn't surprise you. Of Montreal's music, and the bizarre artwork that
    accompanies it, plays like a surreal carnival-- it can be beautiful, it can
    be fun, and it can also be weird and creepy.</p><p>
<i>Coquelicot</i>, like most Of Montreal albums, is at times sublime and
    lovely, at times infuriatingly catchy, at times simply infuriating, at times
    overly twee, and at times seriously fucking scary.  What sets this record
    apart from its predecessors, though, is a level of intricacy and detail that
    Of Montreal have never previously attained as a band. The songs on
    <i>Coquelicot</i>, though crammed full of saccharine pop hooks, display a
    level of complex structuring and arrangement that could put most pop records
    to shame.</p><p>
    Of Montreal's trademark hyperactivity, and melodic yet off-kilter sensibility
    is possibly at its peak on <i>Coquelicot</i>. Seemingly drawing as much from
    the English music hall tradition as from American pop acts like the Beach
    Boys, there's nothing else out there quite like the frenetic, utterly
    wacked-out pop these guys come up with.</p><p>
    When the record's at its best, the group incorporates more diverse elements
    into their music than ever before. ""Good Morning Mr. Edminton,"" <i>Coquelicot</i>'s
    opener, is a typical Of Montreal song in prime form. Fuzzed-out guitar, bouncy
    piano, and multitracked harmonies by frontman Kevin Barnes set the stage for a
    demented tale of kidnapping and working class struggle as told, of course,
    from the kidnapper's point of view. ""The Peacock Parasols,"" which features a
    truly unforgettable, cryptic, and quite possibly misspelled lyric referring to
    ""P.P. icycles,"" goes from a pop song in warp drive to a dense, orchestral
    middle, and back.</p><p>
    Though fast-paced pop is clearly the bread and butter of <i>Coquelicot</i>,
    it's far from the only style to be found on this record.  They're not playing
    around about the ""variety of whimsical verse"" thing.  And sadly, this means
    the inclusion of the intolerable skit ""The Events Leading Up to the Collapse
    of Detective Dulllight,"" in which Kevin Barnes seeks to shatter your
    preconceived notions of reality by introducing a character whose name contains
    three consecutive ""l's."" After a series of good songs, nothing's quite as
    frustrating as hitting a 2\xBD comedy routine in which some guy named Slocks
    writes a poem called ""The Cause of Gauze.""  And then reads it aloud.</p><p>
    Besides annoying passages like these, the album's most challenging element is
    its length. At a solid 70 minutes, it's almost impossible to endure an entire
    sitting.  Had the filler been cut, this would easily be their best album yet,
    but repeated exposure to this stuff for that length of time can't be good for
    anybody.  Of course, I don't have to worry, because I'm a five-footed,
    owl-headed elf named Figgienewton!  Uh-oh...</p></div>"|5952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5952-coquelicot-asleep-in-the-poppies-a-variety-of-whimsical-verse/|8.0|Matt LeMay

<p>The Anasazi were the ancient forebears of the Native American Pueblo     people, who dwelt in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest.  The     Anasazi, or ""Ancient Ones"" as they were known in the Navajo tongue, famously     disappeared 700 years ago, leaving behind cryptic ruins, scattered evidence     of sophistication in astronomy and pottery, and one of the most challenging     archaeological puzzles in North America.  No one knows where they came from     or where they went.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>But what does that have to do with the band?   Admittedly, not much.  We know     where the hardcore quartet came from: they sprung fully armed and armored from     the foreheads of seminal Santa Cruz cult hardcore bands Mohinder and Jenny     Piccolo.  Likewise, we can guess where they're going: one LP, a couple split     seven-inches, and then scattered to the winds like spores of fungi to form other     like-minded bands.</p>
<p>But let's stick to the present.  The Anasazi are as unforgivable as they are     unforgiving.  Sonically, <i>Measurement and Control</i> is a terrible mythological     beast.  The sound is that of the deep, sonorous larynx of a Cthulhu-ish monster     steeped in bile and vitriol.  A guttural excretion.  It almost dares to walk the     line of the unlistenable.</p>
<p>All the trappings of deep hardcore are present: tinny drums perched atop the mix,     a treble wash, submerged vocals, and enough makeshift, vicious distortion to wipe     out a civilization are blendered with lethal centrifugal force.  The result is a     murky mess.  Where it aims for the bottled fury of Jenny Piccolo, it sails wide     right.  When it reaches for the smarter, more original work of Mohinder, it falls     short, dying by the hand of its own ambition.</p>
<p>The titles are wonderfully vivid: ""Getting One's Message from His Formaldehyde     and Autistic Animal Pieces,"" ""Premeditated Amphetamine Killing Spree,"" and ""Holy     Crusade Against the Godless Forces of Intercellular Communism.""  However, the     Anasazi clearly shot their creative wad coming up with these elephantine names,     because the music itself remains uniformly and consistently bland, unfeeling,     rote hardcore.  The lyrics, meanwhile, are blunt and literal throughout: ""At     war with bureaucrats/ This land is our land/ Crush their buildings/ Torch     their homes/ Burn their money/ We die for them no longer/ Kill 'em all.""  And     then there's the more economical, ""Sleep/ Eat/ Work/ Drone/ Life bled dry.""     Those are complete songs, by the way.</p>
<p><i>Measurement and Control</i> opens with an eerie pump-organ feedback effect     on ""Xenophobic Dictators Commense [sic] the Hidden Agenda to Eradicate the     Purveyors of the Holy Church.""  The song crescendos before purposefully imploding     under its own awkward, bulky weight.  The music halts abruptly to showcase bumped     pickups, half-strummed chords, and other studio found-noise that sort of forms a     segue into the next track.</p>
<p>The record almost finds its gimpy stride halfway through when the songs begin     to congeal somewhat more effectively. ""Mosquitoing Vector Control"" displays the     pest-like buzzing of its titular namesake.  The band plays tighter on this song     than anywhere else on the album, and to a certain degree, the musicianship     carries through the frequent tempo and stylistic changes of the following two     tracks.  The disc ends with the tightly wound, more traditional-sounding     hardcore burst, ""Fortress.""  However, these apparent improvements are only     relative to the earlier failures.  Measured against their own forebears, as well     as their contemporaries, the Anasazi leave a lot to be desired for the discerning     hardcore fan.</p>
<p>Some of the best moments on <i>Measurements and Control</i> lie in the brief     garnishes that preface half the songs.  Kitschy and playful, they range from     a space-synth nod or two to a snatch of newscast lead-in music.  But these     are neither intended to be taken seriously nor developed beyond the short,     diversionary preamble.</p>
<p><i>Measurement and Control</i> is an aural plague of biblical proportions,     imagery that would no doubt suit the Anasazi just fine, with all the     dermatological festering-- blisters, boils, lesions, running sores-- they     personify through their music.  It's about as enjoyable as a pus-oozing,     gangrenous wound.</p></div>"|177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/177-calculating-components-and-compound-formulas-for-mass-population-reconstruction/|2.6|John Dark

This ought to be cause for celebration no
    matter which of two categories you fall into. I'm referring, of course, to the
    divisive effect of last year's <i>The Vapor of Gasoline</i> and how it split
    people into opposing camps of a) hypester idolaters that overstepped their
    enthusiasm for the album into the sphere of gross exaggeration, and b) the
    backlash contingent that turned their collective nose up at the young, unproven
    band.  If you hail from the former grouping you'll find your feelings well
    justified; if you weren't fully convinced last time around, <i>All the Suits
    Began to Fall Off</i> could, and should, do the trick.</p><p>
    
    Being from the culturally backward, asphyxiatingly humid peninsula that is
    our not-so-great state of Florida, I have a soft spot for anything out of
    America's Wang that doesn't outright blow. Making it out of there unsullied
    by the dense fog of suckitude that hangs over everything is a victory in and of
    itself. The general adversarial ambience is not unlike the dry-ice, death-angel
    mist effect from Charlton Heston's <i>The Ten Commandments</i>, only Florida
    is much too humorless and unimaginative a place to host a pharaoh. Whether by
    divine decree or oversight, the suck managed to pass over this Gainsevillean
    quartet, and though that's a pretty low bar, the Mercury Program takes it as
    a mere starting point, vastly surpassing expectations.</p><p>
    
    People are sort of funny about their music. You've no doubt heard somebody
    lament, with corny solemnity, that the guitar/bass/drums paradigm that has
    served us so well for so long has finally utterly exhausted its potential--
    the implication being that it's high time we abandon it.  Stick around a while
    and you may hear the same person tear down a new group for relying on so-called
    ""gimmicky"" instrumentation. Only here, the unspoken, and perhaps accidental
    implication is that any rock musician that dares step outside the inviolate
    magic circle of guitar/bass/drums must be innovating for innovation's sake,
    and probably to compensate for some lack. Because, if you can't do it with
    the time-tested ingredients, maybe you shouldn't be doing it at all.</p><p>
    
    Right, like I said, people are funny about their music. The Mercury Program is
    just one of those groups that ""rely"" on non-traditional instrumentation. They
    incorporate vibraphone, and on this release, employ a fair number of
    Rhodes-ish keyboard parts as integral elements. Far from gimmicky, the
    vibe lines add a chilly, ethereal stratum to the layers of mutating guitar
    phrases and the tight rhythm section.</p><p>
    
    Since ""vibraphone"" is one of the first
    words you hear in a description of their sound, the effect of its presence is
    worth exploring. Rather than characterizing it as an added layer, it's more
    accurate to say that the vibraphone, by virtue of its timbre, actually
    illuminates the stratified nature of the music. Its coolly reverberant sound
    contrasts as sharply with the alternately raspy and silky guitar parts as it
    does with the foundation of bass and drums, appearing to exist both between
    and outside those sounds. A crisp separation of sound is the result, as well
    an appearance of space and distance in what might otherwise have been
    a much muddier mix. It's the auditory equivalent of taking all the objects in
    a cluttered room and boxing them into individual cubes of limpid glass. Apart
    from its beautiful melodic and harmonic role, the vibraphone performs this
    all-important function, at once complimenting the ensemble, and demarcating
    the other instruments both from itself and from each other.</p><p>
    
    But who are these guys? Well, for starters, they're multi-instrumentalists.
    Tom Reno, erstwhile sometimes-singer on previous releases, limits himself here
    to guitar, bass, and bells. Big brother Sander Travisano likewise holds down
    guitar and bass and makes occasional forays into drumming, while little
    brother Whit Travisano feels it on electric piano and the vibes. Dave Lebleu,
    principal drummer, is responsible for the busy-bee percussion that sounds sort
    of like a jazzier, more vocal take on DC-style drumming. The collective sound
    is very much groove-oriented at the bottom, but given to loopy, spinning guitar
    bits, and Philip Glass-ish melodic abstraction on the vibraphone and keyboard.</p><p>
    
    At half an hour, this five-song teaser packs quite a value. There are no weak
    tracks to be found, and the repeat appearance of producer Andy Baker (Japancakes,
    Macha, the Causey Way) does the band's intricacies justice. The guitar playing
    this time around is less aggressive, with virtually none of the satisfyingly
    dissonant chord bursts from <i>Vapor</i>. That's not to say it's better or worse,
    but simply that they've taken a different direction this time, where more often
    than not, the guitar and vibe parts don't play <i>off</i> each other so much as
    attempt to intertwine and form a sonic fabric. I'd like to see them bring back
    some of that caustic guitar playing, though; it provided a focal point amidst the
    wash of harmonic atmospherics. That, however, is just a matter of taste.  The
    point: <i>All the Suits Began to Fall Off</i> indicates a bright and interesting
    future for the group.  Go Florida.</p></div>"|5232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5232-all-the-suits-began-to-fall-off-ep/|7.9|Camilo Arturo Leslie

Critics,
    because we lack the vocabulary to verbally illustrate what we hear, approximate
    our explanations with obtuse metaphors and imprecise comparisons.  As a
    relative greenhorn in the <i>Pitchfork</i> camp, I don't have much experience
    crafting the sort of riddles reviewers always speak in, so maybe it's time I
    got some practice.  And where better to start than with Plaid's latest musical
    conundrum, <i>Double Figure</i>-- an album whose ostensible theme is mystery,
    and an album for which few words are suited?  So, if you'll permit me a moment
    of intellectual masturbation:</p><p>
    
    Plaid's first LP, <i>Not for Threes</i>, was to M.C. Escher as their second,
    <i>Rest Proof Clockwork</i>, was to Roy Lichtenstein.  On <i>Double Figure</i>,
    intended as the final instalment of this IDM trilogy, Ed Handley and Andy
    Turner match the mind-bending intricacy and academic precision of <i>Threes</i>
    with the vibrant palettes and playful sensibility of <i>Clockwork</i>.  The
    result is an aesthetically diverse gallery of songs that, in its finest moments,
    calls to mind the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky and Rene Magritte-- immediately
    intriguing and immaculately produced, always with a cryptic sense of
    inexplicable urgency.</p><p>
    
    Where continuity is concerned, <i>Double Figure</i> reminds me of a salad made
    from candy bars, or a library where the books are actually ant farms-- neither
    of which I've actually encountered, but in literary circles, we call that
    poetic license.  The disjointed juxtaposition of styles on this disc is so
    pronounced that it feels intentional; like <i>The White Album</i> or Jega's
    <i>Spectrum</i>, this record underscores its versatility at the expense of
    consistency.</p><p>
    
    While all of the tracks-- even the minute-long Tak snippets-- are autonomous,
    ambitiously complex entities, each of the 19 songs bear the duo's unifying,
    idiosyncratic stamp.  And the absence of tangible themes lets listeners filter
    the gems from the garbage (the album doles out a healthy balance of both)
    without losing the plot.</p><p>
    
    When this album fails, it's not for want of trying.  Handley and Turner seem
    to be pushing the envelope beyond their previous efforts, grafting more
    difficult harmonic arrangements onto the densely layered beat construction
    that characterized <i>Not for Threes</i>.  But they often bite off more than
    they can chew.  On ""Light Rain,"" the melodies run amok and lose cohesion, and
    ""Silversum"" falls prey to the detached focus on percussive structure that
    plagued Plaid's debut.</p><p>
<i>Double Figure</i> strikes gold, however, with songs like ""Zala,"" a frenetic
    melange of off-kilter string synths and atmospheric melodies, punctuated by
    brisk snares and cymbals.  ""Eyen"" kicks the album off in the right key,
    building steam from a flamenco guitar sample, wistful strings and a soft, flat
    bassline.  Elements of chaos cautiously creep in on the instrumentation, then
    wash out the melodies entirely.  The light drum breaks and Ennio Morricone
    leanings touch on the sound of ""Pino Pomo"" from the pair's last album, only
    with a less panicked and more tranquil outlook.</p><p>
    
    Plaid attempt the Funki Porcini sound with the onomatopoetically titled ""Ti
    Bom.""  Jazzy breaks with clipped cymbal hits (bom-bom-ti-bom) keep the tempo
    while distorted horns flirt with airy hand drums in the song's upper registers.
    ""Squance"" reveals the duo's dancefloor viability with a disco-tinged
    drum-n-bass foray into the possibilities of stereo.</p><p>
    
    Handley and Turner flaunt their range all over this record, laying on the
    brooding gravity of ""Sincetta"" only moments before igniting the 8-bit electro
    of ""Porn Coconut Co.""  But <i>Double Figure</i> suffers from an excess of
    ambition, and when Plaid aim too high, they miss the mark.  This album
    features some of their best work to date, but also some of their greatest
    failures.  <i>Rest Proof Clockwork</i> may not have tried as hard, but it
    worked brilliantly within its limits.  <i>Double Figure</i> takes Plaid
    through a tract of uncharted territory, and their ship sometimes runs
    aground.</p></div>"|6335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6335-double-figure/|7.6|Malcolm Seymour III

    like I needed, well, a girlfriend.  That is, desperately.  Call it a perfect
    match. She'd spent too many years clubbing to have more than a passing
    knowledge of non-techno music, and I'd spent too many years shucking to have
    more than a passing knowledge of monogamous sex. The results have been fast,
    effective, and largely painless. She's taken to the Pixies, and I've taken
    to, um, lots of sex.</p><p>
    Air's debut, 1998's <i>Moon Safari</i>, is not only a pop classic of
    retro-futurism; it also provides a damn fine soundtrack to the otherworldly
    act of sex.  Needless to say, we became well acquainted with the album, which
    both of us were already fond of to begin with. Their soundtrack to Sofia
    Coppola's directorial debut, 2000's <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>, was a similarly
    fluid pour of analog synths, but the album was a less pop-oriented, more
    minor-key affair. And if you've seen the movie, you can understand why I
    wouldn't want to do ""the beast with two backs"" while listening to its
    irrevocably-linked score.</p><p>
    So would Air's official follow-up to <i>Moon Safari</i> be a return to coital
    form? I'll let my girlfriend do the talking:</p><p>
<i>""Weird.""</i></p><p>
    That would be the opener, ""Electronic Performers.""  She wasn't necessarily
    turned off by the deep bass thumps that rip into electronic handclaps. Or the
    occasional heavy rapping, like the landlord at your door a day after the
    rent's due. And it definitely wasn't the radar beeps or the fluctuating
    machinations of the keyboard. I think it was the vocals. Accompanied by a
    natural piano, a distorted voice sings, ""We are the synchronizers/ Send
    messages through time code."" And it <i>is</i> weird, like something Dean and
    Gene Ween would come up with. But with lines such as, ""We need to use envelope
    filters/ To say how we feel,"" the track is also an oddly beautiful lament.</p><p>
<i>""The Radiohead voice!""</i></p><p>
    Yes, a whispery version of the fitter, happier Macintalk voice makes an
    appearance on the love song, ""How Does It Make You Feel?""  But a real voice--
    resident keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr.-- sings the ELO-inspired
    chorus.  The beat, meanwhile, is cut from the exact same mold as <i>The Virgin
    Suicides</i>-- from the dark, ambling pace all the way down to the angelic
    voices coalescing in the background. But whereas that album-- and ""the
    Radiohead voice,"" for that matter-- remain serious to the end, this song
    concludes with a funny moment. After listing off his feelings, the male
    computerized voice receives an abrupt retort from a female computerized
    voice: ""Well, I really think you should quit smoking.""</p><p>
<i>""It's like rock-n-roll.""</i></p><p>
    ""The Vagabond"" makes you wish for a full-length Beck/Air collaboration. But
    at first, it's all Beck: a harmonica solo, folky acoustic strumming, Beck's
    distinctive, marble-mouthed vocals, and tolls ringing in the background. You'd
    think he donated a b-side from <i>Mutations</i>.  That's when Air's laser-gun
    atmospherics shoot forth.  The drums that kick in midway are also decidedly
    more similar to Air's previous work.  Beck even ends the number with his
    trademark falsetto and a cackling laugh a la ""Hollywood Freaks,"" so yes, she's
    right: this is rock-n-roll. But then again, a moment later she said, ""Honey,
    isn't rock-n-roll a weird name?""</p><p>
<i>""Is this the same album?""</i></p><p>
    By the halfway mark, ""Lucky and Unhappy,"" the poor girl had been thrown for
    more than one loop-- not to mention ""Radian,"" Air's most overwrought
    Bacharach-inspired track to date.  And now here was this untraceable throbbing,
    this eerie computerized whirring, voices of different distortions, and an
    acoustic guitar to ground it all; then a skittering beat and a swirling
    orchestra; and even later, static popping and off-key keyboards.</p><p>
    Songs from the album's second half provided little relief. ""Sex Born Poison""
    pairs a vocoderized voice with the Japanese vocals of Buffalo Daughter; then,
    for good measure, adds what sounds like digital Ping-Pong-- or maybe the
    noises ""Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!"" makes while Little Mac is popping King
    Hippo in the gut and mouth. After opening with a thick electro-pulse and
    digi-congos, the chantey ""People in the City"" reaches a simple acoustic
    epiphany-- think the Beta Band's ""Dry the Rain""-- before descending into
    muddled feedback and heavy electronic gurgling. And the final number,
    ""Caramel Prisoner,"" is an ambient come-down-- kind of like a rollercoaster
    coming to rest with a bloody, broken-nosed Fabio aboard.</p><p>
<i>""I like it, but it's kind of all over the place.""</i></p><p>
    I'm a little scared to admit it, but we're on the same page here. The
    barely cohesive <i>10,000 Hz Legend</i> is both a concern and a relief.
    There's only one truly catchy song-- the <i>Low</i>-era Bowie-esque ""Radio
    #1""-- but it doesn't have quite the same bounce (not to mention single
    potential) as ""Sexy Boy."" So you probably won't hear any of these songs on
    the radio, and I can say with absolute certainty that this won't be
    <i>Details</i>' album of the year, as <i>Moon Safari</i> was. I don't say
    this because it matters, but rather to indicate that Nicolas Godin and
    Jean-Beno\xEEt Dunckel have steadfastly refused to be pigeonholed. For better
    or worse, this is not <i>Moon Safari Redux</i>.</p><p>
    The obvious comparison that my girlfriend should have made is to the Chemical
    Brothers, who took a similar stylistic leap on their last album, 1999's
    <i>Surrender</i>, even though staying the big-beat course would have been the
    easier and more profitable thing to do.  But for some reason Spike Lee's work
    also comes to mind: there are plenty of hits and misses, but the experience
    is worth it for the invigorating knowledge that this critically established
    artist isn't afraid to take his art in new directions.  Plus, my girlfriend
    and I love that Spike always slips a hot sex scene into his films.</p></div>"|80.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/80-10000-hz-legend/|7.6|Ryan Kearney

She's the original indie troubadour, a music fan
    living out a music fan's ultimate dream: travelling the world over to play
    and record with her favorite musicians (all of whom are plenty cool in their
    own right).  She's so cool that she actually made Matador Records
    cooler when she was on their roster, instead of the other way around.</p><p>
    
    So, yes, Barbara Manning is a mighty cool person, and her unassuming, folksy,
    thoughtful jangle-pop has attracted a sizable cult following that may soon
    be calling for my head on a pike, once they see the lukewarm rating I've
    given <i>You Should Know by Now</i>. (Or maybe not, since most of the
    Barbara Manning fans I've met are pretty mellow, but you never know.) But it
    would be truly dishonest of me to say that <i>You Should Know by Now</i> is
    anywhere near the quality of her past work. In fact, it's surprising that
    Manning has maintained such consistent quality over the years, what with her
    constant label-jumping and perennial backing-band changes.  When she has the
    likes of the Verlaines' Graeme Downes or Calexico, as on <i>1212</i> and
    <i>In New Zealand</i>, she can be golden; similarly, the albums she recorded
    for Matador, both solo and with the SF Seals, have the virtue of larger
    budgets and more studio time.</p><p>
    
    However, <i>You Should Know by Now</i> seems to have been created under less
    than ideal circumstances, resulting in a decent if uninspired album.  I'm
    not trying to shift the blame to Manning's current backing band, the Go-Luckys
    (Flavio and Fabrizio Steinbach-- I just wanted to mention them because they
    have great names). In fact, the one track penned exclusively by the brothers
    Steinbach-- the churning, forceful instrumental ""Boston Song""-- is quite good.
    But they were apparently unable to add any distinctive angles to Manning's
    sound, which at this point could use a little updating; more than once on this
    album, the scrubby guitar and jumpy drums were uncomfortably reminiscent of
    early-90's Lemonheads, cuddly but disposable.</p><p>
    
    Manning has a knack for writing songs that sound comfortable and familiar on
    the first listen, but only occasionally on <i>You Should Know by Now</i> is
    she able to use it to her advantage and make a chord progression or vocal
    melody completely her own. Too often she sounds like a less compelling
    version of other insecure girls with guitars-- Mary Timony, Juliana Hatfield,
    Elizabeth Elmore, etc. She can devolve into sing-songy preciousness too easily,
    as on ""Goof on the Roof"" (which even features a musical saw, for crying out
    loud), or choose a style not well-suited to her talents (on the supposedly
    chipper ""You Knock Me Out,"" her plain voice sounds so deadpan that she seems
    less knocked out than merely tapped on the shoulder).</p><p>
    
    Perhaps its Manning's tendency to let her songs slouch about that I can't get
    into, because she sounds so much better when she's commanding. The faster,
    buzzier numbers here-- ""Don't Neglect Yourself,"" with its snarling,
    Donnas-like riff, and the pitched, frantic frustration of ""Buds Won't Bud""--
    are pleasingly compact.  And among the more melancholy, minor-key numbers,
    ""Incapable"" simmers with sad tension.</p><p>
    
    Manning has said that she dislikes being the sole creative force in a band,
    which may offer some justification for her many collaborations.  <i>You Should
    Know By Now</i> is her most self-reliant release to date-- there are no covers
    and few joint songwriting credits-- and, sure enough, it's one of her weakest
    releases. There's enough here to keep the dedicated Manning fan satisfied, but
    newcomers would do well to look elsewhere for a better introduction, such as
    her work with the SF Seals or (if you can find them) earlier solo albums such
    as <i>Lately I Keep Scissors</i> and <i>One Perfect Green Blanket</i>.</p></div>"|5085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5085-you-should-know-by-now/|6.2|Nick Mirov

    stepped on it.  Brian had noticed the toad sitting on the grass just in time
    to witness its gruesome death, and stared for a few seconds before throwing up
    his hands and shouting, ""The universe sucks!""  Brian is fond of decrying the
    injustices of our chaotic environment, and perhaps no other single anecdote
    supports his rantings better.  There was no reason for what happened to that
    toad.  It just happened.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Brian's simple three-word theory is applicable everywhere, and not
    just in the natural world.  It was at work when Beta succumbed to VHS, despite
    being the superior format.  It's at work every time Fox cancels a good TV show
    and replaces it with police chase videos.  And it's at work almost constantly
    in the music industry, a world where the Britneys and the Backstreets rule the
    charts while so many true artists toil in the depths of commercial hell,
    neglected by a public hungry for eye candy and a quick thrill.</p><p>
    
    While many artists have suffered similar fates, few have typified it the way
    Mark Eitzel has.  Put simply, Eitzel possesses one of the most impressive
    oeuvres of any songwriter, living or dead. Even the perpetually clueless
    <i>Rolling Stone</i> couldn't ignore the man's genius, naming him Songwriter
    of the Year back in 1991.  Despite his complete mastery of the craft, though,
    he's never seen his day in the spotlight, and at this point in his career, it
    seems unlikely that he ever will.  The public at large isn't interested in
    music this brutally honest.  All the more for you and me, I suppose.</p><p>
    
    Transplanted in the early 80's from his boyhood home of Columbus, Ohio to the
    San Francisco Bay Area, Eitzel fronted the tragically overlooked American Music
    Club.  Over the course of AMC's seven albums, Eitzel penned some of the
    greatest, most heartfelt tales of degradation, struggle, and sadness in modern
    music, finding his muse in dank bars, empty beds and lonely nights.  When AMC
    finally called it quits in 1994 after a stalled deal with Reprise, Eitzel
    struck out on his own, releasing the jazzy <i>60 Watt Silver Lining</i> and
    the fantastic Peter Buck collaboration <i>West</i> on Warner before the label
    left him on the curb.</p><p>
    
    The good folks at Matador picked him up for 1998's cheekily titled <i>Caught
    in a Trap and I Can't Back Out 'Cause I Love You Too Much Baby</i>, a starkly
    beautiful album that was almost aborted due to the difficulty of making it.
    Three years later, Eitzel is still on his feet, though the weight of the
    world has hardly been lifted from his shoulders.  <i>The Invisible Man</i> is
    perhaps his best solo effort yet, and nearly the equal of AMC's greatest
    triumph, <i>Everclear</i>.</p><p>
    
    Greatness, of course, is a given where Eitzel is involved, but perhaps the
    most stunning thing about <i>The Invisible Man</i> is the fact that, so many
    years on, he's embraced electronics and emerged with an album that sounds
    utterly contemporary and vital.  ""The Boy with the Hammer"" starts things off
    with deeply echoed piano and Eitzel's powerful voice singing, ""When the boy
    with the hammer in the bag stands up to cheer/ Then you stand up to cheer,""
    as ambient washes rise like an ether fog, pushed along by a mix of skittering
    beats and live percussion.  Eitzel has always checked Kraftwerk and Tangerine
    Dream as influences, but they've never come to the fore like this in the
    past.</p><p>
    
    ""Can You See?"" finds Eitzel balancing his world-weariness with a newfound
    trace of optimism: ""You say that another man's hell could be your heaven/ And
    if this is being blind and wrong give me more and more/ And let me light up
    the hand and let me pull the truth through/ But if the truth won't make you
    happy/ What would you do?/ The truth is that I'm happy when I'm with you.""
    The understated electronics burbling underneath combine with knockout horn
    arrangement to wrap around Eitzel's confessions like a warm blanket.
    Goosebumps ensue.</p><p>
    
    The hilarious march of ""Christian Science Reading Room"" is Eitzel's black
    humor at its best.  ""I was so high/ I stood for an hour outside the Christian
    Science Reading Room/ And suddenly I could not resist/ I became a Christian
    Scientist/ And I studied light and I studied sound/ And every question that I
    asked was suddenly profound.""  He goes on to convert his cat before declaring,
    ""I love all seven deadly sins,"" in the opening of ""Sleep.""</p><p>
    
    This is the point, where, as a reviewer, my job becomes difficult.  There are
    thirteen songs on this album and every single one of them is tremendous in its
    own right.  I could spend the rest of this review quoting lyrics and never
    truly convey the power of these songs.  Eitzel has a creepy way of finding all
    the thoughts you have hanging next to the skeletons in your closet and
    conveying them succinctly and effortlessly.  So rather than participate in a
    futile exercise like trying to describe how good this music is, I'll go for
    the big wrap-up and hope that I can convince you that this is totally worth
    listening to.</p><p>
    
    It's way too early to declare anything the Album of the Year, but I will say
    that this one holds the top spot on my list by a long shot so far.  Eitzel
    and his small group of talented cohorts have created a textured soundtrack to
    the outpourings of a broken heart that never once intrudes on the honesty of
    the proceedings.  Every bleep and skitter is there to serve the song.
    Exploring new territory while maintaining the emotional weight of your material
    is rarely a working prospect for an artist, but <i>The Invisible Man</i> pulls
    it off nicely.</p><p>
    
    Eitzel may still be the invisible man in many respects, but as long as he
    keeps translating his sorrow and suffering into batches of killer songs like
    this, we as listeners get to be the lucky beneficiaries.  On the drunkenly
    jubilant closer, ""Proclaim Your Joy,"" Eitzel exhorts us half-seriously that
    ""it is important throughout your life to proclaim your joy.""  And with this
    album in your stereo, I think it's safe to say that you will.</p></div>"|2703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2703-the-invisible-man/|9.1|Joe Tangari

    beginning of civilization, has enhanced (and advanced) human life through
    simplification. Ketchup is a condiment; thus, it can be found in aisle five.
    Simple. But every such concept has a negative side. A particular man is a
    homosexual; thus, he is not allowed to be legally married. Not so simple.</p><p>
    
    As a form of categorization, the critical practice of genre-naming also
    purports to serve a beneficial purpose for the greater good. Were I to call
    <i>Pneumonia</i> ""alt-country,"" for instance, my goal would be to act as a
    filter for the readers pouring through this review. Anyone who despises
    country in any form won't read any further. Anyone who likes or simply
    tolerates country, or whose interest is piqued by ""alt-,"" will continue
    reading until the next, more specific categorical filter.</p><p>
    
    But how does utilitarianism fit into music anyway? In terms of normative
    ethics, I suppose it promotes happiness. Still, I have a hard time viewing an
    album as a tool with a specific utility. Ultimately, genre-naming is
    constricting: it may steer the decision-making process, but that in itself is
    not necessarily a good thing. You can call something ""alt-country,"" but it
    still might sound like an incontinent cow. On the flip side, an album described
    as, say, ""Celtic hip-hop,"" might be ill in a good way.</p><p>
    
    I suppose this is a long-winded way of saying I don't want to label this album
    as ""alt-country,"" or any of the other synonymous labels that critics list ad
    nauseam (no depression, etc.). If you've already told yourself, ""I have enough
    alt-country albums. What I need is even more of that post-rock,"" then you're
    missing out on what could be the best, er, folk- and country-influenced
    pop/rock album of the year. Uh, yeah. The point is that this is good.</p><p>
    
    Well, that's one point. Another point: if you liked <i>Heartbreaker</i>, last
    year's debut solo album from Whiskeytown frontman Ryan Adams, then you won't
    be disappointed by <i>Pneumonia</i>, the band's third and final full-length.
    Reportedly recorded in an abandoned church in upstate New York in 1999-- not
    long before Adams ended the band-- the album was neglected after Outpost
    Records disappeared amidst the Polygram/Universal merger. Like the Red House
    Painters' <i>Old Ramon</i>, released earlier this year, this ""lost"" album was
    not done a disservice by the wait.</p><p>
    
    As I hinted, <i>Pneumonia</i> sounds more like a Ryan Adams solo effort than a
    Whiskeytown album. Of course, Whiskeytown has undergone so many changes since
    their 1996 debut, <i>Faithless Street</i>, that Adams, the lead songwriter and
    vocalist, and fiddler Caitlin Cary are the only original members remaining.
    But the ""Whiskeytown sound,"" if it can be said to exist-- some call it Uncle
    Tupelo meets the Replacements-- is hard to find amidst this cleaner, simpler
    sound. And the sonic consistency that marked their heretofore best effort,
    1997's <i>Stranger's Almanac</i>, is all but extinct.</p><p>
    
    The ride begins with the rambling, harmonica- and piano-driven ""The Ballad of
    Carol Lynn,"" which is The Band seen through the eyeglass of Dylan's influence.
    ""Loving you has gotten weird,"" Adams begins in his distinct wail, accompanied
    by subtle horns and woodwinds. During the chorus, he declares, ""When you need
    a friend to be there for you/ I won't be one who will help you out/ When you
    need someone who can let you/ You can count me out, oh Caroline."" The sound
    may not be as edgy, but Adams remains as unforgiving as ever.</p><p>
    
    After the sufficiently upbeat ""Don't Wanna Know Why,"" which is highlighted by
    Cary's fiddle and complementary voice, <i>Pneumonia</i> settles down for two
    low-key numbers accentuated by Adams' croon and pedal steel. The album then
    begins to rise with ""Don't Be Sad,"" a perfect little reflective rock song held
    aloft by an almost shoegazer-like rolling out of light electric picking. ""Sit
    and Listen to the Rain,"" with its mandolin and organic keyboards, will have
    you thinking R.E.M. circa <i>Out of Time</i>-- that is, until the halting,
    atmospheric chorus.</p><p>
    
    The album becomes even more varied. After the pretty, but lulling ""Under Your
    Breath,"" ""Mirror, Mirror"" shows Adams aiming-- and nailing-- pop that melds
    Beatles-esque romping with R&amp;B; female backup singing and triumphant horns.
    This is followed by ""Paper Moon,"" none other than a Hawaiian love drift with a
    Flamenco chorus. The pace is further slowed by perhaps the album's best moment,
    ""What the Devil Wanted,"" which is little more than vinyl static, a drowning
    piano, and Adams' voice (included are the occasional organ and tolling bell).
    When he repeats during the chorus, ""All my time is wasteful now,"" he has
    certainly hit his most poignant moment.</p><p>
    
    While hardly uniform, the four remaining tracks, plus a forgettable hidden
    track-- all of which are relatively light-- end the album on an unadventurous
    note, genre-wise. But they're not enough to spoil an otherwise wild ride that
    precludes the album from being pigeonholed as ""alt-country,"" in spite of
    Whiskeytown's somewhat generic bandname. For my own personal convenience, I've
    already put <i>Pneumonia</i> in a small new category; it's tentatively called
    ""Considerations for Year-End List.""</p></div>"|8645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8645-pneumonia/|8.1|Ryan Kearney

When     your interviews include answers like, ""My music is embedded in a very concrete,     completely tangible, everyday workflow far less occupied with theoretical     notions of debatable authorship and digital discourse,"" to questions like,     ""Dude, did you, like, work out the songs beforehand or pretty much put this     album together in the studio?"" you can expect people to miss where you're     coming from.</p>
<p>Two misperceptions about Popp are that he makes ambient music and all his     work sounds the same. In the watershed year 1994, the ambient label almost     applied, due in part to Oval's composition process at the time.  That year,     Popp, along with then-collaborators Sebastian Oschatz and Frank Metzger,     decided to take copies of Aphex Twin's <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume     II</i>, apply a magic marker to the CD surface, and record and manipulate     the ensuing tracking errors. This resulted in a beautiful audio object called     <i>Systemische</i>, a record that proved hugely influential in the experimental     electronic community. And yes, it was generally placid enough to be categorized     alongside <i>Music for Airports</i>.</p>
<p>But I defy anyone to listen to <i>Ovalcommers</i>' first track and think of     Brian Eno. It begins with a two-note riff that prudent car alarm manufacturers     should consider licensing, and then slides into a massive pit of raging black     sound, full of bassed-out distortion and explosions of static. The opening     siren continues to wail and actually takes on a pathetic quality as it drowns     inside the din; you begin to feel sorry for that annoying little sound, so     overwhelming is the clamor surrounding it.</p>
<p>Though every Oval record has a unique flavor, <i>Ovalcommers</i> is the most     radical shift yet, one that easily dispels the second misperception. We saw     glimmers of this development in 1999 with <i>Szenariodisk</i>, a gorgeous     EP (my favorite Oval record next to <i>94diskont</i>) that found Oval cutting     exceptionally detailed sound figurines out of slabs of sonic chaos. At that     point, Oval's sources began to acquire a prickly edge, as an increasing amount     of information being stuffed through an ever-narrowing pipe had caused the     protective coating to fray. Still, on <i>Szenariodisk</i>, controlled, icy     beauty was the order of the day. On the full-length follow-up, <i>Ovalprocess</i>,     Popp reigned in the discord and experimented with conventional sounds (the     album is filled with organ chords), creating a warm, enveloping environment     that throughout could still be called ""pretty."" The adjective seldom applies     to <i>Ovalcommers</i>.</p>
<p>On this record, every sound is in constant danger of being shoved into the     red. The most common elements-- sampled guitar plucks, an organ-like synth     patch laced with static, modem transmissions, assorted drones-- appear and     reappear over the course of the record, yet they remain in constant motion.     Any complaints I've had recently about the ""grid"" that rules over time in     computer-generated music do not apply here; the patterns of <i>Ovalprocess</i> would take years for me to understand completely. Loops are used as accent,     not to drive composition.</p>
<p>Most prominent of these is the thing that set Oval apart initially: the now     ubiquitous CD skip. It seems a relief when it first appears on <i>Ovalcommers</i> as Track 1 becomes Track 2 (the idea of Popp naming his pieces now seems silly)     and the initial blast slips down to a manageable level. The CD skip has been     incorporated into every past record except for <i>Dok</i> (a strange release     that now sticks out of the catalog like a sore thumb), and <i>Ovalcommers</i> is no exception. People are tiring of the sound and I can relate. If nothing     else, it's puzzling. Why has it stayed around so long, even outside of Oval?     Why didn't Christian Marclay's memes multiply in the same way? Despite it all,     for me, an Oval record without the trademark skip is like a Built to Spill     album sans guitar.</p>
<p>Most of those who've run with the glitch have used it in a minimal context,     but Oval is moving in the other direction. This is an album packed with     abrasive tones of unimaginable density and uncertain origin. Oval shares     with Autechre the ability to craft sounds that defy explanation. The human     hearing system simply was not built with this record in mind. It's like trying     to graph the emotional intent of a tropical storm. The listener has to fight     a million years of evolution just to pay close attention, and when he does,     there is no system of classification in place to describe it. It's clear that     Oval has left pastures of beauty behind and is ready to ride wild and free in     Merzbow country. Calling this album ambient is a joke; with <i>Ovalcommers</i>,     Popp brings the noise.</p></div>"|6066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6066-ovalcommers/|7.8|Mark Richard-San

    of you.""</p><p>
    Things haven't been the same since that line from <i>Pulp Fiction</i> was
    sequenced into the beginning of the surf number that opens the ubiquitous
    soundtrack. It wasn't the first to prominently feature movie dialogue and
    relatively obscure music, but it was the first of its kind to be hugely
    popular. From then on, it became clear that you didn't need a John Williams
    composition or Whitney Houston's squeal to have success. Now, of course,
    you've got soundtracks featuring songs that aren't even in the movie. For the
    soundtrack is no longer just an accompaniment for the movie-goer-- it's an
    album all its own.</p><p>
    And you know it's moved from a trend to a standard when an indie staple such
    as Superchunk (and Merge Records) frontman Mac McCaughan-- under his
    side-project/alter ego Portastatic-- is slipping interesting dialogue into
    his soundtrack to the Canadian indie film, <i>Looking for Leonard</i>:</p><p>
    ""Excuse me,"" a man says. ""Do you speak English?""</p><p>
    ""Fuck off,"" a woman replies.</p><p>
    ""I just thought I should warn you you're being obvious.""</p><p>
    The woman denies stealing until the man points out the items she lifted. Then
    she questions his motivations, eventually asking:</p><p>
    ""Then what the fuck do you want?""</p><p>
    ""I'm just trying to be helpful.""</p><p>
    ""Are you fucking with me?""</p><p>
    ""No.""</p><p>
    ""Are you serious?""</p><p>
    ""Yes.""</p><p>
    During these last lines, where vicious skepticism shifts to unabashed hope,
    an acoustic guitar, light drum pattering and Margaret White's staccato violin
    fade in to ignite your visual imagination. A belated theremin only brightens
    the colors.  Unless you've seen this unreleased movie, all you can do is
    wonder. Thus, <i>Looking for Leonard</i> shares one thing with blockbuster
    soundtracks, which often come out weeks before the movie: whether it meant to
    or not-- okay, probably not-- it acts as a promotional device.</p><p>
    That's not all it does, though. It swings, skips, mopes, loves, dreams-- in
    other words, it acts like a movie. Hints of last year's <i>De Mel, De Melão</i>,
    an EP of Brazilian covers, emerge sporadically throughout this 34-minute,
    entirely instrumental album. It opens, as most soundtracks do, with the title
    theme, which introduces those beautiful strings, as well as a quavering organ
    and a soaring guitar. It's the perfect mix of McCaughan's two major interests,
    combining the romanticism and wistfulness of tropicalia with the grounded
    guitarwork of Superchunk.</p><p>
    The final number, ""Sweethearts of the World,"" opens with plaintive Brazilian
    horns before breaking into an infectious blend of thumping drums, multiple
    guitars strumming and picking, and, yes, mercurial strings. The incidental
    music that rests between these structured, bookending songs is more
    mood-oriented. Neither good nor bad, just there. Sometimes it's just a
    ringing tone and some slumping drumbeats, or simply the hum of a melodic
    organ, or maybe it's a slow, strummy passage you'd expect from Calexico.</p><p>
<i>Looking for Leonard</i> is, without question, a film score. Most of the
    songs are hardly songs, in the structural sense, and the only batch of
    dialogue hasn't grown old yet. Furthermore, fans of McCaughan's forays outside
    of indie rock will not be disappointed, whether or not they've seen the film.
    Basically, <i>Looking for Leonard</i> is a good soundtrack made the
    old-fashioned way.  You know, before Pumpkin and Honey Bunny stormed our
    speakers with guns and bile.</p></div>"|6417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6417-looking-for-leonard/|7.0|Ryan Kearney

No doubt you were lured by
    those piano lines, those minor key chords waltzing through the streets of
    Bristol.  Come, meet me at the landing; our founder Matt Elliot favored it
    during his days in Flying Saucer Attack.  Have you heard the disembodied vocal
    sample that has appeared and reappeared time and again?  Surely, it's tucked
    deep in your mind like a repressed memory.  You remember it from the <i>Peel
    Sessions</i> record, when it sang on ""Some Pitying Angel,"" and from <i>Little
    Lost Soul</i>, on the track called ""Lost.""  This sweet voice has returned,
    like a will o' the wisp come to lighten the murky swamp, on ""La Dispute,"" a
    remix of a work by French filmscorer Yann Tiersen.  A haunting melody, to be
    sure, with accordion underlying... but those lyrics!  ""So you say the world
    is lonely/ You are alone...""  But our Mr. Elliot was <i>always</i> the
    dramatic one, wasn't he?</p><p>
    My lass, you seem familiar with the reconstruction work done at the Foundation.
    In each room, you'll find a client in search of a certain inner nature which
    yearns to be brought to fruition.  Take, for example, Tarwater here in the
    parlor.  Their original piece, ""To Describe You,"" charmed and delighted with
    reminiscences typical of the Berliners: a distorted echo, metallic in timbre,
    a mellotronic flute melody, and the whispered song title.  Mr. Elliot took
    these ambient whims and condensed them, feeding locomotive drum breaks that
    pick up speed and threaten to careen off the tracks.  Hold the handrail, dear,
    as we descend.</p><p>
    An early diagnosis: you suffer from rhythmic redundancy, a condition brought
    on by exposure to generic brand beats.  Urchin did much the same, until Mr.
    Elliot had a brush with ""Snuffed Candles.""  Trip-hop drums once crippled
    with age have become limber!  Sub-bass hits looped with crisp toms whirl
    madly around, thrusting digital snarls and scratches into the air!  He
    applies more of a sweeping motion to the ""Remote Viewer,"" however, brushing
    together various strands of antique acoustics and digital detritus, and
    watching them eddy about.  One feels distracted, constantly casting eyes
    about as if having imbibed a tincture of laudanum... oh, but rest assured,
    love, the sweet taste of this melancholy equals the bitter.</p><p>
    Some of our guests require more delicate handling than others.  Inevitably,
    extreme methods must be resorted to.  Mr. Elliot was recently visited by
    British comedic prankster Chris Morris, for instance, and the two concocted
    a disturbing brew.  It begins not unlike Spring Heel Jack's twisted take on
    those Tortoise fellows, with ominous bass hearkening back to the Third Eye
    Foundation's jungle period. Soon, imbecilic stammering and demonic squeals
    (minions seemingly sampled from Morris' voice) give rise to a clamor,
    buffeted about by a repeating steel drum sound.  During Blonde Redhead's stay
    here, the opposite pole was reached-- ""Four Damaged Lemons"" strips to nothing
    but sepia-toned piano, drone and Kazu Makino's strangulated cry.  At the
    Foundation, one must delve to emotional depths, even revel in them, before
    rising.  Listen to her defeated warble: ""Don't be a fool, make it easier/
    You learn to say when/ Signal when you can't breathe no more...""
    Delicious.</p><p>
    You may realize I've been referring to Matt Elliot in the past tense.  He has
    not left us, but this collection of collaborations will be his last as the
    Foundation.  He has a boy now, you see, and intends to leave the gloom behind.
    The remix of Faultline's ""MUTE"" reveals the cracks along which his identity
    has split.  Massive, pane-shaking, stone-cracking drum and bass emanates
    throughout, the only overt evidence of his <i>Ghost</i> album. You'll also
    find splinters of his guitar strewn in wild electric torrents, a remnant of
    his early ""Semtex.""  But all things must pass, and rumors abound that his
    next project will abandon both for a more positive, uplifting approach.</p><p>
    So settle back, child, the final number is a special treat.  Acoustic frets
    sharply struck combine with rumbling, haphazard percussion for a hiccuping
    rhythm.  A woman known only as Glanta lays her velvet rasp atop the slow
    groove, as compelling as any swing-period chanteuse.  She sings of a party
    during which her urges get the best of her, specifically the libidinal
    gyrations often justified as the ""dance.""  A moment of déjà vu-- this is a
    Jonathan Richman cover, though Glanta is more convincing, I think: ""I've got
    them all in my trance, when I dance.""  It is hard to deny the hypnotic nature
    of the constant skip-scratch of needle drawn across vinyl.  The fuzzy purr
    of the phonograph production wraps around you like a lover's arms, pulling
    you down into its bed.  Tomorrow, we'll work on what ails you; for now, just
    listen.  You'll sleep well.</p></div>"|8011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8011-i-poo-poo-on-your-juju/|8.4|Christopher Dare

    <i>Crocodiles</i>, Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant are still parading their
    love of Jim Morrison, Arabic scales and quasi-religious imagery.  Though
    far mellower than their debut, their latest offering, <i>Flowers</i>,
    nonetheless links us back to the Northern England post-punk scene so strewn
    with memories and the shed skins of so many legendary bands. Gone are the
    Chameleons, the Teardrop Explodes, and Joy Division.  So what have the
    survivors left to offer us, in a world where Mudvayne and System of a Down
    capture young hearts and minds?</p><p>
    
    The short answer is, of course, another 45 minute expression of the band's
    love of Jim Morrison, Arabic scales, and quasi-religious imagery. At least
    they haven't gone big beat.  Yes, the boys are still doing what they've
    always done best, and despite the slight Gallagher Brothers influence on
    ""Hide and Seek,"" only Echo and the Bunnymen could have written the bulk of
    <i>Flowers</i>.  They make their voices heard loud and clear on the opener,
    ""King of Kings,"" a song which spreads out the three objects of their
    affection with a vibraphone grasping the few remaining Middle Eastern
    tonalities that Will Sergeant's guitar hasn't grabbed for itself.  McCulloch,
    unafraid of confronting the listener from the get-go, opens the album with a
    theological whopper in which Christ confesses his fears of witnessing ""what
    happens when the soul dies.""</p><p>
    
    Though ""Supermellowman"" lives up to its title (especially when McCulloch
    strains to sing, ""Life came without warning""), we have to wait until the
    fourth and fifth tracks, ""Make Me Shine"" and ""It's Alright,"" for the <i>big</i>
    chorus songs. ""Make Me Shine"" is ""Pale Blue Eyes"" meets ""Tambourine Man"" as
    if produced by Todd Rundgren; ""It's Alright"" could have found a place on the
    <i>Nuggets II</i> box set had it been recorded 35 years ago and its
    watery effects pedal had been available in those days. Both are classic
    Bunnymen.</p><p>
    
    Taking ""Sweet Jane"" as its model, ""Buried Alive"" is the <i>Flowers</i>'
    memento mori.  McCulloch sings about childhoods coming to end too soon and
    how ""life is just to die.""  Such morose sentiments sound believable and less
    like youthful sloganeering coming from McCulloch these days.  A theremin
    traces through the grinding guitars and singalong chorus of the track, which
    recalls the band's Gil Norton-produced self-titled album. ""Everybody Knows""
    leans on ""The Cutter"" as McCulloch happily croons about ""going round my last
    bend."" ""Life Goes On"" has an awkward skiffle-y Proclaimers vibe to it that
    the band redeems with the slithering ""An Eternity Turns.""  And then,
    <i>Flowers</i> closes with the mature ballad, ""Burn for Me,"" which reminds us
    that the band are not actually the bolshy scruffs in long raincoats we adored
    two decades ago.</p><p>
    
    Nonetheless, I adore <i>Flowers</i> because of nostalgia.  McCulloch and
    Sergeant have maintained a bridge to the late 20th century, a time when my
    hair didn't recede and I could get away with back-combing.  Of course, because
    <i>Flowers</i> doesn't maintain the urgency of Echo and the Bunnymen's early
    records, it's not the place to begin any investigation into their trippy
    delights. But for us old-timers who remember reading <i>NME</i> before the
    editorial policy changed to shameless oh-so ironic hyping of teen pop acts,
    <i>Flowers</i> stands as a gorgeous bouquet of memories.</p></div>"|2669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2669-flowers/|8.0|Paul Cooper

    Oh, sure, your town had that kid who painted ""Zool"" on every stop sign in
    town and evenings of cow-tipping adventure, but few American towns have as
    fractious a history as this California burg situated just inside the US,
    across the dotted line from Mexicali. The two towns were once one, with
    residents passing freely from one nation to the other to work, socialize and
    shop-- the picture of peaceful neighbors.  But times change.</p><p>
    
    As state and federal bureaucrats began to view Mexican immigration as a
    national problem, the border between Calexico and Mexicali was closed ever
    tighter.  Jobs were lost, relationships were severed, and the way of life once
    enjoyed by locals was irrevocably changed.  Calexico remained small and
    retained a high standard of living, while Mexicali's population exploded
    and sank into poverty.</p><p>
    
    Joey Burns and John Convertino make exactly the kind of music you'd expect a
    duo that took their name from an embattled desert town to make.  It conjures
    images of sand-blasted fence posts, cattle skulls, and wind-blown expanses of
    rock and sand, and draws nearly as much from Mexican musical traditions as it
    does from American indie rock. In addition to other side work, Burns and
    Convertino have laid down the rhythmic backbone for Doug McCombs' Brokeback
    project, collaborated with the Amor Belhom Duo as ABBC, and are veterans of
    desert rock outfits Giant Sand and Friends of Dean Martinez. Their diverse
    past shows in their firm grasp of disparate styles.</p><p>
<i>Even My Sure Things Fall Through</i> is an eight-song EP drawn from various
    European b-sides, but it feels a lot more substantial than your typical
    tide-me-over compilation.  Two of these tracks appeared in different
    incarnations on last year's excellent <i>Hot Rail</i> album-- ""Sonic Wind""
    and ""Untitled III.""  ""Sonic Wind"" is presented here as an instrumental,
    refurbished with Jacob Valenzuela's clarion trumpet lines.  Two Lone Swordsmen
    have their way with the interlude ""Untitled III,"" removing the accordion from
    the mix and filtering the acoustic bass for a vacuum-packed effect.  And the
    slow hip-hop beat, erratic maraca, and digital squelches that enter later
    never remove the track from its dusty setting.</p><p>
    
    Joey Burns, whose warm singing voice just keeps improving with experience,
    directly addresses the plight of the band's namesake town on ""Crystal
    Frontier,"" which shows up here in two versions.  The ""Widescreen Version""
    features full mariachi accompaniment and is easily one of the best songs
    Calexico have recorded.  Its video-- one of three included on the CD--
    features footage of poverty-stricken Mexicali and signs announcing the last
    U-turn before Mexico to complement the song's story of failed immigration
    attempts and deportations.  The acoustic version that appears later is Burns
    by himself, giving a haunting rendition that's as essential as the original.</p><p>
    
    Calexico's burned-out take on Mark Eitzel's ""Chanel No. 5,"" feels appropriately
    exhausted to handle Eitzel's aching tale of longing.  When Tim Gallagher's
    steel guitar intones, it's enough to make the hardiest cowhand cry just a
    little in his beer.  ""Banderilla"" kicks off with a mariachi outfit sucked
    into a black hole before sliding into a subdued groove.  Burns' confident
    bassline propels it nicely, but it's one of the few moments that feels too
    familiar. Calexico have been here before, on the almost identical ""El
    Picador,"" from <i>Hot Rail</i>.  ""Crooked Road and the Briar"" salvages things
    quickly, though, with gritty, meaty desert rock.</p><p>
    
    The record winds to a close with the seven-minute ""Hard Hat,"" a softly
    swelling soundscape littered with dying AM radio transmissions.  An extension
    of Calexico's ambient experiments with ABBC, ""Hard Hat"" crawls in from
    oblivion, the aural equivalent of a wasted ghost town.  The swelling drones
    and shifting textures recall the best moments of Angus MacLaurin's <i>Glass
    Music</i> or a young Pink Floyd's quieter ambient experiments.</p><p>
    
    Burns and Convertino have rapidly crafted what began as a side project into
    one of the best bands on the American indie rock landscape.  <i>Even My Sure
    Things Fall Through</i> displays a band with an amazing range of capabilities
    and a veritable stylistic grab bag to draw from.  At 37 minutes, it's a hefty
    listen for an EP, and with the added value of three great videos in the
    enhanced portion, it's hard to say no.  Anyone interested in the Southwestern
    sound would do well to check this out.</p></div>"|1231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1231-even-my-sure-things-fall-through-ep/|8.6|Joe Tangari

That is just crazy. A Ladybug Transistor? A Ladybug Transistor?
    What kind of Ladybug needs a transistor? Some kind of weird robot bug,
    programmed to fly away home? Who would build such a thing?  Or is the ladybug
    itself a transistor?  What fanciful machine would have a Ladybug for a
    transistor?  How would that work?  The entire concept is making me insane.</p><p>
    Still, I must pull it together, unblow my mind, and assess the music of
    <i>Argyle Heir</i>. What kind of crazy stockinged beneficiary is that!? These
    guys are crazy! Stop. Stop. Must focus.  Okay, let's try this again:</p><p>
    Do you love flutes?  If so, you might love the fourth full-length studio album
    from this acclaimed Brooklyn combo.  The crooning baritone, the angel-voiced
    backup vocals, and the gentle minstrel accompaniment might be exactly your
    thing.  If you merely <i>like</i> flutes, you might still find this charming.
    After all, the Ladybug Transistor are very well received, critically. Check
    out <i>Pitchfork</i>'s 8.0 for their previous release, <i>The Albemarle Sound</i>.
    They even had a poster featured in the movie <i>High Fidelity</i>!  So who am
    I to object to their soft balladry?</p><p>
    I like Belle and Sebastian and LT labelmates Magnetic Fields (singer Gary
    Olson would be a likely guest on some Stephen Merritt project).  But maybe,
    if I'd found some other gentle, mellow, competently written records first, I
    wouldn't have warmed to those acts so much.  Still, I think both Belle and
    Sebastian and the Magnetic Fields capture a melancholy that tempers their
    sweetness, at a quality above this.  Maybe I can only take so much bathtub
    music.  I have three Belle and Sebastian records and sixty-nine Magnetic
    Fields songs. Sixty-nine of them!  I'm full up!</p><p>
    Mellowness aside, how are the songs?  The opener, ""Fire On the Ocean,"" stops
    and starts effectively, and features some useful tempo changes.  As does ""The
    Glass Pane,"" along with some nice country picking. ""Echoes"" has a peaceful,
    Grateful Dead-type lilt to it. Really, though, there's a lot of sameness on
    <i>Argyle Heir</i>, and not nearly enough differentiation. The lyrics, while
    not cute or over-psychedelic, are fairly abstract and don't tell much of a
    story.  And, for all the melodic importance to the record, I don't catch
    myself humming any of the tunes when I'm lying around in my sunroom. I hear
    all the instruments moving around up and down the scale, but these tunes don't
    seem to have the hands to grab with.</p><p>
    Olson's voice is nice, if uninvested emotionally, and he's missed when
    instrumental such as ""Going Up North (Icicles)"" and ""Fjords of Winter"" take
    us inside the elevator. It's not that they can't help their gentle ways; the
    Ladybug Transistor (man, that name continues to just absolutely blow my mind!)
    betray that they can step up the energy almost as high as Crosby, Stills and
    Nash with one teaser that fades in and out (a là Beatles by way of Pavement)
    featuring backtracked guitars.  Maybe if you play <i>Argyle Heir</i> backward
    it will rock.</p><p>
    To the band's credit, this is a fully realized album. I just don't want to
    come to the same realization. Four composers all sound like the same creator.
    Songs are nicely brief, achieving all their modest ambitions, and end without
    fuss. The strings and bouncy keyboards, and of course, the flute, overlap
    well. And while I could do without this much flutery, I'm never aggravated by
    any Bacharachian gestures. With this kind of music, it's easy to slip into
    cute moves, and with the exception of the Merry Olde English waltz time
    silliness of ""Catherine Elizabeth,"" the Ladybug Transistor avoid this.</p><p>
    In fact, despite the thoughtfulness of the arrangements, it quickly becomes
    clear that nothing truly surprising will ever happen.  This act could learn
    from another labelmate, Neutral Milk Hotel, about the possibility for
    arrangement to enhance and transport instead of merely tastefully support a
    song. Of course, it's easy to stumble when pursuing such adventures, but
    that's what we expect our artists to risk. They cannot just make pleasant
    music that does not actually excite.</p><p>
    Plus, Ladybug Transistor!!!  I still can't get over it.</p></div>"|4627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4627-argyle-heir/|6.8|Dan Kilian

Isn't it obvious?  Okay, so those
    arrows scrawled on the record cover's juvenile map of the U.S. could be
    converging on any number of major metropolitan areas, historical landmarks,
    Denny's restaurants, etc.  Just listen to the music, though, and you'll agree
    that this isn't about DC, NYC, Gettysburg, Amish country, or any of that
    crap.  This is pure New Jersey.</p><p>
    
    Ignore for a moment the fact that the Rapture are from New York.  What's New
    Jersey, anyway, if not the cracked and smeared reflection of the Empire State--
    the Evil Twin NYC keeps chained in the basement?  Whenever New York walks into
    the room, New Jersey crawls out from behind the radiator, croaking its
    truncated, mocking call of ""Newark!,"" and it scares the shit out of those
    Soho snobs every time.</p><p>
    
    The mixture of hatred and odd admiration in my description has probably
    already tuned you into the fact that I'm from Jersey.  Maybe that's why I
    like it when the Rapture come on like Manhattan proto-punk scenesters
    Television buried up to their necks in a toxic waste dump.  The title track
    of ""Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks"" finds guitarist Luke Jenner slowly
    easing his tangled guitar riffs into Matty Safer's thick bassline stew until
    Vito Roccoforte's disco-shambling drums bring the song to a boil.</p><p>
    
    These guys are both extremely tight and menacingly unhinged at the same time,
    thanks in no small part to the vocals.  Handled here and throughout the album
    by Jenner and Safer, the high, nasal reports of ""Punishment in Higher Places""
    sound like Tom Verlaine's cries for help as he struggles to keep his head
    above the muck.</p><p>
    
    The Rapture manage to carve out an interesting niche for themselves in the
    aggro-punk/noise-rock fringe by capitalizing on their uncanny ability to
    groove in what would seem like the most inhospitable and abrasive environments.
    Safer and Roccoforte are a fantastic rhythm combo, swerving through the
    convoluted song structures in perfect sync and usually keeping Jenner's
    flightier guitar tethered.  As Jenner slashes and swipes wildly against the
    rhythm in ""Modern Romance,"" for instance, Safer and Roccoforte hold their
    ground, grinding out an insistent, fluid, cymbal-heavy pulse.  Below the
    trebly feedback fever-dream of ""The Jam,"" the beat warps and stretches into
    impossibly strange configurations without ever losing its way.  Between the
    skin-thumping swagger at the song's close, you can barely make out the ringing
    of church bells, an effect so eerily submerged that it's hard to tell whether
    it belongs to the realm of happy recording accidents or found-sound genius.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the vocals tend to slip through the band's tightly-laced
    fingers every once in a while.  The sparse ""Caravan"" breaks down into
    stretches of near-nothingness, leaving only the thin, whiny vocals to crack
    their way unsteadily through the melody.  ""The Pop Song"" delivers on its
    weirdly upbeat instrumental sections, only to fall flat with a strained
    fantasy-metal sort of yelping that would be better off toasting the Bravery
    of the Elf King than attempting these unintelligible lyrics.</p><p>
    
    The rhythm takes over again (thank God) for the last track, ""Confrontation,""
    and neither the spiraling, metallic guitar nor the admittedly more palatable
    vocal exhortations can do anything to stop it.  Roccoforte churns out an
    endless stream of cymbals and snares while Safer counterbalances with a
    rock-steady motorik throb.  Soon, the song crashes to a near-halt before
    Roccoforte takes over again, leading off into the distance with a strangely
    serene rhythmic outro.</p><p>
    
    Jersey, of course, isn't all ugly.  It's almost like New York sometimes.
    Likewise, New Jersey is what New York is always on the verge of becoming.
    Hundreds of thousands of Jerseyites stream in to the city every day, becoming
    part of the place for eight hours before shuttling back across the borderline.
    With a sound in constant, uneasy flux, the Rapture speaks (not always
    eloquently, but effectively) for the commuter-- the ordinary-looking joe
    capable of blending into the Broadway crowds but forever holding a dirty
    secret in his irradiated little heart.</p></div>"|6692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6692-out-of-the-races-and-onto-the-tracks-ep/|7.3|Brendan Reid

We're at least a generation
    past a major war, and (hopefully) a few more generations away from global
    apocalypse. Tasty mass-produced food products are cheap and plentiful.
    Computers almost work, sometimes. And electronic musicians are beginning to
    look to other forms of music for sources of sound and inspiration, resulting
    in some pretty goddamned excellent stuff.</p><p>
    
    Electronic music has always had many pitfalls-- a reliance on trite drum
    machine programming, a propensity for being gratuitously grating and
    ""difficult,"" and the occasional lapse into weak retro fetishism. But when
    dealing almost entirely with generated sounds, one is afforded a certain
    freedom to manipulate sound as a whole entity. Rather than, ""Hey, let's move
    that chorus back to before the second verse and put a phaser on the guitar,""
    an electronic musician could say, ""Hey, let's chop that chorus up into little
    pieces, run it through a phaser, reassemble it in a random pattern, and then
    turn that pattern into a pitched sample.""</p><p>
    
    Increasingly, it seems that this kind of freedom to experiment is being
    utilized by electronic artists daring to venture outside the realm of what
    is traditionally seen as electronic territory. Max Tundra's amazing <i>Some
    Best Friend You Turned Out to Be</i> utilized more rock-oriented instruments
    and songwriting mechanisms, coupled with a freedom to experiment with sound
    as a whole that's characteristic of the more evolved members of the sequencer
    set. Mouse on Mars's brilliant <i>Idiology</i> incorporated elements of prog
    and classical music into the band's warm electronic soundscapes, resulting in
    the most gorgeous arrangements of 1's and 0's I've heard this year.</p><p>
    
    ""My Red Hot Car"" is, at its very core, a traditional pop song. It's got a
    memorable hook, accompanied by memorable lyrics: ""I'm gonna fuck you with my
    red hot car."" It's got a fairly straightforward chord structure, with smooth
    synthesizers and drum machines providing backing for the aforementioned
    computer-intoned melody. But Squarepusher's Tom Jenkinson is not the kind of
    guy to let a piece of music stagnate, no matter how good it is. What makes
    ""My Red Hot Car"" such a great single is the fact that Jenkinson manages to
    masterfully balance skittering electronic noodling with straight-up pop.</p><p>
    
    This EP contains two versions of ""My Red Hot Car,"" the frenetic, fractured
    album version, and a smoother version, in which the pop hooks of the song
    remain largely unaltered. Both versions of the song are quite good, but the
    album cut, which actually appears second on this EP, is thoroughly
    attention-grabbing. In this more highly manipulated version, Jenkinson uses
    the song itself as a percussive instrument, dicing it into rhythmic pieces
    as the song progresses with its own complex rhythms. What's perhaps more
    impressive is that Jenkinson accomplishes this without making the track any
    less listenable than its more dancefloor-friendly counterpart.</p><p>
    
    The remaining two tracks on <i>My Red Hot Car</i> provide a nice counterpoint
    to the hyperactive pop of the title tracks. ""Hardcore Obelisk"" is an exercise
    in pure subtlety-- no pounding rhythm, no computerized vocals, just a series
    of synthesized notes morphing subtly in and out of various tonalities. Granted,
    it's not the most thrilling listen, but it's remarkably well-executed, and
    provides a pleasant slowdown after the non-stop thrills of ""My Red Hot Car.""
    The final track, ""I Wish You Obelisk,"" bears a closer resemblance to
    straight-up drill-n-bass than anything else here-- it's a fine track, but
    seems dull in comparison to the sonic extremes of the other tracks.  As
    a bonus, Jenkinson tosses in a moody ambient track to round things out--
    perhaps a quieter variation on ""Hardcore Obelisk""-- though you have to
    fast-forward past 20 minutes of silence for it.  Frankly, I can't be arsed
    to put in that kind of effort for every listen.</p><p>
    
    I don't usually get excited about singles, but I'll be damned if ""My Red Hot
    Car"" hasn't staked out permanent real estate in my musical memory-- perhaps
    the first time a pop song so complex and spazzy has done so. Ah, well.  If my
    brain gives out, I can always have my body frozen, to be gazed upon by the
    awestruck masses of the future. A fine time to be alive, indeed.</p></div>"|7445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7445-my-red-hot-car-ep/|8.0|Matt LeMay

    over a decade with the same six members.  Most bands don't even make it the
    full ten years, much less with all members intact.  I've been trying to think
    of other bands who have done it and after a few minutes of staring around at
    my record collection, Fugazi, Radiohead, and REM are the only names I've come
    up with, and even REM doesn't have Bill Berry anymore.</p><p>
    
    Aside from those, you have revolving doors like Yes and Fleetwood Mac, both
    of whom have had over twenty members over the years, and short-lived outfits
    like the Sex Pistols, who couldn't stay together long enough to complete
    their first US tour.  So, it's a testament to the strength of the band that
    Tindersticks are still at it after all these years, democratically crafting
    some of the best music in Britain.  And it's equally impressive that their
    quality has hardly suffered at all in the process.</p><p>
    
    The music of Tindersticks has changed a lot in the last few years, absorbing
    70's soul into their signature gutter ballads, and dropping the ""melo"" prefix
    from the drama.  Gone are the 70 minute-plus double-albums and ear-rattling
    dissonance that characterized their early music, replaced instead by concise,
    slow-core R&amp;B; with an inky black center.  Still, it would impossible to
    mistake this for any other band, and old fans will likely be delighted with
    what they hear.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Dying Slowly,"" is the most direct musical link to the band's
    past, recalling the string-drenched pining of their third album, <i>Curtains</i>.
    Stuart Staples' murky baritone calls out the refrain, ""This dying slowly/
    It seemed better than shooting myself,"" with characteristic exhaustion.  The
    strings swell and subside like the conversation in a crowded bar.  It's an
    elegant introduction to an album that finds Tindersticks further embracing
    the soul influences they first toyed with on 1999's <i>Simple Pleasure</i>.</p><p>
    
    A case in point is the title track, a bubbling stew of wah-wah guitars,
    Hammond organ and passionate vocals that plays like Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get
    It On"" at half-speed, only with <i>Here, My Dear</i> sentiments in the lyrics.
    Even after all this time, Stuart Staples can't seem to win at the game of
    love.</p><p>
    
    ""Sweet Release,"" the album's eight-minute centerpiece, follows, displaying
    the band's uncanny ability to play an extremely long song and make it feel
    too short.  Dickon Hinchliffe's violin swirls around Staples' molasses-thick
    vocal and David Boulter's gorgeous organ lines, as the twelve-member string
    section comments from the wings.  It makes for a song that easily lives up
    to its title.</p><p>
    
    Part of what makes Tindersticks so easy to connect to is the way they manage
    to make even the most minute suffering and pain seem universal.  When Staples
    sighs, he's sighing with you, and when he says ""I,"" it could be anybody who's
    ever been through a messy breakup or felt the sting of rejection.  And that's
    why his plea of ""Don't ever get tired of waiting for me"" on ""Don't Ever Get
    Tired"" hits a nerve-- everyone needs someone they can depend on, and Staples
    just wants it to be the woman he loves.</p><p>
    
    ""People Keep Comin' Around,"" a duet between Staples and Hinchliffe, offers
    perhaps a little insight into why Tindersticks have been able to last so
    long-- all six members are genuinely unselfish musicians.  Bassist Mark
    Colwill and drummer Alasdair Macaulay lay down a relaxed but funky groove as
    Boulter and guitarist Neil Fraser lay back, playing only when necessary.
    Hinchliffe's higher octave is animated, but never hogs the spotlight, letting
    the band ride the groove, while Hinchliffe's rich string and horn arrangements
    fill in the gaps.  It's telling that the band offers equal billing to the
    string and horn players in the album credits, acknowledging their
    contributions as equal to the end result.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the only faltering point on the entire album actually comes when
    Staples strikes out on his own for the puzzling ""Tricklin',"" a two-minute
    vocal round with minimalist organ accompaniment that doesn't really serve as
    much more than filler.  But when the whole band is engaged, the results are
    frequently stunning, and always engaging.</p><p>
    
    The final twist on <i>Can Our Love...</i> comes with the closer, ""Chilitetime,""
    where, for once, hope seems to be the order of the day.  ""She has my love/
    She needs something more/ But time is mine,"" Staples sings as Hinchliffe's
    violin cries out behind him.  And that's where the ellipsis in the album
    title comes in, I think.  It leaves the thought ""Can our love..."" incomplete
    and allows you draw your own conclusions.  While things are definitely bad,
    there may yet be a way out.</p><p>
    
    Despite the open-ended nature of its sentiments, ""Chilitetime"" pulls the
    album to a strong close, effectively capping this latest journey through the
    dark folds of the brain and the heart.  At 45 minutes, <i>Can Our Love...</i>
    is Tindersticks' most concise album yet, and it sacrifices nothing in content.
    Eight songs may not seem like much for a full album, but it's all this band
    needs to make a fully rewarding listen that only gets richer the more you
    visit.</p></div>"|8074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8074-can-our-love/|8.1|Joe Tangari

I'm not going to mention any
    spoilers, but it told a good tale.  The transition from period-piece to
    straight-up action flick was disappointing, though, because I liked the
    occasional attempts to address the historical context.  Soon after one
    character talks about the relentless American drive for westward expansion
    in the 19th century, a stereotypical chase scene occurs, as a merry banjo
    instrumental plays in the background.  I couldn't figure out what they
    were trying to achieve-- each time the track popped up, it ruined an
    otherwise visceral clarity.</p><p>
    Cannibal Ox don't have that problem with their debut LP on Def Jux Records,
    <i>The Cold Vein</i>.  ""Iron Galaxy,"" which originally appeared in 2000 on a
    split EP with Company Flow, begins the album.  Vast Aire and Vordul rap an
    abstract refrain, ""My shell, mechanical found ghost/ But my ghetto is animal
    found toast,"" a taste of the tortured environment they document in their
    hometown New York City.  Vordul grabs the mic and busts for 2\xBD minutes,
    beginning with the end of life and ending with a near-hopeless call for
    peace.  Vast Aire then takes a microscope to the street, descending into
    prose so dense and depraved that the stomach lurches.  I don't want to ruin
    the surprises lurking around every corner in this verse, but imagine the
    sonic background, served up by Company Flow CEO El-P, who's taken the duo
    underneath his wing and produced the album: looped beats remain discrete
    while UNKLE-like synth chords bubble upwards, colliding with an old-school
    video game sample that accelerates until the last few seconds of the song
    sound like a Richie Hawtin rave-up.</p><p>
    ""Ox Out the Cage"" brings a more trad rap feel, complete with the ""I'd like
    to introduce... "" narrative.  But both MC's strive to pronounce flows in
    incredible salvos, rarely using chorus lines.  Prose is the game here, and
    Vordul deals in rapid-fire verses that skip every other break to rhyme with
    the next-- Wu-inspired, but who isn't?  Vast prefers a slightly slower
    pace, all the better to fight the war in his brain between concrete detail
    and mastermind abstraction.  He delivers verses with a rising inflection
    that recalls RBX's self-impressed swagger, but this doesn't distract from
    lines like, ""I grab the mic like <i>Are You Experienced</i>/ But I don't play
    the guitar, I play my cadence.""  Power chords accent the mix, but this ain't
    some crossover cock-rock revival.  The rhythm here is aggressive; it turns
    caddy-slacking P-funk samples into hors d'oeuvres, shoves aside all those
    Jeep-ish Timbaland hi-hats and snare drums and devours the RZA's sinister
    string lines.  <i>The Cold Vein</i> is like a musical negative, an inverse
    reflection of hip-hop history, full of everything DJ's cast aside, from Sega
    sound effects to electro-industrialism, gear-work grooves malfunctioning,
    synthesizers belching, a menagerie of digitalia.</p><p>
    The group has more facets than their brutality, though.  Don't flinch when
    ""Battle for Asgard"" betrays its epic title by breaking up each verse with an
    interlude that sounds like circus music.  There's room for humorous
    self-criticism in this relentless debut, but it works best in ""Raspberry
    Fields,"" where Vast Aire cuts his flow short with, ""Oh shit, I said a word
    twice,"" and starts again from the beginning.  Eventually, all but the most
    hardcore heads will appreciate a break from the intensity.  Two of the best
    tracks on <i>The Cold Vein</i> ease up just enough to show some humanity
    beneath the tough skin.  In ""A B-Boys Alpha,"" Vast Aire narrates a personal
    account of his life, from Freudian birthing trauma to the streets where ""my
    first fight was me versus five boroughs.""  A booming choir of distortion
    wells in the background, strangely conjuring up reminiscence.  ""The F-Word""
    cools it down just enough to tell the story of a b-boy reluctant to fall in
    love; El-P keeps it real gritty with an urban melody that recalls Method
    Man's ""All I Need.""</p><p>
    Ultimately, Cannibal Ox inherit the mantle of the Wu-Tang Clan: you can
    polish your rhetorical teeth endlessly, but when your appetite is for
    violence you stay mired in the muck you rose from.  At times you can't tell
    whether they want to break conventions or heads, or whether it's an
    either/or proposition.  But witness the transition from disgust to critique
    here:  ""With beats that have to be registered as sex offenders before
    presented to the public/ I'll exfoliate your face with the acid inside my
    stomach/ Binge and purge/ We live in thirty-second blurbs/ And if consumers
    stop existing we forget how to use words/ Just fuckin' eat each other 'til
    the next ice age occurs. ""  Here's to Cannibal Ox transcending the Wu's
    paranoid conspiracy theories and truly dropping critical science.  But
    enough of the bullshit, <i>The Cold Vein</i> is going to be on everybody's
    year-end list of the best underground hip-hop.  Consume it, just watch it
    doesn't consume you.</p></div>"|1284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1284-the-cold-vein/|8.3|Christopher Dare

Cowboy Junkies' star was at its
    highest arc sometime around the time of <i>Natural Born Killers</i>, when
    they mixed easily on a major label soundtrack to a major motion picture.
    They weren't hugely popular by any stretch, but they sold well enough to
    stay on RCA and then move to Geffen. Perhaps sales took a downturn, because
    Geffen dropped the band in 1999 as part of their post-merger housecleaning.
    Instead of crying about it (why do bands act like they're the only people
    ever fired?) they began releasing records on their own Latent label in 1999.
    Most bands would pack it in after a year or so of trying to do things on
    their own, but Cowboy Junkies continue to release beautifully packaged and
    artistically vital records under the mainstream radar.</p><p>
    
    Something should be said about how prescient <i>The Trinity Sessions</i>
    album was. Here's an album from 1988 that tapped into the amber atmosphere
    of classic country and realized its connection to streetwise rock writing,
    in addition to foreshadowing the move toward glacial tempos. No wonder I
    couldn't stop playing that damn thing in my dorm room every time I slept
    through class.  And in the thirteen years since, Cowboy Junkies have refined
    and diversified their sound, while remaining true to its rootsy core.</p><p>
<i>Open</i> shows as many sides to the band as I've heard on a single release.
    The sound throughout is simple and traditional, mostly guitars with organ and
    piano accents. There's a bit more edge to the guitars than before, but Michael
    Timmins wisely draws heavily from blues and soundtracks when deciding to
    process his electric. The wavering riff that echoes through the opener, ""I
    Did It All for You,"" is the perfect accompaniment, adding cinematic tension
    to the slowly unfolding tale of murder and betrayal. This is the sound thick
    with atmosphere that made the band famous, with the dimmer control twisted
    down a half-turn. The nearly eight-minute ""Dragging Hooks"" follows (the
    perfect song for nighttime driving), upping the tempo while adding swirls of
    slide guitar and feedback.</p><p>
    
    But while there are a number of relatively snarling rockers, ballads will
    always be where Cowboy Junkies shine brightest. The prettiest of the bunch
    is ""Thousand Year Prayer,"" with gently brushed cymbals, simple guitar chords
    and restrained piano. The lyric is odd, at one point seeming to posit Jimi
    Hendrix as a possible martyr for the environmental movement, but with Margo
    Timmins in soft n' wet mode, I find it easy to cruise along on the pristine
    surface of the song. ""Beneath the Gate"" also finds Margo harmonizing with
    herself to great effect on a folky mid-tempo number that recalls John Prine.</p><p>
    
    Some of the energetic tracks do little for me, particularly when the ""sincere
    roots rock"" angle reminds me of Melissa Etheridge, but overall <i>Open</i> is
    very solid. Long time fans will undoubtedly be delighted, but it's tough to
    predict if this record will inspire converts. I'm not sure exactly where
    Cowboy Junkies fit in these days, but if you've dismissed them in the past,
    I'd say they deserve another listen.</p></div>"|1640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1640-open/|7.4|Mark Richard-San

    Publishing), a lexicon of 19th Century street slang, defines the idiom ""pitch
    the fork"" as ""to tell a pitiful tale.""  The term appeared printed in 1863 in
    <i>Story of a Lancashire Thief</i>:</p><p>
<i>""Brummagem Joe, a cove [""fellow"" or ""dude,"" if you will] as could patter or
    pitch the fork with anyone.""</i></p><p>
    At last, the secret motivation of my schtick and the etymology behind our
    name can be revealed.  These reviews have been less critique than loquacious
    concept reviews by an entertaining tramp.  So you'd think an 80-minute opus by
    Tool would be right up our alley.  You'd be wrong. </p><p>
<i>Undertow</i>, Tool's 1993 debut LP, took studio skill and over-trained
    chops to metal with aplomb.  It was Rush Sabbath.  As emotional, melodic
    metal goes (the cultural impact of which will be left to the reader), it
    opened doors for bands like the Deftones, and to some degree, Limp Bizkit.
    However, Tool have always possessed a latent understanding of absurdity and
    comedy; their videos look like Tim Burton stop-motion, goth Primus.</p><p>
    But with popularity and praise, Tool's shadowy tongue-in-cheek turned into the
    simple biting of tongues.  <i>\xC6nema</i> spiced their sound with electronics
    and industry, as was the trend at the time.  Now, with the early new century
    demanding ""opuses,"" Tool follows suit.  The problem is, Tool defines ""opus""
    as taking their ""defining element"" (wanking sludge) and stretching it out to
    the maximum digital capacity of a compact disc.</p><p>
<i>Dictionary of the Underworld</i> also offers several definitions for
    ""tool,"" including: ""a small boy used to creep through windows,"" ""to steal from
    women's pockets,"" and ""to loaf, to idle, to do nothing in particular.""  All of
    which oddly strike the nail on the head in relation to <i>Lateralus</i>.</p><p>
    And now, the obligatory pitching of the fork.</p><p>
    * * *</p><p>
    My Summer Vacation, by Crispin Fubert, Ms. Higgins' Eng. Comp. 901</p><p>
    I believe that music comes and goes in cycles, and some of us are lucky enough
    to ride the crests.  The men in my family are perfect examples of this.
    Initially, I thought that perfect music appeared every 16 years, which is
    also the number of years between Fubert generations.  My dad was born in 1971.
    In that year, landmark albums were released.  They were <i>Nursery Crime</i>
    by Genesis (the first with Phil Collins), <i>Yes Album</i> by Yes, <i>Aqualung</i>
    by Jethro Tull, and <i>In the Land of Grey and Pink</i> by Caravan.</p><p>
    My grandfather skipped out on Vietnam-- because Jimi Hendrix himself told him
    to-- and he moved to Canterbury, which is in the United England.  There, he
    got married to my grandmother, who used to sell baked goods to people at
    concerts, and they had my dad.  After the war, they moved back with a box of
    awesome records like the ones I mentioned.  I think it was cosmic or fate or
    something that my dad was born the same exact day Chrysalis released
    <i>Aqualung</i>, in March of 1971.</p><p>
    Jump ahead 16 years later and my dad got this girl pregnant, who turned out to
    be my mom.  It was 1987 and a whole bunch of lame dance music was ruling the
    world, like Hitler or Jesus or something.  But all of the sudden, albums like
    Metallica's <i>...And Justice for All</i>, Celtic Frost's <i>Into the
    Pandemonium</i>, Queensryche's <i>Operation: Mindcrime</i>, and Slayer's
    <i>South of Heaven</i> came out.  That's when I was born.</p><p>
    All those records were sitting around the house we all live in, and I grew up
    listening to them in the basement.  So I couldn't wait until I was 16, because
    fate says that would be when 1) more kickass records would come out, and 2)
    I'd get sex.  Both were due, because girls are dumb and listen to stuff like
    N'S(t)ync and BBSuk.  But after this summer of 2001, I've had to rethink my
    entire cycle theory, like maybe the cycles of music are speeding as time goes
    forward, since two amazing things happened: Tool put out <i>Lateralus</i> and
    I saw Tool in concert.</p><p>
    I feel like this record was made just for me by super-smart aliens or something,
    because it's just like a cross of 1971 and 1987.  Imagine, like, Peter Gabriel
    with batwings or a flower on his head singing while Lars Ulrich and Rick Wakeman
    just hammer it down.  It's the best Tool record because it's the longest.  All
    summer I worked at Gadzooks, folding novelty t-shirts, and on each break, I
    would listen to <i>Lateralus</i> because the store just plays hip-hop and
    dance.  My manager would always get on me for taking my breaks 20 minutes too
    long, but that's how long the album is and it just sucks you in.  It's like
    this big desert world with mountains of riffs, and drum thunderstorms just
    roll across the sky.  The packaging is also cool, since it has this clear book
    with a skinless guy, and as you turn the pages, it rips off his muscles and
    stuff.  Tool's music does the same thing.  It can just rip the muscles and skin
    off you.  I think that's what they meant.  So my manager would be like, ""Hey,
    there's a new box of 'Blunt Simpson' shirts I need you to put out and the
    'Original Jackass' shelf is getting low.""  He's a vegan and I would buy him
    Orange Julius because he didn't know there's egg powder in there.</p><p>
    The first song is called ""The Grudge,"" and it's about astrology and how people
    control stuff.  Maynard sings like a robot or clone at the opening, spitting,
    ""Wear the crutch like a crown/ Calculate what we will/ Will not tolerate/
    Desperate to control/ All and everything.""  Tool know about space and math,
    and it's pretty complex.  ""Saturn ascends/ Not one but ten,"" he sings.  No
    Doubt and R.E.M. sang out that, too, but those songs were wimpy and short.
    Maynard shows his intelligence with raw stats.  I think there's meaning behind
    those numbers, like calculus.  He also mentions ""prison cell"" and ""tear it
    down"" and ""controlling"" and ""sinking deeper,"" which all symbolize how he feels.
    Seven minutes into the song, he does this awesome scream for 24 seconds
    straight, which is like the longest scream I've ever heard.  Then at the end
    there's this part where Danny Carey hits every drum he has.  This wall of
    drums just pounds you.  Then the next song starts and it's quiet and trippy.
    Tool are the best metal band, since they can get trippy (almost pretty, but
    in a dark way) then just really loud.  Most bands just do loud, so Tool is
    more prog.</p><p>
    Danny Carey is the best drummer in rock, dispute that and I <i>know</i> you
    are a dunce. I made a list of all of his gear (from the June issue of <i>Modern
    Drummer</i>):</p><p>
<i>Drums, Sonor Designer Series (bubinga wood): 8x14 snare (bronze), 8x8 tom,
    10x10 tom, 16x14 tom, 18x16 floor tom, two 18x24 bass drums.</i></p><p>
    Cymbals, Paiste: 14"" Sound Edge Dry Crisp hi-hats, 6"" signature bell over 8""
    signature bell, 10"" signature splash, 24"" 2002 China, 18"" signature full
    crash, #3 cup chime over #1 cup chime, 18"" signature power crash, 12""
    signature Micro-Hat, 22"" signature Dry Heavy ride, 22"" signature Thin China,
    20"" signature Power crash.</p><p>
    Electronics: Simmons SDX pads, Korg Wave Drum, Roland MC-505, Oberheim TVS.</p><p>
    Hardware: Sonor stands, Sonor, Axis or Pro-Mark hi-hat stand, Axis or Pearl
    bass drum petals with Sonor or Pearl beaters (loose string tension, but with
    long throw).</p><p>
    Heads: Evans Power Center on snare batter (medium high tuning, no muffling),
    G2s on tom batters with G1s underneath (medium tuning with bottom head higher
    than batter), EQ3 bass drum batter with EQ3 resonant on front (medium tuning,
    with EQ pad touching front and back heads).</p><p>
    Sticks: Trueline Danny Carey model (wood tip).</p><p>
    He has his own sticks, even.  In ""Schism,"" the double basses just go nuts at
    the end.  They also do in ""Eon Blue Apocalypse.""  And in ""The Grudge.""  And
    in ""Ticks &amp; Leeches.""  And nobody uses more toms in metal.  You can really
    hear the 8x8 and 10x10 toms in the opening for ""Ticks &amp; Leeches."" Over the
    summer, I counted the number of tom hits in that song, and it's 1,023!!
    Amazing.  That's my favorite song, since it's the one that starts with Maynard
    screaming, ""Suck it!""  Then he says, ""Little parasite.""  Later he shouts,
    ""This is what you wanted... I hope you choke on it!""  Every time I watched my
    boss suck down those Orange Juliuses I had that stuck in my head.</p><p>
    There is simply no way you could just dismiss the music (which is excellent).
    The bass playing is just really creepy and slow and sometimes it has this
    watery effect.  Tool even follow in the footsteps of Caravan with Middle
    Eastern or Asian or something sounds.  ""Disposition"" features bongos, and then
    on the next song, ""Reflection,"" Carey's toms sound like bongos or tablas or
    whatever is in those Fruitopia commercials.  Close your eyes and imagine if
    Asia had a space program.  This is like the music they'd play.   The song is
    called ""Reflection"" since it's quieter and slower and sounds like it's from
    India, where people go to reflect. Maynard's voice sounds like that little
    bleached midget girl flying around inside the walls in <i>Polterghost</i>.
    It's messed up.</p><p>
    In conclusion, there is more emotion on that album than would be on 30 Weezer
    albums. At the very least, there's 2.5 times as much.  Like I said, it's
    messed up, like the world, which makes it very real.  I don't think I'm going
    to have a kid this year, but that's also a good thing.  Just imagine the Tool
    record that will come out in three years, according to my theory.  It will be
    the future, and albums can be like longer with better compression and
    technology.  Even as amazing as <i>Lateralus</i> is, I feel like there's a
    monster coming in three years.  Music comes in cycles, and works on math, and
    my life and Tool are proof of that for sure.</p></div>"|8104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8104-lateralus/|1.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

From Old Navy
    revisions of 70's clothing fads to icy, haute couture boutiques in upscale
    malls pushing $800 Chanel pocketbooks, it all seems a bit pointless; our
    culture's rabid materialism and hunger for the next big thing ensures style
    shifts every several months.</p><p>
    Depeche Mode are no strangers to fashion-- it's in their name.  Over the
    course of 14 albums, they've often favored style over substance, occasionally
    stopping to strike an emotional chord along the way.  But no one could accuse
    them of changing with musical fads and trends.  If anything, they've remained
    more consistent in twenty years than almost any of their contemporaries.  And
    now, in the age of the beat, they've even toned down the dance rhythms that
    powered their earlier work in favor of a more abstract direction, albeit one
    that still screams Depeche Mode.</p><p>
    It's taken Martin Gore, Dave Gahan, and Andrew Fletcher four years to follow
    up 1997's <i>Ultra</i>, but even with Björk producer Mark Bell on board,
    calling their new opus <i>Exciter</i> is kind of overstating it.  From a
    production standpoint, the record sounds great, but at its core, it comes up
    empty, lacking a solid foundation of good songs to rest its adventurous
    studio trickery upon.</p><p>
    Longtime fans will still find a lot to like here: ""Dream On"" tempers rolling
    acoustic guitars with a bed of twitching, programmed beats and fractured synth
    samples, and Dave Gahan's rich, unaffected vocals.  Even with a new sonic
    direction, the song feels like classic Depeche Mode, and would sit nicely
    alongside most of the material on their greatest hits compilations.  ""I Am
    You"" is another standout, diving headlong into uncharted territory with some
    truly bizarre, high-pitched synth squeals surfacing in the chorus.  This
    background serves to unsettle an otherwise comfortable environment, and its
    juxtaposition of beauty and ugliness is in tune with the Rephlex aesthetic.</p><p>
    Mark Bell's deft touch lends every moment of <i>Exciter</i> a certain glow of
    invention, but it's not all brilliant by any means.  Every pretty girl gets
    something stuck in her teeth eventually, and these lyrics are a giant hunk of
    dark green spinach wedged between the incisors.  The boys heap on enough
    lyrical dross to kill a high school goth.  To view some of the most egregious
    offenses, let's briefly visit the Martin GORE Shop of Lyrical Horrors:</p><p>
    &gt;From ""Shine"": ""Put on your blindfold and a dress that's tight/ And come with
    me on a mystery night.../ Somebody has to shine for me/ It's difficult not to
    shine for me.""
    &gt;From ""The Dead of Night"": ""We're the horniest boys/ With the corniest ploys/
    Who take the easiest girls/ To our sleaziest worlds.../ We are the dead of
    night/ We're in the zombie room/ We're twilight's parasites/ With
    self-inflicted wounds.""</p><p>
    &gt;From ""Freelove"": ""Hey girl/ You've got to take this moment/ Then let it slip
    away/ Let go of complicated feelings/ There's no price to pay.../ And I'm
    only here/ To bring you free love/ Let's make it clear/ That this is free
    love.""</p><p>
    A visit like this could last a lot longer, but it would probably get pretty
    dull.  Unfortunately, boredom is a prevailing mood when listening to the whole
    of <i>Exciter</i>.  The first few times through, it's hard to stay invested
    past the fifth track, ""The Dead of Night.""  The two instrumental interludes,
    ""Lovetheme"" and ""Easy Tiger,"" are both rather unnecessary padding, and
    ""Breathe,"" with its string of Biblical references, simply plods.  ""I Feel
    Loved"" is the only track that appears to be aimed toward a dancefloor, though
    it plays more like the 5:00am comedown song the DJ spins to get you to leave.</p><p>
    The somewhat conventional ballad ""Goodnight Lovers"" brings the album to a
    reasonably engaging close with its warm synth patches and familiar chord
    progressions, but its lyrics concerning ""soul sisters and soul brothers"" feel
    forced.  Depeche Mode and Mark Bell deserve a lot of credit for constructing
    the album's sounds from scratch, avoiding factory presets and rarely using
    the same sound combinations twice.  The band should also be lauded for sticking
    to their guns after twenty years of falling in and out of fashion.</p><p>
    But despite the amazing range of sounds they've conjured, <i>Exciter</i>
    ultimately fails to interest.  Too much of it drifts by unnoticed, and the
    songs themselves often form around a vacuous core of trite lyrical conceits.
    It's the most frustrating type of album there is-- one that's full of promise
    and shining moments, but never fully delivers.  Add to this the fact that
    those shining moments stand out like volcanoes in Nebraska, and you get
    something that the fans should own, and the neophytes should steer clear of.</p></div>"|2283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2283-exciter/|5.5|Joe Tangari

    Oh, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer. Oh, Weezer. How sad I am for Weezer. Let's
    backtrack. This requires a lot of personal history to be revealed-- total
    stream-of-consciousness memory recall. We'll start in 1994. In 1994, I was
    ten years old. Rock music was a new and relatively unknown concept to me.
    By rock music, I mean <em>rock</em> music: distorted guitars, hard-hitting
    drums, the harshness of grunge and rock. It had already broken onto mainstream
    radio, but I was too young to pay attention. I was a weird kid, busying myself
    with Talking Heads and Laurie Anderson records.</p><p>
    
    The girl who lived next door (and who also happened to take care of me on
    occasion, when my parents were out) was probably around 12 or 13 at the
    time. I thought she was beautiful. It resembled a crush, although it probably
    wasn't. And occasionally, we would listen to CDs. She brought over her very
    small collection-- mine was already three times as large. There was a blue
    disc amongst her discs. She pulled it out and pressed play. My world was
    blasted apart. She clearly loved this, and I had no idea what to think.
    ""Undone (The Sweater Song)"" was her favorite. It was one of those rare 'brand
    new' experiences I'm lucky enough to be able to remember.  Not long after, I
    obtained a copy of my own. It was my favorite album for a very long time. I
    ordered lyrics from the fan club through the mail. I memorized the handwritten
    words while listening to the album on repeat. ""My Name is Jonas"" was pure beauty,
    and ""Only in Dreams"" was pure power. It still is.</p><p>
    
    Somehow, I didn't manage to pick up <i>Pinkerton</i> until 1999. I'd kind of
    forgotten about Weezer for a year or two, and then suddenly I remembered them.
    At first, I wasn't terribly impressed, clearly being more familiar with the sound
    of grunge and angst. And then I listened to it a second time and was knocked
    out all over again.  I went back to ""the blue album,"" this time understanding
    the intricacies of the sound-- what makes the songs so warm and effective.
    Its simple brilliance slapped me; it sounded as fresh as it did the first time
    I ever heard it.  So naturally, as news of Weezer recording began to circulate
    late last year, I was overjoyed.  How would they follow-up the blistering,
    angry <i>Pinkerton</i>?</p><p>
    
    And then, months later, Weezer released ""Hash Pipe."" It was on the radio one
    day a few weeks ago. I listened to it. I listened to the whole song, from
    beginning to end.  And when it ended, I said no. I said no no no no no. No!
    Weezer! NO!! Where has Rivers Cuomo gone? What has he done? What has happened
    to Weezer?! WHERE ARE THE REAL WEEZER?!! My heart was broken. Really. This is
    going to sound like hyperbole, but I hated music at that moment. For just a
    moment, I lost faith completely. It was an overblown reaction, granted, but
    even after I realized how ridiculous I was being, I still felt a hatred. The
    song was abysmal, no two ways about it. It wasn't awkward. It wasn't charming.
    It didn't have dueling guitar solos with soaring and intricate harmonies. And
    what it wasn't made it what it was: stale, polished, emotionless.</p><p>
    
    The new self-titled Weezer album, as it turns out, is average from beginning
    to end. There are maybe one or two decent melodies out of the ten songs here,
    and the only change in tone comes with ""Island in the Sun,"" the album's only
    truly enjoyable song and its catchiest hook.  It's the first and only moment of
    even moderate pleasure in the record's brief yet far too long 28-minute length.
    But even with this singular change in volume and mood, <em>Weezer</em> lacks the
    sense of dynamics and intricacy that <i>Pinkerton</i>-- and especially their
    debut-- held in spades. There's no power to these songs, and even less depth.</p><p>
    
    It's a de-evolution back through <i>Pinkerton</i>, through the blue album,
    and beyond.  Like ""Hash Pipe,"" it doesn't seem genuine anymore.  But <i>The
    Green Album</i> doesn't generally sound like the canned, artificial angst of
    ""Hash Pipe""; it has a sunny disposition, with songs like ""O Girlfriend"" and
    ""Glorious Day."" An actual line from the song ""Smile,"" for instance: ""Open up
    your heart and let the good stuff come out."" It's unoriginal, moronic and tacky,
    and that's all there is to it. Nothing under the surface. Disappointment.</p><p>
    
    I was bitter.  At Rivers, at Weezer, at Geffen and Interscope.  This was one of
    my favorite bands. They were the only band whose fan club I have ever joined.
    They had significance.  They opened musical doors for me. This album is not that
    Weezer. But I had to write a review, so I did a little research.  And I read
    that, after the complete failure of the angst and emotional extremes of
    <i>Pinkerton</i> in the music world, Cuomo felt as if his goal to be a rockstar
    was completely obliterated. So he locked himself in his room for a year, with no
    outside contact, and when he came out, his work suddenly had no emotional
    content.</p><p>
    
    He's now afraid that fans of the band will hate the new album and lose touch
    with him and the group. He genuinely realizes that all of the feeling in his
    vocals and lyrics are gone, and he realizes that it's probably a phase. And
    I suddenly share his fear. So maybe the real Weezer-- the Weezer I know and
    love-- can come back now. After this phase ends and the album goes platinum,
    maybe they'll feel better about themselves. I'm going to go upstairs now to
    listen to the album that is 1994 to me, the album that is still new and
    marvelous to me after seven years, and fall asleep content.</p></div>"|8611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8611-weezer-green-album/|4.0|Spencer Owen

    rank up there with climbing Mount Everest. Stoned. With one leg. And no oxygen.
    Given the infinite potential for obnoxious excess within the Rock genre, it's
    no small feat to assemble an album that's so well phrased, so deftly stated,
    that its impact extends far beyond the realm of the audible.  Turn out two or
    more such albums and you're headed for legendary status.  Turn out five or six
    and you're R.E.M.</p><p>
    
    One of the great things about R.E.M.'s musical history is how they've managed
    to retain a distinctive sound while releasing a series of sonically diverse
    albums. The wistful ruminations of <i>Automatic for the People</i> evoked
    images of the grandiose and darkly beautiful.  <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i>
    served as a companion piece to the barren yet oddly gorgeous landscape of the
    west.  And despite all this change, R.E.M. has always remained R.E.M.</p><p>
    
    The good news is that R.E.M. are still R.E.M.  Every song on <i>Reveal</i>
    possesses that inimitable stylistic element present in all of their work to
    date. And in many ways, <i>Reveal</i> is a comforting listen.  While it does
    rely more heavily on synthesized sounds than any of their past albums, the
    songs themselves bear a stronger resemblance to the archetypal R.E.M. song
    than anything post-<i>Monster</i>.</p><p>
    
    What makes <i>Reveal</i> so disappointing is that the additions to the classic
    R.E.M. sound are all merely superficial.  The increased reliance on burbling,
    jittering synthesizers actually makes the album a less engaging listen, turning
    many of its songs into messy sonic muddles.  The band's better works demonstrated
    a certain aural economy-- each sound had a purpose; nothing was extraneous or
    unnecessary.  But far too many of the effects on <i>Reveal</i> seem added to
    the songs as afterthoughts, and prevent the tracks from materializing into
    coherent, compelling pieces of music.</p><p>
    
    This, however, is only part of a greater problem facing the album: most of the
    songs here simply don't go anywhere. A chord progression, a rhythm, a basic
    structure for the song is introduced.  And oftentimes, that's it.  Slight
    variations may factor in, but far too many of these tracks just sort of chug
    along, uninspired and drained of the energy that once made these guys so vital.
    Were this lack of variation coupled with wrenchingly beautiful melodies, it
    would be a lot easier to swallow.  But as it stands, much of <i>Reveal</i>
    simply drifts by, failing to register emotionally or evoke the kind of rich,
    vivid imagery that earlier albums brimmed over with.</p><p>
    
    Which is not to say that <i>Reveal</i> is entirely devoid of merit. ""The
    Lifting"" opens the album promisingly, with an undeniably great melody and an
    all-enveloping background of piano, strings, and synthesizers. But even this,
    one of <i>Reveal</i>'s better tracks, can't escape from some of the record's
    pitfalls (most notably mind-numbing repetitiveness).  Its first single,
    ""Imitation of Life,"" bears a strong resemblance to the painfully awkward ""The
    Great Beyond"" single from the <i>Man on the Moon</i> soundtrack.  But it makes
    up for terrible lyrics by providing two things that <i>Reveal</i> lacks as a
    whole: a catchy hook, and a sufficient degree of sonic variety. It's certainly
    not a perfect song, but when held up against the browns and grays of the rest
    of the album, it provides a welcome glimmer of sunshine.</p><p>
    
    In a documentary about the making of R.E.M.'s last album, <i>Up</i>, Michael
    Stipe spoke of ""moments of clarity,"" glimpses of the transcendental beauty
    and truth that he aims to convey in R.E.M.'s music.  There are no such moments
    to be found on <i>Reveal</i>.  The album is so muddled and repetitive that
    it's almost impossible to pick out any kind of individual moments within the
    album's framework. When I put on most R.E.M. albums and close my eyes, my mind
    is flooded with crystalline imagery, with miniature explosions, with the very
    moments of clarity that Stipe described; when I put on <i>Reveal</i> and close
    my eyes, I fall asleep.</p></div>"|6748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6748-reveal/|5.0|Matt LeMay

Or
    at least, he seems to have a lot of friends who like him.  What makes me say
    this? Is it the lyrical content of <i>Look into the Eyeball</i>, Byrne's sixth
    solo record, that gives it away?  Is it the joyous quality of his voice as he
    sings a Spanish duet with Nrü of Cafè Tacuba?  Or is it the fact that exactly
    <i>forty-nine</i> (49) guest musicians are credited in the liner notes?</p><p>
    If I were you, I'd probably go with the latter observation.  I'm not sure if
    <em>any</em> solo album really warrants 49 people, but Byrne tries his damnedest
    to come up with good uses for all of them.  First of all, he's David Byrne,
    the charismatic, iconic former frontman of one of the most influential bands
    of the last 25 years.  It's hard to argue with the man.  Secondly, even with
    his multitude of backup musicians, he's the only person that plays guitar.</p><p>
    And third, 19 of the guests here play a string instrument.</p><p>
    You probably don't need to read 19 names to figure out that much of <i>Look
    into the Eyeball</i> is coated with stringed accompaniment, often in the
    forefront.  But this is no chamber music album.  For the most part, it
    consists of upbeat, funk-laden pop songs, with lyrics that rarely penetrate
    past one's eyeball, but rhythms that bounce and shake for better or worse.
    It's a step back from the loose concept of <i>Feelings</i>; there are only a
    couple of feelings present here, and they either relate to the music or are
    extremely cryptic.</p><p>
    Bittersweet melody has become one of Byrne's strongest songwriting suits over
    the past decade, and it isn't spared here. ""The Great Intoxicator"" refers to
    music as its namesake, with looped and organic Latin percussion providing a
    steady pulse as the dynamic strings aid Byrne in his graceful and melodic
    expression of the sentiment.  Unexpectedly, though, some of the record's best
    moments come when Byrne strips away the rhythmic accessories and relies on
    basic orchestral backing, as with ""The Revolution,"" a gorgeous acoustic
    guitar-and-violin ballad that again uses music as part of its lyrical
    imagery.</p><p>
    And yet, the majority of the album still relies on primal, swinging grooves.
    The obvious single, ""Like Humans Do,"" features nonsensical lyrics akin to
    <i>Little Creatures</i>-era Talking Heads about doing things, uh... like
    humans do.  Such as ""achin',"" ""shakin',"" and ""breakin',"" as the chorus informs
    us.  But as ridiculous as the lyrics get, Byrne's melody is undeniably
    infectious, and his rhythm will no doubt get some appendage of yours tapping.
    The song also stands as the best example of the album's use of strings and
    horns for texture-- an entire orchestra seems to sit in the back of this
    backyard jam session, and it seems perfectly in place. ""Broken Things"" is
    <i>Eyeball</i>'s musical peak, though, as the raw global funk aesthetic
    that pervaded his 1994 self-titled record comes back into play. The violins
    wisely sit this one out.</p><p>
    After ""Descondido Soy,"" the aforementioned Spanish-language duet with Nrü,
    the album slumps-- specifically with ""Neighborhood,"" a coy, 70's lite-funk
    tune employing an innumerable amount of clichéd disco aesthetics.  Despite
    this misstep, though, Byrne gets back on his feet with a few more tunes that,
    while never truly living up to the <i>Eyeball</i>'s first half, wring out the
    kind of rhythmic and melodic glee only Byrne can pull off. Maybe that's why
    so many pals flocked to play with him; he still has a lot of fun in the
    studio.</p></div>"|1060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1060-look-into-the-eyeball/|8.0|Spencer Owen

    A song can rock as hard as Keith Moon drumming with dynamite sticks at the
    peak of a coke binge, but without a hook, what are you going to remember?
    ""Yeah, dude, it rocked."" But can you hum it? Can you pick up a guitar and
    clumsily finger the melody in a matter of seconds?  No.  No, you can't.</p><p>
    
    Of course, we all need to rock out, too.  Not paper, not scissors-- rock.  I
    mean, hooks are all well and good, but limp pop can only go so far, no matter
    how catchy it is.  What you need is that extra power chord, or maybe that
    unnecessary cymbal crash, to hammer it home.</p><p>
    
    I've often had trouble reconciling these conflicting needs. Usually, the best
    I can do is stand in front of my CD player and rapidly alternate between
    hook-filled pop and balls-out rock 'n' roll. That, and listening to Burning
    Airlines' excellent debut album, <i>Mission: Control!</i> Not only did
    <i>Mission: Control!</i> rock as hard as anything J Robbins put out with
    Jawbox, it was crammed with unforgettable pop hooks the likes of which have
    rarely ever graced such a tight rock album.</p><p>
    
    And oh, was the result potent. An album that was catchy enough to get stuck
    in your head, and rockin' enough to give you whiplash from the countless hours
    spent mentally replaying the album.  At least, the jaw-dropping first half of
    it was.  Aside from a few weak spots in the later innings, there was little
    fault to be found in <i>Mission: Control!</i>  From a technical or purely
    instinctual point of view, it was a masterfully pulled-off affair.  Sadly,
    such a perfect balance cannot be maintained forever. Ice caps melt, dodos
    become extinct, and rock overpowers the unsuspecting pop hook.  <i>Identikit</i>,
    the Burning Airlines' second full-length, is certainly a fine rock record.
    But with only a few exceptions, it lacks the hooks to really pull you in.</p><p>
    
    But to break from tradition, let's look at the exceptions rather than the
    rule. ""A Song with No Words,"" with its twisted, effects-laden guitar riffage,
    lively guitar/bass interplay, and compelling vocal melody, is Burning Airlines
    at their best. While several of the lyrics to ""A Song with No Words"" (yes, it
    has lyrics), could easily be considered typical love song fare, the slithery,
    off-putting guitar part and intricate bassline give the song some deliciously
    shifty undertones. ""Outside the Aviary,"" the album's opener, utilizes a more
    traditional means to achieve a similar result; it's a fiery, intense rock song
    held together by the interplay of three expert musicians.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, though, even these songs aren't as instant as the standouts from
    <i>Mission: Control!</i> It seems that when Bill Barbot left the group, so
    did the memorable riffs. New bassist and songwriting collaborator Mike Harbin
    does contribute driving, fluid basslines, and a more dissonant edge, but often,
    the dissonance seems to accomplishing very little.  When it's on the stereo,
    <i>Identikit</i> can be a vicious, intense listen. But unlike its predecessor,
    once the record ends, you're ready to move on.</p></div>"|1024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1024-identikit/|7.4|Matt LeMay

    re-release of Harry Smith's <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>.
    Originally released in 1952, the three-volume set-- a fourth volume was added
    in 2000-- provides an awesome, sweeping perspective of the foundation of
    American music. Then, in 1999, came Moby's <i>Play</i>, which sampled Alan
    Lomax-era field blues; by 2000, the word ""ubiquity"" had become an
    understatement. And here in 2001, the soundtrack to the Coen brothers'
    southern romp through the Odyssey, <i>O Brother Where Art Thou</i>, has
    reached unlikely heights, peaking at #13 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200.</p><p>
    
    I think it's safe to say that American roots music-- that is, pre-WWII
    country, blues, and folk, which were often indiscernible-- is more popular
    than it's been for at least 30 years, if not since the era of its creation.
    And it probably won't get any more popular than this. Smith's anthology is
    collecting dust in East Village apartments. <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou</i>
    has slipped out of the Top 20, albeit gracefully. And, alas, all 18
    commercially licensed tracks from Moby's album are evaporating from our
    collective consciousness.  (At last!)</p><p>
    
    This minor boom helped lift some artists, like Emmylou Harris and Ramblin'
    Jack Elliott back into the spotlight. Still, there are countless more
    artists-- Eric Von Schmidt and Stefan Grossman, to name a couple-- who
    should've received attention for their old-time talents, but never did. But
    who would have thought, ten years ago, that the lead singer of the Screaming
    Trees would be one of the neglected?</p><p>
    
    Mark Lanegan, the solo artist, has written music with his feet planted firmly
    in aged American soil. Over the course of four solo albums since 1990, his
    gritty blues, country and folk has become progressively more roots-oriented,
    not to mention more sophisticated. Lanegan's determination to hone his sound
    culminated with 1998's <i>I'll Take Care of You</i>, a covers album that
    ranged from Buck Owens- to Jeffrey Lee Pierce-penned songs, yet managed to
    unify all of them.</p><p>
<i>Field Songs</i> is, fortunately for us, more of the same, except that
    Lanegan's back to writing original material. This is sub-pop in the truest
    sense: it's music made in the pop/rock era with influences from before the
    era was even conceived.  But his sonic palette has also widened. Just seconds
    into the opener, ""One Way Track,"" after the snare-heavy percussion and soft
    electric and acoustic guitars shuffle in, the ears are pricked by low-decibel
    dissonance: echoing guitar scratches like high-pitched thunder or machine-gun
    fire; a twinkling piano like rain on a corrugated tin roof; buzzing like a
    recalcitrant computer. But none of it invades the space needed for his husky
    voice and lines like, ""The stars and the moon aren't where they're supposed
    to be/ But a strange electric light falls so close to me.""</p><p>
    
    The next track, ""No Easy Action,"" opens with female ahhh's before breaking
    into a whir- and acoustic-fueled tear through blues romps, gospel choirs, and
    rock psychedelics. As always, Lanegan's voice is as compellingly loud and
    high-pitched as it is low and smoky; but accompanied, as he is during this
    moment, by the almost tribal voices of the women, his music reaches an
    uplifting epiphany. And then there's the utterly different epiphany reached
    on ""Field Song,"" where soft, reverberated chords give way to nearly a minute
    of crashing guitars. But on most of these tracks, the touches are very subtle:
    rain in the background of the beautiful, understated instrumental, ""Blues for
    D""; distant guitars crackling like falling timbers on ""Fix""; buzzing tolls
    ringing over the hills on ""She's Done Too Much.""</p><p>
    
    While these additions have prevented Lanegan from being straight-jacketed by
    his roots influences, as some fans and critics feared, those addicted to
    Lanegan's dark sound need not worry. When you distill <i>Field Songs</i>,
    what's left is the same haunted man singing folk, blues, and country numbers
    for the depressed and downtrodden. Even with deep, yet restrained atmospherics
    at work-- as on ""One Way Street""-- he's singing lines like, ""I drink so much
    sour whiskey, I can hardly see."" Furthermore, the majority of these tracks are
    still the full-sounding, yet bare-boned affairs that Lanegan has made his
    trademark. If any album is capable of delivering roots music's last gasp of
    popularity, <i>Field Songs</i> is it.</p></div>"|4677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4677-field-songs/|8.0|Ryan Kearney

Ask Juno, and they'd certainly say no.
    After all, their new album, <i>A Future Lived in Past Tense</i>, is close to
    70 minutes long, with quite a few tracks ranging between seven and ten minutes
    in length. There aren't many bands that can pull this off, but Juno proved on
    their 1999 debut, <i>This is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes</i>, that
    they're capable of crafting highly intriguing compositions over extended
    periods of time.  That record was a masterpiece of soaring guitar rock, and
    not a note of it was wasted.  But a few listens to this sophomore effort
    should give an indication of just how thin the line between ""trance-inducing""
    and ""sleep-inducing"" can be.</p><p>
    This isn't to say that the entirety of <i>A Future Lived in Past Tense</i> is
    boring; it's not, and fans of the first Juno album should find much to love
    here.  Examples: after a keyboard-driven opening instrumental, the band kicks
    it into high gear with ""Covered with Hair,"" a whirlwind assault of the band's
    distinctive three-guitar sound with frontman Arlie Carstens' expressive,
    angstful vocals evening things out. ""Help is On the Way"" takes a slightly more
    laidback approach, with repetitive, twanging guitars and a steady, thumping
    punk beat.</p><p>
    Juno have definitely calmed since their debut, as ""The Trail of Your Blood in
    the Snow"" will attest.  A slow number with tinkling piano and a shuffled beat
    under the wintry atmosphere of hushed vocals and melodic guitars, it's easily
    one of the gentler track in the band's catalog.  If the rest of the album
    sounded like this, it's doubtful anybody would complain about Juno's newfound
    quietude.</p><p>
    However, ""The French Letter"" takes the sobriety to a new level, as the song
    takes nearly seven minutes to build to a climax.  Shambling percussion and
    slow, strummed guitars plod lifelessly, obviously in no hurry to get anywhere.
    When the song finally gets around to exploding, the result is admittedly
    rousing.  Still, the average American spends over five years of their life
    waiting in traffic; do we really need our music to replicate this experience?</p><p>
    More successful is the 9+ minute ""We Slept in Rented Rooms,"" which features
    great lyrics like, ""We used each like axes/ To cut down the ones we really
    love."" Carstens' confessionals are layered over delicate, interweaving guitars
    and a complex beat, holding attention by incorporating just enough melodic
    shifts and yelled vocals to temporarily lift the somber mood.  ""Things Gone
    and Things Still Here,"" on the other hand, is a long-winded spoken word
    narrative whose sparse musical backing remains almost completely static
    throughout its 8\xBD minute length.  Carstens' creative lyrics imagine a close
    friend as she might be at the age of 73, reading over their old correspondence.
    But lyrical bright spots aside, the music here has little to recommend-- even
    the band's powerhouse guitars are absent.</p><p>
    Fortunately, <i>A Future Lived in Past Tense</i>'s last two proper songs,
    ""Killing It in a Quiet Way"" and ""You Are the Beautiful Conductor of This
    Orchestra"" (yeah, the titles are pretentious-- deal with it) pick up the pace
    with more of the blistering post-punk that made Juno's debut such a kick-ass
    record.</p><p>
    As with many long albums, <i>A Future</i> could have benefited greatly from a
    shorter running time and some better sequencing-- for instance, any sequencing
    that didn't cram the three longest songs into tracks 6, 8, and 9. But
    regardless of these flaws, Juno delivers a fairly strong album, particularly
    the first half.  The songs that manage to rock as hard as <i>This is the Way</i>'s
    best moments uphold that record's legacy, even with bassist Travis Saunders
    supplanted by interim replacements Nick Harmer of Death Cab for Cutie and Nate
    Mendel of the Foo Fighters. The more solemn tracks... eh, they're mostly okay.</p><p>
    So, to answer my own question, can you have too much good music? Definitely
    not; if Juno had delivered 70 minutes of quality along the lines of ""The Trail
    of Your Blood in the Snow"" or ""Help is on the Way,"" you wouldn't be putting up
    with my bitching right now.  But can you have too much mediocre music?  Yeah.
    Hell, yeah.</p></div>"|4320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4320-a-future-lived-in-past-tense/|6.7|Edward Howard

    camp, starting bonfires, and dancing naked under the light of the moon.</p><p>
    Alright, so maybe I'm exaggerating. But it can't be denied that of all the
    bands making epic, apocalyptic rock music these days, Mogwai seem to be the
    only ones who can sit back at the end of the day and have a good laugh. Sure,
    their music can be extremely serious and deeply affecting, but there's an
    element of adventurousness and willingness to fuck with your expectations
    that makes Mogwai less dire than their competitors.</p><p>
    This adventurousness is evidenced by the fact that Mogwai managed to craft
    a brilliant debut-- 1997's <i>Young Team</i>-- that achieved the sainted goal
    of balancing fragile beauty and overwhelming sonic terror.  <i>Young Team</i>
    allowed Mogwai to perfectly encapsulate the essence of their namesake-- those
    crazy little critters from the movie <i>Gremlins</i>. I still remember the
    song of the Mogwai; it's a simple, beautiful melody sung in freakish la-la's,
    yet signifies imminent destruction and face-rippage.  Such was the case with
    <i>Young Team</i>-- a beautifully orchestrated melodic passage could
    successfully lull you into submission. You pet it. You kiss it. You feed it
    after midnight... and boom!  Layered feedback, crashing cymbals, vacuum
    cleaner noises, claws, teeth, and wanton destruction.</p><p>
    Sadly, the follow-up to <i>Young Team</i>, 1999's <i>Come On Die Young</i>,
    replaced the aural explosions of the debut with gradual burnouts. Songs that
    could potentially have been made great seemed to go absolutely nowhere,
    resulting in an album full of wasted promise-- a better soundtrack to an
    afternoon nap than a terrifyingly beautiful explosion.</p><p>
    So what did the boys in Mogwai do?  Did they go home and whine to their mamas?
    Of course not.  Mogwai isn't a band of words, they're a band of action-- in
    this case, <i>Rock Action</i>.  As of late, the music press has been falling
    all over itself to point out that-- get this-- <i>Rock Action</i> is not
    actually full of action, nor does it rock. And while, yes, the album is, for
    the most part, a very deliberate, moderately paced album, it manages much
    like <i>Young Team</i> to pack a stellar amount of energy into a medium-tempo
    rock song.</p><p>
    Which is not to say that <i>Rock Action</i> is a carbon copy of <i>Young
    Team</i>.  Far from it, in fact.  Perhaps the greatest difference between
    this record and its predecessors is the expanded range of sounds incorporated.
    In the past, Mogwai have been largely guitar-driven, relying on plucked
    melodies coupled with soaring feedback crescendos to create their trademark
    sound.  Here, such diverse elements as banjos, patterned static, and the Welsh
    (singer Gruff Rhys from Super Furry Animals) are incorporated, making <i>Rock
    Action</i> the most sonically dense release of Mogwai's career thus far.</p><p>
    This more complex sound has its ups and its downs. On the positive side, it
    makes <i>Rock Action</i> a really fun album to pick apart. Dave Fridmann's
    production is flawless, affording each instrument just the right mix of
    distinction and ambiguity to create an engaging, yet cohesive whole.
    Unfortunately, this expanded repertoire comes at a cost. One could say that
    <i>Rock Action</i> is more focused on sound and less so on melody and
    structure than the classic <i>Young Team</i>. As a result, the epic ""You
    Don't Know Jesus,"" the album's standout track, never attains the level of
    jaw-dropping perfection that <i>Young Team</i>'s ""Like Herod"" or ""Mogwai
    Fear Satan"" laid claim to.</p><p>
    Still, <i>Rock Action</i> certainly has its peak moments. Aside from ""You
    Don't Know Jesus,"" two shorter tracks-- the opening ""Dial: Revenge"" and
    ""Secret Pint""-- perfectly showcase the strengths of Mogwai's new direction.
    The former, which features the talents of the aforementioned Gruff, puts
    vocals to better effect than the band's previous singing excursions, creating
    a stunningly gorgeous orchestral rock track that seems to extend far beyond
    its 3\xBD-minute duration. The latter, the album's closer, puts to work sparse
    piano, huge-sounding drums, and mumbled vocals, giving a beautiful ending to
    a similarly beautiful record.</p><p>
    Despite the changes the band has been through on the road from <i>Young Team</i>
    to <i>Rock Action</i>, there are enough unifying elements to conclude that
    those of you who seriously dug the band's earlier work will find a lot to
    like about the record.  Granted, it's not mind-blowing, and it's not nearly
    as masterfully executed and affecting as their earliest work. But there are
    only a handful of bands out there that can put out an album as well-constructed
    as <i>Rock Action</i> and still expect people to bitch and moan about it. The
    fact that Mogwai can laugh at their detractors could either lead to the band
    pursuing brave new directions in rock, or traveling down a path of smug
    self-satisfaction and stagnation. Either way, <i>Rock Action</i> suggests
    that it'll be worth sticking around to find out.</p></div>"|5365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5365-rock-action/|8.0|Matt LeMay

    and album title, is a quote culled from the LP's title track: ""And if we are
    the ones that will cross mountains for love/ Then we are the ones that let
    love mutilate us.""  It's hard to think of a tactic that's more self-congratulatory
    than incorporating lyrics into your cover art, especially when they're also
    printed in the liner notes.  And really, it doesn't benefit much in the way of
    advertising.  The words are just shy of being trite, and bespeak no insight
    that goes beyond the obvious.  Plus, the abstract construct of ""love"" is the
    crux of the sentiment.</p><p>
    So, it's at least a little surprising that scrupulous ex-Franklin member Brian
    Sokel and multi-instrumentalist Michael Parsell's current project, AM/FM, doesn't
    come off the least bit smarmy on record.  The Philadelphia-based duo's debut
    full-length is an unpretentious collection of lo-fi, acoustic-based pop tunes
    bolstered by Sokel's warm delivery.  AM/FM has the charm and slightly skewed pop
    sensibilities of Ween, but in song structure only.  Though, come to think of it,
    fecal humor and hallucinogenic abuse might be intriguing coming from the Polyvinyl
    camp.</p><p>
<i>Mutilate Us</i> successfully skirts stuffiness with light-hearted sincerity.
    On the upbeat ""Secretly Odds in Knowing Normal Words,"" Sokel sings, ""You said
    I was full of shit/ But what's wrong with that?"" backed by bouncy percussion
    and hand-claps.  ""Yours Recklessly"" is minor-keyed, folk territory, not entirely
    dissimilar from Elliott Smith's recent offerings.  It opens on a wobbly
    solo-acoustic note, but the song's dense, swelling climax is a lovely pay-off.
    ""Time Flows Much More Slowly This Way"" is almost absurd in its catchiness, and
    serves as just one of many examples of the adroit songwriting showcased on the
    album.</p><p>
    This doesn't mean, though, that <i>Mutilate Us</i> is as consistently great as
    the aforementioned tracks.  Sokel and Parsell sometimes sink too comfortably
    into poppiness and end up tripping over yesteryear's indie rock clichés.  ""You
    and Me at 53"" is pedestrian in its aim to emulate the Cars, and its execution
    is worse still, echoing latter-day Promise Ring emergencies.  ""Leanne, The
    Seasons Persist"" tends toward emo-pop with quiet, building instrumentation
    during the verses, but the predictability of the song's explosive between-verse
    segues render them completely ineffective.</p><p>
    Still, the occasional misfires of <i>Mutilate Us</i> are forgivable; like most
    of the record's tracks, they're brief, often clocking in under two minutes.
    And when the record is successful, it's like a piston blasting warm guitar
    pop at incredible speeds.  The bulk of the record is so assured that by the
    time its last lines are sung (those that adorn the album's cover), it's hard
    to not take their genuineness to heart and believe them.</p></div>"|144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/144-mutilate-us/|7.1|Richard M. Juzwiak

Some even manage a cool one-two punch. Missy Elliott's
    third record, on the other hand, opens with a six-track attack that's rare for any genre, especially
    contemporary R&amp;B.;  I find it hard to believe I'm only a third of the way into the record when this
    first-rate succession ends.  But even with this initial run of excellence, <i>So Addictive</i> has
    much more in store.</p><p>
    
    Elliott makes good on her intro's promise of ""some shit that you never heard before."" A range
    of beats-- from the minimal funk of ""Dog in Heat"" to the demented tabla of the single, ""Get Ur Freak
    On""-- are punctuated by wild vocal pyrotechnics and tempered by soulful crooning.  In fact, there's
    more singing on this record than rapping.  Elliott's low, throaty moans, aerial cooing, and delicious
    screams demonstrate tremendous restraint and control.  In ""I've Changed (Interlude)"", she rightly
    berates Lil' Mo for suggesting she sings like ""she's in church trying to raise money for choir
    robes.""</p><p>
    
    ""Dog in Heat"" starts as a simple lowdown funk track, building gradually upon a simple bass riff and
    drum thunk.  Elliott piles layers of vocals atop Timbaland's multiplying strings and rattles, and
    eventually veers off into an entirely new direction at the song's end. Redman and Method Man also
    provide raps, adding comic relief and charisma.  Elsewhere, Missy harmonizes with herself on ""One
    Minute Man"", again keeping the beat simple under a squeaking synthesizer hook, and this time allowing
    Ludacris to reprise the record's freak-getting-on theme by promising not a mere pit stop, but a full
    night's stay at Casa de Intercourse.</p><p>
    
    Missy finally breaks out the rap on ""Lick Shots"", twisting her voice around a Southern/Martian accent.
    ""Y'all don't HEAR me/ You've got your guns but you don't SCEEER me/ BRRRRAAGHH!"" The crazy phrasings
    and vocal eruptions that dominate this album are introduced here, and then let loose in the anthemic
    ""Get Ur Freak On"", where they halt beats and maneuver labyrinthine rhythm structures like ""Lexus Jeeps"".
    Its hook features the sort of Eastern percussion that runs rampant on Top 40 radio, but rarely is it
    used so effectively.  Timbaland's technique is undeniably masterful, too, as he plays with meter,
    dynamics and expectations, allowing Missy to stop and spit ""HOLLA!"" and ""Shhh..."" over surreal
    stillness and silence.</p><p>
    
    ""Scream (aka Itchin')"" shakes its maraca under some prickles of shrill synths while Elliott details
    a sexual encounter. Rapid-fire rhyme quatrains and triplets spew forth, punctuated by screams like
    something the Bomb Squad used to blast for Public Enemy.  ""Old School Joint"" comes along to ""flip the
    beat"", keeping <i>So Addictive</i> stylistically varied while pushing dance music to euphoric heights.
    Its ""flashlight"" and ""neon light"" references pay homage to P-Funk, but rather than mimicking the
    seminal funkateers, Missy integrates a heavier disco sound, creating something fresh out of an
    otherwise tired influence.  ""Take Away"", though, attempts to update early Prince ballads, and instead
    reveals how those slow R&amp;B; jams depended on The Artist's histrionics to carry the song.  And despite
    having already proven herself more than capable of similar theatricalities, she relies on played-out
    vocoder, and irrationally allows Ginuwine to dumb things down with ""sensitive"" crooning.</p><p>
<i>So Addictive</i> is further held back by sporadic low points during its second half.  Not even
    reversed cymbals, snazzy rim shots and processed soul-girl harmonies can distract from the fact that
    neither ""Step Off"" nor ""X-tasy"" actually go anywhere.  Also guilty are the superfluous remix of ""One
    Minute Man"", featuring Jay-Z, and a religious bonus track that has its mind, and length, set on
    eternity.</p><p>
    
    Still, there are three absolutely killer songs on <i>So Addictive</i>'s second half. ""4 My People""
    features Missy at her most sincere, begging, ""Put the needle on the track/ Skip that, flip that, bring
    the beat back.""  ""Slap Slap Slap"" is both ferocious and psychedelic, with a backwards guitar and some
    fierce guest turns by Da Brat and Jade.  And, after a pointless but impressive Busta Rhymes interlude,
    ""Whatcha Gon' Do"" rolls through with Timbaland's guttural rap and a rumbling beat that loops around
    itself like a perpetual motion machine set on accelerate.  Synthesizers hiss like hydraulic pistons
    and hover like boomerangs while background guitar sounds wail like ghost cats in heat.</p><p>
    
    Of course, to say <i>Miss E</i> is addictive is pushing it.  Sure, I'm having a great time experimenting
    with this stuff right now.  But I can stop any time I want.</p></div>"|2757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2757-miss-e-so-addictive/|8.2|Dan Kilian

    become jaded.  After years of sawing through one stack of promo records after
    another, the thinking goes, critics develop a love/hate relationship with the
    medium and begin to think of listening as drudgery. Adding some credence to
    this idea is the undeniable fact that music writers are so often confronted
    with music they find less than inspiring.</p><p>
    
    I don't think this has happened to me, personally. I'm more excited with
    exploring new sounds than ever, and I'm always impressed with how much
    truly great stuff is out there. I will say, though, that I rarely find a
    record that completely devastates me. After spending so much time listening,
    thinking, and comparing different sounds, sometimes I think the language of
    music has a smaller vocabulary than I once imagined. If it's true that
    anything is possible in art, it's equally true that 99% of the people making
    it couldn't give a toss; they're perfectly content to find a way to express
    themselves by building directly on the past.  And there's not a thing wrong
    with that.  Innovation, after all, is not the same thing as quality.</p><p>
    
    Every once a while, though, I hear a record that has a truckload of both these
    qualities, and I get that coveted ""blown away"" feeling. The Boredoms' <i>Super
    Ae</i> was one such record, and Mouse on Mars's <i>Idiology</i> is another.
    Just about everything I love about music these days is on this album somewhere,
    and it has made me so very happy.</p><p>
    
    The key word when Jan St Werner and Andi Toma sat down to make this record
    was ""more"". More melody, more instruments, more singing, more sounds, and more
    noise. Almost half the eleven songs feature vocals of some kind, all of them
    sung by the band's versatile drummer Dodo Nkishi.  These range from the
    hyper-processed ""Actionist Respoke"", with its oddly funny, high-pitched
    screams, to the dense, layered harmonies of ""Presence"", where Nkishi channels
    the fragile harmonies of Yes.</p><p>
    
    Strings and horns are all over <i>Idiology</i>, and throughout I'm astonished
    at the odd and beautiful ways Mouse on Mars combine traditional orchestration
    with electronics. ""Subsequence"", for example, opens with a tough, funky digital
    groove that reminds me of what I imagined Prince's mythical <i>Black Album</i>
    might sound like before I heard it. And then, just a little over a minute in,
    an acoustic grand piano joins the fray, playing chords that, I swear, seem
    lifted from Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"". The first time I heard it, I did a
    doubletake and then realized how rarely I feel genuinely <i>surprised</i> by
    a piece of music. My admiration only grew as clarinets, violins and French
    horns folded into the charming and rhythmically irresistible track.</p><p>
    
    Even more leftfield for Mouse on Mars is ""Presence"".  I've heard others
    compare it to Robert Wyatt, but my prog background is limited, so let's
    just agree that it sounds like a song from a time when bearded men were
    interested in expanding the boundaries of rock.  Those hoping for a more
    contemporary reference point might consider Gastr del Sol.  Like the best
    tracks on <i>Camoufleur</i>, ""Presence"" is baroque pop, thick with virtuosic
    electronic detail. From the angelic but not-quite-catchy melody, to the words
    (which seem to be about either the phenomenology of being or Led Zeppelin's
    seventh album), to the folky, horn-drenched coda, ""Presence"" is dense enough
    to dissect over the course of a hundred listens.</p><p>
    
    I love fact that <i>Idiology</i> can contain both the nouveau prog of ""Presence""
    and ""Doit"", which is industrial reggae as played by Tom Waits's <i>Rain Dogs</i>
    band, complete with pedal steel guitar. More than any other song here, ""Doit""
    shows that Mouse on Mars can write interesting lyrics when so inclined:</p><p>
<i>And the ship up there that wants to leave<br/>
    Filled up to the brim with children<br/>
    Hangs a little while, but the string<br/>
    Is wearing-- silently</i></p><p>
    
    I love the tension in these words. What's going to happen when that string
    gives way?</p><p>
    
    If the additions are what make this record distinctive, what's left out is
    what makes it brilliant. The brief ""Paradical"", probably my favorite track
    here, illustrates the point. It starts with two chords that sound played on
    an out-of-tune piano with ball-peen hammers. A strange and lovely melody in
    an Eastern scale enters, first on synthesizer, then on subtly building
    strings. Finally, as the small orchestra completely overtakes the track and
    the beautiful melody is fully unveiled, the song disappears. Like this
    49-minute album, ""Paradical"" is over much too quickly. But desire is more
    interesting than satiation, which is why God invented the repeat button.</p></div>"|5461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5461-idiology/|9.6|Mark Richard-San

In
    hindsight, Milla Jovovich filled the role better.  He's clapped the laptop
    shut and hit CRTL-Q in ProTools.  Currently, Kinsella(s?  Are we still doing
    the 's'?) fronts the Owls with a reunited Cap'n Jazz line-up. Their upcoming
    Steve Albini-produced debut is stripped-down, guitars/bass/drums Chicago emo,
    pretty much picking up where Cap'n Jazz, Ghosts and Vodka, and American
    Football left off.  In other words, Tim Kinsella either missed the point or
    desperately wants those teen fans back.</p><p>
    
    Forever dreaming of a Drag City membership, Kinsella gradually moved from rock
    tunes with subtle electronic flourishes like ""White Out"", ""The Hands"", and ""God
    Bless America"" into illegitimate Bastrd del Sol cut-and-pasting-- and all while
    failing miserably, save for one or two standouts per album.  Yes, somewhere in
    Joan of Arc's four-album career lies enough solid material to piece together
    one quality LP.  Tracks like ""Me (Plural)"" with Jen Wood, ""Who's Afraid of
    Elizabeth Taylor"", ""Me + America (or) The United Colors of the Gap"", and ""How
    Wheeling Feels"" will make the inevitable Jade Tree hits collection a purchase
    to consider.  So, taking into account Joan of Arc's inability to fill an
    entire album with intrigue, a posthumous EP seems potentially agreeable.</p><p>
    
    Until we learn that this is a wastebin of <i>The Gap</i> leftovers. Technically
    more diverse than anything else Joan of Arc has released, <i>How Can Any Thing
    So Little Be Any More</i> at times molests ears more brutally than ever before.
    One song, ""Most at Home in Motels"", succeeds as a brief, improved summation of
    the direction on <i>The Gap</i>.  Erratic acoustic guitars pick and slide over
    digital scribbles and potato-chip drumming.  A novice piano and insectoid noise
    flutter through the second half, and for a moment, Kinsella seems ahead of the
    curve.  Otherwise, the EP plummets into realms of inconceivably horrendous
    lyrics and fuck-off music.</p><p>
    
    ""Ne Mosquitos Pass"" offers delicate music overshadowed by a shit-blimp vocal
    performance.  Kinsella rambles lines like, ""Toilet brush and icebucket/ Where
    are you now/ How long is your hair/ There's a couch in the back of my work you
    can sleep on,"" then shouts, ""Fucking strangers feels better feels better
    fucking strangers,"" over and over before the climax: ""Big gay Mr. T knocked
    the fucking teeth out with a telephone!""  Someone should be reading the labels
    on their prescription bottles.</p><p>
    
    The short instrumental ""My Fight Is Necessary"" shows Kinsella flirting with
    <i>Metal Machine Music</i> drones, sliding whistles, and reversed guitar to
    no acceptable result.  A solitary guitar whimpers, tucks its tail between its
    legs, and tries to hide behind Kinsella's naked, saggy voice on ""My Cause Is
    Noble and Just"".  The sluggish, country-tinged ballad ""What If We Are Not
    After All, All Destined for Greatness"" has Kinsella dueting with some poetic
    barista guy and admitting to his recording practices: ""I'm singing this in my
    friend's kitchen.""  Thanks for the effort.</p><p>
    
    Worst of all are the trio of children's songs.  Not songs <i>for</i> children,
    mind you, but songs sung <i>by</i> children.  A lone toddler croons, unaccompanied,
    into a tape recorder on ""We Neither Hide Nor Seek"": ""I never wanted I never wanted
    to touch you... DADDY!... the way I wanted to feel to you.  I love the way of your
    daylight I love you sweetheart.""  This sounds illegal in 49 states.  The kid also
    pops up briefly on the next pointless instrumental before taking the mic with a
    little buddy on ""I'll Show You, I'll Show You All"".  The song opens with echoing
    emo (echmo?) repetition, then disappears to let the kids sing, ""I love you Jesus
    do do do do do"", a sentiment with which the Christian Coalition might begin to
    disagree.</p><p>
    
    Ol' INRI gets more props in the next track with the opening line of, ""Jesus
    really was so/ Goddam pretentious.""  Kinsella sounds jealous.  And relating
    to the topic of Mr. H. Christ, Kinsella mumbles, ""Blessed be we amateurs,""
    earlier in the EP.  After a silly career of bumbling art, that's a lost
    sermon-on-the-mount beatitude Kinsella can only begin to dream of.</p></div>"|4269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4269-how-can-any-thing-so-little-be-any-more-ep/|2.2|Brent DiCrescenzo

    Judge Rock: I don't know if that's legal or not, but I'm willing to allow it so
    I can get the hell out of here and have a drink.  The Court will now hear the
    arguments.  Style, make it snappy.</p><p>
    
    Style: Well, I'd like to draw your attention to Exhibit A, the album cover. The
    black-and-white photo of the band members playing in some anonymous barroom
    basement is really cool-looking.  One glance at that and you know you're in for
    quality hipster jazz-rock.</p><p>
    
    Substance:  That's true, Your Honor, but take into account that there's really
    nothing all that jazzy about this music-- unless you're one of those people who
    thinks that having a flugelhorn player in the band is ""jazzy""-- and what do you
    have?  It's not really false advertising, but it's close.</p><p>
    
    Style: Well, jazziness aside, they do look pretty hip.  Moving on from the
    artwork to the music, though, you'll find some fantastic nighttime sounds. It
    shares a certain affinity with latter-day mope-rockers like Tindersticks, but
    it isn't mopey all the time.  It's great music for enhancing the mood of a given
    room.  Can't you just picture people getting laid to ""The Last Good Day of the
    Year?""  And ""Jump in the River"" is a great gospel-inflected tune painted in
    shades of midnight blue.</p><p>
    
    Substance: Oh, give me a break.  You make it sound like something some
    disinterested music critic would write.  Truthfully, it's a decent song, and it
    sure is moody, but at its core, vocalist Liam McKahey isn't given much to sing.
    It's a cliched bit about a late night tryst.  The printed lyrics even feature
    the inane homonym, ""And so long may she reign/ (So long may she rain).""
    Songwriter Davey Ray Moor may be a passable multi-instrumentalist, but as a
    lyricist, he never veers from the beaten paths. ""Mesmer"" even uses the phrase,
    ""Where angels fear to tread!""</p><p>
    
    Judge Rock: Indeed, very poor judgment on Style's behalf.  Bryan Adams and the
    Spin Doctors even have songs with this phrase as the <i>title</i>, and I ruled
    in favor of Substance in both of those cases.</p><p>
    
    Substance: And as for the music, it's just bland acoustic rock that builds on
    a blueprint laid out by Scott Walker's first four albums.  It all blends nicely,
    but for me personally, it's proven very difficult to discern one song from
    another.  They're all decent enough on their own, but it's pretty indistinct
    stuff.  In its favor, there are some accomplished solos, but all the violins,
    guitars, pianos and basses ultimately just mosey along over loungy percussion.
    ""She Don't Hear Your Prayer"" is basically soft rock, opening with that most
    hackneyed of effects: the wind chime.</p><p>
    
    Style: But there <i>is</i> a song called ""Shades of Ruinous Blue.""  Any Pier
    One consultant will tell you that shades of ruinous blue are very fashionable
    this season.</p><p>
    
    Substance:  Hey, we're talking about me, here.</p><p>
    
    Judge Rock: Okay, I've heard enough.  Give me the album.  We'll take a 50 minute
    and 37 second break and I'll be back with my verdict.</p><p>
<i>[Later]</i></p><p>
    
    Bailiff: The honorable Judge Rock, all rise.</p><p>
    
    Judge Rock: Thank you, you may be seated.  I have decided for the defense.
    Substance is too important for Style to ever function at its maximum potential
    without it.  <i>Cousteau</i> may be a great album for the late-night hours,
    but I doubt I'd want to wake up with it.  Therefore, I'm ordering that Style
    never be more than the length of a given recording from Substance at all times
    from this point forward.  Any artist found in violation may be stripped of
    their dignity, and sentenced to life in obscurity.  The court is adjourned.</p></div>"|1638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1638-cousteau/|4.7|Joe Tangari

    jettisoned in 1864 at the end of the Civil War by a victorious President
    Lincoln.  It stands as one of the darkest chapters of our past, the shameful
    carrier of an enormous human price tag.  In school, my teachers never flinched
    in their descriptions of slavery, always making sure to cast it in the worst
    light possible, and depict it as an abhorrent mistake that never should have
    happened.  And rightly so.</p><p>
    
    However, my Northeastern, suburban public school education also approached
    the issue from a one-dimensional standpoint, failing to examine the
    modern-day social repercussions of the not-so-long-dead institution, and
    also failing to discuss slavery's worldwide past.  To us, it was a
    white-and-black thing, and a point of conflict between the North and South.
    But in reality, it always went way beyond that.  Slavery is as old as
    civilization, and human degradation has persisted in many forms around the
    globe.  Even today, in a world where we think so much has changed, there are
    individuals who trade in human beings, kidnapping children from developing
    nations and selling them covertly on a despairingly extensive international
    market.</p><p>
    
    In the US, we're barely three generations removed from our ""peculiar
    institution"" (as 19th Century Southern politicians were fond of calling it),
    and its legacy still echoes in the halls of government, schools and even
    day-to-day life.  Taking this into account, I can imagine that the issue is
    even more prescient in Brazil, where slavery was not abolished until May 13,
    1888. In fact, there are many in Brazil's elderly population whose now-deceased
    parents once lived in forced servitude.</p><p>
    
    His country's past with slavery is close to Caetano Veloso's mind on his most
    recent offering.  The title <i>Noites do Norte</i> (Northern Nights) is
    actually extracted from a passage by noted Brazilian abolitionist Joaquim
    Nabuco.  Nearly the entire first half of the album deals with the subject,
    before branching out into the general poetic musings on life in Brazil (and
    life in general) that have defined Veloso's past efforts.  The extremely
    helpful liner notes offer facts and history, as well as English translations
    of the Portuguese lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Foreign language recordings automatically lose some appeal to a lot of English
    speakers, but the vibrant music that Veloso and his large cast of collaborators
    create ought to put to rest any concerns we might have diving into it.  David
    Byrne's recent work owes a huge debt to guys like Veloso and any Byrne fan
    would do well to give this a good shot.  It's Veloso's most rock-oriented
    record yet, as well, which makes it a decent starting point for folks who are
    looking to grab a seat on the recent Tropicalia bandwagon.</p><p>
    
    Veloso sometimes backs off a bit from the traditional polyrhythms of his old
    work here, imbuing the opening ""Zera a Reza,"" and the cheeky tribute to
    Brazilian legend Raul Seixa, ""Rock 'n' Raul,"" with fairly straight rock
    beats.  The music layered on top, however, is full of traditional harmony,
    Portuguese guitars, and echoes of the traditional fado song style, imported
    from Portugal in the colonial era.  The lyrics are also peppered with
    Afro-Brazilian deities, Brazilian drinks and musical styles, and holdover
    terminology from the Yoruba that most of the country's slaves spoke.</p><p>
    
    ""Michelangelo Antonioni"" is a gorgeous tribute to the Italian director of
    such classic films as <i>Blow Up</i> and <i>Red Desert</i> (not to mention
    the bloated <i>Zabriskie Point</i>), with a short, meditative lyric surrounded
    by Veloso's beautiful, wordless tenor and a plaintive string arrangement.  The
    music is strikingly lonely, even absent the realization that the first three
    lines translate to ""Vision of silence/ Empty street corner/ Page with no
    sentence."" </p><p>
    
    The arrangements are universally effective vehicles for Veloso's songs; some
    are stripped but warm, while others are covered in a rich orchestral tapestry.
    His prodigiously talented son Moreno contributes an arrangement for ""13 de
    Maio,"" a song about the celebrations held to commemorate the abolition of
    slavery in Brazil by Princess Isabel during her brief regency.  The ebullient
    percussion and guitar parts convey a profound joy, leading nicely to the
    laid-back groove and choral vocals of the Jorge Ben-penned ""Zumbi,"" a tribute
    to a rebel slave leader who established an autonomous state of freed slaves
    in central Brazil in the 17th Century.  The song's haunting images of
    princesses shackled to ox carts in African port cities and ""bosses in between/
    Watching the harvest of white cotton/ Gathered by black hands"" ring just as
    loudly in the U.S. as they do in Brazil.</p><p>
    
    It's a shame that American record stores are so obsessed with categories and
    separation, because there are a lot of people who will never hear this simply
    by virtue of its placement in the international section.  Though past efforts
    like 1997's <i>Livro</i> are slightly stronger, this is still a record that
    absolutely deserves to be heard by all, from an artist whose long career has
    proven him neither a slave to expectations nor his humble background.</p></div>"|8427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8427-noites-do-norte/|8.1|Joe Tangari

That wussiness derives from
    the style of music he writes and performs, a sweet, polished, 60's-inflected
    brand of pop. His talent lies in his ability to mimic and synthesize the
    sounds of the Beatles, Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, et al, and to lay
    confident, memorable melodies over the syrupy blend.</p><p>
    
    If his name sounds familiar, there's probably a reason.  Falkner made a
    career out of semi-high-profile musical collaborations before his recent solo
    outings. As a member of Jellyfish, Falkner played second fiddle (but really
    just guitar) alongside drummer/vocalist Andy Sturmer. But despite their
    Genesis-esque setup, the band never attained ""Sussudio"" heights of glory,
    and Jason was once again the lone musician.  Sometime later, Jason joined the
    Grays. The band released one moderately successful album, but a long-term
    venture it was not to be.  Nevertheless, Falkner had established a reputation
    for arrangement and writing which would lead to his working with Air, ex-fine
    ex-Bangle Susannah Hoff, and Chris Cornell.</p><p>
    
    Falkner was picked up by Elektra, which he humorously dubbed Neglektra, but
    parted ways with the label after 1996's <i>Jason Falkner Presents Author
    Unknown</i>, and its Nigel Godrich-produced follow-up <i>Can You Still Feel</i>
    tanked.  Which brings us to the present: a twelve-track compilation of songs,
    both previously released and new to the world, that highlights Falkner's
    songwriting talent and skill with a four-track.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""She's Not the Enemy,"" happens to be the only song that wasn't
    recorded on the more rudimentary four-track format, but rather, on a 16-track.
    The extra tape space allows room for multiple guitar tracks, piano, goofy but
    great Moog keyboard lines, and layers of rich harmony. The song has a sort of
    new-wave Ocasek-meets-60's sugar-pop feel to it, and also stands as the album's
    most impressive showcasing of Falkner's skills as a multi-instrumentalist. All
    the parts are solidly performed-- most notably the simple but crisp,
    appropriate drumming.</p><p>
    
    ""She Goes to Bed"" slows the pace down, but delivers more lush chord
    progressions and smallpox-catchy vocals. The Beatles begin to exert obvious
    influence on the third track, ""His Train."" The Beatles, of course, do the
    Beatles better, but Falkner isn't at all bad. Nonetheless, you have to ask
    yourself if you have extra padding in your wallet for enjoyable but thoroughly
    derivative music.  Fortunately for Falkner, the next song could sway you
    towards, ""Yes, I do.""  ""Song for Her"" finds him delving deeper into acid-era
    Beatles and pulling it off alarmingly well, even coaxing a dead-on McCartney
    impression from his pipes.</p><p>
    
    ""Miracle Medicine"" is the only blazing rocker to speak of, comprised of equal
    parts the Who, bad early-80's rock, and Nirvana. Here, the vocals take a
    backseat to the frenzied, distorted, descending chords of the chorus and the
    propulsive drumming.  Things falter, though, on ""The Hard Way,"" which is
    derivative without the ""but really good"" part.  To make matters worse, the album
    sputters instead of roaring toward its conclusion.  Of the last six track
    tracks, only ""Hectified"" and ""I Go Astray"" hit their mark.  It's unfortunate
    considering the wonderful first half of the album.  Still, even with its
    handful of losers, <i>Necessity</i> still offers an impressive group of songs
    with a lot for pop fans to savor.  I wouldn't be surprised if Falkner finally
    got around to actually putting out a mind-blowingly great album some day.</p></div>"|2964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2964-necessity-the-four-track-years/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

Welcome to ""Uncle Matt's Happy Time!"" This is the place where we
    discuss animals, games, and indie rock for little kids... just like you! Our
    guest today is Billy! Billy is six years old. He likes kittens and playing
    with Legos. He thinks girls are gross, especially his big sister! Let's say
    hi to Billy!</p><p>
    
    What we're going to do today on ""Uncle Matt's Happy Time"" is show Billy some
    pictures and play Billy some music, to see what an average kid just like you
    has to say about it! First, let's show Billy a picture. What do you think of
    this picture, Billy?</p><p>
    
    ""It's scary. It looks like doctors. Doctors have needles! I want to go home!""</p><p>
    
    Ha! Billy is silly! Those aren't doctors-- they're the Danielson Famile!
    Sometimes they like to dress up as doctors! And if they do have needles, odds
    are, they're not filled with anything they're going to want to use on you!
    ""Famile"" is French for family! In France, people don't take showers, and they
    go pee-pee in the street. Gross!</p><p>
    
    The Danielson Famile like to make music together. Do we like music? Yes!
    Let's put on their new album, <i>Fetch the Compass, Kids</i>, and see what
    Billy thinks about it... and what you think about it!  <i>Fetch the Compass,
    Kids</i> was recorded by the band's friend Steve. Steve is a very naughty
    man, and is in a band called Shellac. Shellac sing songs about bad things.
    But, luckily, the Danielson Famile don't! Let's have a listen!</p><p>
    
    ""It's scary! It's going to hurt me! Mommy said I could go home when I want
    to! I want to go home!""</p><p>
    
    Ha! Don't be silly, Billy! The Danielson Famile won't hurt you! They're
    Pentecostal, which means that they like Jesus a lot! Jesus died for your
    sins, Billy. He was crucified and died. Do you think Jesus would want to
    hurt you? Of course not!</p><p>
    
    ""He doesn't sound like Jesus! He sounds like a mouse! Or a scary clown! He
    is going to hurt me! I want to go home!""</p><p>
    
    Ha! Don't be scared, Billy! The Danielson Famile is all about family. Why,
    they're probably a little bit like your family! Their family has quiet time!
    Does your family have quiet time? Why don't we read some of the Danielson
    Famile's lyrics from the song, ""We Don't Say Shut Up!"" The lyrics go, ""Quiet
    Time!!!/ My big mouth invites a beating."" Does that make you feel better,
    Billy?</p><p>
    
    ""I don't want the scary man to beat me! He's going to kill me! Mommy said I
    could go home whenever I want to! I'm scared! Let me go home! Please let me
    go!""</p><p>
    
    It's okay, Billy.  I understand that Danielson Famile can be kind of hard to
    take at times! Big brother Daniel's squeaky vocals, and the generally
    saccharine, over-the-top music are more reminiscent of the clown in Stephen
    King's <i>It</i> than any friendly clown at your friend's birthday parties.
    Stephen King wrote books with bad words, and he got hit by a car!</p><p>
    
    ""I don't want to get hit by a car! I don't want to listen to this! Let me
    go! Let me go!  Mommy said you have to let me go!""</p><p>
    
    Sorry, Billy, but your mommy isn't here! And Big Mean Mr. Jones is guarding
    the doors. Big Mean Mr. Jones has a big closet full of red-hot pointy things,
    and likes to eat children. You don't want to make Big Mean Mr. Jones angry,
    do you? Of course not! Danielson Famile is all about being happy! Why, it's
    kind of like the CD we played during last week's ""Happy Time,"" Of Montreal,
    except without the weird, complex song structures. In Montreal, the people
    wish they were French! Mega-gross!</p><p>
    
    ""This album makes me feel like scary little men are poking sharp things into
    my head and smiling! Let me go home! Let me go home!""</p><p>
    
    Stop crying, Billy! I had a cousin who liked to cry, and he died, Billy. He
    died like a dog. Luckily, the frightening sugar high at the beginning of this
    album can't be sustained! The Famile are at their best when they're busting
    out hyperactive, hyper-memorable pop hooks that stay lodged in your mind to
    remind you that God and family are good, and that saying ""shut up"" is bad! A
    Famile like this one only works when they're going full-blast, and parts of
    this album just seem bland and awkward. That makes us say ""yuck!""</p><p>
    
    ""I can't take it any more! Please please let me go! I want to go play in the
    street with the other boys! I don't want to die! I don't want to die!""</p><p>
    
    Awww... well, okay, Billy. We're going to let you go now! But just try to
    leave without having songs like ""Rallying the Dominos"" or ""Let Us A.B.C.""
    stuck in your head! You can leave the Famile, Billy, but the Famile won't
    leave you!</p><p>
    
    ""No! No! You're mean! My daddy is a lawyer! He's going to make you pay!""</p><p>
    
    Whoa, there, Billy! Don't forget Big Mean Mr. Jones! He sharpens his teeth
    with razor blades, and he loves the taste of little boy! All you can do,
    Billy, is try to remember that the Danielson Famile are oftentimes more
    annoying than they are scary. If you can just sit back and let yourself
    enjoy it, without being irked or creeped out, it's actually kind of fun!
    I know I'm having fun!  Are you having fun, Billy?  Billy?  Oh, Billy?</p></div>"|2166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2166-fetch-the-compass-kids/|6.8|Matt LeMay

    negative criticism, or any negativity for that matter. Second of all, I will
    tell you that I actually begin talking about this specific record in the
    fourth paragraph, because as usual, there is some expository material of
    possible entertainment and/or knowledge value to be gained first. Nothing to
    complain about now? Great, let's move on. Next, I'd like to give a shout-out
    to Japan. Ever notice how people say they'd like to ""give a shout-out"" to
    something, but they never really do it?  I'm following through: ""JAAPAAAAAANN!""
    Damn. Oh, Japan. Ohhhh, Japan! Sorry, I just haven't had enough. But you
    must understand. My love affair for Japan is just beginning to blossom.</p><p>
    My liaison began with Buffalo Daughter and the super-smooth quirk-funk of
    their exceptional second record, <i>New Rock</i>. Then I became more anxious
    to get myself acquainted with the Japanese-American music maker crowd. Cibo
    Matto's <i>Viva La Woman</i> took me a little while, but it became an
    eye-opening record in its own right; more recently, I fell in love with
    the high-pitched croon of Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino. Then I became a fan
    of the chirping vocals and shimmering sound pastiches of Takako Minekawa.</p><p>
    And finally, the Boredoms came along in my life and made me wonder how I ever
    listened to rock without them. I will sacrifice a vital appendage if necessary
    to see this band perform live once in my life. 1998's <i>Super Are</i> and
    2000's <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i> were and still are landmark records in
    fucked-up, psychedelic, gorgeous, dynamic trance-rock. I considered frontman
    eYe Yamatsuka a god among men for quite some time, at least while immersing
    myself in those albums. I always noticed the excellent musicianship of the
    rest of the group, but I don't think I gave it enough credit to the quality
    of the records, usually assuming that the mastery of craft was in Yamatsuka's
    hands.</p><p>
    Here's proof that at least part of the rest of the band had something to do
    with it. For those unfamiliar, OOIOO is a band featuring Yoshimi P-We,
    one-half of the drum section of the Boredoms. Along the way, bandmates and
    fellow Japanese women Kyoko, Maki and Yoshiko help her out on guitar, bass
    and drums, respectively. But Yoshimi is clearly the driving force, taking
    the production reins and performing most of the vocals and instruments.
    Their second and latest record, <i>Feather Float</i>, may not be a defining
    masterpiece, but I'll be damned if it doesn't make me a super happy guy. The
    Boredoms are unmitigated genius, which may include joy, but OOIOO are
    unmitigated joy, which needs not include genius.</p><p>
    See, according to the scientific and über-accurate <i>Pitchfork</i> ratings
    guide, I've already labeled Feather Float ""amazing,"" informing you that it
    ""will likely rank among [my] top three records of the year"" before I've barely
    said a word about it. This is all accurate as far as I can tell, although
    who knows what the hell those year-end list things are like even in
    <em>October</em>, let alone here in May. So allow me to explain, won't you? I
    could go with a moment-by-moment, track-by-track analysis, but the feeling
    of this record doesn't come through that kind of language. Instead, I'm going
    to say what I love about it.</p><p>
    I love the energy. OOIOO's brand of rhythmic psych-rock on <i>Feather Float</i>
    exudes definite soulful excitement. Yoshiko's drums rock the way Yoshimi's do
    in the Boredoms; panicked, frantic, at times tribal, but always steadily
    keeping the beat. The rhythms and activity of the music are nearly out of
    breath, but never rushing to catch up. Every instrument, natural or electronic,
    is used to drive the music forward. It's a sort of loose intensity; there's
    power and vigor, but no pressure.</p><p>
    I love the contrast. When there is music, there is energy, but sometimes
    there isn't music. This allows for the energy to rest and build again.
    Throughout the record, these moments of silence give way to birds chirping,
    crashing cymbals, and soft building drones, which all patiently await the
    next explosion of activity. <i>Feather Float</i> could not have been arranged
    differently and remained as effective as it is now.</p><p>
    I love the pure love of sound that is so obviously demonstrated on this
    recording. Phasing effects and electronic tones are used liberally, but the
    feeling remains organic and authentic. Sometimes a sound is repeated over
    and over again as we revel in its glory; sometimes it's cut short to make
    way for an even more glorious one.</p><p>
    I love the vocals. Yoshimi sings most of the vocals in OOIOO, with help from
    fellow guitarist Kyoko, and they have nothing to do with lyrics. When words
    are used, whether in English or Japanese, the language bears little relevance.
    They just add incalculably to the end result. The aforementioned energy
    translates into the vibrant, layered voices. The harmonies don't just soar,
    they create rhythms. Sometimes sharp intakes of breath and brief yelps
    punctuate the beat for emphasis. Sometimes the singers become so enthusiastic
    that it doesn't matter if they're out of tune, and we're eventually singing
    out of tune with them. When they are in tune, it's angelic and at times
    breathtaking. </p><p>
    I love the name, and the title. OOIOO-- simple syllables which seemingly
    emanate a sense of awe, or release. <i>Feather Float</i>-- fully
    unpretentious, with a liberating, carefree connotation.</p><p>
    I love <i>Feather Float</i>. It's a record that causes me to gush over great
    lengths. Hopefully by now I've given enough of the idea of how it sounds
    without ruining the surprises and the pleasant new feeling of hearing it for
    the first time. It currently stands on its own, not just as something to tide
    over Boredoms fans, but as something to hold in high regard in your collection,
    something even perhaps to introduce an uninitiated friend into the world it
    represents. And it makes me want to make my affair with Japan a full-on
    marriage. But we'll still need to get to know each other a little more before
    we set the date, honey. And where the devil will we have our honeymoon?</p></div>"|6013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6013-feather-float/|9.0|Spencer Owen

    Spells</i>, and the record is an hour long.  Rarely is a song less than four
    minutes long, and they often nearly reach the six-minute mark. One of these
    songs even begins with a minute of soft string-scratching effects on the
    guitar. Now, the Ex are from Amsterdam, and they seem punk enough, but
    according to everything I supposedly know about time measurement and how it
    corresponds to a punk song, these tracks are way too long to be punk songs.
    Is a Dutch minute equivalent to 2\xBD American minutes, maybe?  Can I get a
    foreign relations expert in here, please?</p><p>
    This fact clarifies that I'd be doing punk fans a disservice if I recommended
    <i>Dizzy Spells</i> to them.  Why, by the tenth second of inactivity or
    repetition past the norm, they'd simply hate me. Of course, they probably
    hate me anyway for making such offensive generalizations. You can't win in
    the world of entertaining music criticism, I say.  C'est la vie.  Maybe I'm
    questioning all this because, like any punk band with a rebellious,
    fuck-Disney attitude, the Ex seem like they want people to ask questions--
    questions likes: what are they so agitated about? Should we be agitated, too?
    How are their songs so long?  Don't they get bored playing them?</p><p>
    Oops. Silly me. I've been leaving a word and a hyphen out of my description
    of the Ex.  See, the Ex aren't really straight punk; they're ""art-punk.""
    Angular guitars, intellectually abstract (or abstractly intellectual?)
    lyrics, oddly clattering beats, and yes, six-minute songs are all thrown
    into the mix. The Ex seem to borrow more from Wire and the Talking Heads than
    the Ramones and the Stooges.  With every jagged, awkwardly phrased musical
    figure, you can visualize the band shoving their equipment just that much
    closer to the edge of Sanity Cliff.</p><p>
    The lyrics do indeed prove that the Ex are angry about something. When the
    band started out in the early 80's, their music was virtually packed with
    pro-socialist, ultra-liberal propaganda.  These days it's not so obvious, but
    apparently, they're still not fans of big business. Take ""Walt's Dizzyland,""
    for example: ""Mickey, Walt and Donald/ And goofy cousin Ronald/ They wanna
    swallow all your souls/ Like they've inked a pact."" And ""Karaoke Blackout""
    contains that all-too-popular topic for those rebellious kids, individuality
    and non-conformity: ""They should stop thinking for myself!""</p><p>
    But <i>Dizzy Spells</i> is good. Oh, it's damn good, all right. The Ex are
    experts at effectively jarring dissonance, but they're not just noisy, either;
    they're well versed in creating musical chaos. Granted, melody isn't too
    common, but when it does show up somewhere in the din, it's all the more
    welcoming. And with uber-engineer Steve Albini, the band is captured in their
    most raw, primitive form, with all imperfections exposed alongside the
    numerous perfections. Any studio gloss would have done this group an
    injustice.</p><p>
    Unpredictability is key, and one of the more pleasant surprises must be
    described (read: ruined) in order to prove my point:  on ""River,"" one of the
    many highlights here, softly played dissonant chords and a gentle, rolling
    snare carry the song's first half. The lyrics indicate change in mood and
    atmosphere: ""On your mark, take the plunge/ And face the next wave coming.""
    The first time those words are sung, the track suddenly jumps to aggressive,
    serrated riffs, with melody splayed out all akimbo, in a powerful uptempo
    cadence. The second time, it morphs into a truly combative punk rhythm, and
    the sentiment becomes determined and filled with desire: ""I wanna laugh and I
    want to love/ But not just love, that's not enough!""</p><p>
    The entirety of <i>Dizzy Spells</i> features enough gorgeously primitive
    twists like these to warrant an enthusiastic recommendation. These Dutch
    art-punks make truly exciting music, which is especially commendable when you
    consider they've been at it for so long. And the excitement is sustained so
    consistently over the hour-long running time that you'll almost begin to wish
    the six-minute songs were even longer. It's an hour of your life easily worth
    repeating.  You might even find a reason to be this agitated.  Hell, you
    might even find a reason to be Dutch.  They're that good.</p></div>"|2860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2860-dizzy-spells/|8.5|Spencer Owen

    from around the world send to me every day, I'm surprised at how many of you
    are asking, ""Brendan, why <i>Pitchfork?</i>""  Since this is my ""infamous sixth
    review,"" as they call it around here, I think I should take some time out to
    answer the question that's on all of your minds.  Contrary to what many of you
    have suggested, I didn't join up with <i>Pitchfork</i> to do high-quality work
    for a high-quality site.  Look at this article, for example.  So far, it's
    pure crap!  No substance at all!  There are even obvious lies!  Nope, I'm
    interested in <i>Pitchfork</i> for the quantity, not the quality.  Publishing
    four reviews every weekday is no small feat, and there's a certain hivelike
    quality to <i>Pitchfork</i> that enables this sort of efficiency.  I think I
    have a certain mindless, dronelike quality that complements the general
    <i>Pitchfork</i> ethic quite well.</p><p>
    
    It's no surprise, then, that we <i>Pitchfork</i> workers tend to enjoy (at
    least more so than the general public) the sort of music that's characterized
    as ""droning.""  There's something about a keyboardist leaning on one note for
    five minutes that reminds us of, oh, I dunno, the sound of record reviews
    being written.  So, before I'm reassigned to the Built to Spill Adoration
    Division (Sector 6-B, to us), I'd like to pay my respects to Philadelphia's
    master-droners Bardo Pond.</p><p>
    
    The Bardos, anchored by sibling guitarists John and Michael Gibbons, have
    been playing the fuzzed-out stuff of stoner dreams since the mid-90's, joining
    the frighteningly well-endowed Matador Records clan early on.  Although their
    flirtations with melody have produced absolutely heavenly music, as on their
    quasi-dream-pop masterpiece, 1997's <i>Lapsed</i>, they've always been allied
    first and foremost to experimentation, crushing distortion, and, of course,
    the drone.  Their new album, <i>Dilate</i>, follows the course they've already
    plotted, making a few distinct detours along the way.</p><p>
    
    While previous albums gave a studio sheen to the noise, <i>Dilate</i> has
    a looser, more spontaneous feel to it.  This allows a little more space to
    creep into the claustrophobia-inducing mix favored by the band.  Thus, we now
    get to hear slow-building numbers like the first track, ""Two Planes,"" which
    begins with a clean guitar accompanying multi-instrumentalist Isobel
    Sollenberger's violin.  Layers of distortion and rippling effects are gradually
    added until the song begins to sound like a truly monstrous dirge.  ""Inside,""
    another epic, propels itself with twangy, ramshackle picking, allowing the
    song to pick up some speed before it takes off into the stratosphere.</p><p>
    
    Along with this, there's also a newfound interest in acoustic guitars-- quite
    unexpected considering the band's usual effects-heavy treatments.  The
    acoustics often work their way under the churning sea of distortion, plinking
    away distinctly within the bleary turmoil of ""Aphasia.""  But just as often
    they're equal partners with the drones.  On ""Despite the Roar,"" haunting,
    heavily echoed tones bridge the gaps between deliberately spaced strums
    before both the acoustics and the electrics kick into a rhythm.  Another
    excellent, unconventional track, ""Favorite Uncle,"" proves that Sollenberger's
    brittle vocal melodies can survive apart from the sea of sound that usually
    surrounds them.  She begins accompanied only by two acoustics-- singing
    forlornly out from what sounds like the inside of an abandoned tin can--
    before the band crashes in.</p><p>
    
    Even within what seems to be familiar territory, the album's willingness to
    take risks can provide interesting new angles into the band's music.  ""Lb.,""
    for example, begins with a lumbering dinosaur-on-acid riff.  A few minutes
    into the song, most of the band falls out, and another plodding guitar figure
    enters.  However, drummer Ed Farnsworth and bassist Clint Takeda immediately
    thrust this into double-time, throwing an invigorating splash of bongwater in
    the face of the complacent listener.  While drones tend to become a bit
    predictable, there's an inherent instability in the music that keeps it vital
    most of the time.</p><p>
    
    Still, there's a druggy complacency that sometimes gets the better of them,
    allowing a menacing jam like the final track, ""Ganges,"" to go on too long.
    The album's adventurousness can also go a bit overboard in, as it does
    in ""Sunrise,"" which features backwards-echoing vocals and guitars that do
    little to help the song.  ""Swig"" also departs from the Bardo formula with
    none-too-interesting results, opting for an Eastern-sounding sitar simulation.
    With all of its experimental angles pulling in different directions,
    <i>Dilate</i> also experiences a lack of cohesion that didn't really factor
    into the band's previous albums.</p><p>
    
    While it isn't quite as glorious as <i>Lapsed</i>, <i>Dilate</i> does offer a
    good deal of interesting material-- certainly enough to keep a hive like ours
    happy.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go smear royal jelly on Schreiber's
    ass.</p></div>"|561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/561-dilate/|7.5|Brendan Reid

    Who's there?<br/>
    cLOUDDEAD.<br/>
    cLOUDDEAD who?</p><p>
    
    That's the question, but few have the same answer.  The group got the name
    from the punchline to the kind of nonsensical joke every kid sister tells.
    cLOUDDEAD (aka rappers Odd Nosdam, Why? and Dose One), are part of that
    tinderbox of web-board flamewars, the Anticon collective.  The appearance of
    a crew of white MCs and an album called <i>Music for the Advancement of
    Hip-Hop</i> was bound to stir controversy.  Were they ambitious backpackers
    or hyped-up marketeers?  Well, regardless of the beef between Sole and former
    Company Flow head El-P, or the larger battle about whether Anticon's projects
    are hip-hop at all, they're without a doubt a rising power.</p><p>
    
    cLOUDDEAD's first album, which collects the 10-inches they released from
    1998 to 2000, fits this picture perfectly.  ""apt.A"" greets with a warm,
    choral hum, clearly in the Boards of Canada neighborhood.  The silence is
    broken by a dull drum loop and spiral synths, a mix that serves as a prelude
    to Dose One's verse.  Too many heads can't get past his nasal delivery, which
    sounds like he's been boning too many thug harmonies.  Combine his chatter
    with the washed-out, repetitious flow of the music and the effect can be
    narcotic.  In a recent interview, Dose One was quoted saying the album was
    ""gonna be a banger,"" but the mastering's too dirty for any sound to rattle
    speakers.  Considering the album was made on a Dr. Sample, a Radio Shack mic
    and an eight-track, though, the overall effect is pretty fresh.</p><p>
    
    Dose One and Why? drop prose completely devoid of traditional hip-hop imagery.
    Their verses are scrapbook pages of memories and observations, packed dense
    with adjectives and short on linking phrases.  Sometimes their impressionist
    flourishes are simply beautiful, like, ""I wonder what my mother looked like
    pregnant/ I've classified water damage as art/ Ruining things/ Trilobyte out
    on the town/ Painting things in accordance with my weird ordinance/ My style
    is glass cutter/ Delicate/ Intense/ Shooting out the moonlights with my
    tongue depression in a vacuum.""  Other times, their poetical brushes overlap
    and muddy the canvas.  Countless in-group references seem the product of
    late-night blunted gatherings, until you catch the lyrics written out in the
    liner notes.  If these words are pre-written, and not freestyle, then at times
    these guys are trying too hard to be all artfully abstract.</p><p>
    
    cLOUDDEAD's 74 minutes bring surprises.  The most startling is the 11-minute
    suite ""Jimmy Breeze,"" which begins with a stupid skit and rapid-fire conga
    pattering, burbles up an 8-bit Nintendo sample, and then features lyrical
    protocol on how to survive a four-story fall.  The vocals fade, a deep
    bassline drifts in, and sampled drum fills roll out a jam.  Just as you
    expect DJ Shadow to appear, wondering ""What <i>does</i> my soul look like?,""
    the MCs sing out a gospel groove, voices straining for that high pitch.  The
    second track of the suite, an elegy for a friend who killed himself in art
    school, blazes with regret, jaded irony and critique: ""We seem to be sinking
    deeper into a vat of honey glaze/ Shall we live or shall we laminate ourselves
    into a standard appetizing position?/ At school this quarter/ All the supply
    lists call for Reynold's wrap and contact paper.../ Am I here to start a dead
    butterfly collection?/ But friends: We've no longer a need for glitzy masters/
    Who paint gold-leaf holy babies in the backs of cathedrals.""  Waves of organ
    reverence signal the end of the piece.</p><p>
    
    To accuse these moments of being interludes between the vocal tracks is to
    miss the point.  Hazy shoegazed ambience and instrumentals full of slow,
    dusty beats comprise a huge portion of this album.  Soulful rhythms will
    disappear entirely in the middle of a track, only to be replaced by
    monk-like chanting or funky breaks.  Every time you try and grasp what's
    going on, the focal point shifts, a testament to cLOUDDEAD's nebulous
    aesthetic.  Yet the crucial hip-hop signifiers are present: verse trading,
    shout-outs, a personal vocabulary full of slang hipsterisms.  If you're in
    the mood to be on some experimental shit, check this out. Just don't jump on
    the played-out debate and try to define the group by what they're not.
    Otherwise, they've played the joke on you.</p></div>"|1517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1517-clouddead/|8.0|Christopher Dare

At least that seems to be the
    case with Alejandro Escovedo.  He's been around for ages now, first appearing
    with mid-70s Bay Area punks the Nuns.  In 1981, he made the move to Austin,
    Texas with his band Rank and File, whose <i>Sundown</i> album was vastly ahead
    of the rockabilly-punk curve.  And he's been a stalwart on the scene ever
    since, playing with True Believers and Buick MacKane, in addition to recording
    his own solo work.</p><p>
    His fifth solo effort finds him in territory several miles removed from his
    rough and tumble beginnings, and only once reaching for straight-up rock n'
    roll.  (The rock number, a rollicking, curiously Georgia Satellites-ish
    ""Castanets"" guests Superchunk's John Wurster and Mac MacCaughan, though you'd
    never know it without reading the credits.)  Instead, he spends time exploring
    the peaks and valleys of melody and rich arrangements, creating the most
    subtle, textured album of his career.</p><p>
    Escovedo taps some high-powered guests to achieve this more ambitious sound,
    including ex-Whiskeytown frontman Ryan Adams on backing vocals, Buick MacKane's
    Joe Eddy Hines and ex-Let's Active frontman Mitch Easter on guitar, session
    drummer Hector Muñoz, the Squirrel Nut Zippers' Chris Phillips on percussion,
    and some guy named Cornbread on bass.  But without a doubt, the two guest
    musicians who lend the most to <i>A Man Under the Influence</i> are Brian
    Standefer and Eric Heywood.  Standefer's cello adds immense depth and color
    to all but one song here, serving as an effective countermelodic foil for
    Escovedo's steady tenor.  For his part, Heywood (who has played with Richard
    Buckner, Freakwater, the Jayhawks, and Son Volt, to name just a few) provides
    the gorgeous steel guitar lines that brighten the corners of the swooning
    ballads that fill the bulk of the record.</p><p>
    The record opens with two songs Escovedo penned for the travelling play ""By
    the Hand of the Father.""  ""Wave"" begins with tense strumming over droning
    cello and double bass.  Escovedo's voice hovers over the proceedings,
    declaiming, ""Wave goodbye, everybody waves goodbye,"" before the whole band
    slips into an easy groove and all tension is released.  ""Rosalie"" follows,
    reminiscent of <i>Key Lime Pie</i>-era Camper Van Beethoven, a frequent
    comparison point for the mid-tempo numbers, as Escovedo and David Lowery
    have similar melodic styles.</p><p>
    The album's two high points come during two of those mid-tempo numbers,
    ""Rhapsody"" and ""Velvet Guitar,"" both of which offer a look at Escovedo's
    passion for music.  Our social conditioning and all the Mexican Day of the
    Dead imagery in the artwork automatically suggest alcohol to us when we hear
    the album title, but it's these two songs that make it clear that Escovedo
    is primarily under the influence of his love for music.  ""Rhapsody"" finds
    him musing, ""If the melody escapes me/ I will stumble upon it soon/ If it's
    not a rhapsody/ Then it'll just have to do."" ""Velvet Guitar"" is just flat-out
    joyful, and features five guys playing electric guitar.  Five guys!  That's a
    lot of guitar.  Thankfully, Chris Stamey's clear production keeps them all
    in their respective places, avoiding a sloppy mess.</p><p>
    Of the slowest tracks here, ""Wedding Day"" is the best, with vocalist Lynn
    Blakey harmonizing with Escovedo over Standefer's sonorous cello and subtle
    harmonium.  It's pretty without totally sacrificing its edge, as is ""Follow
    You Down,"" a melancholy acoustic ballad swimming in David Perales' violin
    overdubs.</p><p>
    On the whole, <i>A Man Under the Influence</i> doesn't offer much to
    criticize; it's well-played, well-written, solid music from a certified
    veteran.  Very occasionally, the band gets to a point where too many people
    are playing, and none are doing anything that spectacular.  But this is a
    weak complaint, and one that hardly bares mentioning.  In truth, <i>A Man
    Under the Influence</i> feels like the culmination of a great career. And
    Escovedo is one old cowpunk we should hope doesn't go out to pasture any
    time soon.</p></div>"|2830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2830-a-man-under-the-influence/|8.3|Joe Tangari

U.S. Maple feels like a singular entity.
    U.S. Maple, a contradiction in and of itself, and a contradiction in sound,
    chaotic and disorganized in order to form a sort of unstructured structure,
    creating beauty and unpredictability out of fucked-up randomness.  It sounds
    weird. It twists around an idea without warning and transforms into another
    then snaps back to the first. It rambles, seemingly aimlessly at first glance,
    but by the end, everything has taken its natural course, and nothing was truly
    out of place.</p><p>
    
    U.S. Maple doesn't sound like anything else, except U.S. Maple. The singer
    part of U.S. Maple moans its alien lyrics, using virtually no dynamic,
    slurring its words together to create new ones, gasping for breath. The
    guitar and bass part creates spontaneous riffs, at once sounding classic
    like something you know you've heard and sounding as if they're fucking it
    up, playing upside down with their eyes closed and their fingers bent
    backwards. The rhythm part is always on the edge.</p><p>
    
    U.S. Maple has released three albums before <i>Acre Thrills</i>, and this
    fourth effort represents a venture into actual melody, at least more so than
    they've attempted before. Traditional chord progressions are sometimes
    utilized, and occasionally, every instrument combines to create a full
    melody, but then the guitar neck starts to bend again or the bassist hits a
    wrong note or the cymbals fall off and it's all according to plan. The drums
    create much more of a rhythmic base than usual, but still sound as if the
    set's at the breaking point and could collapse at any minute. It creates an
    unpredictability missing in post-rock these days.</p><p>
    
    Which brings me to another point, a genre. What is U.S. Maple, post-rock?
    Yes, perhaps in the strictest, most unique sense, as guitars that might have
    been used to create powerful, cohesive riffs are now used to turn those
    inside out, and drums that might have been used to pound out booming fills
    are now sped up and slowed down to highlight all the wrong moments, and
    there's no distortion, and the clean sound of the guitars becomes dirtied
    only by the inky fingers of the players. But it all comes together in
    something that works, and it's constantly new even after your twentieth
    listen.  It's a malfunctioning machine that suddenly becomes aware of its
    existence. Something mechanical that breathes, creating random organic
    sequences of sound out of organic instruments based on a pre-planned,
    pre-programmed system meant to bend every notion of traditional guitar music
    out of shape.</p><p>
    
    ""Total Fruit Warning"" ends with a cat's purr, but recorded in such a way
    that it sounds like an unworldly beast's filtered breathing, either dying or
    revitalizing itself, and that singular breathtaking moment represents the
    music of this entity as a whole.  All this contradiction, all this paradox,
    it all feels natural.  And in the end, U.S. Maple have finally reached
    brilliance with <i>Acre Thrills</i>, a gorgeously dangerous combination of

    nearing the point where you can create any sound you could ever imagine.
    From the evidence on Otto Von Schirach's <i>8000 B.C.</i>, this young man
    from Miami can imagine many, many sounds, and he knows how to translate
    what he hears in his head into 1s and 0s.</p><p>
    In terms of the diversity of sounds produced, <i>8000 B.C.</i> is an
    impressive display of programming skill.  But then, so was Linux, and yet
    I've never felt inclined to pour over the code. Perhaps some endeavors are
    so entwined with technical mastery that only technical masters can truly
    appreciate it. From where I sit, <i>8000 B.C.</i> feels like that kind of
    record. This is dense, frenetic IDM for those obsessed with nothing so much
    as change.</p><p>
    I'm not exaggerating when I say that a single track here might contain more
    than 100 individual patches, each of which is manipulated in a number of ways.
    Obviously, when you're dealing with these kinds of numbers, you're not going
    to have much open space left over. And master tape saturation seems to be one
    of the goals of <i>8000 B.C.</i> This isn't a bad thing in itself, but what's
    missing for me is any sense of a relationship between the various elements.
    They seem so interchangeable, like a single Cubase track could be cut and
    pasted from any one of these pieces into another and the result would be the
    same.</p><p>
    Half these tracks are nearly indistinguishable from one another, crammed
    with every possible permutation of buzz, click, thwack and blurp. And these
    I just have to let slide by, occasionally pricking up my ears when I hear an
    interesting rhythmic combination amidst the chaos.</p><p>
    But there are a handful of interesting spots. ""Schemotropolis Mirage"" reminds
    me of the Two Lone Swordsman's take on electro, taking the futurist genre that
    outpaced the technology of its time and yanking it into the 21st century. And
    it wisely leaves plenty of breathing room in between robotic drum hits, and
    adds eerie, almost RZA-like synthesized strings to actually create a mood.
    ""No Wood"" follows with the most ambient mood on <i>8000 B.C.</i>, an
    interesting slice of musique concrète that effectively suggests uneasiness
    without resorting to annoyance.  Beyond that, Otto Von Schirach has crafted
    a lot of technically sophisticated music that strikes me as aesthetically cold
    and lifeless.  Sure, it's a computer world, but where's the computer love?</p></div>"|8494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8494-8000-bc/|5.2|Mark Richard-San

    four-piece Seafood before.  It probably wasn't from their cover of ""Levitate
    Me"" on Invisible Records' obscure Pixies tribute disc.  Nor was I likely to
    have noticed their chart activity, which barely cracked the top 100, maxing
    out in the low-to-mid 90's.  Could it have been at that sweaty, word-of-mouth
    London gig back in 1997, around the time when they first splashed on the scene?
    Unlikely, since I've never been out of America.  Maybe I was wrong.  Perhaps I
    hadn't heard their name before; perhaps, I'd just heard their music many years
    ago when it was being released under their variety of pseudonyms: Sonic Youth,
    Pavement, Sebadoh, Dinosaur Jr.</p><p>
    
    Actually, I'm just playin'.  (Word.)  Certainly, I was familiar with this
    English quartet from the barrels of ink that have been poured for them in
    the British music rags.  The attention they're getting is verging dangerously
    on ""hype.""  Since they're on the Boston-based indie Big Wheel Recreation (and
    prior to that, the underachieving Fierce Panda label), Seafood is likely
    receiving this comprehensive coverage on their own merits, rather than being
    run through the corporate rock marketing machine with its army of sleazy,
    bribe-happy footsoldier-promoters.  The band's debut full-length, <i>Surviving
    the Quiet</i>, confirms this hypothesis, but strangely.</p><p>
    
    Seafood is a band out of time, born too late-- more suited to a movement
    an ocean away and a decade removed than any sort of shared attitude with
    their contemporary countrymen.  They give Britpop a wide berth and a wary
    eye, and instead favor the good old American guitar band sound.  They
    sound like a group who, as kids, first learned to play their instruments
    to Pavement CDs instead of Beatles records.  (Man, I bet that makes Malkmus
    feel <i>really</i> old).  Brits enamored of American rock pioneers is
    nothing new; it's a tradition as old as popular rock music itself.  But think
    back-- some good stuff has come out of that national obsession.</p><p>
    
    ""Blech,"" you're saying. ""Why do I want to listen to rehashed, second-rate
    wannabes?""  Wait, friend.  The good news is that Seafood isn't half-bad
    at their unabashed, on-the-sleeves, tribute band routine.  When was the last
    time you really, honest-Abe enjoyed a Dinosaur Jr album instead of just
    believing you were supposed to?  Better yet, when was the last time you made
    some sort of Grumpy Gramps statement like ""[mumble mumble] just don't [mumble]
    like they used to?""  Seafood are part voodoo alchemist and part doppelganger,
    resurrecting not only the style of our favorite dead and washed-up pre-grunge
    college radio giants, but also, in part, their substance.</p><p>
    
    ""Belt"" is an impressive use of dynamic range, with the now-familiar-to-all
    subdued/explosive technique.  ""Guntrip"" possesses a swirling, noisy aggression,
    but with a healthy, cathartic undertone. Kind of like therapy, as opposed to
    rage.  Singles like ""Easy Path"" and ""This is Not an Exit"" are dead-on radio
    whores that will stick in the heads of millions like peanut butter-flavored
    taffy.  Of course, Seafood have their softer side, too-- evidenced by gentle
    nods to Nashville in the slide guitar-rich ""Dear Leap the Ride"" and the folky,
    melodic ""Beware Design,"" intimately sung by drummer Caroline Banks.</p><p>
<i>Surviving the Quiet</i> won't win album of the year; it will just win fans.
    It won't influence others; it will only preserve its own influences,
    uncorrupted.  Seafood is the kind of band that, in a small but significant
    way, renews hope.  They make you feel like the music you used to enjoy is
    still being made by someone who loved it just as much as you did.</p></div>"|7043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7043-surviving-the-quiet/|7.0|John Dark

    special way: on the Patented Personal Performance Listener Fantasy Scale.
    Basically, if an album, or even a particular song on it, can inspire me to
    fantasize myself performing it, it is automatically awesome.  If the fantasy
    involves singing the song as a kiss-off to my high school (which I graduated
    from over a half-decade ago) and the people in it, then I know that, while
    it's still an awesome song, its shelf-life is short, as high school fantasies
    are usually only good for a quick, angry masturbation session.  If the fantasy
    takes place in the present day, with me as a band member in a club I'm
    familiar with, then I know the song has staying power, because that fantasy
    still has a chance of coming true.</p><p>
    
    One of the first song-fantasies I had that didn't involve those cheerleaders
    who now worshipped me was with Firewater's ""I Still Love You, Judas,"" off
    their last record, <i>The Ponzi Scheme</i>.  That daydream involved a rehearsal
    space, a recording studio, and accomplished backing musicians who were very
    impressed by my raw, yet focused, musical talents.  The songs just poured out
    of me-- the drama burned a hole in my chest and climbed out, and bile poured
    out of my eyes like tears.  I was a brilliant, untapped suburban prodigy.
    And my Judas would want me back.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>The Ponzi Scheme</i> was pretty good, but none of the other
    songs put me in a state of ecstasy like ""Judas.""  What was so good about it?
    Well, there were the slow-build verses.  There were the phlegmy guitar hooks.
    There was Tod A.'s prison laundry spoon-shiv pipes.  And there was that
    chorus.  My God, that chorus.  So huge, it was.  Transcendence as a
    liquor-soaked biblical-sized ""fuck you.""</p><p>
    
    So how could Firewater make me like their new album?  Well, they could just
    take the elements that made ""I Still Love You, Judas"" my bloody-toothed grin
    of a fantasy, and reassemble them ten times.  Did they do that?  Well, eight
    times.  And that's more then I could have hoped for.  Each one of the first
    eight tracks on <i>Psychopharmacology</i> is a pureblood home run; the title
    song rides in on the keyboard riff from Three Dog Night's ""One,"" and rides
    out on a cloud of crushed prescription pills; ""Car Crash Collaborator"" looks
    at the world through the eyes of Edward Norton's <i>Fight Club</i> character
    if he'd had a phalanx of bitchin' horns backing him up; and ""Get Out of My
    Head"" makes me the premier rock star of my inner world.</p><p>
    
    What's weird about my ""Get Out of My Head"" fantasy, though, is that I imagine
    myself fronting a band featuring my brother on lead guitar and my sister on
    keyboards.  A family-oriented rock star fantasy is something I've never
    had before, yet in this album's case, it seems strangely appropriate.
    <i>Psychopharmacology</i> has largely abandoned the exotic forays into
    Eastern European traditionalism that characterized the first two Firewater
    efforts, and to good effect.  This record brings everything home that has
    ever made this band any good: (1) The big, poppy choruses; (2) Fabulous
    melodrama; and (3) A sense of family.  That's right, family.  This band had
    previously been a rag-tag collection of Tod A. collaborators, hanging
    out and helping him achieve his musical vision.  On <i>Psychopharmacology</i>,
    however, for the first time, there is a real, solid Firewater lineup, where
    everyone is comfortable.  And it feels that way.  Just like the way I feel
    with my siblings.</p><p>
    
    For staking out new ground on my Patented Personal Performance Listener
    Fantasy Scale, this record gets mucho points and praise.  You may not hear a
    better pop/rock release this month.  And you definitely won't find one that
    will make you want to play make-believe more.  Thanks for your time.  Now,
    I've got some serious pretending to get to.</p></div>"|3070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3070-psychopharmacology/|8.6|Jonny Pietin

    involuntarily, like a musical doctor's mallet to your mind's knee.  Ha,
    that's terrible!  But, see, that's just it.  A great album should have you
    grasping for horrible metaphors that come nowhere close to describing that
    ineffable whatever that makes good music so much more than just casual
    entertainment or pleasant background.  Yes, the really good ones make you
    ask, ""What the fuck?"" with conviction.  They extort feelings of reverence,
    awe, and respect from you.</p><p>
    No doubt, you've heard that saying about the Velvet Underground-- you know,
    the one that claims that, though next to no one actually heard their debut
    album when it came out, everyone who did went out and started a band of their
    own. I'd like to be able to say something similar about Unwound, but strangely
    enough, it's to their credit that I can't.  They do have the obscurity thing
    in common, though I suspect that Unwound sells a hell of a lot more albums
    than the Velvet Underground did in the Factory days. Still, while anyone with
    a stringed instrument and opposable thumbs could have taken a respectable stab
    at emulating the Velvet Underground's brand of frenzied noise, the same cannot
    be said for Unwound.</p><p>
    Unwound is rock and roll, but only loosely speaking.  It's often very
    aggressive with Justin Trosper belting out fractured lyrics like a napalmed
    banshee.  But their music is so much more sophisticated, stranger and original
    than that of their contemporaries that it wouldn't be far from the truth to
    say they've written their own vocabulary and deployed a new syntax in this
    otherwise staid genre. Drawing inspiration from elements as disparate as
    Ornette Coleman's harmolodics, the compositions of Bela Bartók, rock and roll
    in general, and all points in between, Unwound have managed to rarely repeat
    themselves and never disappoint.</p><p>
    In many respects, <i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i> is the band's most ambitious,
    sweeping, and difficult outing yet. First, there's the sheer length (an hour
    and fourteen minutes), and then there's the format (two video-enhanced discs).
    Yet, for its epic length, there are only fourteen songs on this album, which
    means there's some really, <i>really</i> long tracks here. And not only long,
    but epic in the ""Kashmir"" sense.  And within those songs, there's enough going
    on to keep even the most attention deficit disordered among us intrigued.</p><p>
    Take ""Terminus,"" for instance, which consists of three distinct segments.  The
    first is a 3\xBD minute-long, maraca-laced, frenetically percussive song unto
    itself, rife with great rhythmic interplay between Justin Trosper's guitar
    and Vern Rumsey's thunderous bass.  The lyrics could have been plucked from
    one of Gollum's riddles in <i>The Hobbit</i>: ""Break me I'm not broke/ Take me
    I'm not took/ Cake me I'm not cooked/ Fake me I'm not fucked/ Wake me I'm
    awake/ Shake me I'm a jerk/ Wash me I'm a lake/ Make me I'm a crook.""  And
    there's a lot more where that came from. The song then gets plucky, quieter,
    and more tense. A phrase repeats itself with just a hint of cello and some
    Rhodes accompaniment.  With every repetition the cello grows louder until it
    overtakes the guitar, drums, and bass completely. A psychotic string interlude
    follows, and without warning, the cello cuts out completely, signaling the
    beginning of section three, a pretty tune with a ghostly Rhodes melody and
    two wiry, intertwined guitars parts.</p><p>
    If you're looking for another installment of <i>The Future of What</i>, or a
    return to <i>New Plastic</i>-era Unwound, you will be sorely disappointed. Let
    it go. You'd be doing yourself a heinous disservice to dismiss these songs for
    not reprising the Unwound of old; there's so much in the latest version of the
    band to be excited about. ""Treachery"" begins with a zany, Eno-ish synth intro
    which perfectly sets up the strangely 60's pop-sounding verse.  From a
    production standpoint-- if not also from a songwriting one-- Trosper was
    inspired by Woodstock-era psychedelia, and this song is one of many moments
    in which that's distinctly recognizable.  The band shifts keys between the
    verse and the chorus, and the keyboard is brought back for the song's
    infectiously sing-alongy ending.</p><p>
    In the years that elapsed between <i>Challenge for a Civilized Society</i> and
    their latest, the band pieced together a home studio in order to emancipate
    themselves from the time and cost constraints of professional studio work.
    They also decided to step up in a hands-on producer capacity, though still
    keeping studio wizard Steve Fisk around for his expertise.  Ex-drummer Brandt
    Sandeno and Quasi drummer Janet Weiss add keyboards and vocals, respectively.
    But apart from bringing in the Pacific Northwest all-stars, having a studio of
    their own has seemingly afforded Unwound unlimited time to see every idea out
    to its end. Unfettered by the usual studio pressures, the band packed much
    more instrumentation than usual into the songs.</p><p>
<i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i> is much too massive and sprawling an album to
    discuss track by track.  There aren't really any bubbly or anthemic songs
    (such as <i>Fake Train</i>'s ""Dragnalus"") or anything of the throat-shredding
    screams Trosper is well-known for (like on <i>The Future of What</i>'s ""Here
    Come the Dogs"").  The length of the album is somewhat mind-numbing, as is the
    relatively slow tempo of most of the songs.  But any loss in kinetic energy
    is more than made up for by the august musicality of the songs, as well as the
    sort of dream logic that pervades the album from beginning to end, effected
    with surreal vocal effects and keyboard atmospherics.  The funny but
    disconcerting animated piece by Zak Margolis (aka Drowning Boy) and the video
    short by Slater Bradley are great but, ultimately, just the icing on an
    incredible album.</p><p>
    To be truthful, my first listen to <i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i> was a bit
    difficult; I wasn't even particularly sure that I liked it.  I haven't been
    able to oust it from the stereo since.  I'm convinced that, if you've been
    following this band's development, the initial bewildered expression on your
    face will give way to total enchantment, and this new, boldly different
    Unwound album will have you in its grip for months to come.</p></div>"|8365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8365-leaves-turn-inside-you/|9.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    Jelly's EP collection determined that he was too cool for the job. And I have
    to agree. The guy gets sent demo recordings from Icelandic bands seeking his
    guidance/approval on material for their forthcoming albums. Rumor has it that
    Stephen Frears consulted him about what vinyl should be prominently displayed
    during <i>High Fidelity</i>.  He's too cool to even wear vintage RayBan Aviator
    shades!  Suffice to say, he's too good for this.</p><p>
    
    So <i>Lemonjelly.ky</i> was passed to me-- apparently because my cool-to-nerd
    ratio needs major improving. Though I haven't yet got what it takes to carry
    off designer stay-press suits, I feel comfortable in my facsimile RayBan
    Aviators. But even <i>I'm</i> too cool for the lurid banality of this record.</p><p>
    
    This compilation of three EPs' worth of downtempo ditties aims for the same
    market that scarfed up The Beta Band's <i>Three EPs</i> disc, but the
    similarities swiftly end there.  The packaging is lush, deluxe and probably
    shortlisted for a graphic design award, yet <i>Lemonjelly.ky</i>'s nine
    tracks consist largely of samples from atrocious Nana Mouskouri songs and
    soundclips nipped from 100 Strings' mood music albums.  What binds these
    samples together is a series of predicable hip-hop beats and root-note
    basslines. In the UK, Lemon Jelly are probably pin-ups for a certain type
    of elitist freshman who considers himself ever-so superior for conspicuously
    enjoying this stuff.</p><p>
    
    By arranging <i>Lemonjelly.ky</i> in chronological order, we can at least
    appreciate that by July 2000's <i>The Midnight</i> EP, it had at last occurred
    to the duo of Fred Deakin and Nick Franglin that splicing Bert Kaempfert with
    drum machine presets wasn't going to get them the St. Tropez mansion they'd
    been promising themselves since <i>The Bath</i> EP was released in August 1998.
    I get all mangled up inside about <i>Lemonjelly.ky</i> as a whole, but it's
    <i>The Bath</i> EP that gets me frayed. ""Nervous Tension"" samples a relaxation
    tape monologue which, unironically, has the opposite effect on my well-being.
    The only person who might be truly thrilled with ""A Tune for Jack"" is Jack
    himself-- the rest of us can live without hearing Johnny Pearson's Sounds
    Orchestral version of ""Wichita Lineman"" mixed with the hypothetical beats
    of the Captain &amp; Tennille's deck-shoe shuffling version of Young MC's ""Bust
    a Move"".</p><p>
    
    ""The Stauton Lick"" heads back into instructional tape land for a lesson in
    basic folk guitar techniques, and ends up sounding like a 14-year old imagining
    Fairport Convention covering New Order's ""All the Way"". ""His Majesty King Raam""
    is the sick fantasy of two thirty-something Brits-- a kindergarten tale broadcast
    on the BBC's <i>Jackanory</i> program enhanced with Henry Mancini's ""Days of
    Wine and Roses"".</p><p>
    
    After these trite and scoffing appropriations of bad taste, the <i>Midnight</i>
    EP seriously engages.  Here, Lemon Jelly have gotten beyond novelty value and
    begin to layer elements, and to distill some palpable beauty from their thrift
    store sources. Thus, ""Kneel Before Your God"" threads folk guitar lines with
    delicate turntablism and seraphic synth lines; ""Page One"" is skittering,
    piano-driven, and club-ready.  And the guys display hitherto unexpected
    restraint during ""Come"", in which they refrain from lubricated smut in favor
    of a sparse, harmonica-led treat. It's almost as though the schoolboy graphic
    design team within the duo has been partially defeated by their adult musician
    personas.  But the rout is merely an incipient one; this more mature Lemon
    Jelly is far from being a confirmed victory for subtle moderation.</p><p>
    
    Because the three tracks that comprise the <i>Midnight</i> EP rely far less
    on snickering, snobby kitsch, we can hope that Lemon Jelly will eschew juvenile
    mockery and perfect their technique. Only then will Deakin and Franglin
    overcome the tossed-off vapidity of <i>Lemonjelly.ky</i> and take their place
    with chill-out's recent masters.  Of course, if the band choose to further
    investigate bad taste, they'd better consult WFMU's outsider music expert
    Irwin Chusid, and study Stock, Hausen &amp; Walkman's considerably cooler <i>Organ
    Transplants</i> series.</p></div>"|4727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4727-lemonjellyky/|4.2|Paul Cooper

Children, tucked

    post-<i>Mag Earwhig!</i> Guided by Voices record.</p><p>
    Perhaps that isn't entirely accurate. Robert Pollard has always pointed out
    that, for the most part, people in Dayton couldn't give two shits about him or
    his band. Furthermore, it doesn't seem all that likely that the children of

    seams with indelible hooks. It does not feature hastily fingered, partially
    tonal, and obviously inebriated guitar solos.  It is, however, a solid,
    riff-driven rock record that may disappoint those still awaiting <i>Bee
    Thousand II</i>, but which offers plenty of treats for those who are willing
    to approach it with open ears.</p><p>
    Like its predecessor, the vastly disappointing <i>Do the Collapse</i>,
    <i>Isolation Drills</i> is a fully produced record, with Beck, Foo Fighters
    and Elliott Smith producer (and Reverbaholics Anonymous member) Rob Schnapf
    twiddling the knobs. But whereas Ocasek's production covered up inherently
    weak songs with layer after layer of extraneous studio garbage, Schnapf's
    production never interferes. Guitars crunch, drums crash, bass rumbles, and
    Robert Pollard's vocals resonate with that oh-so-adorable faux-British accent.
    There are occasional touches of backwards guitar, strings, and a few seconds
    of Elliott Smith tapping away on his organ, but these additional flourishes
    always remain sonically distinct, preventing <i>Isolation Drills</i> from
    succumbing to the kind of sloppy sonic stew that marred <i>Do the Collapse</i>.</p><p>
    While the production has certainly changed since past efforts, it's the
    character of the songs themselves that mark the biggest difference between
    this album and the band's back catalog. Pollard flirted with arena rock
    swagger on <i>Mag Earwhig!</i>'s ""Bulldog Skin"", and here, he takes the
    big rock aesthetic to its logical next step, constructing tracks centered
    around big riffs rather than poppy vocal hooks. Which is not to say that
    <i>Isolation Drills</i> is bereft of compelling vocal melodies. Whereas
    many of the tracks on <i>Do the Collapse</i> (""Zoo Pie"", ""In Stitches"") had
    practically no vocal melody to speak of, this album couples its increased
    instrumental presence with some of the better melodies Pollard has penned in
    recent years-- most notably the poppy sing-alongs of ""Glad Girls"", and the
    album's first single, ""Chasing Heather Crazy"".</p><p>
    If Pollard's vocals are much improved on <i>Isolation Drills</i>, the tight
    instrumental interplay amongst Pollard's backing band really makes the album
    shine. Ex-Breeders drummer Jim MacPherson, whose playing seemed utterly lost
    in Ocasek's mix, comes through on the new record as a truly frenetic skin-beater.
    And guitarist Doug Gillard, whose technical prowess transformed the very essence
    of Guided by Voices circa <i>Mag Earwhig!</i>, is joined by his Gem bandmate
    Tim Tobias on bass, resulting in some excellent guitar and bass interplay.</p><p>
    Yet, though <i>Isolation Drills</i> does attain a degree of big rock attitude
    that its predecessors never quite approached, it's far from a perfect album--
    in fact, it's perhaps the most homogenous Guided by Voices release to date.
    Sure, there are subtle differences between the sneering, pouting rock of
    ""Want One?"" and the subtle balladry of ""Fine to See You"", but gone are the
    days when a single Guided by Voices record covered everything from sparse
    bubblegum pop to fuzzed-out rock to wacky four-track experiments.  And while
    <i>Isolation Drills</i> is, without doubt, a much, much more consistent
    offering than <i>Do the Collapse</i>, none of its 16 tracks are effortlessly
    catchy enough to lay claim to ""GBV classic"" status.</p><p>
    Still, <i>Isolation Drills</i> is the most mature, darkly sophisticated record
    Guided by Voices have laid to tape (or, in this case, DAT), and Pollard's
    untainted love for rock 'n' roll makes it a fully serviceable record.  And
    if nothing else, Robert Pollard has finally answered the question of what
    he'll do when he runs out of pop songs: he'll write rock songs instead.</p></div>"|3593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3593-isolation-drills/|7.0|Matt LeMay

    Working Men in Rock 'n' Roll. This is a guy who, at one point, was in two
    incredible bands at once (this one and Drive Like Jehu), and somehow convinced
    Interscope to sign them both; a guy who's maintained whole warehouses of
    credibility during his stay on a major by churning out seven-inches and
    compilation tracks for a plethora of tiny labels; a guy who pledged that
    anyone with a tattoo of the Rocket from the Crypt logo would get into their
    shows free forever, and a guy whose fanbase is so incredibly loyal that
    they actually went ahead and got tattoos of said logo.  Now <i>that's</i>
    rock 'n' roll.</p><p>
    
    It was a mighty pleasure to hear Reis reunited with fellow Drive Like Jehu
    alumnus Rick Froberg on last year's Hot Snakes record, and now he's back
    with his main gig's first full-length since 1998. Blame the wait on the
    search for a new label after being predictably dropped by Interscope, because
    from the first blast of <i>Group Sounds</i>' ""Straight American Slave"", it's
    like Rocket from the Crypt were never gone at all. Huge, beefy guitar riffs
    punctuated by the crisp lines of the horn section (I hesitate to call one
    trumpet and one sax a ""section,"" but hey, that's more than most non-ska
    bands have) form the basis of Rocket's 50s-garage-rock-of-the-future sound,
    with Reis leading the way with his indomitable Elvis-gone-punk shtick. It's
    the way RFTC have always done it, so why fix something that's so obviously
    not broken?</p><p>
<i>Group Sounds</i> could be considered a ""back to basics"" record, eschewing
    much of the slicker production work of their last Interscope release, <i>RFTC</i>,
    most likely because their new label couldn't splurge on six-figure recording
    budgets.  While I'm always happy to see major-label castoffs find homes on
    indies, I also think Rocket is one of those rare bands that truly benefited
    from having tons of money to funnel into their sessions; <i>RFTC</i> remains
    my favorite release of theirs because they were able to further develop the
    more classic-sounding facets of their sound. <i>Group Sounds</i> is nonstop,
    straight-ahead rock for the most part, more reminiscent of <i>Scream, Dracula,
    Scream!</i>, but with enough flourishes to keep things from sounding too
    monochromatic.</p><p>
    
    ""Carne Voodoo"" sports a nasty 7/4-time riff that wouldn't have sounded too
    out of place on a Drive Like Jehu record, but then the horns jump in with a
    perfect rhythmic counterpoint and it becomes a bona fide Rocket song. That's
    probably the most important development on <i>Group Sounds</i>: The horn
    section continues to come more and more into its own. In the early years,
    they seemed a rather superfluous addition to the band's sound, but on this
    album, trumpeter JC2000 and saxophonist Apollo 9 are as vital as the guitarists
    or drummer-- maybe even more so.  When they're not playing, they're providing
    the backing vocals, handclaps, and assorted rhythmic instruments that elevate
    otherwise regular rock songs to the level of Rocket songs. And for the first
    time ever, they actually get to take honest-to-god solos on ""Venom Venom"" and
    ""Savoir Faire"".</p><p>
    
    Rocket from the Crypt motor through the first two-thirds of <i>Group Sounds</i>
    like they've got something to prove.  (Which they don't, but they proved it
    anyway for good measure.)  And just as their need for speed is starting to
    wear a bit, they thankfully kick it down a notch for the moody yet propulsive
    ""S.O.S."", ""Dead Seed"", a slower anthem right out of the <i>Circa: Now!</i>
    years, and ""Ghost Shark"", which appears to be a dramatic piano-laden ballad
    for a Scooby-Doo villain.  (I jest.)  Right through to the end, every song on
    <i>Group Sounds</i> is solid, pure, high-octane Rocket fuel. The hardest-working
    man in rock?  I stand corrected: Try the hardest-working <i>band</i> in rock.</p></div>"|6812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6812-group-sounds/|8.2|Nick Mirov

    we're alone now/ The beating of our hearts is the only sah-ound.""</p><p>
    
    --Tiffany (covering some 60s singer I can't be bothered to look up)</p><p>
    
    If you like your Tiffanies less saccharine than that, but only <i>slightly</i>,
    then Anders is the Tiffany for you. Not to say that it's all sweet going here.
    <i>Funny Cry Happy Gift</i> takes the cloying edge off Anders' sugary, sometimes
    grating pipes by adding a heap of desert sand and set props from spaghetti
    Westerns. This should come as no surprise. Anders is the talented progeny of
    filmmaker Allison Anders, best known for <i>Gas Food Lodging</i>, the early-90s
    film about slow-mo life in a miserable New Mexico highway town.  In addition to
    Ione Sky and Fairuza Balk, the film featured a cameo by Dinosaur Jr's J Mascis.
    And wouldn't you know; <i>Funny Cry Happy Gift</i> also features flashes of J
    Mascis, this time mostly in a percussive capacity.</p><p>
    
    Lest you infer some sort of Dubya-esque favor-currying on the part of Anders Sr.
    for her daughter, it should be mentioned that Tiffany befriended Mascis on her
    own, unaided, at the age of 14.  Legend has it, she wrote a fan letter to the
    then-svelte guitar hero, to which Mascis graciously responded.  As if by magic,
    a friendship and creative relationship was born.</p><p>
    
    But we're not done name-dropping yet!  Anders, a native of Los Angeles' Echo
    Park neighborhood, spent several years in Seattle, exploring its music scene
    before tiring of the social homogeny. New York was her next and most fruitful
    stop. While playing out at clubs, Anders caught the attention of PJ Harvey.
    When Anders' asked Harvey to produce her debut full-length, Harvey agreed,
    much to Anders' delight.</p><p>
    
    With all that fame and talent hanging around, you'd expect some spectacular
    results. The truth about the product is considerably less lustrous than that.
    Fortunately, the loss in shine is made up for in grit. ""Person I Knew,"" the
    lead-off track and the album's finest moment, showcases all that's good and
    moving in Anders' musical world: lush, interesting chords, multi-tracked
    vocals, smart instrumentation, and a gripping melody.  Her voice can become
    tiresome, due to its sharp, brittle quality, but she's usually able to mitigate
    her shortcomings by layering the vocal tracks and thickening things up with
    gorgeous harmonies.</p><p>
    
    The feel of <i>Funny Cry Happy Gift</i> is distinctly Western, or as my friend
    Ivan might say, ""dusty."" The thick, choking melancholia that pervades Anders'
    music is definitely mesquite-flavored, scarred by lasso-burns and spur marks,
    and branded in the ass with a big C for ""corny.""  But there are worse things,
    as Anders too convincingly proves. After all, for a Los Angeles-to-NYC transplant
    to put out 40+ minutes of dark cowboy ballads (replete with distorted slide-guitar
    accompaniment) is a foolhardy proposition in theory.  The actuality works
    surprisingly well.</p><p>
    
    ""Here I Forget"" is the best paced of the ten tracks. While several songs lose
    some of their momentum and lack discernable arcs, this one builds to a palpably
    tense finish.  ""I See How Much Has Changed"" is the most maudlin and silly of
    the bunch, and still, that's not enough to sink it.  Imagine if they made
    another installation in the <i>Young Guns</i> series, bringing the heavily
    brat-packed, b-list original cast back for another try, only this time in
    present day New York City. This would be the perfect background music for a
    shot of Kiefer Sutherland's Doc character and Lou Diamond Phillip's Chavez
    walking down the Bowery in chaps and tasseled leather vests looking for a
    bordello. Did I mention that PJ sings background vocals on this one? And that
    J Mascis has a bit part as well?  Star-studded!</p><p>
    
    ""Summer Gold"" is representative of Anders' weaker material. The song sounds
    rather rote and leans too heavily in the direction of Alannah Myles' ""Black
    Velvet.""  Bad.  Harvey's harmonies on this track prove, pretty definitively,
    that no amount of star-shine can polish a turd.  ""Concrete Like Quicksand"" is
    an interesting mix of ""works"" and ""flops."" Tiffany's voice is at its most
    grating here, but the melody, interestingly enough, is one of her best, and the
    chords are appropriately bittersweet and unresolved.</p><p>
    
    High profile friends (I imagine) are mixed blessings, especially for someone in
    Anders' position.  While it must have been a treat to have the help-- both
    technical and personal-- of an esteemed somebody like PJ Harvey, and the musical
    input of an icon like J Mascis, the weight of those names could do her more harm
    than good. This album is bursting with potential, so it's a shame that it might
    be unfairly dismissed for its imperfections, owing to the unrealistic standards
    those high-gloss names sort of imply. Anders' songwriting is no fluke, and as
    she finds her own stylistic voice, she could become a real force.</p></div>"|183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/183-funny-cry-happy-gift/|6.8|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    certain: if there's pain in your life, you're not alone.  The juvenile,
    angst-ridden poet <i>believes</i> he's alone, much to the amusement of
    those who know better.  More world-wise souls like Robert Fisher and Paul
    Austin realize that the catharsis is found in expression, communication
    and that neatly tied package that weds the two of these together:
    storytelling.  They know pain, but their pain is mature.  And as a result,
    their expression of it resonates more universally.</p><p>
    
    Willard Grant Conspiracy has always made music with one hand on the razor
    blade.  A collective-- more in the New England, Walden Pond
    transcendentalist tradition than any sort of sun-baked, hippie Californian
    way-- WGC has, over the years, been a halfway house for like-minded and
    not-so-like-minded stray musicians.  This time out, Fisher and Austin are
    augmented by luminaries James Apt (Six Finger Satellite), Chris Brokaw
    (Come, Codeine, The New Year), Terri Moeller and Carla Torgerson
    (Walkabouts) and Edith Frost (Edith Frost), among others.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Everything's Fine</i>, Fisher and Austin once again put their demons
    on display, soundtracked by populist instrumentation. A menagerie of lap
    steel, dobro, banjo, and mandolin might suggest alt-country, but the
    delivery is more mainstream and surface appealing, even despite the
    tendency to brood.  You could call it ""alt-folk"" if that didn't a) smack
    of unnecessary genre-pigeonholing, and b) sound just plain silly.</p><p>
    
    Sunnier than the tormented, abyss-peering <i>Mojave</i>, <i>Everything's
    Fine</i> is also more piano-centric.  The slight, simple ""Hesitation""
    stands out early, reminiscent of R.E.M.'s ""New Orleans Instrumental No.
    1"" with its gently shimmering, plain keyboard countermelody.</p><p>
    
    The true-to-form ""Ballad of John Parker"" follows immediately, and shifts
    around point-of-view while creeping out the listener with lines like
    ""Early one morning in the warehouse of souls/ Digger was bent to carry the
    load/ Digger, oh, digger what's left to reveal/ Known by the way that he
    carries the load."" The song is exceptional but not representative. Instead,
    more often than not, the lyrics draw attention as the weak link.  The
    narrative voice Fisher has culled over the course of three studio albums
    is undermined here by goofy, unnatural-sounding turns of phrase (""o'er,""
    ""brace of crows,"" etc).  What's more, the hard-luck attitude permeating
    these gentle, plodding death ballads isn't convincing.  It rings false,
    even though those familiar with the band's previous work know it to be true.</p><p>
    
    The album ends on a narcotic note, first with the languid, hesitating
    strums and lap steel if ""Closing Time,"" followed by the piano bar
    introspection of ""Massachusetts.""  And so, eleven tracks pass by with
    hardly an urge to hit the reverse-track skip and hear one again.  A
    pleasant listen, yes, but ultimately disposable.</p><p>
    
    Even though the title is understood to be intentionally ironic,
    the nose-wrinkling number of watered-down tracks on <i>Everything's
    Fine</i> suggest that things might actually be headed for fine, if
    not dandy.  Which is bad news for Fisher and Austin's muse.</p></div>"|8685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8685-everythings-fine/|5.9|John Dark

    greatest misfortunes that can befall a human being. Wise men and oracles have
    been almost unanimously portrayed as tortured souls, forced to come to terms
    with a truth that the average man will barely be able to glimpse over the
    course of his life. It's hard to say whether Will Oldham possesses any kind
    of supernatural perceptiveness, but there have been times in his recording
    career when one has definitely gotten the sense that there's some truth beyond
    our own comprehension that haunts him. Oldham's voice aches with pure fragility;
    when he's at his best, it's impossible to tell whether he's on the verge of a
    complete breakdown or a transcendental revelation. Either way, it's that sense
    of powerful emotion and understanding just below the surface of Oldham's
    quavering voice that has made his music so personally compelling.</p><p>
    
    Thus, it follows that Oldham's most intimate recordings have always been his
    best. On the classic Palace record <i>Viva Last Blues</i>, and his first LP
    under the Bonnie Billy moniker, <i>I See a Darkness</i>, Oldham's voice seemed
    to materialize into a palpable presence, a haunting, troubled apparition that,
    though alarmingly human, seemed to carry with it a supernatural constituent.
    <i>I See a Darkness</i> was the sonic equivalent of a sublimely beautiful
    nightmare. A tangible sense of impending doom managed to coexist with a more
    abstract acceptance of the eventuality of death, resulting in an album that
    flawlessly expressed near-infinite permutations of the inexplicable
    relationship between man and death.</p><p>
    
    If <i>I See a Darkness</i> was an album of fear, <i>Ease Down the Road</i>
    could best be seen as an album of contained joy and resignation. While <i>I
    See a Darkness</i> was kept at a veritable whisper, and rarely deviated from
    the sparsest of arrangements, <i>Ease Down the Road</i> is not only Oldham's
    most fleshed-out work to date, but also his most sonically diverse. The result
    is a fairly uneven batch of songs that, while sometimes hinting at past glory
    and the prospect of new musical directions, suffers from a lack of the
    heart-wrenching melody and intimate delivery that have made Oldham's past
    records so moving.</p><p>
    
    While only five people (including Will Oldham and brother Paul) played on <i>I
    See a Darkness</i>, <i>Ease Down the Road</i> is credited to twelve individuals,
    including David Pajo, Oldham brother and Anomoanon frontman Ned, Chavez's Matt
    Sweeney, and ""filmmaker"" Harmony Korine. Considering that many of the twelve
    contributors to the record are credited with three or four instruments, it
    makes sense that the album would be a much thicker sounding affair than
    previous outings.  Tracks like the album's opener, ""May It Always Be,"" and
    ""After I Made Love to You,"" begin with relatively sparse arrangements, but
    develop to include multiple layers of vocals, pianos, and guitars. Both of
    these songs, like many on <i>Ease Down the Road</i>, vary greatly in quality
    within the songs themselves.</p><p>
    
    ""After I Made Love to You"" develops gracefully along a fluid bassline and
    gorgeous melody until a single blast of digital synth destroys the organic
    feel of the song. ""May It Always Be"" suffers from some more dire faults, most
    notably the lack of memorable traditional melody that Oldham's record so often
    benefit from.  Like all of <i>Ease Down the Road</i>'s less spectacular tracks,
    the flourishes of sound on ""May It Always Be"" don't seem to have any particular
    purpose; the expanded sonic vocabulary comes at the cost of economy and purpose,
    a cost that proves to be unfortunately detrimental.</p><p>
    
    Though a good portion of <i>Ease Down the Road</i> tends to drag, there are a
    few noteworthy tracks that showcase Oldham's amazing songwriting in full form.
    ""Grand Dark Feeling of Emptiness,"" a minor-key acoustic ballad, bears a closer
    resemblance to the songs of <i>I See a Darkness</i> than anything else here,
    and one of the few worthy of the Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy moniker. ""Careless Love,""
    the album's most emotionally powerful track, consists simply of Oldham singing
    a delicate melody that drifts in and out of falsetto over little more than a
    few pulsating chords. Of the more fleshed out tracks, ""Just to See My Holly
    Home"" is by far the most successful-- a sing-along style track that bursts
    with genuine happiness and blissful surrender.</p><p>
    
    Eight years into his recording career, Will Oldham finally seems to be on the
    verge of overcoming the curse of the uncannily perceptive; it seems fully
    possible that in the near future, he'll be able to apply every ounce of his
    understanding of the human condition to an album of pure merriment and
    tranquility, rather than fear and darkness.  <i>Ease Down the Road</i> is
    without doubt a transitional record, and as a result, the many new sounds
    contained within the album don't always mesh seamlessly. But the promise of
    a new direction for Will Oldham, coupled with the impressive, though admittedly
    rare high points of the record, more than compensates for any disappointment.</p></div>"|701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/701-ease-down-the-road/|7.9|Matt LeMay

""Fun-size"" packages of Peanut M&amp;Ms;, free samples of blended coffee drinks, and dollar
    bills found lying in rain gutters-- all are sufficiently satisfying treats, but leave you wanting more.
    Such is the case with this split EP.  Clocking in at a mere four tracks over 16 minutes, I'm just not
    fully satisfied.  On the other hand, everything here is top-shelf material I'd be a fool to bitch about.</p><p>
    
    If you're a fan of the Plan, you might already be familiar with their original contribution to this split,
    ""The Dismemberment Plan Gets Rich"". Not only has it been a live staple for over a year, but it was also--
    along with Juno's ""Non-Equivalents"", the other original tune appearing on this split-- released as a
    seven-inch on the Spanish label BCore a few months back. Luckily, ""Gets Rich"" is one of those rare songs
    that's so goddamned sweet, you can own a copy of it on both vinyl and CD without even the slightest sense
    that you're being excessive.</p><p>
    
    I've often heard that ""The Dismemberment Plan Gets Rich"" was heavily inspired by Outkast's ""B.O.B."", and
    while the boys in the Plan may be as white as albino snowflakes, there are definite parallels. Amidst a
    frenzy of wacky sound effects, Travis Morrison manages to spit out an amazing barrage of syllables in a
    rather short period of time. All 18 syllables of the song's opening line, ""In early '95 we finally got
    the dough to diversify,"" are crammed into two seconds of playtime, resulting in a tongue-to-sound ratio
    of nine syllables per second.</p><p>
    
    The Plan's other contribution is equally entertaining. Jennifer Paige's disgustingly obnoxious hit single,
    ""Crush"", was once just another over-produced, teen-demographied contribution to the canon of pop culture
    by the exalted songwriting team of Goldmark, Mueller, Cosgrove, and Clark.  But now, by stripping the
    track down to its bare essentials, the Plan have recast the song as a sparse, slightly dark love song,
    while retaining lyrics like, ""See ya blowin' me a kiss/ It doesn't take a scientist/ To understand what's
    going on, baby.""  It registers a little like ""Respect is Due"", but without the crescendos.</p><p>
    
    Fellow DeSoto rockers Juno follow the Plan's lead, contributing one original-- the aforementioned
    ""Non-Equivalents""-- and a mind-blowing cover of DJ Shadow's ""High Noon"". The former is a prime example
    of the kind of soaring three-guitar rock the band put forth on their first album, <i>This is the Way It
    Goes and Goes and Goes</i>. The potential of three guitarists in a band has been wrecked many a time by
    gratuitous soloing and similarly self-indulgent crap (Skynyrd, anyone?), but Juno's Gabe Carter, Jason
    Guyer, and Arlie Carstens explore the full dynamic range of the sound, making ""Non-Equivalents"" a lush,
    gorgeous exercise in guitar rock.  And if ""Non-Equivalents"" is an impressive track, the way Juno make
    DJ Shadow's ""High Noon"" come to life is even more so. The energy of a live band simply transforms Shadow's
    version, making it a thousand times more dynamic, exciting, and energetic than the original version.</p><p>
    
    Taking into account its bargain price, it's hard to think of any good reason not to recommend this EP.
    It's fast, it's fun, and it features the talents of two of the best independent rock bands going right
    now. If that isn't worth your six bucks, I don't know what is.</p></div>"|2336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2336-dismemberment-plan-juno-ep/|8.0|Matt LeMay

The quality I'm talking
    about comes from two conflicting forces exerting influence on a piece of
    music; I like to focus on the fabric of the sound as it ripples in response
    to these opposing vectors.  Beauty vs. ugliness, chaos vs. order, and melody
    vs. noise: these are the grudge matches I buy front row seats for, because I
    want to be the first to hear how it ends.</p><p>
    
    I think this interest in tension is why I've become so fascinated with ""glitch""
    music over the last couple of years. Rather than hearing a pretty melody sung
    by a delicate voice, I want to hear that voice struggling to make its way
    through a maze of faulty machinery, barely heard above a din of noxious static.
    To my ears, this multiplies the beauty tenfold, knowing how arduous the journey
    to audibility can be.</p><p>
    
    The ultimate example for me is Nobukazu Takemura's ""Kepler"" from <i>Scope</i>;
    Aki Tsuyuko's voice is manipulated in such a way that we'll never get to hear
    exactly what she has to say, though we can tell from her tone that it needed
    saying. My favorite track off <i>Kid A</i> is the title song for the same
    reason. Likewise, My Bloody Valentine's ""To Here Knows When.""  These tracks
    speak to how I think about life.</p><p>
    
    When Scott Herren makes music as Delarosa and Asora, he seems to be shooting
    for that kind of tension. <i>Agony Part 1</i> touches on the more abstract end
    of the glitch spectrum while incorporating some steady beats and drifting
    ambient passages, which is not far from where Autechre seemed headed with
    their last couple of releases.</p><p>
    
    The problems I have with this record are similar to those I had with <i>EP7</i>;
    the tension is undercut to a degree because Herren piles on the dissonance and
    gives the splendor short shrift. You'll find every digital squelch, fuzz and
    burp you can imagine on <i>Agony Part 1</i>, but only occasionally will you
    hear a sound that puts a lump in your throat.  There's something to be said
    for this kind of restraint, and the music here never runs the danger of
    sentimentality (something that can't be said for Nobukazu Takemura), but I'm
    a little more of a glutton when it comes to melodic payoff.</p><p>
    
    That said, there are a handful of great tracks here. ""Two Hum"" makes good use
    of the kind of Reichian vibraphone patterns I thought I was tired of, then
    mixes them with a drone diced so fine it takes on two pitches simultaneously.
    The four-part ""Paz Suite"" sounds like Autechre remixing Stereolab (which they
    have, come to think of it, on the ""Miss Modular"" 12-inch-- it's just what you'd
    expect). Beach Boys-inspired female vocal harmonies are put through the Pro
    Tools blender and looped, which adds a poignant feel to the repeating synth
    pattern.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks have their moments, but seem somehow too stereotypically ""IDM""
    and, more to the point, a bit too busy for my tastes. Still, there are fleeting
    moments of brilliance on <i>Agony Part 1</i>-- enough to make me want to pull
    up a chair find out what happens.</p></div>"|2262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2262-agony-part-1/|6.6|Mark Richard-San

    music: Seven songs, mostly pieced together using sounds recorded during
    medical procedures.  Yes, M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel (the men of Matmos)
    actually donned surgical masks and brought their DATs into operating rooms
    to record the sounds of a liposuction, nose jobs, and so on. They then used
    their computers to shape and process the sounds into actual compositions.</p><p>
    
    The two made a similar stab at high-concept music-making with their second
    album, <i>Quasi Objects</i>.  I owned that one for a time, but ultimately got
    rid of it because it seemed too reliant on novelty.  On that record, the
    gimmick-- music based on sounds recorded around their home (e.g. whoopee
    cushions, etc.)-- smothered the music.  The test of any conceptual record
    is how well it stands on its own, removed from the angle. And <i>A Chance to
    Cut is a Chance to Cure</i> is a first-rate work, even if you're unfamiliar
    with the backstory.</p><p>
    
    That said, knowing the concept behind this record adds plenty to the enjoyment.
    Take ""For Felix (And All the Rats)"", for example.  The music alone, which
    consists of what sounds like Tony Conrad-style detuned string drones and an
    African thumb piano, is striking and needs no explanation. But when we discover
    that the track was made using sounds coaxed from an empty rat's cage (Matmos
    applied a violin bow to the bars to mimic the strings, and then plucked the
    bars for the thumb piano sound), it adds a rich layer of meaning. As a
    commentary on innocent life in bondage, it's just as powerful as a photograph
    of an eyeless monkey in restraints.  Both the concept and the execution of
    ""For Felix"" are brilliant individually, and taken together, the effect is
    almost overpowering; it's a terribly sad and heartbreaking piece of music.
    None of the other tracks feature such a strong conceptual coup, but the rest
    vary from decent to great.</p><p>
    
    When Matmos recorded the sound of the instruments used in laser eye surgery,
    they were smart enough to realize that the buzzing instrumentation bore a
    marked resemblance to a Roland 303, and hence, we have the wired electro of
    ""L.A.S.I.K."" A speech record used to teach enunciation to the hearing-impaired
    serves as the basis of ""Spondee"", with the perfect elocution of the therapist
    used as rhythmic counterpoint to a devastatingly funky house rhythm. There are
    a few horn stabs interlaced with the clubby groove, but the more punchy accents
    come from a tool used to clean sinus cavities.</p><p>
    
    Which illustrates another reason <i>A Chance to Cut</i> is such a success:
    It uses a fresh sound palette. If you've spent any time listening to the
    post-Autechre world of IDM, you're probably aware that most programmers
    aren't getting everything they should out of Reaktor. All those familiar
    buzzes, squelches and clicks are starting to wear out their welcome; hearing
    Matmos work magic with material clearly recorded in the field makes me realize
    what I've been missing. Sounds provide feelings even when they're not playing
    melodies-- so much of the art in this kind of music is assembling the basic
    substance.</p><p>
    
    But if it's melodies you want, Matmos deliver in that department, too.
    ""California Rhinoplasty"" takes a bleep from some kind of surgical monitor and
    pitch-shifts it into something hummable, until the song morphs into an ethereal
    cloud of gentle chords and cutting machines (no doubt buzzing through some nose
    cartilage).  As with the rest of the record, even if you didn't know the song
    title or the sources, it would still sound great.</p></div>"|5151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5151-a-chance-to-cut-is-a-chance-to-cure/|8.8|Mark Richard-San

    any serious head trauma.""  Ladytron remember the 80s very, very well.  These
    youngsters fly the new wave flag and keep feeling fascination, passion burning,
    love so strong.  But Ladytron's musical interests stretch back before MTV, to
    70s Bowie, Roxy Music, Kraftwerk and Cluster.  They're like an unabridged
    Encyclopedia of musical Eurotrash with a sharp pop sensibility.  And with
    <i>604</i>, they've made a fine debut full-length.</p><p>
    I had a pronounced tinge of déja vu when listening to <i>604</i>, but it wasn't
    the retro sound that made me feel like I'd been here before; it was the fact
    that three of the songs here were on the band's four-song <i>Commodore Rock</i>
    EP.  Looks like they missed the memo from the Department of Redundancy Department.
    Don't you hate that?  You probably didn't buy <i>Commodore Rock</i>, though, so
    you're not going to mind the overlap.   In fact, if this is the first time you're
    hearing ""Play Girl"", you'll be damn glad they decided to include it on both their
    releases. It's an ace pop song that Allen Hunter would have been proud to announce
    the world premiere of, and it would have sounded great between Nena's ""99
    Luftballons"" and ""He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'"" by Bananarama and Fun Boy Three.
    Great stuff.</p><p>
    ""Play Girl"" is sung by Helen Marnie, and with her relaxed, breathy tone, she's
    definitely the more engaging of Ladytron's two vocalists.  ""Another Breakfast
    with You"" is another great track she fronts, with a fat Moog drone that gives
    it the feel of early Stereolab. ""The Way That I Found You"" is the third major
    score for Marnie, with a bouncy, anthemic melody over some dark, Naked Eyes-style
    keyboards. These three songs approach new wave pop perfection.</p><p>
    Mira Aroya is around to give the more ""arty"" tracks a serious Continental flair.
    Her deep, Bulgarian-accented voice is used both for humor (as with ""Paco!"", where
    she offers a tour of a department store over a dense electro background) and to
    provide a dark, gothic element to the background (as on ""Discotrax"").  When Aroya
    and Marnie come together to sing the Kraftwerk homage ""He Took Her to a Movie"",
    which borrows its melody and hook from ""The Model"", both slip into robotic Ralf
    and Florian mode with excellent results.</p><p>
    Rounding out the album are several instrumentals that range from dreamy computer
    love ambience (""CSKA Sofia"" could be from the second side of <i>Autobahn</i>) to
    dense analog synth textures in the style of Add N to (X) (""Laughing Cavalier"").
    The tracks on <i>604</i> are sequenced intelligently and keep this slightly
    overlong album purring along nicely. Latter-day new wave may be old hat, but
    there's still room for it when it's done right. Enter Ladytron.</p></div>"|4633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4633-604/|7.5|Mark Richard-San

Everything looked good in Wilson's Beach     Boys camp. He'd just produced one of the most revolutionary albums pop music     had yet seen with 1966's <i>Pet Sounds</i>, and the reports of the follow-up,     <i>Smile</i>, were extremely promising.  ""Our new album will be better than     <i>Pet Sounds</i>,"" he pledged. ""It will be as much an improvement over     <i>Sounds</i> as that was over <i>Summer Days</i>."" One can only imagine how     great an improvement that must have originally been, and how exhilarating it     would have been to look forward to such a dramatic shift occurring again     after such a short period of time.</p>
<p>So who were his worthy competitors? Well, there were the Beatles, and then...     well, really, that was all. Always the tough competitors, the Beatles were the     group with <i>Rubber Soul</i>, the album that inspired Wilson to create <i>Pet     Sounds</i> in the first place. He respected and admired them, and felt he could     beat them to a pulp.  And with <i>Smile</i> set for release in late '66, Wilson     felt that he had the race ""in the bag.""</p>
<p>That is, until December of 1966, at which time label disputes and tension     within the group had reached such a level that Wilson forced himself to     abandon the <i>Smile</i> project as he had envisioned it.  To fulfill     contractual obligations, the Beach Boys recorded <i>Smiley Smile</i> in the     first three quarters of 1967.  The hype died, the album failed, <i>Sgt     Pepper</i> came out, and Wilson began a quick descent into madness. He stopped     taking sole production credits, and lost all confidence, fully aware that,     without the possibility of <i>Smile</i> ever being completed, he could never     top <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>.</p>
<p>It's truly a shame that <i>Smile</i> failed the way it did. And like any     modern everyday thief in the age of Napster, I've been afforded the opportunity     to hear the <i>Smile</i> recordings, or at least what's out there, unfinished,     with an ""unofficial"" tracklist.  It's hard to imagine how it would have sounded     if completely finished; as it stands, however, it sounds like the beginning of     something that could have changed popular music history.  Perhaps we wouldn't     be so monotheistic in our pop leanings, worshipping only at the Beatles' altar     the way some do today.  With the <i>Smile</i> material, full of vignettes,     lush harmonies, unique arrangements and some of the most gorgeous of melodies,     Brian Wilson proved that he was a man of virtually limitless genius.</p>
<p>So now that the history business is out of the way, let's talk about what the     Boys and Capitol Records chose to release in lieu of <i>Smile</i>. <i>Smiley     Smile</i> is a near-masterpiece. Without any awareness of <i>Smile</i>'s     existence, this album could have been a contemporary classic.  Remnants of the     vignette style are still there, along with a sense of humor both musical and     lyrical. Group harmonies shine just as beautifully as any on <i>Pet Sounds</i>,     and although the album isn't anywhere close to the sonic revolution that <i>Sgt.     Pepper</i> had already brought, Wilson's innovative production and arrangements     still bring out the best in every single track.  And one of his best melodies     can be found in ""Wonderful,"" matching, if not topping, anything on <i>Pet     Sounds</i>.</p>
<p>As someone who's heard the <i>Smile</i> sessions, I find many moments sorely     missing, of course; if I had to choose, the most notable exclusion is the     lounge-psychedelic mini-epic ""Cabin Essence."" And the songs that do appear     from <i>Smile</i> are pretty radically reworked, with the exception of ""Good     Vibrations,"" already a #1 single from '66, which can be found in its final     and perfect form here. Strangely enough, the most disappointing re-recording     is of ""Wonderful""; standing on its own, the <i>Smiley Smile</i> version is     gorgeous enough, but it nearly pales in comparison to the stripped-down     harpsichord and heartbreaking harmonies of the original.</p>
<p>As for bonus tracks or outtakes included here, the centerpieces are those     culled from the ""Good Vibrations"" sessions. There are some takes from the     original recording sessions, in which we're given a fascinating glimpse of     Wilson's way in the studio; he directed most of the players live, as if     he were conducting minor symphonies in pop music. Also included is an early     alternate version with different lyrics and even a slightly differing melody,     which, while interesting to compare to the final version, just doesn't     fully succeed.</p>
<p>""Heroes and Villains"" also appears in two forms. As <i>Smiley Smile</i>'s     opener, it remains a multi-part, multi-layered, harmonious pop single, true     to the form of Wilson at his peak. Luckily, Van Dyke Parks collaborated on     the lyrics as he did for much of <i>Smile</i>, ensuring a poetic success     rather than a hit-or-miss Wilson affair, since Brian's lyrics tended to miss     more often than not. As a bonus track, it appears the way it may have been     originally premiered on <i>Smile</i>, with even more random sections,     unpredictable twists and vocal samples. Surprisingly, the re-recorded ""Heroes""     works even better; rather than relying on twists and turns, it's based more     on the voices of the gorgeous ""psychedelic barbershop quartet,"" as Jimi     Hendrix once referred to it.</p>
<p>Indeed, Capitol were smart to include 1968's <i>Wild Honey</i> on the disc as     part of their two-for-one Beach Boys re-release series. But when comparing it     to such an album as the one preceding it here, it barely deserves a paragraph.     One or two of its tracks succeed, mostly when it's either a classic bittersweet     Wilson melody (""I'd Love Just Once to See You"") or a throwback to 50's     dance-pop (""How She Boogalooed It""). And naturally, the production still     sounded good as long as Brian was at least in the studio.  The rest of the     record is in the R&amp;B; vein as interpreted by white surfer boys-- Beach Boys,     even. There's also a Stevie Wonder cover sung with as much faux-soul as Carl     Wilson could have possibly mustered. It's not pretty, and, to be blunt,     neither is the majority of <i>Wild Honey</i>.</p>
<p>Back to 1967, on the day the Beach Boys recorded the bare and light-hearted     ""Vegetables,"" another track written for <i>Smile</i>: Paul McCartney decided     to drop by the studio. He can be heard chewing vegetables for the track's only     percussion. And, as Al Jardine recalls, McCartney and Wilson could be seen     together behind the console at one point, and McCartney even ventured to     play Wilson the just-finished ""A Day in the Life"" before <i>Sgt Pepper</i> was even released. While a supposedly ""burned-out"" genius was creating the     most simplistic recording he'd made in years, he became a first-hand witness     to the popular sonic revolution that he could have been. In the public eye,     the Beatles were the clear victors, and the people simply weren't satisfied     with second place. Now, with <i>Smiley Smile</i> finally reissued in America     after years of out-of-print status, hopefully people will begin to analyze     the whole race again. In my mind, it was a photo finish.</p></div>"|11667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11667-smiley-smilewild-honey/|9.5|Spencer Owen

One or two of its tracks succeed, mostly when it's either a classic bittersweet     Wilson melody (""I'd Love Just Once to See You"") or a throwback to 50's     dance-pop (""How She Boogalooed It""). And naturally, the production still     sounded good as long as Brian was at least in the studio.  The rest of the     record is in the R&amp;B; vein as interpreted by white surfer boys-- Beach Boys,     even. There's also a Stevie Wonder cover sung with as much faux-soul as Carl     Wilson could have possibly mustered. It's not pretty, and, to be blunt,     neither is the majority of <i>Wild Honey</i>.</p>
<p>Back to 1967, on the day the Beach Boys recorded the bare and light-hearted     ""Vegetables,"" another track written for <i>Smile</i>: Paul McCartney decided     to drop by the studio. He can be heard chewing vegetables for the track's only     percussion. And, as Al Jardine recalls, McCartney and Wilson could be seen     together behind the console at one point, and McCartney even ventured to     play Wilson the just-finished ""A Day in the Life"" before <i>Sgt Pepper</i> was even released. While a supposedly ""burned-out"" genius was creating the     most simplistic recording he'd made in years, he became a first-hand witness     to the popular sonic revolution that he could have been. In the public eye,     the Beatles were the clear victors, and the people simply weren't satisfied     with second place. Now, with <i>Smiley Smile</i> finally reissued in America     after years of out-of-print status, hopefully people will begin to analyze     the whole race again. In my mind, it was a photo finish.</p></div>"|11667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11667-smiley-smilewild-honey/|3.5|Spencer Owen

It
    described this former Crowded House leader's work as ""shite"" or some other of
    those British term that makes those tooth freaks of the United Kingdom so
    indecipherable.  I'm pretty sure from the context that the reviewer hates
    Neil Finn, and always has.  Perhaps they had really good music in England in
    the mid-'80s, because I thought Crowded House was a breath of fresh air at
    the time.  Whenever I was trapped listening to someone's Top 40 station, there
    were few such happy oases as ""Don't Dream It's Over.""  Crowded House's biggest
    sin was their continuous drift further into the mellow, leaving some of the
    snap of their melodies and smart harmonies.  So maybe the new Neil Finn record
    <i>is</i> ""shite,"" maybe it's not, but don't write off the guy's whole career.</p><p>
    
    Chamber Strings sounds a lot like later Crowded House.  Don't know Crowded
    House from Bananarama?  Well, then, sorry about that first paragraph.  Chamber
    Strings, of course, aren't as good as Crowded House was.  Frontman Kevin Junior,
    whom some may remember from the Rosehips or Mystery Girls, has a nice, likeable
    face, dresses sharply, and can write competently good, if not compellingly
    great songs.  There are a lot of strings (presumably played in some sort of
    chamber) that have the effect of a hackneyed production device joining a band.
    Sort of an Acoustic Light Orchestra.</p><p>
    
    The most hummable tune is ""Make It Through September,"" which sports a bouncy
    piano, a good tune, and some chronologically and thematically scattered lyrics
    about summer and love.  I'm pretty sure that, in one verse, Junior describes
    December as ""The end of summer/ Autumn time.""  Maybe he's saying September,
    and I'm just going deaf.  Or maybe, like a good rock star, he's just confused.
    It's a fine song, anyway.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, too many of these ballads just drift in the reverb, and
    sometimes the songwriting seems lazy.  Too often Junior falls back on
    languid ""doot de doots"" on a song that hasn't fully explained itself.  An
    irritating device used a <i>few</i> times is the Beatle-trademarked fadeback
    (though, technically, the Beach Boys did it first on ""Caroline No""). It's
    always some dreamy continuation of the song that just played, and always
    unnecessary.</p><p>
<i>Month of Sundays</i> isn't a bad record, and I could see how some could
    like the Chamber Strings.  Perhaps diehard Crowded House fans or Sarah
    McLachlanians wanting to trade up.  I can't, however, see anyone saying, ""This
    is the greatest album in the world!""  It's simply soft and nice.  And soft.</p></div>"|1394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1394-month-of-sundays/|6.9|Dan Kilian

    clichés are the vertebrae of our language.  Mainstream media perpetuates the
    sad state of our communication as a society-- our tendency to say what we
    believe is true because we've heard it so many times on television or from
    Hollywood or on Top 40 radio.   This cycle that produces, nurtures, and
    transforms our interaction undermines individuality.  And yet, there's
    something comforting in using stock phrases to help us express our feelings;
    if we are to believe in a construct like ""the human condition,"" it might as
    well follow that there are only a handful of ways to express our state(s)
    lucidly.</p><p>
    Certainly, the bombardment of triteness simply can't hypnotize all of us all
    of the time.  We who wear the badge of ""cynic"" proudly do our best to develop
    linguistic calluses and shun clichés as much as possible.  M. Gira, the
    mastermind of the Angels of Light and formerly of the Swans, is one such
    cynic who does his damnedest to thwart all things trite in his art.  Odds
    are that he should fail on his newest record, <i>How I Loved You</i>, since
    he's singing mostly about the most potentially insipid subject: love.</p><p>
    Generally, Gira is successful in sounding at least somewhat fresh in his
    amorous lyrical approach.  The problem is, he seems so afraid of rehashing
    that he ends up utterly obtuse (those who read criticism in <i>The Village
    Voice</i> are all too familiar with this unfortunate phenomenon).  A line
    like, ""The red sea is raging/ With my coughing and spitting/ My love is bitter
    sulpher [sic] burning"" (from ""My True Body""), is too preoccupied with flowery,
    unlikely imagery to even make sense.  And in ""Song for Nico,"" he comes closer
    to ""gross"" than ""provocative"" when he sings, ""I am the reason your legs are
    apart/ Mother, come into my heart.""</p><p>
    Though Gira and his Angels are less cautious musically, they don't necessarily
    fare better in that department than they do lyrically.  With two songs clocking
    in around eight minutes, and two more pushing the 12-minute mark, the Angels
    of Light are clearly attempting <i>Gladiator</i>-scale epics.  But these songs
    (along with most of the others on <i>How I Loved You</i>) are bereft of a sense
    of experimentation.  The drab, forgettable songwriting and acoustic folk
    framework is rarely altered over the course of the record, save in terms of
    texture.  The ubiquitous crescendos and sparse-to-large-to-sparse dynamic
    become too predictable to sustain interest for more than three minutes, let
    alone an entire hour.</p><p>
    The space between the pedestrian and the abstract is a dubious void that only
    the most skilled lyricists and musicians can squeeze down.  The fact that
    Gira attempts the monumental, snug fit is admirable.  Sure, he sounds like he
    means what he's saying, but his esoteric words seem born more out of
    self-satisfaction than pleasing listeners.  Ultimately, conviction does not
    compensate for inaccessibility; Gira's calluses, you see, sound much more
    like warts.</p></div>"|186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/186-how-i-loved-you/|4.8|Richard M. Juzwiak

They usually travel in pairs.
    Clean-cut, reed-thin young men from America's heartland.  Skinny ties.
    Starched white shirts.  Academic horn rims.  ""Dressed polite,"" as we used
    to say, smiling even as they thrust their leg into the living room.  Looking
    you in the eye, they ask with a mountain of conviction and concern: ""Friend,
    do you know the Truth?""  Earnest men.  Missionaries.  I think you know who I
    mean... fans of the Embarrassment.</p><p>
    
    Clueless as to what I was in for, I asked them in for some coffee.  We sat on
    the couch.  They came a little too close, cramping my personal space.  I
    noticed the younger one was clutching a square, wrapped package whose outline
    suggested a compact disc.  Ken and Martin they said.</p><p>
    
    ""Have you ever heard of a place called Kansas?"" the older one asked.  ""What,
    Oz?"" I replied, and they snickered.  The evangelist continued, ""Well, Kansas
    was the place where hundreds of people first heard the Truth, twenty years
    ago.  There's a place there called the Cedar-- a club, actually-- where the
    Gospelwriters played often.  The Faithful make a journey to the mecca at least
    once in their lifetime.""  The regurgitation of scripted convers(at)ion starters
    tapered and dulled as I keyed in on a particular word.  The gospelwriters?
    ""Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,"" some catechism part of me recalled.</p><p>
    
    Must have been aloud, because Martin looked taken aback.  ""No,"" he said.
    ""No, no.  Bill, Ron, Brent and John.  From the Embos.""</p><p>
    
    Ah.  It sunk in.  Cult band.</p><p>
    
    I offended further. ""Oh yeahhhhh.  Don't they sound like the Buzzcocks?
    Or the Feelies?""</p><p>
    
    ""Ken,"" said the elder and gestured toward his partner.  Ken stood and made
    for my CD player, taking two jewel cases out of his package: <i>Blister
    Pop</i> and <i>Heyday 1979-1983</i>.  ""They go together,"" he informed me.
    Old Testament and New, I thought to myself (silently, this time). ""<i>Blister
    Pop</i> is the arcana,"" Martin explained.  ""Outtakes, live appearances, radio
    spots, demos.""  As the music began, his eyes just glazed over.  ""The sound
    quality is so good, it's just like being there.""</p><p>
    
    And then with a straight face, ""Live concerts are the Masses of our
    generation.""</p><p>
    
    The stereo throbbed with the rough, flatly recorded mixes.  John Nichols'
    everyman vocals weren't half as impressive as the furious mess of organ, cheap
    guitars and amps, and chocolate-chunk bass ripping out post-punk with a
    nervous, gangly energy.  Music for small, tight places-- as lost in a stadium
    (or, for that matter, a cathedral), as a wandering kid in a department store
    aisle-maze.  Music for people who can't keep their hands still.</p><p>
    
    As a matter of fact, by the sixth track, Ken could hardly contain himself.
    He twitched a bit unnervingly, nearly in time to the music.</p><p>
    
    My ministering friend: ""Do you watch public television, John?""</p><p>
    
    ""I don't see how...""</p><p>
    
    ""I thought so.  Have you ever stumbled on a fascinating, well-made documentary
    about a subject or place that you never knew existed?  Some alien species of
    insect living in the parched desert; the untold story of a bridge-building
    project 50 years ago that snowballed out of control; true war stories of
    one-legged women spies operating in Vichy, France?  <i>Blister Pop</i> is like
    that-- it opens the door to a world that you weren't aware of.  It's
    enlightenment, John.  It's one of our most effective evangelical tools, really.
    It makes people <i>aware</i>.""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, sure.""  Based on what I heard, I could go along with all that.  ""Thanks.
    I think I'd like to hear more of this.""</p><p>
    
    But once the floodgates of soul-saving were opened, Martin was unstoppable.
    ""The genius of 'Podman' or 'Elizabeth Montgomery's Face'-- those could only
    have been divinely inspired.  Mere mortals couldn't have written them.  And
    look what the Embos did to covers like 'Maybe Baby' or 'Time Has Come Today,'
    'No Reply.'  You already know a lot of these songs; <i>Blister Pop</i> is
    one-third covers.  But you don't know them the way the Embarrassment plays
    them.""</p><p>
    
    ""How old were you in 1981?"" asked Martin, changing gears.</p><p>
    
    ""Ten"" I said, suddenly growing more skeptical.</p><p>
    
    ""You missed it all. This is your only hope for understanding, John. These
    twenty tracks of rarities. You need this.""</p><p>
    
    The younger picked up the liner notes and turned to Page 8: Track 13.  He
    quoted from ""Song for Val"": ""I don't care for old people/ Very, very old
    people.""</p><p>
    
    That was the proverbial straw.  ""No, thank you."" I said and stood abruptly,
    shoving them toward the door and handing them their coats.</p><p>
    
    ""We're here to help you..."" Martin began.</p><p>
    
    ""No, thank you,"" I interrupted.  Shove.</p><p>
    
    ""But they were <i>influential</i>"" he pleaded.</p><p>
    
    ""I gave at the office.""</p><p>
    
    Martin's voice took on a desperate pitch. ""Can't you see?  You missed out
    on something special, something unique.  The synchronicity of life is all
    about being in the right place at the right time.  Those happy few who
    attended University of Kansas or Wichita State at the dawn of the post-punk
    era, they were the fortunate ones-- far more fortunate than you or me.
    <i>They</i> had the Embarrassment in real time.  We only have their legacy!""</p><p>
    
    ""I prefer the Del Fuegos!"" I lied.  ""Get out!""</p><p>
    
    I slammed the door and waited until the pair was all the way to the sidewalk
    and safely out of earshot.  Then I walked to the stereo, reset the disc and
    boosted the volume.</p></div>"|2767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2767-blister-pop/|7.3|John Dark

    safely say that the boys in Hood are on to something with the title of this
    EP. By the end of my vacation, I was seriously looking forward to going home--
    to the fluffy pillows, the hundred channels of cable television, and a bathroom
    that's only slightly vermin-infested. But no sooner had I set foot in the front
    door than I began to slink back into that all-too-familiar rut that only home
    can provide. I immediately settled into the firmly established ass-groove in
    my desk chair, received the hundred or so e-mail messages that were waiting
    for me. And then I stubbed my fucking toe.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, I was also coming home to my stereo.  If I was going to be
    miserable, at least I was fully equipped to provide an adequate soundtrack
    for low-level depression and aching digit.  And while <i>Home is Where it
    Hurts</i> could sadly not provide decent accompaniment for the throbbing toe
    pain, it makes a rather pleasant companion for a transition from care-free
    vacation days to the saddening realization that I'm going to be in the same
    place for a long, long time.</p><p>
<i>Home is Where It Hurts</i>, the most recent entry into the band's massive
    canon of work-- they've issued 4 full-lengths, 11 singles, 4 split singles,
    26 compilation tracks and 4 remix records over the course of the past 10 years--
    is 25 minutes of deliberate, meditative rock, served up with flourishes of
    piano, strings, and skittering drum machine beats.  At the heart of its best
    moments is the pairing of straightforward, slow-to-mid-tempo songs with
    frenetic, glitchy percussion. This combination is the first thing heard on
    <i>Home is Where It Hurts</i>, and largely defines the sound of the record.
    The EP's title track begins by pairing hyper pre-programmed kicks and snares
    with plucked acoustic guitar. As layers of guitars, drums, and muttered vocals
    build, the track develops into a lovely rock song, though the interplay of the
    electronic percussion with the organic instruments gradually loses steam.</p><p>
    
    A better example of Hood's incorporation of crazed drum machines amidst
    melancholy pop strains would be ""The World Touches Too Hard,"" the EP's
    standout.  A hissing electrobeat permeates layers of strings, reverb-tinged
    guitars, and claustrophobic vocals. The piercing blasts of treble amidst a
    sea of mid-range really brings the track to life, elevating it above the
    pretty but occasionally dull nature of the rest of the record.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, many of the strengths and weaknesses of <i>Home is Where It Hurts</i>
    seem to come simply with the type of music Hood plays.  The songs here develop
    quite deliberately, but never really deviate from the path that they carves
    out for themselves at the outset.  Hood may not possess the fragile beauty of
    their better contemporaries, but the music is sonically dense enough to keep
    you interested.  In other words, it's nice accompaniment for relaxing or
    applying ice to a swollen toe, but you probably won't be taking it on any
    road trips.</p></div>"|3916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3916-home-is-where-it-hurts-ep/|7.2|Matt LeMay

    ""Man, this is going to be so cool!"" I said to Jimmy, who was leaning on a
    pine tree, looking at the fire.  Neither of us had ever tripped on mushrooms
    before.</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah, dude,"" he said.  ""Way cooler than that time we ate raw Kool-Aid and I
    puked on your sister's shoe.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah, way cooler than that,"" I said. ""Turn the music on, man. We need a
    little atmosphere if this is going to work correctly.""</p><p>
    
    Jimmy put the Tyde's debut album in the stereo and hit play.  ""Dude, I hear
    this is, like, totally psychedelic.  Three of these guys are in Beachwood
    Sparks.""</p><p>
    
    ""Aren't they a country band or something?"" I asked.  ""I thought they were
    basically a throwback to the Flying Burrito Brothers.""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, kinda.""  But it's just the drummer, the lap steel guy and the bassist.
    The other half of the band is different, so it's not really the same band.""
    
    The album's first song, ""All My Bastard Children,"" wafted out of the speakers.
    Big, clean guitars arpeggiated over a leisurely drumbeat before being joined
    by Darren Rademaker's baritone musings on cheating lovers and drug abuse.  It
    was pleasant, but I couldn't see it enhancing the mood much.</p><p>
    
    ""Hey, this is pretty good,"" said Jimmy.  ""It's nice and mellow.  This song,
    'New Confessions,' is close to Beachwood Sparks, with all the swelling steel
    guitars.""</p><p>
    
    ""The melody sounds like it came from a Blue Oyster Cult song, though,"" I
    said.  ""Either way, these guys are stuck in 1972.""  ""Strangers Again"" began
    to play.  ""Whoa!  If I didn't know better, I'd say that intro was lifted
    from an early Flaming Lips song or something.  Ann Do's warbly, pitch-altered
    keyboards and the strained falsettos are pretty psychedelic, I guess.  But
    I'm still not seeing anything.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah, me neither,"" intoned Jimmy, reaching for the bong. He took a big, long
    puff and immediately started coughing like crazy.  ""Ugh.  I don't know if
    this is working like it's supposed to.  This smoke is really weird.""</p><p>
    
    ""It smells kind of like a French restaurant,"" I offered, as the ""Get Around
    Too,"" yet another ode to lovers going everywhere but to their own bed,
    swooned from the stereo.  ""Wow, when the cymbal-heavy drums finally kick in
    and those guitars start the slow, raking strums, it's pretty cool.  I think
    this is my favorite part so far.  It's pretty psychedelic, but man, I'm
    <i>still</i> not seeing anything.""</p><p>
    
    ""You know what I don't like about this stuff?"" Jimmy asked, suddenly looking
    more focused than usual.  ""Every song uses the same types of scales.  It's
    all this pentatonic stuff over and over again.""</p><p>
    
    ""You can't really fault them for that, though, dude.  Every other psychedelic
    song ever recorded is pentatonic, be it British, American, or... I don't
    know... Italian.  It just sounds spacy.  Which makes this music kind of weird.
    The Tyde sound like a country band from space.  They should all go live on a
    space ranch or something.""</p><p>
    
    ""Whoa.  Space ranch!  That'd be so cool!""  Jimmy sat back and gazed at the
    stars for a second.  ""Damn!  I'm fucking <i>still</i> not seeing anything.
    What about you, spaceboy?""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, I made that stupid space ranch remark a little easier than I'd like to
    admit, but, no, I don't think I'm seeing anything.  You'd think with all the
    phaser on that organ in 'The Dawn' we'd be seeing all kinds of crazy stuff by
    now.""</p><p>
    
    ""Phasers are cool,"" mused Jimmy, throwing a stick onto the fire.  ""We should
    have brought marshmallows, you know that?""</p><p>
    
    ""The Dawn"" petered out in a wash of phasers, harmonies and buzzy organs.  A
    slightly chill breeze blew through the woods.  You could hear the highway in
    the distance.  The sky was so clear.  You could see the band of the Milky Way
    stretching out in both directions, 100,000 light years thick.  If I was going
    to have my first trip, this was the place to do it.  Of course, the trip was
    refusing to materialize.</p><p>
    
    ""Are you sure we're doing this right?"" I asked.  ""Is the bong set up properly?
    Are you even supposed to smoke mushrooms?  I heard you're supposed to eat
    them.""</p><p>
    
    ""This is how my friend Al said to do it!"" defended Jimmy.  ""I don't know why
    it's not working.  Maybe the music's not psychedelic enough.  I should have
    brought <i>Disraeli Gears</i>.""</p><p>
    
    ""The music's plenty psychedelic, Jimmy.  I think we're doing it wrong.  You
    kind of have a point about the music, now that I think about it, though.
    It's psychedelic in a very American way, with those California steel guitars
    and the loose, jammy vibe.  It's the kind of music that'd probably be enhanced
    by hallucinations, but it's not the kind of stuff that'd ever produce them.
    'Improper' even sounds a bit like <i>Crooked Rain</i>-era Pavement, only more
    produced.""</p><p>
    
    ""Hey, I think I'm starting to see stuff!"" said Jimmy, getting excited.  ""Oh,
    wait, that's just a smudge on my glasses.""</p><p>
    
    I took another puff from the bong.  ""Dude, nothing's happening.  What kind
    of mushrooms are these, anyway?""</p><p>
    
    ""They're Portuguese.  I think they're called 'portabello.'""</p><p>
    
    ""What?!  You idiot!  You can't trip on fuckin' portabello mushrooms!  My mom
    serves these when we have important company over!""</p><p>
    
    There was an awkward silence between the two of us as ""Your Tattoos"" played
    in the background.  It was a pleasant little mid-tempo number just like most
    of the rest of the record, filled out with subtle steel guitar flourishes and
    some understated two-part harmonies.</p><p>
    
    ""Well, I guess that explains the French restaurant smell,"" said Jimmy
    dejectedly.  He pulled the collar of his flannel shirt up a bit to ward off
    the breeze.  ""Damn, we should have brought marshmallows.""</p><p>
    
    ""Shit.  Well, man, it's no big deal.  There'll be other times for this.
    Let's just listen to the last song and go home.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah, okay,"" said Jimmy.  ""I suppose it wasn't a totally wasted evening.""</p><p>
    
    ""Silver's Okay Michelle"" opened with quiet strumming and delayed guitars
    echoing in the background.  Rademaker entered sounding a lot like Seven
    Percent Solution's Reese Beeman-- appropriate given how much the music sounded
    like modern Texas psych with a steel guitar.  It was good.  A regular chip
    off the chocolate fireball.  As the body of the song gave way to an extended
    coda, full of rumbling drums, freaked-out guitars and swirling keyboards, I
    swear I had a little, four-second hallucination-- a sunset in the middle of
    the forest.  The Tyde's pastoral psych had finally hit me where it wanted to,
    and with no drugs at all.</p><p>
    
    ""Hey, let's go,"" said Jimmy as the laser slid back across its track in the
    player.  ""Make sure we've got everything.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah, it's all here,"" I said.  I threw the remaining mushrooms into the
    woods and stamped out the fire.  ""Next time, we'll bring marshmallows.""</p></div>"|8231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8231-once/|6.6|Joe Tangari

    Thrill Jockey.  As high as the highs on that record were (I've written before
    about how emotionally engaging I find ""Kepler""), it offered only a narrow
    slice of Takemura's musical personality. The precise and abstract line
    drawings on the cover in part reflected the album's content. ""Taw,"" for
    example, resonates mainly as an example of what can be done with modular
    synthesizer software. The base sound material of that track is interesting,
    sure, but I still find the composition of the track confusing and ultimately
    devoid of feeling.</p><p>
    
    Aside from <i>Scope</i>, the majority of Takemura's solo work (most of which
    is only available on import) has been released under the name Child's View.
    The title of this project gives some clue as to where he's coming from.  What
    does it mean to have a child's view?  There's the romanticized notion that
    there's something good and pure about the way kids see the world-- the idea
    that children have some special insight into the essential, an insight lost
    somewhere around the same time as ""innocence."" Indie pop fans might recognize
    this attitude as one of the founding principals of K Records.</p><p>
    
    I think of childhood and the ""child's view"" differently. To me, childhood is
    a time of hyper-intense feelings that are almost possible to understand or
    express. Internally and externally, nothing makes sense. For example, I
    remember Walter Cronkite anchoring the CBS evening news in 1975. I always
    left the room to play with toys when Cronkite showed up, but one day I
    decided to stick around and see what all the fuss was about. As I watched,
    I could only understand every third or fourth word. He was probably talking
    about Cambodia or something, reeling off Southeast Asian place names.  Suffice
    to say, I couldn't make out a thing. I wondered how other people in my house
    could enjoy it. It was a lonely feeling. I think Takemura has an uncanny
    understanding of this perspective, and even more amazing, realizes how to
    turn it into music.</p><p>
<i>Hoshi No Koe</i> is a rich album that goes a long way in fusing the
    split between <i>Scope</i> and his Child's View material. The simple melodicism
    is here. There's even a semi-traditional pop song in ""Sign,"" complete with
    vocodered singing (I know everyone is sick of vocal processing; it's still
    working for me). But the fuzzy abstraction on <i>Hoshi No Koe</i> seems more
    grounded and easier to access.</p><p>
    
    Take the sixth track, ""A Chrysalis."" Through its long first section, it seems
    to move randomly as small clusters of distorted chords are occasionally
    interrupted by clanging percussion. But somewhere around the eight-minute
    mark, the haphazard buzzes coalesce to form one long, gorgeous tone that
    extends for another eight. A chrysalis is, of course, a pupating butterfly,
    and this title makes perfect sense.  It's so much easier to hear the sounds
    squirming in their cocoon when you realize how beautifully they'll emerge.</p><p>
    
    ""Anemometer"" is the only place Takemura indulges his pronounced Steve Reich
    fixation. Electric piano, organ and clarinet play hypnotic patterns that don't
    so much change as build up and fall apart.  Underneath the pulses lies an
    awkward drum machine that tries to keep up, misses beats, and occasionally
    drops out altogether. It's fascinating to hear how ""Anemometer,"" which is
    very pretty even during a casual listen, as it constantly struggles to find
    its footing.</p><p>
    
    Equally poignant, but in a completely different way, are the short, almost
    folky tracks that crop up between the lengthier statements. The opening ""One
    Day"" features the distant sound of oceans and forest beneath the lone
    instrument, an organ playing a MIDI variation on a music box theme.  ""Stairs
    in Stars"" find the same keyboard playing what most would describe as a
    carousel melody, stark and alone in the absence of children's voices. ""Sign""
    is the pop tune, and a fine one it is; the warm electro beat seems wrapped in
    a layer of cotton, and the sunny melody is immediately appealing.</p><p>
    
    At 77 minutes, <i>Hoshi No Koe</i> is perhaps too long and varied for its own
    good, and some of the noisier bits still seem somewhat out of place. But
    nothing else I'm hearing these days can match Takemura for capturing the
    complicated feelings I associate with growing up. It's always been hard
    to talk about.  Now I can just listen.</p></div>"|7922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7922-hoshi-no-koe/|8.2|Mark Richard-San

    at you; it's more like water, running unpredictably in all directions. What
    he means, I think, is that the current of popular culture doesn't flow in
    a straight line; it rolls into little tributaries and unpredictable whirlpools
    without any regard to what we'd like its direction to be. With all the
    late-60's hero-worship going on these days, this might be something we'll
    want to keep in mind.</p><p>
    Of course, the Minders might disagree. Like their spiritual godfathers, the
    Apples (in Stereo), the genial Portland collective make four-track-recorded
    symphonies, clearly indebted to the Beatles and Beach Boys.  As if the history
    of popular music could be represented as one of those monkey-to-man charts
    where the subject in question starts out knuckle-dragging and hairy and ends
    up straight-postured and clean-shaven.  To Martyn Leaper, the Minders' guiding
    light, it's pretty apparent that the collective personage of Lennon, McCartney
    and Wilson represents the pinnacle of human evolution, and anything that steps
    too far off the path of their particular beliefs runs the risk of turning into
    something completely alien-- like if you don't have massed harmonies, elaborate
    arrangements, and sweetly naïve lyrics about love and loss, you're not really
    human anymore.</p><p>
    This is, of course, a patently extreme way of putting things, but that doesn't
    mean it's not a little bit true.  Over the Minders' assembled body of work,
    they've only really developed a single idea.  Their debut, <i>Hooray for
    Tuesday</i>, was sweet and goofy chamber-pop with a few modern touches
    thrown in, and the following collection of demos and old singles indicated
    that Leaper's heart had been set on such sugary confections from the get-go.
    <i>Golden Street</i> is a slightly more complex recitation of exactly the
    same values, and, if you don't mind setting the Wayback Machine every time
    you turn on your CD player, it's a pretty nice way to spend an afternoon.</p><p>
    The trouble, though, is that there's not much new to be unearthed here.
    According to Costello's Elephant Principle, the Minders want very badly to
    be exactly in the path of what they perceive as being the single direction
    popular music is evolving in. Having hitched their aesthetic wagons to a
    single horse, they no longer seem to feel what they're doing. Instead, Leaper
    and his band of pals (which includes current Jick Joanna Bolme) have chosen a
    specific vocabulary for what they do, and they're more than content to ride
    the angle out as far as it will take them.</p><p>
    What's more unfortunate about <i>Golden Street</i> is that it's clearly
    more restrained and traditional than any of the band's previous outings. The
    best moment on <i>Tuesday</i> was, by far, the funny transition between
    ""Bubble,"" an oddly minimal instrumental for bass drum and guitar, and the
    relatively epic closer, ""Frieda."" There's little of that kind of
    experimentation on <i>Golden Street</i>, as the band just try to write as
    many <i>Pet Sounds</i>-era gems as they can before their well of inspiration
    runs dry. Unfortunately, without the deep, intuitive commitment to sound Brian
    Wilson had, the Minders end up sounding rote and a little bit straightjacketed.
    Whereas the Beach Boys' finest moments came out of tossing the rulebook they'd
    been handed in the past, the Minders are so committed to following their
    ancestors that they can't find anywhere for their own more idiosyncratic
    moments to fit.</p><p>
    This kind of rigid formalism is unfortunate, because Leaper's a very talented
    songwriter: he has a way with a hook, and the mannered arrangements are
    modestly compelling.  But because everything here has been done somewhere
    else-- and by someone driven to create a sound they could only hear in their
    head-- we don't get the same thrill out of listening that Leaper got out of
    writing. Instead, it sounds like he's lashed himself to an elephant that can't
    possibly change direction however much it wants to. If the rest of us have to
    put up with the more confusing rivulets and rivers that get produced by the
    pop-music-as-water metaphor, we're still better off. At least we're given the
    occasional pleasure of being genuinely surprised.</p></div>"|5295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5295-golden-street/|5.8|Sam Eccleston

You don't?  Oh.  Well, let me tell you about him.  He
    was this gigantic pitcher of Kool-Aid who used to blast through the walls of
    people's homes whenever mom was mixing up a batch of the horrid bug-juice and
    yell, ""Oh, yeah!"" in a guttural Hulk Hogan growl.  I had a lot of problems
    with this.  For one, he was fucking terrifying!  What would you do if an
    oversized vat of red, watery liquid came bashing through your wall, yelling,
    ""Oh, yeah!"" and sloshing on your floor?  You'd freak out, that's what.  And
    these people were <i>thrilled</i>!  What about the bills for wall repair?
    And where did he come from, anyway?  What <i>is</i> he, even?</p><p>
    
    Though my traumatic memories of Kool-Aid Man-- and his short-lived Saturday
    morning cartoon-- may never truly fade, I think I may be able to put them in
    some perspective now.  You see, a bizarre monstrosity recently crashed
    unexpectedly through my wall.  And I like it.  I call this monstrosity
    Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, and you should, too, because that's their
    name.</p><p>
<i>Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche</i>
    is possibly the worst album title in the world, ever.  But then again, the
    band's name is so long and awkward that the two cancel each other out.  These
    guys' history dates back more than 15 years, but the time the band took off
    after 1997's disastrous tour opening for Live seems to have paid off in spades.
    For the life of me, I can't imagine what was going through the head of the
    concert promoter who teamed one of the weirdest bands San Francisco has ever
    produced with <i>Secret Samadhi</i>-era Ed Kowalczyk.</p><p>
<i>Celebrity Avalanche</i> blasts open with ""Another Clip,"" a raging mass of
    garage rock guitars alternately pounding the Stooges into the ground and
    mimicking J.S. Bach with tossed-off guitar figures.  The vocals are melodic,
    but understated.  Noises enter and exit the mix seemingly at random, like a
    bastard offshoot of the Residents.  Kool-Aid Man has arrived.  The <i>Piper
    at the Gates of Dawn</i>-style hand percussion and heavily processed vocals
    of ""Sno Cone"" call this band's collective sanity into question, especially
    when followed by the off-key falsetto caterwauling of the chorus.  Somewhere
    in Heaven, Frank Zappa is smiling.  Or doing speedballs with John Belushi.</p><p>
    
    The album is filled with short interludes that seem to be randomly extracted
    bits of larger performances.  ""You Will Be Eliminated"" is a 12-second gossamer
    burst of wind noises and distant, mechanical voices, while ""Birth of a Rock
    Song"" sounds exactly like what its title suggests it is.  ""Boob Feeler""
    distorts an ages-old descending bassline under spooky whistling, but refuses
    to develop itself, preferring instead to fade out and leave you wanting more.</p><p>
    
    And then the Fellers give you ""In the Stars I Can Sizzle Like a Battery,""
    which showcases more demonic guitar work from Hugh Swarts and Mark Davies.
    The guys also offer up some truly demented lyrics here, delivered in a
    hilariously melodramatic falsetto.  See if you can catch the Zappa reference:
    ""Call Me Bruce or call me Troy or call me Dave/ I'm selling sauce in a crass
    parade/ Lumpy gravy dripping through my psyche/  I suspect that my synapses
    are flickering/ Thick and greasy, ploggered and pasty/ I do declare, there's
    a syrup on my sanity.""  Indeed.  Even Kool-Aid Man has fled in terror by now.</p><p>
    
    The simple truth here is that I have no idea why I like this music. I just
    do. There's a madcap genius that pervades everything from the brilliant
    prog-rock send-up ""Holy Ghost"" to the ten-minute, eddying closer ""He Keeps
    Himself Fed.""  And that's not to mention the album's true masterstroke, ""You
    in a Movie.""  Bassist Anne Eickelberg and drummer Jay Paget lay down a thick
    groove while Davies, Swarts and Brian Hageman layer noises and quivery guitar
    riffs over the proceedings.  Lee Ranaldo <i>wishes</i> he could be this
    dissonant.  And the lyrics! ""A cow mooed, then it called my name/ 'I could
    put any one of you in a movie'/ It licked me, then it looked away/ I lost a
    lot of blood that day/ How's a cowpie like a cow?/ The secret's in the cow.""
    What does it all mean?</p><p>
    
    Frankly, I don't care.  All I know is that these Thinking Fellers have made
    one crazy album after another for the past 13 years, and that <i>Celebrity
    Avalanche</i> is one of their best.  Left field recordings like this aren't
    exactly hard to come by, but they're rarely this good.  Provided they don't
    go on strike anytime soon, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 stand to make a
    lot more wonderfully warped music.  And Kool-Aid Man ain't got nothin' on
    that.</p></div>"|8008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8008-bob-dinners-and-larry-noodles-present-tubby-turdners-celebrity-avalanche/|8.6|Joe Tangari

    as the Animals and Creation, the Kinks were arguably one of the four great
    bands of the British Invasion. Maybe they weren't as bold as the Beatles, as
    contentious as the Stones, or as audacious as the Who. But if you consider
    true greatness in terms of influence and innovation-- not to mention a little
    popularity, as the times required-- then the Kinks, namely Ray and Dave
    Davies, have secured their place atop rock 'n' roll's Mount Olympus.</p><p>
    
    Consider this: when the Kinks released ""You Really Got Me"" in 1964, the
    Beatles were nodding their heads, playing to the ladies; for they had yet to
    cry ""Help!""  The Who were still a year away from ""My Generation,"" but in the
    meantime would come up with ""I Can't Explain,"" which owed Third World-degree
    debt to ""You Really Got Me."" And when the Stones weren't still covering R&amp;B;
    songs, they were busy taking cues from the Beatles-- which wouldn't change
    until the epiphany of the following year's ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.""
    At a time when rock 'n' roll was evolving faster than ever before, the Kinks
    were, for the time being, the loudest (white) rock out there.</p><p>
    
    So the Kinks' relatively congenial relationship with the traditional BBC was
    indeed odd, especially considering that the BBC primarily broadcast music by
    dance bands and orchestras. The relationship started, as one might expect,
    with ""You Really Got Me,"" as well as three other tracks recorded at London's
    Playhouse Theatre on September 7, 1964. Usually, the BBC-- referred to in the
    liner notes, eerily enough, as ""the great Corporation""-- would have screened
    a track such as ""You Really Got Me,"" particularly since rock 'n' roll was in
    its infancy and was thus considered both an aberration and a threat. But the
    single tore through the charts so fast that they waived the review process.</p><p>
    
    Appropriately, this double-disc opens with a quintessentially stiff voice
    saying, ""And now meet the Kinks, five more representatives of the [exaggerated
    pause] shaggy set. And let's hear that number one, 'You Really Got Me.'"" That
    revelatory track-- astoundingly, just their third single-- follows. The
    defiant riff, groundbreaking solo and trademark harmonizing and screaming
    vocals are there, but this classic song is marred by the same limitations
    that hinder this entire collection-- those being underproduction and sloppy
    musicianship. After all, most of these tracks are one-and-done takes with
    only essential overdubs, and they were recorded to BBC's equipment, which was
    subpar even for its time.</p><p>
    
    The admittedly extensive liner notes say that this ""adds to the charm of the
    recordings,"" but they couldn't have backpedaled more had they insisted that
    the Kinks, despite popular belief, were indeed a strong live act. Wait, they
    do that, too. And then when you consider the abundant between-song
    introductions and banter--</p><p>
    
    ""Now, why do you wear your hair so long, lads?""</p><p>
    
    ""I think the girls go for it, man, you know.  They used to go for a moustache,
    but now it's long hair.""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, I'm sorry to hear that. I couldn't grow mine long if I tried, so let's
    change the subject.""</p><p>
    
    -- you've got an album that, despite all its protestations otherwise, seems
    simply intended for its historical insight. As such, it is worthy indeed.
    Arranged chronologically, the album provides a fluid musical timeline of the
    Kinks from their R&amp;B; roots (""Cadillac""; ""Milk Cow Blues"") to their creative
    peak in the late 60's (""Death of a Clown""; ""Village Green Preservation
    Society"") and then on to the unfortunate rock opera grandiosity of the 70's
    (""Demolition""; ""Money Talks""), which renders the second disc disposable.
    (For all intents and purposes, the collection stops at 1974, as only one
    song-- 1977's ""Get Back in Line""-- dates later.)</p><p>
    
    Other than a few exceptions-- ""Love Me 'til the Sun Shines,"" for instance--
    almost all of these songs are inferior to their album versions (the Kinks
    were an underrated studio talent). Furthermore, plenty indisputable classics,
    like ""Shangri-La"" and ""Lola,"" don't appear here; undoubtedly, some were
    never broadcast on the BBC, but it's hard to believe so many weren't played
    during the 24 sessions. And then there's the issue of the last four tracks,
    which, by inexplicably jumping back in years, disrupt the chronological
    fluidity of the album.</p><p>
    
    Thus, <i>BBC Sessions 1964-1977</i> must be deemed worthwhile for completists
    only. For those who lived during the Kinks' early rise and their subsequently
    rocky ride, this album will provide an interesting flashback. And for those of
    us who didn't, this album is mildly interesting-- once. Yes, the Kinks were a
    great band that stood out even during the rock 'n' roll explosion of the 60's,
    but you won't sense much of their brilliance on these recordings.</p></div>"|4459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4459-bbc-sessions-1964-1977/|6.5|Ryan Kearney

    by Brendan</p><p>
    
    Here is what I know about the state of the world:</p><p>
    
    1. We are rich.</p><p>
    
    2. There are no wars or anything (real wars, that is).</p><p>
    
    3. Ummm. Very little continental drift going on (that's probably normal).</p><p>
    
    4. Somewhere, the president's daughter is ""like, totally wasted"" right now.</p><p>
    
    There.  One minor problem.  Otherwise, things are swell.  I haven't really
    researched this much, but if something major was going wrong, I'm sure someone
    would have told me.  So what are these Manic Street Preachers bitching about?</p><p>
    
    They've certainly got as solid a basis for their angst as anyone else.  To
    briefly rehash the requisite facts that every Manics review must by law
    contain: on the cusp of fame, after courting British stardom for years and
    releasing the critically acclaimed <i>The Holy Bible</i>, the band's famously
    unstable lyricist Richey James suddenly and completely disappeared, leaving the
    band stranded.  Although they went on to fulfill all expectations, releasing
    the huge-selling (in Britain, at least) <i>Everything Must Go</i> and <i>This
    is My Truth Tell Me Yours</i> as a trio, that's sure to leave some personal
    issues.</p><p>
    
    As personal as the songs on <i>Know Your Enemy</i> may be, there's always a
    definite political thread tied up in there, too.  Though the band's agenda can
    get mighty opaque at times, the album feels throughout like some sort of call
    to arms.  And they're not just preaching to the converted.  Rather than aiming
    stylistically at a certain audience, <i>Know Your Enemy</i> finds the Manics
    attempting to write a protest song in just about every genre.  This project,
    stretched out over 16 tracks and 75 minutes, quickly reaches epic proportions,
    with an ambition approached only by the magnitude of its flaws.</p><p>
    
    The range of the album makes it difficult to discern where the band's stylistic
    allegiances really lie.  While punked-up anthems like the opening track, ""Found
    That Soul"" and ""Intravenous Agnostic"" make the most immediate impression, the
    band seems to be at its most sublimely confident in the jangle-pop of tracks
    like ""The Year of Purification"" and ""Epicentre.""  Even some of the songs that
    initially sound like goofs have a core of sincerity.  Ignore the sleighbells
    and ""So Why So Sad"" sounds like a genuine Beach Boys homage.  The ballad ""Let
    Robeson Sing,"" while flirting with parody in its brazen, throaty admiration,
    positively drips with honesty, cutting closer to the heart of the band's
    politics than any other song on the album.  Some of the more interesting tracks
    paste together a number of styles: ""Wattsville Blues,"" with its collage of
    drum machines, acoustic guitars, organs, and Fall-ish speak-singing, finds
    the band wearing their influences as prominently and distinctly as their
    varied politics.</p><p>
    
    The band spreads itself thin, for sure; but, amazingly, it doesn't spread
    itself too thin.  With the exception of an annoying anti-European Union disco
    number, the music is delivered with energy and ability.  The songs aren't
    uniformly memorable, however, and with the better songs clustered toward the
    front of the album, the Manics have started repeating themselves by the time
    ""Dead Martyrs"" and ""His Last Painting"" roll around.  But what a beginning--
    ""Found That Soul"" distills all of the band's exhortations into a concentrated
    blast, while ""Ocean Spray"" takes a more melodic and compassionate approach
    without losing any of the passion.  The excellent trio of ""Let Robeson Sing,""
    ""The Year of Purification,"" and ""Wattsville Blues"" follows two songs later.
    It's not until ""Epicentre"" that they reach the same heights.  The tracks in
    between are nothing to trifle with; however, perhaps because of the album's
    length, they tend to get lost in the shuffle.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the words should be on par with the music in an album like this.
    Nicky Wire, though he may never live down the ""replacement frontman""
    designation, is fairly well spoken, even at his most vehement.  Most of his
    projectile bile is directed at America (""The Devil's Playground,"" as it's
    referred to in ""Baby Elian"").  While there are moments of clarity, as in the
    near-narrative anti-McCarthy recountings of Paul Robeson's political activism,
    most of the invective comes buried under layers of imagery and allusion.
    Again, however, it's not buried too deep.</p><p>
    
    While the references can get a bit
    dense (""Little Guernica"" contains the line ""Alfred J. Prufrock would be proud
    of me,"" which might dip a bit too deeply into the Modernist well), it's
    usually not too difficult to figure out what he's getting at.  Even though, in
    a song like ""The Convalescent,"" I'm not sure what ""Brian Warner has a sweet
    little ass"" signifies, the Luddite message comes across in the chorus: ""DNA
    means do not accept.""  The album's final song, ""Freedom of Speech Won't Feed
    My Child,"" gives the Manic's benediction in its eponymous chorus, a warning
    against complacency, self-righteousness, and lax activism.</p><p>
    
    As a statement for the entire album, this works fairly well-- it's provocative,
    well done, but not quite focused enough to take the listener anywhere in
    particular.  So, the world's fucked up, and these guys can write pretty good
    songs about it.  What am I supposed to do?  Like, what about that Bush girl?
    'Cause man, she's fucked up.</p></div>"|5072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5072-know-your-enemy/|7.5|Brendan Reid

I thought about bringing
    my own music, figuring I knew a bit more about The Chill than your average
    bodywork technician, but then I decided to defer to her experience at the last
    minute. One of the CDs I considered bringing to the Big Rub was this Windy &amp;
    Carl album. <i>Consciousness</i> would work better for a massage than past
    albums by the duo, because it has a slightly warmer, more pastoral feel.
    Absent is the vague dread of <i>Antarctica</i> and the claustrophobic edge
    that drifted in and out of <i>Depths</i>.</p><p>
    
    The song titles on <i>Consciousness</i> reinforce the relative buoyancy of
    sound. I heard the first track a half-dozen times before I noticed that it
    was called ""The Sun,"" which immediately seemed the perfect title.  Consisting
    of just three major chords plucked on an electric guitar and then run through
    a delay pedal, it's a simple, direct statement.</p><p>
    
    ""Balance (Trembling)"" is the only track that touches on the darker shadings of
    albums past, but that's quickly corrected by the glowing shafts of light that
    grace ""Elevation."" The guitar feedback here is far too controlled to be
    threatening, and the various synthesizers and effects pedals are programmed
    to deliver the roundest tones possible. As a kid, I had a dream in which I
    slowly orbited the Cloud City from <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. ""Elevation""
    is the soundtrack to that dream.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, given the tone of many of these tracks, <i>Subconsciousness</i> would
    have been a better title for the album. Unfortunately, that title was already
    taken by Japanese ambient glitch project Neina, for their record on Mille
    Plateaux last year. Windy &amp; Carl seem to acknowledge the hallucinatory quality
    in this particular state of awareness with ""The Llama's Dream."" Picking up
    with the shimmering tones of ""Elevation,"" the tune features Windy's first
    vocals on the album about three minutes in, as the drone gives way to Carl's
    Dean Wareham-inspired strumming. The title track is similarly song-oriented,
    with hazy strums and quiet singing, and then ""Resolution"" takes one more stab
    at the ultimate Om.</p><p>
    
    More than anything, <i>Consciousness</i> documents Windy &amp; Carl's relentless
    search for the perfect drone. These two won't be happy until they find a
    combination of sounds that encompasses all feeling, at which point they will
    then stretch that chord to the vanishing point. Windy &amp; Carl are too committed
    to their quest to consider variety for the sake of variety, so don't approach
    this one expecting a major departure. But if you're tuned in, it should turn
    you on.</p></div>"|8699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8699-consciousness/|8.2|Mark Richard-San

    talking on the telephone.  Though I have a CD player in my computer, I haven't
    been able to find any music that's good for my environment. Everything was
    either too dynamic, and hence interfered with my concentration, or too quiet,
    and got lost in the ambient noise of the office. So I just listen to records
    I've memorized in my head-- things like <i>The Wild, the Innocent, and the E
    Street Shuffle</i>, <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, and <i>Bad Timing</i>.</p><p>
    
    This Mice Parade album solved that little problem. For good or ill,
    <i>Mokoondi</i> walks the razor's edge between too engaging and not engaging
    enough. The dynamic range is minimal. The sounds-- mostly acoustic guitar,
    Chinese harp, vibraphone and drums, with the occasional violin, saxophone and
    Moog accompaniment-- are universally pretty. And they're arranged in a way
    that's variable, without changing so much so as to be distracting. It's the
    perfect music for getting something done. Things like, oh, I don't know,
    writing record reviews.</p><p>
    
    My first pass through <i>Mokoondi</i> was uneventful. It's tough to hear
    instrumental rock music with prominent vibraphones and not think of the
    ""t"" word. That's right, ""thrombosis,"" the medical condition that consists of
    a blood clot forming near the heart cavity. I get a thrombosis every time I
    hear music that reminds me too much of Tortoise, a band I currently find
    boring. But after a few listens, this record does so much more than Tortoise
    has for me in a long while.</p><p>
    
    For one thing, Adam Pierce (who, in addition to running the fine Bubble Core
    label and being a member of the Dylan Group, <i>is</i> Mice Parade) doesn't
    even attempt to make ""songs"" on this record. These pieces are best described
    as ""patterns."" There's barely a chord change on <i>Mokoondi</i>. Perhaps
    inspired by the beautiful sound of the cheng (that's a Chinese harp), Pierce
    constructs pieces that evolve horizontally, and have more to do with addition
    and subtraction than linear movement.</p><p>
    
    So ""Pursuant to the Vibe,"" the only real nod to dub (not surprising, since
    parts of it were recorded live with HiM), consists of nothing more than a
    hip-hop beat, droning clouds of vibes, and an acoustic guitar playing about
    five notes over and over. Amazing how such simple elements, deployed on a
    track that has no real melody or chords, can yield something so tuneful and
    satisfying.</p><p>
    
    About that cheng-- I have to admit that the tracks featuring this ""exotic""
    instrument (well, not so exotic to the half of the world that lives in Asia)
    are my favorites. ""Circle 1"" is just cheng and violin, playing a hypnotic
    pattern with some uncredited vocalizing in the background. Considering how
    beautiful this track is, it's far too short at just under three minutes.</p><p>
    
    Pierce uses the cheng on ""Ramda's Focus"" to interact with dulcimer, guitar,
    and his most inspired drumming on the record. He plays just about everything
    on <i>Mokoondi</i>, but Pierce can really throw on the drums, and when he
    starts double-timing about halfway through, it's breathtaking.  Probably due
    to the instrumentation, this song reminds me of Macha's first record, though
    I find it much more organic in the way it combines the geographically varied
    sounds.</p><p>
    
    I introduced <i>Mokoondi</i> as background music to work to, but I've since
    scrutinized it in more intensive listening sessions, and it holds up rather
    well. It's an unassuming record that opts for sustained beauty over ""the big
    moment,"" so you shouldn't approach it expecting crescendos. Given what Pierce
    has to working with, <i>Mokoondi</i> borders on great. Sixty-five minutes of
    instrumental rock that never gets dull is an impressive accomplishment.</p></div>"|5257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5257-mokoondi/|7.6|Mark Richard-San

Not that
    I can count how times I've canoed or sailed on its surface, both praying for
    and fearing a sighting of its mythic, Loch Ness-ish beast, Old Champ. But
    every time I think of the eight consecutive summers I spent at a camp on its
    shoreline, I think of myself swimming naked in its frigid waters at 6:30 in
    the morning with dozens of other naked little boys, most of us leaving behind
    conspicuous pockets of warm piss.</p><p>
    
    This memory may sound crude to some of you, but to me it's among the purest,
    most innocent moments of a childhood long since passed. The feeling is perhaps
    better described in the title track of the Sixth Great Lake's <i>Up in the
    Country</i>: ""We haven't got a care in the world except for each other and
    the ground we walk upon""-- or, in this case, the lake we swam upon. While
    this connection might seem dubious at best, I should also mention that Lake
    Champlain is unofficially-- and officially, according to Senate Bill 927--
    the sixth Great Lake.  Fittingly enough, this five-member band, which includes
    Jeff Baron, Chris Ziter and Sasha Bell of the Essex Green, recorded the basic
    tracks of the album in a house overlooking Lake Champlain.</p><p>
    
    While the Sixth Great Lake gain plenty of inspiration from Lake Champlain,
    they're also clearly indebted to the country leanings of The Band. For
    evidence, one need look no further than the cover itself, which resembles The
    Band's eponymous second album. But if you're not convinced, then I should
    also mention the Sixth Great Lake's excellent cover of The Band's ""Rockin'
    Chair""-- yes, from that aforementioned album-- which approximates The Band's
    unique male harmonizing without forfeiting a character all its own.</p><p>
    
    But, as the Sixth Great Lake prove with fourteen other tracks, they don't need
    to cover The Band to make great music. The sublime opener, ""Duck Pond,""
    features beautifully understated keyboards and perfectly balanced male/female
    vocals during the chorus. ""Across the Northern Border"" follows, supplanting
    lead male vocals with lead female vocals. With its bongos and nimble acoustic
    guitarwork, the track pulls you forward from the laid-back position demanded
    by ""Duck Pond."" The soft strumming and harmonica of the title track then
    knocks you out of your Adirondack chair and all the way back to 1968-- albeit
    more the 1968 of <i>Music from Big Pink</i> than that of <em>The Graduate.</em></p><p>
    
    Throughout <i>Up the Country</i>, there are hints of other musicians. The
    opening of ""Last in Line"" recalls Johnny Cash's ""I Walk the Line."" ""The Ballad
    of a Sometimes Traveller"" translates Dylan's ""I Shall Be Released"" into the
    third person. And the flute-inflected ""Cannon Beach"" suggests that the Sixth
    Great Lake and Belle and Sebastian share a taste for Donovan. But this album
    is first and foremost an homage to The Band-- the kind that pays its respects
    by not only emulating the sound, but by bringing it into a whole new light.</p><p>
    
    Like any good camp memory, there's little here to find fault with. Sure, things
    sometimes become a little too airy, or reflective, or reclined, or soft-edged.
    But that's what you'd expect from an album as temporally displaced as this one.
    While too many bands, including the Essex Green, are rehashing psychedelic
    60's pop, the Sixth Great Lake have resurrected of an oft-forgotten sound of
    the decade. Yes, there were the dirty mud pits of Woodstock, New York. But not
    too far from there was Lake Champlain, with its crisp, unbroken surface, just
    waiting for someone to piss in it.</p></div>"|7213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7213-up-the-country/|8.0|Ryan Kearney

    daddy of techno, Carl Craig, has answered the siren call of inevitability
    and has released a mix album on Shadow  As longtime readers of <i>Pitchfork</i>
    will recognize, we're only too happy to pour scorn on sad-sack labels, and few
    have had sad-sackier pasts than Shadow. Actually, Cleopatra have long worn
    the sad-sack crown, but Vitamin's foisting of <i>The Electronic Tribute to
    Radiohead</i> rivals even that label's madcap ventures into digitally stored
    effluent. These stultifying acts of barbarism have pushed Shadow well into
    the sphere of the acceptable.</p><p>
    As does Carl Craig's mix album. Despite the apparent handicap of having the
    Shadow roster to pull from, Craig makes <i>Onsumothasheeat</i> an enjoyable
    study in future funk and electro-jazz. Sometimes we don't even notice that
    he's dropping in some of his own label's material. The Shadow tracks he mixes
    showcase the adventurous A&amp;R; policy the label has been adhering to. Indeed,
    the reason for Shadow's recent sweet perfume is their willingness to license
    underground tunes from boutique labels. Chief amongst these is Jamie Odell's
    Freerange label, a compilation of which Shadow recently released under the
    title <i>Scrambled</i>.</p><p>
    Craig takes a couple of scoops from the Freerange catalog, beginning
    <i>Onsumothasheeat</i> with ""Wild Light"" by Jamie Odell's alter ego,
    Jimpster.  Between LB's (aka Atom Heart) datacore versions of James Brown's
    ""Superbad"" and Prince's ""The Future,"" Craig slides the psychedelic soul-jazz
    of Marasma's ""I Have Got Garlic Hanging on My Front Door"" and Goo's giddy
    deck-cutting ""The O.G."" Craig's sequencing skills and innate musicality
    ensure that what sounds jarring on paper flows more plausibly than an
    Internet gay porn rumor about Tom Cruise.</p><p>
    The second half of <i>Onsumothasheeat</i> takes a beatfreakier route--
    Reginald Craig's ""Second Wind"" is jacking techno hijacked by instrumentally
    violent daycare infants, whose frenzy slips into the cello-baiting and
    vibes-thrashing Japanese jazz of Shinju Gumi's ""Hide and Seek."" Then follows
    the definitive Detroit dub'n'drum'n'bass'n'Joe Zainwul jazz concoction,
    ""Landscaping"" (it's tougher than Craig's own ""Bug in the Bassbin"").  The track
    lulls us with its subdued skronk until the pills kick in and we're careening
    around, our synapses zapped in a battery of rimshots, echoed sub-bass, and
    flashbacking vibes washes.</p><p>
    Nothing could follow ""Landscaping,"" but Shadow's flat-footed Droid sure try.
    Their contribution, ""Poly Bell,"" was snipped from their <i>NYC D-N-B</i> album.
    The juxtaposition confirms what I already knew from subjecting myself to their
    record: Droid's Hot Pockets variant on Jon Hassell's treated trumpet and
    Grooverider's beats plain sucks!  Hey!  I don't care if the sweeping
    ambitronics and pedestrian I-think-this-is-what-a-Robbie Shakespeare-bassline-sounds-like
    are all performed live.  So's me laying a turd.  And that, my friends, also
    ain't worth recording. So after Droid embarrass themselves for seven minutes,
    Craig gives us the three minutes of Sneakster's Ethan Allen electro-dub track,
    ""Twisted,"" to settle ourselves before concluding with Marasma's fusion
    phantasmagoria, ""The Bed and the Window.""</p><p>
    By virtue of Craig's precise selecting skills, <i>Onsumothasheeat</i>
    desultorily skips over the big-room clichés that far too many DJs mix into
    their discs-- no ""exclusive"" (read: previously rejected) remixes of Moby's
    ""Porcelain""; no grand-standing anthems to distract you.  Though he does toss
    in a couple of sub-par tracks, on balance Craig deserves loony praise, since
    <i>Onsumothasheeat</i> divines unsuspected depth and artistry within vague
    recesses of the Shadow.</p></div>"|1654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1654-onsumothasheeat/|7.7|Paul Cooper

    It's practically brainwashing, isn't it?  Daft Punk seem to be operating under
    the premise that if you hear something enough times, you'll start to believe
    it.  But after more than 15 listens to <i>Discovery</i>'s first single and
    opening track, ""One More Time,"" vocodered vocalist Romanthony doesn't have me
    ""feeling the need,"" much less not waiting, celebrating, and dancing so free.
    This could just be me, of course.  Maybe I just haven't taken enough ecstasy
    and horse tranquilizers to appreciate the tinny, sampled brass ensemble, the
    too-sincere ""chill out"" midsection, or the fat drum machine beats that throb
    in time with my headache.</p><p>
    
    Few things are more incriminating than Daft Punk's own lyrics, which, while
    generally deeper than ""don't stop the dancing,"" rarely go beyond sensitive
    junior high poetry and ""could this be love"" Whitesnake-isms.  But music like
    this wasn't meant to be judged on its lyrics.  And since <i>Discovery</i>
    relies heavily on the French neo-disco stylings established by 1997's
    <i>Homework</i>, the duo would probably suggest we shut up and dance.</p><p>
    
    In truth, <i>Discovery</i> rarely invokes its predecessor's slap-bass funk,
    and few other tracks resemble the obviously single-designed ""One More Time.""
    Instead, Daft Punk focus on fusing mid-80's Kool and the Gang R&amp;B; beats with
    post-millennial prog flourishes and more vocoders than you can shake at Herbie
    Hancock.  Of the six tracks that feature vocals, four are smothered with the
    synthesized pitch corrector.  On tracks like ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,""
    the duo make it work by pushing the instrument to its breaking point, squeezing
    out subhuman glips and merging the vocals into a Vai-style synth-guitar solo.
    But when the band relies on the tool merely as a gimmick, as on ""Digital Love""
    and ""Something about Us,"" the sentimental love songs come off with all the
    heart-melting earnestness of Kid Rock's ""Only God Knows Why.""</p><p>
    
    Daft Punk typically succeed in an instrumental environment, though.
    <i>Discovery</i>'s first big score comes with the rousing ""Crescendolls.""
    The obscure Imperials sample makes the song with spirited ""hey's"" and
    ""everybody y'all's"" yelled out from a crowd.  ""Superheroes,"" which draws
    its repeated refrain from a late 70's Barry Manilow track called ""Who's Been
    Sleeping in My Bed,"" sates with a massive, fist-pumping kickdrum, complex
    chord changes, and light-speed keyboard bleeps.  The snapping percussion and
    <i>Phantasy Star II</i> phaser synths of ""Verdis Quo"" recall a somber
    <i>Flashdance</i>-era Giorgio Moroder.  And the 16-bit pitch-bent tones and
    Klymaxx electro-bass of ""Short Circuit"" would have felt at home on Trans Am's
    <i>Surrender to the Night</i>.</p><p>
    
    Prog and disco have never openly begged for their own hybrid, but the genres'
    newborn Frankenbaby is alive, whether we like it or not.  Still, this beast,
    however grotesque, is relatively harmless-- rather than running amok in the
    village and snapping the necks of civilians, it only wants to ""celebrate and
    dance so free, one more time.""  Just don't let it sing.</p></div>"|2134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2134-discovery/|6.4|Ryan Schreiber

    of indie rock, Vic Chesnutt's biggest supporter, and fan-friendly (to a fault).

    slump and streak, she still keeps up the high baseline output that justifies
    contracts the size of Denmark's gross national product.  You get what you pay

    guitar-vox-barstool aesthetic nicely and efficiently.  Little else is
    required.  No electric rockers to bring down the house.  Alas, poor
    Muses, we knew them well.</p><p>
    
    Like anyone who spends too much time in the studio over the years, Hersh
    has logged enough hours tinkering with other instruments to arrive at the
    point where she can proudly add that liner note to the effect that ""all
    instruments [were] played by"" you-know-who.  Diminutive, but mom-tough,
    Hersh casually cusses her way through a baker's dozen songs that are as
    personal as ever, and far less cryptic than in the past.  Her voice remains
    creaky and pregnant with emotion, matched against her signature bright-toned
    Collings guitars.</p><p>
    
    ""White Suckers"" is representative of this slight reinvention of solo Hersh.
    Moving from the plodding and fingerpicked verses, the song metamorphasizes
    with a trumpet player (Kristin?!) shifting into uptempo gear for a
    California-dreamin' chorus sporting fractured words like: ""You come off like
    a distant moth, aimless and driven.""  The once-a-disc ""'Gazebo Tree' moment""
    comes early in the album, this time with the sublime ""Spain,"" a hissing
    crescendo of organ, melody and vowels.  The innocuous opening slowly seethes
    into a classic Kristin barrage, belting out lines like: ""Sucking down mother's
    milk/ Singing my throat away/ It's not an awful secret, you know/ It's just a
    secret.""</p><p>
    
    A moving cover of Cat Stevens' ""Trouble"" is a welcome curveball, prompting a
    little more campfire-style swaying and head-bobbing in the audience than
    normal (i.e. none).  ""Ruby,"" the album's highlight, has an accessible pop
    elegance.  Uplifting, oscillating ooh's lounge amid major key chordal melodies
    and equestrian drumming.  Lyrics shine white-hot with a burning-magnesium
    bright light: ""This baby's like a winter bird/ Raunchy and sweet/ With
    snowflakes melting in his hair/ The boys are supermen wondering...""  Hersh's
    reputation and strength-- being off-kilter lyricwise and left-field musicwise--
    almost feels like a nephew of a song rather than a child of her own.  Ah, but
    there's a saving grace bridge that affords us a few moments of familiar
    <i>University</i>-ish unpredictability.</p><p>
    
    The few faults of <i>Sunny Border Blue</i> occur during the rare songs when
    Hersh goes on autopilot.  Put the thumbscrews to me and I'd admit that ""Summer
    Salt"" sounds like so much filler.  ""Candyland"" feels non-specific to the record
    and could have appeared innocuously on any of her solo efforts without seeming
    invasive.  But in the long view, such sniping seems pretty lame when taken in
    the context of the disc's assets, which are nearly every song.</p><p>
    
    At this point in her Methuselan career, Hersh has no one left to surpass but
    herself.  That can be challenging enough, given her tendency to meet and
    exceed expectations with alarming regularity.  Anyone familiar with her entire
    <i>corpus</i> gets the sense that she'd have to work a hell of a lot harder to
    put out a bad album than a good one.  The world is jealous.</p></div>"|3839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3839-sunny-border-blue/|8.0|John Dark

    ""good guys"" by the female species.  The nice guy is a sort of once-removed
    son, plagued by an acute insight into society-- a society that allows just
    enough room for him to be ""sensitive.""  Of course, if boundaries are
    overstepped even slightly, say by a penchant for Oprah Winfrey or gardening,
    a ""nice guy"" runs the risk of societal emasculation, being called the worst
    of epithets: a pussy.</p><p>
    Misguided attempts at DuBoisian theory aside, I often find myself in such a
    bind, unsure if a love for Jeanette Winterson's outrageously flowery prose is
    indeed offset by Milan Kundera's slightly spacier, though equally ornate
    writing. (Intuition tells me it doesn't.)  Regardless, being in this
    semi-fragile, self-important state, I'm completely honest when I say there's
    no mistaking the Norwegian duo Kings of Convenience as two gigantic pussies.
    I realize that this isn't kosher and that I'm adhering to unfair and ultimately
    oppressive constructs of gender roles.  That doesn't change the fact that the
    Kings are the pansiest musicians this side of James Taylor.</p><p>
    The duo, Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe, revel in their softness.  The
    musical framework they adopt is a sparse brand of acoustic folk more akin to
    the work of Nick Drake than just about anyone of the myriad artists to which
    Drake is compared.  And if there's a curious novelty to listening to a release
    on Source/Astralwerks bereft of electronic tinkering, it wears off before the
    first listen ends.  The formula of acoustic arpeggios, light drumming, tender
    pianos, and the occasional subtle horn or string section makes for an album
    that's as slight and gentle as Saltines and mineral water.  The boys never
    deviate from this, and thus <i>Quiet is the New Loud</i>, inane title and all,
    never reaches higher than saccharine easy listening.</p><p>
    With midtempo breezes like ""Winning a Battle, Losing the War,"" and ""Little
    Kids,"" these innocuous sweetie-pies floss their knack for penning delicate,
    pretty songs.  Of course, wispiness can't be beaten off for long when lines
    like, ""Even though I'll never need her/ Even though she's only giving me pain/
    I'll be on my knees to feed her/ Spend a day to make her smile again,"" come
    a-sucking.  The lyrics here are pitiable to the degree of laughter, and far
    more likely to encourage hysterics than introspection.</p><p>
<i>Quiet is the New Loud</i>, as with any record, has its highlights. ""Singing
    Softly to Me"" and ""The Girl from Back Then"" are parts one and two of the same
    song, and both sport a slinky, blue-eyed jazz sound akin to Van Morrison's
    <i>Moondance</i>.  ""Summer on the Westhill"" is notable if only for its vocal
    melody which bears intense similarity to Klymaxx's ""Meeting in the Ladies
    Room.""  Whether or not this was intentional is anyone's guess, but hearing
    echoes of an '80s disco-cheese anthem cushioned in wistful folk music makes
    for a nearly fascinating dynamic.</p><p>
    Though equally somber and flighty, Erlend and Eirik wisely keep the vocal
    melodrama to a minimum; the only instance of intentionally affected singing
    comes during ""The Weight of My Words,"" when Erlend repeatedly belts, ""The
    weight of my words/ You can't feel it anymore.""  It's a rare agonizing moment
    that illustrates just how Herculean an effort listening to Norwegian nancy
    boys whimper testiculessly can be.</p><p>
    It's important to note the inclusion of simultaneous guitars, played by both
    members, as well as almost uniformly sung vocals.  Erlend and Eirik spend the
    bulk of the album in unison, when they're not harmonizing.  The set-up reminds
    us of another folk duo, this time of the American persuasion: the Indigo Girls.
    As if it were even a question, <i>Quiet is the New Loud</i> gives strong
    indication that if the duos were to come to blows (hopefully, over what
    constitutes ""true"" folk music), Amy Ray and Emily would kick some major
    Scandinavian ass.</p></div>"|4448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4448-quiet-is-the-new-loud/|5.2|Richard M. Juzwiak

    premise of the album is to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it.
    Oh, come on. Now the premise of this album is, well, the dance, actually,
    dance business. The highest definition ever achieved in recording. I'll even
    tell you what two of the secret ingredients are: pure electronic modern
    electronics. That'll make 'em happy! Oh, look at 'em, they want to get up
    and dance! Let's have a party, we gonna go swinging! I'm gon' fuck the
    whole world up! Hahahaha, I'm so full of ideas, and here's a good one!""</p><p>
    
    If that were a quotation from one person, you might well think that they were
    a raving lunatic or schizophrenic. ""Those,"" you would probably say, ""are the
    ravings of a lunatic schizophrenic!"" Well, the above quotation can be found
    in ""The Premise,"" the slick introductory track on Wagon Christ's fourth
    album, <i>Musipal</i>. And although it's culled from all sorts of different
    sampled spoken voices, it feels as if it's been transferred from the personal
    schizo thoughts of mastermind Luke Vibert to his flexible fingers. I can't
    vouch for his sanity or any lack thereof, but the man is pretty full of ideas,
    and I'll be goddamned if the ones found on <i>Musipal</i> aren't good ones.</p><p>
    
    Vibert hasn't created an incredibly innovative record, by any means.
    References can be made from the smooth and dirty grooves of DJ Shadow and
    UNKLE to the jungle agitation of Squarepusher to full-on dementia, either
    giddy (Kid Koala) or sinister (Aphex Twin). But <i>Musipal</i> is so stocked
    with variety and, moreover, actual fleshed-out substance, that it manages to
    bypass the simple ""wacky"" status of Vibert's previous release as Wagon Christ,
    1998's <i>Tally Ho!</i>  This record has moods-- some unnerving, some smooth,
    dark, mechanical, choppy, bouncy, funky, soulful, and even back to wacky,
    occasionally, all whenever Vibert sees fit.  And each of these elements help
    create the perfected Wagon Christ formula: an unpredictable mixed bag that
    comes out even, regardless of how many contents are shifted.</p><p>
<i>Musipal</i> has more than a couple standout tracks, but out of those, its
    holy trinity comes during its first half. ""Natural Suction"" is Vibert's only
    full-on journey into jungle and drum 'n' bass beats this time out, and pad
    synths and strings complement the jittery grooves nicely. The title track
    follows, flowing modestly and effortlessly with the inclusion of a shuffling
    hip-hop beat, squawking horns, and a duet of bluesy lead guitar and whistling.</p><p>
    
    Up to this point, <i>Musipal</i> would be perfect for your next social
    occasion. That is, until the unsettling and dark beats of ""It is Always Now,
    All of It is Now"" come in.  Despite it being the album's obvious highlight,
    it's probably a bit too paranoid for the houseguests.  Dark synths and
    orchestra hits punch through the ranting of a madman-- possibly Vibert
    himself-- whispering and mumbling through a distortion filter and squealing
    feedback.</p><p>
    
    There are plenty of flavors for anyone on <i>Musipal</i>, although the record
    as a whole may be <i>too</i> diverse for some, if that's possible. In my book,
    diversity is a plus. If there's one thing Luke Vibert can do well, it's
    everything at once.  He seems to mock himself by starting his album with
    a track called ""The Premise"" and then never fully being able to explain it. It
    may be that he'll never decide on a certain premise, or idea, or concept;
    consequently, he'll probably never cover the same ground quite the same way
    twice.  And the schizophrenia and variance that is Wagon Christ has finally
    controlled itself just enough to avoid sounding piecemeal. <i>Musipal</i> is,
    as of now, the quintessential Wagon Christ record, and its only preconceived
    purpose is one of simply letting you have fun while trying your damnedest to
    find one.</p></div>"|8555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8555-musipal/|8.0|Spencer Owen

    Hatfield/Strohm from ""Disappear""</i></p><p>
    
    As steam-fired pistons power the magnetic oscillator and the clocks run
    backward, we don't have to wonder why Juliana Hatfield is returning to this
    pivotal moment in history. It's not to undo the breakup of her old band, the
    Blake Babies. Hell, going solo did wonders for her career. No, she's going
    back in time to nix a bad boyfriend and make him ""Disappear."" Sure, back in
    the future, the Blake Babies are reuniting for a one-album project.  But all
    that really matters is boy trouble.</p><p>
    
    In the late 80's and early 90's, the Blake Babies emerged from the Boston
    underground to release some post-punk pop that earned them good reviews and
    album sales. The band featured the breathy Hatfield, a young bassist with an
    appealing girlish hitch in her voice. The music was catchy and charming, if
    unexceptional in the long run. Of course, like so many bands, the Blake Babies
    didn't have a long run. Hatfield went solo and became an MTV darling, hitting
    the same market that bought Letters to Cleo records. The two other Babies,
    guitarist John Strohm and drummer Freda Boner (aka Freda Love, and now, Freda
    Love Smith), formed Antenna, then Velo-Deluxe and the Mysteries of Life.</p><p>
    
    Now the trio is back with another album of somewhat charming and unexceptional
    tunes.  How come?  Obviously, their schedules were all open.  It's clear in
    the music, which features the passion and inspiration that can only stem from
    having nothing better to do.</p><p>
    
    It's tempting to see the reunited Blake Babies as just another repackaging
    of Juliana Hatfield, who, along with performing solo, has also fronted the
    Juliana Hatfield Three and Juliana's Pony.  The songwriting credits on <i>God
    Bless</i> attempt disprove this notion, but if Strohm and Smith truly
    collaborated on the record, I'm in the dark as to why it sounds so much like
    <i>Become What You Are</i>.  This may be an unfair assumption, since Hatfield
    has always dominated the band, but with the other members on autopilot, there's
    very little to distinguish this record from recent Hatfield solo outings.</p><p>
    
    What's more, the Blake Babies spend themselves early on.  After the catchy boy
    basher, ""Disappear,"" ""Nothing Ever Happens"" kicks in with guitars that sound
    less like grinding rocks than cellophane being crinkled.  Still, the song
    displays a pop flamboyance that works in the band's favor.  The standout, a
    cover of the Madder Rose b-side ""Baby Gets High,"" uses chord plucking similar
    to the Troggs' ""Love is All Around"" to underscore a weary acceptance of a
    loved one's debauchery, which from Hatfield sounds like a confession. Nothing
    happening and drugs are revisited themes on this album, as is faking it in a
    song, which they unfortunately address twice, on ""Civil War"" (""When you don't
    have anything to say you can make it up"") and ""On"" (""I never did you wrong/
    But it makes a better song""). The band could use better subjects, and for
    creative purposes, if not their health, a cleaner lifestyle.  Or at least
    better drugs.</p><p>
    
    The fourth track, ""Waiting for Heaven"" is the album's prettiest. It shows how
    just a couple perfectly chosen notes can create a transcendent moment. When
    Hatfield skips up to her higher register to sing, ""I'm on a wave coming down
    from a beautiful face,"" that ""I'm on a wave"" is a surgical insertion of heaven.
    Unfortunately, the rest of the album lies in limbo between midtempo pop and
    mediocre balladry, and as such, Hatfield's breathy words evaporate into the
    ether.  What I'm trying to say is, the needle on the quality meter never jumps
    above ""pretty good.""</p><p>
    
    Guitarist John Strohm penned a couple of competent numbers to sing. He seems
    obsessed with blissful love and optics on both ""Picture Perfect"" and ""Invisible
    World."" Even former Lemonhead Evan Dando (interesting music trivia: the
    Lemonheads were once huge! No one knows why! It's speculated that the
    ""alterna-hunk"" constituent factored heavily) gets to sing an obligatory duet
    with his former lover, Juliana.  Long ago, at the peak of their affair, their
    chemistry was undeniable; ten years later, their voices are a horrible mismatch,
    like butterflies and tennis balls trying to fly together.</p><p>
    
    The magnetic oscillator slows and stops. The clocks start spinning the right
    way again.  We are back in the present. An old boyfriend has been murdered,
    and an old band reunited.  How will these changes affect history?  The Blake
    Babies step through the clouds of steam with wondering expressions on their
    faces, only to find that the space-time continuum has corrected their every
    move. It's as if the entire journey never happened.</p></div>"|789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/789-god-bless-the-blake-babies/|6.9|Dan Kilian

In the process, he     morphed into a true road warrior, endlessly crisscrossing the barrooms and     honky-tonks of America, carving out a niche, and turning out a live-to-two-track     album every year or so.</p><p>His last two full-lengths with The Catholics were reasonably well-crafted and     invigorating, though it's hard not to miss the wild creativity of the Pixies     or his early solo work. By now, though, even Frank may be chafing at the     limitations of their bar-band sound, staunch as he is in refusing to do     overdubs or even edits in the recording process.  Fortunately, there are     just enough tweaks to that process this time out to enliven the resulting     album, making it his most diverse and listenable since <em>Teenager of the     Year</em>.</p><p>The most notable change on this record is the induction of his former producer     and keyboardist, Eric Drew Feldman, to The Catholics, a veteran of Captain     Beefheart's Magic Band and Pere Ubu.  His contribution mainly consists of     tasteful grand piano and Hammond organ, though the odd Rhodes piano or synth     flourish crops up now and then.  Fellow Magic Band alumnus Moris Tepper and     ex-Pixie Joey Santiago also turn up to play guitar on the record.  The result     is that Frank gets to flesh out his songs with an expanded sonic palette.     And while neither as polished as his self-titled debut or as sonically diverse     as its follow-up, <em>Dog in the Sand</em> adds a much-needed freshness to the     proceedings.  Producer Nick Vincent keeps everything crisp and tidy, with as     many as eight people playing on any given track.</p>
<p><em>Dog in the Sand</em> plays as a true classicist rock 'n' roll album, without     resorting to cliches or sounding reactionary.  The main reference point seems     to be <em>Exile on Main Street</em>-era Stones and early Bowie, and all the     tracks share a rootsy feel, accented by Rich Gilbert's frequent use of a     pedal steel guitar.  Luckily, there are enough stylistic flourishes to keep     things interesting.  The opener, ""Blast Off"", begins like your typical slow-paced     Catholics track before shifting into Black's most peppy and angular riff in     years.  His lyrical genius makes appearances, too, with lines like, ""I'm in a     Beckett trance from all the chemicals.""  Still, the track drags on just a bit     too long, making one regret that no edits were allowed.</p>
<p>""I've Seen Your Picture"" magnifies the Rolling Stones influence; when Black     pronounces ""away"" in the chorus as ""uh-waayy-yeee,"" he's a dead ringer for     Mick.  ""Robert Onion"", which features Joey Santiago on guitar, comes the     closest to the good ol' Boston post-punk, though it sounds more like Mission     of Burma than his former band.  And the irrepressibly hooky ""If It Takes All     Night"" demonstrates exactly the kind of purity and spirit that one might hope     to capture in a live environment.</p>
<p>Frank Black indulges his obsession with obscure bits of California and Los     Angeles history in his ode to California's first Socialist collective on     ""Llano del Rio"", as well as the excellent ""St. Francis Dam Disaster"", which     recounts an early 20th century incident that resulted in a wall of water     cascading 53 miles across the California countryside to the sea.  On the     latter, Black counts down the miles as the water devastates thousands, and     Feldman's piano work gives it a tragic feel.  Often, though, Black's lyrics     remain willfully obscure, as Frank eats dictionaries for breakfast.</p>
<p>Black has made comments recently that indicate he doesn't consider the     Catholics his ""permanent"" backing band.  Though this record is hardly a     sonic breakthrough, at no point does it sound exactly like anything he's     done before.  It's refreshing if only because he hasn't allowed himself to     become stuck in a rut, and because it dispels the feeling that he might have     been growing complacent.  Though there's no denying his most groundbreaking     days are probably over, it's nice to know that his future still promises to     be anything but predictable.</p>

When they broke
    onto the scene, they had all kinds of <i>Spin</i>-worthy selling points: they
    were teenage girls still in high school; they all wore the same t-shirts,
    emblazoned in busty 3-D with their ""Donna initials""; and they played music
    that was always able to be succinctly summarized as ""band <i>x</i> meets
    band <i>y</i>.""  People fawned over the Donnas' image more than the music
    the girls produced-- and by all rights, they should have become bigger than
    they have, based on America's love affair with style-over-substance.</p><p>
    
    Most people overlooked the best thing about the group, though: they successfully
    appropriated the sounds of the testosterone club.  Not exactly like the riot
    grrls, who famously hijacked the <i>attitude</i> of boys-only punk, but in
    their own more invasive way.  The Donnas were like geologists exploring the
    deepest strata of hard, heavy rock, and forcibly carved their niche out of
    granite-sized preconception and prejudice in that gender-imbalanced world.</p><p>
    
    People-- especially music journalists-- seemed to forget that the Donnas'
    initial Ramones-clones sound gradually yielded in favor of 70s and 80s
    metal plagiarism.  Each release inched them further away from the fun
    three-chord punk spirit that made such an initial impact.  And now, with
    the arrival of this year's <i>Turn 21</i>, their fourth full-length, The
    Donnas have become the male nurses of American beer-fueled heavy metal,
    in danger of digging their own rut so deep that they won't even be able to
    peer over the edge, let alone ever escape it.</p><p>
    
    Every song drips with bawdy attempts at sexual promiscuity.  But just
    Vince Neil screaming ""girls, girls, girls"" and name-checking strip bars is
    unlikely to whip a woman into a frenzy of <i>amour</i>, The Donnas attempt
    to titillate and fail miserably.  Lines like, ""You pulled me over and
    I pulled you in/ C'mon, officer, let's go for a spin,"" from ""Police Blitz"",
    and the blunt metaphor, ""Let's play ball, we don't need a court/ Just you
    and me, baby, full-contact sport,"" in ""Play My Game"" feature all the
    eroticism of <i>The All-New Three's a Crowd</i> with Alan Thicke.  The
    Donnas are boring for the same reason pornography is: a boggling lack of
    subtlety mixed with crudeness.</p><p>
    
    ""Little Boy"" is the most enjoyable track, mainly because it has more of an
    early Donnas sound, and because the lyrics are funny in that bad-sitcom kind
    of way.  Evidence: ""Have you ever even tried to use a comb/ I think you might
    be missing a chromosome/ 'Cause you keep coming back for more.""  The only other
    song worth a mention is the first single, ""40 Boys in 40 Nights"", which sounds
    like Kiss at their best (but still Kiss, y'know).  Its melody dives and surfaces,
    and the diesel-chug of the guitars bursts into riff-as-punctuation at just the
    right times.  The lyrics are right in line with the rest of the album: ""Spendin'

    In keeping with their trend of covering a metal classic, the girls turn in a
    perfectly humdrum treatment of Judas Priest's ""Living after Midnight"". Without
    improving or reinventing it, there remains little reason to even include it,
    other than to give the listener a glimpse of their influences and favorites.
    Really, girls, there was no need to tell us-- it couldn't be more obvious.
    As for the rest of the disc, try not to get lost in the crowd.  It would be
    futile to attempt identifying the low points, as each same-sounding song after
    song is as forgettable as it is mediocre.</p><p>
    
    The biggest disappointment is that the title implied we were going to get
    older, wiser Donnas.  For a young adult, turning 21 is a milestone; a time
    when their perspective on life changes, and society has no choice but to
    finally regard them as an adult.  I may have held out a little glimmer of
    hope that The Donnas' <i>Turn 21</i> was going to be a similar landmark
    turning point in their maturation as a band.  But not everyone who turns
    21 is the beneficiary of a sudden boost of the maturity hormone, and The
    Donnas are still playing some pretty juvenile rock 'n' roll.</p></div>"|2419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2419-turn-21/|4.9|John Dark

The grand prize for, ahem,
    straddling this line, doubtless goes to the Japanese.  Just tune into ""Pokémon""
    or their other bizarre, anime-tinged creations for proof.  Pikachu might strike
    you as a cute, cuddly companion, but piss him off and he'll zap your ass faster
    than you can drop $2000 on his limited-edition trading cards.  Not that I'd
    know or anything.</p><p>
    While the Japanese may lay claim to the crown for traumatizing our children by
    mixing the harmless with the violent and disturbing, Kindercore runs a close
    second. That Masters of the Hemisphere disc may have seemed like a fun-lovin'
    romp through innocuous twee-pop fields.  But its horrid combination of bad
    music, bad art, and mind-bendingly illogical storytelling had many listeners
    in a fetal position, begging for the sweet release of death.</p><p>
    Luckily, Kindercore is home to one band that's managed to put the blurry
    distinction between the darling and the disgusting to use for the powers of
    good, rather than evil: Of Montreal.  As the sappiest, most sugary, and
    probably most talented group on Kindercore's roster, Kevin Barnes and company
    have managed to pump out some of the most sickly sweet pop music in my
    collection.  So sweet, in fact, that it's at times bordered on terrifying--
    a dizzying, disorienting sugar rush that, while probably not very good for
    you, leaves you wanting more.</p><p>
<i>The Early Four Track Recordings</i> is a collection of demos-- mostly
    recorded by a solo Kevin Barnes before Of Montreal released any official
    material-- with each track incorporating Dustin Hoffman into its title.
    It's also packaged in a jewel case that contains images of psychotic
    children in chains, mole-birds, and bizarre skull creatures.  What the hell?
    Luckily, the music contained within is less alarming.</p><p>
    In fact, <i>The Early Four Track Recordings</i> may very well be the least
    cloyingly saccharine album released under the Of Montreal moniker to date.
    Kevin Barnes' masterful pop songwriting is in prime form, with the occasionally
    overpowering sound of Of Montreal playing as a full band is replaced by a more
    stripped-down, acoustic feel. Songs like ""Dirty Dustin Hoffman Needs a Bath""
    and ""Dustin Hoffman Thinks about Eating the Soap"" are classic Kevin Barnes:
    peppy, poppy, and slightly insane. ""Dustin Hoffman Quits Bathroom and Climbs a
    Tree"" couples a flawlessly delivered vocal melody with hypnotic backwards
    guitar, resulting in one of the best tracks Barnes has ever committed to tape.</p><p>
    But given that <i>The Early Four Track Recordings</i> is a compilation, it
    comes as no surprise that it's not a particularly even album. ""Dustin Hoffman
    Gets a Bath"" is a bit too corny to be anything but annoying, and much of the
    record's midsection suffers from competent, but not particularly memorable
    songwriting. But while many of these tracks are less than stellar, none of
    the 16 Hoffman-inspired tracks ever approach being unlistenable.</p><p>
    Sometimes lackluster songwriting aside, <i>The Early Four Track Recordings</i>
    is a must for fans anxiously awaiting the upcoming <i>Coquelicot Asleep in the
    Poppies</i>, and a perfectly good starting point for those who might find Of
    Montreal's over the top pop intimidating.  Whereas Of Montreal's proper albums
    can leave you with a pounding ice cream headache, <i>The Early Four Track
    Recordings</i> gives you almost all the goodness with none of the harmful side
    effects.</p></div>"|5951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5951-the-early-four-track-recordings/|7.3|Matt LeMay

So overlooked, so underappreciated. Look how it sits,
    looking so innocuous, so pure. Its warm, rich tones and angelic harmonics
    tell a story of innocence and chastity. But its seductive curves, its smooth
    metallic hardware, and its rock-hard, finely crafted neck tell another story.
    Oh, how it begs to be perverted!  To be slapped, to be twisted, to be warped,
    to be forced into making terrible, alienating sounds.</p><p>
    
    Lightning Bolt bassist Brian Gibson is perfectly in tune with the secret
    language of the bass guitar. He knows all its tricks. He knows when it says
    it's going to call him, and when it <i>really is</i> going to call him. He
    knows that, no matter how harmless it pretends to be, all it wants is to be
    fed back through a 32 bajillion-watt amplifier.</p><p>
    
    Upon first listen, you may be hard pressed to believe that the squealing,
    searing treble tones you're hearing on <i>Ride the Skies</i> are indeed being
    produced by a bass guitar; the idea of scorching riffs being played by a bass
    seemed to bite the dust when Cliff Burton got squashed by his tour bus. But
    on <i>Ride the Skies</i>, Gibson makes his bass do things that would make a
    whore blush, resulting in some of the most distinctive tones ever to be
    produced from the instrument.</p><p>
    
    Brian Chippendale, a drummer and vocalist who's known to impress his audiences
    with small feats of gymnastics between songs, rounds off the dynamic duo of
    Brians that is Lightning Bolt. With a style that's similarly frantic, though
    decidedly more conventional than his fellow Brian, Chippendale completes the
    musical package nicely, intensifying the furious energy that makes <i>Ride the
    Skies</i> so fucking awesome.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the palpable energy that permeates <i>Ride the Skies</i> is Lightning
    Bolt's greatest asset. Sure, this is instrumental rock, but it bears none of
    the sterility of a band like Don Caballero; if this is math-rock, it's math-rock
    made by kids who failed math. Add to this the we-don't-give-a-fuck attitude of
    Boredoms' propensity towards sonic exploration, and Lightning Bolt become a
    force to reckon with.</p><p>
    
    While the band's death metal-meets-free jazz sound is maintained consistently
    well over the course of the record, there are a few highlights that are
    definitely worth mentioning. The album's opener, ""Forcefield"", begins with
    high-pitched, end-heavy squeals that sound like a synthesizer, or maybe a
    guitar being run through some heavy effects pedals.  But certainly not a
    bass.  As the song builds, the quasi-electronic bass sounds give way to
    terrifying blasts of pure fuzz-- a medium that Lightning Bolt manages to
    infuse with distilled energy, making it some of the most convincing noise
    ever to come out of Rhode Island.</p><p>
    
    ""13 Monsters"" sees Lightning Bolt ripping apart schoolyard chants, Brian
    Chippendale's fractured vocals sounding like they're being screamed through
    a megaphone that could use a couple of fresh Duracells. On ""The Faire Folk"",
    Brian Gibson's bass finally sounds like a bass, at least for a little while.
    See, one of the great things about <i>Ride the Skies</i> is that you can never
    expect one sound to stick around for long-- the songs embody a perfect blend
    of spontaneity that, while often repetitive, manages to never become dull.</p><p>
    
    So it seems that Lightning Bolt have managed to do what many would have deemed
    impossible: They've created a hard rock album centered around the bass that
    doesn't suck. But you know the bass always wanted it. It's been begging for
    it all along... secretly. It was only a matter of time before some guys named
    Brian would come along with open ears and fulfill its secret desire to squeal
    and wail at ear-shattering decibels.</p></div>"|4787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4787-ride-the-skies/|8.1|Matt LeMay

    sometimes from one show, sometimes from multiple shows-- along with a couple
    of obscure numbers, and one or two covers in the middle to give it the appearance
    of having more diversity than your garden-variety singles collection.  So what's
    a reviewer to do?  He can't grade the songwriting; that's already been done.</p><p>
    
    Basically, a reviewer judges your traditional live record based on gaps.  For
    instance: what gaps are filled that might have been missing in the original
    recording?  What gaps have been created by thrusting the song into a more
    primitive live setting?  I mean, bands can easily be made to sound like
    competent musicians thanks to recording software, but it's harder to manipulate
    that stuff for live albums, which often reveals the gaps in a band's abilities.
    Of course, bands don't generally decide to pick one of their off nights to
    release as a live album.  And yes, there's the gap between studio quality
    recordings and live recordings, whether it be crisp and vital, or muddy and
    dull.</p><p>
    
    The Apples in Stereo are new to the live album game. Not like I'm surprised--
    it's never seemed like a necessity for these studio-oriented kids.  Available
    as an MP3-only release through eMusic, <i>Live in Chicago</i> is a prototypical
    live affair that feels somehow dissimilar from the rest. It sounds like an
    audience member's well-made DAT recording.  It emanates authenticity and
    innocence, like a band proudly and generously offering a tape of their first
    good gig. ""You can actually hear the vocals very well over the noise,"" says
    leadman and Elephant 6 deity Robert Schneider. ""This is the first time one of
    our live recordings accomplished this."" Rarely has an indie icon sounded so
    earnest.</p><p>
    
    Still, it's time to judge the gaps. First off, on these eight Apples originals
    and one Beach Boys cover, Schneider and the band sound like they're having a
    blast, and the energy is instantly detectable. You can sense it in moments
    like when Schneider breaks into jubilant faux-Van Morrison shouting at the
    end of ""Ruby"", originally from 1999's <i>Her Wallpaper Reverie</i>. Or when
    the band crashes into the hyper-jam guitar solo instrumental bridge on ""Go"",
    off last year's <i>The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone</i>. It's hard to
    help imagining how much better it all would have sounded if you'd been there.
    But you take what you can get.</p><p>
    
    As for what's missing in arrangements and/or production, the Apples usually
    compensate. On ""Dots 1, 2, 3"", the Apples' most driving and least characteristic
    track to date (culled from their 1995 landmark <i>Fun Trick Noisemaker</i>),
    the noisy electronic opener of the original is well interpreted with simple
    stuttering guitars. And in the case of ""Go"", they compensate by not compensating:
    the horn section and heavy drums on the studio version had always been the extra
    weight that pushed the song over the line from fun to annoying; with this live
    version, the band sounds nimble and spontaneous, unfettered by such distractions.</p><p>
    
    And then there's their take on the Beach Boys's ""Heroes and Villains"".
    Unfortunately, the straightforward Apples treatment doesn't really translate
    effectively to tape, even if it would have been a pleasant surprise in person.
    Still, the gaps between <i>Smile</i>-era Beach Boys and Robert Schneider are
    large, to say the very least that could possibly be said.  But they get points
    for covering an honest-to-god great song, and their effective segue from the
    lost Wilson-penned classic into one of their finest tracks, the melancholy ""Get
    There Fine"", off 1997's <i>Tone Soul Evolution</i>.</p><p>
<i>Live in Chicago</i> has the charm of a well-recorded audience bootleg
    sanctioned by the group on one of their best nights. It falls flat at times,
    but rarely; the energy of pretending to be in the audience watching Schneider
    and his bandmates jam through a few well-crafted pop tunes just can't be
    denied.  Enough gaps are even filled to warrant a recommendation.  And as
    the reviewer, I must say, as prototypical live albums go, it turned out to
    be relatively painless.  So there.</p></div>"|253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/253-live-in-chicago/|7.6|Spencer Owen

    songs had already entered the short canon of music memorized by my adolescent
    mind. As I acquired every new piece of Pixies material, I saw songs by other
    bands expunged from my cramped brain.  As I absorbed ""In Heaven"", Big Black's
    ""The Model"" all but disappeared; ""Into the White"" burst in, Dinosaur Jr's
    ""Freak Scene"" ran screaming.  I distinctly remember R.E.M.'s ""The One I Love""
    getting the boot from, of all songs, ""Winterlong"".  And these are just the
    b-sides.</p><p>
    
    I think it goes without saying that the Pixies' b-sides don't make for an
    average, run-of-the-mill outtakes compilation, as many of the songs are
    almost or equally as radiant as the more fortunate tracks that made it to
    the five classics between 1987 and 1991. And if nothing else, this release
    proves that, like Dylan in the 60s and Brian Eno in the 70s, the Pixies
    were the blinding visionaries of the 80s.  Virtually everything they touched
    was groundbreaking and revelatory, leaving one to wish they could only have
    touched more.</p><p>
    
    Although <i>Complete B-Sides</i> isn't actually <i>totally</i> complete,
    leaving out live versions of ""Planet of Sound"" and ""Tame"" from an alternate
    ""Alec Eiffel"" single, everything else is here: 19 tracks, amounting to 48
    minutes of music.  The disc also features classic videos of ""Here Comes Your
    Man"" and ""Allison"" (though the wind-tunneled ""Alec Eiffel"" is curiously
    absent), as well as enlightening, albeit short liner notes for each song.
    And because 4AD is an intelligent label, <i>Complete B-Sides</i> is sequenced
    chronologically. The tracklist is exactly what you'd get if you burned the
    singles for ""Gigantic"", ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"", ""Here Comes Your Man"",
    ""Velouria"", ""Dig for Fire"", ""Planet of Sound"", and ""Alec Eiffel"" to CDR,
    in that exact order, minus the album track that opens each disc.</p><p>
    
    An alternate take of <i>Surfer Rosa</i>'s ""River Euphrates"" opens the record
    with nearly a minute of Joey Santiago's guitar antics, as well as a dynamic
    ending which replaces the fade-out of the original.  ""Vamos"", which appeared
    on both <i>Come on Pilgrim</i> and <i>Surfer Rosa</i>, was always a live
    favorite and usually their set closer: between lead singer Black Francis'
    yelping and Santiago's brutal guitar torturing, this live version is as
    explosive as they come.  But <i>Complete B-Sides</i> truly takes off with one
    of the best under-two-minute songs ever: a live cover of ""In Heaven (Lady in
    the Radiator Song)"" from David Lynch's <i>Eraserhead</i>. Often their encore,
    the song grows gradually louder and louder, ending with one of the band's most
    cathartic moments on record.</p><p>
    
    The disc moves from <i>Surfer Rosa</i>-era to <i>Doolittle</i> with ""Manta
    Ray"", a classic Pixies head-bobber boasting Mexican-style guitar strumming
    and quick, two-note drumming. ""Weird at My School"", as Black accurately notes,
    spotlight the ""hyperness"" that defined so much of the Pixies' work. ""Dancing
    the Manta Ray"", meanwhile, shows the band's surf-rock tendencies, as does the
    sublime ""Wave of Mutilation (UK Surf)"". ""Into the White"" follows with a killer
    bassline and Kim Deal's breathy vocals; the perfect balance of tension and
    release, and one of the real standouts here. The <i>Doolittle</i> era concludes
    with ""Bailey's Walk"", one of the Pixies' slowest and weirdest songs, featuring
    Black Francis in fractured and tortured yowls.</p><p>
    
    The <i>Bossanova</i> b-sides open with drummer David Lovering's tepid ode to
    Debbie Gibson, ""Make Believe"", followed by Deal's beautiful cover of Neil
    Young's ""I've Been Waiting for You"". After ""The Thing"" (essentially an outtake
    from a section of ""The Happening""), we're offered a driving instrumental Frank
    Black wrote at 15.  And the era's rounded out by another gorgeous Neil Young
    cover (""Winterlong"") and ""Santo"", another slow, chanty number straight out of
    a bar scene in El Paso, 1864.</p><p>
    
    ""Theme from 'Narc'"", the first track from the <i>Trompe le Monde</i> years, is
    just that-- a cover of the theme song from the ""Narc"" video game. It's another
    adrenaline-pumping instrumental, displaying the raw, interstellar quality that
    characterized <i>Trompe le Monde</i>. ""Build High"" works as a kind of
    south-of-the-border space-jam, and on the Spanish-sung Graham Gouldman cover,
    ""Evil Hearted You""-- as with the instrumental version of ""Letter to Memphis"",
    which closes the record-- the guitar mimics the lyrics so well you can almost
    hear the ghost of Black Francis departing.</p><p>
    
    When I bought this album the other day, wearing my Pixies shirt by coincidence
    (I swear!), the shave-headed girl behind the counter said, ""Nice shirt.  I
    <i>love</i> the Pixies."" I told her that I already owned all these songs,
    but just had to buy the album, anyway. ""Oh, really,"" she said cautiously,
    as though there were something pathetic about that. ""Maybe there is,"" I later
    thought to myself. But then I looked at my tattered Pixies shirt, so beaten
    and worn it was practically falling off my body, and I thought otherwise. Like
    the music itself, which remains as vital and exciting as it was upon the day
    of its release, I'll never let this shirt go.  Some things you just keep around
    to remind you of your first true love.</p></div>"|6316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6316-complete-b-sides/|9.6|Ryan Kearney

Should prolificacy
    be an unconditionally celebrated trait, or should some consideration be paid to
    audience fatigue? I don't have any hard statistics on this, but I'd guess that
    the average wait between any two full-length releases is about a year and a half.
    It's a long enough period of time to allow one album's hype to grow and fade out,
    and give the fans a bit of a breather before having something new foisted on them.
    It's also probably beneficial to the artist, since it gives them some time to
    fully develop ideas and visions for the next album.  I mention this because
    <i>Bring on the Snakes</i> has come along only thirteen months after the release
    of Crooked Fingers' eponymous debut, which has yet to leave my stereo's heavy
    rotation. And regardless of a desire to be fair toward it, the album still feels
    like afterbirth of its predecessor, a shrugged-shouldered sophomore slump.</p><p>
    
    Eric Bachmann, the main creative force behind Crooked Fingers, has a proven
    track record of continuing musical experimentation; as part of the Archers of
    Loaf and Barry Black, he attempted to develop a different facet of his sound
    on each album.  He certainly wasn't always successful, but there's something
    to be said for the effort.  The first Crooked Fingers album, an outgrowth of
    Barry Black's expanded arrangements, combined with further refinements of
    Bachmann's curmudgeonly lyrical outlook, was just varied enough to avoid
    criticism of being repetitive. But Bachmann was clearly treading on thin ice,
    and with <i>Bring on the Snakes</i>, he falls right through.</p><p>
    
    The saving grace of <i>Crooked Fingers</i> was the small group of friends
    Bachmann assembled for recording, who provided much-needed instrumental
    variation between songs.  On <i>Bring on the Snakes</i>, however, Bachmann
    goes it alone, sticking with a steady stream of fingerpicked guitar, droning
    tones, and sparse percussion. Less interesting arrangements combined with less
    focused lyrics turn the album into one long, generic Crooked Fingers track,
    laying bare the slightness of Bachmann's songwriting formula.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, there are some minor differences between the two Crooked Fingers
    albums, but they're far outweighed by the similarities. ""The Rotting Strip""
    clatters along with Magnetic Fields-like toy-synth noise, and near-optimistic
    lyrics, a first for Bachmann: ""[We] crossed our hearts half-hoping/ That we
    could both quit smoking/ And kick the booze and blow/ And one day go make
    something of ourselves."" His characters-- usually broken-down, self-destructive
    drunks haunted by devils and lost in crowds of strangers-- have started to
    think that there may be a way out of their hopeless lives after all; but it's
    really only a minor development that gets folded into the larger lyrical
    picture, which is still rife with decay and decimation to the point of
    tedium.</p><p>
    
    So while Bachmann's lyrical ideas and melodies creep forward ever so slightly,
    the only thing to take solace in is the occasional odd atmospheric noise or
    unintentional musical reference.  The fingerpicking on ""Devil's Train"" strongly
    recalls Jim O'Rourke's <i>Bad Timing</i>; ""Doctors of Deliverance"" is propelled
    by an oddly clean electronic pulse; and the title track features the subtle
    ticking of a clock, or perhaps the clip-clop of a horse's hooves, to keep
    time.  When it comes down to it, though, <i>Bring on the Snakes</i> remains
    Eric Bachmann's first album that doesn't exhibit a significant musical
    development.  Had more time been allotted to experiment with other techniques,
    or even to just develop the songs, it's conceivable that something better
    might have come out of it.  I guess we'll never know.</p></div>"|1672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1672-bring-on-the-snakes/|6.2|Nick Mirov

Or maybe it's good at its most maudlin. Either way, that's
    Azure Ray. Even visually. Their album cover is simple: just an old, sepia-toned
    photograph of a little girl. She looks like my grandmother as a child. Nostalgia
    and melancholy rub off the liner notes and stain your fingertips. The little
    girl clutches her palms to her ears and wears an inscrutable expression that
    vacillates from pouty to fearful to verge-of-tears, depending on what mental
    angle you hold it at. Or she could just be pressing hard on earphones concealed
    beneath her baby tresses, trying to soak up every bit of this album.</p><p>
    Azure Ray resides on the new Warm label, also home to Eric Bachmann's Crooked
    Fingers output.  Bachmann produced their self-titled debut, and his prints are
    all over it.  Like Crooked Fingers, Azure Ray relies heavily on emotional
    theatrics-- a sort of southern gothic ambience-- and submersion under miles of
    murky mood. The project pairs Orenda Fink, a veteran of Japancakes, Little Red
    Rocket, and Bright Eyes, with a fellow Bright Eyes and Little Red Rocket member
    Maria Taylor. Faux-cult figurehead Brian Causey (of the Causey Way and Man or
    Astro-Man) is also credited with production and some guest musician spots.</p><p>
    Of course, it's hardly original. Azure Ray is extremely pretty, soft,
    easy-on-the-tympanum pop music built around acoustic guitar strumming. If you
    were silly enough to try to delineate an 'indie music aesthetic,' this would
    fall many city blocks outside of it. No fuzz, no feedback, no indigestible
    chords, and all with polished production and solid arrangements. Lap steel
    guitar, cello, violin, church bells, piano, brass, and tape loops all make
    appearances on these eleven tracks.</p><p>
    The meat of these songs-- if something as pretty as Fink and Taylor's singing
    can support such a metaphor-- is, of course, the duo's vocals. Their gentle
    trills manage a good balance between ethereal and corporeal, like an apparition
    you could touch.  It's a great mix between a haunting, somnambulant femininity
    and understated strength.  Sort of Linda Ronstadt, in a way. What's that they
    say about how women are stronger then men because they can withstand the pain
    of childbirth?</p><p>
    The first three songs are the album's strongest. ""Sleep"" features a gorgeous
    vocal line, some backwards guitar, and nice piano accompaniment; the whispered,
    minor-chord melody and background noises of ""Don't Make a Sound"" drown you in
    atmosphere. ""Displaced,"" though, comes away the obvious winner, with a
    suspiciously familiar melody.  So familiar, in fact, that I wouldn't be
    surprised if they'd stolen it.  Not that I'd care, personally, being relatively
    certain that whoever they'd stolen it from couldn't do it one-tenth as nice.
    Again, what can you say except that the singing is haunting and the melody
    exquisite?  It's the platonic ideal of a lullaby.</p><p>
    The eight songs that follow definitely have their moments, even if the contrast
    is noticeable.  ""Another Week"" layers ghostly, effect-laden singing over
    slowed-down Western saloon piano music. It's audio sepia-- not terribly
    provocative but pleasurable nonetheless. ""Rise,"" meanwhile, could be an
    epiphany scene anthem for a John Hughes movie, if he were still making teen
    flicks.</p><p>
    Indie label-ghetto obscurity will keep this from attaining massive popularity.
    But an indie-ghetto habitué such as your self shouldn't have any trouble
    digging up a copy of this. If maudlin but beautiful, expertly crafted pop
    songs keep a room in your heart's hotel (under an assumed name, naturally),
    get with it. You friggin' wuss, you.</p></div>"|400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/400-azure-ray/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    called their new album <i>The Red Threadbare</i>. The perma-posture of
    self-loathing has-- to no one's surprise, really-- almost totally burned
    itself out; consequently the group's dependably rich musical arrangements
    have to work harder than ever now to justify the repetitious circus of misery
    and sexual obsession that's characterized the band to the present.  That's
    the bad news.  The not so bad news is that-- galling lack of novelty and
    progress notwithstanding-- the boys from Falkirk have made another
    better-than-average album.</p><p>
    
    The celebrated songwriting duo of Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton have
    four studio albums under their collective belt.  And they'd have you believe
    you this is their best effort yet. Not so. It's simply on par.  Moffat
    continues to spin his grim little narratives about relationship hell and dead
    sex, and his lyrics are as piquant, morbidly funny, and, of course, sad as
    ever. In ""Last Orders,"" he sings, ""We could pretend that this never started/
    That you're still shy, I'm still broken-hearted/ And we'll get pissed just to
    watch the telly/ I'll get worked up when you flesh your belly."" Aidan always
    clothes the pain of love gone wrong in the most mundane details; his strength
    has always been a knack for capturing those details and presenting them in a
    sympathetic light.</p><p>
<i>The Red Thread</i> offers little in the way of memorable melodies. Moffat's
    voice never has and will never be a ""song"" voice. But as a vessel for his
    ever-lugubrious poems, and as a foil to the florid but coldly impersonal music,
    you couldn't ask for more. In the tension between Moffat's acrid, pained bursts
    of psychological commentary and the alternately pretty and negligible music is
    where Arab Strap gets its most mileage.</p><p>
    
    Two sentences back, I almost wrote ""background music."" Therein lies the biggest
    problem with this band. Not to disparage their music, as much of it borders on
    gorgeous, but if the lyrics sucked, no one would give a shit. Let's be honest
    here: the main allure of the group is their psychological dimension and their
    bleak, haggis-sex-noir storytelling. You can slag a band like Low for making
    the same album over and over, but at the end of the day, it's hard to wear out
    ""pretty."" You can pick up any Low album and enjoy it (if you're disposed to
    that kind of thing), provided you don't listen to several of their albums in a
    short timespan.  Arab Strap, however, leaning heavily on their emotional S&amp;M;
    routine, are bound to run out of tricks sooner than later.</p><p>
    
    This album does indeed have flashes of beautiful music. ""Screaming in the
    Trees"" is the album's sparsest track, eschewing percussion and superfluous
    instrumentation, while drawing on the natural atmospherics of the space
    around Moffat's voice and a lone guitar track.  As if to underscore the theme
    of space, there's an inordinately long silence between the song's end and the
    beginning of the next track.</p><p>
    
    ""The Long Sea"" is <i>The Red Thread</i>'s most magisterial and engaging piece
    of music, building up over five minutes before incorporating fuzzy major chords
    over a minor background. Adele Bethel's voice and horns can be faintly heard
    through the delay-addled din. Both of these songs, as well as ""Infrared"" and
    the cinematic ""Haunt Me,"" feature music that rises to the level of the lyrical
    performance-- but that, more importantly, is of high enough quality to justify
    the endless additions to Moffat's book of misanthropy and self pity.</p><p>
    
    Generally speaking, though, the music offers few surprises this go around,
    relying instead of the tried-and-true guitar arpeggios, atmospheric noises and
    orchestral, rainy-day crescendos.  The album's first UK single, ""Love
    Detective,"" about a guy waiting for his lover to leave for work so he can
    open up her red metal cashbox full of secrets, is typical of the band's
    strengths and weaknesses. The emotional Pandora's box trope, the semi-humorous
    reflection on paranoia and jealousy, and the vignette structure of the lyrics
    are at odds with a lackluster musical foundation that sounds like hybrid of
    the theme music from <i>Rocky</i> and ""Peanuts"" as interpreted by Fiona Apple--
    a combination that spells ""fucking awful"" no matter how drunk you are.</p><p>
    
    I suppose there are equally valid arguments for and against a band like Arab
    Strap. Some people will want to own their entire discography, not because
    there's astonishing variation between the releases or measurable growth as
    time wears on, but rather, for much the same reason people own several Raymond
    Carver novels. Carver's stories are basically all the fuckin' same, and so are
    Moffat's.  Yet, where else can you turn to hear your basest emotions, your
    most abject emotional episodes, or your most petty reflexes celebrated and
    dignified in this way?</p><p>
    
    Moffat's gift for both eulogy and bile, and for making the unpalatable much
    less so is striking, repetition be damned. And maybe some of his appeal
    springs from the lyrical redundancy. Moffat, or at least the persona he
    assumes for Arab Strap, is damned to pushing the slippery boulder of emotional
    self-sabotage up the hill for all eternity like a Scottish Sisyphus, but also,
    so that we don't have to do it ourselves.  It's only music, though, so either
    way, you're still fucked.</p></div>"|270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/270-the-red-thread/|6.9|Camilo Arturo Leslie

They're vibrant
    and dissolute and put French people saying, ""Light, calm and voluptuous,"" at
    the beginnings of their records. They draw on dance music of the most Europop
    variety imaginable. Their lives are full of endless, evanescent pleasures;
    each night a new revolution of the senses. They laugh at people like us,
    dressed like old men and hard to drag out of the house.  That's what they'd
    have you believe, anyway.</p><p>
<i>Nightsongs</i> is, however, a devastatingly intelligent, moving record that
    wants desperately for you to think it's vapid. Stars make lush, keyboard-based
    pop songs that evoke a chronic-depressive Pet Shop Boys, or Stephin Merritt if
    he'd never heard of Bertold Brecht. These songs are short on the sort of cheese
    that typically plagues records of this genre-- horn parts, whispered vocals,
    wordless female backing vocals-- that they're sort of impossibly hip, chilly
    and suave.  Very much the type of thing that one would imagine they play in
    bars that serve martinis in oversized glasses.</p><p>
    
    So why would those of us who may be young, but are otherwise ugly and hate
    dancing-- people who prefer old man bars where no one ever employs a DJ, and
    you never have to dance (unless you find the jingling of Keno machines
    incredibly rhythmic)-- care about Stars?  These are the people we hate,
    right? People who've found a way to morally justify paying more than a $100
    for pants? They're letting those people make records now?</p><p>
    
    They are.  And goddamn it, those records are good.  <i>Nightsongs</i> is
    an outstanding debut record, both in the trebly groove of its beats and the
    anomic fear and loathing of its lyrics. Stars take the dark edge of great
    dance records past-- the best of Chic, say, or Funkadelic, for God's sake--
    and rub your face in it.  This is a group, after all, known well for their
    dance cover of the Smiths' ""This Charming Man,"" another band unusually
    interested in discussing the travails of the young and hip. Still, even when
    dressed in Swedish sneakers and breakbeats, pain is still pain.  And
    <i>Nightsongs</i> has its share.</p><p>
    
    ""Stars on the Ceiling"" equates falling in love with staring-- naturally-- at
    the ceiling, while a blanket of horns mourn beneath the vocal. ""My Radio,"" a
    fine entry in the music-as-salve-for-young-woes genre, lays thudding drum
    machines under languid backing vocals and yet another of the album's
    astonishingly good horn parts, undercutting the wistful quality of the melody
    with a kind of unmentionable malice.</p><p>
    
    Not that they don't get around to mentioning the malice, eventually. ""The
    Very Thing"" might sound a little like Everything but the Girl-- all acoustic
    guitars and chimy piano-- but it's a shockingly close-to-the-bone tale of
    domestic collapse, narrated by a husband and father who can't be categorized
    as heavy or hero: his kid ""put a light in front of [h]im,"" but his wife is,
    apparently, a whore.</p><p>
    
    Like everything here, ""Very"" is toned in shades of grey.  The fear-of-success
    anthem ""Write What You Know,"" and the admiration-unto-envy-unto-murderous-rage
    story of ""International Rock Star,"" are equal parts sugar (Chris Seligman's
    music and arrangements) and spite (Torquil Campbell's English-tinged vocals
    and lyrics). By comparison with the rest of this gallery, even the narrator of
    should-be club hit ""Liar,"" perhaps a serial killer, doesn't come off looking
    all that terrible.</p><p>
    
    All this vaguely satiric venom doesn't tell the whole story, though.  Stars
    aren't Momus with a bigger recording budget any more than they're the American
    Depeche Mode.  There are songs here brimming with string sections and lyrics
    that prove that even people who are let in discos for free sometimes miss
    departed friends. In short, rather than delivering on the slick promise of
    their sound with expected vapidity, <i>Nightsongs</i> is a deeply felt album,
    hidden in what ought to be empty clothes.  As with any good piece of candy,
    there are razor blades hidden within.</p><p>
    
    Stars may be young and good-looking, and they probably don't turn their nose
    up at expensive pants. They get laid so often they can hardly walk. And they
    want so badly to go dancing. They'd probably take you with them if they could
    just get off their knees, brush those goddamn expensive pants off, and stop
    crying their eyes out.</p></div>"|7470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7470-nightsongs/|7.8|Sam Eccleston

    as a central theme within rock music. It's pretty logical, too-- music and
    technology have always been closely intertwined, from the development of the
    pianoforte in the early 18th century to the work of 20th century pioneers like
    Karlheinz Stockhausen and Robert Moog. Though technology has certainly allowed
    musicians to expand their sonic palettes, it seems many are eager to turn on
    it in varying capacities, ranging from the all-out attack of shitty industrial
    music to more subtle protests, such as the insistence on using crusty old
    recording equipment.</p><p>
    
    But Momus (aka Nick Currie) has never been a follower. Over the course of his
    career, he's gone from guitar-based folk music to unadulterated synth-pop to
    ""analog baroque."" And through all this, he's still found time to have a
    plaster cast of his penis made for display at a New York gallery, and write
    top-selling songs for Japan's favorite kinky little girl, Kahimi Karie.</p><p>
    
    With his latest album, Momus seems to have brewed together all the elements of
    his musical history-- including his oft-discussed member-- into the crazy,
    glitchy electro-folk record that he has christened <i>Folktronic</i>. And
    while, at times, Momus constructs a bitingly clever post-modern take on folk
    music, <i>Folktronic</i> has an unfortunate tendency to choke on its own
    concept, rendering the album a bit hard to swallow.</p><p>
    
    ""Finnegan the Folk Hero"" is the greatest success on the album-- a witty,
    entertaining update of a classic theme. The song presents the tale of Finnegan,
    an HTML wiz who's forced into obscurity by lack of pay, set against a backdrop
    of cheap Casio keyboards and drum machines. Musically, as well as lyrically,
    the song has roots in folk music; it's part western, part sea shanty. Momus'
    cheesy instrumentation somehow compliments the music perfectly, and the result
    is just the kind of clever enhanced-folk Momus was aiming for.</p><p>
    
    ""Appalachia"" is another, more eclectic example of <i>Folktronic</i> at its best,
    taking the timeless subject of the ""Appalachian mountain girl,"" and placing her
    in a world of hyperactive drum machines, digital fuzz, and distorted baroque
    synthesizers. The lyrics are not quite as clever as those of ""Finnegan,"" but
    are none the less palatable, and fit the <i>Folktronic</i> theme nicely.
    Further kudos go to Momus for the closing the album with three songs written
    for Kahimi Karie's <i>Journey to the Centre of Me</i> EP: ""Lady of Shallot,""
    ""Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan,"" and the awesomely fucked-up
    Brechtian ""Pygmalism."" Not only are these perhaps the strongest songs Momus
    has ever penned, but they also seem to fit into the record's conceptual mold
    quite well.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, many of Momus' other stabs at the ""Folktronic"" genre fall flat.
    ""Mountain Music,"" a song based on a comment made by Johnny Cash about Beck
    having ""that mountain music in him,"" wants to be a clever commentary on the
    way technology has changed access to different genres of music. Here, though,
    Momus gets a bit caught up in the idea, incessantly dropping names of persons
    (Massive Attack, Beck, and the late electronic innovator Bruce Haack, among
    others), and devices (the Rio MP3 player) alike. Though for the majority of
    the track, Momus pummels you over the head with his concept, he makes sure to
    include a few genuinely witty, amusing lyrics, such as ""'Moon of Alabama' is
    my favorite country tune/ With lyrics by a communist and music by a Jew.""</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Folktronic</i> is similarly mixed. Songs like ""Tape Recorder
    Man"" and ""The Penis Song"" pair clever, funny lyrics with crap music. And much
    of the rest of the album totters the line between simply mediocrity and
    forgettability with a few particularly obnoxious flaws like the '80s-inspired
    ""Robocowboys"" and the awkward, bluesy ""Smooth Folk Singer.""</p><p>
    
    Still, when taken as a whole, <i>Folktronic</i>'s plusses certainly outweigh
    its minuses. This is Momus being Momus; he still sounds like Donovan, and he's
    still as quirky, arrogant, and witty as ever.  Though the record is far from
    the genre-defining landmark Momus likely intended to be, it certainly ranks
    among his better works. My advice to diehard Momus fans: log off
    littlejapanesegirls.com, zip up your pants, and get your ass to the record
    store. The rest of you can take a hint from the man himself: put technology
    to use for you and pull a few tracks off Napster to see if it's your thing.</p></div>"|5387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5387-folktronic/|6.4|Matt LeMay

Though
    they're said to parse each review for illogicalities, flagrant lapses in
    concentration, and general sloppiness, they rarely concern themselves with
    write-ups of indie rock mainstays.  In matters ambient and chill, though, they
    override even the editor-in-chief's judgment.  Why should this be?</p><p>
    
    The copy editors' tasks are so crucifyingly dull that the only way to retain
    a knowledgeable and well-balanced team is to give each editor top-of-the-line
    headphones so that they may enjoy the soothing tones of chill-out discs while
    lazily perusing their articles.  As a result of years of marking up copy
    while submerged in deep, deep chill, the copy editors have gained an acute
    knowledge of their preferred genre.  The department recently voted Coco Steel
    and Lovebomb's Balearic ambient record <i>Sun Set</i> ""the most chamomile disc
    of the 90's.""</p><p>
    
    The department has been defection-free since Nathan Scrote, a fine interpreter
    of Brent DiCrescenzo's prose, left without a word after working himself into a
    caffeinated tizzy over Moby's ""disrespectful"" mixes of Brian Eno's ""Fractal
    Zoom."" But since that wet Wednesday afternoon, the team has remained cohesive
    and love-bound. It's almost as if they'd all drunk of Milton the Monster's
    tincture of tenderness.</p><p>
    
    Well, not quite. Rumors of disruption started up again on the Tuesday that the
    Orb's <i>Cydonia</i> was to be released. The editor-in-chief found fragments
    of vicious pink hi-lighter marker on the boardroom carpet.  Elsewhere, red
    pencil shavings were scattered into Mrs Neshanigan's handbag-- what had the
    <i>Pitchfork</i> eurythmacist done to deserve such treatment?</p><p>
    
    An extensive report from the internal affairs department reported that the
    copy editors had taken premature and violent exception to <i>Cydonia</i>.
    Nonplussed at Aki Omori's vocals and doot-doot-doo's on ""Once Again,"" the
    band's sixth album did not sit well with them.  Their resented prevented
    further listening. In their resistance to anything other than another
    re-rerun of <i>U.F.Orb</i>, they never stopped to admire the breakbeat
    melodica dub of ""Promis"" or the rolling echoes and classically Orb-ular
    processing effects on the lilting ""Ghostdancing.""</p><p>
    
    Recalling <i>Orbus Terrarum</i>'s ""Slug Dub,"" ""Turn It Down"" concludes with an
    excerpt of a knighted Welshman telling tall tales of the local brewery's dark
    and powerful ale that sustained his generation through Nazi bombardment and
    forced rationing. Drifting in, possibly from some moments left off the Robert
    Fripp/Orb collaboration FFWD, ""Egnable"" is a Monty Python-esque monologue
    based on IKEA self-assembly instructions and upholstering manuals. After such
    headspace adventures, the Orb return to clubbier material with the Front 242
    DMT trip of ""A Mile Long Lump of Lard,"" and ""1.1.1,"" which could have easily
    come off Krust's <i>Coded Language</i>. <i>Cydonia</i> closes with the circa
    1989 ""Terminus,"" a lengthy, spaced-out ambient trundle around the universe--
    exactly the type of adventuring that distinguished them over a decade ago.</p><p>
    
    Though <i>Cydonia</i> is far from being a dull, sequencer-heavy Namlook ambient
    release, it regrettably sounds irrelevant in today's climate.  No one will
    deny the importance of the band's first two albums, but by the time they
    released the frighteningly claustrophobic <i>Orbus Terrarum</i>, the glitch of
    Oval and the algorithm of Autechre had turned the electronic scene
    microscopically inward.</p><p>
    
    Out on the dancefloor, Dr Alex Patterson and his cohorts' ""Land of Oz"" chillout
    has little meaning to the kids who've made hard house and trance the world's
    most in-demand genres. The Orb now find themselves creating breakbeat tracks
    that can't fairly compare with the dangerous dark of Dave Tipper or Rennie
    Pilgrem. <i>Cydonia</i> will confuse those who haven't followed the band's
    advice (""An Orb is for life, not just for Christmas"") and grown up with them.
    They'll rightly demand to know why these guys are considered pioneers. While
    it's so tempting to me, a longtime admirer of Dr LX journeying, to find all
    manner of excuses and apologies for the stalled and self-reminiscing <i>Cydonia</i>,
    I have to concede that it may be time for the Orb to make a Mir-like re-entry
    into Earth's atmosphere and collide with a Taco Bell sign in the middle of the
    Pacific ocean.</p><p>
    
    Alternatively, the Orb could cop a few moves from the similarly named Orbital,
    who've managed to remain strikingly meaningful over a similar length of time.
    Orb fans should reflect on why indie-apostates such as Radiohead have turned
    to Richard D James for guidance rather than Dr Patterson, whose love of Pink
    Floyd and Tangerine Dream once seemed to chime perfectly with Radiohead's
    own.</p><p>
    
    The Kosmos would show sublime and gracious irony if some 'Crasher kid, twenty
    years hence, discovered Alex Patterson and decided to give him one more bite
    of celebrity pie, just as Patterson did for Gong's has-been guitarist, Steve
    Hillage. Encouraging such System 7 fantasies is, in fact, the primary
    recommendation of the <i>Pitchfork</i> Internal Affairs Division report on
    the unrest within the copy-editing department.  After a few spins of <i>The
    Water Album</i> and <i>777</i>, staffers' write-ups will once again be freed
    from the stranglehold of pendant participles.</p></div>"|6026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6026-cydonia/|6.1|Paul Cooper

    hyper-catchiness as much as the debut LP from Call and Response.  Initially,
    the five piece's hook-laden record, which lyrically tackles hard-hitting
    issues such as bubble-blowing, rollerskating, colors, and stars with eyes,
    didn't appeal.  It was so cheerful and sunny that I feared my eyes might start
    bleeding.  After a few more listens, though, that potential blood turned to
    the joyous tears that can only result from being charmed by the social
    awareness of five-year-olds.  ""Rad,"" I said during an umpteenth listen,
    between jubilant sobs. ""I'm fascinated by its love.""</p><p>

    seven days to revisit these adorable tykes.  But you know, I don't really miss
    them.  Sure, I'll hum a melody on occasion, or have a giggle over a lyric or
    two, but the impulse to actually listen to the record again never resurfaces.
    Why?  Let's just say top 40 radio does it better, and without the adult-proof
    CandyLand gimmickry.</p><p>
    
    But I suppose this sort of reaction is inevitable when the nature of Call and
    Response's music is taken into consideration.  The band has already been
    likened to the Mamas and the Papas, and the Archies; both are fair enough
    reference points, though I don't recall any white-funk basslines burbling
    under ""Dedicated to the One I Love.""  ""Nightflight,"" for example, plays like
    a suburban take on Jean Knight's ""Mr Big Stuff,"" complete with throwaway
    lyrics like, ""Then I knew/ It was you/ Who had a different point of view/ And
    I paid no mind/ To the soul I lost inside.""  The song is as trite, non-specific,
    and meaningless as anything at the top of the <i>Billboard</i> singles chart.</p><p>
    
    The remaining material is true to the form of ""Nightflight.""  The record's
    opener, ""Blowin' Bubbles,"" is a lite groove that sports male/female vocals
    singing, ""I'm drinkin' stars up in the sky/ You know who you are/ I'm drivin'
    cars around your house/ It seems so far.""  Meanwhile, the chorus of
    ""Rollerskate"" bestows wisdom like, ""Before you learn how to walk/ Before you
    learn how to walk/ You learn to rollerskate/ Hey.""  Call and Response would
    have me convinced that they're just trying to be cute and ironic with lines
    like this if it weren't for the impossibly straightforward vocal and musical
    delivery.  Songs that could be prime examples of well-realized nonsense, a la
    Ween or ""Sifl and Olly,"" simply are not.</p><p>
    
    This makes for an album that's lean, unobtrusive, and largely slight.  The
    songs may be infectious, but this isn't as much a product of fine songwriting
    as an exercise in smart calculation.  I'd be an elitist liar if I said that
    catchy, nothing pop songs don't have the tendency to make me swoon.  Still,
    however strong an immediate visceral reaction may be, awareness of pending
    expiration is essential.</p><p>
    
    Call and Response are a brief flash of enjoyable fluff.  And that may be the
    band's very aim; to create utterly disposable, formulaic echoes of yesteryear's
    pop hits.  Even so, we've already been taught this lesson countless times, and
    it's even more resounding when delivered with sincerity.  Really!  When Andy
    Gibb proclaimed, ""I just want to be your everything,"" millions of girls around
    the world were instantly wooed, praying that his piercing wails were unleashed
    for them alone.  So, Call and Response can wax reminiscent all they want, but
    their unknown status-- in the indie world and otherwise-- suggests that
    nostalgia will never be on their side.</p></div>"|1249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1249-call-and-response/|5.7|Richard M. Juzwiak

    Who could resist a passel of Swiss kids with a jones for punk rock and outfits
    made of newspaper?  Their work is as tart, wry, political, thoughtful and
    exciting as anything to come out of that scene.  At least, so we were told.
    The band's output has been out of print for at least a decade, and, although
    authorities across the cultural landscape have sold the band as the lost grail
    of the punk rock scene, anyone seeking to hear their music had to content
    themselves with occasional used-record finds and the stories related by
    others.</p><p>
    
    The concern that accompanies a reissue like this is, once stripped of the
    mysteries of history and unquestioned praise, how does the band sound? After
    all, encomiums by Greil Marcus carry all the weight in the world when nobody
    can listen to the records and say differently. What's more, how kind will
    history be to a bunch of Swiss kids prone to outbursts of unrestrained
    gibberish and clattery squall?</p><p>
    
    Plenty kind, as it turns out. Liliput, known in less copyright-concerned
    territories as Kleenex, sound very much of a piece with contemporaries like
    Gang of Four and Wire, minus those bands' dour miens. The lumbering,
    funk-with-a-Ph.D-in-gender-studies basslines that spot most records of this
    ilk are in full effect here, and guitarist/singer Marlene Marder declaims in
    that bored-but-purposeful vocal style Rough Trade fans lap up like milk. The
    lyric themes du jour center around social issues in miniature. Here, dates,
    love, and even grocery shopping all take on unconsidered political
    ramifications.</p><p>
    
    Anyone wondering why this lavish, two-disc collection of everything the band
    ever put to tape was issued through Kill Rock Stars will have their doubts
    addressed in short order.  After all, the political, aesthetically adventurous
    punk roster the Olympia-based label was built on seems directly descended from
    Liliput's family tree.  The nascent beginnings of the Sleater-Kinney/Bikini
    Kill/Huggy Bear DNA-chain can be heard here in luminous clarity.</p><p>
    
    What separates Liliput from the pack, as has been noted elsewhere, is their
    giddy sense of Dada humor. The instrumentation on many of these songs has to
    be heard to be believed, overstuffed with the rattles of kitschy percussion,
    the ping of triangles, the hooting of clearly new-to-the-owner horns.
    ""Hitch-Hike"" features hysterically incompetent saxophone accompaniment, with
    the song's hook played on an urgent-sounding traffic whistle. ""When the Cat's
    Away"" prefigures the deceptive innocence of twee-pop by backing up its tale of
    contemporary anxiety with an awkward sounding-polka and outlandish kissing
    sounds.</p><p>
    
    Adding to the good humor of the proceedings, Liliput's patented flair for
    gibberish-- different languages, babble, speaking in imaginary tongues-- pours
    out everywhere. Take the aptly-titled ""Outburst,"" where deadpan verses
    alternate with a chorus composed of glottal grunts and occasional, high-pitched
    birdcalls. Though the band's late-period penchant for dubby-sounding rhythm
    tracks doesn't serve them as well as their earlier punkish urgency, ""Umamm""
    generates menace and charm purely through quiet, wordless growls. Liliput sound
    so excited to be saying anything that even pure, human-generated noise is
    expression enough.</p><p>
    
    Which is probably where this band connect with the Kill Rock Stars' present-day
    celebs. Like the best post-punk, Liliput celebrate the right rock gives to say
    anything, expressing their keen, not-humorless intellects through voices and
    music alike. Their influence can be heard throughout the riot-grrl Diaspora of
    modern times, but Liliput managed one crucial difference: they made radical
    social and aesthetic re-engineering sound like the greatest party you've ever
    been to in your life.</p></div>"|4791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4791-complete-recordings/|9.0|Sam Eccleston

Among them: a tedious     explanation about how what I'm learning in grad school about connectionism     and neural networking somehow applies to Spoon's songwriting methodology     (hint: it really doesn't); a comparison of Spoon to the ugly metallic     monstrosities that pass for public sculpture these days; and a tired parody     of VH1's ""Behind the Music"" (""Spoon: They had it all. And then it all came     crashing down! But now they're back! Etc.""). I ran out of clever metaphors     to describe Spoon's music a while ago. In fact, I don't think I've ever     really captured in writing what it is about Spoon that I like so much. Their     music just seems to possess this attitude that's both fresh and rooted in     the origins of rock 'n' roll, an anger that's at once stylish and direct, a     compassionate ache that's as oblique as it is palpable. And <i>Girls Can     Tell</i> wraps all that is great about Spoon up in a shiny new package.</p>
<p>It's been nearly three years since Spoon's last album, <i>A Series of Sneaks</i>,     rocked heads and broke hearts, and even though the band was without a label     for most of that time, they forged ahead with the writing and recording of     <i>Girls Can Tell</i> anyway. They had more than enough time to get the album     sounding just right, and it definitely shows in the finished product. But an     open-ended recording schedule has its advantages and disadvantages: <i>Girls     Can Tell</i> is more mature and accomplished, but at the expense of the spark     of spontaneity.</p>
<p>Fans of Spoon's mannered sloppiness will most likely be taken aback at their     new sound, one which is significantly spookier and cleaner-sounding, with more     conventionally structured songs. It may be worth noting that John Croslin,     who's produced most of Spoon's output to date and may be responsible for the     more off-kilter ideas on previous albums, is barely present on this album.     Where <i>A Series of Sneaks</i> was a giddy grab bag of intentional loose ends,     <i>Girls Can Tell</i> ties those loose ends up, perhaps a bit too neatly. The     irony, of course, is that this album sounds much more like a major-label     release than <i>Sneaks.</i></p>
<p>But the ""maturing"" of Spoon should by no means be a point of contention.  No,     they no longer sound like the Pixies, Gang of Four or Wire; instead, they     sound like Spoon now. And initially, <i>Girls Can Tell</i> sort of feels like     a recap of Spoon's brightest spots within their oeuvre, recast in a new light.     ""Believing is Art"" uses the insistent eighth-note rhythm of ""30 Gallon Tank"";     ""Lines in the Suit"" recalls the stark living-room production of the ""Agony of     Laffitte"" single; ""Fitted Shirt"" starts where the one-note riff of ""Mountain     to Sound"" left off; ""Anything You Want"" hums with the easy melodic brilliance     of ""I Could See the Dude,"" or ""Metal Detektor,"" or ""Plastic Mylar."" The one     new addition to their sound is a foggy-midnight moodiness enhanced by mellotron,     vibraphone and viola on tracks like ""Everything Hits at Once"" and ""Chicago at     Night""; still, this shift in sound was presaged by ""Change My Life"" off the     recent <i>Love Ways</i> EP.</p>
<p>But any perceived straddling of the line between self-cannibalization and     self-reference is rendered moot on subsequent listens; these songs not only     stand strong on their own, but also complement each other in unexpected ways.     The eerie tones floating throughout ""Everything Hits at Once"" drift into     ""Believing is Art,"" where martial rhythms, Britt Daniel's breathless stuttering,     and even the jarring fuzz riffs that tear apart the chorus do nothing but build     tension until it fades into nothingness.  The tension is finally broken with     the ringing chords that open ""Me and the Bean.""</p>
<p>""Lines in the Suit"" offers the first solid indication of development within     Daniel's lyrics; whereas they were once resolutely abstract and liberally     peppered with odd turns of phrase, here, they point toward concrete emotions     and situations. Written during the fallout from being dumped from their former     label, it's the sound of Britt sitting on his couch, strumming his guitar,     staring out the window and wondering, ""How come I feel so washed up/ At such a     tender age now?""</p>
<p>Daniel may regret some of the decisions he's made in life, but     so does everyone else; eventually, he comes around to remembering that while     being a rock musician may still be a job, it's still better than real work.     Better that than the human resource clerk on her lunch break who says, ""It     could have been good by now/ It could have been more than a wage."" ""Fitted     Shirt,"" the most recognizably Spoon-like song on the album, concerns itself     with a considerably lighter subject; namely, how Britt wishes that shirts     didn't always come in one-size-fits-all proportions.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also songs on <i>Girls Can Tell</i> that are just about,     well, girls. And hanging out. And telling off record labels. On the     heartbreakingly pretty ""Anything You Want,"" Britt pines for the girl that he     knows full well won't work out anyway; on ""Take a Walk,"" he lashes out with     a snarling, swaggering blues riff as he spits, ""Now that song's been sung/     It's just the cost of what's been done/ The cost of talking a walk with you.""     ""1020 AM"" returns to the mooning about, with elegant acoustic guitar and     flutelike organ imparting an almost chamber-music-like aura. ""Take the Fifth""     has nothing better to do than to strut down the strip on a Saturday night,     handclaps and tambourine included.</p>
<p><i>Girls Can Tell</i> slithers to a rather downbeat conclusion with ""This     Book is a Movie,"" a rather incidental instrumental number that wants to     build tension as effectively as ""Believing is Art,"" but doesn't quite get     there; and ""Chicago at Night,"" where the desolate guitar twang seems to     dissolve into a cloud of smoke. It's an ending that seems to echo the     uncertainty of Spoon's existence over the last few years, as if the     continuation of the band is still somehow in question. While Spoon definitely     shows signs of life on this album, it's also clear that their more negative     experiences have changed them irrevocably. It's not necessarily a qualitatively     good or bad change, it's just change.</p>
<p>Digging deeper into <i>Girls Can Tell</i>, I get the feeling that Spoon is     trying to reconcile their distinctive tics with deeper traditions of rock.     They've always seemed like an indie rock band with a rock 'n' roll soul, and     here, they're trying to lose some of their outward quirkiness and just be a     rock band. But they'll never sound like just another rock band; some of their     peculiarities are so engrained in their sound that they stick out even more     here: the deceptively simple-sounding drum patterns, the combinations of     succinct riffs that somehow miraculously fit together just so, and of course,     Britt Daniel's voice, which if were up to me would be ranked as one of the     classic voices in rock. It's a great thing, hearing a band grow up without     losing sight of what made them so vital in the first place; and seeing as how     <i>Girls Can Tell</i> might not have ever seen the light of day, it makes it     even better.  It's worth cherishing.</p></div>"|7429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7429-girls-can-tell/|8.0|Nick Mirov

    Troupe</i>, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci are essentially a pop band whose accessible
    style has manifested as a more cerebral and elegant facet of Britpop.  The
    idea of the ever-jangly Myncis generating a record comprised almost entirely
    of acoustic instruments and rootsy tunes isn't exactly jaw-dropping; before
    <i>The Blue Trees</i> it seemed about as likely as Ida recording a record
    with balls.</p><p>
    
    Even so, if their new EP is to be considered shocking, it has little to do
    with the surface aesthetics, and much more to do with how accomplished it is.
    Gracefully sliding the genre into the acousto-folk realm results in a record
    that will be widely considered as Gorky's foray into ""maturity.""  Such a claim,
    though, superficially tends to degrade what's actually going on-- a grown-up
    record full of pretension and seeped in hebetude is not what Gorky's are
    offering.  Rather, it's an accomplished 24 minutes that are as wise and adroit
    as they are delightful.</p><p>
    
    If some of the band's past melodies have come off a bit oversweet, they make
    up for it in spades with <i>The Blue Trees</i>.  Though the EP is undeniably
    candied, Gorky's turn down the tone knob to ""understated,"" and avoid sounding
    cloying.  The shimmery instrumental title track opens the record with a gently
    picked guitar.  The song's instrumentation is like a sonic capillary with a
    piano, fiddle, and another guitar joining in one at a time, until they swell
    to a dense climax.  ""Wrong Turnings"" is another sublime instrumental that
    benefits from a similar dynamic, though is further bolstered by drastic
    tempo changes.  What could have been merely a languid, pretty composition is
    made gorgeously unpredictable by what paradoxically feel like uncontrived
    musical twists.</p><p>
    
    What's most impressive, though, is that <i>The Blue Trees</i> remains
    effortlessly sincere.  Euros Childs' wispy, affectation-free vocals are
    undeniably suited for the subtle nature of the material.  He's got the kind
    of voice that can make lyrics like, ""We slept underneath the stars/ And we
    talked about girls seen from afar/ What's her name?/ I don't know/ How do I
    get to know?"" over a ""Rosewood Casket"" melody, sound completely believable,
    if not heartfelt.</p><p>
    
    ""Face Like the Summer"" is a similarly winsome tune that could have been
    perfect campfire sing-along fare, had it been played on the guitar instead of
    Childs' keyboard.  This is no gripe, though-- Gorky's turn up the melancholy
    just enough to achieve poignancy, but swiftly avoid maudlin indulgence.
    Childs' aw-shucks approach to lines like, ""So young in years/ Probably end in
    tears/ But I somehow don't mind,"" endow the song all the more endearing.</p><p>
    
    Slight deviations from the quiet acoustic on a few tracks, though, makes for
    shakier business.  ""Foot and Mouth '68"" is the low point, a mournful
    instrumental with an ambient keyboard foundation.  The song is perhaps
    too meandering for its own good, and seems out of place on a release so
    succinct and cohesive. Their Honeybus cover, ""Fresher Than the Sweetness in
    Water,"" is slightly more poppy and psychedelic than the rest of the songs on
    <i>The Blue Trees</i>, but far more successful than ""Foot.""  Though drums make
    one of two cameos during the EP in this cover, a fiddle helps countrify the
    track and ensures integration.</p><p>
    
    The folk sound of <i>The Blue Trees</i> comes at the expense of Gorky's
    signature fun.  Still, when a record is this coherent in its abandonment of
    previously established conventions by its creators, a sense of festivity is
    barely missed.  With their neo-psycho-prog-pop abandoned, Gorky's Zygotic
    Mynci have created a work that is an illustration in the beauty in risk-taking
    by a band that's apparently more deft than they've been letting on for over a
    decade.  Fluke or not, <i>The Blue Trees</i> proves how unjust it's been to
    have Gorky's playing second fiddles to that other Welsh band, Super Furry
    Animals.  Finally, Gorky's are playing their own.</p></div>"|3529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3529-the-blue-trees-ep/|7.7|Richard M. Juzwiak

    more likely to reference Ann Wilson than Anne Frank.  Amid confusing reports
    that Royal Trux have broken up, Neil has gone the route of that other early
    Drag City artist and released a solo album. I still haven't heard the Malkmus
    record, but I gather from reviews that it's similar to his work with Pavement.
    Neil Michael Hagerty, on the other hand, is a bit of a curveball.</p><p>
    
    This record shares the Royal Trux fixation on rock history, but with looser
    songwriting and weirder instrumentation.  And, of course, it doesn't feature
    Jennifer Herrema's crazed singing.  I found her voice increasingly grating
    over the last two records, so that initially seemed a major plus.  And in
    truth, I do enjoy this record more than <i>Pound for Pound</i>.  Still,
    Herrema's vocal sneer was in some ways the soul of Royal Trux, and there does
    seem to be a hole in this record where her Steven Tyler-isms once existed.
    Maybe it's just me, but Hagerty seems a little lonely. He's playing every
    instrument; he's singing and writing every song-- the only person he's
    interacting with is himself.  Royal Trux, at their best, always got mileage
    out of the image of partners in love doing it their way.</p><p>
    
    But now I'm getting into the circumstances surrounding this record, as if
    they mattered.  What counts is the music.  And the music sounds like the demo
    tape for the Grateful Dead's <i>Aoxomoxoa</i>, with better songwriting and
    worse sound quality. Seriously, for a guy that owns his own studio and
    frequently collects checks as a producer, Hagerty has made some bizarre sonic
    choices on this one. The drum machine and bass are way down in the mix; a
    deliciously cheesy organ (just like Pigpen used to play!) is way out front,
    and nearly every track is about one-third guitar solo. The songs are short,
    though, so that's not as bad as it sounds. And while not technically one of
    the better guitarists in music today, the guy can still make it howl like
    Allen Ginsberg in a wind tunnel.  The harmonized guitar and organ parts on ""I
    Found a Stranger"" are a drone-lover's wet dream; when Hagerty bursts into his
    soulman falsetto around the three-minute mark, the contrast is divine.</p><p>
    
    The tunes these guitar solos hang on are 100% pure Americana, but filtered
    through a guy who's clearly removed from any sense of ""authenticity."" That is,
    Hagerty can sing a good folk tune like ""Repeat the Sound of Joy,"" even though
    he doesn't sound like he's spent any time in the country. (And this despite
    living in rural Virginia!)  This quality is what makes the Stones' <i>Exile on
    Main Street</i> such a great record. Both ""Whiplash in Park"" and ""Fortune and
    Fear"" thrive on classic rock riffs of the Allman Brothers kind, and ""Creature
    Catcher"" sounds like, I don't know, Canned Heat.  As an anonymous hippie once
    suggested, ""Turn it up, man!""</p></div>"|3702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3702-neil-michael-hagerty/|6.4|Mark Richard-San

My first pass
    through <i>fixed::context</i> left me completely bored. As with <i>E Luxo
    So</i>, there just didn't seem enough to the music to hold my interest. But
    each time I played it, <i>fixed::context</i> burrowed just a little deeper
    in my brain and I now hum the simple themes constantly, even when the record
    is nowhere in sight.</p><p>
    I may have been a bit slow on the uptake initially because <i>fixed::context</i>
    is an absurdly minimal proposition. The whole record is only 37 minutes long;
    there are only four tracks, and each has a handful of different sounds hitting
    only five or six different notes. I'm not being facetious here: it actually is
    easy to count all the elements in any given piece. The side-long ""20"" opens
    with some gurgling electrical pops that sound like the first Pole record. Then
    a gentle synthesizer drone comes in, then a reverbed electric guitar that
    slowly alternates between two chords, then there are a few glitches, then
    there's a chord change, and a few minutes later some noise folds in as the
    piece fades out. All this happens one drip at a time over the course of 18
    minutes.</p><p>
    This static sound world first struck me as tedious, but now I find myself
    holding my breath when I sense a change coming, to maximize the substantial
    impact. It's been said before about other bands, but when music evolves so
    subtly and so slowly, each change carries greater weight. Isaac Babel once
    wrote about fiction, ""No iron can stab the heart with such force as a period
    put just at the right place."" The same holds true with the chord change, and
    this Zen-like approach is what this Labradford record is all about.</p><p>
    And it <i>is</i> chords that drive the music on <i>fixed::context</i>, mostly
    plucked on a warm, spaghetti-western style electric guitar, E, A and D strings
    only. After dabbling with orchestral flourishes on their last two records,
    Labradford return to their instrumental roots here. To be honest, the clichéd
    sound of the ""soundtracky"" guitar is one of the things that turned me off from
    Labradford's last two records.  But here, they've stripped the thing down so
    completely, and placed it so far in front, that it can be heard it in a
    different way.  Its repetition almost seems like an electronic sequence,
    though the tone quality is pure early-'60s Nashville.</p><p>
    The guitar is the focus as always, but the surrounding noises are what give
    each track its personality. ""Up to Pizmo"" makes smart use of an ambient house
    bass thump throughout, another electronic technique completely recontextualized.
    On ""David,"" Labradford weave an Eno-esque drone through the chord sequence,
    which, believe it or not, recalls the slow bridge of ""I'll Melt with You.""
    Each track is cut from the same plain cloth, but identifying details become
    clear over time, and they're worth the wait.  Maybe I'm just meeting Labradford
    halfway, but this is an album I enjoyed spending the week in.</p></div>"|4617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4617-fixedcontext/|8.0|Mark Richard-San
